               <head type="sub">THE JEWELS.</head> 
               <p>AT half-past four of a warm June afternoon, Mr. Cameron came down from his law-office in the <title>Times</title> Building, and, walking to Broadway, took his seat in the stage for the Hudson River Railroad station, as he was in the habit of doing six days in the week and eleven months of the year. To the gentleman opposite and to the one at his side he bowed, both being his neighbors; that is, their country-seats were in the vicinity of his own. An interchange of calls, and an occasional pleasant remark as they journeyed to and from the city, was as far as the acquaintance had, as yet, progressed. Both neighbors were new men, i.e., they had just made their fortunes. Their superb villas had gone up the previous summer, while Mr. Cameron's more modest house had stood its ground against the tide of fashion for twelve years. Mr. Bulbous, the gentleman opposite, was finely dressed, with a slight pomposity of air, and large white hands which looked able to grasp and hold a great deal of his own and other people's property. Upon these capacious palms he was just drawing a pair of green kid<pb n="10-11" xml:id="VAC8154-00000004"/> gloves, which might remind even an unimaginative person of greenbacks. Bulbous had taken the stage at Wall-street-which magic street had been the scene of his operations since the first rise in gold, three years before. He had won and lost, won and lost-but ever winning more than losing-a very lucky gambler, who could now pave his <foreign xml:lang="FRA">porte-cochre</foreign> with silver pebbles, and his vestibule with gold tiles, if he so decreed. In three years he had grown to be a "solid man:" why should we ask if his conscience had also grown heavy? Certain it is, his accomplishments were of the practical rather than of the ornate order; and though his villa boasted of classic and <foreign xml:lang="FRA">renaissance</foreign> tastes, his own character may be described as decidedly Doric-heavy, broad, coarse. Within his elegant rooms he knew no more of Homer and the gods of Jupiter's satellites and the tidal waves of Light, of Ruskin and Tennyson, than in those sober days when gold was at par and he quite below it. In these respects he was not so rich as the quiet lawyer who was his <foreign xml:lang="LAT">vis-a-vis.</foreign>
               </p> 
               <p>The fat little man at Mr. Cameron's right hand, and whose estate joined his own on the banks of the Hudson, had made <emph>his</emph> money through a rocket-like rise in pork, when he was so fortunate as to be able to fill large orders from the Government. There is something awful in immense wealth as there is in all rare and vast things! The lawyer smiled as the fat little fellow mopped his shining face with his handkerchief, but a touch of respect subdued his amusement. He knew that Mrs. Grizzle had purchased a diamond necklace the preceding week, for which she had given more than the amount of his entire yearly income: and ought not the remembrance to serve as a check to his sense of the ridiculous?</p> 
               <p>"Warm day," observed Mr. Grizzle, making another dab at his forehead, "must be gitting off to Newport. Can't stand it here,-the lard fairly fries out of me. Mrs. Grizzle wants to git off right away. Going, Mr. Bulbous?"</p> 
               <p>"Not at present, sir."</p> 
               <p>"I told wife 'twas <emph>rather</emph> early. She said she 'sposed it was for them that were tied to business, but people with nothin' to do but spend their money couldn't begin too soon-ha! ha! You see, she bought some diamonds lately, and she's in a hurry to get where she can show 'em. Womenfolks are queer humans,-don't you think so?"</p> 
               <p>"Really, I beg your pardon, sir," said the broker, stiffly.</p> 
               <p>"Not at all, not at all," cheerily. "Be as non-committal as a barrel of uninspected mess, when the fair sect are to be invoiced. Every man has his own opinion on <emph>that</emph> delicate subject. Some considers 'em prime-some don't. They're an obstinate lot to drive, take 'em on foot;-all they're good for is for tender-lines-ha! ha!"</p> 
               <p>Grizzle had carried on his conversation in a loud voice, leaning a little forward; he was as talkative as he was good-natured; very fond of his little jokes,-so little, sometimes, as to be invisible to any one but himself. A lurch of the stage now threw him off his seat over against Mr. Bulbous, who drew himself up with icy blandness.</p> 
               <p>"Really, now," gasped little Grizzle, struggling back to his place, "these 'busses are as bad as a fall in the market to unsettle one's balance-sheet. Didn't intend to come at you, Bulbous, with a knock-down argument.-Ha, beg your pardon, sir!"-this to Mr. Cameron, from whose hand he had thrust a small packet by his unexpected <foreign xml:lang="FRA">sortie;</foreign> and, with the quickness characteristic of all his movements, he picked up the parcel before its bearer had time to recover it.</p> 
               <p>Before handing it back, however, he glanced at the superscription and express seals (in that little act cropped out the hopeless "Yankeeism" of the pork-merchant's character), and a look of surprise smoothed out the dimples in his cheeks.</p> 
               <pb n="12-13" xml:id="VAC8154-00000005"/> 
               <p>"Seems to be valuable," said he, with a little cough.</p> 
               <p>He had discovered that the packet came from over the seas-that it was marked "jewelry, $20,000 value, insured, etc.," all his curiosity twinkled in his eye, and from thenceforth to the end of the ride he fidgetted into various attempts to draw the lawyer into conversation, whereby he might learn something of this surprising affair.</p> 
               <p>But Mr. Cameron was lost in his own reflections. He kept careful hold of his treasure, and was wise enough to turn the address out of sight, keeping much cooler about it than his inquisitive neighbor, who grew quite subdued in his consciousness of Mrs. Grizzle's necklace, when here was this gentlemanly, but plain, professional man, receiving jewelry from Scotland to the tune of twenty thousand dollars. Before the stage reached its terminus, Grizzle had arrived at the conclusion that this was property held in trust for some client, who had fallen heir to an estate in Great Britain, which was partly true; but the client was the lawyer's own daughter.</p> 
               <p>One's thoughts can compass a great deal in brief time, and Mr. Cameron's, during the ride, had not been idle. He felt a little, just a little, regret that he, too, had not added to his legitimate business some side speculation which should have made him the monetary equal of these two neighbors. Yet, wherefore? He despised, in a calm, unconscious way, both of them; one for his cold blood and pomp of egotism, in which there was nothing of the finer shades and colors of the gentleman; the other for his unmitigated vulgarity. He was the superior of both, and knew that, secretly, they deferred to him. Wherefore should he, then, feel a pang of envy? It was not often that Mr. Cameron cherished discontent. Usually his self-love took the shape of approval of his own wisdom, which had chosen the full enjoyment of life as it progressed; due work, due leisure, due reward; time for love, means to gratify simple but elegant tastes, rich interludes of soul-life passed in the company of books, of nature, and of his wife, whose spiritual intuitions, like his own, were kept vivid by culture.</p> 
               <p>Doctors may disagree in regard to the nature of cholera, filling the ear with the din of their discordant opinions upon infection, contagion, sporadicity, &amp;c.; one malady there is, which even doctors must agree is both infectious and contagious, and that is the Mammon-fever. When exposed to its influence, but few can resist it. How general and direful has been the epidemic, during the last five years, all of us only too well realize; and Mr. Cameron, constantly mingling with those who were passing through all its stages, had at last grown slightly feverish. He was thinking how, had he taken certain oil-stocks, as a friend had advised him two years before, he might now be showing these glaring millionaires to what beautiful and noble uses money could be converted. His wife was a lady, and it did choke him a little when Mrs. Grizzle's glittering carriage dashed past their pony rockaway, throwing the dust in <emph>her</emph> eyes.</p> 
               <p>Do not imagine, dear, romantic maiden reader, that this middle-aged attorney is our hero; he is only the father of our heroines. Though he may not be at all interesting to you, there are those of his own age who still read and enjoy romance, and who not only read and enjoy, but are youthfully ardent in their sympathies, while they have the advantage of understanding human nature and human emotion far better than they once did, and of seeing straight through such limpid transparencies as young ladies' souls. You may take it for granted that the love-letters he once wrote were very much like those you are now receiving; and that he is as much astonished to discover a gray hair, simultaneously with the fact that his eldest daughter is of<pb n="14-15" xml:id="VAC8154-00000006"/> age to begin acting her part in the everlasting drama, as you will be at the same things just a little while in the future.</p> 
               <p>Alas! Time <choice>
                     <sic>neithers</sic>
                     <corr>neither</corr>
                  </choice> slumbers nor sleeps; yet, if he takes away, he also gives, and Mr. and Mrs. Cameron are much better material for the true artist than their lovely young daughters, to whom you are shortly to be introduced. To <emph>know</emph> life, we must <emph>live</emph> it. It is a mystery why, when we have just acquired some of the wealth of experience, all the beardless youths and cherry-cheeked misses should ignore us with a delicious self-conceit. We may tell them that we are their superiors; that, if they will be patient and listen, we can teach them something; but they laugh at us, as at any other "make-believe." Youth is wise in its own conceit; it never yet was troubled with doubts of its own sagacity; the bubble of life is ever sounding, roaring, bursting, according to the law of bubbles-the last rainbow-globe as beautiful as the first, and as brief in its beauty.</p> 
               <p>This is as it should be; "whatever is, is right." It would be a most doleful thing for babies to enter the world with gray heads, reproving their mothers for having brought them into such wicked society, refusing to pull flowers because to-morrow they will fade, or to eat bonbons because they will turn to acid in little stomachs. If young people had the prudence and wisdom of their elders, the world would come to an end before an hundred years from sheer inanition; there would be nothing new under the sun; no wiseacres to moralize, and no impatient, eager readers to "skip" the moralizing.</p> 
               <p>Mr. Cameron's income seldom exceeded six thousand dollars a year. In the good old days "before the war," it answered his purposes tolerably. There had been an instance in his practice when he was counsel in a "big case" of a contested will, and had received a fee of ten thousand dollars; but that event was unique in his experience.</p> 
               <p>With that money he had built a charming house on a five-acre bit of beautiful earth, bound, on one side, by the silver binding of the Hudson, and thereafter had dwelt there in comfort, not eager to be rich, but enjoying the best and finest that could be had for his earnings. It was only the propinquity of Bulbous and Grizzle which had given him the Mammon-fever that June afternoon. Propinquity is to blame for much that happens. When he stepped off the cars at a station not far beyond Washington Heights, and lifted his hat in farewell to those gentlemen, he began to feel a reaction.</p> 
               <p>The river lay in the warm light like molten gold poured upon lapis lazuli; a murmurous wind ran through the tremulous birches and whispered to the shadowy maples that watched above the lawn; the roses on the porch clung to the trellis in clusters of amorous sweetness; a high hedge shut out the nearness of Grizzle's new paint and evergreens, little round groups of verbenas laughed at him from the cool grass as he walked up the path; nothing was there in earth or sky or water to remind him of the superior quality of the Grizzle happiness.</p> 
               <p>It always was pleasant for Mr. Cameron to find himself approaching home; that day it was doubly so, for the city had been hot and tiresome, and he held in his hand a magnificent present for Milla, the younger of his two daughters. Yet, at thought of the present, he sighed-one of those faint sighs which tell of a constant care or sorrow.</p> 
               <p>"Poor Milla! said he, "I would throw this casket in the river if I could give you back what your aunt took from you."</p> 
               <p>It was a pleasant scene upon which he looked, as he<pb n="16-17" xml:id="VAC8154-00000007"/> stood for a moment, unperceived, in the open casement of the window. Through the vista of the long parlor, cool, yet full of light and perfume, he saw the library, and beyond that, through a bay-window, the green trees of the garden. By the library-table sat his only boy, the youngest of his three children, a fine-looking lad of fourteen. He had pushed his books from him, and, with head bent down on the table, was listening to the gay conversation transpiring in the parlor.</p> 
               <p>There were a young lady and gentleman, and a child curled up in an arm-chair. The young lady, Mr. Cameron's eldest daughter, Elizabeth, was standing up for her lover to bind about her head a fillet of myrtle and white flowers which he had been weaving.</p> 
               <p>A light was radiating in her face like that of sunlight behind a rose; he had not bound the fillet without telling her how well it became her; and who, that has been young and beloved, does not know how sweet it is to be praised, under such circumstances? She was not vain of her beauty, but she delighted in it when it gave <emph>him</emph> pleasure.</p> 
               <p>The gentleman might have been any where between twenty-eight and thirty-eight, though he looked not a day over the first-named age. He had the yellow moustache and dark-blue eyes of a German; his form was elegant, his dress fastidious; beyond that, he was not handsome. He stood, however, in no need of handsome features. "Pretty" men always shrank into insignificance in the company of Louis Dassel. A quiet power dwelt in his eye, a knowledge of the world in his air and conversation, more attractive to women than prettiness; while just that touch of foppishness was in his dress which proved him not averse to being admired.</p> 
               <p>"You are right, Louis; white <emph>is</emph> the most becoming wear for Lissa," said the little girl in the arm-chair. "You have as much taste as a woman, Mr. Dassel. Where did you learn to make wreaths?"</p> 
               <p>"Oh, Louis knows every thing! I've often told you so, Milla."</p> 
               <p>Elizabeth said this in such good faith as must have been flattering to the object of it; he laughed a little, making answer-</p> 
               <p>"There's one thing I do not know, Milla; and that is, how much Bettine loves me-for she never will confess."</p> 
               <p>"Well, I am wiser than you there, Mr. Dassel; for I'm quite certain she loves you-desperately!"</p> 
               <p>"Oh, Milla!" cried her sister.</p> 
               <p>"Thank you, Milla, for making her blush so prettily. Look at her now!"</p> 
               <p>Well worth looking at was Elizabeth at that moment. Her white dress, soft, and falling in profuse folds, her dark hair with its green fillet, her eyes shining with the light, her cheek rosy with the bloom of happiness. Delicious idleness of summer-hours!</p> 
               <p>Mr. Cameron remembered when Lissa's mother had looked just so, and he hovered silently in the window, loth to interrupt the little scene, and recalling, with a thrill, the days of his own courtship.</p> 
               <p>The couple before him were to be married in September, and he was willing they should gather every rose of this sweetest summer-time as it bloomed.</p> 
               <p>The father's eye wandered from the group to the face of the boy in the library. There was a scowl upon it, as he, too, watched the betrothed pair; yet his face was a pleasant one, to which scowls did not seem habitual.</p> 
               <p>"It is strange what an unreasonable dislike Robbie has taken to Mr. Dassel," thought Mr. Cameron. "I suppose Louis has been impatient with him over his Greek, at some time, and the boy has conceived a fancy that he is ill-tempered<pb n="18-19" xml:id="VAC8154-00000008"/> tempered. <emph>I</emph> never saw any indication of it. Children are apt to think their teachers severe. All the fault I have to find with Dassel is, that he is a foreigner. I could have wished my daughter to marry a native-born American. Still, what difference does the mere birth make? He is one of us, in heart. It was his love of liberty, his hate of tyrants, which drove him to this country. He might have been rich and honored, had he been willing to live under the yoke of despotism. His birth, his education and accomplishments, justify our pride in him. As to making a living for himself and Elizabeth, doubtless he will do as well as I and my Lissa have done."</p> 
               <p>And now, before her father steps in, let us glance at Milla Cameron. As she leaned back in the great chair of green satin brocatelle, she looked like a lily floating between its emerald leaves. You would not know whether to call her a child or woman. Her size was that of a girl of twelve; her face was infantile in its exquisite, waxen fairness; yet, its expression was that of womanhood. She was, really, sixteen-only three years younger than Elizabeth; but very slight and small, with a sort of preternatural beauty, childish, and still spiritual. Her pale, golden hair glistened around her face and shoulders in an ethereal vail. There was nothing fretful and pinched in her features, as is so often seen in those of invalids; she was dainty, delicate, and pale, but joyous and lovable. Suddenly she clapped her hands together with a gay laugh:</p> 
               <p>"There's papa in the window, getting ready to lecture you!"</p> 
               <p>"How was it we did not hear the whistle?" said Mr. Dassel, turning, quite self-possessed, to greet Mr. Cameron, while Lissa's cheek was as red as a carnation when her father came to kiss it.</p> 
               <p>"Too thoroughly preoccupied, I dare say," answered Mr. Cameron; and then he passed on to his younger daughter, whose face was all smiles at his approach, but who had not left her chair to greet him. "Here's your aunt Mildred's legacy; it came by the steamer yesterday. Go, Robbie, and call your mother; we must examine the packet together. You will be quite an heiress, Milla."</p> 
               <p>"Dear aunt Mildred! how sorry I am she is dead," she said, holding the packet between her small hands, looking up wistfully.</p> 
               <p>Her father walked into the library and back again. Mildred had been his favorite sister in the days of their childhood; she had been three months dead and buried, over the water, and the grief was a just one.</p> 
               <p>Mrs. Cameron came in with Robbie; she had a flower in her hand, which she placed in her husband's button-hole as she kissed him,-their romance was still in progression.</p> 
               <p>"Here are Milla's jewels. Shall I break the seals?"</p> 
               <p>The little party looked on with interest, while he removed the wrappers from the casket, turned the tiny key, and exposed the treasures within. Milla's little white fingers drew out one beautiful article after another, holding it up to the light; first, a superb set of diamonds, necklace and all; then another of diamonds and emeralds. The stones had been reset in the latest style. They glittered in her lap as if the lily had been deluged with dew. Mr. Dassel, at Mr. Cameron's request, gave them a critical examination. He knew all about jewels-was as expert in pronouncing upon them as if brought up to be a diamond merchant.</p> 
               <p>"This central stone in the necklace, and this in the brooch, are both particularly fine. Some of these emeralds are very valuable. The whole collection would be worth, in Paris, thirty thousand dollars; here, at the present rate of exchange, they are, of course, worth much more. Did you say they had belonged to a sister of yours, Mr. Cameron?"</p> 
               <pb n="20-21" xml:id="VAC8154-00000009"/> 
               <p>"Yes; or, rather, she bought them for Milla. Intending to leave a certain sum to her namesake, she put it in this shape, as secure and compact. She purchased the stones, and had them set a year ago, when told by her physician that she could not live many months. She wrote to me, before her death, her wishes in the matter."</p> 
               <p>"Dear auntie," said Milla, again. Her eyes were full of tears, and she added, very soft and low.</p> 
               <p>"I shall give them to you, Elizabeth. What do <emph>I</emph> want of them?"</p> 
               <p>"What do you want of them? To keep and to wear, darling, of course."</p> 
               <p>"I shall never wear them, Lissa. I wish you to have them. Come! they shall be my bridal present-a magnificent one, you will allow."</p> 
               <p>"Not so fast, little girl. Your aunt Mildred attended to all that. She meant <emph>you,</emph> and no one else, to have them. They constitute your fortune. If you should ever want for means, you have but to dispose of them, when the time of necessity comes, and you are comfortable for life. It is named in the will that you are never to give them away; and you are not to make any use of them, except to wear them, until you are of age. You see, your aunt knew what a generous heart my little girl has, and she did not desire you to impoverish yourself." Thus said Mr. Cameron. "This is your fortune, Milla."</p> 
               <p>"O, papa, <emph>you</emph> can always take care of me, I guess. They would do Elizabeth and Louis so much more good."</p> 
               <p>"Try them on, Milla."</p> 
               <p>"No, Lissa, you try them on, and then I can see their effect. I could not see them on myself. Louis, put them on your lady."</p> 
               <p>Dassel took the set of emeralds and diamonds, clasping the necklace about the throat, and bracelets about the wrists, of his betrothed, and with one star for the hair he fastened the fillet of myrtle.</p> 
               <p>"These should have been for <emph>you,</emph> Bettine," he whispered.</p> 
               <p>Softly as the words were spoken, Milla heard them. A single sparkle of fire shot from her eyes, and then she grew very pale. She believed no one noticed her emotion, and strove to conquer it. Presently the bell rang for dinner, and the gems were returned to the casket.</p> 
               <p>"Leave Milla with me; we will bring up the rear," said Robbie.</p> 
               <p>"Shan't I carry you, Milla? You look tired?" asked her father, tenderly.</p> 
               <p>"No, no, papa," with such decision, that the others left her to follow with her brother when she pleased.</p> 
               <p>"Little darling," murmured her brother, kissing her, as soon as the others were out of sight. "Elizabeth is a fine girl, but she is not half as beautiful as you. Nobody in the world could look prettier in these things than you, sis."</p> 
               <p>"Don't tell me so, Robbie. My heart aches horribly this afternoon. I know all about these jewels. Aunt Mildred never expected me to wear them. She thought it a convenient shape into which to put the money. She knew that <emph>I will never marry,</emph> Robbie, and this money is to support me. No husband will ever take care of <emph>me,</emph> Robbie! I'm not a little child, any longer; and I don't wish you to act as if I were. But don't tell mother; it will give her so much pain. Every one believes me a baby-and, indeed, I have been-until very lately."</p> 
               <p>"Now, Milla, how strangely you talk. No one thinks you a baby. At least, I don't. As to whether you ever will marry, that is a question. You're good enough and pretty enough for the best man that ever lived. If I were not your brother, and younger than you, <emph>I</emph> should marry<pb n="22-23" xml:id="VAC8154-00000010"/> you-that I know! People can be happy without being married; and I'm resolved that, if you are never wedded, I shall never be. We will live together, always. You can wear your pretty jewels to please me; you will not be obliged to sell them, because I shall make money enough for both. Don't cry, Milla, don't! Mother will not enjoy the dinner unless you are there."</p> 
               <p>She wrung her hands together, choking down her sobs. There were those who loved Milla as their own lives, knowing the trials before her; but in this, the first hour of her suffering, <emph>as a woman,</emph> they dreamed not of the change. Only the quick-sighted boy, who had heard Louis's words and seen their effect, lingered behind to express a sympathy for an emotion which he could but dimly comprehend.</p> 
               <p>"Come, Milla, for mamma's sake."</p> 
               <p>He half lifted her from the chair, walking by her side as they followed after the others to the dining-room. When she stood up, it became evident why Milla was marked out for the peculiar love and cherishing of her family. She was deformed-her back having been injured by an accident in her infancy.</p> 
               <p>This deformity had nothing of a repulsive character; it was so slight as to be scarcely apparent, with that bright vail of glittering hair worn always about her shoulders; but it impaired her health, and, as the years of childhood wore away, shadowed her with a painful self-consciousness. She had been a beautiful, sprightly child, the idol of the house, which numbered among its inmates her aunt Mildred, who then was a young lady, unmarried, very fond of frolicking with the two-year-old darling. In one of those frolics, while tossing the child high in air, she lost her hold by some mischance, and the little creature fell in such a way as to injure her spine.</p> 
               <p>The remorse, consequent upon this terrible accident, never ceased to haunt Mildred Cameron. Night and day she plead with the mother for the privilege of tending the sufferer: she was engaged at the time, but refused to marry until the child had recovered so much health as she would ever have.</p> 
               <p>The Camerons were of Scotch descent. Mildred married a distant relative, a scion of the ancient tree, and removed to Scotland, where her husband had estates. She had a small sum of money of her own-about equal to that with which her brother started in life. This she had never used, but constantly invested it so as to increase it, always with the purpose of securing a support to Milla. She knew the frequency with which fortunes were made and lost in America, and foresaw that a time might come when it would be well for the helpless girl to have a certain reliance. When her own health failed, she reckoned up her gains, and found she had six thousand pounds at her disposal. With this sum she bought the stones and had them set, thinking that, if the money did not draw interest, neither would it be lost in speculation.</p> 
               <p>The loving aunt had made all the restitution in her power, but Milla, as she gathered up the shining wealth had but gained a new pang with her jewels.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER II.</head> 
               <head type="sub">THE SILENT WITNESS.</head> 
               <p>THE same afternoon upon which Mr. Cameron carried home Milla's jewels, in the third-story front room of a tenement-house in M. street, Mrs. Bellows was getting supper. Although nearly sunset, the air, which came in at the two windows, seemed little less hot than that which radiated from the cooking-stove. The children looked tired and fretful as they hung at these windows, and the mother did not wear her most amiable expression as she moved the pan of fried potatoes from the griddle to the hearth, murmuring that Abel was late.</p> 
               <p>The house had a decayed look, but it was neat, inside and out,-evidently not yet surrendered to the tender mercies of our foreign population, though it had fallen from its ancient splendor as the residence of a down-town merchant, and was now occupied by half-a-dozen families. These people were all American-belonging to the respectable poor-who cherish a pride, in their way, quite as commendable as that of their more fortunate neighbors. A school-teacher and his family occupied the first floor; on the second was a widow, whose small annuity was made the measure of her expenditures; on the third, Abel Bellows, porter, while a pale girl, who colored photographs, had the hall-bed-room; on the fourth, two more widows, with sewing-machines-each and all more or less intelligent and ambitious, after the manner of our native-born people. Several had seen "better ter days;" more, hoped yet to see them. So that, while an air of poverty and privation pervaded these precincts, it was blest with neatness and order.</p> 
               <p>The third-floor tenants were the least refined of the inmates. These were "regular Yankees," with all New England's industry and "smartness." A lively rag-carpet covered the floor, in the centre of which stood the table, decently laid for supper.</p> 
               <p>Over an old-fashioned mahogany bureau hung a colored lithograph of Washington, while quite a pile of books was arranged on either side, including (bound in calf) "Josephus," the "Universal History," "Baxter's Saint's Rest," the "Casket," and the "Scottish Chiefs;" with sundry illustrated newspapers of the day. A Connecticut clock graced the centre of the mantelpiece. Towards this Mrs. Bellows threw many a weary glance; there was no doubt that the swing of the pendulum occupied precisely the same length of time at each sweep of its are that it did on the shortest winter day-for the old clock was as exact as any New England spinster, in all its ways-but it did seem, on this languid afternoon, to take an unconscionable time to its work.</p> 
               <p>"It's ten minutes of seven, and I reckon she's slow at that; though, to be sure, she was right when the bells struck for six. Then potatoes won't be fit to eat if Abel don't git along right away,"-and she wiped the sweat from her forehead with the corner of her apron; "Matthew, peek out the winder and see if yer father's comin'."</p> 
               <p>At that moment the door of the room opened, and a man stepped softly within. He, too, was wiping the sweat from his face, and looking very warm. He was a middle-sized and middle-aged man, with bright, honest blue eyes, brown hair, and light complexion. He glanced at his wife with a deprecating look, as he said:</p> 
               <pb n="26-27" xml:id="VAC8154-00000012"/> 
               <p>"Hope I haven't kept supper waitin', Abby. 'Twas so warm, I couldn't make much headway with my walk."</p> 
               <p>"If you call it warm out o' doors, what do you think it is, shut up in here with this cook-stove? O, yis, young ones, you can all laugh and holler, now father's come home,-but they've been as cross as bears all day,-and no wonder, stewin' in this oven."</p> 
               <p>"Why didn't you let 'em out in the street, if 'twas any cooler?"</p> 
               <p>"Because I ain't the woman, Abel Bellows, to let my children run on the street, associatin' with you don't know who, to say nothin' of the danger. I've got to bring them up in a garret, it seems, but I shan't bring 'em up on the street. I don't know where your pride's gone. It's little a mother can do, when they're own father hain't spunk enough to keep his family decent. Set down, all of you; supper's ready. No great shakes of a supper nuther; but it's all there was in the house to git. Strawberries are down to ten cents a box; but you didn't leave a cent of market-money, Abel."</p> 
               <p>"Didn't I? Wall, I guess I didn't happen to have any. But I've got a month's pay now, Abigail, and you shall have the berries for breakfast. Here, Toddle, father'll help him up," and he placed the smallest Bellows in the high chair by his side; but when he had helped his wife, and the little ones, to the fried potatoes, with scraps of bacon and bread-and-butter, and had taken his cup of tea, he forgot to put anything on his own plate, but sat staring at the brick wall opposite. His wife regarded him with wonder, but said nothing, for the heat had rendered her a little cross. Presently he withdrew his gaze and fixed it upon hers.</p> 
               <p>"I've got something on my mind, Abby."</p> 
               <p>"That worries yer?"</p> 
               <p>"That worries me."</p> 
                
               <p>His habitually pleasant face had a graver look upon it than she usually saw there, and as she noticed how uneasy he was in his mind, and that his eye fell before hers, the one dread of her life sprung up. She laid down her knife and fork, pushing her chair a little back, piercing him through with a sharp, angry regard:</p> 
               <p>"You don't dare to tell me it's lottery-tickets, Abel Bellows?"</p> 
               <p>"It ain't lottery-tickets this time, Abby; I 'most wish it was."</p> 
               <p>"If it ain't lottery-tickets, what can it be?" asked the woman, with a sigh of relief.</p> 
               <p>"It's nothing that concerns us in partikler; 'tain't no business of mine at all, in fact. But it's a weight on my mind-a dead weight. It's heavier than them loads used to be in the hardware store, before I got my place with Borden &amp; De Witt."</p> 
               <p>"What on earth is it?" queried Mrs. Bellows, sitting up again and eating rapidly, for curiosity had restored her appetite and removed her ill-humor.</p> 
               <p>"I can't tell nobody; for I don't know myself."</p> 
               <p>"For the Lord's sake, what a fool you are, husband! What are you talkin' about, if ye don't know nothin'?"</p> 
               <p>"I'm <emph>afraid</emph> I know it, Abby; I'm afraid. And I don't want to. That's jist it-I'd fur ruther not. It's awful!-and it worries me 'most sick."</p> 
               <p>"I should think as much! You hav'n't tasted your supper yit. I hav'n't see you so careless of your victuals since the store was robbed."</p> 
               <p>"That's jist it, again, wife; it's about that very robbery." He glanced at the children, and, lowering his voice, whispered across the table-"I'm afraid I've found out one of the parties concerned in it."</p> 
               <p>"Abel Bellows, do tell!"</p> 
               <pb n="28-29" xml:id="VAC8154-00000013"/> 
               <p>"Yes! and the very last person in the world you would suspect."</p> 
               <p>"Who?"</p> 
               <p>"I daren't say, even to you, Abby, for I'm not certain; and it might be wrongin' <emph>him.</emph> But, I've got a clue, and I'm going to foller it up."</p> 
               <p>"I guess I shouldn't go round blabbin' it, if I was told a secret," said the wife, with a touch of sarcasm in her voice.</p> 
               <p>"I know you could keep the secret, Abby-nobody better. I'd like to tell you as much as you'd like to hear; but I don't think it would be right jist yit. Wait a little-wait a little.-Hay, Toddle, how you cram your mouth!"</p> 
               <p>"Let him cram it, if he likes. I'm sure I wonder he has any appetite, shet up in this prison, without a blade of grass to tech his feet from one week's end to another. I'm sick of the city, Abel. I wish you <emph>would</emph> go back to Connecticut, and take a farm."</p> 
               <p>"I <emph>will,</emph> Abby, when my ship comes in."</p> 
               <p>"From Havana, I 'spose you mean. I've looked too long for <emph>that</emph> ship. My mind's made up, husband. You've solemnly promised me you won't squander any more of your small wages on lottery-tickets; and if you break your word again, as you've done before, I'll take the children and go on to where I come from. I can git a livin' there, I reckon."</p> 
               <p>"Don't talk so, Abby, please don't. What would I do without you and the children-without little Toddle here?" He turned to the dimpled little fellow, as dear and beautiful to him, in his faded apron and bare feet, with his tow-head and round blue eyes, as any "curled darling of the avenue." "Don't fret, wife, no more. By next Spring, if I have good luck, you shall have a place in the country-one that will be jist the kind. Yes, Abby, next Summer shall find us where we want to be. I've picked out our house already. You know I took a little excursion over to Brooklyn last Sunday. I rode clear out into the suburbs, and then I got out of the cars and walked, it was so pleasant. And I came to the handsomest little place you ever saw; it would suit you and the little ones to a T. I stopped and leaned over the front fence, and I made up my mind that was the spot I was looking for-none o' your brick city-houses, all up and down stairs, but a large, wide, white house, with green shutters, and a piazzer all round, like them houses down to Norrich; and flowers in the yard, with a big garden back, where the children can run and holler, and you could have your rows of lettuce and onions, as handsome as flowers to my eyes. I was so struck with it, that, when a gentleman came out, I asked the price, and if it was for sale."</p> 
               <p>"What did he say?"</p> 
               <p>"He said it could be bought, and the price was ten thousand dollars. That's about the figure-don't you think so, Abigail? If you'd like to go, I'll take you out there, next Sunday, and get your views of the property."</p> 
               <p>Mrs. Bellows did not seem very much fluttered by this vision of an earthly paradise. She had beheld too many castles-in-air fade and burst. Never was there a poverty-stricken and suffering family who lived in such ideal grandeur as Mr. Bellows'. He was always bringing home silk dresses and Paisley shawls, always getting a pony for the boy and a piano for the girl, always moving into a beautiful brown-stone palace or country villa-in imagination; that is, he always was looking forward to the day when he should <emph>draw a prize.</emph>
               </p> 
               <p>"And supposin' I did like it, what then?"</p> 
               <p>Her voice was rising, as she asked this, looking him full in the face.</p> 
               <pb n="30-31" xml:id="VAC8154-00000014"/> 
               <p>"Why, then, I hope-we'll buy it-next Spring."</p> 
               <p>"How would you pay for it?"</p> 
               <p>The bluff, hearty man seemed to shrink and grow smaller before the cool scorn of this question.</p> 
               <p>"Why, I suppose-I hope-I expect to have better luck. Before Spring"-</p> 
               <p>She arose to her feet, pain and anger whitening her face.</p> 
               <p>"Not another word, Abel; you've broken your promise. You've been wasting your money on tickets again."</p> 
               <p>"I only took a half, this time," he pleaded, nervously rattling his fork against the side of his plate. "It was only ten dollars, and I'm sure to have my luck turn, some day."</p> 
               <p>"Only ten dollars!" looking wearily at the darned and faded clothes of her little ones, at the greasy supper and close room, and walking to the window to hide her face, she burst out crying.</p> 
               <p>Poor woman! if it had been the first time, or the hundredth!-but it was not. Her husband might quite as well have been a drinking man; his one habit was as wasteful, though he was always so kind. The meal was quite spoiled for Mr. Bellows, now; he swallowed his cup of tea and left the table, looking guilty, and as if he wanted very much to approach and comfort his suffering wife, but was hardly bold enough to make the attempt. The children stared at their mother in mute astonishment, until little Toddle, quite overcome by sympathetic distress, joined in her crying with a chorus of wails. His father took him up, soothed him; then, as if gaining courage by having the child on his arm, approaching the weeping woman, and crooked his other arm about her neck, saying awkwardly,</p> 
               <p>"There! there! don't, Abby! You scare the little fellow."</p> 
                
               <p>"Abel Bellows, I don't know what under the sun and earth I ever married you for!"</p> 
               <p>"I don't, no more," he answered, ruefully, "unless 'twas because I was a Bellows, and you could blow me up"-a favorite pun of his, worn threadbare long ago; "and perhaps because I was Abel, and you thought I'd be able to take care of you. But, never mind, wife, it'll all come out right. Next year at this time we won't be here." He kissed her cheek, and sat down in the window, jolting Toddle on his knee; while she, silent, and, it may be, sullen and despondent, cleared up the dishes and washed them.</p> 
               <p>All this time the father jolted the baby, humming over and over- <q>
                     <l>"Blow the bellows, old man,"</l>
                  </q> until the child was asleep, when he slipped his night-gown on him, as deftly as a woman could have done it, and deposited him in the "trundle-bed," in the back room. The two other children were nodding against the window-sill, "tired out with the heat," as he said, lifting them also to a place beside little Toddle.</p> 
               <p>Then he walked back and forth several times through the close room; the gas was lighted in the street, and a faint night-wind began to rustle the window-shade.</p> 
               <p>"It's getting a trifle cooler, outside; I can't stand it, in here. Do you feel like taking a walk, wife?"</p> 
               <p>Mrs. Bellows had not recovered from her fit of depression; at first she did not answer; then, sulkily-</p> 
               <p>"I'm too tired; and I can't leave the children."</p> 
               <p>"They're all right, sound asleep; and won't wake up till mornin'."</p> 
               <p>"I shan't leave 'em, Abel Bellows-waking up in a fright and finding themselves alone;-and perhaps comin' back and seein' the house a-fire, and they a-smotherin' up in the third story. <emph>You</emph> can go out and enjoy yourself; but a<pb n="32-33" xml:id="VAC8154-00000015"/> woman's work is never done. I've got Matthew's trousers to patch."</p> 
               <p>"I'll ask Miss Bayles to mind the little ones; she'd as lief as not. Come, let us go down on the Bowery, and get a glass of soda-water or lemonade."</p> 
               <p>"<emph>I</emph> don't have the stomach to enjoy soda-water, when the young ones hain't had a treat for weeks. I'm not goin'; so you needn't wait for me."</p> 
               <p>With a soft sigh, Abel turned and went out. A single gas-jet burned dimly in the hall; he paused beneath it, fumbling for something in his pocket. Presently he found what he was searching for, and held it up to the light, which flashed over it in a dazzling, magical manner, fascinating to behold. The little object which he held up thus, for renewed examination, was a sleeve-button, of antique pattern, and probably of considerable value, for the button, which was of rich gold, held in its centre an emerald of large size and superb lustre-a real jewel, lambent lustre, which emanated from it in a green aureole.</p> 
               <p>"I know them buttons well, and I know who owns the mate. I found it <emph>there,</emph> true enough. My! my heart stopped beatin' when I saw it in that spot, and realized who it belonged to. It looks bad-desperate bad. That stun's worth money; it's curious he hain't complained of losin' it."</p> 
               <p>Just then a light step resounded near; Miss Bayles had come out of the hall-bedroom, and was approaching him; he thrust the shimmering, flashing sleeve-button back into his pocket, turning towards her with a flush, like that of guilt, on his merry, frank face.</p> 
               <p>"I feel lonely this evening; I was going in to see your wife."</p> 
               <p>Mr. Bellows cast a look of mingled pity and admiration at the pale face, as he answered the sweet voice-</p> 
                
               <p>"Step right in, then; she'll be uncommon glad to see you, for she's a little in the dumps herself, this evenin'. To tell you the truth, Miss Bayles," said the man, reddening, and changing his weight from one foot to the other, "I've gone and done it agin, and most broke her heart, I reckon. But you know, Miss Bayles, you do me the justice to believe, that I did it all for the best?"-regarding her with an anxious smile.</p> 
               <p>"Why, yes, Mr. Bellows, I know you did it because you hoped to win a prize"-</p> 
               <p>"And make up all I've spent in that way, and shut up Abby's complaints, and make her happy, as she deserves to be."</p> 
               <p>"But that does not make it right for you to break your plighted word,-while fifteen years of experience ought to teach you how slender your <emph>chances</emph> are."</p> 
               <p>"I know, I know it all. But when I've wasted so much money, bought so many tickets that didn't draw, I'm <emph>certain</emph> my chance must come soon. Don't you see it? I've spent about four thousand dollars in tickets since I got in the habit of first buyin' 'em, and I've never drawed but two hundred dollars yet; so I <emph>dare not</emph> stop now, I <emph>must</emph> get my money back. I must keep on until I do get it back."</p> 
               <p>Miss Bayles shook her head disapprovingly; he almost fancied that tears came into her dark eyes; he fidgetted back on to the other foot, changing the subject to his stereotyped question, whenever he met the delicate, sad-looking artist-</p> 
               <p>"How's business to-day, Miss Bayles?"</p> 
               <p>Now he knew the lady was not in business for herself-that she was paid by the job, not week; and this was his way of showing interest in her welfare. Impossible it would be to describe the respectful, tender tone and manner, in which the common-place inquiry was made. The young<pb n="34-35" xml:id="VAC8154-00000016"/> lady understood all the sympathy which it implied, smiling brightly as she said,</p> 
               <p>"We have all we can do, just now, thank you."</p> 
               <p>"That's good," was the hearty response. "I've been tryin' to git wife to go out for a mouthful of fresh air, but she won't; and when a woman won't, she won't, the song says; so I hope you'll cheer her up a little, Miss Bayles;" and he descended the staircase, leaving the young visitor to cheer desponding Mrs. Bellows.</p> 
               <p>When Abel reached the street, he looked up and down. He <emph>had</emph> proposed a stroll in the Bowery, to recreate himself with a sight of the crowds sure to be out in that vicinity; but his wife's rebuff had destroyed all desire for the little treat of lemonade or ice-cream, which he would have enjoyed if shared with her. Then, too, that thing which he had found, and which burned in his pocket like a coal of living fire, was the means of turning his steps in another direction.</p> 
               <p>Hardly aware of what was leading him, or whither he was going, that trouble of mind-that haunting mystery and terror which had taken up its unwelcome abode in his breast-impelled him to retrace the route he had so recently trodden, and, much to his own surprise, he at length found himself in R-- street, looking up at the closed windows of a tall marble store, across the main entrance of which glittered the name of the firm who were his employers-Borden &amp; De Witt. If a policeman had suddenly put the question, "what was he doing there?" he could not have answered; he was porter in the store, and had left it for the night, without any purpose to come back and stare at its blank outside walls.</p> 
               <p>Borden &amp; De Witt were importers of silks, shawls, and lace-goods. Abel Bellows had been with them as porter several years, enjoying their confidence, and even their respect; for, humble as was his position, who could deny genuine respect to his willing industry, his healthy, merry temperament, and to his own modest self-respect, pleasant fruit of American soil?</p> 
               <p>It was now nearly a month gone that Abel came down, one morning, to open the store. When he unlocked the ponderous bolts, and stepped in on the first floor, he was surprised at the silence which reigned. Usually the watchman, a careful, sober man, well-fitted for his post, was quite ready to be relieved of his tedious night-duty; but on this occasion he did not make his appearance.</p> 
               <p>"Fallen asleep, perhaps," thought the porter, loudly calling his name, without obtaining an answer. He then proceeded to "look up" his friend, when he observed some disorder in the arrangement of goods; his heart beat a little faster as he ascended the broad staircase to the second story, but he stood quite still when he saw the watchman there, lying upon the floor, dead, in a pool of his own blood. When the first shock left him power to move, he rushed out after the police.</p> 
               <p>An examination showed the poor watchman to have been dead for several hours, and the store to have been robbed of about twelve thousand dollars' worth of dress-silks, a couple of costly camel's-hair shawls, and a quantity of expensive lace; in all, goods to the amount of twenty thousand dollars.</p> 
               <p>No clue had, as yet, been obtained as to the robber or robbers.</p> 
               <p>The goods had evidently been selected with the view to get as much value into as small a compass as possible; the whole could have been carried in a couple of ordinary trunks.</p> 
               <p>It was believed that the robber had killed the watchman in self-defence, as the revolver which the latter carried had<pb n="36-37" xml:id="VAC8154-00000017"/> been fired twice, the ball from one discharge lodging in a pillar near by; the other had not been found. His death had been effected by a blow from a stool, which lay broken near at hand.</p> 
               <p>The excitement had partially subsided; the victim was buried, his widow pensioned by the firm, the police instructed that their continued vigilance would be liberally rewarded:-what new interest was it that drew Abel Bellows, on this languid summer evening, back to the familiar street, to gaze up at the building, which he had quitted not two hours previously?</p> 
               <p>Early that morning, while sweeping out a portion of the third floor, he had accidentally overturned a pile of small paper-boxes, containing laces. As the covers flew off one or two, something dropped with the soft goods, which made a slight, ringing noise, and rolled away a few feet distant. He thought it a small gold coin, which had come by chance into the box, along with its legitimate contents; but, upon picking it up, found it to be a sleeve-button. He held it, and gazed at it, as if the green stone with which it was set had been the glittering eye of a basilisk. He knew to whom they belonged; he had observed the pair, frequently, in the snowy wristbands of their owner, for they were of peculiar pattern, while the brilliancy of the gems must have attracted the attention of the most indifferent person.</p> 
               <p>How came the button in the box? and why had the loser not proclaimed his loss? The person to whom it belonged had no business to send him to that part of the store, though he might possibly have been called there on an errand. It was from those very boxes the laces had been abstracted on the night of the robbery. How their owners, when examining into their losses, could have overlooked this stray button, he could not see.</p> 
               <p>He placed the silent witness carefully in his vest-pocket, and resumed his sweeping.</p> 
                
               <p>All that day Abel remained in a state of subdued excitement. He could not make up his mind to inform his employers of his discovery. Indeed, the most of the time he succeeded in persuading himself that he was, that he must be, mistaken in the inference which he drew from the simple fact of the button being in that box. It was the restlessness consequent upon this state of mind which had drawn him back, to stare, by gas-light, at the house of Borden &amp; De Witt.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER III.</head> 
               <head type="sub">THE STORY OF COUNT KONISBERG.</head> 
               <p>THE Camerons had forsaken the dining-room for the cool porch. The river was now as pink as the roses which hung on the trellis; a soft wind was rising, so that numberless little sails fluttered like doves over the water; a great steamer panted by, on its way down from Albany; a dark line of shadow lay under the Highlands; the green lawn grew more rich and velvety in the horizontal light-the faces of the women more beautiful.</p> 
               <p>Mr. Cameron sat on a rustic sofa, his wife by his side, and Milla in his lap, her face, unusually pale, drooping languidly on his shoulder. Robbie was on the steps, whittling out a miniature yacht, taking for his pattern that of their neighbor Grizzle, which was now lying at a little dock, at the foot of the Grizzle lawn,-or what would have been the foot, had not the unsparing iron-horse cut off its toes. The lovers were pacing slowly back and forth, Elizabeth still wearing her myrtle fillet.</p> 
               <p>"I should think Grizzle junior would be out with his yacht to-night. Perhaps he's afraid of her, since he got knocked overboard the other day," said Robbie.</p> 
               <p>"He knows as much about sailing as he does about playing the flute," laughed Lissa. "Hark! we are doomed to another serenade!"</p> 
               <p>"Horrible! how can you laugh, Bettine?" exclaimed Dassel. "I wonder if that fellow is to annoy you all summer mer with that outrageous flute. There ought to be an asylum, where people who will insist upon learning to play the flute and bugle in the open air, could be shut up in an enclosed place, far from all other human habitation."</p> 
               <p>"The joke of it is," added Robbie, "that he does it on purpose to interest Lissa. It's the way he has chosen to make his passion known."</p> 
               <p>"Nonsense!"</p> 
               <p>"You needn't deny it, Lissa. You know it as well as I. He's smitten-badly. If you'd break a hole in the hedge, you'd see him sitting at this end of their veranda, rolling his eyes in this direction, and redder than ever with blowing so much."</p> 
               <p>"If that's the case, it's a wonder you don't encourage him, Bettine. Half a million is not to be won every day," and Dassel's blue eyes looked into those of the girl to whom he was betrothed, to read the effect of his light remark.</p> 
               <p>"I have all I want in this world, Louis."</p> 
               <p>"Thank you, Bettine; but, for my part, I like money. It's extremely uncomfortable to have to do without it. Think of that fool over the fence,-as incapable of receiving any polish as a boiled beet. Yet he will have influence. Already they run after him, because he has money, and spends it freely. That is the sort of people who rule in America. Blood, culture, ability, go for nothing. Sometimes I get tired of this country. You have no aristocracy,-that is your boast. Why, my dear child, you have the most cruel, tyrannical aristocracy on earth! A hog-merchant, when he sells enough pork, can put his foot on the neck of a gentleman."</p> 
               <p>"Don't make us worse than we are, Louis," said Mr. Cameron, who had been listening. There is a class which is not made up of the suddenly rich, and which pays no homage to the money-kings."</p> 
               <pb n="40-41" xml:id="VAC8154-00000019"/> 
               <p>"Neither does it receive homage. I think you are mistaken in saying there is <emph>a class,</emph> Mr. Cameron. Isolated cases of people who preserve their self-respect, there may be. But, as a rule, the wealthiest are the most honored; and, unfortunately for the tone of society here, these usually are plebeians, with no traditions of what ladies and gentlemen should be. In Europe, if a man has blood, and education, he may be as poor as a church-mouse, but he will be treated as an equal by those whose fine instincts enable them to recognize his claims."</p> 
               <p>"You are too sensitive, Louis; some one has been wounding your pride."</p> 
               <p>"I'm insulted every day, as far as that goes, Mr. Cameron. I am poor; I work for a living; and the men who employ me are too ignorant to appreciate my claims to consideration. I wish <emph>I</emph> had money,-it is dull, getting along without it."</p> 
               <p>"Why, then, marry Mr. Grizzle's daughter," laughed Elizabeth,-"follow the advice you gave me."</p> 
               <p>"Has he a daughter?"</p> 
               <p>"Yes," interrupted Robbie, "but she's just eleven, so you will have to leave her to <emph>me,</emph> Mr. Dassel. Otherwise," he added, <foreign xml:lang="ITA">sotto voce,</foreign> "I'll warrant he'd be after her, notwithstanding he's caught our Lissa."</p> 
               <p>"Louis would marry no one who was not a lady," said Milla.</p> 
               <p>"Then I'd recommend him to Camille Bulbous," and Robbie chuckled;-"she's large and white and waxy, like her father. She has a most imposing manner. But it don't impose on me, for when she called on mamma, she talked of nothing but her 'servants,' and what horrid creatures they were. 'You don't know what you escape in not keeping a butler and a footman, and a French dressing-maid, Mrs. Cameron, and the gloves they make way with is frightful ful. We've dismissed three butlers in as many months, for obtaining false keys to papa's wine-celler, and giving parties to the neighbors' servants every night when we've gone out. And Matilda wears my best dresses to 'em, I know; for I found an <emph>enormous</emph> wine-stain on my rose-colored satin, and had to take out a whole gore. I'd have sent her kiteing that minute, for my temper was quite upset; but she makes these three loops in my hair exquisitely, and I felt that I <emph>could not</emph> spare her. <emph>Isn't</emph> it a trial, Mrs. Cameron?'-and then mamma answered very quietly, 'that, as she only kept three servants, and had changed none of them for the last ten years, she was hardly competent to judge.' That took Miss Bulbous down a peg; for ten years ago <emph>her</emph> mother was doing her own work, and I could see that it put her in mind of it. She arose and said their span of black horses were <emph>so</emph> fiery they wouldn't stand over five minutes, and she sailed out like a three-master."-Robbie was whittling out his yacht, and naturally gave a nautical turn to his figures of speech.</p> 
               <p>"You talk too much," said his mother</p> 
               <p>"I know it, and I beg your pardon, Lady Cameron. But, mayn't I just tell what Susie Grizzle told me, over the hedge, that same afternoon, that Miss Bulbous said to her mamma?"</p> 
               <p>"If it's 'over the hedge,' it can't be 'under the rose;' but, you must not betray private conversation."</p> 
               <p>"It won't do a bit of harm, and I want to betray it, dreadfully. She said 'she called on us, because we belonged to the first families; we weren't very rich, but we were aristocratic; some of our relatives in Scotland were lords and ladies, and the law was a very genteel profession; it placed a person quite on an equality with a broker!' Then Susie's mother declared that she was quite afraid of us,-we had so many books and picters, and knew so much, it made her<pb n="42-43" xml:id="VAC8154-00000020"/> uncomfortable. But!' she added, 'Sam's dead struck with Miss Elizabeth, and I s'pose we'll have to be sociable on his account.' Then Miss Bulbous hinted that she thought Sam could do better, as Miss Cameron was pretty enough, but had no <emph>style.</emph> She'd advise his mother not to encourage it. If Mr. Grizzle, junior, wanted to reflect credit on his position, he ought to get him a <emph>stylish</emph> wife. He would have no trouble, for, if she <emph>did</emph> say it, Mister Sam was quite a favorite in society."</p> 
               <p>"And Susie told you all this? She must be a queer child."</p> 
               <p>"She's a little imp, father. Smart, and full of mischief. I didn't want her to talk to me, but she would do it. She told me Sam had bought a flute because he had heard that Miss Cameron was fond of music."</p> 
               <p>The dismal wailing of that dolorous instrument still floated over the hedge, at this instant rising into such an absurd climax of discord that the family groaned and laughed in concert.</p> 
               <p>"Where's my hat?" cried Dassel. "I must get away from this. Better the city's hum than the divine silence of a place like this, intruded upon by the braying of an ass."</p> 
               <p>"Does it irritate you, for others to admire your Lissa?" asked Milla. "And would you run away, leaving her to bear her afflictions alone? Don't be selfish, Louis."</p> 
               <p>"That's asking me not to be human, Milla. Seriously, though, I must get back to town early, to-night, which brings me to telling my bad news,-at least, bad to myself."</p> 
               <p>The lovers paused in their promenade, before the bench where the parents were seated, Dassel addressing himself to Mr. Cameron, and Lissa looking up anxiously into his face.</p> 
                
               <p>"What is it, Louis?"</p> 
               <p>"I have been here six hours, and have not yet mustered courage to tell Bettine that I must start for St. Louis, within a week, to be gone, it may possibly be, for a month."</p> 
               <p>"To St. Louis? this hot summer weather! Why, Louis, it will kill you. You are not accustomed to so hot a climate."</p> 
               <p>She, who was so chary of her demonstrations of feeling, clung to his arm with a sudden close grasp, as if she would not let him go.</p> 
               <p>"Business, I suppose!"</p> 
               <p>"Yes, sir. Borden &amp; De Witt think they are on the track of those stolen goods. They believe them to be in St. Louis. I am to go, very quietly, to that city, obtain the aid of a detective there, and follow up the clue. They trust the matter to me, because they believe I can manage it better than most men. It will be a change to me. I do not dislike the idea of the journey; though Bettine, here, seems inclined to summon up perils. If only <emph>you</emph> were ready to go with me!" he whispered to her, "then my only objection would be removed. But we are not ready for that, Bettine."</p> 
               <p>"I should not fear the climate for the next few weeks. What reason has the firm to suppose the stolen goods are out there?" said Mr. Cameron.</p> 
               <p>"You remember I have frequently mentioned a relative of mine who came from Germany, and established a silk-store in St. Louis? Hearing of the robbery perpetrated in our house, he wrote to me that some goods had been offered to him under suspicious circumstances; and that, if the firm thought best, he would hold the negotiation pending until they could send on an agent to examine into the affair. From his description of the silks, the firm believe them to have been taken from their warehouse; the laces also are<pb n="44-45" xml:id="VAC8154-00000021"/> probably, in the same place. If I succeed in recovering them, I shall have the reward, which is a thousand dollars, to aid us in going to housekeeping, Bettine. The other two firms for whom I correspond, are at present enjoying their idle season, and have no objections to sparing me for a month; so, I have concluded to go."</p> 
               <p>Elizabeth still clung to his arm; her mother gave her an affectionate glance; but no one heard the sigh which Milla smothered in her father's breast.</p> 
               <p>"It is strange," mused Dassel, looking out dreamily on the darkening river, "what mere spider's-webs will sometimes hang a man! It is no wonder that criminals never feel safe to enjoy the fruits of their guilt. They know not at what moment, through what unexpected chance, they may hear the click of the prison-door shutting upon them, or feel the noose about their necks. Some trifle, which no cunning could have foreseen, will betray them. I have a morbid taste for tracing out extraordinary cases of crime, and learning <emph>what</emph> was the careless footprint left uncovered, or whose was the eye of fate gleaming upon the unsuspected, which led finally to detection and exposure. You would be astonished to find how often, as I have said, a spider's-web will be strong enough to hang a man. Sit you down, Bettine," he added, giving her a chair, while he walked, restlessly, up and down the porch.</p> 
               <p>Robbie's eyes followed him. It was too dark now for him to continue his work upon the yacht. The moon was coming up through the purple twilight, large and full. A pillar of silver toppled and fell across the river. The increasing white lustre of the moonlight took all the color out of the grouped faces, giving them, instead of bloom, a sort of weird radiance.</p> 
               <p>"You want to tell a story," said Robbie, his eyes still watching Dassel's,-"you're as restless as the Ancient Mariner."</p> 
                
               <p>"What are you talking about, boy?"-the young man ceased his walk, speaking in a startled voice,-then, laughing lightly, "you have guessed right, Master Robbie. I was struggling against the desire to tell a tale brought vividly before me by the subject under discussion. Tell me which is the wedding-guest, and I will at once buttonhole him, for I shall have no rest till the murder is out,-premising, however, that, unlike the Ancient Mariner, I am not the hero of my own story," and drawing a chair beside Elizabeth's, he added-</p> 
               <p>"If I tarry to tell it, I shall miss the next train."</p> 
               <p>"It is not yet nine o'clock," said Lissa, and "tell it! tell it!" said all the others.</p> 
               <p>Sam Grizzle had, apparently, choked himself on his own flute, and expired in a splutter of over-due notes, so that nothing disturbed the moonlit silence but the low lapse of the river, as Louis Dassel, in a musing tone, as if recalling the incidents, one by one, began his story:</p> 
               <p>Do you remember my ever mentioning my friend Count Konisberg? I presume not, for of late years I have dropped his name from my tongue, as I have his friendship from my heart. Yet, there was a time when Karl and I were like brothers. You know, in Germany, men are not ashamed to fall in love with each other. We have warm hearts; and our manners do not hold too stiff a rein upon them. So that the attachment between Karl and myself was well understood by our acquaintances.</p> 
               <p>He was of higher rank than I, and had more wealth, for, as I have told you, my struggles for the Republic impoverished me almost in my boyhood; but, we sympathized politically, and once, when I was in great straits, he offered me a home and concealment in the most secluded of his numerous houses, a castle quite inaccessible to common<pb n="46-47" xml:id="VAC8154-00000022"/> travellers, but a most delightful spot in summer, from its high position among the mountains.</p> 
               <p>The Count always passed his summers at Baden-Baden, remaining as long as there were any visitors to keep him company in his nightly sittings at the gaming tables,-for here was his fault. He had acquired a passion for that universal stimulus to watering-place life. This did not disturb my liking for him, but, rather, excited my pity, and many were the plain expostulations he had to listen to from me.</p> 
               <p>Karl had not his rival in the kingdom in handling the sword; nor in riding a horse was any one his equal. He was an immense favorite with the ladies on account of his many accomplishments, as well as for the magnificent manner in which he wasted his fortune. Women are terribly severe in their own morals, but it does seem to add greatly to a man's fascinations that he should be a little wicked. It is like children playing with fire; their mothers have told them it would burn them,-but then, how bright, how irresistible it is! Don't pinch my arm, Fraulein-I don't mean <emph>you.</emph> It is the exception proves the rule!</p> 
               <p>The Count Konisberg won a great deal at the gaming-tables; but, in the long run, he lost, also, much more than he gained. It began to be whispered that he was nearly ruined. I tried, at that time, to save him, and had the pain of realizing that my influence was inferior to that of his master-passion. Yet, with all these disastrous rumors flying about, the Count would not have found it difficult to repair his fortune with that of some lady of his own rank, for half the court-ladies were in love with him.</p> 
               <p>How surprised, then, was the world, when, at the end of his third Baden season, he suddenly married the daughter of a Dutch merchant, who had accompanied her father on a tour for health, and had watched over him, dutifully, as he drank the waters, week by week. Her great wealth was supposed to be the inducement. The daughters of German kings and princes might have a slender setting-out, compared with that of this untitled <foreign xml:lang="DEU">fraulein.</foreign> Her father, flattered by the alliance, decked her out with jewels until she shone like the tomb of Mahomet, and filled her purse with guilders until it was ready to burst. That purse suffered many and sudden depletions, but always was patiently refilled.</p> 
               <p>The new-made Countess of Konisberg was a beautiful woman. She might easily have been loved for her own sake, and I, for one, gave Karl credit for having some real affection for his bride. Her flaxen hair, when brushed out, must have fallen to her knees in a thick mantle; her skin was like snow; and, in the absence of that self-possession which comes from long mingling with good society, she had a certain stateliness of carriage consequent upon a full, tall figure. Add to this the richness of her attire, and she was a wife not to be ashamed of, although she quailed, with the natural timidity of her yielding temperament, before the cold regards of envious ladies of rank.</p> 
               <p>I have heard that she always summoned the Count, before she appeared in full dress, to criticise her toilet, after having been once hurt by some sharp reproof of his on her want of taste. Be that as it may, they appeared happy together. No one could find excuse for scandal in the gallant, devoted manner of the husband. As winter came on, the pair went to Paris, were received at court, and soon excited universal remark by the extravagance of their expenditures, and the increasing beauty of the countess, whose <foreign xml:lang="FRA">mauvais honte</foreign> wore rapidly away, and whose toilet grew to rival that of Eugenie's both in its costiliness and the perfection of its adaptation to the wearer. There is no teacher like love. The daughter of the Dutch merchant loved her lord and <emph>master</emph> (the very word, Bettine!) much more than he<pb n="48-49" xml:id="VAC8154-00000023"/> deserved; and in studying to satisfy him, she delighted and pleased all others.</p> 
               <p>It was some time in the month of January that a strange thing occurred. You may have heard of it, through the newspapers, for the case was so remarkable as to arrest universal attention. Count Konisberg was called away to his estates for a few days, leaving his wife in Paris. Invitations were already out for a grand ball, to be given by the Princess Metternich, and the Count proposed to return, on the evening of the ball, if possible. He directed the Countess not to shut herself up, on account of his absence, and, above all things, to order a new dress, and be ready for the <foreign xml:lang="FRA">fte,</foreign> saying, that if he arrived in time, he would join her; if not, she could go under the protection of the elderly Countess Nold, who would call for her.</p> 
               <p>The evening of the ball came, and at nine o'clock, the carriage of the Countess Nold drove up before the apartments of the Countess Konisberg. The old lady was anxious to be early in the long line of carriages, as she had not patience to sit <emph>over</emph> three hours, on a winter-night, awaiting her turn to alight at the imperial residence. That early arrival, mind you, was one of the spider's-webs upon which hung the destinies of more than one. I'll warrant you, Count Konisberg has cursed it, heartily, every day of his life, up to this, if it so be that he is still in the land of the living.</p> 
               <p>"Ask Madame, the Countess, to descend directly," said the arbitrary old creature, to the footmen who opened the carriage-door. "It's cold, and I will not alight if your mistress is ready."</p> 
               <p>She waited fifteen-twenty-minutes.</p> 
               <p>"These young coquettes are never willing to part from their mirrors," she grumbled.</p> 
               <p>Just then Countess Konisberg's dressing-maid flew down the steps, over the pavement, thrusting her pale face inside the carriage.-"Oh, Madame, what shall we do? We are greatly alarmed, and the Count being gone, we have no one to direct us. The door of the Countess' room is locked upon the inside; we can procure no answer to our appeals, and I'm afraid-I'm quite positive, Madame, that I perceive the fumes of charcoal!"</p> 
               <p>"Burst it open, you fools!" cried the old lady, jumping to the ground as quickly as a girl;-she had taken an interest in the innocent, affectionate bride, from the first day she had met her;-her own old heart was so worldly, through and through, that this simple nature had a great attraction for her. She flew up the stairs, and applied her nose to the key-hole.</p> 
               <p>"Bring an axe," she cried, "and say nothing outside. I don't want the police here, unless it's necessary."</p> 
               <p>The terrified servants, obeying her resolute orders, soon had the door broken in; the room was indeed full of deadly fumes from a small brazier, standing on a foot-stove near the chair, upon which sat the beautiful Countess Konisberg, in full grand toilette, her head thrown back against the cushions, her jewelled hands folded in her lap-dead.</p> 
               <p>As sweetly as if sleeping, she reclined in the easy-chair, her splendid hair elaborately dressed, glittering with diamond-dust, and the full folds of her white velvet petticoat and overskirt of lace shining with gems, as if dew had been dashed over them. I'm not a fashion-reporter, I hope, but I remember well all the details of this tragic affair, as they were, at that time, thoroughly discussed. It was shortly before I left for America, and I was then in Paris, endeavoring to raise money, to pay my passage.</p> 
               <p>-"I thought you sailed from Bremen," interrupted Robbie.</p> 
               <pb n="50-51" xml:id="VAC8154-00000024"/> 
               <p>"Well, so I did, my child; but I was in Paris earning money as a tutor, as I have said."</p> 
               <p>"Robbie, you are so brusque, sometimes, you are almost rude. Go on, Louis,-we are so much interested," said Mr. Cameron.</p> 
               <p>-Windows were thrown up, and the lights, which were expiring, blazed up again. The half-dozen servants gazed stupidly at their young mistress. It was evident that she had deliberately prepared for and committed suicide.</p> 
               <p>"This is bad-bad!" murmured the old Countess. "I shall have to summon the Prefect. Poor child! I really believed her happy."</p> 
               <p>"And to think I should have dressed her, with these very hands, not over an hour ago," sobbed her maid.</p> 
               <p>"She hurried me so, for she said, Madame, that you would be early, and she did not like to keep you waiting. She would have every thing <emph>just so,</emph> even to the <foreign xml:lang="FRA">bouquet de corsage,</foreign> for she said, she expected the Count would be home, and she wished <emph>him</emph> to admire her. She was magnificent! I was so proud of her!" with fresh sobs.</p> 
               <p>"How came you to leave her?"</p> 
               <p>"She bade me go, get my dinner. She would read until you came. When I returned the door was fast. I thought nothing of it, until I came again after your arrival."</p> 
               <p>"Perhaps she is not dead," said the energetic old Countess. "If she isn't, I'll shake this nonsense out of her," and she dashed an ewer of water over the white face and bosom, dragged the apparent corpse close to the window, fanning, clapping and blowing, until-yes! actually-there was a struggle for breath-the lids flew open and again closed. But, life was not entirely extinct, and those around her worked with vigor. In the meantime, the carriage had been despatched for a physician, who soon arrived, and, under whose careful treatment, the nearly dead was called back to the existence she had seemed so anxious to quit.</p> 
               <p>Just as she was laid upon her bed, pale, exhausted, still scarcely breathing, her ball-dress drenched with water, her hair dishevelled, Count Konisberg burst into the room. He had heard from the servants what had occurred, and his face was nearly as white as hers, his eyes shot fire; it was impossible to tell whether he were most grieved or angry.</p> 
               <p>"Margaret! Margaret!" he called, in a loud voice, "how is this? do you then hate me, that you kill yourself? I cannot believe it! Doctor, I cannot understand it. If she did not love me, then I have deceived myself. Suicide! was it then because I refused her a necklace, which would have cost me a hundred thousand francs, when she has now three equally costly? She was cross-but I did not dream of this. Great Heaven! how pale she is. Do you think she will live, Doctor?"</p> 
               <p>"She may, with extreme caution used in rallying her. But, she will be on the brink of the grave for some days."</p> 
               <p>"I, myself, will not sleep nor leave her, until she is out of danger. Give me my directions. Oh, Margaret!" bowing himself over the small hand, which lay motionless on the counterpane.</p> 
               <p>The Countess Nold afterwards declared that a shiver ran through the hand as he did so. She, with characteristic decision, called for a dressing-gown to put on over her finery, declaring her intention to remain, as long as she could endure the fatigue. The Count courteously begged of her not to attempt it; it would weary her, and there was not the least necessity; he had his orders from the Doctor, and should devote himself to their fulfilment. But she was in one of her obstinate moods,-providential, I believe, she afterwards esteemed it.</p> 
               <p>The Doctor went away, the maid curled herself up on a<pb n="52-53" xml:id="VAC8154-00000025"/> sofa, to catch snatches of sleep between times; and the two watchers sat, hour after hour, at opposite sides of the bed, their eyes fixed on the patient, occasionally giving her a stimulating potion.</p> 
               <p>"One can do this, as well as two," the Count had said, several times. At last the old lady began to nod; he arose, and going into the hall, gave orders to a servant stationed there.</p> 
               <p>"I have told them to bring out the carriage, to take you home. I cannot permit you to overtask yourself in this manner, my kindest friend," he said, as he came back, and she started out of an incipient snore.</p> 
               <p>"Well! well! I suppose it is so. But I love the child as a daughter, and I'm coming back as soon as I have had my sleep out, to see how she progresses. Bye-bye, Margaret,-and don't you do any thing so foolish again!"</p> 
               <p>She stooped to kiss the patient, who was now lying with wide-open, anxious eyes, moving her lips as if she wished to speak. Suddenly, as her visitor turned from the bed, she sprang half up from her pillow, crying out-"Don't leave me! don't leave me alone with <emph>him!</emph>"</p> 
               <p>"What is it she says?" asked the astonished Countess Nold.</p> 
               <p>"She must be wandering in her mind. I believe it is a consequence which we are to expect," answered the Count, a little impatiently. "You had better go at once. Nothing can be more beneficial to her than absolute quiet."</p> 
               <p>The visitor glanced at the wife's face, which had grown thin and haggard in its intense look of entreaty,-more pathetic in its helplessness than any appeal of words.</p> 
               <p>"I think I had better stay, since it seems to disturb her so, to have me go away. She is a little flighty, no doubt; but, 'tis best to humor her."</p> 
               <p>She sat down again; profound silence reigned for about an hour. Suddenly the wife spoke distinctly:</p> 
                
               <p>"Countess Nold, I pray you, do not leave me alone with that man. He has tried to murder me. If I am left in his power, he will succeed."</p> 
               <p>"She is mad," said the Count. "It strikes me now that she confessed to me that there was insanity in her family. This explains all her conduct."</p> 
               <p>"I am perfectly in my right mind. Unless you wish to be an accomplice in a murder, you must not desert me. I warn you."</p> 
               <p>"You see for yourself how absurd are her words. She shuts herself up in her room for the purpose of smothering herself, when I am miles distant on the railway. Mad! mad!"</p> 
               <p>Countess Nold was bewildered. She stared at the restless husband, who was gnawing his lip with vexation, and at the wife, lying there half dead, but with beseeching eyes that kept themselves upon her face,-thus till the early daylight paled the wax tapers; then she shook the sleepy maid and whispered in her ear strict injunctions not to leave her mistress alone, not even with the Count.</p> 
               <p>Supposing this to relate to her fear that the Countess Konisberg would again attempt suicide, the girl readily promised.</p> 
               <p>For four days the Count kept watch by his wife's bedside; on the fifth, overcome by sleep, he lay on a couch near at hand, when she slipped softly from her room, was speedily dressed by her maid and the Countess Nold, drove to the office of the Prefect of Police, and entered an accusation against her husband, for an attempt upon her life.</p> 
               <p>She stated that, on the evening of the ball, after being dressed, she sent her maid down to dinner, and was beguiling the time with a book, when the Count, quite to her surprise, suddenly appeared in her room. She had not expected him until a later hour. He threw off a large<pb n="54-55" xml:id="VAC8154-00000026"/> travelling cloak, and a cap, as he entered, turning the key in the door. She was glad to see him, as they had never been separated so many days since their marriage; he was in good spirits, complimented her on her toilet, and finally sat down on the arm of her chair, with his arm about her neck, and his handkerchief pressed to her face.</p> 
               <p>"Your handkerchief smells of chloroform," she said.</p> 
               <p>"I had the toothache on those horrid cars," he made answer.</p> 
               <p>"Take it away, dear Karl,-the odor overpowers me!"</p> 
               <p>She testified to a distinct consciousness, that he pressed it closer to her nostrils. She struggled a little; but after that she remembered nothing, until she was aroused from a death-like trance, to hear her attendants talking of her attempts at suicide. She declared that she had never attempted her own life-that she knew nothing of the brazier of charcoal, nor of how it came to be lighted in her apartment-that she had not locked her door-and that it was her belief that Count Konisberg had, in some manner, and for some purpose unknown, plotted the whole affair, so as to murder her in such a manner as to make it appear that she had committed suicide.</p> 
               <p>When she had thus made oath, she went away with the Countess Nold, who gave bail for her appearance as witness, when she should be called to trial. That evening Count Konisberg was in prison, and Paris wild with flying rumors.</p> 
               <p>The accused man soon had a hearing, in which he proved an <foreign xml:lang="LAT">alibi,</foreign> having, at that hour, just alighted from a train, at a station in another part of the city, and the footman testified to having admitted him, after the physician had been summoned. His defence was, that his wife's mind had been affected by the fumes of the charcoal, and that this disturbed vision, when passing into the comatose state, upon coming out of it, appeared to her like reality. It might even be that memory was so affected that she could not recall the motives which urged her to suicide, nor the preparations made to effect it. These motives he attributed to pique, at his having refused her an extravagant gift, which she demanded. He spoke so reasonably, his demeanor towards his wife was so compassionate, his scorn at the idea of attributing such a crime to him, so noble, that not one person in one hundred believed him guilty, and he would have been dismissed without being remanded for farther trial, had not another spider's-web reached out and caught him.</p> 
               <p>A miserable charcoal-vender came forward and testified, that, on the night in question, at about eight o'clock, a tall gentleman in a cloak, with his travelling cap pulled over his eyes, stopped and bought of him a few sous' worth of charcoal, which he wrapped in a fine cambric handkerchief, and stuffed in the pocket of his cloak. That when he came to pay, he had nothing less than a gold-piece, which he, the vender, could not change. The gentleman was in haste, and could not wait, but tossed the piece to him with an oath. He thought it so strange, that this sort of a person should be buying a little charcoal, that he resolved to follow him. It might only be a rich Englishman, who wanted a little fire in his apartments; or, the gentleman might have been crossed in love, or have failed in business. At least, he would see all he could of him. He ran after him, keeping a safe distance, through several <emph>passages,</emph> until he emerged in a little alley-way, back of the Hotel Konisberg,-he knew the spot well, and was entirely certain it was the Hotel Konisberg. The man in the cloak admitted himself, by a key, through the little gate of the court; and the vender was about to retire, vexed at his own indiscretion, in running so far from his business, when, looking up, he saw<pb n="56-57" xml:id="VAC8154-00000027"/> the gentleman on the narrow iron balcony, which ran below the windows on the second story. How he got there, unless he climbed the lightning-rod, he could not say,-but there he was, and, after listening at one of the windows, about three minutes, he threw it up, and crept in, softly shutting it after himself. The witness could swear to the time, for, at that instant, a bell in a church near by, struck eight. Apprehensive that a robber had got access to the hotel, he wished to give the alarm; yet, thinking how ridiculous he should make himself, if that were only an ordinary way for some of the inmates to enter the house-(there might be steps to the balcony, for all he knew,-the wall hid the lower story from his sight) he trotted back to his shop, well pleased with his gold-piece. He swore that in stature, and the color of his beard, this person resembled the prisoner, and that he fully believed the Count and this man, to be one and the same.</p> 
               <p>This unexpected testimony, turned the tide of popular feeling against Count Konisberg. It was considered necessary to hold him for further trial, and he was returned to prison. That night, by some mysterious aid, he escaped from the window of his cell, and was never re-arrested, although the police searched every corner of France, Germany, and England. His flight, of course, confirmed his guilt. An after-examination of the lock of the door of the Countess' bed-chamber, made it evident that it had been tampered with. The <foreign xml:lang="LAT">alibi</foreign> was not so powerful a point in his favor, since the railway-time, being slightly in advance of the city clocks, by great haste, he might have accomplished the distance to his hotel by eight o'clock. It was the settled theory, that he had obtained access to his own house through a rear window, watched for the descent of the servants to dinner, gained his wife's apartments, rendered her insensible with chloroform, kindled the charcoal, and retreating, fastened the lock by means of a nipper, left the house the way he came, hastened back towards the station by some obscure route, and was driven up to the front of his hotel, at the moment when he hoped her death was accomplished. The early arrival of Countess Nold had alone thwarted him. Afterwards, he had not dared consummate what he began, even when his wife was in his power, her assertions to her friend having laid him open to suspicion.</p> 
               <p>"What could have been his motive?" queried Mr. Cameron, as the voice of the story-teller ceased, and the lapse of the river became audible.</p> 
               <p>"It is my belief, that he had coldly resolved to get rid of her, before he took her, a trusting bride, to his breast. He wanted her vast possessions, to which he would have become heir at her death. He was not averse to please himself with her beauty, for a time; but, her's was not a family which he wished to ally with his own blood, and before any children should come to blend the races, he would free himself from her."</p> 
               <p>"If <emph>you</emph> had not told us, Louis, we should not have given credit to so horrible a story. For my part, I think such wickedness is very rare in this world," and she slipped her hand into his, as if to reassure herself of the reality of <emph>her</emph> love and lover:-how glad she was that she was only Lissa Cameron, with a poor German tutor for her future husband, and not that unfortunate Countess Konisberg!</p> 
               <p>"What became of the Countess?" asked Milla, a tear dropping on her cheek.</p> 
               <p>"You remember that I left the old country that winter. I have never heard the particulars, but I believe she went home to her father."</p> 
               <p>"Thank goodness the hateful wretch got none of the<pb n="58-59" xml:id="VAC8154-00000028"/> money he married her for," muttered Robbie, his wide-dilated eye still fixed on the face of the narrator, which he alone could distinctly see, as the moonlight touched it with a pale finger.</p> 
               <p>"He got nothing-not even the remnants of his own fortune. It was the most desperate game he ever played,-and he lost it-as he deserved!"-bringing his teeth together with a vicious snap, which would have taken off Count Konisberg's head, had it been between them.</p> 
               <p>"How could you ever have been so deceived in him?" asked Mrs. Cameron.</p> 
               <p>Dassel rose from his chair, drawing himself up with a disdainful gesture, which he sometimes made-</p> 
               <p>"Do you suppose any one person ever knew another?" was his counter-question. "We should pass our days in a state of mutual amazement, if we all had windows in our bosoms-But I must go. I hear the distant thunder of the train. Bettine, I shall be here in the afternoon, tomorrow, to say good-bye for some days. Milla, take care of those jewels! There may be some wicked Counts around. Don't dream of the one I've been telling you of. Mr. Cameron, it is hardly safe to have so much property in a country-house like this,-and you have not even a watchdog."</p> 
               <p>"It will be all right to-night, since no one knows of our having it; and to-morrow, I propose, either to bring home a safe, or to deposit the jewels in the one I have."</p> 
               <p>"Oh, papa, I'd like to sleep with them under my pillow, one night!"</p> 
               <p>"Well, Milla, I think they would be in no danger there. You'll have to cut short those private adieus, my children, unless Louis will stay with us to-night."</p> 
               <p>"I ought not, this time, as I have business, early in the morning. Good-night. Good-night, all! God be with you!" he cried, in his affectionate German way, as he waved his hand, dashed down the lawn, and ran to meet the fiery monster, which, spouting flame and smoke, came bellowing out of the hills, pausing, one moment, at the little station near by, before it dashed on again with renewed fury, filling the peaceful moonlight with its discordant clamor.</p> 
               <p>"Louis is whisked away like some fallen spirit, in the grasp of old Nick! See him, Lissa! how he disappears in fire and brimstone!"</p> 
               <p>"You make me shudder, Robbie. What a disagreeable fancy! I always like to watch the trains go whirling away into darkness. See, Milla! how the vapor catches the moonlight. Beautiful!"</p> 
               <p>"The vapor-that is a woman's soul, and aspires to heaven," said Robbie.-"Let us call <emph>that</emph> Countess Margaret. But that hideous engine, panting forward, snorting fire from its nostrils, driven by flaming fiends,-<emph>that</emph> is Count Konisberg,-and I wish we had seen the last of him!"</p>

               <head>CHAPTER IV.</head> 
               <head type="sub">MRS. GRIZZLE.</head> 
               <p>THE next morning, as Robbie Cameron was walking up and down a shaded passage in the garden, Greek grammar in hand, thinking, not of his verbs, but of Count Konisberg and his sister Lissa's German lover, he heard a voice not new to him, entreating him, through the hedge-</p> 
               <p>"Robbie! Robbie Cameron!"</p> 
               <p>At first he affected not to hear, but the weakness of boy-nature when misled by feminine beguilement finally asserted itself, and with much outward dignity, and much inward curiosity, Robbie walked leisurely to that broken spot in the green wall which had witnessed such interviews before. A little lady was there, her short <foreign xml:lang="FRA">pique</foreign> frock somewhat limp from too early contact with dewy rose-bushes, her hair curled to a nicety and tied with blue ribbons, and her eager face thrust over the hedge full of the purpose to "tell tales out of school." As he looked at her he reflected that Susie Grizzle really would be pretty if she did not freckle. With handsome hair, bright hazel eyes, and a "cunning" mouth, the traces of plebeian parentage had been as it were painted over with French polish, by a Parisian dressing-maid, and lights and shades flung in by a French governess. She was a new-found rose grafted on hardy stock.</p> 
               <p>"Good-morning, Miss Susie. Were you calling me?"</p> 
               <p>"You know I've been calling you, Master Cameron, the last half hour."</p> 
                
               <p>"Not quite so long as that, Mademoiselle Grizzle."</p> 
               <p>"You needn't call me Grizzle, if you please. You know it's not a pretty name like yours, and you mean to tease me. But, there's one comfort, Master Cameron;-I can change it when I get a little older!"</p> 
               <p>"Ah! and how soon do you propose to change it?"</p> 
               <p>"Well, I should say in about five years. I'm eleven, now, you know; I shall be sixteen then, and pa ran away with ma when <emph>she</emph> was only seventeen. How old will you be then, Robbie?"</p> 
               <p>"Not quite twenty,-altogether too young for one to marry."</p> 
               <p>"Oh, dear!" with a little sigh, "then you and I can't run away together. It'll be quite a disappointment to me, for you live so <emph>convenient,</emph> you see! We might have taken brother Sam's yacht, and gone over to Paris, or somewhere.-But, I wanted to tell you something! Mamma's going to give a <foreign xml:lang="FRA">fte champtre,</foreign> before we go to Newport."</p> 
               <p>"Is she?"</p> 
               <p>"Yes. She promised Sam, last night. It will be <emph>such</emph> fun! A band on the lawn, and a tent, and every thing. The best of it is <emph>you</emph> can come, Robbie, as it's in the daytime, and I'm going to be around. I shall have mamma invite you."</p> 
               <p>"Don't trouble yourself, Susie," said the boy, not at all averse to the prospect of dancing and feasting with his elders; "and please don't tell me any thing about it, which you ought not. It will be time enough for us to know it when we get our invitations."</p> 
               <p>"I shan't say a word, since you're so particular about listening;-only Sam coaxed mother into it. He said he didn't believe Miss Cameron cared much for the flute; he wasn't intimate enough to ask her to take a sail in his yacht, and if he had to go off to Newport without making any more head-way, he should feel like drowning himself."</p> 
               <pb n="62-63" xml:id="VAC8154-00000030"/> 
               <p>"Hush, Susie," remonstrated Robbie, but without moving from the vicinity of such dangerous confidences.</p> 
               <p>"Do you think the <foreign xml:lang="FRA">fte champtre</foreign> will do any good?" she asked, slily.</p> 
               <p>"How?"</p> 
               <p>"O, in catching your sister, you know."</p> 
               <p>"I hardly think it will."</p> 
               <p>"Sam dances the German <emph>real</emph> well. He's good, too, Sam is. He brought me a box of <foreign xml:lang="FRA">bon-bons,</foreign> and such a pretty croquet set yesterday. If you'll come over and play croquet this afternoon, I will give you what is left of the <foreign xml:lang="FRA">bon-bons.</foreign> I wish Miss Lissa would take to Sam. I'd be your sister-in-law, then, you see."</p> 
               <p>"I don't see it," said Robbie.</p> 
               <p>"Ma says she's going to be sure and invite all the nabobs."</p> 
               <p>"Perhaps she'd better leave us out, then: we are not in that category."</p> 
               <p>"No, indeed. Pa says he shouldn't wonder if some of your rank relations in Scotland had died, and left you a big thing."</p> 
               <p>"Our what?"</p> 
               <p>"Your rank relations-lords, or something of that kind. He's going to ask your papa, before the company, how many thousand pounds it was."</p> 
               <p>"Susie, your maid is coming after you."</p> 
               <p>"I wish she'd stay away. Well, good-bye, Robbie. Come and play croquet. Ma's coming over to ask your family, before she sends out her cards-for it's made a-purpose to please your sister. Don't tell her. Oh, dear, it's so funny to see Sam look at the moon and groan. When he was howling on his flute last evening, I came out and pretended I thought it was our watch-dog. That shut him up. He don't know much about music, and Madame Flambeau always stuffs cotton in her ears when he begins to play.-Madame wants me, does she?-I was asking Master Cameron to come over and play croquet," and jumping down from the low stone wall which edged the hedge, Susie's blue ribbons and embroidery disappeared at one flash.</p> 
               <p>Mrs. Grizzle had indeed concluded to signalize the closing of her house for a tour of the watering-places by a <foreign xml:lang="FRA">fte champtre,</foreign> which should rival every thing since the celebrated entertainment given to the Prince of Great-Gundom by a lady of note not a thousand miles from that very vicinity. The neighborhood surrounding the little <foreign xml:lang="FRA">dpt</foreign> of Evergreen-where the Bulbouses, Grizzles, Camerons, etc., daily took and left the train-was a distinguished one in its own opinion, boasting of more great men, within a radius of two miles, than was common to any one suburban settlement. On a conspicuous height, quite back from the river, gleamed the white marble mansion of the Great-American-Mixed Co. So great were the profits on the "Mixed,"-the result of an ingenious machine for turning genuine coffee-berries out of dough, as well as of a faithful cultivation of chiccory, and the employment of an Agent to keep a sharp look-out for cargoes of damaged stock,-that the daughter of said Company drove a four-in-hand down to the train, every fair evening, the mountings of whose harness were believed to be of solid gold. The ebony coachman by her side, was set off with mother-of-pearl buttons to that extent that he looked like an inlaid Japanese tea-caddy on a large scale. The very carriage shone as if it had been japanned; and the delicate basket-work on the door-panels, reminded one of the cool bamboo of the Orient-in this western land degenerated into cool bamboozlement.</p> 
               <p>A little to the right of the white marble mansion,-on<pb n="64-65" xml:id="VAC8154-00000031"/> whose lawn, by-the-way, glittered a real Chinese pagoda, bells and all, the model of which was copied from a blue earthen jar on the counter of the Great-American-Mixed Co.,-stood a real granite castle, whose stones had been laid, one by one, on a solid foundation of washing-machines, which may not have seemed adequate to so great a weight, but which were certainly not as <q>
                     <l>"baseless as the fabric of a vision,"</l>
                  </q> and whose frowning battlements looked coldly down on such poor mortals as still were "in the suds" of honest toil.</p> 
               <p>To the left was a spacious brick villa in the Italian style, the result not of the sweets but the sours of prosperity. Its owner had pickled cucumbers and other small vegetables, until he had succeeded in preserving rolls of green backs quaintly resembling huge pickles, and some most lovely little pots of "eagles" which were "warranted to keep in any climate." A tomato, <foreign xml:lang="FRA">couchant,</foreign> with a red pepper, <foreign xml:lang="FRA">rampant,</foreign> would have formed a suitable coat-of-arms for this founder of the American republican family of Perigrine Jones; but Jones was not a man of original ideas, and had gone to Ball &amp; Black with a book of Heraldry, open at Jones, and they had arranged for him a very pretty device for his silver-ware, stolen from the most ancient of the App-Johns of Wales. <emph>His</emph> coachman was a smart Irishman in an olive-green suit, with walnut-brown bands, and a cockade on his hat resembling pickled cauliflower. In fact the coachman's whole face looked like a pot of "assorted."</p> 
               <p>It was the one remaining anxiety of Mrs. Grizzle's life, that, as yet, her family was not provided with its coat-of-arms. Her servants all were in livery, from the big-breasted butler down to the ebon page who held up her train when she walked out of a morning among the flowers, asking the gardener their names, and blooming, herself, like a "beautiful ful, full-fleshed peony," as some Swinburne-mad poet hath it. Often and often she had besought her husband "to have the thing done;" she could not bear to be driving about with all those nabobs (a favorite word of hers, she using it in good faith, for the very impressiveness of the sound), and getting out at Stewart's with the clerks putting parcels in the carriage, and no coat-of-arms to distinguish them-by <emph>them,</emph> meaning not the clerks, nor the parcels, but the Grizzles. Grizzle was not quite a fool, and was something of a wag. In answer to his wife's importunities he had devised various original designs, drawn in his diary, with his pencil, which he offered for her inspection. We will give one of these as a specimen:-"<hi rend="i"/>Sheild oval, feild argent, a platter; <hi rend="i"/>charge, a sucking-pig, dormant; an ear of corn in its mouth, <hi rend="i"/>garb; 'whom the gods love die young,' <hi rend="i"/>motto." Mrs. Grizzle resented this reminder of the shop with an asperity quite contrary to her usual good-nature.</p> 
               <p>Mr. and Mrs. Grizzle never had quarrelled; if that unhappiness was yet in store for them it would be due, solely, to a difference of opinion upon coats-of-arms. So sensitive had Mrs. Grizzle grown on the subject of the shop-as "<hi rend="i"/>he" persisted in calling it-that, had she read the last sentence of ours and seen used the expressions "<hi rend="i"/>in store for them," and "it would be <hi rend="i"/>due," she would have recoiled from them on account of their business-like flavor. Grizzle, though sufficiently purse-proud and vain of his rapidly-acquired splendors, had not her delicacy in ignoring the source from whence all their prosperity had emanated.</p> 
               <p>But to return to the <foreign xml:lang="FRA">fte champtre.</foreign>
               </p> 
               <p>Mr. Dassel had found that the firm were anxious to have him start the evening of that day for St. Louis, and he was in the midst of his adieus, just having kissed a tear from Lissa's cheek, when the sound of the door-bell warned them to recall their "company looks."</p> 
               <pb n="66-67" xml:id="VAC8154-00000032"/> 
               <p>"Now do stay," cried Milla, as the pair began a retreat towards the library.-"You've half-an-hour yet, Louis, and it's only Mrs. Grizzle, our nearest neighbor. I saw her coming up the walk. She'll not stay over ten minutes, I presume, and I shall like you to meet and appreciate a genuine representative of our great and glorious-"</p> 
               <p>"Stay, children," said Mrs. Cameron; and with that "wonderful instinct of self-preservation" which enables us to draw in our hearts like snails in a shell when observers approach too near, the agitated lovers were as composed-sitting demurely on the opposite sides of the room when the visitor entered-as if this were their first appearance together on the stage.</p> 
               <p>"My! ain't it hot?" panted the lady, who was as round and rosy as her husband, but on a larger scale. "I'm so accustomed to be driven when I go anywhere, that, even this short walk has almost melted me. What pretty young ladies yours are, Mrs. Cameron. I declare I don't wonder Sam's allers talking of them. He's quite taken with one of them," she said, with a motherly smile at Elizabeth, who blushed slightly, although she looked very much amused.</p> 
               <p>"I wish my eldest was a girl instead of a boy; for then she could be some help to me in entertainin' comp'ny. Sam's desperate fond of comp'ny; he will have me invite lots of it to the house; but, he ain't no more use in helpin' git along with it than a chair. Girls would be different. Howsumever, as he's old enough to marry now, p'raps I'll have a daughter-in-law some of these days."</p> 
               <p>"I trust you may, Madame," answered Lissa, politely, as the remark seemed to be addressed to her.</p> 
               <p>"He's all alive now about an out-door party,-a sort of to-home pic-nic, I should call it. He wants me to have one, next week; but he said he shouldn't enjoy it one bit if your whole family, Mrs. Cameron, did not come. So I've run over, without ceremony, to beg you to promise."</p> 
                
               <p>"Thank you, I know of nothing, now, which will prevent our accepting," answered Mrs. Cameron.</p> 
               <p>"Then we'll have out the cards to-morrow, for Thursday of next week. Sam'll be delighted." Mrs. Grizzle was sitting on the same sofa with Milla, towards whom she now bent, whispering:</p> 
               <p>"Who is that distinguished looking gentleman? Is it any body I ought to invite, to come with your family?"</p> 
               <p>"Oh, that's my brother's tutor," said Milla, brimming with mischief.</p> 
               <p>"Oh-ah! that's what gives him a foreign look, I s'pose? Of course you wouldn't wish me to ask <emph>him?</emph>"</p> 
               <p>"I don't think he would come, if you did. He does not have much respect for us Americans. He was a Baron in his own country, but when he fled from it for having offended the Austrian government, he dropped his title. He thinks titles out of place here. Why, madame, he's as familiar with the Emperor Napoleon and the Empress Eugenie, as we are with our neighbors!"</p> 
               <p>"How you talk!" stealing an awe-stricken look across the room. "I wish you'd introduce me. I should feel <emph>so</emph> honored to have him at my shampeter."</p> 
               <p>"He would be compelled to decline, as he leaves for St. Louis this evening. I dare say you'll meet him at some future time, as he is often at our house."</p> 
               <p>But, Mrs. Grizzle was not going to be in the same room with a live Baron, and not have the pleasure of his acquaintance; she asked, aloud, for an introduction, and Mrs. Cameron performed that ceremony.</p> 
               <p>"I'm <emph>so</emph> sorry not to have you at our shampeter. I know Sam would be dreadfully pleased, and I'm sure I should, Mr. Dassel. Law! I think it's a false delicacy on your part, to drop your title, sir, which Miss Milla says is that of a Baron. If you was to come to my shampeter, I should<pb n="68-69" xml:id="VAC8154-00000033"/> call you 'Baron' whenever I spoke to you. Comes hard on you, teachin' for a livin', don't it, after being accustomed to foreign courts?"-the lady beamed all over with a tender benevolence as she smiled at Dassel, who was regarding her with a helpless surprise.</p> 
               <p>Poor little Milla was frightened at the result of her mischievous communication; she plucked the visitor by her sleeve, whispering-</p> 
               <p>"Robbie is his only pupil, Mrs. Grizzle. He instructs him, as a favor. His business is that of a foreign correspondent."</p> 
               <p>"Ah, yes," replied Mrs. Grizzle, shaking her head mysteriously, "that's diplomacy, I know. There was a friend of ours went to Siberia, or somewhere, as a diplomatic corpse. Quite an honor!"-then she added, again beaming upon 'the Baron'-"I beg ten thousand pardons for mistaking your vocation, Baron. Miss Milla has just set me right. She informs me you're an embassador, which I am sure is no more than the country ought to do for distinguished foreigners driven to our arms, which are ever open, by the persecutions of kings and such. We're all democrats here, Baron; every man and every woman may be a king and a queen if they like, and every boy a president. That's what I call the real democratic principle; though what people run away from kings for, I never could make out. <emph>I've</emph> always had a curiosity to see one. You'll find we Americans ready to pay you proper respect, Baron. It's what our society wants. A little suffusion of the genuine nobility, just to give it an air, you know."</p> 
               <p>"Ah, madame, you are too modest! Your society is perfect, as it is. Could a title add to <emph>your</emph> position, for instance, Mrs. Grizzle?"</p> 
               <p>"Mrs. Grizzle flushed still rosier with delight. "Flattery, Baron, pure flattery! but, they say that courts are addicted to it. How fortunate you are, to have such a tutor for Robbie, Mrs. Cameron! I wish Sam enjoyed such advantages. Sam's young yet, and would bear improving. He hain't no confidence in his own powers. If I wasn't afraid you'd take it as an insult, Baron Dassel, I'd make a proposition for you to include our Sam with your other pupil."</p> 
               <p>"What terms would you propose, madame?"</p> 
               <p>"La, I'd leave it entirely to <emph>you.</emph> We don't mind money, sir. I'd give you a home in our house, with the best we had, and such a salary as you might fix,-just to overlook his manners, you know, and his French, a little. I don't care about his worrying with any thing hard."</p> 
               <p>"He could teach him military science and civil engineering, boxing, fencing, drawing, music, including all manner of instruments, half-a-dozen languages, mathematics complete, yatching, a taste for the fine arts, belle-lettres, how to hold up his shoulders, and what to do with his hands," cried Milla, laughing, for the presence of Mrs. Grizzle had excited all her wickedness,-"that is a part of a list of an European gentleman's accomplishments."</p> 
               <p>"Gracious goodness! Sam 'll never be equal to them, my dear! no, not half of them! But, I'm ture I wish he could learn what to do with his hands, for they cause him a great deal of trouble in comp'ny."</p> 
               <p>"I'll consider your proposition, during my absence, madame, and give you an answer upon my return," said Louis.</p> 
               <p>Lissa looked up at him in surprise. Their wedding was to take place some time in September. She thought Louis must be carrying on Milla's jest, but, as his eyes did not meet hers, she could not tell whether, or not, he had spoken in earnest.</p> 
               <p>"Sam would be quite set up, if he could learn to handle<pb n="70-71" xml:id="VAC8154-00000034"/> his yacht," continued the fond mother, "for he gets knocked down every time he tries her, with the boom, I think he calls it. He was knocked overboard, senseless, the last time, and dragged out by the hair of his head. He keeps a mate a-purpose to sail her, but he's a powerful ambition to manage her himself.-Well, well, I must be goin'. I'd put my shampeter off, Baron, if we hadn't got rooms engaged at Newport for the first of July. Now, recollect, Mrs. Cameron, I want you to bring the hull of your delightful family. You've <emph>such</emph> sweet girls! I'm sure they'll be the belles of the shampeter, and Susie charged me to be partikeler about Robbie. She'll pout and spoil every thing, if he don't come, for when the child's crossed, she'll cut up all kinds o' tricks."</p> 
               <p>Mrs. Grizzle could not get away without shaking hands with "the Baron."</p> 
               <p>"Good Lord!" sighed Louis, when the door actually had closed upon her. "And you really consented to visit her, my dear lady?"</p> 
               <p>"How could I avoid it, Mr. Dassel? They are our neighbors, and it will be more comfortable to be decently civil to them. They cannot harm us; and, really, there will be a great many good people at that 'shampeter,' I have no doubt. It is our way."</p> 
               <p>"I believe I'll emigrate to the Rocky Mountains."</p> 
               <p>"They are no longer out of the world," said Lissa. "There are gold-diggers there, who have set up their carriages, no doubt."</p> 
               <p>"Alas, ladies, I must say farewell. What, Bettine, my darling; tears? I promise you a letter every other day."</p> 
               <p>He turned to Milla, whose lip, also, was trembling, bestowing the kiss of a brother on her flower-like cheek. As he did so, he looked full into her eyes, down, down into her foolish heart, his own glance melting and dazzling, whispering too softly for any ears but her own to catch the tender modulation:-</p> 
               <p>"Does my sweet Milla, too, grieve for Louis' going away?" She sat thrilled and mute, until after he was gone; and when Lissa, who had followed him to the porch, and watched until the train took him up, came in and ran up-stairs to hide her tears, Milla did not follow to comfort her. Drooping down on the corner of the sofa, her mother thought her asleep, and stole away to dress for dinner; but, when the young girl found herself alone, a strange change came over her. She lifted a face white and set, with a look upon it painfully different from its usual infantile brightness. Crossing the room, she stood before the tall mirror, and gathering up her veil of silken hair, gazed fiercely at the blemish which marred her otherwise exceeding loveliness.</p> 
               <p>"No one-no one-no one will ever love <emph>me!</emph> I wish I were dead! I believe I will kill myself."</p> 
               <p>"Now jus' listen to my purty chile!" said a voice at the door. Milla let fall her glistening hair, turning hastily to confront old Sabrina, the black nurse who had taken care of her since her birth, and who, coming to look after her darling, being never easy about her unless she knew just where she was, stood rolling her great eyes in terror at the sad scene she had witnessed.</p> 
               <p>"You naughty, naughty chile! Why, bress you, Miss Milla, dar nebber <emph>was</emph> any body lubbed so much as you. Fadder, mudder, ebery body, down to poor ole black Sabrina, lubs de berry yerth you trods on."</p> 
               <p>"They <emph>pity</emph> me, nursie."</p> 
               <p>"Chile! chile! Now, don' go and be ungrateful. Why, nobody eber seed you, darlin', dat didn't love you de minit dey sot eyes on you."</p> 
               <p>"Oh, Sabrina! I'm miserable, after all," said Milla, with a sob that was more like a gasp; "and I know that, as I grow older, I shall grow more miserable."</p> 
               <pb n="72-73" xml:id="VAC8154-00000035"/> 
               <p>"Dar, dar, dar, honey! does you want to break my heart?" cried the old nurse, lifting Milla in her arms, as if she were a baby, and walking about the floor with her.</p> 
               <p>For sixteen years she had carried this precious burden, which still seemed as light to her as in its childhood. Milla's spine was weak, and whenever she was tired, Sabrina insisted upon carrying her up and down stairs, as staircases were the invalid's dread. The child always had enjoyed being carried about in those strong, loving arms; but now, every thing of the kind seemed to vex and mortify her.</p> 
               <p>"Set me down, nurse; you treat me as if I were a baby."</p> 
               <p>"I shan't an' I can't, till I take yer safe to yer own purty room. Yer white an' tired, and you mus' lay down an' rest, or, what'll yer papa say?" and she bore Milla away to her soft couch in a cool chamber, where she patted her hair and smoothed it as she said-</p> 
               <p>"Now, if ever you feels bad, and don't want to tell nobody else, jes' you talk to old Sabrina 'bout yer troubles, and she'll keep 'em fast fer yer."</p> 
               <p>It was well for Elizabeth that she had Mrs. Grizzle's <foreign xml:lang="FRA">fte champtre</foreign> with which to amuse herself, during the first days of Louis' absence. She missed him more than she would like to acknowledge. He had been so constant a visitor, that the whole family felt his loss; he always was an entertaining guest, as welcome at a dinner-table as the salad or the wine which gives <emph>zest</emph> to the whole repast; and nobody laughed at Lissa for a little gravity of demeanor, who told none but Milla, and her not without blushes, how lonely she was without Louis.</p> 
               <p>"You must busy yourself with your <foreign xml:lang="FRA">trousseau,</foreign> sister. You have but a few weeks, really. See! I have hemmed a dozen yards of cobweb cambric, and sewed on this valenciennes lace, as one of <emph>my</emph> contributions."</p> 
                
               <p>"Thank you, Milla; but you must not sew. It is not good for you."</p> 
               <p>"Nothing is good for me; but I must pass away the time,-yes, all the long hours, days, and years. How dreary!"</p> 
               <p>"Why, darling, how sad you seem! what's the matter?"</p> 
               <p>"Nothing, Lissa."</p> 
               <p>"Did mamma tell you she is to take you to Newport, for a few weeks of ocean-bathing? We all think you are so pale and languid; the hot weather does not agree with you. Papa says he has the money necessary, and it must be spent in that way."</p> 
               <p>"But, you will need all the money this season, Lissa."</p> 
               <p>"No, indeed, sis; I'd rather be married in white muslin, without even a veil, than to see you looking so white."</p> 
               <p>"But you shall be dressed splendidly. I've set my heart on your wearing the diamonds. If I cannot give them to you, I can loan them, for you to wear until I am of age. Of what use are they, shut up in a safe? Louis is so proud. He would like, above all things, to have you appear well, Elizabeth. And when you are a wife, jewels will become you. Your skin is so creamy, and your hair so dark! You've a stately turn of the neck, too, Lissa, that will enhance the beauty of a necklace."</p> 
               <p>"Quite a list of attractions! You're a loving little creature, Milla, and quite too generous," throwing down her work to kiss her. "Perhaps, at some grand reception, I may borrow your splendors for a night."</p> 
               <p>"You should honor the 'shampeter' with them."</p> 
               <p>Both girls laughed, as the ridiculous remembrance of Mrs. Grizzle's visit recurred to them. She had 'run over' two or three times, to consult them about the tent for the collation, the temporary floor for dancing, the music, the banners, the lamps, the flowers, and every other possible<pb n="74-75" xml:id="VAC8154-00000036"/> thing, until Mrs. Cameron had almost regretted her promise to attend, which had afforded an opening for so sudden an intimacy. The discreet mother had employed 'Sam,' also, to convey some of these messages, who had come over 'dressed to fits,' no matter what the hour of the day, blushing and gnawing the end of his gloves, so sun-struck by the full effulgence of Miss Cameron's beauty, when brought near to it, as to be rendered almost insensible of what he was doing or what he had been sent to do.</p> 
               <p>"By hokey, mother, I'd marry her, if she hadn't a red cent, if I could git her," he burst forth, after one of these occasions. "She's too nice for me, that's a fact, if feyther <emph>has</emph> got the biggest house. I'm sorry you told me about the Baron. Girls always take to any thing of that kind. It makes me burst all out in a sweat when I think of it. I didn't half sleep last night."</p> 
               <p>"Pshaw, Sammy, I reckon you can have your own now, when you get a fair chance. Miss Cameron is not insensible to the advantages of wealth. And if she should be, you'd make more by taking Miss Bulbous; her dad's full as rich-"</p> 
               <p>"Now, mother, don't say 'dad.' Them fellers I'm getting intimate with, laughed at me for it."</p> 
               <p>"I know I hadn't oughter, Sam, but it's hard to teach old dogs new tricks. I sometimes wish we was back in our own little room, behind the grocery-store. I used to take downright comfort in those days. My work was right to my hand; and if I wanted to speak to your dad-"</p> 
               <p>"Dad, again!"</p> 
               <p>"I had only to open the door into the shop. When I seen ladies then, sweeping by in their coaches and horses, with a footman standin' on behind like a guard thrown out in time o' war, I used to think how happy they must be. But, to tell you in confidence, Sam, I aint a bit happier than I was then. I sometimes think, when we set down to our grand dinner with all them waiters watchin' every motion, that I'd fling them all into the fire for the privilege of settin' down at our old table with its brown cloth, and stickin' my own fork into the pickles. A good old-fashioned dish o' pork and beans would quite give me an appetite,-with your-d-father to help me, and not an impudent waiter to look on and count how many mouthfuls I took."</p> 
               <p>Mrs. Grizzle sighed and smoothed the folds of her moire-antique, lost in pleasant reminiscences of past dishes of cold pork, with a herring for a relish, when she was rudely recalled to her present state of oppressive magnificence by the bottle-green servant, who informed her that the carpenter awaited her orders as to the exact location of the floor for dancin."</p>

               <head>CHAPTER V.</head> 
               <head type="sub">MRS. GRIZZLE'S FETE CHAMPETRE.</head> 
               <p>THERE were a good many people anxious about the weather for a day or two preceding <emph>the</emph> Thursday-young folks, fond of dancing in the open air, and old folks curious to criticise their neighbors and burning to know what Mrs. Grizzle had in store for them. On Wednesday the wind blew in gusts, whirling the dust everywhere; it rained, hailed, thundered, "lightened," and-cleared off.</p> 
               <p>Nature, impressed with a realizing sense of the importance of behaving itself at Mrs. Grizzle's <foreign xml:lang="FRA">fte champtre,</foreign> was the first to arrive, in her most smiling mood, and her best dress, which she had washed and done up the previous day. All blue and green and gold, and wreathed with roses, she was perfectly bewitching.</p> 
               <p>The very day insured success. Think not, cold critic, that all the guests were of the Grizzle pattern. Had you been there you would have surrendered, at once, a willing prisoner to the charms of fifty pretty girls, as delicate, as lady-like and more beautiful than any old-world court could show. American women are graceful and piquant by nature, with that superior beauty which springs from a communicative intelligence with freedom of action and sympathy. Our girls are not lay-figures. They know "what they are about;" and they generally are "about" something spirited and sensible. To the delicate grace peculiar even to many of the uneducated, one generation of culture, insures a refinement quite surprising.</p> 
                
               <p>It is not, therefore, to be doubted, that the two handsome creatures, who came down from the heights of the blue-stone castle, already ignored, in their manners and minds, the washing-machines. They were lovable girls, with whom Elizabeth Cameron had a friendly acquaintance. Miss Jones was a little "fast," but not fatally so; and, as she was sharp as tapsicum, making "pickalilly" of the whole company by cutting them all up with the trenchant chopping-knife of her wit, she was a great favorite with all who enjoyed seeing their acquaintances thus served. She was a dashing young lady, quite in contrast to the waxen Miss Bulbous, whose <foreign xml:lang="FRA">forte</foreign> was "style," of the majestic kind; like maccaroni, she was fair without, hollow within.</p> 
               <p>There was the Doctor's family, very agreeable people; the Minister's ditto; with a great-alas! a <emph>great</emph> many young men, worthless for all purposes but to dance with the girls and drink-shall we call it lemonade? There <emph>was</emph> lemonade, but that was not what the young gentlemen drank between the pauses of the music.</p> 
               <p>The music was the very best which Dodworth could furnish. It was a pleasure to Mrs. Cameron, to sit quietly under a tree listening to that delicious flow of melody which seemed to melt into the river and float on with the clouds; and to watch the brilliant groups lighting up the lawn with colorings richer than those of the flowers.</p> 
               <p>And Milla! She sat by her mother's side chatting cheerfully, and making believe to enjoy herself. But, that gay music had entered into her soul, with the message which it brings to youth. Her feet tingled, her restless fingers beat the swift measure; there were hot tears under her eyelids which she would not permit her mother to see.</p> 
               <p>Robbie and Susie were having a gay time to themselves; but Robbie never forgot to come, every little while, to kiss Milla, and to ask her "how she was getting along?" and if "she wouldn't have an ice?"</p> 
               <pb n="78-79" xml:id="VAC8154-00000038"/> 
               <p>How beautiful the dancers looked! how happy they must be! "But, <emph>I</emph> shall never dance," cried Milla, with inward woe.</p> 
               <p>She had grown very tired and silent, when suddenly her face flamed up in a roseate blush of pleasure.</p> 
               <p>"There's Louis, mamma! Would you believe it?"</p> 
               <p>He came up and shook hands with them.</p> 
               <p>"I have been unsuccessful in my expedition," he said, "I convinced myself, in two days, that my cousin was entirely on the wrong track, and as there was nothing to be made by staying, I came back post-haste. I recalled Mrs. Grizzle in time to change my dress before coming out, and here I am. I have paid my respects to her, and laid an injunction upon her using the word 'Baron,' but I can see that she is whispering it about the place. I feel it in the air. Where's Bettine, Madame?"</p> 
               <p>"Dancing with young Mr. Grizzle, I hear," answered the mother. "I will go seek her out, as I do not care to have her betray surprise before others."</p> 
               <p>She walked away towards the dancers, and Dassel took her vacant place near Milla.</p> 
               <p>"I was watching you from a distance," he said, in that tone of mingled protection and affection so powerful with girls of Milla's age. "It grieved me to see you looking so sad. Have you missed me?"</p> 
               <p>"I was thinking how cruel it was to be deprived of the pleasure of dancing," she answered, her eyes upon the ground.</p> 
               <p>"It <emph>is</emph> cruel, Milla, I admit; that is, if you are fond of it. It's tiresome play, however, for me. So, with your permission, I shall devote myself entirely to you. I shall like nothing so well as to sit here."</p> 
               <p>"But Lissa?"</p> 
               <p>"She will excuse me, as I was riding all night in the cars -constantly, in fact, for eight-and-forty hours. Bettine must not be selfish. Somebody must take it upon himself to amuse Mademoiselle Milla."</p> 
               <p>"Oh, they all do that, Louis. Lissa comes every little while to chat with me, and tell me all she sees and hears. They are all too good to me."</p> 
               <p>"Who would not be good to an angel? Don't say that's stereotyped, Milla. You are unlike any woman that ever was made, in your fairy-like loveliness, and sweet, clinging appeals for constant tenderness. When I get to be your brother, child, I shall want nothing to do but tend you."</p> 
               <p>"There are already too many at that work," said she, shaking her head, but her eyes looked into his with a happy smile: for the present, she was content. With Louis by her side, devoting himself to her, she was at peace; the music no longer made her restless, but crept into her consciousness like the odors of the flowers.</p> 
               <p>Elizabeth, deep in the complications of the German, could not run away from her partner, when her mother warned her of Louis' arrival; but the knowledge of his speedy and safe return gave her a joyful expression which Sam Grizzle interpreted to mean pleasure in his society, and the numberless compliments he paid her, all delicate as full blown cabbage-roses, or as the yellow dahlia he begged of her to wear, in her hair, for <emph>him.</emph>
               </p> 
               <p>"Pray, bestow the dahlia on Miss Bulbous; <emph>she</emph> will appreciate it, and it will become her," laughed Elizabeth, softening the blow of her own refusal by insinuating that other fair ones were eager for the favor.</p> 
               <p>And, in truth, many "nice girls" present would have worn dahlias in their hair if it had improved their looks in the eyes of the heir to all this wealth whose evidences they saw about them. The dahlia some time might be converted into diamonds and pearls, if judiciously worn; but Lissa was lacking in this kind of wisdom.</p> 
               <pb n="80-81" xml:id="VAC8154-00000039"/> 
               <p>In the meantime the tender summer-twilight darkened down, and out of it there glimmered a new and peculiar day-a fairy day, such as we imagine hovers about the mid-night banqueting of sprites.</p> 
               <p>Three hundred and sixty-five lamps, according to the bill which Grizzle afterwards paid-one for each day of the year-shone like planets, glowed like globes of fire, beamed like silver moons, turning the Grizzle lawn, garden, and grove into a fairy-like scene, and casting such a halo of enchantment through the soft twilight as utterly to frighten away every rude atmosphere which should seek to remind of the source from which these magical triumphs sprung.</p> 
               <p>Under this tender illumination even Grizzle himself produced a subdued effect, his face losing three shades of color, and his voice not being up to its usual capabilities,-it being one of those voices which invariably made people jump when it addressed them too suddenly, like the sudden opening of the organ-valve. In his white vest and black coat he hopped about from bush to bush, like a dodo, his head on one side, in the intensity of his admiration, about half the time; and the other half, nodding in tune to the merry music, constantly calling on his guests to share in his appreciation of the grand "toot assemble."</p> 
               <p>"I'd no idee it would be so handsome," to Mr. and Mrs. Cameron, who were walking about arm in arm; "it's a reg'lar Fourth o' July."</p> 
               <p>"Very charming, Mr. Grizzle; Mrs. Cameron and myself were just saying how pretty it was."</p> 
               <p>"I never spare no expense, when I once go into a thing. I heard Jones, last year, had three hundred to <emph>his</emph> party, so I ordered sixty-five more. Aint the band beautiful? Makes me feel like leading off with Mrs. Grizzle, as we did in our younger days; but the fact is, Melvina is getting so fat it shakes her up too much. She eats too much pork, I tell her; and speakin' of eating, have you tried the new-fangled salad of Professor Blot's? No? Well, you mustn't forget to try it. I've eat three plates of it already,-tip-top! Lord! aint it enough to make a horse laugh to hear him call himself, <emph>Professor?</emph> I guess I'll set up for a title, too-Professor of Pork-Packing. If Mrs. Grizzle heard me say that, she'd pinch me till I was black and blue; she don't like the business, you see. But, as I tell her, you can't make a silk purse out of a sow's ear.-Ah, ho! here comes our respective representatives, my Sam and your girl. Look well together, don't they? Both 'prime' and about the right weight; a handsome couple, to my notion."</p> 
               <p>"Has the German come to an end, Elizabeth?"</p> 
               <p>"Yes, mamma," looking relieved to get again under the paternal wing. "Where's Milla?"</p> 
               <p>"I left her with Mr. Dassel. He said he was so fatigued with railroad travelling he preferred keeping quiet."</p> 
               <p>"Let's go and git some ice-cream," said Sam, loth to resign his partner.</p> 
               <p>"That's right, Sammy; take good care of your girl," said Grizzle <foreign xml:lang="FRA">pre,</foreign> with a wink at Cameron <foreign xml:lang="FRA">pre.</foreign>
               </p> 
               <p>That wink was more than his guests could tolerate; Mr. Cameron colored a little, and said to Sam that he thought he had seen Miss Bulbous wandering about in a dejected manner; he had better see to it that <emph>she</emph> had an ice.</p> 
               <p>"Miss Bulbous has got plenty of beaux that stick to her like wax," was Sam's reply. "She isn't my style of girl-too much like a tallow candle. There! that's the second pair of gloves I've split open to-night. Don't you feel sorry for my misfortunes, Miss Cameron?" holding up a hand which showed through the rent of his huge lemon-kids like the inside of a watermelon through the split rind.</p> 
               <p>"You should select a higher number," she said, inwardly shuddering.</p> 
               <pb n="82-83" xml:id="VAC8154-00000040"/> 
               <p>"Sho! I took the biggest they had. Come, now, let's go to the tent and get something good. The German gives a fellow an appetite."</p> 
               <p>"I must have a peep at my sister," positively declining the arm which Sam presented to her with a crook meant to be irresistible.</p> 
               <p>Lissa was longing for an opportunity to see and speak with Louis. The very thought of his being so near thrilled her with a joy which made the music the sweetest, the scene the brightest of all sweet and brilliant sounds and sights. There was no blemish upon its perfection, in her eyes. Not even Sam, the great overgrown animated beet, could disturb her. Love's enchanted essence had anointed her eyelids, working over again that wonderful spell, under which young hearts must fall. And oh, Lissa had a heart in which he could try, to the full, his magic powers! Slow to love, chary to bestow the richness of her maiden affections, when once given there was no reserve.</p> 
               <p>The thought that Louis Dassel had asked <emph>her</emph> to be his wife was one of those sweet wonders too incredible to be believed without moments of doubt. Their engagement still was so new a thing, she had not become accustomed to accepting it as a matter of fact. <emph>He,</emph> the noblest, as well as the wisest of men! and she, only a little, loving maiden, quite unworthy of so great an alliance. Such <emph>is</emph> the feminine mood towards the lords of creation; and Elizabeth was not wiser than her great namesake, the queen of women-poets, who sat at the feet of her Robert, and made believe she ought to do <emph>him</emph> homage.</p> 
               <p>No man will find fault with our heroine for this: why disturb the serene dignity of his acquiescence by any questioning comment of ours?</p> 
               <p>In the meantime Mr. Dassel had wrapped a shawl about Milla, and having possessed himself of her little, nestling hand, was quoting Goethe to her in a tone whose rhythm blended well with the other melodies which throbbed about the listening child. She had forgotten her deformity, her discontent of the past two weeks, the dancing,-every thing except Mr. Dassel.</p> 
               <p>"There comes Lissa; you have not yet spoken to her."</p> 
               <p>He finished the three remaining lines of his quotation, kissed her hand, lightly, before dropping it, and rose to meet his betrothed.</p> 
               <p>As soon as she was free from the Grizzles, Elizabeth had come forward eagerly to greet Louis, but something undefinable in his manner blew over her like the air from a snow-cloud, and brought her to a pause, with the color fluctuating on her face. For the life of her she could not have said "<emph>dear</emph> Louis!" as a moment before she meant to say it. Yet, why should she feel so? He shook hands with her, and called her "sweet Bettine;"-it must be that the fear of observation constrained his eye and voice. She was foolish not to know that people in the world must conform to the world's ways, even in the glance of an eye. If they had been on their own rose-scented porch, the smile would have been deep down in the eyes which now had a light, glinting-like frost, in their blueness.</p> 
               <p>While still struggling with her conflicting emotions, Sam Grizzle came again, to beg of them to make two of a party of ten that were going down to the river, for a little trip on the water, to see how the grounds looked from that point of view. There was no possible danger, as they were going out in a row-boat.</p> 
               <p>"I should like it, Mr. Dassel, if you will go with me," said Lissa. "Here's papa coming to take Milla to the dancing."</p> 
               <p>"Perhaps Milla would like to go in the boat."</p> 
               <p>"No, no, Louis, indeed, I am too timid."</p> 
               <pb n="84-85" xml:id="VAC8154-00000041"/> 
               <p>"You need be afraid of nothing where I am; have I not often so assured you, my child? I could dive to the bottom of the Hudson, and fish you up like a pearl, if ill-luck should send you there. Come, little one."</p> 
               <p>He folded her shawl closer about her, tied her hat, gave her his arm, and left Sam to the pleasing task of escorting Miss Elizabeth, who was delighted to have Milla go, under such good protection as that of Mr. Dassel. The elder sister never thought of being sorry to lose her lover's exclusive companionship when Milla was to gain a pleasure.</p> 
               <p>With the usual tittering and screaming among the young ladies, the lovely cargo was at last safely stowed and "trimmed," though not until her escort had to put his arms around Miss Jones to steady her, and Miss Smith had nearly upset the whole party by stepping on the gunwales and then falling into a chaos of three young gentlemen, from whom she was finally extricated, and the equilibrium restored.</p> 
               <p>The rowing was to be done by volunteers. Dassel was as expert at this as he generally was thorough in his accomplishments; he always kept his muscles in good training, and could have pulled the boat unassisted, more successfully than with such aid as he received.</p> 
               <p>"Your oar is as bad as a sexton's story," he said presently, as Grizzle, junior, sent a shower over the ladies by a wonderful back-stroke which acted on the forward progress of the boat very much as a brake.</p> 
               <p>Indeed, if Sam had served an apprenticeship as brakesman on a railway, he could not have worked more heroically to save the whole party from going where they wanted to; whenever he did any thing but dash water on the ladies, it was to reverse the engine, figuratively speaking.</p> 
               <p>"What under the sun and earth is there alike between my rowin' and a sexton's story?" asked he, throwing another shower over the delicate dresses.</p> 
                
               <p>"They both cast a damper over us," suggested Milla.</p> 
               <p>"Do tell? I shouldn't wonder if that was it! I made a pun once myself, Miss Cameron,-'twas considered very good; would you like to hear it?"</p> 
               <p>"By all means, Mr. Grizzle."</p> 
               <p>"Why's my hair like a small specimen of an early spring vegetable? 'Because it can't be <emph>beet?</emph>' Now, Miss Jones, you shut up; because you're so uncommon smart, you won't give none of the rest a fair chance. I declare, now, I've forgot the answer, after all. Because-it's a little-</p> 
               <p>"Green pease?" queried a bright youth, at the stern.</p> 
               <p>"No,-that aint it. I can't recall it now, but they laughed at the time-O, golly, ladies, there's the fireworks going off, and we aint there to see the performance!"</p> 
               <p>"Never mind, Mr. Grizzle. They show very prettily from here."</p> 
               <p>But, in his excitement, the junior host, having thus disappointed some of his guests from beholding the most expensive part of "the show," dropped his oar in the water, and making a sudden lurch to save it, he went over after it-down, down, down to the cold embraces of the North-river mermaids.</p> 
               <p>"He'll become accustomed to it after a season," remarked the youth at the stern. "This is the third time I've seen him perform that feat, this summer. Hush! hush, girls! pray, don't shriek so."</p> 
               <p>"It's no joke, after all," said Dassel. "Can he swim?"</p> 
               <p>"Not a stroke."</p> 
               <p>They gazed, in breathless silence, waiting for him to reappear; the tide was running out and the current strong. When he came up, he was fifteen feet away from the boat, and splashing his arms about wildly.</p> 
               <p>"Shall I rescue the booby?" asked Dassel, in a low voice, of Elizabeth.</p> 
               <pb n="86-87" xml:id="VAC8154-00000042"/> 
               <p>"Think of his mother, Louis."</p> 
               <p>The next moment Dassel was in the river swimming boldly after the drowning man; passing beyond the spot where he last came up, then turning, ready to grasp and uphold him when he should again reappear, he performed that difficult feat with great self-possession.</p> 
               <p>"No, no! I'm not going to spoil the ladies' dresses," he said, as they wished to take him up; "I will hold him with one hand, and on to the boat with the other. I'll soon land my prize."</p> 
               <p>The other gentlemen rowed slowly back, he clinging to the stern; but he had a difficult armful in Sam, who was not so drowned, but that he made a splashing like the stern-wheel of an Ohio-river steamboat.</p> 
               <p>"If you expect to see the conclusion of the fireworks, you will have to give up working your paddles," remonstrated his preserver.</p> 
               <p>"He is probably striking out for Jersey," said some one.</p> 
               <p>"No, not Jersey," pleaded Sam, his mouth full of water, "take me home to ma."</p> 
               <p>They took him home to his ma, the beautiful curls of Barker all washed out of his hair, and only a faint reminiscence of night-blooming cereus clinging to his limp waistcoat and the handkerchief with which he wiped his face, out of which some of the usual crimson had been frightened.</p> 
               <p>"Ho! don't be scared, ma; I just did it a-purpose to see what the girls would say," he laughed, as his mother rushed up to him and flung her arms about his neck; but, Sam looked rather blue in the expiring gleam of the fire-works, and when his father asked what he could do for him, he suggested a "hot sling."</p> 
               <p>"Dassel's just as wet as I be," said the son; "he jumped in after me, though I'm sure he needn't have taken the trouble. I was just in fun."</p> 
                
               <p>"Then I'm sorry I disturbed you," said the urbane Louis.</p> 
               <p>"Oh, goodness gracious me! that ever you should have got yourself in such a fix from coming to my <hi rend="i"/>shampeter," cried the hostess, for the first time perceiving that her noble-her <emph>only</emph> noble guest, was dripping like a common water-cart. "I shall never forgive myself,-nor Sam, neither, the awkward fellow,-and I'll never forget that his life was saved by a Baron. It's an honor that we didn't hope for; and I assure you, we shall appreciate it to the utmost, and I trust, Sammy, you'll learn a lesson and take pattern after this distinguished predecessor. Don't fret about your clothes, Baron; they shall be replaced."</p> 
               <p>"They shall. I will give you, to-morrow, an order on my tailor," exclaimed Grizzle, senior. "In the meantime, would it be possible for you to wear a suit of mine? my best?"</p> 
               <p>"Really, I should say it would <emph>not</emph> be possible," replied Dassel, looking down upon his "roly-poly" host, with a queer smile.</p> 
               <p>"We can provide for his necessities," said Mr. Cameron; "and, as it is now late, and Mr. Dassel is chilly, we will bid you an immediate good-night. We have had a charming evening."</p> 
               <p>"But we're going to have another supper and some more fireworks."</p> 
               <p>"!You are very kind; we will steal away, and shall not be missed. Good-night."</p> 
               <p>"<foreign xml:lang="FRA">Ciel!</foreign>" murmured Louis between his chattering teeth as he accompanied the Camerons home; "that will be supper the third, with the refreshment marque thrown in. Is it, then, your custom?"</p> 
               <p>"Nay, but there be those who in the plentitude of their affluence and the poverty of their experience, have an<pb n="88-89" xml:id="VAC8154-00000043"/> ambition to provide liberally. The <emph>cost</emph> of this <foreign xml:lang="FRA">fte</foreign> will be something to boast of."</p> 
               <p>"It would set us up, nicely, wouldn't it, Bettine?-if we had the sum expended on this-what is it, Mrs. Grizzle calls it?"</p> 
               <p>"And oh, Lordy, to think that elegant Baron should, a' got as wet as a drowned rat," moaned Mrs. Grizzle, when all was over, and she was locking up the silver, with Grizzle yawning on the dining-room sofa. "Our Sam's so careless. He'll be brought home a corpse some day, I know, when we aint expectin' it. But, things <emph>did</emph> go off beautiful, excepting the accident, and accidents <emph>will</emph> happen in the best regulated families. I'm proud of our <hi rend="i"/>shampeter, husband; and I shouldn't wonder if that author the Smiths brought with 'em would report it in the mornin' papers. I hinted as much to him, and he said he would if I cared enough about it to <emph>pay</emph> for the trouble; so I took the hint, and give him a twenty-dollar greenback; and it'll be out, tomorrow, sure. We'll wake up and find ourselves famous, as Mr. Shakespeare did."</p> 
               <p>And with this pleasant reflection, they turned down the last light, and went to bed with a blissful consciousness of the glory of giving <hi rend="i"/>shampeters.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER VI.</head> 
               <head type="sub">LOVE'S YOUNG DREAM.</head> 
               <p>THE circumstances under which Louis Dassel, poor and a foreigner, made the acquaintance and won the friendship of the Camerons, were these:</p> 
               <p>One bitter winter-day, some eighteen months before the commencement of our story, a person dressed in fine cloth, a good deal worn and not at all suitable to the season, came into Mr. Cameron's office and asked if he had any work to give him-copying, writing letters in foreign languages, accounts, any thing by which he could earn a little money.</p> 
               <p>"If you have nothing better for me, let me put in the coal which I see is being delivered before your door," concluded the stranger, with a melancholy smile.</p> 
               <p>That smile, so sad and yet so proud, pierced straight through the husk in which the lawyer encased his heart during business hours. Although speaking English with great fluency, his features as well as his accent betrayed the nationality of the visitor; he was a German, and Mr. Cameron had a liking for the race. That he was a gentleman, and no common man, was evident at a glance; he had the air of one accustomed to command, and that self-restraint and self-respect which nothing could discompose. He was not embarrassed, in thus asking for employment, and this innate dignity also won upon the good opinion of his hearer.</p> 
               <p>Mr. Cameron had no work, just at that time, but, by a<pb n="90-91" xml:id="VAC8154-00000044"/> generous fiction, he made it appear that he had, setting him to copy some old briefs until he could arrange something more useful. He dared not offer charity, and he could not turn the shivering gentleman out into the winter-air: it was the lunch-hour, and he asked him out to lunch.</p> 
               <p>This was the beginning of his friendly offices towards Louis Dassel, which never had ceased since that day. He furnished him with copying for two or three weeks. Dassel made a page like copper-plate. Although very curious to know the history of his new clerk, the lawyer asked no questions; but he could not deny himself the treat of frequent conversations with one who showed himself familiar with every topic of the day.</p> 
               <p>In their mutual enthusiasm in the cause of human liberty, the history of the young refugee came out, in pieces, until, finally, Mr. Cameron felt justified, through his increasing friendship, in asking him in regard to his past life. Then Dassel, under the seal of confidence, told him that he was a Baron in the little state of Baden; that, when a boy of seventeen, he had been sent for a year to the Carlsruhe Institute, to receive military instruction, where he had met such fiery revolutionary spirits as Freilegrath, who indoctrinated him with a love of equal rights, and an ardor for noble achievement which drove from his mind a hereditary prejudice in favor of rank. In three months he was as red a republican as Sigel himself, joining his comrades in the Revolution of 1848, before his year was out.</p> 
               <p>After the sad defeat which followed, he escaped arrest only by flight. The minions of royalty were sharply on his track, but, aided by sympathizers among the people, he made his way over the frontier and buried himself in the solitariness of society in Paris, receiving from his father, from time to time, such means as his wants required. He was a good student, profiting by the treasures of art and the appliances of science around him: yet never, while he studied, did he forget the cause of the peoples, but, during all his banishment, maintained close correspondence with the secret organizations which no persecution could smother.</p> 
               <p>At length the old Baron died, leaving to his son all the family estates. The long time which had elapsed since the uprising and failure of '48, led him to hope that the German rulers had buried in oblivion all past offences; and, eager to see his old home, as well as to reclaim his estates, the young man hastened from Paris to his native place. But, the memory of princes covetous of good estates, was long; and hardly had he set foot in his own domain when the officers were on his track, to obtain the reward still upon his head. By the aid of a faithful retainer and the connivance of the people, he escaped, saving nothing; for, informed that the old Baron had willed all to the outlawed son, the government at once confiscated the property, and the young Baron was penniless. Like many another penniless man, he then came to America.</p> 
               <p>"I am expatriated and my estates seized by the Dukedom. America is my home. I have taken her for my adopted mother. Here there is no order of nobility. I wish to drop my title, and to have my past history remain unknown, except to my personal friends. I suppose, <emph>here,</emph> if a man proves himself worthy of respect, he has it, without regard to the manner in which he earns it. As I understand it, a wood-chopper, if he be a gentleman, is the equal of any man."</p> 
               <p>"That is the <emph>theory,</emph> Mr. Dassel; the <emph>practice</emph>-"</p> 
               <p>"Precisely," said the foreigner, with a dry smile, "that is, human nature in America is not essentially different from human nature in France, or Germany, or Madagascar."</p> 
               <p>Mr. Cameron spoke so frequently, at home, of the friendless and poverty-stricken refugee, that his wife desired him<pb n="92-93" xml:id="VAC8154-00000045"/> to be invited to dinner; and, having been equally as pleased as her husband with the new guest, she offered him the hospitalities of her house; bidding him, whenever homesick, or when he had nothing better to do with himself, to visit them. The sympathy and appreciation which she evidently offered along with her other good gifts, enhanced their value in the eyes of the homeless foreigner. He accepted them as gracefully and cordially as they were offered, becoming a frequent visitor at the house.</p> 
               <p>All the members of the family felt the charm of his varied discourse, from Elizabeth, who questioned about the color of Eugenie's eyes, to Robbie, who hung breathless on his descriptions of battle-fields. Some new acquirement came every day, to light. With Mr. Cameron he played chess; but he had a game of his own which he played-<foreign xml:lang="FRA">solitaire,</foreign> at which his employer once found him so engaged, that he was unconscious of a witness.</p> 
               <p>He had employed his leisure moments for weeks in cutting little pieces of wood into soldiers, half-an-inch high, and with thousands of these he had laid out a battle-field, and was in the midst of a desperate engagement, in which the red-tops were overthrowing the green-tops, very much to their general's satisfaction, when, conscious of an observer, he swept his conflicting armies into a box, turning, with a laugh-</p> 
               <p>"I can still fight wooden battles, Mr. Cameron."</p> 
               <p>The lawyer often felt surprise that one of Dassel's peculiar talents and circumstances, could remain quiet in America, when so many of his German friends were engaged in the war which at that time was upon us.</p> 
               <p>"Why do you not join Sigel?" he once asked of him. "You might win honor; and it would be better than this drudgery, to one of your temperament."</p> 
               <p>Dassel answered him quietly:</p> 
                
               <p>"I have grown skeptical, my friend. I solemnly believe that it matters not to the majorities of mankind what sort of tyranny rules them. If there is no master on a throne, to flourish the whip over them, they will set up something to bow down to,-a bag of money, perhaps. Mark the corruption already creeping into your politics. See the misrule of your cities; the expensive machineries of your elections, which, after all, are so managed as to make your voters mere instruments in the hands of politicians. Bah! I am done with politics!"</p> 
               <p>When Mr. Dassel first visited at Mr. Cameron's, Elizabeth had been home from school but a few months. Her mother desired her to continue the study of music, and, while considering what professor to engage, Dassel offered his services.</p> 
               <p>"I have never taught," he said, "but it would be a pleasure to teach your children, if you have confidence in my ability."</p> 
               <p>His magnificent playing and singing had been a great source of enjoyment to them; they were delighted to secure his services; and it was not long until Robbie, also, was placed under his tutorship in the languages and mathematics.</p> 
               <p>Through Mr. Cameron's recommendation, Mr. Dassel secured the situation of foreign correspondent in two wholesale houses. This duty was very light, consisting only in reading and answering the foreign letters on steamer-days; so that he was now in the enjoyment of a moderate income, and yet his own master the greater part of his time. He gave to Robbie three mornings a week, attending to his two music-pupils after lunch of the same days.</p> 
               <p>Mr. and Mrs. Cameron did not reflect upon the almost inevitable consequence of throwing an inexperienced girl<pb n="94-95" xml:id="VAC8154-00000046"/> like Elizabeth so much into the society of an accomplished man of the world. All the girl's slumbering emotional nature sprang into play beneath the light of his eye; her fancies took the color which he willed; she reverenced him as a hero, admired him as a gentleman; wondered at his patience with her when she did not equal his requirements at the piano; pitied him for his misfortunes. Before this ideal of perfection, the young men of her acquaintance were boys or boobies. What did she care for their idle chattering, when Mr. Dassel always had something worth listening to?</p> 
               <p>Companionship like this was fitted to deepen the womanliness of her character; the young girl of the dreamy brow and pretty fancies, soon passed into the realms of real life. The mother was surprised at the sudden expansion of thought and feeling which worked the secret blooming of the Rose of Love. Elizabeth always had been attractive, now she grew beautiful.</p> 
               <p>There, too, was the music-lesson; most witchingly dangerous medium for the interchange of sentiment. She was a true lover of music; Dassel had a voice whose lightest vibration was both passion and melody. The charm of those hours was inexpressible.</p> 
               <p>Milla, in those days, was a child, verily, with a child's heart. She loved Mr. Dassel because he was so kind and amusing, and praised her singing; for Milla had a voice which soared out of her body straight up with the lark, and floated in the blue vaults of heaven. To hear the singer, unseen, one could not realize that so dainty a little creature could so "flood the air with song." <emph>She</emph> had genius. She would have been as devoted to the piano as Lissa, but her weak spine prevented severe application. Sometimes she would forget herself in musical vagaries; then the sharp pain would come, and she would cry out for Sabrina to come and carry her to the sofa.</p> 
                
               <p>Insensibly the family had come to adopt Louis Dassel as a member, and to feel that it had gained in doing so. Robbie did finely under his guidance; but the boy was not so devoted to hero-worship as were his sisters. He was often interested and absorbed in his tutor; he thought him a remarkable man, and entertained not the slightest hope of ever rivalling his acquirements; but, as a <emph>friend,</emph> Robbie did not love Mr. Dassel. He was sometimes reproved unjustly; and, not being blind, he had seen a fire leap from his teacher's eye, when the responses did not suit, which he knew never was allowed to blaze upon others.</p> 
               <p>"If you should see a devil looking out of the front windows of a handsome house, some day, you would not be apt to forget your surprise; and whatever angels you might commonly find at the casement, you would always be expecting a return of the horns.</p> 
               <p>This was the case with Robbie. He thought he had seen the old fellow, one day, unmistakably; and, after that, he was always on the watch. He kept this watch very covertly; but, its influence was perceived, and an atmosphere grew up between the two, invisible, but not unfelt. According to modern parlance, "they were not harmonious."</p> 
               <p>Mr. Dassel certainly was rather irascible at times; he could be as bitter as wormwood and as biting as pepper; but this was chiefly to the world at large, when discussing social problems; his sharpness then only enhanced the value of his smoothness and courtesy to his friends.</p> 
               <p>"It's a wonder he's not more of a ladies' man," thought Mrs. Cameron. "He knows just how to soothe us, and flatter us, and charm us with ourselves and himself. His flattery is not of the common order. He does justice to our intellects, and that quite conquers us."</p> 
               <p>And thinking so well of his powers, the mother forgot that her daughter was no longer a little girl.</p> 
               <pb n="96-97" xml:id="VAC8154-00000047"/> 
               <p>As for the foreign tutor, it certainly was a palliative to the hardships of his situation to have the friendship of such a family; and, since he must have pupils, to have them like these two sweet girls, truly, was fortunate. The brother was only the necessary sour to be found in all pleasant things-even in sugar.</p> 
               <p>Elizabeth already had a fine taste in literature, formed under the careful guidance of her father; now her love for poetry sprung anew. During the long, delicious hours of the summer afternoons, many were the times when the blue eyes of the teacher and the dark ones of the young girl followed the same page, until at least one heart was brimmed with the crystal welling of song.</p> 
               <p>There could be but one result to a companionship like this. There came a day when Mr. Cameron was sought in his office, by Louis, to solicit permission to make his daughter an offer of marriage. This permission was asked with a curious mingling of pride and humility, which the father could but admire.</p> 
               <p>"I know that I owe every thing to you, Mr. Cameron, even the bread which I eat. But, I am no longer afraid but that I shall be able to earn a living; and if Miss Cameron prefers me to some wealthier suitor, it accords with the sentiments which I have heard you express, that you should allow her freedom of choice."</p> 
               <p>For some moments Mr. Cameron was silent. He was enduring the inevitable penance for bringing up a lovely daughter-to be asked to give her up to another; a wound, which, though sometimes soon healed, is always very painful at the first. Then, as we have said, it <emph>was</emph> an objection to him that Mr. Dassel was a foreigner. He was much older, too, than Elizabeth. He was poor. Like small prickings after the first stab, these thoughts struck him.</p> 
                
               <p>On the other hand, Louis, if a foreigner, was a republican. If older in years, he had that inexhaustible vitality of temperament and constitution which is ever young. If poor, he was educated and a gentleman. He always had liked and respected him; and if Lissa had gone farther, and loved him, the father alone was to blame, for had he not given her every opportunity?</p> 
               <p>Mr. Dassel sat quietly awaiting his answer. That immense self-control of his must have been learned in a varied school.</p> 
               <p>"Louis," was the long-withheld reply, "if Elizabeth loves you, I have not a word to say; and, now I reflect upon it, it is altogether probable she does-" both smiling at the implied compliment to one. "I will speak to her mother this evening; and to-morrow you will have our answer."</p> 
               <p>"It is enough,-more than enough. Thanks! thanks!"</p> 
               <p>How open, warm, and childlike was this German heart and manner! Perhaps, after all, it was not to be regretted as a foreign thing.</p> 
               <p>So the father went home that evening, with his message; and the mother, herself still girlish and beautiful, was made also to feel the sharp pain of resignation: <q>
                     <lg type="quotation">

               <pb n="98-99" xml:id="VAC8154-00000048"/> 
               <p>"Lissa is only a little girl," cried Mrs. Cameron, "and Louis is to her like an elder brother."</p> 
               <p>"Reckon it up, wife! Is not Lissa a year older than you were when I first made love to you?"</p> 
               <p>"Is that so, Robert?"</p> 
               <p>"Yes, my sweet wife. We cannot say the girl nay, however cruel the shock seems to us. As for the elder brother, Louis is thirty-six, but he looks twenty-six, and he will be young when he is sixty-six. Those blue eyes and golden beards seem to be dipped in the Fountain of Immortality. I think, wife, we shall be proud of him, though it may go hard with you, who are but two years his senior, to call him 'son!' Is it there the shoe pinches, my dear?"</p> 
               <p>"Nonsense, Robert. But, to give up my child-even to Louis!"</p> 
               <p>And then and there were "murmurings of distress;" tears, which the husband laughed at, while he felt like adding his own to them; then submission and cheerfulness; the consent given; the suit pressed,-and Elizabeth walking on air, breathing rose-sweet atmospheres, exhaling light in an aureole about her.</p> 
               <p>In April the couple were betrothed, and in September they expected to be married. Robbie was then to go away to College; the young married pair to remain at home the first winter, at the earnest request of the parents, who laughingly declared that, as Louis already spent half his time in the family, it would make no material change when he came to spend all of it there.</p> 
               <p>Thus affairs stood during that pleasant summer. Elizabeth, with all her natural gift for building castles-in-air, had not dreamed that life could be so full of happiness. Every sun rose in purple and set in gold.</p> 
               <p>Only little Milla, the darling, had not been so unwell for several seasons. Her paleness and languor, with a growing irritability not usual with her, attracted the anxieties of her parents, and caused Mr. Cameron to propose the trip to Newport, of which Lissa had informed her sister.</p> 
               <p>The morning after the <foreign xml:lang="FRA">fte,</foreign> Mr. Cameron and Louis rode down to the city in the same car with Grizzle, senior, who wrote an order on his tailor for a new suit of the best cloth for Mr. Dassel, who refused it, with great good-nature.</p> 
               <p>"Mrs. Grizzle won't have no peace of mind, if she finds you refuse to let us make up, as far as possible, for the carelessness of our boy. Sam catched cold last night, and has such a swelled face that he wasn't willin' to show himself to the ladies this mornin', or he'd a called with the order before you left the house."</p> 
               <p>"I think I can make it all right with Mrs. Grizzle, sir. I expect to do myself the pleasure of calling upon her this evening, when I shall endeavor to lessen her sense of obligation."</p> 
               <p>"She's took a great fancy to you, wife has," continued Grizzle, leaning over, and speaking in the other's ear. "She's dead-set on having you undertake to make a gentleman of our Sam. I tell her you can't make a whistle out of a pig's tail,-ha, ha!"</p> 
               <p>"Oh, yes you can," was the cool reply; "I have done things far more impossible."</p> 
               <p>At the Camerons' breakfast-table, that morning, the subject of the intended trip to Newport had been fully discussed. Mr. Cameron had consulted the family physician, who had urged at least a month by the sea-side, with plenty of salt-bathing and ocean-breezes for Milla. Mrs. Cameron was to go with her child, accompanied by Sabrina, as attendant. Milla was loth to go; cried, and said she always felt best at home; but this very nervousness was proof of the need of change, and her objections were overruled.</p> 
               <p>Had money been as abundant as wishes, the family<pb n="100-101" xml:id="VAC8154-00000049"/> would have accompanied the invalid <foreign xml:lang="FRA">en masse;</foreign> but, as it was, Elizabeth thought best to save <emph>her</emph> little portion for that autumn journey, the very thought of which kept her heart in such a sweet tumult.</p> 
               <p>Mr. Cameron never got away from his business until the first of August, and as Sabrina was so efficient a nurse, there seemed no reason why any other should accompany the little party.</p> 
               <p>It had been arranged that the three were to leave on the next Monday. It was some project connected with this plan which caused Dassel to tell Grizzle that he should call, that evening, on Mrs. Grizzle. In the meantime, he had serious business with Borden &amp; De Witt.</p> 
               <p>"I don't like to disappoint them," he said to Mr. Cameron, before leaving him. "I telegraphed that I had failed in the object of my visit, before leaving St. Louis; so they are prepared for the truth. I don't understand how my cousin Ritter came to make so absurd a mistake. The goods offered him were different in quality and character from those stolen; they were offered under price by their owner, in the hope of averting the failure of his little one-horse retail store, whose affairs had become embarrassed,-as he plainly proved when we took an officer to question him. He had received them directly from France, through a relative of his, and could afford to sell as low, or lower, than the importers. So, it all fell through."</p> 
               <p>"And you got hold of no other clue?"</p> 
               <p>"No. It is my opinion the goods never left this city. But, here we are-at the parting of the ways."</p> 
               <p>Mr. Dassel went immediately to the house of Borden &amp; De Witt, with whom he had a long interview, giving them clear and concise accounts of all he had said and done in their behalf, in St. Louis,-not only in tracing up the suspected goods, but in setting the police of the city to work; so that if, as believed, the property had been conveyed there, they would be on the alert to discover it.</p> 
               <p>The firm thanked him for his efforts, endeavoring to lessen the keen chagrin which he evidently felt at having disappointed them, and put them to expense without any good result. They had great confidence in his sagacity, and since he had failed to get track of the stolen goods, were convinced it was useless to look farther in that direction. In this belief Dassel encouraged them.</p> 
               <p>"I would have remained longer, if I had seen any excuse for it," the agent said, in conclusion; "but, as it was, I came home to attend to my duties here. I have lost my reward"-laughing-"but I have had a peep at the 'Great West' and the 'Father of Waters,' which I suppose ought to satisfy me."</p> 
               <p>He went to his desk and looked over what had accumulated during his absence; finished his work, and was going down the steps into the street, when he passed Abel Bellows, the porter. He bowed, as he always did, with the gracious courtesy which won him so many hearts; and the porter, encouraged by his manner, arrested him with-</p> 
               <p>"So, you're back a'ready, are you, Mister Dassel?"</p> 
               <p>"Yes, Abel. How have you fared in my absence? You've not been paying any visits to Liberty-street, eh?"</p> 
               <p>This was where poor Bellows, yielding to the fatal weakness so well known to his friends, exchanged, every month, a goodly portion of his wages for bits of cards, with numbers on them, which represented to his diseased eyes more gorgeous palaces in cloud-land than could stand in a row from the Park to Union Square, had they all taken visible form and settled themselves down in the shape of real estate.</p> 
               <p>Usually Bellows took all jesting on this subject with a deprecating good-humor-which was as if to say he knew he deserved it all for his folly; but this morning it nettled him-perhaps because Toddle was sick, and his wife had<pb n="102-103" xml:id="VAC8154-00000050"/> cried, at breakfast, because she could not take him to the country, and butter was high, flour higher, and rent highest.</p> 
               <p>"I'll tell you what, Mr. Dassel," he made answer, looking straight into the clear blue eyes, as clear, and far colder than his own, "I've got a ticket in a lottery now, which I calculate will draw a prize, enough to keep me and mine comfortable."</p> 
               <p>"Ah! said Dassel, passing carelessly on, "that's what you always say."</p> 
               <p>"This aint the Royal Havana lottery,"-doggedly.</p> 
               <p>"The Opera House, perhaps," added the young gentleman, hardly knowing, himself, why he continued to chat with Abel Bellows.</p> 
               <p>"Neither it aint the Opera House, Mr. Dassel. It's a ticket I bought with a certain little article; and I mean to hold on to it, till the time comes for drawin' the prize."</p> 
               <p>"What are you talking about?"</p> 
               <p>Something significant, or intended to be so, in the porter's tone, caused Dassel to turn again and look into the face usually so merry and so frank that it gave one a pleasant sensation to meet it. It was clouded, now, and the eyes had not their twinkling smile, as he said, "About that little article, sir."</p> 
               <p>"What?"</p> 
               <p>"About a sleeve-button."</p> 
               <p>"About a sleeve-button," repeated Dassel, meeting the keen glance of the porter with an eye like a little child's laughing and full of wonder, "and what in the name of logical sequence has that to do with lottery-tickets?"</p> 
               <p>"Oh, nothing," said Abel, after a blank pause of half a moment, "I beg your pardon for cracking my little jokes on you, Mr. Dassel," and touching his hat, the porter turned to his work, while the correspondent stepped forth into the sunny street, humming a strain from "Faust."</p>

               <head>CHAPTER VII.</head> 
               <head type="sub">PHOTOGRAPHS.</head> 
               <p>THERE was quite a change in the programme for July; a change which left Elizabeth Cameron more lonely and dissatisfied than she, in the unselfishness of her disposition, would care to acknowledge.</p> 
               <p>Mr. Dassel kept his promise of calling on Mrs. Grizzle the morning after the <foreign xml:lang="FRA">fte champtre;</foreign> and the result of that visit was of considerable importance. Later in the same evening he communicated it to Elizabeth. Mrs. Grizzle had renewed her solicitations that he should take charge of "her Sam's" mind and manners-a delightful employment, as Louis remarked, and one which would tax his resources heavily! She farther proposed that he should accompany them to Newport, as one of the family, she paying his expenses, in consideration of his services in imparting "an air of style" to her party, and secretly overlooking and directing the young gentleman-correcting his grammar, "posting him up" on <choice>
                     <sic>mattters</sic>
                     <corr>matters</corr>
                  </choice> of etiquette, and training him in the art of spending his newly-acquired money like one "to the manor born."</p> 
               <p>"Think of it! think of it, Bettine!" said Dassel, with one of his gayest laughs; "will I not truly have found my place on earth, at last?-trainer-in-general to this young thorough-bred, whose greatest ambition is to appear 'fast'-for he has not the nerve to be really so. What an aesthetic employment for a blue-blooded Baron, whose castles<pb n="104-105" xml:id="VAC8154-00000051"/> have stood for six hundred years staring at their reflections in the lovely Rhine! Mrs. Grizzle tells me that she is to take carriage, coachman, 'chamber-maid,' and all! A horse for Sammy! a horse for the Baron! Oh, we <emph>shall</emph> be grande!"</p> 
               <p>"I thought you were too proud, Louis."</p> 
               <p>"What has pride to do with it, now that I am so soon to have a little family to look after-a sweet wife, to cling to me, and ask me for pretty things, between her kisses? <emph>Then</emph> I shall have pride. I have too much now, child; I know that. I have pride to wish to take good care of you when I get you. And I think I see the way to cultivate this good lady's republican passion for rank, to my own advantage. But if I engage with her, it cannot be for less than three months. That will delay our wedding one whole month. What does my Bettine say to that? Is it, then, worth the sacrifice?"</p> 
               <p>"You know best about business matters, Louis."</p> 
               <p>He was patting her hand so tenderly, looking into her face so earnestly, Elizabeth blushed lest he should see the tears which came into her eyes. She was not thinking of his postponing the marriage-day so much as of the weeks of absence, when he should be in attendance upon the Grizzles, and she left alone with her father and Robbie, during the bright summer weather. Gone, the witchery from the moonlight, the splendor from the sunlight; broken, the enchantment which had bound her, all these delicious days and hours.</p> 
               <p>"I still should hesitate about a step which will keep me five weeks away from you; but I have thought of your mother and Milla. I can contribute much to their enjoyment by being near them. Whenever they need the services of one of the other sex, I shall stand ready to do all in my power for them."</p> 
                
               <p>"Milla," cried Elizabeth, as much to hide the tremble in her voice as to divert her lover's eyes from her face, "Milla, how would you like Mr. Dassel's company in Newport? Would it render you any more willing to make the visit?"</p> 
               <p>The younger sister, as usual, was curled up in the great arm-chair, like the lily in its leaves, listlessly watching her mother, who was under the chandelier by the table, basting fresh puffings around a blue tarletane dress for her little ladyship. She leaned forward eagerly, the color fluttering into her cheek.</p> 
               <p>"Yes, indeed. We should be so <emph>safe,</emph> and well-cared for; wouldn't we, mamma."</p> 
               <p>"You always speak of Mr. Dassel as if he were Providence," rejoined the mother. "I should think Sabrina and I could take all due care of you."</p> 
               <p>"I know it. But Louis is so <emph>strong.</emph> He infuses me with a little independence, just by breathing his atmosphere."</p> 
               <p>"Fiddlestick!" whispered Robbie, who was reading, not far from her.</p> 
               <p>"Now, Bobbie, you're jealous!" whispered Milla, in return, growing red with indignation. "If you were full-grown, a great, tall, powerful man like Louis, I should feel the same with you."</p> 
               <p>"But I'm your brother, and not a small boy, either."</p> 
               <p>"So is Louis my brother."</p> 
               <p>"Hum! not exactly. But my nose is out of joint, I see plainly," and Robbie squinted at his own nasal organ-a horrible squint, which caused Milla to feel like pulling his hair.</p> 
               <p>"Why do you ask, Lissa?" Mrs. Cameron had been saying, during this by-play. "I did not know Mr. Dassel had any plans looking towards Newport."</p> 
               <pb n="106-107" xml:id="VAC8154-00000052"/> 
               <p>"Neither had I, until to-day;" and then followed an explanation, ended by asking her advice.</p> 
               <p>"Milla and I should be very glad to have you with us," answered Mrs. Cameron-and there she stopped to look at Elizabeth; but the bright, contented face she met, reassured her.</p> 
               <p>All her life long Elizabeth had made sacrifices for Milla; and she did not wish to cease them now. It <emph>would</emph> be better for her sister to have Louis' companionship-he was so kind, so thoughtful, so brotherly; and he would relieve her mother of so much care. It would be pure selfishness in her to seek to retain him at her side, when others needed him more, and he himself looked forward to pecuniary advantages. Before Louis had completed his story to her mother, the loving girl made up her mind to cheerfully support his cause; and she did it with such a grace that all were deceived.</p> 
               <p>"If I did not fear you would be lonely," said her mother, "I should be thoroughly pleased. Really, you had better come, too. Since the wedding is not to be quite so early, you will have time and means."</p> 
               <p>"I shall not desert papa," was the firm reply, given after a moment of temptation, during which Lissa's heart had bounded with the wish to accept the suggestion.</p> 
               <p>"What a pretty dress!" said Mr. Dassel, coming away from his betrothed, and glancing at the azure fleece of puffings and flounces in Mrs. Cameron's lap. "Will you take your jewels to Newport, Milla? Mrs. Grizzle will be out with all of her's. She told me about them, this evening. She has a new necklace, very fine. Imagine it-imagine it, my dears, corruscating on that neck of her's! Positively, it reminds me of the piece of meat which the Roc brought up out of the valley of Diamonds."</p> 
               <p>"Hush, Louis; do not you be guilty of odious comparisons sons. Would you advise a girl of sixteen to wear such costly ornaments? I shall have you laughing at me, next."</p> 
               <p>"No, child; don't wear jewels yet awhile. I should like, however, to see them upon my Lady Cameron. I'm not sure but that she would be the star of the assemblage, after all. In the Old World, madame, your beauty would be appreciated. You would not be crowded against the wall, to give room for Young America to whirl itself giddy. Order yourself a new dress or two, take the casket with you, and do yourself justice for once."</p> 
               <p>The children set up a chorus of approval; but their beautiful mother declared that she had no ambition to rival Mrs. Grizzle, nor to sport diamonds on an income of six thousand dollars a-year.</p> 
               <p>Some of the neighbors calling, there was discussion of the Grizzle entertainment, music, and a merry ending to the evening.</p> 
               <p>If Elizabeth went to bed with a little sore spot in her heart, no one was the wiser for it. She had a good deal of firmness of purpose, for one so young; and having resolved to put herself aside in the consideration of others, she did it without reservations.</p> 
               <p>The next day Sam Grizzle was sufficiently recovered from the effects of his river-bath, to go out for the purpose of having his photograph taken. His mother wanted it "big as life, and painted in real oil, to be finished up in her absence, and ready for the adornment of her <foreign xml:lang="FRA">bodoir</foreign> upon her return from the watering-places." Sam was the more ready to consent to sit, from a secret hope which he cherished, that, if he should get a smaller likeness taken, and carelessly exhibit it during a farewell call on Miss Cameron, she might ask him to leave it with her during <emph>his</emph> absence Delicious hope! it infused a warmth into the crimson tints<pb n="108-109" xml:id="VAC8154-00000053"/> of his countenance like that of the sun shining through a damask curtain.</p> 
               <p>They picked up Dassel somewhere on the way, and took him down with them. He also had himself to serve, being desirous of leaving his pictured semblance with Elizabeth, and accompanied them cheerfully, the carriage drawing up before a well-known photographer's.</p> 
               <p>"Now you be sure and take Sam with his best expression," urged the lady to the respectful artist, who felt the full power of her liveries in front of the door. "Some of them pictures is <emph>so</emph> unbecoming. Why! Grizzle's got one of me to home, with my brows all puckered up by the sun, and looking so long; yet I was <emph>very</emph> particular to tell the gentleman to do his best. I want you to take Sam asmiling; he's handsomer when he smiles, than any other time. I don't mind your flatterin' him <emph>a little,</emph> if you can do it and have him naturel. If you could take his mouth a trifle smaller-and his nose not quite so broad-there! more like Ba-Mr. Dassel's, the gentlemen there; <emph>he's</emph> got the real pattrishun nose-quite like this stature here. But I don't think you could improve Sammy's smile; that's all his own. Sam, just think of Miss E. C. when you set down to be taken. That'll give you the right sort of smile, and you can tell her afterwards."</p> 
               <p>"Don't speak of E. C., mother, or you'll put me all in a fluster," expostulated Sam, smiling so broadly at thought of his secret intentions, as to make Dassel feel like ramming a picture-frame down his throat when he realized who E. C. was.</p> 
               <p>Dassel, when he first entered the gallery, had thrown a comprehensive glance around, which included all persons and things. It was a habit of his. He never entered a throng of any kind, a public place, or a drawing-room, that a rapid, searching glance did not place him in possession of every individual face. He never forgot a countenance once seen.</p> 
               <p>While Sam sat for his likeness, Dassel amused himself looking at the beautiful shadows of more beautiful realities-portraits of some of the loveliest women of New York-and in listening to the ceaseless chatter of Mrs. Grizzle, who had the poor artist quite at her mercy, inflicting suggestions and criticisms upon him of a nature which proved them to be, at the least, original.</p> 
               <p>When Sam had been served, Dassel sat for a small photograph. Mrs. Grizzle begged for some cartes-de-visite, and the artist himself requested permission to put a copy of the picture on exhibition; for Louis was not only a fine-looking, but a very singular and distinguished-looking personage, whose portrait would have commanded attention. He decidedly refused both propositions, adding that he wished one proof, alone, and the negative to be destroyed.</p> 
               <p>As the little party stepped into the hall leading to the staircase, after Mrs. Grizzle had concluded her orders as to her son's picture, she suddenly darted forward, calling out:</p> 
               <p>"Miss Bayles, is that you?"</p> 
               <p>A dark-eyed, dark-haired girl, very plainly dressed, turned at the question, and came back.</p> 
               <p>"Mrs. Grizzle? and Mr. Samuel?" she said, shaking hands with them, blushing slightly as she looked at the young man, but not at all disconcerted by the magnificence of the group.</p> 
               <p>"What on earth are you doing <emph>here,</emph> Miss Bayles?"</p> 
               <p>"I was going out to get some lunch."</p> 
               <p>"Do you <emph>live</emph> here?"</p> 
               <p>"I color photographs for Mr. F."</p> 
               <p>"Well, I declare! I hope they'll put you on Sammy's, then, for I know you'll do it up sweetly. Your father used to paint <emph>beautiful.</emph> How is he, my dear?"</p> 
               <pb n="110-111" xml:id="VAC8154-00000054"/> 
               <p>"He is dead"-with a momentary quiver of voice and lip. "He died very poor. Portrait-painting is not a calling to get rich at, especially in these days of sun-pictures. I tried to keep on in his profession; but I was obliged to come down to coloring photographs. I do pretty well at that. My work is liked, and I make a living."</p> 
               <p>"So! Well, I'm real glad to meet you. Perhaps you've heard that Grizzle got enormously rich on government contracts?"</p> 
               <p>"Yes, I heard so."</p> 
               <p>"We don't live as we used to, Miss Bayles; but I shall be just as glad to see you for all that. Now, I'll tell you; I'm goin' off to Newport, and around, a few weeks; but, when I git back, I want you to come right out to our place, and make a visit. You look pale and thin. Don't you have holidays?"</p> 
               <p>"I take a couple of weeks in August, when I am able to indulge in such a luxury."</p> 
               <p>"We may not be back till nigh the first of September. But then you must come out and take a <emph>good</emph> rest. I shall stop here and let you know. If you can't afford to be idle, you can paint all our picturs. We'll pay you for 'em. And you needn't be afraid of Sam; he's off on another track, long ago."</p> 
               <p>Mrs. Grizzle winked at Sam, who looked rather sheepish as he met the bright, dark eyes of Miss Bayles smiling faintly upon him. Miss Bayles had been Sam's first love. This was five or six years ago. In those days he was a lad of sixteen, and she was about the some age. His father kept a retail grocery at the corner of a modest down-town street-a small affair, with Mrs. Grizzle's sitting-room back of it, and Sammy serving behind the counter. Miss Bayles used to come there for small supplies for her father and herself; and Sammy, weighing out the tea, butter, and flour, counting the eggs, doing up the little brown packages in the highest style of the art, "tied up his heart" in them. For the dark-eyed girl <emph>was</emph> pretty, in those days, with pink in her cheeks, and such a lady-like way that he never could bear to see her carrying her own bundles, but always insisted on the basket being sent, no matter how little was inside of it. Sometimes he had carried it home for her, walking by her side. She lived not far away, on the first floor of a respectable brick-house; and her father, who always came to let her in, had such a grand way, and wore such a long white beard, and looked so much like a magician, with the stick, palette, and brushes in his hand, which he waved with such gentle benignity that the enamored grocer-boy was overpowered, and would as soon have thought of wooing the Sultan's daughter as this gentleman's.</p> 
               <p>The Bayles then lived in modest comfort; or, if they suffered any discomfort, hid it from the world. Sam talked so much of them as to excite his mother's curiosity. She purposely made the acquaintance of the artist's daughter, and was so delighted with her, that she did her many favors, and finally called upon her, under pretence of talking of having Mr. Grizzle's portrait "done." Grizzle hardly felt able; but, to please his wife (and his own vanity, perhaps), he sat for the portrait, which gave much opportunity for visiting, until the Grizzles grew quite familiar with the pretty parlor, running over with books, busts, and engravings, where Miss Bayles sat at her embroidery, and her father at his easel, doing up the little fat man before him with marvellous fidelity, throwing in plenty of elaborate shirt-front and satin waistcoat, to the delight of Mrs. Grizzle, whose pleasure was complete when her lord smiled from the canvas upon her, with a large scroll in his hand, which gave him, she said, an air of a<pb n="112-113" xml:id="VAC8154-00000055"/> lawyer, and diverted all suspicion from the fact that a pound of "dips" would have been legitimate. The scroll and the shirt-bosom were her own invention, and their reproduction a triumph which elevated the artist to a peerless height in her estimation.</p> 
               <p>And when she found that Miss Bayles, also, could use the brush with nearly as grand results as her father, she felt that the store derived honor from their patronage, small as that patronage was.</p> 
               <p>Sammy's passion at length led him to such extremes that he was unfit to remain behind the counter; his weights and measures became unreliable; and finally he was accused by <choice>
                     <sic>irat ecustomers</sic>
                     <corr>irate customers</corr>
                  </choice> of sending them home with salt for sugar, and pickled salmon instead of cheese. One washerwoman got ink when she sent for a bottle of "blue," ruining, in consequence, a tubful of gentlemen's shirts; while a little girl who came for a washboard was sent home with a large codfish tied up with a bar of soap.</p> 
               <p>In consequence of these disasters, Mrs. Grizzle advised her son to propose, he having then reached the ripe age of eighteen, his flame increasing steadily for two years. She sent the first green peas of the season, with her compliments, to Mr. Bayles, to afford Sam an opportunity for declaring himself to the daughter; which he did after the fashion of a tallow candle lit when the wick is damp.</p> 
               <p>Miss Bayles extinguished the spluttering flame with a prompt negative, gentle and modest enough, leaving the lover in darkness.</p> 
               <p>Shortly after that, Grizzle, senior, enlarged his business, and went into a pork-packing house farther down. His family moved from the corner-grocery, and the old painter with his pretty daughter, lost sight of true, if vulgar, friends. Often, in their days of sickness and privation which followed, would they have been glad to see the round, red face of Mrs. Grizzle inside their door.</p> 
                
               <p>This was the first meeting since all these wonderful changes. Sam, standing there beside Mr. Dassel, felt inclined to "put on airs" when he met the girl who had had refused him in the days of his greenness.</p> 
               <p>"Golly! she won't get the chance again!" he thought, looking at the pale face, and the plain lawn dress, and thinking of the superb bust of his female friends, from Miss Cameron to Miss Bulbous.</p> 
               <p>"Now, you be sure to come, Miss Bayles," reiterated the matron. "I'll let you know when we return home. I want to show you our new place. Come, Sammy, Mr. Dassel, we must be going."</p> 
               <p>But where was Mr. Dassel? He had disappeared, almost as if he had sunk into the floor. Two or three persons were coming up the broad flight of stairs, at the head of which they stood,-a dressy, good-looking party, chattering in the French language.</p> 
               <p>"That's the French Minister and two of his suite," said Miss Bayles, when they had passed into the rooms; "they were here yesterday."</p> 
               <p>"I wish I'd taken a better look at 'em. Perhaps Mr. Dassel went back to speak about his picture. Let's look in again, and see."</p> 
               <p>She returned into the gallery, but Mr. Dassel was not there. She had, however, opportunity for a good long stare at the distinguished strangers.</p> 
               <p>"If I could a-had <emph>them</emph> to my <hi rend="i"/>shampeter," she sighed.</p> 
               <p>When she came out again Dassel was at the foot of the stairs. He laughed when she asked what had become of him, saying that he had met an enemy, and had put on his invisible cloak. He was pale, and a trifle discomposed, sinking back into the carriage with a sigh as of relief.</p> 
               <p>"I am sorry I sat for my picture to-day."</p> 
               <p>"Why so, Baron?"</p> 
               <pb n="114-115" xml:id="VAC8154-00000056"/> 
               <p>"Some ugly chance may reveal it to these people. They are foreigners; I know them well. One of them is an enemy whom I do not care to have know of my residence in this country. Not that he can harm me now"-he spoke more to himself than her; then, recalling himself: "'Tis little matter, after all. When there's an end of politics, there should be of political hatreds. As to the picture, it serves me right for breaking over my resolution never to sit for one."</p> 
               <p>Miss Bayles went to her lunch with more appetite than usual. The meeting with old friends had revived her, bringing back vividly, as it did, many sweet and bitter memories of those days when her father was alive. The prospect of a visit to Grizzle Villa was pleasant to her. She knew that she should be "patronized;" that she would be expected to take a back seat when more fashionable company was around; but she was not so proud as once, and she knew, by former experience, that Mrs. Grizzle had a motherly way and kind impulses, despite her aspiring follies. Rest, fresh air, dewy lawns, cool rooms, delicate food, would be very welcome; while, as for the good company, she should prefer to keep away from it.</p> 
               <p>She thought much of the stranger who was with the Grizzles. She admired him greatly, wondering if she should meet him again when the proposed visit was made, and if <emph>he</emph> had been sitting for his photograph, conscious that a very life-like one was printed on her memory.</p> 
               <p>It was so close and warm in Miss Bayles' little hall-room the next day-which was Sunday-that in the afternoon she was compelled to leave her door wide open, to catch such breath of coolness as she might. The little single bed did not fill all the room, but left quite a space before the window; and here there was a light easel and a chair. Some hanging shelves were crowded with books, and the scant allowance of wall left, after one side had been devoted to washstand and clothes-press, was hidden behind pictures, large and small, framed and unframed, sketches in pencil and water-colors; and, at the foot of the bed, a portrait of her father. The bit of green carpet on the floor was fresh and pretty; altogether, there was about this tiny bird's-nest and its pale-faced occupant, a tone of subdued sentiment, a "light of other days," which made a <foreign xml:lang="FRA">genre</foreign> picture very attractive-a little poem set in the broad columns of prose which made up the tenement-house.</p> 
               <p>Miss Bayles had been to church in the morning; and now, this sultry afternoon, not feeling disposed for a six-cent ride to Central Park, she had out her colors, and was at work upon a photograph, so much absorbed as, at first, not to hear the light tap on her door. Upon its being repeated she looked up and saw Mr. Bellows standing without, cheerfully awaiting the effect of his apologetic little knock.</p> 
               <p>"I don't know as open doors means your to hum, Miss Bayles."</p> 
               <p>"Oh, yes it does, to my friends."</p> 
               <p>"I've had a hankerin' to look at your picturs ever sence you come; but I didn't like to intrude into a lady's private apartment."</p> 
               <p>"When ladies keep house in one room, they cannot stand upon ceremony. You're welcome to a peep at my gallery, Mr. Bellows. It is not Belmont's, as you may see."</p> 
               <p>"It's purty, anyhow," with a glance of wholesale admiration. "Do you know, when I was a boy, I quite took to paintin'. There was a good many profiles and posies white-washed out of existence, in my great big garret-room, when the spring-cleaning was done. I've not got over my taste for it yit. When I draw my prize, I'm goin' to have you do the hull family, Miss Bayles, if you will, with Toddle on my shoulder, and a red rosy in his fat little fist."</p> 
               <pb n="116-117" xml:id="VAC8154-00000057"/> 
               <p>"I'm afraid Toddle will be too large for your shoulder before you draw that prize, Mr. Bellows. He's a nice, dimpled little child; and I'll tell you what I'll do. Get a good photograph of him, and I'll color it for you. You are always doing me favors, and I would like to do that much for you."</p> 
               <p>Abel's face glowed with pleasure. Little Toddle, with his torn frock, his bare legs, his gingham apron-where was there such a child as that? Was there any "curled darling" up-town with cheeks so good to pinch, and such pretty legs to go bare? with hair that would curl, whether brushed or not, and whose whole make-up was in every way so satisfactory? Abel Bellows thought <emph>not;</emph> and when the young lady offered to paint his boy, she put the finishing touch to her own perfections in the father's eyes.</p> 
               <p>"What'll his mother say, when she hears <emph>that?</emph> We'll git the photograph this very week. But it'll be giving you too much trouble."</p> 
               <p>"No, it will not. Look at this man I have here, Mr. Bellows. You sometimes make shrewd hits at character; what do you think of this?"</p> 
               <p>"Why, bless my soul! Miss Bayles, that's Mr. Dassel."</p> 
               <p>"Who's Mr. Dassel?"</p> 
               <p>"The young gentleman who does our foreign letters. And a great favorite he is with our house."</p> 
               <p>"Do you like him?"</p> 
               <p>"Yes; unless I'm mistaken, I do like him very much. That is-I did-and I can't help it, yit, when I see him. He's got a taking way with him, that jest draws you after him like a fish on a line. If I should make up my mind to hate that man, the moment I set eyes on him I should forget all about it."</p> 
               <p>"But why <emph>should</emph> you make up your mind to hate him?"</p> 
                
               <p>All the brightness on Abel's face went into eclipse; his thoughts had gone quite away from the room and the speaker; he did not hear her question, but stood looking grimly out-the-window.</p> 
               <p>"I came by this surreptitiously," continued the artist. "He particularly forbade any copies being taken; but I coaxed one from my friend Brown, promising to keep it in my private collection; so I'm quite sure no harm will be done."</p> 
               <p>"What do you want of it?" asked Abel, a little alarmed, coming back to his senses.</p> 
               <p>"Oh, I'm not in love with it-not the least bit, Mr. Bellows. Don't fancy me guilty of any thing so romantic. I wanted it for a study. I have never before met such a face; and I have not yet fathomed it. It baffles me."</p> 
               <p>Looking up from the subject on which her eyes had been fixed as she spoke, she could hardly repress a scream; for there, in the door, just behind Abel, stood the picture's original. How long had he stood there? Had he heard what she said? She could not tell; but she was quite certain that he could not see the likeness, from his position, and she immediately placed over it that of Sam Grizzle-a copy of the small one, which she intended to give his mother when she went to Rose Villa.</p> 
               <p>The intruder bowed deeply to the lady, then greeted Mr. Bellows. "I asked, below, for you, and they directed me to this floor. I was passing along the street, when I chanced to remember your address. I heard you say, Friday, that your child was ill; so I just ran up the stairs to inquire if he were better, or worse."</p> 
               <p>"Better-quite well, I thank you, now, sir. Sorry you took so much trouble," his fatherly heart welling with pleasure to see Mr. Dassel wearing an air of concern on the boy's account.</p> 
               <pb n="118-119" xml:id="VAC8154-00000058"/> 
               <p>"If the shops had been open I would have bought him some little nice thing. Glad to hear he is better. Does the child love flowers?"</p> 
               <p>He held an exquisite bouquet which Lissa had given him.</p> 
               <p>"He's hardly old enough to do justice to 'em," responded Abel, with a smile; "but his mother would make up for him, I guess. Won't you walk in, and rest yourself a little while, Mr. Dassel? It's warm."</p> 
               <p>Mr. Dassel did not care if he did; it <emph>was</emph> warm, and he was somewhat fatigued. Abel hastened forward to give the alarm to his wife; while the gentleman lingered a moment to glance at the walls, and say to the artist: "I beg your pardon, Mademoiselle, for stumbling into your apartment. I saw you yesterday-did I not?-at F.'s. You have some very pretty things here; those sketches have real artistic merit;" and, with another deprecating bow, and a bright smile, he was gone.</p> 
               <p>"How pleasant he is," mused the artist. "Foreigners are <emph>so</emph> genial! They open, like ripe chestnuts, instead of shutting themselves up in their burs. Thank fortune, he did not see the mischief I was at."</p> 
               <p>"How pleasant he is!" repeated Mrs. Bellows, when the magnificent presence had quite vanished from the tenement-house, leaving behind it, for a reminder, the rich bouquet in her cracked glass pitcher, and a greenback crumpled in Toddle's plump fingers. Mr. Dassel had taken a good half-hour to rest himself, and had not refused the sarsaparilla-pop which was offered him. He had talked sympathetically of the high prices, told Abel that his wages ought to be raised to accord with these prices, advised Mrs. Bellows to hire her washing done out, and take a holiday to-morrow in the Park, with Toddle, leaving the five-dollar greenback quietly as a means for carrying out his suggestion.</p> 
                
               <p>"He ain't a bit set up," continued the porter's wife, when their guest was out of hearing. "He talked about house-keeping, as if he'd been a woman. I declare, I had to laugh. What's that the child's tearin'? It's a five-dollar bill, Bellows, as sure's you're alive!"</p> 
               <p>"We don't take charity," said the porter, reddening.</p> 
               <p>"No more he didn't mean it as charity, Abel. Don't you see, he gave it to the child, to buy him something pretty. 'Twasn't meant for us; it's Toddle's."</p> 
               <p>"Let it be spent for the boy, then;" and Abel fell into such a fit of musing, that his wife could not satisfy herself with talking to him, and took refuge with Miss Bayles. When she had left the room, Abel took a wad of paper out of his vest-pocket, unrolled it, and gazed long upon the glittering bauble which sparkled and shimmered in his hand with a green, baleful light.</p> 
               <p>"I've a mind to drop it in the sink," he said.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER VIII.</head> 
               <head type="sub">GIRLS' HEARTS.</head> 
               <p>IF ever there was any thing truly lovely in the loves of this world, it was to be seen in the relations existing between Milla Cameron and her family. The law of compensation seemed, in her case, to hold good. The misfortune which had resulted in fixing upon her an incurable physical defect had so quickened the sympathies of all about her, that she really appeared to gain more than she lost. Love-love the most tender and lavish-surrounded her as an atmosphere. In this atmosphere she lived and bloomed, a delicate, happy creature, almost unconscious of her deformity, or regarding it as the source of half the petting and favors she received. To be a little tired, to have a dull pain in her back, was to have every one waiting upon her. Cook consulted <emph>her</emph> taste in the dessert; nurse always was hanging about for a chance to do something for "her chile;" Robbie was her slave; Lissa was so good and thoughtful; her parents so indulgent! To Milla, in her gay childhood, it was pleasant to have a special claim upon their generosity. She ruled, a fairy-queen, by virtue of her misfortune. She guessed not the sad premonitions of future suffering which made all so gentle with her now. The love of her family was as a wall of flowers about her, to keep away a cold and curious world. Not that they believed any one could be so pitiless as wilfully to inflict a pang upon their darling. They knew she would be admired and liked, despite her own defect-for her very nature drew love, as the skies drew water; but when she should be old enough to realize all the penalties of her position, they felt that even the sweetness of resignation could not render her wholly happy. This foreboding it was, more than any present ill, which drew them about her like the leaves about a sensitive-plant. Milla was spared all vexation; Milla never was crossed or denied; Milla always was in somebody's arms receiving caresses, little, unexpected presents, or having games invented for her amusement.</p> 
               <p>In testimony to the sweetness of her disposition, we can say that, with all this, she was not a spoiled child. Full of gayety and warmth, an ardent sunbeam, the opposite of sickness or disease, she brightened the house, lavishing affection as generously as she received it, only drooping, when tired, like a blossom in the heat, to revive when again rested. Sometimes, when more than usually unwell, she was irritable and exacting; but such moods were the result of physical languor, and she came out of them more charming than ever. To be a little naughty, a little willful, was her privilege. The members of that household would no more think of finding fault with Milla than the moods of daylight. Robbie, impetuous with others, was docility itself with her. It was a pretty sight to see this boy-page attendant upon the fairy-queen.</p> 
               <p>Thus it had been with Milla all her brief, beautiful life; and it was the prayer of her mother, every night, on her bended knees, that she always might remain a careless child, and that so long as she lived, her closest friends might live to protect her.</p> 
               <p>But something of a change had come over Milla, which now, during this summer of our story, had attracted her mother's anxious attention. She was decidedly more willful<pb n="122-123" xml:id="VAC8154-00000060"/> than was her wont, given to stubborn moods, fits of depression, which would in turn yield to the most airy, frolicksome humors-all this accompanied by corresponding physical languors or nervous excitements. Mrs. Cameron had consulted their doctor, who had attended the child since her birth; and he had recommended change of air and ocean-bathing, assuring the mother that it was only what was to be expected at her age.</p> 
               <p>"We must be very careful of her, for a year or two," he said, "and she may grow into a tolerably healthy woman yet."</p> 
               <p>Elizabeth, when she heard the physician's decision, would have postponed her marriage, given up her <foreign xml:lang="FRA">trousseau,</foreign> made any possible sacrifice, to secure the means of indulgence to her sister. The whole family being like-minded, the trip to Newport was an object easily accomplished.</p> 
               <p>On Monday, Mrs. Cameron, Milla, and their sable waiting-maid departed. On Wednesday, Mrs. Grizzle, Mr. Grizzle junior, Susie, Mr. Dassel, coachman, maid, carriage, horses, and coach-dog, followed on the same track, leaving that part of the neighborhood quite desolate. Sam gave many a backward glance, in the hope that Miss Cameron would come out on the porch and wave him some signal of distress at his going; and was rewarded for so exerting himself until red in the face, by her appearance, at the last moment, fluttering a white hand and handkerchief. But for whom?-Alas, this question tormented the ignoble traveller all day; for a dim idea had gained a glimmering force in his brain, that Miss Elizabeth was much better acquainted with Dassel than with Grizzle, and the snowy fluttering might have been for <emph>him.</emph> He had not recovered from the depression consequent upon the failure of the photographic decoy-the exhibition, on the previous evening, of his own reflected charms, with hints of their being at the disposal of any one who should solicit them, not calling forth any demand; and when he affected to forget it and left the case on the table, Miss Cameron had picked it up and returned it to him, saying how sorry she should have been if he had disappointed the lady by leaving it <emph>there!</emph> These little doubts cast a soft shadow over the otherwise resplendent mood of Mrs. Grizzle's heir, on the way of paying his first respects to that fashionable sea-side resort which looked up before the lady's vision like "Mecca before the pilgrims." Who could be saved, who made not the pilgrimage to the sacred city? Who could be esteemed "one of us," who had not <emph>done</emph> Newport?</p> 
               <p>Thus the butterflies winged their way; the roses fell off from about the porch where Lissa walked to and fro in the summer evenings; dust and drought prevailed in the daylight, silence and melancholy in the starlight. Her father always was at home after dinner; and Robbie was only too frisky with the sense of his long vacation fresh upon him; there were letters, too, from her mother, and from Louis. Lissa was not unhappy. She needed this bar of silence in the throbbing, tumultuous music of her life, leading on towards the golden chords of the bridal anthem. When she had played chess with Robbie, and sang to her father until he was lulled from all the discontent of the day and prepared for a sweet night's rest, then she loved to sit for hours at her window, listening to the voice of the river, the rustle of the trees, watching the stars rise and set, and tending "Love's young dream."</p> 
               <p>Day by day, night by night, the dream deepened and strengthened, until she almost felt that, if Louis had not gone away, giving her an opportunity to review her feelings in solitude, she should scarcely have known how excellent he was, and how unqualifiedly she had given her heart to him. Into what a lovely, upturned face, into what a pure<pb n="124-125" xml:id="VAC8154-00000061"/> bosom, did moon and stars look down, as they hung over that open casement, haunted by the dreaming girl! What rosy waves of color swept over the white breast and the delicate brow, when she blushed, in the loneliness of her chamber, at the vague hopes and fears reaching into the future to timidly withdraw themselves! What dark eyes melting in liquid splendors of bliss, what clear cheeks tinted with the virgin rose of youth, did her mirror give back to her, when she looked into it to ask if there could be any thing there worthy of <emph>his</emph> pride and admiration! To feel herself beautiful, and believe herself beloved-was not that joy enough to fill a whole season to overflowing?</p> 
               <p>Dassel's letters were like himself in his company mood-chatty, gay, amusing. They told every thing communicable, and that in the most charming manner. Yet they did not entirely satisfy their recipient. She did not feel that they expressed the higher part of his nature, as she had hoped his letters would. After one of those midnight reveries, when all God's heaven seemed too small and His eternity none too long for her great love, to light her lamp and read over one of her lover's letters, was like coming <choice>
                     <sic>frem</sic>
                     <corr>from</corr>
                  </choice> the pure sky and sweet garden into the ball-room. The contrast filled her with momentary unrest.</p> 
               <p>"He cannot endure to put his heart on paper. I know him. He shrinks from it, as I do. It is dearest to whisper it, when together."</p> 
               <p>Then her eager eyes would search out all the precious places where her name was coupled with loving epithets, just as he addressed her in their home-talk, and she would shyly kiss them, with blushes, as if the honeysuckle at the window could tell tales of her. Then the last letter would go under her pillow, and she would sink into the rapturous sleep of health and innocence, to awaken to another day of dreamy delight, while her beauty deepened and brightened into richer and warmer tints.</p> 
                
               <p>Ah, yes! Elizabeth loved Dassel; she would not have him know how much, how well. In her eyes he was a HERO: and is not that the crowning claim upon a woman's heart? In marrying him, she knew that she would surprise friends who would think she might have made a <emph>better match;</emph>-she scorned the sound of the words. She was almost glad of his poverty, since it would prove that she chose him for his manhood's worth.</p> 
               <p>She liked to recall pictures of those boyish days when Louis' red-republicanism flowered into open war. Not that she liked "battle, murder, and sudden death;" but there was something upon which to feed her fancy in the impulsiveness, the recklessness, the ardent reaching after ideal good, of her young hero. Louis was more worldly now; he had experience; yet, that his principles still were incorruptible, witness what he had given up for an idea: wealth, rank, his native land.</p> 
               <p>It is not strange that here she found "stuff for dreams." Even the very humility of his present position exalted him in her eyes. Baron Dassel, expatriated for his love of right, a retainer in the train of a pork-packer's wife, quietly ignoring himself, anxious only to earn a living that he might claim the hand of his promised wife, was a man in whose preference a woman well might exult. Elizabeth had rich leisure to count up her treasures during those weeks of summer warmth and idleness.</p> 
               <p>Walking abroad in the gorgeousness of July gardens, with the hum of honey-bees resounding from the depths of flowers, with poppies flaming at her side, and the broad river flowing in a slow mass of molten gold beneath the emerald hill, there was nothing too brilliant, too sweet, too full, passionate, melodious, for the summer bloom and expansion of her soul. Life was so sweet; love was so all-sufficient. The vivid days and perfumed nights were a<pb n="126-127" xml:id="VAC8154-00000062"/> part of the all-pervading blessedness. In the morning, she awoke, with lids like unclosing lilies feeling the sunlight before they part; at night, she slept, the leaves of her soul fast-folded over odorous dews of dreams.</p> 
               <p>There is no exaggerating the state of a young girl of poetic and imaginative temperament, when she first finds and loves her Hero, and is loved by him. The habitual ecstasy of her mood is beyond description. All the warmth and color of an hundred summers melted into our pen would not fix the hues of her thought on paper. Into this mood Elizabeth grew more and more.</p> 
               <p>"Have you been lonely to-day, Lissa?" her father would ask, when he came home from the dusty city, and found her flitting about home, a bright, mateless bird.</p> 
               <p>"No, papa, not in the least; I have been so busy!"</p> 
               <p>"Busy? About what?"</p> 
               <p>Absolutely nothing but in merely living; yet the hours had flown, and had been so swift in passing, that it seemed to her she had been fully occupied.</p> 
               <p>She wrote cheerful letters to her friends in Newport, bidding them remain as long as possible, with a spirit free from envy. There was a trouble as well as a delight in writing to Louis; she was afraid he would feel the undercurrent in her letters, which might betray how much more she was loving him with every day and hour.</p> 
               <p>One day, as she was sitting in the summer-house, with a bit of hemming in her hand, Robbie strolled by-back again-passing and repassing with loitering steps, but, whenever she looked at him or spoke to him, hurrying off in embarrassment.</p> 
               <p>"Are you pining for Susie?" she called, at last, in a merry voice.</p> 
               <p>"Susie! Now, Lissa, you don't think me so silly. She's nothing but a little girl!"</p> 
                
               <p>"Ah, indeed!" said the sister, laughing to herself.</p> 
               <p>"I shan't fall in love with <emph>a child</emph> when I do fall in love," stoutly. "No, Lissa; I was only thinking-wanting to ask you-that is, trying to make out-whether you really-</p> 
               <p>"Really what, Robbie?"</p> 
               <p>"Love Mr. Dassel," with desperate resolution to get out the words.</p> 
               <p>"We are engaged, you know," replied Lissa, coloring.</p> 
               <p>"Yes, I do know it; and I know I wish you were not. But that isn't the thing. I wish you would tell me whether you love him <emph>much.</emph>"</p> 
               <p>"Why do you ask?"</p> 
               <p>"Because-I wish you didn't!" burst forth the boy, after a moment's hesitation, flinging himself down, with his head in his sister's lap.</p> 
               <p>"Well, Robbie, I do love him, with all my heart and soul."</p> 
               <p>Her words were more earnest than they would have been if a spice of resentment had not seasoned them. Robbie was a darling boy, but he was unreasonable, to be hurting her feelings with his prejudices against the man she had accepted. Her hand did not fall caressingly, as was its wont, on the brown curls; she did not push him from her-she was too gentle for that; but she manifested her displeasure by "letting him alone."</p> 
               <p>He lay there a moment, looking up into her face with troubled eyes. His lips trembled; he wished to say something, but his courage was not equal to the undertaking. Lissa looked coldly away from him, at a sloop which was sailing down the river.</p> 
               <p>"I did not mean to hurt your feelings," he said, lifting himself from her lap. "I only thought that-that-." He could get no farther with what lay like a dead-weight<pb n="128-129" xml:id="VAC8154-00000063"/> on his young mind; he started up, and rushed away, and she saw him no more that day, not even at the dinner-table.</p> 
               <p>"Robbie is really jealous!" murmured Lissa, with a musing smile. "It is hard for the rest of the family to adopt a new member-but how natural for me!" with a laugh and blush.</p> 
               <p>Like the odor of a flower floating on a passing breeze, the month wafted by, and Lissa awoke, one morning, to find that portion of the family which had been absent, returned.</p> 
               <p>Mr. Dassel she did not expect for a couple of weeks; Mrs. Grizzle had been told that it would be nice to "do" the mountains, and she was "doing" them. Her party had left for New Hampshire the day before Mrs. Cameron bid adieu to delightful Newport.</p> 
               <p>Delightful Newport it had proven to the visitors. Mr. Cameron, as he kissed his wife, declared she had bathed away the layers of ten years, leaving such smoothness and roundness and freshness that it was as good as taking unto himself a bride again; while, as for Milla, the improvement was magical.</p> 
               <p>Mrs. Cameron laughingly declared that it was all Mr. Dassel's work; that ocean, earth, and air were only his servitors. She should have thought Mrs. Grizzle would have rebelled at paying him a salary for making himself agreeable and useful to other people. Yet he seemed to have found time to do justice to all. His patroness had not complained. He had contrived to insinuate Milla daily into the luxurious carriage, for a spirited dash on the glorious beach; every thing costly and enjoyable which the Grizzles and himself had, was made also to contribute to the good of their neighbors. Indeed, Mrs. Grizzle had grown so fond of Milla, that she had turned quite red with crying at parting with her. Then, the ocean! timid and indolent Milla would not have had half the bathing prescribed, if Dassel had not insisted upon it, bearing her out into the water, on his strong arm, giving her courage to buffet the green monster, until she grew a perfect mermaid. Mrs. Cameron praised Louis until Lissa's face glowed with pleasure.</p> 
               <p>One would hardly have thought that four weeks and three days could have worked the change apparent in Milla Cameron. Her sister gazed upon her with surprise and delight. The lassitude was all gone. Her cheeks were permanent roses. The large blue eyes were as bright as stars. The long veil of golden hair retained the glint of sunbeams and the curl of the waves. Anything so airily radiant, so delicately beautiful as she, when one met her face to face, was seldom seen. There was a buoyancy in her movements which was new to them. She looked older, too; had less the expression of a child. She appeared much taller, not because she had grown, but because she had put off the meanness of a little girl. The irremediable deformity still was there; but the heavy veil of hair sheltered it, and, unless a person stood at her side, it was hardly noticeable.</p> 
               <p>Elizabeth kissed her again and again and again. They never had been separated so long. The travellers had come down on the night-boat; breakfast awaited them; after the pleasant meal was over, they must lie down two or three hours, to recruit. While they slept, Lissa beautified the house, and gathered bouquets for the luncheon-table. In the afternoon she wanted to talk with Milla alone. She could ask her a hundred questions about Louis which she would be unwilling to ask her mother. Milla was a little chatterbox who would tell her every thing. Wind her up<pb n="130-131" xml:id="VAC8154-00000064"/> with a hint or two, and she would run the whole round of the past month. Elizabeth followed her into the parlor; but the younger sister, when she began to talk about Newport, got up and went to the piano.</p> 
               <p>"I have not paid my respects to this dear friend, yet," said Milla, whirling away in a little tornado of music.</p> 
               <p>The other listened, well-pleased, content to await a more communicative mood. With that patience of temper which made her so sweet and helpful in the household, Lissa always waited on the moods of those around her.</p> 
               <p>But Milla's fit of communicativeness never came. As days passed, the elder sister perceived a change more striking than the outward, visible symbols. Milla, pretty, <foreign xml:lang="FRA">petite,</foreign> willful, was no longer babyish. The brow was serious, the small mouth firmly set; she was very silent, absorbed in her own thoughts. She never mentioned Dassel, unless others first spoke of him. Lissa thought nothing of that, for the child talked now so little-she had grown reticent upon all subjects. Lissa secretly wondered at her, thinking, "Pretty soon it will be time for her to love, and be loved;" then feeling her heart ache suddenly with the dread that no one would ever love Milla, as the family did, on account of her misfortune.</p> 
               <p>"My darling, my pet! <emph>what</emph> would I not give to see her as blessed as I am?"</p> 
               <p>Ah, Lissa!</p> 
               <p>As much as Milla withdrew herself from others, and especially from her sister, dreaming her own dreams, holding her own thoughts fast, she had never <choice>
                     <sic>seeemed</sic>
                     <corr>seemed</corr>
                  </choice> happier. Her cheek was always red, her eyes always bright, and a soft smile hovering about her lip, betrayed some fountain of pleasure within.</p> 
               <p>At the end of two weeks there was a great commotion at Rose Villa, as Mrs. Grizzle, with surprising originality, had named their residence. The head of the house was home, in a state of dusty and faded splendor, which would require immediate repairs at the hands of the dressmaker; the carriage glittered on the drive; the horses had an inward consciousness of the stable, and snorted "Aha!" the coachman was welcomed by the cook; Grizzle <foreign xml:lang="FRA">pre</foreign> sat down on the front steps, humming, "There's no place like home;" Samuel was afraid Miss Cameron was peeping at his travelling-cap and duster; and Susie, flying like a blue-bird, was perched on the hedge, chattering with Robbie, regardless of her dusty and dinnerless condition.</p> 
               <p>Mr. Dassel had remained in the city, to look after his business affairs a little, but would doubtless be out with Mr. Cameron, to dinner.</p> 
               <p>Lissa got this information, through Robbie, from Susie. Six, nearly seven weeks since they had met!</p> 
               <p>"I think I will change my dress. Louis never liked this lilac tissue. What shall I wear? tell me quickly, Milla, dear. Oh, dear! I hope I am looking well."</p> 
               <p>Milla glanced at the glowing face, with its pure, white forehead, and bright, dark eyes; while her own clouded.</p> 
               <p>"Louis always liked you in white; any one of your white dresses is pretty enough. Wear the white <hi rend="i"/>Foulard with the train; it suits you."</p> 
               <p>"Thanks, sister; I will. Why, my cheeks are as red as fire. I must not be so 'untranquil,' as Louis says. He likes calm. Now, darling, is my hair right?"</p> 
               <p>But Milla had slipped out of the room. Going down, half an hour later, her dark hair shining like satin, a rose on her bosom, and the white train of her dress trailing after her as she walked like a youthful queen, Elizabeth received a shock which drove the too brilliant color from her cheek. No danger, <emph>now,</emph> of too vivid a glow over her maiden beauty.</p> 
               <pb n="132-133" xml:id="VAC8154-00000065"/> 
               <p>She had come silently into the parlor, from the hall, thinking, at first, that no one was in it; but as she approached a side-window, which gave a view of the approaching train, she saw Milla standing there, looking out. <emph>She</emph> had also changed her dress, wearing the blue robe, which set off her pearly complexion and golden hair to the best advantage. Her lips were parted, her face pale with eagerness; but, suddenly, even while Elizabeth gazed upon her in mute astonishment, a rosy splendor illumined her countenance, she pressed her hands on her heart with a sigh, leaning earnestly forward.</p> 
               <p>No, it is not the sunset, bursting through crimson bars, which has so illumined the face of your young sister! Do not deceive yourself, Elizabeth. If ever love and passion shone through a human face, it shone through Milla's then, in that <choice>
                     <sic>ungarded</sic>
                     <corr>unguarded</corr>
                  </choice> moment. Her observer needed not to be told that Louis had arrived-that he was coming up the walk; she saw it in her sister's face, as in a mirror, and her own grew pale, and her hands cold, as she stood there, stricken by a great pain.</p> 
               <p>For to one of Lissa's unselfish nature, tenderly devoted to her frail darling as she was, to know that Milla loved the man who belonged to her, was to be unhappy.</p> 
               <p>"She could not help it;-who could? And he has been so kind to her," she was murmuring in her thought when footsteps sounded on the porch, and Milla, turning, saw the expression on her sister's face.</p> 
               <p>A conscious start, followed by a defiant flash leaping into the blue eyes as unexpectedly as lightning into a summer sky, and then the door was thrown open, and Mr. Cameron came in with Dassel.</p> 
               <p>"Look, Lissa; see what I have brought you!" he cried merrily; and to give the lovers opportunity for quiet greeting, he turned and caught up Milla in his arms.</p> 
                
               <p>"Why, how bright you are, my little girl! you fairly blaze. Look at her, Louis; see what Newport and the ocean have done for her!"</p> 
               <p>Dassel had taken Lissa's hand, and kissed her lips. At his touch the color was coming back; but the revelation which had come to her still held her joy in check. She did not look like the same woman who had swept down the stairs in such a tumult of blissful expectancy.</p> 
               <p>"Is Bettine sorry, or is she proud?" asked the lover, with that airy manner, half-serious, half-playful, which so well became him. "She is like an iceberg."</p> 
               <p>"Oh, not sorry, Louis," the smile coming at last.</p> 
               <p>"Ha! what is that, Mr. Cameron? Look at Milla! Why, to be sure! Little angel, what has happened to her?"</p> 
               <p>He dropped Lissa's hand, and, putting his finger under Milla's chin, raised her face and kissed her.</p> 
               <p>"Why, little one, how you blush! You are not stately, like our Baroness here; but you are sweet enough for two."</p> 
               <p>Again Milla flashed a look at Elizabeth, more of triumph than embarrassment, though her eyes sank beneath Mr. Dassel's.</p> 
               <p>"I wish Louis would not treat her so," thought Lissa. "It is his way; he thinks nothing of it. But Milla is no longer a child. My darling, my poor pet, may your folly be but a transient, girlish fancy!"</p>

               <head>CHAPTER IX.</head> 
               <head type="sub">FROST UPON THE FLOWERS.</head> 
               <p>THE amber sunshine of a day late in September-that mellow, hazy warmth which follows after a light frost-shone into a large chamber, where the sisters were sitting at what should have been happier employment than it had the air of being. They were sewing upon some dainty articles of the <foreign xml:lang="FRA">trousseau.</foreign>
               </p> 
               <p>Elizabeth was pale; shadows lurked under her eyes, and the languid manner in which she plied the needle betrayed little of eagerness or haste. Finally, her hands dropped to her lap, and she sat for a long time staring at the floor, in a reverie.</p> 
               <p>There had been few outward changes in the weeks since Mr. Dassel's return from Newport. He still was with the Grizzles, who were so fond and so proud of him, that there was little likelihood of their ever wanting to give him up-at least, so long as their money lasted. He had resumed Robbie's lessons, though the girls no longer required his instructions in music; he also retained his place as correspondent in the two houses, whose German, French, Spanish, and Italian letters he answered. Altogether, he had a good income; while it was laughable to see the petting and presents he got from good Mrs. Grizzle.</p> 
               <p>Whatever Dassel did, he did thoroughly. Since he had taken Sam in hand, there had been marvellous improvements in that young man. Not that he really had mastered any accomplishment; but he had ceased to torment his poor flute; he did not blunder so frequently in his grammar; he had acquired some dignity and self-knowledge, which dismayed the young cormorants who preyed upon him. The tutor was "a cheap investment," to use old Grizzle's expressive commercial term of value. If he had done nothing but protect Sammy from those lying-in-wait to fatten on verdant and rich young spooneys like this one, the tutor's cost <emph>paid.</emph>
               </p> 
               <p>If Sam wanted a game of billiards, Mr. Dassel was ready to humor him; and Mr. Dassel was the best player Sam ever had seen. The youth never played any game, now, except with his tutor. If Sam went to the theatre or opera, it was with Dassel's companionship.</p> 
               <p>Under his protecting hand he often had gained courage to visit the Camerons, where he would sit a whole evening, nearly mute (unless his tutor drew him out), and seldom permitting his thoughts to stray from Elizabeth, for whom his love-passion struck deeper and stronger roots with every wind of doubt and dismay which shook it. Poor Sam! his was a melancholy example of blight in the green fruit. He threatened to wither and drop off before he had known what it was "to be a rose."</p> 
               <p>The thing which most availed to avert this threatened calamity, was the continued visit of Miss Bayles, who, having undertaken the family-portraits, was obliged to come out to the villa, whenever not employed at photographs, and give her subjects all her spare time. She was blocking out Sam, now; and, as she mixed the flesh-tints for his face, she told him that an unrequited passion was a most becoming thing for a person with too much color; Sam was "toning down;" his features were slowly but surely coming out of their mask of adolescent fat; he would be good-looking in a year or two!</p> 
               <pb n="136-137" xml:id="VAC8154-00000067"/> 
               <p>Mr. Dassel paid considerable quiet attention to the plainly dressed girl, who seldom left the room assigned her, when there was company in the house. He met her once with a man in whom he felt a deep interest, and he made a study of the artist, as he did of many other characters.</p> 
               <p>At Mr. Cameron's, Dassel was still the welcome guest-the brother, and son. Not very much was said relating to the approaching marriage. Mrs. Cameron regarded her daughter as full young enough to take upon herself the responsibilities of wedded life; and if the couple were happy in their present relations, she almost hoped they would delay to change them.</p> 
               <p>Neither of the parents had eyes to see the drama played under their roof, with their two daughters acting parts against each other; for the girls had all the pride of high-toned, sensitive natures, and carefully hid all tokens from loving observers.</p> 
               <p>Could Elizabeth tell her mother, who treated Louis with such kind affection, that he no longer spoke of the wedding-day-neither of fulfilment nor postponement? She might, when the time came which would admit of no farther delay; but, as yet, she had shed her tears in secret, preserving such a cheerful gayety in the family, that it was long before her friends noticed that the outline of the oval cheek was growing thin, and its color fading.</p> 
               <p>"Why do we do this work?" asked Elizabeth, raising her eyes out of that long reverie; "I shall never need these articles, Milla."</p> 
               <p>"What do you mean, sister?"</p> 
               <p>"I mean, that I shall never marry, Milla."</p> 
               <p>Lissa's eyes were on her face with a look which Milla could not bear; she flung the lace from her lap, and arose, and looked out of the window.</p> 
               <p>"I must talk with you, pet; I have been silent too long."</p> 
               <p>"Well, Lisa?"</p> 
                
               <p>Milla's face was hidden from her sister, who went on-</p> 
               <p>"Mr. Dassel has allowed me to perceive that he no longer loves me,-even if he ever did, which I doubt. Under such circumstances the engagement must be broken, and the sooner papa and mamma are told of it, the better."</p> 
               <p>The curtain shook in Milla's hand. Presently she turned a white face, down which the tears were streaming.</p> 
               <p>"Do you blame me for it, dear Lissa?"</p> 
               <p>"Not the least bit in the world, my darling."</p> 
               <p>The next moment Milla was sobbing on Lissa's breast, whose own tears, large and slow, were dropping in her hair.</p> 
               <p>"I never, never, never meant it," murmured Milla, between these sobs. "I did not mean that either of you should ever know <emph>I</emph> loved him, nor take him away from <emph>you,</emph> Lissa. Tell me, dear, that you do not care, that you do not love him any more, that it will not kill you, and then I shall be so happy. Oh, Lissa, you have always been so good to me, I would not injure you for worlds."</p> 
               <p>"Calm yourself, Milla. You will not, cannot injure me. It is he who has done the cruel work, <emph>for both of us,</emph> my pet. I can bear my own trouble, but I cannot bear yours."</p> 
               <p>"What trouble have I?" asked Milla, turning her clear eyes upon her sister's, "except the fear that I have wronged you? If you will tell me that you do not care much for him, that you are not offended with me, I shall be perfectly happy."</p> 
               <p>"I am not offended with you; I pity you, my darling. I would hold up my own heart as a shield to save yours from a fatal wound. Milla, you are deceived in Mr. Dassel, as I have been."</p> 
               <p>"Deceived in him! Now, Elizabeth, it is you who are unjust. I am very sorry that he did not understand himself, sooner; but, surely, it is nothing degrading to him that he should love me!" bitterly.</p> 
               <pb n="138-139" xml:id="VAC8154-00000068"/> 
               <p>"Has he told you that he loves you?"</p> 
               <p>Lissa's cheek was white as she asked the question; she caught her breath with sudden pain. She truly believed that she had conquered herself so far that this knowledge would not affect her so cruelly; but, alas! that brave, generous heart could not so soon wholly banish its virgin-dream of love as to hear, without a quiver, that Louis had already put his perfidy into words. The pang, too, was a double one. Since she had lost faith in him, her whole anxiety was to open her sister's eyes to his true character. She had not supposed that he really had said any thing of importance to Milla, and she wished to put the child on her guard, when the temptation should come.</p> 
               <p>Milla hesitated; her cheek flamed scarlet; but, the time had come when the battle must be fought; if it left her and Lissa friends, well and good; if not, her choice was made.</p> 
               <p>"He did tell me so, weeks ago, in Newport, Lissa. Do not blame him; do not call him false. He could not help it; he saw, I suppose, straight into my thoughts, for he has had experience of life, and reads every body. He found me weeping, one day, and drew forth from me the cause of my tears. I said, passionately, that it was because I was ugly, deformed-that no one ever would love me-that Lissa was beloved, was happy; but I-oh, I was so miserable! And he smoothed my hair, and calmed me, and told me I was mistaken,-that <emph>one person</emph> did love me, deeply, silently, more than any perfectly beautiful woman ever was loved,-for he loved not only my loveliness, but my deformity. It was only just enough, he said, to make his tenderness perfect. But that person was bound, in honor, to another-a sweet girl whom he respected, whose truth and purity were exquisite, and whom, before he saw womanhood develop in me, he <emph>thought</emph> he loved. But, her nature was cold, self-contained; mine was impulsive, unreflecting. I would die for the man I loved, <emph>and so I would,</emph> Lissa! My devotion to him had awakened his own. But, we must say nothing; we must suffer in silence, for we could not and would not wrong her, so dear to both of us. Only, I must never weep again, because I was not loved; let it suffice me to know that I had filled a strong soul, one not easily touched, to its very core, with sacredest love."</p> 
               <p>"And you believed him, sister?"</p> 
               <p>"Yes, Lissa. I trembled with joy and sorrow. I was afraid you loved him more than he thought; but, otherwise, I was too happy. Tell me that you will soon forget him, that you can some time become interested in some other man, and not a cloud will remain. Please, Lissa, say so! You do not know what a load it will take from my breast."</p> 
               <p>The fair face was turned up pleadingly, the small hands clasped, as the wistful eyes sought to read those of the elder sister.</p> 
               <p>"Milla, my dearest! I do no longer love that man, because I have ceased to respect him." Here she paused. Useless to darken another's life with a glimpse at the desolation which the destruction of that love had wrought: pride held her lips; but duty urged her to warn another from similar suffering. <emph>She</emph> was strong and well, and could bear terrible disappointment; but this frail little sister of hers,-this delicate flower, born only for tempered sunshine-would to God her sheltering affection could clasp her away from harm!</p> 
               <p>"He is not good, he is not true. He is false to both of us, sister."</p> 
               <p>"How can you speak so of Louis?" exclaimed Milla, indignantly, rising from her knees, and walking back and forth though the room. "Lissa, I did not think you would be revengeful."</p> 
               <p>"It is hard to bear such a construction put upon my conduct<pb n="140-141" xml:id="VAC8154-00000069"/> duct, but I shall not get angry with you, little sister. I do not wonder you are deceived in Mr. Dassel. He would deceive older and wiser heads. I only want to save you, Milla, from future distress. I have the key, now, to his character, and can read it without mistake. Believe me, he is no truer to you than to me."</p> 
               <p>"What object has he, then, in <emph>pretending</emph> to love me?"</p> 
               <p>"I do not know; but I have my suspicion. I think he is after your fortune, Milla. Remember, you are an heiress."</p> 
               <p>"As if a man who forsook wealth for his country's sake would care for my paltry forty or fifty thousand dollars, at the best! Absurd! you are unreasonable, sister; jealousy blinds you. Besides, he has never asked me to marry him,-never sought to break his engagement with you. He is too honorable."</p> 
               <p>"<emph>Honorable!</emph> oh, Milla. He has not broken his engagement, <emph>in words,</emph> it is true. He has too much <foreign xml:lang="FRA">finesse</foreign> for that. He has but loosened the chain until it drops off of itself. He gives me to understand that it is irksome, and waits <emph>for me</emph> to be first to cast aside the unwelcome links. He will be full of regret, very gentlemanly, but he will be free to sue for your hand. I do not say that he will not marry you, Milla: I think <emph>he will;</emph> but it will be for money, not for love."</p> 
               <p>"I understand you, Lissa Cameron," cried her companion, whose face flushed and darkened with an expression entirely new to it. "You are not too delicate to let me see that you do not believe any man can really love me-<emph>me!</emph> the deformed, the repelling! Am I then so utterly loathsome that even my own sister tells me it is impossible <emph>I</emph> should awaken affection? Is it <emph>pity,</emph> then, only, which my friends felt for me? Am I so unfortunate as to live only upon compassion? I thank you, Lissa, for the delicate reminder."</p> 
                
               <p>"Calm yourself, Milla. I meant nothing of the kind. Who ever was loved, if not you? Father, mother, brother, sister, would lie down for you to walk on their hearts, if it would make your pathway softer. Our arms are a cordon of love about you. We all live for your sake. We will never desert you. Oh, be content with us, and our affection! Believe me, I am only afraid that Louis will make you unhappy."</p> 
               <p>Milla scarcely heeded this tearful appeal. She had paused before the pier-glass, and was gazing at herself with a strange smile. Her blue eyes were glittering with excitement, her cheeks rose-red; the beautiful, trailing splendor of her hair flowed down either shoulder and floated about her delicate waist; she lifted her round, white arm, so small, yet so perfectly moulded, with its dimpled hand playing with the golden masses of tresses.</p> 
               <p>"Unless this mirror flatters me more than any man dare do, I must confess that I do not find myself so hideous. It remains for my sister to accuse me of it. Nay! I will confront the worst, as he must see it when I am his wife,"-and with a sweep of the girlish arm, she caught up her hair, and, half-turning, gazed defiantly at the protuberance which deformed her shoulders. "Is it so bad? Even with that curse, I am fairer than many. I do not regret it, for Louis loves me the more for it; <emph>he has said so.</emph>"</p> 
               <p>"Milla, you are strangely changed. I do not know you, to-day."</p> 
               <p>"I am no longer a child, I know. I am astonished at myself. It is this consciousness of my own development which determines me to judge for myself. I love Mr. Dassel; I shall never love any other man; nor will any other man ever love me. You hurt me with your hints, Lissa, but I know their cause. <emph>No common man</emph> could overcome his prejudice at my deformity; and a selfish one would be afraid of my being burdensome. Louis, alone, is<pb n="142-143" xml:id="VAC8154-00000070"/> neither commonplace nor selfish. He delights to sacrifice his convenience to my helplessness. Can you not, then, spare him to me? Oh, my dear sister!" coming down from her angry exaltation to a melting mood, "give him to me, I implore you; give him freely, in such a manner that I feel that you are not envious of my great blessing. Think of it! Many men will worship you. You are so beautiful, so good, you can have whom you like. You will be always followed and courted. But I-I have only Louis."</p> 
               <p>"I make no claims upon him, Milla. I shall tell him, at our next interview, that I must withdraw from our engagement. Were you dead, this hour, and should he return to me, I would never have more to do with him. Let not that stand between us. It is only for your best happiness that I am anxious. You have been loved and cherished as few are. It is a trial for any girl to pass away from the tender solicitudes of a mother into the care of a stranger; for you, how doubly hazardous it will be! Only the most gentle and tireless consideration can save you from illness and repining."</p> 
               <p>"Who is there more like a woman in thoughtfulness than Dassel?"</p> 
               <p>"You think so, Milla. I did, also; but that has passed. I believe he has a cold and subtle nature."</p> 
               <p>"Ungenerous and unforgiving again, Lissa. To end this all, let me tell you now," lifting her right hand above her head, "if I <emph>knew</emph> that Mr. Dassel was all you imagine him, and that I should never live three months after I became his wife, I still would marry him!"</p> 
               <p>"Milla!"</p> 
               <p>"Yes, joyfully. To be his wife one week, I would go to the grave! That is what it is to really love! I told you you knew nothing of love-such love. You will not seek to thwart me now that you know this?"</p> 
                
               <p>"I have nothing more to say, to-day. I can only hope that God will be more merciful than man, to my pet lamb."</p> 
               <p>"Promise me that you will not seek to prejudice our parents against him-that you will smooth over the broken engagement, so as to make it apparent that he was not to blame for preferring me."</p> 
               <p>"I shall certainly do what I think will conduce to your truest happiness. Will you not go away, now, and let me rest awhile? I am very tired."</p> 
               <p>In truth, there was a weary pallor over the grave face which touched the younger sister with remorse, as she noticed it.</p> 
               <p>"Yes, I will go away. I have been and shall be very selfish, I know. But, <emph>all</emph> is at stake with me. If I believe that you suffer as I should, under the circumstances, I would kill myself rather than do this thing. Some good man will yet make you happy; I feel it," kissing her. "Lissa, is not that his voice?" starting up, a sudden light beaming through every feature.</p> 
               <p>"It is. Go down, if you will, Milla. I cannot see him at present. This evening, if he remains, I will talk with him."</p> 
               <p>Kissing her again, Milla glided from the room, slipping down to sun herself in happiness, forgetful of the shadow on her sister's heart.</p> 
               <p>"This is what we have made her, by too much love," murmured Elizabeth, as she noted how eagerly her sister sprang away. "She does not mean to be selfish; her whole soul overflows with love; but it is all impulsive, unreasoning. I am afraid we have pursued the wrong course. We have shielded instead of hardening her. It is fearful to see how she abandons herself to this passion;"-then, as the misery and humiliation of her own position returned to her, driven out by the still heavier pang which<pb n="144-145" xml:id="VAC8154-00000071"/> she felt for her sister, she sighed wearily, resting her arms on a chair near by, and dropping her head upon them, remaining thus in almost a fainting condition, exhausted by the stormy interlude through which she had passed.</p> 
               <p>"This is not the preparation wherewith to meet my evening's task," she murmured, raising her head, after more than an hour of painful mental struggle. The dark circle around her eyes had deepened; her movements were languid and heavy. As she was about to arise to dress for dinner, Mrs. Cameron came in. She looked alarmed at the wretched countenance which met her gaze, although Elizabeth smiled as she met her eye.</p> 
               <p>"Mr. Dassel has been here an hour or more,-did you not know it, Lissa? Milla is entertaining him until you come down. I suppose he will stay to dinner, as usual. How do you get along with the tucks, my dear?"</p> 
               <p>"We have not sewed much this afternoon, mother."</p> 
               <p>"Elizabeth, something is wrong between you and Louis. What is it, my child? Some foolish lovers' quarrel? Tell me all about it, for you look wretched. I have seen it this month past."</p> 
               <p>"Oh, mother, is this <emph>all</emph> you have seen?"</p> 
               <p>"What do you mean?" asked Mrs. Cameron in alarm.</p> 
               <p>For answer Lissa threw herself on her mother's neck, weeping there silently until her nervous excitement had flowed away in tears, and she could command her words and voice.</p> 
               <p>"Do you not see how it is all going, mother?"</p> 
               <p>"I have seen nothing except constraint upon your part, and a rather forced gayety upon his. What is it, my darling? Do not hesitate to take your mother into your confidence."</p> 
               <p>"Do you not see that Louis and Milla love one another? that he made a mistake in choosing me?"</p> 
                
               <p>"Louis and Milla?" repeated her listener, like one in a dream. It was evident that the idea had never before had place in her brain.</p> 
               <p>"It is easily enough seen, mother."</p> 
               <p>"Milla-Milla!" repeated Mrs. Cameron, still in the same dreamy tone; then, with a sigh more like a suppressed groan, she said: "Alas! must she, also, take up the burden? I had hoped she would always remain our baby-our thoughtless, happy child!"</p> 
               <p>She remained silent some time, so affected at thought of her darling's change of life and feeling, as to forget her older daughter. But, a realization of all implied in that communication at length dawned upon her.</p> 
               <p>"And you, my child?" she cried. "Surely, Mr. Dassel cannot be so untruthful, so unmanly-"</p> 
               <p>"Mother, do not blame him, unless you would kill Milla. I have been talking with her. She acknowledges that she loves him, and will not give him up. Perhaps he is <emph>not</emph> to blame. Milla is very sweet, very attractive. If I believe that he truly regarded her, and would cherish her as <emph>we</emph> have cherished her, I should not be sorry."</p> 
               <p>"Don't say that, my child. Your face tells a different story."</p> 
               <p>"Of course it was a shock-at first-" with trembling lips, "and Milla was so passionate and strange that she grieved and alarmed me. Believe me, it is more that than any thing else. Beg father to be merciful with Louis. If my parents, after reflection, can sanction this marriage, I shall not be miserable long, I do assure you, my dear mother. All I ask is, that the marriage be not consummated until Milla has time to <emph>prove</emph> him: for I cannot forbear saying that I am afraid we have all been deceived in him!"</p> 
               <p>"It is no wonder she thinks so!" mused Mrs. Cameron.<pb n="146-147" xml:id="VAC8154-00000072"/> "Mr. Dassel certainly has been inexcusably fickle. Milla! that baby! Ah, what a thing it is to be the mother of girls!"</p> 
               <p>"I must dress, mamma. Do I really look so bad? I do not wish Mr. Dassel to think that I-I am unhappy on his account."</p> 
               <p>"What otherwise should he think, indeed! Does he suppose that you promised to be his wife without caring for him? That would be really more mortifying than that you should suffer in giving him up. Yes, child, you do look pale and haggard. Keep your room, if you wish, and let me order your dinner served here. I am sure your head aches, and I can say so truthfully."</p> 
               <p>"It <emph>does</emph> ache, mother; I would like to shut myself up in darkness and silence. But, I am proud; I am afraid Louis will suspect the cause. And then, I wish to speak with him, this evening-to break this wretched engagement, and have it over."</p> 
               <p>"You shall not undergo that ordeal, Elizabeth. Would you not rather that I should speak with him?"</p> 
               <p>"Oh, yes, indeed, mother, if you will. I think, too, that you can judge more correctly of his motives in winning poor Milla to love him as she does. If I thought he really <emph>loved</emph> her, as I have said, I should be reconciled. I am so afraid it is her money. What do you think?"</p> 
               <p>"We have never had reason to think Mr. Dassel mercenary. One of his greatest charms has been his entire freedom from worldly selfishness and the greed of riches. Sacrificing his own immense estates to his love of liberty, since he came here he has seemed to be satisfied with the consciousness that he was a gentleman, without seeking to force his claims upon others, to set forth his true accomplishments with the glitter of money and rank. It is his modesty, his self-denial, his good temper, good sense-"</p> 
                
               <p>"Mother-mother!"</p> 
               <p>"Alas, Lissa, I forgot that, in defending Louis, I was wringing your heart. If it will make your disappointment less bitter to believe ill of him, I shall wish you to think every thing bad of him. But, it will be a severe blow to us when we have to condemn Mr. Dassel; we have taken him into our affections, as a member of our family; it will be almost like rejecting one of our own blood, to reject him. This is a distressing business; yet, Milla may be the one who has done all the mischief. She is so childish, so ignorant of the world, she may have betrayed her foolish fondness to Mr. Dassel, and placed him in an embarrassing position, without his being in the least untrue to you. Has he expressed to you a desire to break the engagement?"</p> 
               <p>"No, mother. But he has not referred, for weeks, to our approaching marriage-" in a very low voice-"he has treated me with a gay gallantry, with a studied deference, which has been intolerable. I wish he had possessed the manliness to avow the truth at first; it would have saved me much."</p> 
               <p>"I shall make him speak out plainly, for once," exclaimed Mrs. Cameron, flushing. "Perhaps, though, your father will be the one to attend to this matter."</p> 
               <p>"I would rather you would see him first, mother. It is only for Milla's sake. If it were not for her, I should wish father to break off the friendship at once."</p> 
               <p>"This is a black cloud which has come over our prosperity so suddenly. I still hope it will pass as quickly as it came. Louis loves you, yet; I am convinced of it. For you are too sensitive. And Milla is but a child! What can she know of love?"</p> 
               <p>"You have but to hear her talk, mother, and you will not call her a child any more. As to Louis, knowing what I do of my sister's feelings, if he were still my most devoted<pb n="148-149" xml:id="VAC8154-00000073"/> lover, I would never marry him. It has all gone by. I only ask never again to have it referred to. Settle it with him as you will. There, dear mother, is the summons to dinner. Do not send any thing up. I wish to rest, not to eat."</p> 
               <p>"But a cup of tea?"</p> 
               <p>"Nothing to-night, dear mother. I shall lock my door, and, perhaps, shall fall asleep; that will cure my headache."</p> 
               <p>She did fall asleep, after hours of dreary wretchedness, to wake in the silent watches of the night, and find the throbbing of her temples somewhat calmed. A little sleep might cure her headache, but what should cure her heartache-that dull, constant, miserable pain which had taken the place of that summer joyance in which it had lain, suffused like a rose in its odors? She heard a low murmur from the parlor underneath, and recognizing her mother's voice, with that of Dassel's, she shuddered and trembled, with a cold sensation which left her feet like ice and her forehead like fire.</p> 
               <p>Mr. Dassel had brought upon himself a trying ordeal. It might be supposed to be painful to him to think of having an explanation with Elizabeth; but, it was a still severer ordeal to meet the mother of the two young creatures upon whom he had exercised his powers of fascination. He saw immediately that the hour had come, when Mrs. Cameron-her husband being engaged with Robbie in a game of chess in the library-summoned Sabrina to attend Milla to her room, and then, very gravely, desired him to take a seat on the same sofa with herself.</p> 
               <p>Mrs. Cameron had never looked gentler, paler, more quiet than then. But, when a mother summons one who has wronged her children to the judgment-seat, there is something awful on her brow, from which he of a guilty conscience will shrink. And Louis Dassel, were his conscience restless, would have more than a mother's rights to remember-a generous trust betrayed, a noble hospitality selfishly misused, confidence and aid repaid with ingratitude.</p> 
               <p>He came at her summons, waiting in silence for her to speak. Had he been that being of duplicity and subtleness which he <emph>must</emph> have been to have played a false part in that family, would he not now seek to divert this burdensome silence by forced attempts at gayety-by affected nonchalance, or, otherwise, by humble and penitent manners?</p> 
               <p>It would seem so. Mrs. Cameron expected one or the other of these three moods. She looked up at him, and found his clear blue eyes fixed on her face, a little anxiously, a little sadly, yet neither defiant nor humble. That composure which ever distinguished him-a self-contained and self-poised manner, quite different from the usual merely indifferent calmness of good-breeding-did not forsake him now; he neither trifled with his watch-chain nor turned the ring on his finger, nor in any manner betrayed embarrassment. Like the blue eyes of a child when it has come upon a problem which its infant reasoning cannot expound, were the eyes of Mr. Dassel. Mrs. Cameron never felt more thoroughly than at that moment, how warm and candid was his nature; how boyish still, through all his worldly experience, were the freshness and enthusiasm which characterized his race, and which he possessed to an eminent degree.</p> 
               <p>That rigid hand of pain which had grasped her heart-strings all the evening, relaxed a little; the severity of her mood softened; she even found herself, before she spoke, wondering if the scene with Elizabeth were not all a dream. How could Louis, out of the elements of his frank and noble nature, work so much woe? Yet confusion and entanglement were there, and the threads must be straightened.</p> 
               <pb n="150-151" xml:id="VAC8154-00000074"/> 
               <p>"Mr. Dassel, I have observed something amiss between Lissa and yourself the past few weeks. This afternoon I questioned her, and learn that, for very serious reasons, she desires to be released from her engagement."</p> 
               <p>"Do you think that she really desires it?" he asked, earnestly.</p> 
               <p>"Yes, Louis, I do. Words have been spoken, feelings have arisen, which render her marriage with you a thing absolutely impossible. This is her decision, which she wished me to make known to you."</p> 
               <p>A single large tear rolled down Mr. Dassel's face, and plashed upon the emerald ring on his left hand; he did not seem to be aware of it; he struggled with some inward passion, quietly; until, suddenly, his self-control deserted him, and he sank on his knees beside Mrs. Cameron, burying his face in the sofa. She almost hoped this to be a convulsion of despair at Elizabeth's decision,-to hear him cry out that he loved her, and would not be put away without a reason. But, this was not what he had to say. His words were:</p> 
               <p>"I feel myself an ingrate, Mrs. Cameron. I wish I had remained in my own country-never darkened this, the loveliest, purest family-circle into which I ever was received, with the shadow which seems to rest inexorably upon me. I know what reason Bettine has to despise me. It was she herself, it was all of you, who taught me to love your youngest daughter. Every one must love Milla! No care was too tender, no protection too gentle, for her. I did my part, with the others. I guessed not, dreamed not, that, in return, I was awakening in the bosom of that exquisite child a sentiment, a passion, stronger than her life. It was only when, with tears and sobs which I was afraid would shake the frail blossom from its stem of life, that she herself avowed this, unsolicited by me, unaware of what she was about to say-that I realized what we had done. Simultaneously with her avowal, a lightning-flash of revelation went through my own being. Dearly as I esteemed, as I regarded Bettine, above all women I had ever met, I suddenly became aware that this delicate, sweet flower of your family, this clinging, childish, yet impassioned Milla, so lovable, so unfortunate, had intertwined herself with every fibre of my being. It seemed to me, then, as if I could no more live without her, than she without me. I suffered acute distress. Ah, madam! if I could only see that Bettine was indifferent, all would be changed! I should then be as happy as I now am wretched. Why must it have been so? Why did I come here at all? Why were you all so good to me, a stranger, an alien? Believe me, I tried to persuade Milla that I was her dear brother, that she should be happy and satisfied when Bettine and myself were married and gave her our double affection. But, she is as wayward and jealous, as she is utterly fascinating and unworldly. Ah, me! that child! I would suffer untold pangs to save one hour of her life from unhappiness!"</p> 
               <p>He raised his head; the sweat stood on his forehead.</p> 
               <p>"Rise, Mr. Dassel," said Mrs. Cameron. Her voice trembled, but what could she say in his condemnation? Was it not Milla,-impetuous, willful, <emph>selfish</emph> (made so, without blame to herself, by too fond indulgence),-who had wrought the trouble? Milla, for whom her elder sister, meekly, patiently, ever had given up her own tastes and wishes when the caprices or comfort of the other demanded the sacrifice?</p> 
               <p>"We would all do that," she said, at last, in response; "perhaps we have done it too much. Her misfortune has made her so sacred and dear to us. Elizabeth, too, has always waited upon her sister. She has deprived herself of<pb n="152-153" xml:id="VAC8154-00000075"/> many pleasures to linger by the invalid's side. And now, it seems that she must make still heavier sacrifices! Well, God will bless her for it-will be her comforter. Elizabeth has a heroic heart; she will not be crushed by this. Mr. Dassel, I can say no more, to-night. Leave me, now, and do not return here for a day or two; I must talk with Milla, before we see you again."</p> 
               <p>"I will go away forever, if such is your decision, Mrs. Cameron," standing a moment before her with bowed head. "I honor, esteem you so highly, it grieves me to see you-disturbed-" Breaking off abruptly, he turned and went away.</p> 
               <p>As Mrs. Cameron passed Lissa's chamber, on her way to her own, she tapped lightly on the door, and Lissa, arising to open it, was clasped in her mother's arms, whose tears fell on her face.</p> 
               <p>"It is all true, my darling, what you feared. Your engagement is at an end. My child, God chastens whom he loves. You ever have been a faithful and unselfish sister. It seems that Milla calls for yet severer trials of your patience and love. Do not refuse them. She can never enjoy a long life, at the best. If you should survive her, it will be sweet for you to recall all that you have suffered for her sake. And, Lissa, dear, believe me, all these trials of your character, now, will but fit you to make a nobler woman. It is only by experience of trouble that we learn true sympathy with others. Your mother holds you precious and dear above all her treasures-<emph>above all,</emph> Lissa-even above that fragile sister, for whom, yet, we must be most solicitous; you are to be my friend and companion, upon whom I shall rely. God be with you, my daughter; I shall pray that you may sleep sweetly, and be made strong."</p> 
               <p>Her mother was gone, and Elizabeth crept back to bed almost comforted. That assurance of her mother's love and reliance came in due season to uphold her wounded pride and outraged self-respect. Yet, she felt a wild desire to get away,-to be, for a season, out of sight of Milla, and of <emph>him.</emph>

               <head type="sub">THE SIDE-SCENES.</head> 
               <p>SUSIE GRIZZLE was like a quail, forever on the fence, caying, "Bob White! Bob White!" except that the fence was a hedge, and her cry, "Robbie Cameron."</p> 
               <p>"What do you want now, Miss Grizzle? I shall be obliged to walk on the other side the house, altogether, when I wish to commit my lessons, you're such a tease."</p> 
               <p>"Fie! Robbie Cameron! you're <emph>very</emph> independent!"</p> 
               <p>"Like the third candidate for Congress, I suppose."</p> 
               <p>"I don't know about that. But, you're not what Madame Parly-Voo calls, she-val-reek."</p> 
               <p>"No, I don't care much for any kind of <emph>shees.</emph>"</p> 
               <p>"Oh, ho! that's because I'm a little girl. But, I'm growing fast, Master Rob. I was measured, yesterday, and I'm an <emph>inch</emph> taller than the mark pa made last spring. Mr. Dassel is very polite to me; he says I have stolen three quarters of his heart, already."</p> 
               <p>"I wish you had the other quarter of the mildewed thing, and we were rid of it entirely."</p> 
               <p>"<foreign xml:lang="FRA">Quoi?</foreign>" exclaimed Susie, opening her hazle eyes to their fullest extent. "Don't you like Mr. Dassel, Robbie? I do-<emph>immensely!</emph> He tells me such funny stories. <emph>We</emph> think he's going to marry your sister. I like to make Sam jealous, by telling him so. He asked Mr. Dassel, yesterday, right out, and Mr. Dassel said '<emph>No!</emph>'"</p> 
               <p>"He did, did he!" repeated Robbie, grinding his teeth; "neither is he, I can tell you. I'd rather she'd have Sam, of the two."</p> 
               <p>"Oh, really! Very flattering to Sam! Don't go away, Robbie; I want to tell you something-<emph>really,</emph> something, this time. If Mr. Dassel is not engaged to Miss Cameron, I do believe he is making up to Miss Bayles. I've suspected it for more than a week."</p> 
               <p>"Who's Miss Bayles?"</p> 
               <p>"The lady-artist, you know, who is painting us."</p> 
               <p>"Oh, yes; I remember now."</p> 
               <p>"She's a nice-looking girl, with dark eyes, and she's made a sweet picture of me. Come over and see it, Robbie. But, I wanted to tell you"-whispering-"they are walking up and down, behind those evergreens, now, just like a pair of lovers. Climb up here, and perhaps you can see them; she's looking down on the ground-blushing, I suppose-and he's talking to her with all his might."</p> 
               <p>"Don't make a spy of yourself, Susie, it's not lady-like. Besides, don't call me to share your discoveries. I don't care what Mr. Dassel does or does not do,-so, good evening," and he ran away before she could think of any other important declaration to detain him.</p> 
               <p>It was after dinner, and, in the shortening autumn days, nearly night. If it had not been twilight, Susie's sharp eyes would have detected the fact that Robbie had been crying. He was in no mood to listen to her prattle, yet he clenched his hand, as he walked away, over what the child had told him of Mr. Dassel.</p> 
               <p>"I wish Milla could catch him at it," he muttered.</p> 
               <p>The boy suspected much of the drama being enacted in the house; he had not been blind to his father's pre-occupied air, his mother's unusual paleness and gravity, nor to the weary, worn air of Lissa, so changed from her late expression of sweet happiness. Mr. Dassel had not<pb n="156-157" xml:id="VAC8154-00000077"/> been in for three days, and this might have led him to think that there had been a quarrel, had he not, by merest chance, overheard a sentence spoken by his mother, in the library, to Mr. Cameron, about Louis and Milla. The clue had been enough. He understood all that was transpiring. As he walked about, under the trees, in the dim light, his heart swelled with rage and sorrow; he muttered to himself some dreadful things, which would have paled even Dassel's cheek, had he heard them.</p> 
               <p>Presently, as the boy stood there, he caught the flutter of Elizabeth's dress, as she stepped through a bay-window, and wandered off into a secluded portion of the grounds.</p> 
               <p>There were but five acres in Mr. Cameron's place; but a portion of this was so wild and rocky, and its naturally romantic aspect had been so encouraged, that one might find therein a solitude almost as profound as in some vaster estate. Robbie knew that she was going to the "Lookout," a summer-house perched on the rocks, surrounded by evergreens and clambered over by vines, where persons sitting, could watch the silver breadth of the Hudson, themselves isolated from all observation. It was a secure spot in which to hide a wounded heart, when, worn out with wearing the mask of pride, it must be laid aside for a breathing-space. Robbie stood a long time gazing in that direction; he was pondering an important matter, forming a resolution that might shake the courage of an older mind.</p> 
               <p>A soft wind crackled the leaves, now fragrant with the touch of frost; a dim half-moon hung over the river, wrapped in that haze which is not so much mist as smoke, which leaves the grass dry, and drops no dew upon the veil of night.</p> 
               <p>Half-an-hour, perhaps, Robbie stood, pondering; then he followed his sister's steps, until a low sound of suppressed weeping almost caused him to turn back. Strengthening himself, however, with a reminder of the importance of his mission, he continued on.</p> 
               <p>"Robbie, you frightened me!" exclaimed Lissa, as he stood in the summer-house door, between her and the moonlit outer world. "Why do you follow me here. I came for solitude."</p> 
               <p>"I know it, dear Lissa, but, I wished to say something to you which has been on my mind a long time-which I felt it my duty to make known to you. Do you remember once, in the garden, while mamma was at Newport, I tried to tell you, but you discouraged me?"</p> 
               <p>"Yes], I remember, Robbie."</p> 
               <p>"Lissa, I have taken a fancy that I would like to go to Germany for a year or two, and study there. You know father expects to place me in college, after Christmas: do you think it would cost any more to send me to a German university?"</p> 
               <p>"I do not know, brother, I am sure; nor whether mother would be willing for you to go so far away. What put the idea in your head? I never heard you mention it before."</p> 
               <p>Robbie was sitting by her side, his hand in hers; she felt it grow cold, as she asked the question; he did not reply for some minutes, and then there seemed no relevancy in his answer-</p> 
               <p>"Have you broken with Mr. Dassel, Lissa?"</p> 
               <p>"Yes, Robbie."</p> 
               <p>"Is he going to marry Milla?"</p> 
               <p>"I do not know; not very soon. It is not settled."</p> 
               <p>"Promise me one thing, Lissa, that you will do all in your power to prevent it, until I have gone to Germany, and you have heard from me there."</p> 
               <p>"Are you 'daft,' Robbie?" asked the girl, using one of her father's expressions, with which he sometimes recalled his Scottish descent.</p> 
               <pb n="158-159" xml:id="VAC8154-00000078"/> 
               <p>"No sister, not 'daft' at all, but burdened with a dreadful secret. It has almost killed me, these long, <emph>long</emph> weeks. It has preyed upon me, night and day, literally."</p> 
               <p>"Poor Robbie! I have noticed you not so frolicsome as is your wont. Do not be afraid to confide in me; if you have any thing really weighing upon your heart, let me share the burden."</p> 
               <p>Again his fingers grew cold in her clasp. He leaned his head on her shoulder, and whispered his dread communication, whatever it was, in her ear; and Lissa, so quiet, usually so undemonstrative, shrieked aloud as the words almost burned themselves into her brain.</p> 
               <p>"Robbie! how strange of a mere boy like you!" she shuddered, when she was able to speak.</p> 
               <p>"I have never doubted it, one moment, from that day to this, Elizabeth. It has made me feel old-the certainty, and the fear of the consequences. If you had sat where I did, and read his face, you would be as convinced of it as I am."</p> 
               <p>"You are mistaken! you must be mistaken!"</p> 
               <p>"I do not ask you to believe me, Lissa; I did not expect that you would, or could, until I had proved my assertion. But, I felt that I must warn you. This thing, which has happened, has been a God-send to me, for it has decided me, after such long hesitation. Blame me, hate me, in the meantime; but help me to persuade father to send me to Germany, and the only other favor I ask of you, is to delay Milla's marriage until you hear from me."</p> 
               <p>A long silence ensued; finally Elizabeth said:</p> 
               <p>"Mother will not consent to Milla's marriage, until she is older and stronger than she is now; so that need not worry you. I will use such influence as I have, to persuade father to let you go abroad;-but, understand, distinctly, Robbie, that it is only that you may convince yourself of your fearful ful mistake. It is dreadful to me to think of your having cherished such an illusion; I cannot account for it; I feel that your mind must be disabused of it, if any of our family is to enjoy happiness any more. Why, Robbie, I almost shrink from you, as I would from one insane. And you so young!"</p> 
               <p>"So be it," he answered, sadly. "Perhaps I <emph>am</emph> a strange boy, Lissa; but there is one thing upon which you may rely in my character, and that is, my devotion to the interests of those I love. I am but a boy in years; but I feel as much called upon to protect the happiness and honor of the women of my family, as if I were older. And if any living man dare inflict injury upon Milla-upon her health, peace of mind, or happiness, in any manner-I <emph>swear to you,</emph> Lissa, I will be revenged, though he were an emperor. I would find some means to bring him low."</p> 
               <p>"Your heart is as brave as your temper is hot, Robbie. You are a dear, good brother, and I know that you love me. I prize your affection, your promises of protection, even, very, very highly. You shall be my best friend and companion,-my young gallant, when I am an old maid!-but I cannot understand this strange hallucination which distempers both your feelings and your imagination."</p> 
               <p>If there had been more light she would have seen the bitter smile on his face. Rising to go, he said:</p> 
               <p>"But, you promise me to try to obtain father's consent?"</p> 
               <p>"I see no objections to it, except that it will be so hard for us to do without you. I always have wished that you might study abroad, for a couple of years,-they are so thorough,-witness Mr. Dassel's education. You must remember that papa will doubtless consult Mr. Dassel about your going!"</p> 
               <p>"Oh, yes, I suppose so. I only hope that when the matter is first mentioned to him, I may be present."</p> 
               <pb n="160-161" xml:id="VAC8154-00000079"/> 
               <p>"What a mocking tone, Robbie! How desperate you are for such a sunny, careless brother, as you always have been."</p> 
               <p>"Set it all down to the one charge that I adore my sisters. Will you ask, at breakfast, to-morrow? I would like to get off this month" (it then was the first of October).</p> 
               <p>"Just as you wish."</p> 
               <p>"Won't you come in, out of the night-air, Lissa?"</p> 
               <p>"Very soon. Let me stay here a little while," kissing him.</p> 
               <p>"Then you at least forgive me, if you do not credit me?" he asked.</p> 
               <p>"You are my brother," was her reply.</p> 
               <p>Robbie was a little flushed when he came to table the next morning. He could but be fluttered at the importance of the proposition he was about to make. As expected, when he asked his father if he would send him away to a German Institute, there was a cry of dissent from the surprised mother and Milla. When the first excitement was a little calmed, Elizabeth supported her brother's proposition. Mr. Cameron gave no answer, saying that he must take time to think of it. As to the money required, that was not the great objection, since-since-but the father stumbled over this "since," and did not finish the sentence. Elizabeth understood it, however, and said, quietly.</p> 
               <p>"Yes, papa. Whatever funds were intended for my especial expenditures, I make over to Robbie."</p> 
               <p>That evening, for the first time since his interview with Mrs. Cameron, Mr. Dassel made his appearance, fortified on either side by Mrs. Grizzle and Sam. It was better so; the presence of strangers relieved the embarrassment felt by both parties. This was, perhaps, the hour of most consummate trial to Elizabeth-the hour when she was called upon to summon a woman's pride to fight the battle against a dozen odds. Her mother, her father, Dassel himself, could but cast upon her glances of surprise and admiration. Never had she been more truly herself-sweet, serene Lissa Cameron. No pretence of high spirits, nor the opposite. Even the color of her lovely cheek spread its banner at the call of pride, a steady tint of rose, neither paler nor more brilliant than usual. While most attentive to Mrs. Grizzle, she did not hesitate to address Mr. Dassel whenever there was occasion, without pique or melancholy, but with a dignity unapproachable. Sam begged for music. When Miss Cameron was at the piano, especially when she sang, Sam usually sat with his hands on his knees and his mouth open, gazing at her in an ecstatic trance.</p> 
               <p>"Do see our Sam!" said Mrs. Grizzle, nudging Mr. Dassel, who had not dared to offer to turn the music for the player, but left that duty to Robbie, who had hastened to assume it; "he looks as if he'd set his mouth to catch flies. If Miss Cameron would only look up, <emph>now,</emph> I'm sure she couldn't help being tetched by such an expression; it's enough to win a seraphin, I think. I never <emph>did</emph> see any body so completely fascinated as Sam is, with her; though she's well calcilated to produce fanaticism, I must confess. Do you think he stands any chance? You know the family so well, Louis, you might give him some advice. I can't abide to see him a-throwing himself away, like an old jacket or a bad penny, upon a girl that don't care for him. Though we'd all like it, well enough, if she <emph>would</emph> have him. Not but our Sam could get a richer wife,-Miss Bulbors <emph>is dying</emph> after the dear boy,-but we ain't set-up about our property. Sam'll have enough for two, and Miss Lissa's such a real lady-a sweet girl!"</p> 
               <p>"I cannot presume to advise, Mrs. Grizzle. Sam has hardly had the same advantages as Miss Cameron; but he improves. I believe the lady is not otherwise engaged; and<pb n="162-163" xml:id="VAC8154-00000080"/> where the field is open, I suppose each knight can but tilt for the prize."</p> 
               <p>"I didn't quite understand your last remark; but I s'pose Sam'll have to run the risks, like every body else. They're dear girls, both of 'em. I don't think Milla's crooked back is so much of a misfortin' as it might be; it don't show much, and she's so purty otherwise. I make no doubt she'll get a real good husband some of these days."</p> 
               <p>"Speak a little lower, Madame," whispered Dassel, with some asperity; "Miss Milla is close at hand, and, I am afraid, may overhear your remarks."</p> 
               <p>"Why, you little angel, so you be!" cried Mrs. Grizzle, turning and drawing Milla to her side. "How sweet you look, this evenin'. Like a perfect wax doll, I do declare. I was jest picking out a husband for you, when you get old enough. Who do you think it can be? Guess somebody a good deal older than you, with blue eyes and a yellow mustache,-why, I declare, how you <emph>do</emph> color up!"</p> 
               <p>"Perhaps you had better change the subject," said Mrs. Cameron; "Milla is not accustomed to badinage."</p> 
               <p>"Bad what?" asked the good-natured visitor in surprise. "Really, I hadn't the least idea I was saying any thing bad."</p> 
               <p>"Oh, I did not mean that," smiling, in spite of her vexation. "What song was that, Mr. Grizzle, you asked for?" noticing that for one moment Lissa had faltered, and struck a wrong note.</p> 
               <p>"My Heart is Broken by thy Frown," repeated Sam, staring into Mrs. Cameron's eyes with a desperate smile, which he had intended for the young lady, but had not boldness enough to carry so far, and bestowed it on the first who came in his way.</p> 
               <p>Poor Sam! his feelings were as sincere as they were transparent. He dignified them by the name of love. But can a selfish desire to possess that of which we know we are unworthy be called by so sacred a name? He coveted that for which he had nothing to give in return; he would have greedily married this delicate girl, knowing that she could not truly mate her nature with his; and so, though he was very much in earnest, and his passion had the good effect to make him anxious to improve himself, it was thoroughly selfish and egotistic, and therefore not deserving of our acute pity. Love pre-supposes equality. It sounds well when a poet rhymes of <q>
                     <lg type="quotation"> 
                        <l>"The desire of the moth for the star,</l> 
                        <l>Of the night for the morrow;"</l> 
                     </lg>
                  </q> but, in the order of "natural selection," all such desires are unlawful, not to be gratified; and, if they were, would be enjoyed with as little appreciation as a dish of whipped-cream and sponge-cake just off the ice, by a pig.</p> 
               <p>Lissa gratified the young gentleman with the heart-breaking song called for, giving it in rather a mechanical style; but Sam was not critical, and vowed, rapturously, when it was concluded, that he meant to practice it on his flute until he had it, <emph>perfect!</emph>
               </p> 
               <p>Lissa selected something else, she hardly knew what, and was playing, when she came to a pause, waiting for Robbie to turn the music-sheet, which he had forgotten to do.</p> 
               <p>"Listen," said the boy, "papa is talking with Mr. Dassel about my going abroad, and, <emph>as I expected,</emph> he opposes it."</p> 
               <p>"I hear, Robbie; and surely what he says is very sensible. The unsettled state of Europe, at this time, is indeed a serious objection. I had not thought of that."</p> 
               <p>"Let him bring to bear what influences he may, he cannot prevent it. Go I will, if I have to run away."</p> 
               <p>In this determined spirit the boy met every obstacle raised, and at length, in the course of a week, won consent,<pb n="164-165" xml:id="VAC8154-00000081"/> by mere force of will. The matter once decided, he urged forward the preparations, as if he were flying towards instead of away from a home so dear and pleasant as his own. His passage was engaged for the twentieth of October, giving but short time for his fitting out, and none in which to hear, in advance, from the University he proposed to enter. But the Camerons had a friend who had two sons in the same institution, and from him they obtained all necessary information, with letters of recommendation; and Robbie did not seem at all in awe of the untried path before him.</p> 
               <p>"If you pursue your studies with the same zeal that you have your preparations, we shall have a famous scholar in our family," said his father.</p> 
               <p>The excitement of this change in Robbie's plans drove out, for a time, much of the constraint which otherwise might have shadowed the little circle. Those useless preliminaries to a wedding which was never to be, could be quietly ignored in favor of his pressing needs. Robbie was the centre of interest, about whom mother and sisters clung, while the old, attached servants revolved in an outer circle. Sabrina, who worshiped the boy next to her own especial charge, spotted a good many of his new clothes with saline drops as she packed his trunks. She went about, shaking her head, "done sure she should never sot eyes on de chile agin."</p> 
               <p>But, the one who looked most disapprovingly upon Robbie's choice, was Mr. Dassel. He did not say so much to the boy as to Mr. Cameron.</p> 
               <p>"I'll be careful what I eat and drink, and how I go about after dark," muttered Robbie to himself, "and when once there is a mile of water between us, let him look out!"</p> 
               <p>Robbie Cameron came very near not going to Germany, after all. The day the ship was to sail, both Milla and Mrs. Cameron were too unwell to go into the city on board the vessel, to see him off. It was a rainy, cheerless morning, not propitious for a long parting. Robbie, himself, broke down, when the hour arrived for leaving home, sobbing on his mother's neck in a passion of grief. He soon mastered his emotion, for Mr. Dassel was looking on with a dry smile, which provoked an inward fury well calculated to dry up the fountain of tears. As it was his "letter-day," that gentleman was going down to the city. Lissa and Mr. Cameron were to attend the traveller to the ship; and, as Mr. Cameron asked Louis if he had time to accompany them, he readily consented.</p> 
               <p>Mr. Dassel, though aware of Robbie's dislike, made himself very friendly during the short ride on the cars.</p> 
               <p>"You have not taken my advice to keep out of those volcanic regions," he said, "and the next best thing I can do is to give you such advice as is prompted by my own experience;" and he very kindly laid before his hearer such rules of conduct as would be most apt to secure him friends with fellow-students and professors, along with minute directions as to prices, habits of living, peculiarities of the people with whom he was about to come in contact, giving him such information as could not be obtained from books, and all with such an air of brotherly interest, that the boy's soul, softened by the feelings of the parting-day, almost accused itself of injustice.</p> 
               <p>Lissa was quite disturbed by the confusion reigning on the dock, consequent upon the last hour of the steamer; her spirits were affected by the gloomy weather, which seemed still gloomier in that muddy, crowded, slippery region. Louis saw the baggage safely on board, while Robbie was exchanging last messages with his relatives. They were all to go on board a few minutes, to take a peep at his state-room, and keep the young traveller's courage to the sticking-point.</p> 
               <pb n="166-167" xml:id="VAC8154-00000082"/> 
               <p>The plank was wet with falling rain. As Lissa passed over it, she shuddered, as she looked into the green water, fretting between the vessel and the dock;-it seemed so easy to make a mis-step, and go down into it,-a yawning grave from which there would be small chance of rescue. Her father preceded her, Robbie and Mr. Dassel came behind. Her foot had just touched the deck when she heard a sharp cry. Turning about she saw Robbie, her darling, her brother, hanging over that horrible gulf, by one hand, only, to the slippery plank. He had missed his footing (the tears in his eyes blinding him, perhaps), and fallen, but in falling, with the instinct of self-preservation, had caught the plank. <emph>Could</emph> he hold on until assistance was given? Mr. Dassel was standing with his hands thrown up, his face as white as the boy's. He had usually so much self possession-so much strength! Why did he not seize him from his peril? Elizabeth instantly threw herself flat on the plank, seizing her brother's wrist, while his cry was echoed by a dozen people who now noted the accident. That action of hers saved his life. It was not five seconds until stronger hands clasped the boy's arm, and he was drawn up, with no other injury than the nervous shock he had sustained. Yet, of the four, Dassel trembled the most violently, when they all were safe on deck.</p> 
               <p>"You have given me a great shock," he said, looking pale enough to verify his words, pressing his hand on his heart; "you came very near missing your University education, my boy."</p> 
               <p>"Yes, I came very near being tripped up on <emph>that,</emph>" said Robbie, his color coming back, and laughing, rather faintly.</p> 
               <p>"I hope it's not an ill-omen," said Mr. Cameron.</p> 
               <p>"Not a bit of it, father. Don't say any thing about it to mother. Look, Lissa, what a sight you have made of yourself, getting me out of my scrape!"</p> 
                
               <p>"I shall never want to look into green water again," muttered she, shuddering, still quite heedless of the mudstains on her dress and cloak.</p> 
               <p>Kind hands now offered to efface these; Dassel went to the steward for a glass of wine, for she seemed faint and unnerved; nor did she rally before the final moment of farewell came.</p> 
               <p>"I never saw a narrower escape!" remarked Dassel, as, the ship having steamed out upon the river, and Robbie's last wave of his handkerchief disappeared, the three turned to seek the street. "I did not see how he came to slip; I only saw him go down; I was completely paralyzed; I could not have stirred a finger; and yet, it is seldom I lose my presence of mind. You did nobly, Elizabeth."</p> 
               <p>"If one ever wants presence of mind it is in an emergency," she answered, rather coldly.</p> 
               <p>"To be sure! but who has it? Your deed, I assure you, was remarkable."</p> 
               <p>"God inspired me," she said, simply, "and now, father, let us conclude not to refer to it before mother, at present."</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XI.</head> 
               <head type="sub">A QUIET GAME, WELL PLAYED.</head> 
               <p>MR. DASSEL'S first visit to the tenement-house was not his last. Little Toddle would shout with delight when he heard the voice of the beautiful gentleman; while Abby, the girl, a thin child, with light hair and angular motions like her mother's, would brighten up into a shy smile not ugly to see, though rather colorless. Their wonderful visitor was a Prince, like the one she had read about in her torn picture-book, and his gifts were lavish in their magnificence, for they included a real hobby-horse for Toddle, and a splendid pink dress for herself, besides bon-bons innumerable.</p> 
               <p>With Mrs. Bellows he was quite intimate. That severe and chilling woman had conceived a blind admiration for her visitor which, in any one but a genuine New England wife, might have made her husband shake in his shoes; but with this descendant of the Pilgrims not a spark of sentiment or romance mingled with her affection for the man <emph>who understood her and sympathized with her</emph> as Abel never could or would! Mrs. Bellows once had been pretty, like the gingham dress she wore; like that, she was now faded and limp, and yet, she was younger in years than the handsome man who dandled her baby on his knee while he talked with her. But about this she had no fancies. She never ran to the glass when she heard him on the stairs, greeting those he chanced to meet in his cheery, foreign fashion, to see if her hair were smooth or her collar pinned straight; therefore, if a flush of pleasure did mount to her face it was not a flush to conceal from the father of her children. It was a great relief to her careworn mind to tell, at full length, the trials of her lot to an appreciative listener, including all those which arose from the besetting weakness of Abel,-that sad dissipation of his which wasted the means already too narrow for his family. He did not drink, he did not smoke, he was saving of his clothes,-only those wicked lotteries beguiled him and led him astray. Mr. Dassel shook his head over this failing, casting glances of almost tender pity at the poor apartment and the complaining occupant, promising to use all the influence <emph>he</emph> possessed to win Bellows off from so foolish a passion.</p> 
               <p>It is true, that the street upon which the Bellows resided formed a "cut-off" on Dassel's route from his boarding-house to the store of Borden &amp; De Witt, of which it was but natural that he should avail himself, to shorten his long walk. Then, in passing, after having once proved his kindness by calling to inquire after a sick child, it might also be natural that he should repeat the deed which had seemed to give so much pleasure. At first, there was the excuse of the baby's picture, which he desired to see; then, he promised Abby a slate and pencil, and must bring them when he passed again. Mrs. Bellows was not a simpleton; she had plenty of shrewdness; and she never doubted, delighted as she was with the gentleman's civilities, and confidential as she became in her disclosures to him, but that he had some object in calling, beyond her or her children. She could see no object but Miss Bayles.</p> 
               <p>In the eyes of all the family that young lady was perfection; she was pretty enough for any man, and her manners were not to be surpassed. To be sure, Mr. Dassel<pb n="170-171" xml:id="VAC8154-00000084"/> was a remarkable gentleman; but that was only to make the fairy-tale come out as it should; they always had expected that some wonderful being would see Miss Bayles and her pictures, fall in love with her, and carry her off to live in a brown-stone palace in the gorgeous regions of uptown. So that when Mr. Dassel brought confectionery to the little Bellows, and talked long with the mother, no doubt his eyes, mentally, were on the sweet face of the artist in the adjoining room; and the good woman, fascinated as she was by the enjoyment of pouring forth her own troubles into an attentive ear, was not so selfish but that she cut herself off, as it were, and put herself away, to summon Miss Bayles, with transparent pretexts, into her room to meet her destined prince. All the more delighted was she when she learned, through their conversation, that they had dwelt under the same roof, and sat at the same table, during those days of absence in which the artist was at the country-house of her rich friends. The Fates themselves had a hand in it, thought Mrs. Bellows, and the harder, plainer, and more humble her own lot, the more lavishly did she build up castles-in-the-air for her fair neighbor.</p> 
               <p>An opulent future <emph>was</emph> slowly unrolling itself before the blind footsteps of the young artist, but Mr. Dassel had no part in it such as the imagination of his humble friend allotted him. Yet he took a deep interest in Miss Bayles; he devoted many hours to her, both in the tenement-house and at the villa, paying her attentions delicate and impressive.</p> 
               <p>Mrs. Bellows did not open her mind as freely, on these subjects, to Abel, as she would have done, had not a half-guilty consciousness that she was holding up the faults of her husband to a stranger, restrained her. Abel knew that Mr. Dassel came often to his house; he saw the presents received by the children; also, the guest was as apt to come when he was at home as when away. Indeed, to no one did he make himself more agreeable than to the porter. He frequently spent whole evenings with him playing draughts and backgammon, chatting, between-times, to the wife and Miss Bayles.</p> 
               <p>On many occasions the subject of the robbery at the store came up. The murder had made a profound impression upon Abel. He never could speak of it without nervousness, and a slight pallor over his ruddy face. The shock to him had been great, for he very well knew that chance might have made <emph>him</emph> the victim, in place of his unfortunate comrade; while visits of aid and sympathy to the mourning widow kept alive those feelings of horror which he had at first experienced.</p> 
               <p>Yet, by a curious fascination, it seemed that he and Mr. Dassel could hardly sit down together for a quiet game, but that the subject was introduced. Dassel naturally enough had a great interest in it. Being correspondent for the house, he was interested in their concerns; and then, as he told the little man opposite-whose blue eyes were fixed upon him, as he spoke, with an indescribable, half-eager, half-withdrawn look-he had an inborn taste for disentangling the threads of mysterious crimes or complicated legal troubles-he should have been a lawyer, and had almost decided to study, yet, for the profession.</p> 
               <p>"I have no doubt I could now pass an examination, having read law, all my life, in pursuance of my natural inclinations," he remarked, one evening. "And, about this robbery, I never told you, Abel, that since my return from St. Louis, I have come upon a clue which I think will lead me to the guilty parties."</p> 
               <p>"Is that so?"</p> 
               <p>The two men looked at each other across the table.<pb n="172-173" xml:id="VAC8154-00000085"/> They were alone, Mrs. Bellows having gone down to spend the evening with the school-teacher's wife, and the children were in bed.</p> 
               <p>It was a cool night, early in November. It was a common thing for the visitor to send out for a pitcher of lager, from which he and Abel would drink moderately as they played their harmless game; but this evening, Dassel, complaining of chilliness, had asked permission to make some hot whisky punch. Abel, consenting, drew the coals under the kettle, heated the water, and then told his guest to suit his own taste; as for himself, he seldom tasted whisky. "Of course not, except to keep off chills," the visitor responded in his cheery manner; but, when his task of concocting the medicine was over, performed with that airy, laughing grace so becoming to him, there were two tumblers of the steaming beverage, one at either elbow, and Abel, as he moved his men, sipped at his glass, half unconsciously, until its contents disappeared.</p> 
               <p>Now, as he looked up, with the question, "Is that so?" upon his lips, his heightened ruddiness and a certain glitter of the eyes told that the unusual stimulus had affected him.</p> 
               <p>"Yes," said Dassel, glancing towards the door and finding it closed. Each involuntarily moved nearer across the table, Abel with his short, plump arms folded upon it, his visitor with one finger almost touching his sleeve, scanning the other's face.</p> 
               <p>"I didn't never have no confidence in that St. Louis trip."</p> 
               <p>"Why not?"</p> 
               <p>Bellows grew confused. If he had not taken the whisky he would not have allowed <emph>that</emph> remark to have escaped his lips.</p> 
               <p>"Why not?"</p> 
               <p>"Wa'll, I don't know,-only I hadn't. It turned out as I expected.</p> 
                
               <p>"Bellows, have <emph>you</emph> any clue?"</p> 
               <p>There was no reply. Dassel turned more liquor into their glasses, and Abel, in his nervousness, drank his off at once: it ran like fire through his veins, for his companion had neglected to add water.</p> 
               <p>"I've thought, for some time, Abel, that you knew more about this matter than you have disclosed. If so, I think it your duty to make it known. <emph>I</emph> have not been with the firm as long as you; yet, if I possessed facts with regard to a matter like this, I should feel bound to reveal them. I would like to know how your suspicions tally with mine. Bellows, I have observed you closely, and I know that you have <emph>found a clue to the robber.</emph> Give up that clue to me, allow me to prosecute this thing alone, and I will not only allow you all the advertised reward, but will add a thousand dollars of my own. Think of that, Abel! two thousand dollars! You are poor-in debt. Your wife is unhappy. You have made her so by fooling away your hard earnings in lottery tickets. Let this be your lottery, in which, at last you will be sure of the prize,-enough to pay your debts and buy you a snug little home! enough to restore your wife's smiles and good temper! Winter is coming on; rents are high; I know it all. Look here! <emph>give me the clue,</emph> and you shall have this to-night!"-he took from his vest-pocket two bonds of five hundred dollars each, and held them before him on the table.</p> 
               <p>"What is it I am to give you for this?"</p> 
               <p>"You know, well enough, to what I refer,-a thousand dollars, cash down,-nothing can be easier."</p> 
               <p>Abel <emph>did</emph> know to what his companion referred. There was a spot over his heart which burned with intense consciousness. It appeared to him as if the keen blue eyes opposite could see, through his soiled vest, and all its wrappings of paper, the sleeve-button, with its green jewel flashing<pb n="174-175" xml:id="VAC8154-00000086"/> balefully. His whole breast seemed illuminated. He half expected the man to reach forth and grasp it. But, although the liquor he had taken increased the vividness of his feelings, it had not impaired his judgement. The doubts which had troubled him, the conflicting respect and suspicion, all merged in one sharp certainty, and he drew a breath which relieved him of weeks of suspense. Modest and deprecating as were his ordinary manners, he did not quail, now, before an inquisition which was truly terrible. The flash of their eyes met like the clashing of steel.</p> 
               <p>"Think of how much good this money will do you. The friend to whom you gave your note for a hundred dollars, will be here to attach your furniture next week."</p> 
               <p>"Who told you that?"</p> 
               <p>"Your wife. No one else can make that thing which you have worth as much to you as I, Abel. A thousand dollars is quite a sum to a man situated as you are."</p> 
               <p>"I know it, Mr. Dassel. I have often thought it over. I could have had it, any day, since the first week of the murder."</p> 
               <p>A slight paleness increased over Dassel's face; there was hatred or some other ugly emotion in its pallor, but he conquered the feeling which had only betrayed itself in the clutch of his finger-nails into the flesh of his palm; a tremulous smile played about his mouth as he spoke-as if he were asking some woman to be his wife-</p> 
               <p>"Are we not friends, Bellows? I have relied on your friendship. I believed that you loved me, as I have you, and yours."</p> 
               <p>Abel's glance sank beneath the soft power of a look which few, of either sex, ever had resisted, and, wandering restlessly about the room, fell on the hobby-horse which had given Toddle such delight.</p> 
               <p>"I always liked you better'n any blood relation," he faltered, presently.</p> 
                
               <p>"Thank you, Abel. Then I cannot see how you can refuse me so small a favor,-the first I ever asked of you!"</p> 
               <p>"Because," answered Abel, again recovering his self-possession, "this is a matter of conscience, Mr. Dassel. God knows I've been troubled in my mind about it! Murder is murder, sir, and nothing ought to excuse it. It makes me feel like a party to it, sir."</p> 
               <p>"That is all right, Abel; I see just how you are placed. But this case, it strikes me, admits of palliation. I have made up my mind that the robber had no intention of murder,-he was attacked by the watchman, and, under the influence of the instinct of self-preservation, killed him to save himself. How he came to be tempted to commit the robbery, who knows? Desperate circumstances-circumstances like yours, or worse-might have urged him upon it. I would not be any more merciful to him than you would. It is not a question of the robber's crime. It is a question of friendship between you and I, Abel. I want to prosecute this thing myself. In order to get it into my hands, I wish to get possession of that small article which the robber lost. I offer you a thousand down for it, and all the reward promised by the firm."</p> 
               <p>"You don't mean to say you will deliver up the guilty parties and secure the reward?"</p> 
               <p>"Oh, but I do. Your suspicions are as far astray as wrongful to an innocent man. There is something to be explained which will be made clear when the time comes. Did you not know, Abel, that I, also, was a loser, to a small amount, by that robbery? that my desk was opened, and a little box taken from it containing several precious souvenirs of my foreign home-among other things, a pair of sleeve-buttons, of old-fashioned setting, but containing emeralds which were heirlooms in my family? Such was the case. My reason for not complaining was this: I believed that I<pb n="176-177" xml:id="VAC8154-00000087"/> could find the burglar by means of those jewels; they were too remarkable not to give a probability of their being traced. Since the robbery I have not allowed a day to pass in which I have not made exertions to find those emeralds. I have been to diamond-merchants and pawnbrokers. In short, I have found the other button, and by that means expect to convict the guilty party. I only ask you to give me that which you found, and to testify, when called into court, to the circumstances of the finding. In the meantime I give you a thousand dollars to relieve you from your present difficulties."</p> 
               <p>The porter stared blankly into the face of the speaker. Astonishment too great to be otherwise than mute, had possession of him. But, it had an effect upon him quite contrary to what his companion expected; instead of adding to his confusion it calmed his excitement; the fumes of the liquor cleared away from his brain; his sensibilities were no longer in the ascendant; his reason came into full play; the half-shrewd, half-merry twinkle of the eyelid was gone; one might have thought that the porter had changed places with the man of the world, his glance grew so penetrating.</p> 
               <p>In the short silence which followed, swift thoughts brought numerous matters before his mind, from which to make his selection. Was it possible that he <emph>had</emph> been accusing an innocent man, constantly, in his secret soul?-misrepresenting his every action, giving a ghastly coloring to his most simple actions, shrinking from his proffered friendship, shuddering when his hand touched his laughing boy? How glad he would be, could he spring up, this moment, confess his suspicion, and beg the forgiveness of the man whom he <emph>had</emph> loved, even while he had condemned! How simple the solution, after all! And he had made himself such an unhappy fool about the matter! Now that Dassel had mentioned that the buttons had been taken from his desk, how the whole face of the case was altered! How thankful he was that he had taken no steps to accuse one who could so easily have proved himself innocent!</p> 
               <p>And yet! how curious that Dassel should offer him so large a sum of money for the missing button, instead of simply asking him if he had found it!</p> 
               <p>Guilt is almost sure to overreach itself. It betrays itself continually; as Dassel had remarked, in the story of Count Konisberg, "the Ancient Mariner is ever impelled to repeat the tale of his own crimes."</p> 
               <p>There was inconsistency in the manner which Dassel had taken to recover his sleeve-button. Abel could but see it, though his heart yearned to overlook it. Perhaps, too, in that long watch which he had kept over a suspected man, he had come upon other reasons for doubting him. As we have said, the porter was not the firmest of men; he trembled, now, inwardly, for soft and thrilling as was the regard of his friend, there was a subtle light behind it which pierced him like a threat; but he had considerable moral bravery, and his hand, which had moved towards his vest-pocket, withdrew itself, and he answered the other's proposition,-</p> 
               <p>"Give me twenty-four hours to think upon it, Mr. Dassel. Come here to-morrow night, and get my answer."</p> 
               <p>"I will not wait. A thousand dollars to-night or never."</p> 
               <p>"Indeed, it is not with me; I have it away, for safe keeping."</p> 
               <p>This was a falsehood into which Abel was hurried by the other's manner; he blushed as he spoke it, for he was not accustomed to lie, and he felt that Dassel knew that he was lying.</p> 
               <p>Dassel stood up; Abel arose, also, pale with a dread that the angry man was about to spring upon him and choke him. He felt guilty, as if he had given his friend good<pb n="178-179" xml:id="VAC8154-00000088"/> reason to hate him,-even to attack him. He had refused to give up that which belonged to the other. At this moment, Mrs. Bellows came in.</p> 
               <p>"I declare, if you don't look like two prize-fighters," she laughed; "what ye been talking about,-<emph>politics?</emph>"</p> 
               <p>"Oh no, indeed, madam, I've been giving your husband a lesson in the art of making money."</p> 
               <p>"Which he needs, bad enough."</p> 
               <p>"Like the rest of us, I suppose. I have stayed late; I must be going. To-morrow night, is it, then?"</p> 
               <p>"Yes," said Bellows, following him to the door, "I will get it for you to-morrow. Don't be offended, Mr. Dassel."</p> 
               <p>"Oh, as to that," with a light laugh, "we are friends or enemies. I love my friends and hate my enemies. Goodnight, Mrs. Bellows."</p> 
               <p>Abel arose, the next morning, more uneasy in mind than he had been since the first week of the robbery. Some instinct urged him not to go about with the fatal sleeve-button on his person. He could not tell, himself, whether he was afraid that it would be violently wrested from him, or whether he dreaded his own weakness which might be persuaded into giving it up. He always had kept it in the pocket of his vest.</p> 
               <p>"It is cold," he said to his wife; "I b'lieve I'll put on my winter-vest, Abby," and he hung the one he had been wearing on a peg in his bedroom.</p> 
               <p>Still, he did not feel easy. He went back, took the troublesome button from its hiding-place, wrapped it in more paper, opened the clock and tucked it away in that sacred repository of small treasures, where Mrs. Bellows kept Matthew's five-dollar gold-piece and her marriage certificate.</p> 
               <p>He did not meet Dassel that day; it was not his correspondence-day, and he did not come to the store. Abel felt relieved; but he shrank from the evening, for he had made up his mind to refuse to give up the button. When he reached home, tea was ready, and Abby was looking unusually good-natured. A pair of handsome gilt china vases stood on the mantel-piece, and a new delaine dress-pattern lay on a chair.</p> 
               <p>"There was an old-clo'es man come along to-day," she said, in explanation. "I don't usually deal with them rascals; but this one give real good bargains. I got the dress and the vases, and what d'ye s'pose I give for them? nothin' but your old coat and that vest you threw by this mornin'."</p> 
               <p>"I wish you'd stop sellin' my garments till I give you leave," burst forth Abel, adding the next moment, "no harm done, though, Abby,-you did make a real good bargain."</p> 
               <p>He laughed nervously, pretending to admire the dress-pattern, while the sweat stood on his forehead as he congratulated himself upon having removed "the silent witness" in time. He would have thought it a mere chance, that the old-clo'es man should have got <emph>that</emph> vest, had not the articles given been of more value than those received,-quite the reverse of the usual way of doing that business;-guilt, again, overreaching itself. Why not have driven a hard bargain, and prevented suspicion?</p> 
               <p>While they were drinking their tea he asked particularly about the appearance of the pedlar,-was he tall, or short,-what was the color of his eyes? Really, Mrs. Bellows did not mind;-he was rather tall, and had plenty of black whiskers. Abel did not decide, to his own satisfaction, whether to accuse Mr. Dassel, or whether to believe that the real guilty party,-the person who had taken the buttons from Dassel's desk, and afterwards lost one of them,-had got upon its track. Neither conjecture was pleasant. He began to feel haunted, and to look about him, as he went his ways.</p> 
               <pb n="180-181" xml:id="VAC8154-00000089"/> 
               <p>That evening Mr. Dassel did not come. Abel retired to bed with a feeling of relief, and began to think that he had exaggerated the importance of late words and actions. This belief was strengthened when, the following day, he encountered Dassel on the pavement, not far from the store, and received the usual pleasant smile and word.</p> 
               <p>"Why, Abby, your clock's half-an-hour too slow," he exclaimed, that evening, coming home at dusk, and finding the supper not ready. "I never knew the old clock to play us such a trick before;-she's growin' lazy."</p> 
               <p>"Is it slow?" asked the wife, beginning to fly around the table. "Mr. Dassel, he was in to-day, and said it was too fast. He stopped her a few minutes, and set her right by his watch."</p> 
               <p>Abel's heart was in his mouth.</p> 
               <p>"I never see such a handy person, for a brought-up gentleman, as he is," continued Mrs. Bellows; "he might pass for a right-down Connecticut Yankee-he can do any thing. Sech a tinker! He noticed the lock of the bureau-draw was broke, and offered to fix it. He's done it first-rate."</p> 
               <p>He scarcely heard what she said; he was at the clock, feeling in its dusty recesses.</p> 
               <p>"Hand me the lamp, Abby."</p> 
               <p>"Here 'tis. But never mind the clock till you've had yer supper. It's ready, after all."</p> 
               <p>After a moment's investigation Abel set the lamp down suddenly, himself dropping into a chair.</p> 
               <p>The button was gone!</p> 
               <p>"Are you sick, Abel Bellows?"</p> 
               <p>His wife's voice was not tender, even when she asked him a question like this; it started him out of his reverie.</p> 
               <p>"Not sick, Abby, but tired."</p> 
               <p>In the pleasant mood in which her visitor had left her, she had made hot biscuits for tea, but they might have been sawdust as far as her husband's appreciation went.</p> 
               <p>The next day was Saturday. Mr. Dassel would be in, through the forenoon, writing up his foreign letters. He came, as usual; Abel, restless and miserable, made an excuse to approach him, replacing some light boxes near his desk.</p> 
               <p>Dassel sat at his work, calm, humming to himself a German drinking-song, as his white, slender hand flashed over the paper, writing with ease and rapidity. A ray of sunlight came through the skylight, flashing upon something brilliant at his wrist, as he moved it. Abel saw the flash, and recognized the emerald-set sleeve-buttons. Dassel looked up at the same instant, meeting the troubled glance raised from the jewels to his face, with just the glimmer of a smile-triumph shining beneath indifference. Neither of them spoke; nor for several days thereafter were they brought in contact.</p> 
               <p>Abel Bellows grew thin and haggard under the perplexities of the position in which he was placed. Then, too, he had private troubles of a financial character,-a note of a hundred dollar to be met, and nothing to meet it with; his wife soured and fretting over coming trouble, Mr. Dassel passing him with a haughty carelessness.</p> 
               <p>At last he resolved to do what he should have done at the first,-seek some member of the firm, and tell him, simply and fully, the whole story of the sleeve-button, leaving it to the firm to decide upon the facts and to act as they saw proper. Having come to this resolution, it was with a lighter step than usual that he trod the familiar way, and entered upon his duties in the store, about ten days after the affair of the clock. Alas for good resolutions, which came too late! Alas for Abel, and his wife, and his little ones! All the previous troubles of their lives were as nothing to the disaster which befel them that day.</p> 
               <pb n="182-183" xml:id="VAC8154-00000090"/> 
               <p>When the gentlemen of the firm came to business that day, they came accompanied by police-officers, who took Abel, bewildered and stupefied by the shock, into custody, on the charge of being the person who had robbed the store and murdered the watchman.</p> 
               <p>"Who accuses me? where are the proofs?" he cried, in his anguish.</p> 
               <p>"That you will know, at the examination. I assure you they are strong, or they would not have brought us to accuse <emph>you,</emph> Bellows."</p> 
               <p>This was said by Mr. Borden, and the reproach in his voice was a hard thing for the porter to bear. It caused a lump to rise in his throat which prevented farther attempts at self-defence, and he was led away to disgrace and imprisonment.</p>

               <head type="sub">WILL SHE DO IT.</head> 
               <p>"GIRLS is so sweet," said Mrs. Grizzle, who, never having had a daughter, always had sighed for one. "I wish Sam would hurry up his cakes; I expected we'd have the fun of a weddin' before this. We'll do it up Brown when he does git married; we'll only have it to do once. I never seen Miss Bulbous look so pretty as she did just now. How'd you like her, Grizzle?"</p> 
               <p>"Oh, middlin'. She's good weight and fine grain; she's been well fed. But, I can't say but I fancy our neighbor more, or even Miss Bayles. Fact is, I like the latter. I feel to home with her. She allers puts me in mind of the grocery-store, and she a-coming in so modest with her little purse, hesitating over this and that, which was what she wanted, but so dear! It's pleasant to me to know that I allers gave her good measure and under price."</p> 
               <p>"Let you alone for that, Grizzle; the only wonder is, how you ever contrived to git rich, with your easy ways."</p> 
               <p>"Government contracts to blame for that, my dear; I couldn't help it. Miss Bayles is a gen'us though, isn't she? Did you notice how exact she got the smile in my eye, and them books on the table, with my hand on 'em? I told her to give me a literary turn, as the portrait was for my descendants, and I didn't care about handin' down the pork business unto the third and fourth generation."</p> 
               <pb n="184-185" xml:id="VAC8154-00000091"/> 
               <p>"I think she's done us all splendidly, Grizzle,-quite per-Raffelite, I tell her, which is so fashionable at present."</p> 
               <p>"And what style's that, pray, Mrs. Grizzle? You're gettin' quite a judge of such things, I s'pose, since you've visited so many galleries lately, and made friends with them Academy fellows."</p> 
               <p>"Well, I <emph>am</emph> allowed to have some taste,-the artists have complimented me, often, on my discernment. The per-Raffelite style, as nigh as I can make it out, is to paint things just as they be. I heard one artist to the Academy say he'd spent three days paintin' a brick-bat, and wasn't satisfied with it yet. There was a beautiful hod, half full of mortar, by the same gentleman. I declare, if I'd been an Irishman I should a picked it up."</p> 
               <p>"Accordin' to that, Miss Bayles ought to have drawn me sittin' on a hogshead with a stye on my eye."</p> 
               <p>"Nonsense, Grizzle! how you <emph>do</emph> go on. I'm talkin' about purchasing the hod-picture. It's ruther high-eight hundred dollars,-but they all say it's wuth it."</p> 
               <p>"I'm afraid it'll be considered <emph>historical,</emph> my dear. I wouldn't like to have our friends see it on our walls and ask if it was our grandfather's."</p> 
               <p>"I never thought of <emph>that,</emph>" said the lady, evidently declining in her enthusiasm for that particular work of art.</p> 
               <p>"Let's have something nice, when we do spend our money on such things, my love. I like pictures with lambs in 'em, and green trees, or a bit of water that looks as if there was trout in it."</p> 
               <p>"I don't care much what the pictures are, for my part; but I think the frames help furnish a room, and people think you're mean if you don't patronize art. But, about Miss Bayles, husband: don't put that idea into Sam's head again. He looks higher now. Didn't you notice how Miss Bulbous kissed me before she went down the steps? La! I understood it all; that kiss was for Sam."</p> 
                
               <p>"She'd better get me, then, to act as her deputy."</p> 
               <p>"You go 'long! How becomin' blue is to Miss Bulbous. She's stopping over to lawyer Cameron's, now, to invite their young ladies. There'll be quite a party. She and her pa are going down to the Fifth Avenue Hotel next week to board through the winter, and she's asking all the neighbors to a farewell party. Sho! If Sam ain't over there, too! He's gone to assist Camilla out of the carriage, and he's done it in good style, too. I never did see a boy improve as he has since we had Mr. Dassel in the family. It's an excellent thing to have a Baron handy to settle little matters of etiquette, when one's in doubt. I never should a got through that dinner, last week, as I did, if I hadn't got his advice as to seatin' the company, and what orders to give the head-waiter. I do admire to see Sam around the girls."</p> 
               <p>The beaming face of the good-natured mother shone between the gorgeous amber of the satin curtains of the parlor side-window, like the sun between golden clouds, as she leaned forward to watch Sammy escort Miss Bulbous through the Cameron piazza into the hall. It was a cool, bright November morning, in the midst of the Indian summer,-a fine day for morning visits; and Miss Bulbous was improving it, by inviting her friends to an evening gathering before their villa should be closed for the winter.</p> 
               <p>Mr. Bulbous had no residence in town. As his family consisted of himself and daughter, and a maiden-sister, it was as well for them to board during their three or four months of city-life. His daughter was not averse to rooms at the Fifth Avenue, while it was very convenient for Bulbous, <foreign xml:lang="FRA">pre,</foreign> who could there carry on, through the evening, the same business which engaged him during the day.</p> 
               <p>The only time that Camilla's face showed animation was when there were young gentlemen about her; and then it<pb n="186-187" xml:id="VAC8154-00000092"/> was not sufficient to light her eyes or color her cheeks. Her father was large, white, and fat; she, as we have said, was large, white, and waxy. Many people thought both very handsome. She did look well as she entered the parlor escorted by Sam, and met Miss Elizabeth with that little kiss current among young ladies, bowed to Mr. Dassel, Miss Milla, and sank upon the sofa, which sent she chose as leaving a possibility open to Sam to sit beside her.</p> 
               <p>There was a bow of blue velvet at the throat of her white Marseilles morning-dress; ribbons of the same rich blue mixed with the frizzes of her light hair, on top of which was perched a suggestion of a hat with a blue plume. Her carriage-cloak was lined with blue, and there were blue rosettes on her gaiters.</p> 
               <p>"How pleasant it is to-day," said Elizabeth.</p> 
               <p>"Oh, it's splendid!"</p> 
               <p>"Did you go down to the matine, yesterday?"</p> 
               <p>"Oh, yes, it was splendid!"</p> 
               <p>"I meant to have heard it, but was kept at home. Have you secured your rooms at the Fifth Avenue?"</p> 
               <p>"Pa engaged them some time ago. They're splendid! I want to get into the city dreadfully; the country's stupid at this season. I wish you'd come and board at our Hotel, a few weeks, Mr. Grizzle: I should think you'd die, out here all winter. Ask your father to allow you, won't you?-it will be splendid!"</p> 
               <p>"It will, indeed, Miss Bulbous. I'll be sure to ask him."</p> 
               <p>"We're going abroad next summer, Mr. Dassel. Shall we have the pleasure of meeting you there, or is America your permanent home?"</p> 
               <p>"I can hardly answer, mademoiselle. I shall not trust myself in those distempered countries so soon, I think."</p> 
               <p>"Ah! Mrs. Grizzle told me you were expatriated. But, I suppose they'll not trouble us Americans? You ought to go across in your yacht, Mr. Grizzle,-it would be splendid! But, I must make a very short call, as I have sixteen more on my list this morning. I only came to invite you all to our house next Monday evening, at 8 o'clock, to a little music and dancing. Mrs. Grizzle has promised for herself and this young gentleman here. Give my compliments to your father and mother, Miss Cameron, and beg <emph>them,</emph> especially, to come;"-she hesitated, and looked at Milla. "I saw you at Mrs. Grizzle's party," she said, "so you cannot refuse to attend mine on the score that you're not in society. I shall expect you, too. Above all things, come early, for we are to have the German,-and that takes time. Mr. Dassel, with your permission, I shall expect you to lead the German. I saw you dance, a few evenings ago, and I set my heart on electing you to the leadership."</p> 
               <p>Mr. Dassel bowed. He had flashed a look at Milla, answered by one from her.</p> 
               <p>"Do you consent?" cried Miss Bulbous, rising to go.</p> 
               <p>"If you think me qualified, Miss Bulbous, I shall feel honored by such commands as you see fit to lay on me."</p> 
               <p>"Thank you, Mr. Dassel; the success of the dancing is assured. It will be moonlight,-splendid, for a party in the country. Oh, dear! I wish gas-lamps grew on trees, like apples. I don't fancy these country-roads. Now, all of you, be sure not to disappoint me," and Miss Bulbous said good-morning, and swept out, carrying off Sam, to accompany her to a far-away neighbor's with whom he was better acquainted than she.</p> 
               <p>"Will you go, Milla?" asked her sister, in the silence which followed.</p> 
               <p>"If mamma will go."</p> 
               <p>"It is a lovely day," said Elizabeth, presently, as she stood by the window. "I feel the inclination for a solitary drive upon me,-so I shall not ask either of you to accompany me," playfully, as she moved towards the door.</p> 
               <pb n="188-189" xml:id="VAC8154-00000093"/> 
               <p>"We shall do very well at home: Mr. Dassel is going to play 'Faust' with me. He has brought Sam Grizzle's flute."</p> 
               <p>A sharp pain clutched so suddenly at the elder sister's heart as almost to make her cry out. Blind, hard-hearted little Milla! It was strange that one, herself so like a sensitive-plant, should be so dull where the feelings of this devoted sister were concerned. Milla looked upon Lissa's regard for Mr. Dassel as a light and feeble tie which it had caused her hardly a pang to break, because she, in her own wayward impulsiveness, could not understand the proud reticence of the other. Already self-reproach had died out, and she enjoyed her strange, delicious abandon of happiness as openly before the eyes of Elizabeth as if she had been no usurper of her rights. Many of the sweetest hours of Lissa's life had been passed at the piano with Louis, he accompanying her playing with voice or flute.</p> 
               <p>"How cruel she is! how innocent!-like the infant that bites its mother's breast," thought the poor girl, as she quickened her footsteps from the room. "Oh! that I could go away from here! I cannot endure it-indeed I would not, if I had not promised Robbie to remain. We ought to have a letter from him in a very few days, now. Foolish boy! I imagine with what shame-facedness he will own to his unaccountable illusion. Yes! yes! yes! I will go out to drive-I will go alone," she murmured hastily, as already the first notes of the opera struck upon her ear, and a feverish light came into the dark eyes-the <q>
                     <l>"Sweetest eyes 'twere ever seen,"</l>
                  </q> as Louis had often, and truly, told her.</p> 
               <p>Martin, their only man-servant, was in the flower-garden taking up bulbs, when she went to ask him to get up their little one-horse carriage.</p> 
                
               <p>"Hadn't I better drive?-I'm not very busy to-day, Miss,-and r'ally, you don't look strong enough to manage Prince; he's quite spirited with being shut up so much lately."</p> 
               <p>"I wish he would run away with me!" burst forth the young lady with a laugh which quite startled Martin, it was so different from her usual pleasant seriousness. He looked at her doubtfully.</p> 
               <p>"'Twouldn't be no joke to be tumbled down the bank on to the railroad-track or inter the river."</p> 
               <p>"That's true, Martin. But, I think you may trust me. Prince and I are good friends; and if he only feels as much like going as I do, to-day, we both shall be well suited. Bring him round as quickly as possible, for I want to get up an appetite for lunch."</p> 
               <p>"Where are you going?" asked Mrs. Cameron, as she met her daughter in the hall, driving-gloves in hand. She herself had just come in from the green-house, where she had been looking after her flowers. "See what an exquisite moss-rose this is. Put it in your hair, Lissa."</p> 
               <p>"Give it to Milla, mother. It looks just like her, now that she has more color. She is in the parlor, with Louis. I am going out for a long, lonesome drive; I sha'n't even ask you, mamma, to go with me."</p> 
               <p>"And I shouldn't if you did," said Mrs. Cameron, kissing her; "the fresh air will do you good. I'm going to take my sewing and sit with Milla. Too much music is not good for her."</p> 
               <p>A few moments later Elizabeth was flying along the beautiful road at the highest speed of which Prince was capable. She was in one of those moods which require some safety-valve of outward excitement to be opened in order to render them safe. She had longed, ever since that strange conversation with Milla which preceded the breaking<pb n="190-191" xml:id="VAC8154-00000094"/> ing of her engagement, to go away from home. Under the circumstances, it was cruel that she should remain there. Indeed, her mother had encouraged her to go, and had written to a relative at Newburgh, who had been asking for one of the girls to spend a season with her, that Lissa would like, now, to make the promised visit.</p> 
               <p>At first, she remained to help Robbie off; then she had delayed in asking her mother to write, until they should hear from him; for the boy had exacted a promise of her. The memory of that interview with him, in the summer-house, was like the memory of a nightmare. It had, really, no deeper influence than some fearful dream often leaves; we are oppressed by it, haunted-yet, when we seek for the cause of our terror or melancholy, we remember that it is <emph>but</emph> a dream. If Lissa had not loved Robbie so well she must have been mortally angry with him. But, she forgave him, wondering what could have so distempered his frank and generous nature towards a man who had wrought her much suffering, but who was one of earth's chosen and choicest.</p> 
               <p>As it was nearly time to expect a letter from Robbie, the friends in Newburgh had been written to, and Lissa had promised to be with them before Thanksgiving. That home-sickness which is heaven-sickness, was upon the young girl's heart, as she found herself alone on the country-road. She had been so desolate. Robbie gone, Milla estranged by the singular barrier which had arisen between them, her father careworn and preoccupied,-if it had not been for the sweetness of her mother's friendship, what would have become of her in those wretched days? To-day, in the culmination of her desolate mood, she fled even from her mother's love. Every thing was unsatisfactory. She shrank from the idea of going into a strange house, of leaving her own dear friends; yet, remain with them she could not. In the unhappiness of her situation she yearned for heaven as the child first banished from it yearns for home-with a wild, wailing cry, as if it could not be forbidden.</p> 
               <p>It was the balmiest of Indian-summer days. The slight chill of the morning had melted into an atmosphere of purple and amber, perfumed with fallen leaves, whose gorgeous fragments were scattered everywhere along her path. An amethystine haze hung above and around the Highlands, casting a thin veil over the deep blue of the Hudson. The fields were brown, the forests lay like patches of gold and carmine on the hillsides; no artist could hope to transcribe that melancholy splendor of coloring and tone; no heart, not even in harmony with nature's and touched by sorrow, to feel the full influence of this pathetic beauty of blighted summer.</p> 
               <p>Elizabeth felt it. The universal sadness and mystery of the soulless creation impressed her with a power to soothe the rebellion of her mood. As her horse grew tired of his tearing pace, she allowed him to drop into a more reasonable gait; the feverish gleam of her eyes was dimmed in tears-she felt more like praying and less like suicide.</p> 
               <p>It must have been past the usual luncheon-hour when Elizabeth was startled from her reverie by merry voices, and looking about her, saw that she was four or five miles from home, and that Miss Bulbous's carriage had just driven in from a cross-road and come up abreast of hers.</p> 
               <p>"Can't you take this young gentleman along with you?" cried Miss Bulbous. "It will be a pleasure to you, I've no doubt, and save us ten miles' driving. I'm hungry, and I want to get home."</p> 
               <p>"Oh, Miss Bulbous," expostulated Sam, blushing very red, "you promised to take me home, but I can walk; perhaps Miss Cameron don't wish company. She might think it wouldn't-wouldn't look well-to be seen-with only me."</p> 
               <pb n="192-193" xml:id="VAC8154-00000095"/> 
               <p>"She'll be delighted, I know; and, as for looking, who'll see you?-<emph>I</emph> think it will look delicious," and the coachman was down and had the carriage-door open before Miss Cameron, annoyed, but too kind to show it, could force herself to say.</p> 
               <p>"Certainly, there is a seat to spare; you are welcome to occupy it, Mr. Grizzle."</p> 
               <p>The next moment the young man was by her side, and the carriages had parted company. Sam felt as if he had been struck in the face by a rainbow. His ears tingled, and the earth and air looked all colors. It was the first time he ever had been <emph>entirely</emph> alone with Miss Cameron. He had worshiped his idol at a distance, and it appeared a superlative lift of fortune which had enthroned him beside her. For a few rods nothing was said. Elizabeth had been startled out of her solemn, tearful reflection too suddenly to assume at once that gayety of manner which she usually adopted towards her neighbor; while he was quite over-powered by the mingled delight and embarrassment of his position. Gradually the rainbow which had smitten the young man scattered; he could make out the road, the river, the trees, the loud throbbing of his own heart, and even gained presence of mind to ask if he should drive. Miss Cameron declined.</p> 
               <p>Again there was silence for a few moments. Sam stole a furtive look at the face beside him; he could not be mistaken in the paleness of the smooth cheek, nor in the traces of tears on the fair eyelids. All his soul melted down in his breast at this sight, like a bar of lead at the touch of fire, and lay there in a quivering, solid pool in his bosom, reflecting Miss Cameron from every side and at every angle. The sight of her sadness filled him with a courage of which he never before had the slightest intimation that he was capable. Since she wept, she must be mortal; <emph>if</emph> mortal, why should <emph>he</emph> not aspire? Some would assume that gentle and generous compassion moved the lover; I choose to believe that he thought it a favorable moment to urge his selfish claims to that of which he had an instinct he was not worthy.</p> 
               <p>At all events, the first thing the booby did, who must be audacious or nothing, was to get hold of Elizabeth's disengaged hand and squeeze it. The air with which she withdrew it, and said, "Go on, Prince," was rather discouraging, but he managed to say.</p> 
               <p>"You've been crying, haven't you? I'd give a thousand dollars to know the reason why. Don't drive so fast, Miss Cameron," seductively.</p> 
               <p>"We all have our sad moments."</p> 
               <p>"That's true. Sho! I've experienced that a good deal, this summer. I've been nigh about crazy, the last three months. You know what about, don't you, Miss Cameron? <emph>Don't</emph> go so fast! I sha'n't have time to get through with what I've got to say."</p> 
               <p>"You must not say any thing, Mr. Grizzle. You <emph>must not.</emph> I give you fair warning. <emph>Go along, Prince!</emph>"</p> 
               <p>"Oh, Lord, I can't stop, now I've got a-going, no more'n that horse can, going down-hill. I'm desperate, and I'd just as lief you'd give me the mitten right out as to be kept in this suspense."</p> 
               <p>"Then I give it to you now. Pray, change the subject."</p> 
               <p>"I will, in a minute. I just want to say that, if you think I've ever had a fancy for Miss Bulbous, you're mistaken. I've never liked a girl since I saw you. Miss Bulbous is rich, and sweet on me; but, I'd rather have you for my wife than twenty like her. Oh, do say you'll have me, Miss Cameron! Pa'll give you all the money you want, and ma's <emph>so</emph> fond of you. You'll have a nice time in<pb n="194-195" xml:id="VAC8154-00000096"/> our house. Your horse goes like thunder; check him up, can't you?"</p> 
               <p>"Your mother is very good to me, Samuel; but, I'm sorry you spoke. You must know that I do not love you; and you should not have compelled me to say it."</p> 
               <p>"I knew it. I <emph>hadn't</emph> ought, that's so. But, I've been full and running over <emph>so</emph> long! Oh, Miss Cameron, are you engaged to any body else? Perhaps you're going to marry Mr. Dassel!" the sweat breaking out on his forehead, and his hands trembling.</p> 
               <p>"I shall never marry Mr. Dassel,-nor any one else. Now, Mr. Grizzle, will you please not annoy me any more?"</p> 
               <p>She spoke this last in a passionate voice, sharply; but, because Sam was afraid he had offended her, because he therefore was in despair, and Rose Villa was almost in sight, and Prince fairly racing, he cried out again, taking hold of her hands and the reins:</p> 
               <p>"I can't take 'no' for an answer. Oh, I know I can't. I shall go and drown myself. I'll try and be a good husband to you; you shall do just as you like. There shan't be a thing you ask for that I won't get for you. Ma'll feel so disappointed if you don't have me. Say you will; <emph>do</emph> say you will, Miss Cameron, that's a good girl! Come, now! there's the house. You don't say any thing. <emph>Won't</emph> you stop this confounded horse? Whoa, Prince, <emph>whoa!</emph>"</p> 
               <p>He pulled her hands and the reins; she ceased to make any resistance. She was thinking; and thought can compass much in brief time. In that hour of her desolation, when about to fly her own dear home, whose whole atmosphere had been poisoned to her, there was a certain sort of fascination in the picture her mind painted at Sam's words, "Mother likes you,-father'll give you all the money you want." Yes, here was ease, splendor, and affection. If Milla and Dassel should remain, as she wished them to, under her parents' roof, she need not abide with them, nor yet be without a home whose pride and idol she knew that she would be. It was true that Mrs. Grizzle was vulgar and uneducated; but she had a kind, motherly heart and way, which atoned for many defects.</p> 
               <p>Sam Grizzle was esteemed a "good match" by most of the young ladies in the neighborhood. He had the outward dress of a gentleman, and might some time acquire refinement, in a limited degree. Then, to be married when Milla was, or before; to have a grand wedding, to step into a wealthy house, and dress richly, dispense bounty-would this not be a sort of balm to wounded pride,-the best, the <emph>only</emph> pleasure now left to her? Would there not be triumph in it, under the circumstances? To show Mr. Dassel-She drew her breath in, not daring to look towards the flushed, eager face, venturing to bend nearer to her own.</p> 
               <p>"We'll be home in a minute more. Won't you give me an answer, Miss Lissa,-just the least little thread to hold on by, until you've time to think it over? There's ma on the portico now; please-do tell this horse to stop, for he won't mind me," despairingly.</p> 
               <p>"Whoa, Prince," said Lissa, and the carriage came to a stop, but it was at the gate of Rosa Villa, and Mrs. Grizzle was hurrying down the lawn, to ask what this delightful drive meant.</p> 
               <p>"Jump out," cried Lissa, nervously. "I do not wish to meet any one now. I will send you my answer to-night; "and Sam jumped, feeling as if he were soaring to the stars instead of sinking to the earth. Prince started on, and in five minutes more Elizabeth stood in the centre of her own room, with flushed face, conscious of a high-beating pulse, and a very miserable, reckless mood.</p>

               <head type="sub">THE GOOD THAT IS IN SOME HUMAN NATURE.</head> 
               <p>WHEN Miss Bayles returned from the photographic gallery, in the chill dusk of that November evening which followed upon the arrest of Abel Bellows, her already wearied nerves were further tried by the scene of tribulation into the midst of which she was ushered; for no sooner did she set foot in the hall, than the school-teacher's wife stepped out to relate the exciting news, and to say how poor Mrs. Bellows had been moaning and calling for Miss Bayles, ever since the affair happened.</p> 
               <p>"We are all sorry for her, and have done what we could for her, but she wants you," said the speaker.</p> 
               <p>"I will go right up," said the artist, too much surprised and bewildered to care to make any comments; and up she flew, with her light step, only stopping to lay aside her bonnet in her own room before entering the apartment where Mrs. Bellows sat rocking herself to and fro in the Boston rocking-chair; little Toddle, with frightened blue eyes and uncombed curls, clasped tightly in her arms; the other children sitting, scared and hungry, gazing from afar into their mother's face.</p> 
               <p>"Dear Mrs. Bellows, if I had known you were in trouble, I would have left my work, and come home to you."</p> 
               <p>"I always said it! I always said it!" answered Mrs. Bellows, in that sharp, high-strung key betraying misery and excitement.</p> 
                
               <p>"What did you always say? Poor Toddle is tired, I know. Has he had his supper? Come to auntie, and have some supper."</p> 
               <p>"I knew, and I always said it would come to that. He can't deny that I've said it a thousand times. I told him that would be the upshot of it, and he knows it. If he didn't quit wasting his money on lotteries, he'd be tempted, some time, into worse things. But, to think that he should really rob and murder, and never let on, but keep on that innocent face about it,-oh, Miss Bayles, it sets me crazy to think of it!"</p> 
               <p>As her friend lifted her child out of her arms, the woman pressed her hands on her temples with a wild look, which really alarmed the other. She saw that it was necessary, in some manner, to calm this excitement; yet, even then, her own indignation burst forth in the question,</p> 
               <p>"Is it possible that <emph>you,</emph> too, accuse your husband?"</p> 
               <p>"Accuse him? What can I say? Did not the officers come into our rooms and search, and find in the back of the bureau, behind the draw, a piece of the very lace that was stolen? They took it out before my eyes, and I know they thought <emph>I</emph> had a hand in it, that am as innocent as a babe, and that never had disgrace in the family before. They found the tickets in the little draw, all of them worthless things that he's wasted good money on, and has been so foolish as to save up, as if to witness against him; they winked and laughed, and said that was where the money went to. What could I say? I'm his wife, and I'm sorry that I am. He's disgraced me and the children;-I want nothing more to do with him."</p> 
               <p>Miss Bayles sat down-for Toddle was heavy-pressing the little fellow's cheeks and curls, and saying nothing for the moment. She had liked Abel Bellows extremely. Lowly as was his position, she had appreciated the honesty<pb n="198-199" xml:id="VAC8154-00000098"/> and kindness, the delicacy and genuine refinement, the pleasant humor and good sense of the man. His consideration for her, shown in so many ways, had won upon her friendship. Her whole nature revolted from believing that he was-that he could be-guilty. Yet, here was his own wife accusing him-the stolen goods found on his premises! She could but recall that, since that tragedy at the store, Abel had not appeared quite natural; there had been a restraint over his usual twinkling gayety; he often started when addressed-was lost in reveries, pale, nervous. Many times he had seemed on the point of making a communication to her, and then retired from the subject in embarrassment. All this she had set down to pecuniary troubles, and a conscience sore on the question of lottery-tickets. Did it, then, mean more and worse than this? Terribly as appearances were against him, the young lady could not consent to such a possibility.</p> 
               <p>

                     </lg>
                  </q> She murmured this over to herself; yet surely the veil which wrapped the spirit of this simply shrewd, this kindly honest man, was as nearly transparent as human nature ever wore. She would not admit that she had been deceived in him. She would not even admit that he had, in a moment of temptation, done foul wrong to his own nature. She had more confidence in him than his own wife.</p> 
               <p>Mrs. Bellows was narrow-minded, full of passion and prejudice, while the young artist had that intuitive power of reading others which belongs to genius.</p> 
               <p>"Mrs. Bellows," she said, presently, "let us not judge him too hastily. Whatever others may say, it is your duty to remain by him, unless he is <emph>proven</emph> unworthy. Do not take this sudden trouble too much to heart. I have the fullest faith that the cloud will pass over. In the meantime your children have claims upon you. They are frightened and uncomfortable. I do not believe they have even been fed: have they had any supper or dinner?"</p> 
               <p>The mother glanced at the cold stove in which the fire had been allowed to die out.</p> 
               <p>"They an't had the'r suppers, though I believe Mrs. Wells give them a piece of bread and butter awhile ago. I'll start the fire, and give 'em what there is; but, what they'll do to-morrow is more'n I can say, for the barrel o' flour was just out, and Abel didn't leave me but a couple of dollars this mornin' when he went out."</p> 
               <p>The sharp voice had sunk into its habitual complaining tone; but, as it said the last words, it trembled, and Mrs. Bellows burst out into a passion of crying. The picture of Abel, going out that morning so cheerfully from his home, which he was never again, perhaps, to enter, arose before her, arousing the wife's tenderness, which had lain dormant before the storm-burst of her anger and reproach.</p> 
               <p>Miss Bayles thought it best to allow her to "have her cry out." Coaxing the little boy to be good, and sit beside her, she busied herself with the stove, where she soon had a fire and the tea "steeping." Giving Matthew some change, she sent him out for a few eatables with which to cheer and garnish the table; placed Toddle in his high-chair, turned the gas up to burn brightly; and when all was ready, took Mrs. Bellows' limp hand and drew her up, saying, "Come, have a hot cup of tea. I'm going to take supper with you to-night," and she sat down in Abel's place, that the loss might not be so keenly perceived.</p> 
               <p>"Oh, where is he? What do you think they will do with him to night?" asked the wife, piteously, dropping unresistingly into the chair placed for her.</p> 
               <pb n="200-201" xml:id="VAC8154-00000099"/> 
               <p>"He will not be very uncomfortable, I hope," was the cheerful answer. "His worst sufferings will be mental. You can go and see him to-morrow, and tell him that you will stand by him, and take good care of his children until he is free to resume his place as their protector, and that will be a great solace to him. I doubt not he'll bear the rest very easily, after he knows that his wife will stand by him."</p> 
               <p>"Ma, what makes you cry so much? Is pa dead?" asked little Abby, whose mouth Miss Bayles immediately filled with a tart.</p> 
               <p>"I know all about it," answered Matthew the eldest, bringing his fist down on the table; "the boys hollered at me, when I came out the grocer's, 'Your pa's in jail! Hooray! he's took up for knockin' Bill Connelly on the head, and he's got to swing-hooray!' Miss Bayles, what is 'got to swing'?"</p> 
               <p>"Never mind what the boys say, Matthew. Your father has been arrested; but I do not believe he has done any thing wrong. Innocent persons are frequently sent to prison on false accusations. It will come all right in a few days, and you must keep your temper, and not mind the boys. Don't trouble your mother with questions; she is tired and sick, and I wish her to drink her tea."</p> 
               <p>With gentle artfulness Miss Bayles persuaded Mrs. Bellows into her second cup, and was glad to observe that something of the wildness disappeared from her manner under the effect of its warmth and stimulus. She drew the mother's attention to the wants of the children, helping prepare them for bed, and smothering Toddle's call for "papa" under a shower of kisses.</p> 
               <p>As they were washing up the dishes, Mrs. Bellows broke forth again:</p> 
               <p>"I <emph>can't</emph> feel to forgive him, Miss Bayles; you wouldn't, if you was in my place. He's weak, Abel is. He's broken his promise more'n once,-and this is what comes of it. Oh, Miss Bayles, whatever else you do, never marry a <emph>weak</emph> man,-a man that can't hold himself and his family up, but is allers breakin' down in the wrong place."</p> 
               <p>"Every body has some one weak point."</p> 
               <p>"Well, a man ought to <emph>be</emph> a man. If I'd a stayed single and stuck to vest-makin' in my native town, I'd a been better off to-day"-and she looked discontentedly about the room.</p> 
               <p>"Would your heart have been satisfied with vest-making? Can you imagine a life without your children,-without meek little Abby's smile and Toddle's fat cheeks and dimples?"</p> 
               <p>"Don't, Miss Bayles! You don't know what you're-treading on. 'Sposing Abel is hung on the gallows: do you think I'll be glad I'm the mother of children then?"</p> 
               <p>"But, he <emph>won't</emph> be!" cried her friend, herself frightened at the picture. Her hands trembled so that she dropped a plate, which fell to pieces on the floor. "There! I've broken your plate. You must scold me well, Mrs. Bellows!"</p> 
               <p>"It's the last of the blue-and-white set we bought the day after we was married," murmured the other, picking up the ruins, and passing her hand over them, lost in a dream of other days. "Abel was real handsome then,-so every body said."</p> 
               <p>She already spoke of him as of one dead.</p> 
               <p>"Would you like me to sleep with you to-night?"</p> 
               <p>"Oh, if you will be so very good," shuddering. "I allers was cowardly. I never rested well when Abel wasn't to home. And this evening, somehow, I'm dreadful nervous."</p> 
               <p>It was a great sacrifice on the part of the young artist to forsake her own room and share the bed of the angular and<pb n="202-203" xml:id="VAC8154-00000100"/> unhappy woman, but her kindness would not permit her to do otherwise; so she locked her own door, bringing forth her night-dress and a bit of sewing, and saying,</p> 
               <p>"You look ill and tired. Go to-bed now, if you feel like it. I will sew an hour or two, and then follow you."</p> 
               <p>"I'm too fidgety to sleep yet. I'll set here and watch you sew. What on earth I should do, if it wasn't for you, Miss Bayles, I don't know. You're as good as a sister-better'n some. I'll never forget your conduct this evenin'. Abel allers declared there was nobody like you. I must wind up the clock. Only eight. It seems to be six days instead of six hours since them officers come in here and begun turnin' things over." Wearily, with sighs, she wound up the clock, whose busy pendulum had ticked away so many sad and happy hours of her life. When that was done, she looked about: "There's every thing in that bureau tumbled-up as they left it," she said; and as she went to it, to straighten its tossed contents, the sight of it, perhaps, reminded her of another good friend.</p> 
               <p>"I wonder if Mr. Dassel won't come to see me, when he hears about it? He was always so fond of Abel and the children."</p> 
               <p>"Oh, Lordy," she added, suddenly, sitting down, "now I remember it, them men said something about Mr. Dassel,-that it was him saw the lace behind the drawer, when he fixed the lock for me, the other day." The hands of her listener dropped into her lap, and she looked up eagerly, at this, while Mrs. Bellows wailed on:</p> 
               <p>"It never struck me what it meant till now. It must be that Mr. Dassel discovered it, and told of it. I did not think he would do it. No, for my sake, and little Toddle's, I should not have thought he would have done it. He knew how much trouble I had already; he was so friendly. If it had been <emph>you</emph> who found it, you would not have ruined us, I know,-and <emph>I thought so much of him!</emph>"</p> 
                
               <p>The tone of this complaint, in a woman less practical and more sentimental than Mrs. Bellows, would have betrayed a dangerous depth of interest in the man; but Miss Bayles understood it and the woman who uttered it, and whose tears again were falling in big drops over her sharp cheek-bones.</p> 
               <p>"He may have acted as he felt it his duty to act, no matter how personally painful such a course might be. He certainly appeared to think a great deal of your family. Have you seen your husband since he was arrested?"</p> 
               <p>"No, I couldn't leave the children. Some of the neighbors went with the officers to the officers to the police-court; they told me he was reg'larly committed to await his trial. I didn't ask 'em the particulars."</p> 
               <p>"Well, I shall stop, on my way up-town to-morrow morning, and see if they will permit an interview. I wish to hear what Abel has to say for himself, and to tell him that you will visit him as soon as you can get away from home."</p> 
               <p>"As to that, I'll think it over," answered the wife. All the dissatisfaction of years was stirred up in her heart, and though moments of tenderness overwhelmed her indignation, her prevailing mood was more of pity for herself and little ones, than for him who had brought them into this wretchedness.</p> 
               <p>And, indeed, there was plenty of reason for her self-pity and anxiety. She knew that an unpaid note of a hundred dollars threatened to sweep off their furniture, much of which had been her marriage-portion, and to which her pride clung as the proof of respectable "bringing-up.' She had no relative to whom she felt free to apply for aid. The rent was behind; and had it not been, she could not pay rent in so good a house as this, should she be compelled to earn support for herself and three children. Then, the disgrace! Keenest trouble, sharpest pang of all!</p> 
               <pb n="204-205" xml:id="VAC8154-00000101"/> 
               <p>It was a long time before she arose from her chair, and mechanically re-arranged the contents of the bureau; then, with a deep sigh, she withdrew into the sleeping-room, and Miss Bayles heard her weeping beside her children's bed.</p> 
               <p>A new direction had been given to this lady's thoughts by some revelation made by the owner of the bureau. She had been wakeful before: but now new thoughts and suspicions crowded upon her so <choice>
                     <sic>closley</sic>
                     <corr>closely</corr>
                  </choice>, that she felt it impossible to sleep. It was midnight when she laid down her sewing, and crept to-bed, without awakening the unhappy woman, whose heavy breathing showed that she had found transient relief from the care and sorrow which must beset her in the morning.</p> 
               <p>Miss Bayles breakfasted early, that she might not lose too much time in her purpose of seeing the prisoner. One of the line of cars which passed the Tombs was not much out of her ordinary path, and as she alighted before it and ascended the steps of that barbaric building for the first time, she realized something of the shame, wickedness, and despair which hung about it and over it like a stifling atmosphere.</p> 
               <p>Obtaining permission to see Abel Bellows, she was ushered into the damp room, by whose grated door the prisoner was sitting.</p> 
               <p>"Oh, is it you, Miss Bayles," he said, holding out his hand and smiling; yet she knew that, pleased as he was at seeing her, his first thought had been of his wife. "I might have known it. You're not made of the stuff that fades in washing."</p> 
               <p>"I come to bring you your wife's love, and to say that she will be around to see you as soon as she can get some of the neighbors to mind the children."</p> 
               <p>"She don't believe it, then?"</p> 
               <p>Her eyes sank before his eager look; she was truth itself, and could not declare that the wife did not accuse her husband.</p> 
               <p>"She hopes it is not so,-so we all do, Mr. Bellows."</p> 
               <p>"Hope-hope!" said the man, sarcastically,-"do I <emph>look</emph> guilty? Don't be afraid! Look at me well, and say,-for you are honest and true, Miss Bayles,-the best woman I know."</p> 
               <p>She did look full into his eyes, and answered him,</p> 
               <p>"You do <emph>not</emph> look guilty, Mr. Bellows, and I, for one, do not think you so. I have come to offer my services,-to ask what I can do for you. Shall I get you a lawyer?"</p> 
               <p>"Be kind to my wife and babies, Miss Bayles. I know I have left them in a tight place. If I should be kept here long I don't know what in the world they'll do;-starve, I suppose."</p> 
               <p>"Not while my purse holds out. You don't know how rich I am, Mr. Bellows. I've earned a good deal of money at Mrs. Grizzle's, and I certainly shan't let my friends come to hunger, while there's any left."</p> 
               <p>"Thank you; I believe what you say;"-there was a choking in Abel's throat, which he got rid of by a little cough, and then asked, the tears in his eyes, but laughing-"How's Toddle? and the other young ones?"</p> 
               <p>"All well. Toddle would hardly be satisfied to go to-bed without papa, last night."</p> 
               <p>"Nobody to say 'Blow the Bellows' to him-poor little man! This Bellows is blowed up, at last, Miss Bayles. I know who has done it, and I know he may prevail,-'twon't be the first time an innocent man has suffered."</p> 
               <p>"Who first accused you or suspected you?"</p> 
               <p>"Mr. Dassel. It seems he suspected me from the first. You can find the whole thing in the morning-papers, I s'pose. Read the report, and tell me, next time you come, what you think of it. He had reason to suspect me, from<pb n="206-207" xml:id="VAC8154-00000102"/> some slight betrayal I made, and he pretended friendship with my family, in order to have an opportunity to watch me, and prove or disprove his suspicions. It seems he had a pair of sleeve-buttons stolen from his desk at the time, and he learned that I had one of them, if not both. He found the button in the clock, when he went to wind it up, and in fixing the locks of the bureau, at my wife's request, he detected a piece of lace hidden between the draw and the back. In the meantime he had discovered that, though not otherwise dissipated, I spent a great deal on lotteries, and had got myself in debt. Borden &amp; De Witt believe I'm guilty. They believe every thing Mr. Dassel says."</p> 
               <p>"He has the gift of winning people's hearts."</p> 
               <p>"Not yours, Miss Bayles."</p> 
               <p>"No, indeed," blushing; "but I have admired him, and been singularly interested in him."</p> 
               <p>"So have I. The next time you come I want to talk it over."</p> 
               <p>"But I must go now. What can I do for you?"</p> 
               <p>"You've done all you can, in being good to my family,-and God bless you for it. There's front seats up above for such as you, Miss Bayles."</p> 
               <p>Miss Bayles had reasons for believing in the porter's innocence of which he was not aware. Disagreeable as it would be for her, a lady, to appear upon the witness-stand, she resolved that she would do it, if her testimony was likely to benefit Abel, as she believed it would. In the meantime, with the generosity of a most noble and womanly nature, she took his family under her protection.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XIV.</head> 
               <head type="sub">A CAMELIA IN THE HAIR MEANS "YES."</head> 
               <p>WHEN the family-circle is once disturbed, either by the withdrawal of one of its precious links or the addition of a stranger, how seldom is it again perfectly reunited in the same happy perfection as before! The Camerons had dwelt peculiarly in an atmosphere of love and peace. The parents, setting the example of mutual love and attention, bringing the rich stores of taste and cultivation into the service of their home, to beautify and spiritualize it, had drawn forth all the wealth of affection of which their children were capable.</p> 
               <p>Then, as we have seen, the misfortune of the youngest daughter had singled her out for the zealous and never-wearying service of love. Even the old servants fell under the influence of the universal spirit, performing their duties <foreign xml:lang="ITA">con amore,</foreign> as far as the household was concerned, whatever their private wranglings may have been. The air of the house was so pervaded by this delightful influence, that no one could cross its threshold without becoming aware of the charm. People always liked to visit the Camerons. Some said Mrs. Cameron was a good housekeeper; others that the gentleman of the house was so efficient in helping to entertain company; and again, that "they were such a sweet family;" but, however each one explained it to his or her satisfaction, the fact was there-it was a pleasant home, the abode of happiness.</p> 
               <pb n="208-209" xml:id="VAC8154-00000103"/> 
               <p>Since the breaking of Lissa's engagement, there had come a change. Each member of the circle was kinder, if possible, to the others than before; but Robbie's absence was keenly felt; and, in the depths of their hearts, father and mother mourned over the bitter experience which had so early fallen upon Elizabeth's warm, truthful nature. They felt momentary spasms of hate and aversion for the man who had caused her mortification and suffering, which, again, would leave them, under the irresistible influence of his candor, the spell of his accomplishments and grace; while, even had the feeling of dislike been permanent, they would have fought against it for Milla's sake.</p> 
               <p>Whether Louis Dassel were worthy or not; whether, as Lissa had begged her mother to observe, he had a selfish object in view, or really loved, as he seemed to, the fragile and exquisite creature who clung to him like the morning-glory to its pillar, certain it was that Milla's existence was bound to his, and that she would wither like that delicate vine if torn from the embrace into which her nature had grown.</p> 
               <p>At first they had designed to be very prudent, very reserved-to hold Milla in check, and permit no sudden ripening of her attachment; but the foothold which Louis had established in the family, and maintained for so long, made it difficult to adopt another manner to him now, unless the friendship were absolutely broken. For a few days he had remained grave, pressed down by sorrow and embarrassment, scarcely venturing to call; and then Milla had grown languid, lost her new bloom, and was so evidently dissatisfied and ill, that the anxious parents were fain to encourage Louis to resume his former relations. The feelings of Elizabeth must be sacrificed to the welfare of that frail blossom which had drawn already its bloom and perfume from the soil of their self-abnegation.</p> 
                
               <p>And thus the change came into the home atmosphere-still loving, more devoted than ever, but no longer peaceful.</p> 
               <p>Only a mother can enter into Mrs. Cameron's trials, and comprehend the conflicting feelings with which she strove to make up to Elizabeth, by the doubling of her own tenderness, for that indulgence which she was compelled to extend to Milla.</p> 
               <p>Milla's education, doubtless, had not been what it should have been. Her friends had erred, through too much love; Mrs. Cameron saw the error too late to remedy it. Sheltered, with extreme and jealous caution, from every cold breath of the outside world which might breathe upon her sensitiveness, she was unfitted for the least adversity. Repaying the fond attentions of her relatives by a passionate, impulsive affection, they had not been able to see that they had fostered the weed of selfishness along with the heavenly flower, until her conduct in this new phase of life betrayed it. Even now it seemed so much the thoughtless waywardness of a child, that they loved her and pitied her, and could not bring themselves to train her to the stern realities of duty. If Louis did love her, if she was so blessed in his society, it was, after all, a happier fate than they had dared to anticipate for her. Surely, Louis-no boy, but a man tried in suffering, knowing himself and her, patient, calm, wisely tender-would be a husband out of ten thousand for their afflicted darling.</p> 
               <p>Thus with trembling hopes the parents solaced their fears. Elizabeth, too, putting aside her own feelings, looked at the matter in the same light, praying secretly that such might be the truth. Cheerfully, gladly would she have given up all to Milla, though her life had gone with it, did she feel unfaltering confidence in the man she had once, and still, loved. The vague uneasiness which she felt,<pb n="210-211" xml:id="VAC8154-00000104"/> which lay about all her thoughts like a cloud, she could not show to others. She could only watch and pray.</p> 
               <p>Elizabeth was not quite a saint. Noble and generous to a fault, she was mortal, and felt the pangs of jealousy, the loneliness of unmated youth. There were times, as we have said, when her mood was reckless or despairing, as on the day of the invitation to Miss Bulbous' party. How <emph>could</emph> she bear it? Had not <emph>he</emph> borne her over all the rough places of a foreign tongue, and taught her soul to float on the river of Goethe's song? <emph>They</emph> had read "Faust" together, with the marvellous skill of Louis interpreting each separate character, and giving to the poet's utterance even more than its own rich meanings. Was she a statue to sit near and hear <emph>them</emph> discoursing to each other the impassioned tendernesses of Faust and Margaret?-and, somehow, as she mused, Dassel seemed not Faust, but Mephistopheles, and she thought of her brother's communication, and shuddered.</p> 
               <p>Mingled feelings like these had sent her forth on that impetuous drive and into the very arms, as it were, of Sam Grizzle's declaration. Now she stood in her own chamber, panting, like a hunted deer, while Sam, slamming the gate loudly in the strength of his sudden exultation, stood before his mother, luminous as a pumpkin-lantern.</p> 
               <p>"For the lord-sake, Sammy, how did you and Miss Lissa happen to be out a-ridin' together? I thought I saw you goin' off with Miss Bulbous?"</p> 
               <p>"So you did, mother. But <emph>she</emph> got tired of me, and shoved me off on to Miss Cameron."</p> 
               <p>"You seem to think it a good joke."</p> 
               <p>"Golly, mother, it is the luckiest thing that ever happened to me."</p> 
               <p>"No! you don't say? I declare, Sam, you hain't really had the spunk!"</p> 
                
               <p>"You don't think I'm such a fool as to let a chance like <emph>that</emph> slip? When a fellah's alone with the girl he likes, he'd be a ninny not to take advantage of that circumstance."</p> 
               <p>"Of course, Sammy. But I r'ally did not think you had the face. How'd you get along?-what did you say? You ought to have been as flowery as them dahlias and crysanthemums-said something r'ally genteel and nice. I hope you wasn't awkward, as your pa was when he asked me. Laws, how well I remember it! We was settin' on the horse-hair sofa with brass nails in the front parlor,-I'd been expectin' it for six weeks, and was all of a tremble with its being eleven o'clock at night, and he not speakin' for an hour, and thinkin' every minute that pa'd rap on the chamber-floor, and all of a sudden says he: 'Malvina!' and 'Oh dear,' says I, 'Mr. Grizzle, <emph>what?</emph>' and says he, 'How do you like the name of Grizzle?' and I said, all of a tremble, that he knew it was a favorite name of mine, and then, what do you think he went on-'Because,' said he, 'me and my partner was goin' to get a sign painted, and we're undecided whether to have it "Wigg &amp; Grizzle," or "Wigg &amp; Co." Wigg don't think Grizzle's a purty name for gilt letters; but if you like it, Malvina, <emph>that's</emph> enough.' I was mad as a hop-toad, and got right up, for the clock was strikin', and I knew I'd get a scoldin' in the mornin', but he put his arm around me and pulled me down again, and says he, "Tain't as sweet a name as your'n, Malvina, but if you'll exchange your'n for it, I'll have it painted on that sign in big gold letters as bright as the sun.'"</p> 
               <p>"Well," said Sam, who had been listening rather restlessly, "I should call that decidedly neat, mother,-not at all awkward. Sho! I remember that sign,-the same we had over the store in Greenwich-street."</p> 
               <pb n="212-213" xml:id="VAC8154-00000105"/> 
               <p>"But what did Miss Cameron say, Sammy?"</p> 
               <p>The pride of Rose Villa kicked a yellow crysanthemum in the face, smiled, and looked foolish.</p> 
               <p>"What did she say? You don't look as if she'd give you the mitten. Did she say 'yes,' out and out?"</p> 
               <p>"Well, no. She's to give me an answer to-night."</p> 
               <p>"Then it's as good as yes, for girls are mighty short and crusty when they mean no. It don't take 'em half so long to say no, as it does to give consent. It's their nature to hold back, Sammy. Law! when your pa really did ask, after keepin' me waitin' all winter, you'd better believe I didn't jump into his arms for the askin'. 'Twas a full week before that matter of the sign was settled."</p> 
               <p>Sam said nothing of the vehement refusal he had at first received; in fact, it appeared to him of no consequence compared with the last sentence spoken by Miss Cameron.</p> 
               <p>"She ain't nigh as well off as you, Sammy, but she's the most lady-like girl I know, and so sweet and good. I've been right-down jealous of Mrs. Cameron with them two sweet girls, and if she'll give one of 'em to us, they shan't have reason to repent it, my boy. No, indeed! Lissa Cameron will step right into our hearts as well as our house. Sammy, son, I'm proud of you.-I wish your pa was to home to hear the news,"-and Mrs. Grizzle wiped her eyes, and beamed afresh upon her darling.</p> 
               <p>"But, mother, please don't say a word about it yet. Of course I'm as good as accepted, but the lady hasn't said the word yet,-and what if she should back out?"</p> 
               <p>Sam's eyes rested on the river with a meditative and melancholy expression, which rendered them perfectly beautiful, in his mother's opinion. She did not see how Miss Cameron <emph>could</emph> resist him, and was not disposed to abate her congratulations.</p> 
               <p>"I hope she'll give you a decided answer to-night, for I long to give the dear girl a good squeeze, and welcome her to my family."</p> 
               <p>"There's Mr. Dassel coming over, mother. Let's talk of something else. Somehow, I've been infernally jealous of him. He's pumped me often, to find out what my intentions were; and I'd told him, quick enough, if I hadn't had a feeling that he was trying to cut me out. But she told me, to-day, she shouldn't marry him. I tell you, I breathed easier after that! I don't see how any girl can resist him, if he's a mind to make himself agreeable. Sometimes I'm in love with him myself."</p> 
               <p>"So be I," said the good matron, laughing and flushing. "He's a born gentleman. He don't forget to make himself agreeable to the married ladies as well as the young ones. Then, he's so pure, and so womanish in his feelings. There ain't any thing bad in his gallantry,-which is what makes it so delightful. Really, now, he feels as nigh to me as if he was my adopted son. I scarcely think of his being a baron, and all that. Look at him now! ain't he beautiful, walking along in the sunlight, his hair and beard glistening like amber!"</p> 
               <p>"Sho, mother, leave them compliments to the girls. I wish <emph>I</emph> was as handsome, though, and had such a walk. I've tried to carry my cane in his style, but I'm afraid I can't come it, after all."</p> 
               <p>The object of all this adulation opened the gate, and came up to the group in his graceful, princely way. It would have been impossible for the coldest critic to deny the magnificence of his personal appearance, or to refuse to acknowledge the magnetic power which breathed from his presence. Those dark-blue eyes, so like a child's in clear, limpid beauty, turned from mother to son.</p> 
               <p>"Why are you both so bright? Is it the sunshine, or is it some good news?"</p> 
               <pb n="214-215" xml:id="VAC8154-00000106"/> 
               <p>"We'd better ask you the same question," responded Mrs. Grizzle; "you fairly dazzled us as you came along."</p> 
               <p>"Oh, then it must be borrowed lustre. I've been in the company of a beautiful woman all the morning. She has been singing for me-German music and poetry at that,-and I've enjoyed it."</p> 
               <p>"Thank goodness, 'twasn't Lissa," muttered Sam to himself.</p> 
               <p>"Have you had lunch, Mr. Dassel?"</p> 
               <p>"No, I've not. Mrs. Cameron waited for her daughter, who was out, and I came away just as the bell rang."</p> 
               <p>"Well, I've been waitin' for Sam. So, we'll all go in now and have something. I begin to feel faint myself. Sam and Miss Lissa was out a-ridin' together, you see, and both was late."</p> 
               <p>The fond mother could not refrain from this slight hint at the important affairs in meditation.</p> 
               <p>"Oh, indeed," murmured Dassel, with a swift glance at Sam's burning face, whose eye met his own with a look of mingled bashfulness and triumph; "it's a pleasant day for a drive; I don't blame them for prolonging it to the verge of hunger."</p> 
               <p>"I don't feel any particular amount of appetite," said Sam. "I could have stayed out another hour or two as well as not. That horse Miss Cameron drives goes altogether too fast to suit me."</p> 
               <p>"Come along, my children," urged the matron, going towards the house. "Pierre told me he was making chicken-salad for lunch, and I've been thinkin' of it the last two hours."</p> 
               <p>"How fine it is to be one of your children, and be treated so handsomely," remarked Louis, walking by her side.</p> 
               <p>"Really now!" she answered, much gratified. "I don't see why I didn't have a larger family, when I'm so fond of 'em," she went on. "But I hope it'll soon be larger. Daughters-in-law are the next best thing to daughters,-and I know Grizzle will not act like a fool, he'll be so tickled when he begins to have grandchildren."</p> 
               <p>Dassel bit his lip. He knew of whom she was thinking as the future mother of her grandchildren, and a little thrill of disgust ran along his delicate nerves at thought of the mingling of such diverse elements. Would Bettine?-could Bettine? and he glanced aside at Sam, that new-made gentleman, with an expression which would not have been flattering had it been seen. He laughed a little sardonic laugh. If the girl could console herself with Sam Grizzle for <emph>his</emph> desertion, she would be better off, surely, in a worldly sense, than as his wife she could hope to be.</p> 
               <p>How much remorse was mingled with this consoling reflection does not appear. It was not enough to injure his appreciation of the salad, to which he did moderate and deliberate justice, after his habit; while Sam, quivering inwardly with excitement, found himself cheated out of his usual excellent appetite.</p> 
               <p>Susie was at the table, seated next to Mr. Dassel. He started, and changed color, when she, with a blushing shyness which betrayed the folly of her precocious little heart, leaned towards him, and slipping her hand into his arm, pressed it to gain his attention, and whispered eagerly,</p> 
               <p>"Do you know, Mr. Dassel, if they have had a letter from Robbie?"</p> 
               <p>"I believe not," he answered, with some asperity.</p> 
               <p>"Oh, please don't be cross with me, Monsieur le Baron," pouted the child, regaining her sauciness; "I only wanted to know if he had got safely across that great, ugly ocean."</p> 
               <p>Dassel muttered something to himself; then, regaining his good-temper, pinched Susie's rosy cheek, whispering,</p> 
               <p>"What interest have <emph>you</emph> in the matter, little lady?"</p> 
               <pb n="216-217" xml:id="VAC8154-00000107"/> 
               <p>"Oh, not any. Only he's a neighbor, you know, and I-promised not to forget to inquire."</p> 
               <p>"Exactly. Well, I will keep you informed. As soon as a letter arrives you shall hear of it. Probably there will be one for you also."</p> 
               <p>"No, there will not," regretfully. "Robbie wouldn't promise to correspond with me, though I asked him to."</p> 
               <p>"Unkind and ungallant! positively rude!" said the man of the world, with an amused smile. "To refuse a lady!"</p> 
               <p>"I think Robbie Cameron is very gentlemanly," replied Susie, with some indignation. "I should not have asked him. I should have waited for him to ask me. That is what women must always do-wait, and be silent,"-with a little sigh.</p> 
               <p>"Who taught you that, Miss Grizzle?"</p> 
               <p>"My own observation, Monsieur le Baron."</p> 
               <p>"Ah! but warm-hearted little ladies like you cannot always be so discreet. You made love to Robbie."</p> 
               <p>"Who told you so?" her cheeks flaming up.</p> 
               <p>"Who but Robbie? I'm afraid he laughed at you, my dear. If I were you I would have my revenge. Marry <emph>me,</emph> now, and show him that you do not care for him."</p> 
               <p>Susie did not hear this last consolatory advice; her breast was choked with rage and grief; to hide her tears, she jumped from her chair and ran out of the room.</p> 
               <p>"What's the matter with Susie?"</p> 
               <p>"I've been proposing to her, madame, and she runs away, in anger."</p> 
               <p>"If she was a few years older, Baron,-but you'll not wait. We're not at all blind at Rose Villa. We know what's about to happen. How curious it would turn out if we should all become one family, as it were,-wouldn't it, now?"</p> 
               <p>The baron bowed and smiled, glancing at poor blushing Sammy.</p> 
                
               <p>That afternoon, when Grizzle, senior, came home to dinner, he brought a note from Miss Bayles to his wife, which said that she could spare Saturday to put the finishing touches to that lady's portrait, if the diamonds were home and ready to be painted.</p> 
               <p>It seems Mrs. Grizzle's jewels had been at Ball &amp; Black's for some alterations in the setting, and had not been, as yet, transferred, in all their costly splendor, to the portrait.</p> 
               <p>"Why, yes," said the matron, reading the note over aloud at the table, "I can spare Saturday. You mustn't forget to call for them diamonds to-morrow, Grizzle,-and do be careful of 'em. They cost too much money to lose,-twelve thousand dollars in all, Mr. Dassel. You know you looked at 'em one day."</p> 
               <p>"You'll want them Monday, also, for Miss Bulbous' <foreign xml:lang="FRA">soire dansante,</foreign> will you not?" asked Mr. Dassel.</p> 
               <p>"To be sure. I forgot to tell you, Grizzle, about the party. Miss Bulbous gives one before she goes back to town. She said it was to be a small affair; but she never does things by halves. The whole neighborhood will be there, at least. Yes, I shall want my diamonds, and don't you forget 'em, Grizzle. Look-a-here, Sam, what are you going off before the dessert for, I'd like to know?"</p> 
               <p>"Oh, I ain't," said that young gentleman, coming back to his chair. "I was just looking out to see if it was fairly dark yet."</p> 
               <p>"Time enough, and to spare," said his mother, winking at Mr. Dassel. "The Camerons hain't finished their dinner yet. You mustn't go over before eight o'clock. Are you intending to spend the evening there, Mr. Dassel?"</p> 
               <p>"No, I think I'll take the next train to the city. Don't wait up for me, as I expect to stay all night. I've business early in the morning."</p> 
               <p>"Hurry up the fixings, then," said the lady of the house<pb n="218-219" xml:id="VAC8154-00000108"/> to the elegant head-waiter, "or Mr. Dassel will have to go without his coffee."</p> 
               <p>The profuse and rich dessert was brought on; the aroma of mocha floated through the brilliantly-lighted room, whose windows, looking on the lawn which lay betwixt the house and Mr. Cameron's grounds, were so private that the servants had not thought worth while to drop the blinds.</p> 
               <p>In the meantime, a solitary watcher was looking across into the cheerful gorgeousness of those windows. Lissa Cameron had stolen from their dinner before the courses were half served, to the darkness and loneliness of the library, which had not yet been lighted, and stood within the curtains of a window which overlooked Rose Villa. She was enduring the severest struggle of her life, save one. One other wretched afternoon she had been in a wilder tumult of conflicting feeling than now. As she thought of that afternoon, of all she had suffered since, of the future, she wrung her hands together in a silent passion of misery.</p> 
               <p>The moonless darkness deepened, and Rose Villa shone out brightly.</p> 
               <p>"They are warm-hearted," she murmured, "and they will give me money to do as I please. I can change many things about the house,-soften down their vulgarity, after a time-and they will be very kind to me. I can relieve my father of my support, so that he can do more for Milla and Robbie. Milla can remain at home under mother's care, and that will please Louis, who has always seemed so happy in our family-circle.</p> 
               <p>"I shall never marry any one for love, and why not this good-natured simpleton, and show Louis how I despise love, and can live without it? We will have a diamond-wedding, we will patronize him and Milla,-I will always be able to dress superbly. I believe with dress, and a little more experience, I could shine in society. He would see it!- He-" but why follow the wild thoughts of a heart which, in its misery, strove to gain a grain of comfort from unprofitable sources.</p> 
               <p>The moonless darkness deepened about the world; it was cloudy-no stars were in the sky; look where she would, there was nothing bright but Rose Villa, nearly all of whose windows flashed with light. She leaned her cold forehead, against the colder glass, staring out with eyes, which, if the hopeful lover over there could have seen, would have startled him. Suddenly the door, opening upon a side-porch, was thrown wide by a servant, and Dassel stood one moment on the threshold, the full blaze of a hall-chandelier falling upon him, revealing the graceful outline of his tall figure, the floating, golden hair and tawny beard, the smiling, handsome face; then the door closed, and all was dark; but she heard the echo of his step on the gravelled paths.</p> 
               <p>"I shall die," moaned Elizabeth; "he has killed me."</p> 
               <p>She sank on her knees, because strength failed her, looking out into the night with strained, burning eyes; the echo of his step died away; she heard the shriek and uproar of an approaching train, thundering over the road, which lay, out of sight, along the river, below the lawn; then, again, all was silence and darkness, save the glaring windows of Rose Villa, which, like bold eyes, seemed to laugh at her agony.</p> 
               <p>She knelt there in the shadow until the door again opened, and the hall-lamp, this time, beamed upon Sam Grizzle, coming forth, she well knew upon what errand. Oh, where should she go? what should she do to escape? There was no escape for her. What mattered it? To get away-only to get away from this house, where <emph>he</emph> came, where Milla's happy contentment mocked her!-yes, to get away from these maddening things, she would fly even into Sam Grizzle's arms.</p> 
               <pb n="220-221" xml:id="VAC8154-00000109"/> 
               <p>That calmness which is of despair settled down upon the storms which had tossed her nature. Presently she heard the door-bell, and Sam's voice asking for her. If she had placed her finger on her wrist then, her pulse would have flowed evenly beneath its touch. She did not wait to be summoned, but glided out of the library into the parlor, and said good evening to Sam with a grave smile, which turned him beet-color instantly. He would have dropped down on his knees, at meeting this smile, had not Mr. and Mrs. Cameron entered in time to prevent such an old-fashioned proceeding.</p> 
               <p>Lissa had said nothing to her mother of the proposal she had received. She felt that her mother would disapprove of it, because she could not blind those loving eyes to the impulses which alone could urge her to accept it. So the parents, unaware of the fervor of Sam's wish that they were otherwise engaged, and seeking to assist their daughter in the task of entertaining their stupid but well-meaning young visitor, exerted themselves to have him feel at ease.</p> 
               <p>It was a dull evening. Milla came in for a few moments, but Mr. Dassel was not coming, and she had sat so long at the piano during the day, that she was very tired and glad to slip out and give herself up to the care of old Sabrina. Sam was difficult to entertain. His mood was a mingled one, light and dark, like that new-fashioned triumph of cookery called marble-cake, and like that, on the whole, sweet. He answered with a broad smile to each and every remark, even when Mrs. Cameron asked him if he had noticed, in the evening papers, the death of a young gentleman, at Yonkers, by drowning, while bathing. Yet, while his face beamed like a sun-flower, he evidently was ill at ease. Whenever Lissa's eye by any chance met his, he made mysterious signs of distress, which, unstrung as were her nerves by the ordeal through which she had passed, struck upon them with the force of something intensely ludicrous. She laughed so much that her serene, gentle mother looked at her in surprise with reproof in her eyes. Thus do tragedy and comedy play side by side in the drama of life.</p> 
               <p>In the midst of her wretchedness, Lissa's hysterical humor was caught by every trifle. Her father, with a man's ignorance of a woman's nature, was delighted to see his favorite so bright and well. Not that she looked as she did during those happy summer-weeks, when such a roseate atmosphere of joy hovered about her; but to have her playful and mirthful was a gain. He did not wonder at her being amused with Sam Grizzle, who might have made the Sphinx laugh with some of his agreeabilities.</p> 
               <p>At last the silvery voice of the library-clock called ten. Sam cast a side-look of despair at Miss Cameron, and remarked,</p> 
               <p>"Don't let me keep you up beyond your common time, Mr. Cameron. Somehow, I don't feel sleepy, and if Miss 'Lizabeth would favor me with a little music, I could get along without your troubling yourselves."</p> 
               <p>The look which her father turned upon the guilty parties caused Lissa to beat a retreat to the piano. Her face was red, and her voice choked as she said,</p> 
               <p>"I will give you one song, and then you must go, Mr. Grizzle."</p> 
               <p>Sam smiled as usual, and came forward to turn the music.</p> 
               <p>"Now, Miss Lissa, you don't treat me fair," in a voice which he thought was as low as it was reproachful. "I shan't sleep a wink to-night, if you don't do as you promised."</p> 
               <p>Her hands ran over the keys, bending her head as if to read the notes before her, as she answered,</p> 
               <p>"Excuse me, Mr. Grizzle, the time has been so very<pb n="222-223" xml:id="VAC8154-00000110"/> brief. I have not talked with my mother. I <emph>cannot</emph> answer you to-night. Please go home, for I have thought so much my head aches."</p> 
               <p>"But when?" persisted the suitor. "Come, now, I'm in an awful way-"</p> 
               <p>"Well, why not say Monday evening, at the party? If I wear a camelia in my hair, it will mean 'yes.'"</p> 
               <p>"I'll send one over," said Sam, eagerly; "we've got lots of 'em in the hot-house."</p> 
               <p>"I shall find the flower if I need it."</p> 
               <p>"But that's <emph>three</emph> more days! I shan't know whether I'm standing on my head or my heels by that time. Why not say-" but Miss Cameron had burst into full song, and his plea was unheeded.</p> 
               <p>As soon as she had concluded, she arose and remained standing, and Sam had nothing to do but to bow himself into the hall, which he did with a reproachful smile, fixed, unhappily, full upon Mr. Cameron, instead of his daughter,-but in his confusion he was unaware of the difference.</p> 
               <p>"Why, Elizabeth, what's the matter with Mr. Grizzle? Does he mean that he has commenced an old-fashioned course of 'sparking,' by giving your parents permission to retire?"</p> 
               <p>Mr. Cameron was laughing heartily. Lissa kissed him and her mother quickly, and ran up-stairs to avoid further questioning.</p>

               <head type="sub">A MIDNIGHT PERIL.</head> 
               <p>THE next morning, at breakfast, the family were disposed to rally Lissa on the devotion of the heir to the splendors of Rose Villa.</p> 
               <p>"It is no jest," she said, in the midst of their mirth; "Mr. Grizzle has proposed marriage to me. He caught me, yesterday, where I could not escape, and had courage enough to declare himself."</p> 
               <p>"What did you say?"</p> 
               <p>It was Milla who asked the question; her parents remained silent. Lissa looked into her sister's eager face. "I have not decided yet; but I think I shall accept him."</p> 
               <p>"Oh, dear Lissa, I am so glad. Do you think you will really like him?-he's so good-tempered, and you can have all you wish."</p> 
               <p>"Well, yes," said Elizabeth, calmly; "Sam <emph>is</emph> good-tempered, and Rose Villa is a gorgeous sort of place. As you say, I need not live a life of self-denial. I infer, unless I flatter myself, that Mrs. Grizzle is very fond of me. I should have a good home."</p> 
               <p>Milla left her chair to kiss her sister's cheek, which flushed deep-red under her touch.</p> 
               <p>"I am so glad!" said the younger sister again, and the other felt as if a fine knife had stabbed her.</p> 
               <p>"You are upsetting my cup," she said, with a little mocking laugh.</p>

               <p>"I beg your pardon, sister, but I was so surprised. You will be so near us, and every thing will look so much brighter."</p> 
               <p>Milla's face glowed with pleasure. It was, indeed, only what she always had believed, that Lissa would soon have other suitors, and would love again, and be happy. It was only herself whose life, whose reason, were wrapped up in the devotion to one man! Then, too, to have all that shadow of remorse which she could but feel, lifted,-how perfectly happy she should then be! She returned to her chair, all smiles and excitement, while Lissa's face grew cold and fixed in its expression.</p> 
               <p>"I wish my parents to advise me," she said, presently. "I have promised an answer Monday. Of course, I should not accept him without their consent and approbation."</p> 
               <p>"But you must act as your own heart dictates."</p> 
               <p>Again that strange smile came at her father's remark. There was more satire in it than the poor child was aware of.</p> 
               <p>"If you have no serious objections to him or his family, I shall think favorably of it."</p> 
               <p>They <emph>had</emph> serious objections. Were not ignorance, incompatibility of tastes, serious objections? But it was true that their dear daughter was no longer happy at home, and if she decided in favor of Rose Villa, ought they to dissuade her? Such thoughts were in the minds of both, when Lissa continued-</p> 
               <p>"Don't let it spoil the breakfast. Father, your tea is getting cold. I want no one's decision to-day. Let the matter rest."</p> 
               <p>"Monday," repeated Milla, presently. "That's the day of the <foreign xml:lang="FRA">soire dansante.</foreign> Papa, do you know, I would like to go, and wear my jewels."</p> 
               <p>"How absurd!" her mother was about to say; but, ever careful of the child's feelings, she checked herself, answering instead,</p> 
               <p>"You are too young to wear many of them, my dear. You might wear the ear-drops,-they are small,-and something to fasten your sash."</p> 
               <p>"Oh, mamma, but I want them all,-at least, to take my choice out of them. It is an occasion of very great importance to me,-my first evening out as a young lady."</p> 
               <p>"You shall be dressed prettily, Milla; but I doubt if Mr. Dassel would approve of your making such a 'splurge,' as Robbie says."</p> 
               <p>"I'm quite willing to be guided by him," she answered, "only, do, please, papa, bring home the casket to-morrow."</p> 
               <p>"It will be some trouble. The fact is, I don't like to have them in the house, for fear of accidents."</p> 
               <p>"Then, of what use are they, pray? My aunt Mildred intended I should wear them, no doubt."</p> 
               <p>The voice trembled, the long lashes glittered with tears.</p> 
               <p>"What a baby you are! You must learn to control yourself better, my little girl," and Mr. Cameron, having risen from the table, swept the light form up in the hollow of his arm, and kissed the wet cheek. "When do you expect to assume wifely dignities unless you grow out of babyhood?"</p> 
               <p>The blue eyes flashed up into his with a singular look which haunted him all day, he knew not why.</p> 
               <p>"Bring home the casket, papa; if it is lost I will take the consequences."</p> 
               <p>How willful Milla was growing! Mrs. Cameron looked at her with sternness. She wondered that the child, who usually shrank from drawing attention to herself, who would not play or sing for strangers, nor wear any dress which might attract especial observation, should now seek<pb n="226-227" xml:id="VAC8154-00000112"/> to make herself an object of remark, and probably ridicule, by an undue splendor of jewelry.</p> 
               <p>"Louis will laugh at her, when he hears of her intention, and that will be the end of it," the mother consoled herself by thinking.</p> 
               <p>Mrs. Cameron was hurried, that morning, and was obliged to put aside these weighty matters for affairs of minor interest. The dressmaker had arrived; there was plenty of work awaiting her; and as soon as <foreign xml:lang="LAT">pater familias</foreign> could be kissed all 'round, and decently hurried out of the house, the ladies repaired to the sewing-chamber.</p> 
               <p>"What is first upon the carpet?"</p> 
               <p>"Oh, mamma, I wish you would allow my gray suit to be made up first. It could be finished by to-morrow night."</p> 
               <p>"But Lissa wishes her blue-silk gored and trained for the <foreign xml:lang="FRA">soire.</foreign>"</p> 
               <p>"There will be ample time to do that Monday. We will help all we can."</p> 
               <p>"What is the haste about the gray suit, Milla?"</p> 
               <p>A burning blush rose to the young girl's cheek; her eyes sank; but in an instant she raised them, saying in a low voice, that the sempstress might not hear,</p> 
               <p>"Mr. Dassel has promised to take me riding Sabbath afternoon. You know how fastidious he is, and I would like to wear something suitable."</p> 
               <p>"Well, well, child, I will see what can be done,"-and Milla was soon gratified, by having her dress in process of making.</p> 
               <p>That day and the next Mrs. Cameron and Elizabeth were apparently absorbed in patterns, trimmings, etc. Whatever was in either mind, there was opportunity to say but little; the subject of Sam's hopes was not even referred to Milla, useless and sweet, as usual, flitted in, occasionally, to note the progress of her own garments; Louis spent a part of both afternoons alone with her, in the parlor; no one, not even her mother, noticed her nervous manner, nor the feverish flush upon her cheek. She was unusually gay; they, unusually busy.</p> 
               <p>Saturday evening Mr. Cameron brought home two precious things; firstly, Milla's casket of jewels, secondly, a letter from Robbie. The boy was well, not homesick, happily settled in his school; the only accident he had met with was that upon going aboard the steamer. Every body cried over the first foreign letter, although there was nothing to cry about, but rather, reason for rejoicing. There was a little sealed note in the missive, directed to Lissa. Her fingers quivered as she opened it; but when she saw how brief it was, she grew calmer, reading hastily:</p>

               <p>"Deluded boy!" she murmured, with a sad smile, putting the note in her pocket.</p> 
               <p>After dinner, the casket was opened, and the jewels again examined.</p> 
               <p>"I hope no thief is looking, with wicked eyes, through the window," remarked Dassel, stepping up to the blind and dropping it,-they were in the library, and the two sisters had hung themselves about with tremulous sparkles of dew and fire congealed in gems; they were trying the effect, Milla in triumph, Lissa with sharp recollections of what had once been whispered to <emph>her.</emph>
               </p> 
               <p>"You make me shudder!" cried Milla, turning pale, and stealing closer to the speaker, as if for protection.</p> 
               <pb n="228-229" xml:id="VAC8154-00000113"/> 
               <p>"Such a thing might happen once in a thousand times," he answered lightly. "At all events, we'll drop the curtain between us and possible prying eyes. Mrs. Grizzle is very careless of her jewels. I don't believe the drawer in which they are placed is half the time locked. 'Easy come, easy go,' as the saying is. She has not so many as are here, of course; yet more than I should think she would care to lose. Well, little one, did the dressmaker finish the dress?"</p> 
               <p>"She did, Louis."</p> 
               <p>"Why, how grave you are about it! It seems to be a matter of serious moment to my little lady here, whether she goes riding to-morrow in a new dress or an old one."</p> 
               <p>"It is the first time, you know," said Milla, coloring.</p> 
               <p>"If it should be cold, we'd have to wrap you up in a rabbit-skin and hide the pretty dress. So what matters it!"</p> 
               <p>Mr. Dassel was in the gayest conceivable humor. The rest of the family involuntarily caught the infection. When Mr. Cameron proposed a game of chess with Louis, he was clamored against for selfishness; social converse was the order of the evening, and none should be so exclusive as to withdraw themselves from it. Mrs. Cameron was happy in the knowledge that Robbie's journey had been completed; all other anxieties she put away for the hour, the more readily that Elizabeth appeared more like her old self.</p> 
               <p>It was late when Mr. Dassel betook himself to the shelter of Rose Villa.</p> 
               <p>"Be very careful of the casket, little one," he said again, as he was going away. "Where shall you keep it to-night?"</p> 
               <p>"Under my pillow, if papa will allow me. They say, 'Uneasy lies the head that wears a crown.' I want to try how a head lies on a casket of diamonds."</p> 
               <p>Milla always had slept alone in her own pretty room; but Sabrina, her faithful attendant, had a closet out of it in hearing of her young mistress, where if the child did but sigh in her sleep, she could fly to her. This night, Milla was a long while preparing for bed; finally, she bade Sabrina retire, and the latter heard her murmuring passionate prayers for a full half hour, on her knees, in the chilly midnight. After she was finally in bed, she tossed and sighed until it seemed as if she would never compose herself; at length she slumbered, and the old nurse, relieved of care, sank into a deep sleep.</p> 
               <p>Out of this she was aroused by the loud screams of Milla, and springing up, and rushing into her room, she just saw the dim outline of a man's form on the balcony outside the window before it disappeared.</p> 
               <p>"Oh, Lordy! Oh goody gracious me!" joined in the nurse, standing still and clapping her hands, instead of rushing to the open window and endeavoring to track the intruder. It was not until Mr. Cameron came upon the scene, and actually forced an explanation from them, that any effort was made to follow the man. It was then too late, His examination of the balcony showed that a ladder, which had been used on the place in gathering fruit from the trees, had been brought and raised to the balcony, making it a very simple thing for the robber to ascend. Milla, thoughtless of danger, had left the sash up a few inches, so that he had only to softly raise it in order to find himself in her apartment.</p> 
               <p>Mr. Cameron's next thought was to ascertain if he had succeeded in his object. If the casket was gone, he should at once attempt pursuit.</p> 
               <p>"No, papa, here it is," cried poor Milla, shaking as if in an ague-fit.</p> 
               <p>"Probably he made some slight noise in opening the window, which awakened you just in time to save your fortune, Milla."</p> 
               <pb n="230-231" xml:id="VAC8154-00000114"/> 
               <p>"I don't know. I was sound asleep, when I suddenly opened my eyes and saw a man standing in the middle of the room. My night-lamp was burning very low, but I saw him distinctly. I do not know how I managed to scream, for my heart seemed to be in my throat, so that, at first, I could not make a sound."</p> 
               <p>"You did berry well at de hollerin' bisness, Miss," said Sabrina; "an' I reckon I did a little myself when I saw dat spook on de balcony."</p> 
               <p>"You saved your casket by it, that's evident," said Mr. Cameron.</p> 
               <p>"And her life too, perhaps," added the mother, sitting on the bed, and soothing the trembling girl by holding her hands.</p> 
               <p>Many were the questions asked about the appearance of the burglar, etc., but Milla could give no account of him, except that he wore a mask and had on light clothes. Mr. Cameron, revolver in hand, went outside and reconnoitred his premises; but, of course, the intruder had fled at the first alarm.</p> 
               <p>"You'll be glad to get the jewels back in their safe, won't you, sister?" said Lissa, when the excitement had partially subsided.</p> 
               <p>"Not until after the <foreign xml:lang="FRA">soiree,</foreign>" was the answer-Milla could be a trifle obstinate when inclined. "But I shall not object to papa's taking them, and allowing them to keep company with his revolver."</p> 
               <p>"Now that some one evidently knows of their being in the house, we cannot be too careful. How singular! I must have been tracked from my own office. But it is getting light in the east. Let us not lose our morning nap."</p> 
               <p>"I will share Milla's bed the rest of the night," said Lissa; "and if you will leave your room-door open, we shall not be afraid,"</p> 
                
               <p>No further adventure was met with that night. The family were late to their Sunday breakfast. Milla looked as if she had not slept at all; she was so agitated and nervous that her mother advised her not to think of going to church, but to lie down and rest all the forenoon, that she might feel like enjoying the promised drive in the latter part of the day.</p> 
               <p>Before breakfast Mr. Cameron and his men had made an examination of the premises, and picked up the mask worn by the burglar, which had been thrown away on the road, quite a distance from the house.</p> 
               <p>After breakfast, he went over to Rose Villa, to ascertain if any attempts at entering that place had been made. Nothing was amiss there, although Sam declared he had heard a window open and shut in the night; at which the others laughed, while Mrs. Grizzle remarked that she must be more careful of her things, which were liable to be stolen any day or night-she was so heedless about locks.</p> 
               <p>"I told you, last evening, somebody might be looking in at the window," said Mr. Dassel. "I have no doubt you were followed from the city. Sometimes these scoundrels will keep their eyes on a thing for months. I remember once, I had a large sum of money, in gold, sent to me from Paris, by express, to Baden-Baden. When it arrived, I was notified by the messenger, who warned me to be cautious, as he was informed that it had been followed all the way from Paris by two celebrated thieves. I took it, quietly, to my room in the hotel, saying nothing about the nature of the package, my own servant carrying it, intending, on the morrow, to pay some debts to a broker there, and take home the remainder of the coin. That night my servant wished to sleep in my apartment; but I said, 'No, I was not afraid.' I had, however, a small dog, a pet of mine, and one of the most sagacious little fellows that ever belonged to his race.<pb n="232-233" xml:id="VAC8154-00000115"/> It was in the latter part of the night, and I was fast asleep, forgetful of money or its responsibilities, when I was awakened by the cold nose of my dog, pressed silently against my face. Every faculty was instantly sharpened by a consciousness of peril. It was perfectly dark, my candle having burned out, and I knew not but that some one was already in my room. I lay, quietly, listening. I could just hear the velvet patter of my dog's feet, who seemed to have muffled his toes on purpose, going about the floor; and again he came back and laid his nose to my face, still without a sound. Upon finding that I was awake, he went off again. I thought best to follow him; and with my pistol in my hand I crept noiselessly out of bed, and walked in the direction of the door. When about six feet from it, I heard a peculiar noise, scarcely audible, but persistent. I knew it at once. Some one was sawing off the bolt! All right; let him work away! I stationed myself close to the door, in such a position that, when it was opened, I could shoot the intruder; my dog stood at my side, pressing against my leg, but making no sound. In fifteen minutes there was a slight rattling, as of something dropping, a cessation of the sawing, a moment's profound silence, during which, I suppose, the burglar was also listening. Had my dog barked then, or stirred, one of the most noted of Parisian thieves would not have been winged; but the brave little fellow knew better. Presently the door was pushed softly, slowly, ajar; then there was the flash of my pistol, the report, an alarm through the house, persons running to the scene, lights,-and upon the floor, bathed in his own blood, the would-be robber. He was seriously, not mortally wounded, and was taken care of by the police. His companion was also arrested in his attempt to escape. For some days my little dog was the lion of Baden-Baden."</p> 
               <p>"I have no doubt his dogship was more worthy of distinction tinction than many of the lions who have attracted attention in that bad little city," said Mr. Cameron. "Do you dine with us to-day, Louis?"</p> 
               <p>"Thank you; Mrs. Grizzle has held out inducements for me to remain at home. But tell Miss Milla, please, that I shall be at the door at half-past two."</p> 
               <p>Mr. Cameron thought it prudent to remain at home that morning. His wife and eldest daughter drove to the little country church, whose Gothic arches rose amid the shadows of a beautiful wood, now gorgeous with every autumn tint, as if the windows had been illuminated of "God's first temples." Never before had Elizabeth prayed as she prayed that day, for guidance and wisdom to do right,-not to wrong others because she was tried and tempted, but to suffer meekly, and wait with patience. In the fervor of her aspirations, the temptation to marry from pique and pride was put far away. Even Sam Grizzle had his rights, and she would not wed him, with no intention of making him happy. She resolved to wear no camelia to the party, but to make preparations to leave her home within the week for a long visit to Newburg.</p> 
               <p>It was with something of holy peace in her heart that she sat in her room, after the one o'clock Sabbath dinner, her Bible open in her lap, the pale November sunshine streaming through the window. While she sat thus, the sound of light wheels grated on the drive. Mr. Dassel, with a handsome little carriage and fast horse, was waiting for Milla, who came into her room, smiling, but very pale, to ask her how the new suit looked, and to kiss her "goodbye until tea-time."</p> 
               <p>"You look charmingly, Milla; it is very becoming to you. But how cold your hands are! You must take a thick shawl; you will need it before you return."</p> 
               <p>Milla's dress and mantle were of some rich grey material,<pb n="234-235" xml:id="VAC8154-00000116"/> trimmed with velvet of the same color. The little grey felt hat, with one grey and one scarlet plume, was as pretty as it could be, with her lovely golden hair floating out from under it, about her child-like, exquisite face.</p> 
               <p>"I wanted to kiss mother, but she is asleep," said Milla,-"no, I'm not cold-only a little excited. Good-bye, dear, darling Lissa!"</p> 
               <p>"I hope you will enjoy yourself as much as you anticipate, sister."</p> 
               <p>"Oh, I shall. I am very happy. The day is so beautiful-and did you see what a handsome little turn-out?"</p> 
               <p>"Yes; none too nice for you, Milla. But you are so pale-your hands tremble."</p> 
               <p>"I had such a shock last night; I've been trembling all day. But I must not keep Louis waiting. He may grow impatient."</p> 
               <p>"If he ever is impatient with <emph>her,</emph> I shall grow to hate him," mused Elizabeth, closing her door after the dear little deformed, beautiful sister, who flung a kiss to her from the stairs.</p> 
               <p>She did not look to see them drive away in the sunny afternoon. She only reopened her Bible, forcing herself to read in it, at first mechanically, until she felt the meaning of the words, and was comforted by its promises.</p> 
               <p>It was dark when Mr. Dassel set Milla down in the vestibule of her father's house. If it had not been so dark, Mr. Cameron could have seen that his horse was sweating, as if he had been driven far and rapidly.</p> 
               <p>"I did not think you would be out so late. I am afraid you have taken cold, my child."</p> 
               <p>"No, mother, I am not cold. Louis went further than I expected; the roads were so fine and the air so bracing. We had a shawl."</p> 
               <p>As Milla came into the full blaze of the lighted library, where a small fire had been kindled in the grate in anticipation of her being chilly, and whose lamps were all burning, she did not seem to have suffered from the night-air. Her eyes were flashing, her cheeks red, her whole face radiated light.</p> 
               <p>Her father drew her down on his knee, complimenting her on her new dress. She doffed her little grey hat, leaned her head on his shoulder, and fell into a deep reverie.</p> 
               <p>"There's Louis," she presently exclaimed, before any one else had heard his step. "He will take tea with us, mamma. Let us have it here, in the library. It is so pleasant, with this fire."</p> 
               <p>Her whim was humored. Tea was brought into the library. The family long remembered how beautiful, how gay, their darling was that evening.</p>

               <head type="sub">THE BEGINNING OF THE END.</head> 
               <p>MISS BULBOUS was favored with a clear, starry night for her <foreign xml:lang="FRA">soire dansante,</foreign> which was a good thing in the country, where the invited have, some of them, to come quite a distance over unilluminated roads. The rooms were pretty well filled when the Camerons arrived.</p> 
               <p>"Where is Miss Milla?" asked the fair hostess, magnificent in pale yellow satin and pearls, with a trail like that of a comet, as Mrs. Cameron appeared before her.</p> 
               <p>"She is coming with the Grizzles, thank you. Their carriage was larger than ours, and they offered her a place."</p> 
               <p>"I hope they'll not be late. I depend upon Mr. Dassel to direct the German. If Mrs. Grizzle <emph>should</emph> take it into her head that it was aristocratic to come late, she would not appear before midnight. I never did see a woman so infatuated on the subject of style;" and Miss Bulbous curled her lips, giving a sly glance backward, to see if her train was properly displayed, as we may have observed a peacock do when handsomely perched on a suitable fence.</p> 
               <p>"If she knew that you expected Mr. Dassel to take a leading part, she would be here in due season, for she is very proud of him," said Mrs. Cameron, with a smile.</p> 
               <p>"He's a real baron, isn't he-not of the French barber kind?" queried their hostess. "They say he's splendidly accomplished."</p> 
               <p>"They can hardly exaggerate his accomplishments. He is one of those true gentlemen who have given up ease and rank for an idea of right."</p> 
               <p>"Oh, how nice! I should love to hear him expatiate on the subject! I should think you'd set your cap for him, Miss Cameron.</p> 
               <p>"It would be better for <emph>you</emph> to do that," was Elizabeth's quiet reply, "since you have money enough for both."</p> 
               <p>What Miss Bulbous would have said to this is not known, as the tide of company was at its height, and the Camerons were drifted on beyond their hostess. Elizabeth glanced uneasily at every new arrival. She was dreading the advent of Sam Grizzle.</p> 
               <p>When she dressed, that evening, for the party, she stood long before her mirror, after the last possible touch had, apparently, been given to her toilette. Finally, she turned, and said to her mother, who had entered her chamber to ask if she were ready,</p> 
               <p>"Are there any camelias in the conservatory, mamma?"</p> 
               <p>"There is one very fine blossom; I noticed it this afternoon."</p> 
               <p>"How would it look in my hair?"</p> 
               <p>"<emph>I</emph> should like to see it there," answered Milla; "your hair is so dark,-and the white flower would look well with your blue dress. Let Sabrina bring it."</p> 
               <p>"Shall I?" asked Lissa, again, of her mother.</p> 
               <p>"Of course, my dear, if you fancy it."</p> 
               <p>Elizabeth sat down, with thoughtful eyes, while Sabrina brought the flower.</p> 
               <p>"Let me place it for you. You will not refuse to let me fasten it with this little brooch, sister? and, remember, it is a gift from me."</p> 
               <p>"I will wear the brooch to please you, Milla, 'for this occasion only.' Make it secure, for I should dislike to lose it."</p> 
               <pb n="238-239" xml:id="VAC8154-00000118"/> 
               <p>Milla was dressed in white. She wore a pair of solitaire ear-rings, but had been dissuaded from the rest of the jewels, which Sabrina was to take special charge of during their absence.</p> 
               <p>"What's the matter with you, Sabrina?" asked Mrs. Cameron. I know you've been crying. If you have any trouble, why do you not share it with us? I should think we have been your friends long enough."</p> 
               <p>The old woman began to cry and sob.</p> 
               <p>"Don't worry yourself about her, mamma. I know what is the matter with her; it is nothing serious," said Milla, a little impatiently.</p> 
               <p>"I must know all about it if you are in trouble, tomorrow, nurse."</p> 
               <p>"Yis, yis, to-morrow you know all about it, true 'nuff," muttered Sabrina, wiping her eyes.</p> 
               <p>"I wish the Grizzles would come for you before we leave, Milla. I do not like to go first."</p> 
               <p>"Oh, never mind that, mamma. There's Mr. Dassel now, coming to keep me company until they call. It cannot be many moments. I will take my cloak and bouquet, and go down to the parlor with you."</p> 
               <p>They all went down, the old nurse following, to fasten the door after they should be gone. Mr. Dassel was in the hall.</p> 
               <p>"Don't fear-I'll take good care of the little girl," he said, as Mrs. Cameron answered her husband's question, if she was ready. "Madame Grizzle promised to be here in less than ten minutes."</p> 
               <p>"Keep your cloak well about you; it will be chilly," called the mother, looking back through the vestibule, to where her darling stood, under the lamp in the hall, clinging to Mr. Dassel's arm, and watching her friends depart with a face the color of her dress.</p> 
                
               <p>"Yes, mother."</p> 
               <p>The carriage-door was closed, the horse started. Sabrina stood on the porch, looking after them.</p> 
               <p>"Milla was so pale, wife, I'm afraid this excitement is not good for her."</p> 
               <p>"She always changes color so easily. She may look like a rose by the time she arrives at Miss Bulbous'."</p> 
               <p>Now the first detachment had arrived, they looked vainly, for some time, for the second. Elizabeth supposed she had the camelia in her hair, and was not anxious for the moment when Sam Grizzle should enter the rooms, and fix his greedy eyes upon it. In walking about she came opposite a mirror, in a small boudoir, nearly deserted. It was natural that she should glance at her image-that she should look for the fatal flower which she had chosen as the signet for a life-long bondage of soul and body. Why did she start and smile when she found the camelia gone? The blossom had dropped from her hair. Where she had lost it, she did not know,-probably in getting out of the carriage.</p> 
               <p>"I prayed to God to decide for me," she murmured, "and He has done it."</p> 
               <p>"Miss Bulbous is getting quite out of patience," said her mother, finding Elizabeth in the corner where she had remained, watching the brilliant groups down the vista of handsome rooms, idly listening to the sweet music, but busily thinking over the temptations of the last few days, and rejoicing in her escape.</p> 
               <p>"Mother, I feel uneasy; it is strange they do not come."</p> 
               <p>"I do not see that we need to feel uneasy. What possible accident could have happened? Miss Bulbous will be obliged to choose another leader for the German, which is nothing so very serious."</p> 
               <p>By this time nearly every one expected had arrived. There was quite a crowd, considering that it was a country-neighborhood<pb n="240-241" xml:id="VAC8154-00000119"/> neighborhood party almost entirely, the only exceptions being a dozen or two of young men from town, required as partners in the dance, and about to be useful, also, in keeping champagne corks flying during the approaching supper. Miss Bulbous selected one of these important members of modern society to the leadership, and the dancing began.</p> 
               <p>Elizabeth was asked to participate, and did not decline. She was glad to be thus engaged when Sam should arrive. She asked her mother to take the diamond brooch from her hair, and place it in the lace at her throat.</p> 
               <p>"I lost the camelia, mamma, and cannot replace it."</p> 
               <p>"Never mind, you are well enough without it."</p> 
               <p>Elizabeth enjoyed the dancing. The music was delicious, the evening cool, the space quite liberal allotted to the dancers; she felt her spirits rise as they had not done for weeks. She was standing, with her partner, near the head of the <foreign xml:lang="FRA">salon,</foreign> awaiting their turn in the grand round, when she saw the long-expected party arrive and slip up the broad staircase, to divest themselves of their wrappings-or, rather, a part of it-for, while Mr. and Mrs. and Mr. Samuel Grizzle were there, they were unaccompanied by her sister and Mr. Dassel. A cold wind seemed to strike her from the opened door; she shivered to her heart's core; a sudden dimness came over the lamps; her partner addressed her, and she smiled mechanically, not knowing what he said; the music, so sweet, rising and falling in such lightly-palpitating beats of ecstacy, sounded afar off, as if her ears were filled with water. It did not sound like dance-music; it seemed to wail, "farewell! farewell!"</p> 
               <p>Yet Elizabeth could not tell what she dreaded. She longed to fly to the dressing-room, and ask Mrs. Grizzle why Milla had not come; but at that moment, her partner's hand touched hers; she was swept off in a throbbing wave of music-became a beautiful form and color in the shifting kaleidoscope of the dance. It was half an hour before she could release herself from its flying enchantments.</p> 
               <p>In the meantime Sam had come upon the scene, and was watching her from a distance, sadly aware that she wore no camelia, his heart swelling inside of his white silk vest, and aching dreadfully.</p> 
               <p>"Dang it, she's a regular flirt, or she wouldn't have kept me hanging by the gills all this time, and let me flounder back into the water at last. I didn't think it of her,-I didn't. Sho! what'll ma say? She'll be nigh about as disappointed as I am. She's made all her calculations, even to letting us have the blue-and-white front room upstairs, for our private setting-room. And now she's dancing away with White Glover, without a speck of regard for our feelings. I'm awful mad at her! I hope Glover will get her fond of him, and then give her the go-by. No, I don't, either; I can't bear to see <emph>any</emph> man near her. Oh, lordy, I don't see why she couldn't take a fancy to me. I never saw her look nicer than she does to-night. She's just the figure for them gored dresses and trains. You might as well put 'em on a barrel of prime beef as on ma. Oh, dear! I believe I'll go back home and go to-bed; I'm sick!"</p> 
               <p>"What's the matter, Mr. Grizzle?" asked the soft voice of a witching little creature near at hand, who heard his unconscious groan.</p> 
               <p>"Thank you, Miss Jennie, I don't feel well this evening; I'm sorry I came out. I believe I'll go home."</p> 
               <p>Now Miss Jennie had noticed the forlorn look with which Sam had watched lovely Miss Cameron, and guessed at the nature of his disease; so she asked him, sympathetically,</p> 
               <p>"What is it, Mr. Grizzle? headache or heartache?"</p> 
               <p>"Sho!" said Sam, "'taint heartache, that I know of! I eat tapioca pudding for dinner, and it never agrees with me."</p> 
               <pb n="242-243" xml:id="VAC8154-00000120"/> 
               <p>"Then you should not have been so weak as to eat it. Never yield to the temptation to take what disagrees with your constitution," and the merry eyes glanced over at Miss Cameron. "But what there can be in tapioca pudding to injure you, puzzles me. It would not harm a baby."</p> 
               <p>"May-be it wasn't that, Miss Jennie; it might have been the pickled tongue."</p> 
               <p>"I rather think it <emph>was,</emph> Mr. Grizzle. But I wouldn't go home, if I were you. You'll feel better by-and-by."</p> 
               <p>"If you say you'll dance with me when this everlasting German is over, I'll stay."</p> 
               <p>"Remain, then, by all means."</p> 
               <p>"There's other girls who appreciate me, if <emph>she</emph> don't," thought Sam, somewhat appeased by the flattering attentions of the pretty one by his side; "perhaps when she sees what a favorite I am, she'll be sorry she didn't put that flower in her hair."</p> 
               <p>But Lissa was not thinking of the flower nor Sam; she was longing to get away, and ask her mother or Mrs. Grizzle why Milla and Louis had not arrived. She would have been still more anxious had she heard what was said when Mrs. Grizzle finally appeared before her hostess, and was mildly chided for her delay.</p> 
               <p>"I like not to have come at all. I never was in such a fluster in my life before," panted the new arrival.</p> 
               <p>"I don't think we should have come away, as it was," added Mr. Grizzle, mysteriously. "It's dreadful to have so much money as never to have no peace of your life."</p> 
               <p>"What <emph>can</emph> you mean?" asked Miss Bulbous.</p> 
               <p>"Why, my dear Miss Bulbous, don't you see what a state I'm in-not fit to come to your party? I declare, I'm ashamed of my rig," seriously rejoined Mrs. Grizzle.</p> 
               <p>"What's the matter with it?" again questioned the hostess, scanning the round of point-lace on the head and the emerald-green velvet about the form of her visitor with a puzzled look.</p> 
               <p>"Why, my diamonds, my dear! Don't you miss my diamonds!"</p> 
               <p>"You don't mean to tell me-"</p> 
               <p>"Can't find hide nor hair of 'em!" ejaculated Grizzle, <foreign xml:lang="FRA">pre.</foreign>
               </p> 
               <p>"I spent two whole hours, lookin', and that's what's kept us so late."</p> 
               <p>"Stolen?"</p> 
               <p>"I'm afraid so. Yes, I'm almost certain. Still, they <emph>may</emph> turn up yet. You see, I had 'em out Saturday, for Miss Bayles to paint; and she and Susie put them back in my bureau-drawer, and locked 'em up. Susie is sure of it. I oughtn't to have left it for them, that's so! Grizzle was going to have a safe brought home this week,-we've talked about it, ever since we got the silver-set and them diamonds. But I didn't really think any body would take 'em."</p> 
               <p>"Who's Miss Bayles-that artist you had there? It's probable she has taken them. I'm surprised you should have left them in her hands. Those kind of girls are so apt to be dishonest."</p> 
               <p>Mrs. Grizzle colored a little as she replied,</p> 
               <p>"I've known Miss Bayles from a child. I can't believe she took 'em. Perhaps they're mislaid. I still hope it will turn out so; and if I lay hands on 'em again, I shall be more careful."</p> 
               <p>"What is it?" asked Mrs. Cameron, who had just become aware of their entrance, and had come forward to take Milla under her charge.</p> 
               <p>"My diamonds are gone. That's what delayed us so."</p> 
               <p>"Is it possible!" said Mrs. Cameron. "Then the robber must have entered your premises after all."</p> 
               <p>"I'd forgot all about that occurrence over to your house,"<pb n="244-245" xml:id="VAC8154-00000121"/> exclaimed Mr. Grizzle. "Well, Malvina, you may give up the whole thing as a dead loss. That burglar's got 'em, sure enough!"</p> 
               <p>Mrs. Grizzle sank into a chair, quite faint at the probability.</p> 
               <p>"Come here, Cameron," called the pork-merchant, across the room. "That burglar did purty well, after all. He's got wife's diamonds."</p> 
               <p>For a few moments there was an animated discussion of the loss. Both Mr. Cameron and Mr. Grizzle thought the robbery had been effected in the day-time, probably when a part of the family were at church-perhaps by the connivance of some dishonest servant.</p> 
               <p>"But where is Milla?" her mother at length inquired; "is she waiting for me to bring her down?" thinking the young girl, in her morbid fear of strangers, was lingering in the dressing-room for her mother's escort.</p> 
               <p>"Milla? Why, she and Mr. Dassel came with you, didn't they?"</p> 
               <p>"Not at all. We understood that you were to bring them in your carriage. We left them awaiting you, two hours ago."</p> 
               <p>Mrs. Cameron was chagrined at this awkward misunderstanding, by which the couple had been cheated out of their evening's entertainment. It must have been dull, sitting and waiting, only to be disappointed at last,-and Milla really had desired to attend the party.</p> 
               <p>"It's a queer mistake," sighed Mrs. Grizzle; "but every thing goes wrong to-night. Why, we drove over there, as agreed on, and your housekeeper told us they'd changed their minds, and gone with you. I know they wasn't there, for I made her look in the parlor. I thought likely your man had come back with your carriage, and they'd concluded to come in that, and not wait for me.</p> 
                
               <p>Mr. and Mrs. Cameron exchanged a startled glance.</p> 
               <p>"If that is so, then some accident must have happened, for they have not arrived," said he, in a trembling voice.</p> 
               <p>"Oh, do go and see if Martin is here," cried the alarmed mother.</p> 
               <p>"Don't be agitated. If any thing had occurred you would have heard before this. They have been left at home, through mistake, and are scolding roundly by this time."</p> 
               <p>Mrs. Cameron's hands and feet were like ice; but she suffered her hostess to appear to calm her misgivings. Mr. Bulbous went out with her husband to inquire of Martin. He was there, chatting with a small bevy of coachmen; he had not been home since bringing them.</p> 
               <p>"I told you so," said Miss Bulbous, when they reappeared with this report. "They were in the library, reading or playing chess, perhaps, and your servant stupidly overlooked them. <emph>Don't</emph> go before supper! <emph>don't!</emph> It will really spoil half the pleasure of the evening for me."</p> 
               <p>But the mother's heart was filled with a dread foreboding; and yet she could not have spoken it, for she knew not what to fear. Elizabeth was summoned, and the two went up for their wraps.</p> 
               <p>"It is so strange," murmured the mother.</p> 
               <p>"Let me tie your hood for you." Lissa's own hands shook, but she compelled her voice and face to serenity.</p> 
               <p>The drive home was rapid and silent. Just as they turned in at the gate, and saw the lights burning brightly in parlor and library, Mr. Cameron laughed.</p> 
               <p>"Of course, they are at home," he ejaculated. "See how the house is lighted up. We will shake them well for the fright they have given us."</p> 
               <p>Alighting and passing up the steps, they found the hall-door unfastened, and, as they flung wide the parlor-doors, each one of the little party expected to confront Louis and<pb n="246-247" xml:id="VAC8154-00000122"/> Milla, awaiting them there with counter-reproaches for having been left out in that unhandsome way.</p> 
               <p>A silence, a desolation, which struck to the soul of each, awaited them. The two ladies sank into chairs, while the father went on into the library, the dining-room, up to the chambers, and down again.</p> 
               <p>"Where is Sabrina?" asked Mrs. Cameron, as he returned.</p> 
               <p>"I do not know. Neither she nor Milla are in their room."</p> 
               <p>His eye fell on a folded paper, lying on the table, directly under the chandelier. He went forward, and opened it; his wife was by his side in an instant. They read it together:</p>

                           <p>"DEAR FATHER-DARLING MOTHER: I could not leave you without at least writing good-bye. We were married yesterday, at a church in Yonkers, while we were out riding. I am afraid I have done wrong, but Louis urged me, and I have great confidence in his judgment. He said it was cruel and useless to keep us waiting, on the plea that I was not old enough. I was as much of a woman in thought and feeling as many girls of twenty. He wanted to go back to his dear fatherland for a brief visit,-he was home-sick,-and he thought that you would not consent to my going with him. But I love him so much, I could not live if he should go away without me, and perhaps never come back. I have taken Aunt Mildred's legacy, which Louis says is quite right, since it is entirely my own. He has saved up quite a sum of money, he says, during the last year, and he hopes to recover some of his own estates, now the troubles in Europe are over. I have also taken my good nurse Sabrina. Louis was not quite willing, but I was obliged to have an attendant; and I pleaded hard for her. I know you will be glad she is with me; for she will take good care of me. Farewell, dear, dearest parents, and say farewell to Lissa. Louis promises me faithfully that we shall be home again within one year. I leave you my marriage-certificate to take charge of for me. Do not feel anxious about me. Sabrina will be with us, and <emph>I am so happy!</emph> Good-bye, for a few months, my darlings.</p>

               <p>"Oh, my poor little girl, what have you done?" moaned the mother. "You have broken your own heart."</p> 
               <p>"Scoundrel!" said the father, bringing down his heel, as if crushing an enemy under it. "Is this the way Louis repays our friendship? Read the note," he continued, giving it to Elizabeth.</p> 
               <p>"Lissa, you are fainting," cried her mother, a moment later.</p> 
               <p>"Don't mind me," murmured she; but she slipped from the sofa, as she spoke, and it was some time before they could revive her.</p> 
               <p>They believed that a pang, at thus utterly losing her former lover, had something to do with the emotion which had overpowered her. Perhaps it had: surprise and sorrow, fear and deadly pain, were mingled in the first shock; but the sharpest fear, the deadliest pain, they did not conceive of. They had no clue to it; but Lissa, as she read her sister's letter, recalled Robbie's warning; and this it was which sharpened the stroke, until it was unbearable.</p> 
               <p>"Oh, father, fly! pursue them; bring them back! It may not be too late."</p> 
               <p>He was striding up and down the room.</p> 
               <p>"I have thought of that. But how can I go to-night? The last train is in. They probably took the half-past nine express into the city. Where they will go from there I<pb n="248-249" xml:id="VAC8154-00000123"/> cannot guess. No first-class steamer sails to-morrow. I hope he will not take that child on board some tedious sailing-vessel. Yet it's probable that he has done so, in order to elude pursuit."</p> 
               <p>"Go after them, my husband. I will go with you. Milla will return to her mother. If they can only be happy, married, so be it. Let them remain with us, where I can still watch over my frail flower. My poor little Milla! so helpless, so sensitive! What man can take the place of her mother! Oh, Milla, Milla!"</p> 
               <p>"If she suffers, she will have but herself to blame."</p> 
               <p>"Not so. You know we all have been influenced so much by Mr. Dassel. And she was such a child! I don't wonder he could persuade her into this folly. Oh, how glad I am she took Sabrina with her! Sabrina understands all her little ways-"</p> 
               <p>Here the mother broke down into such weeping as the young know not of.</p> 
               <p>Sad it is when the child who has drawn life from her heart, who has bloomed at her breast, makes a mother to weep such tears.</p> 
               <p>Mr. Cameron could not endure it. He ceased his stormy walk, to take her in his arms, and soothe her.</p> 
               <p>"Perhaps it is not so bad. Louis has been indiscreet-rash. I would not have believed him capable of such an absurd and useless step. But, after all, they may be very happy. The voyage may be beneficial to her health. You know our physician has recommended it. If he brings her back, in a few months, rosy and strong, we can forgive him the temporary robbery."</p> 
               <p>Robbery? An unfortunate word! It recalled to the sobbing woman the memory of Mrs. Grizzle's diamonds; she almost shrieked,</p> 
               <p>"<emph>He</emph> took them! I see it all now! Disgrace and misery! He has robbed Mrs. Grizzle of her jewelry to obtain means to carry out his plan!"</p> 
               <p>"Impossible!" But the suspicion struck Mr. Cameron like a blow, staggering the confidence he still felt in the man who had won his friendship.</p> 
               <p>"Ah, father, that will be the construction they will put upon the two events coming together," cried Elizabeth, wringing her hands. "To say the least, the coincidence is unfortunate. Mother, what <emph>can</emph> we do? Such trouble, such disgrace will kill you!"</p> 
               <p>"My poor darling! our own sweet little Milla!" was moaned, in reply. "Do you remember the day, my husband, before she was injured, how perfectly well and beautiful she was that day? Little angel! Why did God choose <emph>her</emph> for such misfortunes? Why, having incurably injured her, did He allow my darling to grow up to such a fate? We have guarded her so tenderly-we have all loved her so! I cannot have it so!" she cried, more wildly, starting up and going to the door, as if about to rush out into the night after her flying child.</p> 
               <p>"Come back, my dear wife. Quiet yourself. I will do all that can be done."</p> 
               <p>"She does not know the world; she does not dream of what it will be outside the circle which has so loved and shielded her. She will expect to meet love on every side."</p> 
               <p>"But Louis, at least, loves her well, or he would not have married her."</p> 
               <p>"God grant it! Yet, it may be, as Lissa has often warned me, that he loves her fortune instead. Reflect, how he has treated Lissa. Oh, my husband! I am afraid we have been strangely blind!-Lissa, run up to her room, and see if Milla took her thick shawl. It is so chilly these November nights,-and she is not accustomed to the night-air!"</p> 
               <pb n="250-251" xml:id="VAC8154-00000124"/> 
               <p>Ah! the mother could not yet resign her motherly cares. Elizabeth obeyed, stumbling, blinded by her tears, up the stairs, to Milla's room, where she fell on her knees, praying for the sister who had once wronged her, but for whom she felt nothing but pity and love,-praying that she might be spared disgrace, neglect, broken health, and a broken heart,-and weeping afresh at sight of the little white bed, soft shelter of innocent girlhood, a glove dropped on the floor, a pair of little slippers scarcely cold from the warmth of those small feet.</p> 
               <p>"She has her shawl,-Louis would see to that. Remember, dear mother, how very thoughtful and attentive he is," she said, when she returned to the parlor. "Between him and Sabrina, surely, she will be well cared for. It is not <emph>that,</emph> so much-" Here she checked herself, glancing at her father.</p> 
               <p>All night they remained up,-no sleep, no rest for that troubled household. The first train which stopped at their little station was at six o'clock in the morning. Elizabeth called up the cook, and had a cup of coffee for her father, who was to take that train in pursuit of the fugitives.</p> 
               <p>"If they are in New York, I will find them. If I should hear of them in any other direction, and go farther, I will telegraph."</p> 
               <p>"I never thought to spend a night like this," murmured Mrs. Cameron, when her husband's haggard face had passed from her sight.</p>

               <p>"'Misfortunes never come single,'" spoke Mrs. Grizzle, the following evening, at her dinner-table. "Here's my diamonds stolen, Sam's got the mitten, and Milla Cameron run away with Mr. Dassel, all in one breath, as one might say. I declare, I've been in such a state of excitement all day, I haven't known which end I stood on, Grizzle. I should think poor Mrs. Cameron would be ravin' distracted."</p> 
               <p>"I brought up a note to her from Cameron. He ain't comin' home to-night. He's got the police to help him, quietly; and they're watching the shippin'. What on earth possessed 'em to run away, when they might just as well got married to home? Nobody opposed 'em, did they?"</p> 
               <p>"I guess not, very seriously. Only that little hump-back thing wasn't fit to be married, and her mother knew it. She's got the purtiest face I ever saw, and she sings like a cherubim, but she hain't no strength; and then, her deformity. I wonder at Dassel's takin' her instead of 'Lizabeth. He's powerful fond of music, though, and she was too, which I s'pose was a bond between 'em. She left word they was going to Germany. It's all the fashion now, to go abroad on your bridal-tour; and if I was the family, I wouldn't say a word about their runnin' off. I'd put the best face on it; for 'what can't be cured must be endured'"-</p> 
               <pb n="252-253" xml:id="VAC8154-00000125"/> 
               <p>"As we said when we furnished that rusty pork to the army. But, really, wife, what you say is good common-sense; and I guess you'd better run over, after supper, and advice 'em to it. They won't think it intrudin', for they will see you mean well."</p> 
               <p>"I wish you wouldn't call your dinner your supper, Grizzle. If you live a thousand years you'll never have no style."</p> 
               <p>"You've got enough for both of us, Malvina."</p> 
               <p>"Goodness knows, I ought to have, for I try hard enough. But about goin' over. I don't feel as if I was called on to trouble myself after the way they've treated Sam."</p> 
               <p>"Oh, I don't lay up hard feelings, mother. You can go right along, as far as I'm concerned. Girls will be girls, Malvina. If Miss 'Lizabeth can't take a shine to our boy, that's no reason why we should quarrel with our neighbors. You go right along, and give 'em all the comfort you can."</p> 
               <p>"Did you give notice about our loss to the police to-day?"</p> 
               <p>"I did; but they don't think you'll ever see your jewelry again. It's so easy to conceal, and, if the stones are taken out of the settings, you couldn't identify 'em no more'n a ham from a heap on my third floor."</p> 
               <p>Susie Grizzle was busy with her almonds, but she looked up, with a curious, sharp glance, when her parents spoke about the missing valuables. She colored, fidgeted, opened her mouth to speak, and shut it again.</p> 
               <p>"Malvina," said the master of the house, lowering his voice and looking about, to see that the waiter was in the pantry, "has it ever come into your head that Mr. Dassel, himself, might have took 'em, to help pay his expenses to Europe?"</p> 
               <p>"Griz-z-zle!"</p> 
               <p>"I've been thinkin' about it, all day."</p> 
                
               <p>"Then you'd better quit thinking about it, unless you want to get yourself took up for a label. You'd be in a pretty fix to get stuck for a label, and get into the Toombs. Oh, dear!"</p> 
               <p>"Libel, my dear."</p> 
               <p>"Well, label or libel, which you choose; I s'pose it's <emph>li</emph>bel, sure enough. Don't say that out loud again, without good reason. It scares me to think of it! As if we'd been nourishing a snake in our very bosoms, Grizzle, instead of a live baron."</p> 
               <p>Grizzle had to smile.</p> 
               <p>Again Susie glanced up, and Sam, dropping his eyes, whistled softly to himself. He was beginning to see into some things.</p> 
               <p>"<emph>I</emph> never nourished him in my bosom, my love."</p> 
               <p>"Oh, Grizzle, how coarse you be! You ought to set a different example before your children. It's quite likely I only referred to it in a metaphoricative sense; and I'm sure you've always made as much of Baron Dassel as I have. You can't say you wa'n't proud to have a baron in the family; no you can't! I took him on the strength of the Camerons. They're not people to be taken in. If Mr. Dassel wasn't a born gentleman, I'll never believe in a human being again."</p> 
               <p>"I only hinted at the possibility, my dear. I don't want you to say nothin' about it. I went to Miss Bayles to-day, to ask her if she recollected distinctly that she and Susie put 'em back and locked the drawer. She says she does remember it. She placed the jewels just where they belonged, as ordered."</p> 
               <p>"Of course, papa, it was just as I told you."</p> 
               <p>"She quite started when I told her about Dassel's eloping with Cameron's daughter; it set her a-thinking of something, I know; and she says she's coming out to-morrow to<pb n="254-255" xml:id="VAC8154-00000126"/> see you about the jewelry. I told her she needn't mind-we didn't blame her; but she seemed to want to come. So you may look for her. But say, if you're going over to t'other house, it's time you went."</p> 
               <p>"I'll take you over, mother," said Sam, perhaps with a vague longing to do something friendly for Miss Cameron, and with a hope of getting a glimpse of her. "I won't go in; but you can ask her if there's any errands she'd like me to do while her father's away."</p> 
               <p>Mother and daughter shivered when the servant brought them word, in their chamber, that their neighbor, Mrs. Grizzle, wished to see them. It was so hard to hide their wounded hearts from the world-harder still to allow inquisitive eyes to scan those wounds.</p> 
               <p>"It might as well be to-night as to-morrow, or next week," spoke Lissa, the first to summon fortitude for the interview. "We cannot always shut ourselves up in this room, mother; and Mrs. Grizzle, if vulgar, is so really kind-hearted."</p> 
               <p>So they went down, and the good lady shook them by the hand, and added a kiss on Lissa's pale cheek.</p> 
               <p>"I ought to get and, and shake you, instead of kiss you," she said, with a tact for which no one would have given her credit, "for giving my Sam the mitten. Naughty girl! I'd made out the list for the biggest kind of infair; and I was goin' to get Jones to make a cake seven feet high, with an image of Hymen on the top; and you've spoiled it all, and I've no daughter-in-law yet."</p> 
               <p>"Oh, hope it is for the best, Mrs. Grizzle. All your son will have to do will be to ask some worthier girl than I. He cannot be long in finding one who will treat him as he deserves."</p> 
               <p>"I'm afraid Sam won't get over it so easy as all that, Miss Lissa. You may not believe it, but I'm afraid he'll have a fit of sickness; he's so cast down. La, I didn't think <emph>you</emph> was a flirt, my dear! But nobody <emph>can</emph> tell what these girls <emph>will</emph> do, Mrs. Cameron; which reminds me to speak of your Milla and our Mr. Dassel. I don't think there was any thing so dreadful in they're runnin' off. Headstrong,-that's all. I allers suspected Dassel had an iron will,-soft and strong,-soft and strong. If I was in <emph>your</emph> place, I wouldn't make a fuss about it. It's too late, now, to prevent the marriage; and this settin' the police after them don't look well. I should be afeard it would get into the papers. Why don't you jest let on that the weddin' was very private on account of your daughter's health, and they've gone abroad on their bridal-tour?"</p> 
               <p>Mrs. Cameron breathed easier. When Mrs. Grizzle sent for her she had but little doubt that she had come to accuse Mr. Dassel of taking her diamonds. To find this not so, but that no such suspicion had entered her mind, was a great relief. The view which Mrs. Grizzle took of the affair was the sensible one. It is true, she did not know of Milla's legacy, nor of the construction the family put upon Mr. Dassel's motive in inducing her to leave her home, taking her fortune with her; therefore, she could not understand the depth of their trouble, their terrible anxiety for the happiness of their darling. To her, as to others, it looked like a love-match, and as such, would be approved more than condemned. After all, <emph>disgrace</emph> is one of the most frightful misfortunes which can befall a family; and if Louis were, indeed, innocent of any indictable wrong, even if selfish and guilty of duplicity, he might be faithful to Milla; and their old repose might, some time, settle back upon them.</p> 
               <p>All this drifted through Mrs. Cameron's mind as she listened. She felt truly grateful to her rude but tender-hearted visitor, and did not refuse to talk about the circumstance of the flight, Mrs. Grizzle even laughing at the<pb n="256-257" xml:id="VAC8154-00000127"/> slyness of Mr. Dassel in making for himself so good an opportunity for eloping. Lissa recalled the meaning look she had noticed interchanged between the lovers when Miss Bulbous first gave the invitation to the <foreign xml:lang="FRA">soire;</foreign> she saw how Milla had made the party an excuse for obtaining her casket of jewels, the absence of which had, no doubt, hitherto been the main obstacle to the final consummation of their wishes. It seemed incredible that her sister, whose soul had been of such translucent innocence, could act with duplicity. It proved the power of another's influence.</p> 
               <p>Mrs. Grizzle, perhaps better than one who had more delicacy in approaching the subject, proved herself quite a comforter. Mrs. Cameron determined to take her advice, and say nothing of the marriage having been a secret one; though it would be difficult to prevent rumors, as Miss Bulbous, at least, must be suspicious of the true state of the case. As to their other harrowing fears, those must be borne in silence.</p> 
               <p>The next day Mr. Cameron returned home, worn and weary, without any tidings whatever of the fugitives. It seemed strange that a party, so likely to attract attention, could not be traced. Dassel, always of very marked and distinguished personal appearance; his wife, with her long, fair curls and slight deformity; and Sabrina, her tall and dignified colored attendant, make up a group not to be over-looked. Yet, the only trace obtained of them was, that they took the half-past nine express into the city, and entered a carriage at the Thirty-second Street station.</p> 
               <p>His wife was more cheerful than he had hoped to find her. "She has gone," she said, "and we must be as happy as we can without her. I will pray to my heavenly Father night and day, for her welfare. Perhaps He will be more merciful to her than she has been to herself. We must not shut out the sunshine from our home, because our poor lily has gone from it."</p> 
                
               <p>He kissed his wife with an ineffable relief at finding her thus brave.</p> 
               <p>Yet, how much easier it proved to make a resolution than to keep it! As the days rolled on, every nook and corner of her home was so haunted by that sweet presence which had vanished, that a ghost seemed ever at the mother's side. Suspense, that worst of corroding mental poisons, ate into her hope and patience, until, at times, she cried out, in the solitude of her chamber, "If she were dead, I should be less unhappy!"</p> 
               <p>Yet she hardly expected a letter until time should elapse sufficient to permit a missive to return from across the ocean. All the family had made up their minds that Mr. and Mrs. Dassel had fled to Europe. Still, the mail was never brought in that Mr. Cameron did not involuntarily start, eagerly grasp the package, and run his eyes over it, looking for a letter from them.</p> 
               <p>He caused the marriage to be published in the papers, answering the surprised inquiries of friends with an assumed gayety.</p> 
               <p>It was Elizabeth, more than any one, who bore the weight of a terrible and treble anxiety. She expected a letter from Robbie, which she longed and yet dreaded to receive. If the news in that letter should be good, then the shadow would clear away from heart and conscience; if not happy, she could at least be thankful and at peace. If the news should be what she feared, what grief and shame would not descend upon her head! grief and shame which she had resolved to bear alone, until some unhappy chance should make all known to her parents and to the world.</p> 
               <p>-Meanwhile, what of Abel Bellows, whom such an ill wind had blown into the Tombs? The poor artist was thinking of him when she fell into such a reverie, after<pb n="258-259" xml:id="VAC8154-00000128"/> Grizzle's communication of Mr. Dassel's disappearance. The two men were, somehow, so associated in her mind, that one could not be mentioned without summoning the image of the other, which was owing to the keen interest she took in Abel's affairs, and the fact that Mr. Dassel had been his accuser.</p> 
               <p>"So, that is the gate of escape which he has left open," she murmured to herself, after Grizzle had left her. "I must stop, on my way home, and inform Abel of the good news. His deliverance is nearer at hand than he thinks."</p> 
               <p>And as she paused, at sunset, in the dreary shadow of the Tombs, she knew that she would have occasion for but few more visits. Her message left the prisoner playing with a sunbeam which stole through the bars; and when she reached the tenement-house and went up the stairs with her light, quick step, she brought the sunbeam of a most joyful smile into the wo-begone presence of Mrs. Bellows. She boarded, now, with that lugubrious woman, preferring this to taking her meals out or to cooking them for herself. It was pleasant to reflect that her board-bill was the means of filling all the hungry child-mouths with good, wholesome food, of keeping the coal crackling and the kettle singing. She had stoutly proved her friendship in these trying days. That dreadful note of a hundred dollars she had paid off, leaving the furniture of the little household free; she had squared the rent-account also; no danger of the children being turned out in the cold; their bed was their own, and their roof was paid for, for the present; likewise the feelings and pride of the mother were saved, in that her marriage-portion was not taken from her. It would not have been possible for Miss Bayles to have done all this, had not her good fairy brought her that bewildering piece of good fortune, the portraits of the Grizzle family. When she had first counted the crisp, handsome greenbacks, to the amount of two hundred and fifty dollars, she had seen them transformed in her mind's eye, into a black silk dress for Sunday, a set of furs to keep out the winter-wind on her early morning and late twilight journeys; with a reserve still left for wet-weather days. But another call had been made for her precious treasure, and she had not been deaf to that call. A merino had taken the place of the silk, and the furs were dispensed with altogether; but there was so much warmth in the young artist's heart that she scarcely seemed to miss them.</p> 
               <p>Now, as she came into the warm room, which held an appetizing odor of roasted potatoes and broiled steak, her dark eyes laughed and her cheeks had bright red roses in them. Miss Bayles was growing actually pretty. She had been too pale and too sad; but her expression had changed; she had come back to what she had a right to be-a handsome and lively young woman.</p> 
               <p>"I thought you'd lighted the other lamp," said Mrs. Bellows, looking about her; "but I guess it's only your eyes, after all. I don't see how you can come home in such spirits, after a hard day's work. I should think you'd be tuckered out."</p> 
               <p>"Not I! I'm tired,-I don't deny that. But, somehow, the world is bright, and I can't help feeling happy. How have you flourished to-day, Mrs. Bellows?"</p> 
               <p>"Oh, don't ask me. I s'pose I might have had some peace of mind and body to-day, knowin' them debts was paid, for which I'm sure I shall be grateful to my dyin' day,-with a good fire, and something to eat. But that tooth's been troublin' me ag'in. And some of the boys hooted at Matthew on the street,-and I've been kind of down-hearted, to tell the truth. There ain't much but trouble in this world, Miss Bayles."</p> 
               <p>"Your temperament is not so sanguine as mine," responded<pb n="260-261" xml:id="VAC8154-00000129"/> ponded the young lady, "and for that you are not to blame. Toddle, you little sinner, come here, and see what I have for you!"</p> 
               <p>The next moment Toddle was in her lap, eating an apple, while she "trotted him to Boston," to the tune of <q>
                     <lg type="quotation"> 
                        <l>"There's a better time coming, boys,</l> 
                        <l rend="ti-1">Wait a little longer!"</l> 
                     </lg>
                  </q> In fact, Miss Bayles fairly bubbled over with good spirits, despite the fact that work was limited, and she had been given the morrow for a holiday. She needed the day very much, as she had two important visits to make, one of which, as we know, was to Rose Villa, which would take considerable time.</p> 
               <p>How true it is that when one end of the balance goes up the other must go down! Here was this tender-hearted woman about to bring great distress and misery upon one innocent family; but that family was unknown to her, and scarcely entered into her thoughts, while she knew, to a certainty, that she was about to relieve another innocent family of great distress and misery.</p> 
               <p>As soon as breakfast was over the next morning, Miss Bayles set out on her expedition to Rose Villa, arriving there at about ten o'clock.</p> 
               <p>"Oh, is it you?" said Sam, who had heard her ring and peeped out of his mother's sitting-room, to see who it was. "Why, how you have fleshed-up this fall! You look more as you used to, down on Greenwich-street."</p> 
               <p>The young artist blushed, which still more improved her looks. She did not tell Sam that he had improved equally in <emph>losing</emph> flesh and color; but she thought it, and as she followed him down the hall, she watched his not unhandsome figure, with an interest of which he did not dream.</p> 
               <p>"Here's Miss Bayles, ma, bright as a pink."</p> 
                
               <p>"I declare, you do look good this frosty mornin'. Take off your bunnit and cloak, and set down on this sofy, 'side of me. You know Sam's got the mitten again; <emph>you</emph> give it to him, a good while ago, and now Miss Cameron's give it again,-so he's one for each hand, now. I don't see what I'm to do for a daughter-in-law. Most women that don't want 'em has more than suits their taste."</p> 
               <p>The girl cast a look about the room, warmed to a summer-warmth; bright with velvet carpets, pictures, large windows; luxurious with easy-chairs, and flossy mats, into which her slender feet might sink until hidden; cast a look into the dimpled, motherly face beside her; and a shy, swift look at the young man standing in the arch of the bay-window. It all looked pleasant in contrast with the tenement-house. She was weary with the battle which a solitary woman ever must fight, who is poor, and must provide for her own wants, against the frowns, the jeers, the competition of strong men. She had that affection for Mrs. Grizzle which springs from long association; she was blest with memories of her dear father, and those days of happiness when he was alive; her deficiencies of education and refinement appeared to the artist more like faults and less like crimes than ever before. The young girl had cast away all this comfort and friendship for a path of thorns and a <emph>loveless life.</emph> Perhaps she had been too particular? However that might be, it was too late to rescind her resolutions. Sam Grizzle looked higher now; and she sighed.</p> 
               <p>"What's that for, my dear? You looked so happy when you come in, I didn't believe you could get up a sigh. I should say it weighed about four pound, by the way you riz it."</p> 
               <p>Mrs. Grizzle was good at guessing weights, for she had handled the scales and measures a great deal, in days gone by.</p> 
               <pb n="262-263" xml:id="VAC8154-00000130"/> 
               <p>"It was walking up the hill from the station, I think; it makes me draw a long breath.-But about your jewels, Mrs. Grizzle. I could not rest until I came to see if I was exonerated from any carelessness."</p> 
               <p>"La, child, I sent you word, yisterday, I didn't blame you."</p> 
               <p>"Have you any suspicion <emph>where</emph> they have gone to?"</p> 
               <p>"Not the least idea. Burglars, I s'pose."</p> 
               <p>"Was the drawer locked?"</p> 
               <p>"Yes; and whoever took 'em unlocked it, and locked it up again, with a key of their own. There's one comfort, Miss Bayles-you've got 'em all right in the portrait, for I don't expect Grizzle will buy me any more right away. He thinks it too much money to run so much risk a-keepin."</p> 
               <p>"Mr. Dassel has gone off, without notice?"</p> 
               <p>"Yes, he and Milla Cameron made a runaway love-match of it."</p> 
               <p>"Poor child!" said Miss Bayles, softly. "It was the deformed one?"</p> 
               <p>"Yes; and a sweet, pretty creature she was."</p> 
               <p>"She was, indeed! I have seen her several times, you remember, at this house. I never saw another face of such peculiar, soft, child-like beauty. It's a terrible pity that she has intrusted her fate to Mr. Dassel. To tell you the truth, I have no confidence in him. I certainly believe that he has your diamonds."</p> 
               <p>"Bless you! what makes you think so?"</p> 
               <p>"I have watched him closely ever since I first met him. He came a great deal to the house where I live, to see a poor family. The man was porter in a store for which he corresponded. I wondered why he paid this humble family so much attention. I, too, was included in his constant civilities. Do you know there was a robbery and murder committed in that store, some time last summer, early?"</p> 
               <p>"I do recollect his speakin' of it."</p> 
                
               <p>"After Mr. Dassel had visited our house some time, I discovered his object. He betrayed it to me, very cautiously, but still I understood him. The porter had a sleeve-button which Mr. Dassel had lost. If I would recover that button privately-which he thought I could do, for Abel Bellows had a great friendship for me-he would give me a thousand dollars for it. This was not until <emph>after</emph> he despaired of getting hold of it unaided. He was many weeks arriving at the open proposition. Meantime, I had been subjected to delicate flatteries, exquisite sympathy, brotherly kindness, which would have turned any head but one so suspicious as mine. But, somehow, I never trusted Mr. Dassel. Once before in my life I had met a pair of blue eyes like his-clear, blue as the sky, limpid, with an occasional wonder in them, like the surprise of a child; and their owner was the coldest, most subtile creature you could imagine. So I studied Mr. Dassel. Some time ago <emph>I made up my mind that he had committed the robbery in the store of his employers,</emph> and that some <emph>proof</emph> of the fact was in Abel Bellows' possession. When he finally disclosed his desire for the button, then I knew that my suspicions were correct. While debating what steps to take in the matter, I was astonished to find that, last week, he had caused the arrest of the porter, on the charge that <emph>he</emph> was the guilty party! I assure you, I have not been easy in my shoes since then, Mrs. Grizzle. I have been afraid to move about much, to be alone, almost to eat or drink, for Mr. Dassel must have known that I suspected him, and would come forward on the witness-stand, and testify to his proposition about the button. It was to be expected that he would wish to get me out of the way. I was afraid that I should make one more of those 'mysterious disappearances' which are so frequent. That such might not be my fate, you may guess that I played a careful part when I met Mr. Dassel<pb n="264-265" xml:id="VAC8154-00000131"/> here Saturday. We both made ourselves very agreeable. Those blue eyes had a terrible sort of fascination to me. I have no doubt I should have met my fate before this, had he not had a plan for fleeing the country, which prevented his troubling himself about me."</p> 
               <p>"Oh, goodness gracious! how you do go on, Miss Bayles! You make me crawl all over."</p> 
               <p>"Not any more than I do," said the artist, with a little shiver. "I felt immensely relieved when I heard he had run away. I understand, now, the whole performance. He threw Abel Bellows into prison, not with the expectation of convicting him, but to prevent the porter from betraying him, while he perfected his plans for flight. If he could have obtained possession of the button before he betrayed himself to Bellows and to me, he would have remained here and snapped his fingers at any accusations Bellows might have made; but the case against him, supported by my testimony, would have been too strong. I think he liked his quarters here quite well enough to have remained, so long as he was free from danger."</p> 
               <p>"Yes," interposed Sam, "he <emph>had</emph> good pickings." The pupil was thinking of their daily games of billiards, and the laughing grace with which his tutor took the five or ten dollars which the young man was sure to lose before the sport ceased for the day. Nothing ever had been said of this trifling dissipation to the parents, and he had been put "to his wit's end," often, for the money.</p> 
               <p>Susie Grizzle, hearing Miss Bayles' voice, had slipped away from her governess, and was standing in the room, unobserved, during the relation of the young lady. She now came forward, trembling a little, and looking frightened.</p> 
               <p>"Mamma, I saw Mr. Dassel come out of your room, Sunday, when you and pa and Sam were at church. I was in the hall. He looked vexed when he saw me, and said he thought I was with you; and he said, he wondered where the <title>Sunday Times</title> was-he'd been looking in your room for it."</p> 
               <p>"Why didn't you tell this to me before, Susan?"</p> 
               <p>"Oh, mamma, somehow I didn't dare to. The moment I heard your necklace was gone, I thought of Mr. Dassel, and that frightened me so."</p> 
               <p>"Little fool! But it wouldn't make any difference. He was out of the way by that time. This is what comes of takin' a foreigner into your family. Dear me! to think of them Camerons! I would give my diamonds twice over, if that child was back under her father's roof."</p> 
               <p>"I can't conceive what he married her for, sweet as she is," mused Miss Bayles. "But I must hasten back to the city, to lay all these facts before Borden &amp; DeWitt without delay. I hope to see Abel Bellows taking tea with his wife and children to-night."</p> 
               <p>"Oh, my dear, <emph>don't</emph> say a word about it! It would kill Mrs. Cameron and 'Lizabeth! They'd never get over it."</p> 
               <p>"But there is an innocent man in prison. His family suffers for want of his care. Even should I permit affairs to take their course, there would be but a brief delay. Borden &amp; DeWitt will hear of Mr. Dassel's departure, and every thing will come out."</p> 
               <p>"Then the Lord have mercy on that family-that's all I've got to say! I'm afraid it'll be the death of 'em."</p> 
               <p>"I pity them,-I do, indeed. Perhaps the worst can be concealed from them. This matter need not, necessarily, get into the papers. I will ask them to withhold it. Doubtless they will place detectives in the field, as they ought to do; but it can be kept quiet. Of course, if he should be discovered and arrested, the family would then know all. If he should escape, they may never learn that<pb n="266-267" xml:id="VAC8154-00000132"/> which must complete their unhappiness. I must go. No, I cannot stay to lunch. I want to reach the store in time to have his accusers bring up Abel Bellows for dismissal this very afternoon."</p> 
               <p>Sam walked with Miss Bayles down to the station, and saw her on the train. He came back with a slow step and heavy heart.</p> 
               <p>"Perhaps if Miss Lissa knew what trouble was before her, she'd be glad of me for a friend and protector, after all," he said to his mother, as he flung himself down on a chair in her room.</p> 
               <p>That was well said of Sam; it proved some manliness in his nature-for what is the true, "manly" character, if not to protect, defend, and comfort the woman which it chooses?</p> 
               <p>"Poor girl, I shouldn't wonder," replied his mother, dropping a tear on the gorgeous afghan she was knitting; "and if she's so disposed, I shan't offer objections, if they <emph>have</emph> got a burglar in the family. The Camerons are too nice people to be put down; and I, for one, shall stand up for 'em."</p> 
               <p>"And I, for two," added Sam.</p> 
               <p>-Swiftly the lessening autumn day glided away,-too swiftly for Miss Bayles, who had many steps to take, in order to carry out her plans. But she worked faithfully, and came out in triumph from her day of busy toil. The sun was setting in a bank of crimson clouds, as she entered the tenement-house with a basket on her arm and sundry packages in her hands; and, proceeding directly to Mrs. Bellows' room, laid down her burdens, and addressed its mistress thus:</p> 
               <p>I've taken the liberty of inviting a friend to tea, Mrs. Bellows, and I want you and the children to look your best. I'll curl Toddle's hair and put on his white apron, if you'll brush up the room and put on your alpaca dress. We must have the table look nice, too. So here's a bouquet of flowers for it, and a can of peaches, a cake, some cheese, rusk, smoked beef, every thing nice!"</p> 
               <p>"For the land-sake, a boddy would think you was going to be married, and was settin' out your weddin' supper! That cake's actually frosted. Who's comin'? Mr. Dassel?"</p> 
               <p>"Not he! A gentleman friend of mine, though. You make haste and dress, please, for I expect him in half an hour."</p> 
               <p>The young girl laughingly "shewed" away the children, who had gathered about the dainties like a flock of chickens at the sight of corn, while their mother went to the bureau to put up her hair, murmuring, "It's an awful piece of extravagance for me to put on that alpaca, when it's likely I'll never have another. I hope you'll enjoy yourself, Miss Bayles; and I'm sure I'm willin' you should have company when it don't cost me a cent, and nothing but the trouble. But you mustn't think a woman with her husband in the Tombs is goin' to be very gay; besides, I was always bashful before strangers."</p> 
               <p>"You won't be afraid of this gentleman, I'm quite sure," said the artist, all smiles. "He's as jolly and humorous a person as I know. I rather think you will like him. I've curled the baby, and now, with your permission, I'll set the table. Is there plenty of tea? Matthew, run, get a pint of milk, and come back instantly. How pretty the flowers look in the centre of the table! We must light both burners. There! how do you like it!"</p> 
               <p>"It's all well enough for them that can afford it," sighed Mrs. Bellows.</p> 
               <p>Presently Matthew returned with the milk. Two or three times Miss Bayles had approached the window during her preparations, and stolen a glance across the way.</p> 
               <pb n="268-269" xml:id="VAC8154-00000133"/> 
               <p>"Is all ready now?" she asked.</p> 
               <p>"As fur as I know; and I hope your company'll soon be here, for if there's any thing I dislike, it's tea that's steeped till the flavor's all gone."</p> 
               <p>Again Miss Bayles approached the window, and drawing up the blind, she let it down in an innocent manner, noways like a signal. About two minutes thereafter there was a knock at the door. Mrs. Bellows made signs to the two oldest to fold their hands and hold up their heads, and then put on her own company-look. The artist stepped gayly to the door and flung it wide open.</p> 
               <p>The burners shone down on a happy-looking man, whose whole face twinkled, as he stood there in silence. The hands flew apart, the heads came down, the company-look disappeared.</p> 
               <p>"A-bel Bel-lows!"</p> 
               <p>"The same old Bellows," said he; "don't you know it by the nose?" He stepped into the room and held his arms open. The children flew into them. The wife hung back a moment; the next she, too, was clinging to him, while tears of joy ran down her face. His first kiss was for her, then Matthew and Abby; then little Toddle was raised aloft in the stout arms.</p> 
               <p>"God bless him! father's wanted to see him so!" and then Abel broke down, and cried a little himself, at which every body, young lady included, followed the fashion.</p> 
               <p>"This'll never do, will it, my boy? Oh, Lordy, how glad I am to get home again! How beautiful it seems to me!-good as a palace!" and the porter looked about the cheerful room, and laughed, until every body followed the fashion, and laughed too.</p> 
               <p>"Yes, Mrs. Bellows laughed like a girl; the natural timidity and melancholy of her character only found voice once during the whole evening, and that was just as they were about sitting down to table, when she drew back and asked.</p> 
               <p>"Abel, you hain't broke jail, have you?"</p> 
               <p>"No, Abby; I've been honorably acquitted, and got my old place back with an advance of wages, and a present of a hundred dollars from my employers, which I propose to pay back to Miss Bayles this very night. And I'm goin' to let lottery-tickets alone, and support you and the babies, and be happy as a king."</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XVIII.</head> 
               <head type="sub">THE BARON'S ANTECEDENTS.</head> 
               <p>IT was hardly to be expected that a knowledge of the suspicious circumstances attending Mr. Dassel's flight should continue to be withheld from the family whose peace he had destroyed. Mr. Cameron heard of them within a few days, and at once had an interview with the members of the firm. He was as convinced as they of Dassel's guilt. They told him they had employed detectives-had even sent one abroad, for they felt that the career of so subtle and dangerous a villain ought to be arrested. Mr. Cameron could not but agree with them, and hoped that they might be successful. All his prayer now was, to get his darling away from that man, to take her back home-for he no longer had confidence in her husband's kindness to the poor child. That she would be abandoned as soon as he grew weary of her, was the father's agonized belief. Her fortune, in the shape it was in, was completely in his power, and he would have no motive for remaining true to her.</p> 
               <p>The wretched truth was known also to Elizabeth, for the burden was too great for her father to bear alone; but Mrs. Cameron was spared, for the present, any knowledge of Dassel's rascality. Bitterly did Mr. Cameron reproach himself with having introduced an adventurer into his domestic circle-given him friendship, and, what was more, the friendship of his wife and daughters. Surely, he needed not to reproach himself for the exile had appealed to his love of liberty and his love of humanity-had approached him as one who suffered for republican principles-and won his esteem as a gentleman of the finest manners and the rarest accomplishments. Louis Dassel, if an adventurer, was not of the common stamp. All that birth or education could do for a man had been done for him. He had talents, which, put to a better use, would have given him a distinguished position in any country. His smile, his manner, won all hearts.</p> 
               <p>It was impossible for Mr. Cameron to convince himself of this man's wickedness; and, alas! it was equally impossible for him to disbelieve it. To Elizabeth the father confided his changing moods; she bore the weight of his cares, and a still heavier care of her own. The energy of her character asserted itself. She became the comforter of her mother, relieving her of household cares, affecting a cheerfulness she did not feel, and was to her father a solace greater than he could express. Suddenly she had become the stay of home.</p> 
               <p>How many, in the last few years, when the shadow of war hung over us, have waited for footsteps which never came? have watched the inexorable mails for the well-known handwriting, which was never again to gladden their eyes! Thus the little family started when a foot sounded on the walk, turning pale if the door-bell rung suddenly, waiting for the letters, which were so plentiful, but never one from <emph>her!</emph>
               </p> 
               <p>About the middle of December there arrived a second letter from Robbie.</p> 
               <p>"Robbie is partial to you," said her father, playfully, as he handed a sealed missive to Lissa, which had come in the envelop containing his own. "He has always something private for your ear."</p> 
               <p>She made some reply, she could not have told what, and<pb n="272-273" xml:id="VAC8154-00000135"/> a cold sweat broke out on her forehead as she took the package and thrust it in her pocket. They were at the dinner-table, and she had no intention of reading that communication in the presence of others. Her mother was deep in the affectionate pages which Robbie had penned for her, her pale face lighted by a brighter smile than it had worn for days.</p> 
               <p>"Am I to go without my coffee?" asked Mr. Cameron. He, too, had been cheered by hearing good tidings of his boy, and was less constrained and absent-minded than usual.</p> 
               <p>"Let me help you, dear father. It gives me such pleasure to see mamma enjoying her letter."</p> 
               <p>The coffee-urn was placed before Lissa; she measured the white crystal lumps and the golden cream in those exact quantities which he approved; and when she had given him his cup, chattered about a dozen pleasant trifles.</p> 
               <p>"But why don't you read Robbie's letter, Lissa? Poor boy! he will not write so gayly another time, when he hears what Milla has done. He loved her so tenderly. I never saw a brother so thoughtful and considerate. Alas, we have none of us any thing to do, now that we no longer have our pet to wait upon!"</p> 
               <p>Thus every little gleam of sunshine would always glide into the cloud of that overshadowing trouble.</p> 
               <p>"I have more respect for Robbie's prejudices, now that his dislike for a certain person proves to have been so well grounded," continued Mr. Cameron, in a lowered tone, to his daughter.</p> 
               <p>"He had sharp eyes, for a boy, certainly," she said.</p> 
               <p>"Have you a letter, too?" asked the mother, when she had fondly scanned, the second and third time, every word her boy had written.</p> 
               <p>"Yes, mother; but I have not broken the seal yet. It is about some little affairs of our own, I know."</p> 
                
               <p>By some strange magnetism warned of its contents, not when any human eye was upon her would Elizabeth read that communication. After they had returned to the library, and her mother was busy with the pages of a new magazine, she slipped up to her own room, turned the key, lighted the gas, drew forth the envelop, and broke the seal, to read:</p>

                           <p>"DEAR LISSA: My suspicions were correct. Louis Dassel and Count Konigsberg are one and the same person. Before beginning my studies, I carried out the plan which I spoke of to you. I took two weeks to investigating a matter which so nearly concerns our own happiness and honor. I went to Baden Baden. Of course, I was very discreet. No one knew that I had any object in asking questions, except to gratify a <choice>
                                 <sic>nstural</sic>
                                 <corr>natural</corr>
                              </choice> curiosity to hear about a person of whom every one likes to speak, and of whom a thousand stories, both dreadful and amusing, are told. There is a portrait of him to be seen in the house of a person of rank in that city. I contrived to see that portrait, as well as numerous <foreign xml:lang="FRA">cartes-de-visite,</foreign> which the photographers have preserved, and of which they are very choice. Those <foreign xml:lang="FRA">cartes</foreign> command an enormous price. They are, both portrait and photographs, the 'form and image' of Louis Dassel. Yet, they are the likeness of Karl Konigsberg, a real count, of excellent family and high position, who ran through with his fortune at the gaming-table, married a beautiful heiress of a rich merchant, attempted to murder his wife, was arrested, escaped, fled the country, and is now, no one knows where, nor whether dead or alive, except you and I.</p> 
                           <p>"Lissa, my dear sister, that woman whom he attempted to murder, and who is his lawful wife, is still alive. She lives, in great retirement, at one of her father's country-seats<pb n="274-275" xml:id="VAC8154-00000136"/> seats. She is said to be in a decline, her heart having been broken by the treatment of her husband. Lissa, I am absolutely choked with rage when I think of it. If I were in America, I am afraid I should shoot that man. As it is, I feel it my duty to denounce him to the authorities. But before taking this step, I think I will wait to hear again from you. Think of it, if it had not been that his attention was diverted to sweet, dear little Milla's humble legacy, you would, before this, have been married to him-you, a Cameron, and my sister, would have gone to the altar with this murderer and bigamist! Never mind my writing, for my hand trembles, I am so angry. I only hope and pray that poor Milla's affections can be untwined from him, without fatal injury to her delicate frame and sensitive heart. I trust father will thrash him within an inch of his life.</p> 
                           <p>"Still, you ought not to give the alarm, so as to allow him to escape. It is our duty to check his career, and you must be prudent until you hear again from me.</p> 
                           <p>"Lissa, I cannot tell what possessed me that night on the porch. Was it the spirit of prophecy? Was it a touch of clairvoyance? I do not wish to attribute it to remarkable sagacity on my part. But the moon shone full against Louis Dassel when he was telling that horrible story of Count Konigsberg. It seemed to illuminate him through and through,-to render him transparent; and I saw and felt and was convinced that the teller of the tale was the chief actor in it. I was fascinated by a certain expression in his eyes,-you could not see him from where you sat. He saw how I was looking into him, and attempted to turn away: but, as I said then, like the Ancient Mariner, he was obliged to go on with his frightful confessions. I could hardly restrain myself from then and there accusing him. I almost shouted it after him, as he ran to catch the train.</p> 
                           <p>"I was never happy after that. Every thing was poisoned by my suspicions. I felt that I must tell you. You remember, I approached you once, and you were offended, and repulsed me. It was a dreadful thing to put into words. And I had no proofs of what I said.</p> 
                           <p>"It was not until after Dassel began to show the cloven foot, by reaching it out after Milla's jewels, that I brought my long-planned resolve into action. I saw no way to prove my own convictions, and to force them upon others, except to come to this country, and gather up the facts. My pride in the name of Cameron, my love for my sisters, would not permit me to rest until I had satisfied myself. I displayed some energy, did I not, in getting here?"</p> 
                           <p>"But, Lissa, that man suspected me,-at least, he feared that, if I came to this country, I might stumble on the truth. He came very near having another murder on his soul. He tripped my foot on the gangway, in hopes of sending me to Davy Jones' locker, <emph>by accident,</emph> and thus keeping me out of his native land, in whose behalf he is such a martyr! Did you suspect it, at the time? I thought, by your face, that perhaps you did. I only hope he has taken the alarm, and deserted our pleasant neighborhood, before my accusations arrive. Not that I wish him to escape justice; but I do wish him to let my little sister alone. Sweetest, dearest Milla, give her a thousand kisses from Robbie. How willful the little witch can be upon occasion! But do you know, dear Lissa, I love her the better for it. You had better take father into our confidence. Perhaps he will have Count Konigsberg arrested at once.</p> 
                           <p>"They tell the most extravagant stories of his beauty, his talents, his recklessness at the gaming-table, his taste in dress, his skill as a horseman, what a favorite he was with the ladies, etc. He is a sort of hero, despite his crime-into which, they say, he was led by despair at impending poverty. But it looks to me like cool, deliberate deviltry. However, I am sick of him, heartily, and will say no more.</p> 
                           <pb n="276-277" xml:id="VAC8154-00000137"/> 
                           <p>"Having finished up this unpleasant business, I intend, now, to apply myself to my studies with all my brains, and to remain here, father willing, the appointed time.</p>

               <p>The letter slid from Lissa's nerveless hands on to the carpet.</p> 
               <p>"Poor Milla! poor Milla!" she sighed.</p> 
               <p>And presently the weary, worn-out girl, who had bravely borne so much, slipped after the letter to the floor. She lay there some time, not unconscious, but stupefied and listless, wishing she never might have to arise and confront this new sorrow.</p> 
               <p>What was there left to pray for now? Only that Milla might die and never learn of her own false relation to the man she loved.</p> 
               <p>Mr. Cameron was disturbed by Elizabeth's long absence, connecting it with something in Robbie's letter. Misfortune had made him nervous and apprehensive. She was aroused from her half-swoon by his knock at her door, and voice asking for admission; and, rising, she admitted him.</p> 
               <p>"What is it?" he asked, reading ill-news in her face.</p> 
               <p>For answer she gave him the letter.</p> 
               <p>She was frightened at the white-heat of anger which glowed through his face.</p> 
               <p>"I shall set out at once. I shall not rest until I find him, and get my child. When we meet, let him look out for himself! I will sell house and home to get the means for pursuing the search."</p> 
               <p>"But think of dear mother, father. We can keep this from her; we <emph>must</emph> keep it from her."</p> 
               <p>"It is of no use to talk," he said; "to-morrow I shall see what can be done. Yes, keep the main fact from her mother er, if you can; but to-morrow I shall prepare myself to set out in search of my child."</p> 
               <p>The next day Mr. Cameron consulted again, as he had done several times before, with the firm of Borden &amp; DeWitt, chiefly to learn if they had received any information of the fugitive.</p> 
               <p>"Nothing positive," said Mr. Borden; "but we have some reason to suppose that he has never left the country. No doubt he led your daughter to suppose they were going abroad, and allowed her to say so in her note, in order to mislead pursuit. In fact, we are almost certain that he is now hiding in St. Louis. An officer went on from here yesterday. It is now our theory that the journey he made last summer, to St. Louis, in the capacity of a detective, was really taken by him in order to convey away the goods stolen from our store. Doubtless his trunk contained the silks and laces after which he and the policeman who accompanied him were looking so sharply. Quite a joke on us, wasn't it?-doubly at our expense! He has probably gone to that city now, thinking to safely dispose of them after this length of time. Your daughter's jewels, say $40,000, Mrs. Grizzle's, $12,000, and what he obtained from us, would keep the gentleman in ready money for some time! We think he remained secreted in our store, the night the robbery was committed, allowing himself to be locked in, that he filled a carpet-bag or two with the goods, and placed the remainder in his desk, which he always kept under lock and key, and with which we did not think of meddling, afterward actually walking out in broad daylight with them, as if they were bundles of soiled linen. We do not think he had any accomplice, nor do we think he intended to kill the watchman, as he was not armed. He expected the fellow would drop into a sound sleep, during which he would effect the robbery, and then leave by the man-hole. But he<pb n="278-279" xml:id="VAC8154-00000138"/> was probably suddenly confronted by the unlucky watch, who, knowing him by sight, would of course betray him to his employers. To escape this, he murdered the man."</p> 
               <p>"Every body is disposed to put the best construction on his crimes," muttered Mr. Cameron, as he walked away from the store. "They cannot shake off the glamor of his personal attractions."</p> 
               <p>That same night found him on the express-train which left New York for the West. He had kissed his weeping wife farewell with the words:</p> 
               <p>"Cheer up, my dear, we ought to feel happier now that we think we have positive trace of our darling. I hope not to be away over a fortnight. I hope to be home, and my little girl with me before then. Lissa, you must have the house bright for us when we come back."</p> 
               <p>How desolate they felt when he had gone! Yet there was the future to look to. In a few days he might be back with that dear child, whose <q>
                     <lg type="quotation"> 
                        <l>"Foot seemed even at the threshold</l> 
                        <l>Yet never passes o'er."</l> 
                     </lg>
                  </q>
               </p> 
               <p>Louis and Milla! Mrs. Cameron expected <emph>both</emph>-talked of both. Each mention of their names in conjunction was like a wound to Lissa's consciousness. She could not endure it. Besides, her mother must soon know that such a thing was not to be, as their returning together; and it would be best to prepare her for the fact. So one day Lissa said to her, very gently:</p> 
               <p>"Mother, if Milla comes home, Mr. Dassel will not be with her. He has done things which make him an outcast. Father will have no communication with him."</p> 
               <p>"Then I am afraid Milla will refuse to come."</p> 
               <p>"I think she will come. At least we will prepare for her."</p> 
                
               <p>The days were brief and bitter cold, the evenings long and lonely. Mrs. Grizzle would persist, in her good-natured way, in being a "comfort" to her neighbors. Unwelcome as her intrusions sometimes were, they were wholesome, and the dreary little household would have fared ill without them.</p> 
               <p>Sam, too, happened upon one more opportunity to urge his suit, and again opened his mouth and spake.</p> 
               <p>"Why couldn't you a'said No, out and out, the first time?" he asked, reproachfully, when Elizabeth put a stop to his eloquence. "I had no idea you'd trifle with a fellow, Miss Cameron,-I hadn't indeed. "I built high on your takin' several days for an answer."</p> 
               <p>"There's where I did wrong, Mr. Grizzle," she said; "and I am glad to have an opportunity to acknowledge it. The truth is, that I came very near accepting you. I did place a camelia in my hair, the evening of Miss Bulbous' party, <emph>but it dropped out. I am glad it did.</emph> That chance has saved us both much unhappiness. For I did not wear it because I had made up my mind I could love you, but because I was not contented at home, and wished to go away. <emph>Then,</emph> my parents did not seem to need me, as I expected that Milla and Mr. Dassel would always live with them; <emph>now,</emph> you see how dependent they are upon me. I am resolved never to marry, and never to leave them. This is my final determination; and I shall be annoyed if you refer to the subject again.</p> 
               <p>"It's hard on a fellow-" began Sam.</p> 
               <p>"May I give you a piece of advice?" interrupted Lissa.</p> 
               <p>"Why, yes. Advice is said to be cheap."</p> 
               <p>"It is to offer what you have offered me-your heart, hand, and fortune,-to another young lady that I know of, and who is sweet, beautiful and talented,-who would prize your heart, be proud of your hand, and find your fortune a blessing."</p> 
               <pb n="280-281" xml:id="VAC8154-00000139"/> 
               <p>"For the land-sake, who can she be?"</p> 
               <p>"You can easily discover it if you set about it."</p> 
               <p>"<emph>Camille Bulbous?</emph>"</p> 
               <p>"No; she doesn't need your money. Not but that you might have her, for all I know to the contrary. But if I were to choose a wife for you, I should prefer the other. She is amiable, and she loves you."</p> 
               <p>"Who is it?" cried Sam, eager, and well-pleased.</p> 
               <p>"She has dark hair and eyes, and is not rich."</p> 
               <p>"Do you mean Miss-"</p> 
               <p>"Bayles."</p> 
               <p>"Sho! <emph>she</emph> ain't in love with me! I asked her to have me, long before I saw you, Miss Cameron, and she wouldn't."</p> 
               <p>"But she has changed her mind. The fact is, you have improved, vastly, Mr. Grizzle, and she is sensible of it. You remember, I was over at your house, the other day, when she came in. <emph>I</emph> saw, in a few moments, that she loved you. But, of course, she's not going to say so, until you ask her. I like her very much. Your mother is greatly attached to her, I can see. It is true, she has not money, like Camille Bulbous; but think, Mr. Grizzle, what a pleasure it will be to confer every thing upon her,-to be conscious that <emph>you</emph> have surrounded her with comfort and luxury."</p> 
               <p>"That's so!" said Sam, delighted.</p> 
               <p>"Will you promise me to think it over?"</p> 
               <p>"Well, y-yes!"</p> 
               <p>"Ask your mother, too. I believe her advice will agree with mine. Your mother is rather fond of style; but Miss Bayles will be as stylish as any of them as soon as she becomes Mrs. Grizzle. Don't you see how pretty she is growing? All she wants is handsome clothes to make her a belle."</p> 
                
               <p>"Sho!" murmured Sam again, but in an asserting voice.</p> 
               <p>"Try it, and see."</p> 
               <p>"If I thought she was really in love with me, I should hate to disappoint her."</p> 
               <p>"Well, you ask her the next time you see her. That will be the shortest way to find out. She's a sweet girl, and a lady, Mr. Grizzle; and if you marry her you must love her with all your heart."</p> 
               <p>"It's a cunning way of getting rid of me," soliloquized the young gentleman, as he wended his way home. "But it isn't a bad idea, after all. Miss Bayles was my first love, and she might as well be my last. If ma's suited, I am."</p> 
               <p>So Miss Cameron saved herself by providing her adorer with another lady-love.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XIX.</head> 
               <head type="sub">THE BREAKING OF THE GOLDEN BOWL.</head> 
               <p>THE snows of winter lay over our country neighborhood. Miss Bulbous, despairing of Sam, was said to have engaged herself to a Southerner, whose acquaintance she had made at the Fifth Avenue Hotel, where she and her father were now stopping. The fine carriages, the gilt buttons, prancing horses, and coats-of-arms, had many of them disappeared from the railway-station. The fashionable country was in the city. Even Mrs. Grizzle was talking of shutting up Rose Villa, for a couple of months, immediately after New Years.</p> 
               <p>The beautiful white-winged ships, too, no longer hovered over the blue river, which had drawn its coverlid of ice above it, and was sleeping a sleep disturbed by dreams of summer, if one were to judge by the sighs and soft moans which might be heard by ears bent close to listen. The gray Highlands were capped with white. Christmas had come and gone; and the whole neighborhood had been gay with bells and wreaths and candles. Mrs. Grizzle had put some of her money to good use, by decking a Christmas tree for poor children, upon which she had hung several hundred dollars' worth of substantial presents, as well as some dainties which were of no greater worth than to make the children's eyes dance and their mouths water, and their little hearts beat high for one bright hour.</p> 
               <p>During all these festivities a shadow had brooded over one house. For the first time since its wall came together there was no Christmas merry-making in the home of the Camerons. What could those two desolate women do, who sat there, watching the wintry clouds and listening to the wintry wind, awaiting, they knew not what fresh blow of misfortune? The joyous brother far away, the father still absent on his melancholy errand, the "flower of the family" blooming or perishing in some unknown atmosphere: they could do nothing but that dreariest of all things-sit and wait.</p> 
               <p>Mrs. Grizzle had tried hard to persuade Lissa into attending her Christmas party. It made her heart ache to see the young girl so pale and quiet. But Lissa could not think of meeting strangers, of entering into any pleasure, while that cloud of disgrace and sorrow drifted up from her horizon, as yet unperceived by others, but of whose coming she had received sure warning.</p> 
               <p>It was the Wednesday before the New Year, which would come in on Saturday. The two ladies sat, sadly musing, before the open fire in the library. After a long silence, the mother spoke.</p> 
               <p>"Do you remember, Elizabeth, how we made the fire here, the first time this season, for fear she would be chilly when she came in from that ride?"</p> 
               <p>"I was just thinking of it, mother. Sometimes, very seldom, I used to get tired of waiting upon her and humoring her little caprices. But oh, mother, how weary I am of <emph>not</emph> having her to serve. What a privilege it would be to deny myself something for her sake! to run for her shawl, to rub her little cold feet in my hands!"</p> 
               <p>"How lovely she was that night!" continued Mrs. Cameron, almost in a whisper. "How little we dreamed that she was a bride! Her eyes were like stars! Evidently, she was very happy; she did not realize that she was doing<pb n="284-285" xml:id="VAC8154-00000141"/> wrong by such concealment. Louis influenced her as he would a child."</p> 
               <p>"I think we kept her too much of a child, mother; she was never held closely to the responsibility of her actions, as another would have been. We were too indulgent-loved her too much."</p> 
               <p>The mother sighed, wearily.</p> 
               <p>"Elizabeth, if I could know where my child was, and that she was safe and content,-that she had no reason to repent the step she has taken,-I would gladly die this day."</p> 
               <p>"Oh, mother, do not talk so! Has not our father claims upon you, and your other children?"</p> 
               <p>"Yes, Lissa; but <emph>she</emph> was to me what Benjamin was to Jacob,-not really my youngest, yet always <emph>my baby,</emph> whom I could not let go from my bosom. Hark! who is that?"</p> 
               <p>"Do not disturb yourself, mother. Susie Grizzle, perhaps, upon one of her good mother's errands. I will step into the hall."</p> 
               <p>"It gives me a shock, every time the door-bell rings!" murmured Mrs. Cameron, sinking back into her chair, and pressing her hand to her heart, whose violent palpitation was painfully visible under the folds of her shawl.</p> 
               <p>In a moment or two Elizabeth returned with a long strip of paper which she had taken out of a yellow envelop.</p> 
               <p>"It is a telegraphic message from father."</p> 
               <p>"Read it first, and tell me what it says."</p> 
               <p>"He is on his way home-" hesitating.</p> 
               <p>"And Milla?"</p> 
               <p>"<emph>Is with him!</emph>"</p> 
               <p>"Oh, thank God!"</p> 
               <p>"But she is ill,-'<emph>very</emph> ill,' the message reads, 'and we must have every thing in readiness for her comfort. They will be here to-night, at seven o'clock; the carriage must be at the station.' Here, mother, dear, dearest mother, do not cry! Was I not just saying what a blessing it would be to have our darling again to wait on? She is ill; but we will make her better. It will be such delight to have her making her little demands upon us again! What shall we do first, Mother? It is four o'clock now."</p> 
               <p>"Let me shed my tears first, Lissa, that I may not weep so much to-night. I will be quiet presently. Go, do what is necessary."</p> 
               <p>"Let us prepare a bed on the sofa, here, and draw it up before the fire. This was always her favorite room."</p> 
               <p>"Yes, she will like to be here, I know."</p> 
               <p>"And beg the loan of Mrs. Grizzle's carriage. It is more comfortable than ours; we can shut out the sharp wind from it. I wish the wind would not blow so fiercely; it will be so cold for her!"</p> 
               <p>"Tell Dinah, Lissa, to have a nice supper prepared. She remembers well what were Milla's favorite dishes."</p> 
               <p>"Yes, Martin will be so glad too. All our servants have missed Milla."</p> 
               <p>"They could not help but love her."</p> 
               <p>"She was so gentle and dependent."</p> 
               <p>Thus with strophe and antistrophe did mother and sister sing the praises of the absent darling, a mournful undertone in all their gladness, for they feared as much as they hoped, while they hastened to prepare for her return.</p> 
               <p>The night swooped down suddenly, bleak and windy. Every branch of the noble trees on the lawn moaned and tossed; wild, wailing voices of the wind whispered or shrieked at the shutters; but within the home, all was as bright as expectant love could make it. The coal lay in the burnished grate, like a mass of molten gold from which, occasionally, would leap a little jet of flame, sending a warm glimmer over gilt bindings of books and picture-frames. The improvised couch was steeping itself in pleasant<pb n="286-287" xml:id="VAC8154-00000142"/> ant heats; a tiny pair of slippers were warming on the rug, a decanter of choice wine stood on a table; Mrs. Cameron, wearing a new dress in honor of the occasion, smiling, but very pale, fidgetted with a book, and tried to read, while her strained ear only listened for the expected whistle of the locomotive. Lissa was in the carriage, her arms full of wraps, sitting down by the dreary little station, listening to the moaning wind, with a heart heavy with forebodings.</p> 
               <p>How long it was until seven o'clock! But the hour struck at last, the train rushed in, and paused; she saw by the glimmering lamplight her father and Sabrina descend from the cars, bearing in their arms the long-familiar burden. Martin opened the carriage-door, and the next moment Milla lay in her arms, speechless, but clinging to her with a feeble clasp, while her father placed the wraps about her.</p> 
               <p>"Go very gently, Martin," he said, as he and the nurse entered. "She is nearly exhausted by the long journey."</p> 
               <p>Very gently the carriage rolled over the snowy road to the old home. Milla tried to raise her head when the wheels stopped; but it sank again. She could see little of the old trees, the leafless rose-vine, the familiar porch, as strong arms lifted her out, bearing her through the lighted hall, into the dear old library,-into the presence of home and mother.</p> 
               <p>"Milla, my darling!"</p> 
               <p>She saw her mother's face, felt her kiss, and then, for a little while, all was deaf and dark-she seemed to sink down-down into death. They placed the light form-so light now that the burden of it was scarcely felt, on the warm couch, and poured the ready cordial between her lips; and presently the breath fluttered stronger. Now, indeed, the mother wanted to weep, and had no tears. Those great bright, sunken eyes and wasted outlines touched the mother's heart too deeply for tears.</p> 
                
               <p>The old family physician was there in less than half an hour. He felt the pulse, he looked into the eyes of his well-beloved little patient.</p> 
               <p>"I never thought she would live to be twenty," he said, aside to Mr. Cameron, who awaited his decision in another room; "but this folly of our pet has wasted her small store of life with lavish haste. There is but a drop or two remaining. I doubt if she holds out one week."</p> 
               <p>So the truth was spoken. Mother and sister were compelled to hear it. Short time, indeed, for those loving ministrations they had longed to bestow! That night Milla was forbidden to speak. She could only <emph>look</emph> her joy at seeing her friends. The next day she was still very feeble, replying with her old fond smile to all the tender attentions which beset her. On Friday, she was permitted to converse a little; she could even sit up in the green-satin chair, wherein she used so much to loll, looking like a water-lily in its leaves.</p> 
               <p>How had the lily withered in one brief season! The wedding-ring, so small at first, would now scarcely stay on the thin hand. Yet, because her cheeks were flushed and her eyes brilliant, the mother clung to hope, and began to say, in her heart, that the doctor was mistaken.</p> 
               <p>The third day of her arrival home was the first day of the New Year. It was a beautiful, winter day, calm and full of sunshine. The house was made pleasant; every one endeavored to be cheerful for the invalid's sake, who was now in bed, in her own pretty chamber, where she had asked to be taken.</p> 
               <p>"Good-bye, doctor," she said, in a peculiar tone, when the old man was about to leave her, after his daily visit, on the morning of the New Year.</p> 
               <p>"Good-bye, child," he said; "a pleasant voyage to you," and he kissed her, with a tear in his eye.</p> 
               <pb n="288-289" xml:id="VAC8154-00000143"/> 
               <p>"Milla!" exclaimed her mother, when the door closed on the physician.</p> 
               <p>"He knows, mother, that he will never see me again. My feet and hands are cold with coming death. I know it."</p> 
               <p>A silence fell on the group, which pressed closer about her.</p> 
               <p>"I am dying, and I want to say a few words about Louis before I go. It is true that he left me; but not until he was compelled to. The officers were upon his track; they were at the doors of our house. I, myself, urged him to fly. I know all about his sin. He was tempted to do wrong, because of his poverty. I knew that he deceived me, and others,-that he misled me, caused me to deceive and forsake my family; but I did not cease to love him. I am afraid I loved him the more. Lissa, do you remember what I once said to you? that if I knew I should not live three months, I should not hesitate to become his wife? I shall not live three months. He has killed me; he would have killed you, Lissa, if you had married him. And think, how much better it is that it should be I, who was foredoomed to a short life from the first."</p> 
               <p>The sobs of her sister interrupted her for a moment.</p> 
               <p>"Don't think Louis did not love me," she went on. "He did. He was always good to me. I think it was the knowledge of his crimes that killed me. I seemed to wither away, after I began to suspect them. I teased him to tell me why he had not gone to Germany; why he travelled in disguise; why he went to the Southern city, and kept me and Sabrina shut up in constant solitude. I asked him, passionately, if he was ashamed of me. That made him angry. He said, 'No! but he had committed robberies, and the officers were after him like dogs after a fox. He was not ashamed of his little girl; he was only sorry she had married so bad a man.'"</p> 
                
               <p>Here Milla paused, and a strange expression passed over her face.</p> 
               <p>"Do you remember I said, Lissa, that I would give my life to be his wife even for one week?"</p> 
               <p>"Do not talk; it is too much for you," pleaded her father.</p> 
               <p>"It will make no difference an hour or two hence, father, and I shall die more contented, having spoken. I was punished for that mad speech. I never have been Mr. Dassel's true wife. I would not tell you this, if I were not dying. I never knew it until the day before he fled, father, and you came. He was looking over some papers in a small trunk. A letter dropped out. I snatched it playfully, opened, and read:</p>

               <p>"And then I thought of the story of Count Konigsberg, and stared at him, wildly, I suppose, for he caught it from me with a laugh,-oh, such a laugh!-and said I was punished for my inquisitiveness. <emph>That</emph> stabbed me to the heart, mother. I felt, then, that I could live but a little time, and I prayed that the time might be very short. <emph>After all my love!</emph>" mournfully.</p> 
               <p>"Milla," said Lissa, quickly leaning over her dying sister, "would it not be joy for you to know that you were the Count's true wife?"</p> 
               <p>"What do you mean?"</p> 
               <p>"I had a letter last night from Robbie. I would have told you sooner, had I dreamed that you were aware of his previous marriage. Robbie writes to inform me that he has heard of the death of the Countess Konigsberg, who died of a decline, after being months confined to her apartments, on November 10th. You were married on the 13th.</p> 
               <pb n="290-291" xml:id="VAC8154-00000144"/> 
               <p>"Thank God for that!" murmured the young wife, with an effort bringing her hand to her lips, and kissing her wedding-ring.</p> 
               <p>"I have been wilful," she continued presently, "and impatient and stubborn about many things, I know. But, oh, I have suffered so much pain! Not even you, mother, know how much I have suffered all my life, I ask you all to forgive me all my faults."</p> 
               <p>"My child, you break our hearts!"</p> 
               <p>"And you, Lissa, do you forgive me? After all, your love was not like mine; and it is well, as it has turned out, that I took him from you. I have always loved all my friends. If I have sinned, it has been in loving too much. You will tell Robbie so, dear boy!"</p> 
               <p>Milla's strength had flared up like an expiring torch, enabling her to say this much; now she lay exhausted, and apparently sinking into a stupor, while the low sound of weeping filled the room.</p> 
               <p>Suddenly her voice, silver-clear and strangely thrilling, took up the burden of a poem which had been a great favorite of hers for years. Often, in the pleasant evenings forever gone, she had repeated it to her friends with an impassioned glow of utterance, which, from one so fragile, had almost startled them. Imagine, then, the pain with which they heard the familiar rhythms rise from those dying lips: <q>

                  </q>
               </p> 
               <p>Their sobs were stifled, their breaths repressed, as the silver syllables stole through the room. In the stillness which followed, Milla opened her eyes, and looked from face to face with an indescribable, solemn smile, murmuring, <q>
                     <lg type="quotation"> 
                        <l rend="ti-1">"Say never, ye loved-ONCE. *   *   * </l>

                  </q>
               </p> 
               <p>Then that numbness of death, which had crept up from hands and feet, touched her lips and eyelids; she lay, for hours, in a stupor, which could hardly be told from death; but, at set of sun, she roused herself to say, quite aloud,</p> 
               <p>"If ever you see Louis again, tell him I loved him to the last. Tell him, I ask him to repent, so as to meet me in heaven."</p> 
               <p>Shortly thereafter she drew her last breath-her soul exhaled from its flower-like form, and fled to God who gave it.</p> 
               <p>It was a sleety, stormy day upon which she was buried; but all the neighborhood about Evergreen Station were in attendance. Curiosity to learn something of the details of<pb n="292-293" xml:id="VAC8154-00000145"/> her brief married life, a flying shadow of mystery, which all caught but none could hold, increased the interest which drew old neighbors and new to the house of mourning. They scanned, with eager eyes, the coffin-plate: <q>
                     <p>MILLA CAMERON DASSEL.<lb/> T. 17 YEARS.</p>
                  </q>
               </p> 
               <p>But none knew, not even Mrs. Grizzle, that the true title of the sleeper was "Countess of Konigsberg." How lovely she looked, in death's restful slumber, is still whispered by the community. All her deformity was hidden away in satin folds and fragrant flowers; her fair, bright hair, worn as always during her life, floated down either side the young face and glittered along her white dress almost to her knees.</p> 
               <p>Count Konigsberg has not yet received his wife's dying message, nor is it to be anticipated that he ever will. What land now shelters the adventurer is not known to those most interested in tracing him. When Mr. Cameron reached St. Louis, during that search for the missing couple, of which we have told, he thought the Count's arrest was certain; but when he traced him to the lodgings where he had been living under still another assumed name, he found him-not. He had been warned, in time to flee, taking with him every thing of value, bidding his sick and wretched wife a last farewell.</p> 
               <p>The police arrested, however, a German Jew, for receiving stolen goods. This was the person whom Dassel had represented as a cousin, but who was, in fact, a money-lender well-known of you, in Baden-Baden, by the Count, who had "patronized" him, in that city, with magnificent liberality. This person, removing to America, had met and recognized the Count in New York, soon after his arrival in this country. To prevent betrayal, and knowing the utterly unprincipled character of the broker, the Count had bribed him to secrecy, promising him rich commissions when he should establish himself in St. Louis, whither he was going. It may be that desperation at having no money wherewith to buy the fellow's silence, drove him to commit the burglary at Borden &amp; DeWitt's. Having secured the goods, he had invented the excuse of a journey to St. Louis, where he left the spoils to be sold on shares, through channels which the broker would be wise enough to find.</p> 
               <p>It is known that the Count escaped to New Orleans, and from thence to Cuba. There pursuit was baffled. Those who knew him best during his career in this country are divided in their opinion as to his utter depravity. It is not impossible that the utter devotion of Milla Cameron awoke some real response in his heart. It may be that his object in endeavoring to rob her of her legacy, on the night preceding the day appointed for their marriage, was to secure her fortune and save her the wretched career which must be hers as his companion. But his conduct towards his first wife was too infamous to give much ground for such belief. It is more natural to conclude that he wished to shake off companions who might fatally embarrass him in his flight.</p> 
               <p>It is not improbable that he first engaged himself to Elizabeth because he had nothing else to occupy his mind, and was reckless of consequences. His settling in New York, where, at any moment, he was in danger of being recognized by foreigners or followed by detectives from abroad, may seem a bold venture on his part. Yet this was in keeping with the cold courage of his character. Being rendered entirely penniless by his sudden flight from Europe, he had to begin modestly, keeping, at all times, a look-out for superior chances to operate in wider fields.</p> 
               <p>Upon the occasion of his visit to the photographer's with<pb n="294-295" xml:id="VAC8154-00000146"/> Mrs. Grizzle, he came near betrayal. The French minister was well known to Count Konigsberg, who, fortunately for himself, was the first to perceive an acquaintance. He concealed himself by means of a screen which stood at the foot of a second flight of stairs, through which he was peering with that sardonic smile which sometimes curled his lips, when the astonished lady missed him from her side.</p> 
               <p>Sam Grizzle and Miss Bayles are married. They had a grand wedding in May. It took Mrs. Grizzle some time to reconcile herself to Miss Bayles' humble origin! But, when she did fully accept her as her future daughter-in-law, she did it with her usual heartiness. She insisted upon her coming to Rose Villa to make her preparations, and would hear to no less than six bridesmaids with interminable trains. The bride, with the blood of three generations of poor artists in her veins, was a person upon whom money could be lavished to advantage. Mrs. Grizzle was delighted with her when her "good points" were "brought out" with white satin and point-lace, and beamed her motherly effulgence equally upon her and the bridegroom, who had toned down into quite a modest representative of Young America, and was far worthier of his honors than when first we made his acquaintance.</p> 
               <p>Grizzle, senior, pronounces his new daughter "prime," which, with him, means "A No. 1,"-no better in the market.</p> 
               <p>We are sorry to have to chronicle that Abel Bellows drew a prize with that last ticket which he purchased before his visit to the Tombs-a prize of twenty-five hundred dollars in gold, which was less by fifteen hundred than he had spent on lotteries since he first began to invest in them. We are sorry, because we wish that <emph>no</emph> lottery prizes ever were drawn. But, since Abel is one of our friends, we must keep a true record of what happened to him. By advice of Miss Bayles and his wife, he retired to a small fruit-farm in New Jersey, for which he paid cash down, and where he and his children are very happy in the midst of Lawton blackberries, Bartlett pears, and Newtown pippins. Mrs. Bellows' melancholy temperament finds occupation in predicting terrible drouths, devouring insects, and early frosts. Still, she is a happier woman than of old.</p> 
               <p>It is yet winter in the home of the Camerons, where once there reigned a perpetual summer of love and happiness; but God, who is the only perfect Lover, will surely, some time, renew the bloom.</p> 
               <p>On the slender marble shaft which points to heaven, from Milla's grave, is inscribed: <q>
                     <lg type="quotation"> 
                        <l>"Love strikes but one hour-LOVE! those <emph>never</emph> loved</l>

            <head>COMPANION TO IRVING'S WASHINGTON.</head> 
            <p>GEN. GREENE'S LIFE.-The Life of Nathaniel Greene, Major-General in the Army of the Revolution. By Geo. Washington Greene, author of Historical View of the American Revolution. 3 vols. 8vo. University Press. The first volume is now ready. Price to Subscribers, $4 per volume.</p> 
            <p>The history of the United States is naturally divided into three parts:</p> 
            <p>1. The history of their foundation, or their Colonial history; 2. The history of their transition from colonial to independent national life, or the history of the Revolution. 3. The history of their constitutional life, or the history of the growth of the Union. A thorough knowledge of each of these periods is essential to a just comprehension of the whole. The seeds of the Revolution must be sought in our Colonial history. The history of our life as a nation loses both its philosophical and its practical importance if separated from the history of the Revolution. A careful study of the War of Independence would have saved us thousands of lives and millions of money in the War of the Rebellion. Next to the life of Washington, it is in the life of Greene that this history is to be sought; nor can it be fully understood without reading both. It is in the hope of contributing to the materials for this study, and in the conviction that to preserve the memory of great and good men is one of the highest offices of patriotism, that these volumes are offered to the student of American history.</p> 
            <p>"The first volume of the biography is a very handsome octavo volume of nearly six hundred pages, printed in the best style of the University Press. It brings Gen. Greene's life down to the year 1778. The style is clear, simple, vigorous, readily adapting itself to the varied demands of description, reflection, and narrative, and betraying on every page that unnamable peculiarity which indicates that the labor of composition is literally a labor of love, and that the biographer is writing from a full heart as well as from a full mind."-<title>Boston Transcript.</title>

            <head>FAY'S GREAT OUTLINE OF GEOGRAPHY FOR HIGH SCHOOLS AND FAMILIES.</head> 
            <p>The text-book in 12mo; the Atlas in large folio. Retail price, $3.75; Library edition, in cloth, $4.25. Liberal terms for schools. Teachers supplied with a copy for examination at half price.</p> 
            <p>"The author of this work presents the public with an entirely new system of studying Geography. We confess the plan strikes us with great favor. Without disparaging other text-books, we must say, this seems to us to be more exactly adapted to its purpose than any. The mechanical execution of the Atlas deserves strong praise. If you have a child who is hard to learn Geography, or one who wishes to learn it easier, or if you wish to undertake a rsum of your own knowledge, or add to what you already know, Fay's system is the way to do it, and his Great Outline the means. The most stupid will find that knowledge would be instilled into them in spite of themselves."-<title>Albany Evening Journal.</title>
            </p> 
            <p>"The treatise of Mr. Fay is complete in itself. He gives a well-constructed Atlas of the globe, and with it a little manual containing a series of lessons on the maps, with occasional illustrative comments. This careful map-study, embracing physical as well as political characteristics, may serve either as an introduction to geography or as a final review or rsum of one's knowledge. In either case it is adapted to the older scholars of our ordinary schools. The plan which it proposes seems to us very well carried out; and simple as the 'Outline' at first appears, we have been surprised to discover its comprehensiveness and completeness. Obviously the book may be used advantageously before or after other books. There is one feature of the book which has particularly interested us, bearing, as we presume, the impress of Mr. Fay's long acquaintance with German schools. It is intended that the scholar shall learn his lessons under the eye and with the aid of his teacher, who is to <emph>drill</emph> the class. Most of our American teachers do not teach, but hear recitations. Mr. Fay would have them go over each lesson with the class, and see that all its contents are mastered.</p> 
            <p>"Mr. Fay's maps and text are brought down to the latest moment. Alaska belongs to the United States, the reconstructed North Germany is delineated, and the statistics are gathered from Behm's admirable 'Hand-book,' and other recent publications."-<title>The Nation, N.Y.</title>

               <p>This is the most comprehensive and reliable book of reference in this department ever published.

No good library can dispense with this volume. The English edition, heretofore imported by Messrs.

               <head>GREAT OUTLINE OF UNIVERSAL GEOGRAPHY.</head> 
               <p>For High Schools and Families. With a Universal Atlas. By Theo. S. Fay. 2 vols. School edition. Price, $3.75. Library ed. Cloth, $4.25.</p> 
               <p>The maps in this Atlas are, it is believed, more carefully and accurately prepared than those in any similar work now in use.</p> 
               <p>Among the advantages of the method adopted by Mr. Fay, are the following:</p> 
               <p>1. The teacher reads all lessons from the book. The pupil follows every word upon the plates. He thus studies, at the same time, with his ear and eye. The effect will soon become apparent.</p> 
               <p>2. No formal demand is made on his memory; yet he cannot help learning by heart, understanding, and retaining what he has learned; because the book itself teaches him how it must be studied.</p> 
               <p>3. By an arrangement equally simple and useful, the confusion of crowded names on the maps is avoided.</p> 
               <p>4. The text is constructed so that the more advanced pupils may easily become competent teachers of other classes.</p> 
               <p>5. The work will be equally useful to mothers, governesses, elder sisters and brothers, who, even when not prepared by previous study, will find no difficulty, by its aid, in taking the younger members of the family through the whole course.</p> 
               <p>6. No study at home is necessary. The recitation is study enough. Thus the trouble of carrying books backward and forward is avoided.</p> 
               <p>7. The text is broken apart into 500 or 600 sections, each one carefully arranged after, or rather above the other, so that the ascent is as easy as the steps of a flight of stairs.</p> 
               <p>8. If anything is left out which other School-Geographies give, it is done intentionally, to supply the place with more important matter, which others omit. Such remarks, therefore, as "<emph>this river," "that town," etc., are not given,</emph> will, we think, be withdrawn, upon a better understanding of the plan. A man, passing around the globe, does not carry everything in his knapsack.</p>
