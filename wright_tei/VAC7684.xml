CHAPTER~ I.              /&#xD;
THE PAJRFAXES OF ROEBUOW.&#xD;
ROEBUCIC was one of the fiuiest estates in the ~coun-&#xD;

,From the margin ofthestream spreads. out~, a wide&#xD;
and fertile bottojn t9~a bluff~aboi t fifty f~et high, and&#xD;
from. the bluffa table of iuidn~ating land extends to&#xD;
the foot of a hill called ~lk Ridge. Several brook;&#xD;
flowing from the ridge to the river, cut the plateau&#xD;
with ravines i~nd delis, and supply the flei4s with&#xD;
water. The native forest, covering many hundred&#xD;
acres together, and scattered here and there in small&#xD;
groves, i~ont4butes to the various beauties of the land-&#xD;

alas !) a large and elegant mansion, whiob, a few years&#xD;
ago, replaced a more ancient edifice, then destroyed&#xD;
by accidental fire. Before the house a grassy lawn&#xD;
extended belo:~v the blufl which there declined into&#xD;
the bottom with gradual slope. About the mansion&#xD;
trim walks, edged with box, led among evergreen or&#xD;
flowering shrubs and trees of rare foliage or stately&#xD;
altitude, both of native and foreign origin, and&#xD;
through a flower-garden blooming with all the floral&#xD;
glories of Virginia. At a~ greater distance orchards,&#xD;
vineyards, meadows and fields of corn, tobacco, wheat&#xD;
and other crops, in the orderly circle of their seasonS,&#xD;
rewarded the busy hand of skilful culture with the&#xD;
ripe gifts of a genial climate and prolific soil. In&#xD;
various directions might be seen the negro quarters,&#xD;
hamlets of white cabins, with' their "patches," or&#xD;
kitchen-gardens. attached. On every side the build-&#xD;
ings, fencess, irnplenwuts~ kind mc~des of cultivation,&#xD;
showed the intelligent spirit of modern improvement,&#xD;
th~.igh here and there might be detected, also, ~traits&#xD;
of the pride of inheritance and marks of veneration&#xD;
for old usages and traditions.&#xD;
The new mansion and the modern improvements&#xD;
were the work of Colonel Frederick Fairfax, the&#xD;
last who has borne that name. Both the name of&#xD;
Frederick and the title of Colonel devolved upon him&#xD;
by a kind of lnheritane0, as if they were annexed to&#xD;
the estate. During three generations they designated&#xD;
the proprietor. The first Colonel Frederick had won&#xD;
the rank in actual service. The title was transmitted&#xD;
by country courtesy to the son, who inherited his&#xD;
name and estate, and, after two generations, it became&#xD;
an easy trick of inheritance, by custom,, to invest Fred-&#xD;
erick, the succeeding son and heir, with the same title&#xD;

when he came into poSsessipn. of the ~anie estate.&#xD;
This was a natural expression of courtesy on the part&#xD;
of a community that always respected pedigrees,&#xD;
nourished traditions, admired martial virtues amd&#xD;
afi~ected military hono~s. But the title, thus derived,&#xD;
was seldom conferred with his name in i~ll upon ~the&#xD;
third Frederick Fairfax. lie w~is usually but "Colonel&#xD;
Fred." to his neighbors. The hi~mblest of them eften&#xD;
saluted him with that familiar brevity, and he was&#xD;
thus commonly styled throughout tile country. It&#xD;
may be thence inferred that he bad effabJo manners,&#xD;
and a frank, cheerful, sunny disposition. This happy&#xD;
temper relieved, without disguising~ 14s pride of birth.&#xD;
His fortune excited n~ envy, yet familiarity never&#xD;
degraded the dignity of his demeanor. He was a&#xD;
mnan of tall, commanding stature, of vigorous frameand&#xD;
graceful action; with bold,, but regular features. Ifls&#xD;
complexion was f~ir~and fresh, but imbrowned by the&#xD;
sun. His eyes were blue, and his hair,, of light brown,&#xD;

he carried away the honors of the University. Then&#xD;
he spent in the healthy pleasures of the c&#xD;

in visiting cities, the period assigned by custom to&#xD;
young gentlemen of wealth for recreation between the&#xD;
discipline of youth and the responsibilities of man-&#xD;

&#xD;
tative in the legislature' of that State. lie had served&#xD;
several sessions in that body with rising 'credit, when&#xD;
the death of his father calle~1 him, at the age of thirty,&#xD;
to the care of his estate. Thenceforth he dev6t~d&#xD;
himself to agriculture and to the duties of a private&#xD;
citizen. In the management of a large e~tate,~and in&#xD;
the performance of his proper part as a gentleman of&#xD;
prominent position and. leading influence in his&#xD;
county, he found employment~ for his ability and&#xD;
energy. He was among the most successful planters&#xD;
of Virginia. Free fi~om the canker 'of avarice, he felt&#xD;
an honorable ambition to excel in whatever he at-&#xD;
tempted and a liberal pleasure in the profitable. em-&#xD;
ployment of all the means[ entrusted to his care. lie&#xD;
was proud of the public benefits which resulted from&#xD;
the improvements he introduced; he had pride in a&#xD;
princely revenue; but his benevolence was not' lees&#xD;
princely.&#xD;
As a slaveholder a numerous population depended&#xD;
upon him, and, with his accustomed energy, he exer-&#xD;
cised over them the functions both of guardian and&#xD;
governor. N~o slaves had their wants' supplied with&#xD;
more judicious or provident liberality than his; none&#xD;
were more contented, or with better reason; but none&#xD;
yielded larger profits from their labor. By regulating&#xD;
their industry~ according ti a ~velbdevised system, by&#xD;
attention to 'th&amp;amp;ir health, comfort and cheerfuluess-&#xD;
by the. employment of proper overseers, axid by the&#xD;
constant supervision of his own intelligence, he de-&#xD;
rived from the moderate exertions of all ample pros-&#xD;
'perity, of which they all partook. Believing the ser-&#xD;
vitude of negroes under a superior race to be a need-&#xD;
fbul supplement to their improvident natxire, he 'did&#xD;
not, with sentimental inconsistency, shrink from the&#xD;
&#xD;
exercise ci' the authority and discipline which servi-&#xD;
tude implies. He was a~ humane master, but he was&#xD;
master. The community under his control was bur-&#xD;
dened with no drones, unless two or three able.~bodied&#xD;
but idle pensioners deserved that opprobrious epi-&#xD;
thet. It was a community which produced within it-&#xD;
self nearly everything that its essential wants. re-&#xD;
quired. Among the~ servants were carpenters, shoe-&#xD;
makers, smiths, weavers and other Mtisans, skilful in&#xD;
their trades. Besides the staple crops, the plantation&#xD;
produced flax, wool and other materials, to be fabri-&#xD;
cated for the use of the negroes. Evey married&#xD;
slave was allowed 'a "patch," or kitchen.garden, pro-&#xD;
portioned in size to the number, of his family, ~and the&#xD;
most thrifty among them i~nade more profit from these&#xD;
patches and from sales of fowls and eggs, than the&#xD;
ordinary wages of laborers. They were, of course,&#xD;
supplied with food and clothing by the master.&#xD;
He was not the least industrious member of the~&#xD;
community. It was his habit to give the day to busi-&#xD;
ness, until near the hour of dinner, which was about&#xD;
four o'clock. He spent the morning in correspond-&#xD;
ence, or examining accounts or other in-door work,&#xD;
or, more commonly, in riding over his plantation, and&#xD;
giving his personal attention to all its operations.&#xD;
This had been his 'habit for many years, and now, as&#xD;
he approached the age of three score, his industry was&#xD;
not relaxed. So benignly. crept the -shadow"'of age&#xD;
over his active and useful life that "his eye was not&#xD;
'dim nor his natural force abased."&#xD;
'~His wife, some five years younger thauhirnsel~f; was&#xD;
a lady of comely person, and, in character and mau~&#xD;
ners~ ~an agreeable type of mature womanhood. She&#xD;
was the daughter of a distinguished public nian, and&#xD;

before her marriage had been a toast and a belle in&#xD;
the most elevated circle olr society. But when she&#xD;
was led to the altar, she left upon it all the gay gar~&#xD;
lands of maidenly vanity, and, with the ring, she wore&#xD;
thenceforth the graceful dignities of wedded love.&#xD;
As a matron, she was proud of matronhood as the&#xD;
proper consummation of a woman's ambition-the&#xD;
natural sphere of her highest duties, honors and de-&#xD;
lights. In Virginia, by the grace of God, women are&#xD;
feminine. They aim to excel in the lovely qualities&#xD;
of their own sex, without competing for the prizes of&#xD;
the other. The form of Mrs. Fairfax had once been&#xD;
delicate, but years, which threatened wrinkles,&#xD;
brought a smooth and pleasant roundness to her&#xD;
cheeks and a more ample dignity to her form. As&#xD;
the wife of a planter and mistress of an extensive es.&#xD;
establishment, she had many responsibilities and -not a&#xD;
few anxieties. 1~ut a sense of responsibility, suited&#xD;
to gitch a station in life, ha4 been cultivated as part&#xD;
of her education, and had been exercised ever since&#xD;
her marriage. Sustained by her husband, she fulfilled&#xD;
the duties of her position with constant and cheerful&#xD;
fidelity. Her life was one of daily usefulness, and&#xD;
her servants were scarcely less indebted to her&#xD;
W9lnanly kindness'than to the provident care of their&#xD;
master. Yet, the nature of this gentlewoman was of&#xD;
such delicate texture that ~he leaned continually upon&#xD;
the strength of her husband, and was dependent upon&#xD;
his society and affection for every hour of her happi-&#xD;
ness. She, to whom so many feeble creatures looked&#xD;
up for protection, looked tip to him with a trust&#xD;
almost religious~&#xD;
There was no living son to inherit the name and&#xD;
title of "' Colonel Fred." Several children had died.&#xD;
There remained only one daughter. The loss of chil-&#xD;

&#xD;
dren h~id bQen almost the sole affliction of Colonel&#xD;
Fairfax and his wife during their married lives*&#xD;
Their parental affection was now concentrated upon&#xD;
their daughter, Julia. She ~ about the age of&#xD;
twenty. She had the fair skin and browh hair of her&#xD;
father, with the hazel eyes of her mother. In person&#xD;
she rather surpassed the middle height of woman,&#xD;
but was not quite tall. Her form might have keen&#xD;
deemed too lender for perfect beauty, but its outlines&#xD;
were round enough for grace. Her face cannot be&#xD;
described feature by feature, without prodm~ing a&#xD;
false idea of its character. All who saw it pro-&#xD;
nounced it beautiful; bi~t those who saw it only once&#xD;
might dispute with each other what was its chief at-&#xD;
tribute. Such was the transparent sincerity of her&#xD;
countenance, that the E )ecial charm of her beauty&#xD;
changed with her emotions. Her customary manner&#xD;
was one of modest and winning gentleness.. But she&#xD;
often displayed the gaiety of girlhood and innocence.&#xD;
Every tender sentiment, every pure passion impressed&#xD;
itself upon her heart, and flashed its expression in her&#xD;
eyes as pictures are made by a glance of sunlight.&#xD;
Under this versatile delicacy, however,, her essential&#xD;
character had the firmness of high principle and&#xD;
almost masculine courage. Being an only child, and&#xD;
loving her parents with reverential devotion, she&#xD;
deavored to fill for them the vacant places of sons&#xD;
and daughters. She interested herself in all her'&#xD;
father's pursuits, promoting his plans and sharing his&#xD;
counsels. She often rode with him over the planta-&#xD;
tion, chatting of crops with a tongue as lively as&#xD;
maidens use to discuss the latest fashion of artificial&#xD;
flowers. By frequent association with her father in&#xD;
manly avocations and pleasures, she may have eon-&#xD;

In introducing to the reader the Fairfaxes of Rqe-&#xD;
buck, we should not pass over the Colonel's bachelor&#xD;
brother, Richard; but his loquacious habit will make&#xD;
him. known to all who come within the sound of his&#xD;
voice. He had an estate of his own, and kept up a&#xD;
domestic establishment upon it; but the greater part&#xD;
of his time was spent at Roebuck, or, in winter, at*&#xD;
Richmond.' He was two years younger than his&#xD;
brother, the, Colonel, and was a man of small stature.&#xD;
9But by some f~rg&amp;amp;tten trick of nursery nomenclature&#xD;
he had been called in childhood "big brother," and&#xD;
so he was still sometimes playfully styled by the&#xD;
larger and elder Frederick. He had been educated&#xD;
as a physician, and entered upon the practice of his&#xD;
-profession under the influence of young ambition.&#xD;
But, after a few years, the easy independence 'of&#xD;
hereditary acres tempted him away from a voca-&#xD;
tioi~ so laborious. He was once disappointed in an&#xD;
affair of love, and that ordinary event, touching one&#xD;
of the keys of a whimsical nature, made him forswear&#xD;
matrimony altogether. lIe retained the' title of&#xD;
Doctor, and as he grew' to be an old bache~r,' he was&#xD;
generallyy named, with curt familiarity, Doctor Dick.&#xD;
His style of conversation did not repress the liberty&#xD;
which men were 'inclined to take with his name; for&#xD;
it was frequently a style of satirical banter and half-&#xD;
com~c extravagance, lie sometimes affected a bitter~&#xD;
ness of invective that might have convicted him of&#xD;
extreme ill-nature, if his. conduct had not proved that&#xD;
- the roughness of his tongue was to his heart as a&#xD;
crabbed preface to a generous volume.&#xD;

CHAPTER II.&#xD;
SLAVES AT nOEBUCIC.&#xD;
ONE morning in the spring of they year eighteen&#xD;
hundred and sixty-one, Colonel Fairfax, accordingg to&#xD;
his custom, rode out from his house to make the&#xD;
grand round of his plantation. We are not to aecom-.&#xD;
pany him with a view of' observing the scenery of the&#xD;
farm, or of noting the information he obtained or the&#xD;
orders 'he gave or the progress of cultivation. Those&#xD;
who would learn in detail how the agriculture of Vir.&#xD;
ginia was so greatly improved,-.as it ha~ been during&#xD;
the last quarter of a century, with immense advantage&#xD;
to both races who inhabit there, will find more&#xD;
authentic sources of information. We are to chroni-&#xD;
ole only a few incidents of' the colonel's morning ride&#xD;
that have an interest more personal and less grave&#xD;
than the topics of an agricultural report.&#xD;
Not far from the mansion stood several negro cabins&#xD;
in a cluster, and around them swarmed a number of&#xD;
young Africans, looking like bees about their hives,&#xD;
but idling like butterflies in the early sunshine. Rid-&#xD;
ing to the door of one of those cabins, the colonel dis-&#xD;
mounted and entered it to make a visit, which he re-&#xD;
peated almost daily. Within was an old negro - man&#xD;
lying upon a bed, from which he rose when he saw&#xD;
his master coining to the doors His age was evidently&#xD;
very great, and he reckoned it roundly at a hundred.&#xD;
lie wore a long white beard, which he preseiTed at&#xD;

&#xD;
the request of his master. His hair was nearly as&#xD;
white as wool. Rising from the bed he walked feebly&#xD;
with the help of a long cane to a ~tool, on which he&#xD;
seated himself in obedience to a gesture of the cob&#xD;
onel, after they had shaken hands with each other.&#xD;
The master stood while they held the brief conversa-&#xD;
tion which was so often repeated, and for which old&#xD;
Valentine looked forward as the leading event of his&#xD;
daily life. J3efore age had impaired his faculties he&#xD;
had been a fair though rather favol ble type of his&#xD;
race in Yirgin~a. It was his pride to have served&#xD;
three generations of the Faixfaxes of Roebuck. All&#xD;
the respectability of the family was appropriated to&#xD;
himself, but only in comparing his station with tha~t&#xD;
of other negroes. He yielded the place of superiority&#xD;
to the white race without doubt or reluctance, and as&#xD;
he assigned the highest rank in that race to the Fair.&#xD;
fax family, he and the other servants of that family-&#xD;
were at the top of t1~ie black ladder. Fidelity and&#xD;
obedience were the two prime virtues of hi~ class,&#xD;
according to hi~ moral code. For the rest of morab&#xD;
ity the masters were responsible. Reason, principle&#xD;
and free will would not have J~ept him in a Tight path&#xD;
long if left to himself, but he was capable of under-&#xD;
standing and. practicing such simple and direct duties&#xD;
as fidelity and obedience to a master. Through them&#xD;
he was made useful and happy, and wa~ civilized&#xD;
beyond the highest conception of his grandfather,&#xD;
who was a native African, and above the independent&#xD;
attainments of his race during forty centuries. The&#xD;
brutality and treachery of savage blood were nearly&#xD;
extinguished in him, and, as a docile and contented&#xD;
slave, he spent his life in cheerfttl labor with many&#xD;
merry holidays. In servitude lie. had the pleasures&#xD;
&#xD;
which his better nature craved, but not those higher&#xD;
enjoyments which could not be his in any condition.&#xD;
Among temples which all the tribes in Africa could&#xD;
never hav~e built, he learned the practical precepts of&#xD;
a religion whose sublime dogmas his ancestors could&#xD;
not have preserved in memory from the rising to' the&#xD;
setting of the sun. And now it was his boast that he&#xD;
had been always a faithful servant, and his master,'&#xD;
recognizing the claim which such servitude estab..&#xD;
lished, treated the old man with the kindest 'care and&#xD;
with sincere respect.&#xD;
"How are you today, Uncle Valentine ?" he asked,&#xD;
when the antique African was seated.&#xD;
"Pretty mis'able, thanks be to de Lord, Master&#xD;
Fred."&#xD;
"What's your misery, Uncle?"&#xD;
"On'y waiting' for de Lord to take his servant to&#xD;
hesef."&#xD;
"Do you want to die then ?"&#xD;
"Never, Master Fred., Lord bless 'your dear soul,&#xD;
never."&#xD;
"How old are you, new?"&#xD;
"Well, you can count it up. I seed Gin'al Wash-&#xD;
inton a crossing ' de' Delaware when I was seven or&#xD;
fifteen or along thai~, and I seed de ~hlack filly dey&#xD;
called Flora beat Colonel Dixon's hoss Thunder, but&#xD;
you know ef black Dick he had rid Thunder "..-.----..&#xD;
"Oh, I r~niember, Uncle. Do you get everything&#xD;
you want ~ Do the chaps wait on you' properly? Is&#xD;
your bed attended to, and your fire and everything ?"&#xD;
"Yes, everything, Master Fred., thank you. Dis&#xD;
mis'able oad nigger gits everything he wants till de&#xD;

"Very well, make them attend t~ you. Don't for-&#xD;

little longer I am going to have your pictui~e taken to&#xD;
be hung up beside my gra~dfathe~'s."&#xD;
"Your grandfather, he was de first Colonel Frede-&#xD;
rick. When he tuk me to de army i~or his body sar-&#xD;
vant, he rode de Engli~h hoss 2Rover, and when we&#xD;
come to de camp"-&#xD;
"Tell me about that to-morrow. Now come out&#xD;
here into the sunshine. Let me carry your stool for&#xD;
you. There-..good-bye."&#xD;
"Lord bless dat boy," said the old -man, as his&#xD;
'master rode away, "and bless old master, too; but&#xD;
h&amp;amp;s gone afore me long ago to Abram's bosom, thank&#xD;
de Lord for all His marches."&#xD;
At a later hour, and in another part of the pianta-&#xD;
Lation, the Colonel saw a negro fellow jtimp up from&#xD;
the ground where he had been lying on his back&#xD;
with his face turned to ihe, sun as duly as a sun-&#xD;
flower. He ran towards a gate through which his&#xD;
master was about to pass and held it open. lie was&#xD;
very black. His head and heels b6th stood out rear-&#xD;
ward ahuost as far as his hips, and his nose lay iii&#xD;
ambush behind his lips. An elaborate bow and a&#xD;
sheepish twinkle of his eyes denoted to the Colonel&#xD;
that Ben was waiting the~e to ask some favor.&#xD;
"Well, Ben,"he said when -he came to the gate,&#xD;
"what do you want?"&#xD;
"Nuffin, Master."&#xD;
"You do wa~t something; why can't you t~1l the&#xD;
truth.?'?&#xD;
- "Dat's it, Master," replied Ben with a grin, show-&#xD;
ing more red than white, "no nigger don't tell truth;&#xD;
on'y you's found Ben out, and you knoWs he lies."&#xD;
Ben giggled as if he relished his own satire, or would&#xD;
laugh hi8 master into favorable humor.&#xD;
&#xD;
RO]~BUCK.                 17&#xD;
"What do you want, Ben ?"&#xD;
"I bin a thinking , Master, maybe you'd like to soil&#xD;
this 'ere lazy, lyin' nigger."&#xD;
"Sell you! Do you want to be sold ?"&#xD;
"Yes, Master. I can't keep from lyin', an' I ain't&#xD;
good enough for you."&#xD;
"That's not your reason; but what master have&#xD;
you chosen ?"&#xD;
." Dar's Squire Anderson, maybe he mout buy me,&#xD;
'case he don't know much about me ?"&#xD;
"Tell me, Ben, why you wish to be sold? Are&#xD;
you, worked too hard t Are you not well treated?&#xD;
Has the oVerseer done anything to you ?"&#xD;
"No, Master, de God's truth is, it's jis my wife."&#xD;
"You want to get rid of Nancy?"&#xD;
"Dat's a fao'."&#xD;
"Why ?"&#xD;
"'Case she's done got religion; and I can't bide her&#xD;
no how."&#xD;
"When did she get religion, Ben ?"&#xD;
"She done voine through last Sunday night."&#xD;
"Religion should make her a better wife."&#xD;
"No, Master, beg your pardon, religion ain't good&#xD;
for nigger w men. She goes praying' and singin~and&#xD;
begin' among them religious fellers, aud when she&#xD;
comes home from de prayer-meetin's she goes a rollin'&#xD;
on de floor and kickin' up her heels, and~w~n't come&#xD;
to bed all night. She never gives me a good word&#xD;
no more, on'y poor sinner, poor sinner."&#xD;
"And what have you done ?"&#xD;
"I. done switch her two, three times, but de reli-&#xD;
gion ain't switched out of her yit. I can't stand it,&#xD;
Master, indeed I can't. 'l's ~feard I'll drow~i my~e'f,&#xD;

"You have your eye on another woman at Squire&#xD;

"Lord, Master, I have never spoke. to hi~ Jinfly,&#xD;
but once."&#xD;
"17 imderstand you, Ben. You are tired of one&#xD;
wife and want another. You are married to Nancy,&#xD;
and have two children. You must stay with her.&#xD;
You make religion an excuse to quarrel with her.&#xD;
You must treat her as a good husband ought, and&#xD;
she shall behave herself as a good wife. If you&#xD;
switch her again I'll direct the overseer to switch&#xD;
you. Go to* your work.' ]3egone !"&#xD;
Another police case came 'before the Colonel the&#xD;
same cay, that may be worth reporting, as the ~ub&#xD;
~ject of it will appear~again in this narrative. On this,&#xD;
occasion he came Ainning up from a ravine to inter~&#xD;
cept his master as he rode along. He was a tall feb&#xD;
l~w with a powerful frame and abullet-head. On his&#xD;
head he wore nothing but' a circular fringe of rav~&#xD;
elled straw which had been the rim, of a hat. Even&#xD;
this 'he. doffed as he approached his, master.&#xD;
What's the matter, Jubs V'&#xD;
"1'sjis gwine to find you, Master."&#xD;
"Where do you come from flow ?"&#xD;
"Fromde, bush, Master, dat's d~ trulh."&#xD;
"Jiow long )~aye you been in the bush 1"&#xD;
"Mighty nigh. on to three days."&#xD;
"Why did you run away, Juba ~"&#xD;
"'Case de overseer was gwine to whip me."&#xD;
"Didn't you deserve a whipping ~"&#xD;
"I reckon I did, Master, but I don't like to be&#xD;
whipped by dat overseer n~.o how. He's come o~' a&#xD;
mighty mean family of poor white "folks.aud he don't&#xD;
know JIQW 2t0 treat ~ggers."&#xD;
&#xD;
~OEh1UcK.                  10&#xD;
"You are impudent, Julia. Don't you think you&#xD;
ought to be whipped now ~"&#xD;
"Sartin I ought. But now, Master, would you jis&#xD;
please to switch me yourse'f......jis 'dis Once, Master."&#xD;
"No, Julia; go, ask the overseer to come here."&#xD;
He obeyed and soon returned with the overseer, a&#xD;
man not so tall as Julia, but of stout, athletic frame.'&#xD;
* "Mr. Higgs," said 'the 'colonel, "Julia confesses&#xD;
that he deserves to be punished and I wish him to&#xD;
know that you have my special authority and. request&#xD;
to punish him now. Please attend to his case: wJ~en&#xD;
you have time."&#xD;
"Now, Master, please whip me course'~ do; I'll&#xD;
fetch de switches."&#xD;
Juba ran away toward a wood and the colonel sup..&#xD;
posed he was taking to the bush again. But he was&#xD;
soon seen returning with an honest,~ bundle of&#xD;
switches in his hand. Whilehe was absent, the oLvej,..&#xD;
seer said:&#xD;
"Colonel Fairfax, it seems, useless 'to whip Juba~&#xD;
He is a strange fellow. I have had a great 'deal of&#xD;
trouble 'i~ith him, and have tried every way I 'could&#xD;
think of to manage him. He is a capitall hand to&#xD;
work when he 'is         Lunor, but he paysf~ no&#xD;
respect to my authority. He is very p~oud of his&#xD;
strength, and 'sometimes looks at ~me as if he was&#xD;
thinking that he is a bdter man than I am. One&#xD;
more plan to bring him to subjection has occurred to&#xD;
me, 'and, if you. ~have no objection, I will try it on&#xD;
him."&#xD;
"What is it ~"&#xD;
"For me l~o. flght him on equal terms and whip&#xD;
him. That wilt take the conceit out~ofbj~ and make&#xD;
him respect me."&#xD;
&#xD;

20              IIOE]3UCIC.&#xD;
&#xD;
-i&#xD;
&#xD;
"That will never do, Mr. Higgs."&#xD;
"I believe nothing else' will do with Juba."&#xD;
"If there were -no other objection, he might beat&#xD;
you.~,&#xD;
"Then you will have to get another overseer. I am&#xD;
willing to take the risk, if you consent. I was once&#xD;
active and had some skill at boxing. I am older now&#xD;
and out of practice. But I'll risk it."&#xD;
The colonel, shook his head doubtfully at this novel&#xD;
proposition, but Juba crime up and he merely said,&#xD;
"go with the overseer" as he rode away.&#xD;
"Now, Juba," said Higgs, "lay down the switches.&#xD;
You wiW need your fists. You must fight me. I&#xD;
give you a white man's chance. It's a fair fight."&#xD;
"Fa'r fight ~ White man's chance '~ Sure enough s?"&#xD;
"Yes, that's what I say.'~&#xD;
"Whoop 1" shouted Juba so loud that he was&#xD;
heard by some of his fellow-servants in a neighbor-&#xD;
ing field, and, leaning on their hoes, they became&#xD;
spectators of the scene.&#xD;
"Get ready, Juba."&#xD;
"l's always ready for a fa~r fight."&#xD;
"'Come-on, then."&#xD;
Juba was not slow to act upon this hint. He made&#xD;
a lunge with his great maul of a fist a~ the overseer's&#xD;
face, and would have flattened his features if the blow&#xD;
had not -been dexterously parried. Juba opened his&#xD;
eyes with wonder to see that so much force had done&#xD;
no mischief. He repeated the effort several times&#xD;
with little variation and with no better ~uccess. Then&#xD;
the overseer in turn began tp plant his plows. lie&#xD;
struck Juba on the head-his least vulnerable part-&#xD;
and Juba fell flat on the grass. He rose and -came to&#xD;
the scratch again, but almost instantly he zneasured&#xD;
&#xD;
ROEBU~CK.                 21&#xD;
his length upon the ground. He took a third fall, but&#xD;
then, when he rose, he turned his back upon his&#xD;
adversary and took to his heels. He did not stop&#xD;
until he joined the laborers in the adjoining field.&#xD;
He there seized a hoe and went to work without&#xD;
saying a word. After a long time he looked round&#xD;
and said with a rueful grin:&#xD;
"Dat ain't such a mean overseer after all; I reckon&#xD;
his folks&#xD;
In the is pretty decent for poor white folks."&#xD;
meantime Colonel Fairfaic passed into a field&#xD;
where a dozen slaves were at work under the lead of&#xD;
one of their own class, who acted as headman of the&#xD;
gang. He was a co~emporary of the cok~nel, and&#xD;
they had played together, -and sometimes fought too,&#xD;
irhen they were boys. As he remained a boy all his&#xD;
life, and would have protracted also the boyhood of&#xD;
his master, he continued to call him "Master Fred."&#xD;
His nose was like a pack-saddle. He was short, and&#xD;
though not corpulent, his head, face, body and limbs&#xD;
were afl round, and his plump little figure might have&#xD;
been rolled about like a ball. He was called Joe.&#xD;
With the bland serenity of ancient and undisputed&#xD;
authority, he led a bevy of sleek, well-fed negroes,&#xD;
who whistled or sung at their labor, quite satisfied&#xD;
with their prospective share of the products of the&#xD;
plantation. When the colonel approached Joe, took&#xD;
off his hat and saluted him with a grave bow, saying,&#xD;
"yo'ur servant, Master Fred."&#xD;
"How goes it, Joe, and how do you get on with&#xD;
the work to-day ?"&#xD;
"Mighty well, sir; de boys is working' up lively to-&#xD;
day, lively, Master Fred. But I bin thinking , sir,&#xD;
maybe you'd allow old Joe to presss his 'pinion on&#xD;
dis 'ere corn-plantin' subjee'."&#xD;

&#xD;
"Certainly, Joe, I would like to hear your&#xD;
opinion."&#xD;
"Den, Master Fred, my 'pinion 'is dat dis 'e~'e way&#xD;
of planting' corn, what the overseer is gwine to make&#xD;
us plant corn, is a new way, and it ain't the way the&#xD;
Fairfaxes always planted corn, and my 'pinion is, sir,&#xD;
we won't git no crap."&#xD;
"Then, Joe," replied his master, laughing, "you&#xD;
think we ought to plant corn still just a~ the Fair-&#xD;
faxes did 'when you were a chap 'P'&#xD;
"Well, my 'pinion is, Master Fred, dat a family as&#xD;
old as ourn oughtn't to take up with these new ways&#xD;
of the upstarts-no offence to the overseer, sir."&#xD;
"The Fairfaxes," said the colonel, laughing again,&#xD;
"were always a very good family, Joe, since you and&#xD;
I knew them, and in the ways of honor and duty we&#xD;
cannot do better than follow their examples. But as&#xD;
to planting, perhaps we may learn something by ex-&#xD;
perience which they' did not know. The fact is, this&#xD;
new way is one of my own, Joe."&#xD;
"Oh, dat's another thing,. Master Fred. You's one&#xD;
of the same old Fairfaxes yours&amp;amp;f, and you has a&#xD;
right to think for yourself and for your folks too.&#xD;
I's got no 'pinion on dat subjee' of it's your subject ,&#xD;
sir."&#xD;
The colonel was about to ride away, when Joe sig-&#xD;
nified by a respectful gesture that he had something&#xD;
more to say.&#xD;
"What else, Joe ~" he asked.&#xD;
"One of my gang-it's roundhead Bill-says he's&#xD;
got~two children over his patch, Master Fred, and he&#xD;
wants, ef you please, to git his patch made up to his&#xD;
family."&#xD;
"Is tl~at so, Bill ?"&#xD;
&#xD;
23&#xD;
"Yes, Master, I done got two 'sponsibiities Since&#xD;
you give dat patch, and I most 'spectin' another."&#xD;
"Very well, Bill; your patch shall be enlarged to&#xD;
fit your responsibilities~~&#xD;
"Thank you, Master," said roundhead Bill,&#xD;
"Bill is a mighty good boy, Master Fred," added&#xD;
I-Ieadman Joe; "he's worth twelve hundred dollars&#xD;
dis blessed day; dat is, ef you was a gentleman would&#xD;
sell a servant while he behaves hese'f."&#xD;
When lie had moved away, the colonel saW a&#xD;
young lady riding at a canter across th~e fields&#xD;
towards him on a white horse of high spirit and&#xD;
beautiful form. She was* followed by a gentleman&#xD;
who, in turn, was followed by a servant. "There,"&#xD;
said the colonel to hirnselg "comes Julia, worrying&#xD;
her Uncle Dick with a gallop over plowed ground."&#xD;
He gazed at her with affectionate pride, and his&#xD;
cheertlil face beamed with a smile. "What are you&#xD;
after, brother Dick ?" he exclaimed, as they drew&#xD;
fear.&#xD;
"After Qolonel Julia, of course. She would niake&#xD;
a cavalry raid on the village this morning, and I had&#xD;
to follow my colonel."&#xD;
It was one of his whims to caU her coloneL,', as the&#xD;
destined heir of an estate which should always have&#xD;
a Colonel Frederick for its proprietor, 'according to&#xD;
the citstomary law of descent in the family. In de-&#xD;
f~i~iIt of a Colonel Frederick, he dubbed the niece&#xD;
~honi lie admired and loved, "Colonel Julia."&#xD;
"Papa," she said, "your big brother and I have&#xD;
COIui~ to take you home. We think you have done&#xD;
work enough while we wore at play. Unele Dick&#xD;
says ho intends to prea~,Ix up a new abolition society&#xD;

"Certainly," the doctor added, "the masters are&#xD;
the real objects of compassion in this peculiar institu-&#xD;

an apostle of emancipatiOn, and be the first of the&#xD;
wretches I am to rescue."&#xD;
"What, brother Dick," said the colouel,  ' have&#xD;
you done with your old theory that the negroes have&#xD;
the natural right to~ be slaves and therefore to have&#xD;
masters, servitude being necessary, as you have often&#xD;
affirmed, for their pre~ervatiOn and happiness accord-&#xD;

"I have thrown up the constitution of nature and.&#xD;
taken to abQlltionist tracts. But I improve on the&#xD;
plan of the abolitionists. I am convinced that the&#xD;

"Pray, ~hat is to be this grand result ?"&#xD;
"The extinction of the negro race on this con~&#xD;

"That is desirable, is it ?" said the colonel, laugh-&#xD;
ing.&#xD;
"Root out the blacks and you know we shall have&#xD;
a more intelligent and profitable set of laborers."&#xD;
"But humanity, my big brother 1"&#xD;
"Nonsense, my little brother! Humanity was in&#xD;
last year's almanac. It is out of date. Abolition&#xD;
takes its place this year. Free the negroes! Perish&#xD;

What will a humanitarian society~l.uimaiiitarial1.&#xD;
mark you, not humane-be worth unless it turns the&#xD;
world topsy-turvy and makes women perform the&#xD;
functions of men ?"&#xD;
~~Will you emancipate me without my wife ?"&#xD;
asked the Colonel. "She is a greater slave to our&#xD;

"No; it is useless to offer freedom to women.&#xD;
They all rush into matrimony, the most galling kind&#xD;
of bondage. Let them alone."&#xD;
"Begone, you heathen," said Julia, flourishing her&#xD;
riding-switch.&#xD;
"Yes, I am a heathen and a republican~I confess&#xD;
all my sins at once. Ostentatious confession is a trick&#xD;
of the Pharisees whom I am going to imitate. It is&#xD;

"Unless they run away."&#xD;
"Well, if they run away from their homes we must&#xD;

"Same as you, Master Dick ?" said Dave with an&#xD;
impudent leer in his eyes, sheltered by the, projecting&#xD;
gravity of his lips. The doctor rode at him ~jth a&#xD;
threatening gesture and Dave rapidly receded from&#xD;
the scene.&#xD;
"Yes, Julia,'~ said the doctor, "there's your own&#xD;
maid, Grace, you make a fool of her too with your&#xD;
indulgence and. your presents and finery and all that."&#xD;
"But, Uncle Dick, she loves me so truly and then&#xD;
we were play-mates in childhood, you know. She is&#xD;
really a good girl and altogether devoted to me."&#xD;
"Fudge! She will run away the first time she has&#xD;

turning towards the servant who followed Doctor&#xD;
Fairfax, and who now sat in stately fashion on his&#xD;
horse near them. lie was dressed quite foppishly,&#xD;

nounced his opinions&#xD;
"Miss Julia, when extremes meet, the ebullition of&#xD;

Caleb, accepting the praise as customary ~in~1 w1~'.&#xD;

"Master, if you would investio'ate the collateral in.&#xD;

CHAPTER III.&#xD;
vs ITOUS ATs UraOm BUeK.&#xD;
* FoM he ounryroad or highway a broad avenueo&#xD;
hnof atmie inontyh led up to a gate below the bluff&#xD;
inlfron  ofl inen mansion of Roebuck. -On each&#xD;
sdofthe avenue was a row of lombardy poplars--&#xD;
tall, ointd steele-like frees, but already stricken at&#xD;
tolp ith that early decay which afflicts those aspiring&#xD;
frtesof the last generation. When Julia touched&#xD;
Aavorith her switch two young gentlemen were .&#xD;
meeting at the entrance of the avenue.&#xD;
" Good morning, Mr. Pahnar.".&#xD;
"Goo  moringMr. Fitzhugh."&#xD;
At tGoesad moment they turned the heads of their&#xD;
Atorses ade together between the poPlars. At&#xD;
hrsetheydtalked of the weather, their horses and other&#xD;
tirttey  trval matters, and, while their conversation&#xD;
ite unortant, there will be time to describe them.&#xD;
Theynimre about the same age, of twenty-six or&#xD;
Thsevey andwere both handsome and tall; but Fit-&#xD;
even, was not quite as tall as his companion ;. the for-&#xD;
mnrhad dark hair, eyes and complexion, and those of'&#xD;
thmter  wer liht. The dress of Palmer was faxsh-&#xD;
ioae land werecise;I that of Fitzhugh genteel but&#xD;
nglent Ashorsemanship is 'the passion of all&#xD;
clein Virginia, but especially of gentlemen, they&#xD;
were boh well mounted.- The horse of the dark-&#xD;
haired rider was black,. of moderate size and evidently&#xD;

&#xD;
of fine blood, while he of the fair complexion rode a&#xD;
.stouter animal of chesnut color. Palmer's features&#xD;
were exactly regular and without an apparent blemish,&#xD;
except that his light blue eyes displayed rather too&#xD;
much white. They expressed no decided character,&#xD;
and even the doubtful negation of expression might&#xD;
signify either apathy or prudence, and his face might&#xD;
be a mask or a mirror. That of Fitzhugh was less&#xD;
rgular and more flexible in feature and it was more&#xD;
responsive to mind and heart. Its Jhabitual express&#xD;
sion was one of dreamy idleness. But it caught the&#xD;
change of every passing influence so readily that a&#xD;
stranger might have suspected his character of levity&#xD;
if another nature more profound had not been indi-&#xD;
cated by the breadth of his forehead, the depth of the&#xD;
eyes and therm lines of the .mouth.&#xD;
"There goes Miss Fairfax towards the house," said'&#xD;
Paler&#xD;
"And her uncle with her," added Fitzhugh.&#xD;
" But he shall not assist her to alight. I[intend to&#xD;
perform that service myself.&#xD;
" If you are at the house before me, you may."&#xD;
" Agreed."&#xD;
" Show him youi heels, Sultan," said Fitzhugh, and,&#xD;
at a touch of The cane, his horse bounded away.&#xD;
Palmer also, humoring the banter, put . spurs to the&#xD;
chestnut. If they were seen ~it all by Julia and her&#xD;
uncle, they were soon out of sight as they approached&#xD;
the bluff. For a short race there was not much differ-&#xD;
ence in speed between. the horses, but the black held&#xD;
the start he had taken. .As no personwas seen' at* the&#xD;
gate,it appeard that the necessity of stopping to&#xD;
open it would end the race and set the riders even.&#xD;
But from each side of the gate ran a stone wall or&#xD;

fence, about four feet high. Fitzhugh, swerving his&#xD;
horse from the middle of the road to the sward at the&#xD;
side, came up t6 the fence andSultan cleared it at a&#xD;
~leap. Palmer declined to follow, and his companion&#xD;
halting, turned and waved his hand with a good-.&#xD;
humored laugh. He waited for Palmer to pass&#xD;
through the gate and then they rode together up the&#xD;
bluff. Miss Fairfax had already dismounted and was&#xD;
not to be seen. The gentlemen, giving their bridles&#xD;
to a servant, entered the house. They had not sat&#xD;
long when the young lady made her appearance.&#xD;
For some niinutes the cost of the conversation was&#xD;
defrayed almost exclusively by herself. The thoughts&#xD;
of her visitors were so engrossed with admiration of&#xD;
her beauty that they talked but little. They had often&#xD;
seen her before. Fitzhugh had known her from her&#xD;
infancy. His family and hers had long been neigh-&#xD;
bors and intimate friends. The acquaintance between&#xD;
her and Palmer was ~of some years' standing, though&#xD;
it was little more than formal. Neither of the gin-&#xD;
tlemen professed a warmer feeling for her than friend-&#xD;
ship; but, in her presence, they felt the fascination of&#xD;
a kind of beauty alWays new and surprising. At&#xD;
length they found their tongues and for half an hour the&#xD;
conyersatiOfl flowed fluently enough. They talked of&#xD;
neighborhood news, recent publications, new music&#xD;
and a variety of other topics of transient interest.&#xD;
Julia had the pleasing talent of her sex, and her con~&#xD;
versation, like her dress and manners, had the unobtru-&#xD;
sive charm of simple elegance. Not fronv any parade&#xD;
of.l~arning or accomplishments could it be discovered&#xD;
that her education had been as complete as wealth&#xD;
could procure for her.. She had received also that&#xD;
better education which girls acquired in those happy&#xD;
&#xD;
31&#xD;
&#xD;
homes in Virginia (happy now no more!) where gem-&#xD;
tie manners were framed to. modesty and purity, and&#xD;
where characters were attempered to the duties of&#xD;
life. Palmer, in conversation, was sensible but for-&#xD;
mal. lit was apparent that his moderate faculties had&#xD;
been carefully cultivated in schools,. He was versed&#xD;
in the fashions and affected the manners of cities.&#xD;
His imag~ation was dull and he lacked the versatile&#xD;
and various ease of an agreeable talker. . In that re-&#xD;
spect ho was excelled by Fitzhugh when he was in&#xD;
his lighter mood and was excited by congenial com-&#xD;
pany.&#xD;
Julia, being requested to sing, sat at the piano and&#xD;
sung an Italian song with brilliant operatic music, at&#xD;
the desire of Palmei~, whose musical task had re-&#xD;
ceived as elaborate culture as his intellect; and then&#xD;
she sufig an English b~lad to gratify Fitzhugh, who&#xD;
was an enthusiastic lover of melody, but without&#xD;
much musical science. Her skill satisfied the judg-&#xD;
ment of the critic, and her sweet voice thrilled the&#xD;
nerves of the enthusiast. One of the gentlemen then&#xD;
requested her to sing something of her owi~selection.&#xD;
"Then hearken," she said, "for I am going to sing&#xD;
you a song with a moral~-a homely little son~g that&#xD;
was sent to me the other day." Whether she took&#xD;
it up by accident, or chose to amuse herself with the&#xD;
part of a playful moralist, or was influenced by some&#xD;
thought of Fitzhugh, who was settling into an atti-&#xD;
tude of indolent di'eaiuing, may have been uncertain&#xD;
to herself~ She esteemed Hugh Fitzhugh very&#xD;
highly, and treated him with as much. familiarity as&#xD;
life-long, friendship might Warrant . between young&#xD;
persons of different sexes. She shared the regret of&#xD;
his friends that, after leaving the University with a&#xD;

brilliant reputation, and traveling in Europe a year&#xD;
or two, he seemed to have given himself up to list-&#xD;
less id1en~ss. Not even the estate which he inherited,&#xD;
and on y~hich he resided with his widowed mother,&#xD;
appeared to engage his serious attention. 5ulia often&#xD;
heard her father express a fear that the ..bright pro-&#xD;
mise whith his young friend Hugh had given would&#xD;
be disappointed through~1, mere indolence and a love&#xD;
of idle pleasur~S. Whether she remembered this or&#xD;
not at the moment, she sung her song "with a&#xD;
moral "-&#xD;

"Does it please you ?" asked ~iiss Fairfax.&#xD;
"The moral, not the music, was meant for me.'~&#xD;
"Do you suspect me, then, of preaching to y~u or&#xD;
at you?"&#xD;
"Perhaps it may turn out a song,&#xD;
Perhaps turn out a sermon."&#xD;
~ And why do y~ou take it as a serihon rather than&#xD;
as a song ?"&#xD;
"I will think of it," he said, musingly.&#xD;
"Do, Mr. Fitzhugh," she replied, in a tone which&#xD;
seemed at once to apologize for 1~he candor of her&#xD;
Sermon, and to insinuate au interest in his career.&#xD;
"I wish so fUr a preacher would level a sermoti at&#xD;
me,' said Alfred Palmer.&#xD;
"If I am suspected of such presumption I must&#xD;
nevef transgress again, Mr. Palmer~ flut here comes&#xD;
I~pa-and Uncle Dick with him, too. Between&#xD;
them they shall teach you all wisdom, whether the&#xD;
amiable or the satirical."&#xD;
Colonel Fairfax n3et the young gentlemen wit~h a&#xD;
hearty greeting, and the doctor said, "Brother Fred&#xD;
and I have just had a pretty quarrel about the com-&#xD;
parative merits of your horses; gentlemen; take care&#xD;
that we don't finish it over you."&#xD;
"You must not call it a quarrel," said the colonel.&#xD;
"Well, a discussion..the milder synonym."&#xD;
"I would like to show the gentlemen a horse of'&#xD;
mine ;" and the colonel was about to dilate' upon&#xD;
horseflesh, for it was one of his vanities, and the&#xD;
number of fin~e horses on the plant~ti~n formed one&#xD;

exception to the judicious economy of his manage-.&#xD;
ment. But he checked himself, and, gliding with.&#xD;
easy urbanity to a more appropriate subject, he led&#xD;
th~ way in an animated conversation, to which all&#xD;
present contributed. Julia, who always showed most&#xD;
vivacity in the presence of her amiable and cheerful&#xD;
father, talked with sparkling gaiety; the guests imi-&#xD;
tated her vivacity, and Doctor Dick let off' som3&#xD;
squibs at intervals. Colonel Fairfax was fond of the&#xD;
society of young people, and they enjoyed his frank,&#xD;
entertaining and intelligent conversation. The young&#xD;
men of his acquaintance loved him, and admired his~&#xD;
character. hugh Fitzhugh had been accustomedd.&#xD;
from boyhood to look upon him as his best friend,&#xD;
almost as a guardian. His mother, left a widow with&#xD;
no other child when Hugh was very young, was his&#xD;
legal guardian, but Colonel Fairfax was her constant&#xD;
adviser. Albert Palmer was born in New England,&#xD;
and, though he had lived a great part of his life in&#xD;
Virginia, had no intimate acquaintance with the Lam-.&#xD;
ily at Roebuck.&#xD;
At length the current of conversation was interrupt-.&#xD;
ed by Doctor Fairfax, who remarked abruptly, "that&#xD;
is a Yankee horse you ride, Mr. Palmer-a Yankee&#xD;
Morgan."&#xD;
"You would not, imply," said Julia, "that he is&#xD;
the worse for a Northern origin, Uncle ]Mck.".&#xD;
"By no means; I like the Yankee-bred Morgans."&#xD;
But the irritation of sectional controversy had made&#xD;
men sensitive to every comparison between the North&#xD;
and the South, and the most inoffensive allusions&#xD;
'would sometimes rub the raw and. provoke resent-&#xD;
ment. Palmer had certain reasons for being more&#xD;
sensitive than others when lie suspected that a slight&#xD;

ftOBBUCX.                  35&#xD;
was east upon his Northern birth, and the abrupt&#xD;
manner of the doctor, which. startled even Julia, had&#xD;
irritated him. 'He said with asperity: "you are mis-&#xD;
taken, sir. I am a true Southerner. I use nothing&#xD;
from Yankeedom that I can obtain in the South. In&#xD;
fact," he added with a rising voice&#xD;
Yankees."                      , I despise the&#xD;
There was silence, for all present were shocked and&#xD;
embarrassed. Virginians cherish the love of native-&#xD;
land with romantic fidelity. They could tolerate, in,&#xD;
stranger the utmost devotion to the country of his&#xD;
birth, though it might be the country they most dis-&#xD;
liked. They could 'not comprehend the contempt&#xD;
expressed by Palmer for the land of his nativity and&#xD;
the people of his blood. . After an awkward pause the&#xD;
doctor, who delighted to abuse the "Yankees," iroke&#xD;
the silence.&#xD;
"Wcil, since the Yankees have no friends here, I&#xD;
~ will air my opinions of them."&#xD;
"Come, Uncle iDick,.be charitable. We know you&#xD;
keep the North as a woman keeps. a pin-cushion, to&#xD;
stick pins in."&#xD;
"Acer te1igi~, Colonel Julia, which, being inter..&#xD;
~reted, signifies that you are as sharp as one of your&#xD;
needles this morning. But I'll.balk your penetration&#xD;
this time. I shall use none but a blunt instrument-...-.&#xD;

credo is a long face on Sunday and a long purse on&#xD;
week days. Their w~er of baptism is water of pe-&#xD;
trifaction, turning their hearts .t~ stone. Look at&#xD;
those three thousand preachers who petitioned Con-&#xD;
gre~s recently-their petition was a howl of hate&#xD;
against the South. When they stretch out their holy&#xD;
hands over this half of the country, their benedictions&#xD;
are bans and their very halleluiah is a doxology of&#xD;
devils. ' They have almost canonized the bones of old&#xD;
'John Brown, a robber and assassin, because they were&#xD;

the end of the world 'is at hand, and they confirm&#xD;
their predictions by citing the unparalleled, depravity&#xD;
of mankind-~a depravity which they actually see at&#xD;
their own doors, though it is not seen in the South."&#xD;
"But, brother Dick," interrupted the colonel,&#xD;
"those are only their fanatics whom you describe. '~&#xD;
They drown the voices of all others. And then&#xD;
Yankee politics-~-a corrupt despotism o  demagogues&#xD;
-professing but one 'principle, the rule "of a nThjority,&#xD;
and practicing but one, public plunder. Fanaticism,&#xD;
however,' will soon dominate, politics. Already most&#xD;
of the religious~ societies there are political clubs.&#xD;
Priests are sure to be the tyrants of a land where'&#xD;
pure religion does not pre~rail."&#xD;
"The spirit of caricature runs away with my big&#xD;
brother to-day," said Colonel2~airf~x, laughing.&#xD;
"Caricature! What I say is as true as daguerreo-&#xD;
type."&#xD;
"And not more life-like, I dare say, Uncle Dick."&#xD;
"Julie, a good girl like you cannot imagine such&#xD;
&#xD;
evils ns pollute Northern society. Their cities are&#xD;
sinks, their towns ape their cities and they poison the&#xD;
country. They abound with haunts where men have&#xD;
exerted their ingenuity in perfecting vice as they have&#xD;
elsewhere in improving machinery. What is their&#xD;

Hold, there, brother ])ick, you won't say there.&#xD;
are no gentlemen in. the North," cried the colonel,&#xD;
laughing at the doctor's notions.&#xD;
"Gentlemen.-..yes, many of them, as there are&#xD;
many good Christians. But there is no class of gen~&#xD;
try with a recognized position and influence. Here,&#xD;
you know, the gentry, rich a poor; without the&#xD;
support of unequal laws, exert a direct and legitimate&#xD;
influence upon the movements of society with the&#xD;
open approbation of the people, and with open re-&#xD;
spon~ibi1ity, under the correction of' public opinion.&#xD;
'There, gentry is ostracised. Wealth, everywhere a&#xD;
power, rules there by indirection an4 eorrtiption. It&#xD;
buys the press. It subsidizes&#xD;

fanaticism is quiet, the force that rules ~&#xD;

be no gentry, where nothing is stable, and gold is&#xD;

Fitzhugh accepted the invitation, but Palmer, with&#xD;
a polite apology, declined. it, and took his leave.&#xD;
When the conversation was resumed, Fitzhugh&#xD;
said..-..&#xD;

would link Virginia with States that must fail her&#xD;
in a long and exhau'~tive war. One of them h~s a&#xD;
gentry and no people; another, a people and no gen-&#xD;
try, and a third, neither people nor gentry-~neither&#xD;
body nor spirit. The very vices of the Yankees will&#xD;
contribute~to their cruel success in such an enter-&#xD;
prise as the conquest and plunder of the South.&#xD;
~ Think you I wo~mld provoke a horde of Northern bar..&#xD;
barians to overrun Virginia with fire and sword ?"&#xD;
"Shall we, then, submit to oppression through&#xD;
fear? The Northern States,, as you have descrlli~d&#xD;
them, are unfit associates of a Commonwealth like&#xD;
Virginia. They have repeatedly nullified the laws,&#xD;
and broken the Federal compact in points essential&#xD;
to our security. Ey a perversion of constitutional&#xD;
forms they have seized the common government with&#xD;
an avowed. design of wresting its tremendous powers&#xD;
to their aggrandizement and our oppression. The&#xD;
wrongs they have perpetrated would justify wai~-&#xD;
much more simple separation. The danger that we&#xD;
shall lose all the rights of our States if we acquiesce&#xD;

&#xD;
in their aggressions is manifest and imminent.' There&#xD;
appears to be no way of escape from it, but by seces-&#xD;
sion. The right of secession is clear. The right of&#xD;
self-government is inalienable. By 'seceding, we&#xD;
shall give no just cause of war. I hope war will not&#xD;
come. If it should come, I 'believe the South will&#xD;
not be conquered. But, whatever may be the pos~&#xD;
sible event, it is better in such a cause to invoke the&#xD;
justice of the E~od of Battles, than tamely to await&#xD;
our inevitable doom in the Union."&#xD;
Fitzhugh had risen, and. while he' spoke his eyes&#xD;
beamed. with enthusiasm, and his rich, mellow voice,&#xD;
swelled into a tone rather too oratorical for private&#xD;
conversation. Suddenly becoming conscious of this,&#xD;
he paused and turning to Julia said-" pardon me,&#xD;
Miss Julia, I am making a speech."&#xD;
"It is easy to pardon the warm expression of patri-&#xD;
otic feeling," she replied.&#xD;
"Ah, Hugh," observed Colonel Fairfax, "you agi-&#xD;
tate a perilous question, that requires for its solution&#xD;
eminent wisdom and~sobriety of judgment. A young&#xD;
gentleman of your spirTh and principles naturally&#xD;
feels indignant at the wrongs and insults which our&#xD;
States have suffered from a portion of the Northern&#xD;
people, and alarmed at the danger which threatens us&#xD;
from that quarter. The anrnsing caricatures of&#xD;
Northern society which have' been sketched by my&#xD;
brother are not withoi4 a partial resemblance to truth.&#xD;
'I do uot doubt the ri~tft of secession, and I regard it'&#xD;
as the only effectual check 'upon the Federal govern-&#xD;
ment whenever it shall become-.--as all ~governments&#xD;
are liable to become-dangerous to 'liberty. l3ut this&#xD;
is not our whole case. Is it necessary 6r wise to&#xD;
secede now? Will secession cure the ills we suffer or&#xD;
&#xD;
ROEBUCK,                   41&#xD;
avert the dangers we fear? Is there no remedy within&#xD;
the Union? Shall we relinquish all the advantages of&#xD;
the Union without further efforts to preserve it while&#xD;
.saving also our rights, honor and security? The Union&#xD;
is very dear to me. I have been taught to lov.e it from&#xD;
my cradle upward. As Virginians, we should cherish&#xD;
it as especially the work of our fathers and the monu-&#xD;
ment of their glory. Secession may not bring war&#xD;
but war is probable. Subjugation may follow with&#xD;
its train of' indescribable horrors. War at best-.-ci'vil&#xD;
war above all-.is terrible. Let us not be rash. Let&#xD;
us confide a little longer in the returning reason of&#xD;
our Northern brethren. Let us look an'd wait for&#xD;
some milder remedy than secession. Let us, ~f pos-&#xD;
sible, preserve this great country entire and not afflict&#xD;
mankind with the destruction of our Union."&#xD;
"Ought Virginia, then,?' inquired Hugh Pitzhugh,&#xD;
"from timidfty or sentimental recollections to lag&#xD;
behind her sister States in the assertion of right.-.in&#xD;
a contest for independence and freedom ?"&#xD;
"Prudence, my dear sir, is not dishonorable;&#xD;
neither is reluctance to abandoii a system which has -&#xD;
produced vast benefits. I have no fear that our ven-&#xD;
erable Commonx~realth will ever be dishonored by any&#xD;
act of her own. If she shoiild-...as I trust she may~&#xD;
restore to the Union the seven States which have&#xD;
seceded, and, at the same time, secure the rights of&#xD;
a11 for the future, that will be a work worthy of her&#xD;
ancient renown."&#xD;
"But will tiie fierce passions of the North permit it&#xD;
to be done ?"&#xD;
"Forbearance, statesmanship, and patient, persever-&#xD;
ing effort must prove whether it is possible. At all&#xD;
events, I shudder at the thought of breaking up the&#xD;

"But suppose, Colonel Fairfax, that while. Virginia&#xD;
is endeavoring to restore the integrity of the Union,&#xD;
the Federal government should attempt to reduce the&#xD;
seceding States .to obedience by force ~&#xD;
"Then we must fight. An attempt to subjugate*&#xD;
those States by arms after what has happened will I&#xD;
annul all claims of the Federal government upon the&#xD;
support of any Virginian or any friend of Republican&#xD;
liberty. I4iberty cannot survive a triumph of Fede-&#xD;
ral force in such a contest. No State can be neutral.&#xD;
If the North constrains Virginia to fight for or against&#xD;
the South, she must fight fQr the South at every haz-&#xD;
ard. Then secession will become a secondary ques-&#xD;
tion. War will be the first. We cannot aid in the&#xD;
subjugation of our sister States."&#xD;

CHAPTER IV.&#xD;
TABLE~TALK AT ROEBUCK.&#xD;
THE carriage returned, bringing the Rev. Charles&#xD;
Ambler. lie. was nearly fourscore years~f age. His&#xD;
hair was white~ and his appearance venerable, but his&#xD;
foi~m was erect and his step firm. His keen grey&#xD;
eyes, dimmed but not bleared by age, his aquiline&#xD;
nose and his si~piare chin expressed decision of char-&#xD;
acter, and saved his mild demeanor from a. charge of&#xD;
apathetic dullness. In early life he was a successful&#xD;
lawyer. Then he served as a captain of volunteers in&#xD;
the 1a~t war with EngJand. Afterwards, from con-&#xD;
scientious motiV~s, he became a student of divinity,&#xD;
and, in due time, a minister of the gospel. For more&#xD;
than forty years his life as a clergyman was one of&#xD;
apostolic poverty, of active usefLil~,e~ and modest&#xD;
godliness. He shunned the san6~imonious affecta-&#xD;
tions by which some preachers advertise themselves&#xD;
as ready~made saints. His goodness became known&#xD;
by its fruits.&#xD;
Soon after he had been received with respectful&#xD;
stationn by Colonel Fairfax, and the other persons&#xD;
present h~d exchanged greetings with him, Mrs.&#xD;
Fairfax joined the company. After expressing to&#xD;
the clergyman her pleasure at his visit, she said-&#xD;
"Julia tells me that you would hardly leave your gar-&#xD;
den to dine with us."&#xD;
"I confess, my dear madam," he replied,. "I was&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb  n="44-45" xml:id="VAC7684-00000023"/>&#xD;
44              ROEBUCK..&#xD;
a&#xD;
inclined to linger among my plants and flower-beds&#xD;
this fine spring day if I could have resisted the fair&#xD;
Julia. But, you know, from the beginning the&#xD;
woman has had a knack of turning the man out of&#xD;
the garden."&#xD;
"When I tempted you with mamma's dinner," said&#xD;
Julia, '4 felt sure that you were well acquainted with&#xD;
the wa~ back to Paradise."&#xD;
"I see," said the doctor, "'it is now as it was ~of&#xD;
old-the man lays the blame on the woman."&#xD;
"And the story runs," replied Mr. 'Ambler, laugh~&#xD;
ing, "that you, doctor, are more impartial, and lay&#xD;
blame on everybody."&#xD;
"My big brother was fairly hit then," said the&#xD;
colonel.&#xD;
"What! Have I the character of a common&#xD;
scold ~ I willreform forthwith, under the rebuke of&#xD;
my pastor."&#xD;
"Nay, brother Dick," said Mrs. Fairfax, "that&#xD;
character is one which your gallant sex assigns to&#xD;
ours exclusively."&#xD;
"But that, I maintain, is a slander," cried Hugh&#xD;
Fitzhugh.&#xD;
"You shall be the favored champion of dames and&#xD;
damsels," said Julia.&#xD;
"When I have learned the lesson of the bee ?"&#xD;
"Forgive me; I did not think the bee could leave&#xD;
a sting. I see to-day that you anticipate stirring&#xD;
times, and your soul is already stirred."&#xD;
"I would notbe idle when my native State is in&#xD;
danger."&#xD;
After some further conversation dinner was an-&#xD;
~ bounced. The good cheer and generous hospitality&#xD;
of Virginians are proverbial. Of course, they were&#xD;
&#xD;
ROEI3IYOIC.                45&#xD;
not dishonored by the Fairfaxes of Roebuck. The&#xD;
table exhibited the tempting abundance common&#xD;
to the country, and a costly elegance peculiar ~to the&#xD;
rich. Colonel Fairfax was an observer of all gene-&#xD;
rous usages, and considered the honor of his family&#xD;
engaged to excel in hospitality. He valued the ~&#xD;
ver upon his table chiefly because the greater part of&#xD;
it had been upon the tables of his ancestors. He was&#xD;
himself temperate in all things, but he dined with a&#xD;
healthy. appetite, stimulated by active employment,&#xD;
and he took his wine, not exclusively for the&#xD;
stomach's sake; but to make glad the heart. So far&#xD;
was he from moroseness, that he thought pleasure to&#xD;
be the playmate of virtue, though excess is the hand-&#xD;
maid of vice.&#xD;
When Iho vi~tTh cea~zd t~ hold the first place in&#xD;
the attention of the company, and conversation be-&#xD;
gan to range, a remark of Mrs. Fairfax gave occasion&#xD;
to some reflections of Mr. Ambler upon the social&#xD;
condition, of Virginia. "I believe," he said, "there.&#xD;
is not a happier or better community. Nature has&#xD;
been bountiful to our people, but not prodigal; re-&#xD;
warding industry, but not dispensing with exertion;&#xD;
bestowing health, ~nd requiring vigor. Fortunate&#xD;
circumstances make agriculture our chief occupation,&#xD;
but also render commerce and the arts profitable to&#xD;
those who prefer them~ There is wealth enough for&#xD;
leisure to cultivate the higher faculties~ and yet even&#xD;
the rich among us are incited to lead active lives un-&#xD;
der the open sky. Property is so. diffused that the&#xD;
scale is gradual from the richest to the poorest. Even -&#xD;
the poorest sddom turn beggars. or thieves, for., pov-&#xD;
erty here is neither extreme nor hopeless. Content-&#xD;
ment is almost universal Perhaps the pressure of&#xD;
&#xD;
~1&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb  n="46-47" xml:id="VAC7684-00000024"/>&#xD;
46       l~oEntOi~.&#xD;
&#xD;
necessity is scarcely sufficient 'to stimulate as rapid&#xD;
improvement in useful arts as we might rationally&#xD;
desire. Morals are generally simple and pure.&#xD;
Truth, honesty and mutual good-will--the main ele-&#xD;
iiients of mdrality-.-are generally enforced by usage&#xD;
and opinion. Even the blacks have been raised to a&#xD;
degree of well-being and of~virtue hitherto unknown&#xD;
to their race. 'They really seem to be happier in their&#xD;
.way than their masters. Most of the evils xvhich ex-&#xD;
ist appear to be common to mankind, while many of&#xD;
our blessings are peculiar to Virginia."&#xD;
"And yet," exclaimed the doctQr, "the Yankees&#xD;
are eager to subvert our social system and foist upon&#xD;
us their superior civilization! A sordid civilization,&#xD;
glittering with a thin surface of gold-leaf.---having&#xD;
circulating gold for its life-biood, a golden calf for its&#xD;
God, and a material New Jerusalem with pavements&#xD;
literally golden for the heaven of its hope. A cizili-&#xD;
zation in which men, with fierce and grasping compe-&#xD;
tition, grovel and jostle each other as men do in the&#xD;
gold-diggings. Every man in the North is let loose&#xD;
against his neighbor to become victor or victim in a&#xD;
~truggle for life. Of course, all society becomes mer-&#xD;
cenary, and honors, laws, verdicts, religion, everything&#xD;
is on sale in the vast auction-mart. But because the&#xD;
general scramble of sordid selfishness assists the teem-&#xD;
ing fertility of a new continent to produce cities and&#xD;
palaces, they vaunt their vicious civilization as the&#xD;
final product 9f consummate wisdom."&#xD;
"Let us be cautious as well as candid, my dear doc-&#xD;
tor," replied Mr. Ambler, "in passing judgment&#xD;
upon entire coinnnin'ities. In those of the North, as&#xD;
in others, there are conspicuous evils which are easily&#xD;
censured. Some men there flaunt their follies and&#xD;
&#xD;
kOERUCIC.                  47&#xD;
vices before the world with singular hardihood. But&#xD;
my acquaintance with the Northern people has not&#xD;
been general or intimate and we cannot judge them&#xD;
rightly Without knowing them thoroughly. Without&#xD;
such knowledge, it is fair to presume that, in the&#xD;
main, they are like other men-like Ourselites. Re.&#xD;
member how we have been tra~Iuced among them&#xD;
when accidental anomalies have -been culled and cari-&#xD;
catured as characteristics of our social system. Thus&#xD;
deplorahie animosities have been kindled and fanned&#xD;
into a dangerous 'flame. We should not repeat- tho&#xD;
~error in censuring them. ~Charity forbids it, and,&#xD;
since mistakes here' endanger the public tranquility,&#xD;
prudence and patriotism enforce the lesson of&#xD;
charity."&#xD;
- "Is it wise then," inquired Mi~ Fitzhugh, "to shut&#xD;
our eyes to the faults of our associates when they&#xD;
affect our safety '~ Should we not consider whether&#xD;
the corruption, or the passions, or the policy of the&#xD;
North requires us to dissolve our connection with&#xD;
that country s?"&#xD;
"A truce ;" cried Mr. Ambler, "since the conver-&#xD;
sation is drifting into a political discussion, I must&#xD;
i'etreat from it. Will you not help me out of the&#xD;
scrape, Julia ~"&#xD;
"I hope to have Miss Julia for an ally in supports..&#xD;
ing my political opinions upon a' proper occasion,"&#xD;
said IF'itzhugh.&#xD;
'~ I refer you to papa for my politics. lie is my&#xD;
political conscience-keeper. 'But I am glad to second*&#xD;
Mr. Ambjer's desire to converse upon less exciting&#xD;
topics; especially as I have wished to hear the con-&#xD;

this morning."&#xD;
"Yes; you, Colonel Fairfax, know Abraham, Mar-&#xD;
lin; the:cooper?"&#xD;
'~ Very well; an odd character, but a good man and&#xD;
a good mechanic."&#xD;
"Have you ever heard him peach ~" asked the&#xD;
doctor.&#xD;
"Preach I" exc~imed Mrs. Fairfax..&#xD;
"Preach or exhort, as you prerei~. iI~ is ~.a&#xD;
ate enthusiast who has stumbled into a sect of New-&#xD;
Lights and forthwith taken to exhorting~ his neigh-&#xD;
bors. They are beginning to style him pas~on, I am&#xD;
told."&#xD;
"I dare say he is a worthy man," mildly observed&#xD;
Mx. Ambler, "though h~ may be presumptuous. In&#xD;
all times there have been honest men who felt them-&#xD;
selves called to preach religious truth because their&#xD;
souls were Jii'ed with religious zeaL"&#xD;
"They mistake the fever of fanaticism for inspira-&#xD;
tkrn," said the doctor.&#xD;
"Uncle Dick, I fi~ar you.r late reform needs reform-&#xD;
ation.".&#xD;
"True, Colonel Julia; you are as good as a second&#xD;
conscience to me. Since you are not satished with&#xD;
my reformation, I promise not to reform any more~&#xD;
reform myseli; I mean."&#xD;
"However," continues Mr. Ambler, "it was not&#xD;
of Marlin, the cooper, that I was about to speak par-&#xD;
ticularly, but of his son, Mark."&#xD;
"Mark Marlin-I know him well,' xe~inarked Hugh&#xD;
Fitzhugh; "tie i~. a fine young fellow.~ I met him&#xD;
first in-hunting. His father lives in a cabin ~ a aniall&#xD;
&#xD;
"Well, as I came from the ~village to-day I 6ver-&#xD;
took a youth walking on the road-side. My attentionn&#xD;
was attracted by his fine athletic form and his elastic&#xD;
step. When he turned his- face to mej and, raising&#xD;
his hat, saluted me with, the title of pauom t~my dear&#xD;
doctor) I thought his countenance displayed more in-&#xD;
teIlig~nce than we are used to find in such homely&#xD;
garb as he wore and at his age, for he could not be&#xD;
more than seventeen. Curious ~o learn something&#xD;
about him and willing to give the pedestrian a lift at&#xD;
the expense of your horses, Mrs. Fairfax, I invited&#xD;
him into the carriage. He courteously declined at&#xD;
first, but when I asked him to grant me some conver~ -&#xD;
sation as a favor to- me, he came in. I soon learned&#xD;
that his na~ne was Mark Marlin, whose father I knew&#xD;
slightly, and I drew him on to such other disclosures&#xD;
as might enable me to judge of.my duty to my young&#xD;
neighbor."&#xD;
"We, young men," interposed hugh Fitzhugh,&#xD;
"have to thank you for treating us tll as soiis rather&#xD;
than as neighbors only." -&#xD;
"It is one of my pleas~2nt duties, Hugh. I 4is~civ.&#xD;
ered that Mark had an acute intellect, and that he&#xD;
had reflected much on sOme of the knotty pr~blerns&#xD;
of life. From defect of edneation his ideas were&#xD;
t~omewhat confused and imperfectly expressed. I-saw&#xD;
that he had some ambition, and' I asked him what he&#xD;
aimed to make of himself as a man. 'A gentleman,'&#xD;
was his brief and ready response. I endeavored then&#xD;
to gather from his talk what conception of a gentle-&#xD;
man had fired his youthful ambition. He neither de-&#xD;
fined nor described the character, but simply said.-.&#xD;
'Colonel Fred is the sort of man~" Thus, you: per-&#xD;
8&#xD;

ceive, 'my fi'i~nd, that you are the model of our youth&#xD;
-even bf the SonS of our mechanics."&#xD;
"And I am 'sure," Mrs. Fairfax hegan-~ -&#xD;
"flush,' my dear," cried the colonel with his cheery&#xD;
laugh, "if you open your lips about your husband,&#xD;
Mr. Ambler, as a faithful pastor, will, have to rebuke&#xD;
us both for my manifold perfection. At present I&#xD;
stand charged only~with being a gentleman, as, of&#xD;
course, I am bound to be."&#xD;
Mrs.' Fahlax replied with a look such as loving,&#xD;
wives have often bestowed on worse husbands, and&#xD;
the clergyman proceeded-&#xD;
"I reminded Mark that Colonel Fairfax had an&#xD;
an~ple fortune, which secured'to him the social posh&#xD;
tion of a gentleman. He looked at me, au~d said with&#xD;
some hesitation-'.YoU are not rich, but you are 8&#xD;
gentleman.' I could not, of ~oume, repel this arg~&#xD;
,nenlum act Iiominem. But I observed that the colonel&#xD;
sprang from an ancient faintly. He did not shrink&#xD;
from the reflection implied upon the humility of hi~'&#xD;
own family, but, in awkward phrases, went on to say&#xD;
that birth obliged Colonel Fred'to be'a gentleman in&#xD;
character and' conduct, while it secured to him the&#xD;
consideration due to a gentleman without ettort on&#xD;
his part in the beginning. 'But;' he added, 'a poor&#xD;
man, and the 'son of a poor man, in a free country,&#xD;
* can rise to a gentleman's place if he behaves like a&#xD;
* gentleman.' lie thought that wealth would help him&#xD;
to his object, but he had a suspicion that the ways by&#xD;
which men get rich suddenly are unfrIendly to the&#xD;
sentiments and habits that* should distinguish a gen-&#xD;
tleman. He believed it would be better to aim at /&#xD;
one of those professions which people look up t~ as&#xD;
carrying the idea of social ranks If we should have&#xD;
&#xD;
ROEJ3UCIt.                61&#xD;
a war in which it would be creditable to volunteer,&#xD;
he would be inclined to go as a sQ1dier,~ and fight his&#xD;
way up to a Conunissioi~, as that would entitle him to&#xD;
the position of a gentleman, and, for the character of&#xD;
a gentleman, he would keep Colonel Fred in mind as&#xD;
his model. Be~ides, he said, he was studying book~&#xD;
at home every evening after bis day's work was done.&#xD;
The conversation by which these thoughts were&#xD;
brought to light, one after another, occupied the tii~ie&#xD;
until we caine to the end of the avenue. Mark then&#xD;
left me, after promising to visit me at the par-&#xD;
sonage. ~'&#xD;
"I hope,'~said the Colonel, "he will prove to be&#xD;
worthy of the care which I t'oresee you will bes1o'~v&#xD;
on the development of his character."&#xD;
"Can you doubt it, brother Fred, when you rdinem..&#xD;
ber his model ~"&#xD;
* "I will be surety for him," said Hugh Fit~hugh,&#xD;
though I believe Mr. Ambler, after ~ single half-&#xD;
hour's ride with him, knows him. better than I do.&#xD;
In tracing the springs of his conduct, Mr. Ambler,&#xD;
you have shown~ an art which I do not possess."&#xD;
"I learned something of that art in my arst pro-&#xD;
fession, the law, and I have learned the best uses of&#xD;
it in my present profession."&#xD;
"Have you heard what happened last night to our&#xD;
neighbor Eckles ?" inquired Colonel Fairf~x.&#xD;
"I have not. What'WasitV'&#xD;
"Eeldes, you may kno~, has for some time been&#xD;

few native reprobates, give the only color of truth&#xD;
there is for the enormous calumnies upon ~u.i' society&#xD;
that are circulated at the Nerth."'&#xD;
"Yesterday," resumed the colonel, "he maltreated&#xD;
one of his slaves, and, to punish~ him for it, some&#xD;
young men of his neighborhood went to his house in&#xD;
the evening, and7, inviting him. out, they ducked him&#xD;
in the river-by way ofa warning, They told him."&#xD;
- '-"Ihope he was not seriously hurt," observed Mrs.&#xD;
Fairfax.&#xD;
"No; he got a thorough wetting only, I under~&#xD;
stand. It is probable, however, that he will sell his&#xD;
property and leave the coutmtry."&#xD;
." No doubt," said the doctor, "he wrn return to&#xD;
the North, turn abolitionist and deliver lectures on&#xD;
the hoiTo~s of slavery-admittance twentyilve cents&#xD;
a head."&#xD;
* ~C Might we not, Colonel," asked Mr. Ambler, "pro&#xD;
tect the negroes by law more effectually against such&#xD;
* masters ~"&#xD;
"It is doubtful. Good as well as evil results from&#xD;
the large discretionary authority allowed by law to&#xD;
the masters, as in the case also of parents. Opinion,&#xD;
religion,-custom and time are- safer as well as surer&#xD;
forces than law for the melioration of such social insti~&#xD;
tutions.. Qzdd leges sine mbribu* proficient? During&#xD;
the last two centuries the condition of our slaves has&#xD;
been greatly improved without m~uch aid from legi~-&#xD;
lation. The authority of the masters, in point of&#xD;
fact, is seldom abused in. Virginia. We may expect&#xD;
improvement to be p~ogr~essive. The trenchant oper~&#xD;
ation of positive law upon theintricate and delicate re-&#xD;
lations of i~ooiety is' apt to be mischievous, unless the&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
law merely sanctions or completes what time has&#xD;
proved and usage enacted. Then, though law does no&#xD;
harm, it is almost superfluous. Thus, when time had&#xD;
left little for law to do, slavery was abolished by law&#xD;
in the Northern States. In England it was abolished&#xD;
insensibly by time alone, without1 law."&#xD;
"At all events, colonel, perhaps, our legislation&#xD;
might be amended with respect to the marriage of&#xD;
slaves and the separation of their-families."&#xD;
"Possibly, if the pestilent agitation of more vital&#xD;
questions connected with the institution did not pre~&#xD;
vent a calm consideration of such subjects, some&#xD;
practicable amendment might be devised. But it&#xD;
would be difficult to frame a law that would not do&#xD;
more harm than good. The practical evils to be cor~&#xD;
reoted have been in. a great measure removed already&#xD;
in Virginia by the silent influences to which I have&#xD;
adverted.- Families are seldom separated without&#xD;
their consent, - except in circumstances of necessity,&#xD;
such as must separate families in all communities and&#xD;
under whatever .laws. Marriage is more generally&#xD;
enforced by the authority of the master~ than will- -&#xD;
ingly observed by. the negroes:. Their natural iridif..&#xD;
ference to marital and, parental obligations is more in&#xD;
fault than our laws. If yom~ absolutely foybid the&#xD;
separation of families, will you not condemn both&#xD;
masters and slaves to unavoidable suffering in many&#xD;
casesV'&#xD;
"But a Christian State should protect the sacred&#xD;
bond of matrimony."&#xD;
"The purely religious idea connected with marriage&#xD;
by many Christians ~s not a proper subject for legisla~&#xD;
tion. It is to be inculcated and enforce4, as it i~&#xD;
now among whites and blacks, by the teaching and&#xD;

discipline of religious bodies. I believe that, when-&#xD;
ever the slaves are prepared to perform the duties of&#xD;
the family, there will be little need of law to protect&#xD;
their family ties. Probably they are better protected&#xD;
and more faithfully observed now in Virginia than&#xD;
such ties are among free negres anywhere or among&#xD;

~" I can~tell you something about a wedding nearer&#xD;

foreign to your own grave discourse as your mode&#xD;
of putting that question implies;" said Julia.&#xD;
"A wedding it shall be then, daughter"&#xD;
Julia gave a slight and humorous description of&#xD;
the last grand wedding among the servants when&#xD;
her maid,. Grace, had been taken for better for worse&#xD;
by carpenter Dick, with every vow that should bind&#xD;
~two lives together and with a disinterested' contempt&#xD;
of marriage settlements; when all Africa of Roebuck&#xD;
held high festival; when the women, "black but&#xD;
comely like the "tents of Kedar," arrayed themselves&#xD;
in gorgeous colors, and when Mrs. Fairfax, having&#xD;
supplied a great supper, gave a smiling care to the&#xD;
entertainment of her servants. The slaves had jollity&#xD;
and sensuous pleasures which a Luegro loves; master&#xD;

O~ evening, a few days later, Albert Palmer sat&#xD;
at home with his father and mother. The parlor in&#xD;
which they w'ere had costly furnitur~, and the house&#xD;
was large and commodious. The father, Mr. Israel&#xD;
Palmer, was a little over fifty-five years of age, and,&#xD;
in appearance, might have been his son, grown older,&#xD;
rich and wary. Some score of years before that time&#xD;
he had come from New England with a little capital,&#xD;
and settled in Virginia as a merchant. lie had&#xD;
thrive, aiid, a few years ago, he purchased land in&#xD;
the county with a hope of crowning a life of success-&#xD;
ful business with the respectable enjoyments* of a&#xD;
wealthy planters He now coveted, as he had once&#xD;
envied, the social rank which he regarded as aristo-&#xD;
cracy. He was hospitably received in the county,&#xD;
but, by degrees, a difference of manners and tastes&#xD;
rendered the intercourse between him and his neigh-"&#xD;
bors more constrained and less frequent. J3eing&#xD;
jealous and suspicious, he imagined offence where&#xD;
none was intended. 2f~strangement and then&#xD;
dislike ensued. Stung by fancied insult, he medi-&#xD;
tated retaliation. He was not a man to yield to a&#xD;
real or imaginary conspiracy to exclude him from the.&#xD;
society of the "aristocracy." He wa&amp;amp; resolved to re-&#xD;
tain his estate and Teside on it. He would watch for&#xD;
opportunities to elevate his own family and to avenge&#xD;

himself on others. His feelings had become almost&#xD;
morbid when the pro~peot of~ 5ec&amp;amp;sion and war set&#xD;
his shrewd and active mind to calculating what ad-&#xD;
vantages he might; dei'ive from thos~ events. He&#xD;
was so cautious and secret that his thoughts were not&#xD;
freely disclosed even tQ his family.&#xD;
His wife was a tall, slender woman, with many ~&#xD;
gles and no curves. She wore her hair, her eyes, her&#xD;
lips, her limbs and her gown with formal precision.&#xD;
She sat erect' in a square, high-backed chair. She&#xD;
placed her hands on her lap smoothly along, palm to&#xD;
palm. She set her feet ~at en the floor, near toge~&#xD;
ther, and making with each other the very angle&#xD;
which, according to her notion, was proper. When&#xD;
she moved from one seat to another, she elongated&#xD;
her figure in rising with the jointed, hinged and&#xD;
oiled exaetness of a mathematical instrument, glided&#xD;
away on a straight line, with mechanical regularity&#xD;
of step, and let herself down like.a jointed instrument&#xD;
again. When she talked, her voice ran' out in a level&#xD;
stream without break, emphasis or cadence. The&#xD;
~entiments she uttered were always frigid, but never&#xD;
wrong, according to the ~tand~rd of right which slj~e&#xD;
had studied. The warmer and-nobler emotions were&#xD;
represented in her discourse by eulogies of them.&#xD;
~She deprecated their opposWes with little hitches in&#xD;
her utterances that were hints of horror. She passed&#xD;
for a saint~ in her family and in her conscience too.&#xD;
She practiced the politeness of elaborate flattery. ,She&#xD;
was a woman of learning, for she had been educated&#xD;
in fl~ston, an4 talked rather "like a book" than like&#xD;
a lady. She remembered some scraps of Latin, which&#xD;
she lugged into her conversation in season and out&#xD;
of season.&#xD;
&#xD;
Husband, wife and son were discussing the latest&#xD;
news. The same subject was discussed that evening&#xD;
in every habitation of Virginia where the intelligence&#xD;
had been received, The commissioners deputed by&#xD;
the Confederate government to visit Washington and&#xD;
solicit an amicable adjustment of the questions inci-&#xD;
dent to secession, after ljeing detained with delusive&#xD;
art until certain warlike preparations were secretly&#xD;
made, were rejected. A defiance and provocative&#xD;
of war was offered to the South by sending vessels to&#xD;
Charleston harbor to be fired 'upon,: and finally it was&#xD;
announced that the Presid~nt of the United States&#xD;
had, by proclamation, called forth an army to be em-&#xD;
ployed against the Confederate States, and that, in&#xD;
consequence of this proclamation, the Convention of&#xD;
Virginia had passed an ordinance of secession, sub-&#xD;
ject to ratification or rejection by the people at the'&#xD;
polls. It was also rumored that the State authorities&#xD;
had dispatched a volunteer force to seize the armory&#xD;
at Harper's Ferry.&#xD;
"This. means war," pronounced the paternal&#xD;
Palmer.&#xD;
"Undoubtedly war," echoed the 59U.&#xD;
"The ordinance of secession will be ratified by the&#xD;
people."&#xD;
"Almost unanimously."&#xD;
"We should be prepared for those events," said the&#xD;
father.&#xD;
"We must choose a side, no doubt~" replied the&#xD;
son.&#xD;
"Or sides."                                )&#xD;
This brief, ambiguous qualification, added by h~s&#xD;
wary father, was not quite intelligible to Albert~, b(it&#xD;
he asked no explanation and none was offered. TIia&#xD;

&#xD;
old gentleman sat for some minutes in silence looking&#xD;
at his son, as if cautiously pondering how far he might&#xD;
trust his own flesh/and blood with his thoughts. At&#xD;
length he quietly remarked.-.-&#xD;
"The North will subj agate the South."&#xD;
"Do you really think so V'&#xD;
"It is mathematically certain."&#xD;
"You scarcely appreciate the Southern people,&#xD;
father."&#xD;
"I appreciate. statistics."&#xD;
Again there was silence. The thin lips of Mrs.&#xD;
Palmer parted, as if to open a passage for the steady&#xD;
little breeze of words which usually flowed without&#xD;
apparent impulse from her mo~tith, whenever it was&#xD;
open, like the breath of the Blowing Cave. But she&#xD;
saw that the gentlemen, while gazing at each other,&#xD;
were revolving thoughts which might not brook&#xD;
interruption from her just then; So the lips were laid&#xD;
together again in a straight seam. Her husband re~&#xD;
sumed the conversation in the same quiet tone.&#xD;
"This war will destroy slavery."&#xD;
"I do not foresee that as a necessary consequence,"&#xD;
replied Albert, "-even If the South should be con-&#xD;
quered, etill less, if the independence of the South&#xD;
should be successfully maintained."&#xD;
"As hostility to slavery was the origin, the ctestruc~.&#xD;
tion of slavery must be the end of the, war. If it&#xD;
should have they magnitude and duration which I&#xD;
anticipate, it will destroy slavery even if, in the final&#xD;
result, the South should retain its independence."&#xD;
"My dear husband and my beloved eon," Mrs.&#xD;
Palmer slipped into a slight pause in the conversation&#xD;
of the gentlemen, "my conscience prompts' me to&#xD;
observe that we ought not to grieve at the release of&#xD;
&#xD;
millions of our fellow-beings from the shackles of&#xD;
bondage and the lash of cruel task-masters; all men&#xD;
are created free and equal; man cannot lawfully hold&#xD;
property in man; traffic in human flesh. cannot be&#xD;
blessed with the approval of heaven; this reflection&#xD;
occurred to my mind, my dear husband, when you&#xD;
sold Tom, to be carried to Lousiana without his wife&#xD;
and children, but it was true, as you said, that he was&#xD;
quite disobedient and he did not want his family to&#xD;
go with him and his wife did not want to go, and that&#xD;
last family you bought you got at a low price, because&#xD;
the owner did not wish to' separate, them and could&#xD;
not find another purchaser for them all; it was very&#xD;
humane in you; I hope the day will soon come when&#xD;
the whole family of man will enjoy the sunshine of&#xD;
universal freedom under"&#xD;
"We should be prepared for these events, Allert,"&#xD;
repeated the father.&#xD;
"Prudence requires it," prudently echoed the son.&#xD;
"I will sell my slaves."&#xD;
"The money might be more secure in any event of&#xD;
the war."&#xD;
"But, my dear husband, would it not be more con-&#xD;
sistent with our principles to emancipate them 'p?"&#xD;
"To be denounced as an abolitionist ?"&#xD;
"True; that is a~n insuperable objection ; we must&#xD;

"I will invest the money abroad," added Mr.&#xD;
Palmer.&#xD;
"Would it not be prudent to sell your land also&#xD;
and invest the money abroad ~" asked Albert.&#xD;
"Never !" exclaimed the father, rising and walk.&#xD;
ing about the room in evident excitement. It was&#xD;
part of a cherished plan to retain his land as the&#xD;
territorial foundation of that social supremacy to&#xD;
which he aspired. The proposal to sell it pricked his&#xD;
most sensitive nerve. But, with habitual self.control,&#xD;
lie restrained the expression of his thoughts, and,&#xD;
after some time, resumed his seat atid his composure.&#xD;
"You have said, Albert, that we must choose a&#xD;
side in this war."&#xD;
"'Or~ sides,' you added, father."&#xD;
"Why should a man risk his fortunes with one&#xD;
party exclusively? Or why should you and I both&#xD;
appear on the same side ?"&#xD;
These questions surprised Albert. lie had taken&#xD;
for granted that, in such a contest, it would be neces-&#xD;
sary for him to act a decided part, and he had not&#xD;
dreamed of acting in Opposition to his father. He&#xD;
ha~d made some progress toward a decision fir him-&#xD;
self, but with a mental reservation that his father was&#xD;
to approve his final choice. He had been educated at&#xD;
a Northern University, but even there, he had affoc~ed&#xD;
to play the Southerner. The young men of Virginia&#xD;
always treated him with cordial friendship, and, by&#xD;
their frank manners, high spirit and honorable cow.&#xD;
duct, they won his esteem and excited his emulation.&#xD;
From them he borrowed some sentiments of local&#xD;
patriotism, such as the young always cherish, and he&#xD;
was ambitious to appear among them as a tine and&#xD;
ardent Virginian. He adopted his fathers aspiration&#xD;
&#xD;
a&#xD;
&#xD;
to improve the social position of the family, and&#xD;
thought his own marriage might promote that object.&#xD;
He was not insexisible to the charms of Julia Fairfax,&#xD;
and, with hereditary thrift, had calculated the advan-&#xD;
tages which the hand of that heiress could bestow.&#xD;
Under the influence of various feelings and calcula-&#xD;
tions, he had accustomed himself to make loud pro-&#xD;
fessions of violent Southern, sentiments, and he could&#xD;
scarcely have told how far they were sincere and how&#xD;
far affected. He was inclined to range himself still&#xD;
on the side of Virginia in the war that was now imnii~&#xD;
nent, but he was ready to weigh all advantages on&#xD;
each side before taking an irrevocable step. It ha4&#xD;
never occurred to him that lie might secure the&#xD;
advantages of both sides or of neutrality. Perplexed&#xD;
by his father's questions, he looked at him as if he&#xD;
would read an explanation in his face, but that was&#xD;
not to be read like the face of a cloek. Mr. Palmer.&#xD;
instead of explaining asked another question-&#xD;
"To which side do you incline, Albert  "&#xD;
"I have believed that it was your desire to identify&#xD;
our family with this community, and it would seem&#xD;
most consistent with your views that I should em-&#xD;
brace the cause of Virginia7," cautiously replied the&#xD;
son. After another pause the father said-&#xD;
"You have visited Miss Fairfax ?"&#xD;
"Not often."&#xD;
"What course will her father pursue ia the war 7'~&#xD;
"Doubtless he will adhere to Virginia."&#xD;
"He owns a fine estate ?"           -~&#xD;
"Yes, sir."&#xD;
* "It will be confiscated."&#xD;
Again there was silence. The suggestion of con.&#xD;
~1soation was new to Albert, and both gentlemen&#xD;

were interested in trains of thought connected with&#xD;
it, but neither communicated his reflections to the&#xD;
other. At length the father briefly announced his&#xD;
conclusion.&#xD;
'Go with the South, Albert. I will adhere to the&#xD;
North."&#xD;
"Really, father, you will oblige me if you wrn ex-&#xD;
plain the ~reasons which lead you to a decision so ex-&#xD;
traordinary."&#xD;
"Is it not natural for me 'to prefer the land in&#xD;
which I was born and in which I lived, until I was&#xD;
too old. to discard the attachments of youlh, and'&#xD;
that you should prefer the land in which you have&#xD;
grown up 'P'&#xD;
"Pessibly; but".-the young man hesitated. .He&#xD;
was about to insinuate that his father. had put forth&#xD;
a mere pretext to cover deeper reasons. He was un-&#xD;
derstood. The father replied to his thought.&#xD;
"I choose, then, the 'par1~y that is most likely to&#xD;
prevail. I expect thus to save my property. You&#xD;
have none tolose. ]3y the sale of negroes I may olflain&#xD;
means to purchase confiscated estates. All will enure&#xD;
to the benefit of yourself and your mother and sister.&#xD;
This is preparation for one event and that almost cer-&#xD;
tain. But if the South should happen to succeed&#xD;
you can save my property, and, by marriage, you&#xD;
may obtain another estate. Now do you understand ?"&#xD;
he asked with asperity, as if he was angry with his&#xD;
son for requiring him to disclose his secret plans.&#xD;
The latter inquired.-..&#xD;
"May not your property or perhaps your person be&#xD;
in danger here, when it becomes :known that you em-&#xD;
brace the Northern cause ~"&#xD;
"It need not become known kere."&#xD;

As th~ gentlemen ceased to converse, Mrs. Palmer&#xD;
deemed this a favorable opportunity for herself to&#xD;
talk, but she had to soliloquize. Her keen scent of&#xD;
the family interest made her a safe confidant of all&#xD;
domestic debates, and the instinct of unwavering self-&#xD;
ishness had sometimes carried her on a bee-line to&#xD;
the stores of fortune when reason would have stuin-&#xD;
bled in the search. lint when business had been&#xD;
settled, the gentlemen did not deem it necessary to&#xD;
"hear her homily.&#xD;

"Mother, where is sister Jane? I want some&#xD;

Sister Jane was called,' but her music only served&#xD;
to remind Albert of Julia Fairfax, whose image lured&#xD;
him along a chain of logic that aided in a conclusion&#xD;
favorable to the Southern cause. lIe resolved to ad.&#xD;

0r the next day sat the County Court. At an&#xD;
early hottr the court~-bouse g~'een and the village street -&#xD;
were thronged with men. Horses filled every stable&#xD;
and shed, and stood along both sides of the street&#xD;
from end to end. The county had turned out, for the&#xD;
county was deeply agitated.&#xD;
The village had but a single street. On one side of&#xD;
it stood the court-house, with its adjacent offices and&#xD;
neighboring jail. Opposite was the Swan, Tavern,- an&#xD;
ancient inn, famous for good cheer. Scattered along&#xD;
either side of the street were two rival stores, the&#xD;
shops of the blacksmith, saddler, wagon-maker and&#xD;
shoemaker, the offloes of two lawyers and two physi..&#xD;
clans, and the dwellings of half-a'-dozen lnSohanics.&#xD;
At one end of the street stood a wooden building, of&#xD;
which the lQwer story was occupied by a wool-carding&#xD;
machine, propelled by horse-. power, and in the upper&#xD;
story was a printing office, from which a weekly news..&#xD;
paper entitled the "Tobacco Leaf'~ w~s issued about&#xD;
twice a xnc~nth, and. in some months thrice. At the&#xD;
other end of the street was an old church, built in Co.&#xD;
lonial.times, with a parsonage of less antiquity~ The&#xD;
church-yard contained many monuments that were&#xD;
moss-grown or crumbling with age. On some of&#xD;
them 'could' yet be dimly traced heraldic or literal me-&#xD;
mentoes of the pride of a former generation, and .ou&#xD;

others were inscriptions so quaint that nothing but&#xD;
antiquity could save them 'from from a suspicion of&#xD;
drollery. With these, of' course, were decent but&#xD;
tasteless tombstones of modern date.&#xD;
Such was the village which had once been endowed&#xD;
~ with a proper name-some name already famous, or&#xD;
one which the village was expected to render famous.&#xD;
But it was almost forg&amp;amp;tte4 and never mentioned in&#xD;
the county. People always spoke simply of "the-&#xD;
village," as if there had been but one. in the universe.&#xD;
In fact, there was not ai~iother of equal importance in&#xD;
the county, and there were but few in Virginia. Ex-&#xD;
cept those whose professions or trades bound them to&#xD;
towns, people in that fair, bright county preferred&#xD;
rural residences. In the wide suburbs of this village&#xD;
resided, among shady ~roves and on small farms or&#xD;
large lots, the merchants, professional men and prin-&#xD;
cipal Officer8 of the bounty.&#xD;
On the court green-a shady lawn of considerable&#xD;
extent-the citizens of the countywereaccustomed to.&#xD;
meet on ill public days Ior the tx~ansaction of busi-&#xD;
k~ess, to hear and tell news, or to discuss the affairs&#xD;
'of the county, the State and the Ijnion. Never&#xD;
before, perhaps, had so many of them. been assem-&#xD;
bled there as on this April -court day,' in the year&#xD;
eighteen hundred and sixty-one. A glance ~t the&#xD;
assemblage would have discovered that there was&#xD;
intense popular excitement, but it was silent and&#xD;
stern.&#xD;
When Colonel Falrfaxi went upon the green that&#xD;
day, and even'before he had left his horse, he was strr-&#xD;
rounded by different khots of men, successively grasp~&#xD;
Ing his hand and seeking his counseL He was 'always'&#xD;
received there as a favorite citizen, for he was very&#xD;

&#xD;
popular. But on this occasion it was not mere popu-&#xD;
larity, it was a profound respect for his wisdom, integ.&#xD;
rity and patriotism that drew the' people around him,&#xD;
as their counsellor in a crisis of public danger. To&#xD;
their eagel' inquiries he replied,~sadly but firmly, "the&#xD;
'hour has come-we must fight." His words flew from&#xD;
month to mouth, and the whole 'multitude soon knew&#xD;
that "Colonel Fred thought we mn.st fight." This&#xD;
opinion accorded so exactly with the previous c9nvic-.&#xD;
tion of every mind and the impulse 'of every heart&#xD;
that it was accepted at once as a conclusive judgment.&#xD;
When it became generally understood that the ques-&#xD;
tion of war was determined, and that the people were&#xD;
all of one mind, the hushed excitement was succeeded&#xD;
by murmurs of mutual encouragement. 'Most of those&#xD;
present were thoughtful and resolute men, who were&#xD;
well aware that the "war which they accepted as un-&#xD;
avoidable was for theni a calamity. . They felt as&#xD;
brave and rational men may feel when they are forced&#xD;
to choose between the risk of death and the loss of&#xD;
r~mething held dearer than life. There were no des-&#xD;
perate wretches to whom war might bring relief.&#xD;
There were ~no mere "fooLI for powder." But when&#xD;
the feelings of the crowd began to find vent in words,&#xD;
some enthusiastic young men evinced the animal. joy&#xD;

the boys excitement, as usual, effervesced in hilarity~&#xD;
Their spirit of glee was caught up as a multitude&#xD;
catches any emotion, no one can~ tell how or why, and r&#xD;
in a little while smiles were seen on the. lips of men&#xD;
whose brows were yet stern. 'Their hearts were heavy&#xD;

&#xD;
in front of the co~urt-house.' A crier of the oourt,&#xD;
standing beside him, solicited attention by,, shouting&#xD;
with stentorian voice-.-" Oyez, Oye~! silence is 'com~~&#xD;
manded, on ~ain of imprisonment--.beg pardon-I&#xD;
take that back-Oyez, Oyez! Hugh Fitzhugh, Esquire,&#xD;
will now address the people, and God 'save the .Com.~&#xD;
monwealth and this worshipful court-.I beg pa~rdon&#xD;
again-but I will say, God save old Virginia, and I'll&#xD;
never take it back, pardon or no pardon."&#xD;
Whether the crier 1  a design or merely blundered&#xD;
into a~i accustomed formula' 40f' his oflIc~, his final&#xD;
prayer for the Commonwealth, uttered with earnest&#xD;
emphasis, sent a thrill through the crowd. A score of&#xD;
voices' cried, ~" three cheers for old' Virginia - God&#xD;
bless her ~" and all the people responded with a tumult&#xD;
of cheering. When there was silence, Fitzhugh 'said:&#xD;
"It is proposed to raise a company of volunteer~&#xD;
cavalry for the defence of the State. I hol4 a paper&#xD;
prepared for the signatures of those who wish to vol-&#xD;
~nteer. Let them now come forward. If others will&#xD;
pardon me for taking the start of them, I will set my&#xD;
name down first."&#xD;
"Well done, Hugh !" exclaimed the older citizens.&#xD;
"Wait for me! Wait for me !" shouted many of the&#xD;
younger. "Three cheers for Hugh Fitzhugh !" cried&#xD;
one~-" three cheers for the, cavalry 1" added another, .&#xD;
and "three cheers for the Old Dominion !" was a gen-&#xD;
eral call. All the cheers proposed~were given with a&#xD;
will, and while the mass fanned itself into a flame with&#xD;
its own breath, the young men were stepping forward&#xD;
and emolling their names. But it became necessary&#xD;
'to retire from the portico, for within the temple of jus-&#xD;
tice the voice of the crier was heard commanding&#xD;
silence in the formula with which the sessions of the&#xD;
&#xD;
08&#xD;
&#xD;
flOflBUCIC.&#xD;
court were opened. The c~urt was held by five jus-&#xD;
tices of ~the peace, i~e&amp;amp;pectabIe farmers, and the presid-&#xD;
ing justice was Oaptair~ Walker, a venerable. man of&#xD;
ninety. He was remarkable for vigor of ~znind and&#xD;
body at that age. Few men of' seventy cafried their&#xD;
bui'dem of years with as unbending firmness. In the&#xD;
earliest years of the century he was a leading citizen&#xD;
of the 'county, respected for his uprightness, his en-&#xD;
ergy and his ability. Increase of years added all that&#xD;
should accompany old age. Having once served as a&#xD;
captain of volunteers, ho was still called "captain."&#xD;
The fictitious title of colonel, 'often courteously or&#xD;
jocosely conferred on conspicuous citizens by popular&#xD;
brevet, could not snpersede ;the real rank of' actual ser-&#xD;
vice. A fiction fastened upon his name would have&#xD;
offended the genuine esteem felt by his neighbors for a&#xD;
character so ruggedly sincere~&#xD;
It was apparent.thav no judicial business could be&#xD;
transacted that day. The Commonwealth's attorney,&#xD;
Mr. Williams, rose to address the court, and, after&#xD;
alluding to the coxnmencem~nV of'war, observed that&#xD;
-in the first instance th~ counties would probably have&#xD;
to provide foi' the immediate expenditures required'for.&#xD;
the public defence, for the equipment of v~lttnteers and&#xD;
for the support of their families in the cases .of poor&#xD;
men during their absence fromiiom~. At 'his 'sugges-&#xD;
tion, the court ordered all the justices of the county to&#xD;
be summoned to the ne4 monthly term for the pur-&#xD;
pose of considering this ~siibject. He then stated&#xD;
that the people desired to hear a'discu~sion of public&#xD;
affairs, and particularly of the question submitted to&#xD;
~them by the convention-that of secession. In order&#xD;
that. the court-house might be occupied f~r this pnr-&#xD;
pose, the court, on his motion, adjourned for the 'day.&#xD;

&#xD;
Proclamation having been made at the door, the&#xD;
people gathered into the court~house-all except those&#xD;
who were too intent, upon the formation of a company&#xD;
of cavalry. The question of war had been deter-&#xD;
mined, 6r rather, as they thought, it had been forced&#xD;
by their enemies. The question of secession remained&#xD;
to be discussed and decided. The house was soon&#xD;
brim-fulL The dense assemblage. included citizens of&#xD;
all ages, classes~ and conditions. High and low, rich&#xD;
and poop, learned and unlettered, were. packed&#xD;
tog~t~ie~r. The upturned faces expressed. every degree&#xD;
of intelligence and ,a great variety of character; ' but&#xD;
- all were earnest~faces, and not a dozen men were there&#xD;
who would have told ~a lie under any temptation.&#xD;
According t~ ouet~m, a chairman of the meeting&#xD;
was appointed. The person selected for that office&#xD;
was Captain Walker, the presiding justice' of the&#xD;

"My countrymen: I thank you f~r this honor, but&#xD;
I accept it with sadness. I rejoiced at the birth of&#xD;
the Union. Now, on the verge of the grave myself,&#xD;
I am summoned to its death-bed. Would to Ood I&#xD;

The right of a State to withdraw from the Union when.&#xD;
ever, In her Judgment~ It haa become oppressive and she&#xD;
hasno~ther adequate remedy, is a right which our fathers&#xD;
have taught us to venerate as essential to the preservation&#xD;
of our liberties under the Federal system. You are familiar&#xD;
with the reasons by which ithas~ been vindicTated. I need&#xD;
only remind you of some of those reasons. According to&#xD;
an acknowledged principle of i~atural justice and of public&#xD;
law, ~ sovereign State has a right to dissolve her compacts&#xD;
with 9ther States whenever, in her judgment, there is just&#xD;
cause to dissolve them. If this right were not allowed, a&#xD;
Btat~ would often have no jt.tst r lress for the violation of a&#xD;
compact by another party, She is held to be justified in&#xD;
annulling it hi morals as well as iti law, when it has been&#xD;
wiifuIIy~ yioI~ated by the other party in points essential to&#xD;
her security or welfare. The application of these principles&#xD;
to the, Federal Union will not be~denied by any one- who&#xD;
adwits that otu Statesare sovereign and that the .Constitu.&#xD;
tion is a compact between them. But these were the&#xD;
propositions established in a memorable contest-.-.the first&#xD;
great Constitutional controversy in the Union. Virginh~.&#xD;
had *~ conspicuouspart In that controversy, and has preserved&#xD;
for the instruction-of future agei the unanswerable-ptoofs she&#xD;
then rrayed to establish that the States are sovereign and&#xD;
the. Federal Constitution is a compact between them.&#xD;
- 9 When the Colonies threw ofr their allegiance to Great&#xD;
Britain, they assumed the character of States. In that&#xD;
character they were recognized by each, other, and by all&#xD;
nations. In that character they framed and adopted the&#xD;
~deral Constitution, retaining in it the name of United&#xD;
States. Important provisions of that instrument recog..&#xD;
nize their continued existence as States~ with the equality&#xD;
~ of sovereigns, and with a large and utideflued reservation&#xD;
~f independent powers. 3y the most solemn acts of Mas~&#xD;
sachusetts and of other States, the sovereignty of each&#xD;
State in th~ Union has been, affirmed. Our political and&#xD;
judicial history is full, of documents supporting the seine&#xD;
doctrine, associated with tho fundamental principle tii~at the&#xD;
Constitution in a compact. The right to dissolve the coni..&#xD;
&#xD;
x~o~uc1~.                     73&#xD;
pact~ inherent In the States was not surrendered In&#xD;
* the Constitution. On the contrary, it was reserved&#xD;
by Virginia in her ordinance to Tatify the Federal coni~&#xD;
pact.&#xD;
*    "If we ascend above Constitutions and historical dccii.&#xD;
ments to the sources of natural and eternal ~rtstice, a natu~&#xD;
ral, inalienable, iodef~asible right of self-government be~&#xD;
longs to great communities like these Southern States~&#xD;
civilized, organized communities, capable of fulfilling the.&#xD;
duties of a nation. This is a right which iioconstitutlouor&#xD;
compact can annul, and no power can take away.&#xD;
"Having the right, Virginia ought to secede. The Fo~&#xD;
deral compact has often been nullified or violated by many&#xD;
of the Northern. States, wilfully, wantonly, persistently in&#xD;
matters vitally affecting the Southern States. The power&#xD;
which the North has acquired, and its persi$t~ce. in&#xD;
wrong, have destroyed all hope of redress~ in the Union,&#xD;
Many acts of Northern aggression are fresh in. your recob&#xD;
* election. Each one has been met with solemn protest by&#xD;
the South, and every protest has provoked a new outrage:&#xD;
I sl~all not now recite the' long and dreary catalogneQt ag.&#xD;
gressions, for the most recent events demand our exclusive&#xD;
attention. History will keep a record of all.&#xD;
"The framers of the Federal Constitution gnavde4&#xD;
* against a of p~ver by the- government in every way&#xD;
that their wisdom fOresaw to be necessary; for they knew&#xD;
that all governments tend to tyranny. They protected 1~be&#xD;
small States against the ambition of the larger. But the&#xD;
problem of binding tw&amp;amp; powerful and unequal uatioiia to~.&#xD;
gather under one government, withotit permitting either to&#xD;
oppress the other, was not present to their minds. They -&#xD;
did not foresee that a confederacy of the-- most populous&#xD;
States would be formed within the Union, constitutbig a&#xD;
distinct nation, animated with the usual passions of nations,&#xD;
and with animosity against the whole body et the ~tates&#xD;
not embraced in that Confederacy. But this is wh~t has&#xD;
happened. The Constitution, so far rrom providing secu&#xD;
rity against oppression in such a case, has unintentionally&#xD;
facilitated the design ot the -Northern Ponfedez'aey to~ Op'&#xD;

press the South. 'By a combiuatipu pursuing the forms of&#xD;
'the Constitution, a minority of the pe~p1e of the Union have&#xD;
concentratedd the whole power of the North antI. seized the&#xD;
government, electing a President upon principles so unjust&#xD;
that he cotild not receive one Southern vote. Those who&#xD;
persuade themselves that the dominion thus usurped by the&#xD;
North over the South will ever be relinquished, or that it&#xD;
will be exercised with justice, forget history and ignore&#xD;
human nature. Since a Northern Confederacy has flSUrp3d&#xD;
the authority ot' the Union for our oppression, we must&#xD;
save our liberty by a Southern Confederacy beyond the.&#xD;
Union.&#xD;
"If any doubt heretofore remained of the necessity for&#xD;
this action, It, must have been dispelled since the North has&#xD;
claimed the right, through the Federal government, which&#xD;
It controls, to reduce the South to obedience by arms, and&#xD;
has drawn.the sword for that purpose. We might easily&#xD;
?etnte that pretension by Constitutional argument, but the&#xD;
,sword can be answered only with the sword. The framers&#xD;
of the Constitution distinctly refused to confer on the Fede-&#xD;
Tal government the power to compel the submission of a&#xD;
state by military force. The last President of the UiTiited&#xD;
States officially disclaimed the power. It could not exist&#xD;
Without transforming our Federal system. It. cani~ot be&#xD;
exercised without establishing ~ m~tary desiiotism at&#xD;
Washington. But reason is silenced. The voice of can..&#xD;
"non, and not the voice of the people, must decide these&#xD;
'controversies.&#xD;
"We must defend our sister States of the South. We&#xD;
cannot be neutral. We will, not make war against them.&#xD;
Honor, affection, self-preservation, compel us to take arms&#xD;
In their ~defen~e. If we are to fight we must secede. 'Un-&#xD;
less the State resumes her separate existence, and reclaims&#xD;
the authority which she has granted to the Federal govern-&#xD;
1nez~t, her people will incur the penalties of treason by&#xD;
'fighting against that government!. If she secedes, she can&#xD;
'unite with the other Southern States and make their joint&#xD;
resistance effectual4 Her example will be followed by&#xD;
'States 'yet'adhering ~ the Union. The formidable array&#xD;
&#xD;
of all the Southern State8 may even yet deter th~ Nort-h,&#xD;
and arrest the war. At all events, it will assure success:'&#xD;
The address of Mr.- Williams was heard with silent&#xD;
attention. At the conclusion of it 'he proposed ~. re~&#xD;
solution to declare the sense of the jneeting that the&#xD;
ordinance of secession should 'be ratified by the&#xD;
'people. 'then there was a paitse in the' proceedings,&#xD;
to afford any who' might wish to speak an oppor~&#xD;
tunity. No one came forward until the chairman was&#xD;
about to take a v6te. Then D'octor i~'airfax rose, ana&#xD;
with some trepidation in his voice, signified a desire&#xD;
to address the meeting. The solemnity of the occa-&#xD;
sion and of the audience repressed his propensity to&#xD;
sarcastic levity an~1 braced his nerves-for he was a&#xD;
man of nerve-to the unaccustomed task of address-&#xD;
ing a public assembly; He spoke thus in sub~&#xD;
stance&#xD;
"I am opposed to secessiOn. I concur in the opinion&#xD;
that we are now Obflged to engage in war for the det~nce&#xD;
of the South. War supersedes other controversies, and,&#xD;
therefore, I shall not discuss the right of secession or the&#xD;
causeS of secesslOit. Certliluly,, we 5l~aI1 be justified in so-&#xD;
ceding, if secession is advisable, as a measure of war. 2But&#xD;
it is with reference to the war that, in my judgment, 'se-&#xD;
cession is not advisable.&#xD;
"If we 'remain in the UnioWwe may reasonably hope to&#xD;
terminate this war with an/honorable peace; for we shall&#xD;
fight upon no pretension that our enQmies may not ulti-&#xD;
'macely concede for the si~ke of' peace. If' we s~c~de, we&#xD;
can never return to the Uiilon without a surren~ler of the&#xD;
main point of contest-~that is, without acknowledging our-&#xD;
selves conquered. The North ~vill never concede our&#xD;
separate independence. The war 'inust be foii~ht to cx-'&#xD;

II' Virginia adheres to the Union the. States which have s~-&#xD;
ceded may, under her example and mediation, return to it,&#xD;
ancj there may be a peace honorable to all.&#xD;
"That the war, 4f prosecuted to extremity, will result&#xD;
in our subjugation, appears to my mind painfully certain.&#xD;
The fighting population of the North is as three to one' of&#xD;
our own at the beginning, and with every hour of war this&#xD;
disparity will be widened. Emigration from Europe will&#xD;
* replenish the' North. All the adventurers, paupers and&#xD;
vagabonds of the Old World can be hired to* fight against&#xD;
us. Casualties and the curtailment of our territory by in-~&#xD;
V~asion, will diminish our numbers and no foreign supply&#xD;
will restore them. .We shall lose Delaware, Maryland,&#xD;
Kentucky and Missouri. certainly. War is in a large~&#xD;
measure a work of money and machines. The North has&#xD;
both. We have neither. The North can so.on set afloat an&#xD;
unequalled navy. The south can have none. Commerce&#xD;
will continue to enrich our enemies. We shall be cut off&#xD;
from all the world beyond out' own shores. The Federal&#xD;
government has unbounded credit. Our government must&#xD;
establish itself before it can enjoy the credit through which&#xD;
it should be established. Oi~r vast rivers will divide our&#xD;
power t~nd admit the 4'orces of the enemy into the heart of&#xD;
our territory. With a population thinly scattered over an&#xD;
immense area, we have no adequate means ot' concentrating&#xD;
our wealth, our men or our policy. Natural and artificial&#xD;
means of concentration, the most varied. amid complete, ~vil1&#xD;
be in possession of the enemy and d~spotismn will conceit-&#xD;
trate their policy..&#xD;
We must not rely,~-upon dissensions in the north. Poli-&#xD;
ticians there ~iave encouraged us to resist, and have de-&#xD;
clared that the army Which marches to conquer us mdcl&#xD;
first pass over the corpse&amp;amp;of themselves and their partisans.&#xD;
Trust them not. When war rages we shall not have e&#xD;
corporal's guard of determined friends in that country. You&#xD;
will see that even so bald a pretext as that the South has&#xD;
fired the first gun, so shallow a triek~. as that ~hiel~ d~ew&#xD;

the fire of Confederate batteries on Fort Sumter, will eon-.&#xD;
solidate the Northern populace in ~furions support of the&#xD;
war. The North is divided into two parties, truculent Re,&#xD;
publicans and truckling flemecrats. No 'party there will&#xD;
act upon the obvious truth, that when liberty is attacked&#xD;
with the sw6rd it can be defe~led only with the s'vord.&#xD;
After it shall be lost, through their aid or. apathy, some&#xD;
Northern men may solicit youm' assistancQ to rescue it from&#xD;

But in the real struggle you will stand alone.&#xD;
"Expect no aid from Europe. Imagine not that cotton&#xD;
Is king, or that the necesshies of commerce will bring En.&#xD;
gland or France or an~ other power to intervene for our&#xD;
benefit. Intervention must be ivar, or it must be futile.&#xD;
The old nations, taught by experience, dread war and value&#xD;
peace. English cotton manufacturers, having excessive&#xD;
stocks on hand, are now in a condition to be saved from&#xD;
ruirL by any event that will interrupt the exportation 6f cot-&#xD;
ton, from this country for the next three years. English&#xD;
commerce will flourish by any war in which England takes&#xD;
no part. English policy demands the abolition of slavery&#xD;
and the consequent abridgement of the cotton culture on&#xD;
this continent-ends to b~ accomplished by the triumph of&#xD;
the North. Though a division of the Union may be desir-&#xD;
able to her, as reducing a formidable power, yet the ~mpover-&#xD;
ishment of the South by war ~tnd the necessity of' emploj.&#xD;
ing Northern force to keep a conquered people in subjec-&#xD;

stand aloof, and without her, no other power will 'inter-&#xD;

them from inflicting the penalty of treason on qur, soldiers.&#xD;
They will not respect the ordinance, and, if' they refrain&#xD;

they cannot sustain, for more than two years at the utmost,&#xD;
the constant pressure of such tremendous odds. Virginia,&#xD;
I trust, will endure, if necessary, until she shall be made a&#xD;
wilderness. Doubtless in this great struggle she will be&#xD;
true to her ancient character. But do not expect other&#xD;
Southern States to emnlat~ her conduct. They will do&#xD;
great d~ds and suffer horrible afflictions before they will&#xD;
surrender a good cause, but some of them will yield before&#xD;
independence can be secured and long before Virginia will&#xD;

The war upon us will never end. A people who hate us&#xD;

over the hopeless bondage which the war bins brought on&#xD;

consign them ,to purgatory. But I desist; I believe that no&#xD;
fancy can approach the actual wretchedness of a proud,&#xD;
brave, intelligent people, subjugated by such a power as the&#xD;
North."&#xD;
When ])octor Fairfax sat down, Mr. Williams rose&#xD;
again and remarked that if no oth~r person desired.&#xD;
to speak he would make abrielNreply to the laslv&#xD;
speech. As no one else rose, he proceeded:&#xD;
"The right of secession has not been denied. That there&#xD;
are sufficient causes for it has: not been denied. That it&#xD;
would render our resistance t6 the North more effective by&#xD;
uniting the South has not been denied. That.independence&#xD;
of the North is the prize most worthy of our exertions when&#xD;
we are compelled to fight is admitted. But we are to be -&#xD;
deterred from availing ourselves of these advantages of&#xD;
secession. How? You are told that we shall certainly be&#xD;
conquered. If this be true, yet subjugation will scarcely&#xD;
be a fate more dreadful than the perpetual despotism to&#xD;
which we shall basely submit by remaining in the Union.&#xD;
At least, a gallant struggle for indepedence will save our&#xD;
honor-the most precious heritage of a people. But it is&#xD;
not certain that the united South will be conquered by the&#xD;
North. It is possible, but it is not even probable. We&#xD;
shall stand on the defensive. We have only to endure7 and&#xD;

&#xD;
time will exhaust 'the enemy. If our vast territory renders&#xD;
concentrated resistance difficult, it renders snbj ugation&#xD;
impossible. The native courage of our people and the&#xD;
spirit which the cause of liberty inspires will. overcome am&#xD;
immense supei~iority of mere numbers. Our fertile country&#xD;
au~ our laborhig population will feed and clothe our army,&#xD;
80 that neither moziey nor foreign commerce will be ~so&#xD;
necessary to us as to the enemy. Machines and navies are&#xD;
less needful to us than to our invaders. Oar white popm-&#xD;
latien can spare a larger proportion of fighting' inen~ than&#xD;
that of the North, because our blacks will remain to labor.&#xD;
If so many millions of freemen, fighting to preserve Picir&#xD;
liberty and resolved to sacrifice everything for independence,&#xD;
shall be subjugated, the lessons of history are fabe. tat&#xD;
us not throw away the rich prize of success through timid&#xD;
apprehension of failure. This enterprise is dangerous. It&#xD;
must put the endurance of all Southern people 'to severe&#xD;
trial. Let them be sustained by the hope of independence.&#xD;
Since we must fight, we must incur the hazard of stilJj ng:~-&#xD;
tion. It is vain to expect peace until we show ourselves&#xD;
able to resist the North. For the sake of peace we have&#xD;
vainly forborne, yielded, solicited,, until we are almost dis-&#xD;
graced. Since we must hght, let us fight for inclepen-&#xD;
deuce." -&#xD;
After ascerinining that no other person desired to&#xD;
speak, the chairman submitted the resolution to a&#xD;
vote of the meeting. All the people responded&#xD;
~' aye," except five orsix who answered"' no." Very&#xD;
soon after the result was announced the citizens be-&#xD;
gan to move out of the door, but the movement wa~&#xD;
arrested by the voice of 'a boy whp sat on a table&#xD;
within the bar, and who began to cull out-~" Marlin :&#xD;
Marlin! ~ speech~ from Abram Marlin!" Such a call&#xD;
always finds an echo in a crowd. ~cveral voices took&#xD;
it up and cried.-" Marlin! Marlin! Marlin I" The&#xD;
eyes qf the youth who led this chorus were fixed upon&#xD;
a man who stood on the steps leading up to the j udi-&#xD;

&#xD;
did bench with aleg and an arm over the banister. -&#xD;
He was dressed in coarse but ele~n homespun. He&#xD;
seemed about forty-five years' of age. His person&#xD;
was rather tall and lank./ His features were rough,&#xD;
and his hair hung do~n, long, straight and thin&#xD;
around hi~ neck. Under shaggy brows his grey eyes -'&#xD;
had a restless, vigilant motion, as if the brain was&#xD;
active and excitable. When the repetition of his&#xD;
name became emphatic, though still apparently made&#xD;
in jest, he withdrew his limbs from. the banister and -&#xD;
walked up the steps. Standing on the judicial plat-&#xD;
form, he turned his face to the audience with tin-&#xD;
moved self-possession. He. then began&#xD;
"I ain't a gwine to make a speech, my feller-sinners.&#xD;
I couldn't say much about that ore doctrine of secession,&#xD;
It ain't one of the doctrines that 'I'm used to preach about.&#xD;
I stick to the doctrines in the good book, and them doe-&#xD;
triucs I always try to make so 'cl'ar that the women and&#xD;
niggers can understand 'em. But I've been a ponderia'&#xD;
over this ore war in the silent watches of the night when&#xD;
niy Betsy was fast asleep. I've looked up the prophets on&#xD;
this subject . It rather looks to me like we're a gwine to&#xD;
fight the great battle agin Gog and Magog. Leastways&#xD;
that battle has never been fou't yit, and so it stands to rea-&#xD;
son that it's got to be fou't sometime, Now, in the thirty..&#xD;
eighth chapter of Ezekielit is said unto Gog-' thou shalt&#xD;
come from thy place out of the North parts, thou and many&#xD;
people with thee, all of them riding upon horses, a great&#xD;
company and a mighty army.' So it stands-to reason of a -&#xD;
man always keeps afighthi' agin the armies that come out&#xD;
of the North parts, he'll be fightin' on the right side when&#xD;
that big he-fight of all conies off. So I've been a pondering :&#xD;
that I'd take a chance in this ore war agin' the North.&#xD;
Anyways it will-be a fight for Virginny, and that's a good-&#xD;
enough fight for me. Next to my God, I'd go my death&#xD;
for old Virginny. I'm ?ether dubous that I'm too old and&#xD;
rheumatized to march in the infantry, but of I had a hose&#xD;

I'd jine the calvary. I ain't got only one hose, and that's&#xD;
a mule. Ef any gentleman would swap'a hoss for that&#xD;
mule"--&#xD;
"You shall have a horse," said a voice froni the&#xD;
* crowd.&#xD;
"Then 'count me in. Doctor Fairfax says the Yankees&#xD;
will whip us. Well, the doctor ain't a prophet, nor the&#xD;
son of a prophet. Leastways I ain't seed his name thar&#xD;
* among the prophets. But one thing I kin tell you, and I&#xD;
* have Scriptur' for it, the Yankees, even if 1~hey have Gog&#xD;

brethren, in peace or war, in this world and the world to&#xD;
come. EC we want him on our side now, we must go to&#xD;
war with pure hearts and in humble reliance on Eu. We&#xD;
must ask His blessing. Let us pray."'&#xD;
He knelt down, and stretched out his hands. Ifls&#xD;
sudden and unexpected movement, and call '~o prayer,&#xD;
took the people by surprise. Almost involuntarily&#xD;
they rose up and stood in reverential attitude, while&#xD;
Marlin poured fourth a brief in'i~'ocation, so fervent&#xD;
that his grotesque language could not prevent it from&#xD;
touching the hearts of men, and when he ceased a&#xD;
solemn "Amen" was murmured in all parts of the&#xD;
house.&#xD;
When ~he meeting was over it was foui~d that a&#xD;
sufficientt number of vohinteer~ had enrolled them-&#xD;
selves t~ constitute a company of cav~lxy, according&#xD;
to the laws of the State, and a t~ime was appointed f~r&#xD;

people'began~ to mount their horses and start home-&#xD;

of the green for the same purpose, a number of young&#xD;

or turned back in the street. When he reached the&#xD;
to~ of a s~lle he saw a large audience standiiig in ex-&#xD;
pectation, and he found it necessary to~ s~y a few&#xD;
words. He thus addressed the people&#xD;
"VIRGINIANS :-.-By that title you are bound to noble&#xD;
thoughts and heroic deeds. The time demands them now.&#xD;
Discussion is ended. War is begun. The North has&#xD;
pressed the South to the wall. We must defend our&#xD;
liberty, arms in' hand, or be forever dishonored and&#xD;
enslaved. If there is a man among you who would&#xD;
surrender liberty or honor in exchange for life, 'no&#xD;
blood of Virginia runs in his veins, The war may be ter-&#xD;

Virginia may be crimson with the blood of her sons and&#xD;
her foes. But her sons will bleed for the honor of theiR?&#xD;

but your children will inherit freedom. When tb~ war&#xD;

Look to the end-independence. Honor and shame-lib-&#xD;

CHAPTER VIII.&#xD;
PPJNIL&#xD;
WHEN the sun had set and all the citizens had left&#xD;
the village, except a few who had qualified the spirit&#xD;
of patriotism with the spirit of rye, three or four of&#xD;
the latter class sat in the 'porch of the Swan Tavern,&#xD;
upon a 'wooden bench against the wall. Before them&#xD;
* sat a young man on a large, sp1it-b~ttomed arm-chair,&#xD;
meaningg back against the banister, with his feet ele..&#xD;
nted.' He was genteelly dressed, though his soft hat&#xD;
was.. crushed and drawn down over a corner 6f one&#xD;
eye.' He was small and slender. His hair and mus-&#xD;
tache were black. His heavy eye-lids hung aslant&#xD;
over the pupils, half closing them, and there was a sen-&#xD;
sual, fleshy fullness about his lower jaw%. His name&#xD;
was Baxter. He was the son of a gentleman of high&#xD;
~character, who was the clerk of the County Court,&#xD;
and had held 'the office more than thirty years. The&#xD;
son had been carefully educated, and had in youth&#xD;
shown quick parts and that forwaj~d pertness which&#xD;
partial parents sometimes mistake, for precocious genius.&#xD;
When he grew up to manhood he ~ed an idle, reckless,&#xD;
dissolute life, studying the chemistry of juleps in bar-&#xD;
rooms, the mystery of horse-flesh at races, or natural&#xD;
history at faro-banks,' called in slang "tigers." He&#xD;
had dauntless courage and a sort of wit that made him&#xD;
a favorite in low company. He was looking out from&#xD;
under his heavy eye-lids at the faces before him with&#xD;
~n expression that might have been serious if he had&#xD;
&#xD;
been sober, but as he was not, it was comical. At length&#xD;
he said, abruptly-&#xD;
"Bill Ankrom, I have been wondering why a fellow&#xD;
like you volunteered to fight in this war. You would&#xD;
oblige me by tolling me if you know, yourself."&#xD;
"To keep the Yankees from abolishing slavery, of&#xD;
course."&#xD;
"110w many niggers do you own 'C'&#xD;
"None 'by       You know that as well as I do.&#xD;
But if they set the niggers free, who'll be below me ?'~&#xD;
"Nobody can be lowe; I 'believe. You think, as&#xD;
matters now stand, a white skin is a patent of iiobiity&#xD;
granted by God and sanctioned by law 'C'.&#xD;
"Somethino' that a way, I reckon. Do you think I&#xD;
want my sbn to black your boots or my darter to cook&#xD;
in your father's kitchen 'i"&#xD;
"Your theory fe that society must rest on mudsill~,&#xD;
and if the black ones are torn away white ones must&#xD;
be stuck under. You are a philosopher, Bill; did you&#xD;
know that? It would be a .pity that a Yankee bullet&#xD;
should crack your craniology. But stick to your&#xD;
patent of nobility-you have no chance to getanother.&#xD;
And you, Bob Fans, are' you going to fight for~ the&#xD;
same reason 'C'&#xD;
"Well, I ain't jined yit, but I reckon I'll 'go in tor&#xD;
the principles of free government."&#xD;
"Bully for yo , Bob. ~You call a Democratic gov-&#xD;
ernment free, 44~i~'t you 'C'&#xD;
"Yes, I was born a Dimmicrat"&#xD;
"Wouldn't you think mea fool if I went out to&#xD;
fight for the privilege of kwing a batch of ~drux~keu&#xD;
nincompoops like you fellows on that bench to govern&#xD;
me? That's your principle' of free g6vernmeut.~ Zt&#xD;

&#xD;
We have tried to run a machine that cant go right&#xD;
unless you make thirty millions of people understand&#xD;
the art of government. It requires all those Yankees&#xD;
away up in Maine to understand the interests of all&#xD;
those Creoles away down in Louisiana. You see the&#xD;
end of it, and now you waift to fight for a free gov-&#xD;
ernment of the same sort. You iiiust be very drunk&#xD;
to-day, Bob. Now, Sim. Franks, you ought to be a&#xD;
soldier. Your skull is a life-insurance."&#xD;
"You take care of yo~ur own skull. Why don't&#xD;
you volunteer ~'&#xD;
"Oh, I intend to be a 'commissary. I ~want to be&#xD;
in the eating and drinking department. I'll make&#xD;
one big continental spree out of this war~?'&#xD;
"I nevei? thought you was a coward afore."&#xD;
"Because I am not a coward, must I fight merely&#xD;
for fun'?"&#xD;
"I've seed you do it."&#xD;
"Well, here is fun," said Baxter, turning ti~ look&#xD;
into the street. Two men there sat on horseback, fac-&#xD;
ing one another. They had the appearance and dress&#xD;
of middling farmers. One ha4 a red head and the&#xD;
hair. of the other was whity-brown. They had evi-&#xD;
dently tasted the cup which does inebriate. Haltir~g&#xD;
at the sanie moment, they eyed each other with drunken&#xD;
defiance, and then engaged in a polite and obliging&#xD;
conversation, whieb attracted the attention of Baxter.&#xD;
"Sir," said the man of fiery to~-knot, "you must&#xD;
excuse me, sir, but I have been credibly informed, sir,&#xD;
that you said, sir, you would whip me, sir, the first&#xD;
time ~you ~aid eyes on me, sir."&#xD;
'" Yes, sir; your information is correct, I am&#xD;
to inform you, sir."                       PPY&#xD;
~"If you are not blind, sir, you can lay eyes on me&#xD;
now, uir:~&#xD;
&#xD;
"If you will do me the favor tc~ get plr y~ui horse,&#xD;
sir, I wIll now do what I promised, sir."&#xD;
"With great pleasure, sir."&#xD;
They dismounted, and giving their bridles to a ser-&#xD;
vant from the tavern, took1 off their coats and squared&#xD;
themselves for a duel of fists. They approached each&#xD;
other with a parade of fairness and civility, though&#xD;
with unsteady gait.&#xD;
"Now strike .me, sir, if you please," said Whity'.&#xD;
brown.&#xD;
"No, sir, you are under promise to whip me. sir~&#xD;
Strike first, sir."&#xD;
The man of tl~reats accepted the invitation, andafter&#xD;
a flourish of fists, discharged a blow with all his 'might.&#xD;
But he missed his antagonist and fell upon the ground.&#xD;
"Get up, sir, if you please," said he of the ~ed h~ir,'&#xD;
and he waited until his request was obeyed aud the&#xD;
other belligerent was ready for a second round. Then,&#xD;
with more fortunate aim than the latter, 'he sent the&#xD;
whity-brown head to the ground aga~in. After look..&#xD;
ing at him in the dust a moment, the other walked oft'&#xD;
toward a grass plot beside the road, and said~'5' Come&#xD;
here, sir; that street is dirty, sir9" The fallen befliger..&#xD;
ent. arose and followed him Then the figbt continued&#xD;
for some time with various fortunes, but as bokh come.&#xD;
batants were easily upset and. neither wou1 Istrike*~&#xD;
dangerous blow, very little damage was done. At'&#xD;
last, whex) both were weary, and tho challenger oi'&#xD;
threatened was down, his adversary stood over him&#xD;
and said-&#xD;
"Now cry enough, sir.; I'm sure you've got~euough."&#xD;
"Never."&#xD;
"Then, sir, you are Irunk or. a fqol, sir. I scorn to&#xD;

&#xD;
<pb  n="88-89" xml:id="VAC7684-00000045"/>&#xD;
Having* thus spoken, he walked away toward his&#xD;
horse, while the prostrate combatant called after bim-&#xD;
"Maybe I'm too drunk now, but I'll keep sober at&#xD;
next court. 1I'll th~ijk you to meet me thenj."&#xD;
Baxter and the other persons on the porch, who had&#xD;
been amused spectators of the bloodless battle, now&#xD;
descended into the street, congratulated the gentlemen&#xD;
on the honorable termination of their difficulty and in..&#xD;
sisted that they should shake hands and be friei~ids.&#xD;
Baxter, suggesting a peace-maker'perhaps on the prin-&#xD;
ciple of an adage touching a "hair of the dog," urged&#xD;
them to come bite the tavern and take a drink with&#xD;
him 'axTid his companions. Protest against the&#xD;
peace they assented to the drink. Once in the bar-&#xD;
room, the participants and spectators of the recent&#xD;
conflict discussed that affair in such fashion that&#xD;
another fight became imminent. Consequently ano-&#xD;
ther~ cup. of eonciliatibm became necessary. So they&#xD;
wrangled and drank or drank and wrangled, while&#xD;
Ba~ter'urged peace or war or whiskey, according ~to&#xD;
his fluctuating humor, until darkness had long set-&#xD;
tled down upon the vilag~.&#xD;
"Here comes Blind Pete," exclainie axter, s a&#xD;
pale, thin man, led by a little boy, ei~tered the bar-&#xD;
room; "come in, Fete; ~,we'll make you see stars&#xD;
without your eyes. Take a drink."&#xD;
The new-comet, nothing loth, condescended to&#xD;
perform that ceremony of initiation, and while he&#xD;
was imbibing the liquor, ]3axter said:&#xD;
Who's your bail now, Pete 7"&#xD;
"Oh, sir, I always gives the best bail in the county."&#xD;
"Yes, you go to jail like a rogue and are rans~med&#xD;
like a geutleinan, thanks to your blindness. Your&#xD;
blindiiess is catchh~g, 'or the gentlemen could 'not&#xD;
&#xD;
wink so at your rascalities. But who's your bail&#xD;
now,&#xD;
"Colonel Fred."&#xD;
"Why, it wa~ for stealing his bacon they put you&#xD;
in jail."&#xD;
"'That's the reason 'he was bound to attend to the&#xD;
case. You see it was his own case, lik~."&#xD;
"You are a lucky thief, Pete. If you had your~&#xD;
eyesight you would be in the penitentiary But now&#xD;
when you steal, all the gentlemen feel boftnd -t. let -&#xD;
yen og though you own land and steal for the love&#xD;
of larceny. Whose corn is to load your cart to-night,&#xD;
Pete 7"&#xD;
"You always will have your joke, Mr. Baxter."&#xD;
"I believe I will to-night. Where's your cart 7"&#xD;
"At the upper end of the village."&#xD;
"And the blind mule with it 7 Ready, I suppose,&#xD;
for your nightly tramp to collect provisions and forage&#xD;
that the negroes steal and sell to you for whiskey."&#xD;
"Night, you know, Mr. Baxter, is' the same as day&#xD;
to a poor blind man."&#xD;
"Well, I am going to take a ride with you to-&#xD;
night. Come along, boys. We'll escort you 'two&#xD;
fighting horsemen on your way home.' It is time&#xD;
for you to go. We'll celebrate the restoration of&#xD;
amicable relations 'between you by a nocturnal pro-&#xD;
cession, with that red head for a torch-light. Pete's&#xD;
a dai'k' lantern and shines only in corn-cribs and&#xD;
meat-houses. Come on."&#xD;
After one more drink they all sallied out into th~&#xD;
dark. When the horsemen had - been helped into&#xD;
their saddles, they all followed Pete to his cart. The&#xD;
little boy, who 'was Pete's son, being young and puny",&#xD;
was earri~d along 'by his father, because his tender&#xD;

years and feeble health secured to him impunity like&#xD;
that ;which Pete' himself derived from blindness.&#xD;
Baxter mounted the mule and ordered the rest -of his&#xD;
procession, except the tw~o horsemen, to get into the -&#xD;
crazy vehicle. " Hill, Pete," he cried, " the spine .&#xD;
of this mule will split my .spine North and South, as&#xD;
those other mules are splitting the- Union. Why&#xD;
'don't you feed him better when corn costs you&#xD;
nothing~ but the-stealing? He' has more ears on his&#xD;
head than' you ever put into his trough." However,&#xD;
he adjusted his. posture as well as he could to the&#xD;
spinal ridge of the mule and began to belabor that&#xD;
patient ~animal with a heavy stick which he had&#xD;
picked up. " Go to the front, Torch-light," he cried,&#xD;
" the' procession on wheels will' follow." It did fob-&#xD;
low, b~t at a slow pace, for th~e mule did niot resent '&#xD;
the heavy thwacks he 'received. Baxter, hoping to&#xD;
accelerate his gait, ordered his passengers to whoop&#xD;
and yell in his rear. But the mule never wagged an&#xD;
ear. With such freaks as drunken: folly prompted,&#xD;
they diversified the enjoyriient of their snail-like jour'&#xD;
neay, until at last they began to descend a bill. The&#xD;
force of gravity was too strong for the,lkmees of the&#xD;
stubborn animal, and he started off 'at a trot, to keep&#xD;
out of the way of the cart. Faster and faster he went&#xD;
while Baxter-whipped and the eart jolted and bounced-.&#xD;
" Look out, boys," shouted Baxter, -"IPm going to&#xD;
make sausage-meat of you."' This benevolent warning&#xD;
was .scarcely uttered when mule, cart* and passengers&#xD;
were tumbled cwer in. a promiiscuous wreck at the foot&#xD;
of the hill., "Halt in front! Bring -us the' torch-&#xD;
light,'~ cried Baxter. Upon a careful analysis of the&#xD;
inas Qf animate and inanimate wnatter, it was discov-&#xD;
ered that no person was hurt :beyn   .some slight&#xD;
&#xD;
*&#xD;
&#xD;
bruises. A mule is more invulnerable than Achilles.&#xD;
The repairs of the cart detained the party some -thirty&#xD;
minutes. " I am glad it is no worse,".said Baxter ; " I,&#xD;
thought I was sending you all to Baxter's Saiints' Rest."&#xD;
The procession moved on until the mulestpe&#xD;
near a barn and refused to go farther.stpd&#xD;
" Whose 'barn is this, Pete i" asked Baxter.&#xD;
"I can't see, Mr. Baxter."&#xD;
" Neither can your mule see; -but .he knows the&#xD;
'barn. 'Can't you tell whose corn you stole on this'&#xD;
.road ? I'mn sure the mule got a bite here."&#xD;
" Really, Mr. Baxter, I've been at so. many places'&#xD;
-with my cart "----&#xD;
" Never 'mind ; I know this place myself now ; it's&#xD;
old Palmer's. I see 'we must stop with him. Come,&#xD;
-boys ; let's rouse him up. He is an old 'Yankee.&#xD;
We'll- make him drink to Jeff..Davis in some of his&#xD;
own liquor."&#xD;
:" Agreed !" was the general response'&#xD;
Leaving the boy with the cart in the road, the men&#xD;
walked 'to the house, and at their~ noisy summons a&#xD;
.servant, half-asleep, came to the door, and admitting&#xD;
them, ushered them into the parlor, where they found&#xD;
Mr. JPalmer and his wife. Their daughters h ire-&#xD;
tired, but they were waiting 'for the return of. Albert,&#xD;
who had gone.'to a distant part of the county. When&#xD;
they beheld Baxter and his retinue entering the parlor&#xD;
they were astounded. They stood in 'expectation of'&#xD;
an "explanation, which-Baxter was rather' slow to-give,&#xD;
'for the unexpected presence of a. lady somewhat&#xD;
abashed him. In a little while he rallied, and advanc-&#xD;
ing with an air 'that was meant to be both stately and&#xD;
courteous, he offered' the, customary salutation to the&#xD;

Palmer, I ~Va8 riding this way, and I could not think&#xD;
of passing your house without dropping in on you,&#xD;
indeed I couldn't. Knowing your hospitable disposi-&#xD;
tion, I invited my friends to come in with me. Let&#xD;
me have the honor to introduce them." He proceeded&#xD;
to call the roll, ana appended to each name a brief&#xD;
exposition, as thus: "Bob is a champion of free gov-&#xD;
ernment; all he.owns in the world is a principle, and&#xD;
he values it. aQcordingly; he'd die for itr Thi~ man&#xD;

now, you see, we are all birds of a feather and fio~k&#xD;
together. This is a nobleman, and he carries his&#xD;
patent in his face, for it was once white, but the parch-&#xD;
ment is now brown, which shows the antiquity of his&#xD;
title; he is descended from one of those old sea~.&#xD;
rovers who made a wharf on Ararat when the water&#xD;
was up, but it is not certain which of them, after~&#xD;
Noah, was his ancestor. This is Peter the Hermit; he&#xD;
lives a retired life in day-time; he roams abroad at&#xD;
night, because he stands on equal rights, and he is&#xD;
equ4l to any of us in the dark; he has a way of equal-&#xD;
izing property too, by the stars "-and so on.&#xD;
MrLPalmer bowed stiffly to the visitors and re-&#xD;
quested them to be seated, he and his wife setting the&#xD;
example. Baxter reclined at . ease in. a large arm-&#xD;
chair. His followers remained standing. Presently&#xD;
he said: "Mr. Palmer, I was telling these gentlemen&#xD;
you were as hospitable as a lord."~ Either, this hint&#xD;
or the appearance of the guests, suggested to Mr.&#xD;
Palmer that they had come in to be treated and that&#xD;
the shortest way to get rid of them would be to treat&#xD;
them at once. lie said: "Gentlemen, perhaps you&#xD;

When the host rose to have the liquor and glasses&#xD;
brought in, the hostess went gliding out of t1~e room.&#xD;
Fluttered, if. not alarmed, she had~ once or twice risen&#xD;
to retire but resumed her seat. Her m6vements were&#xD;
still rectilinear but rather spasmodic. 'When she&#xD;
went out the small 'remainder of Baxter's diffi~Ience&#xD;
also departed. When the liquor came and began to.'&#xD;
flow, his insolence flowed with full tiae, "I like your&#xD;
brandy, Palmer," he said,, slapping that gentleman. on&#xD;
the shoulder, "fill again." He enforced the precept&#xD;
by his practice, and his companions, without much&#xD;
urging, followed his example. Mr. Palmer would&#xD;
willingly have refrained, but he still hoped that every&#xD;
glass would be the-last, and thinking it necessary to&#xD;
keep the riotous crew in good humor by politeness,&#xD;
~ he did not refuse to drink with them. "Take more,&#xD;
old fellow,.fill up; I assure you the liquor is good,"&#xD;
said Baxter again and again. "Now, I'll give you a&#xD;
toast. A bumper, Palmer. A bumper, everybody)&#xD;
tag-rag and all. Here's the health of J~. Davisaud&#xD;
success to the Confederate States of Aiherica. You'll&#xD;
drink that, old fellow.".&#xD;
"Certainly, Mr. Ba.~~cter, with pleaSure," replied Mr.&#xD;
Palmer, and he drank with the i'est. Throwing an&#xD;
arm affectionately round his neck, Baxter said: "I am&#xD;
glad, Israel, to find you are one of us. You must&#xD;

"But it is time for gentlemen to retire," said Bax-&#xD;

The cheers were given, and Mr. Palmer joined in&#xD;
them. The irregular .tuin~ilt of shouts roused the&#xD;
ladies from their beds; and thus Mr. Palmer beanie&#xD;
guilty of disttu'bing his family at midnight with riot&#xD;
-      and rebellion  The visitors then shook hands with&#xD;
bim . and: with* each other, having a confused notion&#xD;
that they were about to separate. I~v~n Mr. Palmer's&#xD;
thoughts began to thicken and jAs lips to grow purple.&#xD;
lie followed the ~unmarshalled array to the door, and&#xD;
finding Blind Pete in the rear, plucked his sleeve and&#xD;
whispered, "come here to-morrow." He had, some&#xD;
previous knowledge of that darkling rogue, by repute&#xD;
at least, and it suddenly occurred to him that his&#xD;
je~uliar qualifications might be rendered useful to&#xD;
himself in times of confusion.&#xD;

Long afterwards he showed his resentful reoolrectioii&#xD;

Baxter, declining to escort the two mo~ted men&#xD;
further, turned the cart back toward the village~ He&#xD;
took a seat in it with tlie others; and gave the lin~by&#xD;
~which the mule was driven to the boy. Almost over~&#xD;
come with liquor and fatigue, he nodded as they&#xD;
jogged sioyiy along. But at the end of ~n hour ho&#xD;
roused himself up and said-" boys we are consorting -&#xD;
with a thief, and my mind misgives n~e that he has&#xD;
stolen something this very night while he has been in&#xD;
our company. Our character is at stake. Pete must&#xD;
be searched." That landed proprietor protested his&#xD;
innocence, but it was decided that a search should be&#xD;
made. His pockets Were overhauled and very soon&#xD;
one of the party exclaimed, "here it is-.-~silver sugar~&#xD;
tongs." The article was drawn forth and recognized&#xD;
as one which had been used to transfer some lumps&#xD;
.of Mr. Palmer'8. sugar from ~ silver bowl to The&#xD;
glasses which ~e drank. "1 knew it," said J3a~ter~;&#xD;
"now, gentlemen~ you shall sit as a jury in this ~c~se,&#xD;

last of the affair. Justice must not be balked~~ any&#xD;
longer. No bail here-he is taken in the mannei~&#xD;
hang him up with his own line."&#xD;
Pete was raggedd from the cart; the line was tied&#xD;
about his neck,. and Baxter started to look for a tree.&#xD;
The criminal knelt, prayed, whined, wept, b~t his ex-&#xD;
ecutioners seemed inexorable. The little boy~ cried&#xD;

from the village upon his' mule, he found his wife,&#xD;

closing up the cooper's shop, and his daughter, ~liza,&#xD;
a buxom, red-cheeked girl of fifteen, milking the&#xD;
~ Betsy, the wife and mQther, ~y~s a woman of&#xD;
large, lean frame, with a square head and features&#xD;
strongly marked. Plain truth ~nd decisive energy&#xD;
were traced in every line pf her countenance. Her&#xD;
dress was coarse, though neat, and her large hands&#xD;
were hardened by domestic industry. F6r' forty&#xD;
years she had.knowu' poverty without repining for a&#xD;
single hour. She accepted her lpt; ifl hfe~ '~4th Cheer-&#xD;

was to train up her children in habits of in4u~try and&#xD;
virtue. The parents were both rniterat~e, but thee es~&#xD;
sential principles of a good life are karned without&#xD;
research, and taught without books.&#xD;
Abraham was received jn his huu~Ae cabin with as&#xD;
much respect and affection as if he hadbeen the most&#xD;
illustrious ~f men. After supper he related to his&#xD;
family the events of the day at the village, but with-&#xD;

that circumstance, he looked at his wife as if he felt&#xD;
much anxiety to ascertain the impression it made on&#xD;
her mind. ~lIe was accustomed to consult her about&#xD;
every important step in life, but here was one, of the&#xD;
last importance to them all, which he had taken with..&#xD;
out knowing her opinion.&#xD;
"You.7ve done right, Abraham," she pronounced&#xD;
decisively.&#xD;
"Well, Betsy, I thought y~u~d say so, from our&#xD;
talk last night, but I couldn't be ~asy in my mind till&#xD;
I'd tell you ~aIl about it, and heaY how it would look&#xD;
to you then."&#xD;
"You've done ~right, Abraham. li's very hard on&#xD;
us, but you ought to fight for Virginny."&#xD;
* "But, Betsy," he ~akl with some hesitation, "I've&#xD;
gc;t to furnish a hoss, and I've agreed to swap the&#xD;
mule for one."&#xD;
"We can't well spare the mule. But," she added&#xD;
after some reflection, "the ground is nearly, all&#xD;
plowed. We must git along with the hoe and the&#xD;
spade. It will be more work, but we'll do it."&#xD;
"I reckon you ciuld borrow ~ mule sometimes for&#xD;
half a day."&#xD;
"WeflI work, Abraham, while you fight."&#xD;
* During this cOnversatkni Mark was at first silent&#xD;
and attetitive; then he became excited and even agi..&#xD;
tated. lie sat on a rough stool near the chimney.&#xD;
Becoming restless, he rose ~md walked to the door;&#xD;
then he went back and sat down. His eyes fixed&#xD;
with eager interest now upon his father's face, and&#xD;
now upon his mother's, attracted her, notice.&#xD;
"Well, Mark," she asked, "what are you thinking&#xD;
about 'C'&#xD;

* "God bless the boy!" said the mother, "if he was&#xD;
a year or two older, We might h~ve two soldiers to&#xD;
fight for our country."~&#xD;
"Older! Why not ~iow 'I I'm big enough, mother;&#xD;
I'm strong; I'm. healthy; I'm active. Why not&#xD;
now?"&#xD;
This was the first intimation the parents bad re-~&#xD;
*ceived of Mark's vehement deske to become a soldier.&#xD;
The certainty of' war Was too recent to have caused&#xD;
much discussion in that secluded cabin, and he had&#xD;
not disclosed to his parents his notion. of fighting his&#xD;
way up to the rank of ~a gentleman whenever a&#xD;
patriotic war should occur~ They looked at each&#xD;
other in doubt, and sat revolving the question in their&#xD;
minds. At length Abraham said-.~&#xD;
"Mark, it won't do for you and me both to leave&#xD;
* your mother and sister."&#xD;
"If our counI~ry needs you both," said Betsy, "I'll&#xD;
take care of Eliza, and our Heavenly Father wilt take&#xD;
care of us all.'&#xD;
"I wish I Was a man," exclaimed ti~1iz; "I'd be a&#xD;
soldier."&#xD;
"But, Mark, we ain't got but one hoss,"' said the&#xD;
father.&#xD;
"Let's see, Abraham; don't the government give&#xD;
hosses to the cavalry ?"~&#xD;
"No; I lam the way is for every man to fetch his&#xD;
own hoss, and the government to pay so mu~~h a~day&#xD;
fbr the use of hini.'~&#xD;
"Well," said Mark, after          for along&#xD;
time on this obstacle, "I don't know how to get ano-&#xD;
ther horse. But, father if only one of us can go,&#xD;
don't you think ~rou had better stay at home and let&#xD;
me go? You will be of more use at home, and I can&#xD;
stand a soldier's life better than you."&#xD;

up. Well, mother, I'll take care of you and E1i~a.&#xD;
Ill be of some use if I help you to spare father for&#xD;
the war. But if I only had a horse!'&#xD;
The next morning Mark and his father were in the&#xD;
little yard before the cabin, discussing a proposition&#xD;
which the son had brought forward, to the effect' that&#xD;
he would volunteer for infantry s~rvice. Tne cavalry&#xD;
was so much more agreeable to the taste and views&#xD;
of the young man that at firsl he thought of nothing&#xD;
else, and in the agitation of the previous evening it&#xD;
had not occurred to him that he conldbe a soldierwith-&#xD;
out a horse. But it came into his mind at night,&#xD;
while he lay in bed, wakefullyy turning the problem&#xD;
that had baffled him inside out in search of fl&#xD;
tion. In the morning, although' extremely reluctant&#xD;
to abandoxi the hope of serving in cavalry, he an-&#xD;
nounced his new plan. While it was under discussion,&#xD;
Colonel. Fairfax and his daughter Julia rode up before&#xD;
the cabin, followed by a servant, who led a saddled&#xD;
horse. They saluted 'the eider and. younger Marlin&#xD;
with cordial kindness, and whenMrs. Marlin, hearing&#xD;
their voices, came out, they had many pleasant words&#xD;
for her. After a few minutes had been given to the&#xD;
chat of complimei~ts, Colonel Yairfhx said to Abraham:&#xD;
"'1 heard of your remarks in the eouit-house yes-&#xD;
terday, and of your offer to volunteer if you could&#xD;
get a hGrse. I am too o14 to be a soldier myself, and&#xD;
I wish you to ride the horse I have brought, as my sub-&#xD;
stitute. We have long been friends, and I hope you&#xD;
will not refuse to use my' horse. Lead him up here,&#xD;
John."&#xD;
&#xD;
"Thank you, colonel ~ you're mighty kind; but I've&#xD;
made a bargain for a hoss."&#xD;
"I heard of that too. It was when you offered, in&#xD;
the oourt-house to swap your mule for a horse, and&#xD;
some one said you should have a horse. But your&#xD;
family cannot do without the male."&#xD;
'~My word's out, colonel."&#xD;
"Who was the person who promised you the horse ?"&#xD;
"I don't know.. I didn't see him. I jist learn his&#xD;
voice."&#xD;
"Perhaps he will not come forward with the horse."&#xD;
"Well now, colonel, do you think there's sich a per-&#xD;
son in the county? Is there any sich a gentleman as&#xD;
wouldn't unke his word good ?"&#xD;
"We cannot tell. You had better make sure of a&#xD;
horse. You will do me a great favor by accepting&#xD;
mine."&#xD;
"I. must let the man have the mule, colonel, ef he&#xD;
comes up to his bargain, and then I'll have a hoss~;&#xD;
much obliged to you, though, colonel, all the same.&#xD;
Ef fie don't comO I'll swap with you, that is, ef we&#xD;
kin agree."&#xD;
"Really, Abraham, I feel much disappointed. I&#xD;
wish to do something for the war and for you."&#xD;
While this conversation was going on, Mark eyed&#xD;
the horse that was in want of a rider, while he was&#xD;
in want of a horse, and his head was busy with the&#xD;
question how these two wants might be supplied hon-&#xD;
e~tly by one operation, beneficial to the cavalry ser-&#xD;
vice. Julia had no suspicion of his desire to obtain&#xD;
the horse for his own use, but she was always ready&#xD;
to say a kind word to every one.&#xD;
"Mark," said she, with her sweet smile, "you Will&#xD;
soon 'be old enough to~ fight f~r our country too, and&#xD;
I am suie you will be a gallant soldier.~'&#xD;

"In any way consistent with my own honor.-4,&#xD;

nel, to take credit without a prospect of being able to&#xD;

"Perhaps not,".replied Mark,~. "and then you would&#xD;

But Mark could not repress a sigh, and Julia saw&#xD;

Papa consents, your mother consents-don't shako&#xD;
your obstinate head. Your mother shall not be dis-&#xD;
tressed about the little balance that will be due for the&#xD;
horse. You can send her your pay as a soldier, and it&#xD;
wrn amount to the price of a horse before you have a&#xD;
tempting chance to shoot or be shot at. Come, the&#xD;
whole business is settled between you and me, is it not,&#xD;
Mrs. Marlin ?"&#xD;
"Mother," said Mark, "do you think this would ~be&#xD;
r'ght?"&#xD;
"Yes, my son; I think we may do as Miss4ulia&#xD;
says."&#xD;
~' Then I accept the horse with many thanks to you,&#xD;
colonel, aid to Miss Julia."&#xD;
"Oh yes, Mark, the women are worth more than_&#xD;
&#xD;
k&#xD;
&#xD;
the men to carry on a righteous war. We have heads,&#xD;
Mrs. Marlin," she added, laughing and shaking her&#xD;
own pretty head.&#xD;
"And hearts, too," said, the colonel, smiling; "but&#xD;
now I must use what influence I can to have Mark ac-&#xD;
cepted as a soldier."&#xD;
When this sale had been negotiated with so much&#xD;
jockeying and feminine art, and the price-made small&#xD;
by more cunning mediation on the part of Julia-.had&#xD;
been agreed, on, Colonel Fairfax and his daughter took&#xD;
leave of the preaching cooper and his family. They&#xD;
spent a great part of the day in riding about ai~ong&#xD;
their poor neighbors, and distributing some of that&#xD;
property which the colonel held as a trust, and of that&#xD;
happiiiess which natures rich in cheerful goodness dif.&#xD;
fuse like the fragrai~ee of flowers. In the course of&#xD;
their ride they called on Mrs. 1~'it~hugh, the mother of&#xD;
Hugh, at Willosvbank, her place of residence. It was&#xD;
about two miles from Marlinis cabin, an~L if the reader&#xD;
consents to make that little journey with them, we too&#xD;
will 'go to Willowbank.&#xD;

-       CHAPTER x.&#xD;
WILLOWBANK.&#xD;
Trn~ visitor, in approaching the old mansion of Wil-&#xD;
lowbank from the highway, caught a glimpse of the&#xD;
'white building through numerous trees, flecked with&#xD;
the opening leaves of ~pring~ Near the house a few&#xD;
scattered survivors of the' original forest, such as the&#xD;
great elm ~with triple trunk, the far~-branching' oak and&#xD;
round-topped walnut, stood among large old trees&#xD;
which, in the rings' about their hearts, kept a calendar&#xD;
of the age of the family which planted them. At the&#xD;
foot of 'a sloping bank before the mansion grow a&#xD;
great weeping willow, with its long slender tWigs and&#xD;
dark green leaves dropping in stately sadness~&#xD;
The house was a long building. of two stories,&#xD;
framed of wood, weather-boarded and painted white.&#xD;
There was a wide porch along the entire front. The&#xD;
old-fashioned chimneys 4ere built outside, and' at each&#xD;
end of the house. The rooms were large and the win-&#xD;
dows small. In a wide hall at the middle of the build-&#xD;
ing' was a fight of stairs starting at one side of the&#xD;
hail, and near the top, making a rectangular turn upon&#xD;
a broad landing, with massive, square posts, heavily&#xD;
capped. Over the spacious Tflre~places were high,&#xD;
wooden mantel-pieces, adorned with an infinity, of&#xD;
mouldings and with rosettes 'and other figures which&#xD;
commemorated the taste of that Fitzhugh who erected&#xD;
the mansion in the last century. It was then regarded&#xD;
as a grand establishment, for it was finer than most&#xD;

cipal families of the county. Time gnawed. silently&#xD;
upon the woodwork, but in that community time&#xD;
wrought few changes of ideas or social relations in the&#xD;
lapse of only two or three generati4is. The family&#xD;
retained its respectability, and the house was still re-&#xD;
garded by all the county round as a grand establish-&#xD;
ment, notwithstanding that; since, a railroad was made&#xD;
through the county, spine antique notions had been&#xD;
put t~ flight, and some more costly and elegant dwell-&#xD;
ings had been erected in the neighborhood. The idea&#xD;
of grandeur attached to the place descended, as an&#xD;
heir-loom in the family, excluding envy of modern&#xD;
rivals and preventing projects ~f. improvement. The&#xD;
perfection even of the trees planted by a former gene~&#xD;
ration, took its place among the domestic traditions,&#xD;
and though new ones might have improved the pros-&#xD;
pect, they could not flatter the pride of ancestry. The&#xD;
old furniture was retainedunder the influence-of simi-&#xD;
- lar sentiments. The tall, square,, eight-day clock in&#xD;
the hall, with iron weights, brass, wheels and lunar&#xD;
face, could not give place to a modern time-piece, for it&#xD;
had measured the ages of many members of the family,.&#xD;
second by second, from birth until jleath. The quaint&#xD;
old bedsteads -had beet~ witnesses of the births,&#xD;
bridals and deaths of several generations of Fitzhughs.&#xD;
In the old presses were piles-of home-made coverlets&#xD;
and gay silk dresses that would st~nd on end, with&#xD;
other relics of the thrift or fashion of a primitive aris-&#xD;
tocracy.. A gourd hung over a cedar-bucket of drink-&#xD;
ing water on a shelf at the back-door, but- there was&#xD;
silver in ,the side-board. The-many old things about&#xD;
the old house could not be exchanged for~ shining.&#xD;
novelties without rending the very roots of the family&#xD;

&#xD;
As Colonel Fairfax and his daughter saw Mrs.&#xD;
1?it~hugh, the widowed tenant of this habitation,&#xD;
walking in her garden with the support of a tall cane,&#xD;
she might have seemed a feeble wyman of sixty or&#xD;
more, though she was several years under three score.&#xD;
She was pale and thin, but her form was not bowed,&#xD;
and her features were strongly marked with lineaments&#xD;
of pride. Sh~ had, been for many years a confirmed&#xD;
invalid. But a vigorous ~and cultivated intellect, with&#xD;
indomitable will, resisted the inroads of disease, and&#xD;
from year to year she fought off death. The pride that&#xD;
was written on her brow seldom escaped from her&#xD;
tongue~ It was neither boastful nor scornfd. Within&#xD;
her breast it was strong in all forms, but ~specia'4 as&#xD;
the pride of family. Her proudest 'and yet her weak~&#xD;
eat passion was her love for h~r only son, Hugh.&#xD;
The place on which she resided-~-a plantation of&#xD;
considerable extent-~iith fifty or sixty slaves, de~&#xD;
endedd to him at the death of his father. The wick&#xD;
owed mother of an infant son, becoming sole guardian&#xD;
~of his person and estate, devoted herself thenceforth to&#xD;
his nurture and education. She so managed his estate&#xD;
as to keep it entire and without debt, while defraying&#xD;
the expenses of his education ~nd travels, but a woman&#xD;
and an invalid could do 'no more. The slaves, missing&#xD;
the authority of a man above overseers, became negli.&#xD;
gent and some of them dissolute. The plantation&#xD;
needed repairs, although the grounds about the house,&#xD;
being under the eye of' Mrs. Fitzhugh, were kept with&#xD;
taste and care. Hugh, first as an infant, then as a&#xD;
student, and finally as a traveler, had been unable to -&#xD;
attend to his 'estate in person, and after his return&#xD;
home, he neglected it. For two or three years he suP&#xD;
fered 'all things to reni~n4 ~r to go backward, as if he ~.&#xD;
&#xD;
N&#xD;
&#xD;
were atill absent, whilst he amused himself with books&#xD;
or hunting or fishing, or any idle sport that fell in his&#xD;
way. Thus it was that the expectation of his frieii~s&#xD;
had been disappointed, and his name in the county&#xD;
began to wear the stain of thriftless indolence; for it&#xD;
was thought that his inheritance imposed active duties.&#xD;
His mother felt that he was sinking below the require~&#xD;
tents of his name, and that the son of such abcestons&#xD;
as his-ancestors whom her exaggerated family pride&#xD;
ranked only a little below a line of heroes.-.&#xD;
should imitaa their useful 'and honorable lives. J~ut&#xD;
her affection was too indulgent to chide him and she&#xD;
could only wait,' as she did, for the blood to show itscit&#xD;
When she found that the prospect of war had roused&#xD;
his latent energy, and that he had' volunteered as a&#xD;
soldier, she suffered a violent conflict of emotions:.&#xD;
When he was to be exposed to the hardships and haz~&#xD;
ards of war, a mother's love for an only child, her over~.&#xD;
,weening care for the son whom she had reared so ten.&#xD;
derly. and her lonely widowhood, which might be&#xD;
rendered utterly desolate by the loss of him~ made the&#xD;
sacrifice almost too grievous 'for her to bear. Yet&#xD;
she 'was conscious that to see him remain at home in&#xD;
ignoble sloth, whileothers less nobly obliged to duty,'&#xD;
according to her ideas, marched to the field, would be&#xD;
intolerable to her pride. 'Then she exulted in the high&#xD;
qualities which she attributed to. his action. She was&#xD;
proud to 'feel that the honor of his family was vindi-&#xD;
cated in' him. Her devotion to Virginia, second only&#xD;
to her ruling~ passion, brought her patriotism to. the&#xD;
support of 'her pride. Though every word was as a&#xD;
drop of blood from her heart, yet with unwavering&#xD;
resolution and tearless eyes she encouraged her ~on to&#xD;
pt~rsue ~the path which he .had chosen.&#xD;

&#xD;
When she entered the house and received her vis-&#xD;
itors, she greeted Colonel Fairfax with high-bred but&#xD;
rather antiquated courtesy, almost too ceremonious for&#xD;
friends so intimate. But she kissed Julia with frank,&#xD;
cordial, worn~n1y warmth. "How very glad I am to&#xD;
see you, my dear Julia," she said, "you always make&#xD;
me happy, and you, cokrnel, are kind and thoughtful&#xD;
in visiting me to-day. I ~egret that Hugh is not at&#xD;
home to see you, hut he is absent attending to the&#xD;
business that now engages his time.~~&#xD;
* "~Y~es; his new co~npany,". replied the colonel; "I.&#xD;
may well call it his company, for he has been most&#xD;
energetic and influential in forming it and from many&#xD;
things which I heard yesterday, I am sure he ~vill be&#xD;
Its captain. Men begin already to re&amp;amp;~gnize in him&#xD;
he qualities which, they demand in their leaders.-.&#xD;
decision, courage, ability. I congratulate you, my&#xD;
dear. madam, upon being the mother of such a son."&#xD;
Mrs. Fitzhugh did net reply at once. The subject&#xD;
itself excited feelings which she could not easily con-~&#xD;
trol, and the praises bestowed by her most esteemed&#xD;
friend upon her son melted her pride. Tears filled&#xD;
her eyes, and in spite of her efforts to restrain them,&#xD;
one or two trickled doi~n her cheeks. But she checked&#xD;
them and she did not again, during this interview,&#xD;
give wuy to maternal weakness.&#xD;
"I trust Hugh will do his duty," she said at last&#xD;
with a firm voice.&#xD;
"I am glad," said Julia, "to see you able to leave&#xD;
your room."&#xD;
"This is. no time to be sick, Julia," she replied;&#xD;
men and wOmen, old and young, we are all needed for&#xD;
the defence of Virginia."&#xD;
"That is true," remarked the colonel; "Virginia&#xD;
&#xD;
will be, no doubt, the chief battle-ground of this war,&#xD;
and it may be a war of many battles. I hope we shall&#xD;
be able to save our independence, but it must be at a&#xD;
terrible cost. From the superior power of the North,&#xD;
the South must be by far the greater sufferer. We&#xD;
must expect Virginia to be penetrated by invasion,&#xD;
and, perhaps, completely overrun. Our minds should&#xD;
be prepared for unliniited sacrifice."&#xD;
"Let it be unlimited then," said Mra. Fitz'hugh,&#xD;
"if the North is cruel enough to exact it and if it is&#xD;
necessary to secure our independence. I am ready&#xD;
to begin with the dearest sacrifice a mother can&#xD;
make."&#xD;
"UnfortunMely," replied the colonel, "I have iio&#xD;
son to offer to our country. But you and I and all&#xD;
who ha4 property must be prepared to part with it&#xD;
freel~ Even our homes may be lost for a time. Of&#xD;
cours~, if invasion reaches us, many of our slaves will&#xD;
leave us or possibly be enticed away. In other re-&#xD;
speets, we may hope that those who have been our&#xD;
brethren will conduct the war against according to'&#xD;
civilized and humane usage, but in respect to slaves,&#xD;
the origin of the war leaves no probability of forbear..&#xD;
ance."&#xD;
"Your servants, colonel, wrn not J~eave you surely,&#xD;
so well treated and so judiciously ruled have they&#xD;
been. How can they be better off'?"&#xD;
"Yet many of them doubtless will hasten to the&#xD;
untried pleasures of freedom. They are easily. de-&#xD;
luded. If I thought them capable of judging wisely&#xD;
f&amp;amp;r themselves, .] would not feel justified in holding&#xD;
them as slaves."&#xD;
"I cannot consider them so ungr~tteful or so tin-&#xD;
wise."&#xD;

"We shall see. But if we hold nothing too dear&#xD;
to be given up for the sake of independence, no mis~&#xD;
fortune of war can dismay us."&#xD;
"No Virginian, I am sure," said Mrs. Fitzhugh,&#xD;
"win hold an~ species of property too dear."&#xD;
"At least the women," added Julia, "must not&#xD;
shrink from the sad duties which war imposes ~on our&#xD;
sex. But, even yet, I hope and pray that ~om~gleam&#xD;
of goodness ci: impulse of remorse will avert the&#xD;
doom of bloody conflict from our country."&#xD;
"Well, Julia, you must not forget your old friend&#xD;
when war shall leave me lonely. Visit me often, and&#xD;
whenever you are with me I shall see sunshine in a&#xD;
shady place. CQme, I ~vill not frighten you away&#xD;

CHAPTER Xl. -&#xD;
'rilE VOLUNTEERS.&#xD;
Wxn~ the company of cavalry was organized by&#xD;
the election of officers, Thigh Fitzhugh was chosen&#xD;
captain. The company numbered about a hundred,&#xD;
of ivhcm a majority were young gentlemen, but men&#xD;
' of all classes were incl~4ed. There was one recruit&#xD;
whose name did not appear upon the muster-roll.&#xD;
Doctor Fairfax was resolved, as he said, to have a&#xD;
hand in the fight. But he conceived that, at his age,&#xD;
he might be excused from .the rigid ~efformance of all&#xD;
the arduous duties of a private soldier. He pro.&#xD;
posed, therefore, to conduct the war, for his own part,&#xD;
at his own cost and charge, tw an indepehdent volun~&#xD;
teer, not enlisted, but under the command of captain&#xD;
Fitzhugh. When he proposed this. arrangement to&#xD;
the 4~aptain, that officer thanked him for the honoi'&#xD;
which it implied,. but urged the doctor to permit his&#xD;
friends to procure an appointment for him which&#xD;
would enable him to be more useful, with less fatigue&#xD;
and exposure. But this suggestion was flatly rejected&#xD;
by the belligerent doctor. He declared that his sole&#xD;
purpose was to fight "the Yankees" in the most&#xD;
direct manner, hand to hand and to the death. Be-&#xD;
sides, he was going in free for afrqefightand would&#xD;
not endure the trammels of official obligation. The&#xD;
captain acceded to the arrangement, but he asked,&#xD;
- with a smile-.&#xD;

&#xD;
"how is it, doctor, that you plunge headlong into&#xD;
the war, while y6u preach the policy of peace ?"&#xD;
"The chance of shooting at a~ pack of Northern&#xD;
wolves, captain, would tempt any man from his con-&#xD;
sistency. But you know I am really not inconsistent."&#xD;
"You think the South i~s wrong in its present atti-&#xD;
tude s?"&#xD;
"Not wrong, but rash, captain."&#xD;
"You believe that we shall be beaten."&#xD;
"A good reason for going into the war. Help the&#xD;
weak-always help the weak. When we are con-&#xD;
*   queried it will be the misfortune of the South but the&#xD;
crime of the North. Let me share. the' misfortune&#xD;
rather than the crime."&#xD;
"Your heart is right, doctQr, but I trust you are no&#xD;
prophet."&#xD;
And now everybody manifested a lively interest in&#xD;
the new company. County pride, the popular delight&#xD;
in military parade. , personal regard for volunteers who&#xD;
were* kinsmen, neighbors or friends, and the con-&#xD;
tagious excitement of the young soldiers, fanned the&#xD;
patriotic feeling into a flame of enthusiasm. Enthusi-&#xD;
asm carries with it an assurance of victory. The gen-&#xD;
eral excitement became exultant, joyous. Every one&#xD;
hailed his neighbor as a brother. All were sons of a&#xD;
State which all loved with filial devotion. The citizens&#xD;
regarded the volunteers with a kind of generous envy,&#xD;
as fQrtunate champions of a sacred soil and a glorious&#xD;
cause. Yirginia~-.4he South.-.-IAbe~ty.--~Independene~&#xD;
were words in every mouth, and they sent every man's&#xD;
blood bounding along 'his veins. Women, always&#xD;
prone to sympathy, to social affection and to generous&#xD;
and patriotic emotions, became even more enthusiastic&#xD;
than the men&#xD;
&#xD;
114&#xD;
&#xD;
It was necessary that the company should be ready&#xD;
for active service as soon as possible. To this end, not&#xD;
only the officers and the volunteers but the citizens of&#xD;
both sexes applied themselves with alacrity and indus-&#xD;
try. The men were to be clothed, equipped and&#xD;
m~unted. Tents and ~ragons were to be supplied. It&#xD;
was known that the government could not instantly&#xD;
furnish all the military apparatus needed for the nume-&#xD;
rous army which was spontaneously springing into&#xD;
~xistencethroughout the State. Moreover the citizexis&#xD;
coveted the privilege of supplying their own companies&#xD;
~ot only with things needful but with articles of&#xD;
superfluity-articles which must be abandoned in tb~&#xD;
first active campaign. Colonel Fairfax presented to&#xD;
the company sufficient cloth of cadet grey to make all&#xD;
the uniforms, and canvass enough for their tents.&#xD;
Other wealthy citizens emulated his liberality, either to.&#xD;
the same company or to others then in process of for~&#xD;
nation. To make up the clothing of the volunteers&#xD;
all the women, black and white, brought their needles&#xD;
into play. For these various purposes the men formed&#xD;
themselves into committees, and the women ~met in&#xD;
societies. As Julia Fairfax showed herself not less&#xD;
generous among her sex than her father among men,&#xD;
Roebuck became a great workshop, over which she&#xD;
presided., Many young ladies assembled there daily,&#xD;
and with the help of servants, performed the work of&#xD;
seamstresses or tailors. As the lively spirits of the&#xD;
young lighten their labors, the tongues of these maid-&#xD;
ens kept time with plying needles, and the click of&#xD;
sewing..m~achines mingled with the laughter 9f girl0.&#xD;
The gallant defenders of their country could not&#xD;
neglect a patriotic establishment engaged in their ser-&#xD;
vice, and so the ladie~ were often favored with the&#xD;
&#xD;
115&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb  n="116-117" xml:id="VAC7684-00000059"/>&#xD;
counsel and assistance of the young men. It might&#xD;
happen there that the Power who "rules the court,&#xD;
the camp, the grove," sometimes lurked in the tan-&#xD;
gles of a skein or barbed the point of a needle.&#xD;
The official duty of Captain Fitshugh of course eare&#xD;
ried him to such places, and he did not fail to inspect,&#xD;
now and then, the work over~ which Julia FaiA'ax&#xD;
presided. Between her and himself there was a -new&#xD;
bond of sympathy in the ardent patriotism which ani-&#xD;
*mated both. His eloquence was kindled by themes&#xD;
which warmed her heart. Perhaps he was proud to&#xD;
show her that his life was not idly wasted -when he&#xD;
found an object wor-thy of earnest effort. Perhaps&#xD;
she felt that his awakened energy was in some degree&#xD;
a flattering tribute to her influence The fiery agita-&#xD;
tion of the time, too, tended to inflame all sentiments&#xD;
into passions. Friendship, cherished since childhood,&#xD;
night be quickly kindled to -a. warmer sentiment&#xD;
when sympathy and cii-cumstance &amp;amp;'nspired te fan the&#xD;
fiame.. But if their intercourse during a few days of&#xD;
burning patriotism impairted a passionate glow to thes&#xD;
friendship between Hugh Fitzhugh and Julia Fairfax,&#xD;
they did not acknowledge it to themselves or to each&#xD;
other. Duity, paramount over selfish aims, ther&#xD;
engaged their thoughts.&#xD;
When the company was ready for the march a vast&#xD;
crowd assembled at the village. to take leave of the&#xD;
volunteers. Men and women on the court green, in&#xD;
the street, afoot, on'horseback, in carriages, every-&#xD;
where, jostled one another to get a sight of the gay&#xD;
troop in -ne~ uiforms and on sleek, high-mettled&#xD;
horses, bound to the war. A neat valedictory speech&#xD;
was delivered by'Mr. Williams on behalf of the citi-&#xD;
zens. A blessing was invoked by the 11ev. Mr.&#xD;

,and grey caps waved in return. Hundreds of negroes,&#xD;
imtative patriots, on .the outskirts of the crowd,&#xD;
grinned and babbled and laughed and shouted with&#xD;
uncontrollable enthusiasm. From all the porches,&#xD;
.windows and carriages, and from the court green, white&#xD;
handkerchiefs fluttered incessantly. Under all the&#xD;
clamor of cheers an attentive ear night have heard the&#xD;
sobs of mothers. Tears bedewed the cheeks of sis'-&#xD;
ters, but their handkerchiefs were used, not to dry&#xD;
their eyes, but to wave encouragement to their brave&#xD;
brothers. There were pride, joy, anguish and devo-&#xD;
tion in that farewell. It was not surprising that the&#xD;
captain and his friend, Julia, each felt -an unusual pal-.&#xD;
,pitation of the heart when they w aved their final&#xD;
adieu .&#xD;
The entire march of the company to the scene of&#xD;
war was a popular ovation. The roads were .lined&#xD;
.with men, women and children, black and white, way-&#xD;
ing hats and handkerchiefs, clapping hands, cheering&#xD;
and offering refreshments. Whenever the company&#xD;
halted the people flocked around, to tender congratw.&#xD;
nation, welcome -and hospitality. They contended for&#xD;
the privilege of entertaining every private soldier, as&#xD;
well as the officers, in their houses.- No cottage was&#xD;
too poor to solicit such gues.a No mansion, nor bed,&#xD;
-nor furniture could be too luxurious for t~h use of&#xD;
.those dusty horsemen. No food was too delicate, no&#xD;
.wine too costly to be -set before them. Even their&#xD;
'servants rejoiced with African glee in the abounding&#xD;
.hospitality which they shared. When the company&#xD;
marched on, the gentlemen of the county escorted&#xD;

were presented to them by processions of ladies, and&#xD;
speeches addressed to them, full of grateful praise and&#xD;
eloquent with martial and-patriotic fervor. They fell iii&#xD;
with other companies marching to the field and saw&#xD;
the people everywhere engaged in volunteering -or&#xD;
preparing volunteers for service. The country was&#xD;
unanimous for war and independence.&#xD;
In the meantime other companies were formed in&#xD;
the county for the different arms of-the service. There&#xD;
was talk of forming one under the auspice~ of Albert&#xD;

raising a company of infantry. He talked a great&#xD;
deal on that subject. He rode over the county. He&#xD;
drew up -a paper to be signed. b'y volunteers. He&#xD;
procured a few signatures. He made this his osten-&#xD;
sible -business for several weeks. Either he was not&#xD;
quit~ in earnest or his influence was limited. The&#xD;
number of his signatures ceased ~to increase, though&#xD;
other companies were filled up ~intil the county had&#xD;
furnished m~n~e volunteers than it contained voters.&#xD;
-His project, however, was a deeenV apology for re-&#xD;
maining at home, while he declaimed as a zealous&#xD;
Southerner and took part in proceedings designed to&#xD;
promote the war. He consulted with committees.&#xD;
lie visited the patriotic societies of~adies. lie talked&#xD;
of nothing but war.&#xD;
I-Xe was particularly regular in calling at Roebuck,&#xD;
&#xD;
119&#xD;
always expressing the deepest interest in the work&#xD;
of the ladies who assembled there, and seeking Occa-&#xD;
Sions to converse with Miss Fairfax.: When the work&#xD;
was finished he continued to visit Roebuck 'With equal&#xD;
regularity. From day to day hi~ attentions to Miss&#xD;
Fajifax became more pointed. At length the motive&#xD;
of them could be no longer nhisunderstood: tie was&#xD;
a hwer, almost declared. When Julia made this di~.&#xD;
cover she was surprised and embarrassed. She re-&#xD;
spected him as a fi'iend, and would willingly have&#xD;
spared him the pain of a distinct refusal. She en-&#xD;
deavored with delicate tact to discourage his suit&#xD;
without mortifying his pride. But in view of 'ulterior&#xD;
plans, he was resolved that, in this a~ir, there should&#xD;
be neither uncertainty nor delay. it be~uue appa-&#xD;
rent that he would not be diverted from pressing his&#xD;
suit to a speedy and decisive issue.- -At length, seiz..&#xD;
ing an opportunity when she could neither avoid him&#xD;
nor evade his addresses, he offered her, with studied&#xD;
grace of manner and polish of words, his heart and&#xD;
hand. It she had been less agitated by the distress&#xD;
of inflicting pain, she might have inferred from. his&#xD;
polite self-possessiQn during the scene that his heart&#xD;
Was not to be broken by any decision she would pro~&#xD;
nounce.- iBut, with modest and considerate gentle-&#xD;
ness, she signified to him that, while he had her es-&#xD;
teem,, she c~u1d not reciprocate the sentiments. which&#xD;
he had done her the honor to express. He did not&#xD;
leave her until he ascertained, to his own perfect com.&#xD;
eviction, that it would be useless to renew his suit.&#xD;
Then, with the- same 'urbanity of style, he expressed&#xD;
his disappointment and regret, and afterwards bade&#xD;
her adieu.&#xD;

CHAPTER. XII.&#xD;
MANASBA.&#xD;
Tins narrative is not designed to be a chronicle ~of&#xD;
military events, and it passes now to the first battle&#xD;
of Manassa, only for the purpose of gathering up som6&#xD;
incidents which affected the fortunes of persons who&#xD;
have appeared to the reader. That battle, it is well&#xD;
known, was fought on a h~t day of July, in the year&#xD;
eighteen hundred and sixty-on~ between two con-&#xD;
siderable armies, of which the Federal was twice se&#xD;
numerous as the Confederate. In arms and all equip.&#xD;
ments the superiority was also with the larger host.&#xD;
The skill of the Northern generals, as displayed on&#xD;
that day, was not inferior to that of their adversaries.&#xD;
The Federals advanced to the attack, confident of suo~&#xD;
cess. After a severe conflict of several hours, victory&#xD;
was achieved by the undisciplined valor of the South.&#xD;
em volunteers. Then followed such a rout disper-&#xD;
sion and flight of the Northern army as would have&#xD;
been ludicrous if so much.sufl7ering and terror could&#xD;
ever provoke a smile.&#xD;
During the engagement but little use was' made of&#xD;
cavalry. Captain Fitzhugh's company was for a time&#xD;
posted in a ravine, where they were somewhat shel-&#xD;
tered from the direct fire of the- enemy, while awaiting&#xD;
orders or opportunities for action. In this position,&#xD;
inactive and unable to see the course of the fight,&#xD;
while the roar of battle was deafening, Doctor Fairfax&#xD;
became extremely impatient. He w~s eager to be&#xD;

where blows were dealt aii~d taken. With his. blood&#xD;
at fever heat, h~ chafed at fortune, which denied him&#xD;
~n active part in the grand and exciting drama~XVhen&#xD;
a report came that the brigade of his friend, Brigadier&#xD;
General Bee, was pressed and in danger of being over-&#xD;
whelmed by superior numbers, he could endure in-&#xD;
action no longer. He applied for permission to offer&#xD;
his services to that gallant officer, and it was granted.&#xD;
He found that the situation of Bee's brigade was~ ex-&#xD;
tremely critical, and that every officer of the general's&#xD;
staff was killed, wounded or unhorsed. The general&#xD;
desired him instantly~~6 ride eff with an importu-&#xD;
nate message to be delivered to General Beauregard.&#xD;
The doctor started at high speed through a tempest&#xD;
of shot and shell in which it seemed impossible for a&#xD;
man or horse to live a minute. He had not gone far&#xD;
when he was obliged to check his horse to avoid a&#xD;
number of men who were bearing Brigadier General&#xD;
Bartow, mortally wounded, a short distance to the rear&#xD;
of his shattered brigade. He heard that brave and&#xD;
able man request these around him to lay him down&#xD;
and return to assist and encourage his men. "Look,"&#xD;
exclaimed the dying Bartow, "look at those Virgi-&#xD;
nians under Jackson, standing like a stonewall." The&#xD;
doctor'~ attention, as he passed on, was thus dir&amp;amp;ted&#xD;
to that unflinching brigade of Virginians, and he saw&#xD;
the tall, angular form and handsome features of Jack-&#xD;
son, as he sat upon his horse immovable, with nothing&#xD;
but the gleam of his eyes to indicate the fiery energy&#xD;
which then reposed, like latent lightning. He and his&#xD;
brigade were from that day known by a name derived&#xD;
from the exolamatio.n of Bartow; but not until long&#xD;
afterwards did ~even his own countrymen recognize in&#xD;
Stonewall Jackson the first military genius on the "lou-&#xD;
tinent.&#xD;

With sobae difficulty, and after once riding almost&#xD;
into the enemy's lines, the doctor found General&#xD;
Beauregard, and delivering the message and receiving&#xD;
a reply; he returned to find General Bee; but he had&#xD;
been killed. . Seeking his successor in' command,&#xD;
amidst the hail of bullets and the contusion of broken,&#xD;
bat unyielding ranks, the doctor delivered to him the&#xD;
communication, and at that moment bis own horse&#xD;
was ahot. Being then dismissed to his proper com-&#xD;
mand, he made his way afoot to his company. He&#xD;
called out as he approached-" there is glorious ex~&#xD;
citeinent up there, boyd. But the infernal Yanks&#xD;
have killed my horse. I must have another."&#xD;
"XVliat's this ~" asked one of the men, pointing at the&#xD;
doctor's feet. Casting down his eyes, he saw blood&#xD;
running from ~one of his legs. He drew off his boot&#xD;
and found that'~ he had received a flesh wound, of&#xD;
which until then- he had been unconscious. "NoiV,"&#xD;
he grumbled as he eyed the spot, "I wonder if that&#xD;
Yankee expected to make veal of me by butchering&#xD;
my calf.'~ Chuckling, over his pun, he called for two&#xD;
or tluee handkerchiefs and bandaged his wound. He&#xD;
then renewed his demand for a horse. "No, no, my&#xD;
good friend," said the captain, "you must not mount&#xD;
again to-day." This prohibition was soon enforced by&#xD;
the loss of blood. The 'doctor became 'faint; and lay&#xD;
down upon the ground. He revived, but had to re-&#xD;
main there until the battle was over.&#xD;
When the day had been won,. Captain Fitzhugh's&#xD;
'company was sent, with other cavalry, in pursuit~ of&#xD;
'that panic-stricken mob which had so lately been 'an&#xD;
army with banners. The ~pursuit was a chase. Little&#xD;
resistance was encountered. The mQst frequeift im-&#xD;
pediments were abandoned wagons and other wrecks&#xD;

of a ruined host. Yet a chance shot broke t1~e left&#xD;
arm of Captain Fitzhugh. He continued, neverthe-&#xD;
less, to lead his men, gathering in prisoners and scat~&#xD;
tearing still more widely and wildly the elements of~&#xD;
that disastrous rout. When it was almost night, he&#xD;
discovered that some preparation had been made for&#xD;
resistance at a place where the road passed betweeii&#xD;
swamps and thickets, so that it was a mere defile. On&#xD;
a little eminence which commanded the defile a piece&#xD;
of artillery was pointed in the direction of the pu.rsu-&#xD;
ing cavalry. A Federal captain, finding an aban-&#xD;
doned piece there, had collected, about a hundred&#xD;
stragglers, and made' dispositions to check pursuit.&#xD;
The number of men with Captain Fitzhugh at that&#xD;
time did not exceed t~irenty, the rest of his company&#xD;
having been left in charge of captives. Halting a mo-&#xD;
ment to ascertain the state of affairs in his front, he&#xD;
dashed forward at the head of his little band. The&#xD;
,Federal officer discharged the piece with his own&#xD;
hand, and the grape killed one and wounded two of&#xD;
the Confederates. There was not time, if there was&#xD;
ammunition at hand, to load again. The captain en-&#xD;
deavored to hold his men firm to repel the cavalry, but&#xD;
d'sl~artened by the general rout, they broke and fled.&#xD;
He stood alone, armed only with his sword, and dis-&#xD;
daining to fly or surrender, seemed determined to sell&#xD;
bis life as dearly as possible. ' He fell, dangerously&#xD;
wounded by a pistol-shot, and the cavalry rushed past&#xD;
him.&#xD;
Galloping on, they overtook an ambulance, in which&#xD;
were twQ or three civilians, who had come upon the&#xD;
field to be spectators of the gi'and Union. victory&#xD;
which, on ,the morning' of 'that day, the entire North&#xD;
ha4 expected. Whipping and shouting, they urged&#xD;

the horses to their utmost speed, and the ambulance&#xD;
was bounding from side to side. At its tail hung a&#xD;
pedestrian; and as he ran or was dragged along with&#xD;
his skirts flying, he begged the other fugitives to take&#xD;
him into the vehicle. But he lost his hold, and fell&#xD;
j~ist when the Confederate captain came up, and un-&#xD;
able to cheek his horse, rode over him. The terrified&#xD;
occupants of the ambulance, seeing cavalry so close&#xD;
upon them, leaped out and scampered acrossthe fields.&#xD;
Their horses then stopped.&#xD;
As it was growing dark, Captain Fitzhugh hiilted&#xD;
* and turned back, taking with him the captured ambu-'&#xD;
lance. When he i'eturned to the man who had fallen&#xD;
under his horse's hoofs, that person still lay prostrate&#xD;
on his face, affecting to be dead. One of the Confed-&#xD;
erates, dismounting, and finding him to be alive, with-&#xD;
out a visible woundturned him oVer and commAnded&#xD;
him to get up. "0 Lord, don't kill me; I am a non-&#xD;
combatai~t," he bellowed. "I can see that in the&#xD;
dark," replied the Confederate soldier, "but you must&#xD;
get up and go with us." The captive, then, discover-&#xD;
ing the officer, cried-" Captnin.-.-Colonel---Gefleral---&#xD;
I don't know your stripes, but whatever you are, I ap-&#xD;
peal to you as an officer. Don't let them murder me.&#xD;

you a first-rate notice in my next letter to the&#xD;

"Is the fellow hurt ?" inquired the captain.&#xD;
"No-yes, I think I am-I'm lame here-a dozen&#xD;
horses tramped on my leg."&#xD;
"Take him up and put him into the ambulance."&#xD;
When they moved on, "now," said Captain Fitz-&#xD;
hugh, "we must look after that brave officer who fell&#xD;
by the gun. I fear he is badly wounded, if not&#xD;
killed." They found him indeed living, but neady&#xD;
dead. Lifting him carefully and tenderly, they laid&#xD;
him in the ambulance. Afterwards they took up the&#xD;
body of their comrade who had been killed, and one&#xD;
of those who had been wounded, the other being able&#xD;
to ride his horse. With these and a Federal soldier&#xD;
whom they found lying near the road wounded, they&#xD;
slowly made their way through the darkness to the&#xD;
place where they had left Doctor Fairfax.&#xD;
He lay there asleep. Aroused by the noiSe of their&#xD;
approach, he sat up. and cried out..-." back again,&#xD;
boys ?-have you been to Washington City ?-did you&#xD;
fetch Old Abe with you ?-l~t me see his majesty."&#xD;
But when he was told what the ambulance contained,&#xD;
his levity ceasedand he expressed sincere compassion&#xD;
for the wounded, and sorrow for the dead. When he&#xD;
learned that hi~ captain was wounded, he was full of&#xD;
anxiety. In spite of his own wound, which had become&#xD;
painful, he rose to his feet and offered assistance, first&#xD;
to Captain Fitzhugh, and ~flen to the other wounded.&#xD;
At so late an hour of the night, and after such a&#xD;
battle, it was impossible to make immediate provision&#xD;
for ~ll the wounded. While a surgeon was sent for,&#xD;

&#xD;
Doctor Fairf'ax tendered 'his services as far as they&#xD;
might be rendered with safety to the 'patients) by vir-.&#xD;
tue of his havingonce been a physician. Leaning on&#xD;
a man's arm, he limped to the ambulance, attended to&#xD;
the removal of the wounded, examined their wounds,&#xD;
and spent the remainder of the night in ministering&#xD;
to their relief. The Federal captain, as the person in&#xD;
most danger, received his principal care. Last of all,&#xD;
when daylight1 appeared, he turned his attention to&#xD;
Campbell, the reporter-~ or correspondent of the&#xD;
"Comet," who had recovered from his fright, and in&#xD;
full possession of his faculties, sat under a tree, leaning&#xD;
against the trunk, and smoking a cigar. His leg still&#xD;
gave him some pain, and he thought it was politic to&#xD;
make the most of his wound. The gray light, when&#xD;
the doctor approached him, revealed a person in holi&#xD;
day attire, bedizened with jewelry, but soiled with&#xD;
dirt: When he displayed his wound, the doctor curtly&#xD;
said, "a bruise-4-nothing but a bruise," and was walk..&#xD;
ing away.&#xD;
"I say, doctor," exclaimed Campbell, "you are not&#xD;
in1 a hurry, are you ?"&#xD;
"I believe I hav&amp;amp; nothing more to do just now."&#xD;
"Oblige me then by sitting down beside me. I&#xD;
know you are tired, and I wish to have a little chat&#xD;
wijh you."&#xD;
"Certainly, sir," said the doctor, sitting down upon&#xD;
the ground.&#xD;
Have a cigar? You don't smoke? Then take a&#xD;
drink. You are not very well. I have a flask here in&#xD;
my pocket.. You won't drink? The brandy is ex-&#xD;

"You will be equally polite, of course, and acknow-&#xD;

nature has made unequal, you have only to degrade&#xD;

"Why should we wrangle over questions which the&#xD;
sword is to decide i?"&#xD;
"Then let us talk about something else. I love to&#xD;
talk."&#xD;
Campbell then launched forth in a long harangue&#xD;
which kept Doctor Fairfax listening with amusement&#xD;
and wonder. He talked of the battle, of his family,,&#xD;
of the Federal generals, whom he called by their&#xD;
Christian names, as familiar acquaintances, of news-&#xD;
papers, of strategy, of boots, of ladies, of foreign&#xD;
nations, of everything, with a volubility that knew&#xD;
"no retiring ebb." His style was similar to that which&#xD;
he used in corresponding with the "Comet." He&#xD;
&#xD;
4&#xD;
&#xD;
introduced every topic, as it were, with a great head..&#xD;
ing displayed in capitals. He magtiified petty details&#xD;
with astounding ad         He spurted out every&#xD;
sentence as if it was designed to make~a sensation, and&#xD;
he gesticulated inteijections and marks of exclamation.&#xD;
lie tripped through the gravest questions with a&#xD;
jaunty, flippant, knowing air. His statements of facts,&#xD;
tricked out to shine, were marvellous travesties of&#xD;
truth. He predicted futt~e events like a prophet or a&#xD;
spiritual rapper. He made it his business, as he&#xD;
modestly observed, to know everything.&#xD;
Dr. Fairfax had found a character quite new to him.,&#xD;
Surely, he thought, nothing like this ever grew south&#xD;
of Mason and Dixon's line. What impudence! he&#xD;
said to himself; as the harangue went on: what flip..&#xD;
pancy! what prevention! what vulgarity of soul!&#xD;
what ambitious and meretricious rhetoric! what a&#xD;
liar! Thus with inward comment he sat studying&#xD;
this novel specimen of humanity. The interest of the&#xD;
study inspired him with a sort of liking for his sped-&#xD;
men. He began io covet it as a natural curiosity.&#xD;
This, he thought, was "a Yankee of the Yankees."~ He&#xD;
hated .that tribe in the mass, but individually, he never&#xD;
could hate any man. Finally lie interrupted the dis-&#xD;
course.&#xD;
"Come, Bombyx, my Northern light, my polar star,&#xD;
my epitome of all Northern intelligence, my live&#xD;
Yai~kee, come9 let us look out for breakfast."&#xD;
"A capital thought, doctor, ha, ha, ha !"&#xD;
After feasting his communicative guest with'the best&#xD;
scraps he could scrape together at such a time and&#xD;
place, Doctor Fairfax again visited the Federal officer.&#xD;
lie learned from him that he was Captain Ti'em~.ine,&#xD;
and that he had been an officer in the regular army of&#xD;

the United States before the war. He appeared to be&#xD;
a gentleman, and his conversation..increased the inter-&#xD;
est which his suffering awakened. But the doctor did&#xD;
not suffer him to talk much, and as soon as it was.&#xD;
practicable, he had the captain, as well as the -other&#xD;
wounded, provided with comfortable cots and tents&#xD;
and with proper attendance. The drenching rain that&#xD;
day fell on many~unsheltered men, the living and the&#xD;
dead, the wounded, the weary and the sick, on .the&#xD;
wide plain of Manassa.&#xD;

CHAPTER XIII.&#xD;
&#xD;
A DUEL.&#xD;

I&#xD;
.1&#xD;
&#xD;
IN the evening of that rainy day they buried the&#xD;
soldier who had been killed, as already mentioned, by&#xD;
a grape-shot while engaged in the pursuit. At this&#xD;
early period of the wvar death had not lost its awe by&#xD;
familiarity. When single man of a company fell in&#xD;
battle, the event impressed the minds of the survivors&#xD;
with almost as much soiemnity as 'a death at home&#xD;
before the war. The body of this soldier was followed&#xD;
by most of his comrades in the company, with every&#xD;
demonstration of respect that circumstances permitted,&#xD;
to a -small grove of stunted trees where a place of&#xD;
burial had been selected for some of the Confederate&#xD;
dead. The melancholy solemnity of the scene was&#xD;
deepened by the gloom of the slky and of the neigh-&#xD;
boring battle-field, yet encumbered with dead and&#xD;
dying. When they had fulfilled their sad duty the&#xD;
men in attendance were about to march away, when&#xD;
Abraham Marlin, the preaching cooper, stepped for-&#xD;
ward and touching his cap, requested permission to&#xD;
say a few words. H~e remarked it was a pity any&#xD;
human being should be buried without some religious&#xD;
service. He knew a chaplain could not be h ad when&#xD;
so many dying men required their attendance on them.&#xD;
But he thought some one might offer up an humble&#xD;
prayer at the grave. This suggestion was received&#xD;
with silent acquiescence, but all eyes looked around&#xD;
for the person who night perform the proposed&#xD;
&#xD;
ISS&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb  n="134-135" xml:id="VAC7684-00000068"/>&#xD;
service. Abraham, seeing that no other person was&#xD;
willing, felt that it was incumbent on himself to dis-&#xD;
charge the duty which he had proposed. He there-&#xD;
fove walked to the head of the grave, took off his cap,&#xD;
lifted up his hands and began to pray. In common&#xD;
affairs which belonged to every-day liTh he was sensi-&#xD;
ble and his language was direct and simple. But&#xD;
when, from religious zeal, he aspired to performances&#xD;
which exercise .the higher faculties of educated men,&#xD;
he floundered into absurdities of thought and lan-&#xD;
guage which were almost profane in spite of his sincere&#xD;
piety. On this occasion he soon rambled into a kind&#xD;
of funeral discourse upon the life and character of the&#xD;
deceased, such as can scarcely be imagined without&#xD;
the aid of a specimen:&#xD;
"We lay his mortal body in the dust-leastwaYs it&#xD;
was dust before the rain. We pray that his immortal&#xD;
soul may go where the wicked cease from troubling&#xD;
and the weary are at rest, that is if it ain't popish to&#xD;
pray for his soul when he's dead and buried, and if it&#xD;
is, we ax pardon and take it back. He was a mighty&#xD;
* good yonng man as we knowed him at home. He&#xD;
was a mighty brave soldier. He fou't in this 'ere&#xD;
great battle agin the great company, the mighty army&#xD;
that come out of the North parts which we've whip-&#xD;
ped and put to flight, only a good many of' 'em was&#xD;
killed and wouldn'tt fly. He was killed suddenly in&#xD;
pursuing! of 'em when the big fight was done fou't, and&#xD;
it was a pity any more men was killed so~ late in the&#xD;
evening . He' fou't in that battle when'7h~e wasn't able&#xD;
to fight by good rights, because he'd been running' off&#xD;
~with chronic diree for most a month. But he wouldn't&#xD;
stay back. He was a willing' and a brave man, and he&#xD;
wood a f~u't agin in' the next big battle, eP any mOre&#xD;
&#xD;
mighty armies come out of the North parts, providing'&#xD;
the diree didn't take him off in the eend."&#xD;
But after some time the pious cooper dropped this&#xD;
rambling discourse and gave, in homely but sensible&#xD;
language, expression to those genuine emotions which&#xD;
good men feel when they stand in the presence of&#xD;
death a~d before the Ju4ge of quick and dead. When&#xD;
in the midst of his uncouth dialect his memory sup-&#xD;
plied some of the affecting phrases 'which the scrip-.&#xD;
tures lend to the expression of personal piety or the&#xD;
sublime imagery with which they allude to the worlI&#xD;
beyond the tomb, he seemed almost eloquent. His&#xD;
pathetic earnestness melted some of the soldiers around&#xD;
him to tears. They indeed did not smile at those&#xD;
absurdities by which he made sacred things appear&#xD;
mean and ridiculous, for besides the sadness of the&#xD;
scene, they respected the preaching ~cooper as a sin-&#xD;
cere, faithful and brave man. His piety silenced their&#xD;
censure, even when hi~ presumption might have&#xD;
shocked them.&#xD;
An hour after the conclusion of this scene, Captain&#xD;
Palmer, the quarter-master, sat in the door of a tent'&#xD;
conversing with a person~who was present battle grave'&#xD;
about the strange proceedings of the extempore chap-.&#xD;
lain. "Abraham Marlin is a pestilent old fool," said&#xD;
Palmer, in a loud tone. "Was that meant for my&#xD;
ear ?" asked a young man who was passing the tent&#xD;
and who turned abruptly to Palmer.&#xD;
"' Who are you ?" rejoined~ the latter.&#xD;
"I am the son of~Abraham Marlin."&#xD;
"O,.Mai'k Marlin!' I've heard of you.' I repeat&#xD;
what I said, and this time for your ears. Abraham&#xD;
Marlin is a pestih~nt old fool."&#xD;
"It is false, and no gentleman would say such a&#xD;
thing about any man to his son."&#xD;

"Sir, you are a private. I am an officer."&#xD;
"I knew that, or I could not have answered you&#xD;
with words."&#xD;
"Do you threaten me, sir ?"&#xD;
"As you talk about your rank, I can say no more;&#xD;
but I will say again, you are ,no gentle ."&#xD;
"I'll have you punished, sir ; I'll have you punished&#xD;
for your insolence."&#xD;
" Then you must e4ose yourself," said Mark Marlin&#xD;
as he walked away.&#xD;
* Palmer had fallen into this foolish altercation; be-&#xD;
cause he had conceived the absurd idea 'that, among.&#xD;
soldiers, he must support a reputation for soldierly&#xD;
bearing by blustering rudeness~ and feared he might&#xD;
sink in the estimation of his companion if he made&#xD;
any concession to Mark Marlin, after proclaiming his&#xD;
opinion of Mark's father.&#xD;
Later in the evening Palmer was in the tent of&#xD;
BaxEer, the commissary. That functionary was pre-&#xD;
sent, acting as host, and his guests, besides Palmer,&#xD;
were Dr. Frank, a surgeon, a young lieutenant, Pot-&#xD;
ter, and two or three other officers. They all sat on*&#xD;
stools or the host's bunk. ~~On a rough box, which&#xD;
served for a tahie, stood a bottle, two tin cups and a&#xD;
tallow candle stuck in a block of wood. Baxter was&#xD;
entertaining the others with noisy hilarity that&#xD;
smacked oI~ the bottle. J)r. Frank was silent, sober&#xD;
and surly. He was a bachelor of fifty, with heavy,*&#xD;
grey mustache and shaggy brows, lie had -served&#xD;
long in the Federal navy, and. was reputed to be very&#xD;
skilful in his profession. He was as gentle as a&#xD;
woman with the sick, but crusty with men who pre-&#xD;
sumed to enjoy go9d health. He was a sworn enemy&#xD;
of all soldier&amp;amp; who attempted to shirk from duty&#xD;

by feigning sickness. He had a habit which made&#xD;
his -scanty conVersation consist mai~ily of oaths.&#xD;
"Drink, gentlemen," said Baxter, setting an .exam~&#xD;
pie, "drink. I can recommend my commissary stores.&#xD;
This Co federated whiskey is an excellent summer&#xD;
drink. It would cool a fever. - It is better than sher-&#xD;
bet for this warm weather. Doctor Frank, you shall&#xD;
take some of my medicinal water."&#xD;
The doctor growled out a refusal with an oath.&#xD;
"Don't swear, doctor, don't," said Baxter. "That&#xD;
reminds me, gentlemen, you have been talking of the&#xD;
preaching cooper. Now I'll tell you an anecdote of a&#xD;
preacher and Doctor Frank. The doctor, you know,&#xD;
swears more oaths than the Yankees. prescribe to the&#xD;
rebels-if that's possible. Well, a few days ago,&#xD;
being scarce of tents, I suppose, they billetted a chap-&#xD;
lain on our swearing friend, and the two have had to&#xD;
sleep undor the same canvass. It is the surgeon's&#xD;
habit to stand at the door of his tent at an early hour&#xD;
every morning, to hear the applications of soldiers for&#xD;
certificates of ill health to excuse them from fatigue&#xD;
duty for the day. He thinks most ofthem are shirk..&#xD;
ing, and he curses those fellows high and low, in or-&#xD;
der, as he says, to maintain discipline. Two~ or three&#xD;
mornings since, I was passing and saw the doctor at&#xD;
his levee. He had been up all night with a poor&#xD;
devil who threatened to slip through his fingers, and&#xD;
his nerves, no doubt, Were more irritable than usual.&#xD;
He believed that the entire bevy of applicants were&#xD;
shirkers. lie looked at them with brows like a jagged&#xD;
thunder-cloud. He compressed his lips ~as if he was&#xD;
holding in a young earthquake. Suddenly he turned&#xD;
and looked in at the bunk where the, chaplain lay.&#xD;
~1'hen he turned to scowl on the shirkers. Again be&#xD;

&#xD;
peered in at the chaplain, ai*L again turned to the&#xD;
waiting crowd. Then burst out the earthquake.&#xD;
'By-,' he exclaimed, 'I will swear-I must main-&#xD;
tain discipline-I have not cursed these fellows for a&#xD;
week, and now they are all shirking-what's a&#xD;
preacher? he's only a man-'I will swear.' Well, he&#xD;
swore. All the oaths that he had corked up for a&#xD;
week, from respect to the clergy, rushed out in one&#xD;
volume. He scattered that squad of shirkers faster&#xD;
and farther than the Yanks were routed yesterday."&#xD;
The surgeon swore a little, and the. others laughed,&#xD;
except Palmer.&#xD;
"Why don't you laugh, Palmer? That was a good&#xD;
story," said Baxter.&#xD;
But the quarter-master, perhaps, was not in a merry&#xD;
mood that evening, and he had a recollection of one&#xD;
of Baxter's practical jokes that disinclined him to ap-&#xD;
plaud the commissary's wit. He replied&#xD;
"I am not bound to laugh, am I ?"&#xD;
"Everybody but a churl laughs at a good joke in&#xD;
jovial company.&#xD;
* "Profanity does n~t amuse me.&#xD;
"0, Puritan 1" cried Baxter, with a sneer.&#xD;
"At all events, I am not a buffoon," retorted Palmer&#xD;
with a scowl.&#xD;
Baxter instanay rose and slapped Palmer's Thee&#xD;
with his open hand. The latter stood a moment&#xD;
white with i'age, and then saying, "you shall hear fron~&#xD;
me, sir," he flung himself out of the tent.&#xD;
"Let's take another drink," said Baxter, resuming&#xD;
his seat. But his visitors declined the. invitation and&#xD;
took leave of him. They anticipated the consequences&#xD;
of the quarrel. They condemned the conduct of&#xD;
Baxter, but they did not esteem Palmer. They con-&#xD;

sidered that the affair between them had proceeded&#xD;
too far to be stopped. Blood for a blow, was a maxim.&#xD;
that permitted no pacification at that stage b~* the me-&#xD;
diation of friends, according to their notions. Nothing&#xD;
was left for them but to stand aside, and let the affair&#xD;
take its course. When they had left him, Baxter sat&#xD;
looking at his bottle for some time, and then said to&#xD;
himself-..." Now, there's poor Corporal Jones would&#xD;
be the better of a few drops of that liquor. I'll go to&#xD;
see him. I expect he'll die to-night. I'll help him&#xD;
to go off the hooks easy." He filled the bottle and&#xD;
started out with it in his hand.&#xD;
It was near midnight when Palmer entered the tent&#xD;
of Lieutenant Potter, who was then asleep, and asked&#xD;
him to get up. "Mr. Potter," said~he with agitation,&#xD;
"I want your advice."&#xD;
"About what O?~~ said Potter, turning over and&#xD;
yawning.&#xD;
"About that affair."&#xD;
"Oh-..-ah--.yes," replied Potter, rubbing his eyes,&#xD;
you mean that affair with Baxter," and ~ue yawned&#xD;
again.&#xD;
"Yes. What ought I to do ?"&#xD;
"Don't you know ?"&#xD;
"Really I do not."&#xD;
"Then you are a fool," said Potter, and he turned&#xD;
over to sleep again.&#xD;
"But, Mr. Potter, indeed you must advise me. I&#xD;
am in trouble. I have no friend here to consult with&#xD;
-do advise me."&#xD;
"Didn't you threaten that he should hear from&#xD;
you ?"&#xD;
"Well?"&#xD;
"Didn't he strike you ?"&#xD;

&#xD;
"Yes."&#xD;
"Don't you intend to challenge him V'&#xD;
"It is on that point I want advice.' I am consci~.&#xD;
entiously opposed to duelling."&#xD;
"Did you ever tell anybody so before ?"&#xD;
"Well-no-I believe not."&#xD;
"You have allowed it to be understood that you ac-&#xD;
- knowledge ~the code ~"&#xD;
'"Perhaps I have, thoughtlessly."&#xD;
"Then you are thoughtful too late. Ifa gentleman&#xD;
is only known to be religious and 'consistent, he may~&#xD;
decline a duel without disgrace: Such a man is sel-&#xD;
dom insulted and never insults. But if a man becomes&#xD;
conscientious only when there is a pistol in view, peo-&#xD;
ple draw ugly inferences."&#xD;
"' You think then that I must challenge him ?"&#xD;
"I have not said that. I have not undertaken to&#xD;
advise you. We are almost strangers to ea9h other.&#xD;
1 can have nothing to do with a duel without resign-&#xD;
ing my commission. You must excuse n~e."&#xD;
"To whem can I apply. I am much distressed."&#xD;
"I can find you an adviser. Bullitt, from Rich-&#xD;
mond, is now in camp. He~ is the very man for affairs'&#xD;
* of honor. He knows all about them. He studies&#xD;
them. lie practices them. he'd rather be invite~1 to.&#xD;
a duel than to a dinner. He will be glad to advise&#xD;
you and act for you too, as your friend. He is like a&#xD;
Quaker, a friend to all the world. Come along, I'll&#xD;
introduce you to him."&#xD;
During this speech Potter got up and put on his&#xD;
clothes. At the end of it he started out of the tent,&#xD;
followed by Palmer, who felt but little encouraged by&#xD;
the character of the friend, he was about to meet, as&#xD;
sketched by his guide. He was dragged onward,&#xD;
&#xD;
RO]~BUOK.                 141&#xD;
however, by the circumstances of his position and by&#xD;
his fear of losing caste among young men of spirit.&#xD;
Through the mud and darkness Potter marched on&#xD;
inexorably, and Palmer trudged after him in rueful&#xD;
silence. At length they arrived at a tent 'in which&#xD;
Mr. Bullitt, the man of honor, was lodging as the guest&#xD;
of friend. Potter called him, and as soon as he was&#xD;
awake, signified to him that an officer desired some&#xD;
private conversation with him. With great alertness&#xD;
he sprang from the cot on which he slept and briskly&#xD;
stepped out of tl~e tent. rotter announced his own&#xD;
name, for they could not distinguish each other in the&#xD;
dark, and then introduced Captain Palmer. lie in~&#xD;
formed Mr. BullitV that the captain 'was involved in a&#xD;
delicate affair and' needed a friend. "I have taken&#xD;
the liberty," he added, "to recommend him to you and&#xD;
to assur~ him that you would not' refuse him the favor&#xD;
he desires."&#xD;
"On the contrary, it will afford me pleasure to act&#xD;
as a friend of any friend of yours, Mr. Potter," said&#xD;
J3ullitt.&#xD;
"Then, gentlemen, I may leave you together; good&#xD;
night, gentlemen."&#xD;
i~3ullett, by ,a few rapid and decisive questIons, drew&#xD;
from Palmer the material oircumstance~, and then&#xD;
bounced into the tent, where he got a match, lighted a&#xD;
candle, drew forth 'paper, pen and'i~ik, placed them&#xD;
on a board upon hi~ knee and began to write. Palmer&#xD;
could then see that he was a small, withered mail,&#xD;
with no clothes on him but a shirt-and pantaloons, i~&#xD;
r~d night-cap, with a huge tassel, and muddy bo&amp;amp;ts,&#xD;
hastily pulled on so as to carry his wrinkjed panta-&#xD;
loons with them up to his knee~ He had a peaked&#xD;
nose, little' gli8tening black eyes and a long~ heavy&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb  n="142-143" xml:id="VAC7684-00000072"/>&#xD;
142             llOEflU.OlC~&#xD;
mustache, which, like his hair, had been black b~ut was&#xD;
somewhat grizzled. He moved' with quick, decisive&#xD;
energy, and wrote with furious rapidity. In a few&#xD;
minutes he produced two documents, and requested&#xD;
Captain Palmer to sign them. One was a resignation&#xD;
of his commission -a~ quarter-master, and the other a&#xD;
peremptory challenge to Baxter. Palmer read them&#xD;
over and signed them, not knowing what else to&#xD;
do. He had expected his adviser to offer him some&#xD;
advice, but the artificer of duels had not imagined that&#xD;
there could be a doubt in the mind of any one 'as to&#xD;
the proper course to be pursued.&#xD;
"Now, Captain Palmer," said his friei~d, "Twill&#xD;
forward your resignation to the adjutant and I will&#xD;
deliver the note to Captain Baxter forthwith. You&#xD;
can lie down and refresh yourself with sleep. I will ..&#xD;
call you when you are needed."&#xD;
Palmer was not very sleepy at that moment. He&#xD;
looked at Bullitt while he jerked on his coat, flung&#xD;
aside liis~ night-cap and covered his head with an old-&#xD;
fashioned cocked hat, which it was his fancy to wear.&#xD;
They then walked together to the 1uarter-master'~&#xD;
tent, and Bullitt, having obtained the information&#xD;
necessary for finding Baxter, went on alone, while hi~&#xD;
principal stood wondering how soon that brisk step oI&#xD;
his second would bring him back with an announce-&#xD;
ment that all things were ready, ana Captain Palmer&#xD;
was to be shot at without more delay. Bullitt found&#xD;
the commissary'~ quarters, but Baxter was not there.&#xD;
After satisfying himself of that fact, the faithful, friend,&#xD;
not knowing how to find the adversary except by&#xD;
waiting for him to return, began to pace backward&#xD;
and forward before his tent like a sentinel. He kept~&#xD;
up that oscillating march with exemplary perseverance&#xD;
&#xD;
flO13~BUCK.                  143&#xD;
&#xD;
until day was breaking. He then discovered a man&#xD;
passing not far from him, and approaching the passen-&#xD;
ger, he inquired ;if that person knew where Captain&#xD;
Baxter might be found: "Come with me," replied&#xD;
the man,, who happened to be Doctor Frank, on his.&#xD;
way to visit Corporal Jones. Bullitt followed, until&#xD;
they arrived at the entrance of a tent, where they&#xD;
paused in consequence of what they saw and heard.&#xD;
Within the tent Baxter was standing over a cot occu-&#xD;
pied bya sick man, and as he arranged the pillow, he&#xD;
said-" now, Jones, I am going to leave you, old fel..&#xD;
low. The surgeon will be here in a few minutes."&#xD;
"0, captain," said the sick man, feebly, "I am so&#xD;
much obliged to you for staying with me all night.&#xD;
You have done me so much good. I had not laughed&#xD;
before since I was taken. sick."&#xD;
"You are going to be well soon. Keep up your&#xD;
spirits. I'll put this bottle under your head to keep&#xD;
your spirits up. This is the great medicine after all.&#xD;
It beats the doctors and the quack pills to boot. I&#xD;
would have been under the ground long ago if I had&#xD;
not been drunk half my life-or half drunk all my life.&#xD;
I am not sure which is the best division of time. I&#xD;
believe if a man was kept drunk all day and half drunk&#xD;
all night it would be a pretty even divide. Don't you&#xD;
feel better now  "&#xD;
The patient laughed. / The surgeon then went in,&#xD;
and Baxter, after making a brief report of~ the sick&#xD;
man's condition during the night, went out of thetent.&#xD;
Bullitt met him, touched his cocked hat, and said,&#xD;
"Captain Baxter, I believe'? Mr. Bullitt. I am the&#xD;
bearer of a message for you, sir. May I see you at&#xD;
your quarters'?"&#xD;
"I am going there~ But you may save time by&#xD;

"I won't wait. ]I've'been up all night and I must&#xD;

"You will not go i~o the field alone ?"'&#xD;
"I hope to see you there, if not Palmer. Come&#xD;
along."&#xD;
"But, sir, this is irregular-absolutely contrary to&#xD;
all rule. I protest"-&#xD;
"Mr. B~ullitt.--I think you called yourself Bullitt ?"&#xD;

"Stop, captain," cried Bullitt, following him as he&#xD;
Walked off, "this is most irregular. There is no pre..&#xD;

"All right. Be quick."&#xD;
"I'll ~hring my pistols.' I always carry a beautiful&#xD;
pair."&#xD;
- "Very well. We'll choose between yours and&#xD;
mine.&#xD;
When Bullitt made known the arrangement to&#xD;
Palmer, the latter was fluttered by the precipitancy,&#xD;
of action, and objected to the part assigned to Bullitt,&#xD;
-as neutralizing his second. On that ground he was&#xD;
inclined to break off the affair. But Bullitt declared&#xD;
that it could not be broken ofF without everlasting dis-&#xD;
grace. It must go on, ev.en in ihis irregular fashion..'&#xD;
Being' thus pressed, and having neither experience&#xD;
nor counsellor to guide him to a loop-hole of retreat,&#xD;
Palmer ceased to object. When the pistols had been&#xD;
~rooured, he walked to the appointed field, escorted&#xD;
by his second-or halPsecond-and attended by Doc-&#xD;
tor Frank, with a very alarming ease of instruments&#xD;
under his arm. When.they reached the ground Bax~--&#xD;
ter was there, lying asleep on the grass. After waking&#xD;
him, Bullitt selected the pistols, chose the ground and&#xD;
measured the distance. With a comical 'air ~of per-&#xD;
pl'eicity he tossed up with himself for the choice of&#xD;
position, and arranged with himself'all the prelimina-&#xD;
ries in the most formal 'manner. He was repeatedly&#xD;
embarrassed, by his neutral or equivocal- relation to&#xD;
the parties. After placing them in position, and giv-&#xD;
ing them their weapons, he paused and gravely ad-&#xD;
dressed them.&#xD;
"Gentlemen, I must now formally protest in pre-&#xD;
sence of you both, as I have protested to you seve-,&#xD;
rally, that the mode of proceeding adopted on this oc-&#xD;
casion is entirely irregular. I have acceded to. it only&#xD;
from necessity. I will not be responsible for the con-&#xD;
&#xD;
flOEBUCK.             .    14~&#xD;
sequences, and I protest that this case shali never be&#xD;
drawn into precedent with my consent."&#xD;
When he gave the word, the combatants fired al-&#xD;
most simultaneously. They both remaine&amp;amp;standing&#xD;
after the exchange of shots. Bullitt, looking first at&#xD;
one, and then at the other, from his post, which was&#xD;
equi-distant from them, was again perplexed., He&#xD;
deemed it his duty to approach his principal, but&#xD;
which priiw~ipal first? One reason.came into his head&#xD;
for rendering his first attention to Palmer, but another&#xD;
reason immediaI~ely claimed that preference for Bax-&#xD;
ter. He started towards the latter, but halted and&#xD;
turned towards the former. After one or two more&#xD;
such zigzags, he threw up his hands in despair, and&#xD;
darted at Baxter~ -&#xD;
"Are you hurt, 'Captain Baxter ?" he cried.&#xD;
"No," said Baxter, quietly, "neither of us is hurt.&#xD;
I raised the dust from his pant~, but my ball struck&#xD;
the ground ten feet beyond him. His ball struck that&#xD;
weed aboi1t a yard from me. I saw it shake."&#xD;
Bullitt Avent to Palmer, who, though not very cour-&#xD;
ageous, had pride enough to carry him thus far&#xD;
though the scene with a fair show of' firmness.&#xD;
Having ascertained that he was not hurt, the impar..&#xD;
tial second retired a few paces 'to consult with him-&#xD;
self as to the proper. step forhim next to ti~ke. While&#xD;
he pondered, he was reloading the weapons.' Sad-&#xD;
denly he was startled by a cry from Palmer.-" a con-&#xD;
stable, a constable." Repeating these words, Palmer&#xD;
started from his post, walking rapidly. "&amp;amp;opg" said&#xD;
Bullitt, "there is no constable about here !" But&#xD;
Palmer quickened his pace to a run, while the second&#xD;
shouted after him frantically.-" stop; come back, fool,&#xD;
coward, poltroon, come back, I say." But faster and&#xD;

&#xD;
faster the fugitive ran, Ufltji he disappeared in a wood.&#xD;
"Why, it's Hugh Fitzhugh," said Baxter, pointing&#xD;
at a man who was approaching them, and who had&#xD;
been seen first by Palmer. Some duty had brought&#xD;
Captain Fit~liugh near enough to the spot to hear the&#xD;
sound of the pistols, and thinking it was some alarm&#xD;
or 'irregularity of pickets, he hastened in the direction&#xD;
of the sound to learn th~ cause. As he came for-&#xD;
ward, Bullitt said-." Captain Baxter, I' am deeply&#xD;
mortified at the conduct of my first principal..' But,&#xD;
* of course, I take his place now. With that view you&#xD;
will excuse me, I am sure, for reassuringg entire my&#xD;
original relation as his second. I trust, sir," he con-&#xD;
tinued, addressing Captain Fitzhngh, "although I&#xD;
have not the honor of your acquaintance, you will&#xD;
oblige us by performing for Captain Baxter and my..&#xD;
* self the part which I had undertaken to perform for&#xD;
him and Captain Palmer. It is very irregular, I ad-&#xD;
mit, but necessity may excuse it. Captain Baxter, does&#xD;
this meet your approbation?"&#xD;
"What does all this mean  " inquired Fitzhugh.&#xD;
"ill tell you," responded. Baxter ;." this geutlemiui&#xD;
.-.-.Mr. Bullitt, Captain Fitzhugh-desires to exchange&#xD;
shbts with me and' I have no objection. You will&#xD;
stand by and' see fair play."&#xD;
"I'll do no such thing. This follymust stop here."&#xD;
"Of coui'se," ~said Bullitt, "such an affair must&#xD;
come to an untimely end when a third party steps in&#xD;
t~ interfere with it. But I protest "-.-.~-&#xD;
"Never mind your protest," interrupted Baxter,&#xD;
"let's go to breakfast."&#xD;
"Now," said Fitzhugh, after he had, by inquiring&#xD;
of Baxter, learned some particulars of the affiuir, "let&#xD;
us agree to say nothing of Palmei~s couduot. Jt&#xD;
&#xD;
ROEBUCK.&#xD;

would injure him and do no good. He is new t~&#xD;
such t.hings."                             ~..&#xD;
"0, he has carried the matter to e m - hi3 heels,"&#xD;
replied Baxter, "but I shall say no' in about it."&#xD;
"I am not sure what I shall do about this affair,"&#xD;
said Bullitt, testily; "the whole business has been so&#xD;
irregular that I don't know whether I shall allow any&#xD;
gentleman to allude to it' in my presence withQut giv-&#xD;
ing me satisfaction. I must look up the autkoritie.&#xD;
before I commit myself~"'&#xD;
The three walked together towards the camp, an&amp;amp;&#xD;
after gqing some distance, Baxter exclaimed-." the&#xD;
surgeon! we have forgotten the doctor." He h6'sa~&#xD;
in the clump of trees during the proceedings. Tmii~&#xD;
big back, they saw him marching along behind then~&#xD;
and looking very~surly. The~r waited for hix~i, and as&#xD;
lie approached, they heard him growling and cursing.&#xD;
'4llumbug," he grunted~ "humbug......no need of ~&#xD;
surgeon for this party "-with an appendix. of oaths.&#xD;
They spoke to him and endeavored to apologize~ for&#xD;
leaving him, but he gave neither heed nor z~epIy.&#xD;
lie marched past, muttering the same contemptuous&#xD;
oaths.&#xD;
Palmer did not halt until he found himself five or&#xD;
six miles from the camp. Then he sat down upon a&#xD;
log and held a council in his own bosom. He re-&#xD;
flected that the failure of his matrimonial project had&#xD;
cut the principal tie whi~h bound him to the Southern&#xD;
cause, and now if he returned to the army, he thought&#xD;
he must encounter disgrace on account of this morn~&#xD;
~ing's proceedings. His commission and his character.&#xD;
were gon:e. lie began to recall the obligations of&#xD;
birth and to 'spccuiat~ upon the chances. of improving&#xD;
his condition by transferring himself to the North.&#xD;

CHAPTER XIV.&#xD;
ROEBUCK AFTER M.ANASSA.&#xD;
* FROM various causes the camp at Manassa proved&#xD;
to be unfavorable to the recovery of the sick and&#xD;
* wounded. In two or three days after the battle,&#xD;
Doctor Fairfax became satisfied that if he remained&#xD;
there his wound, already showing unpleasant symp-.&#xD;
toms, would be slow to heal, and he decided to return&#xD;
home for a time. Not being an enlisted soldier, he&#xD;
obtained permission without difficulty. In the mean-&#xD;
time he had been almost constantly with Captain Tre-&#xD;
maine. Sympathy and respect rapidly ripened into&#xD;
friendship for that gallant and unfortunate gentleman.&#xD;
* The doctor became so warmly interested in his re-&#xD;
covery that he desired to take him t~ his own house,&#xD;
where he mig~it have the benefit of such nursing and&#xD;
care as a camp could not afford. . When he invited the&#xD;
* captain to accompany him the wounded prisoner was&#xD;
very grateful. Through the exertions of Doc~r Fair-&#xD;
fax and Captain Fitzhugh, the consent of the proper&#xD;
authorities was obtained. The prisoner's condition&#xD;
was very critical, but as the journey was to be almost&#xD;
entirely by railway, it was hoped that he would be&#xD;
but little injured by removal, under the judicious .care&#xD;
of the doctor. Being among strangers, the wounded&#xD;
* man naturally found some comfort in the society of a&#xD;
person from his own country-and of his own political&#xD;
8entinwflts. He~ had, therefore, taken some pleasure&#xD;
in the presence of Campbell, and, perhaps at the * sug-&#xD;
&#xD;
ROEBUCK.&#xD;
&#xD;
gestion of that modest gentleman, h6 expressed, with&#xD;
apparent hesitation, a desire that his Northern country-&#xD;
man should accompany him, if that should be found&#xD;
pracl5ieablc and was agreeable to Doctor Fairfax. The&#xD;
doctor was not averse to the arrangement. His inter-&#xD;
est in "Bombyx," as. a study, was not diminished by -&#xD;
tl~eir intercourse, and he was ~willing to be amused at&#xD;
home by this curious specimen. Besides, he desired&#xD;
to oblige C~ptain Tremaine in every way. Camp-&#xD;
bell had already been informed that, as a civilian and&#xD;
a mere spectator of the battle, he would not b~ treated&#xD;
as a prisoner of war, but that, for military reasons, it&#xD;
was deemed necessary to detain him for a short time&#xD;
within the Confederate lines. It was finally arranged&#xD;
that both Tremaine and Campbell, giving suitable&#xD;
paroles, should acconipa~ny Doctor Fairfax. The doc-&#xD;
tor notified his brother that, being slightly wounded,&#xD;
was about to return home with two wounded&#xD;
friends, and he requested that his own house might be&#xD;
prepared for them.&#xD;
This was the first information received at Roebuck&#xD;
how Doctor Dick had fared In the battle. The coun-&#xD;
try had bean informed with telegraphic brevity that the&#xD;
South had gained a splendid victory at Manassa, but&#xD;
with severe loss in killed and wounded. Then the&#xD;
wires conveyed the names of generals and afterwards&#xD;
of other officers who had fallen. Next camel an esti-&#xD;
mate of the Confederate loss,~ studiously moderates&#xD;
but frightful to those who had kindred in the ai'my.&#xD;
Slowly a few telegrams followed from survivors to&#xD;
their families. But for several days nothing was&#xD;
known throughout the country of the fate of thou-&#xD;
sands of the best and bravest of the land, who had&#xD;
been exposed to the peril of a bloody battle. The&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
announcement of victory had thrilled the Southi~'n&#xD;
people with joy and exultation. Success so decisive&#xD;
in the first great battle o~i' the war w&amp;amp;~ generally&#xD;
accepted as decisive of the entire contest. Indepen~&#xD;
deuce Was regarded as secure. That sentiment of&#xD;
security, with the subsequent inaction of the army, was&#xD;
very detrimental to the Confederate cause: The ffrst&#xD;
year of the war, when the native courage and fresh&#xD;
enthusiasm of the Southern troops made them ,irre~&#xD;
sistible on an equal field, was alniost thrown away,&#xD;
and the time thus lost could never be recovered. But&#xD;
after the first exultant echo of triumph came the wail&#xD;
of a people for the loved ones who had purchased the&#xD;
victory with~ their blood. There was agony, borne&#xD;
with patriotic fortitude, but it was agony.&#xD;
The f'axnily at ~oebuck were relieved of painful&#xD;
anxiety when. they learned that Doctor Fairfax was&#xD;
returning home, only slightly wounded. Preparations&#xD;
were made to ~receive him and his two friends, who&#xD;
were supposed to be Confederate soldiers. It was de..&#xD;
cided that a bachelor's establishment was not afit&#xD;
place fpr wounded patriots, and that the comforts of&#xD;
Roebuck and the tender care of women would be&#xD;
absolutely necessary. When the train, which was ex-&#xD;
pecte~ to bring the doctor and his friends, arrived,&#xD;
Colonel I~'red was at the station. Captain Tremaine&#xD;
wa~ borno ~"'~' ~ ____ on a cot, preceded by Doctor&#xD;
Fairfax, on crutches, and followed by Campbell, limp~&#xD;
ing on a cane. .&#xD;
~' Welcome, brother Dick," exclaimed the colonel,&#xD;
"welcome home; are these your friends'? Welcome,&#xD;
gentlemen;. bring them along, Dick; here is the&#xD;
carriage; here's a spring wagon with a bed on it, in&#xD;
case any of you need it; let me help to carry your&#xD;
&#xD;
ROEBUCK.&#xD;
&#xD;
153&#xD;
&#xD;
friend; come along; you are all going to Roebuck;&#xD;
the ladies are waiting for you; not ~a word; three&#xD;
wounded gentlemen to be laid up in a bachelor's&#xD;
barracks! preposterous! it is all settled; come ~on."&#xD;
"But, brother Fred," repeated the doctor, several&#xD;
times, while the colonel was delivering this speech&#xD;
with great animation; "but, brother Fred," and he&#xD;
plucked-the colonel's sleeve, and attempted to draw&#xD;
him aside, for the prospect of carrying Campbell to&#xD;
be domiciled with the family at Roeb~ick horrified&#xD;
him.; "but, brother Fred," he finally exclaimed, "they&#xD;
are Yankees."&#xD;
"yankees, Dick! Good God I Have you brought&#xD;
a brace of Yankees here ~ You I"&#xD;
Now, the colonel was a kindhearted man. He had&#xD;
been opposed to secessiQn and war. He had not&#xD;
cherished that animosity against the Northern people&#xD;
which his brother proclaimed.1 But war engendered&#xD;
bitter hatred in the mildest tempers. Atrocities wau&#xD;
tonly inflicted, as he believed, with. 'the sanction of*&#xD;
the highest Federal authorities, provoked in his bosom&#xD;
antipathy that was deep, stern and~almost implacable.&#xD;
His general indignation against, the North naturally&#xD;
tinged his feeling towards all individuals who were&#xD;
known to him only as abettors of the North in the&#xD;
wa*,. Of all men hi~ brother was the last whom h0&#xD;
would have expected to find in charitable charge of&#xD;
such malignant enemies. The colonel had not been&#xD;
a soldier, and, therefore, had not felt the charities of ~&#xD;
the battleAleld when the battle is over. "You I"&#xD;
Doctor Dick, caught in 'an inconsistency, reddened&#xD;
and stammered. He attempted to explain. But the&#xD;
colonel happened to look at the face of Captain Tre..&#xD;
maine. That prostrate and helpless gentleman, suf'&#xD;

&#xD;
fearing physical agony, seemed even more distressed&#xD;
by the scene which he then witnessed between the&#xD;
two brothers. He understood enough of it to make&#xD;
him feel that he was the occasion of embarrassment&#xD;
and' pain to his friend, the doctor.- His eyes turned&#xD;
from one brother to the other with an expression of&#xD;
anguish. When the colonel looked at him, compas-&#xD;
-sion took the place of anger. He bent over the cap-&#xD;
tain, gently took his hand, and in the kindest voice&#xD;
expressed sympathy and welcome. With his habitual.&#xD;
promptitude he called assistance, played the wounded&#xD;
officer on the bed, made every possible 'provision for&#xD;
his ease and comfort, and rode on horseback beside&#xD;
the wagon, to. see that the "Yankee" should receive&#xD;
no injury. The doctor and Campbell followed in the&#xD;
* the carriage to Roebuck.&#xD;
When they arrived there,, about sunset, of course&#xD;
Doctor Dick had an affectionate welcome. The ladies,&#xD;
without investigating the nationality of the other gen~&#xD;
tlemen, received them kindly, and offered to the&#xD;
wounded captain such sympathetic words and tender&#xD;
offices as his condition suggested. He was carried&#xD;
into a large, convenient chamber, handsomely fur,&#xD;
nished, and laid upon a bed that needed not a wound,&#xD;
a journey, or contrast with a camp~cot to make it&#xD;
seem luxurious. A physician of eminence was sent&#xD;
for, and in the course of the evening, his skill, with&#xD;
the ministrations of the family, soothed the patient's&#xD;
suffering and inspired him with the hope of life and&#xD;
health. At his request, a bed was placed in his cham-&#xD;
ber for his countryman, Campbell.&#xD;
'When those guests had been disposed of for the&#xD;
night, and the wound of Doctor Fairfax had been&#xD;
dressed-a wound which Mrs.. Fai~rfax pronounced to&#xD;

&#xD;
be alarming, and which the      thought would&#xD;
physician&#xD;
requne repose and care-that disabled soldier lay&#xD;
upon a sofa, like a warrior taking his rest, but ready,&#xD;
as usual, to talk.&#xD;
"Now, Colonel Ji~lia," he said, "come' and kiss&#xD;
me, like a good girl, and then, like a colonel, you&#xD;
shall talk to tue about war. I kn~v you are dying to&#xD;
hear all I-have to tell about the g~t battle and vic-&#xD;
tory, and especially, about my ow'~Anartial exploits.&#xD;
I believe now, my fair Desdemona, I might Win your&#xD;
love, if I wanted it, like Othello, by bragging.~~&#xD;
"You can never 'win my love, Uncle Dick."&#xD;
"Why, Miss, tell me why,. you saucy"&#xD;
"Because you have had it ever so long."&#xD;
"Fudge! But, speaking of love, what have you&#xD;
done to bewitch that feather-brained fellow, -Hugh&#xD;
Fitzhugh ?"&#xD;
"I am not a witch, uncle, and Captain Fi~zhugh is&#xD;
not feather-brained, I believe," replied Julia, smiling&#xD;
and blushing.&#xD;
"Well, he is a sad fellow; we'll not talk of him."&#xD;
"But you must not disparage my friends in their&#xD;
absence."&#xD;
"0, he's a friend of yours? Then 1 shall not slan .&#xD;
der him-much."&#xD;
"Fie! Be serious-now do-and tell us about the&#xD;
battle."&#xD;
The story of Manassa, 'as then told by the doctor&#xD;
to his brother and the two ladies, had for them the&#xD;
fascination of novelty, of tragedy and triumph. They&#xD;
were not yet familiar with the awful scenes of a long&#xD;
and sanguinary contest. To them that battle, with&#xD;
its victory, seemed enough of carnage and of glory for&#xD;
an entire war. To the ladies particularly, it appeared&#xD;

&#xD;
157&#xD;
&#xD;
that the end of the war was achieved. The story&#xD;
filled their imaginations, like a noble history already&#xD;
complete. When the doctor had described the events&#xD;
of' chief importance, he began to entertain them with&#xD;
anecdotes of personal adventure. One of them related&#xD;
to some of the personages of this narrative.&#xD;
"There, is Captain Fitzhugh, now-your friend,&#xD;
Colonel Julia.-he has the name of'being a brave man&#xD;
.-I shall say nothing against your friend on that&#xD;
score-but, like the rest of us, he is a raw soldier and&#xD;
may blunder into scrapes-..-and he rides a fleet horse-&#xD;
that I know; the Yankees know it too, for they havE&#xD;
seen his heels."'&#xD;
Having said so much, with significant looks and&#xD;
tone; he caused and fixed his eyes on Julia, as if ex.&#xD;
peothig her to invite an explanation of his hints.&#xD;
But some maidenly coyness or consciousness sealed&#xD;
her sweet lips, and sent a blush to her beautiful&#xD;
cheeks. Mrs. Fairfax had no such feeling to restrain&#xD;
the curiosity which belongs to her sex-and to the&#xD;
haughtier sex.'&#xD;
"Go on," she said, "tell us what you have to tell&#xD;
about Hugh."&#xD;
"Well, Hugh is a warrior, who, by the diligent&#xD;
study of his profession, has discovered that the whole&#xD;
~'t of war is neatly packed away in a few words 0f an&#xD;
old Greek poet, or in two lines of modern parody~-...&#xD;
'Ha that fights, and runs away,&#xD;
May live to fight another day.'&#xD;
On one Q~ca5iqn, howevQr, he would have preferred, I&#xD;
)#ieve, t~ onhit~the preliminary fight suggested by the&#xD;
poet before runni~ig."&#xD;
&#xD;
"Uncle Dick, you shall not"-&#xD;
"What?"&#xD;
"Come," said the colonel, laughing, "you shall not&#xD;
tease the ladies with your scandalous hints. Tell your&#xD;
tale like a man."&#xD;
"Well, if I must, I must. But you shall not blame&#xD;
me, Julia, if the story does not please you. Once&#xD;
upon a time, then-it was a few days before the battle&#xD;
-Captain Fitzhugh was sent to spy out-you would&#xD;
say to i'econnoitre, Colonel 'Julia-a position of the&#xD;
enemy. About sutlri8e he went some two niile8 in&#xD;
advance of his company, to a hill from which he ex-&#xD;
pected to obtain a near and clear view of the position.&#xD;
He took with him only two. men. One of them was&#xD;
Mark Marlin, the young man, Julia, who has taken&#xD;
your gentlemanly father for his model. It is not ne.&#xD;
cessary to name the other man. They were all Well&#xD;
mounted. The men, perhaps, were selected With a&#xD;
view to the fleetness Of their horse; ~according to the&#xD;
fundamental flying principle of the captain. Hugh&#xD;
rode his famous black, Sultan. 'Mark was outhe horse&#xD;
you gave him, brother Fred."&#xD;
"Sold to him.&#xD;
"Well, the other soldier had a swifter nag than&#xD;
either 'of them, as the result showed. WI~e~i they ar&#xD;
rived at the hill, it was so densely wooded that the&#xD;
captain deemed it necessary to descend alone to an&#xD;
open bench or little plateau, from which he could&#xD;
plainly see the whole batch of Yankees on the oppo~&#xD;
site side of a small stream. lie was as clearly seen&#xD;
himself by tho hostile piokete alQng the margin of the&#xD;
stream, and he stoo&amp;amp; within easy range Qf their guns.&#xD;
He remained there ten or fifteen minutes, while a dozet&#xD;
of the blue.coats were firing away at him, and how&#xD;

&#xD;
he escaped injury I cannot imagine. Just as he re&#xD;
turned to his two followers they had discovered a&#xD;
squad of the enemy's cavalry, eight or ten in numl5er,&#xD;
making for the road by which they had come. To&#xD;
return on that road was impossible. To reuiain was&#xD;
out of the question. There waS no way to get back&#xD;
to the company but by scouring across open fields in&#xD;
full view of the enemy, and trusting to luck and&#xD;
speed. So we-so the captain led oft; commanding&#xD;
the two men to follow, or to make their way back as. -&#xD;
they should find it necessary. He was able to keep&#xD;
ahead of Mark, but the other grey-back distanced&#xD;
them both. They were soon discovered by the Yam-&#xD;
kee squad, wh~ immediately attempted to intercept&#xD;
*them. They succeeded in cutting off Marlin, and&#xD;
bringing him to bay. The brave boy drew his sabre,&#xD;
and endeavored to cut his way through them6 The&#xD;
captain, looking back, saw his follower surrounded;&#xD;
and fighting furiously. Wheeling his horse, hugh&#xD;
dashed at the Yankees, and began to lay ab6~t him&#xD;
with such vigor that their attention was withdrawn&#xD;
from Mark to the, officer, and there was momentary&#xD;
confusion among them. Seeing that. Marlin wa~ ex-~&#xD;
tricated by the movement, his captain called out-.&#xD;
'fly, Mark, fly-fly, I 'command you.' The soldier,.&#xD;
with the instinct of military obedience, fled at the&#xD;
word of command, although, until it was repeated&#xD;
with peremptory v4iemence, he hesitated to leave his&#xD;
officer. The Feds did not follow him, but tried to&#xD;
close in upon~ the captain, fly the dexterous manage-&#xD;
ment of his horse and sword, or by marvello~is for..&#xD;
tune, he kept 'his life among them until he thought&#xD;
Mark had a sufficient start. Then throwing his body&#xD;
forward to the neck of his horse, and plunging the&#xD;
&#xD;
spurs into Sultan's sides, he was carried at a leap be.&#xD;
tween uplifted sabres clea.~ of the Federals. They&#xD;
pursued, firing their pistols. Only a few hundred&#xD;
yards in advance, there was a fence over which Hugh&#xD;
and Mark were carried by their horses without ha1t~&#xD;
ing. But none of the pursuers ventured, the leap.&#xD;
Thus they lost time which was well employed by the&#xD;
flying grey-backs. When they had crossed one or two&#xD;
more fences, that fortunately crossed their line of re-.&#xD;
treat, the blue-coats were out of sight, and they were&#xD;
~iever seen again. Hugh says that in the fray, ~Mark&#xD;
emptied one saddle; and Mark, more liberal in his&#xD;
commendation, avers that his captain cut down two&#xD;
of the Yankees. It is a pity that these witnesses are&#xD;
not quite impartial, and that the other grey-back, who&#xD;
sneers at their testimony, had noit remained near&#xD;
enough to the scene of action to 'correct their reports.&#xD;
But he had regained the company, and spread won-&#xD;
'ous rumors long before the captain's return."&#xD;
"Who was he O?~~ inquired Julia.&#xD;
"It is none of your business, niece of mine.&#xD;
"Thou art the man, I verily believe, Uncle Dick."&#xD;
9 Never say that, again! Don't slander your&#xD;

"Brother Dick," said Mrs. Fairfax, "who or what&#xD;

"A genuine Yankee, my gentle sister, if there can&#xD;

CHAPTER XV".&#xD;
BOMBYX AT ROEBUCIC.&#xD;
CAPTAnir TREMA1NI~'S condition for several days re.&#xD;
inained critical. At one time it was regarded as des-&#xD;
perate. Two or three nights Colonel Fairfax eat i~y&#xD;
his bedside all night, and the physician was kept in&#xD;
the house. But when the crisis was past his conv~des..&#xD;
cence was rapid. Although the Federal authorities&#xD;
had adopted the inhuman policy of preventing the&#xD;
importation of medicines into the Confederacy, the&#xD;
most necessary remedies could still be supplied to a&#xD;
Federal prisoner. The patient constantly received&#xD;
th~ kindest attention from the family and from s&amp;amp;-&#xD;
vants who had experience in nursing The sick. Do~tor&#xD;
Dick spent much time in his chamber, applying the&#xD;
physician's instructions with professional intelligence,&#xD;
and amusing the captain with quaint conversation,&#xD;
relieved of all satirical asperity by sympathy and re-&#xD;
spect for this "Yankee.". His own favorite servant,&#xD;
Caleb, divided his attention between his master and&#xD;
the ~~unded captain. The good clergyman, Mr.&#xD;
Ambler, visited him often, and a cordial friendship was&#xD;
established between them. Tremaine won the esteem&#xD;
of all who approached him by the gentleness of his&#xD;
manners, his patience in suffering, his gratitude for&#xD;
kindness, and, in brief, by the honorable sentiments of&#xD;
an educated soldier. In a few weeks his health was&#xD;
so far restored that he might4e removed with safety,&#xD;
and a special exchange having been arranged for him&#xD;

through the interest of friends, he left Roebuck for the&#xD;
}~orth. His departure was sincerely regretted by the&#xD;
friends he had made there, and he expressed the'&#xD;
warmest gratitude for all their kindness. Taking&#xD;
leave of him for a time, we return to his compatriot,&#xD;
Campbell.&#xD;
Although they found the manners and sentiments&#xD;
of that guest by ~uo means agreeable, yet Colonel&#xD;
Fairfax and his family, studious of hospitality, endea-&#xD;
vored in every way ~o promote his comfort and plea~&#xD;
sure. The colonel placed a. horse at his disposal to&#xD;
ride at will over the plantation and through the,&#xD;
neighborhood. The host would have deemed it&#xD;
unworthy of himself to watch his movements or t&amp;amp;~&#xD;
suspect him of any baseness while his honor as a&#xD;
guest and as a prisoner on parole was pledged. The&#xD;
doctor, whose leg confined him to the house, played&#xD;
chess with him or indulged him with plenty of the&#xD;
talk which he loved. The war was,' naturally, the&#xD;
most frequent theme of their conversation, for the sen-&#xD;
timent of delicacy which excluded it from the conver-&#xD;
*    nations between Captain Tremaine and the family, did&#xD;
not restrain Bombyx, especially when Ire was alone&#xD;
with Doctor Dick. At first he was much embarrassed&#xD;
in the society of Roebuck. His assurance was&#xD;
abashed by the quiet, unassuming manners of gentle-&#xD;
men and ladies, who,' in the familiarity of domestic life,&#xD;
*     practiced the refined gentleness to which they ~had&#xD;
been born. As he dared not affect superiority after&#xD;
his manner, he would have fallen into servility after&#xD;
?his nature, if he had not been made to feel that the&#xD;
social law of the place was one of equality at a high&#xD;
level and that it was equally a transgression to cringe&#xD;
and to hector. He suspected that there was an odious&#xD;

haughty arrogance which, in his fancy, was associated&#xD;
with the aristocracy of the South. When a few days&#xD;
had rend,9red him more familiar with the usages of&#xD;
the ~lace he began to despise, as a weakness, the&#xD;
unobtrusive gentleness which he eQuld never compre..&#xD;
hend.&#xD;

"Yes," Campbell admitted, "I believe&#xD;

"AnswerMr. Campbell, Caleb," said the doctor, to&#xD;
his favorite servant, who 'stood with a napkin on his&#xD;
arm, waiting for orders. Being commanded to speak,&#xD;
he made a profound bow to the g~iest and began:&#xD;
"If I am allowed to suppress my cogitation Sn this&#xD;
memorable occasion, human nature teaches me that&#xD;
white folks that I have never seen would not come a&#xD;
thousand miles just to fight for my good."&#xD;
"There it is, Mr. Campbell," said the doctor, "go&#xD;
on and plant your oranges in icebergs."&#xD;
"But you would like to be free, Caleb ?"&#xD;
"That's as might be according to the circumnaviga~&#xD;
tion of circumstances. I do not see many white folks&#xD;
as/free as I am, no offence to you, master, as being&#xD;
our prisoner. Them other free nig~ers, as I repre.&#xD;
hend by my circumlocution, they are lazy beggars and&#xD;
thieves. They are the contemptible, black coffee~.&#xD;
grounds of society left after the second boiling."&#xD;
"That will do Caleb; Mr. Campbell has your&#xD;
opinion."&#xD;
"Well, doctor, however we may differ about slavery,&#xD;
it is astonishing that you Southerners make war&#xD;
against so~good a government i~.s ours."&#xD;
"We make war! The South attempted peacable&#xD;
secession-the North attempted to prevent secession&#xD;
by' force. The North made war."&#xD;
"But no State b~as a right to secede."&#xD;
"Then the Federal government is absolute.".&#xD;
". Oh, no, doctor, it is a free government."&#xD;
"Under a free government the rights of all should&#xD;
be" protected 'with even-handed justice. Protection&#xD;

But I did not intend to be drawn into. an angry dis~iis-.&#xD;
sion. It can do no good. h is better to laugh aside&#xD;

"No, no, doctor, I am not angry. 'I am sure I can~&#xD;

greatness of the government you 'are: giving up. If&#xD;
we remain united we can def~' the world."&#xD;
"If you worship ~power, you should offer; your mw&#xD;
cense to the Prince of Darkness. His dominion is&#xD;
not confined to the United States."&#xD;
Well, doctor, if you won't discuss the matter se~&#xD;
riously, you must not think hard of us for pres~erving&#xD;
the life of the nation at all 'hazards."&#xD;
"Which nation-..-.North or South'?, You would take&#xD;

Mr, Campbell was not satisfied that t~he luminous&#xD;
~opininn ilelivered by Caleb correctly.~,ejreserited pub-&#xD;
lic sentiment in the African branch of Sc~uthern so.&#xD;
ciety. His professional curiosity pricked him to pry&#xD;
into the thoughts 'and feelings of the slaves. He&#xD;
deemed it his duty also to enlighten them on the great&#xD;
question of their own destiny, if he found them be..&#xD;
nigh ted like Oaleb. His philanthropy was as med..&#xD;
dlesome*. and egotistical as his curiosity. Being&#xD;
troubled with no scruples of honesty or hcmoit, and&#xD;
having set up a Deity in his own image, he persuaded&#xD;
himself that he would be doing God service in sowing&#xD;
dissension between his host and his' servants by ex.&#xD;
citing delusive aspirations in the minds of the credu.&#xD;
bus negroes. Before he had been long at Roebuck&#xD;
he conceived the ambitious and atrocious design of&#xD;
serving the Northern cause by fomenting a servile in..&#xD;
surrection. Under the influence of. those motives he&#xD;
sought opportunities to converge ~yith the slaves at&#xD;
Roebuck and on other estates. As he rode about&#xD;
at his pleasure, he found such opportunities without&#xD;
difficulty. Being conscious, however, of an illicit and&#xD;
odious purpose, he avoided observation, and gave to&#xD;
his intercourse with the servants a clai~destine charac-&#xD;
ter. He supposed it was quite unknown to the per..&#xD;
Sons whose hospitality he enjoyed.. His interviews&#xD;
with some of the negroes who have become known to&#xD;
the reader may be brIefly described.&#xD;
He found old Valentine sunning himself one morn-&#xD;
ing before his cabin, and aftei' some questions about&#xD;
his health, age and recollections, inquired if the old&#xD;
man knew 'that the negroes would all soon be set&#xD;
free.&#xD;

Mr. Campbell passed on, attributing these craven&#xD;
and servile sentiments to senility which he could not&#xD;
enlighten. Again,.he was riding past a shop in which&#xD;
a lil~ely young fellow was at work.&#xD;
"How are you, my man," he said, "what is~ yoUr&#xD;

"Bob, sir; dey calls me carpenter I3ob, for short."&#xD;

When Campbell .fell in with Joe, he thou~hV that&#xD;
head-man more intelligetit than Bob, until he touched&#xD;
~is favorite theme. Joe denounced the idea of sepa-&#xD;
rating himself from his master as basely disloyal.&#xD;
"Why," he said, "my folks has belonged to de&#xD;
Fairfaxes since de very first man. We's all Fair-&#xD;

"Well, Joe, I was only trying you. I see you are&#xD;
faithful. You need not say anything about this con-&#xD;
versation."&#xD;
"No, master, only to Master Fred. We tells one&#xD;
another everything."&#xD;
Campbell encountered Juba dodging a,~out, and&#xD;
found that this broad-shouldered, bnllet-headed, bel-&#xD;
ligerent brother, by dint of meditation in the woods,&#xD;
had solved the question of the negro's destiny in a&#xD;
different fashion. He listened to a long harangue of&#xD;
Campbell in silence, fixing his eyes upon a fence-post&#xD;
with that lodk of profound imbecility and unobservant&#xD;
attention which none but a inegro can give, and then,&#xD;
without t shifting the conspicuous whites of his eyes, he&#xD;
propoun4~d his conclusion:&#xD;
"It seems to me as ef dis was a white man's fight&#xD;

Cam bell found by his African explorations, that&#xD;
either f~om affection or apathy or stupidity or tim-.&#xD;
idity, or from obscui'e motives which they' could not&#xD;
explain, the negroes generally were at that time in-&#xD;
clined to remain with their owners, or, at least, were&#xD;
not inclined to make any adventurous effort to change&#xD;
their condition. In a few cases, however, the teach-&#xD;
ing of the philanthropist took root in the minds of the&#xD;
slaves and bore fruit after the kind, not precisely of&#xD;
the doctrine but of the negro. When Campbell had&#xD;
been for some time delving in this mine of black dia-&#xD;
-monds, his work was suddenly interrupted. Colonel&#xD;
Fairfax had, of course, become aware of his frequent&#xD;
interviews~ with his own slaves and others, but attri-&#xD;
buted them to the natural curiosity of a stranger or&#xD;
the professional curiosity of Bombyx. He did not&#xD;
suspect him of abusing the privileges of hospitality for&#xD;
unworthy purposes.' He casually remarked to his&#xD;
guest-" I see, Mr. Campbell, you have been amusing&#xD;
yourself with talking to the servants on the planta-&#xD;
tion."&#xD;
"Never, c~olonel---.you must not believe the tales of&#xD;
the negroes."&#xD;
"What !" exclaimed the colonel, with surprise,&#xD;
"do I understand you to deny that you have con-&#xD;
versed with the negroes."&#xD;
"Never, except with the servants who came to our&#xD;
A chamber."&#xD;
"Mr. Campbell, I was not complaining of your. con-&#xD;
duct. I said iiothing about tales ~f the negroes. But&#xD;
you surprise me."&#xD;
&#xD;
"Do y~u suspect me of falsehood, Colonel Fair-&#xD;
fax ?"&#xD;
"I suspect nothing, Mr. Campbell. I know." The&#xD;
colonel's manner expressed 'his scorn of falsehood.&#xD;
"Since 'I find myself an object of suspicion under&#xD;
your roof; sir, I had better relieve your house of my&#xD;
presence."&#xD;
"You will use your own pleasure,, sir."&#xD;
Mr. Camj~bell, without unnecessary delay, took up&#xD;
his quarters- at the Swan tavern. The change had&#xD;
become desirable to him, for it relieved him of some&#xD;
obstacles to the prosecution of his main desigii. He&#xD;
had been wishing to escape from the restraints of&#xD;
Roebuck, when the accidental altercation with Colonel&#xD;
Fairfax, and that gentleman's indignation at his false-.&#xD;
hood, opened the door.&#xD;

CHAPTER XVI.&#xD;
CoNsFmAOIEs.&#xD;
A FEW days after Campbell established himself at&#xD;
the Swan tavern a rumor began to be whispered&#xD;
through the neighborhood tha1~ the negroes 'were plot-&#xD;
ting an insurrection. It was vague and without a&#xD;
know~ origin. It gathered circumstances as it flew,&#xD;
and si~picion supplied the defects of testimony.&#xD;
tTntil en the slaves, where the invasion had not pen..&#xD;
etrated, were quiet, submissive, and remarkably atten-&#xD;
tive to their duties. Few attempted to escape, and&#xD;
none to rebel.. The war, and the general arming of&#xD;
the dominant race impressed them with awe. But&#xD;
experience had not yet proved what effect upon their&#xD;
inflammable passions mightbe produced by the progress&#xD;
of a vast conflict, waged, as they understood, by the&#xD;
North for their deliverance. While it was believed&#xD;
that servile insurrection was one of the agencies by&#xD;
which the North expected to subjugate the South, a&#xD;
rumor of commotion among~the slaves might readily&#xD;
cause anxiety. It was soon reported that there&#xD;
had been midnight meetings 'of negroes-that there&#xD;
had be&amp;amp;~ secret intercourse between Campbell, Palmer&#xD;
and blind Pete-that Pete was more active than ever&#xD;
in his clandestine dealings with slaves by night. Sus-&#xD;
picion fell upon Camgbell because he;was a "Yankee ;'&#xD;
it was promoted by a circumstantial story of his dis-&#xD;
missal from Roebuck because he had tampered with&#xD;
servants; it was confirmed by exaggerated accounts&#xD;
&#xD;
ROEBUCK.                  173&#xD;

cal eon~uct had lost him the con~deuce of his neigh~&#xD;
bors, and his position was ~ compromised by a&#xD;
report that his Son had deserted and gone over to the&#xD;
enemy. These various rumors and suspicions pro-&#xD;
duced uneasiness, wW&#xD;
agitation. the ich rapidly swelled into popular&#xD;
ingenuity of Mr. Palmer was constantly&#xD;
exercised by; his plans for~making the war subservient&#xD;
to his interest and revenge, and 'by the embarrass-&#xD;
meiits which must beset a secret adherent of the&#xD;
North, who, in a Soiithern community, ostensibly&#xD;
though faintly supported the Southern cause. When&#xD;
blind Pete visited him, as well in pursuance of his&#xD;
own invitation as of the stipulation exacted by Baxter&#xD;
at a rope's end, a negotiation took place in which the&#xD;
trained intelligence of the retired merchant outwitted&#xD;
the purblind cunning of the vulgar knave. Pete w~&#xD;
led to reveal, not only the whole transaction of the&#xD;
sugar-tongs, but the apprehension which he felt that&#xD;
the Northern stranger would be less indulgent than&#xD;
the good-natured Southerners, who so often winked&#xD;
at his pilfering in compassion for his blindness. By&#xD;
playing upon this fear and by a liberal bribe, Palmer&#xD;
enlisted Pete in his secret service. He thus established&#xD;
an espionage upon the families of his neighbors and an&#xD;
agency which might be turned to account in the pro-&#xD;
secution of schemes yet unhatched. Through this&#xD;
channel he was informed of Campbell's position at&#xD;
IRoehuck and was enabled to estimate his character.&#xD;
He wished to open communication with him, but was&#xD;
too cautious' to attempt it until the guest had removed&#xD;
from Roebuck to the tavern. Soon after that event&#xD;

174             ROEBUCK.&#xD;
he commissioned Pete to convey a private intimation&#xD;
to Campbell that Mr. Palmer desired to consult him&#xD;
confidentially, and would be pleased to receive a visit&#xD;
from him at his own ~house by night. The invitatioii&#xD;
was accepted, and thus at a late hour one night those&#xD;
two natives of the North were sitting in Mr. Palmer's&#xD;
parlor, with the doors locked and the windrow-shut-&#xD;
ters closed.&#xD;
"I have now intrusted you," Mr. Palmer was say-&#xD;
ing, "with a candid exposition of my real sentiments&#xD;
respecting the rebellion, and of the urgent reasons for&#xD;
disguising them at present. May II rely upon your&#xD;
friendship to make this explanation in the proper&#xD;
quarters when you return to the North? I hope my&#xD;
conduct and motives will be kindly appreciated there.&#xD;
\If the forces of the Union should hereafter reach this&#xD;
part of Virginia, as of course, they will, it may be de-&#xD;
sfrable that the commander shall be informed of my&#xD;
views, but you will perceive that, for' the benefit of&#xD;
our cause, it may even then be prudent for him to ret&#xD;
tam the knowledge in his own breast."&#xD;
"I understand you, I believe," responded Campbell,&#xD;
dAly.&#xD;
"Then there 'is a report current that my son Albert,&#xD;
who was a quarter-master in the State service for a&#xD;
shZ~rt time, has resigned his office, and visited the&#xD;
Union lines. You may meet him at the North, and,&#xD;
I believe, you will find that he is as loyal as I am.&#xD;
Possibly he will desire to enter the Federal service.&#xD;
If~ you can promote his plans in any way, you will&#xD;
oblige me by doing so, and will render service, no&#xD;
( 'ioubt, to the cause."&#xD;
"I understand you.~~&#xD;
"Then may I count upon your friendly offices ?"&#xD;
&#xD;
ROEBUCK.      175&#xD;
&#xD;
"That~ question, Mr. Palmer, must be answered&#xD;
with ~olemn reference to my paramount duty as a&#xD;
loyal citizen of the United States. When you solicit&#xD;
the favor of our benign go-verunient it appears to me&#xD;
that you may reasonably be required to give some&#xD;
tangible proof of your loyalty. This is a most wicked&#xD;
rebellion, and neutrality is a great offence."&#xD;
"What can I do here and now for the Union ?"&#xD;
"Much. You have a glorious field for usefulness&#xD;
in your situation. The confidence reposed in you by&#xD;
your rebel neighbors, under the belief that you sympa-&#xD;
thize with them, will enable you to operate effect..&#xD;
ively, secretly and safely. You have a glorious op..&#xD;
opportunity "&#xD;
"I do not understand you."&#xD;
"There is in the South a population of four mil-&#xD;
lions who should be loyal supporters of the Union&#xD;
cause. They require~ only to be stimulated and&#xD;
guided  Why are they not' summoned to the aid of&#xD;
those arms which are to strike from their limbs the&#xD;
manacles of bondage? They a~re within' the rebel&#xD;
camp. 'They sleep in the citadel. They could grasp&#xD;
the keys~ They can disband Southern armies, by de.&#xD;
straying Southern h~mes. If they have not guns,&#xD;
there is the knife and the torch. Many of them are&#xD;
around you.' With th~m you can serve the Union."&#xD;
~"Would you resort to servile insurrection-to uni-&#xD;
versal massacre.-to the assassination of families-to&#xD;
the Violation of women-to the murder of innocent&#xD;
children.-to"--.--.-.&#xD;
"Enough, Mr. Palmer. In a word, all means are&#xD;
lawful to suppress this unprovoked, this wicked, this&#xD;
atrocious rebellion against the best government the&#xD;
world ever saw. It is a rebellion of slave-holders. It&#xD;

is fit that we cry havoc, and let slip the slaves. If&#xD;
they are savage, let those who have made them savage&#xD;
by oppression pay the penalty."&#xD;
"Mr. campbell, you chill my blood with horror."&#xD;
"Then, sir, your loyalty is hypocrisy."&#xD;
"Why, the F deral government has solemnly de-&#xD;
clared that the "war is not waged to interfere with the&#xD;
initution of slavery."&#xD;
Politic words! Word~~! The government ad-&#xD;
vances before the swelling breeze of popular feeling.&#xD;
Hostility to slavery is the master passion of the&#xD;
Nort~rn heart.~ This was the prime cause of the war.&#xD;
Byiilexorable logic the abolitioii of slavery must be a&#xD;
consequence of the war. The government must in~&#xD;
tend the necessary result of its own action. They are&#xD;
blind who do not foresee the end. The North sees&#xD;
it and therefore sustains the war. Press and pulpit,&#xD;
by turns masters or slaves of opinion, are furiously&#xD;
hostile to slavery and slave-holders: A servile insur.~&#xD;
reaction would be hailed there with more enthusiasm&#xD;
than ever was the name of John Brown. Be not de~&#xD;
luded by politic professions of the government.~ Chiefi&#xD;
of administration are known to believe that the name&#xD;
of John Brown has become historical as a martyr in&#xD;
the cause of human nature. Whoever most resem~&#xD;
bies him is most faithful to the instincts of this war~"&#xD;
"Old John Brown! It cannot be true that a&#xD;
Christian government approves his desperate charac~&#xD;
ter and diabolical design."&#xD;
"411 good Christians at the North revere him as a&#xD;
martyr."&#xD;
"BLit he was hung," said. Palmer, nst pleased with&#xD;
the precedent.&#xD;
* "What, then ~ He is canonised. If you would be&#xD;
&#xD;
a saint, be a man. Defy the slave power. Stir up&#xD;
the slaves. Recognize your mission."&#xD;
"You are mistakeft in your estimate of the negroes.&#xD;
We who have lived long among them know them&#xD;
better. They are inert and cowardly. The love of&#xD;
~iberty is not in them, as in the white race, an aspir~&#xD;
ing and unconquerable passion, but a languid love of&#xD;
ease. They failed John Brown."&#xD;
"But then they were~ not encouraged by a power-&#xD;
fuil government and an invincible army."&#xD;
"Perhaps the recent event at Manassa ~nay not en~&#xD;
courage them."&#xD;
"Mr. Palmer, are you loyal or disloyal to the&#xD;
Union'?"&#xD;
"Loyal, Mr. Campbell, loyal to the core. I have.&#xD;
humbly ventured to suggest difficulties which oc~&#xD;
curred to my mind. But if there is really anything&#xD;
that I can do for the Union cause, I am ready to do&#xD;
it."&#xD;
"On no. other condition will I consent to represent&#xD;
you as a loyal citizen, or to interest myself in the for-&#xD;
tunes of your son."&#xD;
Pressed by such considerations, Palmer finally con~&#xD;
scented to lend himself to a scheme which he believed&#xD;
to be dangerous to himself; impracticable and atro..&#xD;
cious. He compromised with his conscience and his&#xD;
prudence by resolving that he would do no more than&#xD;
might be absolutely necessary to satisfy Campbell,&#xD;
and by assuring himself that the project could have,&#xD;
no important result. He promised to ascertain the&#xD;
temper of the negroes, and report to Campbell. That&#xD;
gentleman, returning to his room in the tavern, mini..&#xD;
nated coming events which would immortalize his&#xD;
name, and furnish material for several telling letters&#xD;

to the' "Comet." Already his brain began to flame&#xD;
with the composition of amazing paragraphs, and daz-&#xD;
zling rows of capitals danced before his mind's eye,&#xD;
like rustling banners of triumph.&#xD;
~r. ?almer sought an early opportunity to signify&#xD;
to blind Pete, with cautious circumlocution, that he&#xD;
desired to learn whether any of the slaves were&#xD;
ambitious to become free, and what exertions they&#xD;
were inclined to make, or what risks they were pre-&#xD;
pared to run for that object. He wished to leave that&#xD;
blind rogue in doubt whether the inquiry was intended&#xD;
in the interest of the North or of the South-of slave-&#xD;
holders or of abolitionists. But Pete was astute&#xD;
enough to resolve th~t doubt by laying together&#xD;
various circumstances which had come to his know-&#xD;
ledge. He insinuated his conviction of the truth, and&#xD;
declared that the service in which Mr. Palmer pro-&#xD;
posed to employ him would be attended with extreme&#xD;
danger to himself By insisting upon his real or&#xD;
affected fear, he extorted a larger bribe than he had&#xD;
ever before ventured to demand. As Mr. Palmer was&#xD;
also palled upon to supply the necessities of Mr. Camp-&#xD;
bell, his ~urse was now subject to a double drain in&#xD;
consequence of his loyalty. Moreover he was kept in&#xD;
an agony of apprehension. lie had little confidence&#xD;
in the negroes, and less in Pete. Ht~ dreaded every&#xD;
moment that his perilous plot might explode to his&#xD;
own ruin.&#xD;
He had sold all his slaves except two men and the&#xD;
wife and children of one of~ them. This one was a&#xD;
dull, stupid fellow, named Gabe, who was retained&#xD;
because his master was obliged to keep at least one&#xD;
man-servant, and thought this doltish creature would&#xD;
not run away. The other man, whose name was&#xD;
&#xD;
0&#xD;
&#xD;
ROEBUCK.      179&#xD;
&#xD;
Mike, was a shrewd, restles~ unn~an~geab1e negro.&#xD;
Lie had been "in the bush" for several months.&#xD;
During his absence his family had been sold and sent&#xD;
Southward. He reseAted this transaction, as well as&#xD;
the sharp discipline to which he had submitted before&#xD;
he took to the woods. He expected, if he should be&#xD;
taught, to be sold also and sent to the Cotton States.&#xD;
To avoid this fate, Mike conceived a plan of escaping&#xD;
into the sFederal lines with such of the neighboring&#xD;
negroes ashe could induce to join him. With their&#xD;
aid he desired, before leaving the country, to procure&#xD;
money, and, perhaps, to gratify his resentment. He&#xD;
was hatching this project while his master was m9d-&#xD;
dling with a more atrocious plot. Mike was tam-&#xD;
pering with blind Pete to further his own scheme,&#xD;
while Pete was tampering with him in pursuance of&#xD;
his engagement with Mr. Palmer. Mike sought an&#xD;
interview with Campbell, and affecting to adopt his&#xD;
views, obtained such information and assistance as he&#xD;
thought necessary to his own plan. He was quite too&#xD;
shrewd to believe in the success of a servile insurrec-&#xD;
tion. He and two or three other negroes who were&#xD;
conspiring with him or with Pete or with Campbell-.-&#xD;
they scarcely knew with whom or for what.-obt~ained&#xD;
some fire-arms through Pete's illicit traffic. They&#xD;
had an old musket, two shot-guns, with broken locks,&#xD;
and a pistol. Mike supposed that these weapons&#xD;
might be useful in perpetrating a robbery or in taking&#xD;
vengeance on an obnoxious master, or in defending&#xD;
the fugitives on their route of escape.&#xD;
The black chiefs of the conspiracy held a council.&#xD;
They sat in an old tobacco-barn, near the edge of a&#xD;
wood, remote from any habitation. The time was&#xD;
midnight, and the moon had just risen. The barn&#xD;

bad long been disused and had fallen into decay. It&#xD;
was bfiilt of round logs with the bark on them. The&#xD;
roo~f was of elap-boards. The bark was hanging in&#xD;
black flakes from the logs, and the roof was all gone,&#xD;
except a few of the rafters which sprawled like spiders'&#xD;
legs in the moonlight overhead. The door had&#xD;
been carried away, and the frame in which it had&#xD;
stood, being rotten, ceased to uphold the ends of the&#xD;
logs, and these, swaying downward~ left a wide, rag-&#xD;
ged hole in the side of the barn. The assemblage7&#xD;
within, mottled with patches of moonlight and of&#xD;
shadow, numbered four persons. They were squatted&#xD;
upon the ground. Mike presided on a fiat stone.&#xD;
The other three were two slaves of Mr. Eckles, named&#xD;
Jake and Cato, and a slave of Mrs. Fitzliugh, called&#xD;
Hannibal. Jake and Cato had been, like Mike, for&#xD;
some time in the bush. Cato was a timid, crouching&#xD;
fellow, but Jake was a stout, fierce, savage-looking&#xD;
negro, with the marks of severe treatment' on his per-&#xD;
sou. Hannibal had been corrupted by the laxity of&#xD;
discipline at Willowbank, under the administration of&#xD;
a woman, and roaming about in idleness, he had fallen&#xD;
in with the other sable conspirators.&#xD;
"Now, boys," said President Mike, "we's a gwine&#xD;
to hold a council to see what we's a gwhie to do.&#xD;
What you all gwine to'do now?"&#xD;
"l's a gwine to stop in de bush," responded Cato,&#xD;
"'case it's de nighest to git. something' to eat from de&#xD;
t'other niggers."&#xD;
"I want to r~n off to de Yankees," said Hannibal,&#xD;
"'case it's de fnr4est off to cotch us."&#xD;
"What's we done got dem guns for ?'~ inquired&#xD;
Cato, "dat's what I want to know. I's afeard of&#xD;
guns. Dat's what."&#xD;
&#xD;
"You're a fool," growled Jake, "guns is to shoot."&#xD;
"Dem guns won't shoot nobody," pronounced the&#xD;
president.&#xD;
"Dey must shoot somebody," said Jake.&#xD;
"Who ?" cried all the others.&#xD;
"Old Eckles."&#xD;
"0 Lord," exclaimed Cato, with alarm, "ef dar's&#xD;
shooting , l's ow"&#xD;
"I'd shoot everybody," rejoined Ja~ce,, "let's raise&#xD;
all de niggers."&#xD;
"How many kin you raise ?" asked the president.&#xD;
"Lots."&#xD;
"Bias you axed 'em?"&#xD;
"Yes, I done ax 'em.~~&#xD;
"How many of 'em promised~o raise 1"&#xD;
"Two; me and another feller."&#xD;
"What did de rest of'em say?"&#xD;
"I was afeard to ax 'em, afeard dey'll blab. But&#xD;
Yankee Campbell says there's lots of 'em ready."&#xD;
"Yankee Campbell is a liar," declared the presi-&#xD;
dent.&#xD;
"Dat's jis what he is," chimed in Cato and Hanni-&#xD;
baL&#xD;
"hush ~ Somebody's ~a comm'," whispered Cato.&#xD;
"You's a coward," said Mike, "go to de door and&#xD;
watch." When this order was obeyed by the trem-&#xD;
bling Cato, the president continued: "Now, Jake,&#xD;
you's a fool. You's all fools. l's got all de sense.&#xD;
You see de moonshine comm' down through dem&#xD;

"Yes; but she keeps 'em locked up in a chis in her&#xD;
own room, and she sleeps up stairs wid 'eni since do&#xD;
0&#xD;

"Well," said Mike, "we'll git into her room and&#xD;
break open the chis."&#xD;
"But you mustn't hurt missus," cried Hannibal.&#xD;
"No; she shan't be hurt."&#xD;
"We'll rob do chis, but you mustn't hurt missus."&#xD;
"Now' mind me, Jake, you bring Cato and meet me&#xD;
at de Poplar Spring to-morrow, jis when it gits dark.&#xD;
Hannibal, you go to Willowbank, and git inside to&#xD;

"A ghose-a ghose".-.-shouted Cato, and took to&#xD;
his heels. Jake and hannibal ran out ~f the barn, and&#xD;
being also frightened at a ghost or a man, followed&#xD;
the sentinel. Mike, 'who had given them their or-&#xD;
dci's, and thus accomplished all that he designed, did&#xD;
not attempt to detain them, though he stood his&#xD;
ground. Presently blind Pete advanced from the&#xD;
wood, and a long consultation took place between&#xD;
him and Mike, of which it is necessary to record only&#xD;
that Pete agreed to be at a certain grove near the&#xD;
mansion of Willowbank, with his cart, 'on the next&#xD;
evening, in consideration that he should receive a&#xD;
certain share of the spoils; that he was to~ take with&#xD;
him three pistols and some saddles, which the negroes&#xD;
were to use in mounting themselves on-stolen horses;&#xD;
that he was to be accompanied by two men, who&#xD;
had agreed with Mike to run away, and that the spoil&#xD;
was to be carried to a convenient spot for division,&#xD;
and the plate reduced to a suitable form for trans..&#xD;
portation by the fugitives.&#xD;
&#xD;
CHAPTER XVII..&#xD;
INSURRECTION.&#xD;
THE next morning-it was Sunday-when Colonel&#xD;
Fairfax walked out upon~ the lawn in front of his&#xD;
house, he saw a large number of his slaves collected&#xD;
in clusters about the grounds, and discovered at once&#xD;
that there was agitation among them. PrEsently Joe&#xD;
advanced as their spokesman, and inform d his mas-&#xD;
ter that the ser~rants were in great alarm on account&#xD;
of rumors which they understood were afloat. The&#xD;
rumors were that the negroes were plotting insurrec-&#xD;
tion, and that some of the white men had organized&#xD;
themselves a~ a committee of vigilance, to suppress&#xD;
the conspiracy. They feared the violence of these&#xD;
men, acting, as they believed, under a groundless&#xD;
panic. The Colonel was aware that such panics were&#xD;
usually attended with danger to the negroes. The&#xD;
greatest excitement was apt to inflame the £nind~ of&#xD;
those who owned few or no slaves. Owners of many&#xD;
slaves, living among them, could easily bring all in-&#xD;
ors of servile commotion to the test of actual obser-&#xD;
ation, and, besides, they felt bound by interest and&#xD;
JULYto protect their servants against the effects of&#xD;
incautious suspicion. Others who had not the same&#xD;
opportunity of knowledge, nor the same response~&#xD;
biity; allow~l their imaginations to be stuffed with&#xD;
unsit'ted rep~ts and horrid 'alarms. Colonel Fairfax&#xD;
had already heard some of the rumors which were in&#xD;
circulation, and after listening to Joe, lie said-.-&#xD;
&#xD;
182&#xD;
&#xD;
183&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb  n="184-185" xml:id="VAC7684-00000093"/>&#xD;
"Well, Joe, what do you think about this in~urrec-&#xD;
tion?"&#xD;
"Lord, master, da won't be no resurrection of fig-&#xD;
gers, sure ?" - -&#xD;
"I wish to talk with some of the other boys about&#xD;
it."&#xD;
"Dey will be mighty glad, master."&#xD;
The colonel went among them, and conversed with&#xD;
many of them, separately and together. ~Being tho-&#xD;
roughly acquainted with their habits, he was able to&#xD;
glean from them all they knew or believed, and to de~&#xD;
terrine what was true. Indeed his servants, having&#xD;
confidence in hiajustice, seldom-attempted to deceive&#xD;
him, unless it might be by that sort of exaggeration&#xD;
which a negro regards as but a decent dress of naked&#xD;
truth. He became convinced that there was no&#xD;
danger of au insurrection. He promised his servants&#xD;
tEa protection which They desired, and admonished&#xD;
them to keep closely to their work in day-time, and&#xD;
to their cabins at night,&#xD;
At the church, that day, he heard' of popular excite-&#xD;
ment and of preparations which threatened violence&#xD;
to the negroes. He exerted all his influence with the&#xD;
people whom he met, to allay the excitement, and to&#xD;
discourage rash action. When' he returned home,&#xD;
his anxiety on the subject was ~o great that, after&#xD;
dinner, he rode out in search of the persons who&#xD;
were reported to be\engaged in the lawless organiza-&#xD;
tiou for the suppression of insurrection. He had not&#xD;
gone far fron~* home, when he met half a dozen men&#xD;
on horseback, ~armed with fowling-pieces and pistols.&#xD;
He knew them to be ignorant persons of inflammable&#xD;
tempers, and they we're manifestly under great ex-&#xD;
citamazit. One of them, who seemed to be a ring-&#xD;

leader was our acquaintance, Bob Fans, who had not&#xD;
yet executed his purpose to enter the army and fight&#xD;
for the principles of free governments On meeting&#xD;
Colonel Fairfax they addressed himK civilly, though&#xD;
abruptly. They asked what 'steps h~ had taken to&#xD;
prevent his negroes from joining in the projected in~&#xD;
surrection. He told them that he did not believe&#xD;
there was any such plot, and that, having no fear of&#xD;
his servants, he had, done nothing but advise them to&#xD;
remain quiet at home, until the agitation should sub-&#xD;
side. They angrily ~rebuked his negligence, an-&#xD;
nounced themselves as a voli~iteer patrol for the regu-&#xD;
lation of negroes and abolitiei~z ists, informed him that&#xD;
they had conclusive proofs \~f ~a wide-spread con-&#xD;
spiracy, with Yankee leader~, and finally declared&#xD;
they were going to examine ~is slaves, and arrest all&#xD;
of them whom they might fihd to be accomplices.&#xD;
He remonstrated, atid rea~on~ with them upon the&#xD;
impropriety of their conduct, he folly of~ their fears,&#xD;
and the mischiefs they a out to \cause. He ad-&#xD;
vised them to abandon their lawless organization, and&#xD;
appeal to the magistrates'iii du~ form.~ Their minds&#xD;
were too highly inflamed to listen to reason, and in&#xD;
the face of such imminent and horrible danger as&#xD;
they fancied, they would not await the slow operation&#xD;
of law. 'He then offered to pledge himself for the&#xD;
good behavior of his servants, and besought the&#xD;
patrol not to molest his family and dependents with&#xD;
their inquisition. They professed respect for him&#xD;
and his family, but insisted that he was deluding him-&#xD;
self with misplaced reliance on the fidelity of his&#xD;
slaves, and they felt bound to proceed. "Then, gen-&#xD;
tleni~n," he said, firmly, "let me 'warn you that you&#xD;
will encounter resistance. I will protect my servants.&#xD;

I have arms." He turned his horse's head homeward~&#xD;
and left them. Before he was out of hearing, Bob&#xD;
Fans called him back, and informed him that they had&#xD;
consulted together and concluded, out of respect for&#xD;
him, not to visit his plantation that evening. They&#xD;
swore, however, that Palmer, the - old abolition-&#xD;
ist, should n~t escape. They rode off toward that&#xD;
part of the county in which Palmer resided.&#xD;
Colonel Fairfi~x, thu~ apprised that there was dan-&#xD;
ger of violence to that gentleman, sat a few minutes&#xD;
considering how it might be averted. It was nearly&#xD;
dark. He was reluctant to go so far from hi~ own&#xD;
house as to Palmer's while the neighborhood was&#xD;
disturbed. But he. could think of no other way to&#xD;
prevent a disgraceful if not fatal scene. As any de-&#xD;
lay might defeat Jiis purpose, he set off at ~once, rid-&#xD;
ing rapidly, and taking a by-path which saved some&#xD;
distance and enabled him to pass the patrol without&#xD;
being seen. In little more than au~.hour he arrived&#xD;
at Mr. Palmer's house. That gentleman received him&#xD;
with surprise and embarrassment. He was not~aware&#xD;
of the danger in. which he stood at that moment, but&#xD;
he was conscious of participation hi a scheme which&#xD;
might prove perilous to hi~ visitor. The latter pro-&#xD;
ceeded at once to make known the circumstances&#xD;
which induced his visit, and expressed the opinion&#xD;
that the regulators would be at the door in a few&#xD;
minutes. He added a hope that he might be able to&#xD;
~is~uade them from violence) but advised Mr. Palmer&#xD;
to retire from the house for a short time, offering to&#xD;
remain with the family and save them from insult.&#xD;
But Palmer, whose domestic affections were strong,&#xD;
and who did xiot lack courage to defend his- house-&#xD;
hold, refused to leave, his family. He told his wif~,'&#xD;
&#xD;
and daughters of the danger, and directed them to re-&#xD;
main quiet in their chambers, whatever might happen.&#xD;
The colonel avowed his readiness to assist in defend-&#xD;
* ing the house and person of Mr. Palmer. The latter&#xD;
brought out his arms-two revolving pistols and a&#xD;
double-barrelled fowling piece loaded with buckshot.&#xD;
All the weapons were kept loaded, in anticipation of&#xD;
* trouble, which was constantly apprehended by the&#xD;
owner of them. The hasty preparations for defence&#xD;
were scarcely completed when the tramp~ of horses&#xD;
was heard.&#xD;
The horsemen quickly dismounted and posted them.~&#xD;
selves in preconcerted order aboiit the house, to pre-&#xD;
vent the escape of Palmer. Fans then drew near&#xD;
the front door and knocked ~t it for admittance. Mr.&#xD;
Palmer opened a, window and would have spoken,&#xD;
but the colonel drew him back and i'equested permis-&#xD;
sion ~to try his influence with the patrol. Looking&#xD;
out of the window, he said-&#xD;
"Fans, what do you want V'&#xD;
"Heavens!" exclaimed Fans, "Colonel Fred's here&#xD;
too."&#xD;
"Ycs,. I am 'here before you, and I am still deter-&#xD;
mined to prevent you from disgracing yourselves by&#xD;
lawless violence. ~Tow tell me what you intend to do G?~~&#xD;
"We want the old abolitionist, and we will have ~&#xD;
him, colonel."&#xD;
"What has he done ?"&#xD;
"He's at the bottom of the insurrection."&#xD;
"How do you know that 'i?"&#xD;
"A nigger confessed it all."&#xD;
"I suppose the negro was in the hAnds of your&#xD;
patrol V'&#xD;
"Of course he was."&#xD;

"You Ilogged him to make him confess'?"&#xD;
"Of course we did."&#xD;
"On. the extorted confession of a negro you pro-&#xD;
ceed to this outrage, then !"&#xD;
now his t4ory's true."&#xD;
"How can you know it'? If you are so sure of it,&#xD;
go t~a magistrate and get a legal warrant. Shame&#xD;
on such lawlessness!"&#xD;
"Colonel, it's no use talking. We are bound to&#xD;
have him out."&#xD;
"Then you must take me first. Beware! You&#xD;
are in n~ore danger than Mr. Palmer4"&#xD;
At this moment .screams of women were 'heard in&#xD;
the house. During the parley one of the besiegers,&#xD;
tempted by an unfastened sash, entered a back win-&#xD;
dow. Hurrying forward in the dark, he opened the&#xD;
door of. j~Irs. Palmer's chamber and rushed in. The&#xD;
ladies screamed, and Mrs. Palmer ran to the. parlor&#xD;
in which the gentlemen were, followed by the in-&#xD;
truder. 'As soon as he appeared, Mr. Palmer fired a&#xD;
pistol .at him, but missed him. The intruder attempted&#xD;
t~o seize that gentleman, at the same time brandishing&#xD;
a knife. As he turned towards Mr. Palmer, Colonel&#xD;
Faiifax grasped him round the body, lifted him from&#xD;
the floor, carried him to the front window, which had&#xD;
been opened, and. hurled him out. He fell, heavily to&#xD;
the ground, and lay there, stunned by the fall.&#xD;
'All this . passed so rapidly that Paris stood still at&#xD;
the spot from which he had held the parley, and was&#xD;
waiting for some explanation of the noise within the&#xD;
house, when he saw his comrade hurled from the&#xD;
window. He imagined that the man had been killed&#xD;
by the pistol-shot. He was afraid to approach the&#xD;
window. He withdrew to a more remote part of the&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
grounds. After waiting a short time in vain for his&#xD;
fallen comrade to rise and follow him, he began to&#xD;
consider that the house was prepared for defence,&#xD;
that the defence was resolute and might be desperate,&#xD;
tInt it was condtmcted by a citizen of unblemished&#xD;
reputation and great influence, and that in the end&#xD;
the penalties of law might b~i enforced. lie there-&#xD;

forces. Soon afterwards the man who had been&#xD;
thrown froni the window crawled aivay and followed&#xD;
his comrades.&#xD;
At first it could not be known how far they had&#xD;
gone nor how soon they might return. It. was some&#xD;
time before the alarm of the ladies subsided. To&#xD;
assure them of safety and to resist another attack, if&#xD;
another~ should be made, Colonel Fairfa~~ remained&#xD;
until a late hour of the night. When, all danger&#xD;
appeared to be over, the colonel, now anxious for the&#xD;
security of his own home, was about to depart. The&#xD;
ladies were profuse in expressions of gratitude to&#xD;
him. Mrs. Palmer 'paid out a neat little speech,&#xD;
redolent of fine sentiments and garnished with scraps&#xD;
of Latin. Even Mr. Palmer so far overcame the&#xD;
restraints of habitual reserve and conscious turpitude&#xD;
as to thank the coi~nel quite warmly. He accom-&#xD;
panied him out of the door and detained him a&#xD;
minute or two on the portico to repeat his grateful&#xD;
words. While he was th~is employed, a pistol was&#xD;
fired in the shadow of one of the pillar~ of the por-&#xD;
tico. A moment afterwards a negro man rushed from&#xD;
the pillar and aimed a blow with a pistol at Mr.&#xD;
Palmer's head. Colonel Faitfax, throwing up his&#xD;
arm, intercepted the blow~ The negro, foiled in both&#xD;
his murderous attempts, ran past and soon disap-&#xD;

"It was Mike," he remarked, but he offered no&#xD;
conjecture as ~to the probable motive of the~ass~j*lt,.&#xD;
nor did he propose pursuit. This incident renewed&#xD;
the agitation and alarm of the ladies, and. detained&#xD;
the colonel still longer. At length he started home-&#xD;
ward.&#xD;
I)uring his absence from Roebuckevents had hap-&#xD;
pened which it is necessary now to recount. On&#xD;
Sunday afternoon his daughter, Jigia, went two or*&#xD;
three miles from home to 'visit a poor woman who was&#xD;
sick. Finding the woman q~iite ill she remained with&#xD;
her until it was growing dark.~ Then, mounting her&#xD;
horse-her favorite "Arab "-she started homeward&#xD;
alone. Her road was little more than a biidle-~ath,&#xD;
and led through the skirt of a wood by the spring&#xD;
which wa~ called the Poplar Spring, and which, it may&#xD;
be remembered, Mike had appointed as the place&#xD;
where Jake and ~1at6 were' to meet him about the&#xD;
same hour that Julia was riding home. The spring&#xD;
rose just beside the path and flowed across it. When&#xD;
Julia was ~passing it her horse dropped hi&amp;amp; head to&#xD;
drink, and she permitted him to stop. While he was&#xD;
drinking three negro men stepped into the path. One&#xD;
of them seized the bridle; the other two posted them-&#xD;
selves at each' side of the horse. Each of them car-&#xD;
ried a club. They said nothing. She was surprised,&#xD;
but she was not ac~ustomed'to fear'iiegroes. Even&#xD;
their formidable appearance and movement did not&#xD;
deprive her of courage. Instantly drawing her rein,&#xD;
she struck Arab sharply with her riding-switch, in-&#xD;
tending to break away from the fellow who held the&#xD;

bridle. The horse sprang forward, but the negro held&#xD;
fast, and threw him back on his haunches.&#xD;
"You better be quiet," he then 'said. She leaned&#xD;
forward and struck him. across the flice with her&#xD;
switch, saying, "J3~gone! how dare you 1" He&#xD;
winced, but still held the bridle~&#xD;
"Better 'be quiet, I tell you agin, Miss Fairfax;&#xD;
you shan't be hurt; close up dar, boys;. don't let her&#xD;
git a~*~y."&#xD;
"Who are you ?"&#xD;
"I's Palmer's Mike. I don't keer wh~ knows me,&#xD;
but I won't tell you who dese other fellers is."&#xD;
"What are you going to do with me?"&#xD;
"Jis take you to a safe place."&#xD;
"For what purpose ?"&#xD;
Mike made no reply. He set the party in motion,&#xD;
turning from the' road into the pathless wood, himself&#xD;
~holding the bridle and the other two n~en walking&#xD;
close by the sides of the horse. They ~went on silently&#xD;
for some time. Their progress was slow among the&#xD;
trees and thickets. Their course led them into the&#xD;
deepest part of the forest. Julia, ignorant of their&#xD;
design and of her destination, a prisoner of three black&#xD;
ruffians, could not wholly resist the depre~siug influ-&#xD;
ence of these alarming circumstance. In the gloom&#xD;
of night and of the 'wilderness her imagination was&#xD;
tilled with frightful visions of coming danger. She&#xD;
watched in vain for some opportunity of escape.&#xD;
Several times she attempted to converse with her cap-&#xD;
tors and to learn her probable fate. But they main-&#xD;
~tained a sullen and ominous silence.. Still her natural&#xD;
courage was nQt. quite subdued. By a vigorous effort&#xD;
she kept her faculties in readiness for an emergency&#xD;
or an oppQrt4lnity, in spite ~f the quick beating of her&#xD;

heart. Inthe dense wood sometimes the low branches&#xD;
of the trees almost swept her from her saddle. This&#xD;
annoyance at last suggested to her a method of&#xD;
escape.&#xD;
A long, large limb, growing square'~ out from th~&#xD;
body of a beech tree, at a height level with her chin&#xD;
as she sat upright, was about to st4ke her face in the&#xD;
darkness. She happened to discover it in time to&#xD;
throw her arms over it. In that way she lifted herself&#xD;
out of the saddle and let her horse walk from beneath&#xD;
her. She remained thus suspended in the air until the&#xD;
negroes h&amp;amp;d passed on so far that ~he thought they&#xD;
could not hear the noise of her movement, and then&#xD;
she swung herself along to the body of the tree, and&#xD;
then, climbing above the limb, she sat upon it. She&#xD;
intended to xeniaiu there until her captors, who would,&#xD;
doubtless, niiss her very soon~ should have failed in a&#xD;
search for her ~and left the wood free for her escape.&#xD;
In a few minutes they discoveted that she was not&#xD;
upon the horse. Mike railed at his followers for their&#xD;
negligence, and they were wholly unable to conjecture&#xD;
how or where she had eluded their vigilance. They&#xD;
aU turned back and commenced a search for her in&#xD;
every direction through the forest. She could hear&#xD;
them shouting to each other and sometimes consulting&#xD;
together. Mike appeared to apprehend serious conse.&#xD;
quences from her escape, and gave vent to his chagrin&#xD;
in curses. When they had been searching a long&#xD;
time and seemed almost in despair ~! success, Mike,&#xD;
still leading her horse, passed under ~the branch ~ou&#xD;
which. she was perched. The sagacious and affection~&#xD;
ate Arab raised his head and uttered the low whinny..&#xD;
ing sound which is the natural note of recognition&#xD;
and of pleasure with. his kind. The attention of Mike&#xD;

the branches, and in a short tinie he discovered, his&#xD;
captive. She was compelled to descend and resume&#xD;
her place in the saddle. Theni~efortk the vigilance of&#xD;
the guard was redoubled, and avoiding' the darkest&#xD;
parts of the forest, they moved along paths which&#xD;
were known to the negroes. Now ~nd thea they&#xD;
paused and whis~ei4ng' consultations took place&#xD;
among them, which Miss~ Fairfair was~ n~t permitted&#xD;
to hear. Some of these conversation~, however,&#xD;
appeared to be on the point. of running into violent&#xD;
disputes between Mike'and Jake, ~u4she thought her&#xD;

of auger. how long a time or how far she had been&#xD;
journeying in captivity she could not determinee, when&#xD;
Jake, who walked on her l~eft, approached very cloBe&#xD;
to the horse, and laid his~hand upon her arm. "Stand&#xD;
back, 'villain !" ~he cried, and the. cry arresting Mike,&#xD;
he turned back towards her just aS his rufflanly oom~~&#xD;
rade seized Miss Fairfai by the waist. She screamed&#xD;
and struggled, but she wasaschild in the grasp of the&#xD;
stout negro. Mike sprang at him, wrenched his hands&#xD;
from Julia; and flung him upon. the earth; His fob&#xD;

ter struck him ou the head with his club and felled&#xD;
him. Jake lay outstretohed as if he was dead, and&#xD;
Mike, not, knowing whether he was dead or alive, left&#xD;
him and resumed the march. 'He took care, however,&#xD;
to supply the place of the musing guard by his own&#xD;

came upon a road and she ~aw Marlin's cabin, which&#xD;
- they were abont to pass. The sight of it revived her&#xD;
'hope of escape~. When they came nearly opposite to&#xD;
.the cabin she suddenly struck her horse with all her&#xD;
force, and~ at the same time called the name of Mrs.&#xD;
Marlin. Arab hounded with such violence that he&#xD;
overthrew Mike, but the determined fellow held fast&#xD;
by the bridle an4 was dragged along the ground. She&#xD;
repeated her blows until the spirited horse was plung-&#xD;
'ing frantically, but still Mike held' ~n. ~She repeated&#xD;
her cries also until: N[r~. ~Marlin ran out of the cabin..&#xD;
Awakened and startled by the voice of~alarm, she&#xD;
hurried towards her door and stumbled over a stool.&#xD;
The accident, and' her quick apprehension of danger,&#xD;
prompted her to pick up the stool and carry, it ~ith&#xD;
her as a weapon of defence. Hastening into -the rtad,&#xD;
she recognized the voice and the horse of Julia, and&#xD;
saw Cato running about her~ ~dvancingto~the rescue&#xD;
2 of her friend, she gave ~ato a vigorous blow with the&#xD;
weapon she carried in her hand, and that timid rascal&#xD;
rolled over in the dirt. He lay very quiet, affecting&#xD;
to be quife disabled. Mike, seeing the turn~ which&#xD;
affairs 'had 'taken, let go the bridle, scrambled to his&#xD;
feet avid ran away.&#xD;
Mrs. Marlin then assisted J~ulia' to alight. She was&#xD;
much ~fatigued, and with the revulsion ~f feeling that&#xD;
overcame her when she ~aw that she was free, she&#xD;
became faint. The good Woman led her into the&#xD;

ever, the young lady declared herself able to ride,&#xD;
an4 thanking her kind, friends, she determined to&#xD;
return home immediately. 'She knew that her father&#xD;
and mother would be in great'distress and alarm on&#xD;
account of her absence, and ~he was anxious to re-&#xD;
lieve them as soon ,as possible. Mrs. Marlin' would&#xD;
have persuaded her. to take some Tepose, and offered&#xD;
to 'ride to Roebuck herself. When she could not&#xD;
prevail in ~this, she, insisted on walking beside the&#xD;
horse, as an escort for Julia. But ~Xi~s Fairfax&#xD;
wd~uld not suffer her to undertake such a journey&#xD;
afoot, and expr~saed her- belief that she would be in&#xD;
no further danger during that night. She had quite&#xD;
recovered ~her courage and resolved to ride home&#xD;
alone. But when she left the cabin for that purpose,&#xD;
her horse was net to be found. i3oth he and Cato&#xD;
had disappeared.&#xD;
What~then was to be done? The distance to Roe-&#xD;
'buck was not less than si~ miles. Julia, whose&#xD;
strength Was almost exhausted' by the events of the&#xD;
night, was wholly unable' to walk so far. Yet she&#xD;
could nq1~ bear to leave her parents without intelli.-&#xD;
gence of her safety: After much discussion she was&#xD;
about 'to accede to the proposal of Mrs.' Marlin to&#xD;
\valk to Roebuck, when~ Eliza offered to go to Wil-&#xD;
lowbank and procure ~a horse for Miss" Fairfax. It&#xD;
would be a,~~ra1k of about two miles, and it might be&#xD;
attended with some danger, as the occurrences of the~&#xD;
night had proved. But the warm-hearted girl desired&#xD;
to serye her friend, and the idea of danger, father&#xD;
stimulated than daunted her. Wheii the p1~oj~ct had&#xD;
'taken possession of, her lively little brain she did not&#xD;
test until she had brought her mother and Miss Fair-&#xD;
fax to consent to it, and then she tripped away through&#xD;
the darkness.&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb  n="196-197" xml:id="VAC7684-00000099"/>&#xD;
Before there was time for her to have sent a horse&#xD;
from Wi11ow~bank, a neigh was heard by the women&#xD;
, in the cabin, and Julia, who was lying down, lifted&#xD;
her head and said, "that's Arab." They went out&#xD;
and found that her horse had returned and was stand-&#xD;
ing at the gate. Without further delay Julia mounted&#xD;
him and turned his bead homeward.~ Mrs. Marlin&#xD;
walked half a mile with her, and then, as no sign of&#xD;
danger appeared, and she was retarding the impatient&#xD;
horse-woman, she was persuaded to return. The road&#xD;
to Roebuck was rather obscure and rough, being but&#xD;
little travelled. At night it was~ di~eary. Juli rode&#xD;
on, however, safely and pretty briskly, until' s was&#xD;
about two miles'from the cabin. Then she was slowly&#xD;
ascending a 'hill, and on turning' round a jutting&#xD;
point, she saw a black, man walking towards her&#xD;
and already close to her horse's head. She did not&#xD;
know the truculent Jake, but he recognized her, and&#xD;
immediately seizing her bridle, raised his club. His&#xD;
thffeatening movement startled her, but '~he did not&#xD;
lose her presence 'of mind. Seeing that by no effort&#xD;
could she escape, she determhi~d to try the effect of&#xD;
talking to the fellow.&#xD;
"What do you want 'P' she asked.&#xD;
"1 want you," he answered, and instantly clutched&#xD;
her arm in his great, rough hand. He dragged her&#xD;
downward with such sudden violence that she fell&#xD;
heavily to the ground. Jake stooped' over 'her and&#xD;
then paused. He heard the clatter of a horse's hoofs&#xD;
on the road. He~stood listening and looking until he&#xD;
'ascertained 'that a horseman, rapidly approaching, was&#xD;
near at hand, and then he plunged from the road&#xD;
down the hill-side' into a wood. He left Miss Fairfax&#xD;
lying almost insensible. When the horseman arrived&#xD;
&#xD;
he leaped fi'om his saddle and knelt by her side. He&#xD;
lifted her head and said, in a tone of tender anxiety-.&#xD;
"Julia, are ~ou hurt ~"&#xD;
Receiving no reply, he placed his arm about her,~&#xD;
drawing her head to his breast and said, "Julia, dear&#xD;
Julia, Ttell me-are you hurt ~"&#xD;
She feebly answered, "no, not much."' Presently&#xD;
reviving somewhat, she adaed,"" no, thank Heaven, I&#xD;
am tiot- hurt.. I was frightened. My nerves are&#xD;
shaken, but I feel uo pain.". After another pause she&#xD;
continued, "I can rise now."&#xD;
But he whispered, "rest a moment-you are not&#xD;
yet strong enough."&#xD;
Then looking up, she asked, "whom. shall I thank&#xD;
for this deliverance ~" and as the moon, gleaming&#xD;
through the tree-tops, ~began to give some light, she&#xD;
exclaimed-..-" it is Captain Fitzhugh."&#xD;
"Ye~it is I," he replied.&#xD;
0, how thankful I am," she murinr red.&#xD;
With his assistance she rose and sto6d'a little while,&#xD;
not without his support. Then, as she recovered her&#xD;
strength, she blushed. and withdrew from his arm,&#xD;
saying she was able to ride. After as~isting her to&#xD;
her saddle, Captain Fitzh'ugh.-.--no longer captain,&#xD;
however, for the major of his. regiment bad died. of&#xD;
wounds received at Mana~sa and he had aucce~ded to&#xD;

Jaor~e, the alarm whidt she would' give "might: lead to&#xD;

to set oft' on his long journey. Besides, in tempting&#xD;
to' justify a rash act to himself he conceived a vague&#xD;
notion that she might be valuable as a hostage in cer-&#xD;
tain contingencies. His conduct and his reasoning&#xD;
were alike absurd, and served to prove how incompe..&#xD;

Mike, followed by the two negro men whom he had&#xD;
just enlisted in the scheme of burglary, approached&#xD;
the front door of the house, expecting it to be opened&#xD;
by Hannibal. The whole house was dark and quiet.&#xD;
lie made a concerted sign at the' door, but it was not&#xD;
opened. He whispered the name of Hannibal through&#xD;
the key-hole, but heard no response. He, went along&#xD;
the poi'ch~ and at every window ende~vored to attract&#xD;
the notice Qf his confederate. Siill Hannibal gate no&#xD;
answer. Mike had almost concluded that he had&#xD;
failed to fulfil' his engagement iirhen one of his meh,&#xD;
listening at the door, heard a loud snore within. Han-&#xD;
nibal had stationed himself there at the appointed&#xD;
hour, 'but during the delay which occurred he- fell&#xD;
asleep. Becoming convinced that he was there, Mike&#xD;
was at a loss how to wake him without arousing all&#xD;
the inmates. After scratching his woolly pate for&#xD;
some time, he hit upon a plan. He found the old door&#xD;
fitted its~ frame so ill that there was apace for the in-&#xD;
sertion of a small stick beneath. it. He procured a&#xD;
rod, sharpened it, and began to puncture the person&#xD;
'of the somnolent Hannibal. Partially awaking, that&#xD;
sentinel uttered; "ugh, ugh," and sunk back into pro-&#xD;
found sleep. But by perseverance in punching and&#xD;
whispering, Mike finallyjoused himf up, and he opened&#xD;
the door. While he stood rubbing his eyes the three&#xD;
men, who entered passed by him, groped their way&#xD;
to the fQot of the stairs and began to ascend. At that&#xD;
moment they~were startled by a light which appeared&#xD;
at the head of the stairs.&#xD;
Mrs. Fitz'hngh being a nerVous invalid, never slept&#xD;
profoundly~ She had heard almost the first sound made&#xD;
by the negroes on the porch. When it was repeated&#xD;
she called her Bervant, Belle, ~ faithful negress, who&#xD;
&#xD;
I'&#xD;
&#xD;
ROEBUCK.&#xD;
&#xD;
'201&#xD;
&#xD;
slept in the same room, and sent her to ascertain the&#xD;
cause of the noiae. She retni-ned and reported her&#xD;
belief that robbers were trying to break into the house.&#xD;
Her mistress made her ugh a candle at a:taper which&#xD;
was kept burning dimly in(the chamber. Mrs. Fitz-&#xD;
hugh rose and took down fri old sword which hung&#xD;
in the room and which ha~ belonged to her deceased&#xD;
husband. She directed B~~e to arm herself with the&#xD;
old lady's cane, and then the two women 'sallied out&#xD;
of the chamber to the head of the stairs. The servant&#xD;
set the candle on a stand in the hall and they peered&#xD;
downward to discover what was passing at the front&#xD;
door. It was then that Mike and his accomplices&#xD;
started up the steps.&#xD;
When they came into the light, Mrs. Fitzhugh,&#xD;
seeing 'that they were negroes, sternly ordered~ them&#xD;
to go back,~ ~nd haughtily rebuked their insolence in&#xD;
thusintrtiding into the house. of a lady. They kept&#xD;
until they' stood upon the landing of the stairs, a&#xD;
few steps 'below the two women, and facing them.&#xD;
Mike then paused. It was part of his plan to avoid&#xD;
fatal violence, W possible. He saw th~Ct the women&#xD;
were prepared to make resistance, and, he knew the&#xD;
proud and resolute spirit of Mrs. Fitzkugh. She&#xD;
stood before him in her night-dress, pale, emaciated&#xD;
and feeble, but holding a sword and breathing scorn-&#xD;
ful defiance. He did not doubt his ability to over-&#xD;
come her resistance, bat he hesitated to ~commence a&#xD;
conflictt in which blood might be shed. Perhaps, too,&#xD;
the habitual~ ascendancy of the white rac~' somewhat&#xD;
cowed his spirit. But, after standing a short time,&#xD;
the temptation of plunder ~r ~he reckless feeling that&#xD;
he had gone too far to recede prdVailed. He rushed&#xD;
forward. The two men whQ had stood cowering be:&#xD;

bind him while he hesitated did not immediately fol..&#xD;
low him. As he approached the head e~ the stairs&#xD;
alone,, Belle, who stood above him, struck a blow with&#xD;
the cane, ~which sent him swaying and staggering&#xD;
back to the landing. He soon recQvered his balance,.&#xD;
and enraged by the stroke, he~ called upon the ether&#xD;
men~to follow, and was about to ascend a~aun.' But&#xD;
Ilannibal~ iiow fully awake, and hearing the noise of&#xD;
conflict, cried from below-~" you 'shan't~i~rt missus.&#xD;
You promised you wouldn't hurt inissus." The&#xD;
worthless fellow, willing to rob his mistress if h~&#xD;
might share the 'spoil, had too much gratitude for the&#xD;
indulgence&amp;amp; which had- ruined him, or was too faithful'&#xD;
to permit any personal injury to be inflicted upon&#xD;
her. He ran up the stairs with long strides, and&#xD;
seizing one of the men by the throat, began to drag&#xD;
him down; Just then another persZn unexpectedly&#xD;
entered the scenes A white man ran up the steps,&#xD;
and hurrying pasl7 the others, caught Mike,' when h~,&#xD;
bad almost reached the floor above, and. hurled him&#xD;
back headlong to the landing. ' Snatching the'sword&#xD;
from 'Mrs. Fitzhugh, he faced about and' descended&#xD;
towards the negroes. They did not wait for him, but&#xD;
leaped, rolled Or tumbled down the stairs pell..mell,&#xD;
and escaped,' "My dear' Hugh! My' brave' son!&#xD;
Thank God!" exclaimed Mrs. Fitzhugh. ' ' £&#xD;
There was' not time after this affair for many ex-&#xD;
planations' between her an~ her son, when Eliza Mar..&#xD;
lin arrived" on the errand she had undertaken for~ Miss&#xD;
Fairfax. When h6~ story had been briefly told, Mrs.&#xD;
Fitzhugh asked her son if he was too much fatigmed&#xD;
~ to go to the relief of JulIa.' ~He' was eager to act~&#xD;
upon the suggestion, and since his mother was willing,&#xD;
and be i~houghv there was no danger of a'~renewal of&#xD;

RO~B1ICIC.&#xD;
the attack at Willowbank during his absence,~ 'he&#xD;
started off, and though his horse was jaded, he rode&#xD;
rapidly. He directed a servant to follow him to Mar~.&#xD;
liii's cabin with a horse for Julia. At the' cabin he&#xD;
heard ~vhat the reader knows of her departure, and.'&#xD;
hastened to overtake her;&#xD;
When Mike's attem~t~ at"robbery was Aefeated, he&#xD;
ran tq the, grove iii which he had left blind Pete, and&#xD;
mounted a horse which one of the negroes had stolen&#xD;
and broifght there. He rode 'away, leaving his ac~&#xD;
coinplices without any explanation of his purpose or&#xD;
any instruction for their own conduct. Frightened'&#xD;
~nd furious, he thought only of perpetrating- an i~ct&#xD;
of vengeance ajid' then flying from the country. He&#xD;
'went to 'the house of Mr. Palmer, with no ddhiite&#xD;
plan, but with a general purpose of revenge. To 'his&#xD;
surprise, he found a front window open and light&#xD;
streaming through it.' Peeping in, he saw colonel l&#xD;
Fairfax, seated with Mr. Palmer, and he.' then sta-&#xD;
tioned himself by a pillar, to wait for the colonel's&#xD;
departure and for his own opportunity. 'liehad been&#xD;
there but a short time when the, opportunity offered&#xD;
itsdt; and he attempted to take the life of his master.&#xD;
F'ailung in that attempt, he' concluded that nothing&#xD;
remained for 'him but speedy flight. But the Federal&#xD;
lines were distant, and he distrusted his own ability to&#xD;
make his way to. them. lie had before thotrght of&#xD;
inducing Campbell to act as a pilot for the fugitive&#xD;
l)~rty-~-lle now resolved to apply~to him. 'Going' t&amp;amp;&#xD;
the village, he sought the ;'ear of the Swan tavern,&#xD;
and by a method which he had already i~sed' for ~&#xD;
clandestine interview~with C~npbell, obtained admiP&#xD;
tance into his chamber. Rousing him from sleep, he&#xD;
told that ambitious plotter "of insurrection that Uap~.&#xD;

tam Fitzlmgh, with his whole company, had returned&#xD;
to ~the county, ~that they had 4hat night attacked a&#xD;
large party of armed negroes and defeated them, and&#xD;
werethen approaching the village to arrest Qamphell.&#xD;
That gentleman, dreadfhlly alarmed, anticipated Mike's&#xD;
suggestion if flight, and thankfully accepted the ne&#xD;
gro's offer to go With him.&#xD;
"But I have no horse," said Campbell,. in an agi-.&#xD;
tated tone.&#xD;
"Da's a good boss in de stable of dis tavern,." said&#xD;
Mike.&#xD;
"J3ut ha is not mine."&#xD;
"Den steal Mm."       -&#xD;
This sharp solution of the difficulty was perforce&#xD;
accepted, though Mike's unceremonious-designation&#xD;
of the process of appropriation was more consonant&#xD;
with the negr9's morality than with the white man's&#xD;
pride. Pride and. honor,. with human and divine&#xD;
laws, yield to military necessity. In the grey of the.&#xD;
nrnrningtQampbell and hi~ sable comrade, mounted&#xD;
on stQleU horses, caught a last glimpse of 'the distant&#xD;
village.&#xD;
Wh~n (Jolon~el Fairfax, after foiling Mike's last&#xD;
attempt upon Mr. Palmer's. life, returned to Uce-.&#xD;
buck, he ~aa astonished at meeting with his wife in&#xD;
the aveuue.~ She was walking there, in deep distress.&#xD;
* His i~rst thought was that his absenee~from home had&#xD;
excited such fear~ for his .safety that she had stai'ted&#xD;
out in search of him. Then he thougl~t~-but before&#xD;
hecould shape out axiother CQnje(~ture, Mrs. Fairfax&#xD;
had. cried-"~Julia---la~e you seen 9ur own'~ dear&#xD;
Julia ~ ~ have ~lost her." Wringing her hands,'&#xD;
s~e gave way to grief and apprehension. Her bus-.&#xD;
ban4, *~lariued by her cries and tears, could not imme-&#xD;
&#xD;
diately obtain from her an intelligible explanation.&#xD;
At length he learned that ~Julia had 'not returned&#xD;
home, and that during the night search had been&#xD;
made for her in every direction and by every person&#xD;
oii the plantation, without finding her or discovering&#xD;
any clue to the mystery 'of her disappearance. .The&#xD;
last that could be heard of her was that, after'.visiting&#xD;
the sick neighbor, she had started to~go home alone&#xD;
about dark. The servants were still searching the&#xD;
fields, the woods and the roads. Doctor Dick, though&#xD;
riding was yet painful to him, was scouring the coun-&#xD;
tr~ in pursuit of his favorite niece. Several wounded&#xD;
Confederate soldiers 'who were entertained at Roe.~&#xD;
buck, as in a hospital, had left their beds and, on&#xD;
crutches, were looking about in impossible places for&#xD;
the 'missing matron of their infirmary. Everybody&#xD;
loved Julia.&#xD;
When her rather had reflected a moment on what&#xD;
was told him, he inquired whether any one had gone:&#xD;
~o Marlin's cabin. He was told that some otthe ser-&#xD;
~vants had been sent on the road which led in that 'db&#xD;
reetjon, but ~t was not known that any one had&#xD;
thought of going the whole distance~ "to Marlin's.&#xD;
Without any distinct reason for sup osing that she&#xD;
might 'be heard of there, her father could not discoyer&#xD;
that anything had' been 'left' undone wj~ich was less&#xD;
unpromising than inquiry at that place.. Inpatient&#xD;
to do something that might enable him to trace his&#xD;
daughter, and agitated by fears which even her mother&#xD;
did not entertain because she knew less than he did of&#xD;
the disturbances in the neighborboo4, he set out to.&#xD;
wards Marlin's. Hi8, wife, whom he soothed 'with&#xD;
hopes which he could not feel, con~~ented to return&#xD;
to the hon~e 'and await the result oi~ his inquiries.&#xD;

He had not rode more than a mile when he&#xD;
met his daughter with Major Fitzhugh. Recog-&#xD;
nizing her at some distance he exclaimed-" my&#xD;
child! thank God t my c~iild !" He Iea~ed from his&#xD;
hor~e and ran to embrace her. He saw by the moon-&#xD;
light that she was 'extremely pale. , When she leaned&#xD;
down to kiss him,' ajid he felt the tremor of her hand,&#xD;
tears welled up in his eyes. The emotions which suc-&#xD;
ceeded his extreme - anxiety for ,her safety could find&#xD;
no other&#xD;
Where have you 'been all' thi~ night, my daugh-&#xD;
terf" he asked as soon as he could command his&#xD;
voice.&#xD;
"I will tell you all, papa, when wO get home. I&#xD;
am fatigueA but unhurt."&#xD;
seem to' be very feeble, daughter. Can you&#xD;
ride home ?"&#xD;
"Yes, papa, 'but I must ride slowly. Poor&#xD;
mamma!' I fear she' is in distress. . Captaiir 'Fitz-&#xD;
hugh, ~vil1 you have' the kindness' to ride on and&#xD;
relieve her mind ~ Papa will take care of me. You.&#xD;

"-Pardon me; Hugh. You ar&amp;amp; welcome Vo the&#xD;

arrive at 'the house."~&#xD;
After a hasty return of the colonel's greeting, Fitz-&#xD;
hugh ~ode oii, while the father and daughter followed&#xD;
s'4owiy.' When' Julia arrived at home, 'she was car-&#xD;
ried to her chamber and laid upon 'her bed, com-&#xD;

in spite of hospitable entreaties, Fitzhugh left floe-&#xD;

&#xD;
buck as soon as she arrived. He was not willing 'to&#xD;
be longer absent from his mother. lie, too, needed&#xD;
repose. His wound, which ~t first 'was not very trou-&#xD;
blesome, had in the heat and miwholesome camp of&#xD;
Manassa, threatened serious consequences. The sur-&#xD;
geons insisted that he should go home, and when he&#xD;
found that the army was to remain iniietive, he&#xD;
yielded to their advice. Wishing to give his horses&#xD;
the benefit ot 'a Ihrlough, he traveled on horseback.&#xD;
He found himself within a f~# miles of home when&#xD;
night overtook liiiii-the night of the events 'just&#xD;
related.-~--and be pushed on. When he ul~ghted'be-&#xD;
fQre the mansion of Willowbank, he saw a light&#xD;
moving in the house, and, approaching' the door, he&#xD;
found it open. What followed is linown. For a&#xD;
week after' this night 'he could not ~mo~re' from the&#xD;
house, and it was a month before he could' return to&#xD;
the army.&#xD;
The history of Major 1?it~hugh and, Julia Fairt~ix&#xD;

proval of their families and the favor of dream-&#xD;
stances left no impediment in~ the way of *eir wishe~s.&#xD;
During the, last three weeks that Major Fitzhugh&#xD;
remained at home he was a daily visitor at Roebuck.&#xD;
Colonel Fairfax had regarded his. talents and his&#xD;
generous, frank and honorable temper with almost&#xD;
paternal interest, even when he feared' that the bright&#xD;
promise 6f his youth might be blighted by the miLdew&#xD;
of: indolenc0 or the canker of pleasure. But.. now,&#xD;
when the strength and dignity of his character were&#xD;
developed by the vocation of a patriotic soldier, and&#xD;
he displayed also the grace ~which a true man derives&#xD;
from wise love, the colonel preudJy recognized in him&#xD;
the qualities which he would' most desire in his&#xD;
daughter's husband. Mrs. Fairfax, with a mother's&#xD;
gentle pride and a woman's natural delight in a happy&#xD;
match, built castles in the air for her daughter, and&#xD;
made her own substantial home more smiling and&#xD;
radjauL than those fabrics of her fancy. Julia, lovely,&#xD;
loving and beloved, was more beautiful than ever, and&#xD;
happier than the happiest dreams of' her childhood.&#xD;
Her voice, like the melody of birds, often warbled her&#xD;
happiness in eong. Hugh Fitzhugh fondly believed&#xD;
that, until then music so melodious had never been&#xD;
heard. Perhaps it was most pleasant to his, ear when&#xD;
it would have been least agreeable to a less passionate&#xD;
listener, for ~ef all her songs his favorite was,&#xD;

CHAPTER XIX.&#xD;
&#xD;
TREMMNL&#xD;
Th the spring of the year eighteen hundred and&#xD;
sixty.~wQ, both Fitzhi~gh and Tremaine had been pro-&#xD;
moted to the rank of colonel in the cavalry of their&#xD;
respeetiv~e services. In the previous autumn Captaiu&#xD;
Fitzhugh, with. his company, was sent~to the Valley,&#xD;
and served under Jackson in guarding the junction, in&#xD;
the winter expedition to Bath and Romney, and in the&#xD;
brilliant spring campaign, beginning with Rernstown&#xD;
and ending with Port Republic, which first made the&#xD;
name of Jackson renowned.&#xD;
Probably no other campaign made by so small a*&#xD;
force in so short ~ time ever produced more Impor-&#xD;
tant elects than the rapid succession of remarkable&#xD;
victories then won by Jackson over several armies.&#xD;
The immediate influence of this hi'illiant and unex-&#xD;
pected success upon the niinds of the Southern people&#xD;
was as extraordinary as it was timely. Never atr any&#xD;
other time during the war until the anal catastrophe&#xD;
was at hand, was the South so despondent as in the&#xD;
spring of eighteen hundred and sixty-two. About&#xD;
that time the overweening confidence inspired by the&#xD;
Confederate successes of the previous year was turned&#xD;
to dismay by several disasters. Most of the volun-&#xD;
teers who composed the army of the~ South had&#xD;
enlisted for a year only and their term of service was&#xD;
about to expire. It was apprehended that not many&#xD;
would renew their engagement, and that a new army&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
IIOEI~UCK.&#xD;
&#xD;
211&#xD;
&#xD;
could not be formed before the disbanding of the old,&#xD;
if at all. It was deemed necessary to pass the law of&#xD;
conscription, which compelled all white male residents&#xD;
between the ages 6f eighteen and thirty-five (with a&#xD;
few exemptions) to serve in the army three years or to&#xD;
furnish substitutes. It required those who k~ vol~&#xD;
unteered for a yc~r tQ remain in service 4~ears&#xD;
Ion gei~. Many feared .2that tbis~s~vere measiiUuld&#xD;
provoke resistance, but it was obeyed ~ithost&#xD;
uncomplaining patriotism. The law, however, was a&#xD;
violent and inipracticable-ineasgre, and was afterw~i~d~&#xD;
among the prominent causes of the downfall of the&#xD;
Confederacy. The general alarm ~hi~h~ led to ~its&#xD;
enactment was suddenly relieved by the achkyements&#xD;
of "Stonewall ' Jackson in the~V~lley~ if it ~ proper&#xD;
thus to ascribe to hira alone victories which were due&#xD;
to the marvellous endurance and unconquerable ~val~r&#xD;
of the little army which he led, n6t less: than to the&#xD;
genius of their leader~ It will be readily understood&#xD;
that the activity of that army, the extent of country&#xD;
which it protected, the number of its: battles, with the&#xD;
skirmishes and other incidents of such a earnpai~n,&#xD;
afforded to every man~ opportunities for the display&#xD;
of the best qu~rlitiea of a soldier. The large amount&#xD;
of ~intelligence then in the ranks, the g~neraf spirit[of&#xD;
patriotism and the individual independence nourished&#xD;
in Southern society fitted almost every man to play~an&#xD;
effective part.&#xD;
This vo1um~ cannot be ad&amp;amp;rned with a history of&#xD;
that noble army. We cannot ~sreu take space W&#xD;
cord the particular exploits of' our fr~end~. It must&#xD;
suffice to ine~t~on~briefly that hugh Fitzhugh became&#xD;
a lieutenant-colonel during the winter, that' when the&#xD;
whole army was reorganized in the spring, under the&#xD;

law of conscription,, he was elected colonel, and thai&#xD;
lie was acknowledged to have fairly won his promo.&#xD;
tious by his gallar4 and skilful conduct. At the new&#xD;
election Mark Marlin was chosen a lieutenant, with&#xD;
the unanimous approbation o~' the young. gentlemen&#xD;
and other members of his company. With his corn-&#xD;
mission he acquired the ~oeial rai~k of a gentleman,&#xD;
according to the theoryy o( his youthful ambition, and&#xD;
his deportment was faithCul to his model.&#xD;
About the same time such changes took place. in&#xD;
the -military liue~ that: XI~oebuck became accessible to&#xD;
the Federal troops. The county remained for a time&#xD;
debatable ground, and was visited occasionally by&#xD;
cavalry from both sides. At length, however, a&#xD;
Federal detachment was stationed -in the village,&#xD;
under the command of Colonel Tremaine. It was suf-&#xD;
ficient, with the support of a larger force at no great&#xD;
distance, to hold the county, but not to prevent occa-&#xD;
si~al and rapid, incursions of Confederate horse.&#xD;
The Federal cavalry in Virginia was still inferior, and&#xD;
poverty had not yet unhorsed the Confederates. At&#xD;
the thne of the events about to be narrated,~ Colonel&#xD;
Fit~hugh, with his regiment, was stationed some&#xD;
twenty miles from the village, and a- considerable dis-&#xD;
tance in advance of any large Southern army. The&#xD;
force under Colonel Tremaine was composed of his&#xD;
own regiment of cavalry, ~and a regiment of infantry.&#xD;
The latter - was commanded by IAeutenant-CoPrnel&#xD;
Wesel,, a -German, who was in daily expectation~ of&#xD;
being promoted to the office, of colonel of his regi-&#xD;
inent, then vacant. He had. been a butcher in a&#xD;
Northern city. He was a blatant politician of the&#xD;
jirevailing order, and had been active in drawing his&#xD;
eounti~ymen into the regimeiit. He was, therefore,&#xD;
&#xD;
U011]3 U C IC.&#xD;
&#xD;
218&#xD;
&#xD;
patronized by some influential persons. He and his&#xD;
men had been taught to look upon "rebels" as atro-&#xD;
cious criminals, out of the pale of humanity, and upon&#xD;
their property as lawful prey. Some- companies of&#xD;
the cavalry, though composed of native Americans,&#xD;

The next morning ab.ut dawn he approached a Fede-&#xD;
ral picket on the Southern side of the 'Potomac. He&#xD;
approached cautiously, and, ~s it was -thought, suspi-&#xD;
ciously, dressed in Confederate uniform, and the picket&#xD;
took alarm and retired. The panic Qf Manassa had&#xD;
not y~t stibsided~ A report soon spread as far as the&#xD;
city of Washington that a large rebel armywas 'nt the&#xD;
southern bank of the river and produced great &amp;amp;om-&#xD;
motiOn for several hours. In the meantime Palmer,&#xD;
by skilfiul mana~uvre; contrived to get within hail of&#xD;
a I~'ederal party,, and made known his friendly pur-&#xD;
pose. A deserter from the rebel army, at such a mo-&#xD;

"'I do not perceive, however, that their honesty&#xD;

present, Mr. Palmer, Mrs. Palmer and 'their ~son,&#xD;
Albert. It was~ agreed th~t, under existing cii'cum-&#xD;
stances, Gabe could' not be detained by force, and&#xD;
that it would be dangerous to' attempt to spirit, him&#xD;
away to a slave-market. It seemed almost certain&#xD;

that he would prove a t6tal loss. This ~rospect made&#xD;
them for- the moment regard the proceedings of a&#xD;
benign government as rather oppressive. At last a&#xD;
desperate expedient occurred to Mr. Palmer the elder.&#xD;
He rang the bell and summoned Gabeto the parlor.&#xD;
"Gabe," said he, with solemnity, "I am afraid you&#xD;
are thinking about running away to the Yankees."'&#xD;
"l's a thinking' I better be a gwine, master," re-&#xD;
sponded Gabe, in his well-conned formula~, without&#xD;
insolCnce of manner, but with stolid apathy.&#xD;
"Gabriel,"' resumed his master with impressive&#xD;
condescension, "you ought not to .go. You are a&#xD;
poo; ignorant nigger, and you do not know what is&#xD;
for your good. I have only your own welfare at&#xD;
heart. You have now a good home. If you run&#xD;
away you will have none. These Yankees are foQling&#xD;
you. They care nothing abo~t you. They merely&#xD;
want to injure the South by taking away its labor. I&#xD;
take care. of your family. You and they fare better&#xD;
than poor wbite folks at the North. You are going&#xD;
to leave friends and protectors for strangers. N6body&#xD;
will feel any interest in your welfare. Everybody&#xD;
will strive to take bread out of your mouth to feed&#xD;
themselves. You cannot compete with white labor~&#xD;
ers among white employers. In fact, you know you&#xD;
won't work without a master. You will let your&#xD;
children perish. You will be a beggar, an outcast, a&#xD;
vagabond. Take my word for it, if you trust these&#xD;
Yankees you will rue it as ltng as you live. Now&#xD;
will you run away, Gabriel !"&#xD;
"I's a tjiinkin' I better be a gwiue," answered Gabe,&#xD;
as before.&#xD;
"Gabriel, you will commit a grievous sin. You&#xD;
would not go against the Bible, would you! I will&#xD;
&#xD;
expound your duty to you out of the Holy Script~ires."&#xD;
Taking up the Book and drawing Ida spectacles&#xD;
down upon his nose, Mr Palmer proceeded. 'to 'read&#xD;
and expound some- selected passages, while Gabe&#xD;
stood before-him, twisting a button and perusing the&#xD;
carpet.&#xD;
"Hear niw," he continued, "~what is commanded&#xD;
in the twenty-fifth chapter of Leviticus-' Both thy&#xD;
bondmen and thy bondmaids '-that means our slaves,~&#xD;
Gabi'iel-' which thou shalt have, shall be of the&#xD;
heathen that are round about you; of them shall ye&#xD;
buy boudin~n and bondmajds. Moreover of the chil-&#xD;
dren of the strangers that do sojourn among you, of&#xD;
them shall ye buy and of their families tl~at are with&#xD;
you which they begat in your land:, and they shall be&#xD;
* your possession. And jre shall take them as an in-&#xD;
heritance for your children after you, to inherit them&#xD;
for a possessi4)x; they shall be your bot~dmen forever.'&#xD;
Now, Gabriel, your forefathers were heathen, you&#xD;
know, and so the white people were commanded to&#xD;
buy them for slaves, and to hold them and their chib&#xD;
dren. as a possession forever. My forefathers in ~ew&#xD;
England bought many of them, a~hd made great gains&#xD;
by theni, which proved that their trade was blessed.&#xD;
When slavery became, unprofitable in ~ England,&#xD;
whereby ~ appeared that' the institution was no&#xD;
longer blessed there, they sold their- slaves to the&#xD;
Southern people, with advantage to all parties-. So&#xD;
my 'ancestors again had golden experience that godlb&#xD;
ness is great gain, and. they have continued 4o be a&#xD;
godly and a' gainful people to this very day. The&#xD;
passage I have read requires the slaves to' be an in-~&#xD;
heritance for the children of the' masters. I did not&#xD;
receive you by inheritance, but ~{ew England men&#xD;

can,, by the Divineblessing, obtain the inheritance of&#xD;
the children of Virginia as Jacob got the birthright&#xD;
* of Esau by substituting kid for venison. Thus it is&#xD;
proved out of Scripture, Gabe, that you must stay&#xD;
* with me. What confirms this interpretation i~ that&#xD;
the institution of slavery ~in. the South has been&#xD;
blessed with wonderful usefulness to mankind.. While&#xD;
the slaves multiply and thrive, they have added more&#xD;
to the wealth, comfort and civilization of the world,&#xD;
by tillage, than any other equal number of laborers&#xD;
ever did in the same length of time. You know they&#xD;
never would' have done all this work if they had been&#xD;
free, and you know that white men could not have&#xD;
done it. So it. is the will of God, Gabriel, that you&#xD;
shall not run away to the Yankees.&#xD;

"I's a thinking' I better be a gwin.e."&#xD;
"Now, my good and faithful servant, 'let me read&#xD;

"l's a thinking' I better be a gwine."&#xD;
"Poor Gabriel, I fear your understanding is dark&#xD;
and. your heart hardened. ferh4ps we may obtain&#xD;
light to direct youi' steps, or to step them, by prayer.&#xD;
Let us pray."&#xD;
&#xD;
229&#xD;
&#xD;
He knelt down, a~ did also. his wife and son. Gabe,&#xD;
who1. had been taught, not ,to pray; but to stand, in&#xD;
the presence of his betters, and who did not under-&#xD;
stand that he had been ordered to kneel, remained in&#xD;
hi$ erect posture. He twisted his button and perused&#xD;
the carpet, shifting his weight from one foot to the&#xD;
other, while his~ lips moved,, not in prayer, but in&#xD;
repetition of his fugitive formula. His master prayed&#xD;
very earnestly, in a manner which he thought must&#xD;
impress the mind and melt the heart of his se~wint.&#xD;
Then he paused, and casting his eyes on Gabe, dis-&#xD;
covered that he was still standing.&#xD;
"How is your mind now, Gabriel ?"' he inquired.&#xD;
"ra a thinking' I better be a gwine."&#xD;
"Kneel down, Gabriel."&#xD;
Gabe obeyed. lie crossed his arms over the bot-&#xD;
tom of a chair and laid his forehead upon thern~ The&#xD;
prayer was resut~ied with increasing fervor. It be-&#xD;
came so eloquent~ unctuous and ituportunate that&#xD;
Mrs. Palmer was moved to sigh, and then to groan,&#xD;
and finally .to respond audibly Amen and Am~n.&#xD;
Again pausing, Mr. Palmer turned to his . bon4man,&#xD;
bought with his money, and said-" how do you feel&#xD;
now, Gabriel ~"&#xD;
a thinking' I better be a gwine," muttered Gabe.&#xD;
"Good God t' exclaimed his master, bouncing to&#xD;
his feet, "have we a government that will ~Qt protect&#xD;
our property?"&#xD;
Mrs. Palmer and Albert dlso rose, but Gabe re-&#xD;
mained kneeling, with his face upon his arms, and'&#xD;
lijs arms upon the chair. His misb~ess, gazing at him&#xD;
a moment with rifling scorn, ihen.. strode with rectan-&#xD;

But Gab&amp;amp; did not rise He was fast asleep. As&#xD;
soon as his head rested on a chair slumber began to&#xD;
creep over him: When his master addressed him he&#xD;
was partially aroused, and muttered his well-conned&#xD;
response between asleep and awake. Under the&#xD;
monotonous declamation of Mrs. Palmer he lost, all&#xD;
consciousness. After the close of her address his only&#xD;
reply 'i~*as a sonorous snore. Albert, discovering the&#xD;
truth of the ~case,~ and being. huruself cool enough to&#xD;
feel the ridicule of the situation, quietly approached&#xD;
Gabe, and laying a hand on itis shoulder, woke him.&#xD;
Gabe leaped up and looked about him with amazement.&#xD;
"Begone !" said his old master.&#xD;
"I's ~ thinking' I better~ be a gwine."&#xD;
Gabe hustled out of the parlor with less servile cer-&#xD;
emony than he had been accustomed to display in&#xD;
retiring from the presence.&#xD;
The family council, resuming its s~ssion,. disc4lssed&#xD;
various topics, and among them the Fairfaxes of Roe-&#xD;

of' interest to the reader, they will appear in the&#xD;
Bequel. While the name of Fairfax was yet upon&#xD;
their lips the signal of blind Pete was heard, and he&#xD;
was admitted. He came to report that Colonel Fitz.&#xD;
hugh was spending the night at UQebuck. Albert&#xD;
Palmer, eager to avail himself of the information,&#xD;
mounted his horse, and after giving an order to Pete,&#xD;
rode to the village~&#xD;
Pete's clandestine information was so far correct&#xD;
that Hugh Fitzhugli visited Roebuck that night, but&#xD;
left there before Albert Palmer could hav~e ai'rived at&#xD;
the village. Going with his regiment upon an expe-&#xD;
* edition, he passed near Roebuck in the night. While&#xD;
the regiment halted foi~ a brief rest he rode off with a&#xD;
small, escort to visit Colonel Fairfax, and ascertain&#xD;
from him whether the ~-umors were true which&#xD;
he had heard of the outrages committed upon the&#xD;
people of the county. After conversing with the&#xD;
colonel upon that subject, he indulged himself with a&#xD;
brief delay, te talk with Juliaupon&amp;amp; subject of more&#xD;
tender interest to them than to the public. Then,&#xD;
while he lingered yet a little longer, conversation&#xD;
turned upon the desolation of Virginia a!ad the suffer..&#xD;
ing of her people. A large portion of the State was&#xD;
ah'ea~iy ravaged and devastated. The flower of her&#xD;
youth and manhood had been cut down by thousands.&#xD;
From the first to the last hour of the war the blood of&#xD;
the State flowed in torrents, and in all her borders it&#xD;
seemed that nothing eould~stand erect under the in-&#xD;
cessant storm of wLir but her unconquerable spirit.&#xD;
Those who then fondly protracted a hurried conversa-&#xD;
tion, to deplore the afflictions of their beloved Com-&#xD;
monwealth, e~uld not foresee that they would never&#xD;
meet again under the1ro(f of Roebuck. They knew~&#xD;

voice in song. Sing one song for me before I leave&#xD;
you." At such a monent her voice could not be&#xD;

AMoNG the Federal officers at the village ~as Cap-.~&#xD;
tam Pakin, who led a oompaty of marauding cavalry.&#xD;
He was active, daring, cruel and treacherous. He&#xD;
was a favorite instrument of Colonel 'Wesel in ex~&#xD;
ecuting all plans of bold. adventure or ruthless re~&#xD;
venge. By virtue of a round, red Lace, ~a jolly laugh,&#xD;
and a fondness for the bottle, he was called a good&#xD;
fellow. The~ licence which he allowed to his men&#xD;
made him popular among them. He had been a&#xD;
preacher. After wearing out religion as a theme of&#xD;
popular eloquence, he took to preaching politics from&#xD;
the pulpit. The political agitation of the day was the&#xD;
controversy between the North and ~South, and that,&#xD;
curiously enough, turned mainly upon Southern&#xD;
slavery, which excited no dissension where it existed,&#xD;
but offended the North, where it was ubkuown. The&#xD;
pretext for introducing it into the sacred desk, and&#xD;
beating the "drum ecclesiastic" for recruits in the&#xD;
political warfare of the North against the South, was&#xD;
that slavery was a sin. Erom the exclusive attention&#xD;
given to it, the reverend gentleman's hearers might&#xD;
have concluded that it .was the only sin extant, and,&#xD;
consequently, that those who were free from it were&#xD;
saints. It was so atrociouS a erhue, that the preacher&#xD;
in denouncing slave-holders, ~1auced ii~ the pulpit with&#xD;
sacredd fury. The sentiments which foamed from his&#xD;

lips were unearthly. A mortal who has not, been in&#xD;
Ileav'en, dares not affirm with confidence that they&#xD;
were Heavenly. But it may be presumed that there&#xD;
~is a world above or below us in which they might&#xD;
take their origin. A~ all his hearers were free from&#xD;
the guilt which he denounced, his denunciations may&#xD;
appear to have been superfluous; but they had the*&#xD;
happy effect of cultivating in the hearts of his congre-&#xD;
gation a comfortable sense of their own perfection in&#xD;
comparison with those-distant sinners, together with&#xD;
a holy. hatred. of those reprobates. Besides, they&#xD;
swelled a certain volume of votes. Ambitious to ex-&#xD;
tend the sphere of hi~ usefulness, or preferring the&#xD;
applause of a multitude to the still decorum of a&#xD;
church, this clergyman turned atreet-.preaeher. From&#xD;
porticos of public buildings, or from bbard-piles in&#xD;
vacant lots, he harangued- the mob on Sunday after-&#xD;
noons as they were harangue&amp;amp; by the other dema-&#xD;
gogues from similar platforms on week days. At&#xD;
last, 'weary of teaching 'others to disdain the com-&#xD;
mandment against coveting a neighbor's servants, he&#xD;
abandoned the pulpit, and regaled himself with a&#xD;
breaeh'~f the commaudmeAt against coveting a neigh-&#xD;
bor's wife. A -member of his congregation had a&#xD;
very pretty wife. Her beauty was to blame in the&#xD;
affair. Besides, a~sweet sin that nestles in our own&#xD;
bosoms looks less ugly than another man's sin afar off.&#xD;
 One may be embraced, while the other, is anathema.&#xD;
'~Then the war broke out, however, he left the arms&#xD;
of his charmer, to take up arms 'for his country.&#xD;
Albert Palmer, arriving at the village, hastened to&#xD;
communicate to Oolonel Wesel the information which&#xD;
he had received from blind Pete. The colonel em-&#xD;
braced" with alacrity an opportunity to capture the&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
Confederate officer. Fitzhugh'~ oavah'y had been en-&#xD;
terprising and troublesome~ They had c~ut off several&#xD;
parties ~of Wesel's men, besides hara~sii1g him with&#xD;
alarms in his camp. Aided and stimulated by the&#xD;
people, ~who were exasperated by oppression, they had&#xD;
made it necessary of late for the Federals to restrictt&#xD;
the range of their operations within narrow limits~&#xD;
The capture of the Confederate colonel, therefore, was&#xD;
very lesirable. It would gratify, also, for Albert&#xD;
ralmei a private pique; and, perhaps, open the way&#xD;
for the renewal of a matrimonial project, which, for&#xD;
certain reasons, he desired to revive. Love had failed,&#xD;
but arms might prevail. The possession of the heiress&#xD;
of Roebuck would be convenient in any event of&#xD;
the ~var,. and he still distrusted the success of the&#xD;
Federal.&#xD;
Caplin Dakin was aroused from slumber, and in-&#xD;
trusted with the duty of capturing Colonel Fitzhugh,&#xD;
and he was directed also to arrest Colonel Fairfax,&#xD;
and carry him before the tribunal of the Federal com-&#xD;
mander, upon a charge of harboring the rebel o~cer.&#xD;
lie was )t~ take with him but a small party,- because&#xD;
success might depend on secrecy as well as pi'ompti-&#xD;
tude of action. The ready captain soon had his men&#xD;
in the saddle. In moving about, he stumbled over&#xD;
Juba, who was asleep on the porch of the Swan&#xD;
tavern. As it was no longer necessary for- him' to&#xD;
take to the bush for the enjoyment of. leisure, he~&#xD;
lounged about the village, day and night, waiting for&#xD;
his slice of land. It occurred to ihe captain that this*&#xD;
fellow might be useful as a guide about the grounds&#xD;
of Roebuck, and waking hini with a kick, he ~orde~d&#xD;
him to mount a ~hor~e;' and companyy the party.&#xD;
Albert Palmer also went along~ When they were&#xD;

within a mile of the mansion of Roebuck, Captain&#xD;
])akin informed Juba of his destination and. design,&#xD;
requiring the involuntary guide to lead a squad to the&#xD;
rear of the house, and to point out every path,. gate&#xD;
and outlet by which Fitzhugh might escape. To&#xD;
quicken his intelligence, he was tcdd that, if the rebel&#xD;
officer wa~ not captured, he should Jx~ hung.&#xD;
Arriving near the mansion, (~aptaiz~ t)akin quietly&#xD;
posted his men. so as to shut up every loop-hole of&#xD;
retreat, and then rode up to the front of the hous~e.&#xD;
Awaking the "inmates' bybeating on a door, he called&#xD;
for Colonel Fairfax~- That geutfezuan soon appeared&#xD;
at an upper window, and inp4red who was there.&#xD;
"captain Dakin desires to see Colonel Fitzhugh."&#xD;
"He is not here,"&#xD;
"I kiiow better. I have direct information. You.&#xD;
can't deceive me."&#xD;
"There is no attempt to deceive you, I assure you&#xD;
he is not in, the house."&#xD;
"You want to parley while he escapes. U under-.&#xD;
stand your game. It won't do. Your house is sur-&#xD;

"Captain Dakin, upon my honor he is not here."&#xD;
"You lie, you - gild rebel. Send Fitzhugh to&#xD;
me, or I will set fire to your house in five minutes.&#xD;
It ought to havie been burnt long ago."&#xD;
"It i~ impossible for me to send a man who is not&#xD;

"Then the house shall burn."&#xD;
Surely,~ you are not in. earnest ~&#xD;

Colonel Fairfax should remain in the hous~, and be&#xD;
burnt with it, unless he delivered u~ Colonel Fitz~&#xD;

heard' by Julia, wbo stood at a Window of her chain-.&#xD;
bet listening to the dialogue. Mrs~ Fairfax stood&#xD;
near her husband. lie requested her to go to J~ulia's&#xD;
room, and directed that they should both pi~epare to&#xD;

he kept concealed, because' the inhabitants were gene-&#xD;

I will certainlyy shoot the' man who applies the torch,"&#xD;
The captain ordered the men to ftre the 'house. One&#xD;
of them, coining to the front, applied the' fire, and&#xD;
stooped down to kindle it. Colonel Fairfax dis-&#xD;
charged a load of buckshot from one barrel of the&#xD;
gun, and 'one or two shots' entered' the soldier's leg.&#xD;
He ran' away, making a great outcry of pain. 'The&#xD;

that they would go down stairs, where he would ~re-&#xD;

found them dressed; hut Mrs. Fairfax, overcome with&#xD;
alarm, had sun1~upou the floor, and Julia kn&amp;amp;lt beside&#xD;

left her mother with him~and going-to her father, in-&#xD;

engagethe attention of the soldiers. He directed her&#xD;
to return, and, with the assistance of the servant,&#xD;
carry her mother down stairs, saying that he would&#xD;
detain the soldiers at the front, until the ladies were&#xD;
ready to pass out from a back door, which he desig..&#xD;

directions, they descended to the door. While this&#xD;
was taking place within, Captain Dakin found means&#xD;
to fire the house, and very- s6en the flames began to&#xD;
ascend on every side. The colonel, without further&#xD;
delay, followed the ladies; and found them waiting for&#xD;
him at the door.&#xD;
Taking his wife, almost inanimate, in his arms, he&#xD;
went out, followed, by Julia and the servant. They&#xD;
walked rapidly away from the honse, and for a short&#xD;
distance were concealed ~by shrubbery. But they&#xD;
were soon discovered and were pursued with cries of&#xD;
"here they go-~-slioot them-Adll the - secesh."&#xD;
Several pist~l~~ -were five~I at them. - A ball took effect&#xD;
in the colonel's thigh and he fell to the ground. His&#xD;
wife became quite insensible. Julia. stood a moment&#xD;
bewildered4 She saw some of the soldiers seize her&#xD;
father and other~ her mother, dragging them away.&#xD;

She felt the grasp of two men who drew her along, and&#xD;
before she could recover from the stupefactinn of ter-&#xD;

held. her fh'mly and~ dashed o$i~' at a rapid pace, which&#xD;

waist, said.--"be Inot ~al~r~ed, Miss Fairfaz; you are&#xD;
safe ; -1 will carry you away from those ruffians." She&#xD;
recognized the voice of Albert Palmer..&#xD;
"My father," she cried, "my mother-I mu~t not&#xD;
leave them. 0, Captain Palmer, release ~ne."&#xD;
- "That would be madness, ~Miss FairfAi You&#xD;
would rim into danger and could do no good. I will&#xD;
take you to a place of safety and then look after&#xD;
them."&#xD;
* "I must go back. Release me, sir."~ -&#xD;
* "No, my sweet bird, that is impossible."&#xD;
He struck his spurs intohis horse, and in spite of&#xD;
her entreaties; remonstr~ances and struggles, he bore&#xD;
her away through the darkness.&#xD;
- While the fire Was raging, Captain Dakin-was mow.&#xD;
ing about in. great excitement, cursing and ~iviuig&#xD;
orders to secure the rebels and keep strict watch for&#xD;
Fitzhugh. He was expected every moment to issue&#xD;
from'vhehurning building. When the house was ~o&#xD;
far consumed that Captain Dakin *a~ aure the rebel&#xD;
officer could not be in it, he called for the negro who&#xD;
had acted as guide, - sweating that he had played false.&#xD;
Poor Juba was found and brought before him.&#xD;
"Jziano - him," was~ the peremptory otder In vain&#xD;
the negro protested his innocence and implored mercy.&#xD;

He was carried from it by some of the negroes; dread-&#xD;

believed that Joe perished in the burning mansion.&#xD;
He rat~ towards it when he saw it in flames, and hear-&#xD;
* ing that his master was inside, he rushed in to rescue&#xD;
him. He was seen running to and fro in the upper&#xD;
part of the house when the fire was licking the high..&#xD;

Mrs. Fairfax, after being dragged a short distance&#xD;
by the soldiers, was left by them lying upon the&#xD;
mound, her &amp;amp;ge' and sex, perhaps, obtaining for her&#xD;
the compassion of neglect. Some of her servants ear-&#xD;
ned her to anegro cabin, where the faithful creatures&#xD;
ministered to her with assiduous care until morning,&#xD;
when she wfis conveyed t&amp;amp; the house of a friend in the&#xD;
neigh 'hood. Colonel Fairfax, after being drawn&#xD;
along ~he earth in great agony from the spot where&#xD;
he ~va~ wounded to a pl~aee more remote from the&#xD;
flames, was guarded as if he had been able to fight or&#xD;
ily. He lay in pain and in view ~f his burning home;&#xD;
but more intolerable than his* w~und was his anxiety&#xD;
for the safety of hi~ wife and daughter. He was kept&#xD;
in ignoranee of their fate, and when the rising sun&#xD;
s~ione upon the smoking ruins of his mansion, he was&#xD;
thrown into a cart and ~carried to the village. He was&#xD;
there placed in~a house which was used as a hospital.&#xD;
,The surgeon in charge treated him vith professional&#xD;
skill and with extreme kindness. He left nothing&#xD;
undone that was within his pe~1~r for the relief and&#xD;
comfort of the wounded and bereaved gentleman.&#xD;
During the day a considerable number of Federal&#xD;
officers called upon him to express their sympathy&#xD;
and respect.. Of these~ some had e~ijoyed his ho~pi-&#xD;

To others he was a stranger, but they knew his char-&#xD;

which becomes the profession of arms&#xD;
When Colonel Wesel heard his subordinate's re-&#xD;
port of t~he proceedings or operations of the night, he&#xD;
'commended the captain's conduct, and was enraged at&#xD;
the audacious attack made by Colonel Fairfax on the&#xD;
Federal troops. He looked upon it as the cap-sheaf~&#xD;
of crime in the county. He denounced Colonel Fair-&#xD;
fax not only as a "secesh," a rebel and an aristocrat,&#xD;
but as a "bushwhacker ".-.-an epithet commonly&#xD;
applied to those persons, who, not being in the mu..&#xD;
tary service, waylaid enemies and shot them from&#xD;
bushes, trees, rock~, houses or other places of conceal..&#xD;
ment. The insolent offences of the secesh citizens,. he&#xD;
declared, had been increasing of late. Women had&#xD;
worn Confederate colors in their garments and had&#xD;
declined the acquaintance of Federals. Men had re&#xD;
fused to remain at home and till the ground Negroes&#xD;
'   had been chastised. Rebel soldiers had been 'harbored&#xD;
by their families and others. Loyal citizens had been&#xD;
insulted. The venerable clergyman of the village had&#xD;
refused to pray fbr the President of the-United States&#xD;
These, and other enormities, were recited in an order&#xD;
issued by Colonel Wesel, and it was added that law-.&#xD;
less barbarity had at last culminated in an attempt&#xD;
made by a bad old man to assassinate a Federal officer&#xD;
and several men, at midnight, by clandestinely shooting&#xD;
at them from the concealment of darkness and of a&#xD;
private dwelling. The colonel announced his deter-&#xD;
mination to suppress all these diabolical practices, and&#xD;
especially that of bushwhacking.. He threatened&#xD;
that other dweffings shouldbe destroyed, and that, if&#xD;

He proceeded to make nn exanirde of the church&#xD;

to the uses of a stable for the cavalry. He caused&#xD;
the Reverend Mr. Ambler to be arrested and brought&#xD;

condemned the meek and venerable minister to work&#xD;

iied into execution, and, beside a negro, the village&#xD;

CHAPTER XXIL&#xD;
VENG~ANC1~.&#xD;
Th the afternoon of the ~ame day, Captain Dakin&#xD;
was. sent out upQu an~ errand of devastation. At&#xD;
Roebuck he burned barns, fences, stacks and e\rery~.&#xD;
thing else that was valuable and combustible, except&#xD;
a few cabins inhabited by negroes-a 1~aithfiil remnant&#xD;
of the blithe black population that once enjoyed the&#xD;
wealth of that estate. .iIe then led his' troopers to&#xD;
Willowbank, and proceeded to execute vengeance&#xD;
upon Hugh Fitzhugh and his mother, by destroying&#xD;
their ancient mansion.' He sent one of the servants&#xD;
to notify his mistress that he was about to burn the&#xD;
house, and that she would be allowed ten .minutes to&#xD;
remove her indispensable clothing. She was confined&#xD;
to bed by sickness. She sent her faithful servant,&#xD;
Belle, to inform the Federal officer of her condition,&#xD;
and to request him not to disturb~her at that time.&#xD;
He replied~ that he was up. to the tricks of the "she-&#xD;
rebels ;" that her illness was feigned, to save her.&#xD;
house, but that it should not avail. He ordered&#xD;
Belle to tell the old woman up stairs that the house.&#xD;
would be fired in precisely ten minutes by the watch.&#xD;
When the lady was informed of this savage threat,&#xD;
and. was convince by Belle's representations that the&#xD;
- . captain intended to ~xecute it, her eyes flashed and&#xD;
her bosom swelled with indignant ~Iefiance. The&#xD;
energy of her spirit overcame the languor of disease.&#xD;
"Go," said she to Belle, "tell the brutal wretch that&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
I will remain here. Let him burn the house and me&#xD;
too." Belle descended again and informed~ the cap~&#xD;
tam that her mistress could not be removed without&#xD;
risk of her life, and would .no% consent to leave the&#xD;
house. She implored him not to burn the house with&#xD;
her mistress in it. He repeated his former threat,&#xD;
with many oaths. When the servant returned to the&#xD;
chamber she found that Mrs. 'Fit~hugh had composed&#xD;
herself in bed with rigid resolution, and was evi-&#xD;
dently preparing her mind for the death which she&#xD;
expected. She said to her servani.-" Stay here until&#xD;
they fire the house; then save yourself. I hope this&#xD;
sacrifice will arouse the indignation of men and the&#xD;
justice of Heaven to arrest the atrocious system of&#xD;
warfare that is desolating my country.' Tell my dear&#xD;
Hugh that I die blessing him. God save Virginia.&#xD;
Now farewell, my good girl. I must prepare for&#xD;
death."&#xD;
Belle uttered loud lamentations, and, on her knees,&#xD;
entreated her mistress to leave thehouse. She even&#xD;
attempted to carry her away forcibly, but the authority&#xD;
and resistance of the energetic old lady prevented her.&#xD;
When the fire began to rise she ran to and fro wildly,&#xD;
and then, after a final effort to remove Mrs. Fitzhugh&#xD;
with affectionate violence, she fled from the flames.&#xD;
When Captain Dakin saw her run out, leaving her&#xD;
mistress in the burning building, he began t@ think&#xD;
that the old lady really could iiot be removed by her&#xD;
servant, and that she would be consumed by the fire.&#xD;
Shocked at that probable event, he ordered some of&#xD;
his men to enter the house and carry her out. They'&#xD;
rushed into her chamber,, caught her up, without re-&#xD;
garding her remonstrances, and bore her into the&#xD;
yard only a moment before it would have been too&#xD;
&#xD;
late to descend the stairs. They laid her on the&#xD;
grass, and there she witnessed the final destruction of&#xD;
her house. When the flames had sunk into. sfltoulder-&#xD;
ing ashes she inquired for the officer' in~ command.&#xD;
Captain Dakin presented himself to her.&#xD;
"Captain," she said, l&amp;amp;ol~ing iat him sternly, "you&#xD;
haye destroyed my home, thrusting me from it when&#xD;
I am too feeble to rise; but my misfortunes are as&#xD;
nothing ~in flhe general calamity. I bear them pa-&#xD;
tiently, as sacrifices for my country. It is not of them&#xD;
I wish to speak to you. But I have heard of the&#xD;
outrages you have perpetratedupon others-upon rich&#xD;
and poor~-~upon men, women and children. Now,&#xD;
while you look on the last embei~s~you have made,&#xD;
your latest victim, a feeble old Woman, Warns yoiito&#xD;
desist from your ferocious warfare on the innocent&#xD;
and defenceless. As sure as there is a God who&#xD;
pities the' wid~w and the fatherless, you and your&#xD;
people will rue these crimes. Divine justice will not&#xD;
'always sleep "-.---&#xD;
"Divine justice !" interrupted the reverend cap:&#xD;
tam, with an oath and a satirical Laugh, "that's&#xD;
played out 'long since at the North. No more of that&#xD;
sort of talk, old woman."*&#xD;
"~IIave you dethroned God ?"&#xD;
"Take this woman away," he said t9 some of her&#xD;
servants who had assembled around her. They car-&#xD;
ried her away tenderly. 'Some of them had lately&#xD;
been corrupted by' evil as~oeiation, but the sight of&#xD;
their old mistress in distress moved their passionate&#xD;
hearts to eager demonstrations of affection. She&#xD;
thanked them, and when she was refreshed with rest&#xD;
'she called some of her women around her and thus&#xD;
addressed them;&#xD;

"I thank you, my poor girls, for your service. I&#xD;
am grateful to all my servants. I do not reproach&#xD;
those who have left me. I pity you all. You do not&#xD;
foresee the evils that are coming upon your race. I&#xD;
cart no longer protect you. Our house, that gave you&#xD;
and me shelter, is destroyed. Our family is broken&#xD;
up. We shall be no more toFgether. But I shall&#xD;
uever forget the love and fidelity of my servants diir-&#xD;

~hereafter, and let me tell you, once for all, that if you&#xD;
would be happy you must be humble, industrious and&#xD;
good. Bless you, my girls; may you be happy !"&#xD;
After Captain Dakin had fulfilled his mission of&#xD;
destruction at Willowbank, he led his troopers away&#xD;
to other work of a similar kind: Passing near the&#xD;
cabin of Marlin, the preaching cooper, he remembered&#xD;
a report that Eliza Marlin had committed the offence&#xD;
of carrying medicines to the rebels. He could not&#xD;
~. recollect the particulars of the accusation, but it arose&#xD;
out of the 'circumstance~ that, when her father had an&#xD;
attack of fever, she visited him in camp, and carried&#xD;
some drugs~ for the use of him and others. Halting&#xD;
before the. cabin, he called Eliza and charged her with&#xD;
the offenTee. She admitted it, stating all the circum-&#xD;
stances. He declared that she should be punished on&#xD;
the spot. By his command some of the, men seized&#xD;
her, and tying her thumbs with cords, drew them up&#xD;
until her 'arms were stretched above her head and&#xD;
she stood upon her toes, and then they attached the&#xD;
cords to a joist. Others tied her mother to a chain,&#xD;
so that she could not release her daughter. Thus the&#xD;
two women were left. Eliza had struggled while&#xD;
they were binding her, until she found resistance use-&#xD;
&#xD;
less, and then, disdaining to beg for mercy, she sub-&#xD;
mitted in silence. When her face reddened and her&#xD;
eyes flashed with indignation, she seemed beautiful to&#xD;
the rude and pitiless troopers. Her defenceless situ..&#xD;
ation and the degradation to which she had been sub-&#xD;
jected by their captain encouraged them to entertain&#xD;
a licentious and outrageous design. tigainst her. On&#xD;
the mardi, when it had become dark, four oi~ .five of&#xD;
them separated themselves from the command and&#xD;
returned to the cabin. ~Releasing Eliza, they began&#xD;
to insult her whh the rough familiarity of affected&#xD;
fondness, ~rnd then ensued a scene of violence which&#xD;
cannot be described.&#xD;
When the men were departing they released Mrs.&#xD;
Marlin, and with mock compassion bade hertake good&#xD;
care of her pretty daughter. That wretched girl was'&#xD;
left nearly dead, and praying for death as a refuge&#xD;
from shame. Her mother's brain reeled, and she was&#xD;
almost incapable of rendering any assistance to tile&#xD;
form that writhed upon the floor. "0, mother,&#xD;
mother," was the despairing cry of the girl in he~&#xD;
deadly anguish. "0, God, 0, God !". was the ory of&#xD;
the mother. Throwing herself beside her daughter,&#xD;
and embracing h~r with frenzied passion, she sobbed&#xD;
and wept until the motionless stillness of the girl&#xD;
startled her with a new fear.. "0 God, my daughter&#xD;
is dead!" she exclaimed. The dim light of a poor&#xD;
candle could scarcely reveal her low breathing, her&#xD;
eyes were half-closed, and she appeared to her dis-&#xD;
tracted mother the image of death. Still clinging to&#xD;
hope, Mrs. Marlin hastened to apply the simple restor-&#xD;
atives at hand, and gradually recalled so much anima-&#xD;
tion that her daughter could faintly converses In that&#xD;
condition she lingered some h9llrs of the iii~ht.&#xD;

&#xD;
Having laid her on a bed, her mother sat besfde her.&#xD;
With her strong will she drove back the madness&#xD;
which. she felt to be creeping over her brain, in order&#xD;
that she might ward off death, which, ~he feared, was&#xD;
stealing into the heart of her daughter. Alone,&#xD;
through the dark and dreary watche&amp;amp;'~of a terrible&#xD;
night, she sustained that awful conflict. The dying&#xD;
girl sometimes, in delirium, uttered words that cleft&#xD;
the soul of the lonely watcher at her bedside. Some~.&#xD;
times, in rational moments, she whispered such despair,&#xD;
such pity for her mother, such affection for her absent&#xD;
father and brother, that the miserable mother wavered&#xD;
between madness and death. Atiength Eliza started&#xD;
up, and staring with all the dreadful feelings of that.&#xD;
iiight concentrated in her eyes, she cried, "~ is over,"&#xD;
and fell back up6n her pillow. Then a more placid&#xD;
expression settled upon her~face, and she died.&#xD;
The mother at first refused to believe that all was&#xD;
over. She fancied that a light breath still came from&#xD;
those lifeless lips. She laid her hand over the pulse..&#xD;
less heart and stood fondly waiting to feel the motion&#xD;
Qf life. While thus she stood a change came over her&#xD;
own features. Still feeling in vain for the pulsation&#xD;
of her daughter's heart~ her pallid features became&#xD;
rigid and then relaxed to an unmeaning simper. "I&#xD;
can't find it-.-.I can't find it "-she repeated, moving&#xD;
herhands about over the body of her child. Presently&#xD;
abe walked to.the door'-.then out upon the road, and&#xD;
she stood there a f~w minutes in silence. Suddenly&#xD;
she burst into, a loud laugh, and cried-." I know&#xD;
where it is. Abraham's got it. I'll go for Abraham."&#xD;
She walked rapidly away through the darkness. By&#xD;
chance, or from some recollection that her husband had&#xD;
passed that way the night before, she followed his&#xD;
&#xD;
regiment. She kept on its track during the remain-&#xD;
der of the night, in the morning and throughout the&#xD;
day. On she went, without food or drink or rest.&#xD;
Now and then she stopped and looked bewildered, as&#xD;
if she had forgotten her ewand. Then ~he would&#xD;
start, saying, "I'll go fort Ab~haham~-.he~s get it."&#xD;
Thus onward she strode, drawn ~by the insane fanny&#xD;
that hei husband could restore that mysterious spring&#xD;
of life, which had ceased t&amp;amp;vibrate in the bosom of her&#xD;
daughter, though she had lost all rational re~olleetio~i&#xD;
of that which she had lost and for which she searched.&#xD;
" Abraham's got it.-rll go for Abraham ;" this frag.&#xD;
ment of thought survived the wreck of her intellect,&#xD;
and was drifting her towards her husband.&#xD;
At evening she came upon the regiment where it&#xD;
had halted. Moving about among the men, she took&#xD;
no notice of any one until she saw her husband. Run-&#xD;
fling to him, she seized his hand and 'attempted to&#xD;
lead him along, while she said, "Come, Abraham-I&#xD;
knowed you had it. Bring it h&amp;amp;me. Eliza's waiting&#xD;
for it. She is lying on the bed. She looks so pretty."&#xD;
She laughed aloud, and then began to talk rapidly and&#xD;
incoherently, making no allusion to her daughter or&#xD;
to her husbands return home. Having fulfilled the&#xD;
purpose which had kept her wandering mind partially&#xD;
fixed during the day, she lost all control of her wild&#xD;
imagination. In vain her distressed husband endeav-&#xD;
ored to learn from her the object of her journey and&#xD;
the rational explanation of the words with which she&#xD;
had greeted him. When her son, hearing of her&#xD;
arrival, went to meet her, she fell upon his neck, ex-&#xD;
claiming, "my brave boy." Then her talk rambled&#xD;
again into unintelligible mazes. Her husband and&#xD;
~on were afflicted beyond expression. They feared,&#xD;

too, that some dreadful event must have occurred to&#xD;
shatter her intellect, and bo*th her first a11us~on to&#xD;
EIiz~, and the absence of the daughter from the&#xD;
mother in her present condition, suggested the most&#xD;
terrible apprehensions for the beloved girl.&#xD;
When Colonel Fitzhugh became acquainted with&#xD;
these circumstances he expressed the deepest sorrow&#xD;
for the afflictions of this poor family, and considered&#xD;
what might be done for their relief. Among other&#xD;
measures which he suggested ar adopted, he relieved&#xD;
both Abraham and Mark from military duty, advising&#xD;
the husband to take charge of his wife, and the son to&#xD;
go home immediately and look after the safety of his&#xD;
sister. They followed his advice, and Mark was soon&#xD;
riding rapidly. towards the cabin in which Ehiza had&#xD;
been left by her mother.&#xD;

CHAPTER XXIIL&#xD;
BAXTER&#xD;
So~ix time after nightfall, while Captain DaI~in was&#xD;
absent from the village, upon his foray against Wit.&#xD;
lowbank, and other defenceless dwellings of women&#xD;
and children, Colonel Wesel was seated in a great&#xD;
ann-chair, in a room of the Swan ~ His rotund&#xD;
figure swelled with importance, his lace was red, and&#xD;
his eyes were moist with the dew distilled by drink.&#xD;
Altogether, he 1ooi~ed mello)v, though duly formi-&#xD;
dable, as he said pompously-~-" bring in the prisoner."&#xD;
The order ~as obeyed, and a young man, followed by.&#xD;
a guard, swaggered into the room, and, without wait-&#xD;
ing for an invitation, took a seat. He looked first at&#xD;
Colonel Wesel, and then at Albert Palmer, who was&#xD;
sitting at the colonel's right hand, as a counsellor.&#xD;
He gazed at them both with an insolent stare, and&#xD;
then, leaning back in his chair, threw his feet upon a&#xD;
table. He was clad in the uniform of a private of&#xD;
Confederate cavalry. He was not known to the cob&#xD;
onel, but Palmer~ at once recognized his old antagonist,&#xD;
Baxter. That eccentric commissary resigned his&#xD;
commission at the time of his duel with Palmer, and&#xD;
returning home, he remained there in inglorious ease,&#xD;
until the next spring, when the law of conscription&#xD;
was enacted by the Confederate Congress. Being&#xD;
then obliged to.enter the service, he. be4~ame a private&#xD;
in the company formerly commanded by Hugh Fitz~.&#xD;
hugh. When the regiment passed near Roebuck,&#xD;

&#xD;
just before the burning of that mansion, Baxter took&#xD;
the liberty of withdrawing from the ranks and visit~&#xD;
ing the village, He intended to spend an hour there,&#xD;
and return to the regiment. But he fell in with a&#xD;
boon companion and good liquor. His habitual&#xD;
weakness detained him several hours, and, at last, he&#xD;
lay down to sleep himself sober. He slept until eve-~&#xD;
ning, and then, in attempting to pass out of the vil~&#xD;
lage, he was captured. When he found himself in&#xD;
the presence of Wesel and Palmer, his first thought' \&#xD;
was that the one was a fool, and the other a coward.&#xD;
lie conceived the idea of escaping from durance by&#xD;
some stratagem, and with' that view, he determined to&#xD;
protract the proceedings, which would keep him about&#xD;
the tavern, and to tiy the effect of bullying his&#xD;
judges. He gave free rein to his insolence, affecting&#xD;
to be drunk, although he was as sober as a man ought&#xD;
ever to be, according to his theory.&#xD;
"So," said Cokmel Wesel, sternly, "you be'st our&#xD;

" Colonel, you are right in objecting to the insti~&#xD;

"Vat is das, you secesh puppy~"&#xD;
"The only valid objection to our peculiar iustitu~&#xD;

slow tunes. They work to h~rmns, and dance to jigs.&#xD;
It-won't pay."&#xD;

"Veil, I viii hang you. You bees ~ spy. Now let&#xD;
us go on wid the examination. I viii hang you, but&#xD;
I viii examine you first. You shall not say, when&#xD;
you are dead, that I does not the fair thing."&#xD;
"I tluiink we might pass over the examination, since&#xD;
the sentence has been already pronounced. That would&#xD;
save time."&#xD;
"No; I viii examine you, to hang you according&#xD;
to law."&#xD;
"Then I will lie down on this bench, and take a&#xD;
nap, while you are engaged in the examination. When&#xD;
you are ready to hang me, please wake me up. I&#xD;
want to see it done."&#xD;
"You dinks I von't hang you; but I vii,&#xD;

"He will talk here all night, if you 16t him~," again&#xD;
interrupted Palmer, uneas~iIy, ~' you had better send&#xD;

Baxter, taking up the bottle, which Palmer produced&#xD;
from a closet; "now, I will tell the story.?'&#xD;
"Vou are an infamous liar," exclaimed Palmer,&#xD;
livid, with rage.   N&#xD;
"You shall be a toddy," said Baxter, as he hurled&#xD;
the bottJe at Palmer's head; "whiskey to milk-and-.&#xD;

shattered against the wall; "a dead loss," added'&#xD;
Baxter.&#xD;
Wesel stormed furiously, and threatened the pris-&#xD;
oner with a thousand deaths,*in German and English.&#xD;
Baxter sa~t quiet, until the storm had some what sub-.&#xD;

Wesel started up and ran to the door, followed by all&#xD;
the others who were in the room. He called to arms.&#xD;
He peered into the dark to ascertain the cause of the&#xD;
alarm. Captain Dakin with his troops rode up. In&#xD;
the confusion and darkness Baxter had slipped away.&#xD;
By his intimate knowledge of all places about the vil~-&#xD;
lage he~wa8 able in a few~ minutes to reach a place of&#xD;
concealment, where he remained until a late hour of&#xD;
the night favored his escape.&#xD;
After passing out of the village, and walking a mile&#xD;
or two, he heard the rattling of a cart on the road.&#xD;
Stopping behind a tree until it. came up, he found it&#xD;
was blind Pete's. That knave still continued his noc~&#xD;
turnal rambles, and ~ractised'his vilainies now with..&#xD;
out even the trouble of giving bail. Baxter hailed&#xD;
him, and taking i~ seat in the cart beside him, told him&#xD;
to drive on. Asthey rode aloud, he drew from Pete&#xD;
a variety of information about the Federal force and&#xD;
other matters, sometimes by wheedling and some~&#xD;
times by brow..beating. It was not difficult to do, for&#xD;
Pete parted readily with whatever knowledge he pos.&#xD;
sessed. He would yield it up at any time to bribes&#xD;
or threats, and often threw it away recklessly, from a&#xD;
propensity to gossip. From him Baxter derived&#xD;
some information respecting Colonel Fairfax and his&#xD;
family, which, with additions not known to the blind&#xD;
gossip, it is proper to convey to the reader.&#xD;
When Pete, on the night before,' left Mr. Palmer's,&#xD;
he went with his cart towards ~Roebnck, by order of&#xD;
Albert. That young gentlsrnan could not have anti-&#xD;
cipated the fire, but he appears to have conceived the&#xD;
capture of Fitzhugh and the arrest of Colonel Fairfax,&#xD;
and may have thought that the exeCution of such a&#xD;
plan of violence would' offer an opportunity for using&#xD;
&#xD;
Pete's cart in some such enterprise as he afterwards&#xD;
effected. On his 'way thither the carter met Palmer,&#xD;
carrying Miss Fairfax on his horse. With Pete's&#xD;
assistance he forced her into the cart and took a seat&#xD;
beside her. He then directed Pete to arive to his&#xD;
father's. The young lady frequently iinplore4 Palmer&#xD;
with pathetic entreaty to release her or to carry her&#xD;
to her parents. Sometimes, as the cart moved on, she&#xD;
tried toget upon her knees before him. She appealed&#xD;
to his rnan~ood, to his pity. Sometimes, after she&#xD;
found him. unrelenting, she gave way to helpless and&#xD;
hopeless indignation, more pitiable than her tears. He&#xD;
spoke but little. At first he affected to soothe her&#xD;
with professions of regard and promises of safety.4&#xD;
Then, becoming impatient,~ he rebuked her sternly&#xD;
and relapsed into silence. When they arrived at his&#xD;
father's house she was taken to the front door, which&#xD;
was opened by Mr. Palmer, in answer to Pete's signal,&#xD;
and then' the blind agent was dismissed.&#xD;
T!le uext morning the elder Palmer called on Col..&#xD;
onel Wesel at the village# He and his son' were con..&#xD;
fidential advisers of that officer in all affairs of th6&#xD;
county~ lie was trusted as the head of the "loyal"'&#xD;
element in the county, as he had a right to be-being&#xD;
the head of his own family. After congratulating&#xD;
Colonel Wesel upon the I vigor and success of his&#xD;
administration, especially as shown in the last night's&#xD;
operations, he proceeded to dilate upon the~ importance&#xD;
of the capture which had 'l4on made in the person of&#xD;
Colonel Fairfax. Beside~ denouncing the offences&#xD;
specially charged against ~iim, such as harboring a&#xD;
rebel officer and bushwha~king, he represented that&#xD;
the colonel was the main st~y of the secession interest&#xD;
in the county. He suggesI~ed that the removal of one&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
so influential from the State would tend to quell the&#xD;
spirit of resistance, and produce quiet and submission.&#xD;
He suspected that if such a prisoner remained at the&#xD;
village desperate efforts would be made to rescue him,&#xD;
and Colonel Wesel might be attacked by an over..&#xD;
powering force. He advised that the distinguished&#xD;
rebel should be sent to Washington, with a suitable&#xD;
representation of his offences and of his importance,&#xD;
in order that he might be detained there as a prisoner&#xD;
of State. Colonel Wesel, elated with his good for-&#xD;
tune, and apprehensive of a rescue, embraced the advice.&#xD;
~with alacrity. That very evening Colonel Fairfax&#xD;
was started to Washington. He had to make the first&#xD;
stage of the journey in an open wagon and over rough&#xD;
roads. He suffered intolerable pain. But he was&#xD;
hurried off without mercy, escorted by a strong guard.&#xD;
He requested permission to see his wife and d~inighter&#xD;
before starting, but it was refused. He was not in-&#xD;
formed of his destination, and that was kept a secret&#xD;
from others, lest a knowledge of the route to be pur-&#xD;
sued should facilitate a rescue. He' was not even&#xD;
permitted to know what had become of his wife and&#xD;
daughter.&#xD;
Mrs. Fairfax remained at the house to which she&#xD;
had been carried, as already mentioned, on the morn-&#xD;
ing after the fire at Roebuck. Mrs. Fitzhugh was&#xD;
carried to the. same place, after the destruction of her&#xD;
house. To that high-spirited lady the exertion re-&#xD;
quired by her misfortune proved an antidote to melan-&#xD;
choly. As she had suffered only in the loss of property,&#xD;
and not, like Mrs Fairfax, in. the loss of those who&#xD;
were dearest to her, she became more cheerful than&#xD;
~he had usually beezr during the war. She devoted&#xD;
herself to the consolation of her more afflicted friend.&#xD;

Mrs. Fairfax, of a gentle, tender, delicate nature,&#xD;
accustomed to be cherished by her husband and&#xD;

storms of life, pined under her calamities. The shocks&#xD;
which she endured in that dreadful night, when her&#xD;
house was burned, and her husband and ~Iaughter&#xD;
were snatched from her to be carried, she knew not&#xD;
whither, almost bereft her of existence. She had not&#xD;

CHAPTER XXIV.&#xD;
ALI3EIIT rAtMEE' S LOVE.&#xD;
Wiu~ Mr. Palmer, on the night of the fire at Roe.&#xD;
buck; had opened his door, he was informed by his&#xD;
son that Miss Fairfax was there, desiring refuge and&#xD;
repose, in c~,nsequence of the destruction of her&#xD;
father's house. "No, no," she cried, '~ I am brought&#xD;
here against my will, and I implore you to let me go&#xD;
home." But Albert Palmer thrust her in, and drew&#xD;
her to the parlor, where he placed her on a sofa. ~JIe&#xD;
then requested his father to get a light and to sum..&#xD;
mon his mother to the care of their guest.&#xD;
Wheu Mr. Palmer returned, with ~his wife and a&#xD;
light, Julia sat on the sofa, with her hands clasped on&#xD;
her lap and her head drooping. She wore nC bonnet,&#xD;
and her brown hair, dishevelled, flowed down over&#xD;
her shoulders and bosom. She was pah~ as death.&#xD;
Her lips were slightly parted. She breathed quickly.&#xD;
Her breast heaved with agitation. Her dress, hastily&#xD;
put on while she was attending ~o her alarmed mother,&#xD;
was in disorder. Her feet were bare. Even Albert&#xD;
Palmer was startled when he beheld that figure of&#xD;
beatitiKul desolation. Ills parents stood in mute won~&#xD;
der. Julia, lifting her eyes, discovered that one of'&#xD;
her own 'sex had entered the room, am] springing&#xD;
from the sofa, threw herself at the feet of Mrs. Palmer,&#xD;
clasping her knees and turning up her face, with tears&#xD;
raining from her eyes, while she appealed in broken&#xD;
accents to a woman's compassion for a woman.&#xD;
&#xD;
"0, save me," she cried; "let me go to my father&#xD;
and mother. I have been cruelly toni from them.&#xD;
Their' house is destroyed. i~ty father is wounded.&#xD;
My mother is in distress. They may be dying. I&#xD;
know not what is to become Qf them this drcadf~il&#xD;
night. Let me go to them. You have a woman's&#xD;
heart. 0, have pity ~n' a broken-hearted girl. Release&#xD;
me, 0, release me."&#xD;
"Rise, Miss Fairfax," said Albert Palmer, taking&#xD;
her by the hand; "you know not what you say. You&#xD;
are distracted with grief. Mother) there has been a&#xD;
ternil~le scene to-night. Miss Fairfax needs repose.&#xD;
We iiiust, for her own good, do some gentle violence&#xD;
to her wishes. Please conduct her to a chamber and&#xD;
persuade her to take some rest."&#xD;
"hypocrite and tyrant I" exclaimed Julia, rising to&#xD;
her feet, "you are my enemy-~-my father's foe-a&#xD;
traitor to my country. You are league with invaders&#xD;
and oppressors. To you we owe the calamities of&#xD;
this night. You hold rue a prisoner. You have torn&#xD;
me from my parents. 0, my father! 0, my poor&#xD;
mother t" Again she sunk upon the floor, dissolved&#xD;
in tears, and sobbing as if her heanli would break.&#xD;
In a few moments she rose again and ran towards&#xD;
the door, saying, "1 will go to them." But Albert&#xD;
Palmer intercepted her, ~eized her, and, carrying her&#xD;
to a chamber, told his mother to follow him. When&#xD;
they had entered the room he left the two ladies&#xD;
there, locked the door, and put the ~key in his pocket.&#xD;
lie returned to his father, and. after relating' to him&#xD;
the events of the night, explained to him his plan&#xD;
with reference to Miss airilnc. She was, he said,&#xD;
without a home. He ather was a prisoner, under&#xD;
grave accusations. might be long detained or&#xD;

sent out of the State. His property might be taken&#xD;
from. him. But if Julia' should become Mrs. Palmer&#xD;
it Would probably be restored, if not to Colonel Faire&#xD;
fax, at least to his daughter, thron~h the influence of&#xD;
her new relative~. The hope 'o:C thus rell~ving her&#xD;
parents and of procuring the liberation of her father&#xD;
through the same influence, he believed, would induce&#xD;
her to accept his hand. The greater the distress and&#xD;
danger of her father might become, the more she&#xD;
would be inclined to accede to measui'es necessary for&#xD;
iii~ relief Perhaps it would be expedient to have&#xD;
Colonel Fairfax sent to Washington, so that the hopes&#xD;
and fears of his daughter; deprived of communication&#xD;
with him, and un~,ertain as to his fate, might render&#xD;
her more pliant. Of course, Mr. Palmer and his son&#xD;
would ultimately procure his teleaser as well as the&#xD;
possession of his property, and his daughter would&#xD;
be provided with a husband and a home. This scheme&#xD;
appeared to the elder Palmer so wise and benevolent,&#xD;
that he cheerfully consented, at his son's request, to&#xD;
keep Miss Fairfax in hi~ house and to visit Colonel&#xD;
Wesel the next day, as we have seen he did.&#xD;
Mrs. Palmer was ignorant of this 'plan when she&#xD;
found herself shut up in a chamber with Miss Fairfax,&#xD;
and she had nothing to guide her conduct but confi-&#xD;
dence in her son and obedience to his wishes. She&#xD;
could not frame a suitable speech, but she put her&#xD;
arms about Julia and gently urged her to a bed, be-&#xD;
seeching her, in a motherly ~yay, to sleep. . The un-&#xD;
happy young lady lay down without resistance, and&#xD;
remained for several hours, not sleeping, but weeping,&#xD;
with her eyes closed 'and her arms folded over her&#xD;
bosom, without speech or motion. She was alone,&#xD;
friendless, hopeless. She was exhausted in mind, and&#xD;

~     of that night.. At length, 'when the day was break-&#xD;
ing, nature yielded to slumber,' and she endured,&#xD;
rather than enjoyed, for an hour, a dreamy, restless&#xD;
sleep. She awoke with a more vivid sense of afflic-&#xD;
tion.&#xD;
In the morning, Mrs. Palmer was released from&#xD;
confinement by her son, who intimated his plan to&#xD;
her, and while his father was calling on Colonel&#xD;
Wesel, sent her with his compliments to Miss Fair-&#xD;
flux, and requested permission to wait upon the!yonng&#xD;
lady in her chamber. She desired hint to excuse her,&#xD;
and even protested against his visit. But he de-&#xD;
dared that it ~wi~s necessary for him to see her, and&#xD;
his message to that effect was immediately followed'&#xD;
by himself. He drew up a chair to sit beside her, but&#xD;
she rose, and remained standing. lie made no nlhi-&#xD;
sion to her movement, but in cool and civil tones pro-&#xD;
ceeded to address her.&#xD;
"Miss Fairfax, misled by appearances, you have&#xD;
placed an erroneous construction upon my conduct.&#xD;
I came to offer~you an explanation." He paused, but&#xD;
receiving no reply, he resumed. "You have thought&#xD;
me unkind to you, but really my motives 'have been&#xD;
more than kind. In. all that I have doueIhave&#xD;
aimed 'at your welfare and happiness. Perhaps the.&#xD;
ardor of my affeotiom for you has impelled me too' far.&#xD;
I could not avert the misfortune which has befallen&#xD;

military. 'I saved yourself in the only way that was&#xD;

While he delivered this speech with sedate mar~nor&#xD;

rently unmoved. 'When. he ceased to speak, she&#xD;
turned her eyes. full upQn him, and still. restraining&#xD;
he~ emotion~ she said, "Mrs, palmer, your motives are&#xD;

they are kind, set me free"&#xD;
"I have 'proved more-my love. I offer you the&#xD;
strongest proof of love."&#xD;
"Surely, .you would not hold me a captive, and&#xD;

has once been re8pectfhlly declined."&#xD;
"Love, 'my. dear lady; is bliud to. circumstances,&#xD;

rendered you more favorable to my wishes. Let me&#xD;
hope that you will give me a right to protect you in&#xD;
all dangers and difficulties. Until you decide upon&#xD;
my. proposal, I cannot consider any other subject"&#xD;
"If that is a covert threat, I must speak without re-&#xD;
serve, and tell you that 'there is an insurmountable&#xD;
barrier to. your proposal. Let the. snbjeet be dis-&#xD;
missed forever."&#xD;
"I cannot imagine a barrier really insurmountable,&#xD;
Miss Falifax. May I ask what it is ?"'&#xD;
"I-yes-my hand is promised to. another."&#xD;
"Indeed 1" he said, commencing his reply in the&#xD;
measured aeceats which had hitherto mocked his vic-&#xD;
tim, but the avowal of an engagement with 'a rival&#xD;
whom he hated already, .because~ he believed him to&#xD;
be a successful rival, roused his ~ger, and as he went&#xD;
on, he spoke with manifest ~aspe~4ty~ "such engage-&#xD;
iuent~ are n6t usually deemed irrevocable, by young&#xD;
ladies. Times have changed. When I shall convince&#xD;
you that the person to whom you have incautiously&#xD;

with a heavt insult a captive lady by maligning her'&#xD;
affianced? Hugh Fitzhugh is that which you prove&#xD;
yourself not to be-a man an~I a gentleman."&#xD;
"I admire your spirit, Miss Fairfax, but you have&#xD;
not quite fathomed' the question. There are other af-&#xD;
fections and obligations somCtimes to be considered,&#xD;
even before a gii'l's fancy for a lover. Your love and&#xD;

It depends upon yourself alone to release your father&#xD;
from captivity."&#xD;
While he was speaking, Julia's head sunk down&#xD;
upon her breast, and tears streamed from her eyes.&#xD;
At last she fell upon her knees before him, and un-&#xD;
plored him to be merciful.&#xD;
"You say you have power to save him. 0, save&#xD;
my father, and spre his wretched child. Do not.-&#xD;
do not annex a cruel condition to an act of mercy.&#xD;
Respect my truth. 'Spare my grief. 0, save my&#xD;

"Rise, Miss Fairfax. This abasement is unneces-&#xD;

"Then you reject, me again, Miss ?"&#xD;
"I can give no other answer."&#xD;
"Reflection may change your mind. Good morn-&#xD;

bed and gaveway~ to a conflict of emotions. Some-&#xD;
times she reproached herself; and was ready to recall&#xD;
Palmer and submit to his terms, rather than leave her&#xD;
father in captivity and in danger of a more terrible&#xD;
fate. But hi~ image rising before her mind, rebuked&#xD;

while she sat upon his knee, he had often taught her&#xD;
the lessons of truth and fortitude' and faith. His sim-&#xD;

heart as they had impressed 'ft in. her, childhood. She&#xD;
felt assured that he, would approve her decision. He&#xD;
would sacrifice- himself for truth and for -her happi-&#xD;

sacrifice her father to her own happiness? She was&#xD;
racked with doubt. Her 'soul, exhausting itself in&#xD;

yet doubting, she sunk at last to sleep, through phy-&#xD;

ABOUT sense on the second day of her imprison-&#xD;
ment, the chamber in which Miss Fairfaix was de-&#xD;
tained, was again entered by Albert Palmer. She&#xD;
arose and stood as she always did while he was in the&#xD;
room, thus silently protes1~ing against his intrr~sion.&#xD;
He advanced, addressing her in words~ of ordinary&#xD;
salutation, with an. air of deferential courtesy. Re-&#xD;
ceiving no response, he proceeded to speak in a strain&#xD;
of sentiment, which became warmer as he went on,&#xD;
and, finally, less delicate. With some ardor of expres-&#xD;
sion on his lips aiid in his ey&amp;amp;s, he moved towards&#xD;
her, with an arm extended, as if he would lay his hand&#xD;
upon her. Stepping backward she waved him off&#xD;
and said, quietly, but decisively, "no nearer, sir."&#xD;
He paused, clasped his hands together, and spoke in&#xD;
an obsequious tone:&#xD;
"Ah, my dear Julia, do not continue to trample on&#xD;
my love."&#xD;
"Mr. Palmer," she replied, "I beg that this insult..&#xD;
ing mockery shall cease."&#xD;
"Then you doom your father to a dungeon ?" he&#xD;
asked, with a sneer.&#xD;
"My duty to my father, sir, is not a subject for dis-&#xD;
cussion between you and me. Use it not to barb your&#xD;
taunts. I aiii now proof against them. I know you&#xD;
now and I despise you, I detest you, I defy you."&#xD;
He turned to the chamber door and locked it. lie&#xD;
&#xD;
ROEBUCK.      271&#xD;
&#xD;
then returned towards Julia, his eyes glaring with&#xD;
ignQble passions. "By Heaven," he .cried, "you&#xD;
shall consent to marriage or prate no more of honor~"&#xD;
She retired before kiim, but springing for rd, he&#xD;
attempted to seize her. She eluded his grasp by tep-&#xD;
ping up on the bed. Retreating to the opposite i e&#xD;
of it, whi~h was against a wall, she stood there in a&#xD;
posture ot defiance, pointing a pistol at Palmer. Her&#xD;
movements, as well as his, were so Tapid that his face&#xD;
almost touched the weapon before he was aware that&#xD;
she held it. Seeing it then, he started back with a&#xD;
gesture of fear, and stood iii a shrinking attitude, gaz-&#xD;
ing at the pistol. While they thus confronted each&#xD;
other, they heard a light rap on' the door, and under-&#xD;
stood that Mrs. Palmer desired admittance. He slowly&#xD;
retreated to the door and .opened ~t. As he retired,&#xD;
Julia descended from the bed. She had restored. the&#xD;
little weaPon to her pocket when Mrs. Palmer entered,&#xD;
and her son, scowling at'Jalia, went out.&#xD;
The small pistol which Julia had held in her hand,&#xD;
rather ~a toy than a weapon, was one which her father&#xD;
had procured for her after she had been endangered&#xD;
by negroes, as related in the preceding pages. He&#xD;
gave her some~ lessons in the use of it, so that she&#xD;
might be able to defend herself in sudden peril, such&#xD;
as the recent events and the condition of the country&#xD;
led him to apprehend. She seldom carried it, how-&#xD;
ever, and it was by chance that, when she4was prepar-&#xD;
ing to flee from the mansion of Roebuck, she put on a&#xD;
gown, in the pocket of which the pistol had been left.&#xD;
In the excitements of that night she did not observe&#xD;
it, but she discovered it the ..next day. She reniem-&#xD;
bered it when Palmer attempted to seize her, and&#xD;
instantly availed herself of it, as we have seen, for her&#xD;
defence.&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb  n="272-273" xml:id="VAC7684-00000137"/>&#xD;
When she was again left with Mrs. Palmer she&#xD;
walked to ~nd fro, agitated with an indignant sense&#xD;
of insult and outrage. She uttered no word of&#xD;
complaint to the mother and agent of her persecutor.&#xD;
Her spirit was bruised, b~it it was roused. Still alone,&#xD;
in the power of her enemies, she defied them. She&#xD;
would not' bow before a foe who left her no choice but&#xD;
between defiance and dishonor.&#xD;
Night caine on, but, at Julia's request, the room&#xD;
was noi~ lighted. She sat down by a window and&#xD;
looked out' at the sky. Mrs. Palmer, seated in a rock..&#xD;
ing chai~ at the opposite side of the chamber, began&#xD;
to yawn; and finally fell asleep. The night was clear&#xD;
and still. While Julia gazed at the bright stars, her&#xD;
excitement gradually abated. When her veins yet&#xD;
throbbed with passion, the quiet heavens seemed to&#xD;
her imagination to regard with cruel indifference&#xD;
the woes and crimes of earth. But as the tide of vio~&#xD;
lent emotion subsided, higher and serene sentiments&#xD;
*   responded more faithfully to the sublime sense of that&#xD;
eternal quiet "It is not indifference to wrong," she&#xD;
said to herself, "that we should read in those sleep~&#xD;
*   less eyes of Heaven, but their far-seeing watch regards&#xD;
the end as well as the beginning of these dark scenes&#xD;
in which we grope and suffer. Their serene silence is&#xD;
the h6mage of nature to the unerring Providence&#xD;
which guides all events on earth as in Heaven.&#xD;
Darkling, but not disrnhyed, I will endeavor to walk&#xD;
by the light that Comes from above, and trust the&#xD;
consequences to Him who o'dains right and redresses&#xD;
eviL"&#xD;
While her mind was composing itself by such re~&#xD;
elections, she was started by~the sight of a man's heaj&#xD;
near the window. Wondering, but rather hoping thai;'&#xD;
&#xD;
* fearing, she leaned her face against the pane and&#xD;
looked' out into the dark. She 4i~eov~red that the&#xD;
man was upon a ladder, and as h~ dtew' near to the'&#xD;
window, he made a sign of silence to her. She did&#xD;
not recognize him, but believing that all her enemies&#xD;
were within the house, she readily concluded that he&#xD;
was a friend. Listening for the deep breathing of&#xD;
Mrs. Palmer, and being 1~bus assured that she still&#xD;
slept, Julia opened the sash quietly and beard hen&#xD;
name whispered. "What do you want V' ,she whi&amp;amp;&#xD;
pered, in reply. "Follow me ;" and the man descended&#xD;
the ladder. Dreading no danger equal to that which&#xD;
she left behind, she followed without hesitation.&#xD;
When they were upon the ground, the inan~, wh~ was&#xD;
then seen to wear the Confederate uniform, led her in&#xD;
silence to a clump of trees at some distance fron~ the&#xD;
house. There they found another ~rson, mounted,&#xD;
and holding the bridles of two horses. There was a&#xD;
woman's saddle on one of them, and, as Julia soon&#xD;
discovered, this was her favorite, Arab. First assisting&#xD;
her to mount, her conductor got upon his horse' and&#xD;
the three rode away through the fields. They moved&#xD;
caixtiously, and not a word was spoken until, after rid~&#xD;
ing a mile or r~iore, they entere&amp;amp;a wood.&#xD;
"Now, Miss Fairfax," said the man who released&#xD;
her, and whom she recognized as Lieutenant Mark&#xD;
Marlin, while she knew his companion to be Baxter,&#xD;
"we are safe for the present. It is for you to say&#xD;
where we shall go."&#xD;
"To my father, if I can," she replied.&#xD;
"We hear that he has been sent out of the county."&#xD;
"Alas, it is true, then. Let me go to my mother."&#xD;
"We will conduct you to her. She is now about&#xD;
Len miles from here. We must ride pretty briskly if&#xD;

y'ou please, because, after leaving you, we must travel&#xD;
as far as we can before morning' for our own safety and&#xD;
and to rejoin our regiment."&#xD;
As they rode rapidly and cautiously over rough. by-&#xD;
ways to avoid pursuit, they could hold but little con-&#xD;
versation. Julia, however., learned from Marlin what&#xD;
he knew about her mother., and that Baxtei' had ob-&#xD;
tained from blind Pete the information on which they&#xD;
had acted in facilitating her escape. Thus they knew&#xD;
in what chamber Miss Faii'fax was detained, where&#xD;
her horse could be found, where a ladder was kept,&#xD;
and other particulars, the knowledge of which made this&#xD;
enterprise tolerably safe and easy to the two Confede~&#xD;
rates. Her horse had been taken from Roebuck by&#xD;
the Federal soldiers, but, by order of Colonel Wesel,&#xD;
was.delivered to Mr. Palmer, at that gentleman's re~&#xD;
quest. He stated to the colonel that the young lady&#xD;
had taken refuge in his house, and insinuated that she&#xD;
did not agree with her father in political sentiment&#xD;
and that she might possibly become connected witt&#xD;
his own family. These representations served not&#xD;
only to secure the possession of her horse, but to&#xD;
silence inquiry, if it should otherwise become kndwn&#xD;
to the colonel that Miss Fairfax was at Mr. Palmer's.&#xD;
Baxter, after his escape from the village, concealed&#xD;
himself in the neighborhood nntiVthe next morning,&#xD;
and then starting to overtake his regiment, he fell in&#xD;
with Mark Marlin, who had come home to take care&#xD;
of his sister. Notwithstanding his own affliction and&#xD;
the sad duties which the death of his sister imposed&#xD;
upon him, the lieutenant, as soon as he heard of Miss&#xD;
Fairfax's situation, resolved to rescue her. He imme-&#xD;
diately set about the attempt, with 'Baxter'&#xD;
ance, and we have seen the result.&#xD;
&#xD;
Arriving before the house in which Mr~ Fairfax&#xD;
was then a guest, Marlin informed Julia that he and&#xD;
his companion must leave her, and requested that&#xD;
their presence in the county might not be, mentione,&#xD;
until they would have time to travel beyond the reach&#xD;
of the enemy.&#xD;
"how can I ever thank you as you deserve, gen-&#xD;
tlemen?" said Julia.&#xD;
"I am still your debtor, Miss Fairfax; but, if you&#xD;
please, we will leave these things to be spoken. of&#xD;
some other time ;" replt~d Marlin, to whom Baxter&#xD;
left the conversation with Miss Fairfax ~ for his own&#xD;
audacity was cowed, and his saucy tongue was mute&#xD;
in presence of a lady whoiii he was obliged to&#xD;
respect.&#xD;
"I know" she said, "that I must not detain you,&#xD;
and I fear that already your delay, for mysake, has&#xD;
exposed you .to danger. Never can I cease to be&#xD;
grateful to you. In happier times, for us all, I hope,.&#xD;
I may be able to prove my gratitude."&#xD;
~' Have you any message for the regiment-the&#xD;
boys, Miss Fairfax."&#xD;
"Tell the brave meil that the hearts of their country&#xD;
women ~re always with them. May God1 bless them.&#xD;
Tell Colonel Fitzhugh that-that I-I have not for&#xD;
gotten him."&#xD;
"You remember, then, as gallant a soldier as ever&#xD;
drew a sword. Farewell, Miss Fairfax."&#xD;
"Farewell, Mr. Marlin; farewell, Mr. Baxter. I&#xD;
shall neverforget"-'&#xD;
Baxter briefly echoed her farewell, while she shook&#xD;
hands with them both, and they hurried away before&#xD;
she concluded the sentence. Julia, alone, approached&#xD;
the house in which she expected to meet her mother.&#xD;

ROEBUCK.&#xD;
At that late hour all was silent, but alarms were then&#xD;
so' frequent, that every family was alert. As soon as&#xD;
she 'knocked at the door an upper window was cau-&#xD;
tiously opened, and a voice inquired who was there.&#xD;
She gave the necessary explanation, and was admit.&#xD;
ted. Her mother, who slept Uut little, recognized her&#xD;
'voice, and immediately called' her into her own cham-&#xD;
ber. 'The meeting between them could not be with-&#xD;
out joy, nor yet could it be without sorrow. To be thus&#xD;
united, after such a separation, was rapture. To re-&#xD;
mind each other of the absence, suffering and danger&#xD;
of another', ~sb dear to both, was anguish. In smiles&#xD;
and tears, in embraces and regrets, in conV~ersation&#xD;
about, the one on whom their anxious thoughts were&#xD;
centered, they spent the hours, until the sun was high&#xD;
in the heavens. It was not until the tlush of excite-&#xD;
ment faded from her mother's face, and the pitiless&#xD;
light of day fell upon it, that Julia was fully aware of&#xD;
the ravages that terror and affliction had made there.&#xD;
When she looked upon. that form so frail, those&#xD;
cheeks so wan, the pallid lips and the sunken eyes,&#xD;
apprehension for her mother's health divided her&#xD;
heart with anxiety for her father's safety.&#xD;
Julia's sensibility was both delicate and warm.&#xD;
But no excess of feeling ever prevailed long over th~&#xD;
clear judgment and steady sense of duty which habi..&#xD;
tually regulated her conduct. Under a delicate sur-&#xD;
face of feminine beauty, grace and tenderne8s, her&#xD;
character contained a strength of' principle which&#xD;
made even the play of her emotions, like the vibra~.&#xD;
tions of a watch-spring, contribute to the practical,&#xD;
uses of life. Her sympathy with sickness and dis-&#xD;
tress did not vanish in sighs. It prompted her to&#xD;
give relief with quiet and thoughtful energy, whilst&#xD;

4&#xD;
&#xD;
I~oBBUOE.         2'7'7&#xD;
&#xD;
only the extreme gentleness of her ministrations&#xD;
showed how much of another's suffering 'she felt as&#xD;
her own. Thus during the next few days, she de-&#xD;
voted herself to th~ care of her afflicted mother.&#xD;
'Knowing her tastes and habits, anticipating her wants&#xD;
with quick intelligence, providing for her physical&#xD;
co~nfaft with untiring diligence, her daughter also en-&#xD;
deavored to soothe her mind. If anything could have&#xD;
had that effect, it would have been the presence of&#xD;
Julia. Withdrawing her thoughts from her own&#xD;
troubles in order that she might win her mother from&#xD;
despondency, she became~ almost cheerful. Jier&#xD;
noiseless step seemed rather light from hope than&#xD;
stealthy from fear. When to the loveliness of her&#xD;
person, and the sweetness of her countenance, was ad~&#xD;
ded the tender earnestness of filial affection, she looked,&#xD;
while she hovered over her mother's pillow, as if her&#xD;
love alone might dispel all gloom from the brow on&#xD;
which her soft, white hand was fondly laid~ She e~-&#xD;
erted all the charms of her voice and cenVersation to&#xD;
banish the spectre of despair that haunted her mother&#xD;
by day and by nigl~, Yet, she found 'that, as the&#xD;
reader already knows, the delicate lady continued t~&#xD;
pine and waste away. Indeed, Julia. became con-&#xD;
vinced that the life of the wife depended upon the&#xD;
restoration of the husband to liberty. Father and&#xD;
mother-the lives of both, she believed, were in peril,&#xD;
and might depend oxi the same contingency.&#xD;
When she had arrived at this conclusion, her&#xD;
thoughts uaturally reverted to the proposal of Palmer,&#xD;
which, as he declared, might have led to the release&#xD;
of her father. But, even n6w, she could not repent&#xD;
that she had rejected it. She remembered it with&#xD;
'increased disgust, when it appeared to her as a profli-&#xD;

gate proposal to traffic with' two lives so dear to her,&#xD;
so worthy of honor, and so afflicted. But it was not&#xD;
in her nature to look on misery without an effort to&#xD;
relieve it, and, least of all, the misery of her own&#xD;
parents. Her mind addressed itself with customary&#xD;
directness and fbrce to. the question how she might&#xD;
procure the restoration of her father to his family.&#xD;
After much reflection, she came to a 'resolution, which&#xD;
she first disclosed to Mrs. Fitzhugh.&#xD;
That lady treated Julia as a daughter and shared all&#xD;
her cares and counsels. She, tao, believed that the&#xD;
days of Mrs. Fairfax would be few unless her husband&#xD;
were released, and that his life might be endangered by&#xD;
his imprisonment under the actual circumstances Of.&#xD;
course, she participated in hi~ daughter's desire to&#xD;
obtain his liberation. But there seemed to be no&#xD;
means wIthin the power of the two Women to effect&#xD;
that object. They Were assured that the Federal&#xD;
officer commanding in the county was hostile te Gel..&#xD;
onel Fairfax, and that the Palmers wc~re accomplices&#xD;
in the oppression practiced upon himif they were not&#xD;
the instigators. It was not deemed possible to induce&#xD;
those men to relax the rigor of persecution except&#xD;
upon a condition known only to Julia, and regarded&#xD;
her with horror. The two ladies discussed the&#xD;
subject several times without a satis~hctory result. ~At&#xD;
last, when it was again renewed, Julia said to Mrs.&#xD;
Fitzhugh........" I believe I can obtain my father's re-&#xD;
lease."&#xD;
"How is it possibk~, my dear Julia ?"&#xD;
"I will go to Washington and petition the Federal&#xD;
authorities."&#xD;
"You are a brave girl, Julia, t~ make such an&#xD;
attempt, but it would be useless."&#xD;

&#xD;
"I bope not, Mrs. Fitzhugh, but, at all events, I&#xD;
may succeed, and there appears to be no other chance&#xD;
of saving their lives. I will try."&#xD;
"What rational ground can you find to hope for&#xD;
success ~ It is not probable that you will ever reach&#xD;
Washington. I say nothing of the dangers. by the&#xD;
* way, for I know you will not be deterred by them,&#xD;
* and, my dear child, I cannot say that you ought to be.&#xD;
But if you were in Washington, the authorities will&#xD;
certainly act according to the reports and suggestions&#xD;
of their own officers and adherents in the county.&#xD;
What else can they know of your father 'I"&#xD;
-" That seems plausible. But I imagine that men in&#xD;
high office must be free from some of the ~bitter and&#xD;
vulgar animosity which is apt to affect inferior agents.&#xD;
Besides, they are remote from the intrigues of this&#xD;

CHAPTER XXVI.&#xD;
'ruE JOURNEY.&#xD;
&#xD;
BUT little delay w~s necessary y for the preparalions&#xD;
* which Julia had to make for her long and dangerous&#xD;
journey. Not much conidhe carried, if she had desired&#xD;
to carry. much. The fire wh~h destroyed her father's&#xD;
house consumed her wardrobe, and country ladies had&#xD;
but poor opportunitie~ of shopping in pixie during&#xD;
the war. She might be ready to travel alr~iost as soon&#xD;
as Arab could be saddled. She had no m~ney, and&#xD;
could obtain none, except a few dollar's in sPecie and a&#xD;
supply of treasury notes, which were almost worthless&#xD;
beyond the Confederate lines, though they were the&#xD;
exclusive currency of the Confederacy. She was to&#xD;
travel alone, as well because nearly all those who might&#xD;
have been her protector~ ~vere in the army ~r driven&#xD;
from the county, as because, in the country through&#xD;
which she had to pass, a male companion might chal-.&#xD;
lenge annoyance and could not defend hbr. It was a&#xD;
country where even an army of ConfederateS could not.&#xD;
hold its ground.&#xD;
With a brave but sad heart she took leave of her&#xD;
frienc~s. The parting between her and her mother&#xD;
was a severe affliction to both. Th~ hope of her hus-.&#xD;
band's release sustained 1~irs; Fairfax, and Julia, im~&#xD;
peeled by love and duty, would not falter at the first&#xD;
of those trials which she had anticipated. Early in&#xD;
the morning she set out upon her solitary jo~1rney,&#xD;
'and rode nearlythe entire day without pausingt~ rest~&#xD;

&#xD;
She felt but little fatigue. She was a delicate woman,&#xD;
and had been nurtured in wealth and refinement but&#xD;
not in luxury. The habits of her life had tended to&#xD;
confirm rather than enervate her strength, both of&#xD;
bo~y and of mind. It was a rare state of society in&#xD;
which nature was thus refined and strengthened at the&#xD;
same time, as iron is. changed to steel.&#xD;
During the first day she traveled through a part of&#xD;
the country that was familiar to her. Without much&#xD;
difficulty she avoided the most frequei4ted highways&#xD;
and places of resort for the Federals, and she neither&#xD;
met any troops nor encountered any impediment.&#xD;
She saw" but few people. Not many remained at&#xD;
home, except old men, women and children, an4 they&#xD;
generally kept close to their houses. Some boys and&#xD;
old men and a few women were at work in the fields.&#xD;
twice Julia sa them plowing,~ with cows&#xD;
Horses and mules were not to be seen. Some dwell..&#xD;
ings were wholly deserte~I; the doors and widows&#xD;
were broken; the fruit-.tr~es about tl)em. were hacked&#xD;
do~wn; the gardens were destroyed; the barns, fences&#xD;
and stacks had been burned. Here and there brick&#xD;
chimneys of wooden houses that had been devoured&#xD;
by the flames, stood as milestones of invasion. A few&#xD;
slaves, old, decrepid or faithful, remained with the white&#xD;
inhabitants, but most of them had straggled off: Now&#xD;
and then Julia passed a negro, lying asleep at the way..&#xD;
side, with his shining face upturned to the sun, or saw&#xD;
stout black fellows strolling about in listless indolence.&#xD;
The lethargy of that race seemed to forebode a relapse&#xD;
into lazy barbarism as Soon as the spur and rein of&#xD;
the white man's authority were withdrawn, as the&#xD;
neglected soil was resuming the unfruitful wildne~&#xD;
of nature. The desolation which Julia Wit11es,3~d&#xD;
&#xD;
ROEBUCIC~                 283&#xD;
deepened her sadness. But it is impossible to record&#xD;
all she saw and thought and felt on that journey with-.&#xD;
out overspreading these pages with intolerable gloom.&#xD;
In our reminiscences of those times we must soften the&#xD;
truth if we would obtain a hearing or belief.&#xD;
Late in the afternoon, Julia arrived at the house of&#xD;
a friend, and there she spent the night. She heard a&#xD;
rumor there, that daring the day a party. of Federal&#xD;
soldiers- had been seen within a feW miles of the place.&#xD;
This rumor, however, scarcely added a new. fear to&#xD;
the constant apprehension that her journey might be&#xD;
interrupted. The next morning she took the road&#xD;
again, traveling through a district lees known to her&#xD;
than that through which she had passed the day be-.&#xD;
fore. She was, therefore, obliged to keep on the&#xD;
main hi~"hway. When she had pursued her solitary&#xD;
way two or three hours, sh~ looked back, and saw&#xD;
several horsemen about a mile behind her, and appa-.&#xD;
rently moving towards her. Fearing they were Fed-.&#xD;
eral soldiers, she put her horse to a quicker p~ce.&#xD;
They followed, however, still more rapidly than she&#xD;
rode. For a short time they were concealed from her&#xD;
by a hill over which she was passing, when she dis-.&#xD;
covered them. In a few minutes she saw them gal-&#xD;
loping over the crest of the hill,* not more ~hau half a&#xD;
mile from her. Then she imagined that she could&#xD;
distinguish the tall form of Albert Palmer among&#xD;
them.&#xD;
In fact, he was there. lie had not discovered her&#xD;
place of retreat after she disappeared from h~s father's&#xD;
house. But, being with some cavalry, that were&#xD;
foraging or ravaging near the place at which she&#xD;
spent the first night of her jouriiey, he learned in the&#xD;
morning from the gossip of a negro, that she had set&#xD;

out from there alone. Immediateljiie started, with a&#xD;
few followers, in pursuit of her.&#xD;
As soon as she became convinced that she was pur-&#xD;
sued and, suspected that Palmer was among the pur-&#xD;
suers, she put Arab to his utmost speed.. The eavalr~f&#xD;
behind her used their sj~iirs freely. Palmer, dashing&#xD;
off~ before the others, came on at a furious gait. Julia,&#xD;
a practiced horse.woman, on a fleet and spirited horse,&#xD;
could not easily be overtaken; but, for three or four&#xD;
miles, the chase pressed Arab to his mettle. The gal-&#xD;
hint horse, excited by the race, seemed to share the&#xD;
determination of his rider to distance the pursuers.&#xD;
ii' Gradually he widened the spae~ between him and the&#xD;
foremost of the cavalry. Relying upon his qualities,&#xD;
Julia rode with steady courage, until, suddenly, she&#xD;
beheld a cloud of .dust rising from the road before&#xD;
hers Suspecting at once that 'there was a larger body&#xD;
of Federal cavalry in front of her, and that' no chance&#xD;
of escape was left, her heart sunk for a moment. But&#xD;
she looked back, and the sight of Palmer, in eager&#xD;
pursuit, reminded her that, whatever might be beibre&#xD;
her, she was lea~4ng her most cruel enemy behind.&#xD;
She resolved to go forward. Onward she flew. Her&#xD;
rapid flight soon brought her in sight of five or six&#xD;
horsemen ~who were approaching on the road before&#xD;
her. Onward still 'she flew. She was very near&#xD;
them before she 'could discern, under the dust which&#xD;
covered them, that' their uniforms' were of Confed-&#xD;
erate ~'ey. Checking her horse, she cried out to&#xD;
thern-"J am pursued, by Federal cavalry."&#xD;
"Howmany~"'&#xD;
"1. have seen ten or twelve. One of them rides&#xD;
far in advance of the rest. There! He comes in&#xD;

&#xD;
284&#xD;
&#xD;
"l~ide on, madam. You are safe. Colonel Fit~-&#xD;
hugh's regiment is not far behind us. We must move&#xD;
forward."&#xD;
They started at a brisk trot. When Palmer s~w&#xD;
them first, he thought they must be Federals. He&#xD;
was almost among them before he discovered h'is mis~&#xD;
take. 'Then, wheeling hi~ horse, he was pursued in&#xD;
hi~ turn. Julii saw no more of him. Riding slowly&#xD;
on, and wondering at the chance which brought her&#xD;
so unexpectedly out of danger into the protection of&#xD;
Hugh Fitzhugh, she saw a cloud of dust, which, at a&#xD;
considerable distance, indicated the approach of his&#xD;
regiment.&#xD;
A spring, near the side of the road, attracted her&#xD;
attention, and she stopped to rest and refresh herself.&#xD;
She sat down on the grass, near the spring, and; after&#xD;
drinking, she bathed her brows witk hei' hands. The&#xD;
spring was shaded by trees and vines. With the in-&#xD;
stinct of a woman, expecting a lover, she arranged&#xD;
her hair 'and dress, while she waited for 'the regiment&#xD;
to come up. When the head of the column drew&#xD;
near, she stood upon a grassy knoll near the spring,&#xD;
under a canopy of vines. ~She held the bridle, while&#xD;
her horse, with distended nostrils,, ears erect, and&#xD;
arched neck, gazed ~t the warlike array. Her veil&#xD;
was thrown back, her fair complexion was rosy with&#xD;
excitement, her hazel eyes were moistened with the&#xD;
mystery of tears that were not - weeping, and her&#xD;
graceful form stOod' a picture of~, living loveliness in a&#xD;
frame of sylvan beauty.&#xD;
When hugh Fitzhugh, turning from the dusty road&#xD;
to the spri~-suddenly beheld hei', he' was amazed,'&#xD;
enraptured, alarmed. "My Julia," he exclaimed2 as&#xD;
he leaped from hi~ horse, and ran towards her. Has.&#xD;

&#xD;
tending to meet him, she threw herself into his arms,&#xD;
and burst into tears.&#xD;
* ",J~ilia, my own Julia, why is this ~? Why do you&#xD;
weep? ~hy are you here ?"&#xD;
For some moments she was unable to answer his&#xD;
anxiously repeated questions. But when the par~&#xD;
oxysm of emotion was passed, she lifted her head, and&#xD;
looked in his face, while she smiled through 4ier.&#xD;
tears.&#xD;
'"Pardon me. It was a woman's weakness. I weep&#xD;
for joy or grief.-I know not why. But it is over. .1&#xD;
can talk to you now. I must not detain, you long,&#xD;
'and I have much to say."&#xD;
Then, glancing at the cavalry, she blushed deeply&#xD;
at the display of emotion which she had made. She&#xD;
drew her veil over her face and whispered, "0, for-&#xD;
give, me, Hugh." He pressed her hand, and was&#xD;
leading her to a seat when they heard a shout.' Al-&#xD;
ready her ~iame was passing' from' mouth to mouth,&#xD;
and as it ran along the ranks, the men began to cheer&#xD;
for Miss Fairfax. Many of them knew and admired&#xD;
her. Others cheered, because they loved their col-&#xD;
onel, and knew or suspected that he loved her.&#xD;
Finally, some there were who shouted, simply be-&#xD;
cause cheers are contagious. At all events, the name&#xD;
of ML~s Fairfax was echoed with cheers along the&#xD;
whole line. The enthusiasm waxed warmer and&#xD;
warmer, until.Julia, turning her face to the regiment;&#xD;
raised her veil, and graceftilly acknowledged the bois-&#xD;
terous salutation.&#xD;
While the regiment marched on, Hugh Fitzhn~h,&#xD;
seated. beside Julia, learned from h'w the circumstan~&#xD;
ces which led to this meeting. They were soon joined&#xD;
l~y her uncle, Doctor Dick, who had been with his&#xD;
&#xD;
ROEBUCK.                 ~2'S7'&#xD;
company since the opening of the spring campaign.&#xD;
What, Colonel Julia, have you come to take eotn~&#xD;
mand in person ?" he exclaimed. Then be shook both&#xD;
her hands and kissed her over and over. It was not&#xD;
tong, however, before he was seriously engaged in the&#xD;
discussion to which Julia's communication gave rise.&#xD;
l3oth to her uncle and to her lover, her journey ap-&#xD;
Kpcared too hazardous, and .the object of it wholly&#xD;
impracl7icable. The~ urged her to abandon it and re-&#xD;
turn with them. The e was a long debate, in which&#xD;
their solicitude for he ~afe.ty contended with her&#xD;
anxiety for the liberty of her father~ iind lives of both&#xD;
her parents. They found her filial devotion invincible,&#xD;
and nothing was left for them but to consider Mw&#xD;
they might contribute to the ease and safety of her&#xD;
journey. Colonel Fitzhugh proposed to send a guard.&#xD;
with her, but gave up that proposition when sl~ men-&#xD;
tioned her, reasons for traveling alone. The doctor&#xD;
lhen declared that he would himself escort her. He&#xD;
insisted 'that, with his servant, Caleb, he could relieve&#xD;
her of any troubles and embarrassments to which a&#xD;
woman traveling alone was liable, and that a little old&#xD;
man, as he styled himself, and a poor told. negro,' would&#xD;
not provoke more hostility, than a lady She doubted&#xD;
the prudence of the proposition, and would have saved&#xD;
her ui~cle from dangers wjiich were useless. But he&#xD;
combated her, objections with 'sonic plausibility of&#xD;
argument, and more pertinacity ~f purpose. He was&#xD;
seconded by her lover, and finally prevailed. Colonel&#xD;
Fitzhugh envied the doctor his office, and would gladly&#xD;
'have taken his place if propriety and duty had per-&#xD;
nritted. He lingered beside her after this matter was&#xD;
arranged as long as his conscience allowed, and they&#xD;
exchanged some of those tender words which are pro-&#xD;

faued by publication. Besides the natural~ reluctance&#xD;
of a lover to leave her, he felt a presentiment that this&#xD;
parting might be final, fo# he knew that they were&#xD;
both going into danger. But .thethought of his own&#xD;
coming danger reminded him of the urgency of his&#xD;
militax:y duty. Without knowing 1~he design which&#xD;
he would hasten to fulfil, at the peril of his life, she&#xD;
knew and appreciated the demands of military service,&#xD;
and would not detain hi~n. With a sorrowful farewell&#xD;
they parted.&#xD;
Doctor Fairfax summoned the faithful Caleb, who,&#xD;
with others of lii~ class, was riding at leisure behind&#xD;
the regiment. He had followed his master whenever&#xD;
he was with the army, and, in that branch of the art&#xD;
military which fell within hi&amp;amp; sphere, he had acquired&#xD;
the ready skill of an old campaigner. After testifying&#xD;
his delight at meeting with Miss Julia, by bows and&#xD;
grins and words of learned length and thundering&#xD;
sound, he applied himself, under the doctor's direc..&#xD;
tion, to the care of the horses and the arrangeinentof&#xD;
the baggage of the~ expedition in which hi~ master had&#xD;
just enlisted. With his expert aid everything was&#xD;
ready for.th~ rdad in~ a short time, and Julia, with her&#xD;
escort, resumed her journey.&#xD;
During the ~rest of the day no ev~nt occurred to&#xD;
them of sufficient importance to justify recital. While&#xD;
th~y rode along, Julia related tO her uncle in detail all&#xD;
that had recently happened at Roebuck and in its&#xD;
vicinity.' The doctor was often moved to indigna-&#xD;
tion, and the misfortunes of his brother and his bro-&#xD;
-ther's wife mol:e than once drew tears to his eyes. As&#xD;
to her own sufferings, while she was, a captive in Mr.&#xD;
Palmer's house, she maintained a peculiar reserve in&#xD;
speakingboth to her uncle an4 Hugh Fitzhugh. They&#xD;

Perhaps, too, a consciousness that her ova indignation&#xD;
Tas more intense than it had ever been before, and a&#xD;
* scrupulous fear of carrying revenge too far, ~or of in-&#xD;
volving others in attempts at extreme violence, re-&#xD;
strained~ her from exposing the whole enormity of&#xD;
* Albert Palmer's guilty Enough was known, however,&#xD;
to Cornel Fitzhugh and her uncle to brand'Palmer in&#xD;
their estimation as~ a monster of iniquity, who had&#xD;
wronged her whom they regarded as the most inno-&#xD;
cent and most lovely among women&#xD;
At evening the travelers arrived at the house of a&#xD;
farmer whose name was Bell. He was an acquaint~&#xD;
ance of Doctor Fairfax, and ~consented to entertain&#xD;
them for the night. This was a considerable proof of&#xD;
hospitality; for, ~although Mr. Bell had a good farm, he&#xD;
had nothing to eat for men or horses, except a little&#xD;
corn and bacon,~which he kept concealed lest it should&#xD;
be taken from him or destroyed. Experience had&#xD;
taught jminithis fear and an adroit in in con-&#xD;
cealing the remnants of his supplies. Besides, there&#xD;
was then in his house, awaiting interment, the dead&#xD;
body of his son. The young man had been a soldier in&#xD;
Fitzhugh's regiment, and died suddenly within a few&#xD;
miles of his father's house. As the funeral rites of&#xD;
"rebels" were sometimes. interrupted with insult and&#xD;
outrage .in those parts of the State which were over-&#xD;
run by the invaders, it had been deemed necessary to&#xD;
bring home t~he body of the Confederate soldier pri-&#xD;
vately during the preceding night, and it was to be&#xD;
buried with equal secrosy the very night of Julia's&#xD;

arrival. Notwithstanding their own destitution and&#xD;
affliction, however, Mr. Bell and his family received&#xD;
the traveIer~, and did all that was in their power to&#xD;
make them comfortable.&#xD;
At midnight two or three neighbors had assembled,&#xD;
and, with them, Doctor Fairfax assisted at the inter-&#xD;
ment of the son of his host. They carried the corpse&#xD;
to a ren~ote part of the farm, followed by the father&#xD;
and mother, and lighted only by the stars. Arriving&#xD;
at a spot where a grave was already dug among some&#xD;
old field pines, one of the neighbors lit the candle in a&#xD;
lantern which he had brought Its scanty light tinged&#xD;
the faces of the mourners with a melancholy tint of&#xD;
yellow, and faintly streaming through the pines, it&#xD;
made the heavy masses of dark shadow more funereaL&#xD;

DOCTOR DICL&#xD;
DOCTOR FAIRFAX procured from Mr. Bell a suit of&#xD;
plain ckthes, and left his Confederate uniform. He&#xD;
was about to travel through a part of the State exclu-&#xD;
sively occupied by Federal troops. Not being an en-&#xD;
listed soldier, he felt at liberty to assume or quit the&#xD;
service and its badges for honest and needful pur~&#xD;
poses at hi~ own discretion. Traveling with his niece&#xD;
for an innocent and p~eific object, he though that an&#xD;
old man, in citizen's dress, might be suffered to pass&#xD;
unmolested where a Confederate soldier would cer-&#xD;
tainly be arrested. He did not explain~ to Julia that&#xD;
this ~bange of di'es~ might be so interpreted, possibly,&#xD;
as to augment l~is danger in case of capture. Nor&#xD;
could he bring himself to rely, so absolutely on the&#xD;
immunity of age, innocence and a civil suit, that he&#xD;
would leave his revolvers behind. lie carried two pis-&#xD;
{ols. Thus he set out on* the n~xt day's journey in&#xD;
ambiguous trim, hoping for peace, but prepared for&#xD;
war.&#xD;
They rode t~yo or three hours of the morning with-&#xD;
out interruption, ,and having no occasion for action,&#xD;
Doctor Dick, of course, filled up the time with talk.&#xD;
Julia thought and felt too mu9h for easy conversation.&#xD;
Her uncle was free to indulge himself in soliloquy&#xD;
or in lecture. They came upon a part of the road&#xD;
which passed for a distance of a mile or two' through&#xD;
a forest. They were riding at a walk, aiid Doctor&#xD;
Fairfax had fallen into a disquisition.&#xD;

&#xD;
"Twb rival systems of ciyilization'~!-so his dis-&#xD;
course was running on-.-" have been developed on&#xD;
this continent. The Northern has reached its most&#xD;
advanced stage in Massachusetts, th~ Southern in Vir-&#xD;
ginia. One is founded on trade, the other on agri-&#xD;
culture. One flourishes in cities, as in hot-houses, the&#xD;
other ripens in the sunshine of the country. The&#xD;
Northern is of more rapid growth; the Southern more&#xD;
perfect. By some fatality this trial of force between&#xD;
them ha~ been brought on soon enough to give the&#xD;
North all the advantage of its precocious strength,&#xD;
while half the South is not yet rid of t~ie stumps. I&#xD;
fear, as you know, that in this struggle' the North&#xD;
will prevail. Then the world and posterity will be&#xD;
taught that the N~rthern Bystem is the best, every&#xD;
way. The World is sycophantic, and listens to a con-&#xD;
queror. You know my opinions of this Yankee civil-&#xD;
ization. It makes white slaves, while we U50 the&#xD;
black slaves made by nature. The leading tendency&#xD;
of our system~ is to' cultivate virtue; ef the Yankee'&#xD;
system, to sharpen the wits. Our refinements are re-&#xD;
finemehts of virtue. Our fantastic excess is an exag-&#xD;
geration 9f honor and courage. The~ selfish princi~&#xD;
ciples that we develop as a prop to virtue, is pride-.-&#xD;
theirs, prudence. We incur among the Yankees the&#xD;
disdain which. rustics incur among city- fops. The&#xD;
prime products of our social system. are' noble men&#xD;
and' women. The Northern-see--there are sped-&#xD;
mens now, I verily believe."&#xD;
The travelers were enierging froni the wood, and&#xD;
were in a view of a farm-house that stood at no great&#xD;
distance from them. Fr~rn the house a lane led to the&#xD;
road on which they were traveling. In the lane, four&#xD;
mounted men, in Federal uniform, leading three&#xD;
&#xD;
292&#xD;
&#xD;
4&#xD;
&#xD;
horses, had just turned away from the house, and were&#xD;
approaching the road. The doctor suspected that the&#xD;
led horrses had just been taken from citizens, and per..&#xD;
haps from the farmer who lived there. The prospect&#xD;
of meeting the soldiers was not pleasaxit, but there&#xD;
was no way to avQidA~he1n, as the doctor concluded,&#xD;
and he resolved to advance without any appearance&#xD;
of distrust. He slipped, however, one of his pistoI~&#xD;
into the- hands of ~Jaleb, with an injunction not to&#xD;
show it, nor to use it, until ordered to do so by&#xD;
his master. Julia begged ~her uncle to make no&#xD;
resistance, whatever i~ight happen. He assured&#xD;
her that it was his' prirpose to avoid a collision if&#xD;
possible.&#xD;
When the Virginians were nearly opposiW to the&#xD;
mouth of the lane, the Federal soldiers came out of it&#xD;
and met them on the road. The doctor saluted the&#xD;
strangers vourteously, and would have passed on.&#xD;
But a non-comm~s~ioned 'officer, who appeared to be&#xD;
the leader of the party, ordered him to halt. The or-&#xD;
der was obeyed, of course, a~d he who had given it,&#xD;
after looking at the horses, and fixing his attenti~&#xD;
particularly on Arab, said:&#xD;
"Them's good horses you're riding."&#xD;
"They are tolerable nags," the doctor adiuitted.~&#xD;
"We're looking for sich horses, we are."&#xD;
We do not wish to sell 'ours~'&#xD;
"Good; we don't want to buy."&#xD;
"I believe we are not likely to agree upon an ex-&#xD;
change, either."&#xD;
"You'r~~a comical old cock. Do you take. us for&#xD;

Come, Cuffee, take her saddle and put it on the sorrel.&#xD;
We'll just take your horse, and the old man's ~a&amp;amp;dles&#xD;
and all."&#xD;
While he was speaking, he dismounted, and ap-&#xD;
proached Julia. She said to him in her softest tones;&#xD;
"I am sure, sir, if you knew how I prize this horse&#xD;
and for what a holy purpose I need him now, you&#xD;
would npt take him from me."&#xD;
"Wouldn't I, though? Come, get down without&#xD;
any more palaver."&#xD;
He seized her by the arm and pulled her so roughly&#xD;
downward that she ~was glad to leap to the ground.&#xD;
He then lifted her veil and said:&#xD;
"By...-.--. that's a pretty secesh face. I must have&#xD;
a kiss;"&#xD;
He seemed about to suit the action to the word,&#xD;
when the crack of a pistol was. heard and he fell deai~&#xD;
Doctor Fairfax had prevented the insult.&#xD;
Instantly a fight ensued, which was so sudden,&#xD;
rapid and brief, that Julia could distinguish nothing&#xD;
but the firing of revolvers until it was over. She was&#xD;
near being trampled upon by the horses in the affi'ay,&#xD;
but she was below the range of the shots. In a min-&#xD;
ute the firing ceased. Two of the Federals lay dead&#xD;
on the ground; the other two wore flying and appar-&#xD;
ently wounded. Caleb was down, bleeding freely.&#xD;
Three barrels oPhis pistol were empty. DoctorFair-&#xD;
fax sat on his horse, looking at the t~Mo retreating sob&#xD;
diers. Presently he said;&#xD;
"Julia, they have quieted old Dick," and he began&#xD;
to sink upon the horse's neck. She ran to him, and&#xD;
supported him while he slipped to the ground.&#xD;
"Where are you hurt, Uncle Dick ?" she ,asked, in&#xD;
great alarm.&#xD;

When the breath is out, you must leave me and save&#xD;

years. Poor old Virginia, she was drawn into this&#xD;

with difficulty, and falling at last from his ambitious&#xD;

CHAPTER XXVIII.&#xD;
~IUQH PITZHUQ)L&#xD;
WHEN Alb~rt Palmer, abruptly abandoning his pur..&#xD;
suit of Miss Fairfax, turned to fly from the five or six&#xD;
Confederates who had met her, he was. mounted on a&#xD;
fleeter horse than any of theirs, and not sparing the&#xD;
weary animal, he left them at some distance. Ho&#xD;
would probably have escaped if his horse had not&#xD;
fallen in descending a hill. By ihe fall ouie of the&#xD;
rider's legs was broken, and being unable to move, he&#xD;
was .aptured. He was carried by his captor~ into the&#xD;
yard of a house which stood near the road, and there&#xD;
laid on the grass, while th~ Confederates, giving up&#xD;
th~ pursuit of his comrades, who had scattered them..&#xD;
selves over the country, waited for the regiment to&#xD;
come up.&#xD;
Colonel Fitzhngh, after ]eavin~ Julia with her uncle&#xD;
at the spring; ha~tened forward. She had told him&#xD;
that some of his men were in pursuit of Palmer, and&#xD;
he had heard enough of that gentleman's recent con-&#xD;
duct to fill him with anger.. Anticipating the capture&#xD;
of the fugitives as possible, if not probable, he medi-&#xD;
tated the punishment that was due to such~ a villain.&#xD;
His fury being the counsellor of hi~ judgment, be vas&#xD;
ready to condemn the culprit to extreme torture of&#xD;
any kind that imagination could conceive. In his&#xD;
anger he dashed the spurs into his horse, as if no&#xD;
speed was s'~ift enough for his revenge. Whether&#xD;
his tempestuous thought turned to the perils through&#xD;

which Julia had passed, 6r to those which he was&#xD;
about to encounter, or to the sufferings of her father,&#xD;
or to the atrocities recently perpetrated against others,&#xD;
or to the past career of Palmer, he became more and&#xD;
more enraged. In this vindictive mood he dashed on&#xD;
to the head of his regiment.&#xD;
He was amazed at the scene which he then witnessed,&#xD;
and it recalled- his mind, to the duties of an officer.&#xD;
That portion of the command whic~had arrived at&#xD;
the place where Albert Palmer lay, w~ in the utmost&#xD;
confusion and disorderly excitement. T~ie report which&#xD;
Marlin and Baxter had brought of his conduct had&#xD;
been circulated among the men, and, as usual in such&#xD;
eases, it had~ gathered additions as it was repeated. It&#xD;
inflamed the minds of the soldiers to the highest pitch&#xD;
of resentment against one whom they regarded as a&#xD;
fiend. The foremost of them, seeing him in the yard,&#xD;
gave way to the impulses of passion. X~eaving the&#xD;
ranks and disrnountir~g, they hurried into the yard&#xD;
with threatening cries and gesture~s. Others followed.&#xD;
Forty or fifty men entered the enclosure. Shoot him&#xD;
-he's a deserter-he's a trator-he's a murderer-he&#xD;
tried to kill Miss Fairfax-he hung her to a bed-post&#xD;
-Mark Marlin had tQ cut her down-hang him-.&#xD;
such were the cries that expressed their purpose or&#xD;
their passion. Some 6f them who were near the&#xD;
prisoner tried to seize him, but were delayed by two&#xD;
or three officers. A few of the men cried, don't mur-&#xD;
der him-wait till the colonel comes-let the colonel&#xD;
deal with him. But the increase of the crowd brought&#xD;
ai~i increase of excitement. The uproar of threats&#xD;
silenced t~e the feeble voice of remonstrancee. Every&#xD;
moment it appeared certain that the maddened mob&#xD;
would obtain possessionof Palmer and execute instant&#xD;
revenge.&#xD;
&#xD;

When Colonel Fit~hugh camel upon this spectacle&#xD;
of tumult he asked what was the matter. A soldier&#xD;
replied, "they've got Pahpei' in there."&#xD;
"What is he doing?"&#xD;
"Lying on the grass. They say he's wounded."&#xD;
"What are the men doing ?"&#xD;
"They are going so hang him."&#xD;
"Murder a prisoner 1"&#xD;
The violence of others struck him in its true light,&#xD;
and restored his reason to the mastery over his~ pas-&#xD;
sions. He leaped from hi'~ horse and into the yard.&#xD;
Pressing forward among the men, he called to them,&#xD;
in a voice of authority that rang above the uproar, Aot&#xD;
to murder a prisoner, but to return~to the ranks.&#xD;
Th~e who recognized him gave way for him to pass.&#xD;
Others, too intent on mischief to see their colonel or&#xD;
hear his voice, were thrust aside. In a mome~it he&#xD;
was beside Palmer, and looking round upon the&#xD;
enraged soldiers, sternly commanded them to fall&#xD;
back. They yielded with ~ sullen murmur to his&#xD;
ascendancy, and slowly retired. He rebuked them for&#xD;
the -crime which they had meditated, and ordered&#xD;
them to return to their places. Palmer implored him&#xD;
not to let ~he men assassinate him, but he made no&#xD;
reply to this supplication until the yard was cleared of&#xD;
soldiers. Then, casting his eyes upon the prisoner, he&#xD;
merely said, "you are safe now." He had Palmer&#xD;
carried into the house, and placed a guard around&#xD;
it, under 'an officer on whose firmness he could i~ely;&#xD;
commanding him to remain until the regimQnt had&#xD;
passed and to follow it, taking care that no men were&#xD;
left behind. He then informed Palmer that he was.&#xD;
to be left there at liberty, and required him to give   J&#xD;
the ordinary parole of a prisoner of war. When this J&#xD;

V&#xD;
matter had been arranged, the prisoner began to ex-&#xD;
press gratitude, but the colonel abruptly left him and&#xD;
hastened to the regiment, which, was again in motion.&#xD;
Some of the men,, as he passed by them, muttered,&#xD;
"this was not the way the Yanks treated Colonel&#xD;
Fred." He chose to be deaf to such comments. His&#xD;
own passions, which had been so suddenly quelled,&#xD;
began to rebel again, and he had to ride some distance&#xD;
before he, felt perfectly master of himself. He then&#xD;
took occasion to speak to his men in words of grave&#xD;
reproof, and of the dishonor which some of them had&#xD;
almost brought up~n the regiment. He assured them&#xD;
th~t in a little while he would conduct them to a fai,&#xD;
more honorable revenge, and that the crimes of their&#xD;
enemies should not go unpunished. He informed&#xD;
them that they had a long march before them for that&#xD;
day and coming night, &amp;amp;nd he relied on their pa~ieiice,&#xD;
discipline and courage~for the success of an important;.&#xD;
enterprise.&#xD;
When Coloael Fitzhugh was returning, successful,&#xD;
from his expedition, iind had heard of the outrages&#xD;
which had been committed in the county of his resi~&#xD;
dence, he resolved to strike a blow, if possible, which&#xD;
might restrain1 such inhuman excesses of military vio.&#xD;
lence for the future. The information obtained by&#xD;
Baxter encouraged him to believe that it .w~s praetica.&#xD;
ble, t~nd his interview with Julia did not tend to relax&#xD;
his resolution. He was hastening on with a hope of&#xD;
surprising the Federals at the village. After leaving&#xD;
Palmer he cQntrnued. the march until a late hour of the&#xD;
nigJ~ when he wa~ within three or four miles of the&#xD;
village. The regiment was then halted for a brief rest,&#xD;
but, an hour before daybreak, the men were again in&#xD;
their saddles. The colouel ~he~i ~d4ressed them;&#xD;
&#xD;
ROEBUCK.      801&#xD;
&#xD;
"Soldiers! Virginians! You are about to attack&#xD;
the enemy--not soldiers but malefactors. They hai~e&#xD;
perpetrated their crimes at your own ~homes. They&#xD;
have desecrated your own altars. They 'have burned&#xD;
your own dwellings. They have robbed and insulted&#xD;
your own families. They have made war on women&#xD;
and children. They have defiled virgins. As you are&#xD;
men, redress the injuries of women-of your families&#xD;
and friends. Scourge these felons. Here' revenge is&#xD;
justice. In such a cause your ~abres are sacred.&#xD;
Count no odds against you, when Heaven must bless&#xD;
your valor. The enemy is a thousand; you are five&#xD;
hundred; you are enough. Let the word be Eliza&#xD;
Marlin. Follow me."&#xD;
There was no shout in response to this address.&#xD;
The clenched teeth would not open for cheers. There&#xD;
was an inarticulate murmur. There was a low, c~ntin-&#xD;
uous clash of iron, as every man felt his sabre or his&#xD;
carbine. Then, in stern silence, the little column&#xD;
'moved off&#xD;
The force at the village numbered somewhat above&#xD;
- a thousand men~-a regiment of infantry about seven&#xD;
hundred strong, and about three or four hundred cav~&#xD;
alry. License had destroyed the discipline and im..&#xD;
paired the vigilance of the entire force.&#xD;
Availing himself of his local knowledge and of the~&#xD;
information which he had recently received, Colonel&#xD;
Fitzhugh led his regiment,. undiscovered, to a point&#xD;
near the village, and' .then dashed into the centre of&#xD;
the Federal encampment before any signal of his&#xD;
approach was given. Officers and soldiers, suddenly&#xD;
aroused from sl~ep, ran from 1~heir tents to be cut&#xD;
down or trampled under foot, or to, flee from the mer-&#xD;
ciless sl4bres. On one side confusion and dismay-..~on&#xD;

302              ROEBUCK.&#xD;
the other shouts, ~strokes, wrath, triumph. Pistols were&#xD;
fired on every hand-a few muskets or rifles replied.&#xD;
Darkness added to the horror of the scene. But&#xD;
friends, and foes knew that the careering horsemen&#xD;
were Confederates and the fkigitives on foot were&#xD;
Federal. Here a~nd there a few Federals attempted.&#xD;
to stand, but they could stand only to be slaughtered.&#xD;
An enemy who had seen Mark Marlin there that&#xD;
morning would have denounced.the heart-broken boy&#xD;
as an unsparing savage. He and his had not been&#xD;
spared. All through that camp the name of 14s. sister&#xD;
was muttered by men who were saved from horrid&#xD;
deeds, perhaps , by~ the rapid dispersion of the enemy.&#xD;
They -were men.&#xD;
The Federal cavalry, finding that the infantry had&#xD;
been scattered, took to flight without an effort at de-&#xD;
fence. Some mounted horses without saddles or bri-&#xD;
dles and galloped away. Others on foot scampered&#xD;
across the adjacent fields. In a few minutes it appeared&#xD;
to the assailants that, of the whole Federal force, non~&#xD;
remained near the village but the few who were killed&#xD;
or severely wounded. But it was not so. Colonel&#xD;
Wesel, whatever else he may have been, was a man of&#xD;
cour~i~/Phough suddenly awakened by an enemy&#xD;
in the midst of his camp, he did not lose his presence&#xD;
of mind. He soon discovered the real state of affairs,&#xD;
and thought only of retrieving the disaster. Using&#xD;
tIe opportunities of darkness and confusion, he cok~&#xD;
elected a few men, and with them he threw himself into,&#xD;
a house at one end of the village. There lie deter-&#xD;
mined to make a stand while he sent some of his ~flk&#xD;
cers to rally- his flying troops, and a courier to the&#xD;
nearest Federal post for succor. He did not believe&#xD;
that the assailants were numerous or that they would&#xD;
&#xD;
ROEBUCK.      803&#xD;
&#xD;
venture to- remain long at the village. He hoped that&#xD;
a sturdy show of resistance might even cause them to&#xD;
retire as suddenly as they came.&#xD;
As soon as Colonel. Fitzhngh discovered that the&#xD;
house was thns occupied, he divined the objects of the&#xD;
Federal officer, and saw the necessity of dislodging&#xD;
him at Qflce, and of preventing the fugitives from being&#xD;
rallied. He knew that it was impossible for him to&#xD;
hold th&amp;amp; village very long under any circumstances,&#xD;
and that if any part of it could be held by the enemy&#xD;
until reinforcement~ or considerations of prudence&#xD;
should compel him to retire, the effect of his present&#xD;
success would be neutralized. He sent a considerable&#xD;
part of the regiment to pursue the fugitives for a time,&#xD;
and then prepared to assault the house occupied by&#xD;
Colonel Wesel. When the party organize&amp;amp; for the&#xD;
purpose was ready to make the assault the day was&#xD;
breaking.&#xD;
The assailants rushed towards the house, intending&#xD;
to enter throj~igh the- windows. When they were&#xD;
within a few yards of it a well-directed volley brought&#xD;
several of them to the earth. Mark Marlin, springing&#xD;
forward, seized the ledge of a window which was&#xD;
rather above his head, and drawing -himself up, broke&#xD;
in the sash with the hilt of his sword. He climbed&#xD;
up to the window, and had almost entered, when he&#xD;
received a shot, and tell heavily back to the ground.&#xD;
The men behind him, and those directed to other ~n-&#xD;
dews, still pressed on. But the defence was- so steady&#xD;
and effective that it was soon found necessary to recall&#xD;
them, and the assault failed.&#xD;
Colonel Fitzhugh, still deeming it necessary to dis-&#xD;
lodge the Federal colonel as soon as possible, made&#xD;
instant preparation for another attack. He placed.&#xD;

&#xD;
himself at the head of a number of men deemed sufib&#xD;
dent for the purpose. Having procured a ladder, he&#xD;
led them, under cover of buildings, to a spot about&#xD;
fifty yards from the house occupied by the enemy.&#xD;
Then, while a false attack was made on another side,&#xD;
he rushed forward. His foremost men, carrying the&#xD;
ladder. horizontally between them, swung it, as a ram,&#xD;
against the door, until they broke it, but not without,&#xD;
two or three of them l4~ing woundN .As soon as an&#xD;
opening was thus.. made, wide enough for a man to&#xD;
pass, Colonel Fitzhugh dashed in, followed by his.&#xD;
men. Within the house there was a fierce fight, hand.&#xD;
to-han4. It could not last long. Colonel Wesel and&#xD;
several of his men were killed. The rest surrendered.&#xD;
The victory was complete, but it was purchased&#xD;
with some precious blood. Besides other losses, Obb&#xD;
onel Fitzhugh was dangerously wounded. He was&#xD;
carried from the house, bleeding profuselyy. Calling&#xD;
the lieutenant-~olonel of his regiment to him, he cx~&#xD;
pressed the.belief that his wound was mortal," he eora~&#xD;
mended the gallantry of his men, and gave directions&#xD;
for the burial of the dead, the care of the wounded,&#xD;
the removal of captured horses and guns, an&amp;amp; the&#xD;
withdrawal of hi~command from the village. Finally,&#xD;
he requested that, whatever might be his own con.&#xD;
edition, he might not be left behind. Although these&#xD;
directions were given with coolness and clearness,&#xD;
they were~ scarcely completed when he became insen~&#xD;
sible. Afterwards he revived; he was almost lifeless&#xD;
when, in the afternoon, he was carried from the&#xD;
village.&#xD;
The dead body of Mark Marlin ~vas lifted from the&#xD;
earth and~ borne with tender respect by his comrades&#xD;
to the cabin of his ~'ather, who sat on his desolate&#xD;
~        hearth beside his wife; and she was a maniac.&#xD;

When Mrs. Fitzhugh heard of the condition of her&#xD;
son she followed the regiment, and taking charge of&#xD;
him, ~he had him carried, from time to time, by short&#xD;
stages to an interior county. There she took ~ cottage,&#xD;
and attended only by her faithful Belle, devoted her~&#xD;

CHAPTER XXIX.&#xD;

WASINGTON.&#xD;
&#xD;
W~ left Julia Fairfax seated in a highway, holding in&#xD;
her lap the head of her deceased uncle. Near her lay&#xD;
his bleeding servant, and the corpses of two Federal&#xD;
soldiers. Beside her stood Mr. IItirt~ Notwithstand~&#xD;
ing the dangers which he and his family might incur&#xD;
if he should afford assistance to those who had pro..&#xD;
yoked the vengeance of soldiery in possession of the&#xD;
country, he was prompt to acknowledge t1~e duties of&#xD;
humanity to a woman in affliction, and to the dead&#xD;
and wounded. He addressed her in words of sym~&#xD;
pathy, and offered her the shelter of his house, and&#xD;
whatever aid he could render. Her delicate frame&#xD;
might have sunk under the load of calamity that had&#xD;
befallen her; but, if she was a woman in the weakness&#xD;
of passion, she could be a woman in the heroism of&#xD;
duty. A sacred duty was still before her. A gush&#xD;
of tears discharged the riatural tribute of affection and&#xD;
grief. Then she rapidly reviewed the circumstances&#xD;
by which she was surrounded, and concluded that it&#xD;
was necessary for her to act promptly according to the&#xD;
advice of her dying uncle. She thanked IMIr. hart for&#xD;
his kind offer of assistance. She explained to him&#xD;
briefly that she was obliged to prosecute her journey&#xD;
without delay. She begged him to .take charge of her&#xD;
uncle's body, and of the wounded Caleb. That faith-.&#xD;
- ful servant assured them that he would not trouble any&#xD;
one long in, this world. When Mr. Hurt had con-.&#xD;

sented to fulfil all the wishes which she expressed,&#xD;
and she had seen Caleb laid on a bed in the horse,&#xD;
she took leave of him with many tears, and, after kiss~&#xD;
ing the lifeless lips of her dear uncle, she bade fare~&#xD;
well to Mr. Hart.&#xD;
Sh6 went into the wood to wait for the niore se&#xD;
cure shelter of night. Concealing herself ma ravine,&#xD;
she tied her horse by the bridle to a limb, and sat&#xD;
down upon the grass, leaning against the trunk of a&#xD;
tree. There she remained alone several hours. The&#xD;
sun went down, and the retreating shadows at length&#xD;
sf~ole away upon the approach of night, like faithless&#xD;
friends at the coming of misfortune. Darkness made&#xD;
her solitude more dismal. Hooting owls, and wailing&#xD;
whip-poor-wills, broke, with melancholy voices, the&#xD;
solemn silence of the forest and of night. Her clear&#xD;
sense and natural courage usually saved Julia from&#xD;
imaginary terrors. But her heart, already sorrowful&#xD;
and fearful; felt the depressing influence of the scene.&#xD;
She turned her sleepless arid tearful eyes to Heaven,&#xD;
and prayed to the friend of the friendless, who sees at&#xD;
midnight as at noonday. It was midnight when she&#xD;
found courage to venture upon the highway. The&#xD;
night was friendly to her, and, by riding rapidly, she&#xD;
left this dangerous neighborhood far behind her be-&#xD;
fore the dawn.&#xD;
Afterwards, traveling much at night, she continued&#xD;
her Journey through many difficulties and alarms, but&#xD;
without any~ adventure that ought to detain the reader&#xD;
from more important events, until she arrived within&#xD;
ten miles of Washington city. Then,, as she was&#xD;
riding along a public roud in the forenoon, she saw&#xD;
before her a party of Federal cavalry appvoaching ~t&#xD;
a brisk trot.  126 avoid meeting them, she twned he~'&#xD;

horse and rode back, intending to enter a lane which&#xD;
she had passed, and to wait there until 'the cavalry&#xD;
should go by. When Bhe was about to enter the lane,&#xD;
she heard from behind her the word "halt" In-&#xD;
tending to halt as soon as she turned out of the road,&#xD;
to avoid collision, she went on. She ~had scarcely&#xD;
turned into the lane,~~nd drawn her rei,~n, when a shot&#xD;
was fired, and the bullet struck her horse. He made&#xD;
one bound and then fell. Quivering with momentary&#xD;
agony, he died. The cavalry rode on. - One voice&#xD;
exclaimed-" I guess you'll halt ,time," adding&#xD;
some words of profane rilaldi7. Julia stood by her&#xD;
horse, not injured by *his fall, but ~vercome with a&#xD;
sense of utter desolatAoiL "Poor Arab," sh~ mur-&#xD;
inured, "brave, gentle, faithful Arab, will they let&#xD;
nothing live that! love?"&#xD;
She sat down for a 'few minutes, weeping. But a&#xD;
thought of her father recalled her to the hard path of&#xD;
duty still before her. She rose, and with a lingering&#xD;
look of regret at the bodj of her last companion, set&#xD;
out alone and afoot towards the city. She was not&#xD;
much accustomed to walking, and she had not -trav-&#xD;
eled five miles over the. hard road when she became&#xD;
very weary, and her feet' began to feel sore. Still she&#xD;
walked on, slowly, indeed, and with- frequent pauses,&#xD;
but with perseverance. The sun was setting when&#xD;
she found herself within the suburbs of Washington.&#xD;
She stopped~to rest,. and to consi4kr what was next to&#xD;
be done. She did not know that she had a single&#xD;
friend or acquaintance in the city, except her father.&#xD;
Regarding 'her soiled garments and, ~retclied plight,&#xD;
'she feared that her appearance would excite the sus-&#xD;
picion of strangers. She imagined that- not only&#xD;
the public offices but the streets were thronged' with&#xD;
&#xD;
avowed enemies of Virginia who, she inferred.,&#xD;
would be her enemies if she should make herself&#xD;
known. She thought that in her dusty garb, if she&#xD;
entered a respectable hotel, she would be rejected as&#xD;
a guest, and perhaps expelled with~ insult. Her pro-&#xD;
sent perplexities, more than all the perils of her jour~-&#xD;
ney, made 'her plan for obtaining the release of her&#xD;
father appear to herself impracticable. Still uncer-&#xD;
tain what to do, she started in the dusk of evening,&#xD;
and walked into the city. She went along Penusyb:.&#xD;
vania Avenue, that wide and cheer1e~s thoroughfare.&#xD;
Hundreds of persons met her or passed by her. She&#xD;
did not dare to put aside her veil, or to lift her eyes&#xD;
to their faces. She felt that they were 'all strangers.&#xD;
She imagined that they looked at her with suspicion&#xD;
or enmity~ More and more disheartened, more and&#xD;
more uncertain what to do, she still walked on. At&#xD;
length, in passing a come; she looked: into a oro~s&#xD;
street, thinking that perhaps it might be better for&#xD;
her to turn into it, and so 'avoid the multitude who&#xD;
throi~ged the side-walk of the great Aventt~. By the&#xD;
light of a lamp she saw a negro man sitting on the&#xD;
curb-stone not far from her. Stepping aside into the&#xD;
cross street, where she could see him more distinctly,&#xD;
she looked at him a moment, and then said, in a-loW&#xD;
voice-.---" Dave." lie starte~1 and looked at her. She&#xD;
raised her veil, and by the lamplight he saw her fea-&#xD;
tures. "Miss Julia," he cried, "'fore God, it's Miss&#xD;
Julia." He seized her han4, which she held out to&#xD;
him. He kissed it. He shed tears upon it Then,&#xD;
with true African volubility and incoherence, he&#xD;
poured forth a torrent of mixed and incongruous&#xD;
emotions. Julia tried to check demonstrations which&#xD;
~began to. attract ~the attention of passengers. She'&#xD;

asked Dainty Dave how he was living in Washing-&#xD;
ton. This was asking a renewal of his sorrows, and&#xD;
the ~floodgates of complaint broke loose. It appeared&#xD;
that from the time he left Roebuck-and he was&#xD;
among the first to desert-until that moment, his ex~&#xD;
perience had been bitter. "0 de fools, de fools us&#xD;
Diggers is~'-was his own comment at several stages&#xD;
of his story. "L's niis'able, Miss Julia, I~ starvin', I&#xD;
aiat got no place to sleep dis night, but dis 'ere pave-&#xD;
ment"         -&#xD;
"Why did you leave us, Dave'?" she asked in a&#xD;
compassionate voice.&#xD;
"'Case I was a fool, like de other niggers. Master&#xD;
piled me, I reckon. He was too good to dis 'ere nig~&#xD;
ger. I thought I was a gwine to be free when I&#xD;

"Poor creatures! What can I do to relieve them!&#xD;
Thit why do I ask? I do not know where to lay my&#xD;
own head to-night '?"&#xD;
"What you (say, Miss Julia ?" Dainty Dave ox-&#xD;
claimed, in astdnishrn~nt, for his ~ttentiom was now,&#xD;
for the first time, turned from his own misery to&#xD;
the condition of his young mistress. "You don't&#xD;
know whar to go ?"&#xD;
"No, Dave, I 'a~n alone, and~stranger in the city.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
I have jnst arrived, and I am not willing to go to&#xD;

woman in all this great town.'~&#xD;
"Why, whar's your cousin Clara, den? She lives&#xD;
here."&#xD;
"Cousin Glara?"&#xD;
"Mrs. West, you know."&#xD;
Julia - then remembered that the lady whom. he&#xD;
named, a distant relative of her father, had once&#xD;
visited Roebuck. It was when Julia was a child, and&#xD;
she had almost forgotten the lady. She had quite for-&#xD;
gotten that she livedin Washington. But Dave, who&#xD;
was older than his young mistress, remembered the&#xD;
visit of Cousin Clara very well. She had importance&#xD;
in his eyes, not because she came to the country from&#xD;
the capital, but because she was ~kin to de Fair-&#xD;
faxes." Recently he had been inquiring about her,&#xD;
with some intention of claiming kin to keep himself&#xD;
from starving~ Shame ~ad hitherto held him off from&#xD;
her house, but he Nknew where it stood, and had&#xD;
walked by it more than once with longing eyes.&#xD;
When Julia recollected her distant cousin, ana con-&#xD;
sidered that Mrs. West was the only person in the&#xD;
city upon whom she had the slightest claim, she ac-&#xD;
cepted Dave's offer to conduct her to the lady's house.&#xD;
They walked on together, Dave keeping his\ proper&#xD;
place as a servaia, but near enough to her for konver-&#xD;
sation. lie chattered away continually. But little of&#xD;
his diat is worth recording.&#xD;
"No, Miss Julia, freedom ain't for niggers. Dey&#xD;
can't git de hang ofit, and it don't do 'em no good.&#xD;
Free niggers ain't got no friends. Do rule friends of&#xD;
do niggers is de good masters and mistresses what&#xD;

While his tongue was running on, they arrived at&#xD;
Mrs. West's house. Julia then divided with Dave&#xD;
her remnant of cash, and telling him to provide for&#xD;
himself that night, and come to see her the next day,&#xD;
she dismissed him. When she entered the house,&#xD;
and made herself kiiown, she was received by Mrs.&#xD;
West with affectionate welcome. The kind lady had&#xD;
a pleasant remembrance of Roebuck, and esteen~ed&#xD;
"Cousin Fred." as he deserved. She had a bright,&#xD;
busy, talkative and cordial manner. With hospitality,&#xD;
she possessed intelligence and tact. Unlike those&#xD;
hosts who bid you make yourself at home, and then&#xD;
leave you to shift tbr yourself most helplessly in a&#xD;
strange house, she could make a guest feel at homer&#xD;
She had heard nothing of Colonel Fairfax's imprison-&#xD;
ment, but when Julia told her all her painful story,&#xD;
she manifested such sympathy and such a warm de-&#xD;
sire to befriend Cousin Fred., she suggested so many&#xD;
plausible expedients for obtaining his discharge, and&#xD;
she offered her assistance with so much apparent hope&#xD;
of success, that to Julia's eager fancy the prison doors&#xD;
seemed already to turn on their hinges for her father's&#xD;
release. Grateful and hopeful , she laid her head upon&#xD;
her pillow to dream of her father's happy restoration&#xD;
to his family.&#xD;
&#xD;
The next mc~rning she was up ea$y, impatient for&#xD;
the hour wheti, accompanied' by Mrs. West, she was&#xD;
to start in search of l~r Lather. They were te take&#xD;
the round of many prisons, and, without a clue, to&#xD;
took for him among an immense number of prisoners&#xD;
then confined in the city. He had been there so short&#xD;
a time, and was so completely unknown to all those&#xD;
who had ~harge of the prisons, that they could scarcely&#xD;
expect to find him until they should happen upon the&#xD;
very room in which he ivas confined. After break-&#xD;
fast, they sallied forth upon their quest. Although&#xD;
they traversed the magnificent distances of the city&#xD;
in a carriages they had walking enough in visiting the&#xD;
various places at which they called, With climbing&#xD;
stairs, and standing, while they awaited the leisuize of'&#xD;
those to whom they made application, to fatigue even&#xD;
the active Mrs. West. Many persons of whom they&#xD;
inquired, knew nothing of Colonel Fairfax; others&#xD;
declined to answer any questions. By some they&#xD;
Were treated with politeness, and by others rudely re-&#xD;
buffed. They were very weary and Julia was much&#xD;
disheartened, when, late in the day, they were told&#xD;
that a prisoner from Virginia, answering to the de-&#xD;
scription which they gave of Colonel F'airfax, was con-&#xD;
fined in a room before which they wei'e then stand~&#xD;
ing. But it was too late to obtain admittance to the&#xD;
prisoners that day; the person who had the custody&#xD;
of Colonel Fairfax was not present; nothing niore&#xD;
could be learned by Julia about her father, ~not even&#xD;
about his health. ~She went away, feeling disappoint-&#xD;
Inent and anxiety almost as painful as if she had not&#xD;
discovered the place &amp;amp;f his imprisonment.&#xD;
The next day the ladies returned. The custodian&#xD;
of Colonel Fairfax then informed them that they&#xD;

&#xD;
could not be admI~tted to' see him without a special or-&#xD;
der from higher authority. As to the prisoner's&#xD;
health, he' did not know much, except that "he*&#xD;
seemed to' be pretty bad," but 'he referred them to the&#xD;
surgeOn. Inquiring where the 'surgeon was to be&#xD;
found, and receiving a very vague direction, they&#xD;
started in search of that officer. Besides the anxiety&#xD;
of Julia to ascertain her father's true condition ~after&#xD;
receiving the uncertain hut alarming information&#xD;
which she had ju~t heai~d, Mrs. West suggested&#xD;
'a certificate fi~om the surgeon might promote the suc-&#xD;
c~ss of their application to be admitted into the pri~on.&#xD;
But it was several hours before they found the surgeon.&#xD;
*    He replied to their inquiries with civility, and when&#xD;
he knew that Julia was the daughter of the prisoner,&#xD;
he looked at her with compassion, for he was a man&#xD;
of gi'eat benevolence. In tenderness to hemp he soft-&#xD;
ened the report which he gave of her father's condi-&#xD;
tion as much as truth permitted, and he soothed her&#xD;
with general expressions of hope. But, by the use of&#xD;
a little dexterity, he contrived to inform Mrs. West,&#xD;
aside, that Colonel Fairfax could not live many. days,.&#xD;
if he remained in prison. At her request, he slipped&#xD;
into her hand' a 'certificate to that effect. 'This was an&#xD;
artifice of~ kindness to' save the daughter from dis-&#xD;
tress which, a~ they feared, might overcome her, but&#xD;
Mrs. West afterwards discovered that Julia had in-&#xD;
ferred from the cautious conversation of the surgeon&#xD;
the actual danger to her father's life. Reserve could&#xD;
no longer be useful, and the certificate was shown&#xD;
to her soon after they parted with the surgeon. They&#xD;
then endeavored to procure the necessary oi'der for&#xD;
admittance into the prison, but official hours were&#xD;
over, and another day closed with disappointment.&#xD;
&#xD;
Such delays would have been painful under any oh'-&#xD;
cnmstances, but, with the knowledge which they&#xD;
had acquired, Julia spent the following nigh~Nn an-&#xD;
guish.&#xD;
Wearisome to the ladies, and worse than wearisome&#xD;
to the prisoner's daughter, were the next few days;&#xD;
for so long was it before Julia obtained permission&#xD;
to see hei father. Those who have had experience&#xD;
iwpr~ssing an application, however trivial and unob-&#xD;
jectionable, though official routine, can understand&#xD;
how a whole day may be spent without any progress&#xD;
in such affairs. When the applicants were' women,&#xD;
seeking favor for a rebel from the servants of the of-&#xD;
fended government, it may be imagined that delay~&#xD;
and obstacles were multiplied. But Mrs. West was&#xD;
hever disheartened. She 'had been ~through such&#xD;
trials of patience before. She was one of those women&#xD;
who habitually assuaged the miseries of the war by&#xD;
charities to the unfortunate. To relieve them, she had&#xD;
passed through scenes which were often 'repulsive,&#xD;
and sometimes revolting to a lady. 'With officials, her&#xD;
gentle importunity, now pathetic and then laughing,&#xD;
would not be denied. Besides, she had acquired&#xD;
much knowledge of the secret springs of influence at&#xD;
'Washington. Finally, with the use of the surgeon'8&#xD;
certificate, and of her own energy and adroitne~s, she&#xD;
succeeded in procuring, not only permission 'for Julia&#xD;
to Visit her father in prison, but an order for his dis-&#xD;
charge. Tie was to be set free, however, only upon&#xD;
condition that he would first take an oath of allegiance&#xD;
to the Federal. government in a prescribed form.&#xD;

CHAPTER XXX.&#xD;
P~II~DEUICK FAIT~FAX.&#xD;
JuuA went to the prison. Her step had lost the&#xD;
elastic lightness of youth, health and happiness. She&#xD;
Walked with The nervous celerity of painful excite-,&#xD;
ment. The bloom had faded from her cheeks. Above&#xD;
their pallor, her eyes gleamed with unnatural' lustre.&#xD;
In her fluttering pulse, suffering and heart-sickness&#xD;
had extinguished the energy of hope and high re~&#xD;
solve. But despair was still kept at bay by the ex~&#xD;
pectation of seeing her father, and relieving him by&#xD;
filial ministrations.&#xD;
She I~ound him in a small room-a mere cell. It&#xD;
was gloomy, having only one window, a little grated&#xD;
opening. He lay on the floor, with no bed, but some&#xD;
wisps of dirty, broken~ straw. The close, corrupted&#xD;
air almost stifled Julia as she entered. The cell con-&#xD;
tained several prisoners besides her father. They&#xD;
might have been long there, for their faces had the&#xD;
dead whiteness and sullen indifference which come of&#xD;
long imprisonment. They let the spider weave his&#xD;
web over their' narrow window without raising a hand&#xD;
to brush it away. Colonel Fairfax was looking round&#xD;
upon them, and, as Julia entered the door, she . heard&#xD;
him faintly utter the words "poor fellows 1" When,&#xD;
by the dusky light, admitted through dirty panes, she&#xD;
saw' him lying on the floor, none but a daughter&#xD;
would have recognized hi~ form and features. his.&#xD;
woundj~is frightfQl journey to the Federal capital,&#xD;
&#xD;
imprisonment, suffering, gi'ief had. conquered his&#xD;
manly frame. His eyes were sunken; his cheeks&#xD;
were hollow and haggard;, his beard was long and&#xD;
white; his grey hair was matted, his form was ema~&#xD;
cited and distorted with pain; his. garments were&#xD;
soiled by the filth in Which he lay. In all this squalid&#xD;
wretchedness? nothing could be seen which seemed&#xD;
properly to belong to that no gentleman but the&#xD;
benignity of his countenance as he looked round. ~upon&#xD;
his fellow-prisoners.&#xD;
His daughter hastened to his side, and sobbing,&#xD;
"my father, my father," she knelt down and kissed&#xD;
him again and again. fler tears trickled in showers&#xD;
upon his face., Laying her cheek to his, she wept in&#xD;
speechless agony. "Julia, my sweet child," he whis-&#xD;
pered, "do not give way to despair. God is mer-&#xD;
ciful. We are in his hands." She could:an~wer only&#xD;
with tears. She had come to comfort him, but the&#xD;
first sight of him had dissolved her firmness. She re~&#xD;
covered her voice only to cry out, "0 God! 0 God!&#xD;
can such goodness be doomed to such misery? my&#xD;
father, my father!" His eyes filled~ with tears, and,&#xD;
for a time, he could not speak. At length her parox-&#xD;
ysm of uncontrollable grief was past. She recalled to&#xD;
mind the duty which she had come to discharge. She&#xD;
sat upon the floor; an~ wiped her eyes. Bttt her lip&#xD;
still quivered, and she feared to make an effort to&#xD;
speak, lest her self-control should abandon her again.&#xD;
"Speak to me, my daughter. Tell me of your&#xD;
mother. My beloved wife!",&#xD;
"Yes, papa; she is with, kind friends. Her great&#xD;
trouble is for you."&#xD;
"My wife, my wife, my wife 1".&#xD;
"When she knows that you are-are safe, she will&#xD;
be' comforted.'~&#xD;

"May God comfort her."&#xD;
"When she sees you again she will be happy.."&#xD;
"Ah, me! My unhappy wife !"&#xD;
"We shall be happy yet, papa."&#xD;
"Yes-hereafter," he said, looking upward.&#xD;
"At home, dear papa.&#xD;
Yes, in Heaven."&#xD;
"You must recover your health.. We shall go to&#xD;
mother. Then love will make us 'all happy."&#xD;
"Do not delude yourself, my daughter. We~ must&#xD;
irow~look for happiness beyond this world. My gentle&#xD;
Mary!' My wife, my wife, my wife "&#xD;
"Listen to me, my dear papa. I have an order for.&#xD;
your'ielease from imprisonment."&#xD;
." Can this 'be true, Julia ~ Then 'I may 'live to see&#xD;
'my Mary"&#xD;
He uttered these words with more vigor than he&#xD;
had. displayed since his daughter entered the room.&#xD;
His face was suddenly lighted with flash of joy.' He&#xD;
laid his thin band on Julia's waist, and feebly press-&#xD;
"ing her 'to 'him, 'he kissed. he' fondly. The new-born&#xD;
hope -of freedom and of household endearments was&#xD;
very '~w~et. The calm of resignation, 'which had be.&#xD;
iore succeeded the exthiotiou of hope, was ruined.&#xD;
'For a 'few moment 'he cherished 'his joy in silence.&#xD;
'His imagination 'flew to her whom' be had loved so&#xD;
long, so wisely and 'so well. The image of his daugh-&#xD;
ter went with him to the side of his wife, and his love&#xD;
revelled in ~iomestio bliss~ 4ulia saw this happiness&#xD;
in his face, and she feai~d to 'dash' it by 'an allusion to&#xD;
tho condition upon whieh he was to be released. She&#xD;
was silent until he spoke.&#xD;
"Why, the4 'my 1~rling, ~do we remain here&#xD;
Inig@rt" 'be~whlspered:at last. -&#xD;
&#xD;
"Are you able to go ?" she asked, with compassion-&#xD;
ate evasion.&#xD;
"Yes, yes; let me be carried, away. I must see my&#xD;
wife. I have not long to live. I'm t see may wife&#xD;
once more. Why do you look trouble daua'hter? I&#xD;
can bear the pain of removal. Let us :go."&#xD;
"0, my dear papa, I must tell you. The order is&#xD;
that you xnust take the oath of allegiance to the Fede-&#xD;
ral' government before you will be released."&#xD;
He gazed at her a little while, as if he did not fully&#xD;
comprehend the import of her words. 'Then his eyes&#xD;
closed. His pallid cheeks gradually 'became livid.&#xD;
His lips moved but uttered no sound. His fingers&#xD;
grasped the straw nervously. Julia trembled with&#xD;
alarm. She feared that~The last 'shock 'had killed her&#xD;
father. She almost shrieked; but she held her heart&#xD;
to its terrible task. She was still to sustain 'and com-&#xD;
fort her ~father. Bending over him, she kisses his&#xD;
brow, and whispered, "Papa, speak to me. Speak to&#xD;
your Julia:" He opened his eyes and ihurmured&#xD;
a blessing upon his devoted child. She held. his hand&#xD;
and softly pressed it, but again her emotion was swell-.&#xD;
ing so high that she could not trust 'herself to utter a&#xD;
word. After a long pause, whjch seemed like' death&#xD;
he looked up and said, "I am resigned, Julia. God~s&#xD;
will be done." He relapsed into 'silence, although his&#xD;
lips moved as if he repeated to himself what was pass-&#xD;
ing in his mind.&#xD;
"I cannot, my daughter," at length. he said,&#xD;
"while Virginia remains~ distinct from the Federal&#xD;
government,-4 cannot take that oath. My allegiance&#xD;
i~ due to my 'State. I will not abjure her in ber dire&#xD;
extremity. 'I will 'not betray the' cause of. my fellow&#xD;

them. Let me die for Virginia. I can die, Julia,&#xD;
even thus-my wife-my daughter-even thus I can&#xD;
bear to die, but I cannot take a false oath. Death has&#xD;
power over my. body only; pe~fidy would taint my&#xD;
*   '"They say, papa, that such oaths, when taken under&#xD;
compulsion "-&#xD;
"Tempt me not, my daughter. Tempt not a frail&#xD;
old man. The struggle has( already wrung my heart.&#xD;
It has ni~arly put out this flickering life. I might not&#xD;
be able to resist the persuasion of my beloved, my&#xD;
unhappy da~ighter. 0, spare your father'."&#xD;
His imploring anguish alni~ost bereft her of all con~&#xD;
trol over her passion. He elasped one of her hands&#xD;
between both his own on his breast. She laid her&#xD;
other hand on his forehead. Alternately he lifted his&#xD;
eyes to Heaven in mute stipplication, or fixed them&#xD;
upon the face of his daughter with an expressioti of&#xD;
tender, yearning, unspeakable love.&#xD;
"Be not too much c~ast down by our misfortunes,"&#xD;
he said, when he spoke again, "do not give way to&#xD;
despair; The Lord gave and the Lord hath taken&#xD;
away. Blessed be the name ef the Lord. May he&#xD;
protect you and your mother wheii I am gone." After&#xD;
a brief pause he continued-" do not let your heart be&#xD;
corroded with resentment against our enemies. They&#xD;
are mortals like ourselves, and they are blinded by the&#xD;
passions of war Let us forgive as we hope to be&#xD;
forgiven."&#xD;
Again he lay, apparently. engaged with thoughts&#xD;
which his waning strength did not enable him to&#xD;
utter. It was manifest th~at he was sinking. But he&#xD;
rallied a little and again addressed his daughter:&#xD;
"Julia, I loved the Union. . I would have given my&#xD;
&#xD;
IIOEBUCX.&#xD;
&#xD;
821&#xD;
&#xD;
life to save it. lint it is gone. However this war&#xD;
may end, the Union which I loved is gone forex~r.&#xD;
The free Union of sovereign States can never be re-&#xD;
stored, though the South may be subjugated. If o~ir&#xD;
States should be conquered I trust that the spirit of&#xD;
our people will not be debased. The hope of liberty&#xD;
never dies while the manhood of the people survives.&#xD;
Liberty may be destroyed in one form, like this body,&#xD;
and yet live on like the soul. God grant that the&#xD;
freedom of our country may endure forever."&#xD;
Julia, believing that when her father ceased to&#xD;
speak, his mind was occupied with meditations which&#xD;
she ought ~iot to interrupt, waited in silence for him&#xD;
to speak to her again. But what. she next ~eard was&#xD;
not addressed, to her. He was repeating-&#xD;
"There the wicked cease from troubling, and there&#xD;
the weary be at rest. There the prisoners rest together;&#xD;
they hear not the voice of the oppressor."&#xD;
When he next addressed her it was to ask if she had&#xD;
lately seen Hugh. She replied that she had, and that&#xD;
he wa~ well.&#xD;
"Give him my blessing, Julia~ He is worthy 6f&#xD;
you. You will be a good wife. He wilt be a son to&#xD;
your mother."&#xD;
These words were uttered with extreme difficulty.&#xD;
Afterwards he was silent, but restless. Sometimes the&#xD;
s~igle word "wife" or "daugbter" murmured from&#xD;
his lips.&#xD;
The changes that came over his face foreboded&#xD;
the near approach of the last change of all. Julia&#xD;
saw that the end was at hand. She sat mbtion-&#xD;
less, gazi a' upo:i him and waiting for the dread event.&#xD;
At last a p id calm settled upon his features. His&#xD;
lips moved-' heavenly Father "-though his lips&#xD;

continued to move, no more of the last prayer of. the&#xD;
good man was heard on earth.&#xD;
When Julia saw that he was dead she did not shed&#xD;
a ~tear. She uttered not, a word nor a sigh, She&#xD;
placed his head h~ her lap and kissed his lips, as she&#xD;
might have kissed him in his sleep. She gave no&#xD;
outward sign of sorrow; her sorrow was unutterable.&#xD;
Thus she sat, when a gruff voice notified her that the&#xD;
time had come for her to. retire. -She raised her tear~&#xD;
less eyes to the man and' said, in a low voice, "my&#xD;
father i~ dead; let me st~y with him." The man re~&#xD;
plied, not with particular rudeness, but according to&#xD;
the habit of his place, "it is against orders; you&#xD;
must go." She.quietlyiiftedthat venerable head from&#xD;
her lap and laid it on the straw. ~he kissed the cold lips&#xD;
once more, and then she rose tip and walked away&#xD;
without a tear or a sigh. Slie was benumbed with&#xD;
despair.&#xD;
lit was not until hours afterwards, it was at mid.&#xD;
night in the solitude of her chamber, that the icy rigor&#xD;
of despair melted into overflowing griefs&#xD;
The next morning she was unable to rise from her&#xD;
bed. Mrs. West went out and made application for&#xD;
the body of Colonel Fairfax, in order that he might&#xD;
have the cust6ma'ry rights of sepulchre. Her applied~&#xD;
* tion was refused. He was buried among strangers.&#xD;
Those who loved him cannot weep over the unknown&#xD;
grave of Frederick Fairfax.&#xD;

TIlE END.&#xD;
IN a few days Julia was able to travel. Thouo.h&#xD;
feeble in body and bruised in spirit, she would not&#xD;
rest longer from the sad duties that remained for ~&#xD;
She must return to her mother. She must icturn&#xD;
without her father. She must bear tidings of his&#xD;
death to his ~..heart..broken wife. She must console&#xD;
her whtowed mother, or, as appeared more probable,&#xD;
smooth her path to the grave. On such melancholy&#xD;
duties the unhappy but unselfish girl bent her pious&#xD;
thoughts.&#xD;
At that time the Federal authorities were permitting&#xD;
all women and children to go into the Confederacy,&#xD;
and were sending thither some of them who would&#xD;
have preferred to remain at their homes within the&#xD;
Fedei4il lines. Without difficulty, therefore, Mrs.&#xD;
West procured a passport for Julia to go t~ Richmond,&#xD;
and took passage for her upon a steamboat, which,&#xD;
under a flag of truce, landed passengers within a few&#xD;
miles of the Confederate capital. Thus was she trans..&#xD;
ported, with her burden of SOlTOW, to her afflicted&#xD;
but still beloved State.&#xD;
At Richmond she heard that Hugh Fitzhugh had&#xD;
been dangerously wounded, and that ~e was lying very&#xD;
low in the county to which he had been taken by his&#xD;
/ mother. Sorrows thickened about her at every step.&#xD;
That passionate love which, in young hearts, rules&#xD;
with exclusive dominion, would have carried her to&#xD;
the side of her wounded lover. She felt all the ten-&#xD;

der tyranny of that paSSlOfl. But her love for her&#xD;
mother, cherished from her birth, had. b~en through&#xD;
life associated with a sentiment of duty. It was now&#xD;
consecrated by domestic a~.ction. Duty was not&#xD;
doubtful, and Julia hastened to her mother.&#xD;
Mrs. Fairfax, during her daughter's absence, con-&#xD;
tinued to decline in health and strength. When Julia&#xD;
entered her apartment she raised herself with sudden&#xD;
and unusual energy in her bed. She stretched out&#xD;
her arms to embrace her daughter. While they&#xD;
clasped each other she cried, "your flither, Julia, have&#xD;
you seen your father ~"&#xD;
"Yes, dearest mamma?, I have semi him."&#xD;
"Has he come with youV'&#xD;
"0, mamma, mamma, h~has not come. He can-&#xD;
not-he will not-O dear, dear mamma, he will never&#xD;
come.'~&#xD;
Mrs. Fairfax silently sunk down upon the bed.&#xD;
Julia laid her head on the pillow beside her mother's,&#xD;
endeavoring to comfort her with nestling fondness.&#xD;
The widow uttered no loud lamentation. A few sobs&#xD;
and broken sentences expressed her agony. A few&#xD;
great tears trickled over her temples. She closed her&#xD;
eyes to shut out the world,. whivh f r her had lost its&#xD;
light. She lay bleeding irtwardly. The tenure of her&#xD;
life was broken.&#xD;
Thenceforth she faded away. In long hours of&#xD;
silence', by day and by night, the hope of being united&#xD;
once more and. forever with her husband in a better&#xD;
world, occupied her mind. Her daughter was always&#xD;
with, her, denying herself almost entirely the repose&#xD;
which she so much needed. Her sweet, untiring,&#xD;
patient love soothed the wounds of the heart which no&#xD;
earthly hand could heal. Sometimes ~he allured her~&#xD;
&#xD;
* mother into Conversation, and they talked of by-gone&#xD;
days, or of those who wei'e most dear to them, or of&#xD;
whatever subject had interest enough for ~fme widow&#xD;
to withdraw her attention from fatal grie~ Whether&#xD;
in conVersation or in m~itation, religion was always&#xD;
present to the thoughts of both, for both were sin-&#xD;
cerely pious, and death, then familiar alike to memory&#xD;
and to expectation, brought religion constantly before&#xD;
them as the light, of the grave. Mrs. Fairfax was&#xD;
sometimes visited by the Reverend Mr. Amble', who&#xD;
had left the village with Fitzhugh's regiment when&#xD;
the Federals were driven out, and he was now sojourn-&#xD;
ing a few miles from~ the house in which she was a&#xD;
guest. From him she received those counsels and&#xD;
consolations which it w~ms his office to bestow, and all&#xD;
that tender sympathy which the calamities of his dear-&#xD;
est friends excited in the bosom of this venerable&#xD;
man. When they conversed, as sometimes they,&#xD;
must, of the terrible misfortunes which had befallen&#xD;
their country as well as themselves, and the soul of&#xD;
Mrs. Fairfax was steeped in sorrow, he presented the&#xD;
only solace which remained for such misfortunes.&#xD;
Often she desired her daughter to sing, and her musi-&#xD;
cal voice seemed to alleviate the widow's grief.. It was&#xD;
a severe trial of Julia's fortitude to control her own&#xD;
agitation and modulate her voice to music, especially&#xD;
when her mother asked her to sing such hymns as&#xD;
this:&#xD;
HYMN.&#xD;

In st~irless gloom we pray to Thee for light:&#xD;

'When Mrs. Fairfax became certain that she was&#xD;
about to die she was not only resigned, but was&#xD;
almost cheerful. Finally she fell into the sleep that&#xD;
knows no waking, as gently as a babe faIls asleep i~&#xD;
a mothei~s arms.&#xD;
.Iulia, after fulfilling her last filial dnty, accepted an&#xD;
invitation from Mrs. Fitzhu~gh to .visit that lady at the&#xD;
cottage which she then occupied 'with her son. Be-&#xD;
fore leaving the county, a natural feeling induced&#xD;
3ulia to visit Roebuck, which she had not seelf SinCO&#xD;
she was driven from the house by fire, and snatched&#xD;
from her parents by violelice. She found a~scene of&#xD;
desolation where, according to her fond recollection,&#xD;
~ she had known a paradise. The grounds in which&#xD;
childhood had played were strewn with fragments&#xD;
of their former decorations. The garden which she&#xD;
had left in blooming beauty ~#as covered with a mat&#xD;
of trampled stems. Here and there scanty patches&#xD;
of corn were lazily cultivated by the negroes who&#xD;
remained, but over wide fields the Wheat, unhar-&#xD;

vested, was left to rot, and the eorn was overgrown~&#xD;
with weeds. Fences were destroyed, t~arne were&#xD;
burnt, fruit-trees were out down. I3lackaned, roofless&#xD;
walls were all that remained of the, elegant mansion&#xD;
in which a happy family had lived so long, in the&#xD;
unity of love, and in the .~raotico of every domestic,&#xD;
every social virtue. There, whatever is admirable in&#xD;
refinement~ was familiar as a household habit. There,&#xD;
a generous hospitality, and more generous charity,&#xD;
were dispensed as duly as the prayer for daily bread&#xD;
was repeated at morning and evening. When Julia&#xD;
stood alone, a soUtary orphan, on the marble steps&#xD;
which had been trodden by ~6 many entering and de~&#xD;
parting guests, she looked through4 the opening, in&#xD;
which the hospitable door had stood, and saw nothing&#xD;
but ashes. The scenes of happiness within those&#xD;
w~ills which her memory ~o~v recalled, served only to&#xD;
deepen her sense of desolation. But most sorrowful&#xD;
of all associations with the scene, were the recent suf.&#xD;
(cringe and.death of her father and mother, and of a~&#xD;
nncl~ whom she had loved almost as dearly as ~he&#xD;
loved her parents. As she stood among the ruins, of&#xD;
her home, and west over the. calamities of her family,&#xD;
vividly remembering the dreadful scenes through&#xD;
which she had passed, and looldn~ forward to a dark&#xD;
fatui'e, a feeling overcame herr not unlike the despair-&#xD;

under the sun."&#xD;
ThWfhe soul of Julia Fairfax could n'ot long d'~v~elI&#xD;
in the degradation of despair. She could not long&#xD;
cherish a vindictive feeling. The most unhappy life&#xD;
could not appear worthless to one who valued llf~ for&#xD;
the power of doing good. in misfortune her tender&#xD;
heart yielded the. tribute which nature demands, but&#xD;
then, without tepining, and without resentment, she&#xD;
turned with firm, though gentle resolution, t~ the du..&#xD;
ties which misfortune imposes.&#xD;
After this visit to Roebuck, she took leave&#xD;
of the kind friends wh&amp;amp; had giVen shelter to&#xD;
her- mother, and went to the humble cottage of&#xD;
Mrs. Fitzhugh. The old lady received her with&#xD;
~notherly affection. Hugh had passed the crisis of&#xD;
danger, and wa~ slowly recovering~ Yet it was not&#xD;
deemed ~certain that his former strength would ever&#xD;
be rest~red. ,When he was first brought to the cot~&#xD;
tage, overy~ one who saw him, except his mother, ex-&#xD;
pected him to die from hour to hour. But the brave&#xD;
and proud woman would not believe that her gallant&#xD;
eon was to die. Disdaining to yield to her own in-'&#xD;
firmity, sh~ nursed him with unremitting~caro. Others&#xD;
often would have relieved her of this duty, but she re-&#xD;
garded herself as a sentinel between life and death for&#xD;
her son, and she would not desert her post. When&#xD;
Julia arrived, he was still feeble, bu~ he was out '&amp;amp;f&#xD;
danger.&#xD;
His love was a~ balm to her heart. * Consoling and&#xD;
- consoled, she felt the power of mutual love to sweeten&#xD;
sorrow. He desired that their marriage should take&#xD;
place without delay. Whatever objections ~he urged,&#xD;
he derived arguments so f~i'cible from the cireum-&#xD;
