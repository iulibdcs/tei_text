PREFACE. THE incidents upon which the following story is founded, were related to me several years ago by an aged pioheer, with the request that I would embody them in a narrative. City-born and city-bred,' Idid not then'feel equal to the attempt. But four years of actual pioneer life in the valley of the, Upper -Des Moines, of emigrant life in a cabin on the prairie, have, I think, given me experience enough in Westr ern scenery and Western character, to delineate, :ith  at least tolerable accuracy and fidelity, the events  which form the various chapters of my story. M7:/:. of the minor incidents' are truthful transcritpts fromj  my own pioneer joys and sorrows, while the sceiner: is the same that gladdens my eyes every time He  look frommy cabin window. But two of my chsaracters are far-fetched, Bi:gt,. A eyed and White Cloud. The former hadheprto- type in a young Indian girl, raised. in the  'JlP distant relative, while  the Original of -the atteru iay,: be foundin the "Shawn eeProphet/' of Catli  -  look from my cabin window.    -- ,  &#xD;<pb n="iv-v (Table of Contents) " xml:id="VAC7838-00000003"/> 'PREF-C-. iV      PBEFACL. iv Like all faithful records of the life that is, my story has a moral, and though written. chiefly to interest and entertain, will not, I hope, be found entirely without profit. That it may be a help to - warn you from the shadows of sin, and guide you into the sunshine of virtue, is my earnest prayex.       CAROLINE A. SOULE. Boonsboro', Iowa, September, 1859.

Radiant in her matured beauty, her; queen-like figure seemed strangely out of place, as it stood there in that rough frame of uhewn logs, her slight, tapering fingers playing nervously with a tendril of the wild grape-vine that draped the -rude porch. Sad thoughts seemed crowding into her heart, too, for sudden- ly she pressed both hands upon her bosom with a convulsive motion, and, as she did so, the long, dark eyelashes twinkled as with a spasm, and, in a moment, the white cheeks were wet. Cheery sounds, a long, loud hurrah, and a merry air, whistled as it seemed, by jocund lips, startled her from the. mental agony into which, she seemed lapsing. Darting around the cabin, she hastily laved her face in the trough of clear rain:water that stood under the southern eaves, M and then rubbing it briskly with the coarse towel -that hung from one of the projecting joists, she resumed her station on the threshold, a sweet, bird-like strain fluttering from her yet pale lips. A noble-looking man, somewhat past the prime of life, yet still hale and hearty, and a cu'rly-head- ed lad of some fourteen slummers, emerging from the shadows ofhe e woodland, came hastily towards the cabin, and were soon leaping the rough pickeths-/at enclosed its little garden. - "'The, queen of 'the flowers sends grgeeting," cried' the younger of the two, gaily, as he bound- ed:tow-ards the fair maiden. And as he spoke, he -shobwe:ed-her brow, bosom and hands,: with the strange, fairy-like blossoms that hide in the dim ook of th:e forest.,  "And- the queen of the fruits sends greeting, too,' added: he, as scattering some wild roses "t        .          il o   H .       STHE NNF^ EOME.      9 from the Tim of the coarse straw- bat he held in one hand, he showed her its crown, lined with oak leaves, and filled to the brim with freshy gathered strawherries.  "And the queen of the waters sends greet- ing," said the elder, the-father it seemed he must be, of the other two, and a string of fine fish, yet dripping with the waves of their. river bed, were dropped at the feet of the daughter. "Many thanks, aye, a thousand, my. knights, and for thy reward, behold what'the queen of the prairie, as my last love-sick swain in poet's phrase styled me, - behold, what she offers," and lifting the blanket that served for a door, she led the way into the little, low hut.  They were new comers, these three, and the last who had arrived in that settlement, and having been but three weeks in that new, wild home, had as yet had no time to remodel the: cab- in they had been so- thankful to find on their land. It was one of the rudest the emigrant er  inhabits, having been built-by a squ-ter some three years before, when there was nodsaw-nillU within forty miles of the spot. Rough, qnhewn logs,-dovetailed together, formed the sides, tihe  crevices of which had once been plastered with prairie mud, but the- rains had soaked into Sit, until the little that was not washed entirely away, plung now in, unseemly daubs to' theba*rk, leavmngopenings of such width that every: access was afforded. to both summer wind and winrte storm.

THE PET OF THE SETTLEMENT was of puncheons, uneven and rough,'and with such broad cracks that snakes not unfrequetitly crawled through them and hissed at the fireside. There was no window, nor indeed, any aperture for one, the light in wintertime coming down the vast jambs of the stick chimney that occupied nearly one whole side of the cabin; and in warm weather, entering at the north and south thresholds, neither of which had- a door, a horse- blanket or worn bed-quilt serving for panels. : Asl Margaret unfastenedvthe loops of each let- ting in the sunshine and the fresh morning air, a rude, yet, cheerful scene presented itself,-a taste of genuine frontier life. Snow white sheets, suspended from wooden pins, made in one corner a little nook, behind which, if you looked, you saw a pile of rose-blankets and calico quilts, a pair of pillows, and a square trunk cov- ered with a linen towel, upon which lay a pocket- Bible and hymn-book, a tiny work-basket, brushes and combs, and a little giltframed mirror. This , was Margaret's bed-room, and that pile of' blan- kets and quilts all the bed her delicate form had rested on'rSince six weeks before, she crossed the Mississippi. Rumpled and wet with tears were ttnose pillows many a night, and yet the angels , loved dearly to hover above them, for ever after -the aigony came the prayer, and then sweet step :andisweeter peace. : - ':iIn the opposite corner lay a pile of skins, buf- fal:o :and; deer mostly, though here and there a wo!s d and ,wild cat's blended with them their n er: hlures:'the whole forming the hunter-like 'c3ch-',hoI fther -and son. Above it hung a   "' erifle, adobulrelled gun, a light fowl ig-piece - arfi'a brace:dotistols. Into the crevices of the  " :   THE NEW  OME,.      " logs were pierced sundry sharp knives, while- above all, in a picturesque snarl, dangled a seine and a pigeon-net. The space upon one side of the ample hearth was occupied by three barrels, while the other held several shelves, formed, it would seem, Out of the sides of packing-boxes, not put up with cleats though, but resting on long, stout wooden pins, A table evidently of home manufacture, for the legs yet wore the bark of the saplings out of which they were cut, stood in the centre of the rude room. Strangely out of place seemed the fine damask cloth that covered it, and so seemed the pure white dishes, the ivory-handled knives, the silver forks and spoons, the napkins and the rings. Yet as tastefully as though in the dining-  room of one of the princely homes of the Atlantic cities, were they all arranged. A keen gl'ance the maiden gave it as she entered, scaring one fly from off the lumps of crystal sugar, anothe'r from-the white honey-comb, removing a -cup: from the, cream-pitcher, and a bowl from off the golden slice of butter, and then adding two goblets, she8 filled them with the choicest of the gathered'  flowers, and giving the boy a dish, bade him carefully hll the fresh berries, while she served ( the breakfast.

THE PET OF THE SETTLEMENT. the bake-kettle was carefully lifted, and, watch ing, lest a- dust of ashes or a stray coal should fall on it, a corn pone, light as a sponge cake, and of that golden-brown hue which shows it crispy yet tender, was turned out and borne smoking hot to the table. Sugar was sifted over Harrie's berries and rich cream, turned on; the ham, broiled to a turn and garnished with lumps of sweet butter; the snow white eggs lifted into their bowl; the coffee turned into a pitcher, and - then, all neatly arranged upon the little table, Margaret laughingly bade them draw up their -trunks, for as yet there was -no chair in the set- tlement, and partake of her fare.  a  "How delioious,'" said Mr. Belden, as he drop- ped -a lump of sugar and a spoonful of cream into the clear, rich coffee which his daughter handed EMms. "When -you learn to make coffee like this, m-y dear, I shall have no fear of starving, for I eould live wholly on it." "Is it good, father?" she asked, and then, see- ing an affirmative answer in the glow. of satisfac. tion:that diffused itself over his face as he tasted it, she ;ontinued, "I am so glad, for--I made it iuyself'" -   ' Did you?" said Harrie; " well, I guess you didn't make this light, sweet corn cake," and he broke apart a-slice, and leisurely watched the butter melt over its golden fragments. "- -But I did, though, Harrie. Old Mrs. Symmes Ofered to come: over and help me, now- Nancy - was gone, but I thought it a shame to let such an od lady :oup my work, and told her I 'd try :Oce mysi  ahd reallly,2" and she smiled abright, beau:fiM'{le "if I. may argue from this morn- :fgi.:success, I shall not in the end turn out an indifferent emigrant daughter and sister."   - THE NEW-OE. - -    13E "No, indeed," said her father, " but a most he- roic one; for, believe me, Margaret, the keenest -test of a woman's true nature is the manner in: which she performs the trivial duties of life.. I did not expect you would shrink, when I told you that, so suddenly and fearfully too, I was ru- ined, and that you, my delicate and my darling one, must give up all those luxuries which long use had almost made-necessities; that you must' break up the ties of old friendships, and become an emigrant to this Indian land. No; I knew you would do it all bravely as you did, my dear. But I did fear. for you, Margaret, when you should come to the realities of our humbled life; the every day annoyances of our limited means; the household drudgery; the mepial tasks. And believe me, dearest, never did I reverence you more than just now, when I saw you, so quietly serve up this meal- the sweetest I have tasted for many a long year. We shall be happy now, daughter.," He said no more, nor did any one, for :some time, but there was a bright, happy- look upon every face, that spoke more eloquently than, -words, of the hidden joy that was rippling in each heart. "And. now for some strawherries,- sis'," said i Harrie, -gaily, as, pushing aside his plate, thriea emptied, for a keen appetite, as he naively said, was one luxury which wealth never gave, but -poverty always; "'be generous, sis', you shall have some more for tea."         -- "Are they plenty, Harrie?"'

I could show you an acre 0of them - walk you right into them." "I wish you would, Harrie, and then let me eat my way out, for really these are delicious." "Well, then, wipe up your dishes in a hurry, and get your sun-bonnet, and we 11 be off." Stay, Harrie; I 've a better plan. I propose that we harness up the team and get old Uncle Billy and go-up north about ten miles, to that other half section I own, the one- I should have settled on, but that I feared the Indians who yet live about there, might scare the wits out of us with their unearthly whoops. Billy was telling me yesterday about it. He has killed many a fat buck on it, he says, for sixty acres of it' are tim- ber, and many a wild turkey, too, for they roam there in flocks.. He said ITought to see it and I oig:ht to take ' that darter o' mine, for there were heaps o' pretties therej' strawherries and flowers and birds and spotted deer and .  "Indians, squaws, pappooses and bears," addedi arrie. "There, that 'll do, father. I 'm wild to go, already, only I 11 just stop to load my gun,' and he took down the fowling-piece. ' "-You're sure there's no danger, father?" asked Margaret, for she had listened till a late hoeur i the evening before, to old Mrs. Symmes' :stories of the perils of the early settlers, from - wil-d anirmals and red men, and could not help feeling a little timid. : ' Danger,' exclaimed Harrie, "and with old Uncle/Billy along, who has killed more Indians than I have fingers, and more bears than I have todes; who can talk Sacs, Fox, Pottowattamie ,.   THE NEW',HOME.      1 5 and Sioux, better than he can English, who can scent a red man five miles ;-danger-- hurrah ; if there is, I 'm in for it." "No, Margaret," said Mr. Belden, calmly, "I do not apprehend any danger. If I did, I surely would not expose you. Uncle Billy assures me that the Indians are very quiet now; the few turbulent onds amongst them having gone on a war trail beyond the Missouri. So get ready as soon as you can, daughter, and, by the way, put up a lunch, a generous one, too, for these prai- ries give one a wolfish appetite." Hastily but neatly did Margaret rinse and replace her breakfast dishes and clear the table. Then taking down her travelling basket from one of the shelves, she laid some snowy towels in it, and then filled it full of sandwiches, boiled eggs, cold biscuits and honey. Thenh she -filled a jug with morning's milk and another with yesterday's buttermilk, for she knew Uncle Billy would prefer that, and then changing her muslin morn;- ing robe, for a serviceable calico dress, she wait, ed for them, sun-bonnet in hand.  &#xD;<pb n="16-17" xml:id="VAC7838-00000009"/> CHAPTER II. A- STRAWBERRYIN(.. THE team soon came around, and as Margaret seated herself on the freshy mown grass that lined the wagon bed, she was conscious of an exhilaration of heart to which she had long been a stranger. The day was warm, but only pleas- antly so, and with that soft fresh wind that gives spirit to everything., Low, breezy murmurs stole up from the depths of the woodland, while the prairie grass, not yet long, but soft and Inxu. riant, seemed alive with sweet whisperings. The incense of strangely beautiful fowers, crushed into untimely death each mpment, for the- horse's hoofs and the wagon wheels were constantly trampling upon them and breaking them down; the varied notes of bird-music, some sharp and shrill as a martial trumpet, others, soft and cooing as a baby;s voice, and others still, rich and sweet as the air of a humana song; the wildness of the scenery, on the one wside a ten- mile prairie stretching its emerald hues to the ghlden horizon, that, far in the east, bent down to'neet it; on the other, a dense forest, with no paths save the trail of the red man and the swift- footed deer, and northward and southward, far as eye could reach, that same broad, meadow-like expanse that swept eastward; an atmosphere so pure and serene that it seemed one might, if 16   iA-STRAWBERRYING.      17 eagle-eyed, peer upward' into Minnesota, and downward into Missousi;: with all thesoe t weav enchantment about the senses and(:soQl of..agga. ret, it was no wonder her pale cheek flushed m  with an unusual hue, while her eye sparkled with i i  unwonted light.

She was two hundred miles beyond the Missis- sippi, in an Indian land, on a- prairie wher-;bfor ages the red man had burnt his council fires, fought his battles and hunted his prey:,:, and- now she was leaving behind her the only little settle- ment that the pale-face had ventured to make-.'i that yet wild spot, leaving the log cabins, and going towards the barks wigwams, perohanee-to see dusky warriors with scalp-locks streaming from their belts, dash out from the timber, or rise up, wierd-like, from the marsh-grtss inwhich they had lain coiled up in ambi. ; All that she had ever heard, or reads of Indian stratagem or Indian cruelty, came!back to memory, and so vividly, too, that she. several times closed her eyes and pressed her hands onthem, as if to shit out the fearful sight. But soon the fresh morn- ing air, so deliciously flavored with the breath of blue violets, and so sweetly dampened with the dew of wild roses, thrilled her veins wita such .. pleasureable excitement, that --she forgot -all the terrors that might befall -them, and abandoned 2*  &#xD;<pb n="18-19" xml:id="VAC7838-00000010"/> 18    THE PET OF THE SETTLEMENT. herself wholly to the joy of the moment, quaffing the nectar that floated on the goblet's: brim, without .caring to see whether it were distilled from poison herb, or dissolved from beauteous pearl. - Do you see yon stake, sir?" asked Uncle Billy, when they had driven some three hours. "Wael, that's ye're soud-east corner, and the ipurtiest parara ever you seed in your life. I guess as how we 'll hitch the team purty soon- when we come to that ar' little run you see shiini in the sun. There 's a spring just above, - good water, too, and I reckon ye be all dry by this time." The clear waters of the little stream that rip- pled through the short grass so quietly that at a distance it seemed a thread of silver glistening there, was soon gained, and the horses after being allowed to drink their fill, were loosened from the wagon, and picketed, emigrant fashion, with a wide circle of delicious feed'-for their refresh- ment. Ere this was done, though, Margaret had leaped from her green covert, in the end of the long wagon, and was ankle-deep in roses and cluster pinks, hundreds of which grew on every rod of that virgoa soil, while Harrie had bounded into the timber, having marked, with hunter's eye-sight, a scarred old tree, on which a flock of pigeons sat, sweetly cooing. There was a sharp click, a flash, a report, and ere the smoke had quite curled up to the tops of the green '   : - 9trees, he was racing back again with a pair of little broken-winged birds. aPurty well did, that, bud," said the old hunt-. er, taking his gun, and eyeing curiously its silver mountings.' Ye 'll be able to take down a red skin afore winter."                        . ,    A-STRAWBERRYING,      10 "Too bad, too bad, Harrie," said Margaret, pityingly, as she stroked the soft plumage of the little flutterers. "They were so happy-a mo- ment since,--now their music-tones are hushed forever. Mother-birds, too, perhaps, and now their little fledglings are so friendless;" and a tear mingled with the blood-stain on their droop ing wing. "Father, forbid him to shoot any more to-day. We came strawherrying, not hunting." And she tenderly folded the wounded birds to her bosom. "You 're too soft-hearted, sis'. You 'll never do for an emigrant's wife if you cry at such a shot as that." - Then, marking the wild, despair. ing look that flew over her face at the word wife, he added gently, "but I 'll kill no more to-day, Maggie. Get the pails, and we 'll look now for berries.'  - They did not go far, ere the scarlet clusters were seen peeping up 'from the short green grass, and so luxuriant were they, that several quarts were gathered, ere the shadows showed the noon-mark. "And now, Harrie, I '1 sit down under that tree by the spring, and hull some, they 'll taste cool and sweet to father and Uele Billy, after their long tramp, and you, come, too, and get out the jugs of milk and set them in the stream for me and spread the lunch." The berries soon lay in scarlet piles upon thf china saucers, snow-white sugar dissolving over them, and rippling through the' glowing mass in luscious tides; the cooled milk was poured into ample bowls; the sandwiches tastefully arranged on a napkin and garnished with the cold eggs; the biscuits sliced and spread with the amber- w * *a;    bvr- ,  &#xD;<pb n="20-21" xml:id="VAC7838-00000011"/> 20    THE PET OF THE SETTLErMENT.' hued honey; little knots of roses and violets placedbeside each dish, a pitcher of water brought fresh from the bubbling spring, and then, while Margaret, with a half-poet, half-house- wife eye, scanned for-the last time, the sylvan feast, Harrie mounted- the wagon seat, and, mak- ing a bugle of his hands, pealed forth a dinner summrons to the truant men. Mr." Belden's eyes sparkled as he came in sight, and as he seated himself beside his daugh- ter, he gently pressed a kiss upon her lips and whispered, " my noble, thoughtful child." Even Uncle Billy, half-Indian as he was in all his ways, seemed pleased with the delicate taste displayed, and murmured to Harrie, ' she comes nearest an angel of any woman I ever seed. Who else ever'd a-thought of'fixing things so purty out here?" As to Harrie he was wild with excitement, and declared he 'd never go east again if his father became ever and ever so rich. One such meal as this on the wild prairie was worth a hundred din- ners -at Taylor's Saloon, and then out here, he should grow to be a man,--a man with hands that could dol something else beside twirl a moustache or gold-headed -cane; with feet that could follow the plough, though a Congress gai- ter never troubled them; with eyes that could see heaven without an opera glass to aid them; with lips that could utter something beside flat- teqy to Parisian-decked ladies; and to conclude, said the boy, with a flourish' of both hands, "a brain that can think of something else than danc- ing girls and brandy-smashers,- a brain that can think great thoughts, yes, great and good and fresh and new ones, such:as never come to those 'who live only in the man-built city " s .

God grant, my. brother, : I  that these things be, We shall then be rich though monied wealth is never ours again." i    t-"God grant it,' said their father solemnly, and he laid a hand upon the head of each. "Beside the holy altar of the Lord, you were once by solemn rite dedicated to him and his Son, our blessed Saviour. To-day, in one of his first tem. fl  ples, in this old grove, under his sunlight and 9iqi -beside this brook, cool as Siloam, I again, my  BE children, give you to Him.

It was broken by Uncle Billy, and so gently that one could not but feel that delicate instincts were hidden under hils somewhat rough exterior. * The shadows  lengthen and we are many miles from the settlement."        ' Yes, yes, I see" said Mr. Belden. "Pleasant as it is for us to linger here in this cool, shady pot, it will not do. If we go to see that run you speak of, we must be off." i. Have you found all the corners if your sece ion, father?" asked Margaret. "Yes, dear.'

"Let me go with you," said Harrie. "And leave Margaret alone!" / "Yes," said the sister, cheerfully.- "I am not at all afraid. I have seen no living thing about here, save the birds and the squirrels, and I should like to know how it would seem to feel myself for once entirely alone with nature. But you may leave me the pistols in case an Indian or bear should show his head." And she laugh- ed gleefully- "-Do you suppose you could fire one now?" asked Harrie roguishy. - "Give me one." She took it from his hand, pointed it, drew the trigger, - snap - bang I "Can't I?" "That'll do, sis. I pity the red skin that. shows himself now. Come let us go father." Mr. Belden reloaded the pistols, and the three started..  Margaret gathered up the fragments of the Iunch and placed- them in the basket; set the jugs in the running stream; turned the gather- ed strawherries into one large pail, covered it closely and placed it where the waters of the spring would bubble about it and keep them cool and fresh, and then bathing her face and hands, she sat down on a mossy bank and gave herself up to quiet meditation. After awhile a feeling of a-we stole over her, so intense and silent was the solitude, for, the breeze had died away, until not a leaf rustled, and few, birds that yet lingered on the boughs, were as voiceless as though the sha. dows of evenings had already fallen. She tried   THE NEW HOME.       23 to shake it off, for she did not care to indulge it A   then, knowing but too well that her nerves were' yet too feeble from care and sorrow to bear a fresh strain on them, so she resolved to go berry ing off on the prairie. Thered was a gophar ',T'g mound about a half a mile from the spot where :  they had spent the forenoon, and on the shatter- Ir .,ed trunk of an old tree, which the lightning per. haps, years before had blasted. Uncle Billy had told her that strawherries loved to grow about such spots, and so she set' out now in search of I j  the coveted fruit. The walk was made beautiful :!j  by the multitudes of roses and pinks that cluster- ed about her feet, and many a tastefiul bouquet did she gather, only to cast it aside in a moment for a fresher and more beautiful one. "Strawherries, strawherries, who'll buy my strawherries," said she, as coming closer to the -old tree, she marked the rich clusters that cover- ed every inch of the ground, and then singing the same words to an impromptu melody, she knelt down on the fragrant grass and commenced culling the fairest and largest. But what hushes her voice so quickly and stays her fingers even as it touches one of the ripest and most luscious looking berries she had   seen that day. That scarlet spot, deep down in that little hollow, --did, strawherries ever even in the luxuriance of prairie land grow so tall and so profusely--did they ever bed themselves so closely together that stem nor leaf were visible I mMargaret hurriedly rose to her feet, and leav- !  ing her pail and basket, snatching too her sun- * bonnet from  her head, that she might see the- quicker and clearer, bounded down the slope.

A half- seared look for a moment flitted over the white face, and a single sob swelled its little heart. Then a smile dimpled its coral lips, and two little hands were lifted up. Faint and weak with the emotions that crowd- ed into her soul at thie strange, almost wierd sight, -a babe, a white man's babe thus lost on that lone, wild prairie,- Margaret gathering the little one to her bosom, sank down upon the grass and vainly strove to quiet her excitement suffi- ciently to think calmly as to her course. Mean- ,r   while the child, seizing with almost frantic haste one of -her white fingers, had pressed it into its , little mouth and -was wistfully sucking it. Miss. -ingX the soft sweet flow of milk, which it was evident she thought would follow her begging lips, she set up a low, sad, piteous cry, more like the moan of agony than the wail of hunger. '.Poor little one," said Margaret, tenderly, "half-starved, I'l w-arrant. Thank heaven there is- yet-milk left in the- jug," and holding it closer to her bosom, she retraced her steps to the spring. oQ i the way she resolved how to act, and no-sooner hadi she lain the child in the shad- ow of the,:old tree, underneath which they had lunched, then she hurriedly fired off both pistols.

The men had already turned their steps from gi  the waterfall, but were leisurely wandering along engaged in crude speculations as to-the probabil- i  ities of railroads ever entering into their settle. ment, when the sound of Margaret's pistols start- led them from their loitering steps, and quicken- i!  ing them into a run, they hurried to her assis- tf tance, Mr. Belden and Harrie white with fear, :X   lest they should find her grappled by some stray bear, or a scalpless corpse bleeding in the hands Xi  of an Indian, and Uncle Billy swearing vengeance on whatever man or beast, that should have dared to scare that u angel of a girl." Scarcely ten minutes had elapsed after the first report ere they were in sight of the spring. Xi,'  The stillness of death seemed. to reign there, a stillness that was terrific. "My child," screamed the father, and wrung his hands - "My sister," cried Harrie, and beat his breast wildly-"Plague take them-red skins, I 'll be arter 'em," said Uncle Billy, and--he grit. ted his teeth. They hurried on. A few more steps and they stood beside - the living Margaret - yes, it was Margaret, alive and in no danger, but what held she to her heart I "Speak, speak," they cried with. one voice. "Look, look," she said unfolding the scarlet cloak and showing the sleeping babe. ' A white man's child, and lost on this parara, where scarcely a dozen white men's feet have trod-- there's some deviltry up then," cried Uncle Billy, and he listened keenly to the girl's story. 3  &#xD;<pb n="26-27" xml:id="VAC7838-00000014"/> 26    THE PET OF' THE SETTLEMENT. "By yon gophar mound, you say-is the young 'un sound?" "I think so," said Margaret, and she gently placed the little still form in the wagon bed. "Watch her," said the old man to Mr. Belden and Harrie, " and you, my darter, come with me. I must see the very spot where you found her, and then be"it white man's, Injuns or devil's mischief, Uncle Billy will be on their trails."   ::!          CHAPTER III. Aj HARRIE'S SH OT; B:i::i "IT was here," said Margaret, stooping to pick :i?   up the pail which she had quite forgotten in the hurry and excitement of her return, " just here that I was kneeling, and there is the very straw- berry I had in my fingers," a double one it was, almost as large and quite as rich and juicy as 'a Hovey's seedling, " when chancing to look down- into that little hollow, I saw the scarlet cloak fluttering gently. Dear me I But my heart quivers and my knees tremble yet, when I think of it. How could the little creature have come there.

Here, there and every where , wandered his eyes for a few mo- ments.; then he cried out in an exultant tone, I' ve found it." ".What, Uncle Billy." "The trail, darter. Come on now. Follow me close. I darsn'tleave you far behind me now, for there' s no knowing when the red skin 'll pop up his ugly head. - Hope I' 11 get the scalping of it yet, the varmint.' "But where is it, Uncle," asked, Margaret, when she had paced a rod or two. "I don't see any footsteps." -"I guess not, darter. Footsteps!" and he chuckled. "You don't s'pose a red-skin'd leave footsteps when he was doing up sich an ugly job as- this. He's too cunnin' for that. But look here, do you see that," and he pointed with his finger to a bunch of violets whose sweet life was crushed out of them; and a little further along, to a-stem of mashed strawherries, and further still to a drooping pink and a bent rose twig.7 "Yes," said Margaret. "I see all this, but how do you know it wasn't some animal.!' "Ha 1 ha!" laughed Uncle Billy, ' ought n't I to know, when I've- lived in Injun land sirice I :was knee high to a hop-toad -- ought n't I to know rhen I tracked my own little-gal, my purty Sallie, over two hundred miles, when the red kilns'carried. her off. I tell you, I'm on the trail;"and he bent his eyes again keenly to the ground. M:-]ieiandering about the prairie, in a circuitous route of nearly a mile, they came at length to a broad slough, whose pure waters were evidently spring fed. f::Here, Uncle Billy:paused awhile,   HARRIE'S SHOT,  . .    W and then said in a tone of vexation, "^the plaguy scamps; they will take to the water if they get a chance. But he won't cheat me quite, this time. I know this slough. I've been in it duck hunting, and I know there's. only two places besides this where a fellow can, get out if he. gets in, without being stuck. The one is over yon,; the other down this way. -Let's see. Wall, I reckon we'll try this; he'd be likelyT to- stick purty close to the timber; it's better hiding." And keeping the south side of the slough,: they walked rapidly for about a quarter of a mile. "Did n't I know so," said the old man. pointing to some deep dents in the soft bank.' "The feller swam or wjaded till here and .then came ashore. 'Twill be easy tracking him now, for he thtins he's safe." And the old ma --took a south-wester ly course, steering for the nearest point :of tim- ber. "- There," said he, resting' for a momnent under the shadow of an old oak,; " now, iff it warn't for you, darter, I'd follow him. right, off, and never sleep till I had him in the settlement; but I darsn't take you into these thickets. So I'll just blaze this yur tree, and then well turn back, for I reckon your father and the boy 'll be worried by this time." He had just snapped the blade of his huge jack-knife into its horn case, when the report of a gun went surging through the still air.  "Heavens and airth! Whats up now,. That's one of their guns, darter, and t here's some, mix chief brewing. Come on, dear ;" and he seized her hand. "Don't shake 'o, darter we'll soon be with 'em, and you'll see Uncle Billy is good for half a dozen red skins."

'heart throbbing so, that she felt half suffocated, Margaret allowed--herself to be dragged along, once in awhile murmuring, If I'd only stayed with them." "Best you didn't, darter, 'cause you'd only been in the way, and perhaps got hurt, while now you're safe ; and then may be it aint nothing after all. They may only have worried about us, and fired off the gun as a, signal to come back, or they may have seen a deer. So don't take on so; pluck up courage; we'll sooh be there." And they were soon there, and the first sight that greeted the daughter's eyes was- her father, safe and sound, leaning on his rifle, and looking anxiously towards the gophar mound. '"Father, father, what was it?" cried Margaret, as she sunk, pale and weak, on the turf beside him. ' O, sis, sis, look here, I've killed an Injun," said Harrie, " but somehow I aint as glad as I thought I'd be, though the rascal deserved it, trying to shoot that little baby. Tell her about it, father, do, and you, Uncle Billy, come and see the poor fellow; he's a young one, and not much older than I." Harrie drew down the table-cloth, which his eastern ideas of decency had caused him to draw over the corpse, and the old man knelt down be- side it and looked at it earnestly. Then he put this hand on its heart, and then catching from Harrie's hand the silk kerchief with which he , Swas-about to wipe the perspiration from his brow, :commenced staunching the wound. "Isn't he dead, then, Uncle Billy," gasped Harrie, and held his breath while waiting for the 'answer,   HARRIE'S SHOT. .     3i "No, boy, nor likely to die, unless he bleeds to death, and that there's no need of;" and he soon had the blood stopped and the wounded thigh neat- ly bandaged; and then, taking a flask of whiskey from his pocket, he pried open the set teeth with the boy's pen-knife, and forced down a few drops. Its effects were soon seen. A faint, fluttering motion came back to the heart; then the pulse started, the muscles of the face twitched, the eyelids quivered, and finally a long drawn sigh announced that the work of respiration had again commenced. "O, I thank God he yet lives," said Harrie, "for somehow, though my conscience didn't ac- cuse me, I yet felt dreadfully, for after all he was my brother." "Your brother," cried Uncle Billy, scornfully. "Catch me calling a red-skin my brother, the bloody varmints. - Yet even as he spoke, he lift- ed the head of the Indian lad as carefully on to his knee as if it had been his own sick child. Ah, Uncle Billy, thought Margaret, your heart is softer than you wish us to think it is. And she drew nearer and commenced chafing the cold hands. "That's right, darter, that'll help bring him too," and he poured a few more drops of whiskey through the livid lips. Then the eyes opened, and giving a wild, startled look about him, the sufferer strove to rise. Uncle Billy put his mouth close to his ear and whispered a few words in Sac. They seemed to satisfy the lad, for he lay perfectly still after that, and soon, by his regular breathing, seemed to sleep. , "And now, Mr. Belden, tell us how it all hap-  &#xD;<pb n="32-33" xml:id="VAC7838-00000017"/> THE PET OF THE SETTLEMENT. pened, for I know this boy, and I'd sooner my best gun had been lost, than a hair of his head hurt, red skin as he is, for his old Injun: father and I have hunted tegether many a day. A bad thing for the settlement if that boy dies on our hands." "I hardly know, Uncle Billy. Harrie and I were sitting quietly here, when suddenly he laid his hand on my arm and whispered, 'Still, still, father ,I. see a deer,' and pointed to yonder thick- et. Looking there, I perceived something mQv- ing cautiously along, but ere I could discover its form or color, an arrow whizzed by me and fast- ened itself in the stern-board of the wagon, just over that baby's head., My old blood was up, Uncle Billy, and Christian as I call myself, I felt like paying back the evil deed, but Harrie was too quick foreme, for ere I could sight my gun, he had fired, and in an instant was dragging from the underbrush the poor fellow you hold. He struggled violently a few moments and then gasped, as we thought, his last breath. And now, that my passion is over, I'm as glad as Harrie that he isn't dead. But what couldhave prompt- ed him to shoot his arrow at a little harmless child.'" "What prompted, as you call it, him or some other red skin, to carry the young un off on the parara there, and leave it for the wolves to tear limb by limb; - deviltry, sir, that was it. ' But I'm glad I came in time to save his life, for he'll be our friend forever now, for an Injun, say what ye will about him, has one good trait - he's grate- ful, and that's more than many white men are. Haven't I worked day in and day out for some of 'em, and when I was looking for a bit of kindness   in return, got a dig in my backfor my pains ;but an Injun's as mighty to remember a good deed as a bad one. But it's getting Iate, and those clouds up there look thundery-like, and then we've had a queer day altogether, no knowing what'll hap. pen next, and so my opinion is, we'd best be start- ing back." "But will it be safe to carry the poor lad in a wagon - won't it start the bleeding," said Harrie, anxiously, for he would now have given worlds had he never fired his gun at the young Indian.. "Safe!' I reckon Injuns don't die so easy; -but I won't run any risks with him. You just' hitch on the horses and I'll have him ready- in' a minute." And laying the head tenderly in Mar- garet's lap, he began peering -round among the bushes,. plucking here and there a leaf and bruis- ing them in his horny fingers. Then carefully removing the bandage, he probed the wound with his knife as skillfully as a surgeon, and pressing it gently, he put on the compress he had made of' the herbs, and bandaging it up, first with Marga- ret's linen handkerchief, and then with- her ging- ham apron, he called Mr. Belden; and the two lift- ed the sufferer into the wagon, and disposed their coats and Margaret's shawl about him so as to make him a soft resting place. "He'll do now; it's only a flesh wound and not bad, though he might have bled to death if I hadn't a-come; but my opinion is he'd been up and off in two hours if we'd a-gone and left him. Injuns are great at possum-playing. It's hard telling when they are dead. But come. The sun is crawling along mighty fast; and it's a dark moon," and they all climbed into the wagon and drove off as fast as they dared.   &#xD;<pb n="34-35" xml:id="VAC7838-00000018"/> 34: -  THE PET OF THE SETTTME1-NT. For a mile or two, the Indian boy seemed to sleep quietly, then he moaned as in pain and then opened his eyes and gave another wild, startled look about him. Again did Uncle Billy whisper to him in Sac, and again moisten his lips from the flask, and then Margaret, as kindly as though he was her brother by the same parent, lifted the cover from the pail of strawherries and plucking some of the sweetest and ripest from their stems held them to his mouth. He swalled them eager- ly, and then closing his eyes, seemed to sleep. Meanwhile the little stranger, the baby-girl, who twice that day had escaped with its life as by a miracle, had awakened, and after being fed with some biscuit soaked in milk, was content to sit up on Margaret's or Harrie's lap, and would clap its little dimpled hands and crow, as though a mother held it. Once in awhile it would nestle its little head, all golden with soft curls, upon Margaret's bosom, and say playfully, ma- ma ma - ma," and then it would pull Harrie's dark locks and cry "da -da- da-da." Final- ly, just as the sun went out of sight, its head drooped and its eyelids closed, and soon the measured breathing told them it was fast asleep. "Precious babe," murmured Margaret, as she kissed its coral lips, "would I could lay you now on your mother's heart. Do you suppose, Uncle Billy, we shall ever unravel this day's adventures. I seem to be reading fiction, instead of living a reality. I little dreamed, when in such jubilant spirits I sprang into the wagon this morning, that the day was to be so eventful, that we should save so precious and beautiful ia life, and then spill blood. Do you think," and she looked "ear- nestly at the old man," we shall ever know how and why all this happened."    HAERRIE'S SHOT.      35 "Aye, darter," and he pointed significantly to the sleeping Indian lad. "Have patiencc; I waited five years to know why my little gal was carried off, but I found it out arter awhile. All things come out, if you only wait. I reckon now, Mr. Belden, you can drive a little faster, I don't like that roaring abit," a heavy clap of thun- der was reverberating over the Des Moines tim- ber, and darkness settling over sky and prairie. The horses were put on a trot. Harrie took off his vest and laid it over the wounded limb carefully, and then disposed the coats and shawls so as to make the young Indian's bed softer than before. Margaret took up the skirt of her calico dress and wound it about the child, and then- rested her head on her brother's shoulder. Uncle' Billy left his place on the wagon bed and seated himself beside Mr. Belden. And then they drove on as rapidly as they dared, but without a word being spoken.   &#xD;<pb n="36-37" xml:id="VAC7838-00000019"/> CHAPTER IV. THE twilight deepened and it soon grew so dark that Mr. Bdlden could oily see to guide his horses by the occasional flashes of lightning. J' I think I'd better give you the reins, Uncle Billy," said he, as a brighter streak revealed to him their vicinity to a dangerous slough. "I dare not attempt to-cross this in the night." Unole Billy changed places, and the horses after sundry hard plunges succeeded in crossing the dank marsh, and then trotted on at a more rapid pace than heretofore. Margaret had just  fallen into an uneasy doze, in which wild and  i startling perils of border life seemed to flit in kaleidoscope confusion before her eyes, when  she, was aroused by the exclamation of Uncle Billy, "What on airth is up, now," and lifting  her head from Harrie's shoulder, and tossing back her sun-bonnet she looked eagerly forward. Lights seemed dancing in the south, close to the ground, too, and a confused murmur met her ear, but whether, it were shrieks or shouts which drifted on the breeze, she could hardly tell. "What do you think it is?" said Mr. Belden to the old man beside him, for the whole party felt that he was their chief reliance. "Hadn't we better turn back? Are they not Indians?" "No," said Uncle Billy; "red skins make a 88   ANOTHER MYSTERY.      37 ' tee-total different noise; you'd know it, if you'd a-heerd their hellish whooping as many a time as I've. My 'pinion is, they're some of our settlers, but what they're out this time o'night for- that's what I'd like to know. There's some deviltry up-that's sure." And giving the lash to the horses, he bade Mr. Belden and Harrie look to their fire-arms, "as to my old never-fail," laying a caressing hand on the lock of his rifle, ' she is allers in trim."  "This suspense is terrible," murmured Mar- garet, as thy drew nearer the lights and noise. "O, that I were safe in my childhood's home.' "Sh - sh- sis, be a brave girl now; aint we all ready to do our best to save you from peril," whispered Harrie, kissing her cold brow. "If you'd been away back east to-day- what would  have become of this little stranger. There's a Providence, as old Aunt Bessie would say, in our being here." They had by this time advaned far enough to see that the lights were torches and lanterns, and that some ten or a dozen men and boys on horse-back, were drawing near. "Halloa," cried one, darting from the group and giving spurs to his horse till it bore him to the spot where the sound of the rumbling wagon wheels roceeded, "is that you, Uncle Billy?"  "Aye, aye, and that's you, Tom Symmes, is it? What's up?"  "That's what we want to know, deviltry is doing some of its blackness just now. But are you all safe? the new comers, the gentleman, the lad and the young lady."  "All, Tom, but what's up?" 4         -           I  &#xD;<pb n="38-39" xml:id="VAC7838-00000020"/> 38    THE PET OF THE SETTTLEMENT. By this time, the two parties'had met entire- ly, and there was a perfect Babel of tongues,  each one trying to outdo his neighbor in rapidity of utterance.  "Now, dry up, every soul of ye," said Uncle ' i Billy, gruffly, " who on airth can make out ,what  you want to tell; you cackle like so many wild  geese. You, Tom Symmes, ride beside us, and  tell us what's to pay. But first, is all well in the  settlement, or are we to turn back." "All's well, there," shouted half a dozen, "and  you're to come on as quick as you can. We only came to see if you were all safe."  Well we are, so ride back and tell some of the  women to go to cooking as quick as they can, for we are all mighty hungry, and now, Tom, let's hear."  In a very straightforward way, the young man told a story that curdled the blood of Margaret as she listened.  It seemed that Johnny Pease, of Pease Branch,  a settlement of some five miles below Uncle Bil- ly's, had gone that morning shortly after sunrise into the timber, after a load of rails to build apig pen with, for a black bear had the night before carriedoff his fattest hog. As he passed a little thicket of plum trees which grew on the edge of the timber, about a mile from his cabin, he heard something that sounded to him strangely like a huiman voice uttering feeble cries of pain. He listened, but the sound was not repeated,. "Didn't go and look what it was," said Uncle Billy, "the cowardly sneak. I reckon I'd gone by any thing, when I heerd sich a noise,". And he drove on, loaded up his rails, and was passing by the same spot, when a voice, he could '   ANOTHER MYSTERY.      39 not be mistaken this time, a human voice cried out, for God's sake, help me." Johnny, more dead than alive, stopped his horses, and crawled through the tangled underbrush till he came to a little open glade, a grassy spot of a few yards in circumference. But what a sight met his eyes: A white men, completely naked, lay in a pool of his own blood, fearful wounds gaping in his breast and legs. "Quick," cried he, hoarsely, as his dim eyes, wandering over the wild scene, met Johnny's startled gaze. "Give me something to keep life up till I tell you." Johnny's whisky bottle was at theiying man's mouth in an instant, and then lifting the head on his bosom, he bent his ear to the white lips and listened. "I am murdered - my wife - my little child cyTried off -he, George   " there was a spasm of the mouth, and the eyes rolled fearfully. Johnny's bottle was again applied, -and as the lips resumed their wonted curves, he whispered, "Who did it, and where?" "Here;" murmured the man hoarsely, "at day. light. God forgive him; his name is George "but another spasm, more violent than the former, checked his utterance, and as it passed off, Johnny saw 'that the eyes t ere set. He moistened the lips and chafed the jaws, and beg- ged of him to speak once more. Suddenly, when he was lying so still that the watcher thduglit him dead, his rigid face relaxed for an instant, and a holy light seemed to radiate from the eyes, and whispering, "But I forgive I forgive- for he loved her-God help her my Mary- my little Allie, my babe"- he passed away with- . out a struggle. Not daring to leave the corpse to go home for   &#xD;<pb n="40-41" xml:id="VAC7838-00000021"/> 40    THE PET OF THE SETTLEMENT. &amp; assistance, lest some wild animal should prey upon i it, or the hidden murderer steal it from sight, Johnny fired off his rifle three times in succes. i sion, the settler's signal of danger, and had soon  the satisfaction of seeing his two neighbors comrn-  ing toward him at full gallop, while the women ; and children of the settlement followed on foot.*i With the aid of the men, a way was cleared    through the thicket, and the body of the murder. ed stranger brought out to the road, and being reverently covered with the womens aprons, was laid onthe team and borne to the nearest cabin. i "We must consult Uncle Billy," was the unani t mous voice of the little settlement; and accord- ingly Johnny, and the women and children piled into one:;eam, and started for the Boone Branch,  as the little stream was called, -near which Uncle Billy had reared his cabin seven years before, ,when there was not a white-face' within fifty miles. The.-other two men, with the corpse, were to follow in the cool of the afternoon. "And not one of them, I'll be bound, ever. stopped to look up or follow the trail of the mur- derer, and there was dew on the timber yet- there must have. been - and it could have been found so easy I Just like 'em, though-some folks, never do. think o' nothing till they're told.

There's a mighty sight to be did yet, ye know - that poorman has got to be buried, and there's no coffin made or grave dug, or any thing fixed for sich work." "Wa'll, it's kinder queer,"' murmured the old man. "When I arriv' here, seven years ago, I picked out a place for a buryin' yard right off, and there hain't from that day to this, been a funeral, and now the first one laid there must be a stranger who nobody knows. I thought It'd a-been me; but so it is. I aint much any more and he likely was but where can his wife and baby be, that he spoke on." He clapped his hands on his knees, and giving the reins ,to Mr. Belden, crawled over the sleeping Indian to the back part of the wagon where Margaret sat, and putting one hand on her shoulder and one on the little stranger, he whispered earnestly, "I b'lieve, darter, it'll come out soon, all of it. I b'lieve you're got the child and they the- father. There's a connection, you may depend." "But the poor mother," sighed Margaret. "Don't, darter, don't lisp of her, my old blood'll be up if you do, for there's deviltry at the bottom of all this ;" and returning, to his seat, he whistled to the horses,- and in about half an hour " whoa'd" to them. "Our day is over," cried he, as he leaped from the wagon.  W e're back, safe and sound. Hal- loa there, you inside, take down those blankets and let us see a bit." He was obeyed, and Margaret, as the old man landed her safely at the fence, saw through the open doorway that the hearth was all in a glow with a generous fire, and that several women were flitting about the room.

"Maircy--maircy,' screamed old Mrs. Sym- mes, and her tones were echoed by half a dozen, "what have you got. But sit down, you poor child,- here,' and she led the fainting girl to a  trunk, and took the bundle from her; but a loud- er scream ran through the room and out into the darkness, as the. scarlet cloak fell off, and the babe, the little sundy-haired creature, opened its  blue eyes and looked her in the face.,  The women flocked about her, and a scene of wild confusion was enacted. In the midst of it,  Uncle Billy, with Mr. Belden and Harrie, entered, bearing between them the body of the Indian lad. This sight, of course, heightened the con- fusion, and fear, as well as amazement, now play- ed its part, hysterical sobs now gushing from each of the lookers on. "Dry up," said Uncle Billy, sternly, when the body had been deposited on the couch of skins. "Dry up, I say. Aint ye shamed, ye old border women, that's lived through many an Injun fight, to tear on at this rate, when nothin' has hurt any of you. Dry up, and take yourselves off, every last soul of you, to grandma Symmes' cabin, and I'll come over soon, and tell you all about it, and how it happened. Clear," and he motioned to the door in so authoritative a way, that they were soon out of it, and lost to sight in the darkness. "'And now, darter," said he, going up to poor Margaret, I see old grandma has got the coffee a-going and the pone a-browning- you just rise up a little and get yourself and us a mouthful, ,                 ,   ANOTkEiR MYSTERY.      43 and then go right to bed, and forget all about this day's, work. Come now, be a soger, darter;ye've did first rate to-day. I 'spected ye'd a swooned away intirely afore now. Harrie'll stay by, and yer father and I'll put out the horses and milk the cow." By an almost superhuman effort, Margaret,lift. ed her head from her hands, and then rose to her feet. The table was already set, and there was nothing for her to do but pour the coffee-into the urn, and turn out the corn-cake.  "Grandma has been very thoughtful," she said. "I'm sorry Uncle Billy spoke to her so cross; it was no wonder she was amazed when she saw the- baby. Dear me, but she has even done the milk- ing and strained it all for me, and brought in the eggs; bless her; she's like a mother." And then warming some of the new milk, she took the child from Harrie and fed it carefully, and after lulling it to sleep in her arms, laid it gently on her bed and drew the sheets closely around it, murmuring gently, "God have mercy on your poor mother's heart, for it must ache sorely this night." "And now, darter," said Uncle Billy, bustling in, " give us a bite o' supper, and then yer father and me'll have to be off awhile to see to this yer business," and drawing up a trunk, he fell to eat- ing as though nothing had happened. The repast over, he went up to the Indian lad, and after feeling his pulse awhile, turned. about, saying calmly, "he'll do now. Her, Harrie, you must stand sentinel till we come back, walking all the time between the two doors, and mind, if you think you hear any thing, fire right off, and we'll be in mighty fast.

And he and Mr. Belden started off to the  next cabin.    CHAPTER V. THE ANXIOUS NIGHT.   SCARCELY had the voices of Mr. Belden and' Uncle Billy died away in the distance, ere the bed-quilt, that shrouded the south entrance, was slowly lifted, and a dark form crossed the thresh- old. "Stand," cried Hlarrie, presenting his gun. "Stand, or you are a dead man." "A dead woman, you mean, bud," said the pleasant and cheery voice of old grandma Sym- mes. "Don't be. scared, dear," seeing that Mar: garet had sunk upon the floor with a face white: as death, "and never you mind, Harrie," as he. apologized: again and again for his rude salutation,' "you did right-,just right.- I hope you'll always obey orders as well as you did this time, for if it- had been a red skin, -he'd a-whisked your scalp- off without waiting for ceremonies.

I've been awaiting there ever so long for Uncle Billy to leave, 'cause I know he'd make all sorts of fun of me and my doctor's stuff, 'cause he hain't got no opinion of either. He's always a&amp;saying'if folks would only eat and drink what they ort to, and behave themselves like God meant they should, they'd be well enough and never die till their time come, and I don't' know but he's half right; that is, I believe what he says. is: good for men, but dear me, poor women, with all they have to go through with, can't get along so; they must now and then have a doctor and some medicine, too. Come, dear," and she tenderly assisted the half-fainting girl to her feet, and led her behind the sheets, " let me undress you and help you to bed, and then I'll fix you a glass of cordial, and it'll put you to sleep so good, and I'll fix something for that sweet little baby, too. Dear me, but how could it have come way out there on that prairie. Ye must tell me all about it to-morrow. There, now lie down," as she tied the cap-strings under Margaret's chin, and buttoned her night-dress, and going to a shelf, she took, down a tumbler, half filled it with water, sweetened it with loaf sugar, and then turned'in about two table-spoonfuls of the sooth- ing cordial. "Here, dear, drink this, and you'll soon be cozy and dreaming of angels;" and she placed the glass to Margaret's lips. With but little con- fidence in its efficacy, the latter drained it to satisfy the kind-hearted old woman, and then lay- ed down, her evening prayer hovering on her lips, though no words escaped her. "And now,   THE ANXIOUS NIGHT.     47 I 'll take up this little one and loosen its clothes and feed it, and I guess then it won't disturb you till daylight ;" and as gently as she used to handle her own little innocents, - those fair-haired babes who had slept for so many long years under the green grass of Indiana - she lifted the little one ftom its pillow, and bore it to the fireside. A full hour she sat there, bathing its little dimpled limbs, feeding it with sweetened milk, and lulling it with baby hymns; then placing it beside Mar- garet, who had long been in a quiet sleep, she turned to the Indian lad, who was tossing rest- lessly upon his pillow. "He's got a white heart, I suppose; as white as ever my own boys had, and I ought to feel kinder Christian towards him too, I suppose, but I can't - the red skin - still it's too bad tow see him lie there suffering and nothing being done for him." And with the bet- ter feelings of humanity surgingabove her preju- dices, she gently loosened the bandage about his wound, re-adjusted the compress and bound it up anew, and then prepared for him  a healing draught similar to that she had given Margaret. There was potency in her kindly ministrations, for he grew quiet and slept. "And now, son, I should like to do something for you," addressing Harrie, who, with a noiseless step, had been all this time patroling the room. u-"Hadn't you bet. ter lie down awhile and let me keep your watch. I 've stood sentry many a time since I 've been in this country, and I used to do so when I was' young, and lived in a new settlement in Indiana. Come," and she placed her hand on his gun. But Harrie drew proudly back. 'No, no, grandma, I should never make a plo. neer, if I suffered an old lady like you to relieve  &#xD;<pb n="48-49" xml:id="VAC7838-00000025"/> 48    THE PET OF THE SETTLEMTNT. my;;watch before it had lasted two hours. No; you go home and rest now, for weoshall want ypu bright and smart to-morrow, for ith be a stirring day here. There 'll be the. funeral, you know, and like as not an attack from the Indians, and I don't- know what all, and our old, experienced. emigrants must be on hand to tell us new ones how toact." And again shouldering his gun, he walked steadily to. and fro. . His words -pleased the old lady, who, like most I aged people, liked to be thought a necessity in every event that happened about them, :and bid-: ding him a kindly good night; she lifted the bed- qiilt and withdrew as noiselessly as she had en- tered. i Light was dawning in the east, ere Margaret opened her eyes. So sound and sweet had been her sleep, and so fall of beautiful dreams, that she could hardly--at first realize her surroundings/ and she. glanced half-expectantly about. her, as if she thought her eyes would meet the rich adorn-, ings of her olden home. Dimly) like some half. remembered fancy:came back to her memory the events of yesterday, and she was fast: dropping off again into a light, doie, when the 'patting of a baby's hand upon her breast, and the cooings of a baby's lips upon her cheek, recalled her fully to her actual life, and rising in her bed- she lifted the little waif and held it fondlyi to her heart, murmuring over it the sweetest terms of endear- ment. It gave back smile for smile, and then be- gan its musical maxma, ma-m  a,-- da-da,-da-da,- and finally reached forth its little hand for the :up of milk that stood upon the trunk. Margaret held it to its lips, and it was soon all drank, when -              , /    THE ANXIOUS NIGHT.      49* it cuddled down closely to her bosom, and while she gently toyed with its soft, sunny curls, and whispered to it that sweet old lullaby, " hush my. babe, lie still and slumber," it closed its blue eyes again and slept. Placing it on a pillows she carefully drew aside one of the sheets and looked out.- It was yet twilight in the cabin, but she could discern things pretty clearly after a moment's gaze. Stretched at full length before the south threshold, lay Un- cle Billy, with his " never-fail" close beside him, one finger resting upon its trigger. Before the north one lay her father, with a brace of pistols on his breast, and his gun beside him. 0n the couch of skins slumbered Harrie and the Indian lad, Harrie's gun hanging just above his head, while a pistol was firmly clutched- in. one hand. The fire had evidently been rekindled many times, for a bright bed of coals was glowing on the hearth-stone, while the tea-kettle was singing its matin hymn with a most lusty voice. "Thank God," said Margaret, reverently, clasp- ing her hands and looking upward, " all has been quiet, and no blood yet shed. O, may it be so ever," and rising, she quietly dressed herself and stole out from her little recess, and stepping noiselessly over Uncle Billy, lifted the quilt and went out into the fresh morning air. The sun had not yet risen, but golden and crimson waves were surging in the east, and the intense blue of the midnight giving way to a sober grey, which here and there was streaked with, amber. A light wind was trailing over the prairie, bringing fragrance on every breath, and as it lifted the masses of hair which clung to her forehead and neck, it seemed to waft new life over the maiden's  5  &#xD;<pb n="50-51" xml:id="VAC7838-00000026"/> ,-50   THE PET OF THE SETTLEMENT. form, as she stood erect and queenly upon the wet grass, and seemed to drink in the incense and the glory of the morning. She held her pocket- Bible in her hands, and opening it at the Psalms, she run over a few chapters hastily, and then closing it, she drew one hand across her eyes, and seemed laying what she had read to heart. Then she knelt down and breathed forth her morning prayer, and then, as though too happy to keep silent, her lips involuntarily carolled a few musical notes, and she might have sang on till the hymn was closed, but that she thbught all at once of the sleepers inside, and'hushed her voice and completed her simple toilet, bathing her face and * hands in the trough, and combing up her rich hair without the aid of other -mirror than the clear rain water. Quietly stealing back, she commetnced her pre- parations for the morning meal. The -corn pone was turned into the skillet'and set down to bake, and. she was measuring out her coffee, when a smothered groan struck sadly on her ear. ,She turned, and beheld the eyes of the Indian lad looking wistfully on her. She hastened to him, and as tenderly as though he' were a brother, placed her soft hand on his forehead. It was hot and feverish, while his lips were parched and his pulse quick. "You suffer", she said, sweetly, ; "I ill help you," and going to the well, she drew up some cold water, and returning with it to his bedside, first gave him some to drink and then gently loved his head and hands, after awhile, folding a soft linen napkin, and wetting it thor. oughly and placing it upon his brow. She did not know it, but that cool, fresh water, dripping down his brown neck and rippling over his brown , *  *,        t      :'   THE ANXIOUS NIGHT.      51, skin, beneath which his red heart was palpitating, was a baptism to the lad. The pure-blooded In- dian is ever grateful for a kindness, and the young "White Cloud" then and there, swore in his soul that he would dwell no more with his red friends, but be as a brother to the White Dove, who bent so kindly over his sick couch. The few words of English he had learned at odd times from intercourse with Uncle Billy and the ad- venturous hunters, he softly murmured now, and his simple "you- good;-me--glad; me - once bad - me good now ;" sunk into the heart of Margaret as never before had gratefil or peni- tent words, for she felt that his whole heart was in them. Gently clasping his hands, she folded them above his breast, and whispering, "I'll help you all I can, my brother," she breathed over him the Lord's prayer. As she ceased, he looked into her face and said earnestly, "mnore, She repeated it, when to her great joy -his own lips moved, and he said, distinctly, "Our Father," and then a sweet smile flashed over his face, and murmuring some words in Sac, he turned his head away and closed his eyes. O thought Margaret, as she turned to'her morn- ing duties, if I can but bring that boy to my own God--teach him to pray, sing, read, worship- surely I shall not have lived in vain. Mayhap, there is a mission for me yet on earth, though never can I bear the holy names of 'wife and mother, and dashing some big tears from her eyes, she went bravely to her work. Breakfast was upon the table ere -one of the sleepers stirred, but the rattling of the tea-spoons as Margaret, in a moment of forgetfulness, slip- ped them carelessly into the saucers, roused Mr. Belden, and he started wildly to his feet.  &#xD;<pb n="52-53" xml:id="VAC7838-00000027"/> 52    THE PET OPF THE Sl"tJLRVMNT. . "Don't be scared, father, it's only I," said she, pleasantly. "Only you I And is it possible you have been able to prepare breakfast without awaking us. We are poor sentinels I fear. The Indians might have carried us off bodily, at this rate, and we never have known it till we felt their scalping knife."' "I reckon not," said Uncle Billy, drawing up first one leg snd then the other, and rubbing them briskly ere he lifted himself from the floor. "I reckon I've heard all that your darter has been /  doing; but I didn't think it wise to open my eyes till now. I reckon a red-skin wouldn't have Stepped over me as she did three or four times, without being tripped up and coming down ker n wuhack with a broken head. No, no.

But come, let's have breakfast over, for we've a heap of work to do to-day.'"And he aroused Harrie, aind the three having washed in the trough, seated themselves at'the table. When they were all helped, Margaret looked earnestly at her father, and said, ' Now tell me about last night. I am ashamed to say I slept so soundly that I never knew when you came home. Did you see the dead man? Was there any at. tack from the Indians? Was  " "One'at a time," dear, answered Mr. Belden. "Yes, we saw the dead man, and from there went to another cabin and met the whole settlement in council.

Uncle Billy agrees with me ir: all my conclusions, and so I think do all who heard them. We resolved, too, that the dead man should have as decent a burial as .we could give him, and appointed five o'clock this afternoon for the funeral hour. Then we set sentries in every cabin, and a couple on the edge of the timber, and after patrolling around -them till near two o'clock, we came in and relieved tHarrie, and as nothing happened for an hour, I went quietly to sleep- Uncle Billy it- seems didn't.

A nd the old man ate awhile in silence. Then he said abruptly, "but he does- and never complains, either. Shows he's a better man than me. It's time I tried to be good." The rest of the meal was eaten in silence, and it was scarcely over, ere half a dozen men walked in with the freedom of neighbors. "What's up," said Uncle Billy. "Why I reckon when you said we should give him, the poor dead man, a decent funeral, you didn't think about coffin stuff.

We can cushion it, you know, and make it soft, though the poor fellow would rest just as well, I spose, if it was left hard--but then I couldn't feel easy my- self about it." And he dashed a tear from his cheek. "Nor could I," said Uncle Billy. "Dead folks should have a soft bed to lie down on, for it's a long while they have to lie. No more getting up early in the morning for them, when they once have the sod on their hearts. I did think about the coffin, though. I reckon perhaps you don't know that I've had for two years in my cabin- loft, some as nice --black walnut boards as you ever see. I got 'eri once when I went to mill, and I brought 'em home, and said nothing to no- body, 'cause I allers meant they should hold me, when I was laid straight, and I've shaped them and planedothem, and all they want is to be put together.

He shall have them, and a place to lie, too, on my own ground," and he turned quickly from the men and went to"the bed of the Indian boy,: and commenced re-dressing his wounded limb.  \ ..  &#xD;<pb n="56-57" xml:id="VAC7838-00000029"/> d "   CHAPTER VI L THE BURIAL AND THE CHRISTENING. IT wa's a busy and exciting day in the little set- tlement; how much so can only be imagined by those who have lived in border land, the only spot we have yet found where the brotherhood of men is recognized as an actual as well 'as an ideal thing. At an early hour the women and children gathered in at the cabin of Mr. Belden to see the little stranger, who had been so provi- dentially rescue-d from the prairie, and to listen to Marga-ret's -recital of the way in which she found her. Nor were they merely idle listeners,b for one matron took hold in earnest and did "up sthe work; another hulled the gathered strawher- ries, and then, carefully weighing themin, taught largaret how to preserve them for future use, another ran home and brought over some baby- clothes that had longlaid unused in the bottom  -ofher- chest, and strippingthe little waif of its own soiled ones, dressed it neatly in those she had brought, and then fetching the tub, she washed, rinsed and starched its own, that they might be readytfor it to wear to the funeral, as they were pretty and more costly far than hers; another ripped up a soft white lute-string dress of Margaret's, and neatly ironed 'out the plaits; own oil ones, dressd it e   THE BURIAL AND THE CHRISTENING.   i another moulded biscuits and made cake and pie; another dressed Chickens and stuffed them; another cut up ham and shelled early peas, and washed greens and lettuce, for Mr. Belden had invited them all to dine with him,'knowing that they all longed to be together, while old grandma Symmes and the stranger women from theither settlement bustled about here, there, and every- where, doing up the odds and ends. As for Mar. garet, she sat all the forenoon on the coudh of the Indian boy, now tending the little babe, who clung with child-like love to her, and then-nurs- ing the poor sufferer, who seemed to regard her with the reverence men give to angelic beings. At noon, a sumptuous repast was ready, to which all, men, women and children, were invited.  Table cloths were spread upon the grass in front of the cabin; dishes, knives and forks and spoons were brought from each household, and the plain,. but excellent food, neatly cooked, was served up in such abundance, that double the number might have eaten. There was no hilarity at the meal, but. there was that subdued, solemn cheerfulness, which ever accompanies the performance of sad duties. They had never known the stranger, and of course could not mourn for him as though he had, been called from their own midst; but he belonged to them in another sense, and they were happy, that since he had met so wierd-a fate, it was where they could give him Christian burial. So there were smiles instead of tears, and pleas- ant, eager talk, instead of sobbing- murmurs. The little babe was' brought out and shown to all, and as it laughed and crowed to see them, they said with one accord, "I am so glad it was not lost." And one after another of those rude pip -^     ^  &#xD;<pb n="58-59" xml:id="VAC7838-00000030"/> 58  -  THE PET OF THE SETTLEMENT. neers took the little thing in their rough -hands, and after dandling it a moment, cuddled it close-, ly to their bosoms and pressed their lips to its fair cheeks. As Uncle Billy gave it back to Margaret, a sudden thought seemed to strike him, and he said earnestly, " my friends, we are to have a burial at five-.that baby's father is, to go to his last home - whether or not it has a mother, God only knows. Something must be done for it. What shall it be?"       - Mr. Belden, Margaret and Harrie would have spoken, but he motioned them to keep silent. Scarcely a moment passed ere they all, men, wo- men and children, cried out, "Keep it, keep it always."- And then one after another added, I'll do my part, I'll do my part." ,". I knew what you would say," said the old man, wiping his eyes. "And now I say, let us, after the funeral is over, all go down to the spring and have the baby christened. "And what shall we callit T?" said the women, and each was proposing their favorite name, when grandma Symmes spoke up and said, "'I think Miss Margaret should have the naming, for she first saved it."    : "Yes, so she should," said all, and listened to hear what she would call it. "I think, said she, "you told ine the dying man spoke of his little Allie. Let us then call her Allie -Allie, the Pet of the Settlement- that will give us all a claim upon her love, while, if her mother-yet lives and should ever come to see her, she Would wish to call her by the name she and her husband gave her when she was all their own. Allie would come naturally to her lips. W hat say you? Shall it be so?" i.               '   THE BURIAL AND THE CHRISTENING.  59 ( Yes, yes," rejoined they all, while Margaret gracefully bowing to them, said kindly, "Let me then make you all acquainted with your little  Allie, the Pet of the Settlement." *   *  *   ,X, X  *  * "Your hands are used to dainty work, sis," said Harrie, drawing her one side, " do come and trim the coffin. They have left that to me, say- ing they knew nothing about it. I have lined it with cambric, but I can never plait that silk on as it should be. Do come and do it."  For an instant Margaret shrank from complying with his wish. It seemed too terrible to her, but it was only for an instant. Calming' her nerves, she said quietly, "I will go and help you;" and taking the white lutstring dress which had been ripped up, and which had once graced her own delicate form as she stood beside a bride in friend- ly office, she went over with him to the cabin where the coffin had been made. Once there, she threw her whole heart inta the work, and the soft silk was soon neatly plaited about the sides. "It needs'something for a finish," said she, " and I have no. ribbon or quilling, what shall I do?" And she leaned her head upon the bed 'and thought. But she soon lifted it and said, "Bring me violets and roses; set the children to gather- ing them." A basket full was soon beside her, and culling the freshest, she dexterously wove them about the edges of the lining, encircling the whole coffin with a chaste, but exquisitely beauteous wreath.   I "Will it do?" she asked, hesitatingly of her father, who had come in just as she had finished. He did not speak in answer, but he wiped his eyes and turned aside.  &#xD;<pb n="60-61" xml:id="VAC7838-00000031"/> ;  60  THE PET OF THE SETTLEMENT. One of, Mr. Belden's best linen shirts and a snow-white summer suit had been carried over early in the morning. The corpse was now ar- rayed in them and carefully placed in the coffin. Then Margaret drew- near, and looked for the first time upon it. It was a noble-looking man in life's early prime who lay there, and as she smooth. ed the dark masses of hair and put them off his high forehead, she wept sadly over him. "No wife -no mother here," she murmured, and then darting away, she flew, rather than run home, and with the same speed came back with the baby in her arms. "No   wife'-no mother here," said she, "but thanks be to God, a daughter shall foI- ' low you to the grave." Anduncovering the face she held Allie- towards- it. "Da-da; dada;" cried the   little one, and almost sprang from her arms. She laid its little cheek close to the white one of the dead. It shrank, but only for a moment; then it patted it, strove to open the closed eyes, and pulled play- fully at the hair, cooing all the-while in the sweetest tones. "She knows him, and our surmises are all true," said Margaret. "It is her father," and as if to corroborate all they had guessed, when they took it from the coffin, it cried and sobbed as though its little heart would break. And after it had been finally soothed to sleep, it would breathe such- long, sad sighs, that Margaret almost re- gretted her experiment. It was a   lovely afternoon. A golden light Iay on the Des M-oines woodland and on the green prairie that skirted it, melting into a sil- very haze as it stretched eastward. All nature   THE BURIAL AND THE CHRISTENING.  61 -seemed clothed in more than usual beauty, as if it rejoiced in the summer sun, and would woo it to shed a brighter glory still. Earth, air, and sky, appeared instinct with a calm; softened, heart-filling peace and hope.-a tranquil joy in. deed which drove out from the restless spirit all petty care, and led it to look upward through the "golden vistas unto heaven." There was a richer accent to the melody of the birds, though their song was more subdued than in the morning, and there was a gentle, soul touching- music in the i low rustling of the leaves and in the voices of the wind as it swept over the-wild flowers and soft green turf. "A beautiful time to die," murmured Mar- garet, as she stood at the gateway, with the child in her arms, waiting for the bier to come. "A beautiful time to lie down under the sod. I al-- most wish it were myself, for earth seems now to stand upon heaven's portals. To die," she said, half sadly, " what is it?" a    ' "To the ood, the true, it is but to enter heaven," said a voice at her side. With a wild scream floating to her lips, Mar- garet turned to see whence came the sounds, but a deathly faintness clutched her heart and she sank on the grass too blind to see- even the child upon her bosom. When she recovered herself and looked about her, there was no one to be seen. And when she staggered to the cabin and looked in, only the Indian boy was there, and he calmly sleeping. "I must have dreamed it, and yet it seemed very real. Be still my heart," and she pressed it passionately, " will you never give me peace?' and then she hid herself upon her bed and wres. 6 /, '       d  &#xD;<pb n="62-63" xml:id="VAC7838-00000032"/> ,62  . THE PET OF THE SETT'EMENT. tled with--her agony. But when te bier came along, and she went forth to follow it, she was calm and self-possessed, and though her cheeks were a shade paler, none- dreamed of the misery that had so lately crushed her.. It was a solemn, heart-moving scene, that little band of pioneers, men, women and children fol- lowed that murdered stranger to his grave. Mr. , Belden and Uncle Billy walked first; then came ' the bier, whose rude workmanship was shrouded from sight by one of those snowy damask cloths which had once graced the festive board of an eastern home; then followed Margaret with the fatherless child upon her breast, both clothed in the purest white; then the women and the little children, and afterwards the men. It was not far to the grave, which had been dug in the shadow of an olden oak, whose rustling leaves had for a century or more changed the wind t music. ;They were soon there. The coffin was set down, and the little group disposed them- selves as they thought fit, some leaning against the trunks of the surrounding trees, others nest- ling on the sward, and others standing motionless beside the grave. Margaret sought the mossy root of a stately elm some little distance from the rest, where she sat down, half shadowed by the over-hanging boughs, though here and there a brilliant gleam pierced through the leafy net- work, shedding a golden glory about her and her fairyoung charge. -She had not asked who would perform the ser- vice, supposing of couirse her father would; he being the only educated man in the-settlement ; and now, as the silence of death stole over all things, she revently bowed her head.   THE BURIAL AND THE CHRISTE]NING. 63 But lower, lower still does it sink, till it rests heavily on the babys bosom, for -the same voice that had whispered to her at the gateway, now sounded on the air in clear, rich, mellow tones: "-But now is Christ risen fromthe dead, and become the first fruits of them that slept. For since by man came death, by man came also the resurrection of the dead." Not until the chapter was read, the fervent prayer uttered, and the text given out-" as we have borne the image of the earthy, we shall also - bear the image of the heavenly," did Margaret lift her bowed head, and ghastly white was her face then. Eagerly she looked toward the speak- eir. He stood at the head of the coffin, leaning uipon a staff, and was apparently a middle-aged man - a hunter priest -- for his whole dress was . of tanned deerskin, while Indian mocassins were  on his feet. Masseg of coal-black hair fell upon his shoulders and shaded his olive brow, while a beard of the same dark hue hung down his breast. Margaret sought to catch his eye, but it was fastened on the- white face before him, nor did he lift it but to look upward. For awhile she sat fascinated by his voice, his thrilling voice, every accent of which awoke to throbbing life memories she had long sought to deaden, but soon in spite of her a itation, she listened, not so much to the words as to the thoughts, the grand, glorious, soul-inspiring  thoughts the strange speaker uttered; and when he pronounced the fervent amen, she felt almost as though she had i been borne to heaven, -as though she were no longer of the earth, earthy, but of heaven, heavenly. w There was a few moments pause, and then he  &#xD;<pb n="64-65" xml:id="VAC7838-00000033"/> "   THE PET OF THE SETTLEMENTo spake again. "All who would look upon the face of our deceased brother once more, will please come forward."' One after another drew near and passed away. Last of all came Margaret with the sleeping babe. One moment she held it to the cold face and then turned aside, so tremulous with emotion she could scarcely clasp the little one. It even seemed- dropping from her arms, when she felt that it was taken from her, while she herself was gently assisted to her seat. Then the coffin was closed and lowered into the grave, and then, at a silent signal from Harrie the little- children came forward, each with an arm-ful of flowers, and reverently threw them on to the lid. -So many and thick and fresh were they, that when the first sods fell, instead of that heart-breaking sound which usually accompanies the first shovel-ful of earth, there stole upon the ear only a subdued, solemn tone -a sort of dirge- like music. One after another of the men stepped forward afid plied the busy spades till the grave was filled and neatly smoothed into shape.  Then the preacher, lifting the, little child which he had held. all the time in his arms, said to them, "In the name of this babe,-this babe whose father you have buried, I thank you for your Christian kindness. Our brother did not die among his kindred, but blessed be God, he was buried amongst friends. May the grace of heaven be with, you all."

A, few moments are spent in subdued conversa-   THE BURIAL AND THE CHRISTENING.  65 tion over the new-made grave, and then the little group re-form, and taking a narrow path through the woodland, wend their way to -a little 'i green spot in the wilderness," where the pure waters of a spring gush up and flow in soft, silvery streaks through the short turf. As they reached it and- halted, Margaret was startled to see the hunter-priest already there, but none of the others seemed surprised, and they all arranged them- selves speedily in a half circle about him. For a few moments he looked at them-silently, then in his clear, rich, mellow tones, he said, "Bring me the balbe." Margaret stepped forward, and how she never knew, reached the spring and held the babe to. wards him. He gently took it in his, arms, and saying kindly to her, What name? he bent his head to hear her whispered answer. Then kneel. ing beside the gushing waters, he dipped his hand in them, and sprinkling the drops upon the babe's brow, said reverently, "In the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, I christen this child. Allie, the Pet of the Settlement, thou shalt hence be called, and as those who have adopted thee now into their hearts and homes are true or false to thee, so may God bless or curse them. Let us pray."  And a most touching prayer went up to heaven from that forest altar. A moment's silence followed, and-then a strain of music floated after it, and that sweet hymn, "By cool Siloam's shady rill," was sung by the hunter-priest. Whence came her strength to do it she could not tell, but ere the second line-was finished, Margaret's voice blended with the first singer'sin the melody. Sweet and full it roe, and as his chimed in with his clear, rich, power- 6*  *  ,  &#xD;<pb n="66-67" xml:id="VAC7838-00000034"/> "'   THE PET OF THE SETTLEMENT. ful notes, the listeners might almost have fancied that heaven's portals were unclosed, and their souls floating there on the unseen waves of music. As the last word melted into silence, Margaret 'il felt the babe placed gently in her arms, but when, a moment after, she looked up from its fair face, he who had left it there, was nowhere to be seen.   CHAPTER VILi- THE SEARCH. EARLY the next morning, Mr. Belden, Uncle Billy and Jim Keene, another old and experienced hunter, started for Pease Branch, in hopes to get some clue to the mysterious murder, and if pos. sible, rescue the mother of little Allie, from the tragical fate which they had reason to fear await. ed the poor mourner. Under the guidance of Johnny Pease, they proceeded first to, the plum thicket, and examined carefully the little grassy spot where the dead man had met his sad and un- timely end. But their keenest search could dis- cover no marks of violence. The turf was as green and smooth and the violets as blue and beauteous as though the crimson foot of murder had never trampled there. Showers had fallen the night before and entirely washed away the blood stains, and none would have dreamed that the solitude had ever been disturbed by other than the tread of the red deer or the flight of the wild bird. "What shall we do, Uncle Billy?"' asked Keene, as the four stood resting on their rifles. "It looks like a hard case." "But I've seen harder ones, Jim., When my little gal, my purty Sally, was carried off, it was more 'an a. week afore I found the trail; But  &#xD;<pb n="68-69" xml:id="VAC7838-00000035"/> 68   THE PET OF THE SETTLEMENT. arter I'd once set out to look it up, do ye s'pose I ever stopped till I had it? No, sir. I didn't ask anybody what I should do, but I kept doing whatever'my sense and reason told me I ort to do, and the end of it was, I found the trail and t*te little gal too. And my boys, that's what we've got to do. That feller, whomsumever he was, that did up that bloody job and the poor man on whom' it was did, never dropt down -into this place. They came from somewhere and we must find out that somewhere and we'll never do it standing here. -We must first, every one of us, crawl back and forth through this thicket till we find out where they came in," and dropping -his rifle carefully, the old man began threading the tangled bushes, gliding in and out and curving about like some huge black snake performing its hideous evolutions. Keene and Pease followed his example at once, but Mr. Belden thrice made the circuit of the glade ere he entered the thicket; but then creep- ing on all fours-,he broke boldly -into the north- west corner and after crawling through several yards of almost impenetrable brush, had the satis- faction of coming to a narrow but perfectly clear pathway. The plum itrees grew upon each side and locked their boughs together overhead, so that he could not stand upright, but by stooping a little he could walk very easily. He had not proceeded many steps ere those he had left on the' other'side of the thicket were startled by a loud shout from him. Grasping their rifles they , hurried towards him, and when at length with scratched faces:and torn hands they stood beside hlmj, they forgot both pain and hurry in the satis. faction of knowing they had found the trail, for ^    '       ,   *  '  - '   THE SEARCH.       69 there stood Mr. Belden holding in his hands a blood-stained boot. "This came off the poor dead man," said Uncle Billy solemnly, as with gentle touch he handled the dark witness. "Yes, before he was fairly dead, they tore it off; but little did they think God above would make it swear agin them. Boys, we've nothin' to do now, but go on. Jist follow -this yer path, let it go where it will. It leads somewhere, and out of that somewhere come him we're arter- yes," and he lowered his voice, , and the poor fellow that"s gone up." Silently, cautiously, but with every nerve and sense on the alert, the four men, proceeded on their way. It was a painful, laborious and cir. cuitous route, yet never for a moment did they halt, not even to wipe off the great drops of per- spiration which the heat of the mid-day sun set- tled upon their brows and cheeks. ThaIy had gone thus nearly a mile and a half and had just reached one of the many bluffs which at this sec. tion of country, tower three and four hundred feet above the Des Moines, when in the distance behind them, there was heard the rush of gallop ing feet, the crackling of brnches and the vio. lent panting of some animal as in eager pursuit. "What upon airth is it, Uncle Billy," asked Keene, as they all came to a sudden halt. The old man threw off his huntinge cap and putting one hand to his right ear listened a half- moment. Then resuming his cap, he said earn- estly, "well, now, if I didn't know I had left my old hound chained up to hum, I should say it was him boundin' arter me.

"Sum on 'em at the settlement must have let him loose, for 'Pm sure I padlocked his chain. I reckon he howled and yelled till they had to, for the crittur is more 'Ah half human, and allers seems to know when I'm bound on a bad trail. Wal, since he's come, we'll use him," and taking the boot from Mr. Belden, he held it to the dog's nostrils, saying sternly, "Brun, I want the other  -the mate    to this--seek it- run--run- don't come- back without it." For a few moments the noble fellow crouched close to the feet of his master, snuffed continually of the blood-stained witness, and then springing up he leaped over it and dashed-wildly ahead for a few. rods. Here he paused and howled, so sol- emnly, so-heartfully, that the listeners felt their hair stand straight. "He's scented sumthin'," said uncle Billy. "Come on." They followed, the dog waiting patiently till they were close Ato him, when he sprung madly, down the almost precipitous sides of the bluff and was lost to Vie w in the tangled bushes. q Arter him," cried 'his master, and suiting ac- tion to word, he plunged into the underbrush, and at the risk of a broken neck, descended into the wild and dark ravine. The others followed, but though   they worlked boldly on, they were no a x-   THE SEARCHe        71 match for the old man, for ere they were half way down, he halloed to them  to go back and- "he'd be with 'em in a minute." And he was, too, bearing on his back a large tow-cloth sack. "Open that,: boys," cried he, throwing it on the ground and himself beside it, for his breath was nearly gone, "I reckon there was a Providence in poor Brun's yelling so they had to let him loose. That'll tell a- story." It did, too. For on cutting the leathern string that confined it, a mass of blood-stained clothing rolled out; a shirt of the purest linen, a Mar- seilles vest, an Alpacca coat and pantaloons, a neck-cloth, a pair of socks, and the mate to the boot I But when the pockets were searched, there were no papers, nor indeed anything; that would give a clue to the name of the murdered one. "Well, what shall we do next, Uncle Billy," asked Keene, as after looking long and carefully over the sack and its contents, he rolled the clothing up, put it back and tied it up again. "Do," said the old man, in a voice of thunder, "Go ahead till we find the scamp that did up this deviltry. The Lord's with us. I know'd he be on the trail, though the dew did dry up.  He's leadin' us. Pity if we can't follow ;" and shoul- dering the sack he started for the river. They had proceeded but a few paces, ere giv- ing another unearthly yell, the dog rushed again down the cliff, and ere any could follow, bounded back again with a light cloth cap in his teeth. Eagerly did they-take it from him and turn it over and over. . The maker's name had been cut out, and so jaggedly that it had evidently beenr done in haste and with a bloody knife.

As Mr. Belden, after handling it the third time, started to give it to Unele Billy, that he might drop it in the sack, iuch an uncontrollable fit of emotion seized him, that he involuntarily pressed the cap convulsively in his two hands. As he did so, he started and with spasmodic haste commenced tearing out the lining and pulling apart the dark wad- ding, and an exultant shout went up to heaven from all four as there finally dropped out a small but exquisitely chased golden locket. It opened with a spring, and was four faced. How eagerly did those old pioneers lean upon Mr. Belden's shoulders as he unclasped it, and they were not ashamed to weep as they saw revealed to them, in one face, a perfect likeness of the dead stran- ger, to whom they had given their burial rites; in another the little' blue-eyed babe whom Mar- garet had found upon the prairie; in the third, a beautiful young woman, with the same heavenly -eyes and golden curls as had the stranger child, and in the fourth, a gray-haired man; evidently, for the resemblance was striking, the father of the murdered one.  "Good Brun Igood Brun," said uncle Billy in a broken voice to the faithful hound, stroking him gently at the same time. A"Ye've did what none of us could. Ye've given us the proof of what we all b'lieved, but didn't know. Good Brun-- ye shall sleep at that man's feet when ye die, and when them as comes arter us, tells of him, they'll tell of you too." And drawing his hands across his eyes, he placed the cap rever- ently in, the sack, while Mr, Belden fastened the locket in his wallet.   THE SEARCH. *3 Then silently and with thoughtful looks they wound around the bluff till they came to the bhot tom land, when all marks of the trail being lost, they strode hastily under the shadows of the huge black walnut trees and then glided through a thick growth of willows, till at length their foot- steps fell upon the white beach of the river. A couple of canoes, each with a single oarsman were moored to a little headland, a few yards from them.               - f  C "What luck," cried they eagerly, as the -four men came in sight. "What luck, Uncle Billy?" i "The Lord above is with us," said the old man solemnly, and he recounted the -success of the day. "We have tracked the deviltry so far,- but we mustn't stop here. We must go down the river right off. You, Jim and you, Johnny, jump in there with Jack. Mr. Belden and me will get in with Tom, and we'll push down stream at once, for the feller that did that bloody job came from below somewhere." And the two canoes were soon floating down the river and at sunset were moored to a pretty island many miles from the Boone Branch. "It's a dark moon yet, and so we must wait till daybreak," said Uncle Billy. f*It's hard, for my old blood's up, but it must be did. You, Jack and Tom, cut some boughs for a fire, and we'l make some coffee and fry us some bacon and eggs, and with'some cold pone make out a purty good supper too, I'll warrant, for hungry men never giowl at the cook, they say, and I reckon we-are all hungry enough." "I've something better than bacon," said Tom Symmes as he crossed the sticks for the fire; "I reckon mother was up near about al night cook' 7'   &#xD;<pb n="74-75" xml:id="VAC7838-00000038"/> 74    THE PET OF THE SETTLEMENT, ing for you and them.

"What is it, Uncle Billy?" asked Mr. Belden. "I see nor hear any thing.", "But I do, man. I hear' the dip of paddles. There's a canoe a cummin--- up stream too,- listen." They did, -but even Jim, with his well-practised ear heard nothing. "I tell tyou there's a canoe cummin', said Uncle Billy. "My ears are old, but they can't cheat me yet." And sure enough, after the lapse of about five minutes, a canoe with a single person in it, shot around a little bend in the river, and came rapid- ly towards them. "Halloa there," cried they all. "Halloa,/ answered a full rich voice, which Mr. Belden recognized iat once as that of the hunter-priest. "I am glad to meet you, friends," and mooring his little bark to the island, he was soon in their midst, inquiring eagerly if they had been on the search, and of their success. When he had heard them- through, he said he -too had been on the murderer's track. "I start- ed,?' said he, " immediately after the services of yesterday. I knew the villain must have come up the river, for' water washes out blood-stains, aye, and foot-prints too. So I took my canoe, and       , THE PET OF THE SETTLEMENT. *   75 though it was a dark night, started down stream, and never stopped till daylight found me just be- side the fort. I learned there, that my conjec- tures were true. An emigrant team came m i there just at sunset one day last week, and camped out on the banks of the river. There were two young men, a young woman and child, and the old Hoosier who owned, the -team. On the following morning he started back, while they remained in camp. Two or three of the- officers called upon them and learned from one of the young men, that they were on their way to the Boone Branch, and were expecting some canoes to come down and meet them. He said his brother had been quite ill on the road, and was yet very weak, and that he was nearly beside himself with anxiety about him. They had lost their-fortunes at the East, and bad come out to the far West to make a home; but he had feared many times of late, that his poor brother had come out there only to lie down and die. The officers were much pleased with him, and also with the wife of the sick man, who seemed a lady of rare intelligence and goodness, while there little blue-eyed girl- was a perfect treasure. They had decided to of-' fer them rooms in the barracks till the health and strength of the feeble, one was restored, but on going down to their camping ground the next morning, found they had left; and concluding their expected canoes had come! for them, they let the matter drop, and had hardly thought of them again, till I called upon them with my in- quiries. But they are indignant enough, and the commanding officer will detach some so ldiers at any time we request, to aid us in search of the false-hearted brother- or friend, for I cannot be- I '              t   &#xD;<pb n="76-77" xml:id="VAC7838-00000039"/> 76       THE SEARCH. lieve such a second Cain has been born upon the earth."' "And you found no traces of them on the river-bank?" said Mr. Belden anxiously, "Aye, that did I," said the hunter-priest. "About ten miles from the fort, I found their first camping ground. And they evidently stopped there- two or three days,- probably that the vil- lain might perfect his hellish plans,--concoct them with his Indian allies, for he has had Indians to help him. And five miles below, I found a second camp and this witniess." And he drew from one of his pockets a tiny baby shoe, a little soft cashmere thing, a crimson rose-bud gleaming through soft silken leaves, deftly embroidered on the little toe. "And what think you has become of them- the murderer and his other victim, the fair young mother?" -asked Mr. Belden. "It believe they have gone up stream that the villain has leagued himself with those bloody Sioux, who are forever prowling about, and gone off into the Dacotah country; and I fear," and his brow darkened, " that after awhile, wearying of his beautiful prey, he will dispose of her to some: chief, and enriched by the fell sale, take himself off-put the ocean between him and his crime." "Aye, but," said Uncle Billy, solemnly, "he can't put the ocean 'twixt him and God. He will repay- him., "Yes, vengeance is his," said the hunter-priest, and then they clustered about the camp-fire, and determined upon the measures proper to pursue.

UNCLE BILLY- WHTE CLOUD. THE prairies-were brilliant with the nodding crowns and the golden rod and the waving spires of the wild sun-flower; the low thickets that hedged them were royal with glossy-leaved hazle- bushes and crimson-plumed sumachs - masses of purple asters clustering lovingly about their roots; the forests were gorgeous with scarlet maples, yellow hickories, dark green oaks and silvery-leaved cottonwoods, while down on the river-bottoms and all along the banks of the little creeks, the brown vines of the wild grape were drooping heavily with their thousand clusters of dead-ripe fruit. Their first summer of emigrant life -had flitted by, each of its long, beauteous days, bringing with it so much to interest, amuse and instruct, that it was gone ere they had wea- ried of it, and long ere they were looking for it,  a crisping frost had tinted the long grass of the prairies with a sun-like hue, and crowned as with rubies the old maple that shadowed their cabin. But so glorious was that autumn, that none of them mourned for the lost summer. Like a dream of beauty it lay on their hearts; day after day of the calmest loveliest weather coming to delight 78   THE PET OF THE SETTLEMENT.   79 them. The golden air was fragrant with balmy winds; the sky was splendid, a thousand flitting tints of blue and amber chasing over its zenith, while pale, purplish mists hung about its horizon; the woodland grew each day more gorgeous in its coloring; the river sang more softly, while the prairies were more magnificent than ever, their long grass rolling and swelling like the waves of an .ocean, while the flowers that yet lingered were kingly in their hues, giving here a rich, amethystine glory to the landscape, and there clothing it with a star-like radiance. It seemed to Margaret like Eden, and as she daily wandered about and drank in the living loveliness, she for- got for the time that the trail of the serpent was even here, and gave up her soul to rapture. On the eve of one of those beauteous October days, she sat upon the threshold of their cabin, her lap full of brier-buds, which she was string- ing into a necklace for the little pet who sat beside her, cuddling a snow-white. dove to her heart and singing a baby song. "'Most done," said she, after awhile, in lisping accents, looking up fondly into Margaret's face. "Yes, darling. Is birdie asleep?" "Sound 'sleep, sissy; me put 'im bed," and hugging the pretty creature yet closer, she tod- dled into the room and carefully laid the sleeping bird on the pillow of her own bed, covering it closely with a little soft rabbit skin. Then with light steps, she ran back and stood quietly before Margaret, while she tried the effects of the Indian corals, as she called the scarlet buds, now binding them about the pure white forehead, then twisting them in the golden curls, and finally tying them about the slender throat. &#xD;<pb n="80-81" xml:id="VAC7838-00000041"/> 8Q    UNCLE BTLLY- WHtITE CLOUD. "Me t'ank sissy," said the little one, as the pink ribbon was knotted, "me 'ook pitty now," and she danced up and- down the pathway, ' Me want Hally and pa and Nunkee see me,' and she looked through the rail fence towards the timber. "Who wants to see Nunkee," said a cheery voice, a moment after, and from behind the trunk of the old maple, stepped Uncle Billy, his old "never-fail" in one hand and a string of squirrels in the other. "Me, me,' answered the little creature, bound- ing -towards him, "me 'ook pitty, see," and she pointed with her fingers to the berries,that shone upon her neck..  , "Purty, darling I Well, then, but you do;" and throwing down his game and leaning his gun against the cabin, he caught her in his arms and perched her on his shoulders, screams of baby- laughter floating in musical gushes from her lips. {' Yes, little dear, you look as purty as -as - as my own little Billy used to when I came home from hunting.

Do you know, darter," and his face grew very sad, " do you know 'it frets me sometimes to think that prehaps they won't know me when I first get to heaven,- thatprehaps they'll wonder what old man that is, and never know till I tell them, that it is me-Sallie's own husband and little Billy's own father -and I tell you, that  would hurt me dreadfully- not to have them know me right off, for H should want to catch them in my arms the first thing," and -he hugged little Allie till she fairly shrieked.      ; After tossing her up again on to his shoulders, he turned to Margaret, and fixing a wistful look on her, said earnestly, " didn't it ever plague you, n ; darter, to think that your own mother wouldn't prehaps know you, when you first got to heaven," and he almost held his breath while waiting for her answer for to him, that beautiful and gifted woman was a very oracle, a saint indeed who's' lightest word was an inspiration. "No Uncle Billy," said she gently, "it has never worried me. Why should it?' Does not the Bible say, ' for there we shall be as the an- gels?'"  -  "Yes, it does, darter," answered he slowly and musingly, " but I never thought of it in this con- nection. Bless me, but it beats all, how you can remember Scriptur texts and allers bring them in at the right time."  For awhile he paced back and forth before the (ir  &#xD;<pb n="82-83" xml:id="VAC7838-00000042"/> 82    UNCGLE BILLY- WHT1E CLOUD. door, with little Allie crowing on his shoulder; then stopping suddenly, he laid one of his great hands on Margaret's head and said reverently, "bless you, darter, bless you. I shall sleep quiet- er to-night than I have since God took them, for I shan't have. that to worry me any more. It's kind-of a queer subject-matter'though, arter all,- how we can know each other and yet not look as we used to - suppose the angels all look alike, 'how'll I know'them then' -and a blank expres- sion stole'over his face for a- moment. As it passed away, he muttered, rather than spoke, "but it's no- use bothering my old brains about it. I s'pose ministers and- priests and such like, as have studied the old dead'talk the Bible was first writ in, know- all about it ahd how it is, but I can't see it." "Neither can I, Uncle Billy," said Margaret. "It is one of those subjects that cannot be grasp- ed by such short-sighted creatures as we. And yet, after all, it is no more wonderful than a thousand things that happenaround us every day. You don't look at all as you did forty years ago, and yet you know you are the same man." "That's it, darter -. you've -just hit it now. I shall be myself and nobody else when I get there and- they'll be themselves, and so, though we' all be like angels, we shall be ourselves and- well, I can't see it quite yet"--and tie poor old man whose mind had never been used to wander in the subtile doctrines of theological and meta- physical' schools, hesitated a moment- but I feel certain we'll know who we be, somehow or other." "So do I," said Margaret, firmly, " for heaven wouldn't be heaven to me if I were not myself.   THE PET OF THE BETT';rllNT.  .83 I shall be changed, and so shall we all"- and here she stopped, while her thoughts involuntari. ly wandered back to the sermon the hunter-priest had delivered to them at the stranger's burial, and with that memory came those others, which had been awakened by the rich tones of his voice, and she sunk on the threshold and looked vacant- ly at the western sky, where the brilliant clouds of an October- sunset lay piled in gorgeous masses. Uncle Billy had become used to her, and so; this mood neither made him wonder ,nor worry. But as it did not pass off, he after a little while picked up the string of squirrels, and going to the back door, commenced dressing them, singing all the while to little Allie, whom he had placed on the grass beside him, and whose blue eyes were bigger than ever, as she watched him strip the skin so dexterously from limb and body that not a rent was in them- singing that quaint, old Mother Goose melody: Daddy's gone a hunting- To bring a little rabbit skin To rock the baby bunting in."' The cheery voices of Mr. Belden and Harrie, as they drove up to the bars, roused Margaret from her reverie, and clearing her brow, she smil- ed sweetly upon them and bade them welcome home in a voice which had not a tremor, though her heart was all in a tumult. A few moments after, she was busy about the hearth-side, making coffee, frying-" dodgers," trying the potatoes, and jesting with Uncle Billy, who was broiling his squirrels over the- red hot hickory coals. "I haven't told you yet what I come round this s'    .   .         ..  &#xD;<pb n="84-85" xml:id="VAC7838-00000043"/> 84   UNCLE BILLY-WH1iTE CLOUD. way for," said the old man, as supper over, they grouped themselves about the fire. But I saw just the- nicest lot of- ripe grapes to-day that I ever came across -in -fact the whole river is black with them, but this lot was extra nice, and I just thought that our darter Margaret here, would like such as them to put down for winter pies and sarse--they're so good. Old grandma Symmes will show you how, for she's a ginuwine good cook--the' it aint much arter all to put them down. Just take a crock that's sound and put a layer of sugar to the bottom and then a layer of grapes, and then some more sugar and then grapes and then sugar, and so on. I tell you, but they're nice and so easy done; no stew- ing over the fire and fretting for fear they"ll be smoky, or scorch, or something else." "But won't they work:?" said Margaret, anx- iously, for she was a novice in the art of preserv- ing, and had therefore been troubled a good deal during the past summer to keep her sweet-meats from fermenting. "Work I Why yes, they'll work, but the beau- ty of it is, they settle themselves. Only you put sugar enough to them and tie them up, and you won't have 'no botheration with them. All you've got to do when you make a pie is to dip them out on to your crust. Easy, aint it?" ap pealing to Mr. Belden.

"Good for you, Uncle Billy," shouted Harrie, whose buoyant spirits the hard work of the last four months had failed to tame in the least. "I always want you along when anything's going on, for there's never no guess work then. You always know just:where to go and just what to go after and the best of all is, you always get what you go for." "Sometimes more," said the old man naively,' and little Alhe was lifted from Harrie's knee to his own. "Youimean the time we went strawherrying, Uncle Billy, and found- that little sweetheart of mine"     , ' "And my brown page," said Margaret. "Yes, we did get more than we went for that time, but none of us would like to give up the added and- unsought treasures," and she wiled Allie from the old man's knees to her- own. "No, indeed," said Mr. Belden, holding out both hands to the baby girl and when he had caught her, tossing her up and down till her mu- sical laughter rung out far into the darkness. "Particularly Margaret. How lonely she would be in our -absence if it were not for this little waif of a sister." "And on Sundays," added Harrie, roguishy.

Somehow his old heart kinder yarns for White Cloud, for he's the last one he's got, and then the old man's grown weakly of late. I've seen the time when if one-of his boys that's dead and gone now, had refused to go on the war- trail, he'd astruck them down and shut up the door of his wigwam against them forever. But he aint as fierce as he used to be. He and I have hunted together a good deal;" and he paused and looked into the brigt fire. He was too modest to say more, but his listeners felt that no one, not even the Indian of whom he had spoken, could spend many days in his company, without having the 'hard edges ground down. Human nature, whether wrapt in a red or white skin, will ever succumb to genuine, hearty good- ness, and such was Uncle Billy's. "Well," said he after awhile, "I must be off." "Better stay," said Margaret, gently. "I'd like to, darter, but I stopped to see old Symmes as I come along, and he's worse, and the poor old woman has had a wearisome time a-tak- ing care of him for two nights, and so I told her I'd come in and nurse him this one and let her get a little rest;" "But you're so tired, Uncle Billy.

"You shall be my little sweet- heart and go with me always," and leaping into the wagon, he sat her on his knee and whispered bright and beautiful hopes into her ear.

Across a pretty stretch of prairie, through a hedge of hazle-bush and down, far down into the forest, went they, till at length emerging from a grove of willows, their wheels rolled over the white sand that edged the Des Moines. Up the river five or -six miles and they reined in their horses and leaping from their seats, looked with wonder at the luxuriant and heavily laden vines which clung to every branch of the old trees. Mr. Belden, Uncle Billy and Harrie, clambering into them, soon stripped them bare, the black clusters lying in tempting piles upon the wagon bed. As to Margaret, she now and then picked a bunch from a branch that drooped low, but oftener wandered up -and down the beach, with little Allie by the hand, writing pet names upon the sand and gathering pearly shells, clouded agates anld shining jaspers. Ere noon, a plenti- ful supply of the rich fruit was theirs, and then Mr. Belden sat down with his fishing pole, while Uncle Billy and Harrie started of in pursuit of game.  In an hour, their success was such, that they grouped about the fire which Margaret had kindled -on the beach and commenced cooking their hunter-feast, she meanwhile spreading a snowy cloth on the sand and taking from her travelling basket sundry little delicacies to com- -plete it. And indeed when. they gathered about it, it was a most tempting one, and the veriest epicure might have relished the plump partridges, which Uncle Billy had broiled; the little fat quails which Harrie had roasted on a stick,; the chowder.

The finding of little Allie, the discovery of the bloody corpse, the burial and the christening, passed vision-like before her,'and then came the brightness and beauty which the  child had given to their cabin home and lent to their warm hearts. For little Alhe was one of those gentle yet brilliant children which seem half heavenly and win love involuntarily. Margaret had thought her quite a baby, she was so small and delicate, but When she had been there a week, she surprised them all by starting up from the wolf-robe, Uncle Billy had brought her to sit upon, and running to the door, not with the timid steps of a first attempt, but with the confident ones of a child who knows it can go alone. And the next day when the old, man brought her the snow-white dove that had lived in his cabin a year, she brought tears and smiles to: their faces, as cuddling it to her heart, she said, softly, " birdie -pity birdie," "A right-smart baby, ours," said Harrie, " walk and talk before it's a fortnight old.

And then came to Margaret the precious mem- mries of kindnesses done and gifts presented to Lhe little one, for she was verily the pet of the settlement, and men, women and children vied with each other in manifesting their love for the little waif which Providence had thrown into their midst. Margaret could not but smile as she thought over some of the presents that had been offered to and accepted for the child. One old man had brought a pair of coarse, bull-hide shoes, big enough for a child of eight years, but very precious to him, because one of his little ones "that was dead and buried in Indiana," ad worn, them once. Another sent her a heifer-calf;      ; another a ewe-lamb; another a setter-pup, while  little Jake Getzman brought her a speckled pig, and his sister two jet-black kittens. Then there  was a tame squirrel, a pair of cosset chickens,-a snow-white swan, and a whole brood of brown-  winged ducks. Flowers came fresh and beautiful every morning, while every kind of wild fruit, scarlet strawherries, dewy raspberries, thimble- berries, blackberries, red and yellow plums, red and black haws, delicate little crab-apples, boughs of elder, and whole vines of ripe grapes, each in its  season, were brought in such profusion thatar-  garet's tesatable was ever a luscious sight, Allie's presents sufficing for the wants of all.

How reverently the old- savage had lifted the little girl on to a milk-white poney, bound her on -to its curiously wrought saddle, put a bunch of painted feathers in her hand and- bade her whip up her horse and how pleased he had seemed when -after racing wildly on to the praire, it had come back at his whistle, with its precious burden crowing with delight. And how tenderly had the old squaw slipped the little feet into beaded mocassins and hung on the slender shoulders a mantle made from the skin of the wild goat, soft and white as one of the crape shawls from eastern looms and embroidered with the plumage of beauteous birds. And with what penitent looks had the Indian lad, when he came back for the first time from his father's lodge, laid at the little one's feet the bow and quiver of arrows, which he had carried on the day she was left on the prairie. "My, little waif," said Margaret, tenderly, "thou -hast been, through God, the salvation of one Indian soul; but for thee, darling, White Cloud and I had never met, perhaps, I to become thp teacher, he the reverent pupil,"- and rising, she was about to put the child- in -the bed she had prepared, when a low sullen growl arrested   A- GRAPING:.       95 her, and turning, she beheld a huge black bear standing just on the edge of the forest and look- ing, apparently straight at her I The blood curdled about her heart, a deatmly weakness palsied her nerves, her limbs quivered, her eyeballs ached, her lips became as snow.

SATURDAY NIGHT, WILDLY ran the night wind through the dense timber tract that skirted the cabin of Mr. BRelden on the west, shivering the icicle from the leaf- less boughs, flurrying the snow-wreaths that had settled on them, and sighing and sobbing amongst them with such   fearful distinctness that it seemed to Margaret's excited brain the ghosts. of the red men were flitting through their old hunting grounds, and calling aloud to each other in the weird tones of the dead. - Over the broad- prairie that stretched far to the sun-rise, it shriek- ed in terrible tempest tones, driving the freshy fallen snow -into almost impassable ridges, and driving it through the air in such blustering vol- umes that the whole atmosphere seemed but one porous mass of ice-cold particles. The storm had been brewing for several days. Uncle Billy had looked in upon them a few mo- ments on Sunday evening, and bade Harrie get his hunting gear in good order, and be ready to start at a moment's warning. "There's snow in the air, bud; depend on't my old bones don't crack so for nothin.

It'll drive 'em into the timber sure and fast, and maybe a herd of elk along with 'em too, and then such sport as there'll be. You down east hunters can't fancy it even. But look out for the shakes, bud, when you first see the antitlers.  "The shakes, uncle Billy  What's that? I shant't catch the ague a-hunting, I hope.' - O, no, boy, that is, not the fever and ag'e, but there was never a white man yet but shook ' fin hils shoes the first time he, came afront of a deer or an elk.

So get'ready, my boy, for I'll be along with the first flake that drops, for I must have you safe down in my old camping ground before the storm: gets hard, for a wosome place is this parara to cross in a driving snow." And with many a timely warning to Mr. Belden to look out and see that his stock were well sheltered, and to be sure and have up a big stack of wood from the timber, the old man departed. Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday passed, and --yet the storm did not break, though the air felt like snow and the sky looked grey and the clouds hung low, while the wind 7ailed mournfully. But on Thursday morning, as Mr. Belden was harnessing his, horses, he felt a single flake touch his cheek. He looked up and around, but there were no signs of more, and so he went on, and was just lifting the tongue of his wagon, when a , *  F   SATURDAY NIGHT---     -99 hand was laid heavily on his shoulders and the voice of Uncle Billy- exclaimed, put em up, put 'em up.

A mighty long while it's been getting ready and a mighty long while it'll be at it now, I can 'tell you, forI know these parara storms like a book." And leading the horses back into their shed, he assist- ed in tying themn up, and then hurrying into the cabin, he bade Harrie put on his snow-shoes and gather up his traps for they must be off. "Better tWait and have dinner," said Margaret. "I have a nice quail pie and " "Don't mention it, darter. 'Fore noon the ground 'll be white and the air so thick you can't see the length of your nose.

They were hardly out of sight ere the snow began to fall in good earnest, and all day long, and all night, and allt Friday and until Saturday morning it came steadily down. Then the clouds lifted, the flakes came sparsely and a few pale straggling sunbeams gleamed over the white tim- ber and prairie. "The storm is over, I think," said Mr. Belden to grandma Symmes, as about noon he entered her cabin, having made his way there with -much dif- ficulty. "The snow is, I reckon, sir, but we've got to have the wind yet. That's the worst of these parara storms. It'll be tedious too when it does come, for there's a heap of snow to be :lifted."  i "It is very still now, grandma; hardly a breath of -air stirring.

I've lived in parara land long enough to know all about these things., I'd a heap 'rather have the snow than the wind."  Her predictions were verified, for just at night. fall the snow began to fly, and ere evening had entirely set in, a furious tempest was running over the prairie and through the timber. "It's going to be an awful night," said Mr. Bel- den as he came in from doing up his chores, and setting down his milk-pail he barred the doors, and tucked a couple of old blankets close about the sills. "It comes straight from the north and is as cold as blue blazes. But I guess we shall weather it pretty well. The horses and cows and pigs are well sheltered; we have a good pile of wood cut and plenty to eat ;I so we won't worry," and as Margaret took up the supper, he rolled on a hickory log that would have answered well for a Yule evening, and piled on the dry lind wood till the old fire-place was in a perfect blaze. "That looks good," said he, drawing his stool to- the table, for they had now got above sitting on trunks, "and so does this," and he stuck his fork into the breast of a wild turkey. "Between your cooking and my fires I think we shall be pretty comfortable, for all the wind howls so and the storm is so furious."  And comfortable and pleasant their home did look on that Saturday evening, with the huge back-log slowly wearing into coals, and the high and ruddy, blaze of the lind wood casting a genial light-and glow into every corner and scintillating so merrily, on the dark loft and all over the heavi- ly draped :walls. The cabin -had been repaired early in the autumn.  Agood tight roof imper. ,   SATURDAY -NIGHT.     101 vious to every thing but scudding snow, had been laid on, the sides had been thoroughly and neatly "' pointed" outside and in, a window had been cut, doors hung, a new floor laid, and a loft of black walnut. Mr. Belden had bought up a bale of furs from a friendly Indian, and given them -to Marga- ret to dispose of as she thought best. With an eye not only to warmth and comfort but to pic. turesque effect, she had hung them about the walls of the cabin, and -so managed the varied shades and colors that they seemed the back. ground of some rare old painting, and as the fire- light streamed over them, you could almost fancy you saw the sunrise flitting over snowy peaks, and drifting into dark mountain gorges.- Robes of buffalo covered the floor and made it soft and warm to the feet, while a lounge and stools, covered with crimson cotton, gave a rich and even luxurious look to that cabin home. Two small, snow-white tents occupied the corners where in the summer-time had been Margaret's bed of quilts, and her father's and brother's pile of skins, affording to them all privacy and retire- ment, and adding not a little to the unique apI pearance of the room. A shed had been built on to the south end, and here Margaret kept all those homely but necessary household utensils, which had at first been stowed upon eitherside of the chimney, while their place was occupied by two neat cupboards, one radiant as a side-board with the rich glass, china and silver ware which they had- brought with them from their olden home, and the other beautiful as a picture with its lining of green and silvery mosses, its tufts of dried grasses, its bouquets of gorgeous autumnal  leaves, its stores of pearly river shells, and&amp;its piles of shining agates.

Yes, very comfortable and pleasant was that log cabin home, and seldom in the splendid par. lors of our Atlantic cities does a happier trio gather about the hearthstone, than that which, after the supper was over, drew around that ample fire-place ; Margaret with her saintly countenance, Mr. Belden the very personification of -glorious manhood, and little Allie--the dancing, singing, glad-hearted prairie-waif, with her violet eyes so brimful of fun and frolic, and her coral lips so rich with melody.

Margaret finish- ed her socks, run the heels and deposited them in the clothes bag. Little Alhe was undressed, ar- rayed inri her soft crimson flannel- night-gown, and carefully tucked up in her sister's bed. Marga- ret read the Bible lessons for the night, and her father had just piled on a fresh supply .of wood preparatory to retiring, when suddenly they both -became aware of other sounds than the screech- :ing tempest. The hoarse baying of a hound and the- i:lsty halloas of a man's voice, mingled with 'the howling of the wind, and seemed close at hand; too. '-"It's Tom Symmes, I guess, coming for me.

It's not the going out I mind half so much as leaving you here alone." "O, don't mind me, father. With this great fire, and little Allie, I can't be lonely." The door by this time was unbarred, and Mr. Belden's hand on the latch, ready to open it as soon as Tom should reach the threshold. Anoth- er instant and he stood within, his garments cov. ered, his frosty breath hanging like a white beard from his lips, his eyelids cased in ice, his hands numb, and his feet almost frozen in his bootsl A whole sheet of snow was driven in after him by the furious wind, and embers and ashes were scattered all over the room. Margaret hastened to put out the coals, while her father, rapidly bar-  ring the door, strove to brush the snow off Tom's   I clothing, draw off his mittens and boots, and-  warm up his half-frozen limbs.

Margaret brought his snow shoes, his leggings, his buffalo overcoat, fur cap a/nd mittens, and then insisted on folding a heavy banket over his shoulders. They set out in about half an hour, she telling her father on no account to return before morn- ing, for she should do very well alone, and feel much happier than if she knew he was again battling with the storm.

MARGARET was naturally brave and courageous, and did not think of giving way to fear of any   : kind, but the storm was so violent, the wind rushed by the cabin in such fearful blasts, and howled and wailed so dismally, that, in -spite of her stout heart, she soon grew timid, -and before long so scared that she hardly dared look over her shoulder. And so she sat there, crouching on the stool, and not stirring, except to throw on occasionally a stick of wood from the pile at her side, till the little Geneva clock, that stood in her tent, chimed the hour of twelve. "A witching time,"' she murmurred, ' O, for some other sound than that awful wind, -I have half a mind to waken Allie ;" and, with an almost superhuman effort, she roused herself and started to go to the child's bedside.

She was all alone, and no cry of hers could be heard above the-wind, even though it were the cry of death itself. Her fainting fit was short; too soon, it seemed to her, she came back to life and its terror, and no -sooner was she half herself again than she was conscious of a strange sound at the door She listened keenly. Was he trying the latch. No, It did not stir. She listened again, It was more like a sob or groan. She crawled to the sill, tore away the blanket and put her ear to the threshold. As she did so an articulate sound reached her ear; "help- I am freezing," it seemed to say, and as she listened once more, fainter than before but still distinctly, was utters ed the word "' help." In a moment Margaret was herself, and without stopping to think whether it might not be some savage device, she unbarred the door and threw it wide open. In rushed the wind and snow, blinding her so that she could scarcely see the dark form crouching on the step. "Help!"It was a dying tone. Two hands were upraised an instantand then fell powerless. ' Help!"It was fainter than before. "Yes, yes," said Margaret, "God give me strength to help you as I would," and she drew the form in, and pushed to :the door and barred it securely. Then she drew it nearer the fire, and with :her broom fleetly swept off the accumulated snow, and unclasped the leather belt that bound *    (      RECOGNITION.      107 the heavy Mackinac blanket about the waist.+  Then she unbuttoned the shaggy overcoat and the heavy cloth one, unfastened the deer-skin leggings and drew off the heavy buffalo overshoes and leather boots. The fur collar was next taken from the neck, and the fur cap unloosened and removed, and then she started back with a feeling of awe, for the features revealed were those of that hunter-priest, who seemed to come and go through the settlement like a spirit. "Help," moaned the white lips.  She moistened them with wine ; she chafed the temples with camphor, she rubbed'his hands and feet with snow. She worked- long and untir- ingly, but he did not seem to recover, but only moaned feebly as if in pain--as if dying.    - "If father were- but here,'" said she, almost despairingly, and for a moment wrung her hands, - and stood idly by. But it was only a moment. The next she was busy again with the poor suf- ferer. "If I could but get him to drink of it,--I will try," and pouring out a glass of wine, she lifted his head from the pillow she had put under it, arid holding the glass to his lips, said to him "drink, sir, if you can-it may save you." He H seemed to understand and strove to swallow; and after many efforts succeeded in draining it all.  Itseffects were soon visible. A faint crimson glow came back to his lips, and his pulse quick- ened. Renewing her kindness, she had after an hour the satisfaction of seeing her patient so far restored as to be able, with her assistance, to rise and recline on the lounge which she had drawn close to- the hearth. "Don't try to speak yet," said she, as his lips i*  ' * "  &#xD;<pb n="108-109" xml:id="VAC7838-00000055"/> 1:08  - THE PET OF THE 'SETTLEMENT. unclosed, "you are too feeble." And she ten. derly disposed the pillows about his shoulders and under his head, and covering him with soft, warm .blankets, bade him rest quietly while she made some tea. She was busy at the fireside, when a rustling on the lounge made her turn toward it. The hand of the hunter priest was pressed to his brow, and, it seemed to her, convulsively. "Do you suffer," said she, gently, going to him and placing her palm upon his fobehead. "Not any," was the 'quiet answer  Those clear, rich, mellow tones! - how deep they sank in her heart- how they freshened old memories and thrilled old sorrows! Involuntarily she bent her eyes keenly on that olive face, and with her fingers brushed away from the high temples the masses of coal-black hair.

Moments pass and still their looks-do not wander. Then a bright, beautiful smile ripples about his lips, and he utters the single word, "Margaret!" She does not faint, but seems spell-bound, and stands beside him, still and statuesque as chiselled marble. "Margaret,-my own Margaret,-my beloved," and clasping both hands he draws her, to him, then winds his arms about her, in a grave, gentle way, and then, pressing a single kiss upon her lips, a sweet, lingering pressure as it were of his whole soul, he lifts her head gently and says, in a voice that fruitlessly strives to be calm, "I had only sinned, Margaret, when I'left you -since '[   o   RECOGNITION.      109 then I have suffered, and by suffering been puri- fied.

"Forgive us our debts as we forgive our debt- ors,7' said she in her lowest, gentle tone; then putting back his arms she said wildly, almost pas- sionately, " is it indeed Edward, my long lost one that comes back as from the dead!' "Aye, Margaret - your Edward - yours only -now and evermore."  And he pressed her to his heart. And thus they met -thus found each other-  those- two, who seven long, weary yearsg- before had parted in such agony. On the distant shores of the Atlantic they had bade each other what they felt then must be a final farewell. On a wild prairie of Iowa, they had again clasped hands; again spoken their holy betrothal vows; met, to part no more. Wildly throbbed the winter storm outside the cabin, but, they knew it not. A deep, sweet peace had fallen on their hearts, and they heard only those low, musical pulses which the spirit beats when two that have been twain are one. "Bride of my heart," he would whisper and fold Margaret reverently to his bosom, and then  he would'breathe into her ear words precious as   i pearls, sunny memories, blissful realities and bright, beautiful promises. And she, the patient and long suffering one, with meek, earnest, up- .  s ward glances, would thank Heaven, that the grey and dreary days of life were over) that the silent, i speechless grief of years was spent, that the   - clouds were lifted and a golden vista opened.   r 10             .       ,:*    &#xD;<pb n="110-111" xml:id="VAC7838-00000056"/> CHTAPTER XII. A NEW FRIEND. iT was in the May of her life and in the May of the year when Margaret Belden first met Ed. ward Somers. A crisis in commercial affairs had called her, father to Europe, and for the- three-fold purpose of relieving Margaret from the heavy cares which would devolve upon her as house- keeper of their stately city home, in his months of absence, to bring back, if possible, a tint of rose to the pale cheeks of his invalid wife, and to recruit little Harrie, who was weak and puny from a winter's illness, he purchased a pretty lit- tie Grecian-cottage in a retired but lovely locali- ty and established his family there. The Cottage on the Cliff, as Margaret named their little new home, was beautifully situated, a dim, old forest stretching for miles beyond it, arden-like meadows on the east and west, while before it was, spread out a small, silvery lake gemmed with -little emerald islands. They re- moved there early in April, before the annual miracle of the year had been wrought upon grove and field, while the trees were yet naked and the ground bare and brown, but by the time they had become 'settled and began to feel at home the aspect of things, out doors had wondrously chang- " ' 110      .  -. , I                   z   A NEW FRIEND.  1ll ed; the soft green grass had sprung up as if by magic; the buds on the trees had burst, and young, tender leaflets were unfolding to the light;, the sunshine streaked the surface of the lake with broadi golden bands, while the songs of my- riad spring birds made the air vocal with melody. Margaret and Harrie enjoyed intensely this wak l ing up of nature and were never weary of roam- ing through the woodland or across the meadows or on the -banks of -the beautiful lake. In the  morning, as soon as a faint red tinged the tree- tops and at evening when the bushes, were wet with night-dew, the two might be seen abroad, now watching the crimson glory that beamed in the eastern sky and then the long purple shadows that deepened and darkened in the west.- And the sister would even then wish to linger and while her mother and little brother slumbered, go out to the edge' of the cliff beneath which an hundred feet or more lay the still- blue waters, and watch the moon come up higher and higher and mark the stran4fand startling beauty which '  , her pale rays shimnTred into the rippling waves. .  One sunny afternoon in the latter part of May, Margaret lay drea ing on the piazza. She had    7' made a bed out bf,;her blanket shawl and the sofa cushions, and afler watching for awhile the play of the sunbeams as they flushed the pretty vines that draped the pillars, she closed her eyes and dropped into. a, light slumber. She had -not meant to sleep, for she had brought out a new - volume of poems, and had promised herself a - rare treat in their perusal; but her weariness, for she had been -out all the forenoon with Harrie, :t gathering flowers, had overcome her, and with    i only the first thrilling lines upon her lips, she'had d " lost herself.  /,  ./  * J.

She was a beauteous picture, and so thought Edward Somers, as with his dripping burden in his arms he stood beside her. Had there been time, he would have spent it in quiet admiration; but a human life hung upon his motions, and barely halting long enough to catch his breath, he said in those clear, rich tones which once 'heard, could never be forgotten, Lady- lady-- wake up." Margaret started at once, her first sensation being of terror at the sight of a stranger, her next, maidenly confusion at being surprised asleep, but both vanished in a moment, and re- covering her self-possession, and perceiving the intruder's garments were saturated with water, she said hurriedly, but very kindly, " You need assistance; let me aid you." And throwing open the front door, motioned him to enter.

"My poor, sick mother, my absent father- how can they bear it." And she wrung her hands, for it was Harrie himself, the little seven year old brother, whom she had thought safe and sound in the crib beside his mother. "Do not be so frightened," said the getleman in a gentle, soothing tone. "I think hewill soon recover. He was scarcely in the water ee I had him out, for I had been watching him for some time, and fearing he would lose his balance, had approached very close to warn him of his danger. I was about to speak, when his foot slipped off the narrow edge of rock. He only sank once be- fore I had him on land again. It is the chill aqd fright that has thrown him into this apparently dying condition." By this time they had reached the kitchen, and pausing in hibs story, Mr. Somers caught the iron- ing blanket from the table, and tearing off Har- rie's wet clothes, folded it about him and laid him upon the warm hearth-stone, before the blazing wood-fire. "Have you a man or a boy about?" he asked. Margaret, now quite herself, called the garden- er. Giving him a slip of paper, upon which he had pencilled a few lines, Mr. Somers bade hi; hurry to the village and give that to Dr. Stearns.

THE BRIDE OF THEJ HART. 3NoTINa ripens acquaintance,into a tender re- gard:so rapidly as communion in the sick cham- ber. Edward Somers and Margaret Belden had been mutually interested in each other at first sight, and during those long days and yet longer nights of illness, when she was' the thoughtful, patient, untiring nurse, and he, the worn and weary, yet uncomplaining sufferer, that interest growing first into a quiet, holy friendship, length- ened and deepened and broadened until it merg- ed itself into a pure and :perfetloye,- such love as is known only twhen the soul itself is wedded to a kindred one. -But neither of them realized this, until Ed- ward's departure. Then, as Margaret wandered through the empty spare chamber, up and down the quiet parlor, out on to the piazza'and into tlgarden, it seemed to her a sunbeam had van- ::'i^^from her home. - And Edward as he sat, in his inely room at the hotel and thought of the fair girl who had so long Jand kindly ministered to him, felt that the brightness and beauty of life -were both left behind him, and then with a pang "8   "THE BRIDE OF THEE FPAERT.  119 of agony-at his heart and. the shadows of anguish on his brow, he whispered slowly and sadly "It might have been."' Mrs, Belden had shared the duties of the sick room as far as possible with Margaret, her anxiety to contribute to the welfare of her boy's saviour, stimulating her to exertions she had not made for years. And when he left them; she 'enjoined upon him to become a frequent visitor at the cot- tage. "Remember," said she, kindly, " don't let a day pass without our seeing you, if you do, I shall fear you are ill again. And if you do feel like being sick again, have yourself brought here at once. Remember you saved my boy's life, and it is my duty as well as pleasure to try and save your's."            , The mother's earnest and cordial invitation was a good pretext to see the daughter, and never a day of that beautiful summer time, or that ,mel- low autumn passed without finding Edward and Margaret together. Their forenoons were de- voted to Mrs. Belden; driving her about the' grounds when she felt able to ride, and when she did not, in reading, singing, playing upon the flute, piano or guitar, or else in those brilliant conversational powers with which each were so gifted. But the afternoons were wholly their :own, and like waifs from Eden seemed those hours to the youthful pair as they now took long' drives through the dim old'forest, then rambled about the white shores of the little lake, or danc-e ing over its silvery wavesin a graceful barque) would land upon one of the fairy isles that gem- . med itsbosom, and weave rhyme and romance out of the beauty that hauntedit as with a spell. &#xD;<pb n="120-121" xml:id="VAC7838-00000061"/> 120   THE PET OPF THE SETTLEMENT.       i Margaret's heart had never been touched be- fore. She had been three years in society, and in the best too that their broad city knew; she had mingled with the highly bred, the intelligent, ; the -pure, the good, and hqd given her warm, con. fiding friendship to many a man, taking him to  i her spirit as a- sister does her brother, but the depth of her nature had never been stirred till  i now. Love had been a word of mystery and the , passion itself something she could not fathom. But now, when she met the glance of those dark eyes, when she listened to the tones of that -thrilling -voice, when she felt the clasp of that Strong hand, her soul had revelations of startling  glory. Love was full of meaning now, and the   : passion, that electric note which blends the music  of two hearts.                  i "Our last sail," said Margaret, as one bright,  summer-like October afternoon, she stepped into  : the little boat. There was a touching cadence in her voice, and Edward felt a tear drop on his -  hand as he assisted her to her usual seat., : Yes," said he, as the waves rippled about his oars, "our last sail, but let us not make it a sad one. Let our memory of it be as of some fair picture. Look up,. Margaret, and note the beauty that lies all around us." And then in his own artist-like way, he directed her attention to the forest scenes and the meadow views which en-   r circled the little lake, their gorgeous colorings so softy mrellowed by the golden haze which the Indian summer had woven about them all, he pointed to the sky, so brilliant in -its zenith, and- with such pale mists slumbering about its horizon;; -he noted the dreamy splendor of the little islands ( )   -  *  ' k    '-:   THE BRIDE OF THS FEAut I '1 which seemed to flit 'by them on - such noiseless waves, the balmy fragrance of the south wind as it floated among the crimson and yellow leaves, and the playful melody of the snowy ripples as they gurgled and plashed about the little boat. He quoted poetry, he sung snatches of music, he  + talked of every thing but what lay nearest his heart, the morrow's parting, and finally succeed- ed in making Margaret, if not merry, at least quietly happy, and entering with animation into the conversation which he had sustained so long alone, the time flitted by so rapidly that the prow of the little boat struck the white shore of their favorite island, ere she thought they were half way there. They sought -their usual resting spot, a mossy log, under the shadow of an old maple. They sat down upon it, and for a long time neither spoke. Yet sweet words were trembling upon the lips of each, and a sweeter bliss hovering like a dove about their hearts. A 'light breath of wind, drifted through the boughs which hung above them. It startled a whole bevy of dry leaves, and as they came flut- tering down, one of them, a blood-red one it was, and perfect every way, floated into Margaret's curls and became entangled in the silken hair. Drawing it from it's soft resting place, Edward laid it gently in her hand. "How beautifuli" she said, as she gently stroked it, "I will carry it  j home with me, as a memento of this little isle."  "You will carry home more than that, Marga-  ret. Don't you believe so?"            ; There was an added sweetnessto the rich tones  of his voice, and as the maiden lifted her eyes to . his, she read his meaning plainly.

The daylight was fading fast ere they thought of their, return, and before the little boat came to its home-wharf, the shadows had deepened and lengthened into night.) But in the sunshine that played about their souls they saw it not, and as they wound up the steep ascent that led to the cottage, Margaret seemed walking over roses in- stead of treading upon sharp, flinty stones. But as the lights of home twinkled upon her sight, the current of her thoughts were changed, and she began to wonder if her mother had not worried over her long absence, and hurrying her steps, was just crossing the piazza, when little Harrie darted from the front door, and catching her dress, cried mournfully, "She isdying mother, 0, my mother." Margaret could never tell how she reached the sick romy, nor could she ever forget the white, still foritihat- lay there with half closed eyes and bright, warm blood gushing from the purple lips. "Must she die ?" she asked wildly of the phy- sician. "   O.0do not say so I" Very tenderly the old man laid his hands upon her throbbing temples, and very low and gentle was his voice, as he said, "-She must, my daugh- ter. She can never see another sunrise."   THE BRIDE OF THE HEART.      128 For a little While Margaret sct stupified; the blow, heavy at any time, seeming more so now, from the joy that had just been beaming over her future. She sought her room, and in its quiet looked up to God for help and strength. He kindly gave it, and when she came back, not the physician himself was more calm and self-pos- sessed. The night waned, and still the sufferer lay there in unconsciousness, the life-stream flowing over her white bosom. Not until the ~day broke was there any change. But then the drops came fewer, and as Margaret wiped off the last small purplish one, the lips remained clear and white. She moistened them with. wine. They quivered. Margarbt put her ear to them. A faint, almost imperceptible sound stole from  them--these words, barely audible -"husband - children." The eyes unclosed.  You know us, mother," whispered Margaret. A sweet smile fluttered over her face, Harrie stooped and kissed her- Margaret too, and then each took a hand and knelt beside her. The physician and Edward-had foreborne to approach the couch after conscious- ness had returned, but as her strength seemed increasing, they ventured near. She gave them looks of recognition. Edward placed his arm tenderly about the waist of his betrothed, and whispered, " Let us tell her  her blessing would be so precious." And then he bent his lips to the dying ear, and spoke a few words. "God bless you both." It was a distinct utterance, though very low. The last, too, she ever spoke.  &#xD;<pb n="124-125" xml:id="VAC7838-00000063"/> - -* d. t CHAPTER X1V.      1 THE LITTLE CHTLP-WIFo. THE funeral was over, and Margaret sat alone in her princely city home. Her father had not yet returned, but was expected the coming week;. and as she sat-there, in that old familiar rqom1, where--the family were wont to meet at evening, she wept for the mourner who had yet to learn of his great loss. "My poor, dear father," she whispered, and wept again as she thought of the cold, damp night that would settle on his heart. Alas I she little thought of a colder darker one that was settling on her own. The door bell rung, and in a moment a servant entered witha- letter. She tore it open without looking at the envelope, for she was expecting a note from Edward. -Ee had accompanied her to the city,and been as a brother in her great affliction, relieving her of every care. But what ails the maiden as she sits there with that paper crushed in her two hands. Her face is-white-and icy cold, her eyes are blind, her-lips rigid,;and dark purplish colors settle under her finger nails. Yet she does not faint; O, if she could but lose her sensesl But no. Though her heart seems breaking, she canpot pass away. The hours glide on and still she sits there, in her mute grief.

The gray-haired pastor and his feeble wife were not yet up, but they hurried to rise, as their little maidof all work told them a strange lady had called to see them;. "Pardon me," said Margaret, in a sweet, sad tone, as they entered the breakfast room, " par. don me for disturbing your rest so early. But I could not wait for etiquette." I am Margaret Belden. Tell me all." They did so, and as they spoke, the shadows darkened about her fair young life, till the sun- shine was shut out entirely. "Let me see her, I will be very calm," said she when the story was over. "Wait awhile," said the old lady, kindly, " and drink this cup of tea." Margaret strove to swallow, but in vain. ("Lead me to her;" she asked it so .earnestly, that they could no longer refuse, but opened a door and motioned her to enter.' It was a tiny bed-room, but beautiful from the exquisite neatr :ness that reigned there. Snow-white curtains draped the little window, and the low couch, while the light from the fire that sparkled on the -hearth, was reflected in a thousand hues by the highly polished stand and little low rocker.   &#xD;<pb n="126-127" xml:id="VAC7838-00000064"/> 126   THE PET OF THE SETTLEMqWNT. , A young girl lay upon the bed, her face white as its fair pillows, save that uipon each cheek was a small spot of scarlet. Masses of golden hair were pushed back from a forehead of exquisite purity, and fell upon her shoulders. Two little wasted hands, clear and colorless, were crossed above the breast. Her eyes were closed when they entered, but they soon opened, and then Margaret saw they were of a fair May-blue. She looked wondoringly at the strange lady; then inquiringly at the old man. "Leave us together,"' said Margaret. "We !   will soon get acquainted," and as soon as they were alone, she took the little white hands in her own, and said in her softest tone "You are Annie Lee-I am Margaret Bel. den - hush -not a word till I have done.

And then she lifted the-almost baby form from the bed, threw a shawl about her, and tak-Lqg her in her lap, sat down with her before the fire, and bade her tell her all she knew about Edward Somers. She did so. Not at once, but in, broken sen- tences, for she was very weak. He had been thrown from his horse a year before, and carried into the parsonage as the nearest place of succor. A broken limb confined him there for weeks, and **  *    f        THE LITTLE CHTT)-WIF s  127 she, Annie Lee, a girl of sixteen, the grand. daughter of the pastor, had been his nurse, and there had learned to love him. "I did not dream he could love me," said she, " he was so wise, and had seenso many lands, while I was only a poor little country girl who had never been out of the village I was born in, and who could only read and write. But when the summer was over, as he had- grown well, and'was to leave us, I used to cry myself to sleep every night I lived,:I loved him so dearly, and yet could never be any thing to him, but his little nurse. He found me crying once; I did not mean he should; and then, when I could not'answer him as he asked me why I wept so bitterly, he took me in his arms and said the same as you did just now, dear lady, -aid I should be his little child-wife. It seemed a dream, but I was very happy," and she nestled her golden head against Margaret's heart, that heart now so torn. "Yes, I was very happy and hardly cried when he went away. He used to write me sweet, long letters, and send- me pretty books, and once there came this," and unbuttoning her night-dress, she showed Margaret a gold chain about her neck. and resting on her heart a locket. She would have unclasped it, but the lady put it back, say- ing quietly, " some other time." "He came once to see me  only once- he  . was very kind, but somehow he did not seem. the same to me. He talked of books and-travels and- many things, but not a word of love; and he only kissed me twice, when-he came and when he went away. Then I didn't hear from him for a long while.

"Margaret, what mean you? What has come between you and me?" Anfiie Lee." She spoke the words slowly, solemnly.    He covered his face with his hands, and great drops trickled through his fingers. Then he paced the room wildly; then came and knelt be. side her and exclaimed passionately, "Must both our hearts be broken, both our lives made hapless that that child may have her way." "Aye,"' answered Margaret, but here her for- titude forsook her, anti  wringing her hands, she said plaintively, "Edward, Edward, how could you deceive me." "Deceive you, darling," he cried tenderly, "Margaret, I never did. My heart and hand were my own when I offered them to you. In. deed my heart had always bhen. True, when I felt the slender hands of Annie Lee about my- head, her little fingers twining my hair about them, or else softly'touching my brow, I used to think it would be very sweet to own those hands, very sweet to have such a loving, tender little creature ever about me, for, Margaret, I had never known a mother's or sister's dear caresses or precious sympathy, but even then I never, never once thought of asking her to be my wife.

On the impulse of the moment, I sought her out and of- fered her my heart. BuJI argaret, the rash act was repented of as soon as I was calm. You know the rest. Do not say that I deceived you.

It did not surprise him, 1^ t  for he knew that she had idolized her mother and he knew that her cares must have been very heavy. ; To her sorrow for the dead he laid it all, and she did not undeceive him; never to him or any other, did she speak of that greater sorrow.

She i reproached herself for it the next moment, say- ing sadly, " must I step upon a grave to win my love; must there be death ere bliss can come!" And then she bowed her knee and prayed; pray- ed that the All-Father would keep her from vain hopes and make her content with a father's and a brother's love. Yet a sweet peace came to her after that, for she felt that Edward when his "days of mourning were over, would seek her out -she felt that life may have a deeper, broader meaning than it could while she was only a sister and a daughter - that their might be a holier tie to bind her to the earth. But weeks lengthened into months, months into years, and yet he never came. The sus- pense of hours is terrible, but when it drags for years, it'wears upon the heart like madness on the brain.

But this wild storm misled me, and--   well, I am here, and to- morrow I shall see your father, and soon, God willing, you shall be all my own."   CHAPTER    XV. THE PRIGHT. IT Was Margaret's wedding day--a brilliant June morning, with soft, pearly clouds floating over the blue heavens, and a rich, golden atmos- phere bathing the woodland and prairie. There was a flush of beauty on all things, the smile of the early summer time. The short grass quiver- ed with the delicate whisperings of the breeze; the purple violet, the crimson wild rose, and the white and pink-tinted pride of the prairie, were in full bloom, while the scarlet strawberry lifted its tempting clusters on every sunny bank. Birds were singing in every tree of the forest, while every breath of wind that swept through it, was changed into music by the light, harp.. touch of the fair, green leaves. Smiles were glorifying every face in the settlement, for not one amongst them but had learned to dearly love the pale lady from the east, and all were rejoiced to know that brightness had come back to her oft tearful eye and gladness to her so long sad heart. They were to be married in the open air, as there was no dear old. parish church with its holy chancel. A picturesque green spot on the edge of the woodland had been selected for the ceremony, both from, its exceeding beauty and 185  &#xD;<pb n="136-137" xml:id="VAC7838-00000069"/> 136   THE PET OF THE SETTLEMENT. its vicinity to Mr. Belden's cabin. An altar had been constructed out of green boughs, and just behind it a beautiful little alcove had been curi- ously wrought out of wild grape vines and climb- ing roses. Old logs, covered with soft, green mosses, were arranged in a semi-circle to serve - as seats for the bridal guests, while outside them several rustic tables had been framed, their rude cabinet work deftly concealed by the heavy, - snow-white damask linen which the emigrants yjet retained as relics of richer days. Flushed and weary with the warm and toil- some duties that devolved upon her as mistress of her father's household, -Margaret, late in the forenoon, took little Allie by the hand and throwing on their sun-bonnets, ran out of doors, as. she said, to catch a breath of fresh air. A bridal feastin a new country is one of its sub- stantial " institutions," and as everybody in the Boone Settlement, and all for miles around, had been invited to partake of this, an almost end- less variety and'quantity of food was of necessity to be prepared. Margaret and her lover would both have preferred a strictly private ceremony, for they felt that solemn as the occasion ever is to the really :thoughtful, it was intensely so in their case, coming as it did to crown with glory, years of blight and sorrow. But Mr. Belden and Harrie were always for giving the greatest joy to the greatest number, while Uncle Billy said the "people "' would all feel hurt and slighted, and so- the bride and bridegroom gracefully yielded their, own wishes and made calculations to entertain all the settlers. Margaret had -endeavored to lighten the labors of the' bridal morn by beginning her prepara,   THE FRIGHT.       137 tions some days beforehand. Her cake had been all baked on Saturday, - and that calke! It was the talk of the women-folks in --the place for weeks and months, for the " like of it " had never before been eaten on that prairie. There were sheets of golden sponge and lily-white silver, loaves of rich pound cake and fruit, plate after plate of crisp cruellers, seed cookies, and sweet doughnuts, and to crown all, a mammoth and genuine wedding cake, its snow-white frosting wrought into beautiful emblems. Her bread, biscuit .and rusk, a flour barrel full, had been baked on Monday, her pies and tarts, dozens of the first and hundreds of the latter had been prepared on Tuesday, but all her meats had to be left till the day of her wedding. Since daylight the bride had been at work, assisted by old Grandmother Symmes and Uncle Billy, who said he knew more about meat-cooking than allthe women in the country, in fact -could get along without women very well, if it were not for wask- ing up the pots and pans. Stewing and roasting and baking, they had at length cooked it all up, and a generous all it was - chicken pies, roast chickens, roast lamb, roast veal and sirloin, boiled hams and boiled beef, stews and fricassees, and to complete the series a pair of baked pigs, stand- ing upright on the platters, their ears and tails decked with bridal ribbons, tufts of parsley in their mouths, dandabout the neck of each, a string of pure white birds' eggs, which glistened and tinkled like so many fabulous pearls. Yes, the bride had toiled that morning over oven and stove and hearths and was glad enough to see the last dish drawif out and pronounced perfect. Very welcome ;fi her was the soft Ty 1.0(  &#xD;<pb n="138-139" xml:id="VAC7838-00000070"/> 138   THE PET OF THE SETTLEMENT. breeze with its perfumed breath, and unwittingly she walked furthe'r than she had meant to, and came at length to the green altar, beside which, in a few hours, she was to speak the holiest words of earth. The beauty and coolness of the spot was enticing, and she sat down in the little al- cove, and throwing off her bonnet, pushed back her luxuriant hair and prepared "to enjoy for awhile the rest and quiet of the shadowy glade. Softly did the breeze fan her temples and cheeks, sweetly did the birds thrill their rich notes, while like fairy whispers seemed the rustle of the wind among the leaves. For awhile despite thefsooth- ing influences about her, Margaret's thoughts ran on the varied' household duties of the day; but soon she fell into a calm, sweet reverie, beautiful visions floating before her mental sight. Once or twice she stirred-uneasily and looked wearily ai rd, for she-had never been so strong-hearted since, as she was before she gazed into the fiery eyes of the bear upon the beach; but though almost sure she had heard a crackling in the underbrush behind her, she at neither time said anything, and after awhile forgot to be fearful, and closed her eyes in a delicious trance. She was aroused by Allie's springing into her lap suddenly, and encircling her neck with both hands, and, starting up, she became aware that' the little one was fearfully frightened. "What is it, darling? Whydlo you shake so? Are you hurt? Tell Maggie."  "Injun catch Allie-ugly Injun-there he comes - run sissy - run 1"And clutching Mar. garet's waist convulsively, the child hid her scared eyes in the folds of her sister's dress. Margaret rose quickly, but hardly had she taken   THE FRIGHT.      139 a step forward ere a heavy hand was laid on her shoulder, and turning instinctively she met the glaring eyes of a strange Indian. !"Lost, lost -" she cried, for although within sight and sound of home, she could not hope for aid, for the hand of the savage was tightening its grasp and his tomahawk gleaming in the air. Another minute and she would be the bride of death, her long, dark curls hanging to the mur- derer's belt, instead of nestling on-a bridegroom's heart. "Save me, save me 1l" she called in frantic tones, as the iron flashed in the sunlight. There was a whizzing in the air, and then a sound, as when a human body falls, smitten with faintness, Margaret turned her pallid face. Her foe had met a stronger one, and grasped now in the death-throe. She closed her eyes for an instant, hardly knowing whether she were awake ortin some fearful dream. A light touch upon her hand aroused her, and looking up, she saw White Cloud gazing tenderly at her. "Is the White Dove hurt?" he asked; " her hands shake and her lips are like the snow." "Not hurt, my brother, but so frightened. Another minute and he would have had my scalp. O, my saviour, my saviour," and she wrung his hands, " what can I ever do to pay you for this timely act 1I "White Clould want no pay.

Couched in the dense foliage of a maple, he had seen- Margaret and Allie come to the altar, and soon after the strange Indian peering at them through the thicket. Unwilling to alarm them, unless it should be necessary, he had sat with his arrow pointed, until that fearful moment when Margaret cried out for help. e Then me let it fly," he said, and with his olden thirst for-blood, fresh upon him, he pointed with a triumphant smile to the arrow, deep in the heart of the Sioux. But soon new and 'better thoughts came to him, and telling Margaret to say nothing of it till to-morrow to any one, as it would only make them fearful and spoil the comfort of the day, he proceeded to drag the dead body away and to*cover the gory grass with fresh leaves and moss. "My ponyt is 'here," he said, when he had restored the space about the altar to its former beauty, " me string Sioux on him back and gallup him to the river and he go down, down to the big water."  t,         . .   CHAPTER X VI. THE FOREST BRIDAL, FIVE o'clock, the hour for the bridal, struck at * last, and punctual to the moment, Margaret came from her little tent and met her bridegroom. Very beautiful and holy was the expression that rested on her countenance, as she so trustingly placed her hands in his. She was somewhat pale from the fearful adventure of' the morning, yet years of habitual self-possession enabled her to appear perfectly calm. She was simply attired in a robe of delicate India mull, which fell in graceful, cloud-like folds about her regal figure. The lace about her neck was fastened by a pearl pin, the gift of Edward, and this was her only ornament. A veil would have been out of, place among those simple people, and so her rich- dark hair was simply braided into a broad coronet and adorned with a wreath of the tiny, snow-white blossoms of the prarie star-grass. She had laid out a pair of dark kid slippers, as the white satin ones Harrie had brought her that spring from the River," were too dainty for a woodland bridal, but on going in to dress, she had found upon her pillow a pair of Indian sandals, wrought from the soft, white skin of the mountain goat, and embroidered with pure white beads, the band "1 . . ':..A  &#xD;<pb n="142-143" xml:id="VAC7838-00000072"/> "2   THE PET OF THE SETTLEMENT. about the ankle deftly strung with tiny, pearl- covered river shells. Recognizing in an instant White Cloud's exquisite taste, she placed her feet within- them, and with every motion, heard the low, yet sweet and silvery music of the chiming shells. "My'beauteous bride," Edward exclaimed, in- voluntary, as he came to meet her. "My glori- ous bridegroom," she. felt. like saying, as she gazed upon him. There was no trace of the hunter-priest, save in the thrilling glances of his brilliant eyes and the mellow tone of his rich voice. The long, raven locks were shorn, and  short, soft ones clustered now in luxuriant waves about his ample forehead, from which the olive stgain had long been washed. The beard too had been trimmed, and the whole contour of his face was thus changed, and he looked now what he really was, a noble man in the early prime of life. A suit of glossy black, relieved' only by a Marseilles vest as white as snow, became him far better than his olden suit of deer-skin, and reveal ed the fine proportions of his well-knit form. Indeed they were a handsome pair, and every eye lingered with pleasure on the queenly beauty of the bride and the royal .graces of him'on whom she leaned. A few moments of quiet bustle and the pro cession moves to the chancel in the forest. The clergyman, who was the chaplain from the fort below, walked at its head. -Then followed Mr. Belden and Uncle Billy, the fathers by blood and adoption of the happy couple; then the two youthful groomsmen, Harrie and White Cloud, and the still younger maids, little Allie and the Indian boy's foster sister, a little brown girl of , ..   T1HE FOREST BRIDAL.    14.3. seven years. Then came Edward and Margaret, and following after, the young girls and children of the settlement, all robed in pure white dresses, wreaths of violets upon their heads, and bouquets of wild roses and pinks in their hands. The young men, with white favors in their button- holes, brought up the rear, the elder members having gone on an hour before. It was a picturesque scene, that little green' spot in the wilderness, as the bridal party enter- ed, and an American artist would have won both fortune and fair fame, to have truly pictured it. Fifty sturdy pioneers, clad in clean homespun, stood about in various attitudes, their frank open faces radiant with 1ght from their honest hearts. Upon the mofy  logs, sat as many noble women, their coai garments betokening thrift and neatness, while their pleasant faces told- of their sympathy with the fair girl whose bridal they had come to witness. Grouped here and there among. them, were friendly Indians, with their dusky squaws, all arrayed in th6ir most gorgeous trappings, their presence height- ening the wild, western look of the picture. Flitting among the tables with the agile step of twenty, went old Grandmother Symmes, every look and gesture betokening that she felt the importance of the post assigned her, that of keep- ing the feast free from the incursions of birds and bees, and never did one trill a louder note, or the otherwhiz his wings, ere her long green bough was waved with a solemnity that was almost ludicrous. The tables themselves added greatly to the beauty of the scene, the substantial character of the festival being gracefully relieved -by the deli- cate cake with its wreaths of roses, the cut glaso ,  &#xD;<pb n="144-145" xml:id="VAC7838-00000073"/> "4   THE PET OF THE SETTTLEMENT. goblets filled to the brim with candied honey, the tall fruit stands with their fringes of wild straw- berries, and the countless vases with their wealth of prairie -blossoms.

Then all is-still for a : moment. And then the solemn words of the / ceremony are spoken: "There's a whispered vow of love As side by side they stand, And the drawing of a snow-white glove From a little trembling hand, And the glitter of a ring, And a tear, that none may chide,- These, these have changed our Margaret, And she is now a bride." "God bless you, my children," said Mr. Bel- den, in a voice that fruitlessly strove to be calm, as he pressed his fatherly kiss upon his fair child's lips and shook hands with his new son. "That's what I say, too," said Uncle Billy, with a strange quivering in his tones, as he too gave his pre- cious adopted ones the kiss and grasp of con- gratulation. "And he will, too," continued the old man as he mingled with the crowd, and then he- wiped his eyes and turned to look again upon the newly wedded ones. "A merry honeymoon, my sister-- much joy, new brothers cried Harrie in his jubilant way, and, then he lifted little Allie that she might kiss Margaret; but when she would have pressed her lips to Edward's he playfully drew her away, and told, with mock earnestness, that "he didn't deserve a kiss, for he had robbed them of a sister and was going to carry her away off into the -woods to live with him."

"But where will me live then, Hally?" "Where, darling?" And he caught her to his bosom. "Why, don't you know you are to be my own little wife, just as you are now, my own little sweetheart; say, pretty bird of the prairie?" "And you will put a little ring on my finger, Hal," and she looked up to him with such a sweeth childish trust, that. the merry boy was subdued at once into the -grave man, and he whispered solemnly, "Yes, Allie-a wedding ring, if so be it God permits." While this by-scene was going on, the crowd had been gathering about the bridal pair, offer- ing them homely but honest salutations, some of which made' Margaret smile, while others brought a bright blush to her cheeks. Then the word was given to pass to the sup. per, and a pathway for the bride and bridegroom was opened. At every step, sweet wild flowers were thrown lovingly at their feet, till they literally walked on roses, lilies and fair, meek violets. - , The afternoon had been cloudy, not darkly so, but only enough to soften its June brightness into a mellow tone, but just as the guests were seated, the sun came out again and threA:an almost dazzling light into the little glade, whili  a golden glory seemed to -rest upon them all. W. "It is the smile of the:Good Spirit," whispered White Cloud to Margaret- ' a sign that my pale sister will be glad in the lodge of her brave." 13   &#xD;<pb n="146-147" xml:id="VAC7838-00000074"/> CHAPTER XVII. WHTE CLOUD'S ATONEMENT. THE husband and wife sat together in the alcove alone-for the elder members of the settlement had returned to their homes shortly after su set, while the y'ounger ones were now dancingl gaily in Mr. Belden's cabin, to the music of Tomymmes' violin. Moments and even hours passed on and yet they sat there, his arm thrown tenderly about her waist, while her head rested lovingly upon his breast. It was the trance of love, that dear, delicious ecstacy of heart, which cometh onde only in a life-time. It was broken by the voice of Mr. Belden, say- ig gently, the night dew is very heavy, Mar- garet, a  nd yu are thinly dressed. Had you not better come in?" Yes, father I have been very thoughtless," and as she leaned on Edward's arm, she whis- pered, " but how could I help it, I was so happy.   " HiA silent kiss upon her lips was her only l"'Come Allie- its most time our little pet wasoput to bed; she will be sleepy in the morn- ing.

"Comei with me," said Mr. Belden, in surprise, "Why, no. I sent her an hour ago to call you. Isn't she here?" "We have neither seen -nor heard her," said Edward, while Margaret shrieking out the name of her pet, clung for a moment convulsively to her husband's arm and then fainted. They bore her quickly to the cabin, and while the husband strove by every way to bring back the light to her eyes and the/color to her cheek, Mr. Belden briefly told them of Allie's disap. pearance.  Scarcely had the words fallen from his lips, ere White Cloud threw off his embroidered robes, and seizing his bow and arrows and sticking a hunting knife in his belt, whispered a few words in Sac to Uncle Billy and darted off into the darkness. Time passed. Midnight: and morning came and yet no tidings of the little one. Margaret had recovered enough to tell them of the Indian in the alcove, but still lay on her husband's arms so white and weak that he feared the fright would kill her. It seemed certain now that there was a design upon Allie in the morning, and that the Indian would have slain her sister, the better to secure the child, . "Fatherless--motherless," cried Harrie bit- terly-' why could not heaven spare her to those who loved her so de'arly. Must she too be sacrificed. It is too much. I wiU go and seek her.

But, fortunately for her and them, the lad, came unexpectedly on a trail which ,he knew'to be that of a Sac hunter, for th-ey had then crossed..Ahe Iowa line.

Frank was away, spending that year at a private academy to fit for college, and consequently I became the victim of his low humors and boyish wickedness. ;"Being secluded in a great measure from girl. ish companions, I poured forth my lighter affec. tions upon my pets, of which I had many, both animate and inanimate. 'I had a large garden, all my own, with hot-beds and green-house, and very happy was I in the cultivation of my fruit and flowers, and very proud to offer them to our guests.

I was timid then,'and he: found it out, and was continually darting out upon me from behind trees and fences, with yells that scared me nearly to death. He would lay in wait for me as I passed through the dark cor-. ridors of our old-fashioned house, and seizing me sometimes by the hand, would pinch me till I was black and blue, and at another time by the neck, until he nearly strangled me. Then he would picture horrid- figures on the walls of my, chamber, with phosphorus, which, glaring upon me/ ing the darkness, would nearly drive me crazy.

And when, driven to: desperation, I threatened to complain of him to my guardian, he would draw his dirk, or point his pistol at me, and threaten to kill me if I lisped; but a word of it.

Costly engrav- ings replaced my defaced drawings; expensive annuals filled my book-case; new music covered my piano, while a rosewood work-box and writ- ing desk, inlaid with pearl and with gold fix- tures complete, found their way mysteriously into my chamber. Singing birds, in'gilded cages, were hung in my parlor windows; a miarbleo basin, with shining gold and 'silver fish, glistened on the, lawn, while a' dove-cote, with a whole. brood of snowy inmates, was reared in a single night. China baskets laden with ripe fruit or' berries were found on my table each morning, while the mantel was ever radiant with vases of: delicate flowers. aIn short, we -became as fast friends as we: had before been open enemies, and for two years, life was again a blissful reality. At the expira- tion of that time, Frank, who had by intense' labor, completed his legal studies, came to met and told me what I had long known, that I was; dearer to him than all the world beside.

THEWinter that succeeded the rescue of Allie's mother was a   very pleasant and profitable one to the little. prairie settlement. Mr Belden and Mr. Somers had formed a co-partnership, and were intending: to..build a fine saw and grist mill on the following spring, the -rare business talent  of the former balancing the capital which the latter had raise from his eastern funds. This wasJust whadt'h beenlong needed there, every Stick of sawed lumber having'to be , hauled" forty miles, and every sack of flour sixty a It was calculated to give an impetus, not only toevery branch of business,but to improvements of everyn kind, and moreover it was hoped it would stimu- lato the tide of emigration and centre it at this particular site.  A' portable saw-mill had been brought on early inthe fall, to furnish lumber: for the building of ' therills, and it was kept constantly running. Besides the hands he employed here, Mr. Belden 'ke'pt' three :all the time in the timber, cutting down trees and chopping out logs, which busines alsooccupied the head of every family, all being anxious to make many improvements the next 190      ,  ,   SUNSHNE.       191 . season. Buzz went the saw from Monday morn- ing two o'clock till Saturday night at ten .clouds of smoke, the incense of its honest industry  , continually rising, now, when the air was still, in a lofty, pearl-white column, and then, when- the winds raved and roared, flitting about in shapes as varied and beauteous as those that hovered above. Sharply rang the axes in the woodland, from the dusk of Monday morning till Saturday's twilight, hundreds of glorious old forest trees falling only to rise again, not as the green and' leafy bowers of singing birds, but as the snow- white cottage-homes of thre and loving hearts, as the spacious' marts' of trade, the dusty, noisy workshop, the busy, humming school-house and the quiet parish-church, sacred to prayerful souls and choral notes. A heavy body of snow fell early in December,  and lighter storms succeeded just often enough to keep the timber roads in good order for the ox-teams that daily traversed them, The "haul: ing" was all done by the emigrant boys, the men at the clearing chaining on' the logs for themI ' and those at the mill unloading*. It was a lively,  merry sight to see them stringing,along, some- times a dozen of them .in a. pile, with the young drivers now seated astride of their load, cracking, their goads till they rang like.' clarion tones in the clear, frosty air,-and then leapng into the, snow, stamping their feet, swinging their arms  snapping their hands and rubbing their re, , noses, and when the chilled blood again weh t  coursing in hot currents, through their;veinsr t  see them pelting each other with snow-baU, and to hear their joyous shouts and cheery whistl; mingle with their gee u there aw, haw, gee   ,: nowa          , .  *        r , .

Six of the latter boarded and lodged with them, the three wood-men having put up a rough-cabin in the timber for a winter home, and one of them coming up every night with'a huge empty basket which was destined to carry back the nexty/day's rations. ;Mr. Belden attended to the milling and log- ging, seldom sitting down in the house from early morning unlil -twilight. Mr. Somers, while he exercised a sort of general care over the house- hold, still found time to flit about in his, old , :phantom-like way, ministering to-day to a poor Indian, to-morrow tending the fevered bed of a lonely pioneer, and then cheering the hearth of some home-sick emigrant with substantial gifts, and brightening his heart with healthful visions. , Uncle:Billy and Harrie took care of the larder, and nev-erdid a day pass without their- bringing in-something to replenish the constant drain made upon it by so many wolfish appetites. Now "it was a fine buck, to fat that Margaret could ' . .    .,.

And in the early springtime, when the thawing sloughs and ponds were lively with the returning geese and ducks, the hunters' shot-guns brought down many a pair each day; and while the men feasted upon them as stuffed and roasted they came hot from the spit, the provident housekeepers stuffed cushions and pil. lows with the snow-white and rainbow-colored feathers. At that time too, they made excur- sions to the beautifiul "Clear Lake," that slept so sweetly in a dip of prairie, with olden trees fringing its shores, and watched the pickerel leap about in the sunny waves-- watched, but with hunters' eyes, as barrels filled to the'brim with  the delicious fish, attested. White Cloud, strange as it may seem,-was the home-boy of the household. The death of:his old father and mother; which occurred: shortly after his return from the Sioux country, seemed the. last tie that bound him to his tribe,. while the tender and faithful kindness of'Margaret to 17  &#xD;<pb n="194-195" xml:id="VAC7838-00000098"/> 194   THE PET OF THE SETTLEMENT. -the two aged ones in their days of weakness and pain, endeared her more closely than ever to his hearts and cemented the affectionate tie which ,had before existed between them. Shortly after, their decease, he became a member of Mr. Bel- den's family, and a most -faithful and efficient aid he proved himself. He it was who'hauled from the forest the massive logs that filled the ample jambs each wintry night; he it;was who kept Margaret's pile of oven-wood evenly replenished; who brought her wash-water from the sloughs, kept her coppers and kettles always bubbling, emptied her tubs, strung her lines and brought -in her frosty clothes. He it was who dressed the game, cleaned the fish, and turned the spit, cold and heat being alike unheeded, He it was who made Harrie's bows after the true Indian pattern, who fashioned his flint-headed arrows, who taught him to snare the wolf and fox, and make robes for himself out of their skins, to cross the broad prairie when the sun was hidden, and to find his way out of the timber when the pole-star was clouded. Indeed he and Harrie seemed to have changed places) for while the latter revelled in hunting and trapping excursions, the former, after reveal- ing to him-the secrets of his wood-craft, would sit- quietly in the cabin, ready to do Margaret's ,lightest bidding, and when the daily chores were finished, pore over the well thumbed volumes which one and another had given him. H- He had opened his heart to her and begged she would help him. Once, he said, his ambition was:to :be a mighty chief, so fierce and terrible that the pale-faced women should still: their' naughty chil. dren with his name;-to have many and beau-:  F    SUNSHNE.       19b tiful squaw wives- to own lodges whose sides were hung with ermine, and whose floors were of swan-down- to wear robes of the soft, white skin of the mountain-goat, all pictured over with the blood-red story of his battles, and fringed with the scarlet scalps and long black locks of his countless victims--to die on the gory field, but with his enemy in his grasp, to be buried on his favorite horse, and be known forever as ithe ,mightiest of the Sacs. 'But now, he had put such thoughts away. He asked only to be an humble preacher of that new religion which he had first learned of Margaret - not a preacher to the white men, but to his: own poor, ignorant Indian friends. He would have them believe as he did, in the One Great God and his blessed Son, in heaven and its angels. And in teaching them the holy precepts he had learned, he would make them true and devoted Christians, living in peace instead: of war, loving instead of hating, and putting by forever that bane'to their lodgs, the fatal habit of using the fire-water of- the traders. His brown cheeks would glow with enthusi. asm, as, in his own simple but touching gestures and broken English words, he would talk to!r of this; his black eyes would now sparkle with lightning glances, and then, as over them gath- ered the mists of feeling, they would soften into almost saintly beauty, and when, at the close of each eloquent harangue, he would say, "' Me no more, Wah-peekee-puck, (the White Cloud,) the great Sac Chief, who red man hate and pale- faced scare of- but me loway (the home of the beautifuD, the good prophet who lead his red- brothers tto the heaven of the White Dove;" Jv L-V  IVsILV-UVvV   &#xD;<pb n="196-197" xml:id="VAC7838-00000099"/> 196   THE PET OF THE SETTT,EMENT. Margaret's heart would thrill with a rapturous joy and she would meekly thank God for the In- dian lad's conversion; and though her household duties kept her busy from early dawn to twi- light, she would always, no matter how worn and 'wearied she was, spend a long while with him each evening, hearing him spell out the lessons -of the day, and reading to him from his little pocket-bible, And when the hour for prayers came, kneeling beside her chair, she would have him repeat word by word after her, that holiest of them all, "The Lord's . " which he had first-listened to when he lay an aching sick boy att the White Dove's side. Her efforts to aid him in his holy wishes were earnestly seconded by every member of the house- hold. Mr. Belden, wihn he sat down to rest by the6fireside, after supper, would have him bring his slate and pencil to him, and would patiently teach him to form the figures; and when those were perfect, would set him sums, explain to him W":;:' the varied currencies of nations, their rules of  traffic and the laws of interest. Mr. Somers spent a portiorno:leach day in oral lessons to him, instructipg hi^m:'n both natural and revealed re- ligion, being careful never to bewilder his dawn- - ing powers with subtle- metaphysics or crude speculations, but imparting to him the rules of' life as Jesus himself expounded -them to the Gen- tile crowds of old. Harrie, when the stormy days of winter came, brought out from his trunks his globes and maps and gilded orrery, and tauight him, first, the noble study of geography, and afterwards the sublimer one of astronomy; and so acute was-the Indian's vision, and-so retentive his memory, that ere the snow had melted he   SUNSHtINE .  .    197 was as familliar with- the constellation as was his tutor, and would sometimes pass whole nights in the open air, watching the stars as they rose and set, and wishing, as has many a white child both before and since, that he could follow them as they dropped so silently behind the trees, and see what place they hid in till they came again. Even"lUncle Billy, unlearned in books as-the old man was, could teach the poor boy something, for sixty years of life is crowded with practical lessons, and "many of them did he recount and bid him lay to heart, " for experience," he would say, " though she's a sure teacher, boy, is yet a mighty dear one. She costs us all a sight some. times, and youngsters would do well to mind what grey-headed ones have. told them."- But next to Margaret, Mrs. Mertoun did the most for the Indian lad. Gratitude alone would- have stimulated hier to aid him, for from a terri- ble fate had his intrepid daring saved her ;: but with that feeling, there blended a sortofmotherly care and affection, and she gave her-time/ to him as faithfully as though he had been a son, and ere long he called the White Doe his mother, as he did the Whte Dove his sister. Little Bright-eyed shared the studies-he learned from ^ the new friend's lips, and it was a beauhtiful and touching sight to see the two forest; children conning so patiently their books; hearing each others lessons, repeating the sacred verses they had learned, singing the simple hymns of their -childish ritual, and then with bended knes, clasped hands, and reverent tones, saying their prayers.

Ye couldn't change his brown skin\ into white, but-ye've washed the red-stain off of that." Little Allie, three year old innocent as she was, did something for him too. Dancing and sing- tig and laughing and prattling about him, she came to his heart like a sweet, living poem, and woke into pure and beautiful life, many a thought and feeling which had else slept dormant, but Which, roused into action, flew in and out, like a bird about a nest, blessing him with its singing voice. She it was, the little cunning fairy, who did what none other would have ventured to, crept slily up to himone .ay, when he slept before the fire, worn out w ith tedious journey, and cut off the-long, black glossy hair ofwhich he had ever been so proud; and when, half in earnest, half in jest, he told her he would throw her to the moon, as the old Indian did his grandmothers she put her two white arms about his neek, laid her soft white cheek. to his coarse, brown one, and said sweetly, 'I love you White Cloud, and that is why I did it.- I want to have you for my brother, but I don't want folks to laugh at you and call- you a girl-boy, and tell me to twist up your hair as Maggie'and mamma do theirs.

When the third anniversary of Allie's advent had come with its fair blossoms and sweet berries, he was so chang- ed that his own mother could have scarcely known her boy. He could not only speak Eng- lish plainly enough to: sustain himself in all or- dinary coversation, but he spoke it correctly  too, and had even remembered ever to substitute',i , and not or never for the Indian's invariable me and no.

He had a general knowledge of all the primary studies of the school-room, while in the higher ones of botany and astronomy he was a proficient, his out-doors habits giving him a keen relish for them both. He could read the -Gospel of St. Matthew, with- out miscalling a single word; could repeat sev- eral of the shorters psalms, sing many a simple , hymns and had his memory well stored with Bible , stories, tales of travel and the wondrous things of science.  Often would Uncle Billy say to Harrie, "Ye did a good thing, bud, when ye tdbk him down with that rifle-ball-a blessed good thing. But who'd a-thought itl  Who'd ever a-thought shooting a feller in the leg was the way to lift up his soul into the heaven above!

CHAPTER XXTTIT. 'PRAIRIE CITY. THE result of the- untiring labors of the winter were seen in the spring-time, in the fine three story mill that was erected just on .the edge of the forest, on the banks of a narrow, but deep spring-fed brook, whose waters seem to run there as if they knew they would be wanted, and crav- ed the privilege of being daily drank by the thirsty, panting engine--seen in the acres of massive logs that lay piled about, waiting their turn to feel the keen teeth of the- buzzing saw- seen in countless sacks of corn and where which came in from distant settlements to make work for the dusty miller-seen in the pretty cottages that were starting up everywhere upon the prai rie and in the garden fences. that empaled them, and seen in the constant and steady rush of emi- grants, who came here because added to pure water, deep soil, rich harvests and heavy timber, were the handy saw and grist mill, without which all. their labor would be scarce more than a vexa-: tion, since to make it available they must spend half- their time in travel. Mr. Belden, his son-in-law and Uncle Billy, did now-what they had long talked of, laid out a model town, with broad, straight streets, am- 201 % A  &#xD;<pb n="202-203" xml:id="VAC7838-00000102"/> 202   THE PET OF THE-SETTLEMRENT. pie lots and spacious squares. They lined the first with forest trees, calling each own by the -name of the tree which shaded it; they set out fruit nurseries in the second; while they beauti- fied the third with anything that taste could suggest. , Mr. Belden had said, when the project of a mill was started, that the first lumber sawed should be reserved for a church, and the next for a schoolhouse, and he kept his word too, and early in the summer. and soon as the piles could be kiln-dried enough for use, he set about their erection.  The church was fashioned after the old Gothic one in which he had worshipped when a boy, and stood in- the centre of the ground Uncle Billy had given the settlement for a grave. yard, with asoft green sods and wild flowers all about it, and old trees sheltering it in pleasant shadows. They painted it one of those neutral tints, that harmonize so well with olden shapes and thuswhile faith knet in it as a holy shrine poetic genius gave it no'only a picturesque but a venerable look, and to a stranger it would seem to have been there as long as had the mossy trees. The school-house was modelled after the best and mPost approved eastern plans,- large airy rooms, with blinds to exclude the blazing sun, and hearths to warm up the frosty air, with desks -chairs'and settees, book-cases, black-boards, maps , and-: globes, . and lastly but not leastly, with one of',the loveliest, gentlest, most intelligent and Christian lady-teachers that ever a trustee found even 'our own White Doe. They loved her, the  little children, ere yet she had ever gathered' them about her; for she had been in all" their              i   PRAIRIE CITY,      203- homes, the guest of the festive board, the nurse of the painful couch, the friend of the sorrowful hour. And that love deepened and broadened with the lessons of every day, so patient, tender and faithful was she to them all, never punishing, save by a sad look, and always forgiving with an angel smile. "Ye'd better stop," Uncle Billy would say to the emigrant, who, camping out on the prairie outside the town, was halting between two opin- ions, " ye'd better stop, for ye won't find a purtier site, nor a more go-ahead town in the hull Des Moines valley. I tell ye what, I know for a sar. tainty, for I've tramped it all' over, from the ' ridge ' above here to the Gate-City down below, Only jist look at it.

Allie's mother had never been perfectly well since that 'fair June- morning, when she parted from her husband on the banks of the Des Moines. The fearful shock which her nerves received when on- awaking from her long slumber she found herself the captive of the Crouching Panther; the unspeakable anguish of her heart on learning that her beloved ones had been so cruelly torn from her, one to sleep in a bloody grave, and the other to bleach upon the prairie; the terrors of her year among the Sioux, where although cared for as tenderly as Indian affection could suggest, she was the prey of suspense and impoverished from all the comforts of civilized life; the fatigue and exposure which attended her long and hurried journey on horseback to the settlement, had together made sad ravages on a constitution naturally delicate, and' in which he- reditary consumption lay hidden like "a worm i' 208   SHADOW,        209 the bud." Thie excitement of finding hersel once more in safety and among generous, self. sacrificing friends, together with the joy of meet  ing her little one, now, the idol of her sorely. smitten heart, had been as the elixir of life to the dying, and had revived her so wonderfully that all were encouraged to -hope that long and beautiful years lay yet before her. The first winter and summer glided by without any perceptible decline of strength, and with no  symptoms of the disease that was lurking in hea veins. But early in the autumn, while watch*, ing one chilly evening beside the sick bed of a favorite pupil, a poor little motherless emigrant girl, whose father lived in an open cabin away down on a river-bluff, exposed to, damp fogs 1 and drizzling mists, she took a violent cold, which, settling on her lungs, laid her up for a month. , But with the New Year she had so far recov- ered, that she once- more gathered her little classes about her, and became again their faithful teacher. It was not long though before her side began to pain hey, her lungs to pant, her throat to feel dry, and her voice to grow husky -after every sentence.. She was sensible too of-a weary feeling, a desire to be at rest, but her sleep was feverish, and she awoke every morning languid and worn. Still she kept up, and hoping and trusting that with the opening spring she should be well again, she said nothing of her feeble- ness, but went cheerfully about her arduous duties,  Early in March, Uncle'Billy returned from a long hunt in the western part of the State. He had promised little Allie a pair of new moccas 18*     .   &#xD;<pb n="210-211" xml:id="VAC7838-00000106"/> 210   THE PET OF THE' SETTLEIMENT. Bins and an Indian mantle of swan's down, and eager to see the' delight of his pet, when she should have placed her fairy feet, in the pretty, b-eaded things, and thrown the soft white robe about her shoulders, he hastily undid them from his pack of furs, and leaving Harrie to put up the horses, for he had as a matter of course been the companion of his sport, hurried-to the school- house. "Goodness, darter, but what ails yer," he j   exclaimed, while his eyes grew misty, as he clasped her, little white and wasted hand in his rough, bronzed fingers, "have ye been worse agen?  And there was a fatherly tenderness in hisl tones. "'0O no, Uncle Billy, she said, while a sweet Vsiile as of old played aver her face, " but I am somewhat weary this afternoon--that's all. I shall be well again in the morning- that is," and she paused and coughed, a long, panting, struggling cough it was too, and she held one hand upon her\breast and the other on her side, while it lasted".- that is, if I have a good night's sleep. "May she go home with me," said the old man, abruptly, pointing -to Allie, who was examining her new gifts with childish pleasure. And hardly waiting for her to say, "-Oh, certainly, Uncle," he caught up the child and ran, and entering Margaret's room with the exclamation, "Shes dying, dying before our eyes," he dropped iAto a Beat -and brushed away the large drops which had gathered on his cheeks. IWhoo'-what has happened, tUncle Billy?" And she hurried to take Allie from him, happy enough to see her eyes so bright and her cheeks    SHADOW.,       2" so rosy, for she had thought his words applied to her. "Nlot the child, darter, but the mother - the mother. Why, darter, she's half way up to heaven already.

And again wiping his eyes, he drew the little one close to his old heart, and began telling. her of the strange and' wonderful things he had seen on the great "pararas " that stretched to the west. His words alarmed Margaret, and his manner, more even than his words ; for she saw that deep sorrow was convulsing his whole frame, and her  fears once aroused she remembered many thigs  ' before unnoted, that went to codifirm them. Anxiously did she watch beside the window for her return, and when she saw with what lan- guid, tottering steps she came up the walk, the tearslgushed to her eyes, for like sisters had they seemed to each other, from the first day of their acquaintance. 1l Wiping them off and choking down 'her sobs,  &#xD;<pb n="212-213" xml:id="VAC7838-00000107"/> 21-2   THE PET OF THE B S1'TLVLENT.* she hasteied to open the door, and saying ten- derly, "You look very tired this evening," she led her to her own little rocking chair, and put away her bonnet and cloak.

As the shadows deepened they one and all drew about the hearth, but for some reason or other there was none of the light, cheerful talk which usually gladdened that twilight- hour. Mr. Belden held Allie in his arms, and though her blue eyes were closed in sleep,-did not offer to lay her down, but frequently pressed a quiet kiss on her sweet lips. Margaret sat on the lounge, her head resting  on her husband's shoulders, her waist clasped tenderly by his two hands. Grandma Symmes sat close by the fire, her elbows resting on her knees, her chin on her hands, her eyes half closed, while a troubled look rested on her usually serene face, Bright-eyed was nestled at Mr. Belden's feet, on a low stool, stringing a neck-lace for Allie out of -briar-buds. Occasionally she would hold it up between her and the fire, and as the light flashed over the scarlet globes, her black eyes- would glisten and she would murmur a word or two in Sioux.  White Cloud and Harrie were stretched out a little to the one side on"a buffalo robe, the one motionless in .every limb, the other restless in every muscle, and occasionally striving to. relieve the silence by a snatch of lively song. Uncle Billy wandered from  the hearth to-lthe door, never for a moment setting- down his rifle, though sometimes he would lean awhile against Mr. Belden's chair and look anxiously into the L fair face of the little sleeper.

"The dev-, but hark, there it goes again," and echoing over the settlement a second time was heard the unearthly noise. This time though ittsoftened down into a something that strangely resembled a human groan, and that finally died:  away into a low, moaning murmur. I never heard the like on't but once afore," said Uncle Billy, "and that was when I went, years and years ago, to see a mad house. There was a feller there, shut up in one of the little places they call cells, with a something they call a:straight jacket put on him, to keep him from tearing fhimself and everybody else to pieces, ind he would yell in just that onearthly way." "It does sound strangely like a maniac's cry," said Mr Belden, " but I have never heard of one a6bout here. It cannot be that."'

"Goodness gracious, but you was right, Mr Belden, when you said, vengeance is mine, I will repay. If the Lord hain't repaid him for all his deviltry, then I'm mistook. Goodness, but what a sight he is." With awe-struck faces they looked upon him, the murderer,; the maniac. Here was crime blood-red, hideous, hellish crime embodied, and here too was retribution, not man's, but God's. Time passed onxand yet they stood there, keep. ing a horror struck vigil over the sight, the awfulest that human eye can look upon. The clock struck twelve. "It is the Sabbath now," said Mrs..Somers reverently. " et us begin it aright by praying for our poor sin-sick brother. His victim in his dying  hour forgave him. Shall we not do as much?" They knelt about him. He had become quiet, and seemed to sleep, and something of a human look rested now upon his countenance. They prayed, and as they prayed, the desire came full upon each heart that he might yet be restored to reason, and made a lowly penitent at God's altar. But not thus was it to be. With the morning light his paroxyms returned, and for a month it was necessary. to chain him as wild beasts are bchained.  Then his strength seemed gone and he sunk into a decline. Day by day he grew weaker and weaker, till at length he was so near gone that he scould not even move his hands. ,White and wasted, they would lay all day upon his breast, just as Margaret crossed -them in the early morning. The human look came back to his Iface as his weakness grew more deathly, his   THE MANIAC.       283 tangled beard having been cleanly shaven and his long, matted hair cut off till only short locks re-  mained, which Margaret combed and brushed till they clustered in dark curls about his forehead. "Can he last much longer,'"she asked of the physician one evening, early in November. Removing his fingers from the pulse, he' laid his ear to the sick man's breast. - "Till midnight, perhaps- may-be till sunrise, but i he is going fast." "If he would only speak; just once; just one little sentence\asking for forgiveness. It is ter- rible for him Wthus to die in his sins " and the gentle woman wrung her hands, and when again she was le'ft alone with him, she knelt beside his couch and prayed with all the fervor of her soul for him. The hours passed on. No change was visible, and one by one the watchers, -who had gathered there to see him die, quietly withdrew. Then the family retired, all but Margaret and her hus- band. He could not persuade her to leave- him. Together they were kneeling beside: him, when they were startled by a low, deep-drawn sigh. Cautiously they lifted-their heads and looked at him. His eyes, which had been half closed for several-days, were now wide open, but not glar- ing as was their wont. Instead, a soft, sad -light flickered over the dark orbs and they wandered about as though in search of some, one. "Let him see you," whispered Mr. Somers.: His wife rose to her feet, abd taking the candle in one hand, came to the bedside and tenderly placed the otherr on his brow. For a moment a beautiful 'look hovered over the man's face, while the thin-lips quivered. 20                . t   &#xD;<pb n="234-235" xml:id="VAC7838-00000118"/> 234   THE PET OF THE SETTLEMENT.      / She plaoed her ear to them. They moved * again, and the single word, "Mary,' fluttered from them. She laid her cheek, her pure, saintly cheek to his. The lips moved again. ' Angel,' he said this time.- She folded his two hands in her own and pressed- them to'her heart. The beautiful look was beatified, and a positive glory shone on his white -face. "Forgive - pray- Mary." Slowly and with trembling tones the three words dropped from the stiffening-lips. Still holding his hands, still gazing into his eyes, she prayed. She felt the fingers grow cold, she saw the eyes grow dim, the lips part and the chin droop, but still, with an unfaltering voice she prayed till 'the freed spirit had soared away, gone with its sins and its sorrows back to the God who gave it.  They buried him in the church yard, in a lonely little dell, where the shadows lay all day long. Margaret planted an evergreen at his his head' and a root of " live-forever" at his feet;  but; other monument they never reared over the 'maniac's grave, nor- did they ever learn, how he escaped from his Indian captors, or how he came to wander into their little 'settlement.   CHAPTER XXVII. THE HAPPY HOUSEHOLD. YEARS have come and gone. Five, ten, fifteen of them have cast their sunbeams and scattered their snow-flakes over the little Settlement, changing it from a straggling, border village into a populous and central town; not crowded, cramped and choked though, but spacious, broad and airy. The- arching trees that line each avenue, give it a pict'ure-look, with their cool and waving shadows, while the ample parks, with their green and tasteful hedges, their closely shaven lawns, their, clustering shrubs, their gor- geous flowers, their sparkling fountains, singing birds, tame forest pets, and chattering, dancing 'little children, are a sweet relief to the dim and bustle of its thoroughfares, and give to its busi- est denizen a taste of, that dear country life for which his heart -is panting. The wide, ten-mile prairie, which, when Mar- garet Belden first gazed upon it, was but a beau- teous blending of grasses, violets and strawherry blossoms, is now a series of fine farms, with snow- white cottages nestling in the fresh foliage of young locust trees, with ample barns, fair gar- 286  ^ ,   &#xD;<pb n="236-237" xml:id="VAC7838-00000119"/> 236   -THE PET OF THE SETTLEMENT. dens, thrifty orchards, and rich fieldas. The broad belt of woodland that encircles it, no longer hides the bear, the wolf or wild-cat in its dark recesses, but cleared of its thickets and its under- brush, is now the shaded Common of the town, where cows and sheep find free, sweet pasture, where children go a-Maying and a-nutting, where Sabbath schools hold their pic-nics, and churches their camp-meetings, and where in quiet, summer evenings, where the moonbeams, flashing their silver light through the drooping boughs, change de w-drops-into gems, young lovers stroll and utter their bethrotal vows. The river, the blue Des Moines, flowing of old in such quiet beauty at the edge of the dim forest, now ripples in mimic water-falls over costly dams, and flutters in snowy spray far into the sunshine as in foam- ing waves it dashes over the whirling wheels. The whistle of starting and stopping trains echoes pow where resounlded once the war. ' whoop of contending Sioux and Sacs. News from Atlantic and trans-Atlantic cities glides noiselessly along the silent wires at every hour, while the gossip of the day is read at morning and at evening- from the fresh papers of the East. There is change everywhere, but thank heaven, only a bright, beautiful change, which has brought hundreds of struggling, debt-ridden, homeless and hungry men and women from the crowded cities of older States, and given them peace and plenty, houses and lands, while they in grateful return have made the wilderness and the solitary place glad for them; and the desert to rejoice, and blossom as the rose."

Jt is no stately city mansion, nor modern Grecian villa, but a quaint, rambling cottage, with picturesque tero races softening the gentle eminence from which it rises, with pleasant bay-window- opening to the sunrise and the sunset, with porches draped. all over with scented vines, with cool, shady northern rooms for the burning hours of sum- mer, and warm, sunny south-west windows to sit by in the dark and freezing- days of winter, a neat, commodious and cheerful home, furnished with taste and elegance. Time has dealt lightly with its inmates. Though counting three-score years, Mr. Belden seems hardly older now than when first we saw him. A few silver threads mingle with his raven hair, but the furrows have yet to ridge his noble brow, and the curve to bend his erect and stately figure. Health, strength and happiness have kept him  young. When he walks the streets of the town that bears his name, they point him out to strangers as their richest man, but no curses ever mingle with the words they speak, for by patient, honest industry, and not by skin-flint usury, has- he amassed his wealth. The splendid Agricultural College that stands to the south-west of the town, surrounded by rich, garden-like fields, owes its existence to his gen- erous purse; the pretty school-houses that nestle- in the quiet, shady corners of the town, were built at his expense, and though stfll a worship- per in the little forest church, he has given largely towards the erection o every other in  &#xD;<pb n="238-239" xml:id="VAC7838-00000120"/> -238   THE PET OF THE -Si'"'r ,NT. the place.

Beautiful is the de. cline of years to him-beautiful with its sinless memories, its sunny present, and its bright " to come.' " Mr. and Mrs. Somers live with him still, for he would never hear of their making a separate home., Margaret is the queen-mother of the household, managing everything with such quiet tact that order, peace, plenty and joy are ever there. Her fair, girlish charms have given place to a meek, womanly dignity, and the crown of maternity rests sweetly ,on her, chastening the regal- beauty of her snowy , and softening he -brilliant light of her dark eyes. Her hus- band, the hunter-priest, as she yet sometimes fondly calls him, has more than fulfilled the vows he uttered when he first called her wife, and in the peacefulness of their home-life and their home-loves, they have almost forgotten the scorching Sahara of their early years, or remem- bering it, are doubly grateful for the greenness and the beauty of their present path, with its   opening buds and scented blossoms, its singing fountains and its shaded sunshine. Shadows tave fallen on their hearth-stone, but only the beautiful, waving ones of the little cra- dle, as the mother's foot rocked it to and fro, while she sang the morning hymn or evening liUllaby.

His bedS room resembles a hunter's lodge, with its rifles guns and pistols, its hunting knives and traps% its furs and skins, while he could easily play menagerie with his forest pets, the pair of noble elks which his Uncle Harrie brought him from the far West, and which are -so .well broken to the harness that he can drive- them  far and near; the spotted doe which he himself found when a little starving fawn, the snow-white buf. falo calf, which White Cloud bought of a tribe beyond the Rocky Mountains, the pair of swans that were sent to him from Minnesota, the geese and ducks which with them float upon his fish pond, the little brown rabbits and gray squirrels :that hide in the hedges or run lively races up the trees, and the cooing doves and singing robins that flutter in the sunshine. Frank and- fearless, affectionate and generous, he is a univer.  sal favonrite, longing for the time to come when he shall be a man and go off into the wild ter- ritories of the far North West, hunting buffalos and elks, and trapping for beaver and otter., Next 'Horace came, a delicate,-blue-eyed child, reminding his mother and grandfather of alittle pet which they worshipped once .in their old Atlantic home, a -dear onej whose sweet vie had hushed its msic, and whose' fr hands were gently folded on its' breast, ere its fujrth year had bl1ssoied.

His room they call the little museum; its walls being hung with paintings, engrmavings and maps, its shelves loaded with stones, shells, petrifactions and Indian'relics, while his tables are crowded -with vases of dried grasses, moss baskets filled with birds eggs, skeletons of forest leaves- and herbariums and Froras. Like his brother, he is open-hearted, affectionate and generous; fearless when the question is a moral one, but timid and sensitive in conflicts where physical force is needed. At :schooli Willie defends the weak and the oppress- ed with the striking eloquence that flashes from doubled fists, while Horace pleads for them in such sweet, impassioned tones, that the hardest heartiss softened.

And in midiwinter, when the snow lies deep and the winds are doing their worst, he gathers the boys of the neighborhood about his cabin hearth, and while they roast potatoes in the ashes, pop corn in the spider, crack butternuts and walnuts, and make taffy, he regales their,ears with the wild scenes he has witnessed in' the Upper Des Moines, when he was the only white man there.: It had been -a settled thing that he should ever live with them, for Mr. Somers couldd never for- get the old man's kindness-to him, when :he fell at his door a helpless, wasted invalid, and when the new house' was built, Margaret set aside a large, pleasant ground floor room and. called it Uncle Billy's.

An ample, old-fashioned fire-place, with its broad hearth-stone, gave the room a cheery look, which was heightened- by the sunshine which streamed through the large southwest windows and glass door. A: soft, neat, home-made carpet of neutral tints covered the floor, the camp-bed had a wolf- skin robe, lined with scarlet broad-cloth for a coverlet, the heavy arm-chairs and comfortable lounge were of black walnut, with:; polished leather^ cushions, while the large round table with its plain baize cover, had an acorn basket for a centre-piece, which was filled to the brim with those odds and ends which an old hunter is ever accumulating. There was a proud and happy smile on, Mar-. garet's face when everything was- in perfect order, and she uhsured him in and told him it W-as to be henceforth his- own There were tears in the old man's eyes as he saw how carefully she had noted all his wants, but he shook his h head even as he thanked her, and said, with a- - quivering voice, "It's too fine, darter; too fine for sichian old feller as I'm.

He "couldn't stand sich a close, hot room; he must feel the air circling round him.' Unwilling to have him so far from them, they immediately built a cabin close to their house, on a gentle knoll sloping to the south, and shel- tered from the north wind by a dense clump of evergreens. But when they would have hewn the logs he demurred, and insisted on having it laid up in the -true pioneer way, of rough, round timbers; and chinking it and plastering it with prairie mud, building a stick chimney, lay; ing down a puncheon floor, and hoisting a rude- loft, he looked at it rith evident satisfaction. Only one innovation he allowed; instead of .the little square hole by the door, with its slab shuts ter, he had two large twelve light windows set, for he said, he was getting purblind and couldn't see in the dark any more.", "There," said the old man, when he had taken possession and seated himself on a riide camp stool before the blazing fire, "-there, I reckon this yer one 'll last me as long as I want a homa.: I'll live with ye, darter,'" -turning to Margaret - that is, ye'll allers find me on hand when the: meals are ready, or when I can be of any kinder- use to yer, or when I want to have a right downi good bit of a talk, in fact, purty much of :the. time Ill be there; but I must have the; old cabin * to sleep in, darter. iAnd once in awhile I mutf have yer all gather in here, old and young, and eat corn-pone and broiled squirrels with me, jis. . to keep ye all, ye know, in the-memory o f the ' 1 ; .-  -  . , .- .' . .-;  &#xD;<pb n="244-245" xml:id="VAC7838-00000123"/> 244   THE PET OF THE SETTtIMENT. old times awe used to have, when ye first came to this out of the way Injun place." And they do so, and never do they see happier !hours than whenUncle Billy's cabin walls shield them from the snow and wind. Old Grandmother Symmes lives with them too, and has ever since her son Tom was drowned while trying to ford the Des Moines one stormy autumn night. He had been to play at a wed- ding dancei a few- miles west of the river, and though urged to remain till morning, refused to; because he had promised his mother he would return by midnight. Poor fellow I they found his white corpse the next day, seven miles below the ford, on a little sand-bank, his old violin strapped to his back, and so cracked and batter. ed that it could never afterwards do anything but wail and moan, no matter how skilful a hand touched its strings. Margaret insisted on the old woman's going home with them when the funeral :was over, and during the long sickness that followed the shock her poor nerves had known, nursed her as a daughter would a mother. nd when she had recovered, and spoke of going back to her lonely home, Margaret told her it was of no use for her to talk of it, for she could not possibly spare her.

And in 'drying, grating, sifting, assorting and stewing up these, washing and dressing little new babies, and nursing up the sick, the old woman spends- her days quietly and happily, her only trouble being the wonder what they will: do when she is dead and gone, for the general good health of the family and town, she attributes solely to her own wonderful success in the healing art. -Bright-eyed, or -Mary Mourton as we must now call -her, isstill with them, a dear and cherished member too, hers own native goodness of char. acter making fast friends of the family, aside from the gratitude they have ever felt towards her for the care and kindnesse she gave to their beautiful -White Doe.   She is now a stately maiden, with one of those erect and splendid figures which fancy gives ever to a forest prin- cess. Her large black eyes, radiantwith intelli- gence, and the general air of refinement, and culture which pervades her whole countenance relieves it of its Indian cast of feature, and gives it a rare, add positive beauty. As often as we have gazed upon her, we have thought of the dark-eyed daughter of the ancient Arrow-maker, ' "With her moods of shade and sunshine, Eyes that smiled and frowned alternate, Feet as rapid as the river,' Tresses flowing like-the water, Andas musical a laughter."

Under Margaret's care, she has become too a thorough. r     housekeeper, capable of caring for parlor, nur. sery, chamber and kitchen, and can sew, Knit, patch, cut and fit, crochet and embroider, equal to any artiste. She is moreover an earnest and devout Christian woman, never happier than when kneeling in the little forestschurch, blend- ing her rich alto voice with the tones of the ' organ, and listening to the eloquent sermons- of her friend and pastor. Indeed, but for the brown tint of her skin you would hardly suspect her Indian blood. Only in the color of her orna- ments and the fashion of her dress, does the wild blood betray itself. But the glossy braids of her hair are ever decked with flamne-colored :geranium- blossoms, her arched neck, twined with -crimson corals, while a brooch of rubies fastens her laces, and bracelets of the same rich gems encircled her dark arms, and instead of the- cloak or mantillas she hangs, in winter, a brilliant cashmere shawl, and in the summer, one of scarlet crape over he'r shoulders, folding them about her as gracefully as a painter would robe his queen. She has been for five years the bethrotal of White Cloud, for as Harrie oft-times laughingly told him, "He would wed the fair Daeotah, That their tribes might be united, That old feuds might be forgotten, -And old wounds be healed forever!"

I  *  X ^     CHAPTER XXJX.  THE DOUBLE BRIDAL. THE golden glory of a summer afternoon brightened that cottage home, and made it seem like fairy land to the two weary travellers, as the railroad carriage set them down at the gar- den gate. They had not been expected for a ' day or two, and thus made their way quiet into the north-east parlor, where the family sat enjoy- ing the cool and shade, ere their arrival was yet suspected. It was a joyous greeting though, that Harrie and White Cloud met, tears and smiles chasing each other,- smiles winning- the race though, "a foretaste of heavenly meetins," Uncle Billy said, as wiping his old eyes, he hastened tofind Allie, the only absent member. He had seen her gathering white rose-buds an hour before, and rightly guessed she had gone to the old oak trees to weave them in a chaplet for the snowy marble.  that marked the resting place of her beloved ones. She was kneeling on her mother's grave, and, there were tear-stains on her cheeks and tears dew in her' eyes. She had been to th e Mercy.
