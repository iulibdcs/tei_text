            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>SILENCE reigns in the streets. How solemn is the repose of the great city. Afar off,
               by the woods, there is always quiet. The river, the hills, the groves are never
               noisy; yet they have a voice in the breeze, or, when God calls in the storm. Calmly
               the city sleeps; tranquilly, after the tumult of the day.</p>
            <p>Hushed are the strivings of the people; the carriages of the rich, the footsteps of
               the poor no longer disturb me. A breeze is passing from south to north; it has raised
               the curtains, and is fanning the cheeks of my little ones who are at rest.</p>
            <p>The moonlight has entered too, and is reposing by my daughter. She has forgotten
               every care, though, a few hours ago, it was a rare trouble to decide on the color of
               a sash. Her right hand is on her heart. Unconscious, she reclines—the type of woman.
               On her left hand rests her cheek, and over the pillow flows her brown hair. Her lips
               are parted; she murmurs in her sleep, for she is weary. She turns, and sighs, and
               turns again. Yet, on every feature is<pb n="vi-vii" xml:id="VAC6361-00000004"/>
               written health. Why, then, anxiety? She will sleep and be refreshed, against the
               birth of "another blue day."</p>
            <p>A child of my neighbor's has fallen into a sleep from which the arousing is far
               distant. The resonance of this morning's funeral bells is still in the air;
               trembling, I bend over the couches of my darlings. My babe! how gentle is his
               breathing! how exquisite the native grace of his attitude! How lovely his white and
               rounded limbs!</p>
            <p>Alas! for the mother who is weeping, now, at this midnight hour. She looks not for
               the morning; the grave encloses her lost one. Yet the morning will come.</p>
            <p>I have loosed my bracelet from my arm; it lays on the table, its clasp of gold
               flashing in the gas-light. The hair of the little maiden who is sleeping there, forms
               its band, and, as I touch a spring, there is, bound with a lock of my own, a golden
               tress, brighter, it would seem, that the head it once adorned is dust. Yet, "it is
               well with the child!" So, may the morning come to this desolate mother, who has bent
               her o'er the dead. Time will teach her to say, It is well.</p>
            <p>Standing on the hill of life, for a moment, I turn and look back. I see moving among
               the shadows of the past, a fair infant. She is playfully commencing the ascent. She
               sighs, tired with her first efforts; an angel approaches with wings stretched upward,
               and bears her to that home, "whither the spirit was to go."</p>
            <p>But she who has come a little way—who is still ascending—how will it be with her? Oh!
               as I look upon her now—the hand on the heart—is it the solemn midnight hour that
               affrights me with forebodings? Would I that an angel's touch arrested
                  <emph>her</emph> way? No! no! Merciful God! let her pass on! her path is not yet
               toilsome. She treads lightly in her morning hours. The dew of heaven is on her brow,
               as she gathers the lilies of the field. Thou hast, as yet, permitted no thorn to
               pierce her tender feet, and for the history of that heart, still throbbing with the
               faith of childhood—Thou wilt write it! Her future is with Thee! Oh! sustain her, in
               the battle of life, from childhood to youth—and onwards!</p>

                     <q>"Then give me also back again the time when I myself was still forming; when
                        a fountain of crowded lays sprung freshly and unbrokenly forth; when mists
                        veiled my world—the bud still promised miracles; when I gathered the
                        thousand flowers which profusely filled all the dales. I had nothing, and
                        yet enough—the intuitive longing after truth, and the pleasure in delusion.
                        Give me back those impulses untamed—the deep pain-fraught happiness, the
                        energy of hatred, the might of love. Give me back my youth."</q>
                  </epigraph>
                  <p>ONE evening, during a stay of some weeks in New York, after a day of
                     sight-seeing, tired and yet willing to see more, I went into the parlor of the
                     St. Nicholas Hotel. I recognized no one there, so I retired to a sofa in the
                     corner, in order to amuse myself by observing the groups of people that were
                     scattered about the room. There was a lady sitting by the window alone; she was
                     leaning back in her<pb n="14-15" xml:id="VAC6361-00000008"/> chair, looking
                     down thoughtfully. I noticed, at a glance, the extreme elegance of her dress,
                     and there was something in the contour and grace of her figure that seemed
                     familiar, carrying me back to other days. This idea fascinated me, and I
                     watched her closely. She sat for a few moments, and then got up as if about to
                     leave the room. As soon as she looked up, I knew her. Eighteen years had not so
                     changed the beautiful school-girl, Laura Edwards, but that she could be
                     identified in Mrs. Searle, of Boston. I hastened to speak to her, for we had
                     been dear friends when young, though, until now, we had never met since our
                     separation at boarding-school. We had, however, kept up a sort of intercourse,
                     by letter and by messages, and I had recently received an invitation from her,
                     to come to Boston, and pay her a visit, that we might renew our friendship. She
                     received me with great affection when I spoke to her, and her countenance,
                     glowing with pleasure, verified her words.</p>
                  <p>"How happy I am to see you again," she said, holding my hand, when we were
                     seated together on the sofa; "in this long time that has passed since we left
                     school, how much has happened. We thought, when we said good-by to our studies,
                     that only pleasure was in store for us. But we, some of us, at least, have
                     found out our mistake. You have been one of the fortunate ones; all your dreams
                     of life have come true."</p>
                  <p>"Not all," I said, smiling; "but many of them."</p>
                  <p>"What a merry set of girls we were," she said, in a tone of voice that showed
                     she liked to look back; "but," and the voice changed, "think of the destinies
                     of some of us. Anna Hayes died young; Margaret Young is dead, and was at one
                     time insane; two of us are widows, Marcia Ellet and I; the others are scattered
                     far and wide."</p>
                  <p>"Does Marcia live in Boston?" I asked.</p>
                  <p>"Yes, and she has two lovely daughters; the care of their education has
                     occupied her time, and satisfied her heart too, for she is so devoted to them,
                     that she has no wish for other society. I am the worst off of all, for my life
                     has been so aimless."</p>
                  <p>"Yet," said I, "you have much that is to be desired. How perfectly you have
                     retained your health, or your beauty could not have been so well preserved;
                     then, you have many friends, and your wealth, <emph>that</emph> can purchase
                     you <emph>some</emph> happiness, for you can spend it to the benefit of
                     others."</p>
                  <p>"Oh! as to that," she answered, "my name heads half the charitable lists in
                     Boston, and yet my happiness has been, at most, a negative one. I have never
                     had enough to love. I was, in one month, a bride and a widow. Wasn't this
                     enough to darken my life?"</p>
                  <pb n="16-17" xml:id="VAC6361-00000009"/>
                  <p>Her eyes filled with tears as she said this, but she did not look very much as
                     if her life had been darkened. She was the sweetest representation of middle
                     age. Her white neck and falling shoulders were still very handsome, and her
                     dress, cut low, displayed a bust that a young woman might envy. The color was
                     continually deepening or fading in her cheek, as she spoke, and the lines in
                     her face had not yet threatened to become wrinkles. Then, there was the old
                     dimple, to which so much of the fascination of her smile was owing. One rarely
                     sees so beautiful an arm and hand as she had, and diamonds flashed in her
                     bracelet and in the clasp of the belt that she wore about her waist. She was
                     lovely, graceful, and interesting; had fine talents, and unless intercourse
                     with the world had spoiled her, she had a true and noble heart. As she spoke of
                     her darkened life, the tears that had gathered in her brilliant eyes fell
                     slowly, but in a moment, all trace of them had been wiped away. They might be
                     considered as the tribute paid by a woman of the world to fond and pure
                     recollections of her early life. Soon she was talking gayly of other things,
                     and the great sorrow was set aside.</p>
                  <p>"How fortunate I am to be in New York at this time," she said, "though the
                     cause of my being here is one that gives me great anxiety. You will be
                     interested in it; for you could not see, without interest, the daughter of
                     Margaret Young, were it only for her mother's sake."</p>
                  <p>"It will be a great pleasure to see her. Is she here now?"</p>
                  <p>"She is out this evening," Mrs. Searle said, "but at present she is under my
                     care; she lives with me, and I look upon her as my own child. She is a lovely
                     girl, far prettier than ever her mother was, but she is very much out of
                     health. I came to New York entirely on her account, to give her the benefit of
                     change of scene."</p>
                  <p>"Her mother has been dead some time," I said—"about two years?"</p>
                  <p>"Just two years; did you ever hear her history?"</p>
                  <p>"I heard something of her marrying Mr. Hamilton unwillingly, and it has been
                     said that she was once engaged to Mr. Murray, who is a friend of my husband.
                     Some think that his never having married is in consequence of his attachment to
                     Margaret."</p>
                  <p>"No doubt of it," said Mrs. Searle, "and it is very pleasant to believe so; I
                     have not outlived my romantic notions, and think that for every man or woman
                     one great passion should suffice."</p>
                  <p>"Did Mrs. Hamilton leave but this one child?" I asked.</p>
                  <p>"She left three," said Mrs. Searle; "two daughters and a son; the youngest
                     daughter died, soon after<pb n="18-19" xml:id="VAC6361-00000010"/> her mother,
                     of scarlet fever. Mr. Hamilton, almost broken hearted by his double affliction,
                     determined to go to Europe, and he has taken his son, intending to have him
                     educated in Germany, or in England.</p>
                  <p>"I was with Mrs. Hamilton when she died. She was resigned to suffer a great
                     deal, and was satisfied to die; she was never a happy woman, and her long
                     illness assisted to wean her from life; besides, she was a very religious
                     person. Her great and only care seemed to be for Irene, the daughter that is
                     with me. I begged her to give Irene to me, from the time that her illness
                     promised to terminate fatally. Mr. Hamilton was quite indifferent about it; he
                     is always polite to Irene, but I never saw him caress her; when he speaks to
                     her there is even a reserve of manner that is unaccountable. Irene worships her
                     father, whom, personally, she resembles exceedingly, and she is everything that
                     is lovely and good; she is a girl of genius, and her mind has been cultivated
                     to a remarkable degree, when you remember how young she is. I have often, when
                     I have been at the Grove (which is the name of Mr. Hamilton's residence on the
                     Hudson), I have often thought I would try and account for Mr. Hamilton's
                     treating Irene so differently from his other children. Little Margaret was his
                     darling, and as for the son, he is in a fair way to be made good for nothings
                     by excessive indulgence."</p>
                  <p>"Mrs. Hamilton, then, left her daughter to your care," I said.</p>
                  <p>"Yes, after some hesitation; she made one objection to me, and that was, my too
                     great fondness for the world. I have always been a worshipper of mammon, in a
                     measure; the truth is, I have no family, and my home, until Irene came, was
                     often gloomy, so I have gone into, gay society more than I would otherwise. I
                     made Mrs. Hamilton a great many promises, told her I would go regularly to
                     church, and always take Irene, for I was so delighted at the idea of having an
                     adopted daughter, that I would have promised anything. So she consented, and
                     assured me that her husband would make no objection to our scheme, on the
                     contrary, he appeared to be more than satisfied. He does not neglect his
                     daughter—is desirous she should have everything to make her happy; and writes
                     to her occasionally, but his letters are short and constrained in their style.
                     He does not limit her as regards spending-money, for she can have as much as
                     she pleases. In a letter that I had from him the other day, he entreats me, in
                     every way, to provide for her happiness, and adds, that if at any time I desire
                     to be relieved of my charge, to inform him, that he may return to the country
                     and make suitable arrangements for her, but, he does not offer to take her with
                     him; and when you see Irene, you will be<pb n="20-21" xml:id="VAC6361-00000011"
                     /> astonished at this. But, though all this is true and strange, he cannot be
                     said to have been regardless of her. He has cultivated her talents by giving
                     her the best masters. She speaks Spanish and French with great ease, and is a
                     most delightful musician; she plays equally well on the piano and the harp;
                     indeed, she has a perfect passion for music, though lately I can hardly induce
                     her to play a note; she sings, too, charmingly."</p>
                  <p>"Her mother, if I recollect right, had no fondness for music. What were the
                     circumstances attending the breaking of her engagement with Mr. Murray?" I
                     asked.</p>
                  <p>"Oh! it was Mr. Young's fault; he was a man of such strong feelings and
                     prejudices, and he hated the Murrays, with whom he had some difficulty at law,
                     and the Murrays gained the suit. It was an unimportant one, but Mr. Young was a
                     proud man, and never forgave an injury; such people are particularly
                     unforgiving when they are in the wrong. He was indignant that any member of the
                     Murray family should dare to aspire to his daughter. When Algernon Murray came
                     to Georgia, he and Margaret met at some house in the neighborhood, and from the
                     first hour of their acquaintance they were interested in each other; after
                     that, they were constantly together. Mr. Young did not choose to notice this
                     for a time; some said he hated the Murrays so, that he let the affair go on
                     purposely, delighted at the idea of being able to retaliate upon the son the
                     injuries done him by the father."</p>
                  <p>"But," said I, "he forgot that his daughter's happiness was at stake."</p>
                  <p>"If he remembered, he did not care," said Mrs. Searle; "his conduct after this
                     showed it. The Murray family called upon Mr. Young and his daughter, and hoped
                     the old troubles were forgotten. When Algernon asked his permission to address
                     Margaret, confessing that he had already made known to her his attachment, and
                     that she returned it, he refused him in the most positive manner, though he did
                     not forbid their friendly intercourse being continued; this, of course, induced
                     the young people to hope, and every day they became more devoted to each other.
                     Again Algernon Murray used every argument to soften Mr. Young, but he might as
                     well have addressed himself to a rock. Margaret, who, though amiable, possessed
                     some of her father's inflexibility of purpose, refused to break her engagement;
                     and at this, Mr. Young was so enraged, that he forbade Algernon the house, and
                     never let Margaret go out of his sight. I believe that if Margaret had been
                     dying at his feet, he would not have yielded, if, by doing so, her life would
                     have been saved. So it went on; Margaret persisted in declaring she would never
                     give Algernon up, and Mr.<pb n="22-23" xml:id="VAC6361-00000012"/> Young was
                     equally determined she should never marry him; all the time Algernon Murray
                     remained at his father's embracing every chance to get a line or a message to
                     Margaret, and writing to the father until he saw <emph>that</emph> was of no
                     use, for his letters were returned to him unopened; then, he thought, for the
                     present, he would be quiet.</p>
                  <p>"You have not forgotten," continued Mrs. Searle, "that I was a ward of old Mr.
                     Murray's and that I lived with him until my marriage; Margaret and I returning
                     from school together; so I knew all that was going on. Algernon Murray had been
                     pious for several years; he began to think on religious subjects at West Point.
                     Bishop McIlvaine, during the short time that he was chaplain there, many years
                     ago, produced a great impression on the minds of the cadets, and his preaching
                     was the means of the conversion of a number, while others never forgot the
                     effective arguments he used to induce them to commence a religious life. Among
                     his converts there, now living, are several bishops of the Episcopal Church. I
                     have often heard Algernon speak on this subject, and he dates his first
                     religious emotions to the preaching of Bishop McIlvaine. After he graduated at
                     the academy, he went to Europe, and returned much improved; he was certainly
                     one of the most interesting persons that I ever met, handsome and engaging in
                     his manners ners, and he had a faculty of attracting any one with whom he
                     conversed; for, besides talking well, he was a good listener, and you felt that
                     he was interested in all that concerned you; so it is not to be wondered at
                     that poor Margaret loved him so much.</p>
                  <p>"I am making you a long story, but it is a true one. One morning, Algernon
                     received a note from Mr. Young, begging an interview with him. He went over in
                     high spirits, for he thought Margaret's unhappiness had softened her father,
                     and that all would be as he wished. When he came home, we saw, by his looks,
                     that it was otherwise, but we did not question him; his mother afterwards told
                     me what had passed. Mr. Young had been rude and insulting; he told him of a
                     note that he had written Margaret, that he had got hold of, and that it was to
                     no purpose that he attempted to renew his addresses, for he had determined on
                     such a course as would break up the whole affair; he sneered at his want of
                     proper spirit in being anxious to enter a family that was unwilling to receive
                     him; he reminded him of his religious profession, and said that there was an
                     estrangement between himself and his daughter, the result of her acquaintance
                     with him; the world, he added, would judge rightly of a religion that actuated
                     him to instigate a child to rebellion against her parent. This allusion to his
                     religious profession<pb n="24-25" xml:id="VAC6361-00000013"/> was particularly
                     distressing to Algernon, for he was constantly afraid of saying or doing
                     something calculated to place the profession that he made in an unfavorable
                     light before the world. Mr. Young charged Margaret's unhappiness upon him, but
                     said <emph>that</emph> was a mere derangement of the nervous system, that he
                     should take her away from home, and when separated, she would soon forget him.
                     He would not consent to an interview between him and Margaret, but called upon
                     him as a man of honor, to withdraw his addresses, as to his shame, he was
                     obliged to acknowledge, Margaret wished the engagement to be continued, and he
                     wound up by declaring that not only should there be no marriage, but that he
                     would never forgive his daughter or treat her with kindness, until the affair
                     was entirely done with. Algernon was very much distressed, and hardly knew what
                     to do at first, but all the members of his family were highly indignant at Mr.
                     Young's behavior, and they persuaded him to write to Margaret, and withdraw
                     from the engagement. He did so, but was unhappy after it; nothing seemed, for a
                     time, to interest him; I was always certain that he regretted taking this step,
                     for if he had waited a year or two, Margaret would have been of age, and, under
                     the circumstances, she and Algernon would have been justified in braving Mr.
                     Young's displeasure; indeed, Mrs. Murray told me that her son always ways
                     blamed himself for acting so hastily, but Margaret's marriage to Mr. Hamilton
                     was hurried on so, that he had no chance of repairing his error, if you can
                     call it one. Mr. Young dragged Margaret off to New York, much against her
                     wishes, and the poor girl was worried into her marriage. I think Margaret was
                     to blame to marry, when her whole heart was given up to another, but she was so
                     angry with Algernon for giving her up, and offended pride had a good deal to do
                     with her accepting Mr. Hamilton. She thought that if she were willing to brave
                     her father's anger, Algernon might have done it too; if he had ever asked her
                     to marry him in spite of her father's objections, I know she would not have
                     hesitated. Afterwards, Mr. Young would sneeringly speak of Algernon's having
                     resigned her so easily, and he would declare this was a proof that he had never
                     really loved her. He made Margaret go everywhere with him in New York; to
                     balls, and operas, and all gay places, and somehow or other he got her to agree
                     to the marriage with Mr. Hamilton. I suppose she thought she would have no
                     peace until she did so, and she was quite worn out. She was disappointed that
                     Algernon made no effort to see her or write to her, and thus, as is often the
                     case, mortified pride and affection united to hurry a woman on to her fate. She
                     was married in New York, and I was her bridesmaid, for I had<pb n="26-27"
                        xml:id="VAC6361-00000014"/> passed that winter in New York, and we had been
                     a great deal together."</p>
                  <p>"What sort of a person was Mr. Hamilton?" I asked, "was he worthy of her?"</p>
                  <p>"Oh, yes; in every respect but one. He is very wealthy, and is a man of the
                     highest intellectual attainments, but he is an infidel. I am told his father
                     was one also. To me, this would have been a great objection; Mr. Young,
                     however, did not care for it, and Margaret did not think of it at all, at the
                     time, but since, it has been a great sorrow to her. The truth is, Margaret had
                     but one idea then—Algernon Murray; wasn't it dreadful she should have married
                     Mr. Hamilton? She was often in low spirits, but when in gay company she would
                     become animated, and was very much admired. She had no great beauty, but she
                     managed, or rather, she <emph>did not manage</emph>, to make every one love
                     her. It was so, you remember, at school."</p>
                  <p>"Margaret had a very superior mind," I said, "and when a woman is gifted with
                     an <emph>extra</emph>ordinary mind, she invariably has a greater influence than
                     a man who is similarly endowed."</p>

                  <p>"HAVE you found it so?" said Mrs. Searle. "It seems to me that it is just the
                     contrary. Women, so often, are not appreciated."</p>
                  <p>"Perhaps you have observed that once or twice, and take it for granted that it
                     is always so, but I think not. Even women of ordinary intellect accomplish a
                     great deal by a certain tact, and frequently, a woman of inferior mind has the
                     greatest, and the worst influence on those around her. I know men that have
                     changed so much since their marriage, for the worse, that I attribute it to
                     their wives, although the latter are women of no ability."</p>
                  <p>"How do you account for this?" said Mrs. Searle.</p>
                  <p>"In a very matter of fact way; from the influence of association, and the power
                     of the affections. However, Margaret seems not to have been influenced by<pb
                        n="28-29" xml:id="VAC6361-00000015"/> Mr. Hamilton in her opinions, for you
                     say she became a religious woman."</p>
                  <p>"Yes; but again, Mr. Hamilton was never influenced by her in this respect;
                     according to your theory, he ought to have been."</p>
                  <p>"Not at all," I said; "she never loved him; had she loved him, as women are
                     supposed to love their husbands, the result might have been very
                     different."</p>
                  <p>"She never loved him," said Mrs. Searle; "though I will do her all justice;
                     after her marriage she tried to make him happy; if she could not feel as he
                     wished, she endeavored to <emph>act</emph> so as to give him pleasure."</p>
                  <p>"Did he know of Margaret's attachment to Mr. Murray?" I asked, "previous to his
                     marriage?"</p>
                  <p>"Oh! yes; Margaret concealed nothing, and she told him she never could love him
                     as he deserved, but Mr. Young persuaded him that Margaret, once his wife, could
                     not fail to overcome any lingering feelings of attachment she might have for
                     Algernon, and that she would be cheerful and happy again. Mr. Hamilton was so
                     much in love with her, that he was willing to take the chance, but it was a
                     fearful one. He has been the most devoted, excellent husband, and his affection
                     has been greatly tried, for after the marriage, things went on badly. The
                     wedding was the gloomiest one I ever saw; I never wept such tears for another
                     as I did for Margaret, that morning; she hardly knew where she was, and was as
                     pale as her pearls, and as motionless. I saw tears in the eyes of more than one
                     who knew her first love affair, and we all wondered that Mr. Hamilton desired
                     the marriage under the circumstances; but people are so apt to think things
                     will be as they wish them."</p>
                  <p>"Yet," said I, "such a marriage is dreadful; Margaret was much to blame to take
                     so lightly upon her those solemn vows. And her father—oh! how much have they to
                     answer for, who constrain the affections when they should be permitted to flow
                     on. Poor Margaret. I am sorry to hear so sad an account of her!"</p>
                  <p>"Oh! she had a miserable fate," said Mrs. Searle; "think of her long
                     imprisonment in an insane asylum; but it was right to place her there, for
                     eventually she recovered, and lived a useful, if not a happy life, for a number
                     of years. You live near Algernon Murray, tell me about him; it is so long since
                     I have seen him. Is he cheerful?"</p>
                  <p>"Yes; but I should not characterize him as a gay person; he is a sort of
                     bookworm, but is a very pious and useful man. He left the army long ago, and
                     lives on his plantation. He could not help being cheerful, for religion, to
                     which he is so devoted, would make him so, had he nothing else. But<pb
                        n="30-31" xml:id="VAC6361-00000016"/> he is thoughtful always; too much so,
                     some think. I never heard him speak of Mrs. Hamilton; persons generally avoid
                     alluding to her—to him. How long ago did Mr. Young die?"</p>
                  <p>"Oh! years; he died when Margaret was in the asylum, and his was a wretched
                     death-bed; it is not surprising that remorse embittered the last hours of his
                     life. A few weeks before his death he begged me to go and see Margaret, and
                     bring him a true account of her condition; I could not, then, encourage him
                     with hopes of her recovery. He wept very much, and I knew that his proud spirit
                     was broken. He and Margaret lie, side by side, at Greenwood."</p>
                  <p>"But he repented, I hope. Did he make no preparation for eternity as he
                     approached it?"</p>
                  <p>"I do not know," said Mrs. Searle; "when his symptoms assumed a fatal
                     appearance, a friend entreated him to permit a clergyman to be sent for. He
                     made no objection, and one soon arrived; but in the mean time he had become
                     insensible, and during the few hours that he survived, showed no signs of
                     consciousness. The prayers for the dying were read at his bedside; may we not
                     hope that God heard them?"</p>
                  <p>"I trust so," I replied, "but God has told us to live aright to gain heaven. A
                     death-bed is not the place to make the soul white from the stains of sin, yet,
                     the shadow of the cross has rested even there. Our sins affect others. Forcing
                     his daughter into a marriage in which her affections were not interested, how
                     could he expect her to be a good and true wife?"</p>
                  <p>"She was," said Mrs. Searle; "in her conduct, Margaret was the perfect wife;
                     and if, in her heart, her early love lingered, in spite of herself, it was not
                     her fault. She was cruelly dealt by; who can blame her?"</p>
                  <p>"We have no right even to judge her," I said; "but now tell me of her
                     daughter?"</p>
                  <p>"I hardly know how to tell you of my great anxiety for her; she has an
                     excellent constitution, and I have no fear of any bodily disease, but her
                     nervous system is already suffering from the unnatural excitement in which she
                     lives, and unless there is soon a change, she will become a victim of her
                     delusion; she is a spiritualist."</p>
                  <p>"A spiritualist!" I repeated; "how can it be! a girl of talent, you say, and of
                     fine education, how can she believe in anything so absurd as this new
                     theory?"</p>
                  <p>"I am afraid," said Mrs. Searle, "that I am to blame in a measure, for it,
                     though I did all for the best; and now I am trying to turn her mind from it,
                     but, it's of no use. Spiritualism is, just now, the fashion in Boston, and we
                     can go nowhere<pb n="32-33" xml:id="VAC6361-00000017"/> where without hearing
                     it discussed. Its adherents are among the learned, the educated, and the
                     religious, though the greatest number are impostors, who would do anything to
                     turn a penny. It is astonishing what a hold this nonsensical doctrine has taken
                     on a mass of the people. When Irene came to me, spiritualism was the frequent
                     subject of conversation in my house as in every house in Boston. I was glad to
                     see Irene take an interest in anything, for she had been so perfectly wretched
                     from the loss of her mother, and had I permitted her, she would have stayed
                     forever in her room, to dwell upon her loss. It distressed me beyond everything
                     to see her so. She had her mother's Bible, and she often read in it, but
                     oftener cried over it. I got some young people to visit her, but she did not
                     take the least interest in their society. I tried to induce her to renew her
                     regular course of study, but she could not. Her music was forgotten, and I
                     really was afraid the poor child would die of grief, for all of her employments
                     were given up and her health began to be affected. All my friends took the
                     greatest interest in her, and one of them, Professor Johnson, loves her as
                     well, I believe, as if she were his own. He can't pass a day without seeing a
                     great deal of her, and he and his wife came here with us. Another gentleman who
                     visits me, but I do not like him, is Mr. Walker, a great spiritualist; he is a
                     man of a great deal of talent of a certain sort, and he has a way of
                     fascinating people, as cats do birds, that he may make them do as he wishes. He
                     failed with me, but he succeeded with Irene. I cannot endure him; he is a
                     mesmerist, and can, at any time, throw Irene into a mesmeric sleep, though I
                     have put a stop to this. Well, he has converted my poor Irene to
                     spiritualism."</p>
                  <p>"How, then, can you blame yourself?"</p>
                  <p>"Oh! because, at first I encouraged Irene to take an interest in it. Having no
                     sympathy with the subject myself, I did not consider what might be the effect
                     on a mind naturally enthusiastic and devotional, and on feelings so sensitive
                     and intense as hers. If Irene cares at all for a thing, she throws her whole
                     soul into it; if she love a person, she does it passionately and without the
                     least reserve. She is either indifferent or devoted. When her sister's death
                     followed her mother's, I was in despair at the effect it had upon her; and as
                     spiritualism was the only thing that roused her from her grief, I took her
                     where it was discussed, and where all these table movings and knockings are
                     going on. I never dreamed that the consequences could be as they are.
                     Sometimes, Irene is quite cheerful, fancying that her mother and sister are
                     about her, and she tells me all sorts of things about interviews with them.
                        She<pb n="34-35" xml:id="VAC6361-00000018"/> gets angry with me because I do
                     not believe any of it. She sleeps in the room adjoining mine, and is very
                     restless; half her nights are spent in the indulgence of these wretched
                     fancies. Mr. Walker calls them trances or ecstasies, or some such nonsense, but
                     Dr. Thomas assures me she is suffering from a diseased state of mind, the
                     result of excessive grief."</p>
                  <p>"How anxious you must be about her," I said; "but, of course, you do not permit
                     her to go to these meetings or circles now?"</p>
                  <p>"I cannot prevent it; she has gone to one to-night, at a private house. Irene
                     is so modest that she shrinks from any sort of publicity, but she is a medium
                        <emph>of the highest order</emph>; Mr. Walker calls her so. When she is in
                     the cataleptic state, as <emph>I</emph> call it, questions are addressed
                     through her to the dead; sometimes remarkable coincidences have occurred in her
                     answers."</p>
                  <p>"How dreadful! but as Irene is under your charge, do you not feel it a duty to
                     restrain her from going to such places?"</p>
                  <p>"How can I? Irene is eighteen years old, and she is not always in the condition
                     I have been describing. Generally, she is the most interesting girl you ever
                     saw, so affectionate in her ways. But, if I hint at preventing her from seeing
                     her spiritualist friends, or say anything against her faith, she becomes comes
                     so excited that I am glad to see her calm again by promising she shall do as
                     she pleases. She says that if I write to her father about it, she will go where
                     we can never again see or hear from her. We have to be very gentle with her,
                     for she will not bear contradiction. Dr. Thomas advised me to come here with
                     her, and in a little while he will come over, for a day, to see us. Professor
                     Johnson and his wife are spiritualists, after a fashion, and Irene is with them
                     this evening."</p>
                  <p>"What a pity that she should be under their influence, then."</p>
                  <p>"Oh! as to that, Mrs. Johnson cannot do her any harm, for she is the silliest
                     woman that ever lived, though she is one of the strong minded, believes in
                     woman's rights, and would be a Bloomer if the Professor had not threatened a
                     divorce as soon as she assumes the dress. She never could influence Irene, and
                     the Professor is only inquiring into spiritualism as he does into everything;
                     he will soon drop it."</p>
                  <p>"Yet he has taken her out to-night, to a circle."</p>
                  <p>"She would go," said Mrs. Searle; "some one from Boston, Mr. Walker, no doubt,
                     wrote to Dr. James, of this city, who is a spiritualist, about Irene, and the
                     Doctor comes here to invite her to meet a few friends at his house, where the
                     subject will be talked about. Irene said positively, she would go, and the<pb
                        n="36-37" xml:id="VAC6361-00000019"/> Professor tried, at my request, to
                     dissuade her, but to no purpose. However, the Professor thinks it a service to
                     Irene to go, rather than an injury, by employing her thoughts. But he is
                     mistaken."</p>
                  <p>"One question more," I said: "How does all this affect Irene in one
                     respect—does she read her Bible as much as formerly?"</p>
                  <p>"No; I used to take the Bible from her hands, for I wanted her to read
                     something more cheerful, but I never have to do so now. Books about spirits
                     have taken the place of her mother's Bible; <emph>that</emph> is rarely opened.
                     There comes the Professor—I know his step."</p>

                  </epigraph>
                  <p>THE Professor stood for a moment, at the door, looking for Mrs. Searle; as soon
                     as he saw her, he came quickly towards her. "I see you have waited for us," he
                     said. "Have you been impatient? is it very late?"</p>
                  <p>"No," said Mrs. Searle. "Let me introduce you to an old friend of mine." The
                     Professor bowed. "Talking with her has made the time fly. My poor Irene! why
                     did you let her stay so late?"</p>
                  <p>"How could I prevent it?" said the Professor. "When I insisted upon her coming
                     home, if you could have seen her look, and heard her say 'Ah! Professor.' I am
                     so constituted that I can refuse nothing to a beautiful woman."</p>
                  <p>"Then you should have done what <emph>I</emph> asked you, and brought Irene to
                     me at ten o'clock. How is<pb n="38-39" xml:id="VAC6361-00000020"/> she? has she
                     been in the spiritual world to-night, and have you been in the seventh heavens,
                     eating those curious pears that Mr. Walker says grow up there?"</p>
                  <p>"Not yet," said the Professor, "and Irene has done very well. I persuaded her
                     not to act as medium, though every one was anxious that she should. You said it
                     made her ill the last time she did so. You will not be convinced that
                     spiritualism is to Irene a new subject of thought."</p>
                  <p>"You are mistaken," said Mrs. Searle. "It is the old one differently
                     contemplated; it is still death. How can you say any service has been rendered
                     her, when you heard Dr. Thomas tell me that he trembled for her mind if there
                     were not a change in her very soon."</p>
                  <p>"Look how she was before she thought about spiritualism," said the Professor.
                     "It was horrible to see a young person in such a state of hopeless grief, and
                     it lasted a year. I thought then she would certainly lose her mind. So do not
                     charge spiritualism with being the occasion of your anxiety."</p>
                  <p>"I think," said I to Mrs. Searle, "that it was a pity you took the Bible
                     away."</p>
                  <p>"I do not object to the Bible," said Mrs. Searle, "though I do not read it as
                     much as I ought, but I thought it would be better for Irene to go into society
                     ciety. She looked so frail, and how could it be otherwise, moping forever in
                     her room, mourning over what could not be changed. I took refuge in the world
                     from my own sorrows, that were as hard to bear as hers. Here they come! What
                     detained them so long in the hall?"</p>
                  <p>"Some ladies," said the Professor, "to whom Mrs. Johnson was giving a sketch of
                     the evening's entertainment. Madam," he continued, looking at me, "there is the
                     object of Mrs. Searle's anxiety. Does she look very ill?"</p>
                  <p>The two ladies came forward, Irene rather slowly, so that I was introduced to
                     Mrs. Johnson before Irene was near enough for Mrs. Searle to speak to her; and
                     as she stood a moment, seeing her friends occupied with a stranger, I had an
                     opportunity of observing her. Are there not, with every one, recollections of
                     persons that leave upon our memories the impression that is made by the
                     appearance of a figure looking upon us in a dream? Such is my remembrance of
                     Irene, and the illusion appears stronger from the style of dress that she had
                     assumed. It was entirely white, and of a thin material like gauze. I afterwards
                     found that when not thus attired, she wore the deepest black. It was the only
                     peculiarity she had, if anything she said or did could be considered peculiar,
                     for everything was charming,<pb n="40-41" xml:id="VAC6361-00000021"/>
                     everything was natural with her. Her first appearance called to my mind the
                     lines, <q>
                        <lg type="quotation">
                           <l>"Ere thou wast born into this breathing world</l>
                           <l>God wrote some characters upon thy heart."</l>
                        </lg>
                     </q> The impression stayed by me; even spiritualism, when she talked of it,
                     seemed pure and good, though I knew it was not true. Now, when I think of her,
                     it is as at the first, until the remembrance of what followed places her before
                     me in a different attitude.</p>
                  <p>Mrs. Searle said a few words to her before introducing me; I heard her mention
                     her mother's name, and supposed she told her that, in early life, I was her
                     friend. For this, I received from the lovely girl a glance full of earnestness
                     and affection, while I observed the feeling that an allusion to her mother
                     called up. The color, gradually collecting like evening clouds, passed over her
                     face, and then settled in a deep, rich bloom on either cheek. She sat down by
                     me, and said gently and in the sweetest tone of voice, as she put her little
                     hand in mine, "you were my mother's friend; mine you must be too."</p>
                  <p>The suddenness of the appeal, and the beauty of the vision before me, for, had
                     I not touched her hand I might have believed her to be a vision, overcame me.
                     Then, the thought came, an apprehension for the young creature who asked me to
                     be her friend, who was, apparently, so rich in earthly blessings ings. How
                     distinctly I remember her! Those dark gray eyes, with their long sweep of
                     lashes, the harmony of each feature with the other, the exquisite complexion,
                     the long black tresses (heavy and rich as those of the maidens of the far off
                     isles), all gathered up as they were into a band on the back of her head. I
                     looked at her as I would at a picture, and I soon lost this first feeling of
                     oppression, she was so beautiful. I looked down at the hand that still lay in
                     mine; its beauty a sculptor might wish to ravish. No ring disfigured the
                     perfect fingers, no bracelet disturbed the line of beauty that shaped her arm.
                     She wore no ornament; but in the folds of her dark hair drooped the cups of a
                     lily of the valley, and there in its purity and innocent beauty, it looked at
                     home.</p>
                  <p>"Well," said the Professor, who had been observing me, "what do you think of
                     Irene? does she look as if she had been in bad company?"</p>
                  <p>"I am quite satisfied with her looks," I said, "but while I am here, I do not
                     intend to spare her, even to you. I must have her all to myself."</p>
                  <p>At that moment my husband came in; he had been engaged all day with business,
                     and was very tired. I only detained him long enough to introduce him to Mrs.
                     Searle and her friends, with whom, before I left them for the night, I had
                     arranged to visit many places of interest the next day.</p>

                  </epigraph>
                  <p>I CAME to like the Professor; so much, that it is a real pleasure to sit here
                     and think of him. He was a spiritualist, but he has abjured his wild dreams. He
                     is a graduate of Harvard, and has always lived in Boston, that is, his home is
                     there, but he often visits other places, and everywhere he makes friends. He
                     was educated to be a lawyer, but his mother left him one hundred thousand
                     dollars, and he abandoned the law. Thus, with ample means, and abundant
                     leisure, without seeming to accomplish much, he is never idle. Everything that
                     is going on, interests him, more or less. He looks into all the ologies, and
                     finds out the secret springs of every ism that comes along, and he is well
                     armed with his good sense, good education, good principles, and good temper. He
                     thinks nothing beneath his notice until he has inquired into it, and found out
                     its worthlessness ness; then, he throws it aside forever. Such men are
                     extremely useful in society, for though they never accomplish anything great,
                     they are serviceable in little things, of which, after all, life is principally
                     made up.</p>
                  <p>The Professor has many qualifications, which, in our day, may be deemed
                     necessary for one to possess, in some degree, to be agreeable. He loves poetry,
                     and his acquaintance with it is neither superficial nor limited. He is in
                     constant intercourse with Shakspeare, Milton, Chaucer, and others who wrote in
                     the age when the spirit of poesy sprung forth in youth and vigor. He is endowed
                     with so admirable a memory that he can recite a great part of what they have
                     written. He likes to repeat the rhymes of the city poet Pope, who attained such
                     perfection in the use of language as to afford a harvest of pleasure in a
                     barren age. But he loves most to linger with those who sung instigated by the
                     magnetic impulse given to poetry in the nineteenth century. He sits in the
                     shadow of his own trees, and goes with Wordsworth on his Excursion, follows the
                     stream of song as it gushes from the heart of Goethe, and repeats the exquisite
                     songs of Tennyson and of Keats with a pathos that proves they find a response
                     in his own soul. He is full of poetry; yet he never wrote a line; acting wisely
                     in using his gift to appreciate others, and never thinking to enter the arena
                        with<pb n="44-45" xml:id="VAC6361-00000023"/> those whose works satisfy his
                     heart. For does not poetry deal with the heart, and can that be called poetry,
                     that, however it charms the ear by its perfect measure, and its management of
                     incident and of thought, ceases there—arousing no sensibility, waking up no
                     power in the soul that, though sleeping, is still alive.</p>
                  <p>As for the poets of his own country, and his own age, the Professor knows most
                     of them and loves them all. Some of them were his school friends; together they
                     rambled in the woods, fished in the streams, and explored the mountains of New
                     England. Together they studied the languages, and history, and overcame the
                     difficulty of angle and triangle; and they talked, as youths will talk, of the
                     never failing themes, suggestive of argument, drawn from classic lore, until
                     they parted. The Professor delights in the emanations of his gifted friends, as
                     they brighten our own land and go forth to the world—beaming, beside the rays
                     of other living children of poetry. Their fame to him is dear; he knows so
                     well, to their very depths, the hearts from which their verses spring.</p>
                  <p>The Professor loves history; he is curious as to his race, to know from whence
                     it has come, how it has journeyed on, and what is its final destination. He
                     wonders if it indeed be true that man was created by the word of power, coming
                     from nothing, and what is the eternity into which he must pass. And so, I
                     cannot call the Professor a Christian; he says he believes in the truths of
                     revealed religion, but he reads and lays the book aside. He admires in it, the
                     incident, the language, the morality, the poetry; but of the revivifying
                     influence that it will work on the soul, he knows not.</p>
                  <p>It was the working of his poetic nature that guided him to the hall where
                     spiritualism was discussed, when he was still grieving over the loss of two
                     little girls, his only children. The frantic grief of his wife had long ago
                     been quieted, or lost, in the gayeties of fashion; her children were not
                     forgotten, but her sorrow was laid aside. Not so with the father. He ever
                     missed from his bosom the little heads, that, as he studied, were so often
                     pillowed there; he missed their songs, their talk, their enjoyment of life. He
                     could not be submissive to part to them, and long after the marble monument
                     rose over their bodies, he loved to cheat himself by the fancy that they were
                     still about him, that they would come back to him, to be folded to his heart.
                     He found his philosophy inadequate to afford him Consolation. Rebellious under
                     the dispensation, he was like one standing in the dark, seizing the first
                     object that was near, to obtain guidance and assistance. A careless glance at
                     spiritualism invited him to a deeper consideration of it; he loved to think
                        of<pb n="46-47" xml:id="VAC6361-00000024"/> his little ones as guiding his
                     path, or like angels hovering about his bed; there was nothing, that he could
                     see, to prevent this from being true, and in the hope that it might be so, he
                     chose to investigate it. Every age has its mystery, and nothing new, he argued,
                     since the discovery and application of electricity, should be rejected as
                     impossible; and a man should not reject what he cannot disprove. So the
                     Professor went to all the "circles," and was often seen in the company of
                     spiritualists. Many heard with surprise and disgust that such a man was
                     falling, another victim to the new delusion, while the Professor quietly went
                     on with his inquiry, and though not a spiritualist, knew he was classed among
                     them.</p>

                  <p>THE Professor's wife is a spiritualist, and openly avows, or rather loudly
                     proclaims it. She asserts her opinions, and her rights, so as all the world may
                     hear. She would have women doctors, preachers, and (would you believe it?)
                     lawyers; and at one time, nothing but her husband's prohibition prevented her
                     from assuming the Bloomer costume. From a love of peace, the Professor rarely
                     interferes with his wife's notions, but when he does interfere, it is with a
                     determination of a similar nature with that that induced Snowdon's knight to
                     plant himself against the rock, and intimate its removal before his own.</p>
                  <p>Mrs. Johnson is a learned lady, educated, after the straitest sect, a
                     Bostonian. Persuaded that there is nothing good out of Boston, she rarely
                        leaves<pb n="48-49" xml:id="VAC6361-00000025"/> that city for recreation or
                     improvement in other places. She is a sort of Jesuit about education; no one
                     can be saved (from utter ignorance) that has not been educated in Boston; while
                     everything that is taught there, must be good and true.</p>
                  <p>Mrs. Johnson believes in everything new; forever tiring of the last thing,
                     whether an opinion or a dress. Every month she has a new bonnet, and commences
                     attending a course of lectures on a new theme, and as her health requires a
                     constant change of nice dishes on the table, throughout the year, her mind must
                     be stimulated by an incessant variety. Mention a study with which she had not
                     become acquainted, more <emph>or less</emph>, at school! and she can, at all
                     times, talk down an opponent, on any question of science or of art. Her mind is
                     a sort of ladle that is always dipping into everything, but it never brings up
                     a teaspoonful; there is, so to speak, a continual waste. She never gains a new
                     idea; I have known other such women, and not a few, but Mrs. Johnson is
                     particularly indefatigable in running after nothing.</p>
                  <p>Once botany was her passion; this lasted until a very beautiful conservatory
                     was built, and stored with rare and exquisite plants. These, fading and
                     neglected, soon yellowed and drooped within, and if a visitor looked through
                     the windows, the idea of a pestilence among the flowers was inevitably
                     suggested gested, until the Professor, from mere pity and goodness of heart,
                     took them under his charge, providing them with a physician and nurse in the
                     person of a gardener, and when health and freshness were restored, continued
                     him in charge, to prevent a recurrence of the old symptoms.</p>
                  <p>Conchology succeeded botany; the consequence of a present of some handsome
                     shells from a good-hearted navy cousin, who collected them in memory of the
                     good dinners he had eaten at the house of his literary relative. The lady
                     perambulated Boston in search of more shells, pored over their history in
                     books, had shelves put up, with glass fronts, in different parts of the house,
                     and arranged and classed them, she thought, with scientific skill. But,
                     happening to see the performance of some educated canaries, she passed from
                     shells to birds, with the velocity of an eagle flying from the sea-shore to his
                     nest in the clouds. She purchased birds, at any price, and imprisoned them in
                     costly cages; some died and were replaced by others that languished in their
                     gilded homes; but their mistress persevered until the flowers, among which the
                     cages hung, were alive with music, and the little songsters' happy notes made
                     the listener think their wire houses were as pleasant as their native groves.
                     But the old nervous headaches came back, and the lady hated the sun that the
                     birds loved; the poor little prisoners<pb n="50-51" xml:id="VAC6361-00000026"/>
                     languished, and their sweet notes failed. The inhuman cat that had once been
                     her mistress' favorite, and had been banished from her boudoir during the reign
                     of the birds, knew her mistress' fickle nature, and she waited for her mood to
                     change, watching for her chance; so this whim had a bloody end; there were a
                     succession of catastrophes, and the cages, no longer of any use, were sent to
                     auction.</p>
                  <p>Phrenology had a short but splendid reign, during the lives of the little
                     children, whose heads were forever being examined, and whose feet were always
                     running from the skulls that grinned at them from hall and chamber. Then came
                     mineralogy, and then—but time fails me to tell them all. In the mean time, the
                        <foreign xml:lang="FRA">soirées</foreign> of the learned lady were always
                     crowded. Some went for the refreshments; some, from curiosity; some, because
                     they liked the Professor, and some, to laugh at his wife, who, flounced and
                     perfumed, with heightened color, and literary curls, passed among her guests,
                     showing them this picture and that book, a specimen of coal or an
                     autograph—whatever came before her, or was uppermost in her jumbled, crowded
                     brain.</p>
                  <p>Last of all came spiritualism; with what delight she received the new doctrine.
                     She thought the mysteries of death were unveiled for her especial
                     gratification; at any rate, she did not mind intruding on its sanctity; nothing
                     shocked, nothing appalled her. She gave credence to every vagary, hearing and
                     repeating ghost stories, detailing death-bed scenes, and the spiritual miracles
                     that were performed there.</p>
                  <p>She has now attained fanaticism, having dismissed the little degree of truth,
                     reason, or common sense that ever influenced her. Destitute of such elements of
                     mind as would perceive a holiness and solemnity in what concerns the condition
                     of the loved and lost, she is actuated by a vulgar curiosity, in her
                     consideration of it. Thus she invades the sanctuary of eternal things, and
                     profanes their holy altars with an earthly touch. She cannot be sincere;
                     fanaticism, though often deceived, is never sincere.</p>

                  <p>BUT Irene, young, pure in heart, beautiful and intellectual, believes it all.
                     She is too diffident to be at all conscious of her own attainments; to one kind

                     like a star wandering in the unsurveyed heavens; she has wandered into
                     darkness. Bewildered—is she lost? May we not bring her back? She lives—is there

                  <p>MRS. Searle pressed upon my acceptance a seat in the carriage she had taken
                     during her stay in New York, and Irene always went with us in our drives, in
                     and about the city; the Professor generally accompanied us, and his society was
                     far more desirable than that of his wife, who, fortunately for us, whenever
                     Mrs. Searle invited her to join our party, had an engagement either with a
                     mortal or a spirit. I was amazed, on one occasion, when Mrs. Searle told her we
                     were going to a picture shop, to look at a fine collection of engravings that
                     had just been received, to hear her say that Daniel Webster and Henry Clay were
                     to meet her, by appointment, at the house of an acquaintance.</p>
                  <p>"How can that be?" said Mrs. Searle, "for in the morning's papers I read that a
                     great convocation of spirits was to be held in Cincinnati to-day, and these<pb
                        n="54-55" xml:id="VAC6361-00000028"/> two patriots were to deliver
                     addresses, and among the hearers would be Rousseau, Voltaire, and Tom Paine.
                     Are your spirits omnipresent, or do those that have the hiring of them out
                     manage badly?"</p>
                  <p>"You have so little faith," said Mrs. Johnson, "or rather you have none in
                     spiritualism, it is not worth while to throw away argument on you."</p>
                  <p>"But I desire to be enlightened."</p>
                  <p>"Go to the 'circles,' then," Mrs. Johnson said; "you can see and hear enough
                     there to convince you."</p>
                  <p>"Mrs. Johnson, I am very hard to be convinced when spiritualism is the subject;
                     I went to a circle the other evening, where I was infinitely disgusted. I heard
                     a person tell a marvellous story of himself; he says that he was sitting on a
                     piano, a most singular seat to select, it appears to me, and, all at once, he
                     and the piano were caught up, and lodged in the air, near the ceiling, where
                     for some time they stayed. This person is so fat, that while he was telling of
                     this remarkable spiritual manifestation, a vision of him passed before me as he
                     was hoisted up, his short arms holding on to his expansive waist, and his fat
                     legs dangling at the mercy of some mischievous spirit. I laughed a little, and
                     the Professor smiled too. After the piano story was done with, an uneducated
                     man got up, and told us a story of a man and a horse; how the ghost of the man
                     or the horse, I could not tell which, haunted him, slapping against the wall of
                     the room. As the man told the story, he got up, when the part came, about the
                     ghost's fighting propensities; he struck the wall so hard that a large piece of
                     plaster came off. While all this was going on, I observed a person who was, as
                     I thought, intoxicated, and as I saw other persons looking towards him as if he
                     were in an odd condition, I concluded that they intended to put him out of the
                     room; but the man dodged about a little, and put on some airs that savored very
                     much of nonsense, if not of brandy, and then stood up and gave us a half hour's
                     worth of rigmarole, which, I was told by one of the audience, was a sermon by
                     John Wesley. Only think of John Wesley's being so slandered; his spirit was not
                     free to come and go that night, for if it were, I am sure it would have
                     appeared in that house and denied the allegation. But, as it was, the people
                     applauded the impostor, for he was nothing more or less; and he got out of his
                     trance, and went into an immoderate state of conceit without any difficulty.
                     Then the drawings of spiritual apples and pears were handed round, all done by
                     somebody in a state of ecstasy; for it seems these spirits eat and drink and
                     enjoy themselves, something after our fashion. Oh! it is a precious farce,
                     though Irene will believe in it, in spite of me. But we must bid you good
                     morning, Mrs. Johnson! present me to Webster<pb n="56-57"
                        xml:id="VAC6361-00000029"/> ster and Clay and the French gentlemen; and tell
                     them this incessant gadding of theirs is very undignified, and they ought to
                     have something better to do than to encourage women in their gossiping
                     propensities; if they ask for your husband, tell them he is in better company
                     than you are."</p>
                  <p>The Professor laughed as he bade his wife good morning, and then followed us to
                     his carriage.</p>
                  <p>I observed that Irene took little interest in spiritualism when it was
                     discussed lightly. She did not care to attend the circles, and it was evident
                     the ordinary talk about spirits hardly elicited her notice. But when the
                     Professor spoke eloquently on the connection between our earthly and spiritual
                     nature, she would listen with rapt attention. His beautiful sentiments and
                     choice language found a response in her, while his affectionate remembrance of
                     his children, his deprecation of the idea of being separated from them, his
                     eagerness to seize the hope that they might be about him, loving him still; all
                     this roused to excitement the strong affections that had been silenced, but not
                     destroyed, in the bosom of this desolate girl. For with all her wealth, beauty,
                     and friends—was she not desolate, when forsaken by her father, divided by the
                     seas from him and her only brother, and by death from a mother and sister whom
                     she still passionately loved.</p>

                  <p>MY stay in New York was prolonged beyond my expectations, and had it not been
                     for the interest that I took in Irene, beyond my wishes. I saw every reason for
                     Mrs. Searle's anxieties, and felt most anxious that her charge should be under
                     medical treatment. For, though she was only diseased mentally, in her person
                     she was beginning to show the wear of a continual and ever increasing
                     excitement. Sometimes she would be silent, weak, and deadly pale; often, the
                     color in her cheek became a stain, it was so deep; added to this, the unnatural
                     brightness of her eyes, gave her an alarming appearance. Those eyes, at times
                     so dark and lustrous, were often heavy, and swollen from weeping, while beneath
                     them lay deep shadows, such as are occasioned by long illness.</p>

                  <p>One day, we were going to Greenwood, to visit, at Irene's urgent request, Mrs.
                     Hamilton's grave. It was one of those bright spring days that are common in New
                     York, when the ground is cold and damp, while overhead the sun is shining
                     between the light and flying clouds. It was in May, and the foliage was
                     bursting forth in new beauty. We endeavored to dissuade Irene from going to the
                     cemetery, but she was bent on it, and was very much irritated when we proposed
                     to pass the morning in another way. She had looked ill and flushed since waking
                     at an early hour, and had eaten no breakfast. Without seeming to observe her, I
                     did so closely, and, to my great sorrow, saw that she was more unwell than she
                     had been at any time during my acquaintance with her. She walked about the
                     room, frequently throwing herself on the sofa, and putting her hand to her
                     head. She would not answer when we asked her if she were suffering, but we knew
                     she was in pain. Placing my hand on her forehead, I found it very warm, so I
                     asked her not to go out that day, but to allow Mrs. Searle to call in a
                     physician. She refused in the most positive manner, and with the most rapid
                     movements made her preparations to go out. Mrs. Searle soothed her by promising
                     not to call in medical aid, and we hurried to be ready to go with her. The
                     Professor was waiting for us at the door, and I saw him start as he looked at
                     Irene. Without making any observation on her appearance, he followed her to the
                     carriage, and took his seat by her; she threw herself back, and with closed
                     eyes, remained silent during our ride through the noisy streets of the city.
                     When we came to a part where conversation was possible, she abruptly asked the
                     Professor some question connected with her favorite subject; he answered her
                     carelessly, wishing to turn her thoughts to something else. This was
                     impossible; there was but one theme that engaged her thoughts; all the
                     treasures of her richly stored mind were sealed; reason no longer controlled
                     imagination. I looked at her, and a pang smote across my heart as if I had seen
                     her falling from some dizzy height.</p>
                  <p>Mrs. Searle, pale and abstracted, turned from her; she was convinced; there was
                     no mistaking the fatal illumination of the eye and cheek.</p>
                  <p>The Professor spoke gently to her; he loved her, and he could no longer conceal
                     from himself the danger she was in.</p>
                  <p>Most beautiful she looked; her bonnet strings she had untied, and the bonnet,
                     slipping back, displayed her fine hair, so tastefully arranged. The small blue
                     veins could be traced in the dazzling white of her temples.</p>
                  <p>"Why won't you talk to me?" she said to the Professor.</p>
                  <pb n="60-61" xml:id="VAC6361-00000031"/>
                  <p>"I will, but not of spiritualism—"</p>
                  <p>"And why?" she interrupted him, looking with great earnestness in his face.</p>
                  <p>"Because it is not good for you," he said; "you are not well, and this subject
                     excites you. Why are you so unwilling to do what your best friends wish? We
                     love you, and would do anything for you. Until lately, you were so good and
                     obedient; now you are wilful. Wait until you get well, and then we will talk
                     all this over again. We are both mistaken, I fear, Irene, in hoping to have
                     intercourse with our dear ones who have been withdrawn from us. Let us assist
                     each other to be patient; you are as dear to me as my children were; you are,
                     to me, in their place; let me be, to you, a dear friend, and soon, some other
                     love will come to chase away the untimely gloom that has settled in your young
                     heart; forget the past, or let it serve to prepare you for the stern duties of
                     life; you are not always to be sad. I will tell you two lines that must have
                     been written for you— <q>
                        <lg type="quotation">
                           <l>Who sows in tears, his spring time years</l>
                           <l>Shall bind the golden sheaves."</l>
                        </lg>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>"Talk to me," she said, "of death, and of the soul; there are no golden sheaves
                     for me, there are only tears. Answer me, why do I take so much delight in
                     spiritualism?"</p>
                  <p>"It is not to be questioned," said the Professor, "that the very mystery
                     attached to our future and spiritual life, is a great charm. The ignorant and
                     vulgar content themselves, in their superstitious yearnings, with absurd
                     stories of ghosts and graveyards; they hear, or fancy they hear, strange
                     noises, long-drawn sighs, and unearthly groans. The cultivated mind, when of a
                     peculiar temperament, requires more; it has higher impulses with the same
                     tendency; it turns to the poetic and contemplative. Death, eternity,
                     immortality, are the subjects of its musings, but it is continually straitened.
                     It knows there is a future. <q>
                        <lg type="quotation">
                           <l>My own dim life can teach me this,</l>

                     the heavy mists of earth that have gathered there, I shall spring upwards?
                     There is only silence; we may not know. Irene! let us forget it; there is only
                     disappointment."</p>
                  <p>"What then, must we do?" said Irene mournfully.</p>
                  <p>"Submit," said the Professor, "and turn to learning, science, the arts, for
                     consolation."</p>
                  <pb n="62-63" xml:id="VAC6361-00000032"/>
                  <p>"<emph>You</emph> may do that," said Irene, "but these things would not satisfy
                     me."</p>
                  <p>"Is there no consolation in religion, Irene?" I said.</p>
                  <p>"It bids me wait," she said petulantly; then turning to the Professor, "Why
                     have you changed? you told me that you believed that while here, we might hold
                     communion with spirits."</p>
                  <p>"I said it <emph>might</emph> be so, Irene!" said the Professor; "you reason,
                     like a woman, from the heart; you desire it, and you say it is so."</p>
                  <p>"It is lamentable," I said, "that woman is not fitted by her education, to
                     reason calmly; to be independent of her affections; in so many cases, her
                     feelings rather than her judgment, guide her. She is educated to be led and not
                     to go alone, when so often she has no one to guide her, but herself. Woman is
                     not truly woman, if she be not able to work out, of herself, some work of God,
                     alone and unaided."</p>
                  <p>"You take from woman, then," said the Professor, smiling, "her most enticing
                     characteristic; leave to man the roughness and sturdiness of the oak; let woman
                     be the vine."</p>
                  <p>"She is too often the vine," I replied; "what if lightning blast the oak?"</p>
                  <p>"The vine dies with it."</p>
                  <p>"That will do for poetry," I said, "but not for life; but, as regards
                     spiritualism, you may be the oak and Irene the vine; she may cling to you as
                     closely as possible, for you will brave the storm and stand forth unhurt. You
                     will never be a spiritualist, Professor! give it up, and Irene will do so
                     too."</p>
                  <p>"The morning air has done you good, Irene!" said Mrs. Searle; "you look so much
                     better than before we came out."</p>
                  <p>It was so; her manner and appearance were much changed, and this was more
                     apparent as we left the heights of Brooklyn, following the road to Greenwood.
                     Her face was almost joyous, and the animation that pervaded her looks and words
                     seemed natural. We rode slowly, for the day was lovely, and the scenes, before
                     our eyes, most inviting. We were leaving the palaces of the living, and were on
                     our way to the city of the dead. For this, there was a greater solemnity in the
                     thought of the sea whose tide was ebbing before us; a deeper verdure on the
                     hills, and a richer tone in the voices of nature to which we were listening.
                     Most musical of all was the voice of the young spiritualist; she spoke
                     rapturously of the state of the departed, when she addressed me; "I remember to
                     have heard my mother say, that as a young person, your aspirations were
                     devotional, and that she had heard this spirit had stood the test of the actual
                     in life; you talk to me of the Bible; do we not learn there that spirits came
                     to visit man on earth?"</p>
                  <pb n="64-65" xml:id="VAC6361-00000033"/>
                  <p>"Yes, certainly," I said, "when sent by God to accomplish a great purpose."</p>
                  <p>"They come to all <emph>with a purpose</emph>," said Irene; "to me they are
                     messengers of consolation; their visits take away all the horror of the grave.
                     I go to visit my mother now; but, can she speak to me through the marble
                     sepulchre? Can she put forth her hand, bursting apart the earthy chain that
                     binds her down, to welcome me? Can she wipe away my tears? But she comes to me
                     in the unseen form <emph>with a purpose</emph>. If my head is aching—it aches
                     so often—she passes her dear hand over my brow, and it pains no more. When my
                     temples burn with fever, and my hands—she stoops and fans them with her pure
                     breath; they are cooled, and cease their throbbing. If the pain is
                     here—here"—pressing her hands tightly over her heart, "she speaks to me with
                     the old voice: 'Irene, beloved child, we are not separated; I am ever with
                     you."'</p>
                  <p>"Irene, my darling!" said Mrs. Searle, "don't talk so, for heaven's sake. You
                     are tired, I know. Let us go home, and come here another time when you are
                     well."</p>
                  <p>"I am well, dear Mrs. Searle; and you know it does me good to come here. Why do
                     you always want to prevent me? Oh! how I wish I were lying here myself. Do not
                     put me by my grandfather; remember <emph>that</emph>, Mrs. Searle! put little
                     Margaret there, for she never knew about it. Oh! <emph>you</emph> do not know
                     about it, either. Lay me at my mother's feet; my father has left for himself
                     the other place by her side."</p>
                  <p>She spoke so vehemently, with a burning flush on her face, and such a nervous
                     trembling of her frame, that we were all alarmed. Mrs. Searle burst into tears,
                     and I could hardly keep back mine; quiet as the Professor was, I saw that he
                     was much distressed.</p>
                  <p>"Dear Irene," said he, "there are times when we cannot bear to look down into
                     the grave. Let us leave this melancholy place; it looks lonely because we all
                     feel sad."</p>
                  <p>"Lonely!" said Irene; "how can you call it so! why, there are sleeping here,
                     tranquilly, fifty thousand! What a silent multitude! would you not like to see
                     them rouse and stand up in their death robes? but they will not wake up. Ah!
                     the far off murmur of the city does not come to them. And yet, how faint is the
                     outline between the living and the dead; I thought they had no wants, but here
                     are shops for them too; this whole street is a market where their supplies can
                     be purchased. Now, we are passing a marble yard; here are monuments and
                     tombstones to be had for money; and as we go along, see the places that furnish
                     trees; evergreens, and the weeping willow, and the melancholy cypress.<pb
                        n="66-67" xml:id="VAC6361-00000034"/> In this pretty cottage we may buy
                     bouquets and present them to the dead, laying them on their graves; and all for
                     money. Oh! I do not like it," she continued, shuddering, "it is all money,
                     money; the grave is desecrated for money. I want no monument over me, and bring
                     no flowers."</p>
                  <p>We were now quite near the gate, to which I called her attention, asking her
                     what she thought of the architecture of the two splendid monuments that were so
                     conspicuous, being close to the entrance.</p>
                  <p>"How thin may be the cloud," she spoke as if she had not heard me, "that hangs
                     between us and heaven. These that are lying here—they are not dead; there is no
                     death; and that cloud, dark as it may seem to us, may be seen through by them.
                     And yet, at times"—she drew closer to the Professor—"it seems awful to have the
                     eyes of the dead watching us; yet I am not frightened. Oh, I love to feel in
                     the silence of the night that my mother and sister are with me."</p>
                  <p>"It is not so," I said. "Irene, you have no warrant for believing this, and it
                     is not right to believe it; you have a better consolation, for you may be
                     assured your friends are with God. You may go to them, but they will not return
                     to you; lean on your Saviour, and not on these fancies that are born of a
                     diseased imagination. Your mother often talked to you of Christ, of all that he
                     did, of all that he suffered for you. <emph>She</emph> believed in him; do not
                     you?"</p>
                  <p>"I suppose so," said Irene, "but my father does not. Sometimes, but not often,
                     they talked of such things, and my father would tell her to believe what she
                     chose, but not to annoy him with such notions, and then she would weep. He
                     could not bear to see her so, and he would speak to her very kindly, and say,
                     Let me go my own way; each one must judge for himself."'</p>
                  <p>"But, Irene!" I said, "you believe the Bible."</p>
                  <p>"Oh, yes; I think I do; my mother did; I used to love to read it, but now I get
                     confused. Mrs. Searle said I read it too much; don't talk about it, my head
                     aches. Let us get out and walk," she continued, opening the carriage door that
                     fastened inside; "my mother's grave is not far from here."</p>
                  <p>She jumped out, and Mrs. Searle followed her, saying, as I had not seen the
                     grounds I had better ride about, and the Professor would go with me.</p>
                  <p>"What do you think of Irene?" said the Professor to me.</p>
                  <p>"I think she is losing her mind; she is now perfectly insane on the subject of
                     spirits."</p>
                  <p>"I am afraid you are right, but what must be done? I have never seen her so
                     agitated as she is this morning."</p>
                  <p>"Mrs. Searle's indulgence is very unfortunate,"<pb n="68-69"
                        xml:id="VAC6361-00000035"/> I replied. "Irene should not be here now, and
                     yet I do not know how one can prevent it."</p>
                  <p>"It is this that alarms me in Irene," said the Professor; "she has become so
                     wilful; she is not so naturally; if it continue, there will be a necessity of
                     some closer restraint; but, good heavens! can it be that the very medicine that
                     is offered her, has proved a poison! Upon what may the soul lean when these
                     afflictions multiply themselves? Madam, I would rather see her dead than
                     insane!"</p>
                  <p>"We may not choose between the trials that God sends to teach us where the soul
                     may find repose. <emph>You</emph> have confounded spiritualism and religion;
                     they are two different things."</p>
                  <p>"We are approaching Mrs. Hamilton's grave," said the Professor; "poor Irene,
                     how statue-like she stands among her dead. Observe how her cheeks are flushed;
                     surely she is growing much worse; we must be more cautious for the future; she
                     is not in a condition to be excited. God forbid her fine mind should become a
                     ruin; nothing would be so sad as that."</p>
                  <p>"Death," I said, "is a thousand times preferable, unless the reason may be
                     restored; it is proved now beyond all doubt, that diseases of the mind are
                     manageable like others in most cases, when the friends are willing to take the
                     proper means for recovery."</p>

                  <p>"THE driver," said the Professor, "has turned, so that we may see these new
                     monuments. How these grounds are filling up; where do all these live, what
                        <emph>are</emph> their occupations? The capacities of the soul must be ever
                     expanding—I would know of these things; may it not be the part of spiritualism
                     to reveal them? It is not unreasonable to suppose there is a way by which our
                     spirits may communicate with those who have thrown off the earthly form."</p>
                  <p>I answered him: "There is nothing in Scripture to encourage us to hope this;
                     God summons the soul to himself, and having judged it as he has forewarned us
                     in the Bible, he condemns it to eternal misery, or advances it to never ending
                     joy."</p>
                  <p>"Where then is his goodness," said the Professor," in creating the strong ties
                     of earth if they are to<pb n="70-71" xml:id="VAC6361-00000036"/> be sundered
                     forever after so short an intercourse? If your religion teaches this, I would
                     not have it."</p>
                  <p>"It does not; it gives us every hope that the ties of earth will be made
                     indissoluble in Heaven; but God is the one medium, there can be no other; at
                     his will, alone, may parted souls commune, while, according to the views of the
                     spiritualist, any one may irreverently summon from the abodes that God has
                     prepared for the soul, that soul to the earth again—a theory most shocking, and
                     opposed to common sense."</p>
                  <p>"I want something," said the Professor, earnestly, "some faith, be it what it
                     may, that will insure to me the meeting my lost darlings again."</p>
                  <p>"The faith of Christ will insure you that. Your children, early called from
                     earth, knew no actual sin, and such as they inherited by nature is washed out
                     in that <q>

                     </q> They are at rest—you cannot disturb them; would you withdraw them from the
                     protection of the Good Shepherd? but, would you see them again when your
                     summons comes? God has revealed the way. Faith in Jesus Christ, such faith as
                     will induce you to use your wealth, your talents, your all, to his service.
                     But, I long to take Irene from these grounds; will you request the driver to go
                     towards where she and Mrs. Searle are standing?"</p>
                  <p>As we came near the Professor sighed and said, "My poor child! must I see her
                     splendid mind crushed?"</p>
                  <p>"She has a fine intellect, a gift from God," I replied. "Religion would have
                     brought it to the foot of the cross; it would have submitted to lay down in its
                     shadow. But spiritualism impels the mind to a noble flight, its votaries say;
                     it soars awhile and then falls to the dust. Dear Irene! her Bible would have
                     been her best friend."</p>
                  <p>"But," said the Professor again, "it is so natural to be curious as to the way
                     in which all those whose bodies are lying here exist. Look at the graves! as
                     Irene says, <emph>they are not dead</emph>."</p>

                  <p>HE got out of the carriage and stood by Irene; she was resting on the lowest
                     step, leading to the iron railing, looking over into her father's lot. Two
                     stately monuments were there, over Mrs. Hamilton and her father, and a small
                     but beautiful one protected the grave of the little girl. A perfect taste was
                     displayed in the arrangement of the flowers and trees; everything was costly,
                     but chaste.</p>
                  <p>I expressed to Irene my admiration of her mother's monument, and I saw that she
                     was so entirely wrapped up in her own reflections that she did not even know
                     that I was speaking to her.</p>
                  <p>I touched her, and spoke again after a minute. "What are you looking at so
                     intently, Irene? If you could see beneath that monument, you could not behold
                     your mother; she is not here. Look above those flitting clouds; the distance
                     may be less than we think between earth and heaven."</p>
                  <p>"Yes, yes," she said thoughtfully; "but you asked me last night to tell you why
                     I became a spiritualist. The history of that heart mouldering there, taught me
                     mysteries that I did not know the human heart could inclose. There are, in the
                     depths of our nature, secrets that man may not in life penetrate, and that the
                     grave will never reveal. That heart so pure, so loving, itself away; it is at
                     rest. My own asks, Why did it suffer? tell me, for you talk of God and of God's
                     mercy, why is it that she suffered so? and why do I stand here, neglected and
                     unloved, by her grave? Did she sin, and have I been so guilty that the full
                     measure of earthly sorrow is heaped upon me, and I so young? Oh! don't talk to
                     me of God or of religion; I can only find solace in spiritualism."</p>
                  <p>I saw it would be more than useless to attempt to reason with Irene then; she
                     was ill, in a burning fever. But oh! she had been standing on the fearful
                     borders of unbelief; the arguments of the infidel spiritualist had loosened, if
                     not uprooted the principles so carefully planted in her heart, by her mother. I
                     proposed returning to the city, and the Professor, taking Irene's hand, asked
                     her to come to the carriage. She consented, sighing deeply, perhaps<pb
                        n="74-75" xml:id="VAC6361-00000038"/> haps, from contending emotions; the
                     memory of the dead, the antagonistic, views of Christianity and spiritualism,
                     and the bodily pain she was enduring, united to cause that sigh.</p>
                  <p>We all regarded her anxiously when we had turned homeward, but she did not
                     speak again during the ride. Nothing could exceed the brilliancy of her color,
                     and her deep, dark eyes flashed in the sunlight as she, strained them, looking
                     towards the sea; but, while we hoped to interest her in the subject we had
                     purposely chosen for conversation, I knew that her thoughts, like those waves,
                     were surging onwards.</p>
                  <p>When we arrived at the St. Nicholas, I proposed that; we should take a little
                     rest before our late dinner, but we found in the parlor two gentlemen,
                     prominent spiritualists, who had called upon Mrs. Searle with no other purpose
                     than to see and converse with Irene; who, as soon as she heard their names,
                     knowing them by reputation; received them with evident pleasure, though she did
                     not say much. They had come to invite her to a circle at a private house; she
                     declined going very positively, though she gave no reason; her modest nature
                     withdrew from the publicity offered, her. The gentlemen persisted in their
                     solicitations; they told her that they had heard from friends in, Boston of her
                     qualities as a medium of the highest order, and they congratulated her on being
                     able to aid in the great work that God willed should be carried on for the
                     comfort of his children. She bowed in answer to their polite speeches, but made
                     no other reply. All this time Mrs. Searle was engaged in conversation with some
                     ladies; I was in hopes she would see proper to interfere in this game that was
                     being played. The spiritualists in Boston were tracking their victim to make
                     the most of her; they had written to persons who were to find her out, and use
                     her for their own purposes.</p>
                  <p>The remarkable powers of this beautiful girl, her intellectual gifts, her
                     tender and sensitive organization, were to be pressed into the service of the
                     greatest folly of the age; at the risk of her languishing her life away in an
                     insane asylum.</p>

                  <p>I LEARNED from Mrs. Searle, that Irene had, for a year, devoted herself to the
                     study of spiritualism; that some acquaintances in Boston had seen that she was
                     supplied with books on the subject, and that among these acquaintances were
                     acknowledged infidels.</p>
                  <p>They had pronounced Irene a medium, from the first; and her consciousness of
                     possessing certain powers had come unsought; and she was opposed to acting as a
                     medium, as it made her ill, besides that she disliked being brought into such
                     public notice. She was sometimes suddenly thrown into a highly nervous
                     condition, in which she wrote messages to the dead; and Mrs. Searle assured me,
                     that if I once saw her so, I would be convinced there was no deceit about her;
                     the first time she had been so influenced was after returning from a circle, to
                     which Mrs. Searle took her, for amusement.</p>
                  <p>I was anxious to find out to what degree Mrs. Searle had encouraged Irene's
                     interest in this subject, so I said, "Tell me what <emph>you</emph> think of
                     spiritualism, as it is recognized in our country, in New England and in New
                     York, principally."</p>
                  <p>"I think it," said she, "an imposition, an outrage, a dreadful veil that God
                     permits Satan to hold before the mind. I know a few sincere spiritualists; they
                     are fools, men and women, though I confess to a very strong expression; I know
                     many who call themselves so, for fashion's sake, who are always running after
                     something new—Mrs. Johnson, for instance; and I know those who wilfully
                     deceive, like Mr. Walker. The victims of table moving and spiritual knocking,
                     are crowding into our insane asylums and into our cemeteries. Oh! I am
                     indignant at the thought of it, when I think of Irene."</p>
                  <p>"But your friend, the Professor, is half a spiritualist; you certainly think
                     highly of him, not only as a friend, but intellectually."</p>
                  <p>"Yes, indeed; but the Professor will never be a spiritualist; he was
                        <emph>almost persuaded</emph> after the death of his little girls, but he
                     has too much sense; he always considered many of their tenets impossible. What
                     attracts him is the poetry of spiritualism; it is a flower that he holds in his
                     hand, placidly contemplating<pb n="78-79" xml:id="VAC6361-00000040"/>
                     templating it as he does the lily in Irene's hair; but he will find it to fade
                     as quickly."</p>
                  <p>"How could you let Irene so completely give herself over to these fanatics?" I
                     said.</p>
                  <p>"We all thought she was going to die of grief, as I once told you; it was a
                     heartbreak to see her; I thought anything that would interest her would do her
                     good. Soon after she began to look into the subject of spiritualism, a most
                     singular coincidence happened.</p>
                  <p>"She had heard, through a friend from New York, that Margaret, her little
                     sister, was sick. She was dreadfully alarmed, but became quiet, in the hope of
                     hearing it was a mistake, and she was sitting near me, absorbed in thought; all
                     at once she started, and told me she had seen her sister, who had called her
                     home. I was dreadfully shocked at hearing her talk so, and tried to reason with
                     her, but she was in an agony of distress, and would not listen to me; she said
                     she <emph>would</emph> go home, without waiting to hear. I sent right away for
                     the doctor, who said she had probably been dreaming; but I told him she had not
                     been asleep. Then, he said, I had better take her home, and finding all well
                     there, she would attribute what had passed to her imagination. Shall I tell you
                     what I felt when, arriving at the Grove, to see Margaret in her coffin? She was
                     dead of scarlet fever, and she had expired on Friday evening, at five o'clock,
                     at the very moment when Irene had fancied she saw and heard her. From that
                     hour, Irene has been a spiritualist; she has seen visions; she has dreamed
                     dreams. I told her this had been a mere coincidence, and that similar
                     occurrences were on record as having happened to others; but she is confirmed
                     in her own views of the incident.</p>
                  <p>"Mr. Hamilton was so wrapped up in his own grief (or from some other cause),
                     that he took very little notice of Irene. I asked him if I should take her back
                     with me. 'Oh, yes! he said, and console her if possible. She is innocent, and
                     yet how she suffers, and you would tell me there is a God of love and
                     mercy.</p>
                  <p>"These were dreadful words, and I hurried to the next room, lest I should hear
                     more. The middle door was open; Irene was there, and she had heard what her
                     father said. I never shall forget her appearance. She went to him, and timidly
                     took his hand; her pale lips quivered as she said to him, 'Can you not forgive?
                     Is there no voice in your soul to plead for me?'</p>
                  <p>"'Forgive!' he said, looking much surprised; what do you mean? Can you know? It
                     is impossible! Go from me, unhappy child! Have I not enough to bear but you
                     would keep before me the memory of <emph>that?</emph> Would you bring back now
                     the waking of a dream, that the heaven that women talk<pb n="80-81"
                        xml:id="VAC6361-00000041"/> about could not realize? Go; if there were a
                     God, I would bid him bless you.'</p>
                  <p>"Irene turned from him, and pale as one of her own spirits, flitted through the
                     apartment; I followed her, inexpressibly astonished at what I heard. I made no
                     remark upon it to Irene, but persuaded her to go back to Boston the next day.
                     We did not see Mr. Hamilton again; but he wrote me a note commending Irene to
                     my care, but said he was not equal to taking leave of us.</p>
                  <p>"Thus, we turned once more from the house of mourning Irene embraced again and
                     again her little brother, weeping most bitterly. She lifted her eyes to her
                     father's chamber; the blinds were closed—all was silent there. Oh, my friend,
                     even to a worldly woman, such as I am, there is something too awful in man
                     closing the door of his heart, barring it up against God!"</p>

                        <p>"It is in vain that you wander scientifically about; no man will learn
                           more than he can."</p>
                        <p>"Then see that you conceive profoundly what is not made for human
                           brains."</p>

                        <p>"Excuse me, it is a great pleasure to transport one's self into the
                           spirit of the times, to see how a wise man has thought before us, and to
                           what a glorious height we have at last carried it."</p>

                  </epigraph>
                  <p>I WENT with the Professor to a scientific coterie. It was one of the most
                     remarkable incidents of my life, too interesting to confide to the charge of
                     memory alone. Penetrated with the sublimest emotions, while under their
                     influence, I recorded the scene of that evening, that at some future period,
                     when oppressed with the actual, I might look back to this as a monument to the
                     spiritual.</p>
                  <pb n="82-83" xml:id="VAC6361-00000042"/>
                  <p>On that occasion, I felt that <q>
                        <lg type="quotation">
                           <l>"The thirst that from the soul doth rise</l>
                           <l>Requires a drink divine."</l>
                        </lg>
                     </q> I quaffed a full, foaming cup of the nectar that Science offers to her
                     followers. Nor shall I here consider the point, whether Science is false as
                     well as fair; I am not competent to judge, for I have only worshipped her afar
                     off. I have beheld her enveloped in misty clouds, and have thought, were that
                     courteous but dull lady, Reason, to ascend to the summit of Chimborazo, and
                     resting on tiptoe, breathe a long breath upon those clouds, they would be
                     dissolved, their priestess vanishing among their parting vapors. But having
                     stood in the enchanted halls of the Academy of Science, I am affrighted at the
                     daring nature of my speculations. Be quiet, aspiring heart! Shall a woman's
                     step be heard where man with firm and echoing tread may pass undaunted? I
                     submit to the decree of nature, and will only look up to those hills, on whose
                     highest peak, in the full blaze of immortal light, the members of the Academy
                     of Science stand.</p>
                  <p>Yet I confess it is difficult for me to subdue the impetuous impulses of my
                     nature towards those dazzling heights; but I intend to confine myself to
                     facts.</p>
                  <p>The disciples of Science held their meetings at a late hour in the evening, and
                     before going, Mrs. Searle suggested that the Professor and I should fortify
                     ourselves for what might be in store for us by some supper. late a piece of
                     bread and butter, and a delicious morsel of the tongue of a buffalo, that,
                     noble animal, that, constantly forced from his strongholds, seeks a refuge in
                     the shades of the Rocky Mountains; but even there he is pursued, and from
                     thence came the mouthful to which I have just referred; And here let me draw a
                     parallel. The lovely features of Science may not be hidden from the gaze of
                     man. She may fly to the fastnesses of the cavern and the lofty hill, throwing
                     over her face a veil that she deems impenetrable. The farther she retreats, the
                     more ardent the pursuit of her lovers. Her voice, raised in deprecation,
                     allures by its sweetness, and though no one of her worshippers has ever yet
                     pressed her to his heart, and borne her off as his own, yet many a trophy has
                     been secured that will testify to her charms.</p>
                  <p>One has severed from their luxuriant clusters golden curls; another has touched
                     her cheek, and borne away the faintest portion of its blush; another with pride
                     displays a glance of her eye that has rested in his own; and another still has
                     boasted that when he knelt before her, she stayed for one moment her airy
                     flight, and bending over him, pressed upon his forehead her ruby lips. All this
                     was recalled<pb n="84-85" xml:id="VAC6361-00000043"/> to my mind by the thought
                     of the indefatigable hunter, and the choice morsel of his victim. And, it may
                     be, that even in his death the buffalo is a type.</p>
                  <p>There are enthusiasts who declare the day is approaching when science may no
                     longer elude the advances of mortals; that from very weariness she will stay
                     before them. Resting on some now inaccessible height, she will recline in
                     helplessness before her pursuers. Closing her dreamy eyes, the glow will pale
                     in her cheek, the lustre fade on her brow, and her graceful limbs will compose
                     themselves in the decency of death. While, awe-struck, those to whom she has
                     been so dear gaze upon her, she will disappear, her life exhaling itself in one
                     sigh. Then, adds the voice of prophecy, will sages and philosophers turn to
                     each confounded, and descending to earth, doubt the existence of the object of
                     their idolatry.</p>
                  <p>The hall honored by the presence of the members of the Academy of Science
                     deserves a passing notice. It was large, and simply furnished; on the floor was
                     a brick-red carpet; on the mantlepiece were two statuettes, representing whom I
                     know not. I observed, in frames, likenesses of two men in wigs; whether they
                     represented the scientific race in general, or whether they were intended to
                     transmit to posterity the fame of some particular scholars, I cannot say.
                     Doubtless they were there for a good purpose.</p>
                  <p>In the centre of the hall was a long mahogany table, on which were strewed
                     papers of a mysterious appearance. Around the table were seated the
                     Initiated.</p>
                  <p>How shall I describe them? So august their deportment; so dignified their
                     attitudes; so imposing their every look.</p>
                  <p>The presiding officer was a bland, spectacled old gentleman, with a majestic
                     appearance, and on his right and on his left were the philosophers whose
                     researches were to gather around them such a splendor of dazzling light as
                     would blind an enraptured world. <emph>Under</emph> the table sat one of the
                     fraternity, for I am convinced that, encased in the form of that little black
                     dog, was the transmigrated soul of Sir Isaac Newton!</p>
                  <p>I suggested this in a whisper to the Professor, who reproved me for trifling in
                     such a presence.</p>
                  <p>The audience that night was vastly select, being composed of four or five
                     ladies and twice as many gentlemen. One of the ladies, a young girl, was quite
                     good looking, while three of the gentlemen were remarkably handsome.</p>
                  <p>All the formalities having been performed, Professor Tonson arose, and
                     unfolding some foolscap, commenced to read. Owing to the obtuseness of<pb
                        n="86-87" xml:id="VAC6361-00000044"/> my intellect, I could not discover the
                     subject of his disquisition; it was, no doubt, some profoundly unintelligible
                     theme intensely mystified. Being assured that it was as far beyond my
                     comprehension as are the soarings of the eagle above the flights of a domestic
                     hen, I permitted my imagination to go gadding. It brought me home thoughts
                     (suggested by the Professor's handsome French eyes) of la belle France, its
                     ancient chateaux and modern fashions; of the terrible Mazarin and the pretty
                     Empress Eugénie; of Louis Quatorze and beautiful, erring, and unfortunate La
                     Vallière; of the two Buonapartes, and of a nice French maid, who used to comb
                     my hair so gently. All these French notions came to me, while the Professor was
                     eloquently discussing the fact that animals and vegetables were the same thing.
                     By this time some of the audience were wrapped in sleep; but the Professor went
                     on, and concluded by observing that cod-liver oil, taken internally and used
                     externally, would forever preserve the human system in health, when, lo! at the
                     announcement, Sir Isaac burst from his retirement under the table, and rushing
                     madly to the door, uttered a philosophic bark, that was echoed by another of
                     the canine race, as it appeared to us; but I am confident it was Galileo in
                     dog's disguise. "We have died, and shall the philosophers of the nineteenth
                     century pretend to have discovered a lease of life?" Such, I am persuaded, was
                     the meaning of their chorus of barks, which (with shame I record it) excited to
                     the highest degree the risible faculties of the audience. But the more
                     ridiculous the scene, the more solemn the demeanor of the members of the
                     Academy of Science. They must have been shocked at the want of self-possession
                     displayed by Sir Isaac, who, when on earth before, was considered a very
                     genteel and good-natured person, and behaved in a most gentlemanly manner to a
                     little dog named Diamond, whose fame has descended with his master's to an
                     admiring posterity.</p>
                  <p>("If I could but hear no more about posterity! Suppose I choose to talk about
                     posterity, who then would make fun for contemporaries? <emph>That</emph> they
                     will have, and ought to have. Let fancy, with all her choruses, reason,
                     understanding, feeling, passion, but mark me well, not without folly, be
                     heard.")</p>
                  <p>Folly!—but, Professor Tonson concluded his address, and the presiding officer
                     looked most kindly towards him; the expression of his countenance said, "You
                     have done nobly; I have not the slightest idea of what you have been talking,
                     nor is it to be expected that you understand your subject; it is the part of
                     science to mystify."</p>
                  <p>Then arose Professor Blank, and with him the expectations of the audience; for
                     he was to explain, many interesting points in the history and prospects<pb
                        n="88-89" xml:id="VAC6361-00000045"/> of the moon. But no sooner had he
                     commenced, than my ne'er-do-well imagination went gossiping. <emph>Was</emph>
                     the moon made out of green cheese? Could tunnels be cut through the mountains
                     for railroad purposes? What strange influence has the moon on lovers, that all
                     their troubles and peccadilloes are charged to her? Was the moon inconstant?
                     was she chaste? Was Mother Goose to be relied on in her statement about the old
                     lady, that, on a broomstick, ascended seven times higher than the moon? Were
                     poets really moonstruck? Did fairies come out of their hiding-places when the
                     moon arose? And, oh! oh! were <emph>my</emph> moonlight days over forever? Such
                     a pang as arrested my meditations when the last thought occurred to me!</p>
                  <p>I looked at my right-hand neighbor; he slept and murmured "Soporifics!" I
                     turned to the Professor; he was wrapped in contemplation; I regarded the
                     speaker, marking his intelligent countenance and expressive smile; listening to
                     his nicely turned sentences, admiring the enthusiasm that animated him.</p>
                  <p>What does he mean? I asked myself, as he figured away on a tremendous
                     blackboard. What <emph>does</emph> he mean? "Curious fool, be still!" a voice
                     from within me uttered. "If philosophy have stolen his affections and borne
                     them off to the solar system, is it for you to ask the reason? Is human love
                     the growth of human will?"</p>
                  <p>Professor Blank bowed, and took his seat; the president of the academy rewarded
                     him with one of his sweetest smiles. His look was not such as rests on the
                     countenance of Jove, when "he shakes his ambrosial curls and gives the nod;"
                     no, it said, "Good boy, good boy! bon bons! bon bons!"</p>
                  <p>Another disciple of science addressed the chair (in whose shadow Sir Isaac,
                     having recovered his composure, was meekly seated).</p>
                  <p>And again, let me announce my extreme regret in the utter impossibility of my
                     finding out the subject of his paper.</p>
                  <p>In the first place, he observed, he had nothing to say. In the second, he had
                     had no time to prepare this nothing for so intelligent an audience; and he
                     added, that all he had to say must be said at this time, as he could not be
                     present at the next meeting of this honorable body. He talked a little of
                     barometers, and of the Pacific Railroad. He skipped about from the tops of
                     glaciers to smiling valleys, with the agility of a chamois. Sometimes, he
                     seemed to forget where he was, and there was reason to fear that he would fall
                     into some of the awful chasms, or over the frightful precipices of which he was
                     talking, but like a thoughtful house cat, he always came down on his feet, and
                     when he closed his address<pb n="90-91" xml:id="VAC6361-00000046"/> dress,
                     though much exhausted, he was as well as could be expected.</p>
                  <p>At this point of the proceedings I felt obliged to ask the Professor to
                     accompany me home, for I was mystified, bewildered, intoxicated with the deep
                     draughts of the drink divine with which I had been regaled. I was in a state
                     resembling ecstasy. The Professor said I talked more like a victim of
                     Champagne, than the sedate matron that I was. When I got to the hotel, Mrs.
                     Searle pronounced me feverish, and I went to bed, but it was near morning
                     before my excited nerves could be composed to sleep.</p>
                  <p>In my dreams, I saw again the members of the Academy of Science. They were on
                     an elevated platform, kneeling at the feet of their goddess Science, who
                     presented her lovely face and form as emerging from the clouds. Sir Isaac, with
                     a sneering aspect, was also there. I longed to ascend the platform and kneel
                     down with the worshippers, but an unseen hand drew me back. I turned and beheld
                     an old-fashioned lady, middle aged, and dressed in a dove-colored garment. She
                     wore a mob cap and spectacles, and she addressed me, soberly, to this
                     effect:—</p>
                  <p>"My name is Reason, and I warn you, for the future, not to attend the meetings
                     of the Academy of Science. Science is a coquette, and has often been lightly
                     spoken of, and those that are kneeling there at her feet are unmitigated
                     humbugs.'"</p>
                  <p>When I awoke it was eight o'clock; I seriously thought of another nap, but I
                     remembered I had an engagement for the morning. "O! Science!" I exclaimed,
                     still clinging to my pillow, "gently place thy rosy-tipped fingers under my
                     poor head, and rouse me to the dull realities of life!" Hardly had I uttered
                     this appeal when the door opened, and the odor of coffee and sausages entered
                     the room. I was invigorated, and hastened to immerse my forehead in a basin of
                     cold water. And, while putting on my morning dress, I smiled more than once at
                     the piquant manner in which Dame Reason, in my dream, sneered at her rival,
                     pronouncing her admirers—unmitigated humbugs.</p>
                  <p>I hurried to the breakfast table, where was Irene waiting for me. Near her was
                     a gentleman eating a great deal of beefsteak, and talking learnedly of
                     spiritualism. He said it was a <emph>science</emph>, to the knowledge of which
                     we would soon attain.</p>
                  <p>Science again! I said to myself, turning towards Irene, who was thoughtfully
                     regarding him. Is spiritualism indeed a science? Oh, would that Reason would
                     come to the aid of the loveliest of its victims.</p>

                  <p>IRENE, persuaded by her spiritualist friends, consented to act as a medium at a
                     select party. Mrs. Searle determined to go with her, finding it useless to
                     attempt any interference. I gladly accepted the invitation that was extended to
                     me, chiefly for the interest that I felt in Irene, but my curiosity was greatly
                     excited too. The "circle" met at the house of a gentleman well known among men
                     of science, and when we arrived we found the rooms quite full. Many of those
                     assembled were willing to carry to the awful future the follies of the present.
                     They talked of the eternal world as we do of a theatre or a ball-room. Their
                     knockings and table moving, and trickery of other kinds—I did not attempt to
                     account for any of it, and gave the performers all credit for their skill. The
                     evening was tiresome, and in hopes Irene would not be called upon, or that she
                     had refused to keep her promise, I walked round the rooms in search of Mrs.
                     Searle. I was sorry that I had come to such a place, until I observed Irene,
                     sitting apart, conversing with a spiritualist, with whom she had been intimate
                     from the time of her coming to Mrs. Searle's house. "Look there," said Mrs.
                     Searle, who had pushed her way through the crowd, to me, "that arch-fiend, Mr.
                     Walker, has been mesmerizing Irene, in spite of all that I told him. Do you see
                     the expression of her countenance, so dull and heavy? But he does not mean her
                     to go to sleep just now. Oh! I wish she had not come here. Better that she
                     should be in the Insane Asylum at once than in the power of such people."</p>
                  <p>I did not wait to congratulate Mrs. Searle on the justice of her conclusion,
                     for I noticed many were gathering around Irene, and a gentleman was placing a
                     table before her.</p>
                  <p>"No! no!" she said; "I cannot write! it makes me ill—I will not!"</p>
                  <p>"Irene!" said the person that Mrs. Searle had called the arch-fiend, and that,
                     I afterwards learned, was an avowed infidel. He spoke in a tone of command, but
                     with a tenderness in his voice. Irene looked towards him for an instant, with
                     eyes filled with tears. Then she laid her arm on the table, and,<pb n="94-95"
                        xml:id="VAC6361-00000048"/> bending her form slightly, looked down, as in
                     deep thought. There was perfect silence in the room; every eye was fixed on
                     her. I thought of the priestess and the oracle, and well might many of the
                     company be compared to heathen worshippers, awaiting a message from their
                     god.</p>
                  <p>The varying flush that lived in Irene's cheek was settling to a crimson stain;
                     every moment it was dyeing deeper and deeper. Great, heavy tears were falling
                     on her white arms; I almost fancied I could hear them. A nervous trembling
                     agitated her frame, and the table shook, slightly at first, but more and more
                     as her excitement increased.</p>
                  <p>How they stared at her! there were the divine, and the physician, the poet and
                     the scholar, mothers, and sons and daughters—all curious to see what she would
                     do next. Gazing, they were, on the saddest of spectacles; a fair human temple,
                     tottering with the storm.</p>
                  <p>Oh! it is cruel to keep her there. Hardly more so were the rites of the Aztec
                     priest, as he tore from his victims the bleeding heart; hardly more fearful
                     were those mysteries. For here, the sacrifice, holy by her helplessness, is
                     more lovely than any slain on the altars of Cholula. This fair girl! what a
                     calamity is hovering about her! Is there no help? Will no one drive away the
                     infidel with his gray hairs? "Surely, gray hairs and irreligion make a
                     monstrous union."</p>
                  <p>She trembles—greater, with every moment that flies, becomes her agitation.
                     Deeper still, the crimson dye of her cheek. Heavier, the great tears that fall
                     upon her bosom. She looks appealingly, poor child! up to the hard face of the
                     mesmerizer. Oh! that he would permit her to sleep. It were a relief to see
                     those wild glances covered by the white eyelids. The folds of her black dress
                     are disturbed by the action of her heart, and by the rise and fall of her
                     heaving bosom. She sighs, oppressed, and murmurs incoherent words. Alas! alas!
                     what is this that is so affecting her!</p>
                  <p>The people press forward, and close about her. They hope to catch her whispered
                     words, and watch intently, the increasing trembling of her arm. Now it is
                     thrown against the table with cruel force.</p>
                  <p>The mesmerizer calls the physician, and motions him to take her hand. He holds
                     it within his, attempts to feel the pulse, and whispers, that you might crush
                     those little fingers, but, without breaking, you could not bend them. What is
                     it? this strange frenzy! How she suffers! She cannot speak. Her lips are
                     paralyzed. Still her arm strikes the table. Could we smile here, it would be at
                     the rudeness of those spirits that so cruelly belabor a lovely woman.</p>
                  <pb n="96-97" xml:id="VAC6361-00000049"/>
                  <p>Now, the mesmerizer is calling on two or three to steady the table; he has put
                     some writing paper on it, and holding Irene's arm, is forcing a pencil between
                     her fingers. The hand dashes from right to left; the pencil, guided by an
                     unseen influence, tears the paper, making illegible characters.</p>
                  <p>Sheet after sheet of paper is thus destroyed. Would that the spirits would
                     become calm! Strange writing it is that is dashed off, and Irene herself could
                     not translate it. Her face is turned away, and her left hand is pressing
                     tightly to her forehead.</p>
                  <p>We know there are no spirits here. But Irene! can she be deceiving us? We stoop
                     forward, looking into her eyes. We hear her panting breath, and touch, most
                     gently, her burning brow. Stay they are reading what she has written; short
                     sentences, <emph>axioms</emph> of the infidel, axioms that never can be axioms.
                     Again, we scrutinize her face. Can she so deceive? We try to bend her rigid
                     fingers—we turn away, with tears, from the agony of her face.</p>
                  <p>The Professor's wife is charmed. She loves the marvellous; Irene's sufferings
                     are nothing; <emph>she</emph> is amused.</p>
                  <p>The Professor has lost nothing of the scene; his brows are knit in deepest
                     thought. Every sympathy of his kind heart is aroused for Irene.</p>
                  <p>I whisper to him, "What do you think of this?"</p>
                  <p>He replies, in a voice full of emotion, "Some blighting disease is consuming
                     our precious one. Let us away with her from this gaping crowd." He pushes to
                     the right and to the left, and makes room for himself to pass to her.</p>
                  <p>I look for Mrs. Searle. She is not far, leaning against the marble mantle
                     weeping. Ay, weep! woman of the world! weep, repentant. Look at your adopted
                     one! You promised her mother, as you hoped for heaven, to guard from sorrow and
                     from <emph>evil</emph> the motherless. How have you fulfilled your trust?
                        <emph>You did not mean to do her harm, for you loved her</emph>. How did you
                     love her? You dragged her into the follies of fashionable society to deaden the
                     sense of her sorrows. You led her to the opera, the theatre, the ball-room, and
                     the halls of the spiritualist. Had one of these a voice that could speak
                     comfort to her heart? Oh! had you taken her to Calvary! upon her bowed head
                     would have fallen <emph>those tears of blood,</emph> and her own would have
                     been dried. Had you told her of Him from whose sepulchre the stone was rolled
                     away, she would have been consoled, and said "<emph>They</emph> are not here;
                     they are risen."</p>
                  <p>Weep on! that with God's gifts so freely showered upon yourself, you have never
                     given in return, all that He asks—the homage of the heart.</p>
                  <p>The color is fading in Irene's cheek; her veins are not so prominent in the
                     snowy temples. The fingers<pb n="98-99" xml:id="VAC6361-00000050"/> are
                     relaxing their rigidity, and the arm only moves in convulsive twitchings. No
                     longer the heaving of the bosom; one, another sigh, and it is quiet. The hand
                     is removed from the face and droops by her side. The trance—the ecstasy—the
                     spiritual dream is over. Call it what you will!</p>
                  <p>The reaction approaches—weakness overpowers.</p>
                  <p>On Irene the Professor's eyes are bent. Sympathy and love are, to him,
                     spiritual vision. He looks into her soul. The strongest pity nerves him. What!
                     is she to be murdered through her own sensibilities? He will not see it
                     done.</p>
                  <p>She is fainting in her weakness. He draws her to his bosom, thus supporting her
                     drooping head. Over his arm hangs the sweeping length of hair, from which the
                     supporting comb has fallen. The lilies are gone too—they are lying at his feet.
                     Oh! to see a woman in the long night of sorrow, without a star to comfort and
                     to guide! To see a wreck of genius and love and affections, stronger than
                     life.</p>
                  <p>She is reviving—a slight tinge is perceptible in her cheek. She is conscious;
                     and looks up to see a hundred eyes fixed curiously upon her. She cannot bear
                     it, but tries to rise that she may go away. Take her home, for the love of God!
                     Soothe her with sweet offices to sleep, that her mind be not gone. Reason will
                     brighten again, flickering like the taper over the face of the dead, ere it
                     goes out to a dreadful darkness.</p>
                  <p>She is disrobed, and has laid down at our bidding. She is docile and childlike,
                     so tired out. I bend over to kiss her now pale face. She thanks me for
                        <emph>loving her</emph>.</p>
                  <p>She has turned her face from me—and sleeps.</p>
                  <p>I kneel beside her. "O God! let no infidel whisper disturb the calmness of her
                     repose. Send thy angels to minister to her. Let them bring sweet memories of
                     her childhood; pure dreams of her infant days when she clasped her hands and
                     answered, "Lord! here am I."</p>

                  <p>THE morning that followed this exciting scene that I have failed to describe,
                     and to do so justly would be impossible, found Irene pale, quiet, and suffering
                     from headache. It was raining so hard that we could not think of looking out of
                     doors for amusement. At this time I was in constant association with Mrs.
                     Searle and with her adopted daughter; my husband had gone farther North, and,
                     at Mrs. Searle's urgent solicitation, I consented to remain in New York until
                     his return.</p>
                  <p>At about noon, Mrs. Searle, against Irene's wishes, sent for a physician, who
                     prescribed perfect repose, and his advice happened to correspond with Irene's
                     wishes; she was not inclined to converse, and when we spoke to her, answered us
                     by a word, or not at all. Mrs. Searle, convinced at last of the propriety of
                     informing Mr. Hamilton of the alarming condition of his daughter, wrote him
                     fully on the subject, and left him to decide what it was proper to do. In the
                     mean time, until she could hear from him, she consented to gratify me, by going
                     home with us, where Irene would hear spiritualism mentioned only in
                     condemnation. I tried to induce Irene to look for pleasure in a visit to the
                     South, and assured her that my daughter, who was her own age, would regard her
                     as a sister; but though she offered no objections to our plans, she took no
                     interest in them, and the hope that I might influence her and be of service to
                     her, was dying away.</p>
                  <p>Towards the close of the day, she was evidently brighter, and, at my
                     suggestion, got up and dressed for the evening that we were to pass quietly in
                     Mrs. Searle's private parlor. Several friends assembled there, and the
                     Professor came, as usual; he had been deserted by his wife, who had gone to
                     pass a sociable evening with the ghost of Napoleon Bonaparte. The Professor
                     looked grave, though he was most affectionate in his manner to Irene, who was
                     much attached to him. I sighed, as I thought the time might be gone forever,
                     when his influence over her could be for her good. Irene, languid and perfectly
                     quiet, sat on a small sofa, and by her the Professor established himself; at
                     first, he tried to draw her<pb n="102-103" xml:id="VAC6361-00000052"/> into
                     conversation, but soon perceiving that she was annoyed by his attention, he let
                     her alone. Irene's harp, that Mrs. Searle had sent from Boston to the St.
                     Nicholas, stood in the corner; it had been untouched since it came. I had the
                     greatest wish to hear Irene play, for I had heard much of her genius for music.
                     Towards the close of the evening I went to her, and proposed that she should
                     gratify me; she refused at first, but seeing me very anxious, she crossed the
                     room to where the harp was standing. Before this, she had seemed almost angry
                     when any one asked her to play. Now, she stood for a moment by the instrument,
                     then passed her fingers over the untuned strings.</p>
                  <p>She was dressed in white, and the lily of the valley drooped, as usual, in her
                     hair. I told her once that she had been reading the Blithedale romance, and,
                     like Zenobia, she had chosen and always wore her emblem; but she said, that
                     from a child she had always dressed her hair with lilies, her mother used to
                     gather and put them there. I was affected by the simplicity with which she
                     accounted for her fondness for this simple ornament.</p>
                  <p>She stood tuning the harp, and looking most lovely as she touched string after
                     string, bringing, by the touch, harmony from discord. Sweeter and more perfect
                     became the chords, until she swept over them a skilful hand, now and again
                     detecting a slight imperfection of sound that could not escape her ear.</p>
                  <p>"Irene," said the Professor to me, "is most beautiful when tuning her harp. She
                     is the very impersonation of harmony, the throned queen of music. Standing
                     there, across this great room, looks she not like a siren from under the sea?
                     with those flowing robes white like its foam. If she live and recover from this
                     sickness, if sickness it may be, Irene will be the perfect woman; if she love,
                     she will love once and forever. Yet, she will never enslave herself to lover or
                     husband, for she has naturally an independence of mind that every woman ought
                     to possess. The pressure of disease has enfeebled this, but I trust that her
                     dignity of character will reassert itself. So far, she has known no thought of
                     Love; the love of her scattered or broken family; the love of books, of the
                     arts, of nature, these have been all in all to her. I wish she did love some
                     man worthy of her; it would be an anchor that would steady her affections. What
                     a scene that was last night! how she suffered! it was a nervous excitement,
                     bewilderment, derangement. I am ready to renounce spiritualism when I think of
                     it. Hear that magnificent prelude!"</p>
                  <p>We listened as she performed piece after piece of the most brilliant music. She
                     was not playing for others, but for herself, and she threw her whole soul<pb
                        n="104-105" xml:id="VAC6361-00000053"/> into the performance; she was so
                     deeply absorbed in her occupation, that, I am sure, she was unconscious of the
                     presence of listeners. She played the most difficult pieces for a time, and
                     slowly changed to a strain that had a <emph>dying fall</emph>; then, drawing
                     out the last sweet, sad notes, she turned away from the harp.</p>
                  <p>"Don't get up, Irene," said Mrs. Searle; "give us one song."</p>
                  <p>"Oh, yes!" said several persons, "do sing; sing one of the exquisite songs from
                     Norma."</p>
                  <p>She looked at me. "What shall I sing?"</p>
                  <p>"Something that you like!" I answered.</p>
                  <p>"It will be very simple," she said. Then she added, striking the chords, "I
                     arranged the air to these beautiful words."</p>
                  <p>She played part of the air as a prelude, and then sang:— <q>

                           <l>"Tears, idle tears, I know not what they mean,</l>

                     Professor good-night; he held my hand for a moment, slowly enunciating these

                  <p>THAT night, Mrs. Searle complained of not feeling as well as usual, and I
                     advised her to go to bed, and, that she might be under no anxiety about Irene,
                     I told her I would sleep with her. So, I invited Irene to come to my room,
                     pleading my unwillingness to be alone.</p>
                  <p>Long after we had retired, Irene continued restless; but I thought it best not
                     to notice it, hoping each moment that she would fall asleep, but as she tossed
                     on her pillow, and did not seem to be composing herself, I asked if anything
                     were the matter, that she could not sleep. She said she was always wakeful
                     during the first hours of the night. She seemed inclined to converse, and I
                     hoped that she would presently be fatigued from talking, and fall into slumber.
                     She mentioned her mother.</p>
                  <p>"You do not know," she said, "how lying here by your side has recalled to my
                     mind the last few nights of my mother's life. It has brought every hour back.
                     Mrs. Searle is very good to me, and I love her; but you—it must be that you
                     speak so often of God that I feel more at home with you, as if my mother spoke
                     to me through you."</p>
                  <p>"Let it be so, my dearest," I said. "You are not well, and you have seen heavy
                     affliction, but it is time now that its remembrance should be softened; you
                     must not keep it so constantly before you; there are many happy days in store
                     for you, if you will believe it. But, as you hope again to hold intercourse
                     with your mother, avoid the company of those who do not believe in God; look
                     upon an infidel with horror."</p>
                  <p>"My father is an infidel," she said, in reply.</p>
                  <p>"Pray for him, then, and try, by every means, to change his views; but, my dear
                     child, what do <emph>you</emph> believe on this, to us all, momentous
                     subject?"</p>
                  <p>"Oh! I cannot tell you, for I do not know; lately everything is confused when I
                     think about it. Is not nature God? My father says so? Is God indeed, as others
                     say, so awful, so unapproachable? Was Christ this God? Yes, yes! my mother
                     assured me that. Is Heaven a place where the weary are at rest? Is there a
                     hell? a place of torment and of burning, where their worm dieth not. O God!"<pb
                        n="108-109" xml:id="VAC6361-00000055"/> and she started from her pillow,
                     sitting up in bed, and clasping her hands over her head. "O God! tell me how
                     all this is!"</p>
                  <p>Shocked at her excessive agitation, I saw how unwise I had been to stir within
                     her bosom these contending thoughts. I begged her to lie down again, and after
                     a little while she became more quiet. "But I cannot sleep," she said. "Let me
                     go back to the time when I loved God and the Bible; let me tell you of my
                     childhood."</p>

                  <p>"MY childhood!" Irene repeated. "Like Eve, I had none. Yet in nothing else can
                     I say, like Eve. Had I sinned, there was no Eden to lose; no beauteous garden;
                     no breeze born in heaven; no tree of life. It seems to me, there was ever, from
                     the earliest dawn of my intellect, a flaming sword, turning every way, scaring
                     me from the hope of happiness.</p>
                  <p>"In my first years, I was separated from my mother. She was returned to me, and
                     I loved her. Oh, how sweet to be able to say, she loved me! I was her oldest
                     child; then a brother, and a little sister so fair, that I wonder if she were
                     other than an angel straying from her heavenly home. Not lost—permitted to
                     wander. She has returned from whence she came.</p>
                  <pb n="110-111" xml:id="VAC6361-00000056"/>
                  <p>"My father worshipped his two youngest children, but he never, in my
                     remembrance, gave me one word, one look of affection. His lips never touched
                     mine, nor was I ever folded to his heart. How can this be? you ask, and so I
                     have often asked myself.</p>
                  <p>"Perhaps—the thought <emph>would</emph> come to me—I am not his child. Some one
                     found me, a poor, desolate thing, and brought me to his door, and she whom I
                     called mother persuaded him to let her take me in.</p>
                  <p>"Thus did I speculate on my own history, as I lay on my little bed at night. I
                     longed to ask my mother if it were so; but something restrained me. In summer,
                     I would look up to the silvery-tipped clouds, when, the shutters fastened open,
                     the moon would shine in the broad windows. My mother thought I was sleeping,
                     when I was listening to the wind, and watching the branches of the trees as
                     they swung by, the shadows of the leaves playing on my bed. I loved to hear
                     their rustling. 'What do they talk about?' I asked myself. 'Can
                        <emph>they</emph> tell me why my father does not love me?' And the waves of
                     the Hudson, that were forever dashing against the rocks near our house: I was
                     sure <emph>they</emph> had a voice. What did they say? Oh! I often fell asleep,
                     wearied out, trying to understand this great mystery. Young as I was, nature
                     taught me the parent must love the child.</p>
                  <p>"My ideas changed with the passing years. I was assured the sad, beautiful
                     woman, in whose presence I was continually, was my mother. As I grew older, I
                     saw her devotion to me; the compressing of her lips, that seemed forced to be
                     silent, when cold words were spoken to me; the many times that, when we were
                     alone, she folded me in her arms and wept over me. I knew she was my
                     mother.</p>
                  <p>"No longer a child, my desire to know the mystery was more intense. Once, a
                     thought came; had it remained, it would have destroyed me. She was surely my
                     mother; but he, whose roof sheltered me, was not my father. Affectionate to all
                     but me, I was nothing to him. I knew my mother's history: this was her only
                     marriage; she was still young. Could she have loved other than her husband? Was
                     this her great, her hopeless sorrow? And was there sin added to sorrow? Oh!
                     could there be shame attached to her whose presence reminded you of the angels?
                     It could not be! The moonlight, the clouds, the waving branches, the gurgling
                     river—my own heart, answered me. She whom I so loved, who so loved me, was
                     good. There must be a secret in her history. I knew my father's devotion to
                     her; did she respond to his deep affection? Her life said yes. She anticipated
                     his wishes, and her first desire was to please him.</p>
                  <p>"And I was his child. Every feature in my face is his own. My dark eyes, this
                     mass of black hair, the<pb n="112-113" xml:id="VAC6361-00000057"/> very
                     expression of my countenance. From my mother I inherited the fairness of my
                     complexion, the strong will, and the loving heart.</p>
                  <p>"She <emph>left</emph> me these, for she died. There was no sudden breaking of
                     the golden bowl. The silver cord of life was gently loosened, as if we could
                     see it unwind. There was no perceptible decay. She faded from us. My father's
                     love, the caresses of the little ones, my own hopeless grief, were of no avail
                     to detain her. She was quite calm, almost cheerful, at the prospect of passing
                     through "those dark gates, across the wild that no man knows." During her long
                     illness, I promoted, in every way, my father's comfort. And he rarely noticed
                     me. Hour by hour he sat by my mother's side, with little Margaret in his arms.
                     I have told you how he loved and indulged my brother. He only spoke to me when
                     it was necessary; yet he was always polite. He treated me like a stranger,
                     while to my mother I was dearer than her own life.</p>
                  <p>"Can you wonder that, as I grew older, I was often unhappy? My pride was
                     roused; I felt wronged. What had I done to be treated thus? Every day I
                     determined to ask my mother why it was; but every day brought a heavier
                     grief—she was failing. The time was coming to me when I should realize the
                     words, 'Woe to him that is alone.'</p>
                  <p>"And yet they were sweet—the hours that I passed with my mother when we were by
                     ourselves. Then she would talk of her early life, of <emph>her</emph> mother,
                     who died when she was very young; of those who had been her friends in her
                     southern home. Even her flowers were not forgotten. There were the pink cluster
                     rose that climbed round and in the windows of her chamber, and the multiflora
                     that almost covered the side of the house, and many flowers and shrubs that I
                     had not seen in the harsher climate of the North. Of everything we talked at
                     night, when I was resting by her side, for I was her constant nurse; she could
                     not bear me away from her pillow.</p>
                  <p>"One night, my father sat close by her bed, holding her hand in his, while she
                     spoke of that great change that she was so soon to experience in her own
                     person, but that would come to all. Oh, how she entreated him to read the
                     Bible, to become a Christian, that he might derive the consolation that only a
                     Christian can claim in the inevitable trials of life!</p>
                  <p>"'What is death,' she said, 'to those who believe in Jesus? We must die that we
                     may fully live. We <emph>must</emph> die, and I feel that death is a glorious
                     privilege, dark as is the valley of its shadow. How truly has it been said,
                     "The whole sum of human life is a veiling and an obscuring of the immortal
                     spirit of man! Then, first, when the fleshly curtain falls away, may it soar
                     upwards into a region of happier melodies." Oh, believe me! Let me speak; it
                        is<pb n="114-115" xml:id="VAC6361-00000058"/> the last time. There is a God!
                     There is eternal life! There is eternal death! Doubt it no more, my dear
                     husband, as you would not bind your soul to an eternity of woe!'</p>
                  <p>"'Margaret,' said my father, 'compose yourself! "Why again agitate this
                     subject? See how you have exhausted your little strength.'</p>
                  <p>"'I would spend it all, could I persuade you to believe as I do.'</p>
                  <p>"He smiled sadly. 'Can I believe against the dictates of my intellect and
                     reason?'</p>
                  <p>"'What is intellect? what is reason,' she said, 'in the presence of God? They
                     are His servants, and should be yours. But you make yourself their slave!'</p>
                  <p>"He did not reply again, but by bending over to kiss her forehead and her lips.
                     Then he went to his room for the night. What would I have given for one caress,
                     one word! I loved him then, I love him now. I possess, in the secret depths of
                     my soul, his tender, his passionate nature. I would, at this moment, give all
                     my hopes of this life, and all of heaven, were he here, holding my aching head
                     to his bosom. But he has left me, and forever. Is he not cruel to slight me so,
                     in the face of the world!</p>
                  <p>"When he was gone, I went to the bedside and threw myself in the chair in which
                     he had been sitting. My mother drew my face down to hers and kissed me. 'Irene!
                     my child,' she said, 'must we be separated? Your sweet, sad face, will be
                     before me, the last, the dearest thing in life. There is a dreary time in store
                     for you, young and fair as you are; I dread to leave you here, to struggle with
                     all alone; I have prayed God to let me see you happy in the affection of some
                     heart noble as your own, but it is not to be. What will you do when I am not
                     here to console you with my affection! Oh, God!' she said, clasping her thin
                     hands, and raising her eyes to heaven, 'mercy, mercy, for my child! I am most
                     guilty in thy sight, but Jesus has died. Visit not my sin upon her.' Then
                     closing her eyes, she murmured, 'if I have sinned, I have suffered!'</p>
                  <p>"She was very pale, and I offered her a cordial that she was accustomed to
                     take. She drank it and revived, then begged me to go to bed. I told her it was
                     early, and I was not disposed to sleep.</p>
                  <p>"'Mother,' I said, 'will you forgive me for asking you a question? will you
                     answer it? What did you mean, when you said in your prayer for me, 'if I have
                     sinned, I have suffered!'</p>
                  <p>"A flush passed over her face, and left it whiter than before. 'Did I say so?'
                     she said; 'I did not mean you to hear. Forget it, Irene. We are all most guilty
                     in the sight of God. Oh, my daughter! so live <emph>in your heart</emph>, that
                     when the time of death is near, no retrospection will arise to haunt your
                        last<pb n="116-117" xml:id="VAC6361-00000059"/> hours. I hope that my sins
                     are washed out in the blood of the Atonement, but when I look at you, the past
                     affrights me almost from the gate of heaven.'</p>
                  <p>"'What is it?' I said, 'that is so dreadful in the past? I know you have
                     suffered. You are suffering now. But, mother, how have you sinned? Can you not
                     treat me with the confidence that I feel I deserve?'</p>
                  <p>"'Don't ask me! why should you wish to know? Be satisfied when I tell you, that
                     in the sight of man my life has been irreproachably pure, but God looks at the
                     secret springs of action in the soul. What would you that I should tell you?
                     You know the history of my life, or so much of it as you need know.'</p>
                  <p>"'Tell me, oh, do, mother! the history of your heart.' I could not look in her
                     face when I asked her, so I laid my cheek against her hand; 'for all my life I
                     have wanted to know why my father treats me with such coldness, when he loves
                     his other children so dearly. Did I ever displease him? but I know I never
                     could. Not to night, dearest mother, you are so tired. You must go to sleep.
                     But tomorrow, when we are alone again. Promise me you will.'</p>
                  <p>"'I will, my darling, if you wish it. Perhaps it may be best. Read me a few
                     verses in the Bible, and then we will try and sleep."'</p>

                  <p>'"YOU ask me," said my mother, "why your father does not love you? He
                        <emph>does love you</emph>; though you were but an infant when he swore, by
                     the God <emph>in whom he does not believe</emph>, that he would never
                     acknowledge you by any act of affection to be his child. I have kneeled to him
                     to retract this sinful, this unnatural oath; but this, the greatest boon that I
                     could ask of him, is the only one he has refused; unless I except one other,
                     that he would love and reverence God. But, Irene, cruel as was his vow, he had
                     provocation at the time, though not from you. I, the offender, should have
                     suffered alone; on you has ever fallen his severest resentment. Thus it is in
                     life. When we err, we do not suffer singly. As no<pb n="118-119"
                        xml:id="VAC6361-00000060"/> human being can live aloof from society, so the
                     acts of each one, in a measure, affect for good or ill, those with whom that
                     one is connected. Think of this, if ever temptation should bear against you.
                     Women, who are beautiful, have need of every safeguard that the strictest
                     principle can afford them. But women of intellect have a double need of
                     precaution. Their talents give them a power over others. The very consciousness
                     of this power may make them careless of its exercise. Genius and beauty may
                     both be blessings to a woman, but she may turn the blessing to a curse.</p>
                  <p>"<emph>That</emph> will tell you, Irene, what I was, when I first saw your
                     father." My mother pointed to a likeness of herself that hung opposite to the
                     bed. It was a portrait the size of life, painted by Alexander, in his best
                     days, and was a representation of youth, exquisite to see. The fairy form, the
                     white arms, the beautiful shoulders, around which flowed drapery of gauze, that
                     floated away as if to mingle with the clouds. I looked at the picture with an
                     interest that I had never felt before. The lips were apart as if about to
                     speak; the eyes radiant with happy thought; the light hair, pushed away from
                     the temples, and falling among the folds of gauze. So calm, so holy an
                     expression dwelt on that sweet face, that I turned to my mother and said: "You
                     may have suffered, but you never sinned"</p>
                  <p>"Not then, not then," she said. "When that was taken, I had never thought of
                     suffering or of sin. My mother died before I knew the value of a mother. My
                     father allowed me every indulgence. I have often told you how carefully I was
                     educated, and you have every advantage that I had, and more. In this, your
                     father has not failed in his duty to you, and although he says nothing, I know
                     he takes great pride in your proficiency. Like you, I was devoted to reading,
                     and my father encouraged in me this fondness. He could not bear novels, and did
                     not permit me to read them; but his library was full of good books; of essays,
                     poetry, and history. Living at some distance from town, there were few
                     interruptions to our quiet but pleasant life, when at home. My father was much
                     occupied with the cares of business, his servants, and the plantation, so I was
                     left a great deal to myself. Half my time, in summer, was spent in the arbor
                     reading. When I was tired of my book, I would throw it aside, and <emph>build
                        castles in the air</emph>, or sleep an hour away. I was a leaf, floating on
                     the still bright waters, safe, until the winds sprung up. I did not know of
                     what material I was made. My father, a worldly and proud man, was unacquainted
                     with a nature like mine. One idea had been the leading one in my education—that
                     my will was to be moulded by his, to be lost in it. He was proud of me, and
                     impatient to introduce<pb n="120-121" xml:id="VAC6361-00000061"/> duce me into
                     society. The time was near at hand, for I had left school, not to return; yet I
                     was still a child, as much so as when my old nurse rocked me to sleep in her
                     arms, singing her sweet camp meeting hymns of Moses the meek man, and of Judas
                     who sold the Lord. Such was my twilight of happiness, ere the new, short day
                     had dawned.</p>
                  <p>"The gentleman whose plantation was next to ours was a Mr. Murray. He had an
                     only son, who was so anxious to be educated at West Point, that his parents had
                     obtained an appointment for him, though they were much opposed to a military
                     profession. Algernon Murray graduated with great credit, and then joined his
                     regiment for a short time; after which, he obtained a leave of absence and
                     visited Europe. Immediately on his return he came home; then, for the first
                     time, I knew him.</p>
                  <p>"Here, Irene, begins the <emph>history of my heart</emph>. You have only been
                     conscious of such affection as lives in the heart of the sister, or the child.
                     But when that picture was painted, every passion and emotion of <emph>my
                        soul</emph> had been suddenly waked up from its sleeping existence. So
                     ignorant of the nature of such love as mine was, are you, that I allude to it
                     with hesitation. I would do so delicately, as I would touch ivory with a rose
                     leaf. But you must know all.</p>
                  <p>"I told you that I had read no romances. Love, the new life, breaking over my
                     existence, was like the gorgeous gleaming of the sunrise on the hills. Look at
                     my face in the picture, and see it written there. It was not the mere outline
                     of the features that the artist drew; he threw over them the joy that lightened
                     my every step, and beamed in the brightness of my smile. When I look at that
                     picture, I do not feel that it is myself but some girl, who may be compared to
                     one standing on the verge of the ocean, entranced with the sunlight glowing in
                     the distance, hearing not the near winds, heeding not the waves that are
                     tossing at her feet. I am ready to weep that her joyous face must lose its
                     charm, her step become heavy as it treads its way. She may survive the
                     gathering storm, that will leave her like a wreck on the shore.</p>
                  <p>"I loved, Irene, and why? and how? I looked into his soul, and saw, as in a
                     mirror, the reflection of my own. Thoughts that had often sped like lightning
                     through my brain, he spoke aloud to me as I listened. The books that I had
                     liked most, were, to him, as household words. He loved the contemplation of
                     nature, not selfishly, and living with her, apart from mankind, but obediently,
                     as if she commanded him to love all, for her sake. He noticed the smallest
                     flower that bloomed at our feet, referring it to the great Author. His mind was
                     a treasure house; there was the learning of observation added to that of books.
                     He would talk of the<pb n="122-123" xml:id="VAC6361-00000062"/> past and of the
                     marks with which the present recorded it. He would take me with him, through
                     the convents, the dungeons, the desolated sepulchres; and I would weep when he
                     told of all that mortals, like ourselves, had suffered. His favorite theme was
                     martyrdom; he loved to talk of the martyrs of religion, of patriotism, and of
                     love. Every age,' he said, had its martyrs; there were those, who, in our own
                     time, for duty and for God, gave up all that earth could offer.' He told me of
                     one who said, 'heroes were found not merely on the field of battle, but also
                     upon the consecrated soil of virtue. The grandest of all heroic deeds are those
                     which are performed within four walls and in domestic privacy.' Often, I
                     wondered that there was any charm, to him, in the life of a soldier, for he
                     could never, with his tender nature, have become hardened to the sight of blood
                     or suffering.</p>
                  <p>"My father, with that want of foresight that we often observe in those who are
                     striving for this world, did not see what was going on within me. At least, he
                     did not speak of it; nor did I conceal anything from him. Oh! I did not ask
                     myself, whence was the golden light whose radiance beckoned me to follow on. It
                     was as natural for me to love, as for yon star to look at its image on the
                     wave. Now, lying on my death-bed, with this faint breath growing fainter, to my
                     own consciousness, I look back to that time and say it was holy. Had an angel
                     from heaven stood close by my side as I sat, with my hand in Algernon's,
                     hearing him talk of God and of God's creatures, I should have looked for
                     sympathy and not for reproof.</p>
                  <p>"I said that my father was a stern man, but I do not like to speak of his
                     resentful, unforgiving disposition. It were a long story, to tell minutely, all
                     the reasons that influenced him in his course towards me. It is sufficient to
                     say that years before this period, the elder Mr. Murray had offended him, about
                     a matter of business connected with their estates, and that, in a lawsuit that
                     followed, my father was the loser. The loss was trifling, considered in point
                     of money, but his proud nature had received a check, and though he always
                     treated Mr. Murray with a reserved politeness, he never forgave him. When the
                     son returned from Europe, my father was from home; he was detained away longer
                     than he expected; on his return, he found Algernon a frequent visitor in his
                     house. We were in the habit of riding and walking together, and of passing
                     hours in the library, reading, or talking of books that we had read. My father
                     permitted this to continue, nor did he ever, by word or look, make an objection
                     to our intimacy. What was my grief and consternation, when, being informed of
                     our engagement, he positively refused his consent. He would<pb n="124-125"
                        xml:id="VAC6361-00000063"/> not hear of it. When I entreated, he ridiculed
                     me; when I wept, he became angry; when I threatened, he was stern and
                     contemptuous. For I did threaten, so desperate was I at the thought of being
                     separated forever from Algernon. The idea appalled me. I could have borne a
                     separation of a year—a thousand years! had I been told to hope. But my father
                     could forbade me to think of him. As if the affections could be
                     constrained.</p>
                  <p>"Yes, he forbade me to think of him, called my love a childish fancy, and,
                     irritated at my <emph>daring to have a will</emph>, vowed he would
                        <emph>bend</emph> or <emph>break it</emph> to his own. He refused all
                     conciliatory advances from the Murrays, and declared his intention of taking me
                     from home in order to bring me to my senses. I knew I must go, but I said that
                     I would never break my engagement, and that I felt as solemnly bound to
                     Algernon Murray as if I were his wife. When Algernon begged him to wait awhile,
                     and not to let his decision be a final one, in reply, he asked him, as a
                     gentleman and a Christian, to withdraw from the engagement, for that his mind
                     was irrevocably made up, and his persisting in it would have no other effect
                     than to widen the breach that <emph>he</emph> had made between a father and his
                     only child. Such an appeal was not lost upon a heart so full of self-respect,
                     but so fearful of erring towards others. After a few days, Algernon wrote me a
                     short note, in which he said he was impelled by a sense of duty to withdraw,
                     but that God might yet have better things in store for us. Very affectionate
                     were his wishes for my happiness, Irene! but I crushed the paper in my hands,
                     threw it on the floor, and stamped upon it. I felt that he treated me like a
                     toy in giving me up so calmly. I could have forgiven him had he been poor; but
                     his friends were rich and proud, like my own, and I had heard they were urging
                     him to release me from my engagement on account of my father's overbearing
                     conduct to them. My father laughed when he saw my passion, and said, 'He has
                     saved you the trouble of discarding him; show a woman's pride, and
                     forget."'</p>

                  <p>"AH, my child! when a woman loves, it is with difficulty she summons her pride.
                     What cared I for pride? He was gone. The sun shone, but the light was darkness
                     to me. I thought that every object in nature sorrowed for me—every sound was a
                     sigh. Had Algernon told me, instead of writing, that he should leave me, I
                     would have entreated him to take me with him to the farthest ends of the earth.
                     I could not, in thought, separate myself from him. He was always with me, but
                     it was a mournful presence. I listened for his voice; I looked for his smile; I
                     held out my hand that he should clasp it. I fought against my destiny, and
                     could not be consoled.</p>
                  <p>"My father was kind and stern by turns; it was all the same to me. Algernon was
                     gone. He reproved me, and even wept at the sight of my pale face. I told him
                        <emph>that</emph> was useless; to recall Algernon, and I should be happy
                     again. Oh, Irene! it was a cruel wrong to tear away life and hope from the
                     young heart. He knew not what he did in dragging to the light the rebellious
                     passions of my nature; he crushed all that was good within me. I never could
                     understand how he could love me, and persist in making me wretched. Sometimes,
                     he seemed on the point of yielding; yet such softness did not influence him
                     long. He hoped that time would do its work for me, and it did.</p>
                  <p>"Irene, I did not know where to look for consolation. My father was not a
                     religious man, though he had me taught, as is usual, certain principles
                     connected with the Christian religion. I knew there was a God, but I thought
                     not of him as being merciful. I often read the Bible, but did not apply its
                     teachings. Through the day, I mechanically complied with the desires of my
                     father, who thought by employment to interest my mind in other things. I obeyed
                     all his wishes; but at night, when alone, I only wept. Oh, it is sad to think
                     of a heart whose windows are closed forever, on whose threshold hope may never
                     stand. And such was mine!</p>
                  <p>"My old nurse passed with me the sleepless nights. 'Child,' she would say, 'the
                     Lord is good;<pb n="128-129" xml:id="VAC6361-00000065"/> look up to him. You
                     must wait until you get to heaven to be happy. There's no crying there.' I had
                     heard her entreat my father for me; she risked his anger as she would have
                     risked her own life, but it did no good.</p>
                  <p>"Days and weeks passed, and still I wept. I mourned, as it were, the death of
                     my life; but the time came that my tears were dried. Then were crushed the
                     joyous impulses of my nature; then died the first, best feelings of my youth.
                     My father called me to him, and thanked me that I had become obedient and
                     submissive, and said there was much happiness in the future for his dutiful
                     child. He clasped me to his bosom, and <emph>he</emph> wept: but I felt that
                     the sentence of my doom had been read. I was quiet, but cold and hard, like a
                     rock, and unforgiving to him and to Algernon. One voice came to console me; it
                     said, the grave! I listened for the summons to go and lie down in it and
                     forget, but it came not.</p>
                  <p>"My father determined to make a visit to New York, which was his home previous
                     to his marriage. Our preparations were made for a long absence, and we left the
                     place where, most happily, passed my early years; where, for a short season, I
                     had experienced the greatest happiness of which woman's heart is capable, and
                     where, in the sudden breaking of strong ties, I had endured its extremest
                     misery. Man loves, and suffers, and changes, or forgets. If, indeed, he prove
                     faithful, a softened regret is his utmost burden. But woman ventures her all
                     when she loves. I do not refer to the every-day romances of life; but, where a
                     woman of strong feeling and cultivated intellect yields herself up to an
                     affection for one <emph>who is worthy</emph>, whatever be the other
                     circumstances, it is happiness or misery forever, to her, in this world.</p>
                  <p>"Let me do my father justice. He loved me, and made every effort to amuse me,
                     and make me happy. My friends, some of whom knew the circumstances that I have
                     just told you, united with him to draw me away from my own thoughts. I went
                     into all the dissipation of fashionable life, and I was vain of the admiration
                     I excited. It was a blessing to me, my fondness for reading; it helped to pass
                     the heavy hours. But I was almost always from home in some scene of gayety, and
                     never knew a moment of real happiness. There <emph>never</emph> was a time, in
                     that gay winter, but I would have thanked God could I have laid my head on
                        <emph>his</emph> bosom and died. My father saw through the mask that I was
                     wearing, and there was no limit to his fondness and indulgence. Then, more than
                     at any other time, he softened to me, but was too proud to make advances to Mr.
                     Murray, or to permit me to do so. He persuaded himself and almost convinced me,
                     at times, that I was slighted<pb n="130-131" xml:id="VAC6361-00000066"/> by
                     Algernon's silence, in spite of the command that he had laid upon me to receive
                     no communication from him. I had several other offers from men of standing and
                     wealth, that I refused at once. But, while I loved Algernon Murray devotedly as
                     at first, I nursed in my bosom, against him, a bitterness, a resentment, that
                     he had left me to my fate; I did not realize the position in which my father's
                     rudeness had placed him."</p>
                  <p>"Sometimes," said Irene, "my poor mother would become so exhausted that she
                     would look unearthly. The shadows that lay beneath her eyes, from long illness,
                     would seem to grow darker as by recalling the past, agonizing memories were
                     stirred up. I would bid her rest; though unwillingly, for I was so anxious to
                     hear all. Always, I fell asleep looking at her picture. The curls would seem to
                     wave when the soft night winds were permitted to enter the room. The brow so
                     calm, so fair, with the blue veins tracing their way beneath. Far more like
                     life it looked than the emaciated, though still lovely face that lay on the
                     pillow near me. Often, when I awoke, my father would be with her, and the two
                     children."</p>

                  <p>'"It was during the winter," thus my mother continued her history, "that I
                     passed in New York, in the whirl of fashion and of folly, that I again met your
                     father. Did I tell you that in the preceding summer he had passed a week at our
                     house? He was then returning from New Orleans where business had taken him. We
                     had never met before his visit to us in Georgia, and he was away from New York
                     when we went there, but returned during the gay season. From the first he
                     devoted himself to me, and my father saw his attachment with great pleasure. He
                     did not wish me to return to Georgia to live, and therefore he encouraged your
                     father's attentions to me. And other reasons influenced him. He was proud of
                     your father's talents and of his position; every way the connection was
                        agreeable<pb n="132-133" xml:id="VAC6361-00000067"/> able. I do not like to
                     dwell here, Irene! But I must tell you that the importunities of my father and
                     his friends almost drove me wild. I did not wish to marry, but they thought I
                     would be happier, no doubt, to have objects on which my heart might rest. I
                     threw myself on my father's bosom, and prayed him to recall Algernon, for that
                     I could only be happy in his affection. 'Oh, heavens!' he said, 'that a woman
                     can be so lost to her own self-esteem! Must I ask him to marry you? Shall I
                     write to him and say, "Please come and take pity on my daughter." Where is your
                     woman's dignity, Margaret? I was silenced, but not convinced; yet I said to
                     myself, why does he not come or write to me?</p>
                  <p>"One day my father said to me, 'Margaret, I want you to make me a promise that
                     you will never mention Algernon Murray's name to me again. I am wearied to
                     death with the subject. Had he really loved you, as I have often said, he would
                     have tried, in some way, to communicate with you. Now, I declare solemnly, and
                     in the presence of God, that whatever comes, I will never consent to your
                     marriage with him.' Again I felt the strong will that was bending me to its
                     purposes.</p>
                  <p>"'Promise me,' he said, 'for his very name is hateful to me, it has so long
                     been a contention between us. You have so many blessings; what more can you
                     desire? Beauty, talents, position, and wealth. Edward Murray has, by this time,
                     learned to love some other woman. Superior, as I allow he is to the rest of his
                     family, I never knew one of them who could be depended upon. However this may
                     be, can you make no sacrifice of your feelings for your father?'</p>
                  <p>"'Would you be happy if I made you this promise?' I asked.</p>
                  <p>"'I would indeed,' he said. 'All would be between us as it was before you knew
                     Mr. Murray. There would be no discord, no coldness.'</p>
                  <p>"I looked earnestly at his face; there was no yielding there. I was
                     conquered.</p>
                  <p>"' Will you forget him?' he said.</p>
                  <p>"'Oh, no! I shall always love him, and when you divided us, you destroyed all
                     happiness for me in this world. I will promise what you wish. But I tell you
                     now that had Algernon Murray spoken the word, I would have left all, even you,
                     for him. But he thought your claim on my obedience and love was stronger than
                     his, and he has left me to my fate. Whatever that fate may be, remember you
                     have made it!'</p>
                  <p>"Oh, this was a time hard to bear, Irene! I will hurry past it. I was persuaded
                     into a marriage with your father. I never deceived him, but told him honestly
                     the state of my affections. My father<pb n="134-135" xml:id="VAC6361-00000068"
                     /> persuaded him that I was full of romantic notions, that would die away when
                     I entered upon the duties of a wife. So he hoped, and he urged the marriage to
                     take place with as little delay as possible. I was not willing. I felt that I
                        <emph>must see</emph> Algernon once more; then, let what would come. Like
                     some poor bird, I fluttered and beat my wings against my prison bars; but they
                     were iron, and I could not escape.</p>
                  <p>"My daughter! I said 'if I have sinned, I have suffered.</p>
                  <p>"Was it not a crime for me to stand at that holy altar, taking upon me those
                     solemn vows, promising love, respect, obedience, in the presence of God and
                     man, when my poor, restless heart was wandering in search of its other self?
                     Where were the affections that your father might claim by right of that
                     ceremony? Clinging still where they had once entwined. Robed in the garments of
                     a bride, I was mocking God, man, and myself. While the recording angel was
                     registering those vows, had I heard Algernon's voice, I would have fled from
                     the very altar to follow him. I did not think that he would let me be
                     sacrificed at the last; even in the church, I listened to every step, in the
                     hope that he would come and take me to his heart. Was not this a sin to bring
                     down the fearful judgments of Heaven? a sin over which angels might weep? Oh,
                     as I walked down the aisles of that church, there should have been stamped upon
                     my brow, 'wretched woman and perjured wife.'</p>
                  <p>"Time softened to me the mental suffering through which I had passed. Your
                     father brought me to this beautiful home, and every pleasure that wealth could
                     command, and every indulgence, was lavished upon me. We travelled in our own
                     country and in Europe during the first year of our marriage; but change of
                     scene did not restore me to happiness, or even to cheerfulness. God pitied me,
                     and sent you to lay against my heart and bid me hope. To nurse you, to make
                     your clothes, to amuse you, these were my greatest pleasures. I rarely trusted
                     you to a servant, excellent as were all about me. You were mine; I loved to
                     think of you as mine only. I would take you in my arms to the grove, which is
                     now your favorite place for reading; there I would sing you to sleep with songs
                     that seemed to me, as I recalled the happy times when I had sung them before,
                     in my dear southern home, like dirges for the dead. And when you slept, I would
                     lay you on a pillow, surrounded by flowers; then, seating myself near, I would
                     open some favorite book. Ah! too often blinding tears fell upon the page, too
                     often thought, rebellious, wandered to scenes, and to one from whom my heart
                     had never been weaned; too often, when I would cover your sweet face with<pb
                        n="136-137" xml:id="VAC6361-00000069"/> kisses, I would shudder at the
                     consciousness that there was no love in my heart for the father of my child.
                     Did I struggle against these fearful emotions? Oh, yes! but I knew not
                        <emph>how</emph> to conquer them. Submission had not come. I had not learned
                     to bow the head.</p>
                  <p>"Dearest, have I told you enough? You can see a meaning for the expression you
                     heard me use. I cannot bear to distress you or myself more. Are you not
                     satisfied?"</p>
                  <p>"No, no!" I said, "not till I know why my father made that vow about me. Do
                     tell me all, I entreat you."</p>
                  <p>"Once more," she said, after a pause of a minute, "once more I saw Algernon. It
                     was so lovely that evening, that as I look now from my death-bed towards the
                     grove, were I a believer in fate, I should say nature had clothed herself in
                     her fairest robes to tempt me to fill up the measure of my sorrow, and to add
                     to that sorrow, sin. Your father had gone to New York on business, and did not
                     expect to return until the morning. My father and I were sitting on the piazza
                     that overlooks the Hudson. He was enlarging on the splendor of a house that was
                     then in progress for us in the city. He lamented that I cared so little for the
                     many luxuries that wealth placed in my power, and reproached me that I did not
                     take more interest in the enjoyments of society.</p>
                  <p>"'I like the quiet of this country home,' I said; and dread passing my winters
                     in New York. Yet, as Mr. Hamilton wishes it, I am satisfied to go there.'</p>
                  <p>"'Satisfied!' my father exclaimed. 'A cold word to use, when your husband's
                     first desire is to see you happy.'</p>
                  <p>"'I know it,' I said; 'but you are the last person to reproach me. I once told
                     you that whatever might be my fate, you made it. And yet <emph>you</emph> blame
                     me that I am not happy.'</p>
                  <p>"I got up to go away, for I had been ill all day, and was wretched. I wanted to
                     be alone, and taking you from the nurse's arms, I turned my steps towards the
                     grove. There I was rarely disturbed. I walked awhile with you in the shade of
                     the trees; then seeing you asleep, I laid you on the pillow that had been left
                     there since the morning; I threw myself down beside you. It was towards
                     evening, and the grass felt cool to my burning, aching head.</p>
                  <p>"Since your birth, my daughter, I had been blessed with tears. My hard heart,
                     melted by your caresses, often thus relieved itself and bitter as they were at
                     the time, it was good for me to shed them. So I laid by you and wept. All the
                     past was present; I could not yet submit to my destiny; wedded<pb n="138-139"
                        xml:id="VAC6361-00000070"/> ded, and a mother, the yearning to see
                        <emph>him</emph> once more—to hear him speak, wrung my soul. Could I be
                     assured that <emph>he</emph> had not forgotten me, I would no longer strive
                     against what was inevitable. Oh! Irene! I know this wish was sin. But, had I
                     not been sinned against?</p>
                  <p>"As I thus wept, with my face covered with my hands, and pressed against the
                     earth, a voice called me to myself: 'Margaret! is it indeed so?'</p>
                  <p>"One instant, and we were face to face. Oh! the joy of that moment. Was it sin?
                     It was; O God, be merciful to me! Tempest tossed as I was, I basked in one
                     moment's gleam of sunlight. I laid my head against his breast. Only for an
                     instant he held it there, pressed his lips to my forehead, and then removed it,
                     saying: Your place is not here, Margaret. I wish it were.'</p>
                  <p>"I burst forth into reproaches, not more violent than just. I told him there
                     was no happiness for me in earth or heaven; that the weight of those awful vows
                     was upon me, that, in my heart, I had never kept, I never could keep with his
                     memory there. He tried to quiet my agitation, struggling with his own. He wept,
                     but only for an instant, and then became calm and resolute. He told me that he
                     had heard I was in ill health, and was not happy; that he hoped to learn that
                     such was not the case.</p>
                  <p>"'I did not expect to see you,' he said: 'for though I knew I was near your
                     husband's grounds, I did not know, until a moment ago, that I was upon them. I
                     was to leave for New York this evening, after having had the accounts I had
                     heard of you confirmed. There was a melancholy pleasure to me in wandering here
                     among scenes that are your home. But when I saw you weeping there, beside your
                     infant, I could not restrain my wish to speak to you.'</p>
                  <p>"'Oh!' I said; 'why did you not come and save me from all this sorrow, this
                     sin? why did you ever give me up?'</p>
                  <p>"'Forgive me for it; I have since bitterly reproached myself for doing so. Yet,
                     at the time, I thought I was doing right. All <emph>that</emph> is passed,
                     Margaret! I cannot take you to my bosom to wipe away those tears, but if you
                     bear up against what is adverse, if you steadily perform your duties as a wife
                     and a mother, God himself will wipe them away.'</p>
                  <p>"I did not answer, and he went on. 'We have met again, only to separate. But,
                     though our paths lie asunder, you alone shall possess my heart. No other woman
                     can ever have a place there. If this is the least comfort to you, take it, I
                     entreat you. And, though <emph>we must</emph> separate, be assured that all
                     that concerns you in life, will be of the deepest interest<pb n="140-141"
                        xml:id="VAC6361-00000071"/> terest to me. I can submit to feel myself a
                     sacrifice, but your unhappiness is the hardest trial of all. Could I know that
                     you were happy, I could leave you now with less regret.'</p>
                  <p>"'Shall we ever meet again?' I asked.</p>
                  <p>"'I know not. Margaret! God has so constituted the heart, that when in grief,
                     it can only truly find consolation in him. I told you this, in those happy
                     days, that neither you nor I can ever forget. I repeat it to you now. Do we
                     suffer? we are not to arm ourselves against the Creator; but we must remember
                     that we are ordained to suffering, as the consequence of sin. It is the lot of
                     all.'</p>
                  <p>"'I cannot understand you,' I said; 'but I wish I had your philosophy.'</p>
                  <p>"'It is not philosophy,' he replied. But only He who makes me submissive, can
                     make you so. Oh! Margaret, we have both suffered, and we will both suffer more.
                     But whatever I may be, with the consciousness that I have lost you forever, you
                     should not be unhappy.' He raised you in his arms, Irene, and kissed you. 'The
                     care of this lovely child,' he said, 'must be an infinite delight. Take it, and
                     let me go; yet when you hold it to your heart, remember me as one who will
                     always pray for your happiness.'</p>
                  <p>"He turned away, and I watched him as he went towards the woods, across which
                     lay he public road. How long I might have stood there unconscious, I cannot
                     tell, but your cry brought me to a sense of the present moment. I looked up as
                     I turned to go to the house, and near me, calm but colorless as death stood
                     your father. My child! I must have done. It is enough. Because you were clasped
                     in <emph>his</emph> arms, your father's were never more to enclose you. He
                     vowed this, in his just anger, and in his great sorrow, and he has kept his
                     vow. It was my long illness and suffering that softened him towards me. He
                     could never blame Mr. Murray, and for me he found some excuse; but perhaps I
                     would not have been entirely forgiven, but for what followed that wretched
                     evening.</p>
                  <p>"You have known, Irene, of the malady that, years ago, hung like a curse over
                     my father's family. Insanity—the greatest affliction that God brings upon his
                     creatures. Before me, a long interval had elapsed since any member of our
                     family had been so unfortunate. God saw fit to withdraw from me my reason. For
                     three long years I languished in an insane asylum. In time, I recovered, and
                     was restored to my family. Oh! I cannot tell you of the affection and the
                     kindness that your father has showed me. Nor has he ever reproached me with my
                     weakness, that was indeed a sin against him."</p>
                  <p>"How can you call it sin?" I said; "you were not to blame."</p>
                  <pb n="142-143" xml:id="VAC6361-00000072"/>
                  <p>"Oh! yes! I was; I should not have assumed the sacred name of wife to one,
                     while I loved another. Though, in a measure forced into marriage, I should have
                     resisted more firmly. God forgive me that I so long afterwards cherished a
                     sinful affection; <emph>He</emph> only knows how hard I struggled against it. I
                     opened the Book that tells us of the human heart, and of what it owes to God. I
                     saw how arrogantly I had set up my own will against the will of the Almighty. I
                     comprehended the purity of the Divine law, and how the thought of the heart
                     might be a deadly sin. I struggled against the sorrows that had oppressed me,
                     and <emph>God has wiped away my tears</emph>."'</p>
                  <p>"My mother closed her eyes as she ceased to speak. She had told me the history
                     of a heart. I did not again disturb her. Soon I saw her pass into sleep—'the
                     ante-chamber of death."'</p>

                  <p>"I SAID my mother died, and about that time, a cloud rests over my memory. I
                     cannot say if she expired in the early morning, or at noon; I only know we did
                     not talk together the night that followed. I watched her as she lay, pale,
                     quiet, dead. I could not be persuaded from her; others looked tired, whispered,
                     and slept in their chairs. I turned from the silent figure to the picture on
                     the wall.</p>
                  <p>"That picture, as it appeared to me, looked at the corpse. It expression
                     changed on the canvas, mocking the changelessness of those marble features,
                     calm in death. Calm, but not beautiful; there can be no beauty in death; there
                        <emph>is</emph> beauty in the idea of the spirit's clinging to the loved

                     where once the soul lived—</p>
                  <p>"I lifted my eyes from what was once my mother; the picture looked mournfully
                     at the blighted form. I thought of the first death she had died; of the burial
                     of her youth, of the putting out of sight of those hopes and desires that
                     should have blossomed through her life; I looked up, and the eyes of the
                     picture closed as in a solemn sorrow. Again I turned my eyes upon the face of
                     the dead; I thought of the long struggle, the crushed affections, the lifetime
                     of sorrow, the sin, the repentance, the tears, and I looked to the painting;
                        <emph>then</emph> the face was full of hope, radiant with joy. I did not
                     know what to think; I would have laid down, not to sleep, but to rest by
                        <emph>her</emph>, but they would not let me, and the night waned away.</p>
                  <p>"The time came for the funeral; they laid her in the grove at first; there,
                     amidst her roses, with the brown cones of the pine clustering over her grave,
                     she was left to rest.</p>
                  <p>"The little children, crying and frightened, had been carried away by the
                     servants; the group of friends had scattered; my father and I remained standing
                     by the newly laid earth. He looked round bewildered; my own deep sorrow was
                     forgotten in the contemplation of his; his handsome brow was lined, as if each
                     hour had made its mark, since she had gone. I would have then implored him to
                     pity my loneliness, to love me; but he perceived my presence, turned from me
                     and left me standing there. Do you think I can forget <emph>that?</emph>

                  <p>IRENE had finished. I kissed her and said: "Irene, God is your friend; trust
                     him."</p>
                  <p>"He is! he is!" she exclaimed, "through spiritualism. Once, God spoke to me by
                     the birds, the flowers, the sunshine, and the beautiful rain; they were my
                     sweet companions and consolers; now I need others, so he sends me the spirits
                     of my dear ones."</p>
                  <p>"Irene! the Bible was your mother's consolation in life and death; and you must
                     fulfil your woman's destiny."</p>
                  <p>"What is that?" she asked.</p>
                  <p>"Love," I answered,"is a woman's all. As children, we love our parents and our
                     nurses; as girls, our brothers—but as women—oh! Irene, what can compare with
                     the love of a woman? Though, in the Bible, there is a love spoken of as passing
                     the love of woman. Strong indeed is the figure! Therefore, my sweet girl,
                     should woman love God first, best. Doing this, she has something upon which to
                     lean, should earthly support fail." I held her in my arms for a few moments. I
                     noticed she was very feverish. Nor would she rest there, but disengaging
                     herself from me, she sat up for a few moments, and then arranging some pillows
                     against the foot of the bed, she leaned against them.</p>
                  <p>"Death," said Irene, after a pause. "What is death? Oh! I know I am immortal.
                     But <emph>where</emph> will my spirit live? Is it an actual place, this
                     mysterious abode? Will we know? will we be known? These thoughts are often
                     wearisome to me. I seem to be grasping a shadow that goes from me, or listening
                     to a voice that comes, I know not whence, or, as dreaming, seeing alight that
                     turns to darkness. I wish I could know of the future. <q>

                  <p>"You cannot <emph>now</emph>, Irene," I said,"beyond what God has revealed to
                     us in the Bible. You believe in that Holy Book?"</p>
                  <p>"Oh! yes," she said, though with some hesitation, "and I used to think as my
                     mother did<pb n="148-149" xml:id="VAC6361-00000075"/> about Christ, and heaven,
                     and hell. But many of the spiritualists believe as my father does, only in a
                     natural religion, or natural science. And they say that had God (if indeed
                     there is a God) been what the Bible represents him, a God merciful to his
                     creatures, then the good on earth would not be so tried. Look at my mother's
                     trials! and, oh! how good she was."</p>
                  <p>"My dear Irene!" I said,"into what hands you have fallen!"</p>
                  <p>"Hush! let me tell you how my sister came to me at the moment of her death. I
                     knew she was sick, and I wanted to go to her, but my father had not sent for
                     me, and Mrs. Searle was sure that he would have done so, had Margaret been
                     really ill. I <emph>knew</emph> it was true; a voice from within told me so. I
                     sat, thinking of her and my mother; and Mrs. Searle was talking to me, but I
                     did not understand a word that she said, for I was thinking too deeply of them,
                     of myself too; of what was gone, and of what might come. But I did not dream
                     Margaret could die; oh! no, I only thought she was ill and suffering, and I
                     wanted to be with her, and to nurse her, as our mother would have done. I
                     determined to try and wait patiently until the morning, when I might hear. But,
                     soon I felt about me a motion like the fluttering of flowers in the faintest
                     breeze, and the angelic child was there, radiant, in her new life, in all the
                     purity and glory of the celestial nature that she had just assumed; indeed I
                     saw her, and she spoke to me in sweet accents, and told me to go home.</p>
                  <p>"Mrs. Searle would not believe me when I told her of it, but she took me home,
                     and there, in a coffin, lay the poor empty shell that had once contained a
                     pearl so precious. Now she is often with me—at this moment I see her—she
                     beckons me—oh God! she calls me."</p>
                  <p>"Irene! my child, hush; oh! try and calm yourself to sleep."</p>
                  <p>She would not let me touch her, but sprang up and commenced walking rapidly
                     through the room; I could not persuade her to lie down again. Her condition,
                     her appearance, was frightful. Such brilliant eyes, such burning cheeks and
                     lips I never saw. She talked to some spirit that she fancied was there, and
                     every instant she grew worse. At one moment she laughed, at another she wept. I
                     thought to go for Mrs. Searle, but she saw my intentions, and springing to the
                     door, she said no one should come in. I made the greatest effort to conceal my
                     fears that the crisis had come.</p>
                  <p>It was here! Irene was a maniac before me. And yet how glorious was the fair
                     temple in its fallen state! Never had she looked so splendidly as now. Over her
                     night-dress her long black hair hung, almost to her feet. It waved about her
                     arms and<pb n="150-151" xml:id="VAC6361-00000076"/> shoulders in heavy locks.
                     Her skin so fair, save where the flush of fever dwelt. The beauty of her
                     features, the grace of every gesture!</p>
                  <p>I had lowered the gas when we laid down. Irene raised it to its greatest
                     height, and lit all the burners of the chandelier, in spite of my entreaties;
                     she said she could not see her friends by so dim a light.</p>
                  <p>Presently I succeeded in getting to the door, and hastening to Mrs. Searle's
                     room, I awoke her; always anxious about Irene, she immediately understood, and
                     threw on her dressing gown. I could not persuade myself to go back to Irene
                     without her, so alarmed had I become.</p>
                  <p>Already her screams had been heard in the near rooms, and persons were looking
                     in the hall to inquire the cause.</p>
                  <p>Seeing us approaching, Irene waved us away, and then passing us suddenly, she
                     flew from the room; we followed her, and when I called her, she stopped, but
                     did not seem to know who was calling her.</p>
                  <p>Mrs. Searle had knocked at the Professor's door in passing; he was up and was
                     dressing; he heard the first melancholy cry and recognized the voice; he came
                     from his chamber, and, at a glance, saw it all.</p>
                  <p>"Merciful God!" he exclaimed, "is it so? Irene! my child, my child!" the voice
                     once so dear roused her to a frenzy. I will draw the curtain over this sad
                     scene.</p>
                  <p>In a few days, we took her to Hartford; I cannot tell the mournful details. Her
                     refusal of food, her dislike to us all, her constantly addressing some unseen
                     visitors, her affecting appeals to her dead mother—to her living father.</p>
                  <p>Where was he? He should have been there to see the wreck his unforgiving heart
                     had helped to make.</p>

                  <p>IS she dead?</p>
                  <p>Hers is a living death; a grave where there is no peace, no repose.</p>
                  <p>It has been a year since we placed her in the asylum. Her father came home, but
                     he has never had courage to see her; he bears up, a friend says, with the pride
                     of a philosopher.</p>
                  <p>God help him. I know there is a worm at his heart, a never-dying worm. And he
                     writhes with his sorrow, and thinks that fate deals hardly with him. Yet he
                     closed his heart against his own child. "Oh, man, how often dost thou complain
                     of overshadowing grief, and of darkness resting upon thy days! And yet what
                     cause for complaint, unless, indeed, thou hast failed to learn wisdom from
                     suffering."</p>
                  <p>He failed to learn.</p>
                  <p>Mrs. Searle and I went several times to see Irene during a recent visit of mine
                     to the North. She did not know us, and told us to go away. No one sees her now
                     but those who have charge of her.</p>
                  <p>The last time we went, we were walking through the hall of the asylum,
                     lingering near that part of the house where Irene was. She had been removed
                     where those were whose disease had assumed hopeless symptoms. Mrs. Searle
                     begged the doctor to let her see once more her adopted child; he kindly but
                     firmly refused, reminding her of the last sad scene that transpired when we
                     were admitted to her presence.</p>
                  <p>"Show me her room then," said Mrs. Searle, weeping.</p>
                  <p>"There, with those bars and the closed curtains?"</p>
                  <p>"Why not raise the curtains?" said Mrs. Searle. "Her room must be gloomy and
                     dark; my beautiful Irene cannot live in a prison. Why have you darkened the
                     window?"</p>
                  <p>The doctor hesitated; but as Mrs. Searle persisted in her questions, he said,
                     "Dear madam, her case is the saddest in this prison-house for erring reason.
                     She cannot bear the sight of a fellow-creature; if that curtain were raised,
                     and any one were to cross the yard, the sight would distract her. Would you go
                     to her now, and destroy the only hope of her improvement?"</p>
                  <pb n="154-155" xml:id="VAC6361-00000078"/>
                  <p>"Do you see improvement? <emph>Can't</emph> you give me hope?"</p>
                  <p>"We <emph>must</emph> hope," the physician said; "it is most afflicting to me
                     when I cannot say all I would wish. When Miss Hamilton's father is here; when I
                     look at his stern, pale face, I feel I would give all that I own to be able to
                     say she is better; and, madam, when I hear of the 'circles' of the
                     Spiritualists, I long to bring those people here, to show them the ruins of
                     fair persons and of noble minds, to tell them to hear the shrieks of the spirit
                     mad, to look at their own work. I have no patient over whom I have grieved so
                     much as your adopted daughter; her loveliness; her touching language in the now
                     short intervals of calmness; the fading of her beauty; the loss of the color in
                     her cheek; the black shadows underneath her eyes—used as I am to sad sights, I
                     never leave her without a tear."</p>
                  <p>This was my last visit to Irene, and I learn from Mrs. Searle there is no
                     improvement. Her grief is very great. Ah, she took the Bible from the hands of
                     the child so sacredly committed to her care! Does she think of
                        <emph>that</emph> now?</p>
                  <p>For Irene I must, I will hope. Her mother's prayers—they are not lost. Oh, may
                     her reason return, however feebly, however faintly! if it only be for a moment,
                     that she may look up to the Cross. Those eyes, so glorious once, but dimming
                     now, could they but close forever while gazing upon it. Then <emph>the
                        world</emph> having failed her in the hour of need, how sweetly upon her
                     soul would steal the revelation of infinite love!</p>
                  <p>What may we learn from her sad history? The human mind must submit to the
                     limits that God has imposed upon it here. Do we desire to penetrate the great
                     mystery, Death?</p>
                  <p>Let us know Him who said, "I am the resurrection and the life."</p>
                  <milestone n="*   *   *   *   *" unit="typography"/>
                  <p>These dreams of the night, these waking dreams that come when the day's toil is
                     past. To me, at this hour, meditation is at once a necessity and a delight. I
                     cast away the remembrance of the duties and the cares that have occupied me;
                     there is a little time I call my own. There is nothing that my hands may find
                     to do; I fold them for a pleasant idleness, as I establish myself in the
                     arm-chair. I like the stillness and the solitude. There is no one with me but
                     my sleeping children; no eye, save that of the All-seeing, watches me.</p>
                  <p>Now, fancy ranges unbounded and uncontrolled; she revels, she sports, she
                     broods gloomily at her will! She conjures up phantoms that are not altogether
                     visionary, for some of them memory inspires with life. Now, imagination takes
                     wing; she flies to scenes far away; she brings before me the long<pb
                        n="156-157" xml:id="VAC6361-00000079"/> absent; she cheats me by the
                     remembrance of a voice, a look, a touch of the hand; the hope of reunion, under
                     her influence, becomes a certainty, and I dash away the tears that have
                     gathered at the recalling of a parting hour.</p>
                  <p>I meditate on death, on life, on the conventional requirements of society, on
                     the heartless forms and pleasures of fashionable life. Strangely appear the
                     doings of the world when here, so calmly, I muse upon them. I laugh when I
                     might well weep over the follies that are every day enacted. I close my eyes,
                     and the forms of my friends pass before me, as on a stage, each acting his or
                     her part in the passing scene. This world—I cannot penetrate its mysteries.
                     Well might Carlyle say, "it abounds in miraculous combinations, far
                     transcending anything they do at Drury Lane in the melo-dramatic way. A world
                     which, as solid as it looks, is made all of aerial, and even of spiritual
                     stuff."</p>
                  <p>Irene! most sadly my thoughts have taken form and turned to you, tracing out
                     your history. What is it but a reverie of the night? You stand before me
                     arrayed in melancholy beauty; I almost see you as I look towards the open door,
                     without which is only darkness. You speak to me, as from a living tomb, in
                     accents most mournful to hear. Yet are you the child of many prayers, and in
                     the ark of God's mercy you may be safe.</p>

                  <p>WE were talking this evening of Grace Darling, and of other heroines, and I
                     said that heroines were much more plenty than the world thought. The general
                     impression is that romance is only to be found in novels, but there is a great
                     deal of it in real life. There are many people that I know, whose lives have
                     been full of romance, and for one, there is Addie Carroll. And if it will be a
                     satisfaction to any of my readers to be assured of the truth of what I am
                     telling them, I assure them <emph>it is true</emph>. I have not exaggerated
                     more than authors are expected to exaggerate. I have colored a little, I'll
                     allow, but not more than Mrs. Bailey does—the pretty widow. The only difference
                     is, that I use ink, and she prefers imitating nature, and uses red, or as the
                     French translate it—rouge.</p>
                  <p>Not that I think unkindly of my friends as I sit here at night alone. Oh, no!
                     nor do I wish to be<pb n="160-161" xml:id="VAC6361-00000081"/> considered as
                     finding fault with Mrs. Bailey. Who will blame a woman for looking as well as
                     she can, especially a widow!</p>
                  <p>The great fault of the present system of education is, it seems to me, that it
                     teaches a woman to care for nothing but how she looks in the eyes of the world.
                     What will Mrs. Washington Potts say? is the true translation of every circular
                     that is issued now-a-days by the schools? And this brings me at once to my
                     heroine, who was brought up to love the world with all her heart, and her
                     neighbors (foreigners) as herself. There was a golden rule, too, that she heard
                     about very often, but the amount of it was, that money was the thing most to be
                     desired (after a title). Strange principles to hold in American society!</p>
                  <p>As regards the early life of my heroine, it will be enough for me to say, that
                     she was born in—The World, and brought up in The World. It was her privilege to
                     be the daughter of a mother who would have sacrificed anything and everything
                     to fashion. Her ideas were not far astray of the Georgian and Circassian slave
                     trade; all that a woman's beauty or charms were worth, was to secure a high bid
                     for her when the season came. As to love, Mrs. Carroll does not believe in it;
                     says it is all stuff! The prominent idea of marriage, with her, is, a four
                     story house, Persian carpets, and a carriage. These secured, a woman has
                     accomplished the object of her creation.</p>
                  <p>Nor was Addie the only one upon whom her mother might experiment, for Mrs.
                     Carroll had eight daughters. Eight grown-up, handsome, intelligent, well
                     educated, and accomplished daughters. I say Mrs. Carroll, for Mr. Carroll, a
                     mild, quiet person, cut an unimportant figure in his own house, or rather, he
                     cut no figure at all. He was of small account, farther than to go to market,
                     and to pay the grocery bill. Mrs. Carroll was master and mistress, and she was
                     very notable and an excellent manager. A real woman of the world she was (and
                     is), and though there was a church opposite her front door, and two others in
                     the same square, she thought no more of the <emph>other</emph> world than if
                     she had been born and brought up on the banks of the Ganges.</p>
                  <p>But, though a most excellent manager, in things of <emph>this</emph> world,
                     Mrs. Carroll had not yet <emph>managed</emph> to get one of her eight daughters
                     off her hands. How was this? had she not given them every advantage? Did not
                     each one know a little of everything? a smattering of botany, philosophy,
                     mathematics, and Latin. Could they not speak French, one and all? Was there one
                     of the eight that did not play polkas to perfection? Could they not all dance
                     and waltz<pb n="162-163" xml:id="VAC6361-00000082"/> like fairies, and courtesy
                     killingly? Who could make preserves and pickles, and purses, and cake, and
                     dresses, and jellies, better than they! Were they not all <foreign
                        xml:lang="FRA">au fait</foreign> to the useful and ornamental in life?
                     trained to be capital wives for rich men—or for men not rich; for a bachelor
                     president—or widower, his private secretary, a senator, a member, foreign
                     minister, attache, army man, or passed middy, doctor, lawyer, clerk, or any
                     such that fate might send along?</p>
                  <p>And how had Mrs. Carroll toiled for this! how had she economized, to dress
                     eight daughters elegantly on a small income; and, besides being dressed, they
                     had to be fed; and then the servants' wages, and fifty other things, all out of
                     two thousand a year. How she had turned and twisted dresses and mantillas by
                     day, to keep up appearances, and, poor woman! how had she turned and twisted
                     herself at night, unable to sleep, her brain excited, yet wearied out with
                     useless planning and cogitating.</p>
                  <p>All to no purpose! Sophie, and Maria, and Lizzy, Carry, Jane, and Addie,
                     Florence, and Emily, were all at home beauless and fading; eight as pretty,
                     useful, good tempered women, as you would wish to meet with; the youngest still
                     fresh and blooming, the eldest, sadly passée.</p>
                  <p>What was the secret of it? all the world said; what does it mean? eight such
                     nice, good girls, with handsome eyes, fine teeth, and excellent
                     dispositions;—why don't they marry? women of good family, stylish in their
                     manners, unexceptionable in their deportment, habituées of receptions,
                     matinées, and assemblies, and constant attendants at church. Why don't the men
                     propose? said the world. And this was the very question that Sophie, and Maria,
                     and Lizzy, asked themselves continually. The very question that Mrs. Carroll
                     asked herself every evening, as she looked around on her pretty, graceful
                     daughters. The very question that the men themselves asked, as they took their
                     hats and bowed themselves out of the society of these eight handsome women—I
                     may say nine—for Mrs. Carroll was as pretty as any of her daughters, and what
                     was surprising, considering the wear and tear of fashionable life, she looked
                     almost as young as any of them.</p>
                  <p>For, it is a wear and tear, to live in a large city, to belong to a fashionable
                     clique, and to keep up appearances on next to nothing. Deliver me from genteel
                     poverty! it is one of the curses of society. Think of the money it took to
                     provide becoming morning dresses for eight young women; to furnish materials
                     for their skirts (these they always embroidered themselves); to buy their
                     slippers (that they were forever covering with their old party-dresses); to
                     stocking their pretty feet; to purchase dresses of<pb n="164-165"
                        xml:id="VAC6361-00000083"/> silk, and lawn, and barège. Oh, the bills for
                     pomatum and gaiter boots! for tarleton, and sashes, and French flowers! for
                     bracelets and hair-pins! for hack hire and Cologne water! Oh, the money that it
                     took to go to the springs, to call back the bloom that was paling in those
                     sixteen cheeks! Then, it was continually, visiting cards, and bouquets, and new
                     music, and bonnets, and opera cloaks; and the thousand and one follies that
                     city girls must have, or they lose caste, and may possibly fall, wretched
                     victims! into the second best society. Life was a real treadmill to Mrs.
                     Carroll; she was always on the go, shopping at cheap stores, beating down
                     merchants, or their prices, promising to discharge debts, and adding to those
                     that never could be discharged. Do you not pity her? I would rather be a
                     factory girl making cotton forever; a common-school teacher, feruling the
                     badness out and the new ideas into the heads of her victims; a little Southern
                     negro, having her ears boxed fifteen times a day, than to be in bondage to the
                     world, ashamed of a poverty that all the turning and cleaning of silk dresses,
                     and dyeing of merinos in creation, will never hide; a bondage that makes a
                     woman strive to look as well, or <emph>as fine</emph> with her dollar, as her
                     friend looks with her million; a bondage that brings with it anxiety and debt;
                     and, debt in such a case, is dishonesty.</p>
                  <p>"I'll tell you the secret of their not marrying," said Mary Gardner, as we were
                     one evening discussing the Carrolls. "They are all so pretty and so good, so
                     clever and so much alike, that when a gentleman is pleased with one, he is
                     pleased with all, and he does not know which to decide upon. There's Tom," she
                     continued, looking archly at a young gentleman near her, and to whom she was
                     engaged to be married. "Tom was in love with Addie, and then he thought Carry
                     pleased him the most; but he was not sure but what Sophie suited him best, so
                     he could not make up his mind. You ought certainly to have taken one of them,
                     Tom, after paying them so much attention."</p>
                  <p>"It was your fault," said he, quietly; at which we all laughed, for Tom was a
                     handsome fellow, just home from a four years' cruise. At first, he was every
                     night at the Carrolls', until—so every one in the neighborhood said—until Mary
                     Gardner drew him off. However this may be, it is certain that Tom Merchant
                     offered Mary Gardner his hand and heart, and half-pay, dead or alive; all that
                     most sailors can offer, and most women are glad enough to accept it, too.</p>
                  <p>"<emph>I'll</emph> tell you how it is about those Carrolls," said Mrs. General
                     Clarke; "the men have become so thoroughly selfish now-a-days, they talk about
                     a girl's paying her own mess bill. Their cigars and their sherry cobblers cost
                     so much that they can't<pb n="166-167" xml:id="VAC6361-00000084"/> afford to
                     marry for love. Though it does require a good deal of courage to marry a woman
                     with seven sisters. I declare it looks like Mormonism, and so many queer things
                     are happening every day that it might end in it. If he marry one, something
                     might turn up that he would feel obliged to marry all, and perhaps the mother
                     into the bargain, if poor old Mr. Carroll should give out suddenly. But, to
                     speak seriously, those girls are to be pitied. What would they do if their
                     father should die to-morrow? He would leave them nothing but debts, which his
                     wife has incurred; and they are all refined, and several of them are
                     intellectual women, accustomed to such indulgences, too, as only the very rich
                     should enjoy. What <emph>will</emph> they do when left to themselves, with
                     their proud notions and expensive habits?"</p>
                  <p>"If I were one of them," said Mary Gardner, "I would emigrate."</p>
                  <p>"Where to?" said Tom, whose voice was heard from out of the general laugh. "To
                     Australia?"</p>
                  <p>"To St. Paul's, Minnesota," said Mary, again. "I'd be taken with a missionary
                     fit, and I'd go to Miss Somebody, and tell her I was dreadfully anxious about
                     the souls of the little heathens within our own shores, and I'd get my expenses
                     paid out by the society that she and Dr. Somebody else started. I'd have to
                     engage to teach for two years, of course; but as soon as I got out there, I'd
                     set my cap for a young doctor, who had come there to make a start, and I'd
                     marry the doctor, <foreign xml:lang="FRA">malgré lui</foreign>, and then the
                     little heathens might look out for themselves."</p>
                  <p>"A very nice scheme," said Mrs. General; "but how can it be carried into
                     execution?"</p>
                  <p>"A friend of mine could tell you," said Mary; "she went out to Missouri to
                     teach for two years, and in six months fell in love and married. She is living
                     comfortably now on a fine farm. I dare say she feels a little conscientious
                     about the travelling expenses."</p>
                  <p>How strange, that at this very time Addie Carroll was trying to get up courage
                     to tell her mother that she minded to cut loose from the old ship, and venture
                     out in her little canoe on the great river of life; and what suggested this
                     figure was the fact that she had fallen in with Miss Simpson, when the latter,
                     in one of her forays into the southern country, axe in hand, to uproot the sins
                     of a slave-holding soil, had discoursed eloquently on this project of hers,
                     winning Addie's heart so completely that she volunteered her services, and was
                     received, so to speak, into the regiment of maidens who were to enlighten the
                     benighted condition of the poor heathen children (and bachelors). Addie was
                     excessively smitten with Miss Simpson, and with her plans, and could not rest
                     until her affairs were entirely settled. She was<pb n="168-169"
                        xml:id="VAC6361-00000085"/> to be stationed at the famous St. Paul, that, a
                     few years ago, consisted of three tenements—a drinking shop, a Romish chapel
                     (in the style of a wood-shed), and a pig-sty, but has since swelled into a
                     great and fair city, built on the hills, with the giant river rolling at her
                     feet, with churches innumerable towering towards the brilliant skies that hover
                     over the flowery prairies and lingering snows of the northwest.</p>

                  <p>HOW did it come about that Addie Carroll thought of helping herself? Is there
                     anything that a woman does not think about, especially a quiet woman and one
                     that is inclined to be pale? Is there, I ask, anything dreamed of, in or out of
                     philosophy, that does not glance before a woman's mental vision at one time or
                     another? I mean a true woman, out of whose heart the world has not crushed all
                     that is fresh and noble. But that idea of independence, of self-exertion—how
                     could it have got into her head or heart? Educated by her mother to bow, and
                     bend, and cringe to the favor of the world, how did the notion of supporting
                     herself set all these aside? Oh! there are strange things, "shy secrets," in a
                     woman's nature, and who can say what will <emph>not</emph> happen! I have
                     walked on those prairies whose unsurveyed domains had found a place in Addie's
                     thoughts, and I have looked to the north, to the south, to the east, and to the
                     west, and there was only snow. Only<pb n="170-171" xml:id="VAC6361-00000086"/>
                     snow, though the voice of spring was calling over the dazzling crust, whose
                     crystals were glittering in the sun. I have followed the beaten path, asking
                     myself, when will the grass come and the flowers? and then I laughed at my
                     folly in thinking of grass and flowers when there was nothing to be seen but
                     the winter's snow. And lo! at my feet, a delicate blue chalice has found for
                     itself a way to look up to God; then, I take courage to hope for the summer,
                     amid all the surrounding desolation. So in the heart of woman, there may be a
                     faith, a beauty, a glory, that the world, its dictates, its threats, or its
                     promises, may never hide, or if indeed covered for the while, will work itself
                     through when the time comes.</p>
                  <p>The time came to Addie Carroll, who was indeed the diamond among the jewels
                     that were flashing in vain, lost in each other's light. She had an energy, a
                     will, a moral courage that had slumbered, the more vigorously to act when
                     awakened. And what called it forth?</p>
                  <p>What is it that causes that ocean wave to lash, and sweep beneath it every
                     opposing obstacle? What is it that raises to a mountain height the desert sand,
                     driving its fiery course over man and beast, and leaving them buried without a
                     mark? What makes the winds roar, as with fury, and hurl from the mountain
                     summits, rocks that are lost in the darkness and immensity of the chasm
                     beneath? I hear you answer, God! And God speaks to a woman's heart, and it
                     hears, and nerves itself to undertake things both small and great. God spoke to
                     Addie Carroll's heart.</p>
                  <p>But is God in the fashionable world? Will he dwell amid the pomp, and strife,
                     and folly of those who call themselves the aristocrats of society? Is he not
                     far from such as they? Hush! hush! God is everywhere. His temple may be the
                     heart of a king or of a poor slave, and he abides with the rich as with the
                     poor. He would come to us all would we receive him. But too often we say, "Give
                     me my portion now." And God spoke to Addie Carroll's heart; gently, but as
                     plainly as when he called to little Samuel. At first, an angel might have
                     spoken, but if so, God gave that angel its commission, and it passed to the
                     earth through the clouds, and over the arch of the rainbow, and descended
                     noiselessly, entering the house that, as yet, had neither welcomed nor desired
                     an angel guest. But this one, though uninvited, was, oh! how welcome! for
                     beneath that roof there was one poor child of fashion that longed to flee away
                     and be at rest. She was weary of the formal dinner, the soiree, the ball, the
                     noisy revelry of the life she led. Her soul said, "I have no pleasure in them."
                     She knew not of the presence of that great witness of God in the soul—that
                     thirst that the world only fevers, but can never allay. But it<pb n="172-173"
                        xml:id="VAC6361-00000087"/> was there. She drank—but she thirsted again. She
                     had not thought of the gift of God—the living water. Oh! the world! the world!
                     Oh! the brows, aching though crowned with flowers! the bosoms heavily heaving
                     beneath their jewelled bouquets! the souls seeking to hide under a false glare
                     their sepulchral darkness. Oh! the arrows that are planted in the heart!
                     crushed aspirations, hopeless love, remorse, despair! The world! old man! what
                     has it done for thee, with thy trembling hand, shuffling those painted cards,
                     or holding to thy withered lips the intoxicating cup? Fair woman! what has the
                     world done for thee? paralyzed the sweet emotions of thy nature, and placed a
                     wall, unyielding, though unseen, between thee and thy God? Youth! oh! what
                     holds the world in its hand as it beckons thee to follow? Only the sorrows that
                     shall entangle thy feet, when thou shalt give it thy heart! Reflect before
                     taking another step. As yet thou art pure! thou hast not fallen! turn again ere
                     choosing that broad path towards which so many press!</p>
                  <p>Full of such thoughts was Addie's mind, as nightly she made one of some crowded
                     scene of pleasure, and her pride revolted at being dragged from place to place,
                     her hair adorned, showing to the best advantage; her fair shoulders displayed,
                     her graces paraded off, to catch a husband! She pitied her oldest sisters who
                     were wearied and jaded with their aimless life—but who were now unfitted for
                     any other. Still more, she pitied her young sisters who had the same road to go
                     over, with no cheering certainty as a reward for the fatigue and anxiety they
                     might undergo. She felt almost indignant that <emph>she</emph> should be
                     trotted out, night after night, in hopes of a <emph>good bid</emph>. Yet, her
                     mother's anxiety to see some of them married seemed perfectly natural and
                     excusable. For what, she asked herself, can we helpless women do when left
                     dependent on the world? too proud are we to work, too poor to live. She almost
                     laughed at the absurd reality as it presented itself.</p>
                  <p>Such were her first reflections, but better thoughts came after. Her mind, that
                     was naturally devotional, looked over the sea that skirted her land of bondage.
                     And after a little, by an agency invisible to her, a path was made for her to
                     pass over. God held the dangerous waters that they touched her not, while she
                     shook from her wrists the iron chain. He showed her a promised land to which,
                     as a home, she might aspire. He reared for himself within her, a fair temple
                     where his spirit might dwell—amid the strong womanly instincts, the upright
                     sense of honor, the fervent love of nature that he had, at her birth, implanted
                     in her heart. He filled this temple with his own presence. Oh! then Addie
                        <emph>felt</emph> these simple words that the infant lisps—<emph>God made
                        me</emph>. She felt<pb n="174-175" xml:id="VAC6361-00000088"/>
                     <emph>these</emph> words, "I was glad when they said, let us go unto the house
                     of the Lord." She listened as the preacher discussed the animating truths of
                     religion. Before her eyes, was the picture that Mercy saw at the Interpreter's
                     house; the cross glistened above, and Muck-rake grovelled in the earth at her
                     feet. Where should she look? As ever towards the heavens; for the eyes that had
                     all along seen only the crimson pillars of clouds with their glorious tintings
                     of light, saw now a greater brightness beyond, and God was there. She unwound
                     her way from the mazy labyrinth in which she was entangled—it seemed a mystery
                     to her at first, but like the prince of the east she saw "Conquer in this," in
                     the mystic sign, and clasping it to her heart she determined to bear it ever
                     there, though at first her steps almost failed her with weariness, even as His
                     did, toiling up Calvary.</p>
                  <p>For some time there were difficulties in her way. Her mother contended with
                     her, and spoke with contempt of her new notions, and was angry when she refused
                     to lead the life that all around her led. And then the thought came, she would,
                     for a time, separate herself from home, and seek employment that would be
                     independence, eating no longer the bread of idleness and folly. Her heart
                     seconded the motion of her brain. "Up, and be doing," it said to her; "God
                     never tires, never rests. Shall his servants be idle when the harvest time is
                     come."</p>
                  <p>When her plans for action were matured, she talked of them first, to her quiet,
                     but kind and indulgent father. He smiled at what he called her visionary
                     projects, but so often she sought him, that her very earnestness stood her
                     friend. She was his best beloved, for her generous and affectionate impulses
                     drew from him an interest that he could not feel in his other children. Addie
                     and he often wandered in the woods near the city, for Mr. Carroll's only real
                     pleasure seemed to be in taking long walks. He and his daughter loved to look
                     upon the beauties of the heavens and of the earth.</p>
                  <p>"I cannot, dear father," Addie would say, as they wandered on, her arm locked
                     in his—"I cannot bear to see you so bent and worn, depriving yourself even of
                     necessary rest and repose, to give us so many useless indulgences. We are
                     living too, far beyond our income, and I feel that this is not right. We are
                     crushing you to the earth with over-exertion, and some of us should try to do
                     for ourselves. Your day of toil should be over, and each day we are making
                     heavier your burden. Oh! this should not be so! In return for all your love,
                     let me care for myself, for the education that you have given me will enable me
                     to do so. At least I will try, and I shall be most happy if I succeed. If I
                     fail, I shall only<pb n="176-177" xml:id="VAC6361-00000089"/> come back to you,
                     which I shall do, at any rate, after a while. Be my advocate with my mother,
                     and help to persuade her to allow me to go to the West. Here I am useless, for
                     were I to die to-morrow, except as far as affection is concerned, no one would
                     miss me, and I am persuaded that God never made man or woman but that he or she
                     might aid in working out his benevolent purposes."</p>
                  <p>Mr. Carroll referred his daughter to her mother, venturing a word in her favor,
                     but each received tears and reproaches for answer. When Mrs. Carroll understood
                     Addie's wishes and views, she refused to allow her to go, and Addie felt that
                     for the present she must give up, for obedience to her parents, where it did
                     not interfere with obedience to her God, was her first earthly duty.</p>
                  <p>But when Mrs. Carroll heard all—how her favorite and loveliest daughter felt
                     obliged to refuse gay society—intending to connect herself by a public
                     profession with the church, and not formally, but with a firm resolve to act up
                     to its requirements, by renouncing the world—her anger became grief and
                     mortification. Some time passed in frequent discussion, and she found her
                     daughter could not, and would not agree to spend all her time in the trifling
                     routine of fashionable engagements. She was dismayed at the scandal that would
                     be the inevitable result of the world's knowledge of her family affairs. Her
                     authority would seem to have been set aside, and her child would be denounced
                     as a Methodist. This was too much for her to bear; she consented to be
                     separated from her, believing that Addie's religious opinions were from the
                     excitement of the day, and that they would pass away as quietly as they had
                     approached. She even assisted her to prepare for her trip to the West, hoping
                     she would soon return cured of her folly, and ready to enter, with a new zest,
                     into the game of life, where women play for the one stake—an establishment. And
                     Addie moved quietly about, with a brave heart, looking forward towards the
                     unknown wilds, feeling that the worst was over when her mother's consent to her
                     project was obtained.</p>
                  <p>Is it a little thing to come out from the world? to brave its censure—to bear
                     its scorn—to hear its slighting laugh—to see its long finger, in derision,
                     pointed to your face? Oh no! when a woman breaks down the bars of
                     conventionalism, that society has put up, to shut her out from energy, from
                     hope—from all that is good, from God! when she does thus, she is a heroine. She
                     is stronger than one who could bear on his shoulders the huge gates of a city,
                     and braver than he who would rush singly to oppose ten enemies, armed with
                     weapons more deadly than his own. And Addie, though still young, was tired of
                     the world—tired of its glitter and its noise,<pb n="178-179"
                        xml:id="VAC6361-00000090"/> tired of the flashing of jewels and the rolling
                     of carriages. She knew there was no real happiness in all this. Perhaps, she
                     said to herself, there is <emph>no happiness</emph> in this world; she did not
                     aspire to it, but her words might have been, "Let a passionless peace be my
                     lot."</p>
                  <p>Sorrow was to come first; bitter tears were to be shed at the parting from
                     home; a bosom was to rise and fall with sobs, when the last look faded away.
                     Poor child! for the time all hope—all desire fled. Yet the railroad car flew
                     with its burden of anxious souls, and the changing scenes through which she was
                     so swiftly borne, amused her mind. There were pleasant travelling companions
                     who laughed at her gloom, and tried to chase it away. Gradually it parted like
                     the mists, when the sun advances towards them. On the cars whirled, and before
                     many days the broad river, with its waves like the sea, lay before her. It was
                     a pleasant sight, and as she looked upon it, that saddest of all
                     sicknesses—homesickness—was forgotten. Addie saw, towering, the hills of her
                     new home, and her heart bounded as she thought that here she might not live in
                     vain.</p>
                  <p>Let whoever reads this, remember that seven years ago, when Addie Carroll
                     landed at St. Paul's, St. Paul's was not what it is now. There were not then
                     such churches and school-houses. Oh! I wish you could have seen the school-room
                     into which Addie was introduced the day after her arrival. The ardor of the
                     young missionary was damped. But I ought not to call her by such a name. She
                     did not claim it. She would not have gone to Africa on any account, and Africa
                     is the test, to try a missionary spirit. Addie wanted, in plain English, to
                     work for her living; but she prayed to be made useful in her sphere. Perhaps I
                     should call her an adventurer.</p>
                  <p>If, then, you could have seen the young adventurer, her school-room, and her
                     scholars, when they were first introduced to each other. As to the room, it was
                     a horrid fixture, the boards tumbling down, and half plastered. In it there
                     were a chair for Addie and some benches for her pupils. The door opened right
                     into the street, and when it was shut, the pigs, expert from long habit, thrust
                     it apart with their noses, and, effecting an entrance, were often ejected with
                     trouble.</p>
                  <p>For the pupils, Addie commenced with ten, and in a fortnight there were twenty,
                     such as they were. One or two of them were the children of Christians, but the
                     rest were the representatives of all the heathen and barbaric tribes that the
                     great American continent can present. Some of them were Gumboes (a mixture of
                     French and Indian); then, there were those who had white fathers and Sioux
                     mothers, and negro grandfathers and Winnebago grandmothers.<pb n="180-181"
                        xml:id="VAC6361-00000091"/> No doubt it could be done, if our literati had
                     proper materials to work upon, but it would be a tough job to trace these young
                     ones back to Adam and Eve; and any of the strongest advocates of the unity of
                     the race who may be induced to attempt this job, should choose the coolest
                     weather, for he will have warm work, and never will accomplish it
                     satisfactorily to himself or to anybody else; not but the unity of the race is
                     a fact beyond the power of man or angel to disprove, but in this case it would
                     be difficult to trace the succession.</p>
                  <p>But there would be no trouble about Addie. She could be traced straight up to
                     Eve; her fair skin, brown eyes, and browner hair, spoke better things than
                     history. She might have been taken for Eve herself, had she been seated in a
                     beauteous garden listening to some Adam's Miltonic speeches. As it was, she was
                     a contrast to her dingy complexioned scholars. Such a looking set as they were,
                     with their piercing black eyes, and long, straight, uncombed hair, big mouths,
                     and dirty hands. Poor Addie! she used to beg them, with tears, to go home and
                     wash their faces, and she shrunk from the touch of their hands. For a long
                     time, she would often put her fingers in her ears to shut out their jargon, a
                     mixture of English, and Indian, and French; while the only words that she could
                     at all understand were such words as never should be uttered or heard. She was
                     immensely disgusted; there is no use in denying it, and she was often homesick,
                     and would shed great tears on her cotton pillow-case. Oh! how disheartened she
                     became, but she would not give up. She would never go home and say, I have
                     failed. So she labored on.</p>
                  <p>The loss of society was a great loss to her, fitted by habit and by education
                     to enjoy it. It was hard to be so frequently thrown among coarse and ignorant
                     people; she shrunk from the association. But were they worse than many who were
                     received with smiles by her mother? men broken down by dissipation, unfit to
                     enter the presence of those who overlooked their sins for their money or
                     position. Often, too, she felt the want of recreation; but at home, had she
                     wearied less of the eternal round of visiting and gayety, where she was hawked
                     about, ticketed like Ethel Newcombe, For Sale. Addie wiped away her tears when
                     she thought of that; indeed, she had better use to which she might put her fine
                     eyes, than crying.</p>
                  <p>From her little windows, the city-bred maiden looked out upon scenes such as
                     she had only read or dreamed about. When her teaching for the day was done, she
                     looked forth upon the new land unto which she had come. Such clouds! such
                     hills! such a glorious river! such trees! and such fair little lakes! It was
                     October when she arrived at St.<pb n="182-183" xml:id="VAC6361-00000092"/>
                     Paul's, and by the time that November was through, her homesickness was
                     effectually cured. That Indian summer in Minnesota! Addie felt that it was
                     worth a great deal to see it, and it did not entirely pass from her; when it
                     bade adieu to nature, there was a sort of Indian summer hue upon her feelings.
                     There was, to be sure, a mazy uncertainty in her prospects; but there was a
                     deep interest in all that was going on around her, that lightened every care,
                     as the red glow brightens up all nature. It was a new life; nothing could be
                     said distinctly of the future, but there was light in the distance, and the
                     hope of success urged her to patience and to energy.</p>
                  <p>The hope of success! in what? Why, in earning her own bread, and in doing
                     something for her fellow-creatures. The winter came, and things looked better.
                     The children began to wash their faces and hands, and to love their beautiful
                     teacher. The little heathens, to please her, tried to speak English, and left
                     off swearing and stealing each other's lunch. Besides, a better class of people
                     were coming in; their children came to school, and their good conduct and
                     studious habits excited others to emulation. There was better behavior—and
                     cleaner hands. The pigs, too, were learning to know their place; they rarely
                     ventured within the precincts of learning, and if so, ran off at the first
                     manifestation of displeasure at their presence. All this was very
                     encouraging.</p>
                  <p>But there were better things still in store for Addie, and for St. Paul's. The
                     meditative girl saw this, and while she hoped for herself, she rejoiced in the
                     certainty that for St. Paul's there was a brilliant future. Small beginnings
                     there were as yet, but there must be no turning back, for St. Paul's was
                     destined to be the great city of the northwest. Addie felt a pride and pleasure
                     in thinking that she was the first female teacher in that city, and that one
                     day, when she should be old, children would point her out as having come when
                     this great city was nothing, and she laughed when she imagined herself an old
                     lady, with a mob cap, walking with a stick.</p>
                  <p>But what right had she to look forward to being in St. Paul's when she should
                     be old? It is not my affair to meddle with any plans that Addie might make for
                     herself, for a woman's thoughts are her own, so that they be good and pure.
                     However, I will say, in all these plans she did not trust entirely to herself,
                     but took the advice of a young lawyer.</p>
                  <p>The two years had passed away for which Addie considered herself pledged to the
                     society that had paid her expenses out, and they had passed pleasantly, too.
                     Such sleigh-rides up the Mississippi, and down the Mississippi, and up the St.
                     Peter's, and down the St. Peter's, as Addie used to have with a young lawyer<pb
                        n="184-185" xml:id="VAC6361-00000093"/> yer, the same that I spoke of as
                     advising her in regard to her future plans, to do which was always very
                     convenient for him, for they boarded in the same house. Such rides! such
                     flights, as I may call them, as they used to have across the prairies in summer
                     in a Boston chaise! and such fishing excursions as they had to the Spirit
                     Lakes! Such walks and talks as they had around and about St. Paul's! The young
                     lawyer was always at hand (as indeed young lawyers always should be), and Addie
                     and he accomplished wonders at St. Paul's. They got up a singing society, that
                     came to be the choir of the Episcopal church, and they put their names to the
                     Temperance Society, and in fact they put their names to everything good that
                     was going on. And while Addie was taking great pride in her flourishing school,
                     and the young lawyer was getting into practice, the city of St. Paul's seemed
                     to be, like Jonah's gourd, springing up in a night, and a pretty cottage was
                     being built on one of the city's highest locations, under the young lawyer's
                     superintendence. And just as the cottage was finished, and the grounds so
                     tastily laid out, Addie left St. Paul's in a steamer, the young lawyer standing
                     on the wharf, and watching the steamer until it was out of sight. Where was our
                     young adventurer going? home. There she arrived safely, and was folded to her
                     father's bosom, and to her mother's, too. She was more beautiful than ever, and
                     looked fresh and blooming as a rosebud among her sisters, who drooped around
                     her. She was tired with her journey, and slept sweetly that night in the old
                     home, to which she had been so affectionately welcomed.</p>
                  <p>The next morning, Mrs. Carroll breakfasted again with her eight daughters, and
                     Mr. Carroll could not look away from his newly-recovered child.</p>
                  <p>"Addie," said Mrs. Carroll, "Count—is here, and he has the most magnificent
                     moustaches! All the girls are dying in love with him, and you must bear away
                     the prize from them. You are so blooming, after your western trip, that I shall
                     expect you to make a great impression upon the count. He is in New York now,
                     but will be back in a month; it is said he has a splendid establishment in
                     Paris, but likes our country so well that he cannot bear to leave it. Oh, I
                     should so like to see one of my daughters a countess!"</p>
                  <p>"I would not be a countess for all the world!" said Addie, "and I am afraid I
                     will not see the count, for I have promised to go back to St. Paul's in three
                     weeks."</p>
                  <p>Mrs. Carroll looked aghast. "Addie," she said, "you shall not go back to teach
                     those horrid little savages."</p>
                  <p>"I do not intend to," said Addie; "I am going"—</p>
                  <p>"What are you going to do?" said her father.</p>
                  <pb n="186-187" xml:id="VAC6361-00000094"/>
                  <p>Addie blushed like a rosebud, and ran out of the room. Her mother followed her,
                     and they had a long talk about the young lawyer. I cannot tell you his name,
                     for he lives in St. Paul's, is a friend of mine, and might not like to see
                     himself so unceremoniously brought before the public. But in a week he was in
                     the same place with Addie, boarding at a hotel not far from her father's house,
                     and visiting them twice a day. And what was very strange, though, indeed, it
                     always happens in love affairs that come to be published, the young lawyer was
                     the son of an old friend of Mr. Carroll's. Everything was just as it ought to
                     be.</p>
                  <p>Mrs. Carroll was delighted with her son-in-law. He was handsome, intelligent,
                     and rich.</p>
                  <p>And Addie is very happy in her cottage that looks over the Mississippi.</p>
                  <p>You ask, what has become of her seven sisters?</p>
                  <p>I answer, I have nothing to do with them; I was writing about heroines.</p>

                  <head type="sub">MORNING VISITING.</head>
                  <p>A MOMENT of retrospection.</p>
                  <p>How have I passed this day? what have I said? what have I done? what have I
                     learned? These hours, that have their place in the eternal record, for, or
                     against me, how have I employed them?</p>
                  <p>Let me recall them, while the minutes fly. Oh! "Time! wait yet another moment,
                     and tell me something worth telling."</p>
                  <p>My day commenced at noon; before then, the dreadful items of housekeeping bound
                     me down with a chain heavier and blacker than ever night fastened about the
                     earth.</p>
                  <p>At noon, <emph>a friend</emph> called to see me; she had so longed for my
                     society; for two months she had determined to find me out, but she had no time;
                     who has any time in fashionable life? At last she had put her good intentions
                     into execution; she had come to me.</p>
                  <p>She swept into the room, trained and hooped.<pb n="188-189"
                        xml:id="VAC6361-00000095"/> Her bonnet was from Paris, the mate to
                     Eugenie's; her gloves were of the softest of rats' skins, and were imported
                     from an establishment, compared with which, Alexander's and Bajon's were not.
                     The express had brought her mantilla from Stewart's, only that morning; her
                     laces and her gaiters were perfect.</p>
                  <p>She was so charmed to see me; she inquired after my little ones, but without
                     permitting me to answer, she said that her darling Bijou had had a severe
                     spell. The dear dog! she could not stay away from him long, so she pressed my
                     hand, and left me. Five precious minutes she had lavished upon me; ought I not
                     to be thankful?</p>
                  <p>The door bell! another friend. <emph>Her</emph> face was sorrowful. She said
                     visiting was a horrid bore, it almost killed her, yet it was a duty; the world
                     had its requirements. She showed me her visiting list and sighed; two hundred
                     friends had claims upon her. She must go, or she would never get through the
                     terrible round.</p>
                  <p>Again the door bell! another friend, another hoop, and another five minutes.
                        <emph>She</emph> said it was necessary for one to keep a position in
                     society; one must visit, or one will be forgotten.</p>
                  <p>"How are you all?" she continued; "what is the news? have you been to the
                     House? think of Rachel's not coming to sing for us, after all! have you heard
                     Mr. Morley preach? has the new milliner made you a dress? have you read Maud?
                     what do you give for turkeys? But, I hear the horses tramping; it reminds me
                     that I am paying a dollar an hour, hack-hire; I <emph>must</emph> go. Oh! this
                     dreadful morning visiting."</p>
                  <p>Again the door bell. Another friend! oh! no, a card; Mrs. Campbell, at home on
                     Tuesday, from two to five.</p>
                  <p>The bell! do I want any oysters?</p>
                  <p>The bell! a beggar with a written demand for five dollars.</p>
                  <p>The bell! the gas bill.</p>
                  <p>The bell! ah! this time, it <emph>is</emph> a friend, and not a five minutes
                     friend. No, indeed! a whole hour friend; one who is pretty and witty; one who
                     loves me; one who hoards pleasant talk, that she may deal it out lavishly when
                     we meet; one who is a little of a gossip, only a little; she cannot help it.
                     She sees droll things, to which others are blind, and she tells them afterwards
                     to me, only to me, and—a few others. But "<emph>she is a woman, and she must
                        speak</emph>." She shows me pebbles from beside the under-current of
                     fashionable life, that she gathers for her own pastime; for, we women must not
                     deny how pleasant to us all is a little gossip; and to some of us, it is like
                     the unrolling of a precious manuscript to Wagner—"all heaven come down."</p>
                  <pb n="190-191" xml:id="VAC6361-00000096"/>
                  <p>Sometimes, when we are together, we wander away to scenes that we have looked
                     upon, so often, that they seem like pictures on our hearts; sometimes, we talk
                     of what others have so well described. She goes with me, in fancy, to the caves
                     of the west, to the fairy isles of the Mississippi. We seat ourselves by the
                     lakes that dot the great prairie, and I tell her what the strange people who
                     have, for ages, camped by these shores, have told me. Or, we walk over the beds
                     of the moccasin flower, and hear, breaking the silence that is about us, the
                     musical tones of the Laughing waters, calling us aside; we descend the path and
                     pass the evergreens to look at her waves, dancing down the rocks and playing on
                     the moss and stones; and I say, that just where we stand, so often some hunter
                     has stood, and, aiming at the deer that stooped to drink in the crystal waters
                     above, his arrow has flown through mist and foam to the heart, whose throbs it
                     went to hush. And here, has many a maiden listened to the voice of love—has
                     many a mother sung—has many a woman wept. And here, did Chequered Cloud, the
                     last prophetess of the Dacotas who will ever recount her legends on this spot,
                     sacred to devotion and romance—here, did she love to tell the traditions of her
                     race, one of which, reader, I will repeat to you.</p>

                  <head>CHAPTER XXVI.</head>
                  <head type="sub">AN EPISODE.</head>
                  <p>THERE is a legend that is often told by the red man's fireside; but say you
                     that the red man has, in truth, no fireside? that he lives with thoughts of
                     death and blood forever about his heart, knowing not the affections that
                     cluster about home—a stranger to the ties and sympathies that soften the
                     existence of the man who has heard the revealed will of God, and is thus gifted
                     with a power of enjoyment that is his alone? You do not understand the goodness
                     of God! The savage has his own peculiar happiness, clouded though it be by a
                     thousand sins. Guided by the voice of conscience (too often deadened to
                     insensibility), he is sometimes careful to follow its teachings, and the noble
                     child of nature is true to the dictates of duty, and keenly alive to the
                     sensibilities with which he has been endowed by a merciful Creator.</p>
                  <p>There is no amusement more cherished among savages than that of recounting the
                     legends and traditions<pb n="192-193" xml:id="VAC6361-00000097"/> ditions of
                     their race. It is more than an amusement, for it is made the channel of warning
                     and instruction—it keeps alive a love of country and a pride of race, a fear of
                     the gods, a reverence for wisdom and old age. Thus are beguiled the long winter
                     nights, when the house of buffalo skin totters with the angry blasts of the
                     wind spirits, whose voices are heard from afar, appalling the tall pines that
                     skirt the village, and ruffling the smooth branches of the evergreens that
                     bear, through the long cold season, on their bosoms, their light burdens of
                     glistening snow.</p>
                  <p>Then, while firelight gleams across the wigwam, lighting up the faces of the
                     sleeping infant and its watching mother; while the pipe is passed from guest to
                     guest with friendly hospitality; while the young, heeding the fierce breathing
                     of the storm spirits without, creep closer to each other, drawing their
                     blankets about their heads to shut out the fearful sound—then will the silence
                     be broken by the voice of some venerable man, who relates to them events, the
                     memory of which infuses again young blood into his chilled and swollen veins,
                     bringing the flash that of old lightened his now dimmed eyes, nerving with
                     steadiness the shrill and broken voice of age. Many a lesson of bravery and
                     wisdom does he inculcate, as he tells them scenes that were written in the
                     history of his heart, but which will be now cherished by his sons and
                     daughters, and thus transmitted, through them, to their children forever.</p>
                  <p>Or, it may be, the sweet breath of summer is playing about the rugged bluffs
                     that guard the banks of the fair Minnesota. Shadows of the still evening are
                     resting on the prairies, and the stars are bending their soft and quiet glances
                     on the young maidens that have collected in some favorite spot, and on the
                     beautiful flowers, that have found their way even to the mossy rocks, and are
                     sleeping on their dangerous sides.</p>
                  <p>Nor are the young alone, listening to the holy voices of nature. The drooping
                     chest, and the feeble step approach—many a warning precept rests on the tongue
                     of the aged wise woman. She seats herself among them, and, for a while, turns
                     from rock to river, and from the star-gemmed heavens to the sea of prairie that
                     extends in immeasurable distance. Her thoughts are busy with the past; memories
                     of the dead crowd around her soul's vision; she sees not the young faces that
                     are collected round her; she hears not the soft and musical chant that is sung
                     in perfect time, blending with the gentle waving of the wild rice, the tranquil
                     breathing of the river, and all the sweet and harmonious "voices of the
                     night."</p>
                  <p>"Tell us the story of the Star-Maidens, Harpstenah," said the Young Dove,
                     placing her round<pb n="194-195" xml:id="VAC6361-00000098"/> hand upon the bony
                     arm of the old woman; "we will remember all your words, as you will so soon go
                     to the city of spirits; it has been a long time since you have talked to us of
                     the two maidens who went to live in the skies."</p>
                  <p>"It is easy to promise," said the old woman sternly, "but when did the young
                     remember the words of the wise and aged? Look at my granddaughter; I bore her
                     in my arms when she was young, though I was then old and feeble. I sang to her
                     lullabies, though my heart was breaking; for her mother's spirit died away with
                     the breath of winter; I closed her bright eyes, and laid her with the white
                     snow in the branches of the trees. I taught my granddaughter to work moccasins,
                     and to stain the sharp quills of the porcupine; day and night I worked for her.
                     I said, when I am old, then will my child remember this; she will marry the
                     brave man that I choose for her, she will take me to her warm lodge, she will
                     feed me and guide me even as I did her, in her tender youth. So she promised
                     me, but she has eaten her words; she will not marry the bravest warrior of his
                     clan, who would bring plenty to her tee-pee, who would speak kind words to her
                     old mother. She is ungrateful and obstinate; she will marry the cruel young man
                     who drinks the white man's fire-water, and who hates me, because I give good
                     advice to my daughter's child. He will tell me to kill my own venison, and to
                     keep away from his lodge. The Singing Bird has forgotten her promise; she is
                     breaking the heart of her aged mother with sorrow, and drying up the blood in
                     her veins."</p>
                  <p>The Singing Bird looked into her grandmother's face, then sadly drooped her
                     beautiful eyes—two tears like pearls trembled on her eyelids, and rested for a
                     moment on her soft cheek; but she made no reply, while the maiden who had first
                     spoken turned to the wise woman again, and said, "Tell us, Harpstenah, the
                     story of the Star-Maidens; the Singing Bird will listen, and grow wise; you
                     will yet sit by the fire of her lodge, with the man you have chosen for her. I
                     wish the Brave Heart had loved me; he is so tall and handsome that any maiden
                     would love him, if her eyes were not blinded by some bad spirit."</p>
                  <p>"Your words are good," answered the old woman; "sometimes wise words fall from
                     the lips of the young, but the Singing Bird is foolish and obstinate."</p>
                  <p>Ah! Harpstenah! you forget the days of your youth. When did Love sit lightly on
                     the throne prepared for him? is he not ever prone to fly to a home of his own
                     choosing? But listen! for Harpstenah speaks, while she raises her arm and
                        points<pb n="196-197" xml:id="VAC6361-00000099"/> with her long finger to
                     two bright stars that are hovering over them.</p>
                  <p>"There they are; the two stars that are now the homes of the maidens who would
                     not listen to the words of the old. My daughter! I will once more relate the
                     legend, and it may be that the Great Spirit will put obedience in your heart,
                     so that you may love me, and may weep by my body, when I go to the house of
                     spirits—for I loved you, and watched over you when you were young and
                     helpless."</p>
                  <p>Harpstenah looked towards the heavens. "Do you see them?" she said, while a
                     multitude of young faces were upturned, following the direction of her gaze—"Do
                     you see them? The large and restless one, and the small and steady one, near
                     by? Spirits are ever abroad when those two stars shine out so brightly; they
                     are around us now—in the waters, in the rocks, in the trees, in the flowers at
                     our feet; but be not afraid, my children! They will not harm the young who are
                     obedient to the words of the aged, though well may the maiden fear whose heart
                     refuses to heed; the spirit of evil is about her, and he will bring sickness
                     and trouble and death to her side." The Singing Bird tremblingly raised again
                     her beautiful eyes to her grandmother's face, but they quickly drooped under
                     that terrible look, and, as before, two tears rested on the soft, pale cheeks,
                     though the maiden spoke not. The wise woman resumed her seat, and drawing her
                     blanket about her, bent her head on her bosom. The young girls did not disturb
                     her meditations; but, at last, sighing deeply, in a quiet tone of voice, she
                     commenced the favorite legend:</p>
                  <p>"Many, many winters ago, there came a young warrior among our people; he was
                     proud and fearless; he wore the dress and spoke the language of the Dacotas,
                     but he spoke other languages too, for when strangers came among us, it was
                     noticed he could talk to them, whether they were enemies taken in battle, or
                     friends come from afar, to eat of our venison, and to warm themselves by our
                     fires.</p>
                  <p>"We could not get him to tell us whence he came; there were those among our
                     people who said he talked to Wakun Tonka; that on dark and stormy nights he
                     would pass from us, and stand on the high hills, listening to the mysterious
                     words of the Father of Spirits; yet he never said how or why he came among
                     us.</p>
                  <p>"We knew it was for good, for he led our young men to battle, and ever brought
                     them home victorious. There were always fresh scalps in our villages; our
                     enemies fell before us, so that we knew the gods had sent him. They called him
                     the Wakun brave; even our oldest and proudest warriors were not ashamed to
                     follow him to battle.</p>
                  <pb n="198-199" xml:id="VAC6361-00000100"/>
                  <p>"Once, a terrible winter lingered with us. The snow drifted, and was piled
                     against our lodges. Our good hunters toiled, but they could not keep their
                     families from want; the snow fell again and again. Our braves went forth with
                     their bows and arrows, but their hands were cold. They had no skill left: their
                     arrows would not fly. They prayed to the Great Spirit, but He would not hear
                     them, so they came to their lodges with sad faces, and when their children
                     cried with hunger, they said, 'The Father of Spirits is angry with us; we must
                     all die. The mallard and teal are gone to the warm South; the buffalo flee from
                     our sight, and we cannot follow them. We will go, my children, to the city of
                     spirits, where we will hunger and die no more.'</p>
                  <p>"Then did the Dacota mothers weep; for can a mother see the babe at her bosom
                     starving, and not weep?</p>
                  <p>"There was stillness in the village that night. Our warriors knew they must
                     die, so they wrapped themselves in their robes and laid them down, to wait
                     until they should hear their names called, in the far-off land of souls.</p>
                  <p>"But where was the Wakun brave? That night he went forth alone, with his bow
                     and arrow in his hand; the Dacotas thought that, like the buffalo, he wanted to
                     die in the woods, where no eye could see the death struggle, so no one
                     questioned him, or said, Where goest thou? as he left the village, singing a
                     song of triumph, even when our bravest men had said, 'There is nothing for us
                     to do but to die.'</p>
                  <p>The long night passed; the stars were going out, and the clouds breaking away,
                     when a merry shout and laugh were heard; our people lifted the doors of their
                     tee-pees to see who could be so happy when the Great Spirit had forsaken His
                     children, and they were to die from cold and hunger.</p>
                  <p>"Ha! the Wakun brave was bounding over the snow-drifted paths of the village,
                     laughing and dragging by its branching horns a fat elk; every step he advanced,
                     marks of its red blood followed him. 'Come out, young men and maidens,' he
                     called; 'we are not to die. Let us leave this elk to the old women and little
                     children, and we will go out and bring in the rest of the game that I shot with
                     my Wakun bow and arrow.'</p>
                  <p>"The warriors came forth, and the maidens quickly followed them. The little
                     children clapped their hands and shouted as the Wakun brave called again, 'Come
                     on! come on!' The very sound of his voice brought strength and courage to the
                     souls of our wearied ones. They went forth with bounding footsteps. Soon they
                     came again with many a deer, with the tender wild pigeon, the mallard and the
                     teal, the buffalo and bear. They ate, and their hearts grew strong; the women
                     dried the buffalo<pb n="200-201" xml:id="VAC6361-00000101"/> meat, and tanned
                     the deer skin. They sang and danced, and wept no more.</p>
                  <p>"All this time, the Wakun brave had no wife. He was gay, and young, and
                     handsome, but he said no words of love. What maiden but sighed when he passed
                     her by, hoping still that he would follow her when she went apart from her
                     companions, and say, 'Come to my lodge, and make it bright?' She hoped in vain;
                     the heart of the Wakun brave was cold and hard as ice—he cared only for his bow
                     and arrow. So feared the Dacota maidens, and they said they would think of him
                     no more.</p>
                  <p>"There was then a great war chief who lived in the same village with the Wakun
                     brave. He had a daughter, young, and good, and beautiful. She was not like a
                     Dacota maiden, but was white and drooping, like the daughters of the pale
                     faces, not one of whose hated race had ever, then, been seen among us. Her eyes
                     were large and soft, and her lips red; there was always a smile resting on her
                     face. Many of the young men had loved her, but she said, 'Leave me with my
                     mother; I am not yet old enough to be a wife.'</p>
                  <p>"This great war chief said to the Wakun brave, 'The Great Spirit sent you among
                     us; we love you, and honor your words, but you are not one of us until you
                     choose a wife from our maidens, and thus show that you will remain with us.
                     When a stranger visits us, we tell him to take from among our daughters a wife,
                     to work for him while he stays with us; this we do to show him honor. You have
                     lived with us, have led us to battle, have saved all our lives; will you not
                     take a wife to your lodge, and be to us as a brother?'</p>
                  <p>"The Wakun brave smiled. 'Give me your daughter,' he said; 'I love her, and
                     will make her happy; call her, and see if she will go with me.'</p>
                  <p>"The war chief called his daughter. 'Will you be the wife of the Wakun brave?'
                     he said. 'He loves you, and would take you to his lodge.'</p>
                  <p>"The face of the maiden lighted up. 'I knew,' she said, 'that it would be so,
                     for a large bear came to me, in my dreams, and said the Wakun brave would one
                     day take me to his lodge. I will be his wife, for has he not saved all our
                     lives? The Dacota maiden will be proud to be the mother of his children, and to
                     keep his lodge warm and clean.'</p>
                  <p>"So she became his wife, and was happy, too. The Wakun brave brought no other
                     to his lodge, and he spoke no angry words. He killed the young deer, and
                     brought it to her. After a while, a daughter was born to them, dark and
                     bright-eyed, like her father, and soon another, white, and soft-eyed, like her
                     mother; and when the braves would say, 'The<pb n="202-203"
                        xml:id="VAC6361-00000102"/> Great Spirit has sent you no son to follow you
                     to battle,' the Wakun brave would reply, 'I am content; my daughters will be
                     good and industrious, like their mother, and will, one day, make some brave men
                     good wives.'</p>
                  <p>"This seemed strange to our warriors," continued Harpstenah, "for we know a
                     Dacota wishes to have many sons; yet the Wakun brave was happy to have
                     daughters only."</p>
                  <milestone n="*   *   *   *   *   *" unit="typography"/>
                  <p>"Will you go to your lodges and sleep, my children?" said Harpstenah; "the moon
                     is rising, and if you say so, I will wait until another time to tell you what
                     befell the Wakun brave and his beautiful wife."</p>
                  <p>"Go on, go on," said the Young Dove. "Go on, go on, good Harpstenah," said they
                     all—all save the Singing Bird, who only looked into her grandmother's face
                     sadly, without speaking.</p>
                  <p>"Enah! my children," said Harpstenah, "the Wakun brave and his beautiful wife
                     were very happy, but although the Great Spirit loves his children, He often
                     lets sorrow fall upon them. One evening, when the first cold was coming, and
                     the women were gathering wild rice and cranberries, the Wakun brave lay in his
                     tee-pee, his two little daughters playing about him, when their mother entered
                     the lodge; on her back was a heavy sack of cranberries. Without looking up, she
                     unfastened the strap from her head, and threw her burden aside; then, sighing
                     heavily, she came by the fire, and sat close to her husband on the buffalo robe
                     where he was lying.</p>
                  <p>"Her face was pale—pale. Deep shadows lay under her soft eyes, and the red hue
                     of the strawberry had gone from her lips; her husband started and sat upright
                     when he saw her.</p>
                  <p>"'What is the matter, my wife?' he said. 'Have you seen Unk-ta-he, the dread
                     Water-god?'</p>
                  <p>"'No, my husband,' she said, again sighing deeply, 'but I have seen Death, and
                     a glance of his eye has fallen upon me, and now I must go away with him, and be
                     his bride. I must leave you and my little girls, alone in the lodge where we
                     have been so happy.'</p>
                  <p>"'You are sick,' said her husband; 'but you will not die. I will go for our
                     medicine-men, and they will charm away this glance of the evil eye. Weep not,
                     my young wife; we will be happy again.'</p>
                  <p>"'Yes, we will be happy,' she said, 'for though I know I must leave you, it
                     will not be very soon; while I can stay with you and my little children, and my
                     old mother, I will be happy even if I suffer pain, but the medicine-men cannot
                     cure me.'</p>
                  <p>"The Wakun brave said kind words to her, and<pb n="204-205"
                        xml:id="VAC6361-00000103"/> her hands got warm, and the color came back to
                     her cheek She slept a long time, and all thought she would be well again—all
                     but her grandmother, for she was a medicine-woman, and she knew that when the
                     glance of an evil spirit had fallen upon the young, it was in vain to try to
                     charm it away with the sacred medicine and the gourd; but she said nothing to
                     the Wakun brave, who loved his wife, and who was angry if any one spoke to him
                     of death.</p>
                  <p>"All through the cold winter they watched her; they made her soup of venison to
                     bring back her strength. The medicine-men would shut out every one from the
                     lodge, and try to charm away the large worm that they said had found its way to
                     her warm breast, and was gnawing at her heart.</p>
                  <p>"The Wakun brave went forth with his bow and arrows, and killed the pheasant.
                     He would say, 'Eat, eat, my wife, and grow strong again.'</p>
                  <p>"Once he looked at her and said, 'The ice is breaking away in the spirit lakes,
                     and a few blue flowers are creeping up through the wet snow to catch the warm
                     breath that comes from the sun; the cold winds and frosts are going, and the
                     wife of the Wakun brave will be well when summer comes again.'</p>
                  <p>"She answered, 'I am only waiting for the first flowers, that I may know it is
                     time for me to go to the land of souls.'</p>
                  <p>"The Wakun brave wept. Had any other warrior wept, he would have been despised,
                     for tears are only for women; but who could despise the Wakun brave, whose head
                     was adorned with feathers of honor; whose arms were red with the life-blood of
                     the enemies of our people?</p>
                  <p>"That night the two little girls laid down near their mother and fell asleep;
                     the grandmother fastened down the door of the tee-pee, to keep out the damp
                     winds, and the Wakun brave sat by the fire near his sick wife. Her eyes shone
                     like the eyes of the deer when the hunter aims his arrow at her heart. Her
                     breath came quick and hard; her bosom heaved, as she lay panting on the buffalo
                     robe. The Wakun brave sighed, for he knew now that she was going from him, that
                     she was even then setting forth on her journey to the world of spirits. She
                     spoke no more, but looked awhile at the two little sleeping maidens, then
                     turned her eyes upon her husband. A long time she gazed upon him, while the
                     brightness faded from her soft eyes; and not until the Wakun brave had placed
                     his hand over her young heart and found it still—did he know that the wife whom
                     he loved was a silent wanderer on the road that leads to the world of
                     souls.</p>
                  <pb n="206-207" xml:id="VAC6361-00000104"/>
                  <p>"Then her grandmother took some water and bathed her white face, and called
                     upon the young maidens to plait her long hair, and to dress her in her richest
                     robes. They put the bridal crown of eagle's feathers upon her head, and heaped
                     their best ornaments, as presents, on her feet, while the Wakun brave took from
                     its place his bow and arrows, and left the lodge.</p>
                  <p>"It was a long time before he returned. The Dacotas thought he had gone to join
                     his wife, or else to live with Unk-ta-he again; but he came back and asked for
                     his daughters, and said he should live with them; yet he never talked of his
                     wife, who lay in the branches of the tall trees, wrapped in the embroidered
                     skin of the white deer, with her face turned towards the rising sun.</p>
                  <p>"Many winters passed away, and still the two maidens lived in the lodge with
                     their father. Always rich presents lay at the door, and night after night the
                     young warriors played on the flute, but the maidens never came forth, though
                     their grandmother shamed them that they were not long ago wives, with their
                     young sons and daughters around them. Their father would say, 'Why do you not
                     marry, my daughters? If you want to live together, you can marry the Black
                     Bear, who has offered to buy you both. Marry him then, or some brave man, that
                     I may see you happy in your tee-pees before I die.</p>
                  <p>"'My father,' said the dark-faced girl, 'we will not leave you; who would cook
                     for you and make your moccasins? You have no wife, either, to cut your wood and
                     bring it to you; we are happy with you and our grandmother, and so we will not
                     choose a husband.'</p>
                  <p>"'Besides, my father,' said the younger maiden, 'the Dacota braves, when they
                     get angry, strike their wives and speak terrible words to them, and this would
                     make my heart die. So I and my sister will stay with you, and not choose a
                     husband.'</p>
                  <milestone n="*   *   *   *   *   *   *   *" unit="typography"/>
                  <p>"One summer evening," continued Harpstenah, after a pause, "the father and the
                     maidens sat outside the door of the lodge, looking at all the wonderful things
                     the Great Spirit had made; the skies, the river, the mountains, and the hill
                     under which the river-gods passed. The grandmother sat on a robe within, for
                     she had now seen a hundred winters, and the night air made her limbs ache. The
                     young warriors came near the tee-pee, laying on the grass and boasting of their
                     strength, and of the scalps they had taken, for they hoped the two sisters
                     would bend their ears to hear, and thus learn to love them; but the maidens
                     talked apart together, and did not notice them; so, one by one the warriors
                     arose and folded<pb n="208-209" xml:id="VAC6361-00000105"/> their robes across
                     their bosoms, and the father and daughters were left together.</p>
                  <p>"'My daughters,' said the Wakun brave, 'listen to my words; they are good. I am
                     an old man. I have not seen as many winters as half our wise men, but I grew
                     old when your mother died. I had stood across my enemy's body and seen the
                     life-blood flow, drenching the ground. I had torn the reeking scalp from his
                     head, and holding it high in my hand, shouted aloud the death-cry. I had
                     murdered the wife and children of the man I hated, and I gloried in death; my
                     soul grew hot with the life I had taken. But when the evil-eye glanced upon
                     your mother, when the blood dried in her veins and oozed from her lips—when she
                     said, "I go to the land of souls," then many winters passed over my soul. And
                     now, my children, I die: I hasten to join the company of warrior spirits who
                     dance to the Giant on the green prairies of the Great Spirit. Who will care for
                     my daughters when I am gone? let them be wise and hear their father's words.
                     Let them choose a brave warrior for a husband, and be happy with him in his
                     lodge.'</p>
                  <p>"The younger maiden said, 'I will do as my sister says; if she will marry the
                     Bounding Elk, I will go to the lodge of the Branching Tree, and we will be good
                     and happy wives.'</p>
                  <p>"'I tell you what we will do, my father,' said the tall maiden; 'we will marry
                     the two stars that are bending over us. I will marry the large bright one, and
                     my sister will marry the small one that is near.'</p>
                  <p>"'Cease! foolish maiden!' said their grandmother; 'the spirits of the stars
                     will hear you; obey your father's words, and go to the lodges of your husbands,
                     and, like the women of your race, be proud to bring up sons to fight against
                     their father's enemies.'</p>
                  <p>"The Wakun brave wrapped himself in his robe, and slept by the door, and the
                     grandmother called the Dacota girls in. 'You must not sleep outside the lodge,'
                     she said; 'do you want some wandering fiery man to carry you off to his distant
                     home?'</p>
                  <p>"'Do not fear,' said the tall maiden; 'the stars, our husbands, will watch over
                     us while we sleep; they love us too well to let the fiery men do us any
                     harm.'</p>
                  <p>"'Your words are foolish,' said the old woman, 'but you will not obey your
                     father, nor listen to what I say. The Great Spirit will not care for you; some
                     trouble will come upon you, because you are disobedient and obstinate.'</p>

                  <head type="sub">AN EPISODE.</head>
                  <p>"THE night wore on; the blue heavens were full of stars, as they are to-night,"
                     continued Harpstenah. "The distant cry of the wolves was heard as they howled
                     for the buried bodies of our enemies. For there had been a great battle, and
                     the Chippeways were pursued by our people, so that they could not carry off
                     their dead, and our women cut them in pieces, and buried them. The big fish
                     leaped in the water, yet the village was quiet as a new-born babe on its
                     mother's breast.</p>
                  <p>"The grandmother slept within the lodge, and the Wakun brave by the door, while
                     the two maidens lay together under the shining stars. The night wore on, and
                     there was no sound to break its silence until the voice of the Wakun brave was
                     heard, calling upon his daughters.</p>
                  <p>"Come back, oh, come back! come,' the Wakun brave said. The Dacotas roused them
                     from their sleep to find out the cause of the warrior's grief. There he stood,
                     his arms stretched forth towards the heavens, his eyes fixed on the two stars;
                     while away, away! the maidens were going through the air, their forms growing
                     smaller and smaller every moment.</p>
                  <p>"There were many Dacotas standing with the Wakun brave, and they called to the
                     maidens by their names. Their old grandmother tore her hair and wrung her
                     hands, but in vain. The maidens were soon a mere speck to those who were
                     straining their eyes to see them, and then there was a bright flashing about
                     the stars, and they were seen no more.</p>
                  <p>"Then did the Wakun brave tell his friends that, as he slept, he heard a noise
                     near him, and he awakened. There was a strange light about his daughters'
                     forms, as they were suddenly lifted up, and borne away from him. He called, and
                     tried to reach them, yet they were quickly far away.</p>
                  <p>"'Bury me, my friends,' said the Wakun brave, 'here, where they slept; then
                     will they ever look down on my grave! for I must join the spirits of my
                     forefathers, and shout with them loud cries of triumph in the land of
                     souls.'</p>
                  <p>"On the robe, within the door, lay the old grandmother. She was gone where
                     there were no more tears. In the morning they laid the dead warrior and the
                     dead woman side by side, in the lodge.</p>
                  <p>"When they came to bury the Wakun brave, by night, there was a great storm. The
                     thunder birds<pb n="212-213" xml:id="VAC6361-00000107"/> arose and clapped
                     their wings, and the water-gods were angry at the sound; they heaved their
                     mighty breasts. The black clouds parted, and the big rain drops fell, and with
                     them fell tears from the skies; the sisters were weeping for their father in
                     their distant home. They were now the wives of the star-spirits. They wept that
                     they had refused the counsel of their father and their aged grandmother; now
                     were they punished—shut up in the bright but cold and silent region of the
                     stars forever."</p>
                  <p>The Dacota maidens wept as Harpstenah finished. The Singing Bird again looked
                     in her grandmother's face; two tears rested on her young cheek, but she said
                     nothing.</p>
                  <p>"My children," said Harpstenah, "you must all go to sleep. The prairies are
                     covered with red strawberries, and, before the sun is up, you must be gathering
                     them for the wives of the pale faces. The Dacotas are no longer stronger than
                     their enemies. We must give up our lands and our homes, and travel towards the
                     setting sun, when the white man bids us. We will need food and clothing, for
                     have no Wakun brave to bring plenty to our lodge when the winter's cold comes
                     upon us. We must take to the pale faces the things they want, and get from them
                     what will buy us food and clothing."</p>

                  <p>"Grandmother," said the Singing Bird, as they stood in their lodge, ere laying
                     down to sleep, "will you lend me your sharp axe, that you bought from the
                     trader?"</p>
                  <p>"For what?" said her grandmother.</p>
                  <p>Once more the Singing Bird raised her beautiful eyes, but there were no tears
                     resting on her soft cheeks; a crimson glow was there as she said—</p>
                  <p>"I will no longer be obstinate. I will marry the man you have chosen for me. I
                     will go out and cut down the young trees for our lodge. I will love you and
                     care for you, as you did for me when I was young, and we will be happy
                     together."</p>
                  <p>"The Great Spirit is good to me," said the aged Harpstenah. "My daughter! I
                     will sit by the fire in your lodge, and teach your children many wise things.
                     No evil spirit will cast a spell upon you, now that your heart has listened to
                     my words. I loved you, and worked for you when want and trouble were pressing
                     upon me, but now have you made my heart glad, and my old eyes will weep no
                     more."</p>

                  <head type="sub">A RAINY DAY.</head>
                  <p>IT is night, again—night, dreary and rainy. The little ones are all safe; it
                     may be, they are dreaming of the babes in the wood, whose history lulled them
                     to sleep. The singer's head is nodding over her clasped hands; she has a right
                     to her nap, if ever nurse earned her wages. Three times I have awakened her,
                     that she might go to her room. She opens her eyes, looks up drowsily at me, and
                     closes them again. I will not disturb her, for I am established in my
                     arm-chair, my feet on the ottoman. I ought to be happy; but, like Lot's wife, I
                     cannot help looking back. The cares of this life, the little everyday troubles,
                     that should be as Sodom and Gomorrah, oppress me.</p>
                  <p>And to-day everything has gone wrong. From my bed this morning, I went to my
                     window. I had dreamed that a rose-tree, whose branches I was coaxing to climb
                     about the lattice-work, was in full bloom. Half-awake, I rubbed my eyes that I
                     might see distinctly to count the blossoms. Alas! the storm had broken off the
                     branches, and they, with their roses, were strewed about, a wreck of what was
                     so pretty yesterday. I was lamenting all the time that I was dressing, for in
                     the city any green thing that will live and grow about me, I learn to love.</p>
                  <p>In the breakfast-room, I found the family assembled; <emph>rainy day</emph> was
                     written on every face. The children hung about; there was to be no climbing of
                     the old apple-tree, no weeding the little garden, no pleasant afternoon in the
                     Capitol grounds. Their elders had been watching the clouds, and saw no signs of
                     a clearing up. Yet verses of Scripture fell sweetly on our ears, and the
                     morning prayer was offered to strengthen us for the duties of the day. Then
                     breakfast, and then, the scattering of the gentlemen to their offices. And
                     then, the burden of housekeeping. How heavily it fell upon me! like those black
                     clouds that I saw when I looked out from the kitchen window. And beside this
                     window, on the table, were the ripe cherries and all the other materials for a
                     cherry-pudding.</p>
                  <p>I wish it were a reverie, the memory of that cherry-pudding! for if I went
                     nearer to that large mirror that hangs between the windows, I should see the
                     blush that I <emph>feel</emph> crimsoning my face.</p>

                        xml:id="VAC6361-00000109"/> friends and I; the night was fair, too fair to
                     sleep away. From the balcony, we watched the passing clouds, and saw the moon
                     arise. Less frequently came the passers-by. The quiet wooed to conversation.
                     Our theme was men—and women—how they lived, and died, and were forgotten.</p>
                  <p>"Not forgotten," said one; "there are men for whom death is a passport to
                     veneration, and an undying human sympathy. Time is the great leveller; he puts
                     men where they ought to be. One in life is too little valued—another too much;
                     Time assigns each his proper place. And so with books. It is not the decree of
                     the multitude, that babbles of its own opinions, that applauds or condemns, as
                     the sentiments of a book agree or clash with its own. It is the calm approval
                     of posterity that is to be desired. <emph>That</emph> is fame for which man may
                     toil."</p>
                  <p>"And woman"—I said.</p>
                  <p>"Woman!" he interrupted me. "What has woman to do with fame? Bah! let her nurse
                     her children; let her dust the house, make puddings."</p>
                  <p>"She may do all this," I said; "but this being done, may she not write
                     books?"</p>
                  <p>"No!" he yelled out, in a voice loud enough to awake our farthest neighbor, or
                     the dead. "No woman ever made a good pudding that wrote a book. That is as
                     certain as that we shall not see yonder moon, to-morrow, at noonday."</p>
                  <p>"Miss Leslie," I suggested, "and Mrs. Childs."</p>
                  <p>"They wrote receipts," he answered, gruffly. "I should not like to eat one of
                     their puddings."</p>
                  <p>"Tennyson," I said, "favors the rights of woman."</p>
                  <p>"Tennyson is a fool!" he growled out. "Some woman was at his elbow when he
                     wrote that 'Princess.' Whenever a wise man plays the fool, a woman is at the
                     bottom of it."</p>
                  <p>He got up to go. We all arose, though the moon still shone gloriously. I caught
                     from one of her beams an idea.</p>
                  <p>"Come to me, all of you," I said, "to-morrow. I will disprove what he says. He
                     is a woman-hater. He shall eat of my pudding, and take back what he says."</p>
                  <p>"Never!" he said, with a raven's laugh. But the rest smiled, and all promised
                     to come. I was left alone on the balcony.</p>
                  <p>It was pleasant to be there, and look on that beautiful night; to be there
                     alone. Yet the thought of that woman-hater came up, and marred the beauty of
                     the heavens. I took "In Memorium" from the marble table, and thought to read it
                     by the moonlight. But I was offended, and could not compose my mind. I threw
                     down the book, and drew in the shutters. "I never will," I murmured, as if
                     addressing those flying clouds—"I never will allow myself to be inferior to
                     such as he. <emph>Different</emph>, I may be—I<pb n="218-219"
                        xml:id="VAC6361-00000110"/> hope I am; but inferior, never." I slammed down
                     the window, and left the room." "According to him" (as I slowly went up the
                     steps), "I am condemned to babies, dust, and puddings forever."</p>
                  <p>Very cautiously I opened the door of my chamber, lest I should wake the
                     sleepers. I threw myself in the old chair, and felt at home. I was myself
                     again. How comfortable it was! I glanced into the nursery by the door; all was,
                     as it should be, there.</p>
                  <p>My eye swept over my own room. Here am I queen, I thought, but my domains are
                     neither rich nor extended. A room twenty feet square. An ingrain carpet, very
                     grave colored. Painted pine furniture! A yankee clock, and three pictures over
                     the mantle-piece, two commemorative of woman's endurance and unselfish
                     devotion; the third, the prisoner of Chillon. A mirror, over which were hung
                     faded rose-buds; they were blooming when my mother placed them there. On the
                     table were some twenty books. <emph>Underneath</emph> the table was a huge
                     basket of undarned stockings and pantaloons that wanted new knees. I looked
                     kindly at the books; they were friends that never failed me. Coldly I regarded
                     the basket. It was my enemy, forever telling me what I ought to do.</p>
                  <p>I went to bed. To-morrow there was work for me. I was to prove that a literary
                     life did not unfit a woman for domestic duties. Did I succeed, I might write
                     books. Did I fail—babies, dust, and puddings! The last thing, I looked out to
                     see how, in so short a time, the morn had become obscured. Clouds were
                     gathering as I drew down the painted window shade. Fatal augury! I awoke to see
                     the rainy day.</p>
                  <milestone n="*   *   *   *   *" unit="typography"/>
                  <p>How much depended upon a cherry pudding. A solemn consciousness of this
                     oppressed me, as I surveyed the preparations, in course of which Miss Leslie (I
                     mean her cookery book) was laid upon the table.</p>
                  <p>Biddy was beating the eggs. How will it turn out? I soliloquized—the pudding!
                     will it be light? will it be good? The cherries, how red they are, how juicy!
                     the eggs, so fresh. The milk, already the cream is gathering. The sifted flour
                     looks like fallen snow. The butter is yellow as the cowslip. The sugar, weighed
                     and powdered—the grated nutmeg—the mace—the pint of wine, for the sauce. Oh! it
                        <emph>must</emph> be good! I shall triumph over the woman hater; he will bow
                     to me, beg my pardon, and tell me to write more books, and I will be
                     magnanimous, and forgive him his thousand sneers. I mixed the flour and milk
                     and frothing eggs. It was all yellow as gamboge. I stirred it carefully with a
                     long iron spoon. There was not a lump to<pb n="220-221"
                        xml:id="VAC6361-00000111"/> be seen. I poured it into the bag, made of
                     cotton cloth white and new. I plunged it, standing at arm's length, in the
                     boiling water, that for a moment stopped its bubbling, and then, went at it
                     harder than ever. The pudding danced about. Biddy stood by the range, regarding
                     it with interest.</p>
                  <p>"Biddy," said I, "the dignity of your sex depends upon the fate of that
                     pudding. If you value your honor, let nothing happen to it."</p>
                  <p>"Never fear," said she, with a confident air, "it will do well. It will be
                     good, I'll engage. In my father's, in Ireland, we had cherry puddings every day
                     in the year, made of cherries, fresh pulled off our own trees."</p>
                  <p>"We've no such trees in our own country," I said.</p>
                  <p>"I'll engage not," said Biddy, wiping her face with her apron. "Americky aint
                     the old country."</p>
                  <p>"Our trees," said I, "Biddy! only bear once a year, in the summer; and it is
                     but for a short time that we can make cherry puddings. So do not let this burn
                     up."</p>
                  <p>"I'll burn up myself first," said she, with energy.</p>
                  <p>I thought I could trust her to watch it, so I went to a near room, and picking
                     up a book, threw myself on the lounge. Cooking is fatiguing I thought, but the
                     pudding will repay me for my trouble. I arranged the pillows under my head, and
                     opened Nile Notes; turning over the leaves until I came to the chapter
                     describing the tombs of the kings and queens of Egypt. I like to wander among
                     the tombs.</p>
                  <p>I never read carelessly anything about death; there was always a
                        <emph>terrible</emph> fascination in the subject; it suggests thought. Even
                     the death of an animal affects me.</p>
                  <p>I was soon lost in thought, after reading of the splendor of the sepulchres of
                     the Egyptian kings; of the unpretending appearance of those of the queens. They
                     were not buried together, those husbands and wives of Egypt. This will suit the
                     woman hater. He should have lived in those days; his idea of the great
                     inequality of the sexes, would interfere with a wife's privilege of mouldering
                     away by the side of her husband. So thought the kings of Egypt, and now, we
                     women of a later age, turn away in laughter, or in disgust, from the poor
                     miserable men mummies that are unfolded for inspection. Better have been laid
                     in the earth to fulfil the sentence, "dust to dust." Better have acknowledged
                     the relationship with the worm.</p>
                  <p>As it is, the sepulchres of the queens are the more pleasant to contemplate.
                     There was less pretension, and so the contrast, with the utter desolation, is
                     less.</p>
                  <p>How they have mouldered away! eyes and hearts and rags together. To get up to
                     the—tombs, one must wade through rags that once were winding<pb n="222-223"
                        xml:id="VAC6361-00000112"/> sheets, or kick them up, as children do the dead
                     leaves, in the woods.</p>
                  <p>So I wandered among the tombs, and the dead came out. There stood Cleopatra! I
                     dreamed over her history, and in the recalling of the <emph>splendid</emph>
                     sins of her life half an hour passed.</p>
                  <p>Longer perhaps; but, of a sudden, I started from that lounge. Those children up
                     stairs! were they pulling down the chandeliers, and taking up the carpets? It
                     was a rainy day.</p>
                  <p>I went up to bargain with them for peace. A sponge cake was to be the reward of
                     their compliance with my terms. They were not in the nursery; there had been
                     disputes, and a rebellion. Only the nurse and baby remained to watch, at the
                     window, the falling rain. I traced the rebels to my room, of which they had
                     taken possession. One was standing on his head, on my rosewood writing-desk.
                     The others were building a house with my books. The foundations were of
                     Shakspeare and Webster's Dictionary. The walls were of Blackwood and the
                     Quarterly Review. The Opium Eater and his books served for the roof, while a
                     French play book and an old worn copy of Sartor Resartus made the chimney. What
                     could I, should I do?</p>
                  <p>I showed the sponge cake, proposing terms of submission. The rebels, stumbling
                     over the ruins of their falling temple, returned to the nursery. Each was in
                     danger of choking in another moment, from a large mouthful, and a promise of
                     obedience to the laws for the future. I picked up my books, and descended to
                     inquire after my pudding.</p>
                  <p>I had reached the landing on the next floor, when a strange gurgling sound met
                     my ear. I flew back to the nursery; all was well. Returning, I heard again the
                     horrid noise. What could it be? Perhaps the rain-water from the spout on the
                     porch. I went out to look. It was flowing gently with a dripping noise, while
                     louder and louder sounded something else, as if five hundred bottles were being
                     held upside down, for their contents to escape. What could it be? it almost
                     stunned me. Oh! Nemesis! the pudding!</p>
                  <p>I leaped down the steps, three at a time—dashed through the blind door that
                     divides the hall, and threw open the kitchen door. Oh! death to literature and
                     woman's rights! confusion to Horace Greeley forever—it <emph>was</emph> the
                     pudding!</p>
                  <p>There it was—or, there were its remains, bubbling, gurgling, and bursting forth
                     from the upper half of the burnt bag. Through the steamy smoke arising, I saw
                     the corners of the cotton and the drenched tape. The last of the gamboge liquid
                     was pouring, out of the remnants of the bag that Biddy had suspended by a long
                     two-pronged fork, while she looked at me in desperate distraction. I saw<pb
                        n="224-225" xml:id="VAC6361-00000113"/> her lips move, but could hear
                     nothing save the awful commotion going on in that iron pot. I sunk into the
                     nearest chair. Oh! agony! the woman-hater!</p>
                  <p>The awful din of the strife was fading away. The last drops were oozing from
                     the scorched cotton. It was all boiling together; cherries, and milk, and eggs,
                     and—a yard of burned cotton, with a gallon of water. What a mess wherewith to
                     assert the dignity of woman! What a sample of my domestic abilities to offer to
                     the woman-hater! What a specimen of the housekeeping of a literary woman!</p>
                  <p>There was silence. It was all over. Biddy laid her fork down, after tossing
                     into a pan the remains of the pudding bag. She looked at me with set teeth;
                     stooping over the boiling water had made her very red in the face. I waited for
                     her to speak, wishing in my soul that she were in Ireland, on the topmost bough
                     of her ever-bearing cherry trees.</p>
                  <p>She spoke—"Faix! an' I never see anything burn so quick as that."</p>
                  <p>I looked at her—I burst into tears. I could no more; but feeling faint, I went
                     into the air. Recovering, I rushed up stairs to my room, locked my door, and
                     threw myself on the bed. I could have laughed my life away, but for the thought
                     of the woman-hater. He was right; and I will make no more books—I should say
                     puddings—forever.</p>
                  <p>I shuddered at the thought of meeting him at dinner. Shall he triumph over me
                     at my own table? Never! let me die first, and be buried with the queens of
                     Egypt, or even among the kings.</p>
                  <p>I was taken ill. At twelve o'clock the woman hater found on his table a note.
                     It apprised him of my sudden indisposition; a cold from the change in the
                     weather.</p>
                  <p>This evening, I received one from him. It ran thus:—</p>
                  <p>"I hope your cold is better. I shall not see you again until I return from
                     Sevastopol. I leave in the morning.</p>
                  <p>"P. S. We are old friends. Were you really ill, or did your pudding burn?
                     Farewell."</p>
                  <p>May he stay in Sevastopol forever!</p>
                  <p>But I will sit here and think of people that I know; I may say what I choose of
                     them to myself. Who hears me if I think aloud? The world is asleep.</p>
                  <p>You may abuse the world, and philosophize on the objections to intercourse with
                     it—and on the evils of city life. I love a city life, and none other, for I
                     love my race. Cowper and I would never have agreed had we discussed this
                     question. And yet I loved <emph>him</emph> from a child, for his history of the
                     three hares.</p>
                  <p>My friends come to me and tell me what the<pb n="226-227"
                        xml:id="VAC6361-00000114"/> world says and does; they meet in my little
                     parlor, and make the hours there most happy. Unwillingly I witness their
                     departure, and then I am alone to dream of what they said and how they
                     looked.</p>
                  <p>To-night I have been self-imprisoned for fear of the woman-hater, and the
                     evening has been rainy; the children have been playing noisy games; they have
                     broken two tumblers and a large pitcher, but I do not complain. There is no
                     broken head.</p>
                  <p>I am encouraged, for it is clearing up. I see the stars. I will dream of my
                     friends <emph>before</emph> I sleep.</p>

                  <p>IT has not been long since a gentleman that I shall call Mason, was frequently
                     seen in the fashionable circles of New York society; he was constantly attended
                     by his son. The two attracted much attention; the father, by his handsome
                     figure and courteous manners, and by a haughtiness of bearing that was softened
                     by a certain sadness of demeanor and countenance; the son, by remarkable
                     regularity of features, grace of person, and delicacy of appearance; a voice so
                     agreeable as to arrest every listener, and a tone of conversation that showed
                     how improved and refined a mind was encased in a frame so slight. Added to all
                     this was the reputation of wealth, that, so frequently, is erroneously attached
                     to those who come from the South. It is not surprising, then,<pb n="230-231"
                        xml:id="VAC6361-00000116"/> that father and son were received with smiles by
                     beautiful daughters and calculating mothers, when together they visited the
                     crowded scenes of resort during the gay season.</p>
                  <p>Mr. Mason had been a planter in Alabama; his residence was not distant from a
                     large town on the sea-coast. There Arthur was born and reared with the utmost
                     care. An excellent tutor had charge of his education, while both parents
                     encouraged him in his pursuits. The extreme delicacy of his health induced his
                     father to leave Alabama, always, in May, with his family, for New England and
                     its bracing climate, where they remained until the hazy clouds of Autumn veiled
                     the sun, and the vines that clung to the old trees crimsoned at the advent of
                     the Indian Summer. Even then Arthur would earnestly petition to stay a little
                     longer, declaring there were no such crimson and yellow woods in Alabama as
                     these through which he rambled.</p>
                  <p>There is poetry in many a child's soul that dies out for want of nursing; but
                     this was not the case with Arthur Mason. His father was a scholar, and his
                     mother, though far from being learned, had a fine mind, and was well-informed.
                     From her eye, her child's caught a glow that brightened with intelligence, as
                     he gazed on the hills clothed in the gorgeous tints of Autumn. The changing
                     clouds hanging over them; the impetuous streams dancing by the rocks and
                     bushes; the bright hues of the chestnut and butternut trees contrasted with the
                     old pines and evergreens; in each of these objects Arthur saw traces of God's
                     glory. His eyes rested on the beautiful, and his thoughts ascended to the
                     Creator.</p>
                  <p>Mrs. Mason's devotional spirit had descended to her son. She told him, while in
                     early childhood he rested in her arms, of the poets of the Bible, and how they
                     saw God in every towering hill, and in each flower by the way-side. She tried
                     to describe to him "the beginning," when God created the heavens and the earth;
                     how chaos itself was forced to exist, and from it sprang the earth, a cradle,
                     and, alas! a grave for man. She pictured to his mind the swaying waters, and
                     the gleaming light; and the silence that reigned over them, disturbed by no
                     sound save the awful breathings of the Almighty. She told of the division of
                     the waters above from those under the firmament; of the coming forth of the dry
                     land from beneath the waves, lashing, as they retired; of the springing up of
                     the grass, the herb, the forest, and the fruit tree; of the lights that shone,
                     at God's command, in the blue heavens; of the creation of the great whale, the
                     smaller fishes, and the winged fowl, and of all the animals on the face of the
                     earth. And when all was ready for man, when God in his own time, however we may
                        designate<pb n="232-233" xml:id="VAC6361-00000117"/> nate it, had prepared
                     for man a habitation, he created him of the small particles of the dust of the
                     earth, and brought him to his home. Then he provided for him a companion, in
                     the person of Eve.</p>
                  <p>She would relate to him the history of man; his first happiness, his fall from
                     holiness, his banishment from Eden. She would tell of the deluge, the tower of
                     Babel, the dispersion of the human race, Sinai and its terrors; of all the
                     interesting incidents we find in Scripture. These themes were discussed by the
                     mother and child in the morning walk, or as the time of rest approached. They
                     often talked of Jesus, of the Millennium, of Heaven, and of Hell.</p>
                  <p>The boy loved to hear of the poets of the Bible, of the beautiful lives that
                     they led; how fearless they were, doing God's will, how their souls were like
                     "meteors kindled at the eye of the Almighty." How Moses lived with God and
                     God's works, desiring no other society, and how at the last, God himself buried
                     him. Often Arthur asked of Joshua, who commanded the sun and moon to stand
                     still, and his mother showed him that here faith triumphed over the laws of
                     science. For what science could arrest the going of the sun and moon? but
                     Joshua did so by his confidence in God!</p>
                  <p>They talked, too, of the godless poet, and how dreadful it was when genius
                     stood up, like an armed man, to contend with God; of David and the beautiful
                     tiful songs he sang, playing upon the harp. Arthur, when a little fellow,
                     repeated, by heart, a number of these songs, and his mother often read to him
                     the twenty-second, telling him that some writers said that Christ had chanted
                     the whole of this psalm when hanging on the cross. She talked to him of
                     Solomon, of the beauty and holiness of his youth, and of the tremendous sins of
                     his later years. Of Isaiah, that splendid poet and prophet, who, tradition
                     says, was sawn asunder by his enemies. Of Jeremiah, who, like Christ, wept over
                     Jerusalem, and who perished a martyr in Egypt. of Ezekiel, whose verses are so
                     startling and strange, and who died young. Of Daniel, the dreamer, and of
                     Jonah, who sang that noble song on the sea-shore. Of Hosea, the patriot, and
                     Amos, the herdsman. Of Joel, who told of the last day, and of Micah, who
                     prophesied the time when "they shall learn war no more." Of all the Old
                     Testament poets, Arthur and his mother often talked.</p>
                  <p>And there was time to dwell on the poets of the New Testament; Alfred could
                     repeat many of the beautiful sayings of Christ, and of John, and James, and
                     Paul. He lingered always on the history of Peter, who was so bold and
                     impetuous, but so affectionate; for even when he came to be an old man, he
                     never heard the cock crow but tears streamed from his eyes; and his bosom
                     heaved with repentant<pb n="234-235" xml:id="VAC6361-00000118"/> emotion when
                     he remembered how he denied Christ. These thoughts were familiar ones to
                     Arthur, who, as he became older, and read the verses of other poets, would
                     compare their works and their lives with those of his old friends of the Bible,
                     whose history his mother's voice had made so charming to his ear.</p>
                  <p>Thus Arthur approached manhood; but his extreme delicacy of health made it
                     evident to his parents that he was unfitted for any profession or occupation
                     that would secure to him a maintenance. This gave them no care beyond the
                     anxiety and grief that they felt at his occasional attacks of illness, and the
                     prostration of strength that followed. An only child, he would inherit an ample
                     fortune. They tried to make him good and happy, and in this, for many years,
                     they seemed to have succeeded. Though his health was so delicate, his figure
                     was sufficiently large, but not robust; his countenance was radiant with
                     intelligence and animation; his days passed smoothly along, varied with many an
                     agreeable employment. He was his mother's assistant in all her efforts for the
                     improvement of the poor around her, and for the welfare of her servants. Much
                     of his time was passed with his father in the library, the shelves of which
                     were stored with good books. Calmly and happily the time passed, until he had
                     attained his twenty-third year.</p>

                  <p>IT was late in October. A severe fever had been prevailing on the southern
                     coast, and although it was considered safe for those who had protracted, on
                     this account, their visit to the North, to return home, yet there were
                     scattering cases that proved severe, and sometimes fatal. Mrs. Mason, on
                     arriving at her house, was in perfect health, and, with an energy that was an
                     admirable element of her character, she set to work to administer comforts to
                     those in her neighborhood who were still invalids. Her kind heart sorrowed,
                     most of all, for the old servants who received her with so much affection, and
                     who trusted to her skill to renew the strength that fever had wasted away. It
                     was while anxious for the welfare of others, that symptoms of the fever were
                        exhibited<pb n="236-237" xml:id="VAC6361-00000119"/> in her own person.
                     Possessing a vigorous constitution, her friends, for the first few days, were
                     not alarmed; but a sudden change for the worse aroused their fears, and before
                     they were really conscious of her danger, she was dead. The shock was
                     overpowering to her husband and son, and the lamentations of the servants were
                     heard all over the plantation. Many of her friends assembled at the first
                     tidings of her danger, and they vainly endeavored to reconcile her husband to
                     the will of God. He seemed possessed of a horror at the thought of death and
                     the grave when associated with her, and refusing to look upon her after death,
                     never entered the room in which she expired. But not so with Arthur. He
                     acknowledged the right of the Creator to dispense joy or grief according to his
                     will. Not entirely submissive in the first hour of passionate sorrow—when
                     reason and reflection, guided by religion, came to his aid, he bowed beneath
                     the hand that smote him, and tried to bring to his father's mind the promises
                     of faith to sustain him in this dark hour.</p>
                  <p>Notwithstanding the kindness and solicitude of friends, and the devotion of his
                     son, Mr. Mason's health failed under the morbid indulgence of his grief. He
                     rarely opened a book, and refused to attend to any business affairs, passing
                     his time in walking about the house and grounds, and moodily dwelling on the
                     past. His agent, a crafty, dishonest man, took advantage of his indifference,
                     and Arthur perceived that his father's interests were suffering from neglect.
                     Unused, as he was, to business details, he determined to apply himself closely
                     to the consideration of his father's concerns, and, if necessary, to give up
                     the agent, and himself supply his place. But the increasing despondency and
                     illness of his only parent so alarmed him that he suddenly determined to take
                     the advice of their medical attendant, and go to New York, where change of
                     scene might accomplish much towards a recovery. Mr. Mason expressed surprise at
                     his son's wish to leave Alabama, but readily consented, and showed some
                     interest in the preparations that were immediately commenced for their
                     journey.</p>
                  <p>One circumstance I have not mentioned; it was Arthur's attachment to a young
                     lady who had always lived near him. This attachment had commenced when they
                     were mere children, and had grown with their growth. Ada's father died when she
                     was quite young, and Mrs. Morton was occupied with the management of the
                     affairs connected with her estate. Thus, Ada, who was a most engaging child,
                     was left much to herself, and passed a great deal of her time with Arthur and
                     his mother. She became dear as a daughter to Mrs. Mason, who looked forward to
                     seeing her stand in such a relation to her. But Mrs. Morton was a calculating
                     woman, and<pb n="238-239" xml:id="VAC6361-00000120"/> when Ada and Arthur were
                     no longer children, their intimacy gave her no little uneasiness. She knew Mr.
                     Mason to be a careless, extravagant person, and Arthur's state of health was a
                     serious objection. Yet, after he had attained his twentieth year, his health
                     had improved so much that it could no longer be urged as an objection, and
                     influenced by her daughter's petitions, she consented to the engagement. The
                     marriage was to have taken place during the winter that followed Mrs. Mason's
                     death, but that event Mrs. Morton seized upon as an excuse for delay. Mr.
                     Mason's illness took up much of his son's time, and Ada saw, with anxiety, her
                     mother resuming her old expressions of dissatisfaction, though she concealed,
                     until she was ready to act, her determination ultimately to prevent the
                     marriage.</p>
                  <p>It was on the evening before the day appointed for the departure to New York.
                     Arthur was sitting in the library, listening to his father's restless walking
                     through the long hall. It was just a year from the time of his mother's death,
                     and during that period he had been his father's constant and devoted attendant.
                     His own health had never been so good. Were it not for the delicate mould of
                     his features, and his complexion, one could have hardly thought of him as ever
                     having been an invalid.</p>
                  <p>He had been looking over some papers left for him by the agent, and had
                     concluded that it was impossible for him, at present, to make any change in the
                     person who should manage the property during their absence. The agent made many
                     assurances of devotion to his father's interests. These Arthur doubted; but he
                     trusted all to the man, from necessity. The servants had been commended to the
                     kindness of a friend, who promised to see that the overseer acted up to the
                     considerate instructions that their master had given him. There seemed nothing
                     more to do, and Arthur's thoughts disengaged, turned at once to Ada, from whom
                     he had parted that afternoon. He dwelt on their long attachment, on the
                     affectionate intercourse that had, at first, united them as brother and sister;
                     then he recalled the time when that calm stream of feeling became a torrent,
                     when he felt there was a tie yet stronger than the one uniting sister and
                     brother. He remembered when he told this to Ada, and how ingenuously she
                     acknowledged that he occupied the highest place in her affections. With all
                     these pleasant thoughts his mother was associated, and now her presence seemed
                     to be about him, as he looked from the window to her grave, over which the
                     moonlight was streaming. This reminded him that he was leaving scenes so

                     hand across his brow and sighed heavily, as again the sound of his father's
                     footsteps recalled him to his greatest care. He determined to join him, when
                     the door opened, and the old house-servant announced Mrs. Morton.</p>

                  <p>MRS. MORTON was a stately lady, and her disposition could be read in the
                     flashing of her black eyes, that had no expression of softness, intimating the
                     yielding nature usually attributed to woman. She loved money inordinately, and
                     was thus a victim to a passion that changes the very nature of woman; this
                     grasping tendency increased every day. She had naturally a violent temper, but
                     rarely permitted herself to show any emotion, so under her control were her
                     feelings and sentiments. Rumor declared that Mr. Morton had not been happy in
                     his marriage, and reports of Mrs. Morton's penurious dealings with
                     tradespeople, and exacting course towards her servants, made her rather
                     unpopular among her acquaintances. Yet she aimed at pleasing generally, and her
                     manners were conciliatory.<pb n="242-243" xml:id="VAC6361-00000122"/> She could
                     flatter when she had an object to gain. Devoted to fine dress, a great part of
                     her time was passed in the study of the art of adorning. On the occasion of her
                     visit to Arthur, she swept into the room arrayed with her usual magnificence.
                     Arthur, though taken by surprise, received her cordially. Such a woman could
                     not command his admiration, hardly his respect; but it was enough for him that
                     she was Ada's mother.</p>
                  <p>He welcomed her, and begged her to be seated. For a while, they conversed on
                     subjects that were of no particular interest, until Mrs. Morton spoke of Mr.
                     Mason's health, and expressed the hope that the change might prove beneficial
                     to him. After a slight hesitation, she said, "I have not yet touched upon the
                     cause of my visit to you this evening. I am desirous of having some
                     conversation in which my daughter is concerned."</p>
                  <p>"You may be assured," said Arthur, "that if Ada is the subject, there will be
                     no want of interest on my part."</p>
                  <p>This answer, and Arthur's countenance, convinced Mrs. Morton that he had no
                     suspicion of what would follow; and the appearance of the young man, his
                     graceful figure as he leaned, with folded arms, against the broad window, the
                     expectation, unaccompanied by anxiety, that animated his features, the low,
                     gentle tone of voice—these would have disarmed most persons of unkindness; but
                     Mrs. Morton was what is called a hard woman. Once determined on a thing, no
                     obstacle affected her. By frugality and untiring industry, her husband had
                     accumulated a large fortune, and gold was her god. Now, she had come with a
                     steady purpose of breaking her daughter's engagement, and, careless as to Ada's
                     suffering, it was not a matter of the smallest moment what Arthur would feel
                     when she should have announced her intention.</p>
                  <p>"I left Ada so short a time ago," said Arthur, "that I need hardly inquire if
                     she is well; and I hope that this separation, that is very painful to us both,
                     will not be prolonged. My father's state of health is so alarming, that I feel
                     I ought not to hesitate to make a sacrifice for his sake. Change of air may be
                     the best medicine for him, and I hope he will soon return to his home
                     restored."</p>
                  <p>"I hope so," said Mrs. Morton; "but, Arthur, what I have to say had better be
                     said briefly and plainly. You cannot have forgotten that I never approved of my
                     daughter's engagement with you, not from any personal dislike, but because your
                     state of health has been such as to preclude the possibility of your ever being
                     able to exert yourself for the support of a family, should such exertion become
                     necessary."</p>
                  <p>Mrs. Morton stopped speaking, for Arthur's surprise<pb n="244-245"
                        xml:id="VAC6361-00000123"/> prise and agitation were so great that he stood
                     like one bewildered, and evidently did not understand clearly what had been
                     said to him. But, in a moment he recovered, and asked Mrs. Morton to explain
                     herself. This she did, and added an allusion to the critical condition of Mr.
                     Mason's affairs.</p>
                  <p>"But, do you mean me to infer," said Arthur, "from what you have said, that you
                     wish to break the engagement between Ada and myself? Surely it is too solemn a
                     covenant to be dissolved on light grounds."</p>
                  <p>"It is a light ground, Mr. Mason, that a man has not the means to maintain the
                     woman to whom he offers himself."</p>
                  <p>"But I have the means," said Arthur, quickly. "I know that my father's estate
                     has suffered from the carelessness or dishonesty of his agent, and from our own
                     neglect, but the difficulty is not irremediable. I had intended to have
                     persuaded my father to dismiss Johnson, and to have closely inquired into these
                     affairs myself, but my father is averse to being annoyed just now. I hope,
                     however, soon to return and arrange our business concerns, so that the loss to
                     us will be trifling."</p>
                  <p>"It is too late," said Mrs. Morton; "that Johnson has involved you in a dozen
                     ways; but I do not wish to discuss this—let every man row his own canoe. As far
                     as my daughter is concerned, her engagement gagement to you must be broken. I
                     never approved of it, and less now than formerly, and as you are going away,
                     and the time of your return is uncertain, my daughter must be free."</p>
                  <p>"This is not Ada's wish?" said Arthur.</p>
                  <p>"No," said Mrs. Morton, "but that does not make it less for her good. I trust
                     to you to act honestly. Time will prove you to be a poor man, and I have had
                     too much to do with money not to know its value. I told Ada when I left home
                     that I should see you and say to you what I have."</p>
                  <p>"Mrs. Morton," said Arthur, "I must see Ada myself. Do you know what you would
                     do when you talk of separating us? My mother loved Ada as her own child, and
                     you made a promise on a deathbed that you seem to have forgotten. You would not
                     break a promise to the dead for money? I will <emph>not</emph> consent to the
                     dissolving of this engagement until I see Ada. I will be as firm as you;
                     firmer, for I have right on my side. But if Ada is satisfied to give me up, I
                     will submit."</p>
                  <p>"I thought," said Mrs. Morton, "that your nice sense of honor would induce you
                     to withdraw at once."</p>
                  <p>"My sense of honor, madam, leads me to think first of the woman that loves me.
                     Does she cease to love me? It will then be easy to give her back her promise.
                     But I must learn this from her own lips."<pb n="246-247"
                        xml:id="VAC6361-00000124"/> The color mounted to Mrs. Morton's face, and her
                     eyes flashed with anger. "Suppose," said she, "that a short time proves your
                     father to be a bankrupt—would you claim my daughter's promise without a dollar
                     in your pocket?"</p>
                  <p>There was a coarseness in her expression and manner that shocked Arthur, but he
                     replied calmly. "Madam if it be proved that I am a poor man, I will promise you
                     never to ask your daughter's hand until I am able to support her as she is
                     accustomed to live. But may I inquire how you came by this knowledge of the
                     condition of our affairs?"</p>
                  <p>Mrs. Morton looked annoyed, but declined answering the question. "Mr. Mason,"
                     she said, "I will tell you plainly that my daughter shall not marry you unless
                     you can prove to me that your fortune is equal to what it was when the
                     engagement was formed. Ada will not dare marry without my consent, and I vow,
                     that unless you can fulfil the conditions that I now name, I never will
                     consent. But I do not wish longer to detain you." And she rose from her
                     chair.</p>
                  <p>Arthur had stood during the interview, and he now advanced towards her. "I will
                     remain here another day, in order to see Ada."</p>
                  <p>"It is not necessary," said Mrs. Morton, haughtily. "Ada is not very strong,
                     and I do not wish her agitated. When you come back you will be able to judge,
                     if, after I have told you of my resolution, it will be of any use to press the
                     subject of your marriage."</p>
                  <p>She bade him good evening, and hurried to the carriage, to which Arthur
                     attended her. She did not even offer her hand at parting. Arthur waited until
                     the carriage had driven away, and then returned to the library.</p>
                  <p>Most painfully came upon him this unexpected change in his prospects, and he
                     saw, at one glance, how little he had to hope from Mrs. Morton's resolute
                     disposition, and from the confusion in which his father's affairs were
                     involved. He knew that he could never offer Ada the fortune he had once owned,
                     for his father had, at Johnson's advice, sold property to meet urgent debts,
                     and was still involved. He had no doubt but that it was Mrs. Morton's intention
                     to break off the engagement. One thought brought him comfort, and that was,
                     that Ada, with all her gentleness, had from childhood possessed great firmness
                     of purpose. But what could she do in the hands of a woman like her mother, who,
                     though she loved her child after a fashion, would not hesitate to sacrifice
                     her, were anything to be gained by it. Arthur was overpowered by these
                     reflections, and it required a strong effort to enable him to appear tolerably
                     cheerful when he met his father. At a late hour he returned to his room,<pb
                        n="248-249" xml:id="VAC6361-00000125"/> and it was long ere he was
                     sufficiently composed to sleep; and such sleep! the heavy locks of hair, damp
                     and clinging to his forehead, a flush on each cheek, burning like a torch, and
                     the breath passing rapidly from parched and feverish lips. Sleep that comes to
                     the wretched from which they are glad to awake, long as the slumber often is.
                     The sound of footsteps in the room, at an early hour, awoke him. Thomas was
                     standing by the bed, with a note in his hand. He handed it, saying Mrs.
                     Morton's servant requested him to deliver it without delay.</p>
                  <p>Arthur tore it open, and found in it a few lines from Ada that invigorated him
                     more than his long sleep. Ada bade him hope, though everything seemed against
                     them. Her mother had forbidden anything like a correspondence between them, and
                     Ada felt unwilling to contend with her; but she entreated Arthur not to
                     despond, but to leave their destinies in the hand of God, before whom the
                     sparrow could not fall unnoticed.</p>
                  <p>Arthur hurriedly prepared for his journey. He saw plainly his path of duty.
                     Everything must yield to the consideration for his father's health and comfort.
                     He could not bear to think he was divided from Ada; he could not realize the
                     scene of last evening, to be told he must give her up! This cloud must pass on,
                     he said to himself. Hope was busy in his heart, for he was young.</p>

                  </epigraph>
                  <p>DURING the year and a half that followed Mr. Mason's removal to New York, he
                     passed the time in a round of pleasure and excitement. Thus, some try to crush
                     the memory of the past. Every work of art that was exhibited in the city
                     interested him for the time; he lost no opportunity of indulging his passion
                     for music; he frequented the theatre, and every place that promised
                     intellectual enjoyment. It seemed impossible for him to pass contentedly a
                     quiet evening at home. His mind, in shaking off its gloom, grasped every new
                     delight; the chambers of his soul, swept and garnished, were better prepared
                     for new occupants.</p>
                  <p>The name of his wife never passed his lips; but by the sadness that overcame
                     him when illness or<pb n="250-251" xml:id="VAC6361-00000126"/> inclement
                     weather detained him at his hotel, Arthur knew she was not forgotten.</p>
                  <p>As the months wore on, Mr. Mason's attacks of illness became very frequent, and
                     Arthur was never content to be away from him; for this reason, he was often
                     seen in places for which, by his religious profession, as well as from want of
                     inclination, he was unfitted. Yet many of the pleasures that were so attractive
                     to his father were enjoyed by him, too, and none more than the good acting he
                     sometimes saw. The representation of a play should be an innocent pleasure, and
                     it is to be deplored that the theatre is so managed as to debar those who so
                     much enjoy the drama from an entrance.</p>
                  <p>There were two subjects of conversation interdicted between Mr. Mason and his
                     son, the state of his pecuniary affairs and religion. Arthur saw it was useless
                     to attempt to induce his father to return to Alabama, or to lessen the great
                     expense at which they were living in New York. Mr. Mason declared himself
                     satisfied with his agent, and continued to draw upon him for large sums of
                     money for present expenditure, although Arthur frequently intimated to him the
                     necessity of looking into his affairs; but he showed a morbid sensibility about
                     them, and said it was impossible that they were living beyond their means. When
                     Arthur would speak of the plantation, or of their servants, his father would
                     declare it would kill him to see his desolate home again, and he appeared to
                     have lost the interest that he had always felt in the welfare of his
                     dependants. And, for the subject that was nearest Arthur's heart, that of
                     religion, he confessed a distaste for it, and sometimes intimated a doubt of
                     its self-evident truths. Arthur knew there was no such being on God's earth as
                     an infidel; there is the fool that <emph>says</emph> in his heart there is no
                     God. Arming himself against the Creator, he would deny the first great claim
                     that He has upon his creatures, that of having formed them. The
                        <emph>fool</emph> toys with the idea that he will return to the chaos of
                     being from whence he sprung, but there are times when he knows there is a God.
                     Yet Arthur was forced to consult his father's feelings, and avoid religious
                     subjects, for opposition so unnerved and excited him as to threaten, and
                     sometimes to produce serious illness; he could only hope and pray, yet always
                     with an anxious heart. In the mean time, his own health continued as good or
                     better than it ever had been, and though sometimes painfully depressed in
                     spirits, he thought he saw plainly the path of duty, and endeavored to follow
                     it.</p>
                  <p>He had written to Mrs. Morton and to Ada; the former returned his letter
                     unopened, with the request that all intercourse should cease between them, and
                     Ada wrote him that she was very unhappy<pb n="252-253"
                        xml:id="VAC6361-00000127"/> happy, for her mother's determination to
                     separate them seemed unchanged, and that while Arthur might be assured of the
                     continuance of her affection, she could give him no other word of
                     encouragement.</p>
                  <p>Towards the close of their second winter in New York, Mr. Mason's health failed
                     rapidly; the excitement and fatigue of the life he led was wearing him out. His
                     disease proved to be an organic affection of the heart, and, at times, his
                     sufferings were very great. No longer able to go out for amusement, he depended
                     entirely on his son's society. Books afforded him no pleasure, though a great
                     part of his life had been passed in reading. How deep is the shadow that lies
                     over the close of that man's life who knows not God. Happiness cannot live in
                     such a presence, and genius that has arrayed itself against the Infinite,
                     flies, a coward, at the advance of death. Hope, that flutters so long, falls to
                     the ground. Affection alone clings to the sufferer.</p>
                  <p>Arthur never wearied of his charge. He was patient and gentle as a woman. He
                     conversed cheerfully with the invalid, or read, when he was in a condition to
                     listen. He performed every office that love could suggest, and while his hands
                     were busy in some act of love, his heart was fully occupied, not exclusively
                     with himself. His own interests he had given to the keeping of the Saviour, and
                     he tried to have no care for the morrow. But, whither was wending the soul of
                     his father? Each day his body grew more feeble; the attending physicians, in
                     answer to his inquiries, replied that their skill might only avail to relieve
                     pain; there could be no recovery.</p>
                  <p>The shadow of death was falling towards him; he saw it rest on his father's
                     changed countenance and emaciated limbs. Oh! it was now that God's hand seemed
                     so heavily laid. Sweet were the tears that he wept as he kissed, for the last
                     time, his mother's lips, compared with those he so often shed now! Light was
                     the parting with Ada, when he thought of another parting, awaiting him.
                     Valueless was the wealth that he knew he had lost, when he estimated the price
                     of that soul that was rushing, all unprepared, to its final destiny. With what
                     sorrow he saw his father turn away from the Bible that he sometimes laid in his
                     way!</p>
                  <p>Where, he often asked himself, was the answer to his sainted mother's prayers,
                     offered in behalf of one she so dearly loved? and how he waited and hoped for
                     an answer to his own. Sometimes he would almost despair, fearing God had
                     forgotten to be gracious, and that his father's eternity was to be
                        passed—<emph>was never to pass</emph>.—in woe unutterable. He struggled
                     against such a foreboding, and looked up, ever from his heart arising the
                     earnest petition—"Christ, who loved, suffered, and died, take from me all
                        else<pb n="254-255" xml:id="VAC6361-00000128"/> of this world's good, but
                     spare my father until he be reconciled, through thy blood, unto God;" and
                     seeing how short the time might be, he could no longer restrain his entreaties
                     that his father would allow him to read the Scriptures to him—that he would
                     listen to his prayers, unworthy as they were. On rising from his knees by that
                     sick bed, he would feel an assurance that his prayers were heard, and although
                     the subject of them never, by word or act, encouraged him to continue, yet he
                     ceased to make opposition.</p>
                  <p>The weather, during the last two months of Mr. Mason's illness, and of his
                     life, was very severe; and he suffered so much that some one was constantly
                     required to be near, to attend to him. The Masons had many kind friends among
                     the southerners who had become residents of New York; they offered to relieve
                     Arthur in his office of nurse, at night, that he might rest. But Mr. Mason
                     always became restless when his son was out of sight, and Arthur could rarely
                     be persuaded to leave him. He had the assistance of a most faithful and useful
                     man-servant, and this was all that he desired. At night, Arthur laid on a
                     lounge near his father's bed, ready to get up at the slightest word, and only
                     sleeping at such times as the attendant could sit up and watch for him.</p>

                  <p>IT was towards midnight, on the Sabbath, and Arthur, resting in an arm-chair,
                     was reviewing the incidents of the past day. In the morning he had attended
                     service at Trinity Church, and was refreshed and encouraged in his patient
                     waiting on God's mercy, by the reception of the Holy Communion. His thoughts
                     wandered from the altar where he had knelt, to Calvary, where the Divine Man
                     was expiring, in agony, on the Cross. Vividly, as if he had been an
                     eye-witness, did that scene picture itself before his mental vision. The
                     fearful signs in the elements; the fierce fury of the soldiers; the
                     lamentations of the women; but above all, the sufferings of the victim! Arthur
                     saw, in fancy, the deep shades of death, as they darkened beneath the closing
                        eyes<pb n="256-257" xml:id="VAC6361-00000129"/> and pale lips of Jesus; the
                     pallor, as it settled over brow and limb; the dampness of death, matting the
                     locks that pressed the brow; the crown of thorns; the drops of blood that
                     exuded from the pores of the skin, in the awful struggle with the King of
                     Terrors. He fancied the nerves of the mouth to compress around the lips, so
                     white, from mortal suffering, the muscles of the arm to relax, and the grasp of
                     the hands to loosen; those hands from which blood had dripped, but was now
                     settling, where pierced the cruel nails; he almost heard the last sigh—"It is
                     finished." Arthur seemed to be in a dream, and darkness spread before his eyes,
                     as it had, at the crucifixion, folded its wings over the earth. Yet he could
                     see the face of Jesus, and it was lovely; like the countenance of an infant
                     that has passed from earth ere it rebelled against God. That still figure! that
                     quiet face! how placid the Saviour looked, though fastened to the Cross. Arthur
                     dashed a tear from his eye, and read in the expression of the martyred God,
                     such hope as he had never felt before Rousing himself, he looked upon his
                     father's face, as if he hoped there to see the peaceful reflection of the
                     vision that he had been contemplating. That look brought him back to his great
                     sorrow. While he stood contemplating with anguish the worn features, his father
                     suddenly woke up, and called him with a trembling voice.</p>
                  <p>He hastened to the bedside, and, holding his hand between his own, asked him
                     what he should do for him.</p>
                  <p>"Nothing, nothing, my son. But I have been much agitated—I have been dreaming
                     of your mother—and—"</p>
                  <p>Seeing his father's nervous excitement, Arthur tried, by gentle words, to
                     soothe him. "Try and compose yourself, my dear father," he said, "something
                     disturbed you, and you are hardly awake."</p>
                  <p>But the thin hands continued to tremble, and the heart beat audibly, while on
                     the sick man's forehead glittered great drops of perspiration. The wandering
                     eyes settled upon Arthur, and the expression of horror passed away, while one
                     of intense awe remained.</p>
                  <p>"Arthur," said Mr. Mason, "I have had a frightful dream. Great God! if it
                     should indeed be so."</p>
                  <p>"It was but a dream," said Arthur; "compose yourself to sleep again."</p>
                  <p>"A dream," said Mr. Mason musingly. "No, no," he added, with energy, "it was—it
                     is a reality. Oh! Arthur, I almost wish I <emph>were</emph> an infidel. Eternal
                     vengeance is sure enough, yet I must anticipate it. That fearful dream!"</p>
                  <p>"To-morrow you will tell it to me," said Arthur. "But now it is better for you
                     not to talk. I will sit by you, while you try to sleep."</p>
                  <pb n="258-259" xml:id="VAC6361-00000130"/>
                  <p>"I dreamed," said Mr. Mason, as if not hearing what his son said, "that we were
                     at home, and that you and I were standing on the porch that is overhung with
                     sweet-brier. It was night, a night of serene splendor; innumerable stars
                     glistened in the heavens, and the moonlight played upon every object before us.
                     All was quiet, until softly the voices of the servants broke upon us, singing
                     in their cabins. The air was one I have often heard at their camp meetings. Old
                     Thomas was their leader. I never heard anything so sweet as their voices
                     sounded in my dream. The hymn died away, and it was silent as before, until you
                     said, 'These slaves must here hold communion with God, or there could not be so
                     much harmony in their songs of praise.' Then I answered, 'It is very well for
                     slaves to sing about God and Heaven, and Hell, but for men whose intellect has
                     been cultivated, whose reason is their best guide, such occupations are a waste
                     of time.' Hardly had I said this, when there was a total change in the scene
                     upon which I had been looking. The moon and stars disappeared, and darkness
                     spread before us. I tried to move to where you were standing, but the black
                     darkness frightened me, so that I was afraid to stir. We stood, for a minute
                     without speaking, when suddenly, from the east, we saw advancing towards us, a
                     mass of lurid light, a creature Whose form and motion resembled that of a
                     serpent as it travelled over the waves, mounting and descending. It came on,
                     casting a fearful light by the way; rapidly it gained upon us, until clothed in
                     a frightful sublimity, it swam above our heads.</p>
                  <p>"Then we heard cries of terror and dismay; the servants and neighbors were wild
                     with alarm, and in the confusion, they ran about, not knowing one from the
                     other. But I heard a cry above it all. Some voice shrieked out, 'It is the
                     judgment! O God! it is the judgment.'</p>
                  <p>"Arthur! there was no fear on your countenance, but a look of tranquil peace
                     rested there, and Thomas came towards me with a beaming expression of joy upon
                     his face. He said to me, 'Ah master! the day that you did not look for has
                     come. The Lord Jesus has a safe hiding-place for the poor slave, but how will
                     it be with you?' I looked round for you, but could not see you, and I seemed to
                     be alone.</p>
                  <p>"Again the sky was cloudless, and in the cerulean blue of night glittered the
                     quiet stars. My foot touched a ladder, and when I looked up, I saw it reached
                     the heavens. A voice near me said, 'Go up, and learn the destiny of that man
                     who worships Reason before God.' I looked to the sky, which the ladder seemed
                     to enter, and my sight reeled with the number of steps that I could not count.
                     Yet I<pb n="260-261" xml:id="VAC6361-00000131"/> sprang forward, impatient to
                     know what was to become of me. I ascended, continually looking up, until I
                     thought I had passed the region of the clouds. Then, music of such strange
                     sweetness stole upon my ear that I could but stop to listen. I caught the
                     words, 'Worthy is the Lamb that was slain.' Even now, I seem to catch the
                     cadence of the harp, whose swelling notes guided the singers. I strained my
                     eyes, hoping to see something of the glory that was intimated by the radiance
                     in the surrounding ether.</p>
                  <p>"Suddenly, from that brightness a form emerged, and instantly I recognized your
                     mother. She came forward, and seated herself on the highest step of the ladder.
                     The beauty of her earliest youth had been restored to her, and she had caught
                     from the glorious light of heaven a ray that rested on her brow, and made it
                     too dazzling for my vision.</p>
                  <p>"'Mary,' I said, 'I know you have been with angels; but I, without you, have
                     wandered away from all good. Am I to go with you now, that we may never more be
                     separated?'</p>
                  <p>"'You cannot come,' she said, sadly. 'The worship of the world never led man to
                     God. The conditions of salvation were offered you, and you refused them; you
                     cannot enter into the glory that I have seen. Never will that man who sneered
                     at the cross of Christ see the God whom he has thus denied.'</p>
                  <p>"Then she turned from me, and I awoke. Thank God, Arthur, that I am still
                     permitted to see your kind face! Oh, how I have suffered, through hours of
                     pain, from the dread of an avenging God!"</p>

                  <p>"LET me send for Mr. Taylor, dear father," said Arthur, some days afterwards;
                     "you will be interested in his conversation. You have always admired him as a
                     scholar and a man of genius. I want you to talk with him on those great
                     subjects in which we all are so much interested. It is his vocation gently to
                     lead to Christ the souls that Christ has called."</p>
                  <p>"But has he called <emph>me?</emph>" said Mr. Mason.</p>
                  <p>"He has—he has," said Arthur, "if you will only hear him. So often he has
                     called you. By the teachings of your pious mother; by the prosperity and
                     enjoyment of your early years; by the unclouded happiness of your married life;
                     by the holy and consistent deportment of her who was so dear to us both; by her
                     calm and beautiful departure from earth; by the memory of her entreaties and
                     prayers; by the pains and weakness of disease; and now by the fearful looking
                     for a judgment to come—God's spirit has so often knocked at your heart—will you
                     not open the door, that he may enter in? Good angels have sorrowed by your side

                     to drag you down to hopeless misery. But if Satan would draw you to hell, God
                     is calling you to heaven. Oh, what joy is there in heaven when one sinner
                     repents!"</p>
                  <p>"Remember," said Mr. Mason, "that in my dream my doom was told."</p>
                  <p>"Yes," said Arthur, "<emph>in your dream</emph>. Let the dream go; it has done
                     its work. It has softened your heart by the memory of my mother; it has alarmed
                     you by the suggestion of a fearful future. This dream was sent, as dreams are
                        <emph>sometimes</emph>, from God; it was a message from heaven. The Mary of
                     your dream, that was the love of your youth and your manhood, may be permitted
                     to minister to your hours of languor and of pain. Oh, it will not be in
                     vain!"</p>
                  <p>"But, Arthur, so many objections, so many doubts arise!"</p>
                  <p>"Close your heart against them all. Let reason and learning go; what are they
                     in the sight of God?<pb n="264-265" xml:id="VAC6361-00000133"/> Come to the
                     Cross. Your sins are, as you have acknowledged them, great. God has them
                     recorded in a book against you. Believe in Christ, and they shall be wiped out
                     from the great account. Let me kneel down and pray, you joining me in asking of
                     God, mercy through Christ."</p>
                  <p>"I cannot pray," said Mr. Mason, in a voice that was almost a whisper; "I dare
                     not. The past, a long life of rebellion, comes up before me; the future—but one
                     moment, and then eternity."</p>
                  <p>"Seize then the one moment. How many lost souls sigh for one moment. There is
                     no <emph>too late</emph> with God, until the grave has claimed its own. It was
                     not <emph>too late</emph> for the thief on the cross. Like him, believe, and
                     cry out, Remember me."</p>
                  <p>"But Arthur! <emph>he saw</emph> the Lord Jesus."</p>
                  <p>"And you may see him now, by faith, as evidently as he with mortal sight.
                     Blessed are they who, not having seen, believe."</p>
                  <p>The thin hands were crossed upon the breast, and Arthur assumed the attitude of
                     prayer. Oh! it was prayer that went up to God from that room, prayer uttered by
                     the lips of the son, by the heart of the parent, no other mortal hearing.
                     Behold, he prays! Angels bear the tidings to their home, and they pass from
                     cherubim to seraphim. Behold, he prays! and fallen spirits, the unredeemed,
                     descend to their abode and mingle their disappointed cries with the curses of
                     the Prince of darkness. Joyous are the echoes that are filling every arch of
                     heaven, and full of horror are the reverberations to which the lost are
                     listening in each cavern of hell.</p>

                  <p>AND now there is no more doubting, no more fear. Christ has again heard a
                     voice, "Lord remember me." Again he has answered, "To-day thou shalt be with
                     me."</p>
                  <p>But there is suffering; that poor feeble frame must undergo the pangs of
                     dissolution. Casting off its companion, the soul must go forth, alone. Oh! the
                     curse of sin! of death! to disunite what God once joined together. The curse—to
                     part what is so closely knit together, that God will once more bring about a
                     re-union, though he seek for the decayed, separated, dissolved particles of
                     mortality in the ground, on the rock, in the depths of the great sea, in the
                     winds, in a chaos, like that from which, at his voice, the earth emerged.</p>
                  <p>Once, the dying man said, "Arthur, I came at the eleventh hour."</p>
                  <p>"And they all received a penny a day," said Arthur. Then he opened the book and
                     read the beautiful parable, explaining it, and closing the explanation with
                     fervent prayer. On another occasion, he read, in his regular course, the
                     parable of the wise and foolish virgins. His father listened with intense
                     interest.</p>
                  <p>"And while they went to buy, the bridegroom came—"</p>
                  <p>"Stop, my son! While I go to buy, the bridegroom has come."</p>
                  <p>"He has not called for you; he has waited for you to buy. You have already
                     bought, without money and without price."</p>
                  <p>"Arthur! how awful is that verse—the door was shut."</p>
                  <p>"The Bible," said Arthur, "tells us of one deathbed repentance; that one was
                     accepted. You have not offered to buy with a false coin—you have bought with
                     the blood of Christ. That blood was not shed in vain, for one soul that trusts
                     in it."</p>

                           sea, and forming all around a chain of the deepest elemental ferment in
                           their rage. There, flashing desolation flares before the path of the
                           thunderclap. But thy messengers, Lord, respect the mild going of thy
                           day.</p>

                  </epigraph>
                  <p>WELL might a solemn stillness pervade that room. Within it, a soul was
                     stretching its wings, fluttering for immortality, but still heavily chained to
                     earth.</p>
                  <p>"Mr. Taylor will soon be here to administer the Holy Communion, my dear
                     father," said Arthur; "are you able to receive it?"</p>
                  <p>The smile that passed over the dying man's face was his expressive answer; it
                     was full of hope; peaceful and intelligent.</p>
                  <p>"Our old friend, Mr. Read, will be with him," said Arthur. "Is there anything
                     you would like me to do for you before they come?"</p>
                  <p>"Nothing," said Mr. Mason; "but, I am all unworthy to take even the name of
                     Christ within my lips; can I dare to eat his flesh and drink his blood? My son,
                     it is an awful mystery to feed spiritually on Christ."</p>
                  <p>"And yet," said Arthur, "can the branch live except it receive the means of
                     life from the vine? It was the command of Christ, that we should do this in
                     remembrance of him. A blessing will follow your obedience, and your desire to
                     honor him."</p>
                  <p>"Ah," said Mr. Mason, "how happy am I to be permitted to profess his name,
                     though at the last moment—when drawing to the close of my mortal life. The
                     retrospection of a lifetime of rebellion against God, presses upon me. Yet the
                     hope of salvation is priceless."</p>
                  <p>"And what will be the realizing of that hope?" said Arthur. "We toil for
                     earthly treasures in this life, but we forget the city whose streets are of
                     gold, and whose gates are of pearl." Then after a moment, he added, "What will
                     heaven be to you, dear father, after so much suffering? I wish I could go there
                     with you."</p>
                  <p>"There is one thought that oppresses me," said Mr. Mason; "were I relieved of
                     that, I should be done with earth. It is, that I have, through indolence and
                     extravagance, and neglect, impoverished you."</p>
                  <pb n="270-271" xml:id="VAC6361-00000136"/>
                  <p>"Let no such anxieties intrude upon you," said Arthur, hastily. "I require but
                     little, for my habits are not expensive. Leave me, and all that concerns me, to
                     God."</p>
                  <p>"Is there no hope of your marriage with Ada?" asked his father. "She will soon
                     be of age, and can dispose of herself. Will she feel it a duty then, to be
                     guided by her mother?"</p>
                  <p>"Ada is a Christian," said Arthur; "no doubt she will do what is right. All my
                     thoughts are for you now, for we must so soon be separated. I have no care for
                     my future, nor do I seek to know the Eternal will regarding myself. If
                     prosperity and happiness are mine, I will bless the Great Giver; if he bring
                     more sorrow, I am sure he will bring a consolation, as he does now. If the days
                     come dark, I must wait for the heavenly dawn. Let me read to you again, my dear
                     father, those lines that pleased you so much this morning."</p>
                  <p>Arthur opened a book that was lying on the table, and holding his father's
                     hand, he read:—</p>
                  <p>"But in God there is nothing finite; but in God there is nothing transitory;
                     but in God, there <emph>can</emph> be nothing that tends to death. Therefore,
                     it follows that for God there is no present. The future is the present of God,
                     and to the future it is that he sacrifices the human present. Therefore it is
                     that he works by earthquake—therefore it is that he works by grief. Oh! deep is
                     the ploughing of earthquake! Oh! deep (and his voice swelled like a sanctus
                     rising from a choir of a cathedral), oh! deep is the ploughing of grief! But
                     oftentimes, less would not suffice for the agriculture of God. Upon a night of
                     earthquake, he builds a thousand years of pleasant habitations for man; upon
                     the sorrow of an infant, he raises oftentimes, from human intellect, glorious
                     vintages that could not else have been. Less than these fierce ploughshares
                     would not have stirred the stubborn soil."</p>
                  <p>"So," said Arthur, closing the book, and pressing his lips upon the hand he
                     held, "we will leave the building up of our heavenly home to the Great
                     Architect, satisfied with what he does here, to make us fit to take
                     possession."</p>
                  <p>"But," said Mr. Mason, after a few moments' silence, "if you should be poor—if
                     I have done you this great wrong, will you forgive me?"</p>
                  <p>"How can you ask it?" replied Arthur; "but indeed, I will promise to forgive
                     you, and to love you, and to come to you some day, to that happy place, where
                     there will be no more partings."</p>
                  <p>Mr. Mason laid his hand upon his son's head. Well was it for both, in that
                     hour, that God denies to his children a knowledge of the future. Else, that
                     death bed had not been so peaceful at the last.</p>

                     emblems. Upon them, the streaming eyes of the sufferer are fixed. He views his
                     Saviour crucified. He has discovered the mystery, the understanding of which
                     has been denied to so many, because they sought it in the spirit of
                     controversy, and not with humility and faith.</p>
                  <p>He felt that Christ was there, though the bread and wine were unchanged. He
                     remembered, with awe, the saying, except ye eat my flesh, and drink my blood,
                     and he fed on those holy mysteries, by faith; on the body that was broken, the
                     blood that was shed for him. Dying mortal that he was, he knew that he should
                     live forever by that body and that blood. He felt that it was so, for Christ
                     had said it. He sank back on his pillow exhausted, murmuring the words to which
                     he had listened, "Preserve thy body and soul unto everlasting life." The tears
                     ceased to flow, and a ray of satisfaction gleamed over the emaciated face; the
                     eyes were raised to heaven, the lips closed, and all was silence.</p>
                  <p>Arthur's head was bowed in prayer as he leaned by the bed; the soft gas-light
                     fell on his tall figure and dark hair, and on the countenance of his old
                     friend, Mr. Read. It rested on the white forehead of the dying man.</p>
                  <p>There was no dying man there; there were the mortal garments, useless now, and
                     for a time to be thrown aside; the soul had fled. Oh, the dimness of earthly
                     vision, that the shining ones of God had not been seen when they entered and
                     departed! Oh, the dulness of earthly ears, that they heard not the unfolding of
                     their wings as they took flight with the ransomed spirit! They bore it up
                     "through the air, sweetly talking as they went; even to the gates they
                     conducted it." There it was clad in raiment that shone like gold.</p>

                  <p>FROM a death scene to a ball-room! But what transitions are there not in
                     life?</p>
                  <p>It was time for the guests to assemble, and Mrs. Elwyn had passed from the
                     reception to the drawing-room, to the conservatory, the supper-room, through
                     the splendid halls, up the winding staircase, to the rooms above. All must soon
                     be filled with admiring guests. She returned to the reception-room that her
                     husband had just entered; his usually grave face was animated as, looking
                     round, he commended his wife, who had superintended the arrangements. His look
                     congratulated her on her own appearance. Her hair, waving until it reached the
                     ear, passed from thence, in flowing curls, to the shoulder, where they rested.
                     Her dress, so costly, yet so simple, fitted exquisitely her perfect form, and
                     her cheeks were flushed with anticipation of pleasure. Her face was very
                     beautiful, and the grace of her person was displayed in every movement.</p>
                  <p>"Sophie," said Mr. Elwyn, "you have love-darting eyes, and tresses like the
                     morn."</p>
                  <p>"How did you ever come to be a merchant?" said she, in reply. "You are always
                     quoting poetry. But how do you like the rooms?"</p>
                  <p>Her husband surveyed the rooms, and again quoted poetry— <q>

                  <p>"Oh, how can you?" said Mrs. Elwyn. "When I am very happy, you have always
                     something gloomy to say. I wish every poet that ever lived were burned with his
                     own manuscripts!"</p>
                  <p>"Why burn the poets?" said Mr. Elwyn. "They do not make all the trouble in the
                     world; they only sing their own. Forgive me for talking so. I will try and
                     forget everything sad, at least until to-morrow. Put on your company face, oh,
                     'fair as the first that fell of womankind!' for I hear footsteps
                     ascending."</p>
                  <p>While the hours of night were waning away, brilliantly the light from
                     chandeliers fell upon the gay and beautiful that were assembled in those rooms.
                     There was no sound of riot or ill-managed merriment, but a subdued murmur of
                     delight passed<pb n="276-277" xml:id="VAC6361-00000139"/> from hall to hall.
                     Did all those hearts throb happiness? Why not? Behold the lavishment of wealth!
                     the thousand dollar dresses! the hundred dollar pocket-handkerchiefs! the
                     diamonds! the pearls! the curious, costly fans!</p>
                  <p>Was all as it seemed to be in this assemblage? Look at that young creature,
                     with her arm linked to that old man. See in his face the traces of a mis-spent
                     life! He is seventy; she is seventeen, and his wife! Is she not poor, with all
                     those jewels flashing on her person? Did she not barter her purity for the
                     diamonds that encircle her neck? Has she not laid her head on an unholy
                     pillow?</p>
                  <p>Near her, haughtily, but sorrowfully looking at her, is the one she deserted to
                     become what she is. Will the time come when she will weep for what she has cast
                     aside? Now, for she has just seen him, the color is fading from her cheek; a
                     memory that she wishes were dead is knocking at her heart. A day of reckoning
                        <emph>will come,</emph> for that she trampled under her feet her woman's
                     faith.</p>
                  <p>Oh, Fashion! Fashion! were all these hearts bared that now seem to beat in
                     unison. Oh, the fears, the concealments, the remorse, the despair, the sin, the
                     sorrow!</p>
                  <p>Come to the ball-room, and watch the dancers. Here you see the grace of youth.
                     Here is prostrated the dignity of age. Yet in the glaring light, how flash the
                     dancers' eyes, or how they languish in the splendor that brings with it such an
                     ecstasy. Come to the supper-room. How choice the viands! how keen the delight
                     of the epicure! The music-room is quiet now; only here murmur words of love,
                     and beating hearts forget that in such a scene Death is an uninvited guest. He
                     is here now, looking on the bright eyes, the fairy forms, marking the flushed
                     cheek and languid step, laughing at the props that age has borrowed from art,
                     counting his victims. There are those here upon whose soft cheek the worm will
                     soon banquet.</p>
                  <p>"These pleasures end in delusion."</p>

                  <p>IT was the afternoon of the day following the ball. Mrs. Elwyn left her bed,
                     exhausted with fatigue, for she was so excited when she laid down by the
                     morning light, that it was impossible for her to sleep. Yet she was elated with
                     the complete success of her entertainment, with the admirable manner in which
                     everything had passed off. She closed her aching eyes, and the glasses with
                     their ruby wine, the costly bouquets, the gold and silver, still passed before
                     her, in array. Melodious music broke upon her troubled rest, whispered
                     compliments were re-uttered in her waking dreams. There was no sleep for her,
                     though she continued nearly all day in bed, hoping to induce it. So she got up,
                     and after a careless toilet left her dressing-room for the boudoir. Everything
                     here was beautiful too, everything thing in expensive but perfect taste. On a
                     marble table was a bouquet, for which one hundred dollars had been paid, to
                     adorn the centre piece of the supper-table the night before; thence it had been
                     transferred here.</p>
                  <p>Mr. Elwyn was lying on a lounge, and by him was standing a lovely child of
                     three years, who had not seen its mother that day.</p>
                  <p>"You here, George," Mrs. Elwyn exclaimed, as she threw herself upon an opposite
                     couch. "What has brought you home so early?" She could say no more, for the
                     child's arms were around her neck, and the pure kisses of infancy closed her
                     lips. Mr. Elwyn languidly replied that he did not feel well.</p>
                  <p>"I am not really ill," he added, "but I am disappointed."</p>
                  <p>"About what?" she asked.</p>
                  <p>"It has been eight months, Sophie," Mr. Elwyn said, "since Mr. Mason's death;
                     and Arthur, a few days after, returned to Alabama to find his father's
                     property, or, what remained of it, in the hands of Johnson the agent, and some
                     other speculators. Mr. Mason's expenditures here, his neglect of business
                     matters, and the dishonesty of his agent, have resulted in Arthur's being left
                     without a cent. The plantation and negroes have been sold to meet debts,
                     whether just or not, I cannot say. Arthur has<pb n="280-281"
                        xml:id="VAC6361-00000141"/> been accustomed to consider himself rich; what
                     will he do with his delicate health and refined tastes?"</p>
                  <p>"How did you hear about it?" asked Mrs. Elwyn.</p>
                  <p>"Through Mr. James Read," Mr. Elwyn replied, "who is now in New York, taking
                     every means to find some clue to Arthur's present residence. Yesterday, Mr.
                     Read came to my office, to talk to me about it. When Arthur got home, he did
                     not pretend to dispute the claims of his father's creditors, though he was
                     shocked to see that some men, that he had thought honest, were connected in
                     business with the agent. He was distressed, too, at parting with the old
                     servants; he told Mr. Read that had he been certain they were passing into good
                     hands, he would have cared, comparatively, very little. He was very calm and
                     quiet in all his interviews with Johnson; in fact, he saw it would be of no use
                     to contend. Ada <emph>would</emph> see him, though Mrs. Morton made a great
                     many objections, and was very rude. Ada told him of her grief, that everything
                     seemed against him, but she said her mother was so violently opposed to her
                     marriage, that she would not hear his name mentioned, though at the same time,
                     she declared she considered herself as much bound to Arthur as ever. Ada was
                     very foolish to give up to her mother so, for Mrs. Morton is a very selfish and
                     unreasonable woman. However, Arthur could not press his marriage then, for he
                     knew he could not support a wife."</p>
                  <p>" Ada will have enough for both," said Mrs. Elwyn.</p>
                  <p>" Yes," her husband said, "but Mrs. Morton, like most of those who have toiled
                     to be rich, hates a poor man. Poor Ada! it was a sad interview. Mr. Read says
                     she cried terribly when she told him of it."</p>
                  <p>"How do they know Arthur is in New York?" said Mrs. Elwyn.</p>
                  <p>"He told Ada that he should come here, and avail himself of his education for
                     his support. But before he left home, he had a hemorrhage, and he looked most
                     wretchedly when he started. Since then, nothing has been heard of him, and Ada
                     is miserable. She begged Mr. Read to make every effort to find him, that she
                     might write to him. I have no doubt she already repents giving up to her
                     mother's notions, for, as Mrs. Morton sanctioned the engagement in the first
                     place, she had no right to break it without a just reason. Ada has some
                     property, independent of her mother, and after a year or two she must be very
                     rich. But, at any rate, I am most anxious to hear something of Arthur."</p>
                  <p>"Well, you can't help it," said Mrs. Elwyn, "it is of no use worrying."</p>
                  <pb n="282-283" xml:id="VAC6361-00000142"/>
                  <p>"It is certainly my duty to do everything in my power to find Arthur out, and
                     to assist him. His father was the best friend I ever had. When my own father
                     died, Mr. Mason continued me at the school where I was, and offered me a
                     college education. I owe him everything; for my prospects at one time were
                     little better than Arthur's are now; the death of my aunt, just before I left
                     school, changed them. Besides, Sophie! you have always known Arthur, and must
                     feel interested in him. How much he has suffered from ill health, and how
                     delicately he has been nurtured! There never was a more perfectly upright and
                     honorable young man; and he has fine talents; the worst of it is, he is so
                     sensitive. Only think, at this moment he may be ill, and in want."</p>
                  <p>"Want!" said Mrs. Elwyn;" how can you talk so? Arthur Mason in want!"</p>
                  <p>"Why not?" said her husband; "he has no money, I am sure; and he is in wretched
                     health. You think because he was once rich, he cannot be poor. How little you
                     know of life, Sophie! How ignorant you are of what is passing in your own city!
                     Is poverty always clothed in rags? Every day, I see men who were once rich, and
                     are now poor. The very worst sort of poverty is genteel poverty. In New York
                     society, it is a crime to be poor; guilt is more readily forgiven than penury.
                     The sin of yesterday day is pardoned to the scoundrel who rides in a gilded
                     coach, and offers his guests sumptuous wines. But to be poor is to be
                     forgotten."</p>
                  <p>" I do believe, George," said Mrs. Elwyn, with a yawn, "that you are getting
                     religious. What a sermon you have preached!"</p>
                  <p>"I wish I were a Christian," said he; "Arthur Mason is; my father was, too; and
                     I sometimes fancy I hear him talking to me, as he and my mother often did. But
                     I believe I have preached you to sleep."</p>
                  <p>The wife languidly opened her eyes, and then closed them. The story of the
                     probable sufferings of another, had had the effect of a pleasant song. With her
                     head on her hand, she sank into a deep repose. Mr. Elwyn kissed his little
                     daughter, who had sat on an ottoman by him, during the conversation with her
                     mother. He thought of a verse; it was—"She that liveth in pleasure, is dead
                     while she lives."</p>

                  <p>SOME weeks passed, without any information of Arthur being obtained; though Mr.
                     Read and Mr. Elwyn hunted up all his old friends, making frequent inquiries at
                     the hotel where he and Mr. Mason had boarded. From the proprietor of the hotel,
                     they learned that Arthur had left a valuable watch with him, saying it had
                     consumed his present means to defray his father's funeral expenses, and that he
                     would leave the watch until he could redeem it by paying what he owed for
                     board. The value of the watch was more than the debt incurred, but Arthur had
                     never returned to claim it; nor could any reason be given for his silence, but
                     that, being unable to pay the debt, he left the watch instead. This thought
                     increased the anxiety of his friends; the watch had belonged to Mr. Mason, and
                     Arthur's pride and affection would have united to induce him to redeem a pledge
                     that had only been offered through the greatest necessity.</p>
                  <p>Other, and startling tidings, had reached the Elwyns, from the south. Ada had
                     become her own mistress; death, sudden and terrible, had relieved her from her
                     mother's unnatural tyranny. Ada bowed in submission to this awful dispensation,
                     but there was little hope or consolation in such a death. Increasing anxiety
                     for Arthur assisted to rouse her from the violence of her grief. The thought
                     that he too might be dead, was overwhelming. She could not brave the
                     possibility, and she determined to accompany some friends who were about to
                     visit New York, that she might unite her efforts to those of her friends, in
                     the hope of learning the fate of one so dear to her. Arthur had promised to
                     inform her if successful in whatever he might undertake.</p>
                  <p>"And if not successful, Arthur," Ada said, "will you not write to me? if I
                     cannot disobey my mother and unite my fate to yours, at least let me know of
                     your health and prospects. If you do not succeed, will you be too proud to let
                     me aid you?"</p>
                  <p>In reply, Arthur smiled and looked upwards; then said, "If not successful,
                     sweet Ada, remember— <q>
                        <lg type="quotation">

                  <p>Ada wept at the remembrance of this little incident. At the time, she was so
                     absorbed in the grief of parting with him, she did not consider its full
                     import, but now she feared she understood it too well. They might not meet
                     again on earth. This, she thought, was its interpretation. "God forbid!" she
                     exclaimed, in the bitterness of her heart, when she spoke of it to Mr. Read.
                     "What is all this wealth to me if he is dead?"</p>
                  <p>When Mr. Elwyn heard of her intention to come to New York, he wrote to her that

                     her in the nursery, with her beautiful child in her arms. Nothing made him so
                     happy as to see her thus occupied, for though he loved her dearly, he could not
                     fail to see and lament the self-indulgence, the indolence, the fashionable
                     folly in which her life passed. What so likely to entice her away from these as
                     the affectionate caresses of her child? He stood for a moment looking at them,
                     without speaking. The little girl was resting her fair head against her
                     mother's bosom, and with one arm and hand, she was trying to encircle her
                     mother's waist. Sophie was singing, rocking slightly as she sung.</p>
                  <p>The song was finished too soon, and when it<pb n="288-289"
                        xml:id="VAC6361-00000145"/> stopped, Sophie said, "Get down, darling; kiss
                     mamma, and go to Jane."</p>
                  <p>"Oh, no, sweet mamma!" the child answered. "One more song."</p>
                  <p>"Tomorrow, but I must go now," said Sophie, withdrawing the little arm that was
                     clinging to her.</p>
                  <p>"Take her, Jane; I must go. I dine out to-day, and I have not decided what I
                     shall wear."</p>
                  <p>"Sophie," said Mr. Elwyn, "stay at home to-day. Take your baby, and sing to
                     her, and we will dine quietly together."</p>
                  <p>"Impossible!" she replied. "Don't ask me. Lent commences to-morrow, and we
                     shall be dull enough. Mrs. Davis told me, to-day, that people were to be
                     unusually religious this season. <emph>She</emph> does not intend going to any
                     parties, and has stopped her receptions. Emily Davis was trying to dissuade her
                     mother from doing so, but her mother said, 'My dear, you are not a member of
                     the church; you can go where you choose, and your father will attend you.' But
                     turning to me, she added, 'I never have any peace in Lent, for Mr. Davis hates
                     parties, and because he has to go with Emily, he is in a bad humor from Ash
                     Wednesday until Easter."'</p>
                  <p>Mr. Elwyn laughed out. "Poor Davis!" he said. "With his wife's fashion and
                     religion, he is offered up a daily sacrifice at the domestic altar. But,
                     Sophie! stay at home to-day. I have just had a letter from Ada Morton. She is
                     miserable about Arthur. She may come now at any time. I am expecting her every
                     day."</p>
                  <p>"Well, I have no objection," said Sophie; "but I can't stay at home to-day. If
                     you don't want to go, I can send for Count Almonski; he offered to go with
                     me."</p>
                  <p>"No," said her husband; "if you will go, I will go, too. I have all confidence
                     in your affection, but you are too young and beautiful a woman to go into
                     society under the protection of a stranger."</p>
                  <p>As he spoke, the little girl quitted his side, where she had stood from the
                     moment that she saw him come in. Running over to her mother, she raised her
                     lovely little face, and said, "Please, mamma, stay with us."</p>
                  <p>There was no relenting in the heart of the woman of fashion; she gayly laughed,
                     and said, "No, no! let me go." She pushed the little child gently away from
                     her, and then tripped from the room to her own, where she was soon absorbed in
                     the important question, "What shall I wear?"</p>
                  <p>Had it always been so? No. Sophie had married from affection. When Mr. Elwyn
                     brought her to New York, all the world was nothing to her, compared to his
                     love. But a life of ease, an indulgent and too yielding husband, unlimited
                        command<pb n="290-291" xml:id="VAC6361-00000146"/> of money, great
                     admiration; these had wrought the change in her. This is the history of many a
                     woman. Nor does it stop here. The chains of pleasure bind so closely the
                     affections to the world that only God can loose them.</p>

                  <p>ADA came to New York, and her society was a great pleasure to Mr. Elwyn, in the
                     short intervals of time that he could pass at home. Lately, home had seemed
                     very pleasant to him, for the gay season was over, and, as Mrs. Davis said,
                     people were unusually religious this year, and Sophie had not many inducements
                     to go out in the evening. So that on Mr. Elwyn's return to a late dinner, he
                     generally found Ada with a pale sad face, the little Nannie in her lap; and
                     Sophie, who was really very good natured, when no one interfered with her,
                     doing all in her power to amuse her visiter. Sophie's beauty and graceful
                     manners made her home, in her husband's eyes, as bright as if a sunbeam lived
                     there.</p>
                  <p>Mrs. Elwyn was one of those persons who are too easily influenced; she had not
                     strength of mind to<pb n="292-293" xml:id="VAC6361-00000147"/> resist. Had she
                     stayed at the South, after her marriage, she would, probably, have been all
                     that her husband wished her to be. In New York, the temptations to a life of
                     pleasure were many, and she yielded to them. There was no one to point out the
                     dangerous rocks that lay in her course; it was a fair sea over which her bark
                     was sailing, and prosperous gales wafted her along. She did not see the cloud
                     at a distance, no bigger than a man's hand, for rapturous music intoxicated her
                     senses. Like Ada, she was an orphan, but she had not had the advantage of the
                     religious instruction and influence that Ada in her childhood received, in
                     common with Arthur, from Mrs. Mason. She had been brought up in a family of
                     formalists, whose dull way of life and long prayers had had the effect of
                     turning her away from the love of a religious life. The very church where her
                     guardians had worshipped, she hated to enter. It was a great unseemly building,
                     with bare walls, and large, unfurnished windows. How delighted she was, when
                     for the first time, she <emph>worshipped</emph> in Grace Church, New York.
                     "This is religion indeed," she said, as she sank back in her luxurious pew,
                     pushed the velvet cushions up to support her back, and rested her feet on an
                     ottoman. The fine singing charmed her. She never thought of engaging in the
                     service, she had too much to look at. As she rode home, she told her husband
                     there was some comfort in praying to God in a decent church; it was a real
                     pleasure to be where everything was so nice and stylish.</p>
                  <p>Mr. Elwyn's disposition was naturally religious. There are some men, who,
                     without possessing enthusiasm of sentiment, are inclined to the consideration
                     of the mysteries of their nature. Such characters are gentle and affectionate,
                     and often possess a strength of will and firmness of purpose, that repose, for
                     a time, so quietly, that no one dreams they are there. It was so with Mr.
                     Elwyn; added to these characteristics, there lay in his heart memories that a
                     word and sometimes a look would arouse. Early in life as he had lost his
                     parents, he could now repeat the "Divine songs" they had taught him. There were
                     a few verses of Scripture, the hearing of which, in the services of the church,
                     would so affect him, that tears would start into his eyes. For now, only in
                     church did he hear discussed the themes that were the first that engaged his
                     mind. In the world—in the counting-room, in the gay assembly, or in his
                     luxurious home, God was never spoken of. How natural, then, that Ada's deep
                     sorrow, gentle submission, and fervent piety should so attract him, and he
                     hoped that his wife might be influenced by an association that was so pleasant
                     to him.</p>

                  <p>VISITERS had just left the drawing-room, and Mrs. Elwyn remained among the
                     velvet cushions, and was looking at herself reflected in an opposite mirror,
                     when a servant came in and told her that Mr. Arthur Mason desired a few
                     moments' conversation with her.</p>
                  <p>"Arthur Mason!" she said, in the greatest surprise, "and why don't you ask him
                     in?"</p>
                  <p>"I did," the servant answered, "but he won't come up. He says he is not well,
                     and is afraid of meeting company, so he hopes you will see him in the
                     sitting-room below. He looks very sick, madam; I would not have known him but
                     for his voice."</p>
                  <p>"Tell him I will be there in a moment; but John, if Mrs. Le Roche calls, come
                     right in and tell me, for I have an engagement with her at two o'clock."</p>
                  <p>Mrs. Elwyn hurried down to see Arthur, but she stopped short when she came into
                     the room where he was, there was so remarkable a change in his appearance. She
                     could not help expressing her astonishment, at first, but from politeness,
                     restrained herself after a moment, though Arthur's excessive weakness and
                     emaciation were calculated to call forth not only sympathy, but surprise. She
                     gave him her hand and welcomed him with kindness, and then asked him where in
                     the world he had been hiding himself for so long a time.</p>
                  <p>"In New York," said Arthur; "I have been here ever since my visit to
                     Alabama."</p>
                  <p>"But why haven't you been to see us? Mr. Elwyn has been so anxious about you,
                     and has been inquiring about you in every direction."</p>
                  <p>"I have been ill for a long time," said Arthur; "for several months, those with
                     whom I lived despaired of my life; though better now, I am very feeble. I
                     called at Mr. Elwyn's counting-room this morning, but he was not there; I hoped
                     to find him at home. John tells me he is out."</p>
                  <p>"Yes," Mrs. Elwyn said; "you know he is hardly ever at home in the morning;
                     but, Arthur, come and dine with us; you will be sure of finding him at home at
                     dinner."</p>
                  <pb n="296-297" xml:id="VAC6361-00000149"/>
                  <p>"Thank you," said Arthur; "I will not be able to do so; any exertion fatigues
                     me so much, that I am sure I will not be well enough to come out again to-day.
                     Yet, I am very anxious to see Mr. Elwyn."</p>
                  <p>"Leave a message with me, and I will tell him as soon as he comes in; he will
                     be sure to come and see you. What shall I say to him?"</p>
                  <p>"I dislike to annoy you with my affairs, Mrs. Elwyn, but perhaps you will do
                     what I am sure Mr. Elwyn would. You must be aware," he hesitated, "that I am
                     very poor; and, until I knew I was poor, I did not know how proud I was. I will
                     not, however, go into any details, further than to say I must do something to
                     obtain a subsistence for the time that I may live. There are several things
                     that I might do, were I not in such wretched health. I have obtained a
                     situation as agent of some books and periodicals, and if I grow stronger, the
                     going about that fatigues me so much now, may be of service to me—"</p>
                  <p>"Madam," said John, opening the door, "Mrs. Le Roche is here, and wishes me to
                     say she will sit in the carriage until you come, as she is in a great hurry; it
                     is half past two o'clock."</p>
                  <p>Mrs. Elwyn got up instantly, and said to Arthur, "John interrupted you, Mr.
                     Mason, but I have a most important engagement; I am so sorry that you should
                     have come at this time, when I must leave you."</p>
                  <p>Arthur saw that she was impatient to go, and said, "I will not detain you."</p>
                  <p>"What can George do for you?" said Mrs. Elwyn, without resuming her seat, or
                     asking Arthur to keep his. "It is, indeed, <emph>more</emph> than half past two
                     (looking at her watch). Won't you dine with us?"</p>
                  <p>"Impossible!" said Arthur; "I am too unwell; but, if you would subscribe to
                     these periodicals, it would afford me, at least for the present"—</p>
                  <p>Mrs. Le Roche's voice, calling to John, attracted Mrs. Elwyn's attention.
                     "Excuse me," she said, "but I cannot keep Mrs. Le Roche waiting. Come another
                     time, and I will hear all about your plans. I must leave you, good
                     morning."</p>
                  <p>Arthur looked in astonishment at the heartless woman, who, with a slight
                     courtesy, hurried from the room. She ran up stairs for her wrappings. "Another
                     time!" Arthur repeated to himself, as he looked around the costly residence.
                     "No! I will ask no more favors; it will not be long that I must suffer. God
                     give me strength to bear it!" He passed through the hall slowly, and into the
                     street. Once he turned to look back to the house, and sighed. He had hoped to
                     have heard something of Ada; at least that she was well; perhaps, that she<pb
                        n="298-299" xml:id="VAC6361-00000150"/> still loved him. This last and
                     dearest hope he now resigned.</p>
                  <p>In a few moments, Mrs. Elwyn came down prepared for her ride: but, as she was
                     about to get into the carriage, it occurred to her that she had not told Arthur
                     of Ada's being in New York, and for the purpose of hearing of him; nor had she
                     asked him where he might be found. Shocked at her forgetfulness, she turned
                     again to the house, hoping to find Arthur in the sitting-room, that, by this
                     information, she might atone to him for her impoliteness in leaving him; but he
                     was gone. Hardly noticing Mrs. Le Roche, who was beckoning to her to come, she
                     told John to go to the corner, and look round, to try and see Mr. Mason. John
                     obeyed her, but soon came back, saying it was no use to look for Mr. Mason, for
                     he went as soon as she left him; and he must have been out of sight long ago.
                     She was almost tempted to give up going out, in the hope that Arthur might pass
                     that way; but Mrs. Le Roche, who had become vexed at being delayed, got out of
                     her carriage, and came quickly up to her. "Dear Mrs. Elwyn," she said, "we will
                     be too late for those magnificent shawls; the sale will be over by the time we
                     get there; and after we have done with them, I made an appointment for us both
                     to be at Mrs. Irving's, to consult as to the characters in which we shall
                     appear at the Fancy Ball. Come on." Mrs. Elwyn followed her, but slowly, for
                     her heart was loudly reproving her, and it seemed to prophesy some sad
                     misfortune that would be the consequence of her unkindness to Arthur, and of
                     her unpardonable forgetfulness about Ada. So her morning was wretched, in spite
                     of Mrs. Le Roche's brilliant gossip, and the splendid shawls. Even the
                     important subject as to who should she be at the Fancy Ball, lost much of its
                     interest, for all day, Arthur's blanched face rose up before her; his weak
                     voice she could hear above all the din of Broadway, and a tear started to her
                     eye, at the recollection of his neat but shabby dress. The lustre in his eyes,
                     and the hectic on his cheek—oh! it seemed as if some spectral form was always
                     facing her, whichever way she turned. And she thought how happy Mr. Elwyn would
                     be to know Arthur was in New York—to take care of him as a brother would. And
                     Ada! poor Ada, struggling against a double sorrow! She determined never to tell
                     of the scene of the morning, for she did not even know where Arthur lived, and
                     she was afraid, from a knowledge of his character, that he might not come
                     again.</p>
                  <p>Could it be possible, she asked herself, that Arthur Mason was reduced to the
                     poverty that his dress and looks bespoke? The wanness of his features and the
                     attenuation of his limbs, she never could forget. She remembered, as Mrs. Le
                        Roche's<pb n="300-301" xml:id="VAC6361-00000151"/> carriage rolled down
                     Broadway, in all that noise and bustle, she remembered that Arthur said
                     something about obtaining a subsistence; and he asked her aid. Her womanly
                     spirit was ashamed at the thought that this appeal had been unheeded, almost
                     unheard. Poor Arthur! in what luxury had he been reared, how much he had always
                     been loved! Now, how desolate his condition was, for he was alone in the world;
                     the last of his family; and his inheritance passed to others; and, sadder than
                     all, Ada lost to him, <emph>and through her!</emph> This last thought was too
                     much; for, had she received him more kindly, had she bade him stay and rest,
                     had she given up her selfish pleasure to cheer him, had she told him that Ada
                     was now her own mistress, and anxiously waiting to hear of him, how changed
                     would have been that sad expression of his face! what joy to his heart! What a
                     happy meeting, had she detained him there, for Ada and Mr. Elwyn to come in and
                     welcome! But, too late! too late! So the ride to her was miserable; and though
                     she talked and laughed, and tried to quiet them, the reproaches of her
                     conscience became each moment keener, and she was relieved when she found
                     herself at home again. Mrs. Le Roche observed that something was wrong, but as
                     Mrs. Elwyn made every effort to seem cheerful, she was too polite to notice it;
                     but she told her, at parting, to be sure and study her character well, as the
                     ball was to be a brilliant affair, a sort of antidote to the dullness that Lent
                     was leaving in the great heart of the fashionable world.</p>
                  <p>Ah, woman of fashion! pass under the portals of your gorgeous home. There are
                     menials who prepare your way, who watch to obey your slightest wish. Pass up
                     the velvet covered staircase, looking into the room where, a few hours ago, you
                     might have entertained an angel, unawares. But a slight welcome fell from your
                     lips; there was no entreaty to remain, and the angel turned away. Pass on, up
                     the carved and winding stairway, and shut yourself in your own room. Rest on
                     that luxurious couch, and ask what new thing has come over you that the world
                     and its allurements have all at once become tame and unenticing. There is
                     speaking now to you, the voice of your better nature, the voice of your youth,
                     before that youth was sullied by the worship of the world; the voice of your
                     womanhood, the voice of your God. Listen to these voices, and follow them
                     whence they are calling. But no, you will not hear; what have you to do with
                     reproaches of heart and conscience? Too long have you bowed before the altar of
                     Mammon, an exacting deity, holding his worshippers by chains that are hard to
                     be unwound or broken. Dash away the tear, that an angel might have wept at the
                     remembrance of Arthur Mason's appearance that<pb n="302-303"
                        xml:id="VAC6361-00000152"/> day. Say hush! to the appealing heart, and brave
                     it out; for it is not your fault that there is sorrow, and sickness, and death
                     all over this great city. It has not come to you.</p>
                  <p>Mrs. Elwyn struggled against her gloomy thoughts, charged John not to mention
                     Mr. Mason's visit, and kept her secret. She dreaded lest her husband and Ada
                     should know how she had treated the object of their anxieties. She reasoned
                     away her scruples about the concealment, by the argument that as she could not
                     tell them where to find Arthur, it would make them more unhappy to know of his
                     illness and of his visit. After awhile, almost the remembrance of him was lost
                     in her preparations for the fancy ball, where she appeared in a becoming
                     costume, and sustained, most gayly, her part.</p>

                  <p>IT was Easter Sunday, and a more delightful day never dawned. Ada was up early,
                     and her occupations were such as the season demanded. After a late breakfast,
                     Sophie announced her intention of going to church, and the carriage was
                     ordered.</p>
                  <p>From the time that they left their house, one of the palaces of the Fifth
                     Avenue, until they reached Grace Church, Ada observed a procession of
                     elegantly-dressed persons, on their way to the different churches, the ladies
                     costly silks sweeping the pavements. Sophie recognized a friend walking with
                     some other persons, and she stopped the carriage, insisting upon her taking the
                     vacant seat, and accompanying them to Grace Church.</p>
                  <pb n="304-305" xml:id="VAC6361-00000153"/>
                  <p>"Impossible!" said the young lady. "I could not go to Grace Church to-day."</p>
                  <p>"Why not?" said Mrs. Elwyn, entreatingly.</p>
                  <p>"Oh, for the best reason in the world! I am not fit. I am going to Trinity."
                     She made a graceful courtesy, and passed on.</p>
                  <p>Mr. Elwyn laughed. "You see, Ada," he said, "God must be worshipped <foreign
                        xml:lang="FRA">a la mode</foreign> in Grace Church. Never go there in a silk
                     that costs less than five dollars a yard. Your shawl must be worth a thousand,
                     and your handkerchief not less than one hundred dollars. The heart that prays
                     acceptably must beat under lace and brocade. Don't offer to sing; only the
                     choir is permitted to praise God, according to the most approved style. A false
                     note would render the whole performance unacceptable. As to the prayers that
                     the rector reads, I have been going to Grace Church for two years, and I never
                     heard one of them; for the church is so built that only those who sit near the
                     altar can hear the service. That makes no difference, though, for who goes to
                     Grace Church to be preached to? Sophie does not like me to talk so, and I'll
                     allow it is a beautiful building, perfect in its architectural arrangements.
                     But there are some things I must tell you beforehand, Ada, or you will be as
                     stupid as I was when I took a seat in my pew for the first time. When we go in
                     the church, you will see persons ranged on each side of the door, seated in
                     those little halls or ante-rooms. These are strangers, and they must stay there
                     until we, who have pews in the church, have arrived; for it would be showing us
                     great disrespect, to have strangers made comfortable before we were there to
                     secure our own. Some of the pews are locked, I am told, but mine never is. When
                     the service is about to commence, the sextons show the strangers where they may
                     go. Those who come in carriages or are handsomely dressed are first provided
                     for. This is the aristocracy of religion! The others are seated somewhere. You
                     will hear good singing to-day, and for the rest, judge for yourself."</p>
                  <p>Ada had no time to reply, for they were at the church door, and in going in,
                     Mrs. Elwyn expressed her regret that they had come <emph>too soon</emph>, for
                     the service had not commenced.</p>
                  <p>Ada was delighted, on looking round, to see the exquisite taste displayed in
                     the construction of the church; particularly, in the arrangement of the light.
                     The window at the far end, to the left, as she sat, was of stained glass,
                     figuring the Mosaic dispensation. Clouds shadowed the mount, and Aaron and
                     Moses were there, holding the tables of stone. The painting was fine, and
                     nothing could have exceeded the effect, for Ada felt that old things had passed
                     away when she saw that the church was<pb n="306-307" xml:id="VAC6361-00000154"
                     /> lighted by another window, a painting of Christ, the Sun of righteousness.
                     The real rays of the sun from without, illuminated the pictured ones that
                     represented the glory of Christ—the Gospel light—within. Perhaps the light came
                     in too strongly, making the robes of the Saviour look gorgeous. Yet, the union
                     of design in the two pictures, and their good execution, delighted Ada's
                     cultivated taste.</p>
                  <p>From the pictures, her eyes turned to the congregation that was now thronging
                     in. She understood what it was to be dressed for Grace Church. The robes of
                     silk and velvet shone in the dazzling light of the pictured window.</p>
                  <p>In the near pews, she observed ladies and gentlemen conversing; she could not
                     avoid hearing a good deal that they said. Two persons in front of her, were
                     extolling the perfections of the concert singer, who was to perform the Easter
                     anthem, after the sermon. They spoke of the price that was to be paid her, and
                     of the exceeding sweetness of her voice, as adapted to love songs, or sacred
                     music. The gentleman said that he came to church, that day, to hear Madame
                     Bertini, and to see the fair lady with whom he was talking. She shook her fan
                     at him, and called him a wretch, then, raised her glass to survey the
                     congregation.</p>
                  <p>The organ pealed forth, and Ada looked up to the arches and spires through
                     which the grand and solemn music was reverberating. A strain of fine opera
                     music was played, and the grand tones became softer, until, hardly audible,
                     they died away. The trembling of the instrument seemed to be felt, like echoes
                     that are being lost among the distant mountains.</p>
                  <p>In the silence that succeeded, Ada waited to hear, "The Lord is in his holy
                     temple," but until she looked to the pulpit she did not know the service had
                     commenced. She opened her prayer-book and tried to follow the exhortation, that
                     she could not hear. By the most intense attention, she occasionally caught a
                     word, that guided her as to where the preacher was, but had she not known the
                     service by heart, she might as well have been in a Jewish synagogue, as here.
                     She kneeled at the confession of sins, but, though she could assume the
                     attitude of prayer, she could not collect her wandering thoughts. There was but
                     little chanting, but in this, Ada's nice ear perceived the harmony of the
                     voices. One or two verses of psalms were sung. A sermon was preached that she
                     could not hear, and tired to death, she wished the service were over.</p>
                  <p>Again, a brilliant prelude was played on the organ. The minister had
                     disappeared from his pulpit; the people were looking towards the choir, with
                     countenances of pleased expectation, and the deep notes of the instrument
                     filled the church, and slowly<pb n="308-309" xml:id="VAC6361-00000155"/> died
                     away. As they ceased, a voice powerful and sweet filled every part of the
                     church. It was a woman's voice, but angelic in its tones as it mounted to the
                     carved spires and windows, fled from corner to corner, and descended to the
                     ears of the listeners.</p>
                  <p>Ada was entranced as she listened to the anthem that commemorated the death and
                     resurrection of the son of God. The music of the first verse was slow and
                     solemn; the words were impressively sung. Then the voice swelled and quickened,
                     and its notes betokened anxiety, for the second verse announced the entombment
                     of Him to whom so many looked as their deliverer. He lays in the grave! the
                     voice poured forth a wailing lament, loud, and then subdued. Ada's bosom
                     swelled as she listened, and tears fell from her eyes. He arises! and with the
                     loud music of the organ, the voice triumphant, mingled. Every part of the
                     church gave back the joyful and magnificent strain of the singer.</p>
                  <p>The anthem appeared to close with this outburst of music. Still, the dull,
                     trembling sound of the instrument—again, the voice. Where is it? so faintly
                     heard, but clearly, as it soars to the utmost height of the spires, passes from
                     arch to arch, lingering like some bird that would thrill forever, near the
                     skies. Ada held her breath and looked up. There was no sound throughout that
                     church but the carolling of the sweet singer. Every form seemed to be a statue
                     in its seat—there was no motion—fearful to lose the faintest note.</p>
                  <p>And still more fearful, for those notes are fading away, clear still, and
                     soaring among the vaulted arches of the roof, soft and faint, but lingering
                     there—fainter, and dying away into silence.</p>
                  <p>Ada bent her head, and burst into tears, every nerve of her frame was so highly
                     strung.</p>
                  <p>Crowds were leaving the church; many came only to hear the music.</p>
                  <p>Mr. Elwyn whispered to Ada, "Shall you remain to Communion?"</p>
                  <p>The question reminded her where she was. In the house of God! She was shocked
                     to think how completely she had forgotten it. She declined remaining, not
                     feeling in a state to kneel at the holy altar. She followed Mrs. Elwyn to the
                     carriage.</p>
                  <p>"Ada," said Mr. Elwyn, "what do you think of our Sunday opera? Wasn't it grand?
                     I came very near clapping at one time."</p>
                  <p>"I could never worship in this church," said Ada.</p>
                  <p>"I am grieved to think how entirely I was taken up with that singing, fine as
                     it was."</p>
                  <p>"Perhaps," said Mrs. Elwyn, "you prefer to hear bad music in church."</p>
                  <p>"I would even prefer <emph>that</emph>," said Ada, "if the heart went with
                     it."</p>
                  <p>"How do you know but Madame Bertini's did?"</p>
                  <pb n="310-311" xml:id="VAC6361-00000156"/>
                  <p>Mr. Elwyn laughed when his wife asked this question. "Why, Sophie," he said,
                     "Madame Bertini was paid very high for her singing to-day. Every note that
                     thrilled through that church cost money. If praise, it was hired praise. I
                     cannot think that God, whose altar is the whole earth, and for whose sanctuary
                     Heaven is not glorious enough, will be pleased with coined tributes from the
                     lips of people whose lives are so often unworthy of them. How would it sound to
                     read from the pulpit of that church the history and character of each that
                     sings, for the amusement of the congregation? Would <emph>you</emph> visit that
                     concert-singer?"</p>
                  <p>"Certainly not."</p>
                  <p>"But," said Mr. Elwyn, "she is good enough to carry to the throne of God the
                     praises of a congregation, for she sings alone."</p>
                  <p>"Why do you go to church," said Mrs. Elwyn, "if you find so much fault with
                     what you see and hear there?"</p>
                  <p>"Going to church," he said, "is a habit that I got into when I was young; I
                     believe I caught it from my mother. I go to Grace Church because you do."</p>
                  <p>"You and Ada are Methodists," said Mrs. Elwyn. "You like preachers that break
                     down pulpits and wear out Bibles in their zeal. But I like propriety in
                     church."</p>
                  <p>"The propriety that I saw to-day," said Ada, "seemed a mere formality. But I do
                     not wish to judge harshly. This is certain, you must not ask me about the
                     sermon. I did not even hear the text."</p>

                  <p>IT was a fortnight after Arthur's visit. Mr. and Mrs. Elwyn were in the
                     drawing-room with Ada. Mrs. Elwyn was reading a French novel. Her husband and
                     Ada were conversing.</p>
                  <p>"To-day," said Ada, "is the anniversary of Mr. Mason's death. I almost despair
                     of ever receiving any tidings of Arthur. He cannot be alive, or he would let me
                     hear from him. Sometimes, I think he may not know of my mother's death, and
                     pride may restrain him from communicating with us. Often, I fear he is ill;
                     among strangers; and without money. If I only could see him, to tell him that
                     all his father owned could be his again, I should be content, even if I had to
                     learn that he had ceased to love me."</p>
                  <p>"I am discouraged at Arthur's continued silence," said Mr. Elwyn; "though I am
                     sure, there is no danger of his forgetting you. If he had died, we should have
                     heard of it; such bad news would soon fly to us. I feel certain that he is in
                     New York, though I can give no reason for this conviction. Perhaps he has found
                     some employment, and prefers being established in it, before he advises us of
                     his situation."</p>
                  <p>"I wish I could think so," said Ada, sighing deeply.</p>
                  <p>"Where did you go this morning, Ada?" said Mrs. Elwyn, laying down her
                     novel.</p>
                  <p>"You will be shocked when I tell you," said Ada. "To the Five Points."</p>
                  <p>"Good heavens!" said Mrs. Elwyn, in great astonishment; "what took you
                     there?"</p>
                  <p>"Curiosity; and, perhaps, something better than curiosity."</p>
                  <p>"But, Ada," said Mrs. Elwyn, "the Five Points is the rendezvous of all the
                     thieves, cut-throats, and abandoned wretches of New York. There is nothing<pb
                        n="314-315" xml:id="VAC6361-00000158"/> thing there but what, I should
                     think, a woman who had any delicacy or refinement would shrink from. I do not
                     even know where the place is."</p>
                  <p>"Oh! you are mistaken," Ada replied. "Five Points is a dreadful place, I know,
                     but, with all its horrors, nay, right in the midst of them, you may see
                     something beautiful—something that women of delicacy and refinement have
                     greatly contributed towards accomplishing."</p>
                  <p>"I did not know," said Sophie, "that a decent woman ever approached Five
                     Points; I am amazed to hear you have been there. But, as you <emph>have</emph>
                     been, tell me what you saw that was beautiful."</p>
                  <p>"I have an engagement that will occupy me for a couple of hours," said Mr.
                     Elwyn, "so I will leave you two, to ramble about Five Points alone. You can get
                     along without me."</p>
                  <p>"Good night!" said Ada, "if I should not see you again; for I am very tired,
                     and shall go to bed early."</p>
                  <p>"I was so surprised," said Ada, when Mr. Elwyn had closed the door, "to find
                     Five Points in the very heart of the city; a short, walk from Broadway brings
                     you to it; it is not far from the Bowery. Going down the street that leads to
                     it, we saw only those miserable Jews' stores, at the doors of which, idle and
                     ugly-looking women were sitting. Some of them had their babies in their laps.
                     Most of them had a foreign look. Some of the countenances were hideous, all
                     seamed with marks of dissipation or disease. I felt so disgusted with their
                     looks, and with the dirty street through which we had to pass, that I proposed
                     to Mr. Elwyn to turn back; but he said that we had started, and we had better
                     go on with our expedition. An old colored woman that we questioned, guided us
                     to where five points of the different pavements approach each other very
                     closely, giving the name to this wretched locality. Looking over the way I
                     recognized the mission school, for I had recently seen a print of it. I suppose
                     you know the history of this building? No! It is very interesting. It is built
                     where, for many years, stood 'the Old Brewery,' in whose wretched halls so many
                     crimes of the deepest and darkest dye have been committed. Here was always a
                     shelter for the robber and the murderer. It was the home of such. Children have
                     been born and brought up under this roof, never hearing the name of God but
                     when spoken blasphemously. The young were decoyed, and often forced here; and
                     though they shuddered, at first, at what they saw and heard, their hearts soon
                     became as black as the old walls of the building. Oh! the babe that opened its
                     eyes here, on the darkened light of the sun, and the old, haggard sinner, were
                     equally cut off from hope; for, within these dreary, dungeon walls, good people
                     did not dare<pb n="316-317" xml:id="VAC6361-00000159"/> venture; even to
                     approach them were a risk. Oh! Sophie, many a poor victim of temptation,
                     hurried on by uncontrolled passion, took refuge here, and breathed out her
                     weary life; many a one, brought hither, passed a few gloomy days and nights,
                     comparing the awful present with the sinless years that were past, languished
                     in a vain remorse, shrieked out—'Lost! lost!' and died."</p>
                  <p>"Oh! Ada," said Mrs. Elwyn, "how can you talk so? You fancy all these dreadful
                     things."</p>
                  <p>"Indeed, I do not. There was a gentleman there to-day, that Mr. Elwyn knew. In
                     a low tone, not intending me to hear, he was speaking of the horrors of this
                     place. From those windows in our sight, he said, women, out of whose hearts all
                     that was good had not departed—high up, from those windows, had they dashed
                     themselves down, risking a frightful death, rather than endure the life they
                     were obliged to live; for they were prisoners, not daring to attempt to leave
                     the place openly. Abandoned as they were, it was too dreadful to witness the
                     foul murders, and all the other crimes, that were hourly committed before their
                     eyes.</p>
                  <p>"At last, there were those who remembered that Jesus Christ died for the
                     unhappy and guilty inmates of the Old Brewery; and they felt constrained to
                     tell them of it. Jesus! that name so sweet, so powerful, <emph>must</emph>
                     sound in their ears, <emph>must</emph> be uttered by the lips of the outcasts.
                     But who dare intrude upon them! who would venture in the den of the murderer?
                     who brave the rudeness and violence of dissolute men and women! There were
                     found some bold enough to make the trial. God gave them courage. Before those
                     doors stood men and women who dared to enter, though warned away. They made
                     their way up the crazy, filthy staircases, and met at the doors of the rooms,
                     their degraded tenants. They were received with shouts of derisive laughter,
                     with sullen looks, and angry and defiant gestures; with open threatenings. They
                     were frightened, but they believed their Master had brought them here, and they
                     stayed. They saw, on a foul wretched pallet, a dying man—with staring eyes and
                     bony limbs. He cursed God for his hunger and misery. [Oh! the untold woe that
                     is the heritage of sin. The earthly part of this poor wretch's suffering was
                     nearly over.] They gave him food that he was loudly calling for, though the
                     death-struggle was approaching. They mixed for him an anodyne that softened his
                     dying agonies. The summons of death they could not stay, but they tried to take
                     away somewhat of its horror. Under his head they gently placed a pillow, and
                     they moistened, with a cordial, his parched lips. Oh! if they could save him!
                     that he might prepare to meet God, face to face. They saw it was useless to
                        try<pb n="318-319" xml:id="VAC6361-00000160"/> to do this, but they could
                     not refrain from naming, bending close to his ear, one Jesus of Nazareth.
                     Jesus! how strangely that name, reverently uttered, sounded amid the curses and
                     the awful jests that were being uttered around him. Jesus! the dying man once
                     more opened the eyes that were closing in a dreamless sleep. Wandering for a
                     moment, they were fixed, as if upon some point in the past, following the last
                     effort of his wrecked will. Jesus! when had he heard that name, so softly
                     uttered? A vision of his poor but virtuous home flits by him; a vision of the
                     village church and its white haired pastor. Years had rolled by since then; he
                     gathers up his expiring strength, puts forth his skeleton hand—Oh! could he
                     grasp them and bring them back. They are gone—memory, as it dies away, tries to
                     count them. They are gone, and he sinks with them into the abyss of the past.
                     Time is no more with him.</p>
                  <p>"What a place for a corpse, and where is the solemnity that attends the parting
                     of soul and body! The air of the room is poisonous with the breath of drunken
                     men and women, with the unclean rags of the children. Oaths and blasphemies do
                     not cease, though that ghastly form, with its fallen jaws and stiffened limbs,
                     is before them. The wife wails for a few moments the lover of her guiltless
                     youth, and then begs the visiters to give her drink; it is all she asks. Not
                     water, Oh, no. Brandy! brandy! is her horrid cry. Let her drink, and forget,
                     and die! They will not; yet they cover the face of the dead, and have the body
                     lifted from the dirty straw. They carry him out and bury him. Then they clothe
                     his famine-struck children, and by kindness, entreaties, and tears, induce the
                     mother to go with them from this wretched place. They find her employment; and
                     patiently follow her up, and at last, rejoicing, see her turning from her old
                     life."</p>
                  <p>"Oh Ada," said Mrs. Elwyn, "what a picture! Do you believe there is, really,
                     such wretchedness and sin upon the earth?"</p>
                  <p>"Yes, indeed. More of it than you or I dream of Sophie! the world is wretched
                     from sin; that is our birthright, and our inheritance. I sometimes fancy Satan
                     coursing over the earth in triumphal procession, and close upon him follow his
                     agents, Sin and Death. And these desolate the earth, that would be so lovely
                     without them. There is one, the King of Glory, who alone can stop their
                     frightful progress. For this purpose, he commissions his followers to go about,
                     as he did, on the earth, doing good. The wish to imitate him, stimulates the
                     efforts of the missionaries at Five Points. They hope to accomplish most
                     through the children. They have established a school in the house built on the
                     site of the Old Brewery. It has prospered—it <emph>must</emph>
                     <pb n="320-321" xml:id="VAC6361-00000161"/> —for God is the teacher. In the
                     same building with the school, many of the reformed reprobates live. The rooms
                     are rented to them, employment is found for them, while their children are
                     instructed and clothed, if necessary. The sick are nursed in this building, and
                     all are cared for. The most perfect system and order are preserved. There are
                     regular hours for prayers, and for retiring for the night. No noise, no
                     dissipation is permitted. Every Sunday, there is religious service held in the
                     chapel, which is well attended by those who live in the house; and the poor
                     wretches, that live in Five Points, lounge in from curiosity. They hear, and
                     sometimes, one hears, believes, and lives. Oh! Sophie! the unspeakable gift! Is
                     there not a magic power in the name of Jesus, that a bloated vagrant, a man who
                     has fought, and robbed, and murdered for a lifetime, hears, and weeps—and lives
                     a new life?"</p>
                  <p>"How did you learn all this?" asked Mrs. Elwyn.</p>
                  <p>"One of the ladies who first ventured into the Old Brewery described to me many
                     scenes that she witnessed there," said Ada. "Once, she went into a room where a
                     very young woman was standing, calling for help, for her babe was dying. She
                     seemed to be distracted in her grief and loneliness. The babe was a mere mass
                     of bones, and its mother was little better. They were both dying of famine. The
                     husband and father had deserted them, and they were perfectly friendless. She
                     proved to be a virtuous woman, and when asked afterwards how she came there,
                     she said she did not know her husband's character when she married him, and
                     that he took her there. Then, though she saw how dreadful the place was, and
                     though he neglected her in her sickness, and let her want bread, she
                        <emph>could not part from him, for she loved him</emph>. Oh, Sophie, does it
                     not seem holy, this woman's love? You may go over the whole earth, following in
                     the track of Satan, Sin, and Death, and still you pick up everywhere, in the
                     dust beneath your feet, this gem, woman's love."</p>
                  <p>"What became of the woman?" asked Mrs. Elwyn.</p>
                  <p>"She is now a most efficient aid in the work of renovation going on at Five
                     Points. The baby revived as soon as it had proper food. Its mother was almost
                     beside herself with joy at seeing her babe rally its strength, and she ate what
                     they gave her as if she were starving, which was, indeed, the case. When she
                     and her child were well, she was most anxious to do something to show her
                     gratitude to her benefactors. She said that had her babe died, she would have
                     killed herself, for as her husband had left her, the child was all that bound
                     her to life. Her own family were so much offended<pb n="322-323"
                        xml:id="VAC6361-00000162"/> with her, for having lived at Five Points, that
                     they would not speak to her. She loved those who had come in time to save her
                     and her child from perishing, and love sharpens the eyesight, and opens the
                     dull ears. She saw a way of returning the favors that she had received, for she
                     is very useful in the mission establishment. I saw her child to-day; he is a
                     bright little fellow. Now, Sophie, have I not told you of something beautiful
                     at Five Points?"</p>
                  <p>"I never hear of such things. I am often called upon for money for charitable
                     purposes, and I give it, but I do not inquire what becomes of it."</p>
                  <p>"You are out of the sphere of such things, in a measure," said Ada. "Your
                     fashionable friends would be scandalized to hear the scenes, that I saw to-day,
                     discussed. <emph>You</emph> ought to take an interest in whatever is of service
                     to your fellow-creatures, not only from the natural kindness of your heart, but
                     because Mr. Elwyn is so anxious to do good. But, Sophie, I have not told you
                     half that I saw today at Five Points. I could not tell you. It made me tremble
                     and cling to Mr. Elwyn's arm to look in faces that we met. I got so frightened
                     at the appearance of everything after I left the mission house, that Mr. Elwyn
                     laughed at me, and showed me the policemen that I could see in every direction.
                     I did not know until to-day that the policemen wore uniform. It reassured me to
                     see them about, and when the clerk of the mission house offered to walk with
                     us, I readily accepted the offer, for I was anxious to see Cow Bay."</p>
                  <p>"Cow Bay!" said Mrs. Elwyn. "Where on the earth is that?"</p>
                  <p>"You will not find it on the map," said Ada, smiling. "How is it that I, a
                     stranger, know more of New York than you, who have lived here years? Cow Bay is
                     the name of a part of Five Points where a sort of triangle is formed from the
                     shape of the streets that run out towards great high, tumbling-down houses. In
                     every room in these hideous-looking tenements two or three families live. There
                     they swarm, and revel, and riot, depositing their stolen goods until they can
                     get a chance to sell them to some of the low trading establishments near. In
                     summer, the tops of the houses in Cow Bay and all over Five Points are covered
                     with vagrant sleepers, who have no other place to rest, or who dare not go
                     abroad to look for a more comfortable place. Until lately, awful murders, the
                     circumstances of which never will be known, were committed nightly in Cow Bay,
                     and it was not safe to pass through it in the day. Even now, you must be
                     careful how you pass by."</p>
                  <p>"Such wretches," said Sophie, "had better all be hung. The idea of having such
                     a den in the same city with us!"</p>
                  <pb n="324-325" xml:id="VAC6361-00000163"/>
                  <p>"Oh, Sophie," said Ada, "there are things there such as I thought could not
                     exist in our happy country. Never tell me that Dickens' pictures of low life
                     are exaggerated after what I saw to-day. Just at the corner of Cow Bay, a crowd
                     of women were collected, and as we came near them, they raised a shout of
                     laughter. We soon knew the cause. An awful looking creature, that I was ashamed
                     to call by the name of woman, was <emph>preaching</emph>, as they call it. She
                     was dreadfully intoxicated, reeling as she stood upon a box. On her head was an
                     old lace cap, with streamers of faded, dirty ribbon, and artificial wreaths
                     dangling down the sides. Her person was loathsome to behold, but it was dressed
                     in what was once a costly brocade. It was awful to hear her swear, as, with
                     arms extended and clinched fists, she was describing some scene to her
                     auditors, most of whom were women, without bonnets, and dressed in the same
                     style. It was shocking to see babes in these vile mothers' arms. What bosoms on
                     which to repose the head of infancy! What hearts against which wearied
                     childhood might lean and sleep! What lips to press kisses, that must wither to
                     curses, on the brow of a child! We hurried through this crowd as best we might,
                     but not without hearing language that I would rather not have heard."</p>
                  <p>"How could you stay?" said Mrs. Elwyn. "I should have been frightened to
                     death."</p>
                  <p>"As I was," said Ada; "but I wanted still to look about me. I met two little
                     boys, not more than ten years old, arm in arm, with cigars in their mouths,
                     both intoxicated. Think of it, Sophie! drunken childhood! They were the sons of
                     a notorious robber, in Cow Bay. They never left Five Points, probably, but to
                     steal. We met a youth sixteen years old, so the gentleman who walked with us
                     said; he had known him from a little boy. At sixteen, he looked sixty. He must
                     be dying of some awful disease, for his flesh is yellow, and hangs about him in
                     bloated masses. He was staggering from side to side of the pavement, and as we
                     passed him he looked at us, with a leering laugh, like a fiend; I never saw
                     anything so dreadful as that face. There was a very pretty woman, neatly
                     dressed, leaning against the corner of the Mission House. She had a long gash
                     across her cheek, made by the knife of her husband, who stabbed her in the
                     face, in a fit of jealousy. At the Mission House, she was nursed until her
                     recovery; for she nearly I died from the wound, and from fright. But she will
                     not stay there; the old pleasures lure her back—the midnight revel and
                     carouse.</p>
                  <p>"In the yard of the Mission House, there is a part of the Old Brewery left—a
                     mere shed. I<pb n="326-327" xml:id="VAC6361-00000164"/> looked at it with
                     something of the feeling with which I saw the key of the Bastile."</p>
                  <p>"You look quite worn out;" said Mrs. Elwyn, after a moment's pause.</p>
                  <p>"I am very tired," said Ada, "and I am going to bed. Good night." She stooped
                     and kissed Mrs. Elwyn's cheek, before going.</p>
                  <p>"Oh!" thought Mrs. Elwyn, "did she know the wrong that I have done her, when I
                     refused assistance to the friend of her childhood and mine, and her betrothed!
                     Oh! could I recall that wretched morning! Where is Arthur this night? Is he
                     living? is he dead?"</p>
                  <p>Such thoughts were agony to her, as she sat alone in her splendid drawing-room.
                     Woman of fashion! your sin will find you out. Why does Arthur's face haunt you?
                     There is no sweet sleep for you on your downy couch. Conscience lays a thorn on
                     your luxurious pillow. Conscience! the world had tried to deaden its voice
                     forever. But it would speak.</p>

                  <p>"SOPHIE," said Mr. Elwyn, when they were through with breakfast the next
                     morning, "how pale you look. Are you unwell?"</p>
                  <p>"No! I am only low spirited."</p>
                  <p>"What can be the matter?" said Mr. Elwyn cheerfully. "Has your mantua-maker
                     committed murder on a dress? or has the supply of Honiton lace come short this
                     season? Whatever is the cause, let me suggest a remedy—go with Ada to the Five
                     Points."</p>
                  <p>"No indeed!" she said; "Ada's account of her visit there has depressed me to
                     death. If I were to see all she described to me, I should be wretched for the
                     next year."</p>
                  <p>"And I," said Ada, "feel not happier, but more<pb n="328-329"
                        xml:id="VAC6361-00000165"/> reconciled to my lot than I have been for a long
                     time."</p>
                  <p>"I cannot comprehend you, Ada!"</p>
                  <p>"I mean," said Ada, "that when I think of the situation of these wretches at
                     Five Points, I feel how gracious God has been to me. You, Sophie, have so many
                     sources of happiness, that you can afford to be a little low-spirited
                     sometimes, but I have so few, as far as this life is concerned, that I must
                     make the most of them all. The most disagreeable recollection that I have of
                     Five Points is the impression left by the sight of those children there. They
                     looked old in vice and wretchedness. I shall have to keep Nannie before me all
                     day, to rid myself of the gloomy picture of infancy that has fastened itself on
                     my memory. How bright you look this morning, Nannie! you are a perfect
                     sunbeam."</p>
                  <p>Nannie looked very grave, as if charged with an impropriety. "No, I am not,
                     Ada," she answered, and went on eating her roll. The solemnity of her manner
                     made them all smile. Nannie smiled too, from sympathy. Breakfast was a happy
                     time to her, for she always sat in her high chair, by her father.</p>
                  <p>"I do love children," said Mr. Elwyn, "and for the reason that most persons
                     love them—at least, this is one reason. When we see an interesting child, we
                     regard it as the picture of what we were once ourselves. Now, I often take
                     Nannie in my arms, and caress her, associating her not only with my own early
                     days, but with her mother's, and with all the little people that we frolicked
                     with, long ago. I am half sorry that I ever left that dear old country place to
                     live in this great heartless city, and I am tempted to catch up Nannie and her
                     mother and go back, never to come here again."</p>
                  <p>Ada looked down while Mr. Elwyn was speaking; she was thinking of her early
                     days, of Mrs. Mason, and of Arthur. Mr. Elwyn saw to what point her thoughts
                     were turning, and he changed the subject. "This breakfast hour," he said, "is
                     the most delightful to me of all the twenty-four. This little room, so much
                     more plainly furnished than any of the others, suits my simple taste. My wife
                     always looks beautifully in her morning dress, and I have Nannie so cozily
                     seated by my side, and since you have been here, Ada, it has been more
                     agreeable than ever. I hate to get up and go to Wall Street, to jostle and to
                     be jostled, to see people planning and driving, and cheating each other,
                     watching for bargains, and talking of stocks. When I am a poet, I shall sing
                     the breakfast hour."</p>
                  <p>"I thought," said Sophie, "that poets sang the evening hour, and they are
                     right, for I am always<pb n="330-331" xml:id="VAC6361-00000166"/> so stupid in
                     the morning, and so bright and gay in the evening."</p>
                  <p>"Yes," said her husband, "but my idea of happiness is home happiness, and in
                     New York we have no evenings at home, except when we have a terrible storm or a
                     party; and one of these is about as pleasant as the other. I come home
                     completely worn out, and after we have dinner, I should like to sit down to
                     rest and enjoy Sophie's society. But just at a reasonable bed-time, we must
                     dress and go out. Now, I <emph>must</emph> go. Sophie, take Ada to the Astor
                     library to-day, and to the Turkish Bazaar. I have taken her to the Tombs, and
                     the Five Points, and to all the places where you would not go. Be sure Nannie
                     is one of the party, she will enjoy the ride. Good-by; let me find you both in
                     good spirits at dinner." So, with a kiss to his little girl, the man of
                     business went forth to his labor.</p>
                  <p>Nannie did enjoy the ride, and on their return, Ada said, "I am ashamed of
                     bringing up my griefs so often, but do you know that I never pass any place
                     where I see fine pictures on exhibition, or where fine music is to be heard,
                     but I think, possibly, were I to go in, I might meet Arthur. His taste is so
                     cultivated that it would lead him to such places. After a little while, I shall
                     go home if I do not hear from him, for I have no right to intrude my sorrows on
                     others."</p>
                  <p>"You shall not go," said Sophie; "what would you do there, entirely alone? You
                     would be a great deal happier though, if you went out, with me, into gay
                     society. There's the opera; I should think you would like to go often, for you
                     are such a good musician. I go, merely because it is the fashion, for as you
                     know, I am perfectly ignorant of music as a science. You are always thinking of
                     death and such things; how can you be happy?"</p>
                  <p>"Oh!" said Ada, "I could not go into gay society; I should not enjoy it, and my
                     deep mourning would be out of place there. As to happiness, Sophie, it is not
                     to be found in the world, that is, in the pleasures of the world."</p>
                  <p>"Yes," said Sophie; "there is a dead man in every one's heart; I dare say no
                     one is perfectly happy. Every person must have a care."</p>
                  <p>"But what care need you have?" said Ada. "Think of your blessings. With such a
                     husband! so good as he is, and so devoted to you; with little Nannie—with
                     beauty, wealth, and health, certainly you ought to be happy."</p>
                  <p>"Sometimes I am," said Sophie, "but often I am wretched. I must have
                     excitement, because I am accustomed to it. I could not live without going out a
                     great deal, for it is a habit with me. I used to be fond of reading, but now,
                     except to skim over a new novel, I never open a book, for it takes all<pb
                        n="332-333" xml:id="VAC6361-00000167"/> my time to dress and to receive and
                     pay visits. I suppose it is all right. People that are placed in a certain
                     class of society must support their station."</p>
                  <p>"But is there no other way of supporting this station, but by attending operas,
                     and expending so much money and time in dress and such things?" asked Ada. "Mr.
                     Elwyn seems to dislike this sort of life."</p>
                  <p>"Yes, but he introduced me to it," said Sophie; "I was a real country girl when
                     I came to New York; I loved the South, and should have been satisfied to live
                     there always; but now, I cannot live anywhere but in New York."</p>
                  <p>"Tell me, Sophie," said Ada, "does this fashionable life satisfy you? Are you
                     as happy as you were before you knew it?"</p>
                  <p>"No, indeed!" said Sophie; "sometimes I am sick to death of it. While I am at a
                     ball, I enjoy myself exceedingly. I like attention, and I always receive a
                     great deal. I like to hear people whisper about me, as I walk through the
                     rooms, and to know that my dress is as elegant, and perhaps more so, than any
                     person's in the room. The excitement is the great charm; the music, the light,
                     the mirrors, the flowers, and jewels, all these things enchant me; but when I
                     come away, I feel the want of it, and look forward to renewing, to morrow, the
                     scene of tonight"</p>
                  <p>"What a confession from a sensible woman!" said Ada, smiling. "But suppose,
                     Sophie, that sickness, or loss of fortune, or some calamity—the death of your
                     husband or child—should come upon you; then you would feel the true estimate of
                     fashionable life."</p>
                  <p>"How can you talk so?" said Sophie. "You are conjuring up horrible spectres, to
                     frighten me. George and Nannie are in perfect health; how can you suggest such
                     a thing as their dying?" and she put her arm round her little girl. "You are a
                     perfect raven, Ada!"</p>
                  <p>"I only say such things are possible, dear Sophie; God grant they may be far
                     off. The life of a woman of fashion offers a certain sort of happiness in
                     prosperity; when the dark days come—the rainy days of life, and they must come
                     to all, the world will be a wretched comforter. I like New York, and under some
                     circumstances, I should like to live here; but I would take interest in many
                     things that gay people do not think of. I was delighted, the other day, at the
                     Bible House. How much good is done in that building. To think of the Bibles
                     that are published there, and how they go all over the world, to sanctify house
                     and heart. All the operations of the Bible House are carried on by steam; it
                        works<pb n="334-335" xml:id="VAC6361-00000168"/> from story to story, just
                     as the <emph>one</emph> power of grace carries on <emph>its</emph> work, all
                     over the earth. The American Female Bible Society, to which you are a
                     subscriber, Sophie, has done a great deal of good. Thousands of dollars have
                     been given by women, rich and poor, according to their abilities; and it is
                     delightful to think that many a woman's heart has been consoled by the reading
                     of a book, the gift of a sister in a strange land."</p>
                  <p>"I am always intending to go to the Bible House, but I can't get time for
                     everything. Here we are, at home; how cold it is. I hope George is waiting for
                     us, for I have been thinking all day of his wanting to spend his evenings with
                     me; if I had not promised Mrs. Tessaire certainly to go to her soirée to-night,
                     I <emph>would</emph> stay at home."</p>
                  <p>"Oh! do stay," said Ada, as they got out of the carriage; "it will please Mr.
                     Elwyn." But they found Mr. Elwyn had not come yet, though it was past their
                     dinner hour. They waited dinner for him some time, and Ada said perhaps he had
                     gone home with some friend, to dine.</p>
                  <p>"Oh no!" said Sophie; "he would have sent me word; he always does."</p>
                  <p>"Probably he has been detained at his office;" said Ada; "don't be uneasy."</p>
                  <p>"Let's have dinner, John;" said Mrs. Elwyn; "he will be in by the time we sit
                     down."</p>
                  <p>But dinner was over, and day had closed in, and he did not come. Mrs. Elwyn was
                     evidently anxious, listening to every footfall, and starting at the ringing of
                     the door bell, wondering, all the time, what could have detained him. At length
                     she went up stairs, leaving Nannie with Ada, in the sitting-room, that looked
                     upon the street. Ada took a chair by the window, and lifted the little girl to
                     her lap, turning aside the curtain, that she might see the passers-by. It was a
                     cold, dismal Saturday evening; the wind was blowing and shifting, and Nannie
                     was much amused at the way the people held their cloaks about them, and ran
                     along. For a time, Ada talked with her, and then the little one became quiet,
                     leaving Ada to her own thoughts; they were not pleasant ones. Another weary
                     day, and no tidings of Arthur; each morning brought hope, each evening
                     disappointment. "I might as well give him up;" she said to herself; "but I
                     cannot. What is the mystery of his silence. Oh! how many hundred people pass
                     here every day; why does not he come? How many are going to their homes and
                     friends this evening! if he would but come to me!" She bent over the little
                     child and wept. Nannie looked at her with some surprise, but her eyes were
                     growing dim with sleep. Ada held her closely in her arms, and kissed her. "Oh!
                     Nannie," she said softly, "how can your mother neglect you so? she is now<pb
                        n="336-337" xml:id="VAC6361-00000169"/> dressing for a ball, instead of
                     singing you to sleep, or telling you of God; what happiness she throws
                     away!"</p>
                  <p>She recollected Sophie's account of the happiness she enjoyed in the world, and
                     she sighed at the recollection. Happiness! she thought. Is there such a thing
                     as happiness here? It is not under this roof, for the world does not satisfy
                     Sophie's longings for it, and Mr. Elwyn, devoted as he is to his wife, is
                     grieved at the life she leads. And I am not happy. This little angel that is
                     dreaming in my arms is happy, and it is a pity that she should ever cease to
                     dream!</p>
                  <p>She kissed her again, and laying her on a sofa, rung for the maid to take her
                     to bed. Then she went to Mrs. Elwyn's room, afraid to trust herself again to
                     meditation.</p>
                  <p>She found Mrs. Elwyn preparing for the ball. The flowers, the lace scarf, all
                     the elegant accompaniments to a rich moire antique, were thrown upon the bed.
                     Sophie was in the hands of a hair-dresser, a woman who lived with her
                     principally to arrange her hair, and to assist her in dressing.</p>
                  <p>"Sophie," said Ada, "I don't want you to go out to-night unless Mr. Elwyn has
                     come in."</p>
                  <p>"No, he has not come yet, but I am expecting him every moment. It is after
                     nine. I hope he will come so as to dress and be ready to go at ten."</p>
                  <p>"If he does not come, won't you stay at home?" said Ada.</p>
                  <p>"No, indeed! though I feel like anything but going to a party. The truth is, I
                     want to get into good spirits, for last night I stayed at home, and heard your
                     doleful account of Five Points, and all day I have been worried about something
                     or other. I am very anxious about George, but I must go out for a little while;
                     when he comes home, I am sure he will come after me."</p>
                  <p>Ada felt it would not be polite in her to press the subject any farther; she
                     hoped every moment that Mr. Elwyn would come in. In this she was disappointed,
                     and Sophie went on with her dressing, until, splendidly arrayed, she took up
                     her fan and lace handkerchief, and looking at her watch, found it was after
                     ten. She courtesied playfully to Ada, and bade her good-by, and said, "I wish I
                     could make up my mind to stay with you, but I told you how it was, this
                     morning. I must have excitement, though I know I shall not enjoy myself
                     to-night. I'll soon be home, but if I don't find George here, I shall be
                     frightened to death." Ada went to her own room, wondering and indignant. She
                     knew that her friend loved her husband, and yet she could dress and go to a
                     ball when there was every reason to be anxious about him. How could it be? Ada
                     was too ignorant of the world and of fashionable life to see into it.</p>

                  <p>IT was the darkest time of the night, the hour that precedes the dawning of
                     day, when Mr. Elwyn turned the corner of the street that led to his house. By
                     the lamp in front of his door, he saw his wife, in her brilliant ball-dress,
                     going from the carriage to the house. He remembered that it was really Sunday
                     morning, as he hurried on, and telling the coachman to wait with the carriage
                     until further orders from him, he hurried into the house, and followed his wife
                     to her room. She saw him with great pleasure, and exclaimed, "Oh, George! have
                     you just come in? If you knew how miserable I have been about you all day!
                     Where have you been?"</p>
                  <p>"You have a strange way of being miserable," he said. "Is it possible that you
                     could go to that ball when you had not heard of me since breakfast?"</p>
                  <p>The wife looked embarrassed, and said, "I supposed business kept you."</p>
                  <p>"Business never detained me a whole day from you, Sophie, and business never
                     could keep me occupied during the hours of the Sabbath, not if by so doing I
                     could coin untold gold. Neglectful as I feel I have been as regards my
                     religious duties, I have always reverenced the Sabbath. You have been dancing
                     away its holy hours, forgetful of your duties as a wife, a mother, and a
                     Christian woman."</p>
                  <p>Mrs. Elwyn felt that she deserved the reproof, and the very consciousness of
                     this might have made her irritable under it, had she not observed the
                     expression of her husband's countenance. There was upon his face not only great
                     fatigue and paleness, but exceeding distress. She said to him, "What is the
                     matter? Has anything happened? What kept you all day?"</p>
                  <p>Mr. Elwyn had thrown himself in an arm-chair, and was resting, with his head
                     back; at first he did not answer her, but when she repeated her question, he
                     said, "Certainly, I will tell you, and I would, if possible, have sent you word
                     why I could not come home, Sophie. Mr. Reed and I have at last succeeded in
                     finding out Arthur Mason."</p>
                  <p>"Have you?" said she. "Oh, how glad I am!<pb n="340-341"
                        xml:id="VAC6361-00000171"/> I have been so unhappy about him ever since the
                     day he was here." She was so taken by surprise that she forgot her secret. Mr.
                     Elwyn started up. "The day he was here; what <emph>do</emph> you mean?"</p>
                  <p>Mrs. Elwyn recollected herself in a moment, and was much embarrassed.</p>
                  <p>"Tell me, Sophie," said her husband, "has Arthur Mason been to this house since
                     his return from the South? Explain yourself, and don't deceive me." Still she
                     remained silent.</p>
                  <p>"What is the concealment?" he said. "Oh, my wife! I have seen how pleasure has
                     come between you and your family. I have seen your love for me fading away
                     under the influence of your love for admiration, and I cannot close my eyes to
                     your neglect of your child. All this I have seen, but I have thought you good
                     and true, and that there was only a cloud between us that would pass away. It
                     has made me unhappy, but I hoped you would see this in its true light, and that
                     you would come back to me. I said I would be patient, for I was so proud of
                     your beauty that I introduced you to a life, the temptations of which, proved
                     too strong for you. I thought the principles of your heart and your love for
                     me, would enable you to resist what might overcome a frailer mind. Yet the
                     result has not been so. For two years we have been almost divided; the
                     heartless amusements of society have drawn you from the devoted love of your
                     husband, the caresses of your child, and the pure happiness of domestic life.
                     But now what is it about Arthur? The very idea that you have concealed anything
                     from me is weighing me to the earth. Has he been here, and when?"</p>
                  <p>Mrs. Elwyn leaned against the mantle-piece while her husband was speaking, and
                     she had become as white as the marble. "I deserve all you have charged me
                     with," she said, "but if I concealed Arthur's visit from you, it was because I
                     thought it would do no good to tell you when it was too late. Through me,
                     through my selfishness, Arthur went away from this house, without even knowing
                     Ada was here. You may blame me as much as you choose. I have no wish to excuse
                     myself; you cannot blame me more than I deserve."</p>
                  <p>"How was it?" Mr. Elwyn asked, in an impatient tone of voice.</p>
                  <p>"I was expecting Mrs. Le Roche every moment (for I had promised to go to
                     several places with her) when Arthur came, and he had only been in the house a
                     few minutes when the carriage drove up to the door. Arthur was speaking of his
                     being obliged to earn his living now, and said something of an effort in
                     connection with the sale of books and periodicals. Mrs. Le Roche kept sending
                     in word<pb n="342-343" xml:id="VAC6361-00000172"/> she could not wait, and I
                     apologized to Arthur for not being able to remain with him."</p>
                  <p>"You did not leave him to go out with that silly woman?" interrupted Mr.
                     Elwyn.</p>
                  <p>"Yes," said Mrs. Elwyn. "I left him, and hurried up after my bonnet, intending
                     to speak with him when I came down; but when I got back, he was gone. I sent
                     John to look for him, but he was not to be found. I would have gone after him
                     myself if I had known which way to go. Oh! if you could have seen how poor and
                     how ill he looked, how thin he was, how shabby his dress, you would understand
                     how guilty I am; but I was thinking of my own pleasure. When I remembered about
                     Ada, I was perfectly miserable. How happy I might have made her and you! I
                     cannot bear to look at Ada, I have so wronged her. Since all this happened,
                     George, I have never had a peaceful moment. Can you ever forgive me?"</p>
                  <p>"I can easily forgive you," said Mr. Elwyn, "but can you ever forgive yourself
                     when you know"—</p>
                  <p>"It is not too late," said she. "You know where Arthur is; we can bring him
                     here, and keep him with us. It will make poor Ada so happy, and I am sure
                     Arthur will forgive me, for he could not bear resentment towards me, whom he
                     has always loved as a sister."</p>
                  <p>"That makes it so much sadder," said Mr. Elwyn, in a low voice. "He has indeed
                     loved you as a sister, and he will forgive you if—his forgiving spirit has not
                     passed from earth to his father's throne. Sophie," he continued, looking
                     earnestly at his wife, whose attention was fixed by his last expression,
                     "Arthur is dying in one of the poorest, most wretched tenements of this city.
                     We found him, very ill, in a cold, damp room, on a bed that not one of his
                     father's slaves would have been permitted to die on. In this severe weather, he
                     has had no fire, no food, no medicine, no comforts, for he has no money.
                     Poverty, and sickness, and death are too common, in such houses as the one in
                     which Arthur is now dying, to excite surprise or sympathy. For many months,
                     Arthur has been ill, struggling amid pain, and fever, and sorrow to earn his
                     bread; lately, he has been growing so much worse that he could do nothing. I
                     have heard, from people in the house, of his patience, and of all that he has
                     endured, though he tried to conceal it. For some time, he could bury his
                     sufferings in his own bosom, but he has become too weak to hide his burden any
                     more. During the past week, he has been stretched on that miserable bed,
                     waiting to die, for death is his only refuge. But I am talking too long. I came
                     to take Ada to see him once more, and for the last time. He has but one earthly
                     wish, and that is to see her again. Will you go, too?"</p>
                  <pb n="344-345" xml:id="VAC6361-00000173"/>
                  <p>"Oh, I cannot!" she said. "It would kill me to see him. What have I done?"
                     Exhausted with emotion, she sunk upon the bed.</p>
                  <p>"I cannot stay with you now," said Mr. Elwyn, "every moment is precious.
                     Arthur's life is hastening away. Take off this dress and these flowers, and
                     come with me to wake up Ada and prepare her for what she must go through."</p>
                  <p>"I cannot," she said, covering her face with her hands, and pressing her head
                     against the pillow. "Leave me to myself and you go to Ada."</p>
                  <p>"Sophie," said Mr. Elwyn, "does not your conscience at this moment accuse you
                     of great neglect and unkindness to an old friend?"</p>
                  <p>"Oh, yes; what would I give to recall that miserable day!"</p>
                  <p>"You can do something for him now," said Mr. Elwyn. "Tears are well enough when
                     all is over, but they are worse than useless while there is anything to be
                     done."</p>
                  <p>"What can I do?"</p>
                  <p>"I will not ask you to go and see Arthur," said Mr. Elwyn, "for you are so
                     excited and fatigued that you are better at home; try and compose yourself and
                     go wake up Ada, and help her to dress. It is time we were there. If we do not
                     hurry she will never see Arthur alive; and think what a comfort it will be to
                     speak to him, and to know his last wishes."</p>
                  <p>Sophie got up at once, when she saw she could really be of use, and changed her
                     dress, to do which, she required some assistance from her husband, she was so
                     much agitated. This accomplished, she went quickly through the hall to Ada's
                     room, gently opening the door, afraid of doing what she came to do.</p>
                  <p>Ada was in that heavy sleep into which those fall who have been watching or
                     wakeful during the first hours of the night. Sophie called her several times
                     without rousing her. Again she said, "Ada, dear Ada;" this time the sleeper
                     waked at once and turned towards her.</p>
                  <p>"What <emph>is</emph> the matter?" she exclaimed. "Oh! you have been crying;
                     has anything happened to Mr. Elwyn?"</p>
                  <p>"No, indeed," said Sophie, "he is at home, safe."</p>
                  <p>"Is Nannie sick?"</p>
                  <p>"She is well," said Sophie, hesitating to do her errand, "but Ada, Mr. Elwyn is
                     in the hall waiting to speak to you. May he come in?"</p>
                  <p>"Yes, but Sophie, what <emph>can</emph> be the matter? Mr. Elwyn," as he
                     entered in answer to his wife's call, "what kept you out? how pale you look!
                     something is wrong—please tell me!"</p>
                  <p>"Can't you think on what subject I want to<pb n="346-347"
                        xml:id="VAC6361-00000174"/> speak with you, dear Ada; you know who has been
                     the object of our most anxious thoughts and inquiries?"</p>
                  <p>"Arthur! Oh! Mr. Elwyn, tell me about Arthur; you have heard of him, I know."
                     She clasped her hands in the earnestness of her entreaty.</p>
                  <p>"I have seen him, Ada, and—"</p>
                  <p>"You have seen him, and he knows I am here?"</p>
                  <p>"Oh! yes."</p>
                  <p>"And he will come to me?"</p>
                  <p>"You must go to him, dearest Ada!"</p>
                  <p>"Oh God! he is dead!" and she sunk back on the pillow.</p>
                  <p>"No, not dead! you mistook my meaning," said Mr. Elwyn; "but he is very ill,
                     Ada, and wants you to go to him. Can you bear to do so? Are you strong enough
                     to see him in great sickness and suffering, and under the most afflicting
                     circumstances? If so, Sophie will help you dress, for we have no time to
                     lose."</p>
                  <p>"I see it all," said Ada; "he is dying; you need not tell me any more, I will
                     be ready."</p>
                  <p>Mr. Elwyn left her, and, with Sophie's assistance, but a few moments were
                     required to make her arrangements. At first, Sophie could not restrain her
                     tears, her friend's pallid face was so full of woe; but Ada's calmness
                     controlled her, and she quietly helped her to dress. When she was ready, Ada
                     threw herself on her knees, by the bedside, only for a moment, and then hurried
                     to join Mr. Elwyn, who was walking in the hall. Sophie followed her to the foot
                     of the steps, where Mr. Elwyn stood when he heard them coming. He turned from
                     Ada to his wife—"Go and lie down by Nannie, and try and get a little sleep," he
                     said.</p>
                  <p>She drew him aside from Ada; "Tell Arthur," she said, "that I loved him, though
                     I treated him so unkindly; and beg him to forgive me."</p>
                  <p>"He will! he has!" said her husband; "as soon as he breathes his last, dearest,
                     I will bring Ada home, and you can be everything to her, now she is so
                     desolate. Go out of this cold air." He left her, and went with Ada to the
                     carriage, and giving the coachman the direction, he told him to drive rapidly
                     on.</p>
                  <p>It was now daybreak, and the weather was intensely cold. The streets were quite
                     deserted, as they rode through them, square after square, where the luxurious
                     dwellings of the rich towered in the gray light. Mr. Elwyn drew Ada's furs
                     around her, and expressed his fears lest she should take cold. The kindness of
                     his voice and manner overcame her, and she burst into tears; it was better that
                     they should flow unrestrained, and Mr. Elwyn did not disturb her. She first
                     broke the silence.</p>
                  <p>"He is dying, you say, Mr. Elwyn, and you may<pb n="348-349"
                        xml:id="VAC6361-00000175"/> think that is all I need know; but where has he
                     been all this time? and how is it that we could not hear of him?"</p>
                  <p>"He has been in New York, Ada, as I always thought; when he came here from
                     Alabama, he commenced teaching French and Spanish, and got along for a while,
                     but his health failed rapidly; he has been sick for a long time, and has
                     suffered a great deal; you must be prepared to see a sad change in him. Illness
                     and poverty have done their work."</p>
                  <p>"But think of his not calling upon us," said Ada, still weeping. "Oh! how glad
                     we would have been to serve him?"</p>
                  <p>"Assuredly! dear Ada, but Arthur's pride made him averse to asking favors. When
                     he grew so ill that he was unable to do anything for himself, and being
                     entirely without money, his clothes were sold to meet his wants. I should not
                     tell you all this, were it not my duty to prepare you for the situation in
                     which you will find him. We got the first intelligence of him, through a young
                     man who learned French of him, though he had lately lost sight of him. All
                     yesterday morning, we spent trying to hear something more. We went to the house
                     where he lived when he took pupils; he had left a good impression there, and
                     the people told us all they knew; it was not much, but it prompted us to seek
                     further. I need not go into all the particulars of our search; at three o'clock
                     we came to a large, but ordinary boarding-house, where we learned he had been,
                     though he had left there, too, and was lying ill, somewhere in the
                     neighborhood; this information, as you know, was not calculated to make us give
                     over our search; we went from house to house in the square to which we were
                     directed, until we found him, and were told at the door that he was very low. I
                     asked for the person who kept the house, and inquired of her the particulars of
                     his condition. She said he was very ill, and had been so for a long time; that
                     he had no physician, and in fact, that he had no money for anything. She added
                     she had done what she could for him, but that she was very poor, and had a
                     number of children. We asked her to show us to his room, first telling her to
                     supply everything that he might want from this time, and we would be
                     responsible for the payment of such expenses as he had incurred, or might
                     incur. She led us to his chamber, where, dear Ada! it is of no use to conceal
                     anything from you, we found our much loved Arthur in a dying state. I will not
                     describe the wretchedness of his room, you will see it for yourself, but I must
                     tell you how he received me.</p>
                  <p>"Mr. Read and I stood for a few moments by the bed, after we went in, for
                     Arthur was asleep, or, at<pb n="350-351" xml:id="VAC6361-00000176"/> least, his
                     eyes were closed. A slight attack of coughing, followed by gasping and
                     struggling for breath, roused him to full consciousness. He looked at us, and
                     at first seemed confused, turning, as if in inquiry, to the landlady.</p>
                  <p>"'Arthur, my dear friend!' said Mr. Read, 'don't you know us?'</p>
                  <p>"'Ah yes!' said Arthur, his face brightening up with pleased emotion; 'and you
                     too, George,' turning to me. 'I see I am not forgotten.'</p>
                  <p>"I told him how long we had been looking for him, and of the many anxious fears
                     we had suffered on his account, but he was so weak that I was almost afraid to
                     talk to him; I stood by him a little while, and then left him, with Mr. Read
                     sitting by him, holding his hand; I wanted to see the landlady again. I asked
                     her what he had eaten that morning. 'Nothing;' she had taken a cup of tea to
                     him and he had drank half. 'I could not do much for him,' said the poor
                     creature, 'it is hard for me to keep myself and children from starvation. I am
                     losing now the rent of the room he is in, though I have told him not to trouble
                     himself about <emph>that</emph>, he was welcome. He'll not be in my way long.'
                     Of course I assured her she should lose nothing, and that I would amply
                     remunerate her for any further trouble and expense; that she might not be
                     afraid to trust me, I gave her twenty dollars for what she had already done, or
                     rather towards the payment of the debt. I spoke to a youth who was lounging
                     about the premises, and asked him to go for Dr. Rodgers, and that if he could
                     not find him, to go, without any delay, for another physician, mentioning one
                     or two others, promising him a dollar as soon as he came back with one. I
                     mention these particulars that you may feel certain I did all that could be
                     done under these distressing circumstances, though I saw we could only supply
                     Arthur with comforts; nothing, dear Ada, can restore him to us.</p>
                  <p>"Knowing something of the symptoms, and of the treatment of a patient in the
                     last stages of consumption, I sent to Stevens' for some of his best wine, and
                     set the good-hearted woman, who had sheltered Arthur, to making some broth, of
                     which he took a little. Then I went back to the sick room and made up the fire.
                     I found Arthur coughing desperately, and oh! how he suffered in the gasping for
                     breath that followed. Mr. Read raised him on the pillow at first, and then
                     getting on the bed himself, supported Arthur's head on his breast. Arthur
                     seemed much relieved by the change of attitude. When I went up to the bed, he
                     smiled, and offered me his hand. 'God has sent friends to administer to me in
                     my latest need,' he whispered; 'I thank him.' His manner was very solemn.</p>
                  <p>"A moment after, the woman came in with more<pb n="352-353"
                        xml:id="VAC6361-00000177"/> wood, that she threw on. Arthur watched the
                     flame as it rose up, and then said to me, 'This is your work, George, and I
                     will not object, for it is a pleasure to you to take care of me.' But every
                     time that he spoke the coughing came on, so I asked him not to talk, and I
                     would tell him of all of his friends.</p>
                  <p>"'First of Ada,' he said.</p>
                  <p>"I told him all; of your unchanging attachment to him; your coming to New York
                     in the hope of meeting him; your sorrow and disappointment in not hearing of
                     him; of the death of your mother, and of your wish to share with him the large
                     fortune that you owned. He was much affected, and showed evident surprise at
                     hearing of your mother's death. He said he had been averse to troubling any of
                     his friends, though he knew they would be glad to serve him; he confessed that
                     pride, too much pride, had urged him to keep his secret. When he spoke of you
                     his eyes filled with tears, and his voice almost failed him. I begged him to be
                     silent, and told him that we could guess all his wishes. I told him I knew that
                     you would come to him as soon as you heard of his illness. 'Oh! yes,' he said,
                     'once more, once more! but this room, this house!' I knew he did not like to
                     bring you to such a place, but told him <emph>that</emph> was a small thing
                     compared to the consolation it would be to you to see him, and I added, a
                     physician would soon be here.</p>
                  <p>"He exclaimed, 'too late!' but I insisted upon his being quiet, for I saw that
                     excitement was wearing him away; he closed his eyes and appeared to try and
                     compose himself, but the gasping spells came on so dreadfully that I was afraid
                     he would expire before Dr. Rodgers came.</p>
                  <p>"They told me the doctor was in the house, and I went down to explain to him
                     the circumstances under which he would see Arthur; imagine his amazement when
                     he found who was to be his patient, in this miserable house, for he attended
                     Mr. Mason in all his sickness, and thought, as every one else did, that he was
                     very wealthy. We went up to see Arthur, who knew him immediately, though he did
                     not speak. The doctor gave him some of the wine that I had sent for, and
                     everything that could be done, was done. We stayed with him all the afternoon
                     and night, thinking each hour would be his last, for the coughing and
                     hemorrhage increased so that he did not speak all through the night. Towards
                     morning he began to revive, in consequence of the stimulants Dr. Rodgers gave
                     him; he seemed much better, though the doctor assured me it was only by a
                     miracle that he could last twelve hours.</p>
                  <p>"When this change for the better took place, he beckoned to me, and said,
                     'Ada.' I told the doctor,<pb n="354-355" xml:id="VAC6361-00000178"/> in
                     explanation, that I had promised to go for you. He said that any excitement
                     might bring on the spells of coughing again, but that he could, under the
                     circumstances, make no objection to Arthur's seeing you. I thought I ought to
                     run the risk, and so, dear Ada, I have brought you to this sad place. I feel
                     for you most sincerely; but though it will be very distressing for you to see
                     Arthur now, yet after the first grief is over, it will be a comfort to you to
                     have been with him in his last moments."</p>
                  <p>Ada had been afraid of losing one word of Mr. Elwyn's account, but as it
                     closed, she wept very much, though she exerted herself to be calm when Mr.
                     Elwyn told her they were driving up to the house. A wretched house it was! Ada
                     looked up at it; with the rapidity of thought, she went, far away, to her home
                     in the South, Arthur's birthplace, and her own, and the scene of their happy
                     childhood. Born heir to a large estate, nurtured with the fondest care, in this
                     old building was dying the object of so much affection and solicitude. Such a
                     reflection glanced through Ada's mind as Mr. Elwyn was leading her up the
                     broken porch, and into the house; but she nerved herself to bear the worst, and
                     Mr. Elwyn whispered words of sympathy and encouragement.</p>
                  <p>As Mr. Elwyn reached the hall-door, and pushed it open, he saw the landlady,
                     who was already stirring ring about at her work. She came forward to meet them,
                     and, as in answer to Mr. Elwyn's look, said, "He is alive, sir, but he can't
                     last long. Walk in, ma'am; it is very cold. I have no fire yet to ask you to
                     warm yourself by, but there is a good one in his room; he needed it long before
                     he had it." She led the way up the stairs, and stopped before the chamber
                     door.</p>
                  <p>Ada's heart beat so that she feared she would not be able to command herself
                     enough to go in. She went a few steps further down the hall, and proposed that
                     Mr. Elwyn should leave her to collect herself; he consented, saying that he
                     would go and prepare Arthur for her coming. He went in, and she continued
                     walking up and down the cold, uncarpeted boards of the hall, praying silently
                     but fervently for strength to meet this hour. Her prayer was heard; in a few
                     moments the storm in her breast subsided. There was a calm; Jesus had said to
                     the winds and waves, be still!</p>
                  <p>Mr. Elwyn found Arthur panting and gasping after another frightful spell of
                     coughing. His eyes were shut, and Mr. Read and Dr. Rodgers, who had just come
                     in, were watching him, in prospect of the dying struggle. But it was not quite
                     here; the breath came with less effort, and in a few minutes the gasping and
                     coughing entirely ceased. Mr. Elwyn saw the change of a few hours; deep
                        shadows<pb n="356-357" xml:id="VAC6361-00000179"/> were settling under the
                     eyes and mouth, and the whiteness of the forehead was, if possible, more
                     dazzling. He turned away, and asked himself how he could have brought that poor
                     girl to witness such a scene. He could not but blame himself, for what comfort
                     could she have in seeing Arthur speechless, and unable to move? It had been
                     better to wait until all was over; he almost determined to go to her, and
                     induce her to go home, lest Arthur should die in an agony that would impress
                     itself upon her heart, as the chief recollection of him. He approached Dr.
                     Rodgers, and asked, whispering, if there were any material change. The doctor
                     bowed, and closed his eyes. "Ada was come; should he bring her in?" Arthur
                     himself answered the question; he had caught the sound of her name. He opened
                     his eyes, looked at Mr. Elwyn, and said, "Where is she?"</p>
                  <p>"She is in the house," said the doctor. "Shall Mr. Elwyn bring her in?" He
                     bowed, and an expression of satisfaction passed over his face; he watched Mr.
                     Elwyn, who went to the door, and presently returned, but not alone.</p>
                  <p>Ada glided into the room. Looking towards the bed, she stopped suddenly,
                     appalled at what she saw; her most vivid fears had not prepared her for the
                     reality, but she recovered her self-possession, knowing that her own feelings
                     must now be forgotten. She timidly approached, and stood by Arthur.</p>
                  <p>There they were, face to face—these early friends. The dying man was not paler
                     than the poor girl, who now realized, for the first time, that she must give
                     him up. Sickness and want had not brought to his face the unutterable woe, that
                     the comprehension of his situation threw into hers. She looked at him
                     curiously, as if saying, "Can this be true?" The answer was before her. She
                     clasped her hands tightly over her bosom, looked up to God, and then knelt down
                     beside the lover of her infancy, her childhood, and her youth.</p>
                  <p>"Arthur," she said, and her voice was like the low cadence of distant and
                     melancholy music, "I have loved you as never woman loved before; had I known
                     you were ill, I would have nursed you so faithfully! yet you did not call me to
                     you. I do not reproach you, but I want to assure you before we part, that next
                     to God, you have been, and are, most dear to me; most dear, since that happy
                     time when your mother taught us both to pray. Oh! my soul has so clung to the
                     hope of meeting you again, and now we meet only to part forever." She laid her
                     head on the pillow, by him, clasped his hand with both of hers, and looked in
                     his face. Dr. Rodgers turned away from the affecting spectacle, and the old
                     friend of these young people sobbed<pb n="358-359" xml:id="VAC6361-00000180"/>
                     aloud, while Mr. Elwyn watched Arthur's expressive face, to see how, in his
                     latest moments, he bore a parting, from which man in the fullest health and
                     vigor would have shrunk.</p>
                  <p>Strength was given him. The faintest tinge of color overspread his dying
                     countenance. "Not forever," he said, "Ada, beloved one!" These words,
                     distinctly uttered, were all that he attempted. Ada raised her head, then,
                     standing up, waited as if expecting him to say more; but it was all. He lifted
                     his arm and pointed upwards; a smile most heavenly passed over his face, to
                     which, alas! an ashy paleness succeeded.</p>
                  <p>Mr. Elwyn leaned against the bed, and took to his bosom the head that was to
                     ache no more.</p>
                  <p>The other friends, in silence, gathered closely around him. The awful moment
                     was approaching; the herald of the King of Terrors had announced his coming,
                     but gently had the summons fallen upon the ear that was awaiting it. Arthur
                     looked up to Mr. Elwyn, as if in gratitude to the faithful friend whose breast
                     was his last earthly support, glanced towards the doctor and Mr. Read, and
                     slightly bowed—then his eye fixed upon Ada. Fading as was its brightness, love,
                     unchanging, undying, beamed from its very depths; such love as is born on earth
                     to live forever in heaven. Ada replied to this look, with one of the fondest
                     affection; then Love, eternal nal, everlasting Love—passing the love of
                     woman—triumphed over this mighty sorrow. Ada said, softly but distinctly, "I am
                     the resurrection and the life; he that believeth in me, though he were dead,
                     yet shall he live.</p>
                  <p>"And whosoever liveth, and believeth in me, shall never die."</p>
                  <p>Arthur heard the glorious verse; his look expressed full recognition of its
                     import. Ada was silent now, for Arthur's lips murmured, but only one word; it
                     was "Jesus." He breathed it forth with his latest sigh—and fell asleep.</p>

                  <p>LET her alone; do not force her away yet. He is at rest, but alas for her! Is
                     it not fearful to see two souls separated, that have together grown?</p>
                  <p>They are all weeping; the doctor, so used to death-scenes, the old man, the
                     devoted friend, even that poor woman, whose heart is almost hardened with the
                     struggle for her own and her children's bread, she is weeping aloud. "Let her
                     alone," she says; "do not force her away yet." Oh! woman, seared by poverty and
                     association with vice, this scene has softened your heart! Weep for Ada and for
                     yourself, and for your sex. Let your tears flow on; the lot of woman, so often
                     the victim of love of gold, of station, of the world, deserves them all.</p>
                  <p>Draw her away gently, but firmly; it is enough. She has kissed, again and
                     again, the pale lips and the paler brow. Earth claims her rights—the body to
                     the ground, ashes to ashes dust to dust.</p>
                  <p>"Ada," said Mr. Elwyn, putting his arm around her, "you must come now." But
                     still she clung there. Mr. Read spoke to her, "Ada, my poor girl, he is happy;
                     let us pray that we may one day join him." He kneeled down by the corpse, and
                     they all followed him; the woman, who had not prayed for years, hesitated, and
                     then kneeled too, and every word of that old man's prayer was written in her
                     heart by some angel hand—that prayer so short and fervent. When it ceased, Ada
                     once more bent her head, pressed her lips upon the white forehead, then turned
                     to Mr. Elwyn. She was ready to go, and he led her towards the door; but she
                     turned again, looked at the silent form, then raised her glance to Mr. Elwyn;
                     he understood it. "I will take you home, Ada, and then I shall come back to
                     have our dear friend removed to our house; he will not be left alone. Mr. Read
                     will stay here until my return." Ada lingered a moment; it was the last look,
                     and then she left the room. Mr. Elwyn put on her cloak, and the landlady
                     offered to assist her uncertain steps to the carriage.</p>
                  <p>Ada, with that forgetfulness of herself that had always been a lovely point in
                     her character, took the woman's hand. "You sheltered him," she said, "when he
                     was in want of shelter and of friends.</p>
                  <pb n="362-363" xml:id="VAC6361-00000182"/>
                  <p>Dying, he asked Mr. Elwyn to repay you, and to thank you. I can pay you in
                     money for what you gave him, but I can never thank you as you deserve. May God
                     reward you."</p>
                  <p>"Oh, it's little that I did!" said the woman, "but God knows that I was willing
                     to do more if I had had the money. It was a poor place for him to die in, and
                     he suffered enough, but he never complained. I knew he was used to better than
                     I could do for him, and I told him he ought to let some of his friends know of
                     his sickness, but he said, 'No; it will only be for a little while." Mr. Elwyn
                     drew Ada away to the carriage, and ordered the driver to hurry home. Now the
                     city was alive; men and women were passing in every street, but Ada was not
                     conscious of any difference between the bustle of the morning and the still hum
                     of night, when she went forth with throbbing heart. It was over! Her mind was
                     dwelling on that look, which rewarded her for all that she had suffered; she
                     felt this, even in the first hours of her grief.</p>
                  <p>Mrs. Elwyn met them at the door she had seen the carriage drive up, and could
                     hardly wait to hear the tidings her husband might bring. Oh, if Arthur would
                     but recover, how much she would do to make up for her cruel neglect! She had
                     lived months in the last few hours. She slept a little while by her child, for
                     she could not lie down alone in her own room; every thought was a spectre of
                     death or of the grave; lying in the hearse, or wrapped in the pall, Arthur's
                     melancholy face and attenuated form were always before her. But still she hoped
                     he might get well, for persons who had been thought dying had recovered, and
                     she called to mind those who were considered dead, and had revived, to live for
                     years.</p>
                  <p>Most slowly passed the anxious hours. As she could not sleep, she tried to
                     occupy herself by arranging her wardrobe and her jewel-case, offices always
                     left to her maid; but she soon threw the dresses and laces by, and closed her
                     jewel-case in disgust. In her desire that Arthur might recover, she thought of
                     prayer, but God had been so completely forgotten—his name, except in blasphemy
                     or thoughtlessness had not even been mentioned in the scenes of the last few
                     years, and she could not feel that she had prayed from her velvet footstool in
                        church—<emph>that</emph> was, with her, all mockery.</p>
                  <p>Her husband's countenance told her the tidings as he met her; then he
                     whispered, "Ada is more than ever our sister; <emph>now</emph> she has none but
                     us." She had no time to answer, for, looking in Ada's face, she saw her very
                     faint. Mr. Elwyn perceived it at the same moment, and he lifted her to the
                     lounge in the sitting-room. She was quite insensible when she was laid there,
                     and it was some minutes before they<pb n="364-365" xml:id="VAC6361-00000183"/>
                     could restore her to consciousness. Sophie sat down by her, and wept bitterly.
                     Ada might have envied her those tears, her own grief was so silent and so
                     terrible.</p>
                  <p>Mr. Elwyn asked his wife to order some coffee at once, for he was obliged to go
                     away again, and he hoped Ada would drink some. Then he motioned her to follow
                     him to the other room.</p>
                  <p>He hesitated, as if about to propose something that might not be acceptable to
                     her; then he said, "There is but one thing we can do now for Arthur, and for
                     Ada. I am sure you will, to the utmost of your power, console Ada, but I know
                     your great timidity as regards everything connected with death; I hope you will
                     not give way to this, for I intend to have Arthur removed here as soon as
                     possible, that he may be buried from this house."</p>
                  <p>"Oh, heavens! no!" said Mrs. Elwyn, in violent agitation. "You certainly do not
                     mean to bring him here. Have some pity on me, and don't bring that dead body to
                     the house. When he was alive, his face haunted me, and I, who might have saved
                     his life, how can I see him dead? Oh, don't bring him here!"</p>
                  <p>"I am ashamed to see you give way to this superstitious dread," said Mr. Elwyn.
                     "It is indeed true that you might have been the means of saving his life, but
                     that is past. He died a lingering death, without ordinary comforts until he was
                     so far gone that he could not be benefited by them. In all his sufferings, no
                     physician, no food, no friend to care for him! Oh, my wife, you ought to have
                     heard that racking cough! You ought to have seen the blood oozing from his
                     mouth! the heaving of his skeleton chest! the unnatural glare in his once soft
                     and beautiful eyes! "With all this, you ought to have heard him say to Ada one
                     word, the name of Jesus, a name that we have, by our life, despised. You ought
                     to have seen his head sink upon my bosom at the last; then you would have
                     realized what you have done. I don't wonder that you shudder at the thought of
                     his being brought here in a coffin."</p>
                  <p>Mr. Elwyn's voice failed, and he could not restrain his tears; his wife was
                     shocked to see him in grief, for all their married life had been so gay, if not
                     so happy. She was awed at the thought of death within her own doors, and a kind
                     of horror overcame her, so that she could not answer her husband. He saw this,
                     and said, "Sophie! Arthur was your friend in your happiest days; how often you
                     have visited him in his father's house, where he could command every attention,
                     as the only child of a good and wealthy man. You have seen him much admired in
                     the most select circles of our society. But in the course of human events, he
                     became poor;<pb n="366-367" xml:id="VAC6361-00000184"/> he asked of you, at
                     your door, the common offices of charity; you denied them. Much as I feel for
                     you, I will not deny the grief that I feel at the remembrance of your selfish
                     conduct, but I will say no more of that; your own reflections will, some time
                     or other, condemn you. Sophie! your friend, he whom you once loved, whom, I
                     know by your tears, you still love, is no more; his body lies in the abode of
                     poverty; he died under a shelter given him by a destitute woman. Had you seen
                     the forlorn aspect of that miserable house, its unfurnished rooms, its
                     tottering walls falling into decay; had you seen those who have been living
                     under the same roof with one who was so intellectual, so refined—oh! conquer
                     this superstitious terror that would deny to the remains of a friend the last
                     sad burial rites."</p>
                  <p>"Oh! no," said Mrs. Elwyn, "but, I dread to see a coffin come in the house; to
                     have death so close to me."</p>
                  <p>"It must come closer still, and I would be glad if I thought you and I would be
                     as ready to meet it as poor Arthur was. Now I must go; take good care of
                     Ada."</p>
                  <p>"When will you be back?"</p>
                  <p>"As soon as I can make the arrangements."</p>
                  <p>"George," said Mrs. Elwyn, after a moment of thought, "did you ask his
                     forgiveness for me?"</p>
                  <p>"There was no time, he was failing so fast."</p>
                  <p>They went back to Ada, whom they found sitting up with Nannie in her arms, and
                     weeping violently. The kisses of the child had softened the first hard grief.
                     Nannie looked surprised, but was quiet, until her mother sat down by Ada and
                     wept with her; then the little girl held out her arms to her nurse, frightened
                     at the display of feeling that she could not understand. Mr. Elwyn brought Ada
                     a cup of coffee, that she drank, in compliance with his request; Mr. Elwyn
                     drank his and hurried away. Then Mrs. Elwyn persuaded Ada to go to her room,
                     and lie down; but she could not rest, and got up again to walk about the room,
                     after stopping at the window to look for what Mrs. Elwyn dreaded to see. Thus
                     passed the day. Mrs. Elwyn never left her, and wept continually. Towards
                     evening, Mr. Elwyn and some other gentlemen, in a carriage, accompanying the
                     hearse containing all that remained of Arthur Mason, stopped at the door. Ada,
                     though she had watched and waited for it, shrunk from the sight; Sophie,
                     trembling, turned away too. To her, the night that followed was one long to be
                     remembered.</p>
                  <p>All through the evening were heard low voices and careful steps; they were
                     covering the furniture and making the usual preparations. Very late, the house
                     became still, though, occasionally, a soft step was heard. Two gentlemen,
                     acquaintances of Arthur<pb n="368-369" xml:id="VAC6361-00000185"/> thur, of
                     whose death Mr. Elwyn had informed them, sat up with him. Mr. Elwyn, quite worn
                     out, slept heavily all night; even Ada slept, as is often the case with those
                     who are stunned with grief. An old servant woman, who had always lived with
                     Sophie, having nursed her in her infancy, slept in the room with Ada, but she
                     was far more anxious about her mistress, who was wandering from her own to
                     Ada's room, and to whom this night was a period of intense thought and
                     suffering. That silent form below was speaking awful words to the woman of
                     fashion; words of reproach and of warning. She envied her husband his tranquil
                     repose; she envied Ada her heavy stupor, for there was too much sorrow in that
                     young face to call it sleep; she shrunk from looking towards that part of the
                     house where the corpse lay, and yet a strange fascination impelled her to go
                     down, to uncover the face, and look at it; it was once a fair face to look
                     upon, what was it now? Oh! would her own, ere long, change so? would she lie so
                     helpless and so quiet while others watched and wept? She conjured up a thousand
                     horrors, yet towards morning she fell asleep, to dream of a great assembly
                     where all was splendor and display, but ever the faces were changing as she
                     looked at them, turning white and death-like, so that she was glad to awake and
                     see the sunshine.</p>
                  <p>Her first thought was for Ada, who was very calm; Sophie wished she might see
                     her weep, it would be better than to sit so quietly, looking desolate. Mr.
                     Elwyn tried to persuade her to see Arthur now that all was as it should be; he
                     said the face was far more pleasant to look at than before death. "But," she
                     said; "I do not wish to see him in his coffin; I would rather remember him
                     living, as he was before God brought upon him such accumulated sorrows. I am
                     not unreconciled; at least, I desire to say, Thy will be done. One of these
                     days, I will visit his grave; it will be a pleasure to recall his early piety,
                     the purity of his life, and the triumphant death that he died."</p>
                  <p>"Ada," said Mr. Elwyn; "how do you reconcile what the Bible says of God's love
                     to his people, with Arthur's sufferings—with his dying under circumstances so
                     aggravated. Born to wealth, think of his coming to die destitute of
                     everything!"</p>
                  <p>"Jesus was the Son of God," said Ada solemnly; "heaven was his throne, earth
                     his footstool, yet he gave up his mortal life on the Cross, and in the company
                     of thieves. I try to forget all connected with Arthur's dying hour—all but his
                     pleasure in seeing me, and the faith that supported him so effectually; in all
                     his suffering, Jesus was very near; that wretched bed was 'soft as downy
                     pillows are.' Now he is comforted. He walks the golden streets. He bends before
                     the Throne. He talks with Christ, and<pb n="370-371" xml:id="VAC6361-00000186"
                     /> with the prophets and martyrs, of mysteries that he could not comprehend
                     here."</p>
                  <p>Very sad were the tones of Ada's voice as she spoke; she was offering herself a
                     consolation for which nature was hardly prepared. Jesus wept, and so must
                     we.</p>
                  <p>Sophie was induced by her husband to go and look upon the face of their lost
                     friend, the calm expression she saw there, soothed her mind from its unnatural
                     terror, but while her feelings were softened, her tears flowed. She knew that
                     he had forgiven her; pardon was written on those marble features, yet, not less
                     severe were the reproaches of her heart; the world had left something within
                     that was good.</p>
                  <p>They were glad when they saw Ada give way to what she could no longer
                     control—the violence of grief. When she heard, for she would not see the slow
                     departure of the funeral train, it said to her, now indeed he is gone, and like
                     Martha and Mary she was ready to exclaim, "If thou hadst been here.</p>
                  <p>The circumstances of Arthur's death made a lasting impression on Mr. Elwyn's
                     mind, that had long been seriously disposed. Ada's society and grief deepened
                     the influence. He added another one to the many devoted and energetic
                     Christians, who are carrying on God's work in New York. Ada divides her time
                     with the Elwyns and some friends at the south; she lives a life of zealous
                     devotion to the interests of religion.</p>
                  <p>Nor was Mrs. Elwyn's mind unmoved by what so deeply affected others. The world
                     never willingly gives up its claim on one who has been subjected to its
                     bondage, but the woman of fashion was induced to think. Her selfishness, and
                     its painful consequences to Arthur, often came back to her, and always brought
                     tears with the remembrance. Her husband's energetic piety, Ada's unostentatious
                     usefulness, the bidding forth of the sweet dispositions of her child, were
                     talismans to draw her to reflection. It is rarely that a steady example of a
                     holy life, such as was shown by Ada or Mr. Elwyn, is without an influence. God
                     works by mysteries; his way are unfathomable, yet secret as are his purposes,
                     he brings to himself his own. If it be his voice we hear in the deafening
                     thunder, it is his love that we recognize in the beauty of the smallest flower.
                     Small things we may consider many of the means that he uses to arrest the soul
                     in its carelessness. A dream, a word fitly spoken, the meeting of a funeral
                     train in the street, have in many cases been the instruments that God has used
                     to bring man to Himself.</p>
                  <p>It is not, then, without reason, that Mrs. Elwyn's friends hope that God's
                     spirit may yet draw her away from an inordinate love of fashionable
                        amusements<pb n="372-373" xml:id="VAC6361-00000187"/> ments. It would be
                     afflicting indeed, if in looking round at the number of women, lovers of
                     pleasure rather than of God—most appalling would be the thought that He who
                     said, "Ye cannot love God and mammon," would finally condemn <emph>all</emph>
                     of these to eternal banishment from his presence.</p>

                  <head>YOUTH.</head>
                  <p>WERE I a poet, I would write a dirge; a requiem for my youth. For it is dead
                     and still unburied. No pall of velvet conceals it from my sight; over and
                     around it seems to flutter a gossamer veil. Memory pierces this gauze-like
                     texture. Every feature is distinct; the form is most graceful in its repose.
                     Yet there is a barrier between us, and on it is written in iron symbols,
                     Nevermore; I look beyond this barrier and weep. Would I approach? the vision
                     recedes noiselessly, the veil floats over it. I call upon it to return. "Oh
                     beautiful youth! come again." There is no voice. Gone! dead! and yet, oh!
                     world-worn heart! what pleasure now so great as to contemplate it.</p>
                  <p>What has made that bar that stands between me and my former self? It is Time.
                     Ah! the wretch! "He sows canker into hearts of rosebuds, and writes wrinkles
                     (which are his odious attempts at pot-hooks) in the loveliest of female faces."
                        And<pb n="376-377" xml:id="VAC6361-00000189"/> something better, oh, opium
                     eater! thou hast said of a happiness and glory that once and forever has
                     perished. So it is with my youth.</p>
                  <p>Tell me, thou vision, peaceful and fair, beautiful youth! wherefore the pang
                     that thou art no more?</p>
                  <p>"With me departed, forever, perfect confidence and trust, all sweet reliance on
                     others, all faith in man and woman. When my brow paled, the mantle of innocence
                     fell from thy shoulders; in its place thou hast wrapped about thee a cloak to
                     hide from the world the unquiet heart, that while I lived had no secrets. My
                     eyes closed, and no more thine looked out for the glory and beauty of the
                     passing day; for, clouded by beholding the contest, and tear dimmed, they fail
                     to look up hopefully, bending their glances upon the earth. The color faded
                     from my cheek; and upon thine, no longer thought writes, with rose-tinted ink,
                     now dyeing with the deepest hue, now fading into the faintest blush. The breath
                     went out from my nostrils, and from the altar of thine heart never more could
                     arise aspirations pure as the breath of dewy morn, that the stag inhales, and
                     throws back his head to enjoy its fragrance. Closed were my lips; and thine—Oh!
                     they have learned the language of the world! Sweet words they utter—enticing
                     talk, such as we hear in the prattle of the rivulet as it winds its way, and as
                     meaningless. My heart gently throbbed itself to rest; and thine?"</p>
                  <p>I am answered. Yet I am content, Oh! glorious youth! to have thee in
                     remembrance. There are those for whom the past has no such picture. My youth
                     revelled for a while, then serenely floated away. Its contemplation is, to me,
                     as are to the child, the gorgeous wings of the butterfly. I bear its memory in
                     my bosom, as does a mother her first born.</p>
                  <p>But answer once more, days of my youth! couldst thou not dwell with me a little
                     longer? Thou wert the minutest grain in the hour-glass. As in the rose, I <q>

                  <head type="sub">PICTURES FROM LIFE.</head>
                  <p>THERE are those who were shrouded in their youth. I remember one, whom I saw
                     for the last time, as she stood gazing at her own picture; her voice, sweet and
                     low and trembling, slowly enunciated these questions: "Is it like me? is the
                     countenance cheerful?" Then she murmured to herself, "I tried to look happy.
                     Oh! my mother!"</p>
                  <p>She was very young, hardly, I should judge from her appearance, past seventeen.
                     Her forehead was low, and her glossy black hair was pushed away from it, and
                     arranged in great luxuriance, on the back of her head. It waved in satin
                     masses, and the carelessness, but taste with which its owner had twined it
                     around a small comb that supported its weight, made it a great ornament. The
                     dark eyebrows, it may be, were a shade too heavy, and while the young lady,
                     looked down at the picture, I noticed the long sweep of her eyelashes, and the
                     general cast of her features. They were not regular lar, but they were far from
                     being indifferent, yet their beauty was in the expression. Her cheek was pale;
                     but the countenance and the full handsome bust indicated health. She was
                     standing by an armchair, behind which, her white arms resting on its carved
                     back, was a very fair girl. She, too, was looking at the picture.</p>
                  <p>I could not turn away from them. It was a charming group upon which the eyes
                     and mind might rest. Once more the young lady said to her friend, "Tell me if
                     the face looks natural and cheerful?"</p>
                  <p>As she spoke, she raised her eyes to read the answer, that was not readily
                     uttered. Perhaps it was because I was looking so intently at her, that, for a
                     moment, she fixed her gaze upon me, as she looked up—only for a moment—yet I
                     can never forget that impressive look. In the depths of those dark eyes
                     dwelt—what was it, a joy? Oh! no. Deeper was the darkness of her eyes from the
                     long lashes that curtained them, but there was a softness, a melancholy
                     sweetness in them that fascinated me. I was sure there was some cause in that
                     young heart for the twilight beauty of the face. I longed to ask if sorrow had
                     already fallen on one so young. If—But she was gone, while I looked upon her.
                     Soon an acquaintance joined me. "Did you observe," she asked, "the young lady
                     that just left the room?<pb n="380-381" xml:id="VAC6361-00000191"/> She has had
                     her likeness taken for her mother. She will, to-morrow, take the white veil,
                     for she is going to be a nun."</p>
                  <p>Oh! could it be that such was the sad destiny of that young creature? Health,
                     and beauty, and youth, and all youth's graces—were these to be crushed by the
                     gloomy life of the cloister? Was that beautiful hair, woman's glory, to be cut
                     off, cast aside, and trampled upon? Were those eyes to close to the lovely
                     visions of earth? those ears to shut out the music of the voices of friends,
                     the harmony of life, forever? Was that form to be enclosed in the mock sanctity
                     of the nun's garment, that brow to be shadowed by the heavy veil, the funereal
                     badge of a living death? Were all the love, and genius, and thought, that met
                     in the wondrous depths of those eyes, were they to be as— <q>

                           <l>"When the lamp is shattered,</l>
                           <l>The light in the dust lies dead?"</l>
                        </lg>
                     </q> Was that sweet voice to be heard no more in its once happy home? I could
                     have wept as these sad thoughts passed rapidly through my mind, and one who
                     stood near, as if reading their import, repeated—"Poor girl! she is going to be
                     a nun."</p>
                  <p>And will she ever awake from this dream, that even now bewilders her? How full
                     of meaning were her own words—"I tried to look cheerful and happy." Already the
                     mask presses against the soul it would hide, as it struggles to illume or to
                     sadden the ingenuous face of youth. The effort of her life is truly to
                     commence. Farewell to any real enjoyment! <emph>it will be required of her, "to
                        try and look happy</emph>."</p>
                  <p>But not, oh! maiden, for the sake of the mother who has so tenderly reared
                     thee, who bore thee on her bosom in infancy, who hoped to have guided thy
                     joyous youth, and to have been cheered by thy society in her fading years! Thou
                     wilt make the last return for all her affection, when thou shalt place in her
                     hands the transfer of thy sweet, sad features. Thou hast not, as did thy
                     Redeemer, with his last breathings, provided for a mother's comfort; thou hast
                     deserted her. Hereafter, in sickness and in sorrow, another voice than thine
                     will cheer her, another hand administer to her need. Thou, in thy solitary,
                     cheerless cell, wilt one day wake from thine illusion, clasp thy rosary, and
                     look back, sorrowing, to the time when, ere seeking thine own pillow, thou,
                     resting thy head beside hers, pressed upon her lips a loving good-night. Ah!
                     the remorse that will lengthen those gloomy days! the penances and prayers that
                     will be performed in vain, through those dreary nights! There will be no friend
                     near, then, to bear to that mother a wish to return. Yet, as now, thou wilt try
                     to look happy, until the grave<pb n="382-383" xml:id="VAC6361-00000192"/> will
                     enclose thee and thy strange secret in its unyielding embrace forever.</p>

                  <p>Does she still live? Hast heard, my reader, of being buried alive? Such a fate
                     is hers. Not in the earth; in that darker sepulchre—the cloister.</p>
                  <p>Another I remember who was shrouded in her youth; her name was Eunice. So
                     dazzling fair was her brow, that a star might have lived where, when dressed
                     for the festival, a diamond ever flashed. Most beautiful she was; and, alas!
                     motherless. Her father, the cold, calculating statesman, saw, in her rare
                     beauty, the means of binding to his party, at some future day, a partisan,
                     unscrupulous as himself. The time delayed, a little, its coming, and Eunice was
                     too busy dancing in the sunshine, to dream of night. Yet it overtook her, and
                     her heart meekly disrobed itself of its shining garments.</p>
                  <p>For she had loved, as so it may come to man or woman but once in a lifetime;
                     too well, for society had a law, as her father, who was a lawyer, interpreted
                     it, that forbade the classes to swerve from the conventional line. Her blood
                     was noble in a republican land, and his <emph>was</emph> noble, too, flowing
                     from so noble a heart. <emph>This</emph> was his sin—his ancestors had toiled.
                     Hers was the aristocracy of blood; his, the aristocracy of labor and of
                     intellect. In the windows of her father's hall, ancient but well preserved, her
                     grandmother's titled name was carved with a diamond. From his, there was the
                     picture of the green fields, waving with corn, the orchard, and the silver
                     waved spring. I have said <emph>she</emph> was most fair; and on
                        <emph>his</emph> brow the Divine Hand had made its mark; the soul registered
                        <emph>there</emph> its origin.</p>
                  <p>Of this love I may not speak much; it was so holy, so tender, so true, so
                     fearfully strong.</p>
                  <p>The statesman who had forgotten his own youth, said, "No. Let them part. She
                     can do better for herself and me. This man has neither wealth nor position. It
                     is true, he has fame. But what is worth the poet's fame?"</p>
                  <p>The statesman's sister had once shut Love out from her heart, so rudely, that
                     he never again offered to enter, and that heart had withered and grown
                     dark."Let them part," she said. "Love is a foolish dream, from which she must
                     be awakened; the sooner the better." So they two called her back to life with
                     bitter words. And oh! the awakening!</p>
                  <p>I heard of her, as with bowed head and unsteady feet, she toiled up the
                     grass-covered streets of the old town, towards the convent hill. Arrived at the
                     gate she paused to rest a moment, then drew the bell. Soon she was admitted to
                     the presence of the priest. Surprised, he looked at her; it had been long since
                     one so fair had crossed that threshold. Did he not divine there was a heart
                     history in the<pb n="384-385" xml:id="VAC6361-00000193"/> pale lips and paler
                     cheeks? But he waited for her to speak.</p>
                  <p>He saw her faint and trembling. Then he asked, "What is it, my daughter? It is
                     our office to console the afflicted, as to guide the erring. I know you, and
                     what trouble can have found you out? Have you been dwelling on the mysteries of
                     our holy religion? Would you come to the bosom of the mother church? she stands
                     ever with open arms to receive her returning children."</p>
                  <p>"Father," she said, "I am in search of peace. I thought it might be here within
                     these sacred walls. A deep darkness has fallen upon me, and I am groping my
                     way, without a guide. There is a burden here"—and she pressed over her heart a
                     hand like snow—"that I would lay down. Must I go smiling through the world and
                     bear it? Oh! I cannot, I am so weary of the world—weary of my life. Tell me
                     truly, shall I find repose? These women, who are shut up here forever, did they
                     enter sorrowing, and have they found rest?"</p>
                  <p>"What is your grief?" the father kindly asked. "Have you some sin that you
                     should confess to me? Do not fear, the church is merciful."</p>
                  <p>"I have not sinned," she said calmly. "I have loved, but they tell me I must
                     forget. There is a band that is pressing tightly here," and again she laid over
                     her heart her jewelled fingers. "It would be a mockery, a dreadful falsehood
                     for me to stay among the happy and laugh with them. Let me come to you and find
                     rest. As well might I pass the dragging hours in prayer as in endless
                     weeping."</p>
                  <p>"My daughter," said the priest, "most gladly would we receive you among these
                     holy women, who, abjuring the false pleasures of the world, have given
                     themselves to God. But your father is a Protestant, and he would not consent to
                     our receiving you. You have not the right to decide for yourself, for you
                     cannot be of age. Have you spoken to your father about your wish? Here, in this
                     land, we dare not use the power with which the church arms us."</p>
                  <p>"Go to him," said Eunice, "and entreat him for me, that I may be quiet for
                     awhile. I would know of a great many things, but first, of the 'Man of sorrows
                     and acquainted with grief.' Was it not Jesus? and will you tell me of him?"</p>
                  <p>The father looked at her intently, and he thought, "a wounded spirit who can
                     bear?" Most gently he questioned her, and drew from her the short history of
                     her love. He could but pity her, and, well acquainted with the workings of the
                     heart, he saw the map of her fate drawn out. "Disappointed love!" he said to
                     himself! "it was <emph>that</emph> that first led woman to a convent. Woman's
                     nature is still the same."</p>
                  <p>But did he tell this poor child of fashion more of<pb n="386-387"
                        xml:id="VAC6361-00000194"/> the Jesus whom she desired to see? She was so
                     near the fold, would he not show her the entrance?</p>
                  <p>Awhile the father considered, then he bade the suppliant return to her house,
                     where he would follow her. He gave her a cross and a rosary, and taught her a
                     prayer to one who was a woman; blessed indeed among women, but frail and
                     sorrowing, once, like herself.</p>
                  <p>And how ended the conference between the priest and the parent? The priest
                     deprecated offending the great man, but he told him how his daughter had come
                     to the convent gate, and had asked admittance. He said she was ill and
                     melancholy, and it would be good for her to come to them, for a time. The
                     regular life, the varied occupation, the change of scene, might restore her to
                     happiness and health. She would be the charge of the lady Abbess. She would
                     embroider, and play on the harp, with the young nuns. She might ride at her
                     pleasure, or tend the rare flowers that grew in the convent gardens. Many a
                     winning smile, and much courtly grace accompanied the soft entreaties, that
                     closed with a hope of restoring the daughter, cured of her illness, whatever it
                     might be.</p>
                  <p>"Eunice," said her father, "has a strange fancy for a young man, who, by his
                     genius, we all know. But he is a mere poet, without fortune. Writing verses
                     will not be likely to help him along in this world.</p>
                  <p>The young man is my daughter's inferior, too, in point of family. There is
                     everything sir, in good blood. Do you not agree with me?"</p>
                  <p>The Jesuit bowed and smiled, and thus advanced a point.</p>
                  <p>"Sir," continued the statesman, "I have refused my consent. My child, by her
                     beauty and talents and family influence, is entitled to a more splendid
                     alliance. I have parted them, and I wish her to forget this young man; I have
                     told her so, and in my family, my word is law. Yet I would see her happy, and I
                     cannot deny that she droops; often I find her in tears. Her physician advises a
                     total change of scene. As she wishes, for a time, to stay in your convent, I
                     will not object. Will she be well cared for there? for I fear she is delicate.
                     Of late she has had a cough. Yet, pardon me, I do not want her to become a
                     Romanist."</p>
                  <p>The Jesuit bowed again. But could he promise this? Place your rose-tree in the
                     rain. Will not its leaves drink up the drops?</p>
                  <p>So the prayers of the drooping Eunice to her father were heard. He consented
                     that his "star-gemmed lily" should go for awhile, for a few months at most, to
                     the quiet that she coveted.</p>
                  <p>And now Eunice is shut out from the world. She may weep unmolested. She may
                     withdraw to dream over the past. She may, musing, walk through the<pb
                        n="388-389" xml:id="VAC6361-00000195"/> convent halls. She spends hours
                     alone, in her little room. None contradict her; she does according to her will.
                     Sometimes she asks the nuns of the Man of sorrows. They answer her with stories
                     of Mary, who nursed him; legends of Joseph and of the saints. They teach her
                     their vesper songs, and, singing them, she tries to forget. Yet withal, she
                     clings to the past. It is her treasure. Her heart learns no repose. She
                     questions the result of her experiment. These women, robed in garments of
                     sanctity, why should they utter silly jests and gossip, as do the women of the
                     world without? She finds penances and prayers weary her, as did the trivial
                     demands of fashion.</p>
                  <p>She watched with interest, the nuns who came often to her room to read to her,
                     or to talk. What had led so many to renounce life? to be buried as effectually
                     here; as if they were bricked and plastered up in those cruel niches, the
                     graves of the faithless nuns of old. There was one she longed to question—one
                     with a face of unearthly paleness, with a passionless eye, but with features of
                     such regular beauty. One, who was quiet and graceful, yet on whose lovely face
                     was written despair. One, upon whom there ever rested a stern haughtiness of
                     manner, when the curious eye bent towards her, though she was very gentle in
                     her ways for one so proud; and all loved her.</p>
                  <p>Once, she came into the room where Eunice lay, suffering from pain and
                     restlessness. "I have brought you some soup, Eunice; try and eat it; it will
                     give you a little strength." Eunice smiled, pleased with the notice taken of
                     her, but, though she raised the spoon to her lips, she could not eat.
                     Gratefully she declined it, and then the nun set it aside, and came back, to
                     place herself by Eunice, on the cot.</p>
                  <p>"You are very feeble, my poor child," she said gently. "Each day I see that you
                     are failing. It is better so; I know all that brought you here, and therefore,
                     I say, it is better so. Better to burst asunder the chain, and let its links
                     fall to the ground than to bear it, dragging so heavily after you, through many
                     years."</p>
                  <p>"I came here," said Eunice, "to find peace. Have you found it? for I am sure no
                     happy woman would, by immuring herself within these walls, debar herself from
                     all that makes life valuable."</p>
                  <p>"Peace," said the nun, bitterly. "Think you there is a heart here without its
                     struggle? Here is <emph>our</emph> world, and here are its bitterness and
                     cares. There are silly women here, without whom society is better off, but such
                     as you and I had died ere we came. Yet take comfort; the grave will soon give
                     you repose. My strong nature rebelled, and braved out the storm, and lives,
                     torn and withered by the<pb n="390-391" xml:id="VAC6361-00000196"/> lightning
                     stroke. Yours, frail and delicate, bent with the first token of the blast."</p>
                  <p>Oh, how Eunice longed to speak! to ask her wherefore she had come, to crave her
                     sympathy. But the nun had resumed her reserved manner, and soon left her.</p>
                  <p>The statesman came often to his daughter, and grieved to see her pining. He
                     brought physicians to see her now flushed cheeks, and to listen to her racking
                     cough. He said she had better go home, for she had not recovered, as he hoped.
                     But Eunice entreated, "Let me stay a little longer; the roses are still
                     blooming in the convent garden, and the quiet is very sweet to me." She sighed
                     as she said this, for she felt that her coming had been a failure. But she
                     chose to linger, and her father consented that she should remain yet a little
                     while.</p>
                  <p>And a change came to Eunice. It was not happiness, or even repose, but a
                     resignation to what was irremediable. She was placid outwardly, though the
                     battle was not done within. Yet <emph>she could not help it</emph>. Ah, it is
                     this that acts upon our nature! If we had the power, would we not often
                     contend? Would we not sometimes arm ourselves against God, but for the
                     consciousness of our own weakness? This brings submission. First, we feel the
                     weakness of the mortal; then we recognize the power of the Infinite. Yet this
                     is not enough.</p>
                  <p>Another change came to her. She did not hear much of the Man of sorrows, but
                     she soon became familiar with the history of the saints. One of the older nuns,
                     a good and kind woman, though ignorant and weak-minded, came to her often in
                     the evening, and told her of the sufferings of the martyrs. From the
                     description of their last agonies, she would pass to the refining fires of
                     purgatory, thence to the glories of Heaven. Woman, naturally devotional,
                     clings, in the hour of her trouble, to thoughts of heaven, and human nature is
                     ever ready to extol what it has suffered and done. Thus, Eunice easily
                     consented to the doctrine that her penances and prayers, and, above all, her
                     tears and sufferings, would gain her heaven. She felt that she had done with
                     life, and present objects and associations had a strong effect upon her mind.
                     Right reverently she kneeled when she passed before the image of Christ; longer
                     she lingered by the statue of Mary. Religious thoughts, in some measure,
                     supplanted the earthly love. There was a superstitious influence constantly at
                     work within her. Had she cast her soul upon Christ, she would have found
                     repose, but she was ever appealing to those who were helpless to save. By day,
                     she read the histories of the saints, and many hours of the night she passed in
                     wearying prayers. She grew reconciled to suffer, as sorrow was the lot of
                     all.</p>
                  <pb n="392-393" xml:id="VAC6361-00000197"/>
                  <p>The constant stimulus of mental excitement hurried on her disease. The cough
                     grew harder, and the flush deepened in her cheek. Very feeble she was, as each
                     morning she raised her head from her pillow. She knew what all this meant.
                     Death was at hand. And like a dream was the retrospection of her short life. A
                     little while ago, she was strong and well, and the sun was not bright enough
                     for her. And now? So she folded her hands, and gave herself up to death. And
                     she thought, poor child! heaven was to be won by beads, and prayers, and
                     penances, and fasts.</p>
                  <p>Again her father came, and now she <emph>must go home</emph>. He blamed himself
                     that he had ever permitted her to immure herself in so gloomy a place. She
                     would surely be better among her old friends, enjoying the gayeties to which
                     she had been accustomed.</p>
                  <p>But Eunice shuddered at the thought. Accustomed to retirement, to isolation,
                     she shrunk from a change, in her exhausted state. She nerved herself, for the
                     first time in her life, to contend. She <emph>would not</emph> leave the asylum
                     that had been her refuge. For the few weeks or days that remained, let her be
                     quiet. She laid her thin hands on her father's, and besought him to let her die
                     here.</p>
                  <p>The statesman bowed his head and wept. Could anything belonging to him die? He
                     roused, and asked the physicians to give him hope. They turned from him without
                     a reply. Then he remembered what would once have made Eunice bound from that
                     couch with a joy above all other earthly joys. So he stooped, and whispered in
                     her ear, "I will write to him, my darling, and tell him to hasten back. Look
                     up; you shall be his. Once I parted you, but there shall be no more
                     separation."</p>
                  <p>A lovely smile passed over the features of the dying girl. You <emph>shall be
                        his</emph>. Oh! most precious were those words. It was the last earthly
                     dream, and false as all the others. Ah! Earth! Earth! how we cling to the mould
                     of which we are made, and Love!—with what a giant's strength thou holdest us to
                     the last.</p>
                  <p>The smile is passing away, and mournful eyes are raised to the father's face.
                     The star is falling from the forehead. An expression of pain is over the
                     countenance, and blood oozes from the pale lips.</p>
                  <p>Once more, in his frantic despair, the statesman speaks to his child. "Eunice,
                     my precious one, I was harsh and unyielding, but come home, and all will be
                     well. You shall be his. Oh! fool that I was to see you pine away before my
                     eyes. Let me clasp you in my arms and take you home."</p>
                  <p>Unseen arms supported her, and a voice, not of this world, called her home. The
                     priest raised before her fading eyes the glittering cross. She saw<pb
                        n="394-395" xml:id="VAC6361-00000198"/> it; but looking up, breathed away
                     her fluttering soul.</p>
                  <p>Has she found the Man of sorrows? Oh! I hope it. In that last upward look, He
                     may have revealed himself to her, He is so merciful. Let us trust her tears are
                     wiped away by the hand once nailed to the cross.</p>
                  <p>She has gone home.</p>
                  <milestone n="*   *   *   *   *" unit="typography"/>
                  <p>There are others, there are many living who cannot look back to a joyous youth.
                     Some bore the yoke of sorrow; some struggled through poverty and contention.
                     Some yielded to temptation, and turned away from God. Let us all breathe the
                     prayer, "Oh! remember not the sins of my youth."</p>
                  <p>But I rejoice in the thought of the early and happy years—that calm, pleasant
                     period of my life. It is gone, but I dash aside my tears. I am content with the
                     years that follow on; with the present that God accords me; for I know that
                     whatever may be in store for me, as I tread over the long grass of summer,
                     seeing in the vista the autumn leaves, I know the spring-time of my life may
                     never come again.</p>
