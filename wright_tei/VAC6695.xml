               <p>"WILL you go to the plantation with me to-morrow, Eulalia?" asked Moreland of his
                  wife, a few days after the departure of Ildegerte.</p>
               <p>"Oh, yes!" she answered with eagerness; "there is nothing I desire so much."</p>
               <p>"As the season has advanced with uncommon rapidity," said he, "they have already
                  commenced the picking of cotton, which will be something of a novelty to you. The
                  fields are whitening for the harvest, and the labourers are gathering it in. But
                  oh! my sweet Northern wife!" he added with a smile, "what a trial it will be of
                  your love, to see your husband in the full exercise of his despotic power! You
                  have only seen me in the household, and have thought me, perhaps, tolerably
                  gentle. But what will you say when you see me driving<pb n="4-5"
                     xml:id="VAC6695-00000003"/> the poor creatures through the cotton rows with a
                  knotted lash, and making the white bolls red with their dripping blood? Can you
                  love me still, and plead the force of custom in my behalf?"</p>
               <p>"You speak mockingly. I fear no such test of the strength of my affection. You
                  allude to what I once believed, to what so many of my Northern friends still
                  believe; and I cannot wonder so much at the scornful smile that curls your lip. I
                  know you too well now to credit such enormities. How I wish father were here, even
                  for a little while! Cannot we induce him to come?"</p>
               <p>"I hope so. I hope to see all your family, my Eulalia, gathered round your
                  Southern home. Reuben is to be a lawyer. The professions are all crowded at the
                  North; here he will have a wider scope and more abundant materials to work upon.
                  Plenty of litigation here. I promised Dora to build her a bower of roses, and
                  people it with canaries and mocking birds, expressly for her accommodation. Mark
                  my prophecy, Eulalia. You will have all your family here, true-hearted
                  Southerners, by and by."</p>
               <p>"And Betsy with them?" said Eulalia, smiling.</p>
               <p>"Oh, yes! I plighted my vows to Betsy, before our marriage, and I must not falsify
                  them. She is an honest, industrious creature, worth a dozen of our pampered
                  negroes. You must have perceived, even now, how much heavier the burthen of
                  servitude is at the North than here, where the labour is divided among so
                  many."</p>
               <p>"Yes! in the town; but I suppose on the plantations they must work very hard
                  indeed, even when they have humane masters and overseers."</p>
               <p>"You shall judge for yourself. They have their appointed tasks, and then, if they
                  choose, they labour for themselves. There is one trait in the negro character of
                  which you may not be conscious. You cannot make them work habitually beyond their
                  strength. You can get a certain amount of labour out of them, and beyond that they
                  will not go. Masters and overseers, having learned this fact from experience,
                  seldom attempt to push them over this boundary. If they do, they meet with an
                  obstinate resistance which coercion never can overcome. This peculiarity is one of
                  the negro's greatest safeguards from the requirements of selfish power. The
                  self-interest of his employer is enlisted on his side and we all know what a
                  powerful principle it is. A certain amount of labour is a blessing to every human
                  being. That God willed it to be so, is proved by the withering curse of ennui,
                  resting on the idler. You think, perhaps, it must be a curse to work under the
                  burning sun of our sultry clime. It would be for me; it would be for the white
                  man; but the negro, native of a tropic zone, and constitutionally adapted to its
                  heat, luxuriates in the beams which would parch us with fever. I have studied him
                  physiologically as well as<pb n="6-7" xml:id="VAC6695-00000004"/> mentally and
                  morally, and I find some remarkable characteristics, perhaps unknown to you. In
                  the first place, his skull has a hardness and thickness far greater than our own,
                  which defy the arrowy sunbeams of the South. Then his skin, upon minute
                  examination, is very different from ours, in other respects as well as colour. It
                  secretes a far greater quantity of moisture, which, like dew, throws back the heat
                  absorbed by us. I could mention many more peculiarities which prove his
                  adaptedness to the situation he occupies, but I fear I weary you, Eulalia."</p>
               <p>"Oh, no! I have heard the subject discussed since my earliest recollection, yet I
                  acknowledge my profound ignorance. Every circumstance you mention is new to
                  me."</p>
               <p>"No man living," added Moreland, with a countenance of deep and earnest thought,
                  "regards the negro with more kindness and sympathy than myself. I would sooner
                  give my right hand to the flames than make it the instrument of cruelty and
                  oppression to them. They are entwined with my affections as well as my interests.
                  I was born and brought up in their midst, and they are as much incorporated with
                  my being as the trees which have shaded my infancy and childhood, and the streams
                  on whose banks I have been accustomed to wander. I never dreamed, when a boy, that
                  it was possible to separate my existence from theirs, any more than I could flee
                  from the shadows of night. How little do the people ple of the North reflect upon
                  all this! How little do they understand the almost indissoluble ties that bind us
                  to each other! And yet," he cried, excited to greater warmth as he proceeded,
                  "strong as are these ties, and dear as are these interests, I can never look upon
                  the negro as my equal in the scale of being. He has a heart as kind and
                  affectionate as my own, a soul as immortal, and so far I claim him as my brother;
                  but he is not my equal physically or mentally, and I do not degrade him or exalt
                  myself by this admission. When Africa, as a nation, stands side by side with the
                  other nations of the world in the arts and sciences, in literature and genius, by
                  its own inherent energies and powers, then I will subscribe to this equality, but
                  not till then. God has not made all men equal, though men wiser than God would
                  have it so. Inequality is one of Nature's laws. The mountains and the valleys
                  proclaim it. It is written on the firmament of heaven. It is felt in the social
                  system, and always will be felt, in spite of the dreams of the enthusiast or the
                  efforts of the reformer."</p>
               <p>Moreland paused. The shadow of a great thought rested on his brow. Eulalia looked
                  anxiously towards him. He smiled.</p>
               <p>"You must not mind me when I fall into revery. It is my habit. But come, my
                  Eulalia,"—there was inexpressible grace and tenderness in the manner in which he
                  thus expressed his ownership—never had her name<pb n="8-9"
                     xml:id="VAC6695-00000005"/> sounded so sweet, never had the possessive pronoun
                  seemed so significant or appropriate—"sing me one of your own charming songs. I
                  have heard a great deal of music, but never anything that thrilled my heart like
                  the voice of the village chorister."</p>
               <p>Eulalia looked at the superb piano that stood near, silent beneath its crimson
                  cover, at the guitar swathed in green, leaning against the wall, instruments which
                  the fingers of Claudia had once swept, and a blush rose to her cheeks. Moreland
                  interpreted the glance and blush.</p>
               <p>"Will my wife become a pupil, for my sake?" asked he, drawing her towards him.
                  "Will she learn the use of those now silent keys and loosened chords?"</p>
               <p>"Gladly, most gladly," she answered, "I have always sighed for such advantages,
                  but I never expressed the wish. I knew my father toiled to supply us with the
                  comforts of life. How could I be selfish enough to beg for its luxuries?"</p>
               <p>"Well, as soon as we return from the plantation we will arrange our plans. You
                  shall have the best of music masters, and I know you will make a marvellous pupil.
                  But after all there is no instrument comparable to the God-tuned human voice!"</p>
               <p>As soon as Eulalia began to sing, the little Effie came flying in, and nestling in
                  her arms, listened, as if an angel were singing. She sat with her head thrown
                  slightly back, her red lips parted, and her wildly brilliant eyes suffused with a
                  glistening moisture.</p>
               <p>"More!" she cried, when Eulalia paused. "Effie good girl, when mamma sing."</p>
               <p>"<emph>She</emph> will make a musician," said Eulalia, turning to her husband,
                  while she fondly caressed the child. "I never saw so young a child exhibit such a
                  passionate love of music. Several times, when she has stubbornly resisted my
                  authority, I have subdued her into the gentlest obedience, by singing a few simple
                  strains."</p>
               <p>"I do not wonder at it," said Moreland, gazing with passionate tenderness on the
                  lovely young stepmother, cradling in her arms the brilliant little sprite, whom
                  she was teaching him to love. "I am sure if I were in the wildest paroxysm of
                  anger, your voice would soothe me into peace."</p>
               <p>"But you never have such paroxysms," said she, with a smile; "so I shall have no
                  opportunity of proving my power on you."</p>
               <p>"You do not know me, my Eulalia. My bosom is the couchant lion's lair."</p>
               <p>"I have never seen you angry, I think the lion must be very tame. I do not fear
                  it."</p>
               <p>"You need not," said he, looking fixedly upon her sweet, confiding, angelic
                  countenance; "you could bind it with a silken thread. I remember, when a boy,
                  reading about a holy virgin going on a pilgrimage through the wilderness, and the
                  wild beasts hushed their<pb n="10-11" xml:id="VAC6695-00000006"/> howlings, and
                  crouched submissively at her feet. The serpent that came hissing from the crevices
                  of the rocks, curled in loving folds <choice>
                     <sic>innnoxious</sic>
                     <corr>innoxious</corr>
                  </choice> in her path; and the birds flew down and nestled in her bosom. You have
                  taught me the meaning of that allegory, my gentle wife."</p>
               <p>He stooped down, kissed her, and left the room. He seemed moved, agitated. There
                  was a world of sensibility in the darkening lustre of his eyes. She knew he had
                  been thinking of Claudia, whose name had never been breathed between them since
                  she had taken her place as the mistress of his home. A thousand times had it
                  hovered on her lips, yet she had never dared to utter it; and the past seemed a
                  sealed book to him. The servants had evidently been instructed not to talk of
                  their former mistress; and Eulalia had too much delicacy to question them on a
                  forbidden theme. Sometimes Kizzie would say, looking at Effie,</p>
               <p>"Just see, ain't she the living military of her mother?—them black eyes, and that
                  red, saucy mouth of hers. Bless your soul, Kizzie!" clapping her hand over her own
                  broad lips, "what that you talking 'bout? What your Mars. Russell tell you? Poor
                  master! he had a heap of trouble!—all over now, tho', bless a Lord!"</p>
               <p>Eulalia well knew that Kizzie longed to relate all that she knew; and, had she
                  questioned her, she would have considered herself bound to obey her mistress, even
                  in opposition to her master's commands, for had he not told her himself, to obey
                  her in all things? But Eulalia's respect for her husband equalled her love, and
                  she considered his domestic misfortunes too sacred for curiosity. Yet the image of
                  Claudia was for ever flitting before her. She would have given anything for one
                  glimpse of the face, the haunting face, her imagination had drawn. It was not
                  jealousy she felt, for she was sure of her husband's undivided love; but he had
                  loved and wedded another, and death had not broken the nuptial bond.
                     <emph>She</emph> lived!—where, how near, she knew not. She had a conviction
                  that they must one day meet, and a thrill of indescribable emotion penetrated her,
                  at the thought. She knew that, whatever were the circumstances of the separation,
                  Moreland was not the offending party; but she also knew, by the dark expression
                  that sometimes swept over his countenance, how much and deeply he must have
                  suffered.</p>
               <p>"Oh, never, never may he suffer through me!" was her soul's most fervent prayer;
                  "let sorrow, danger, death come, if God will, but let our hearts still be one.
                  Welcome any thing, everything but estrangement from him!"</p>
               <p>The next morning, at an early hour, they commenced their journey to the
                  plantation. It was a two days' ride, and Kizzie made sumptuous preparations for
                  their comfort. She packed up the greatest quantity of cake, biscuits, cold ham,
                  and tongue, for their wayside luncheons<pb n="12-13" xml:id="VAC6695-00000007"/>
                  cheons, not forgetting the generous cordial and the sparkling wine.</p>
               <p>"You must think, Kizzie, that your mistress and myself are blest with fine
                  appetites," said Moreland, laughing.</p>
               <p>"Ain't I going too Mars. Russell, and ain't Miss Effie to be provided for?
                  Besides, one likes to give a bit to the driver, you know, master."</p>
               <p>"Is it your wish to take the child?" asked he, in some surprise, turning to
                  Eulalia.</p>
               <p>"Certainly—that is, if you have no objection."</p>
               <p>"Oh, no! but will she not trouble you?"</p>
               <p>"Even if she did, I would not like to leave her behind."</p>
               <p>"Then I will go on horseback, as your escort. Kizzie will occupy a very
                  comfortable space in the carriage, and Effie frisks about like a little monkey,
                  wherever she is."</p>
               <p>"Let us leave her by all means, then," said Eulalia. "I did not think of its
                  depriving you of a seat. How inconsiderate I am!'</p>
               <p>"Effie, my darling," added she, taking her up in her arms, "I am sorry we cannot
                  take you; but Aunt Kizzie will be very good to you while we are gone. And
                     <emph>you</emph> will be very good, will you not?"</p>
               <p>"No! I won't be good! I'll go too!" cried the child, struggling and kicking like
                  an angry kitten. "I won't stay! Kizzie sha'n't stay!"</p>
               <p>The little creature's eyes actually blazed on her stepmother.</p>
               <p>"Take her away, Kizzie," said her father; "she is a perfect little tigress. It is
                  no wonder," muttered he, in a low voice, and with a reddening face.</p>
               <p>"Wait a moment," said Eulalia, entreatingly; "you know you said I could tame the
                  beasts of the field."</p>
               <p>Then whispering in Effie's ear a few words which seemed to have the effect of
                  magic, while she bent upon her soft, serene, dark eyes; the child remained
                  perfectly still a moment, while the angry crimson faded from its cheek, then,
                  looking up with the gentleness of a lamb, lisped—</p>
               <p>"I had rather not, mamma!"</p>
               <p>"Well! you are certainly a female Van Amburg," said Moreland, wondering at the
                  sudden transformation from passion to gentleness; "let her go, Eulalia. Keep her
                  with you, by all means. I really prefer going on horseback; I do not feel half a
                  man pent up in a carriage. Nothing but your company could reconcile me to it, and
                  that I can enjoy through the open windows.</p>
               <p>Effie, wild with delight, was perched upon the seat before the others were half
                  ready, swinging her little gipsy straw hat by one string, till it looked like a
                  twisted cord. It took a long time for Aunt Kizzie to deposit her "goodies," as she
                  called them, to her own satisfaction, in the carriage-pockets and by-places; and
                  it took her a long time to go up and down the steps of the<pb n="14-15"
                     xml:id="VAC6695-00000008"/> carriage, as she had a good deal to carry besides
                  her bundles and bottles. Albert, who stood near, holding his master's high-mettled
                  and prancing steed, laughed at the audible grunt, by which she relieved her
                  fatigue, every time she stooped. He laughed, too, to see little Effie punch her
                  with her feet, as she tucked away the packages; but he laughed still more, when
                  Kizzie sailed majestically by him, pretending to be angry and consequential, her
                  face beaming with good-nature the whole time.</p>
               <p>When Eulalia was about to take her place at Effie's side, she was astonished at
                  seeing two nice pillows on the seat</p>
               <p>"Why are these here?" she asked. "I am no invalid, Aunt Kizzie, to require
                  propping. Please take them out."</p>
               <p>"Wait a little, missus, while I tells you the raal reason. When we stops at night,
                  you won't find a pillow-slip fit to scrape your feet on, let alone your
                  honey-sweet face There ain't no quality folks at the stopping-places, and the
                  piny-woods people have mighty curous ways" of doing things, I tell you,
                  missus."</p>
               <p>"You had better let Kizzie arrange everything; you can rely on her judgment and
                  experience," said More-land, mounting the beautiful horse, whose caracoling and
                  prancing made Eulalia tremble for the fearless rider. "You are not familiar with
                  the phases of backwoods life, Eulalia. They will at least have the freshness of
                  novelty."</p>
               <p>While the inspiring breeze of morn was blowing, and the dew yet glittered on the
                  grass of the wayside, their ride was delightful and exhilarating. The bright-green
                  tassels of the silver pine showered odours as they waved above them; the sturdy
                  blackjack, the graceful willow oak, the shining-leaved magnolia, alternately
                  shaded them from the sunshine, and thrust, here and there, a projecting bough into
                  the carriage window as they passed. Eulalia's spirits were so elastic, she could
                  have bounded, like Effie, to catch the festoons of hoary moss that hung in gray
                  loops from the branches; and when the noonday-heat made the sandy road burn under
                  the horses' fetlocks, and flecks of foam whiten the rich, mahogany-coloured skin,
                  and they all stopped near a beautiful spring, that gushed right out of a rock, and
                  sat down on the mossy ground, while Kizzie fumbled after the <emph>goodies,</emph>
                  and spread them out on a broad, flat stone, close to the spring, and put the
                  bottles in the bubbling water to cool, Eulalia's rapture burst, forth in joyous
                  ejaculations. Moreland was charmed with her childlike enthusiasm, and dipping the
                  silver cup, which the aristocratic Kizzie had not failed to bring, in the heart of
                  the fountain, he drank sportively to the health of his Northern bride.</p>
               <p>"Stay a moment," he said, tossing the silver cup on the grass. "I must teach you
                  how to drink from a greenwood goblet."</p>
               <p>Then gathering some large, fresh, glabrous oak leaves,<pb n="16-17"
                     xml:id="VAC6695-00000009"/> he wove them together in a mysterious manner, so as
                  to form a rural cup. Eulalia declared she had never tasted a draught so delicious
                  or food so refreshing; while Kizzie looked on with a comfortable, motherly,
                  liberal expression of countenance, as if she had not only provided the feast, but
                  the spring, the greenwood, and the covering heavens themselves, for their
                  accommodation. An air of serene repose was diffused over every object, and every
                  sound breathed of tranquillity. The water murmured and gurgled as sweetly and
                  softly as if it feared to disturb the shadows that played upon its bosom. The
                  trees dipped lightly their long, swaying branches in the fountain, and the low,
                  musical buzz of insect life gave one the idea of an all-pervading, void-filling,
                  infinite existence. The horses stood quietly feeding in the shade, wrinkling their
                  glossy sides and flapping their tails, as the flies lit upon their moist hides;
                  the driver reclined lazily near them, trailing his whip in the water with an
                  occasional glance at the sun to see how late it was getting; and, fast asleep on
                  the shady grass, with her little gipsy hat lying by her side, her cheek flushed
                  with heat and moist with perspiration, Effie presented the anomalous picture of a
                  noonday fairy. Moreland and Eulalia sat side by side, feeling that exquisite sense
                  of heart-communion which silence only can express. They sat so still, so near,
                  they could hear the beating of each other's hearts, and there was no need of any
                  other language. Eulalia remembered the hour when she thus sat on the deck of the
                  steamboat, in the hush of the moonlight, wishing she could glide on for ever over
                  the shining river. Even so she wished she could sit for ever, indulging in that
                  quiet dream of happiness in the midst of the languishing brightness of noon; but
                  the journey was before them, and after a little bustle and considerable <emph>Aunt
                     Kizzieism,</emph> they again started. After travelling a few miles they began
                  to ascend a long, sandy, winding hill, and so slow was their progress, the wheels
                  sometimes appeared to stand still. Moreland rode close to the carriage, keeping up
                  a gay conversation with Eulalia, in which Aunt Kizzie occasionally joined with the
                  freedom of a privileged member of the family, when they caught a glimpse of a
                  carriage slowly descending, and Moreland turned his horse into a side path, to
                  give the two carriages room to pass each other. Eulalia looked out with the
                  interest one feels in meeting strangers on a solitary road, where the sight of a
                  log-cabin is an event worth remembering, and even a grave-stone has a social
                  aspect.</p>
               <p>A lady sat lolling indolently on the back seat, with her arms folded in a drapery
                  of black lace. She was young and handsome; but what chiefly distinguished her was
                  a pair of large, brilliant black eyes, that glanced carelessly and haughtily
                  towards the travellers she was about to meet. The moment Eulalia met that cold,
                  bright, haughty glance, she started as if it had pierced her bosom, and leaned
                  against the window side,<pb n="18-19" xml:id="VAC6695-00000010"/> keeping her own
                  eyes fixed upon the stranger with an intense, magnetic gaze. She saw the
                  brilliant, haughty orbs turn from her to Moreland and suddenly flash up like
                  burning gas, while every feature expressed scorn, hatred and revenge. Never had
                  she seen such an expression on woman's face, and her own turned pale as marble as
                  she gazed. She looked at her husband; he was lividly pale, and his lips had the
                  rigidness of stone. Again the scorching glance flashed back into the carriage and
                  riveted itself on Eulalia with withering scrutiny. Effie, with the eager curiosity
                  of childhood, stood up on tiptoe, and, leaning over Eulalia's lap, exclaimed in a
                  clear, ringing, decided tone, peculiar to herself,</p>
               <p>"Let <emph>me</emph> see, mamma."</p>
               <p>At sight of the child, at the sound of its voice, an instantaneous change passed
                  over the lady's countenance. The proud, scornful, defying lip quivered with sudden
                  emotion; tenderness, anguish, and remorse swept in clouds over her haughty
                  features. The arms so disdainfully, yet gracefully folded, opened as if to clasp
                  her to her breast,—but, with one more revolution of the wheels, it all fled like a
                  vision. Where the dark, bright, avenging angel or demon, whichever it was,
                  appeared, there was empty space, with the white glare of the sand below.</p>
               <p>When they reached the summit of the hill, the driver stopped the panting horses to
                  give them breath, and Moreland approached the carriage; the shadow of the
                  thunder-cloud yet lingered on his brow.</p>
               <p>"Eulalia," he exclaimed, startled by her deadly paleness, "Are you ill? Are you
                  faint?"</p>
               <p>She shook her head, but so great was her agitation her lips faded to a pale ashy
                  hue.</p>
               <p>"Give her some wine, Kizzie! She <emph>is</emph> faint! She <emph>will</emph>
                  faint! There is no water to be had!"</p>
               <p>Kizzie fumbled in the pocket for the silver cup, declaring in her trepidation,
                  that she believed "her fingers was all thumbs." Moreland, with a gesture of
                  impatience, threw his bridle reins to the driver, and, jumping into the carriage,
                  placed Effie in Kizzie's lap, seated himself by Eulalia and put his arm around
                  her.</p>
               <p>"It is all over now," she said, the cold, benumbing sensation passing away. "I am
                  sorry to have troubled you so."</p>
               <p>"Troubled!" he repeated. "Don't talk in that way, my Eulalia, when you know I
                  would lay down toy life at any moment to save you from suffering."</p>
               <p>Yes! she knew he would—she had not one doubt of his exclusive devotion to
                  herself,—then why the sickening anguish she had just endured? Was it jealousy of
                  the past or dread of the future? or were the mingling shades of both rolling
                  darkly over her soul? She had been so happy a few moments before. Why had this
                  woman come in her dark, splendid, terrible beauty, between her and her happiness?
                  Yet, had she not yearned to behold her with strong, irrepressible desire? Yes! but
                  now that desire was fulfilled, she would give any<pb n="20-21"
                     xml:id="VAC6695-00000011"/> thing to shut out the image of that flashing,
                  passionate, haunting countenance. Ashamed of her want of self-possession, she
                  raised her eyes and met those of her husband fixed so earnestly and sadly upon
                  her, that every other feeling was swallowed up in sympathy for him. What untold
                  agony <emph>he</emph> must have suffered, and yet he cared only for her, foolish,
                  childish, selfish as he must think her! Sure it was <emph>her</emph> place to
                  soothe and comfort him, and beguile him of the remembrance of his wrongs.</p>
               <p>"I am better," said she, with a smile; "nay, I am quite well. You must not feel
                  anxious if I do look pale now and then. You shall find that I am a heroine, for
                  all that."</p>
               <p>"I believe you," he replied, his grave, sad countenance lighting up in her smile.
                  "Kizzie, supposing you take my seat on horseback and let me lounge in the carriage
                  a while?"</p>
               <p>"Oh, master, wouldn't I look funny on that are fine beast? Wouldn't young missus
                  laugh till she done dead?"</p>
               <p>"A merry laugh would do her no hurt;—but you ride like an Amazon, Kizzie. Come, I
                  am not afraid to trust you!"</p>
               <p>Eulalia thought him in jest, but Kizzie knew that he was in earnest, and prepared
                  to obey with great good nature. She had no objection to stretch her limbs and
                  carry on a social chat with the driver. She had been brimming with indignation at
                  the sight of Claudia, whose <emph>evil eye</emph> she had no doubt had made her
                  young mistress sick, and she was bursting to have a talk with somebody.</p>
               <p>"Let me ride with mammy," exclaimed Effie, springing up with elfish lightness; "I
                  so tired sitting here—I most sick!"</p>
               <p>"Yes, Mars. Russell, let me have little missy right here," said Kizzie, who had
                  mounted the spirited animal from the steps of the carriage with ah agility that
                  surprised Eulalia, considering her rheumatic affection. The next moment Effie
                  lighted on the pommel of the saddle, like a bright-winged bird, and burst into
                  wild, exulting laughter. Nor did she laugh alone—for Kizzie's figure did form an
                  extraordinary contrast to her young master's. She looked very much like a large
                  ball of India rubber, with a butterfly sticking to it; but the ball, though it
                  seemed to roll about, this side and that, and threaten to tumble off, kept its
                  place, as if it knew what it was about. It bounded up and down, when the horse
                  pranced, as he always would when any one first mounted his back, but it settled in
                  the right spot, and in spite of a quivering, jelly-like motion, maintained its
                  equilibrium to the last.</p>
               <p>"Laugh away, young missus," said she, "it does me good to hear you. Mars. Russell
                  put me here purpose to make you laugh. What I going to do with this here<pb
                     n="22-23" xml:id="VAC6695-00000012"/> strap? Can't get my big foot where master
                  does his! Hi—see how Kizzie's long heel stick out!"</p>
               <p>As she was not encumbered with long, flowing skirts, the form of her feet and
                  ankles were liberally displayed. Eulalia could not help laughing, and the horse,
                  turning his head entirely round and gazing at his new rider, seemed to enter into
                  the spirit of the change, and twinkling his eyes merrily, jogged on, like a
                  cornfield animal, accommodating itself to circumstances.</p>
               <p>Moreland had accomplished his object. He had diverted the thoughts of Eulalia from
                  the dark channel in which they were flowing, and he was left alone at her side.
                  Then he opened to her his whole heart, and told her all the history of the past,
                  without any reservation. From the perfect confidence of this hour, "that perfect
                  love which casteth out fear" was born in Eulalia's bosom. She felt as one does,
                  who, after gazing in quaking terror on the ghost which imagination has created,
                  finds it, on approach, a mass of shadows or a bundle of moonbeams. The interdicted
                  name, the forbidden subject, the deserted dwelling, are always invested with a
                  dread charm, which vanishes with familiarity. While there is one forbidden theme
                  to a husband and wife, it will rise between them a cold, icy barrier, freezing by
                  slow degrees the living warmth of love. It was well that Moreland felt the truth
                  of this in the morning glow of their wedded life, when the dew was on the flower
                  and the freshness on the leaf and the glory in the sky. It kept off the mildew and
                  the cloud. It kept away the tempest and the whirlwind.</p>
               <p>"Is this where we are to rest for the night?" asked Eulalia, as they stopped about
                  twilight at the door of a log-cabin, whose dark and dingy walls were unrelieved by
                  a single pane of glass, the light and air being admitted through wooden
                  shutters.</p>
               <p>"Even so," answered her husband, as he assisted her to alight. "Are you sorry you
                  came?"</p>
               <p>"Oh, no! it makes me think a little of poor Nancy's cottage, only hers has glass
                  windows."</p>
               <p>"Are you very tired, Kizzie?" said she, hearing several expressive
                     <emph>grunts,</emph>as she descended from the saddle, fearing she had purchased
                  the happiness of her husband's company at the expense of Kizzie's comfort.</p>
               <p>"I does feel sorter bruised, missus, but not more than I can bear; you see I ain't
                  used to master's saddle no how, and it makes me a little oneasy and discomforted.
                  Never mind, missus; if you and Mars. Russell is satisfied, Kizzie won't
                  complain."</p>
               <p>Though it was a warm evening, a bright lightwood fire burned in the large
                  tumble-down looking chimney. It was the lamp that lighted the cabin, and
                  displayed, in its broad illumination, the persons of its occupants, A man,
                  hard-favoured and sun-browned, who had evidently been at work in the field, sat in
                  his shirt-sleeves, smoking a long pipe, in the back-door. A woman,<pb n="24-25"
                     xml:id="VAC6695-00000013"/> nearly as brown as himself, dressed in the coarsest
                  homespun, stood looking out of the front window, while two girls, one about
                  twelve, the other fifteen, with short, thick, coarse brown hair hanging in masses
                  over their eyes, while dark calico sunbonnets covered their heads, were peeping
                  over her shoulders. They all appeared very clean and tidy, though rough and
                  uncouth. Their frocks were of a dark indigo colour, and they all wore dark-blue
                  woollen mitts, with long points reaching over the backs of their hands. Why they
                  were so careful of these members, which were of the hue of mahogany, was a
                  mystery, especially the two girls, whose feet were bare as Eve's were in Paradise.
                  Their costume gave Eulalia such an impression of warmth, that, combined with the
                  bright blaze and long wreaths of blue smoke curling up round the warm, brown face
                  in the back door, made her feel very sultry and uncomfortable. She was sure she
                  would melt and suffocate; but she was very much amused, notwithstanding, with the
                  rustic greeting that welcomed them. Her husband was received as a known guest, and
                  evidently an honoured one. Aunt Kizzie was also recognised kindly; but on her, as
                  the Squire's new lady, they bestowed most abundant attention. They came up to her,
                  extending their hands in a straight line, while the long blue tongues on the back
                  of their hands flapped up and down, and gave her the true, hearty, backwood gripe.
                  Then the two girls walked around her, looking at her admiringly through their
                  short, thick hair, and taking an inventory of her dress. The little Effie too
                  received her due share of admiration, and, being a child, they ventured to
                  approach her, as she sat enthroned on Aunt Kizzie's lap, and even slipped their
                  fingers into her coal black ringlets. But the little lady was tired, sleepy, and
                  consequently cross and inaccessible. Nothing could exceed the haughtiness with
                  which she repelled their advances.</p>
               <p>"Get away!" she cried, drawing up her right shoulder and pushing them with her
                  feet; "you too ugly—you shan't touch me!"</p>
               <p>"Shame, little missy," said Kizzie, gathering the offending feet in her black
                  fingers—"Is that the way quality ladies talk?"</p>
               <p>Eulalia, though shocked at the child's imperious rudeness, knew it was not the
                  moment to correct it. She thought of the eyes, so full of pride, disdain, and
                  vindictiveness—eyes that seemed burning on her still, and trembled to think that
                  those dark passions might have been transmitted to the bosom of her offspring.
                  Then she remembered the look of yearning anguish she had cast upon her child, the
                  opening arms, the bending figure, and intense pity quenched her aversion.</p>
               <p>"You had better put Effie to bed, Kizzie," said she, looking round the room, with
                  a vague feeling of anxiety about their accommodations for the night, Moreland was
                  watching her bewildered, half-frightened glance, and could not forbear smiling.
                  There seemed to be but that<pb n="26-27" xml:id="VAC6695-00000014"/> one room in
                  the whole house, for the rafters overhead indicated that there was no upper story.
                  There were four beds in the room, one in each confer, two of them covered with
                  white counterpanes, having a deep border of netting, and the two others with
                  patchwork quilts. The corners occupied by the white beds were evidently considered
                  the guest-chambers of the establishment, and in one of these Kizzie deposited the
                  now sleeping Effie.</p>
               <p>Eulalia had reason to thank the providing care of Kizzie, in having supplied them
                  so liberally with home dainties, for she could taste nothing at supper but a cup
                  of milk. Tumblers and goblets were unknown luxuries to this family of primitive
                  habits. A large dish of bacon and greens, flanked by tremendous hoe-cakes, was the
                  crowning glory of the table. A remnant of a cold sweet-potato pie, and some
                  gingerbread cakes, as large as cheeses, were extra flourishes of gentility,
                  introduced in honour of the guests. But what chiefly attracted Eulalia's
                  admiration was the candlestick which dignified the centre of the table—a large
                  gourd, with a tall, majestic handle, truncated to receive a dim compound of
                  beeswax and tallow, stood upright and towering as Cleopatra's Needle, giving an
                  occasional contemptuous sputter, and shooting upwards a long, fierce, fiery
                  wick.</p>
               <p>"Come, squire," said the lord of the feast, "set yourself convenient, and lay to
                  and help yourself. We don't stand for ceremony in the piny woods—not a bit. Your
                  lady there don't eat one mouthful. I 'spose she ain't used to such coarse vittles.
                  She don't look as if she was. I tell you what, squire, you oughter leave her in
                  the woods a while, and let her scuffle about with my gals a while. Then she'd,
                  have an appetite. See how brown and strong they look!"</p>
               <p>"I do sometimes envy the labouring man his keen appetite and sound sleep,"
                  answered Moreland; "but we indulged in too late a luncheon to do justice to your
                  hospitality."</p>
               <p>"Well, squire, it's the truth," said the farmer, laying down his knife and fork,
                  and using his sleeve for a napkin; "there's nothing like work to make a man
                  contented. I wouldn't changes places with nobody—I wouldn't give a snap for a fine
                  house. What's the use, I want to know, of so much paint and white-wash? It just
                  shows the dirt. Who wants to sit on anything better than a good splint-bottomed
                  chair? Not I. As for eating, I wouldn't give this bacon and greens for all your
                  stuffed nonsense and made up-dishes. It's a great thing, squire, to know what
                  you're eating. Here's my old woman and I hain't had a day's sickness, to speak of,
                  since we was married, and the gals are as tough and healthy as all out doors."</p>
               <p>"Do you never have chills and fevers?" asked Moreland.</p>
               <p>"Pho! what's that? We don't call that sickness. Shake a little one day, up and
                  smart as a pipestem the next. I mean your right down, regular, doctor-bill
                  sickness, that takes all a man earns to pay for. There's<pb n="28-29"
                     xml:id="VAC6695-00000015"/> only one thing I want, and that is, to give my gals
                  an eddication. I am going to send them to school next year; if I have a good crop
                  this. Eddication is a beautiful thing in a woman; it don't matter so much in a
                  man, cause he's got more natteral smartness; but it does set" a woman off
                  mightily. My old woman, here, is a right good scholar. She can write as good a
                  hand-write as anybody need want to see."</p>
               <p>The good lady really blushed at this compliment from her husband, but was
                  evidently pleased and grateful. Eulalia began to like her new acquaintances, for
                  their homely good sense, contentment, and appreciation of each other. There was
                  one fact that impressed her as very strange. The father spoke as if his daughters
                  had their "education yet to begin, though the eldest was fast approaching the
                  years of womanhood. She thought of the superior advantages of the children of New
                  England, where the blessings of education are as diffusive as the sunbeams of
                  heaven, gilding the poor and lowly as well as the rich.</p>
               <p>"Are you very weary?" asked Moreland of his wife, after the supper-table was
                  removed and the farmer had smoked another pipe.</p>
               <p>"No! I have been so much interested in studying character," she remarked in a low
                  voice, "that I have quite forgotten my fatigue."</p>
               <p>"Let us walk, then, awhile. The night is mild and starry, and the scenery around
                  wild and picturesque."</p>
               <p>Knowing the early habits of this class of people, he knew they would have an
                  opportunity of retiring during their ramble, to their own peculiar corners, and
                  that poor Eulalia would thus be saved from unspeakable embarrassment.</p>
               <p>They extended their walk to a spring, whose gushings made soft music in the ear of
                  night. The back-wood farmer always pitches his tent near some welling spring,
                  where his horses and his cattle can be abundantly watered and his own thirst
                  slaked at will. A beautiful grove of willow oaks surrounded it, and a sweet, low,
                  quivering sound went through their branches.</p>
               <p>"What a lonely life this family must lead!" said Eulalia; "no neighbours, no
                  friends, no intercourse with society, save what the passing stranger permits them
                  to enjoy. It seems like living in a wilderness."</p>
               <p>"And so it is; and yet, you see, this life has its own peculiar enjoyments. You
                  must recollect that it is comparatively but a few years since the red man was lord
                  of these woods and plains, and the wild beast made its lair in their shades. This
                  man, energetic and intelligent, is breaking in, as they say, a new portion of the
                  country, and by and by the wild places will show the beauty of cultivation. He has
                  already made money enough to purchase some negroes, who assist him in the field,
                  he being chief workman, as well as overseer. His children, I doubt not, will be
                  rich, and be associated with the magnates of the land. Our social system is<pb
                     n="30-31" xml:id="VAC6695-00000016"/> like the tree now bending over you,
                  Eulalia,—its roots, without grace or beauty? are hidden in the earth, from which
                  they derive strength and support; its hardy trunk rises, without ornament, brown
                  and substantial; then the branches extend, green with foliage, and the birds of
                  the air make their nests among the leaflets. Hark! there is a mocking-bird singing
                  now."</p>
               <p>Yes! the nightingale of the South was just over their heads, and rills of melody,
                  clear, silvery, liquid as the waters of the spring, came flowing down, and bubbled
                  and sparkled around them. It sounded as if a whole orchestra of birds were
                  practising their wild overtures and cavatinas for a great concert, so rich and
                  varied were the notes. Surely such waves of music could not roll from one little,
                  slender, feathered throat! Ah! the mocking-bird is the Jenny Lind of the
                  wild-wood, and her single voice has echoed through the world!</p>
               <p>A very different serenade greeted them when they returned into the cabin. A deep,
                  sonorous bass was rising from under one of the patchwork bed-covers,—showing that
                  the weary were resting from their labours. Every one was wrapped in profound
                  slumber. Kizzie, whose pallet was spread upon the floor by the side of little
                  Effie, was nodding in a chair to some invisible potentate, while waiting for her
                  young mistress to retire. In spite of the novelty of her situation, and the loud,
                  stentorian breathing within the room, Eulalia was soon wandering in the far-off
                  land of dreams. When she awoke, the patchwork quilts were smoothly spread, the
                  workman abroad in the field, his wife busy with her household duties, with the
                  family poke on the top of her head; the girls, in their long-pointed blue mitts
                  and dark calico sun-bonnets, seeming ready for any emergency; and Effie, bright as
                  the morning, frolicking all over Aunt Kizzie. Moreland had gone out to meet the
                  sun, whose coming was heralded by banners of crimson and gold unrolled in the
                  East. Eulalia's toilet was soon completed, but when she looked round in perplexity
                  for a ewer, that she might wash her face and hands, Kizzie made mysterious signs
                  for her to come to the door.</p>
               <p>"You see, missus," she whispered, "these is nobody but Georgia, crackers; they
                  just lives any which way; the way they washes, they pours water out of the gourd
                  on their hands, and then scrubs their faces. I brought some towels, and if you'll
                  just step down to the spring I'll bring 'em, and little missy, too,—there's where
                  massa washed hisself."</p>
               <p>Eulalia was quite delighted with Aunt Kizzie's arrangement, and felt the joy of
                  childhood glowing in her heart, as she bathed her face in the cool, gurgling
                  fountain, and moistened the soft waves of her dark-brown hair. It brought a pale
                  but beautiful bloom to her cheek, which the master of the house complimented, by
                  telling her she looked 'most as well as his gals did.</p>
               <p>"You going to put me horseback to-day, Mars. Russell<pb n="32-33"
                     xml:id="VAC6695-00000017"/> sell?" asked Kizzie, putting on a rueful look, when
                  the horses and carriage were at the door.</p>
               <p>"No, Kizzie. I think that would be too great a task."</p>
               <p>"Lordy, master, I didn't mean that. I mean you going to ride in the carriage this
                  time?"</p>
               <p>"I believe I will ride in the open air this morning," he replied, to the great joy
                  of Kizzie, who had an impression that she did not appear to particular advantage
                  as an equestrian, and who was not partial to the exercise in general.</p>
               <p>The parting benediction of the family was a cordial "wish you well" and "be sure
                  and come agin;" and it probably had more heart in it than the graceful adieus and
                     <foreign xml:lang="FRA">au revoirs</foreign> of the fashionable world.</p>
               <p>It was just before sunset when they arrived at the plantation, and Moreland
                  welcomed Eulalia to her country home.</p>
               <p>And now for the first time she realized that she was the wife of a Southern
                  planter.</p>
               <p>All around, far as the eye could reach, rich, rolling fields of cotton, bearing
                  the downy wealth of the South, stretched out a boundless ocean of green, spotted
                  with white, like the foam of the wave. Long rows of whitewashed cabins, extending
                  back of the central building, whose superior style of architecture distinguished
                  it as the master's mansion, exhibited some black sign at every door, to show the
                  colour of the occupants. Though it wanted something of the usual time, as Moreland
                  wished Eulalia to witness a true plantation scene before the duskiness of
                  twilight, he ordered the bugle blast to sound which called the labourers home, and
                  its echoes rolled over the whitened plains with clear and sweet reverberations.
                  Soon, returning in grand march from the fields, came the negroes, poising on their
                  heads immense baskets, brimming with the light and flaky cotton. Little children,
                  looking very much like walking semicolons, toddled along, balancing their baskets
                  also, with an air of self-importance and pride. Eulalia gazed with a kind of
                  fascination on the dark procession, as one after another, men, women, and
                  children, passed along to the gin house to deposit their burdens. It seemed as if
                  she were watching the progress of a great eclipse, and that soon she would be
                  enveloped in total darkness. She was a mere speck of light, in the midst of
                  shadows. How easy it would be to extinguish her! She recollected all the horrible
                  stories she had heard of negro insurrections, and thought what an awful thing it
                  was to be at the mercy of so many slaves, on that lonely plantation. When she saw
                  her husband going out among them, and they all closed round, shutting him in as
                  with a thick cloud, she asked herself if he were really safe. Safe! Napoleon, in
                  the noonday of his glory, surrounded by the national guard, was not more safe—more
                  honoured or adored. They gathered round him, eager to get within reach of his
                  hand, the sound of his voice, the<pb n="34-35" xml:id="VAC6695-00000018"/> glance
                  of his kind, protecting, yet commanding eye. More like a father welcomed by his
                  children than a king greeted by his subjects, he stood, the centre of that sable
                  ring. Eulalia thought she had never seen him look so handsome, so noble, so good.
                  She had never felt so proud of being his wife. An impression of his power, gently
                  used, but still manifest, produced in her that feeling of awe, softened by
                  tenderness, so delicious to the loving, trusting heart of woman. He appeared to
                  her in a new character. She had known him as the fond, devoted bridegroom; now he
                  was invested with the authority and responsibility of a master. And she must share
                  that responsibility, assist, him in his duties, and make the welfare, comfort, and
                  happiness of these dependent beings the great object of her life. He had twined
                  round her the roses of love, but she was not born to sit idly in a bower and do
                  nothing for those who were toiling for her. He had adorned her with the gems of
                  wealth, but she must not live in selfish indulgence while the wants of immortal
                  souls were pressing upon her, while the solemn warning "Thou must give an account
                  of thy stewardship" was ringing in her soul.</p>
               <p>Never before had she made an elaborate comparison between the white and the black
                  man. She had so often heard her father say that they were born equal—equal in
                  mind, body, and soul, having only the accidental difference of colour to mark
                  them—that she had believed it, and loathed herself for the feeling of superiority
                  over them which she could not crush. But as she looked at her husband, standing in
                  their midst, the representative of the fair sons of Japheth, wearing on his brow
                  the signet of a loftier, nobler destiny, every lineament and feature expressive of
                  intellect and power, and then at each of that dark, lowly throng, she felt a
                  conviction that freedom, in its broadest latitude, education, with its most
                  exalted privileges, could never make them equal to him.</p>
               <p>Gradually they dispersed to their several cabins, and Moreland rejoined his
                  wife.</p>
               <p>"To-morrow, I will take you to their cabins," he said. "They are all anxious to
                  see their young mistress."</p>
               <p>"Why not now?"</p>
               <p>"You are too weary."</p>
               <p>"No, I am not. I have been watching their reception of you with such interest! Oh!
                  my husband! I never dreamed that slavery could present an aspect so tender and
                  affectionate! What a kind, indulgent master you must be, to inspire such warm
                  attachment! Ah! I fear there are not many such!"</p>
               <p>"Sceptic in all goodness but mine! That is not right, my Eulalia. I must not be
                  complimented at the expense of my brethren. I am no better, perhaps not as good as
                  the majority of masters, as you will find out, after having dwelt longer at the
                  South. The cruel ones you will not see; as we have no fellowship with them. I
                  would far sooner make the negro my social companion<pb n="36-37"
                     xml:id="VAC6695-00000019"/> than the man who abuses him. Are not those cotton
                  fields beautiful? Do you see the white blossoms blooming on the surface, some of
                  them shaded with a pale golden tinge, others with rose colour, while the
                  snow-white tufts are bursting from the bolls below? Did you ever see a Northern
                  flower-garden half as beautiful? Do you say you are not tired? Let us go then to
                  some of the cabins. I acknowledge I am impatient to introduce to them my sweet
                  Northern bride."</p>
               <p>We will not attempt to describe all the Aunt Dilsys and Dinahs and Venuses, the
                  Patsys and Pollys, the Uncle Bills and Dicks and Jupiters and Vulcans—to whom
                  Moreland presented his bashful, blushing wife. She really felt more trepidation in
                  passing this ordeal than she would in attending one of the President's levees.</p>
               <p>He carried her first to Aunt Dilsy's cabin, she being the most ancient and
                  honourable matron of the establishment. There Miss Effie was sitting on a little
                  piece of carpet, tossing up a large, scarlet pomegranate, with her lap full of all
                  kind of <emph>goodies.</emph> Dilsy was not as old as Dicey, but her wool was
                  profusely sprinkled with the ashes of age, and time had made many a groove on her
                  face, where its shadows gathered. The locks of the white man grow gray as life
                  wears on, but the negro's black skin, as well as his wool, assumes a dim and hoary
                  aspect, as the dawn of a brighter day approaches.</p>
               <p>"Bless you, for a sweet angel, as you be!" cried Dilsy, whose salutation was a
                  sample of the others, and whose dialect Eulalia at once observed differed from the
                  household 'slaves;—"bless you, young missis, and make you de name and de praise of
                  many generations, dat luv de Lord Jesus Christ. I didn't 'spec to see young missus
                  'fore I die; but, praise de Lord, she come,—and young massa look so happy. Well!
                  he desarves it, de Lord knows. I've had him a baby in dese arms, and his moder
                  before him. I've been praying my Hebenly Massa to send him good wife, good crishen
                  wife, to be his 'zilary in 'nevolence and piety. Now poor Dilsy willing to lay
                  down and neber wake up no more."</p>
               <p>"I will try to deserve your blessing, and be a kind and faithful mistress,"
                  answered Eulalia, with unaffected humility, the tears trembling in her soft dark
                  eyes, while she pressed the dry and wrinkled hand of the aged negro. Dilsy wept
                  like a child, completely melted by such sweetness and condescension, and really
                  believed that the Lord had sent an angel among them.</p>
               <p>In one of the cabins, a young, bright-looking negro girl seemed quite beside
                  herself with rapture, at the sight of her master's lovely young bride. She gazed
                  upon her with distended eyes, showing every tooth of dazzling ivory, then threw
                  herself on the floor, and rolled over several times, shaking with convulsive
                  laughter.</p>
               <pb n="38-39" xml:id="VAC6695-00000020"/>
               <p>"What is the matter with her?" asked Eulalia, timidly, fearing she had fallen in a
                  fit.</p>
               <p>"Oh! you're so putty, missus," said the girl, sitting up and rubbing her
                  eyes,—"you're so putty, I can't help it. Oh, Luddy! I never seed any ting like it,
                  since I ben born. I grate big fool, I know, but I can't help it."</p>
               <p>Here she burst into a fresh peal of laughter, and covered her face with both her
                  hands. Moreland, laughing at this hysterical tribute to his young wife's beauty,
                  drew her away, to receive new testimonies of the personal magnetism, whose
                  drawings <emph>he</emph> had felt when the choral strains first thrilled his soul,
                  in the village church.</p>
               <p>Eulalia, who had never seen the negro at the North, but as an isolated being,
                  beheld him now in his domestic and social relations, and, it seemed to her, that
                  he must be a great deal happier thus situated, bearing the name of a slave, than
                  wandering about a nominal freeman, without the genial influences of home and
                  friends. She had seen the Northern labourer return after a day of toil to the
                  bosom of his family, feeling rest more grateful and refreshing because it was
                  enjoyed there. So the negro returned to his cabin and sat down with his wife and
                  children, and smoked his pipe, and ate his supper, and appeared to think himself
                  very comfortable. But there is one difference. The Northern labourer has anxious
                  thoughts for the morrow, fears that the daily bread for which he is toiling may be
                  withheld, that sickness may paralyze his strong arm, and his children feel the
                  pangs of destitution. The slave thinks not of the morrow, lays up nothing for the
                  future, spends his money for the gratification of the present moment, and gives
                  care and trouble to the winds. No matter how hard he has been at work, if it be a
                  moonlight night, he steals off on a 'possum hunt, or a fishing frolic, or if he
                  hears a violin, he is up and dancing the Virginia breakdown, or the Georgia
                  rattlesnake. If he be one of the "settled ones," to use one of their favourite
                  expressions, he may be heard singing the songs of Zion, in that plaintive,
                  melodious voice peculiar to his race.</p>
               <p>Do the spirits of the labourers in Northern factories ever rebound more lightly
                  than this, after laying down the burden of toil? Do the two hundred thousand poor
                  that throng the royal streets of London breathe forth a more gladdening strain, or
                  lie down to rest with more contentment or gratitude? Do the hundreds and thousands
                  buried in the black coal-pits and wretched dens of Great Britain, who have never
                  heard, in their living graves, of the God who created, the Saviour who redeemed
                  them, pass their sunless lives in greater comfort or fuller enjoyment? Are
                  Russia's forty millions of slaves more free from care and sorrow? Can the victims
                  of Austrian and Prussian despotism boast of greater privileges? Does the groan of
                  oppression, rising above the vine hills of France, speak of joys more dear?
                     Alas!<pb n="40-41" xml:id="VAC6695-00000021"/> all these are forgotten, and the
                  "bolt, red with uncommon wrath," is hurled at the devoted South; as if all the
                  rest of the world were basking in a blaze of freedom, and slavery, condensed into
                  the blackness of darkness, dwelt alone with her.</p>
               <p>"Free! I wonder who is free?" exclaimed the Northern Betsy. We repeat the
                  exclamation. We wonder who is really free in this great prison-house the world.
                  One is bound to the Ixion wheel of habit, and dare not break the fetters that
                  enthral him; another is the slave of circumstances, and writhes till the iron
                  enters his soul. Bigotry stretches one on its Procrustes bed, dragging out the
                  resisting muscles into torturing length, or mangling and mutilating the godlike
                  proportions the Almighty has made. Fanaticism hurls another into an abyss of
                  flame, and laughs over the burning agonies she has created. Poverty! most terrible
                  of masters! We have tried already to depict some of the sufferings of its slaves.
                  Let them pass here.</p>
               <p>Ask that pale, majestic statesman, in whose travailing soul and toiling brain a
                  nation's interests are wrought, who, month after month, is doomed to exchange the
                  sweet atmosphere of home for the feverishness and strife of a political arena,
                  whose sleepless nights are passed in the forge of intense and burning thought, and
                  whose days in gladiatorial combats with warring intellects,—if he is free!</p>
               <p>Ask him who sits in the White Palace, chief of this great republic, filling the
                  grandest station in the vast globe,—if he is free! Are you free? Are we? No! There
                  is a long chain, winding round the whole human" race, and though its links be
                  sometimes made of silver and gold, nay, even twined with flowers, it is still a
                  chain, and if the spirit struggle for liberation, it will feel the galling and the
                  laceration, as much as if the fetters were of brass or iron. For six thousand
                  years the cry for <emph>freedom</emph> has been going up from the goaded heart of
                  humanity—freedom from the bondage and mystery and necessity of life—and still it
                  rends the heavens and echoes over the earth. And the answer has been, and now is,
                  and ever will be—"Be still, and know that I am God."</p>

               <head>CHAPTER II.</head>
               <p>EULALIA was soon initiated in the mysteries of plantation life. With
                  ever-increasing interest she studied the scenes around her, and the character of
                  the community of whose dark circumference she was made the central light. Though
                  possessing little skill or experience as a rider, she accompanied her husband to
                  the bounds of his dominions, through cotton and cornfields, all along the
                  beautiful hedges of Cherokee roses, that, instead of fences, divided the land. At
                  first she only ventured to go on a gentle little pony; but soon, emboldened by
                  practice, she was not afraid to mount the most spirited and high-mettled horse.
                  She visited the sawmill and grist-mill, built on the margin of a roaring stream;
                  the blacksmith's shop, that, isolated from the other buildings, looked as if it
                  were cooling its fiery forge in the fresh green expanse that surrounded it, and
                  where the stalwart artisan, begrimed by nature, heeded not the black soot that
                  settled on his dusky skin; the carpenter's shop, where all the furniture necessary
                  for the negroes was made, even to "a right sharp bedstead or bureau," as the
                  workman told her. She went to the weaving and spinning rooms, where cotton and
                  woollen webs were manufactured for negro clothing, and counterpanes of curious
                  devices. Everything necessary for comfort and use was of home-work, and everything
                  was done with a neatness, order, and despatch that surprised the young mistress of
                  the plantation. The cabins of the negroes, each with their own well-cultivated
                  plot of ground, poultry yard, and melon patch, she loved to visit, for wherever
                  she turned her eye she saw abundant proof of Moreland's considerate kindness and
                  liberality. The watchful guardian providence of the whole establishment, he seemed
                  to see and command everything at a single glance. The overseer was required to
                  give an account of every transaction that occurred during his absence, and his
                  presence was a signal for justice to ascend its throne, ready to weigh in its
                  impartial balance every wrong or dubious act—while mercy knelt at its footstool
                  pleading for the delinquent or offender, and softening its stern decree.</p>
               <p>Eulalia admired the systematic arrangement of everything. The hours of labour were
                  all regulated—the tasks for those hours appointed. For all labour beyond those
                  tasks the negroes were paid an adequate remuneration. Their master purchased of
                  them all the produce, the cotton and corn they had the privilege of raising for
                  themselves, giving them the uttermost farthing. Thus they had an ample supply of
                  spending money—<pb n="44-45" xml:id="VAC6695-00000023"/> not being obliged to use
                  one cent of it for the necessaries of life. One evening one of the men came in and
                  asked his master to take care of his purse till Christmas, when he wanted to buy
                  something fine for his wife. It was nothing but an old woollen mitten, but the
                  contents were quite respectable, being fifty-five dollars.</p>
               <p>"Have you earned all this, Cato?" asked his master.</p>
               <p>"Sartain, massa, sartain—ebery cent. Hope massa don't think I steal it!"</p>
               <p>"Oh, no, Cato! I know you are as honest as you are faithful and industrious. I
                  must treat you as the Lord in Scripture did his servant, who brought him his five
                  talents, to which he had added five talents more. I must give you your own with
                  usury."</p>
               <p>Taking out his own purse, he emptied the contents into Eulalia's hand, reserving a
                  half-eagle which he left in the bottom. Then pouring the money from the old mitten
                  into it, he tossed the fragment to the smiling negro.</p>
               <p>"There, Cato, you deserve a better purse than that. You may make a present of it
                  to your wife."</p>
               <p>"Massa, you too good! Thank you, massa, twenty times over! May you and beautiful
                  young missus live a tousand years, and a tousand arter, besides!"</p>
               <p>"Pray, don't make wandering Jews of us, Cato, or at least save us from eternal old
                  age."</p>
               <p>Cato laughed and chuckled, as if he thought it an excellent cellent joke which he
                  did not quite understand, and went away with a jubilant spirit.</p>
               <p>"What shall I do with this?" said Eulalia, blushingly, clasping her fingers over
                  the dripping money.</p>
               <p>"Simple-hearted child! buy sugarplums or candy. How can you ask me how to dispose
                  of such a trifle?"</p>
               <p>"Trifle! I think it a great deal! At least, it is more than I ever had the
                  disposal of before!"</p>
               <p>Moreland smiled at her simplicity, and, clasping the hand which contained the
                  money in his own, exclaimed—</p>
               <p>"All that I have, and all that I am, is thine, my sweet Eulalia. Had I millions on
                  millions, they should be at your command. Do with me and my fortune all that your
                  pure and generous heart dictates. Have you no wish, my wife, that wealth can
                  gratify, no friend whom your bounty can bless? Are there no poor in your native
                  village, whose wants were forgotten when you left them? Would you not like to send
                  some kind memento home?"</p>
               <p>"I would like them to know how blest, how happy I am; how good, how noble you
                  are!" cried Eulalia, for the first time throwing her timid arms round his neck;
                  then, blushing at her boldness, would have withdrawn them, but he imprisoned them
                  in his own, and retained her in willing bondage.</p>
               <p>"There is a poor family," she said, falteringly, still feeling that it was
                  presumptuous in her to suggest to<pb n="46-47" xml:id="VAC6695-00000024"/> him
                  objects of charity, "whom my mother mentioned in her last letter, as having
                  suffered much from protracted sickness. I thought, when I read of their
                  distresses, how sweet it would be to relieve them. I intended to tell you of their
                  wants, but you gave so much to the poor of our village, I was ashamed to ask for
                  more."</p>
               <p>"Foolish, foolish Eulalia! your only fault is too great timidity, too much
                  self-distrust. You must trust me, or I shall not think you love me. You must feel
                  that I live for your happiness; that your slightest wish has the authority of a
                  command—an authority second only to the canons of God. So perfect is my confidence
                  in your purity and rectitude of principle, that I would hesitate as soon to
                  execute the commission of an angel as I would yours. I have once been deceived,
                  and I thought all confidence was wrenched from my bosom, but it is not so. My
                  trust in you is as firm as that which rests upon the Rock of Ages."</p>
               <p>"If I ever prove unworthy of that trust, may I forfeit the favour of my God!"
                  cried Eulalia, awed by the deep tenderness of his voice and manner, and lifting
                  her eyes of holy innocence to heaven.</p>
               <p>"My confidence is based on your piety and truth, Eulalia," said he, after a pause,
                  in which his mind went back to the past. "Your unhappy predecessor was destitute
                  of this restraining influence, and became the slave of her own wild passions. Born
                  of an Italian mother, and inheriting from her a "warmth and vehemence mence of
                  character that nothing but religion could I control—but why do I speak of her
                  now!—why recall I her at this moment, sacred to joy and love!"</p>
               <p>"There is one favour I would ask," said Eulalia, when the tone of their
                  conversation was a little lowered; she was growing startlingly bold, it seems, in
                  consequence of his excessive indulgence. "I want you to call me Eula. It was my
                  name of endearment at home. It used to sound so sweet from the lips of Dora. I
                  love it so much better than Eulalia."</p>
               <p>"Eula, Eula!" repeated he; "well, henceforth and evermore be it Eula. I remember
                  the first time I heard that name breathed by Dora's sweet lips, as I was following
                  you out of church. I wanted to catch her up in my arms and kiss her, for teaching
                  my heart the name it was throbbing to learn. But what will you call me? I don't
                  believe you have ever addressed me by name yet?"</p>
               <p>Eula, as she resolved to be called, blushed and smiled. She had often been
                  perplexed how to address him, and was glad he had introduced the subject.</p>
               <p>"Call me Russell, as Ildegerte does. It makes me feel like a boy to be called by
                  my Christian name,—the name I received at the baptismal font."</p>
               <p>"That would sound too familiar for me. I feel too much reverence to admit of it. I
                  never could get accustomed to it."</p>
               <p>"Anything then, but <emph>Mr.</emph> Moreland. I cannot consent<pb n="48-49"
                     xml:id="VAC6695-00000025"/> to that. What a pity I have not the dignity of a
                  title; but, rife as they are in this country, I am neither colonel, major, or
                  general: only a plain, unhonoured man."</p>
               <p>"Moreland, then!" she repeated, in a low voice,—" that name is music to my
                  ears."</p>
               <p>This was a very trifling matter to arrange, and yet Eulalia (we will try to get
                  into the habit of calling her Eula, thinking with her, it has a more
                  home-endearing sound,) felt a little happier for it. It was one more link in the
                  golden chain of love and confidence, wreathed round her heart.</p>
               <p>She became so much pleased with plantation life, that, whenever her husband spoke
                  of returning to town, she entreated him to remain, saying, she could do so much
                  more good where she was. The injunction of her father, to be a missionary to the
                  poor benighted slaves, often recurred to her; but she found the heralds of the
                  gospel had preceded her, and that the ground on which she stood was consecrated by
                  the footsteps of Christianity. Moreland had erected a chapel in the heart of the
                  plantation, and though, like the cabins, it was constructed of logs, and the seats
                  were only rustic benches, it was hallowed by as sincere devotion and childlike
                  faith as ever filled with incense the heaven-dedicated dome. No proud,
                  intellectual self-sufficiency,—no cold, questioning philosophy,—no God-defying
                  strength of reason impeded, in their simple minds, the reception of evangelical
                  truths.</p>
               <p>Moreland paid a regular salary to an itinerant preacher for supplying this rustic
                  pulpit on the Sabbath, and there was a black preacher besides, who, if he had not
                  the learning, emulated the zeal of St. Paul. Eulalia was astonished at his
                  knowledge of Scripture, and the occasional inspiration of his language. His name
                  was Paul, and he was looked up to with as much veneration by the coloured people
                  as if he were the great Apostle of the Gentiles. During the week they had prayer
                  meetings at night, and their choral voices uniting in hymns of praise often rose
                  in the stillness of the midnight hour. In the exercises of these meetings Aunt
                  Dilsy took a conspicuous part. She was regarded as another daughter of Phanuel,
                  who, by holy fastings and prayers, had become completely sanctified, and her
                  exhortations were received as the oracles of truth and wisdom. She was a great
                  singer; and though her once musical voice was untuned by age, no one was thought
                  to sing with the <emph>sperrit</emph> as Aunt Dilsy did, or to shout hosannas of
                  glory with such thrilling devotion.</p>
               <p>Eulalia loved to witness their simple religious rites. Ofttimes, when she and her
                  husband were walking out in the coolness of evening, in the path that led by the
                  chapel, they heard their names as good massa and missus borne on the wings of
                  prayer above the silent, listening stars; and they felt as if blessings came down
                  upon them with the stilly dews. Sometimes they went in and united in spirit with
                  the dark worshippers; and beautiful<pb n="50-51" xml:id="VAC6695-00000026"/> tiful
                  was the contrast of Eulalia's fair, ethereal face, with the black visages and
                  coarse features of the Africans. And sometimes, moved by an irresistible impulse,
                  she suffered her seraphic voice to mingle with theirs, and it had a tone of more
                  than mortal sweetness.</p>
               <p>One night she missed the old prophetess Dilsy in the evening assembly. This was
                  such an unusual occurrence, she begged Moreland to accompany her to her cabin and
                  see if she were ill. As they approached the door they heard low, monotonous,
                  ejaculatory sounds issuing from within. They recognised the accents of prayer, and
                  entered reverently. By a lamp glimmering on the hearth they distinguished the
                  figure of Aunt Dilsy on the outside of the bed, looking so shrivelled and drawn
                  up, it seemed to have lost half of its usual dimensions.</p>
               <p>"Oh, massa! oh, missus!" she cried, in answer to their anxious inquiries—"I struck
                  with death I know! Such a misery in my breast! 'Pears like a knife in dare! Poor
                  old creetur!—time to go; ben long time cumberer of de ground! Thank de Lord, I'm
                  willing to mind his blessed summons! I'm ready, 'cause he gin me de white wedding
                  garment to put on, arter he wash it all over clean in his 'toning blood!"</p>
               <p>Here a violent paroxysm of pain interrupted her utterance, and she lay panting and
                  groaning, and her sunken eyes rolled upward with such an expression of mortal
                  agony that Eulalia believed her soul was immediately diately departing. Her
                  physical sufferings were relieved by some specific which Moreland applied, so that
                  she was able to speak once more; but it was evident that the hour of her departure
                  was arrived, and that the Son of Man was come. She wanted the negroes to be called
                  in to receive her last farewell, and they were summoned. They stood in dark
                  circles, one behind the other, gazing with unspeakable awe on the dying
                  prophetess. Drawn by the mysterious and awful fascination of death, they pressed
                  nearer and nearer, till Moreland was compelled to wave them back, lest every
                  breath of air should be excluded from the expiring woman.</p>
               <p>"Let 'em come, massa," she said, with a beckoning motion, "Can't hurt me now. Oh!
                  brudders and sisters in de Lord Jesus II most got home. I see de golden streets
                  way up yonder. I see de grate house not made by hands wid de door wide open, ready
                  to let poor ole sinner in. Somebody, all shining like de sun, stand right in de
                  door and say:—'Come in, Dilsy! Set down at de right hand of de Lord.'"</p>
               <p>The most ecstatic expression it is possible to conceive lighted up her poor
                  withered features. It seemed that a vision of glory, such as is never vouchsafed
                  to any but the-dying, was sweeping down upon her, wrapping her soul in folding
                  sheets of splendour and bliss. Inexpressibly awed, Eulalia knelt by her bedside,
                  clasping the hand of her husband, who stood reverently gazing on<pb n="52-53"
                     xml:id="VAC6695-00000027"/> the aged negress, who, through nearly three
                  generations, had been the faithful servant and humble friend of his family. Her
                  children and her children's children were gathered round her; but as the vision
                  gradually faded away, and her clouding eye turned wistfully to earthly objects, it
                  was on the face of her master she gazed, with such an expression of affection,
                  gratitude, and humility combined, that his answering glance was dimmed with
                  tears.</p>
               <p>"Good by, massa!" she cried, fumbling with the bedcover, thinking it was his hand
                  she was grasping. Perceiving her motion, he took hers, in his. It was damp and
                  cold as ice.</p>
               <p>"Good by, massa! my Hebenly Massa has bought me wid his own precious blood, and he
                  say I must leave you. You ben good, kind massa. I'll tell the Lord when I git home
                  to glory, all you've done for de soul and body of poor nigger. Oh! massa! 'spose
                  you don't know poor Dilsy when you git to heben, 'cause she'll be beautiful, white
                  angel den; but you jist look hard at de hebenly throng, and de one dat lub you
                  best of all, wid her new eyes—dat will be me."</p>
               <p>"Dilsy," said her master, in a voice husky from emotion, "you have been a good and
                  faithful friend to me and mine. You are going to receive the reward of your
                  fidelity. You will hear the voice of God pronounce the glad sentence:'Come, thou
                  good and faithful servant vant, enter thou into the joy of thy Lord.' If I am ever
                  admitted into the kingdom of heaven, I expect to meet and recognise you as an
                  angel of light."</p>
               <p>Amid the loud sobs that burst forth from the circling negroes, there went up a
                  shout of "glory;" and several voices echoed it till the hosannas seemed too
                  swelling for that little cabin. The sinking faculties of life gathered new energy
                  from the jubilant sounds.</p>
               <p>"Yes! brudders and sisters!" she cried, clapping her cold, feeble hands, "rejoice
                  that ye eber hearn of de Lord Jesus and de blessed herarter. If we'd all staid in
                  de heathen land, where all de black folks come from, we'd neber known noting 'bout

                  Tink of dat, if Satin eber tempt you to leave good massa and missus.</p>
               <p>"Looking at the weeping Eulalia, she said—</p>
               <p>"Please, young missus, sing one of de songs of Zion. 'Pears like I'll go to glory
                  on it. Someting 'bout Jesus and de Lamb."</p>
               <p>Eulalia felt as if she had little voice to sing, but she could not refuse the last
                  request of the departing Christian. Low and trembling she began, but the notes
                  grew clearer and sweeter as she continued; sometimes low and soft, as if they came
                  murmuring from the depths of ocean, then swelling in volume, they seemed to be
                  rolling from the bosom of a cloud.<pb n="54-55" xml:id="VAC6695-00000028"/> These
                  were the words she sang,— <q>

               <p>Again she sang,— <q>

               <p>As the last lines died on the ear, the shadow of the mighty wing of the
                  death-angel visibly darkened the brow of the departing negress. There was an awful
                  hush, for a few moments, and then an eager pressing forward, as if the eye could
                  behold, in the rifted clay, where the struggling soul had rent its passage to
                  eternity. Moreland drew Eulalia from the cabin, assuring her that every respect
                  would be paid to the remains of the now enfranchised Dilsy.</p>
               <p>All night the negroes watched by her body, singing, in choral strains, of the
                  triumph of redeeming love. They even added another verse to the immemorial hymn of

               <p>The next day, a little before sunset, Dilsy was laid in the green enclosure where
                  some of her children already slept. It was the burying-ground of the plantation,
                  surrounded by a neat, whitewashed paling, and shaded by evergreens and shrubbery.
                  On some graves, flowers were growing, showing that the taste which loves to
                  beautify the places of death is sometimes found in the bosom of the African. A
                  long procession followed the body of the ancient matron, headed by the master whom
                  she had loved in life, and blessed in death. He walked before them all, with
                  folded arms and measured tread—stood, with uncovered head, while they lowered the
                  coffin into the deep, dark, narrow cavity scooped to receive it; threw the first
                  shovelful of earth on the hollow-sounding<pb n="56-57" xml:id="VAC6695-00000029"/>
                  lid, and waited till the cold abyss was filled, and the damp clay heaved above
                  it.</p>
               <p>"Oh, God!" he silently ejaculated, lifting his eyes heavenward, "I have tried to
                  do my duty to this poor dust committed to my care. I received it, as a part of my
                  inheritance, as a trust for which I shall be responsible to thee, and thee alone.
                  If I have failed, thou great Searcher of all human hearts, forgive me! and show me
                  wherein my error lies. Here, by this solemn new-made grave, I renew the dedication
                  of my soul to thy service, and the good of my fellow-beings."</p>
               <p>Then, turning to the negroes who stood leaning on their shovels, looking down
                  mournfully on the hillock they had made, he said—</p>
               <p>"You heard the words of the dying Dilsy. You heard what she said to you and to me.
                  She told you to be grateful that you were brought away from a land of darkness and
                  the shadow of death, to regions where the light of the gospel shines upon your
                  souls, where you are taught that the grave is a passage to glory and happiness,
                  where you are prepared to meet, in faith and hope, the dark hour through which she
                  has just safely passed. Did you believe her words? Do you think she would deceive
                  you, when her gasping breath was about leaving her body?"</p>
               <p>"No, massa!" answered Paul, the preacher; "sartain she wouldn't! We know she spoke
                  the truth."</p>
               <p>"Then you would not think freedom without a God, freedom without a Saviour,
                  without hope of a hereafter, without the promises of eternal life, a
                  blessing?"</p>
               <p>"No, massa! not a bit, not a bit."</p>
               <p>"Would you think freedom a blessing, if I should scatter you all at this moment to
                  the four winds of heaven, give up all care and guardianship of you and your
                  children, suffer you to go where you please, leaving you to provide for the
                  necessities of the morrow and all future wants?"<ref rend="super"

                  <p><ref target="#return_001">*</ref>A free negro, who resides at St. Andrew's Bay, had amassed money enough to
                     build him a comfortable house. He supported himself and family by
                     boat-building. In one of those storms which often desolate the coast, his
                     house was swept away. He came to many gentlemen, entreating them to purchase
                     himself and family, saying he was tired of the responsibility of their
                     support. He had known what slavery and freedom were, and he preferred the
                     first.</p>
               </note>
               <p>"No, massa, no!" burst forth simultaneously from the funeral band.</p>
               <p>"You heard," added Moreland, with solemnity, "her dying blessing upon your master.
                  You heard what she said she would repeat before God and his angels. Do you believe
                  her words were true? Have I been kind and just to all? Or do you look on me as a
                  tyrant, from whose dominion you long to be free?"</p>
               <p>Here the denial was still more earnest and emphatic. Tears were streaming down the
                  cheeks of those around the grave, and sobs were heard in the back-ground.</p>
               <p>"Then," said Moreland, "let us make a new covenant together, and let this grave be
                  a witness between us all,<pb n="58-59" xml:id="VAC6695-00000030"/> that we do it
                  in sincerity and truth. I call upon you all to renew your promises of fidelity and
                  obedience. I pledge myself anew to watch over your best interests for time and
                  eternity. If I ever forget my vow, if I ever become unjust, unkind, or tyrannical,
                  you may lead me to this clay-cold bed and remind me of my broken faith. And now,
                  Paul," turning to the weeping preacher, whose sensibilities were all melting and
                  flowing from his eyes, "let us all kneel together, while you consecrate this
                  burial spot by the breath of prayer."</p>
               <p>Just as the last words of Paul's devout and eloquent prayer, the ascription of
                  praise and thanksgiving, was uttered, the setting sun, which had been curtained by
                  a cloud parallel with the horizon, so that all thought the twilight was begun,
                  suddenly gleamed forth, sending out innumerable radii of crimson and gold, from
                  its red and glowing disk. It gilded the pale and earnest countenance of Moreland
                  with a kind of supernatural radiance, bronzed the crisped wool and black glossy
                  skin of the negroes, and gave a tinge of ruddiness to the cedar's dark green
                  foliage. Was it a token from heaven? "Was it fire from above descending on the
                  altar of the heart, showing that the sacrifice was accepted? So thought Paul, the
                  preacher. So thought all the Africans; and they were as sure, ever afterwards,
                  that Dilsy was in glory, as if they had seen her with victorious palms in her
                  right hand and a golden lyre in her left.</p>
               <p>It was not till several weeks afterwards that her "funeral was preached," as the
                  negroes say, and then the slaves from adjoining plantations, came to do honour to
                  the memory of this sable mother in Israel. It was some time before the solemnity
                  caused by her death passed away. No music was heard at night but choral hymns; and
                  the step of the dancer was still. But the banjo's monotonous thrumming at length
                  was heard, rather faintly at first, then giving out a bolder strain, and then the
                  violin's melodious scraping called out the little darkies from their nooks and
                  crannies to <emph>jump Georgia motion</emph> with their India-rubber toes.</p>
               <p>It was with reluctance that Eulalia left the plantation. All her fears and
                  repugnance of the black race were gone, leaving, in their stead, the sincerest
                  attachment and the deepest interest. She wrote to her parents the most
                  enthusiastic description of the life she had witnessed; and, while she made her
                  mother the almoner of her husband's bounty to the poor, dwelt upon all his
                  excellent and noble qualities with fond and eloquent diffuseness. "Happy!—do you
                  ask if I am happy?" she added. "I tremble at the excess of my felicity, knowing
                  that it cannot be always thus. On the blue and cloudless firmament I watch for the
                  rising cloud."</p>
               <p>Poor Eulalia!—the cloud was near at hand. A letter from Dr. Darley was awaiting
                  their return, involving the necessity of Moreland's immediate departure. It was
                  written after the death of Richard, and the abduction<pb n="60-61"
                     xml:id="VAC6695-00000031"/> tion of Crissy, while Ildegerte was languishing on
                  a sick-bed. The moment the letter was given into his hands, Eulalia knew that it
                  was the messenger of sad tidings, for she caught a glimpse of the black seal; but
                  she did not anticipate the extent of Ildegerte's sorrow. She watched her husband's
                  countenance as he read. At first it was sad, very mournful, 'but gently so. The
                  grief that shaded it was of that nature which sympathy might soothe, and she drew
                  near, that he might feel her readiness to participate in all his sorrows, and laid
                  her hand, with soft, unobtrusive motion, on his shoulder; when suddenly starting
                  up, shaking it unconsciously from his arm, he knit his brows fiercely, while angry
                  lightning flashed from his eyes.</p>
               <p>"Mean, cowardly, cruel!" he exclaimed, clenching the letter with such force that
                  he shivered and rent it in his grasp. "When God afflicts, it is easy to submit;
                  but when the blow comes from man,—comes in the dark, with the cruelty of an
                  assassin, and the baseness of a robber,—by Heaven, it is hard to bear!"</p>
               <p>Eulalia trembled and turned pale. She had never before seen her husband angry, and
                  there was something terrible in the wrath of that usually serene and beaming
                  countenance. She dared not question him, save with her beseeching eyes. Crushing,
                  as it were, his vehement emotion as suddenly as he had done the letter, he said,
                  in a more subdued but still indignant tone,</p>
               <p>"Forgive my violence; I did not mean to alarm you. Richard is dead!—God took
                  him,—it is well. Crissy is gone!—lured from her mistress, in the hour of her
                  bitterest agony,—miserable dupe that she is! Let her go,—let her go! But Ildegerte
                  lies on a sick-bed,—no friend but Dr. Darley by her. Eulalia,—Eula, I must go to
                  her. I must leave you for a while. <emph>You</emph> would not wish me to
                  stay."</p>
               <p>"Oh, no!" she exclaimed, bursting into tears, "she needs you more than I. Alone
                  among strangers; with a broken heart!—how sad! How could Crissy leave her, when
                  she seemed to love her so dearly, and promised so faithfully to abide by her!"</p>
               <p>"Blame not her," said Moreland; "poor, ignorant, deluded creature! She was
                  probably assailed by arts which her simplicity was powerless to baffle. I feel
                  only pity for her. But for those who inflicted this wrong on my unoffending
                  sister, whose situation should have inspired the deepest sympathy and
                  commiseration, I have no words to express my indignation. Give me the foe that
                  braves me face to face in the blaze of noonday; but shame on the coward who skulks
                  in ambush, with the smiling lip and the assassin hand! Had they broken into
                  Ildegerte's room, rifled her of her gold and her raiment, the act would have been
                  less unprincipled, for her <emph>heart</emph> would not have suffered. They have
                  stolen from her a <emph>friend,</emph> in the hour of her extremest need, and
                  added dreariness and anguish to the desolation of widowhood<pb n="62-63"
                     xml:id="VAC6695-00000032"/> hood! Great God! what will the end of these things
                  be! What will be the end of unprovoked attack, injustice, and aggression on one
                  side, and exasperated feeling, wounded honour, and disregarded brotherhood on the
                  other! Oh! my wife! my dear wife! if it were not for thee, I would rather rend
                  asunder, with one mighty effort, the ties which bind the South and the North, than
                  live with this burning under-current accumulating strength from a thousand
                  sources, and undermining our institutions, our prosperity and happiness! Perish
                  the body, if the spirit be wanting there! Madness to talk of union, with
                  bitterness and rancour and every evil passion rankling in the heart's core!"</p>
               <p>Moreland was excited beyond the power of self-control. What could Eulalia say? Was
                  not her own father a leader in the party whose influence he deprecated with such
                  indignant vehemence? But every thought was soon swallowed in the idea of
                  approaching separation. He was to leave her on the morrow, to be gone she knew not
                  how long; he was going on a sad errand—to bring back a widowed sister, accompanied
                  by the lifeless body of her husband. In the contemplation of Ildegerte's sorrows
                  she tried to forget her own; but she felt that absence was the shadow of death,
                  and it hung dark and chill over her soul.</p>
               <p>Moreland was anxious that she should invite some female Companion to cheer her
                  solitude, but she shrunk from the suggestion. She would a thousand times rather be
                  alone, or with no companion but little Effie, who was becoming every hour more
                  dear to her affections. In instructing Effie's heart, and through her heart
                  finding the avenue to her understanding; in her music lessons, books, letters; the
                  care of her servants, the superintendence of her household, she would pass the
                  dreary hours of absence and wait his return.</p>
               <p>Early in the morning he took his departure. Eulalia did not stand under the
                  blossoming wreaths of the now fading honeysuckle to witness his going, as she had
                  done once before. Her face was buried in the window curtain of her chamber. She
                  had not the courage to look upon his departing figure. Just as he was leaving the
                  gate, poor Jim detained him to repeat once more the injunction not to come back
                  without Crissy. He seemed quite broken-hearted by her desertion, and could not
                  speak of her without tears. There was no place for resentment in his soft,
                  uxorious heart.</p>
               <p>"Tell her, massa, I done forgive her. 'Tain't none of her doings, no how; but her
                  things will spile sure as she be alive. Tell her I got no heart to air 'em no
                  more. Don't care if they drop to pieces!"</p>
               <p>Notwithstanding this assertion, Jim pored over the contents of the big chest with
                  increasing devotion, and early on, many a bright sunny morning a long line of
                  parti-coloured garments rejoiced in the freshening breeze.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER III.</head>
               <p>A VERY unexpected visiter interrupted the monotony of Eulalia's life, during the
                  absence of Moreland.</p>
               <p>She was sitting one morning alone, in the parlour, practising her last music
                  lesson with all the assiduity of a school-girl, wishing to surprise her husband
                  with her proficiency, on his return, when the door opened and a lady entered,
                  unannounced. The music drowned the sound of her entrance, and Eulalia's first
                  consciousness of her presence was so startling that it made her spring from her
                  seat, as if penetrated by an electric shock. She heard no step, and yet, an
                  inexplicable sensation induced her to turn, and close to the instrument she beheld
                  the haughty, yet graceful figure, whose lineaments, once seen, could never be
                  forgotten. There were the large, black, resplendent, yet repelling eyes, that were
                  for ever haunting her,—the red lips of scorn, the pale olive cheek, the bold, yet
                  classic brow—all the features daguerreotyped on her memory.</p>
               <p>They stood for several moments without speaking, gazing at each other,—the
                  repudiated wife and Northern ern bride of Moreland,—two of the most striking
                  images that womanhood can present, of material beauty and spiritual loveliness.
                  They were both young, both beautiful, but evil, passions had darkened and marred
                  the brilliant face of the one, while purity, goodness, truth, and love had
                  imparted to the other an almost celestial charm.</p>
               <p>"And <emph>you</emph> are now mistress here!" exclaimed the lady, sweeping her
                  proud, bright glance round the apartment, her lip curling and quivering with
                  undefinable emotion.</p>
               <p>"I am," replied Eulalia, her self-possession returning as the voice of the
                  stranger broke the spell which seemed thrown around them both. Her tone was cold
                  and unnatural. She paused, as if waiting an explanation of this unexpected and
                  unwelcome visit. Then, her native courtesy and gentleness, mingled with compassion
                  for the unhappy woman before her, induced her to add—</p>
               <p>"Will you be seated, madam?"</p>
               <p>Claudia threw herself on a sofa, in an attitude of careless independence. The
                  crimson velvet of the covering brought out, in strong relief, the handsome, but
                  bold outlines of her figure, which swelled through the dark mistiness of a black
                  lace drapery. She sat, wrapping this drapery round her exquisitely white hands,
                  all glittering with rings, then, suddenly untying the strings of her bonnet, she
                  tossed it down by her side, and shook her raven black hair back from her brow. Her
                  air of<pb n="66-67" xml:id="VAC6695-00000034"/> proud assurance, the careless
                  home-attitude she assumed, as if she had come to dispossess the sweet young
                  creature before her of the throne she deemed still her right to occupy, roused all
                  the woman in Eulalia's breast. The colour came warm and bright to her cheek and
                  brow.</p>
               <p>"To what am I indebted for a call as unlooked for as undesired?" she asked with
                  dignity, without resuming her seat.</p>
               <p>"To any motive you please," replied the lady, with a deriding smile. "I presume I
                  am not the first lady who has called to pay their respects to the new Mrs.
                  Moreland. Is it a Northern custom to ask one's guests the reason of their coming,
                  the very moment of their arrival, too?"</p>
               <p>"At the North, as well as the South," said Eulalia, her mild eyes flashing with
                  unwonted fire, "the woman who has forfeited her position as a wife and mother is
                  excluded from the social privileges she has wantonly abused. She may be an object
                  of charity, pity, kindness; but of friendship and esteem, never!"</p>
               <p>"Do you dare say this to me?" exclaimed Claudia, starting to her feet, with a look
                  that threatened annihilation.</p>
               <p>"Yes, madam, and far more!" cried Eulalia, emboldened to candour by the insolence
                  of her visiter. "Were you in want, I would most willingly relieve you; were you in
                  suffering, either in body or mind, I would gladly administer succour and
                  consolation; were you bowed down by remorse and sorrow, I would kneel at your
                  side, praying the Saviour of sinners to have mercy on your soul! But when you come
                  with haughty defiance, glorying in your shame, to the home you once desecrated,
                  placing yourself on an equality with the virtuous and pure, I am constrained to
                  say, that your presence is unwelcome and intrusive."</p>
               <p>Grave, serene, and holy, in her youthful purity and sanctity, stood Eulalia,
                  before her predecessor, as stood the angel before transgressing Eve.</p>
               <p>"And you believe <emph>his</emph> story!" exclaimed Claudia, bursting into a
                  scornful laugh. "You believe I am really the vile thing he represents me to be.
                     Yes!—<emph>he</emph> believes it, too. I wanted him to. I would not undeceive
                  him. I trampled him in the dust of humiliation,—willing to endure obloquy and
                  disgrace myself, since shame and dishonour rested on him!"</p>
               <p>"Impossible!d—impossible!" cried Eulalia; "woman never sunk so low!"</p>
               <p>She recoiled from her, as if she were a serpent or a demon. Could it be, that the
                  man whom she so idolatrously loved, had inspired such bitter hatred and
                  revenge!</p>
               <p>"Yes!" continued Claudia,—walking backwards and forwards, with the fierce grace of
                  a leopardess,—"I hated him so intensely, that I was willing to destroy myself,
                  provided I involved him in ruin. I was fool<pb n="68-69" xml:id="VAC6695-00000035"
                  /> enough to think I loved him when I married. Yes, I was the fool then you are
                  now! I thought I married a lover! he turned into my master, my tyrant!—he wanted
                  me to cringe to his will, like the slaves in the kitchen, and I spurned his
                  authority!—I defied his power! He expected me to <emph>obey</emph> him,—me, who
                  never obeyed my own mother! He refused me the liberty of choosing my own friends,
                  of receiving them in my own house! He even had the audacity to command me to shut
                  the doors upon my mother's face! Did he tell you of that? If he did not, I
                  do!"</p>
               <p>She paused for breath, panting from angry excitement. Eulalia beheld a faint
                  specimen of that irascible and indomitable temper which, resisting every moral and
                  religious influence, had made its wretched possessor an alien and an outcast.</p>
               <p>"He did tell me. Shall I repeat the cause?" said Eulalia.</p>
               <p>"No! I will not hear it; it is slander,—the vilest slander! Because my mother was
                  a foreigner, they accused her of all that was evil, and forbid me to associate
                  with her. But, I can tell you, the spirit of the Italian is resilient, and will
                  not be held down. You!—the daughter of a Northern clime, without impulse or
                  passion, cold as your wintry snows,—may wear the yoke without feeling it, and
                  yield the will without knowing it. You are wondrously happy, are you not?"</p>
               <p>Eulalia felt a quick, sharp pang at her heart, at the sudden storm of passion
                  rising and surging within. She knew not before that such powerful elements were
                  slumbering in her breast. At every scornful and mocking word, dashed, as it were,
                  in her face, answering scorn sent its flash to her eye and its bitter taunt to her
                  lip. But the flash went out, the taunt died away without utterance. The angel of
                  consideration did not forsake her, but she could have wept at the introspective
                  view that moment of passion had given her. Without trusting herself to speak,
                  fearing she would say something which she would hereafter regret, she turned away,
                  wondering how this strange and harrowing scene would terminate.</p>
               <p>Claudia made no movement of departure. She was restless, nervous, constantly
                  looking towards the door, sometimes walking with impatient gesture, then throwing
                  herself back on the sofa, and squeezing the crimson cushion with clenching
                  fingers. Once she sat down at the piano, and running her fingers over the keys,
                  produced a wild, passionate burst of harmony, in which a minor note of wailing
                  softness strangely mingled, then, dashing into a gay, reckless strain, the ivory
                  seemed to sparkle under her touch.</p>
               <p>At this moment the door suddenly opened, and Effie, running in, exclaimed—</p>
               <p>"See, mamma, what a beautiful necklace. Netty made it!"</p>
               <pb n="70 (Illustration) " xml:id="VAC6695-00000036"/>
               <p>The child held up a string of wild scarlet berries that encircled her neck and
                  also passed round her waist.</p>
               <p>Claudia sprang towards the child so suddenly, that the little creature, trembling
                  and terrified, ran to Eulalia, leaped into her lap, and locked her hands tightly
                  round her neck.</p>
               <p>"Give me the child!" cried Claudia, with a vehemence that increased Effie's
                  terror, and made her cling still more closely to Eulalia's throbbing bosom. "She
                  is mine! I will not give her up! Has not the mother a right to her own child? Look
                  at me, Effie! Speak to me, Effie! I am your mamma! Come and go with me!"</p>
               <p>"No, you ain't my mamma!" answered the child, making a repelling motion with her
                  foot, still keeping her arms tightly folded round her stepmother's neck. "This is
                  flay mamma—my sweet, pretty mamma! I love her! I won't leave her! Go 'way! I don't
                  want you to look at me so hard!"</p>
               <p>An expression of unutterable anguish passed over the features of Claudia, and she
                  pressed her hand upon her bosom, as if it were closing over a wound. Then Eulalia
                  pitied her, Pitied her from the bottom of her heart. Over the wreck of all womanly
                  charities and graces and sensibilities, maternal love cast a ray of redeeming
                  lustre. Like a plume dropped from the wing of a departed angel, it was a token of
                  vanished glory.</p>
               <p>For a moment the young stepmother doubted her<figure>

                  <pb n="71" xml:id="VAC6695-00000037"/> right to resist the pleadings of nature.
                  Had not the mother purchased her child by the pains and sorrows of maternity, and
                  could any legal decision annul the great law of God, which makes the child a
                  mother's almost life-bought property?</p>
               <p>"She isn't my mamma, is she?" whispered Effie, glancing obliquely at Claudia
                  through her long, curling black lashes. "Make her go away—I don't love her!"</p>
               <p>Eulalia clasped the child closer to her bosom, feeling still more intensely for
                  the unhappy mother. What answer could she give to this direct question? More-land
                  had insisted that Effie should never know of the existence of her own mother; that
                  her name should never be uttered in her hearing; that to Eulalia alone her filial
                  thoughts should be directed, her filial obedience paid. Could she, knowing this
                  prohibition in all its length and breadth, say to the child that the woman, from
                  whose large, black, wildly-beaming eyes she was shrinking in terror and
                  repugnance, was indeed her mother?</p>
               <p>"Is she my mamma?" repeated Effie, impatient at Eulalia's silence.</p>
               <p>"Answer her!" dried Claudia, sternly; "answer her! Tell her no, at the peril of
                  your soul's salvation!"</p>
               <p>"Why—why have you come hither, to bring confusion and sorrow into a home no longer
                  yours!" answered Eulalia, the purity and strength of her moral principles
                  conquering the softness and tenderness of her nature.<pb n="72-73"
                     xml:id="VAC6695-00000038"/> "This child is <emph>mine</emph>—committed to my
                  guardianship by the father, who has abjured your maternal right! The conduct by
                  which you forfeited your position as a wife, made you unworthy to fulfil a
                  mother's duties! Even if virtually innocent, as you declare yourself to be, and
                  you have allowed disgrace and shame to rest upon you through hatred and revenge,
                  you are guilty of blacker, more deliberate sin, than if you were the victim of
                  passion and temptation! Go!—this child is mine! I never will resign her! Go!—your
                  presence makes me very unhappy! The air is oppressive! I cannot breathe
                  freely!"</p>
               <p>She looked very pale, and really panted for breath. Little Effie was
                  half-suffocating her with her clinging arms; and the eyes of Claudia, so dark and
                  sultry, like the lurid dog-star, seemed surrounded by a hot, stifling
                  atmosphere.</p>
               <p>"I <emph>will</emph> have the child! By Heaven! I'll not return without her!"
                  exclaimed Claudia, snatching Effie with frantic violence from her arms and rushing
                  to the door. With a shriek that rung through the house, Eulalia sprang after her,
                  but Claudia had gained the outer door, smothering the cries of Effie by pressing
                  her hand tightly on her mouth. She there met an unexpected impediment in the ample
                  person of Aunt Kizzie; and right behind her were Albert and Netty, all drawn by
                  that one piercing shriek. Claudia struggled to pass them, commanding them to give
                  way, with the authority of a queen, and the look of a lioness fighting for her
                  young.</p>
               <p>"What you doing with little missy, I want to know?" cried Kizzie, holding out her
                  strong arms to the child, who was writhing and coiling herself up so that it was
                  almost impossible to hold her. "Give her here!—you got nothing to do with her now!
                  Putty story to tell master when he come back home! Don't cry, honey, mammy got
                  you, sure enough! Folks as wants to carry you off better look sharp—see if Kizzie
                  ain't somewhere 'bout! Good morning, missus;" making a mocking curtsy—"won't keep
                  you standing!"</p>
               <p>Claudia, baffled and insulted by the very vassals she once tried to trample under
                  her feet, turned furiously upon Kizzie, and struck at her with frantic rage.
                  Kizzie dodged her head at the exact moment, and Claudia's hand came down upon the
                  door frame with such force that the blood gushed from her fingers. Albert and
                  Netty both laughed. They were revenging themselves for her former haughtiness and
                  insolence. Infuriated by this fresh insult, she again lifted her hand to strike,
                  but the sight of her bleeding finger's suddenly arrested her. Perhaps she realized
                  for the first time the impotence of her passion, the disgrace she was bringing on
                  herself. Gathering the rich drapery of lace that was falling from her shoulders,
                  and folding it round her arms with such a quick, passionate gesture, the delicate
                  meshes were rent like a cobweb, she flew down the steps, entered the<pb n="74-75"
                     xml:id="VAC6695-00000039"/> carriage, and was driven rapidly away. Eulalia, who
                  stood faint and, trembling in the inner doorway, saw her put her head from the
                  carriage just as it rolled away, and gaze at the house and its surroundings, with
                  a wild, lingering glance, such as was once turned upon the forfeited bowers of
                  Paradise by earth's first tempted and exiled.</p>
               <p>It was long before Eulalia recovered from the shock of this interview. She was
                  afraid to have Effie absent from "her sight one moment. She did not feel safe
                  herself from the violence of this fearful woman. She was humiliated by the
                  knowledge of such deep depravity in one of womankind. It was exquisitely painful
                  to her to think that Moreland had ever loved such a being. It seemed to detract
                  from the purity, the dignity of his love for her. True, it was a boyish passion,
                  caused by a fascination such as the serpent exercises on its victim, but she would
                  have given worlds if it had never existed. Then she reflected that she knew this
                  before she married, that Moreland had never deceived her, and that whatever his
                  feelings had once been for Claudia, <emph>she herself</emph> now reigned sole,
                  mistress of his reclaimed affections. It was weak, it was sinful in her to indulge
                  in these morbid regrets. Who was she, that, of all the daughters of humanity, she
                  should gather the roses of joy, and find no thorns beneath, that she should quaff
                  the sparkling wine, and find no lees in the cup? Had not her husband far more to
                  regret than she? For her sake he had borne with injustice, misconstruction, and
                  prejudice; he had bowed his pride and subdued his will, and sacrificed all
                  personal feeling.</p>
               <p>Her next emotion was unalloyed compassion for the erring Claudia. Had
                     <emph>she</emph> been good and true, the village maiden of the North would
                  never have been the Southern planter's bride.</p>
               <p>We said in the beginning of this history, we should say no more of Moreland's past
                  life than was necessary for a clear understanding of passing events. We will only
                  say a few words here, to vindicate him from the charges brought against him by the
                  unhappy Claudia. She was the daughter of Italian parents, who trained her from
                  childhood for public exhibition in the song and the dance. They themselves were
                  itinerant minstrels, wandering through the American cities, leading a kind of
                  wild, gipsy life, satisfied if the wants of the present moment were supplied. The
                  little Claudia, dressed in fantastic and gaudy attire, attracted the admiration of
                  all by her singular and brilliant beauty, and her wild, elfin graces. It was to
                  her the silver was tossed, which she caught as lightly and gracefully as the wind
                  catches the blossom from the trees, and every act of bounty was acknowledged by a
                  fairy-like curtsy and a kiss wafted by the tiny hand to the delighted donor.</p>
               <p>Once they stopped in front of a stately mansion in a Southern city; a widow lady
                  of wealth and high standing was the occupant She had no children of her<pb
                     n="76-77" xml:id="VAC6695-00000040"/> own; and, as she looked from her
                  curtained window on the beautiful child, doomed to such a reckless, vagabond life,
                  her heart yearned towards her, and she resolved to rescue her from the degradation
                  in which she would inevitably plunge. She took the child, exacting a promise from
                  the parents to relinquish all claim to and intercourse with her, which they
                  willingly gave, for the sake of the gold she so liberally bestowed upon them.
                  Claudia gave a great deal of trouble to her benefactress, by her wilful,
                  passionate temper, which had never known correction or management; but she was so
                  beautiful, graceful, and intelligent,—was so much caressed and admired by all her
                  visiters,—that it was an easy task to forgive her childish offences. She grew up
                  with every advantage of education that wealth could impart; and, as the adopted
                  daughter of Mrs. ——, took her position at the head of fashionable life. "When
                  Moreland was in the first glow of manhood, he met her in the ballroom, where the
                  airy graces she had cultivated in childhood hung round her, like gay and flowering
                  festoons, giving a wild charm to her beauty that rendered it irresistible.
                  Moreland was young, handsome, and rich. This was all that Claudia asked in a
                  husband. They seemed drawn by a mutual attraction,—nay, it <emph>was</emph>
                  mutual, for Claudia then felt for Moreland all the love her vain and selfish heart
                  was capable of feeling. Soon after their marriage, her benefactress died. A great
                  restraining influence was thus unfortunately removed; and Claudia began to display
                  those violent and passionate traits of character she had cunningly concealed from
                  the lover she had wished to charm. The slightest opposition to her wishes, the
                  mildest admonition or reproof, created such a storm of passion in her, he often
                  turned from her in consternation and dismay, almost believing he had been the
                  victim of an evil spirit, who, assuming the form of a beautiful woman, had
                  ensnared his heart, and was seeking the destruction of his soul Another source of
                  misery and contention was the reappearance of her mother, claiming to be received
                  into their household. Her husband was dead; and as the adopted mother of Claudia
                  was no more, she was released from the promise which bound her to her. This was a
                  bitter trial to Moreland, but he could not refuse admittance to the mother of his
                  wife. But when he discovered that she had been leading an abandoned life,—that,
                  even then, she was introducing her unprincipled companions into his household
                  during his absence, and making his home a scene of midnight revelry,—he commanded
                  her to depart, promising, at the same time, to provide liberally for her future
                  wants. We will not attempt to describe the frantic violence of Claudia at this
                  just decree. Not that she loved her mother much, but she loved the associations of
                  the wild lawlessness of her early life, awakened by her presence; and she had more
                  fellowship of feeling with the gay, unprincipled men, who had lately frequented,
                  the house, than with<pb n="78-79" xml:id="VAC6695-00000041"/> her noble and
                  highminded husband. She was now a mother, and Moreland dealt very tenderly with
                  her on that account. He endeavoured to win her by gentleness and love to a wife's
                  duty,—a mother's holy cares. But with all this tenderness and gentleness, he never
                  forgot his own dignity and self-respect. There was one of her countrymen whom she
                  welcomed as a visiter, whom he knew to be unworthy and unprincipled. He forbade
                  her to 'associate with him. She laughed at the prohibition, continued to meet him
                  at every opportunity abroad, and received him clandestinely at home. Arrested by
                  detection in her mad career, she justly forfeited her reputation, her position,
                  and her name. The fortune bequeathed to her by her adopted mother was still her
                  own, Moreland had settled it upon her at the time of their marriage; so, in all
                  the glory of independence, she launched anew into the world; but found, by fatal
                  experience, that neither wealth, nor accomplishments, nor beauty, can give a
                  passport in society to the woman whose fame is clouded by suspicion, or stained by
                  ignominy.</p>
               <p>It was about two years after his legal emancipation from these unhallowed bonds,
                  that Moreland travelled in New England, and first met Eulalia Hastings in the
                  village church. Was it a mysterious magnetism that drew him towards her, after
                  having abjured the love of woman? Was it not, rather, the divine sweetness of her
                  voice, the heavenly serenity of her countenance, the simplicity and tranquillity
                  of her manners, presenting so striking a contrast to the stormy electrical
                  splendour of Claudia's beauty, her impassioned gestures, and wild paroxysms of
                  mirth or anger?</p>
               <p>Is not the truth of God, proclaimed mid the thunders and lightnings of Sinai, and
                  written with the burning finger of Almighty justice there, "that the sins of the
                  fathers should be visited on the children, even unto the third or fourth
                  generation," fearfully shown by instances like these? Evil qualities, like
                  physical diseases, are often hereditary, and descend, like the leprosy, a
                  clinging, withering curse, ineradicable and incurable. The taint was in Claudia's
                  blood. Education, precept, and example kept down, for a while, her natural
                  propensities, but when circumstances favoured their growth, they displayed a
                  rankness and luxuriance that could proceed only from the strongest vitality. She
                  had transmitted to her child her passionate and wilful temper, but Effie also
                  inherited her father's heart, and heaven gave her into Eulalia's keeping. Happy
                  influences, in her case, neutralized the transmitted curse, or rather, converted
                  it into a blessing. But it is not always so. Let the man who, infatuated by
                  passion, is about to marry a woman taken originally from the dregs of social life,
                  beware, lest he entail upon his offspring the awful judgment pronounced by a
                  jealous God.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER IV.</head>
               <p>DOES any one wish to know what became of Crissy, whom we left floating on the
                  moonlighted bosom of the Ohio?</p>
               <p>When she awoke the morning after her flight, she looked round her with bewildered
                  gaze. She sat up on her pallet, and rubbing her eyes very hard, endeavoured to
                  realize where she was and how she came there. The room was unplastered, not even
                  lathed, and when she looked up she knew by the slanting rafters overhead that she
                  had been sleeping in a garret. She was conscious of halving overslept herself, for
                  the roof was already radiating upon her the rays of the morning sun. The air was
                  very close and oppressive, there being but two small windows at each end, too high
                  for the ventilation of anything but the angle of the roof. There was no furniture
                  in the room but old chests and boxes, and large bags, and a pile of feather beds,
                  with the hot down oozing through the worn tick, jammed under the eaves. Crissy
                  felt as sultry and uncomfortable as if one of those gushing feather beds were
                  pressed upon her breast. She got up and tried to look out of the window, but it
                  was too high for her reach. Then she was conscious of a soreness and aching in her
                  limbs, a heaviness and weight upon the brain, that made her want to lean against
                  something for support. The chill damp night-air in which she had been bathed,
                  followed by the stifling heat of the garret, had brought on a malady from which
                  she had sometimes suffered in her Southern home. She began to feel deadly cold.
                  Chill, shivering sensations went creeping up and down her back, while hot water
                  seemed splashing on her face. Her hands were like ice, and the blood settled, in
                  purplish darkness, under her nails. Presently her, teeth began to chatter like a
                  windmill, and, throwing herself back on the pallet, she delivered herself up to
                  all the horrors of a shaking ague. She had felt them before, but then she had
                  somebody to take care of her. Old Dicey would have her brought to her room, and
                  see that all kinds of warm possets were made for her relief. Jim always fussed and
                  pottered about her, bringing the supreme remedy, red pepper tea; and if it chanced
                  to be Sunday, he would stand by her bedside all day, smothering her with blankets
                  when the process of congelation was going on, or fanning her when the fever fit
                  was on her. Ildegerte too—how kind and sympathizing she was in sickness! How often
                  her soft, white hand, had bathed the negro's aching brow, or swathed her head
                     with<pb n="82-83" xml:id="VAC6695-00000043"/> cloths saturated with camphor and
                  cologne! Crissy remembered all these things in her lonely garret, with an
                  acuteness of anguish she had never felt-before. Then she began to recollect how
                  she came in that garret; how Mr. Softly landed her at night at the door of a
                  large, tall, dark-looking house; how he talked a long time with a large, somewhat
                  rough-looking man, while she stood weary and frightened at a little distance, not
                  knowing what they said, but certain that they were talking about her. Then she
                  recollected that a sullen-looking negro woman came with a light and told her to
                  follow her, and that she went climbing and climbing after her, till she reached
                  her present altitude. Mr. Softly had returned immediately in the boat, so she had
                  no opportunity of appealing to him, as she would gladly have done, for permission
                  to return to her deserted mistress. He had taken, every precaution to prevent such
                  a contingency. He had brought her by water, so that she could not trace her path
                  backward. He had given particular instructions to the master of the house not to
                  allow her any facilities for departure, advising him to take charge of her money,
                  of which he was assured she had a tolerable supply.</p>
               <p>It was very strange that Mr. Softly should have taken so much trouble about this
                  woman, that he should have carried her off so far, when she could have been
                  secreted so easily in some of the by-lanes and corners of a large city. But no
                  matter how secure was her retreat there, she could at any time wend her way back,
                  if she found her first draught of freedom dashed with bitterness. Mr. Softly had
                  no idea of allowing any such thing. She must be free! She should be free! It was
                     <emph>her</emph> duty to be so, whether she desired it or not. It was
                     <emph>his</emph> duty to make her so, in spite of her resistance and remorseful
                  scruples. If she was such a fool as to wish to remain, in bonds because she had a
                  pleasant home and kind mistress and security against future want, it did not
                  lessen the responsibility that rested on him. He was a liberator, and his system
                  must be carried out, let circumstances be what they might. Opposition only gave
                  energy to his purpose and fuel to his zeal. The very fact of Crissy's being
                  content with her lot and unwilling to change it, showed the depth of her misery
                  and degradation. It was that morbid insensibility, more frightful than the
                  extremity of suffering. So Mr. Softly said, and Mrs. Softly said, for it was a
                  shocking thing to them, that a person should presume to be happy in a situation in
                  which they had resolved she should be wretched. It was an unpardonable insult to
                  their judgment, an insolent defiance of their will.</p>
               <p>Crissy seemed to have risen above the recollection of the inmates of the house,
                  for no one approached her lofty attic, though the morning was rapidly advancing.
                  The cold stage of her disease had passed, and the burning and restlessness of
                  fever commenced. She would have given worlds for a drop of water, but there was<pb
                     n="84-85" xml:id="VAC6695-00000044"/> none near. Unable to endure the tortures
                  of this unquenched thirst, she sat up, dressed herself as well as she could, and
                  fumbled down the narrow stairway to a broad landing place, and there, several
                  diverging paths seemed open to her through various doors, but she was afraid of
                  going wrong, and stood looking on this side and that, trembling and irresolute. At
                  length one of the doors opened, and a pale, interesting, anxious looking young
                  woman appeared, poising a baby on her left hip, as if to rest her weary arms. She
                  stopped at the sight of Crissy, and rested herself against the broom-handle which
                  she held her right hand, while the baby, with four fingers and a thumb buried in
                  its mouth, fixed on the stranger its round, speculating eyes.</p>
               <p>"Please", missus," said Crissy, in a querulous, distressed tone, "please tell me
                  where I can get some water. I most done dead with fever."</p>
               <p>"Are you the runaway negro who came in the night?" asked the woman, with so
                  compassionate an expression of countenance that Crissy felt drawn towards her at
                  once. Yet she resented being called a runaway negro, and answered indignantly,
                  that she was no runaway, "she came in a boat."</p>
               <p>"Well, what did you come here for?" asked the young woman.</p>
               <p>Crissy stared upon her as if she did not know what she meant, then stammered—</p>
               <p>"Come here for, missus! To be free, I 'spose. Mars. Softly brought me. Don't know
                  nothing about the place."</p>
               <p>"You had better have stayed where you were, I suspect. Mr. Softly might be in
                  better business than filling our house with fugitive slaves. What a poor sickly
                  creature you seem! What in the world do you expect to do?"</p>
               <p>"I ain't sickly!" replied Crissy. "I only cotched a chill by being out on the
                  river at night. I'm smart as anybody when I'm well. I just wants water, missus, to
                  quench the fever."</p>
               <p>"Poor creature!" again repeated the young woman, "how hollow your cheeks are!"
                  adding with a sigh, while she led the way down another flight of stairs, "you must
                  have been dreadfully treated and abused, I know!"</p>
               <p>The baby was transferred to the other side by this time, and had another set of
                  fingers in its mouth, and all the way down stairs it kept throwing its head back
                  and rolling its round eyes up to Crissy, to whose sore and wounded pride even the
                  baby's scrutiny was painful. She had lost all her self-respect, and felt lowered
                  in the scale of being. To be called a runaway, a fugitive slave, a poor,
                  miserable, sickly creature, was an indignity she never expected to meet. What made
                  it harder to bear, was, that the young woman spoke compassionately, and had no
                  intention of insulting her. Her hollow cheeks! just the way Mr. and Mrs. Softly
                     talked.<pb n="86-87" xml:id="VAC6695-00000045"/> When she was at home, where
                  everybody was used to her, they never twitted her with her hollow cheeks. She
                  mentally resolved, that, before she started out to make the great fortune which
                  was hers in reversion, she would stuff them with cotton, and take away the
                  reproach of past unkindness on the part of her mistress.</p>
               <p>She was conducted to the kitchen, where the negro woman who had shown her the way
                  to the garret was making a clatter among the pots and kettles, preparatory for
                  dinner. Poor Crissy half emptied the water bucket, in her burning thirst, then
                  seated herself by the door, where the air could refresh her aching and feverish
                  frame.</p>
               <p>"Could you hold the baby for me, a few moments?" said the young woman, pressing
                  her hand wearily against her side. "She won't cry or pester you!"</p>
               <p>Crissy held out her arms for the child, who sprang rejoicingly into them, glad to
                  have a position where the balance of gravity could be preserved with less
                  difficulty. Crissy, as the little creature looked up innocently in her face and
                  smiled, thought of her own forsaken children, and the tears rolled, one after
                  another, in big drops down her dusky cheeks. The cook glanced obliquely upon her
                  from her iron battery, muttering something about the kitchen being no place for
                  lazy folks, whose room was better than their company.</p>
               <p>"She's sick, Holly!" said the young woman; "let her be. You must not speak cross
                  to her. There's enough beside you to do that."</p>
               <p>"Are you tired?" said she to Crissy; "I will come back soon."</p>
               <p>"No, no; I love to hold it. It takes away the lonesomeness from my heart,"
                  answered Crissy, looking wistfully in the face of the young woman as she left the
                  kitchen,—a face which, though pale and faded, had the traces of beauty and
                  symmetry. It was a face of sickly interest, and told of early disappointment,
                  sorrow, and debility.</p>
               <p>"Is that your missus?" asked she of the cook.</p>
               <p>"No—that she ain't. I hain't got no mistress. I'm my own mistress. Her daddy hires
                  me—Mr. Springer. That's young Miss Springer—his son's wife. Her husband killed a
                  man in a quarrel, and had to run off to Texas. That's what makes her look so down
                  in the mouth."</p>
               <p>Crissy felt a sensation of unspeakable relief in knowing the name of the people to
                  whom she was transferred. She learned, moreover, that Mr. Springer was an
                  architect, a master builder, who had a great many workmen under him, and that
                  everybody round and about him had to work. There were two women down at the spring
                  washing, but, as Holly said, "they couldn't begin to get through," and Crissy was
                  to help them wash and iron.</p>
               <p>"Mr. Springer gets a heap of work out of runaways,"<pb n="88-89"
                     xml:id="VAC6695-00000046"/> said Holly, with an air of conscious superiority;
                  "he's willing enough to let 'em come and stay a while, 'cause of the help they be
                  to him. But hi!—the way they have to work!"</p>
               <p>"He gives 'em wages, sure enough?" cried Crissy, whose heart sank lower and lower
                  with every word of Holly, till it felt heavy as the weight of a clock.</p>
               <p>"That he don't—not to the runaways. He just gives 'em a home and their vittles.
                  Now such as me won't work without wages. I ain't going to stay much longer,
                  though. The place is too hard. Heap ruther work for quality folks than mechanics:
                  ain't half as hard to please."</p>
               <p>Crissy, who had been brought up in the house as a waiting-maid, had never known
                  what hard work was. Her constitution was naturally slender, and had never been
                  hardened by labour or exposure. She was a neat seamstress, a nice, handy
                  attendant, and excellent nurse; but as for cooking, except dainties for the sick,
                  it had never been required of her, and washing and ironing had always been
                  considered too laborious for her.</p>
               <p>"I was never used to hard work," said Crissy, groaning at the prospect before
                  her.</p>
               <p>"What did you run away for?" asked Holly. "I 'spose they abused you. You look as
                  if you had seen hard times—and you ain't got through, either!"</p>
               <p>"Nobody never had a better massa and missus, in the world," exclaimed Crissy, with
                  a burst of feeling she could not repress. "They never gin me a cross word, alone
                  anything worse. No, no: nobody shall say nothing against them!"</p>
               <p>"Well, if you ain't the biggest fool I ever did see!" cried Holly, elevating her
                  tongs in the air, as if she were going to seize her by the nose; "what in the
                  world did you run off for?"</p>
               <p>"Mr. Softly made me. He and she both beset me, and said it was an awful sin to
                  live as I did, and that I'd make a great big fortin', and live like a fine lady,
                  and buy Jim and the children! Oh, Lord! 'spose I never see 'em no more!"</p>
               <p>Crissy squeezed the baby to her breast, and wept and sobbed outright. Where were
                  her golden castles now? All melted away, leaving the dross of disappointment, the
                  ashes of remorse. Where was the exulting sense of freedom, that was to bear her
                  up, as on the wings of an eagle, while the chains of bondage dropped clanking
                  below? A more helpless, forlorn, dispirited creature never existed than Crissy was
                  at this moment!</p>
               <p>"If you'd had a cruel master and mistress, that threatened to sell you and take
                  away your children, I wouldn't blame you for leaving 'em," said Holly, with
                  another flourish of her tongs; "but I could tell you, that freedom for poor black
                  folks ain't what it is to the rich white people. Some of us has to scuffle mighty
                  hard to get along, I can tell you. My master set me free when he died; but I've
                  seen a heap harder times<pb n="90-91" xml:id="VAC6695-00000047"/> since than I
                  ever done afore. I earn enough to git my vittles and clothes, and them was gin me
                  at home."</p>
               <p>Unable to endure" any longer the burning restlessness of fever, increased by the
                  agony of her mind, Crissy begged for a place where she could lie down,—anywhere
                  but that dreadful, lonely garret. Holly, who seemed to have more kindness than her
                  sullen countenance promised, pointed to a little room adjoining the kitchen, where
                  she said she could find a bed.</p>
               <p>Such was Crissy's introduction to the new home which Mr. Softly's philanthropy had
                  procured for her. But this was only the beginning of sorrows. The chill she had
                  caught on the river was the precursor of a bilious fever, which prostrated her for
                  many weeks, making her a burden on the strangers, who had received her for the
                  benefit of her labour. Mr. Springer, a hard-working, industrious man himself, who
                  had everybody up and doing at the dawn of day, and who estimated every one
                  according to their capacity for labour, was exceedingly angry at Crissy for being
                  sick, and at Mr. Softly for imposing upon him such a good-for-nothing, no-account
                  creature. He had trial enough already, in a sickly, moping daughter-in-law.
                  Sickness was, with him, van unpardonable sin. He had never known a day's illness
                  in his life, and thought, if every one was as industrious as he was, they would
                  have the same immunity from suffering. As day after day, and week after week,
                  Crissy lingered on her sick-bed, without out showing symptoms of amendment, he
                  became more and more incensed, and declared that as soon as she was able to walk
                  she should tramp, as he had no idea of having his house turned into a
                  lazar-house.</p>
               <p>Elizabeth Springer, whose own sorrows and waning health had taught her sympathy
                  and compassion, and whose heart was naturally gentle and kind, did all she could
                  to alleviate the sufferings of Crissy, and to shield her from the harshness of her
                  father-in-law. She had a pallet made for her in her own room; and, when she felt
                  well enough, the baby would sit by her, and play with her woolly locks, or stick
                  its chubby fingers in the cavities of her cheeks. Crissy conceived for Elizabeth a
                  grateful, enthusiastic attachment, second only to what she felt for Ildegerte. As
                  soon as she was able to sit up, she insisted upon taking charge of the baby, and
                  relieving the young mother of a care she was too feeble to sustain. But this was
                  an arrangement Mr. Springer had no thought of sanctioning. If she was able to sit
                  up, she was able to work,—and work she must, or go away from there. Things had
                  come to a pretty pass, if it took two women to take care of one baby.</p>
               <p>"She is too feeble to work, yet," said Elizabeth, in a mild, deprecating tone.</p>
               <p>"Well, let her take her choice, either to put herself to work to-morrow, or to
                  take herself off. She is as well and strong as anybody, if she has a mind to think
                  so."</p>
               <pb n="92-93" xml:id="VAC6695-00000048"/>
               <p>Crissy's only desire was to return to her forsaken mistress, and throw herself
                  upon her forgiving love. Her image, weeping, despairing, hanging over her dying
                  master, was for ever before her, a reproachful, haunting remembrance. She would
                  describe her to Elizabeth again and again, whose countenance expressed the most
                  vivid sympathy with her sorrows.</p>
               <p>"There's something worse than that," said the young woman, sighing; "something
                  worse than death. If I could weep over the grave of my husband, it seems as if it
                  would take away the dull, leaden feeling from my heart; but to know that he's
                  alive, and yet dead to me, suffering for other people's sins (for it was to save
                  his own life he took another's), yet talked about as if he were a criminal. Oh!
                  this is a heavy cross to bear!"</p>
               <p>Elizabeth was one of those sensitive, gentle beings, who, if placed in a genial
                  atmosphere, bloom with the fragrance and delicacy of the lily, but if exposed to
                  unkindly influences, droop and wither, with an untimely blight. Hers was a sad and
                  dreary home, without sympathy or love, without one flower of sentiment or beam of
                  joy. She had no female companion or friend on whom she could lean her weary heart,
                  and to whom she could unburden its bitterness and grief. Perhaps this was best. It
                  reconciled her to the prospect of an early grave. The wilted blossom falls of
                  itself to the earth. It requires not to be wrenched from the stem.</p>
               <p>Elizabeth has been drawn into our story by the stream of events, like a twig cast
                  into the water and drifted on its foam. We shall shortly leave her, and of her
                  after-history know nothing; but no one could look upon her pale, sad, and once
                  beautiful countenance, without feeling drawn towards her as Crissy was, pitying
                  her as a wanderer from her proper sphere.</p>
               <p>The next morning Crissy, summoning all the strength and resolution of which she
                  was mistress, went to Mr. Springer, and told him, as she was too weakly to do hard
                  work, she was going back to her mistress, and asked him to please give her the
                  money he had taken care of.</p>
               <p>The money! had not she spent that, and far more, for her board and medicine? Had
                  not she been a cost and a trouble, and then to have the impudence to come to him
                  for money! It is no wonder that he was angry, but Crissy had never thought of
                  herself as a boarder. She had been so accustomed to being taken care of, she
                  forgot she had no; claims on a Stranger's bounty. No matter! she could beg her way
                  back to the city. It was only ten miles. Beg! there would be no need of begging.
                  Elizabeth would give her food enough to last her, and she could inquire from house
                  to house the direction she must take. No one would deny her the privilege of
                  resting awhile, when she was too weary to go on.</p>
               <p>So, with her bundle on her head, and a little money, which Elizabeth insisted upon
                  her taking, in her pocket, Crissy, like the returning prodigal, prepared to
                     leave<pb n="94-95" xml:id="VAC6695-00000049"/> the husks she had been chewing,
                  and seek again the wheaten bread she had thrown away. She wept in parting from the
                  sad, gentle Elizabeth, and her innocent, smiling baby; even to Holly she felt
                  grateful, and of Mr. Springer's harshness she had no right to complain. Very meek
                  and humble and subdued was poor Crissy, when she started on her backward
                  pilgrimage, convinced, by her own experience, that, however glorious freedom was
                  in itself, it had proved to her the only slavery she had ever known.</p>
               <p>Her trials were far from being ended; for, enfeebled by long sickness, after
                  walking a few miles, she could hardly drag one weary foot after another. She was
                  obliged to stop and beg permission to rest,—and the rest proved long. She was
                  unable to resume her journey that day; the next found her too ill to rise; and
                  though she was fortunately thrown on the kindness of Christian people, who
                  administered to her necessities, she still felt the soreness and loneliness of the
                  stranger's heart; she still felt the humiliation of being the recipient of favours
                  to which she had no legitimate right. She overheard herself spoken of as a poor
                  runaway; and, as formerly, her master and mistress had to bear the reproach of her
                  thin, unhappy appearance.</p>
               <p>At last the wanderer reached the city, and crawled towards the hotel where she had
                  left her master and mistress. Would she find them both? Would she find either?
                  These fearful questions had been pressing upon her, forcibly and painfully, as she
                  came nearer and nearer her journey's end. Ashamed of being seen by the servants in
                  her present altered and forlorn condition, she entered the front door, and was
                  gliding up the stairs to the apartment of her mistress, when her eye was arrested
                  by the figure of Dr. Darley, walking up and down the passage. He saw her, and,
                  calling her by name, approached the place where she stood, clinging to the
                  banisters, a cold dew oozing from her forehead.</p>
               <p>"You need not go up," said he, sternly; "your mistress is not there."</p>
               <p>Crissy tried to speak, but she only gasped for breath. The doctor, seeing the
                  agonized expression of her countenance, added, more mildly,</p>
               <p>"You have come back too late. Your master has been dead many weeks. Your mistress
                  has gone back to her home; her brother came for her. Judy, your fellow-servant,
                  filled your vacant place."</p>
               <p>Crissy felt as if a dart were shot right through her heart. Gone, and she left!
                  Gone, and Judy with her!</p>
               <p>Throwing tip her hands, with a wild cry of despair, she fell forward with her face
                  on the stairs, perfectly insensible.</p>
               <p>Yes! Ildegerte was gone, and, faithful to her promise, took with her the ugly and
                  despised Judy. Moreland had made every endeavour to find the fugitive,—not with
                  any intention of forcing her to return, but to give her the opportunity, which he
                  had no doubt she by<pb n="96-97" xml:id="VAC6695-00000050"/> that time desired, of
                  being restored to her mistress, her husband, and her children. Being unsuccessful
                  in his search, he commended her to the kindness of Dr. Darley, should she happen
                  to cross the path of the benevolent physician.</p>
               <p>"Tell her," said Ildegerte,—her large, melancholy, but still lustrous eyes
                  suffusing with tears,—"tell her that I forgive her. I have not one bitter feeling
                  towards her. If she has found a happier home than I could give her, I rejoice. I
                  only wish I knew, so that I could tell her husband and children that she is happy.
                  Poor Crissy! she never could endure much hardship."</p>
               <p>The doctor promised to be faithful to the trust imparted, and he promised,
                  moreover, that in his professional rides in the vicinity of the city he would bear
                  the fugitive in mind, and endeavour to trace her footsteps.</p>
               <p>"Do not, I pray you, my dear sir," said he to Moreland, just before parting—"do
                  not go away believing our city is made up of Mr. and Mrs. Softlys. I assure you we
                  have as high-minded and noble-hearted citizens dwelling in our midst as can be
                  found on the face of the earth."</p>
               <p>"Believe me, doctor," answered Moreland, with earnestness and warmth, "one Dr.
                  Darley would outweigh in influence a thousand Softlys. I wish you would come and
                  see us, come and dwell among us, that we might have constant, daily communion. To
                  me it would be a source of immeasurable benefit, as well as happiness."</p>
               <p>"Thank you—I do intend to visit you. I am studying the diseases indigenous to the
                  South, and my path will lead me through the regions which you inhabit. I have
                  travelled much in the South; and being a, native of the North, and a dweller in
                  the West, it may be presumed that I could make fair comparisons and draw rational
                  deductions. The subject of slavery has been only secondary in my mind, and I have
                  constantly compared what I have heard with what I have seen. I heard that your
                  slaves slept like cattle, in hovels destitute of floors, with nothing but a
                  blanket to protect them from the damp, mouldy earth, being deprived, of the
                  comfort of beds. I found them the tenants of as comfortable cabins as our
                  respectable poor occupy, and almost every one adorned with a very ambitious
                  looking bed. I heard they were half-fed, half-clothed, miserable creatures, in the
                  most abject condition it is possible for imagination to conceive. I saw them fast,
                  sleek, good-natured, well clothed, and above all contented with their lot. I
                  cannot say but that there were some exceptions; but I speak of the general aspect
                  of things. I do not believe I ever encountered a misanthropist among the negroes.
                  Now, it is my deliberately formed opinion, that those who sow the seeds of
                  discontent and disaffection in their midst; who would deprive them of the comforts
                  which they really enjoy, without offering them an equivalent, are, under the garb
                  of friends, their most dangerous enemies. And the master who, actuated like<pb
                     n="98-99" xml:id="VAC6695-00000051"/> yourself by Christian principles, regards
                  them as members of his family, dependants on his care, considering himself
                  responsible for their physical and moral well-being, is their best and truest
                  friend. Forgive me for giving you a long and tedious homily, instead of the
                  friendly farewell that my heart urges me to utter. I have got a habit of
                  lecturing, and I do it unconsciously. God bless you, sir, and you too, dear young
                  lady. May the roses of the South once more bloom upon your cheek! We have had
                  many, many talks together. I do not expect you will remember them all; but if you
                  have gathered a few grains of wheat, in the midst of much chaff, may they bring
                  forth in memory a golden harvest."</p>
               <p>Dr. Darley <emph>would</emph> make rather long speeches, but no one thought them
                  too long while listening, and meeting the kind, smiling glance of his intellectual
                  beaming eye.</p>
               <p>Ildegerte did not attempt to speak the gratitude that filled her heart to
                  overflowing. The tears, however, which she abundantly shed, were more eloquent
                  than words.</p>
               <p>We will not describe, the homeward journey. It was sad; for they were accompanied
                  by one silent, voiceless traveller, who diffused around him a cold, mournful
                  atmosphere.</p>
               <p>It was the request of Richard Laurens that he might be borne back to the beautiful
                  groves of the South, and buried in their fragrant shades. Then, when his wife was
                  ready for the last deep, quiet sleep, she could come and lie down at his side, and
                  the same green covering would envelop them both.</p>
               <p>So, in a triple coffin, the body of the young husband was carried to the scenes of
                  his short-lived wedded happiness. And all the way the widowed Ildegerte could see
                  with the spirit glance, the marble face, shaded, by pale, golden hair, concealed
                  by the dark coffin lid.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER V.</head>
               <p>WE come to a new era in our history, and a new character, whose influence will be
                  felt during the remainder of these pages.</p>
               <p>A stranger, in a very plain, unpretending Jersey wagon, stopped at the gate of a
                  noble, pillared mansion. As it was a warm summer evening, the family, as is usual
                  at the South, were gathered in the portico, which, being elevated by a long flight
                  of granite steps, looked down upon the street, like the gallery of an
                  amphitheatre. It was a beautiful family group, and might justify the long and
                  earnest gaze of the stranger, while fastening his horse, preparatory to entrance.
                  As the individuals who composed the group were all old friends but
                     <emph>one,</emph> we will speak of them by name, as, with mingled curiosity and
                  surprise, they waited the approach of the stranger who had come in so humble an
                  equipage.</p>
               <p>"Does not that remind you of New England, Eula?" asked Moreland, with a smile.</p>
               <p>"The Jersey wagon? Oh, yes!" she answered, the quick colour rising to her cheek.
                  Perhaps he was a messenger from her own home. Did he come the herald of joy, or of
                  woe? The bare thought of the last turned to the whiteness of marble the dawning
                  rose-hue.</p>
               <p>Kizzie, who was walking the portico with a beautiful babe in her arms, while Effie
                  gambolled at her side, glanced contemptuously at the humble vehicle, and muttered
                  to herself—"He's no quality people. They don't ride in that style. I 'spect he's a
                  pedlar."</p>
               <p>Ildegerte, pale and statue-like in her black robes of widowhood, manifested not
                  the slightest interest or emotion. Her large, pensive black eyes passed beyond the
                  advancing figure, and rested on the golden clouds that lay cradled near the
                  setting sun. They looked as if they might be the throne of angels, and she
                  imagined she could trace, in their dazzling outline, one form reclining on a couch
                  of downy gold, whose pale amber hair made a crown of glory on his brow. But there
                  was one, who stood behind Ildegerte, who watched with suspicious glances the meek
                  stranger, who had now reached the lower step, which led up to the portico. Are we
                  mistaken, or is it indeed our old friend, Crissy, come back, like a wandering
                  sheep, to the fold? If it is, we verily believe she has stuffed her cheeks with
                  cotton, they look so much fuller and rounder than we have ever seen them before.
                  She must have been feasting on the fatted calf of welcome, and revelling in the
                  joys of restoration.</p>
               <p>Moreland met the stranger at the foot of the steps, and conducted him forward with
                  that courtesy which is<pb n="102-103" xml:id="VAC6695-00000053"/> the
                  distinguishing grace of the Southern gentleman. The stranger took a letter from
                  his pocket, and handed it to Moreland with an air of humility and meekness.
                  Holding his hat in his left hand, he smoothed back his long darkish hair behind
                  his ears with his right, while his eyes, riveted upon the floor, seemed to think
                  themselves unauthorized to gaze on the beautiful women before him, until permitted
                  by the master of the mansion.</p>
               <p>"You are welcome, sir," said Moreland, after perusing the letter. "The Rev. Mr.
                  Brainard, from the North," added he, introducing him to his wife and the other
                  members of the family. A bow of the deepest reverence and humility acknowledged
                  this hospitable greeting. Eula, whose heart warmed towards any one from her own
                  Northern regions, gave him her hand, and expressed her pleasure in meeting one
                  whom she could claim as a countryman. Perhaps he knew her father? Yes! he had the
                  pleasure of knowing Mr. Hastings. He had once been his guest since her departure
                  from Home, and had heard most affectionate allusions made to the absent daughter
                  and sister. He had seen her excellent mother, her studious, high-spirited brother,
                  and the little chattering Dora. This was sufficient to insure him the reception of
                  a friend, and his clerical profession was, of itself, a passport to respect.</p>
               <p>In a few moments Albert was seen mounted in state in the little wagon, whirling it
                  off to the stable with greater rapidity than it had ever known before. The
                  minister seemed somewhat shocked at the unministerial gait of his horse, and
                  looked anxiously after the animal, when, suddenly starting, he exclaimed—</p>
               <p>"My trunk, if you please, sir! I would like to have my trunk carried to my room. I
                  have very valuable papers in it—at least to me. To us poor labourers in our
                  Master's vineyard, notes and heads of discourses are more precious than bank
                  bills."</p>
               <p>The voice of the minister was very sweet-toned, and now that he had summoned
                  courage to raise his eyes and exhibit their colour, they were observed to be of a
                  clear, soft blue. There was something deprecating and appealing in their
                  expression, which excited the kind of interest which woman inspires. Moreland
                  assured him that his trunk should be cared for immediately, and begged him to feel
                  perfectly at home while he remained his guest.</p>
               <p>"Oh! how grateful to the weary stranger is a welcome like this!" he exclaimed,
                  lifting his soft, blue eyes with devout gratitude to heaven. "Thanks be to God for
                  his unspeakable goodness! When I approached this magnificent mansion, I did not
                  expect its princely owners would receive so kindly the wayfarer who entered their
                  gate. I have heard of Southern hospitality, but now I begin to experience, its
                  soul-cheering warmth."</p>
               <p>Aunt Kizzie, who had an unbounded veneration for<pb n="104-105"
                     xml:id="VAC6695-00000054"/> preachers, no sooner discovered that the stranger
                  belonged to the sacred order, than her contempt for the Jersey wagon was
                  forgotten. And when lie stretched out his arms towards the infant she so proudly
                  carried, and asked Eula, "if that beautiful babe were hers?" he was beginning to
                  storm the citadel of her heart. Yes! the crowning grace of maternity had humanized
                  the celestial loveliness of Eula. The infant boy, whom the minister now cradled
                  very gently and lovingly in his arms, was her own child, the first male heir in
                  the family of Moreland, the darling of the household, and the especial idol of its
                  father. Though not more than five or six months of age, a finer specimen of baby
                  humanity could rarely be exhibited, than the little Russell More-land, and he
                  possessed one of those serene and lovely temperaments which transform infants into
                  cherubs. With the innocent pride of a young and doting mother, Eula watched her
                  child as it perused with its pure hazel eyes the face of Mr. Brainard, with the
                  intentness of a physiognomist, and twisted its waxen fingers in his ministerial
                  locks.</p>
               <p>"Blessed art thou among women, and blessed be thy offspring!" said he, raising the
                  infant aloft, as if to bring it nearer the heaven he was invoking. Then, giving it
                  back to the exulting Kizzie, he stooped down to the black-haired fairy, seated,
                  for a wonder, quietly on the floor. She seemed engaged, like her little brother,
                  in physiognomical investigations, for her black eyes were sparkling on him through
                  her thick curls, like glowworms in a thicket.</p>
               <p>"Is this little girl also yours?" he asked, lifting Effie to his knee, who made
                  herself wondrously heavy, by sinking downward in proportion as he elevated her.
                  "It is not possible."</p>
               <p>"It is Mr. Moreland's child by a former marriage," replied Eula; and, in spite of
                  her efforts to prevent it, her whole face crimsoned.</p>
               <p>"Ah!" said Mr. Brainard, "its mother is dead, then! but it will never know the
                  want of a mother's care."</p>
               <p>Eula looked at her husband, but they both remained silent.</p>
               <p>"I am very fond of children," said he, trying to smooth back her rippling hair,
                  while she shook her head waywardly from side to side; "you and I must be better
                  acquainted, little lady."</p>
               <p>"I don't want to," cried Effie. "I don't like you."</p>
               <p>"And why, my darling, don't you like me? I have a little girl at home, who loves
                  me very much."</p>
               <p>"Your chin is too sharp, and your eyes are sleepy," said the child, sliding from
                  his arms, which involuntarily relaxed. "You are not like my papa, and we can't be
                  friends."</p>
               <p>The face of the minister grew very red at the little girl's criticism of his
                  features; but he smiled very pleasantly, and said he liked her candour. Eula was
                  shocked at Effie's rudeness; but there was an undaunted<pb n="106-107"
                     xml:id="VAC6695-00000055"/> frankness about the child, which she had vainly
                  endeavoured to bring under the discipline of politeness. As Mr. Brainard's profile
                  happened to be in a line with her eye, she was struck with the truth of Effie's
                  remark, for his chin <emph>was</emph> sharp and projecting, and he had a manner of
                  half-closing his eyes when he talked, which did not please the bright, wide-awake
                  child.</p>
               <p>At supper, when he asked the customary blessing on the board, he included, in an
                  especial manner, all the coloured members of the household,—a circumstance which
                  did not escape the appreciating ears of Aunt Kizzie. He seemed oppressed by the
                  attentions of the servants, received them with an apologetical look, and an air of
                  meek endurance, like one submitting his will to the bondage of custom.</p>
               <p>"Have you become reconciled to the South, Mrs. Moreland?" he asked of Eula, whose
                  fair face at that moment was relieved by the yellow countenances of Albert and
                  Netty, which shone on either side of her.</p>
               <p>"Far more than reconciled,—strongly attached," she replied.</p>
               <p>"Do you prefer it to your native North?"</p>
               <p>"That is rather a hard question; but I do prefer the lovely climate, that makes
                  the rigours of a Northern winter seem a cold dream. Then there is so much bloom
                  and beauty around me,—"</p>
               <p>"And wealth and luxury," he added, glancing, with a smile, at the richly furnished
                  apartment,—at the table, with its tea-service of the most delicate porcelain, set
                  off by accompaniments of massy, glittering silver; and then, more expressively
                  still, at the negroes in close attendance.</p>
               <p>"Yes," said Eula, looking gratefully at her husband, "I am not insensible to the
                  superior advantages of my present position. In the simplicity of my native home I
                  was content, and I trust I should have remained so; but I have had many, many
                  sources of enjoyment opened since, of which I never dreamed then.</p>
               <p>The vision of a dark, polished walnut table, set out with old-fashioned china,—of
                  an antique silver urn,—of a mother's mild, dignified countenance, reflected from
                  its mirror, passed before her, and moistened the dark, drooping lashes that shaded
                  her cheek.</p>
               <p>"It is astonishing," said Mr. Brainard, laying down his silver fork with
                  mathematical precision across his plate, "how soon one gets weaned from old habits
                  and associations. One would suppose," he added, turning to Moreland, "that my fair
                  countrywoman here had been born and bred at the South, instead of a simple New
                  England village."</p>
               <p>"She is filling the place for which she was expressly created," cried Moreland,
                  "therefore she falls easily and gracefully in it. She is at home
                  <emph>now.</emph>"</p>
               <p>"I shall visit her parents when I return, and tell them how happy she is."</p>
               <p>"I have told them so a thousand times already, with<pb n="108-109"
                     xml:id="VAC6695-00000056"/> my pen," exclaimed Eula. "I believe I have written
                  volumes; and I believe, also, I have removed already, prejudices which were once
                  thought insurmountable."</p>
               <p>The minister shook his head.</p>
               <p>"Your father's prejudices," said he, "are too deep-seated to be removed. They are
                  his principles, and their roots strike deep as life."</p>
               <p>Moreland seemed anxious to change the conversation, and started topics of general
                  interest. He did not know yet whether Mr. Brainard was the friend or enemy of the
                  South, by his ambiguous expressions.</p>
               <p>After supper was over, and Eula retired with the children, the gentlemen again
                  took their seats in the piazza, and Moreland drew his guest into an expression of
                  his object in coming among them.</p>
               <p>"I have come," said Mr. Brainard, after a long and confidential interview—"I have
                  come hither as an humble missionary, in the cause of my divine Master. The sphere
                  I have chosen is a lowly one, but I leave the mountain path to the high and
                  mighty. The narrowest by-path of the valley, so that I can trace there the print
                  of my Saviour's feet, is lofty enough for me. I have ever felt the deepest
                  interest in the poor benighted African. When I was a boy, I longed to plunge at
                  once into the wildernesses of Ethiopia and drag out some of the perishing wretches
                  who were doomed to the ray-less darkness of heathenism. I made a vow, that when I
                  grew to manhood I would devote my whole life to labours of love for them. As I
                  have told you, it seems to me that I can be most useful by preaching to those who
                  have become civilized and partly Christianized by slavery. It is true you have
                  preachers in your midst, who give them religious instruction; but it is a
                  secondary object with them. They have white congregations who have the first
                  claims to their labours. If they preach in the morning, to their own people, and
                  in the evening to the blacks, they do not carry to them the freshness and
                  earnestness of a first effort. They do not give them the firstling of the flock.
                  Whereas, a man who, like myself, devotes himself exclusively to them, must feel a
                  more burning zeal, a more concentrated desire for their salvation. If he have but
                  one duty to perform, he must do it more faithfully and conscientiously than when
                  his energies are turned into innumerable channels."</p>
               <p>"There is much truth in your assertions, sir," replied Moreland; "but we
                  Southerners are justified in preferring preachers educated among us to those
                  raised at the North. We do not wish to expose our institutions to the undermining
                  influences which you are well aware are at work against us. We are obliged to be
                  cautious, sir; for the agents of fanaticism are scattered over the length and
                  breadth of the land, and in the name of the living God endeavouring to destroy our
                  liberties and rights."</p>
               <p>The lamp suspended in the passage threw long streams<pb n="110-111"
                     xml:id="VAC6695-00000057"/> of radiance across the portico, and lighted up the
                  place where the minister sat, making a halo round his chair. He did not speak
                  immediately, but lifted his eyes upwards in silent appeal to Heaven. Moreland saw
                  this, and his conscience upbraided him for his suspicions.</p>
               <p>"lam not naturally suspicious," said he; "no man has more unlimited trust in my
                  fellow men than myself; but our dearest interests are at stake, and what is still
                  more, the union which the blood of our forefathers has for ever hallowed."</p>
               <p>"Far be it from me," said Mr. Brainard,—and his low musical voice dropped with
                  silver cadence on the ear of night—"far be it from me to encroach on your rights,
                  or to interfere with your peculiar institutions. All my desire is to preach Jesus
                  Christ, and Him crucified; to address the coloured race as sinners, not as slaves.
                  I think I have been blessed in my preaching to them. 1 think God anointed me with
                  his Holy Spirit for that one purpose. I came to you with letters of introduction,
                  in the hope of finding aid and encouragement from you. I was told you were a
                  Christian, and would eagerly embrace an opportunity of improving the religious
                  condition of a race, excluded by circumstances from the usual privileges of
                  education. Having wedded a Northern lady, I dared to think you would welcome, for
                  her sake, a brother from the New England States. You<emph>have</emph> welcomed me,
                  and I am grateful; but I want still more—your earnest, Christian
                  co-operation."</p>
               <p>"You shall have it," exclaimed Moreland, ashamed of his weak misgivings. "I will
                  introduce you to-morrow to some of the most influential religious persons in the
                  city, and I do not doubt you will find a cordial greeting. There is a very fine
                  church, belonging exclusively to the Africans, situated on a beautiful common,
                  quite aloof from all other buildings. There are also houses appropriated to negro
                  worship, near the churches of the various religious denominations. The Methodist,
                  however, is the predominant sect."</p>
               <p>"I am a Methodist, sir," said the minister, meekly.</p>
               <p>"I thought so," replied Moreland; "but that makes no difference, in my estimation.
                  I am an Episcopalian; my wife a Presbyterian. I have no sectarian feelings. George
                  Whitfield and John Wesley are great and glorious names. I honour them. Besides, I
                  think your peculiar style of preaching is better adapted than any other for their
                  warm and simple hearts. The demonstrations of enthusiasm, which a colder formula
                  represses, constitute the joy of their religion. They all expect to go to heaven
                  with shouts of glory and songs of victory, or never reach there at all. There is
                  no silent path for them."</p>
               <p>In the mean time the kitchen cabinet discussed the merits of the stranger
                  guest.</p>
               <p>Netty, who was young and giddy, and much given to<pb n="112-113"
                     xml:id="VAC6695-00000058"/> worldly vanities, was disposed to cavil at his
                  ministerial peculiarities, and indulge in witticisms at his expense.</p>
               <p>"I thought I should have died a laughing," said she, winking at Albert, her
                  professed admirer, "to hear Miss Effie tell him 'bout his sharp chin and sleepy
                  eyes. I had to pinch myself hard as ever I could to keep from busting out. I never
                  noticed afore, but 'tis as sharp as any razor, and turns up like the peak of
                  Albert's old boot yonder."</p>
               <p>"Ain't you 'shamed, Netty," cried Kizzie, in a tone of solemn rebuke, "to speak so
                  unrespectably of the Lord's anointed? Miss Effie's a child, and don't know no
                  better; but for grown folks there's no manner of excuse. He's a godly man and of
                  beautiful countenance, according to my appearance, and seems to have a great
                  respect for us coloured people. I tell you preachers is not to be lightly spoken
                  of. The Lord set the wild bears on the children, once, that mocked at their
                  blessed heads."</p>
               <p>"He's got a fine carriage, hain't he?" said Albert, throwing a roguish glance at
                  Netty over Aunt Kizzie's shoulder, "and a most beautiful horse—I expect it can go
                  at least a mile an hour! His trunk that he's so choice of, looks a thousand years
                  old, and the back of his coat shines like Aunt Kizzie's forehead. I mean to ask
                  master to let me give him one of my cast-off ones. 'Spose I do?"</p>
               <p>"Saucy boy!" exclaimed Kizzie, slapping him on the back, laughing, in spite of
                  herself, at his good-natured insolence; "you knows you're a favourite, or you
                  wouldn't presume the way you do. You'd better hush up among you. This gentleman's
                  come a purpose to preach to us black people, all over the world. I hearn 'em tell
                  massa so; and Mars. Russell say the doors of all the churches going to swing right
                  open and let 'em in. You'd better mind what you say. He got the Lord on his side.
                  You'll find it out."</p>
               <p>"Hope he ain't no wolf in sheep-skin!" said Crissy. "I seen 'em 'fore now!"</p>
               <p>Crissy quoted many a wise aphorism since her sojourn in the west.</p>
               <p>"S'pose he come to make us all free!" said Albert; "how you like that, Crissy?
                  When he asks you to tell your experience, give him a touch of Massa Softly,
                  Crissy."</p>
               <p>Crissy shrunk into herself, as she always did at Mr. Softly's name. It was
                  associated in her remembrance with disgrace and sorrow, and had given her a taste
                  for hard and harsh-sounding things.</p>
               <p>There was one member of the kitchen cabinet who generally kept in the background,
                  believing herself inferior to the rest—and that was Judy. At first she was looked
                  upon rather as an interloper; but her love for Ildegerte, which fell little short
                  of adoration, her willingness to bear the heat and burden of the day, and her
                  humble appreciation of herself, soon removed all<pb n="114-115"
                     xml:id="VAC6695-00000059"/> prejudice against her, and substituted in its stead
                  a cordial good-will.</p>
               <p>"Perhaps he come to tell us what de preacher did once in old Kentuck," said Judy,
                  rapping the ashes from her pipe; "de corn-field preacher he was, and had de pulpit
                  made out of de green pine boughs. 'Twas in de time of cotton picking, and we'd all
                  been working mighty hard. I tell you—ses he,—'Niggers, if you're faithful to your
                  masters and work to the top of your 'bility, neber lie, nor steal, nor run away,
                  dare's a great big cotton field up yonder, where you'll pick to all etarnity and
                  de basket neber git full. De field all white for de picking. De angels help pull
                  off de bolls.' Tinks I to myself, I'll let de angels pick just as much as dey
                  please for air Judy. She want to do someting else, if she eber get to heben.
                  Plenty of cotton to pick in dis world. 'Spect to pick gold up yonder."</p>
               <p>The silver tinkling of a little bell was heard, and Judy started to her feet.</p>
               <p>"Dat's Miss Ilda's bell!" said she, eagerly; but before she could obey its
                  summons, the lighter-footed Crissy was half-way up stairs.</p>
               <p>"Dat's de way!" said Judy, taking up her pipe; "neber can keep up wid Crissy!
                  Neber mind! She got de best right, I 'spose! Judy's too ugly to wait on de
                  beautiful young ladies in dis house! better keep her place in de kitchen! tink dat
                  de Paradise a'most!"</p>
               <p>The evening of the following Sunday, Mr. Brainard preached in the African church
                  to an overflowing audience. The Northern stranger, passing through the city, would
                  naturally ask what handsome brick building occupied so conspicuous and commanding
                  a site on that smooth, grassy common. Green blinds protected its numerous windows
                  from the sun, and formed a refreshing contrast with the pale red of the walls. The
                  interior of the church was finished with great simplicity and neatness. The
                  ceiling was of spotless whiteness, and the area around the pulpit handsomely
                  carpeted. Astral lamps illuminated the altar, and shed a soft, moonlight radiance
                  on the dusky faces, upturned with solemn reverence to the new messenger of
                  salvation looking down upon them. Is that a congregation of slaves, that
                  well-dressed, fashionably-attired audience? There is the rustle of tissues, the
                  fluttering of muslins and laces, the waving of feathery fans, the glitter of
                  jewelry, mingling with the white gleam of the ivory, seen through the dark, parted
                  lips. Certainly, a more decorous, reverential, waiting, listening throng never
                  gathered in a sanctuary, to witness the "stately steppings" of God's mighty
                  spirit.</p>
               <p>Moreland stood near the door, anxious to hear the first sermon of the Northern
                  missionary. Never had he found it so difficult to form a decision upon the
                  character of a stranger. At one moment he was strongly attracted, at another as
                  strongly repelled. Sometimes he thought him one of those holy, self-sacrificing
                     beings<pb n="116-117" xml:id="VAC6695-00000060"/> who, in the ancient days of
                  persecution, would have gloried in the burning stake, the flaming crown, and
                  shouted amid the agonies of martyrdom. Then, again, he imagined there was
                  something sinister and insidious about him, and the soft closing of his blue eye
                  reminded him of the slow sheathing of a shining weapon. Whenever he was conscious
                  of such a feeling he would shake it from him, as he would a worm that crept
                  stealthily over him, shocked that, for a moment, he could give admission to
                  thoughts which he contemned and despised.</p>
               <p>Now, as he looked upon him, with the length of the aisle between them, his
                  countenance lighted up with the pale yet dazzling lustre of the mimic moonlight,
                  and the sharp outline of his features thus softened and subdued, his long brown
                  hair parted with an apostolic wave and flowing back from his temples, he seemed an
                  admirable personification of the text—</p>
               <p>"Beautiful on the mountains are the feet of him who bringeth good tidings, who
                  saith unto Zion, Thy God reigneth."</p>
               <p>He commenced in a low, clear, and sweet voice, and in a calm, dispassionate
                  manner. He told them that he was a stranger, come among them to do them good,—that
                  he had left the comforts and endearments of home for the love of their precious
                  souls,—that he asked not for silver or gold, nor for praise nor fame; all he
                  wanted was the willing spirit, the listening ear, and the believing heart. A faint
                  groaning sound was the response to this exordium. Then gradually he kindled into
                  deeper fervour, and made those startling appeals to the imagination which the
                  negro never hears unmoved. Had little Effie been present, she would not have
                  accused him of looking <emph>sleepy</emph> then. His eyes flashed like the
                  lightnings of heaven; his voice deepened into its thunders, and his arms swayed at
                  the bidding of his stormy eloquence. The negroes began to shout and clap their
                  hands in an ecstasy of ungovernable emotion. Many of them prostrated themselves at
                  the foot of the altar, and grovelled there in tears; others shrieked "Glory!
                  glory!" till the walls resounded with the hosannas, and they rolled forth on the
                  breezes of night.</p>
               <p>Moreland scarcely recognised the meek, humble traveller of the Jersey wagon, in
                  the wildly splendid orator of the evening. Surely it was the inspiration of
                  religion! It could be nothing else. He felt borne along himself upon the fiery
                  waves of his eloquence. He did not wonder at the excitement of the congregation.
                  By and by, the minister came down from the pulpit, and knelt by those prostrate
                  and weeping at the altar. He addressed them in low soothing accents, ever and anon
                  bursting forth into snatches of sacred melody, and gushes of holy song. He went
                  down the aisles and grasped the sable hands eagerly extended towards him, giving a
                  fervent "God bless you, my brother!"—"Joy be with you, my sister!" as he passed
                  along.</p>
               <p>There were many white men present that night who<pb n="118-119"
                     xml:id="VAC6695-00000061"/> went away deeply impressed with the eloquence of
                  the preacher. He received the most urgent invitations to address his white
                  brethren, also; but he quietly, though firmly refused. He had marked out his line
                  of duty, and would not swerve from it. In consequence of this refusal, the African
                  church was crowded almost to suffocation whenever he preached, till at length he
                  was compelled to come forth under the canopy of heaven, and beneath the moon and
                  the stars, and the stilly, falling dews, to scatter the fiery sparks of his
                  eloquence, till the multitude kindled and glowed like a blazing prairie.</p>
               <p>Peculiarly susceptible as are the Africans to religious impressions, it is not
                  strange that a general revival was the result of Mr. Brainard's exertions. Even
                  Albert and Netty were prostrated before him, in the depths of
                  humiliation,—believing that he held the golden keys of Paradise in one hand, and
                  in the other the iron ones that open the gates of despair. No more laughter and
                  light talking about the old horse, and the shining coat, and the worn-out trunk.
                  Indeed, the coat was replaced, by a handsome new broadcloth one, the gift of
                  Moreland; and, when he rode abroad, Moreland's elegant carriage and fine horses
                  were at his disposal. Well might he say that his lines had fallen in pleasant
                  places.</p>
               <p>It was not, however, in a city well supplied with ministers, that Mr. Brainard
                  wished to locate himself. It was on the plantations that he thought he should find
                  the most abundant field for his labours, where the privileges of religion were
                  less abundantly enjoyed. The preacher whom Moreland and an adjoining planter
                  jointly employed was at this time disabled by sickness from fulfilling his duties,
                  and Moreland offered the situation to Brainard, in whose piety he had now" the
                  most implicit confidence. The offer was gladly accepted, and in a short time he
                  was to be installed in his new office.</p>
               <p>It was astonishing how he had ingratiated himself with every member of the
                  household. He seemed to have found the avenue to every heart but Effie's, who
                  experienced one of those instinctive dislikes which children sometimes conceive,
                  and for which they cannot account. In vain he coaxed and caressed her, offered her
                  sugar-plums and candy; she would shake her elfin, locks, pout her red lips, and
                  elude his detaining arms.</p>
               <p>"You are very wrong, Effie," Eula would say; "Mr. Brainard is very kind, and takes
                  a great deal of notice of you, for a little girl. It is not lady-like,
                  either."</p>
               <p>"I don't want to be a lady, mamma," the child persisted in replying; "and I don't
                  want Mr. Brainard to love me. I don't want him to touch me, and I can't help
                  it."</p>
               <p>He had completely won the heart of the young mother by his devotion to her
                  beautiful boy. He would dandle it by the hour, sing it sweet lullabys, or toss it
                  in his arms till its infant laughter rung like silvery bells on the<pb n="120"
                     xml:id="VAC6695-00000062"/> air. He dwelt on the pride and delight with which
                  she would exhibit her infant to her parents and Northern friends, in her
                  contemplated visit home. He expatiated on the noble and generous qualities of her
                  husband; on Ms humanity as a master, his devotion as a friend, on his manly,
                  Christian graces, till her heart glowed, like the disciples at Emmaus, when their
                  master was talking.</p>
               <p>To the widowed and sorrow-stricken Ildegerte he was an angel of consolation. He
                  conversed with her of her departed husband, of his present glorified state, of the
                  divine communion she was to enjoy with him hereafter, in terms of such sweet,
                  exalted rapture, his breath seemed to fan the drooping wings of her spirit, and
                  winnow fragrance from the fluttering plumes.</p>
               <p>One day while he was sitting with Eula in the parlour, and Effie was playing in
                  the passage—</p>
               <p>"That child, "said he, looking at her through the open door, "is a very remarkable
                  one. She requires the most watchful and tender guardianship, as well as the
                  firmest and most unshaken discipline. Happy is it for her, since death has
                  deprived her of a mother's care, that the void has been filled by one so fond to
                  cherish, so faithful to watch over her as yourself."</p>
               <p>"She was not derived of her mother by death," replied Eula, with burning cheeks.
                  She felt a strange reluctance to allude to the unhappy circumstances of her
                  husband's first marriage, but her reverence for truth was paramount to it.</p>

               </p>
               <p>"Ah!" he exclaimed, in an accent of surprise. "Indeed!" he repeated, "It must have
                  been, then, by something still more sad—by sin!"</p>
               <p>Eula bowed her head, oppressed by the humiliation of another. Mr. Brainard seemed
                  grieved, shocked beyond expression. He walked up and down the room with agitated,
                  steps. His emotion appeared so much greater than the occasion justified, that Eula
                  looked at; him with surprised and questioning glance</p>
               <p>"My sister," said he, addressing her with the affectionate freedom customary with
                  the disciples of Wesley, "forgive me for exhibiting feelings which are perhaps
                  unwarrantable; but I am so pained, so distressed at this disclosure, I cannot
                  conceal my anguish. Is it, can it be true that you have married one who has been
                     <emph>divorced?</emph>"</p>
               <p>Eula, struck with consternation at the stern emphasis on the word
                     <emph>divorced,</emph> turned of ashy paleness. She felt all that it implied
                  and a cold, sickening sensation crept slowly over her. But immediately her pure,
                  womanly feelings, deeply wounded, came; to her aid, and enabled her to lift her
                  eyes to the face of the minister.</p>
               <p>"I know not why you express such horror at this communication," she said, with
                  dignity. "It certainly is not an unexampled case. I married with the sanction of
                  my parents, sir. One of the best and holiest of men, a minister of God, with the;
                  full knowledge of every circumstance, pronounced over me the nuptial
                     benediction<pb n="122-123" xml:id="VAC6695-00000064"/> tion. I cannot say but
                  what it has been to me a source of regret and sorrow; but I expect some thorns in
                  a path clustering with roses. Why do you speak as if I had committed sacrilege? I
                  do not like to be the object of such exaggerated emotion."</p>
               <p>She rose and was about to leave the room, when Brainard interposed himself between
                  her and the door.</p>
               <p>"I cannot suffer you to depart in anger, my sister," said he, in the gentlest and
                  most persuasive tones. "The expression was involuntary, and cannot be recalled. I
                  have very peculiar views on that subject. I understand my Bible differently from
                  most men. I have never, in my sacred office, admitted such an union; and hence my
                  start of irrepressible surprise. But far be it from me to question the authority
                  of those whose sanction you quote. I am a man like them, of frail and fallible
                  judgment, and I may be wrong. In my deep interest for your happiness I may have
                  overstepped the bounds of propriety. Forgive me; forgive a too ardent, too
                  impulsive nature!"</p>
               <p>"I have nothing to forgive," said Eula, "though much to regret. If your peculiar
                  views implicate in the slightest degree the honour of my husband, whose
                  irreproachable life is known to all; if they would sacrifice his happiness to a
                  false and shadowy idea, there can be no congeniality in our sentiments, no
                  Christian fellowship or sympathy. I wish to be alone, that I may recover the great
                  shock you have given me."</p>
               <p>"Alas!" exclaimed the minister, clasping his hands and looking upwards; "by
                  overmuch zeal I have offended. What have I done! and what can I do to atone for my
                  indiscretion?"</p>
               <p>"Think no more of it," said Eula, touched by his sorrow, and ashamed of her
                  resentment; "I will try to forget this painful interview, and remember only our
                  previous acquaintance."</p>
               <p>"You will not speak of it to your husband?" asked he, anxiously. "I would not for
                  the world have him suppose I encroached on his hospitality by interfering with the
                  sacred privacy of his domestic relations. He might consider it unpardonable; and
                  his displeasure would be a millstone in the way of my duties."</p>
               <p>Eula promised silence and left him, bearing an arrow in her bosom, which she tried
                  in vain to draw out. The idea that any act of her life should cause a Christian
                  minister such ineffable grief and horror, however involuntary its expression, was
                  agonizing. Perhaps others felt the same, though politeness or hypocrisy led them
                  to concealment.</p>
               <p>We do not like the hackneyed expression of angel, as applied to woman. In the
                  common acceptation of the term it means nothing; and yet there are some beings so
                  different from the grosser multitude, so apparently etherealized from the alloy of
                  earth, we must distinguish them by some epithet, indicating a higher degree of
                  purity and refinement than usually belongs to womankind<pb n="124-125"
                     xml:id="VAC6695-00000065"/> kind. The word <hi rend="i"/>seraph would better
                  express their heavenly attributes. No one could look upon Eula without feeling he
                  was in the presence of one of these pure and holy intelligences, which, though
                  clothed in humanity, receives from it no pollution, but rather imparts to it its
                  own celestial nature, Her eyes, like stars shining in deep waters, brought down
                  heaven to earth, and discoursed of celestial things. Though a wife and mother, she
                  retained the expression of child-like, virgin innocence, which gave her the
                  similitude of a vestal in the white-robed village choir; and this expression was
                  the mirror of her soul. Eula was still a child in heart, in simplicity, purity,
                  innocence, and confiding faith in the goodness and truth of those around her.</p>
               <p>If Brainard had studied her character for years, and studied too a refined and
                  Subtle poison, that would prey slowly and surely on its sensitiveness and
                  delicacy, he could not have applied it more successfully. What a pity that the
                  godly man, in his too fastidious piety, should have inflicted as keen a pang as
                  the utmost art of malice could have invented! She cherished no resentment against
                  him; it had died away with the breath that expressed it; but the look, the start,
                  the shudder were never forgotten. She was too artless, too ingenuous to be able to
                  disguise all that she felt; and when she met her husband he noticed the shadow on
                  her brow, though the smile trembled on her lips.</p>
               <p>"Are you not well, my Eula?" he asked, with anxious tenderness.</p>
               <p>"Perfectly so," she replied, and the colour rose at once to confirm the truth of
                  her words.</p>
               <p>"Something has happened to disturb you. Some little pebble has ruffled the sunny
                  lake. Have the servants troubled you? Has Effie been unusually wayward?"</p>
               <p>"Oh, no!"</p>
               <p>"Perhaps you sigh for your Northern home; a little while, my dear wife, and we
                  will behold it once more. Next summer it will be three years since I transplanted
                  you to our Southern bowers. Then you shall revisit your native scenes, and carry
                  our beautiful boy, as one of the noblest specimens of the products of our sunny
                  clime."</p>
               <p>He took the smiling infant in his arms, and caressed it with all a father's
                  fondness.</p>
               <p>Effie, who had glided in unperceived, for her motions were as quiet and noiseless
                  as a bird's, wrapped her little arms round his knees, and said, in that sweet,
                  endearing tone which contrasted so bewitchingly with her wild waywardness,</p>
               <p>"You don't love me, papa, as well as you do little brother."</p>
               <p>The truth of this artless reproach struck home to the heart of Moreland. He never
                  could forget that Effie was the child of Claudia, her resemblance to her was<pb
                     n="126-127" xml:id="VAC6695-00000066"/> too painfully striking; and, though he
                  struggled with the feelings awakened by this association, they still existed, and
                  the child knew it. But his boy-baby, Eula's infant, came to him a cherub from the
                  gardens of the blest,—pure from all unhallowed remembrances, fresh with promises
                  of future joy. How could he help loving it better than the only remaining pledge
                  of his first unhappy love? At this moment, however, the doors of his heart seemed
                  to swing open suddenly, to take in the little fascinating being clinging to him
                  with such childish earnestness, and looking up to him with such a bright, begging
                  look. Bending down, he took her up with one arm, and the two children were cradled
                  in one embrace. Eula was touched by this scene. She had made use of every effort
                  to equalize his affection for his children; but the dread canon of the Almighty
                  would be obeyed. The sin of the mother was visited upon her offspring, and the
                  outraged husband became inevitably the alienated father. Eula remembered this in
                  her interview with Mr. Brainard, and it barbed the arrow his words winged into her
                  bosom.</p>
               <p>Her own affection for Effie was very deep and strong. The surprising alternations
                  she exhibited, the dark shades, the brilliant lights, kept her in a constant state
                  of solicitude and interest. Then her quick intelligence, her eager, thirsting
                  desire for knowledge, her reaching after things unknown, her grasping at the
                  invisible links that bind matter and soul together, furnished an unfailing ing
                  subject for her mind and heart. In trying to teach Effie something of the great
                  mystery of life, of the nature of the Deity and her solemn relationship to Him,
                  she learned much that seemed unknown before, and was drawn by this child of clay
                  to more intimate communion with the Glory of Glories, whose ineffable essence she
                  daily sought to explain.</p>
               <p>"This is as it should be, my husband," said she, gazing on the charming
                  family-picture before her, with moist, approving eyes; "never again justify a
                  reproach like that."</p>
               <p>"We will take Effie with us on our Northern tour," said he, "and show them an
                  embryo daughter of the sun. Poor Nancy!—I would she were alive to welcome us. I
                  have preserved the faded flowers she left upon my pillow, as a memento of her
                  grateful affection."</p>
               <p>"Poor Nancy!" repeated Eula, with a sigh,—"yes! she is gone, and her aged mother
                  still lives. Yet why do I say, poor Nancy! Surely the bosom of her Saviour is a
                  happier resting-place than her couch of suffering, Through poverty, sickness, and
                  pain she has passed, I doubt not, into glory and bliss."</p>
               <p>"How strange!" continued Eula, and she wandered in thought through her far native
                  vale, "how strange and varied are our destinies! How little did I think, when I
                  first met you in Nancy's cottage, that I should be your wife—that I should take,
                  as it were, the wings of the morning, and fly to this distant clime! And I<pb
                     n="128-129" xml:id="VAC6695-00000067"/> have left those behind who will
                  probably never see the sun set beyond their native horizon, and the same trees
                  which shaded their cradle of infancy will bend over theft-graves. Those lilac
                  bushes near Nancy's window! Do you remember them? Methinks their sweet oppressive
                  odour weighs upon my senses now!"</p>
               <p>"Our magnolias are sweeter still," said Moreland. "You do not regret being borne
                  away on those morning wings—do you?"</p>
               <p>"Regret!" repeated she, "never—even if—" she stopped, hesitated, and turn
                  pale.</p>
               <p>"Even if what, Eula?"</p>
               <p>"Nothing," said she, hastily; "but of one thing be assured, if all my future life
                  were dark and dreary, I could not regret the unutterable happiness that has once
                  been mine."</p>
               <p>Moreland looked at his wife earnestly, and the conviction that she concealed some
                  feeling from him, that she had some latent source of disquietude, pained him.
                  There had always been such perfect confidence, such a transparency of thought
                  between them, that a film, light as the gossamer's web, was distinctly seen.</p>
               <p>"Perhaps," thought he, "it is one of those faint clouds that often arise between
                  the soul and God. Brainard has been sounding the depths of our hearts, and
                  stirring the stagnant waters. She has been brought by self-examination into close
                  communion with her Maker, and even she, pure and holy as she is, must shrink
                  before Him, into whose presence the archangels come with veiling wings."</p>
               <p>Thus he explained her thoughtful, pensive mood. Suspicion might glance in his
                  breast, but, like the dart from tempered steel, it turned aside without
                  entering.</p>
               <p>In the evening, just about twilight, when the family were gathering in the
                  portico, Eula looked round for Effie, who generally came bounding up the steps at
                  that hour, either tricked out with flowers, or bearing them in her apron, making
                  flowery litter in her way.</p>
               <p>"Where is Effie?" asked she, of Kizzie, who, since the advent of young Master
                  Russell, had relaxed a good deal in her surveillance of little missy.</p>
               <p>"I saw her in the garden about an hour ago," was the reply; "you know, missus, she
                  e'ena'most lives there."</p>
               <p>This statement was corroborated by Netty, who was sent immediately into the
                  garden, where the shrubbery was high and dense enough for a host of children to
                  hide in.</p>
               <p>"She is playing hide and go seek with the butterflies, I dare say," said Moreland.
                  "She is the most fearless child I ever saw, and would willingly walk abroad at
                  midnight, were she permitted."</p>
               <p>The return of Netty without Effie excited some surprise, but not much alarm; but,
                  when a general search was instituted through the house, kitchen, negro cabins,
                  when voices had become hoarse calling upon her name,<pb n="130-131"
                     xml:id="VAC6695-00000068"/> and ears ached with the intensity of listening in
                  vain for a reply, then apprehension grew into torture, and the wildest, most
                  painful conjectures were formed. She was not in the habit of running into the
                  neighbouring houses, yet messengers were despatched to all, to return without
                  tidings of the missing one.</p>
               <p>Moreland, who, for the first time that very morning, had allowed his parental
                  feelings to gush forth towards the child in a full, unobstructed stream of
                  tenderness, was distracted with anxiety. It was now dark, and every place had been
                  searched but <emph>one,</emph>—that was the deep well in the back yard, scooped
                  out in the shadow of a giant oak. There was a deep curb around it—so high that
                  Effie's raven ringlets could just drip over the mossy edge. Moreland snatched a
                  torch from one of the negroes, who were rushing about the yard with blazing
                  lightwood flambeaux, exploring every nook and corner, and bent over the dark
                  abyss, but he saw nothing save a spot of inky blackness in the centre, that seemed
                  at an interminable distance, and narrowed almost to a point. The water was very
                  low, so that, by descending, the bottom could easily be sounded.</p>
               <p>"Hold your torches over the well, and light me as I descend!" he exclaimed,
                  throwing off his coat as he spoke, and tossing it on the arm of Albert.</p>
               <p>"My God!" cried Eula, who was looking down into the same fearful chasm—"Oh! my
                  husband, what are you about to do!"</p>
               <p>"Hinder me not, Eula, for God's sake! There is no danger: look at this triple
                  chain!"</p>
               <p>"Let me entreat you, Mr. Moreland," said Brainard, "not to do anything so rash. If
                  the child has fallen in, she must be drowned by this time. It is too late to save
                  her!"</p>
               <p>"If she is drowned, she shall not be left weltering there!" cried the father,
                  springing into the inside of the curb, and placing one foot on the edge of the
                  bucket, while he grasped the massy chain with both hands. "Let me down slowly,
                  steadily, Albert. Brainard, give him your help. Eula, turn away, if you love
                  me!"</p>
               <p>"Oh! master, don't—don't go down!—for Lord Almighty's sake—for dear missus'
                  sake—don't!" cried Albert, clinging to the arm he could reach with frantic
                  gestures. "Oh! dear master, let me go! I heap rather go than see you!"</p>
               <p>"Hush, my boy!" exclaimed Moreland; "take hold of this chain firmly and steadily:
                  now let me go!"</p>
               <p>"The negroes were half-frantic at the idea of their master's danger; but when they
                  saw his pale, resolute countenance slowly sinking below them, they pressed in a
                  dark ring round the well, and held their breaths, in awful apprehension. Eula
                  spoke not, moved not; but stood looking down, down, into that deep cold grave—for
                  such it seemed to her—and every time the windlass turned and creaked and groaned,
                  her heartstrings would strain and quiver and twist themselves in agony on the<pb
                     n="132-133" xml:id="VAC6695-00000069"/> wheel. Lower and lower he went down.
                  The gleam of the red torchlight played a moment on his dark hair, but the shadows
                  extinguished that; then it played on his white shirt-sleeves, which were at length
                  all that could be distinguished in the chill obscurity of the cavern.</p>
               <p>Slowly, steadily, Albert! Take care; the chain gives a sudden jerk, a horrible
                  clank, and the bucket rebounds against the rocky walls! It swings from side to
                  side; it rights itself at last! Now strain every sinew: thy master committed his
                  safety into thy hands—and such a master!</p>
               <p>Hark! hear that splashing sound! He has reached the water; he is searching in its
                  cold wave for his drowned child, but he finds her not! He gives the signal for
                  ascending. And now the wheel makes more rapid evolutions, in spite of the weight
                  that impedes its motions. The windlass creaks and groans, but the sound is less
                  doleful. The red torchlight gleams once more on a mass of dark-waving hair; a pale
                  countenance receives the ruddy illumination. At length the whole form is visible,
                  behind the massy glittering chain, which the white-clad arms are wreathed
                  around.</p>
               <p>"Eula!" he exclaimed, springing from the curb, and throwing his cold, dripping
                  arms round his wife, "Thank God, she is not there!"</p>
               <p>Eula gave a short, quick gasp, and fell forward on his bosom. She had fainted.</p>
               <p>The mysterious disappearance of the child, the danger to which the father had
                  exposed himself, the sudden fainting of Eula, circumstances so exciting in
                  themselves, were sufficient when combined to create indescribable confusion and
                  dismay. The negroes were perfectly beside themselves; tossed from one billow of
                  emotion to another with such frightful rapidity. Their mingled ejaculations of
                  "Oh! little missy!" "Oh! my massa!" and "Oh! Missus!" accompanied by sobs and
                  wringing of hands, were quite heart-rending. Even old Dicey came tottering from
                  her cabin to join in the general bewailing. Ildegerte, the moment she saw her
                  brother spring upon the well-curb, had rushed into the house, and throwing herself
                  upon her knees, awaited in loneliness and silence the issue of the awful
                  moment.</p>
               <p>"Oh! let me not look on death again!" she cried,—burying her face in her hands, as
                  if to shut the appalling vision from her view,—"I've seen it all terribly dyed in
                  blood,—terrible must it be, in the dark, whelming waters!"</p>
               <p>She was not, however, doomed to look on death; but its semblance, in the pallid
                  face and insensible form of Eula, which Moreland bore into the hall. The swoon,
                  however, was of short continuance,—Eula' recovered to mourn for the lost and
                  rejoice over the spared. Little Effie was almost forgotten, while the lives of
                  Moreland and Eula were endangered; but now her claims to remembrance asserted
                  themselves with new<pb n="134-135" xml:id="VAC6695-00000070"/> power. There was no
                  clue to thread the labyrinth of conjecture, in which thought was lost. Had Claudia
                  been in the vicinity, it might be supposed that she had stolen her from her home;
                  but she had been absent during the past year,—gone to Italy, her mother's native
                  country,—and, it was said, never to return. When silence had settled down on the
                  stormy emotions of the household, and they were all gathered in the hall, where
                  Eula lay extended on a couch, the low, sweet voice of Brainard uttered the simple,
                  solemn words,</p>
               <p>"Let us pray."</p>
               <p>With a simultaneous movement they all knelt, while Brainard poured out his soul in
                  the fervour of intense devotion. Like frankincense rising from a golden censer,
                  his prayer arose, and the air seemed perfumed with the odours of heaven. He prayed
                  to Him who was once a babe in the manger, who took little children in his arms and
                  blessed them, to watch over the missing lamb, and bring it back in safety to the
                  fold. Every one was comforted, and, though no trace of Effie was discovered, they
                  looked forward with hope to the morrow.</p>
               <p>The morrow came, but not the lost one. Messengers were despatched into the
                  country, far and near; advertisements inserted in every paper, with offers of
                  munificent reward; placards were put up in the most conspicuous parts of the city,
                  but no tidings came of the lost child. The last time she was seen, like the lovely
                  Proserpine in the vale of Enna, when borne off by the terrible Pluto, she was
                  gathering flowers, and twining them in garlands, probably for her sweet mamma, as
                  she always called her lovely stepmother. The withered wreaths were found trailing
                  in the garden walks, as if suddenly thrown down. Eula bedewed them with her tears.
                  Wherever she turned, she saw something that reminded her of the pet, the fairy,
                  the darling of the household. There was a waxen doll, lying on one side, with one
                  arm amputated, and one blue eye fearfully gouged, witness of Effie's destructive
                  propensity,—and, on the other, innumerable gilded playthings, scattered in
                  glittering profusion, and mingled with faded blossoms.</p>
               <p>Had the child sickened and died,—had they laid her down in the quiet grave, and
                  seen the green turf heaved up over her clay-cold breast, they would have wept, it
                  is true; but submission would have arisen from the dread certainty of death. But
                  the fearful incertitude of her fate caused a gloom deeper than the dark flapping
                  of the funeral pall.</p>
               <p>One day, Albert came in with Effie's little white muslin sun-bonnet in his hand,
                  no longer white, and all torn with thorns and stained with green; yet, still it
                  was recognised as hers. He had found it swinging from the bough of a low tree, in
                  the woods skirting the road that led to the plantation, several miles from
                     town.<pb n="136-137" xml:id="VAC6695-00000071"/> Here was fresh food for
                  conjecture. The child could not have wandered so far by herself. The Indians no
                  longer lurked in ambush, among the deep pines, for the capture of helpless
                  innocence. The wild beasts of the forest no longer prowled in the wilderness to
                  seek whom they might devour. There was a half-crazy, half-idiot negro in the
                  city—but this was a thought too horrible—it was crushed in the birth. The
                  plantation had already been searched; indeed, everything possible had been done,
                  yet no gleam of light had illuminated the obscurity that shrouded her fate.</p>
               <p>"Would you be reconciled to her loss if her own mother had claimed her—supposing
                  an impossible case?" asked Brainard of Eula.</p>
               <p>"No!" replied she, shuddering at the recollection of Claudia's ungovernable temper
                  and stormy passions. "I believe her death would cause me less sorrow. If dead, she
                  is in the arms of her Saviour,—but with such a mother, such an example, she would
                  live alone for misery and sin."</p>
               <p>"And yet," said Brainard, thoughtfully, "nothing can cancel a mother's claims to
                  her child, She has bought it by sufferings known only to her God, and no human
                  laws can annul her sacred rights. The beasts of the fields and the fowls of the
                  air vindicate the demands of maternity with the most terrible ferocity,—and shall
                  we deny to human affection what we yield to the instinct of brutes?"</p>
               <p>"Do you think it wrong, under any circumstances, to withhold a child from its
                  mother?" asked Eula, remembering Claudia's agonizing supplications for her child,
                  which she had resisted with such a painful effort.</p>
               <p>"I do!" replied the minister. "I am sorry you asked me the question, for the
                  answer may wound your feelings; but truth is omnipotent. I have told you that my
                  views do not conform to the common code of laws and morals. I think I can see the
                  hand of God stretched out in retribution, in snatching this idol from your arms.
                  It was not yours. You had no legitimate claim to it, and He who gave it to the
                  bosom that yearned over it, with nature's strong desirings, has taken it to
                  Himself, that He may confirm, His immutable justice and sovereign will."</p>
               <p>Again Eula felt the barb of the arrow, and she pressed her hand involuntarily on
                  her bosom.</p>
               <p>"Forgive me, my dear sister!" said he, kindly and soothingly. "You are too
                  sensitive. I would not for the world accuse you of voluntary wrong. You have been
                  the victim of circumstances, and your affections have triumphed over the decisions
                  of judgment, My object is not to give you pain, but to reconcile you to a just and
                  irrevocable decree."</p>
               <p>Eula spoke not to her husband of this conversation with Brainard. Judging of his
                  feelings by her own, she knew it would give him pain, and probably excite his<pb
                     n="138-139" xml:id="VAC6695-00000072"/> displeasure against the minister, whose
                  opinions condemned his conduct.</p>
               <p>It was singular, but, with all her reverence for Brainard's talents, zeal, and
                  piety, she never entered his presence without an uncomfortable and oppressive
                  feeling. She was dissatisfied with herself for her coldness and inward recoiling.
                  She did not like to meet the glance of his soft blue eyes, which always fell
                  instantaneously before the beam of hers, neither did she like to see them raised,
                  as they so often were, in silent appeal to heaven. She hated herself for all this,
                  but she could no more help it than the instinctive throbbing of her heart. Ever
                  since his arrival (and he had been domesticated with them several weeks), the
                  household seemed changed. The servants, carried away by their religious
                  enthusiasm, hurried over their duties, or performed them with a less willing
                  spirit. She could hardly refer to any particular violation of obedience or
                  respect, yet she felt a change. But, as usual, she blamed herself, rather than
                  others. Perhaps she was becoming selfish and exacting. She would watch herself
                  more closely, and beware of self-indulgence and captiousness.</p>
               <p>One evening, after supper was over, and she had, as usual, retired to the nursery,
                  she found the baby restless, and, as she imagined, feverish and unwell. She did
                  not feel well herself, and waited, in some anxiety, the coming of Kizzie from her
                  supper. When she entered, the clean, starched white apron and bright headkerchief
                  denoted a preparation for going out. Brainard was to preach; but he did so every
                  evening, and Eula thought it would be imposing no hardship on Kizzie to detain her
                  at home, especially as Moreland was absent.</p>
               <p>"Did you think of going to church to-night, Kizzie?" she asked. "Little Russell is
                  so unwell I would rather you would not leave me. I have a bad headache myself,
                  also."</p>
               <p>"La, missus! there is nothing the matter with him, just wakeful; that's all. He'll
                  go to sleep directly"</p>
               <p>"I do not feel able to take care of him to-night, Kizzie. I want you to stay."</p>
               <p>"Won't Netty do, missus? I 'specially anxious to go this time. Mars. Brainard
                  going to the plantation soon. There's to be great preaching to-night. Every
                  'vidual will be there but me."</p>
               <p>"Netty has no experience, and I am sure the child is sick; but you may go if you
                  cannot willingly remain. I will try to take care of him."</p>
               <p>Her heart swelled and choked her words. She was not willing that Kizzie should see
                  how much she was wounded by her reluctance to fulfil a positive duty. She might
                  have commanded her to stay; but her natural gentleness restrained the exercise of
                  just authority. Pressing her baby to her breast, she bent her cheek to its velvet
                  one, and tried to hush its unwonted cries. Her lip quivered, and a tear dropped on
                  the infant's warm temples. She was very childish—but Kizzie had<pb n="140-141"
                     xml:id="VAC6695-00000073"/> always seemed so self-sacrificing, so devotedly
                  attached to her and the child, she could not help feeling distressed.</p>
               <p>"If you insist on my staying, missus," said Kizzie, folding her fat fingers over
                  her waist, without offering to take the child, "of course I'll give up the
                  preaching. But maybe it'll cost me my soul, missus. I feel kinder awful to-night.
                  The Sperrit tells me I oughtn't to stay, when I might git the blessing."</p>
               <p>"Go, then, Kizzie, and say no more about it."</p>
               <p>"I'll send Netty."</p>
               <p>"I don't wish Netty. I had rather be alone."</p>
               <p>She spoke falteringly, impatiently, and Kizzie turned to the door. She laid her
                  hand lingeringly on the latch, hesitated a moment, then opened and closed the
                  door, and Eula was left alone with her infant.</p>
               <p>"What is the reason," thought she, walking backward and forward the length of her
                  chamber, for she was too much agitated to sit still, "what is the reason, that
                  ever since this man has been here, I have felt my happiness insensibly diminish?
                  What is the silent, invisible influence he is exerting, that is so fatal to my
                  peace? He has gradually assumed the empire of the household, and making us
                  secondary agents in it. Would he had never come among us! And yet, how wicked I am
                  to breathe such a wish! Surely he is a man of God! What motive but pure,
                  evangelical religion could induce him to devote his splendid talents to such a
                  lowly cause? The very incident which has so deeply wounded me, is only a proof of
                  his Christian influence! How selfish I am, to grudge poor Kizzie this little
                  gratification! Oh! how often has my own dear mother rocked me, a weeping infant,
                  in her arms, when there was no one near to relieve her of the burden of care. Lie
                  still, my darling baby; hush, my own little Russell!"</p>
               <p>But the little Russell would not lie still; he writhed in her embracing arms; and
                  the more she caressed the more bitterly he cried. At length, very weary with her
                  vain efforts to soothe him, she seated herself in a rocking chair, and began to
                  sing that sweet cradle hymn, that holy lullaby, which has been so often breathed
                  over the couch of infancy: <q>
                     <lg type="quotation">
                        <l>"Hush, my dear, lie still and slumber,</l>
                        <l rend="ti-1">Holy angels guard thy bed;</l>
                        <l>Heavenly blessings without number</l>
                        <l rend="ti-1">Gently fall upon thy head."</l>
                     </lg>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>As the charming voice of the young mother warbled in the ear of the child, its
                  meanings ceased, and looking up in her face, it smiled with that heavenly
                  sweetness of expression never seen save on the lip of infant innocence. Ah! where
                  is the mother who is not repaid for a thousand pangs by one such angelic smile? It
                  passed away, however, as quick as a sunbeam, and was succeeded by a feverish
                  restlessness that defied all her soothing arts. Never had Eula spent so weary an
                  evening. She would not call on Ildegerte for aid. She<pb n="142-143"
                     xml:id="VAC6695-00000074"/> had the natural pride of wishing to bear her own
                  peculiar trials. She wanted Kizzie to see, when she returned, how much trouble she
                  had caused. She wanted her to feel sorry for having left her.</p>
               <p>By and by, when her arms drooped with their burden, and refused to sustain it any
                  longer, she laid the child in the cradle, and kneeling by it, continued to sing
                  another verse of the divine song— <q>
                     <lg type="quotation">
                        <l>"Soft and easy is thy cradle;</l>
                        <l rend="ti-1">Coarse and hard thy Saviour lay—</l>
                        <l>For his birth-place was a stable,</l>
                        <l rend="ti-1">And his softest bed was hay."</l>
                     </lg>
                  </q> Again that heavenly smile. Then the beautiful, innocent eyes gently closed,
                  and, like stars withdrawing behind a white, fleecy cloud, grew dim in slumber.
                  Eula, fearful of disturbing him by rising, slid from her knees in a reclining
                  position on the floor, and still keeping one arm around him, lay with her head
                  bending over him, watching his gentle breathing. In this attitude she
                  unconsciously fell asleep herself; and thus Moreland found her when, having
                  transacted the business that called him away, he returned to his home.</p>
               <p>He paused by the cradle to contemplate the beautiful picture, so dear to a
                  husband's and father's heart. The light, subdued by its crystal shade, fell with
                  moonlight softness on the slumbering pair. The cheeks of the infant were flushed
                  with a deep rose bloom; the mother's as fair and spotless as the petals of the
                  lily. The hair of Eula hung loose and floating over the side of the cradle, and
                  swept the floor in bright hazel waves. Her attitude was the perfection of reposing
                  grace, though it expressed weariness and self-abandonment. He thought of the
                  virgin mother and the infant Jesus; and holding his breath as he gazed, continued
                  to drink in their beauty, till his whole soul was steeped in tenderness and
                  delight. Then he wondered at finding her thus alone with the child, evidently
                  overcome with watching and fatigue; and kneeling down by her, he put his arms
                  round her, and raised her from her recumbent position.</p>
               <p>"Eulalia, my Eula," he cried, "why do I find you thus? You should not recline on
                  the floor, with the night-air flowing in on every side."</p>
               <p>It was some time before she could rouse herself to a consciousness of her
                  situation; then she smiled, and explained the cause of her uneasiness.</p>
               <p>"You should not have permitted Kizzie to leave you," said he. "I shall not allow
                  this to happen again. I fear they are all taking advantage of your mildness and
                  indulgence. But I shall prevent any future encroachment."</p>
               <p>"Do not blame Kizzie. I told her she might go. It is my fault entirely. If the
                  baby had slept, I should not have missed her. Mr. Brainard is going away, you
                  know, and the same temptation will not occur again."</p>
               <p>"Yes, he goes to-morrow, I believe, and I do not regret it. I would not like to
                  have this excitement continue<pb n="144-145" xml:id="VAC6695-00000075"/> tinue
                  much longer. The imagination of the negro is so powerful, that when it once gains
                  the ascendancy, it is almost impossible for reason to exercise the least sway. I
                  have no doubt that Kizzie believed her soul would be endangered by staying away
                  from that meeting to-night. Brainard is really a wonderful man. He has flights of
                  eloquence that bear the soul up to heaven itself. I do not wonder at all at the
                  hold he has taken of the susceptible and believing Africans. And yet, Eula,
                  strange as it may seem to you, I do not like the man. I feel a sensation of relief
                  in thinking of his approaching departure. I feel what our poor little lost Effie
                  so innocently, yet rudely expressed. I am conscious of an antagonism, for which I
                  cannot account."</p>
               <p>"Is it indeed so?" said Eula. "It is thus I feel, and reproach myself bitterly for
                  want of Christian sympathy and regard."</p>
               <p>"Well! it is strange; but as we feel alike, there must be some inexplicable cause.
                  Perhaps the attraction which draws him to the negroes, proves a repulsion to us. I
                  think he will do a great deal of good on the plantation; and as they are just now
                  destitute of a preacher, I could not possibly refuse his offered services. He says
                  he does not wish any remuneration; but of course I shall liberally reward him.
                  There is one thing of which I am assured: he has very just views of slavery, and
                  looks upon it, as it now exists, rather as a dispensation of Providence than as an
                  institution established by ourselves. He deprecates the mad zeal which would
                  involve by premature efforts our country in ruin, and condemns, without
                  reservation, the insidious attacks of those who endeavour to undermine what they
                  cannot openly destroy."</p>
               <p>"I have one consolation," said Eula: "whatever are my father's sentiments, he
                  glories in their avowal. If he be an opponent, he comes forth to battle in the
                  noonday. He never seeks the midnight shade."</p>
               <p>"You are right, Eula; your father is a manly enemy and a sincere one; an
                  unprejudiced one, I cannot say he is. It is one of the rarest things in the world,
                  to see a man who looks upon the differing phases of the social system with an
                  impartial eye. Dr. Parley is one. What a head, what a soul, what a heart he has! I
                  never think of him, without feeling my respect and admiration for mankind exalted.
                  Just as strongly as I was repelled by Brainard, at first sight, was I attracted to
                  Dr. Darley. It seemed as if my being became incorporated with his."</p>
               <p>"He is, indeed, a fascinating and remarkable man," replied Eula. "How kind it was
                  in him to take charge of Crissy, when he travelled South this spring; and how very
                  kind it was in him to find her a good and comfortable home during her stay in the
                  West! Then, what a friend to Ildegerte! I do not wonder that her reverence for his
                  character approaches to worship."</p>
               <pb n="146-147" xml:id="VAC6695-00000076"/>
               <p>Moreland and Eulalia were right. There are few such men as Dr. Barley; but, for
                  the honour and glory of humanity, there are a few such, who, even while walking
                  through the Sardis of this world, defile not the whiteness of their garments with
                  the slime of prejudice or the dark stains of passion.</p>

               <p>Nothing could exceed the enthusiasm which he inspired in the simple-hearted
                  community in which he was introduced. He told them that he had come all the way

                  up home and friends, fame, wealth, and honourable position, to claim brotherhood
                  with them, and preach to them of the riches of redeeming love. He told them that
                  he loved his white brethren; but far better he loved the dark and lowly
                  African,—loved him, because, like his Saviour, he was despised and rejected of
                  men, and there was no comeliness in him that men should desire him; that he had
                  come to distil the dews of divine love on the root of a dry ground, and make it a
                  green and blossoming plant, whose leaflets should reach into heaven. The negroes

                     xml:id="VAC6695-00000077"/> the Almighty, for the ransom of their souls. Every
                  night the log chapel was crowded, and the meeting kept up beyond the midnight
                  hour. The minister seemed incapable of fatigue. He rose with the dawn of day, and,
                  long after the negroes had retired to their cabins, his lamp glimmered through the
                  windows, or his figure was seen gliding beneath the shadows of the trees.</p>
               <p>The overseer, fatigued with the labours of the day, usually retired to rest at an
                  early hour, while Brainard assumed the responsibility of seeing order and quietude
                  established in the negro quarters. As he was invested with the sanctity of a
                  minister of the Gospel, and the authority of a man employed and recommended by the
                  master, he did not hesitate to confide in him with implicit trust.</p>
               <p>Brainard stood on an elevated platform, reminding one of a picture where a figure
                  is seen rising above a mass of dark-rolling clouds, he, the only point of light in
                  that black assembly. An unusual solemnity pervaded the audience. He had promised
                  them a sermon adapted to their own condition. He had promised to tell them of an
                  ancient people, whose lot resembled their own. Opening the Bible, he read, in a
                  voice of plaintive melody, the one hundredth and thirty-seventh psalm"—</p>
               <p>"'By the rivers of Babylon, there we sat down and wept, yea, we wept when we
                  remembered Zion.</p>
               <p>"'We hanged our harps upon the willows in the midst thereof.</p>
               <p>"For there, they that carried us away captive required of us a song; and they that
                  wasted us required of us mirth; saying, Sing us one of the songs of Zion.</p>
               <p>"'How shall we sing the Lord's song in a strange land?</p>
               <p>"'Oh! daughter of Babylon, who art to be destroyed; happy shall he be that
                  rewardeth thee, as thou hast served us!'"</p>
               <p>Closing the book and looking earnestly on the serious, upturned faces before him,
                  he began to describe, in simple, but expressive language, the sorrows of
                  captivity, the sad doom of the exile. He described the Babylonish slave, weeping
                  beneath the willow's weeping boughs, while his neglected harp-strings responded
                  only to the mournful gale. He painted him as writhing under the scourge of him who
                  carried him into captivity, and who, in mockery of his despair, called for songs
                  of joy and mirth, in the midst of desolation and woe. Having wrought up their
                  susceptible feelings, by an eloquence which they only partly understood, he
                  changed the scene to their native Africa, and carried them in imagination to the
                  green banks of the Niger, where the shadow of the lofty palm tree is reflected in
                  its clear dark waters. He painted the negro, not degraded, benighted, and imbruted
                  as he really is, in his native land, plunged in the lowest depths of sensuality
                  and heathenism, but wandering<pb n="150-151" xml:id="VAC6695-00000078"/> dering in
                  all the glory of freedom, in his beautiful tropic regions, the lord and king of
                  all the boundless wealth of nature spread out around him. Then he drew a thrilling
                  sketch of his being torn from his country and home, deprived of his glorious
                  privileges and lofty inheritance by the hand of rapine, and doomed to a life of
                  slavery and wretchedness. He paused not till he had created the wildest excitement
                  and confusion. Groans mingled with shouts, and sobs with loud hosannas. Uncle
                  Paul, who sat near the pulpit, though he made no boisterous exhibition of his
                  feelings, took in every word with breathless attention. He arose and drew as near
                  as possible to the platform. He seemed to be magnetised by the preacher, Every
                  time Brainard waved his arm in the energy of speaking, Uncle Paul waved his in
                  response. If he bowed his head to give emphasis to his words, Uncle Paul would bow
                  his likewise. The negro preacher was tall and brawny, and his large, swelling
                  muscles heaved visibly under his checked cotton shirt. His collar was left
                  unbuttoned, displaying the working sinews of his neck, and the grizzly beard that
                  bristled round his chin. His head was covered with a thick fleece of coal-black
                  wool, white as snow on the surface, but, whenever it parted, showing the hue of
                  ink. His forehead, retreated under this woolly thatch, like the slanting roof of a
                  building, while the flattened nose, large, spreading nostrils, ash-coloured and
                  protruding lips, opening on rows of strong, unbroken ivory, proclaimed the
                  legitimate son of Africa.</p>
               <p>When the congregation was dismissed, they gathered in knots round the door, to
                  talk about the wonderful sermon, and ask each other what it meant, and what was
                  going to follow.</p>
               <p>Paul stood just where he was in front of the preacher, gazing in his face and
                  waiting his every motion. When he descended from the pulpit, Paul walked by his
                  side to the door of the chapel. They went out together and walked in silence, till
                  they left the Enclosure bounded by the cabins, and entered a path that led into
                  the woods.</p>
               <p>"Massa preacher," said Paul, as soon as he thought they were out of the hearing of
                  the rest, "I want to talk with you. I can't go to sleep till I hear you 'xplain
                  some of the difficulties of my comprehension."</p>
               <p>"Wait, my brother, till we reach a more convenient place than this," answered
                  Brainard; "follow me, and I will make every difficult place easy, and every rough
                  one smooth."</p>
               <p>He threaded the wild-wood path, dark with the shadows of a moonless night, till
                  they came to a small opening, where the blacksmith's shop stood, isolated from the
                  other buildings of the plantation. Just behind it, a gnarled and blasted oak,
                  twisted off near its base by the whirlwind's breath, lay upon the earth.
                     Brainard<pb n="152-153" xml:id="VAC6695-00000079"/> seated himself on the
                  rough, knotted trunk, and motioned Paul to take a seat by his side."</p>
               <p>"No, massa," said the negro. "If you please, I'll stand just where I be. I want
                  you to tell me more 'bout that sermon, that's tingling in my ears as if someting
                  had stung 'em, I never hearn afore Africa such a great country. I thought this a
                  heap better."</p>
               <p>"My poor fellow!" exclaimed Brainard, "you have been brought up in ignorance and
                  deception. You know nothing beyond your master's fields, which you enrich by the
                  sweat of your brow. 'Born in bondage fettered, manacled, and enslaved, you are
                  made to drag out a hopeless, joyless existence, ten thousand tinges more degraded
                  than the beasts of the field, for the birthright of immortality is not theirs. Are
                  you a man, and willing to submit to this disgrace and shame; this outrage to
                  humanity; this robbery of your dearest, most sacred rights?"</p>
               <p>"Now, massa," said Paul, after a short pause, in which he could see the blue eyes
                  of Brainard glittering like burnished steel in the clear starlight, "I thought I
                  mighty well off till I hearn you say I ain't. I got a kind, good massa, that neber
                  said a thing he oughtn't to, nor did a thing he oughtn't to. He neber made me work
                  harder than my conscience telled me was right. He gives me good clothes, good
                  vittles, and never spited me in no manner of ways. When he was a leetle boy he
                  larned me how to read the Bible; and though he ben't a preacher, he can talk
                  beautifully from Scripter. He neber made me a slave; he neber bought me; he neber
                  will sell me. I was born on his grandfather's plantation. I belonged to his
                  father, and so slipped through God's hands into hisn."</p>
               <p>"That you have believed all this I cannot wonder," said the minister, in a
                  commiserating tone; "but the time is come when you must learn greater, better
                  things; when you must realize what you are, what you may be, and what you ought to
                  be. I am come commissioned by the Almighty, to teach you how to rend asunder the
                  iron chains of servitude, and secure the glorious privileges of freemen. I appeal
                  to you, because I see well that you are the most intelligent of the number I see
                  around me, and better capable of understanding me. If you choose you can be
                  free—you can make all your brethren free. Instead of being slaves, you can be men.
                  You have but to will it; the means are certain. You have friends at the North
                  ready to assist you, and place you upon perfect equality with themselves. I have
                  been labouring in your behalf, wherever I have been. I have been sowing broadcast
                  the seeds of freedom, that you may reap a golden harvest. Will you not put in your
                  sickle and reap, or will you lie, like a coward, on your back, and let the
                  ploughshare cut through your vitals?"</p>
               <p>"Oh, massa, you talk mighty grand, and I know you means right, and we ought to be
                  much obleeged for your thoughts and obligation of us; but 'spose, massa, we get<pb
                     n="154-155" xml:id="VAC6695-00000080"/> way off North, who's gwine to take care
                  of us and our wives and children?"</p>
               <p>"Take care of you!" repeated Brainard scornfully; "are you not a man, and cannot
                  you take care of yourself? Who takes care of <emph>us?</emph> Who takes care of
                     <emph>me,</emph> I want to know, in the name of the God who made me?"</p>
               <p>"Ah! but you got the head-piece, massa," touching a forehead that indeed showed
                  the absence of intellectual power. "God don't make everybody alike. He make some
                  for one thing, some for anoder. If he make massa to take care of me, and me to
                  work for him, why ain't that good? If I be satisfied, why not go to heaven the way
                  I started?—got halfway there 'ready, massa!"</p>
               <p>Brainard made a gesture of impatience, and crushed the dry twigs beneath his feet.
                  Then, with admirable patience and consummate eloquence, he continued to enforce
                  his arguments, and to stir up the quiet pool of contentment in the negro's mind,
                  into the troubled billows of disaffection. He talked till the midnight stars
                  flashed through the deepening blue of heaven,—till the wakeful mocking-bird was
                  hushed to silence; and Paul listened, like one awaking from a dream, wondering how
                  he could have lived so long, without knowing what a wretched being he was before.
                  It was not the policy of Brainard to startle him at first, by unveiling all his
                  designs; but he had taken the first step, and all succeeding ones would be
                  comparatively easy. He had been strewing a gunpowder train the length and breadth
                  of his journey, and waited the favourable moment to apply the kindling spark and
                  let the blazing track be seen,—a fiery serpent winding through the land!</p>
               <p>"And now, Paul," said he, rising from the gnarled trunk, and taking a Bible from
                  his bosom, "you believe in this holy book of God?"</p>
               <p>"Sartain, sartain!—blessed be the Lord!—I do."</p>
               <p>"Swear, then, over this sacred volume, never to speak of what I have this night
                  revealed to you, without my permission. By and by we will take others in our
                  counsel; but you and I must have many talks together, before we understand each
                  other; but, as sure as you are a man, you were created to be the instrument of
                  deliverance to your brethren, and a light to them that sit in darkness and the
                  shadow of death. Ages hence shall hear of Uncle Paul, and the sons and daughters
                  of regenerated Africa shall arise up and call him blessed! Here, take this volume
                  in your hand, and swear that death itself shall not wrest from you the secret of
                  this hour."</p>
               <p>The bewildered and awe-struck negro took the book, and reverently kissing it,
                  mechanically obeyed the bidding of the master-will, acting upon him with such iron
                  force.</p>
               <p>They then separated, and returned by different paths to their respective
                  dwelling-places. Uncle Paul was so absorbed by new and momentous thoughts, he did
                     not<pb n="156-157" xml:id="VAC6695-00000081"/> think that he was approaching
                  the graveyard, till he saw the white paling glimmering in the darkness, and he
                  felt the cold, fearful proximity of the dead.</p>
               <p>"Wouldn't go By there this time for all the universe," said he; "didn't I tell
                  massa, right over Dilsy's grave, I didn't want to be free? and ain't it the old
                  sarpent that's beguiling me? Wish I'd neber known I so bad off; wish 'twant a sin
                  to be satisfied with myself; wonder if the Lord did send Massa Brainard, sure
                  enuff?"</p>
               <p>Turning round abruptly, he retraced his steps, and circumambulated the woods, to
                  avoid the grave of Dilsy. He felt restless, unhappy,—he could not sleep. The next
                  day he could not work. Every few moments he would stick his spade in the ground,
                  and resting his brawny hands on the top of the handle, look fixedly on the earth,
                  as if trying to solve some great problem. Then he would rouse himself, shake his
                  head, as much as to say, "It won't do,"—and, renewing his labour, make the earth
                  fly under his plunging utensil. But at night, he was again under the magnetic
                  influence of Brainard, who at last found a spot in the negro's yielding heart
                  where he could place the lever of his strong will, and move him to his purpose.
                  The blacksmith,—a man black as his coals, and endowed with the strength and nerve
                  of Hercules, was next admitted to their midnight deliberations—another and then
                  another,—till, fed by numbers and inflamed by the mystery of their nocturnal
                  meetings, the elements of insurrection began to roar, in sullen murmurs, like
                  subterranean fires.</p>
               <p>That a man, gifted with the eloquence of Whitfield, the will of Napoleon, and the
                  perseverance of Peter the Great, should exercise a resistless influence over the
                  simple and credulous beings thrown so completely in his power, it is not strange.
                  The overseer suspected nothing, because <emph>religion</emph> was the watchword of
                  all their meetings, <emph>religion</emph> the cloak that mantled all their
                  designs. But he perceived a spirit of insubordination gradually stealing over the
                  plantation. There was sullenness and gloom, where, formerly, cheerfulness and
                  good-humour enlivened the labours of the field; and the merry laugh, the
                  spontaneous song no longer were heard in the evening twilight.</p>
               <p>In less than a fortnight after Brainard's first unwitnessed meeting with Uncle
                  Paul, a dusky form could be seen travailing by the burning forge, in the hush of
                  the midnight hour, with closed shutters, to exclude the ruddy beams from flashing
                  on the darkness of night. Rude swords and murderous weapons were shaped by the
                  swarthy artisan, from whose reeking brow the sweatdrops rolled upon the hot metal,
                  hissing as they evaporated. Then, by and by, the black Vulcan would steal forth,
                  and, removing a pile of dried underbrush and moss, crawl on his hands and feet
                  under the building, and deposit the hastily-wrought instruments in a dark cavity,
                  dug out, deep and narrow, beneath the forge.<pb n="158-159"
                     xml:id="VAC6695-00000082"/> Some old planks covered the aperture, and the moss
                  and underbrush concealed the place of entrance. Sometimes a white face gleamed
                  stealthily through the cautiously-opened door, and a low, sweet-toned voice
                  invoked the blessing of heaven on the sable workman.</p>
               <p>"Toil on, my brother—toil on, and faint not, for the day of redemption is at hand!
                  Think of Him who said 'I come not to bring peace on earth, but a sword.' Think of
                  Him who came in dyed garments from Bozrah, travelling in the greatness of his
                  strength, whose raiments were sprinkled with blood, who said 'The day of vengeance
                  is in my heart, and the year of my redeemed is come.'"</p>
               <p>It was thus, with burning words, more powerful because partially unintelligible to
                  the hearer, he set the negro's excitable imagination into a blaze of enthusiasm,
                  who went on toiling with ten-fold zeal, while his large eyes glowed by the flaming
                  forge, like, balls of living fire.</p>
               <p>It is not to be supposed that Moreland's plantation was the only scene of the
                  labours of the indefatigable Brainard. There was one about eight miles distant,
                  where he preached on alternate Sundays, and where the same dark scenes were
                  enacting. He had runners employed in travelling secretly from place to place,
                  giving constant information of all that was passing—shuttles of the loom of
                  abolition, weaving a web which should be the winding-sheet of the South. It was
                  now autumn, and the Christmas holidays were to witness the fruition of his
                  labours. He had ample time to work in, ample materials to work with, and
                  opportunity smiled most benignantly on his plans.</p>
               <p>Shall we look into the secret chambers of his heart, and try to discover the
                  moving spring of the complicated machinery at work there? Is he really one of
                  God's anointed ministers, or has he assumed the sacred name, as a passport with a
                  hospitable and unsuspecting people? Has he borrowed the snowy fleece of the sheep,
                  to clothe the gaunt limbs and hide the gnashing fangs of the wolf? Has Moreland
                  ever injured him, that he should come stealing and coiling himself secretly and
                  insidiously into the heart of his household, and endeavour to sting the bosom that
                  has warmed him? that he should throw' the brand of discord in his peaceful
                  plantation, and abuse the sacred trust committed to his keeping? Has the
                     <emph>South</emph> ever injured him, that he should seek to make its blossoming
                  fields and fragrant bowers, <emph>Aceldemas</emph> and <emph>Grolgothas,</emph>
                  furrowed with the ploughshare of ruin? Does he really think, with Saul of Tarsus,
                  when breathing fire and persecution against the Christians, that he is really
                  doing God and man service? We should like to ask him if he has no home, wife or
                  child of his own, no household gods to defend, no domestic penetralia to keep
                  sacred from intrusion. We think he talked to Eula of his fondness for his
                  children—of his own smiling offspring. We should like to ask him if he would
                     teach<pb n="160" xml:id="VAC6695-00000083"/> the hand of the assassin, where
                  the life-veins wore wandering in the bosom of his wife, or his bloody fingers to
                  twist in the shining ringlets of his child?</p>
               <p>Is he the leader of a confederated band, or a mere tool, a machine moved by the
                  will of others?</p>
               <p>Look at him! He is alone now in the room appropriated to his accommodation. It is
                  nearly three o'clock in the morning, and yet he is still awake,—seated at a little
                  table, and poring over the pages of that Bible, on which, with Judas kiss, Paul
                  had sworn to betray his kind and once beloved master. Ah I he must be a good man,
                  or he would not read his Bible so earnestly.</p>
               <p>But, perhaps he is studying passages to give sanctity and effect to his incendiary
                  addresses. Like Belshazzar, he may be purloining the golden vessels from God's
                  temple, to gratify his own unhallowed passions.</p>
               <p>There is one passage of Scripture on which his eye glances; then he hastily turns
                  over the leaf We wonder he does not commit it to memory, for it is a most eloquent
                  denunciation, The arrows of divine indignation are quivering in every word.</p>
               <p>"Woe unto you, Pharisees! for ye tithe mint, and rue, and all manner of herbs, and
                  pass over judgment and the love of God: these ought ye to have done, and not leave
                  the other undone.</p>
               <p>"Woe unto you, Scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye are as graves which
                  appear not, and the men that walk over them are not aware of them.</p>
               <pb n="161" xml:id="VAC6695-00000084"/>
               <p>Years ago, in one of the Eastern States, there was a boy, a very young boy, the
                  son of obscure and indigent parents, who, being convicted of theft, was immured in
                  the walls of a penitentiary. In consequence of his extreme youth, and the
                  remarkable talents he had exhibited at school, a petition, signed by some of the
                  most influential gentlemen in town, was sent to the governor, to mitigate his
                  sentence; and after one year's imprisonment he was released, with the felon's
                  brand on his youthful reputation. But the benevolent gentlemen who had manifested
                  so deep an interest in his fate, resolved to rescue him from the disgraceful
                  consequences of his first transgression, by giving him those advantages of
                  education necessary for the development of his uncommon genius. They sent him to
                  college, defrayed all his expenses, and exulted in the bright promise of his
                  future eminence. But the dark spot, for a time concealed, but never effaced, began
                  to spread. His sole ambition seemed to consist in deceiving and mocking the
                  judgment of those who had known him as a transgressing boy. Possessed of a
                  graceful carriage, a voice of rare and winning power, he never failed to
                  ingratiate himself with strangers, on whose credulity he wished to impose. Under
                  different names, he went from place to place, exciting admiration and commanding
                  attention even from the magnates of the land. Now he was a lawyer, keen in debate,
                  clenching in argument, eloquent in speech; now a young Esculapius, armed with
                     power<pb n="162" xml:id="VAC6695-00000085"/> to crush the Python, disease, in
                  all its hideous convolutions; again a minister of God, with the dew of Hermon on
                  his lips, and the music of David's harp flowing from his tongue. He seemed to
                  glory in detection, exulting over the dupes he had made. As adroit to escape the
                  consequences of his deception as he was skilful to deceive, he flashed, a
                  brilliant <foreign xml:lang="LAT">ignis-fatuus,</foreign> here and there, the
                  wonder and shame of his native regions. Destitute of principle, ready to lend
                  himself to any party, provided his momentary interests were advanced, always
                  anxious to enter on a new field of action, since it afforded a larger development
                  of his Machiavellian powers, would it be incredible if this felon boy, this
                  artful, unprincipled young man, and Thomas Brainard, now in the full meridian of
                  manhood, should prove identical? Who could be better fitted as an agent of the
                  powers of darkness, than one who had served so long an apprenticeship to its
                  Satanic Prince?</p>

               <head>CHAPTER VII.</head>
               <p>IT was a bleak, dull, cloudy, autumnal day. Moreland was travelling alone, a
                  dismal, solitary road. The oak leaves were brown and sere, partly strewed and
                  drifted on the ground, and partly quivering on the half-naked boughs. The pines
                  still wore their hue of perennial green; but the wind roared through their
                  rustling branches, like the voice of the surging waves, in melancholy gusts. The
                  road was one bed of sand, in which the horses' feet plunged to the fetlocks,
                  throwing up a cloud of dust at every step. Moreland was going on a sad errand, and
                  felt more than usually susceptible of the depressing influences of the lonely
                  scene and the withering season.</p>
               <p>He had received an unexpected summons that morning, before the breaking day. The
                  messenger was from the unhappy Claudia, whom he believed still in her mother's
                  native land. She had returned, was ill, the physician had pronounced her malady
                  incurable,—she wished to see him, if it were but one moment, before she died; she
                  entreated him to hasten his coming, lest<pb n="164" xml:id="VAC6695-00000087"/> it
                  might be too late. Could any one turn a deaf ear to such an appeal?—and, least of
                  all, could Moreland?</p>
               <p>It was terrible to be compelled to plough through those drifts of sand, when his
                  agitated and impatient spirit urged him on with lightning speed; but, perhaps it
                  was well that he had leisure for reflection. In reviewing his past life, he blamed
                  himself so much for having slighted the warnings of experience, and yielding to
                  the impulse of passion, that he felt only compassion for the wrongs he had once
                  believed beyond the reach of forgiveness. He felt how long and how bitterly one
                  might rue the consequences of one rash act. It was true, that he was legally freed
                  from the disgraceful connexion; but the scars, where the chain had galled and
                  corroded, would for ever remain on the heart. To exasperate and humiliate him, she
                  had remained where her influence could still be felt, her appearance awaken in
                  full force the memories of the past. He knew that Eulalia never thought of her
                  without anguish, as having made less honourable and holy the name of wife,—of his
                  wife. But she was dying now; and he could meet her as a fellow-sinner, whose only
                  reliance, like himself, must be on the mercy of the Son of God.</p>
               <p>Suddenly the sand disappeared, and the hardened soil assumed a deep red hue, that
                  contrasted richly with the dark-green pines. He proceeded with accelerated
                  velocity; but it was not until the close of the second day's journey that he
                  reached the place of his destination.<pb n="165" xml:id="VAC6695-00000088"/> It
                  was a lonely dwelling, situated at some distance from the main road, and densely
                  shaded in summer with the sweet-blossomed acacia, and the graceful China tree. Now
                  the only shade was a large and spreading live-oak, hung with festoons of gray
                  moss, that swept over More-land's head, as he passed under it, in long, weeping
                  garlands. Had they been wreaths of blooming roses, they would have had a funereal
                  seeming, at that gloomy moment.</p>
               <p>A light, subdued by muslin curtains closely drawn, indicated the chamber of
                  Claudia. Was that light shining on the struggles of departing life, or glimmering
                  on the cold, still couch of death? With an agitated hand he lifted the knocker,
                  which was muffled, then without suffering it to fall, he gently let it go, and
                  entered the house without calling a servant to the door. There was a light
                  streaming from the parlour, the doors of which were thrown widely open, showing it
                  to be unoccupied. Glad of an opportunity of composing his thoughts, he entered,
                  and throwing himself on a sofa, waited the coming footstep which he was sure would
                  soon approach. The reckless character of the mistress seemed stamped on everything
                  around him. The furniture was rich and showy, but its polish was dimmed with dust,
                  and the flies had left innumerable traces on the large gilded mirrors, hanging on
                  opposite walls. A harp, with broken strings dangling on the carpet, stood in one
                  corner; a guitar, in the same neglected plight,<pb n="166-167"
                     xml:id="VAC6695-00000089"/> was thrown carelessly in another. A piano, with
                  uncovered keys, and burdened with music books, confusedly piled together, stood
                  between two windows, whose curtains, gathered back into gilded shafts, contained
                  volumes of dust in their sweeping folds. Splendidly bound books, with the backs
                  loose and broken, lay scattered on a marble centre table, around a costly Etruscan
                  vase, filled with faded and shrivelled flowers. No well trained, neat, and
                  considerate servant, thoughtful of the reputation and comfort of her mistress,
                  presided in that neglected household. Moreland sighed bitterly, while the image of
                  his lovely wife, surrounded by an elegance and purity, which was but a reflection
                  of inward refinement and innocence, rose before him, rebuking the tawdry splendour
                  on which he was gazing.</p>
               <p>The sound of footsteps was heard in the passage, and voices speaking in quick,
                  passionate tones met his ear.</p>
               <p>"You <emph>shall</emph> go to bed, missy!"—it was the voice of a negro, harsh and
                  imperious. "I'm not going to be bothered with you up arter supper, gracious knows!
                  Come along, this minnit!"</p>
               <p>"I won't!—you ugly, cross old thing!" exclaimed a pair of very juvenile lips,—and
                  Moreland started from the sofa, with a sudden bound, while the pulsations of his
                  heart were wildly quickened. "I won't go to bed till I'm sleepy! Let go come, and
                  hush your big mouth!"</p>
               <p>Oh! Effie, is it indeed you, uttering this coarse, violent language?—you, in whose
                  little bosom Eulalia had transfused a portion of her own angelic sweetness? Is it
                  the cherub, whose loss she has so wept and bewailed, transformed into the
                  miniature vixen, who is now rushing by the door?</p>
               <p>"Effie, Effie!" Hark!—whose voice was that? With a galvanic spring, she leaped
                  forward, and, uttering a loud, shrill cry, fell into the arms opened to embrace
                  her.</p>
               <p>"Papa, papa!" she cried—bursting into hysterical laughter, mingled with tears—"oh!
                  papa, have you come for me?"</p>
               <p>She clung to him with passionate affection, and the eyes that so lately flashed
                  with defiance were swimming in liquid softness. Moreland's heart yearned over his
                  restored child, with indescribable. tenderness. In the rude burst of passion,
                  which had shocked and pained him, he perceived the influence of her unhappy
                  mother, and he pitied far more than he blamed. Her person was neglected and
                  changed. Her dress was soiled, and carelessly put on; her thick, clustering curls
                  tangled, and devoid of lustre. What would Kizzie say, to see her darling thus?</p>
               <p>"Is your mistress better?" he asked of the negress, who stood staring in at the
                  door, with a sullen, dogged expression of countenance.</p>
               <p>"Just as bad as can be!" was the uncourteous reply.</p>
               <pb n="168-169" xml:id="VAC6695-00000090"/>
               <p>"Tell her Mr. Moreland is here," said he, and the girl turned from the door.</p>
               <p>Effie's quick, glancing eyes followed her movements. The moment she was out of
                  sight, she said,</p>
               <p>"Take me home, papa; I don't love to stay here! Take me to my dear, sweet, other
                  mamma! How came I to have two mammas?" she added,—knitting her brows, and looking
                  earnestly in his face,—"when I don't love and don't want but one?"</p>
               <p>"We have been very unhappy about you," said he,—without answering her last
                  perplexing question,—"we feared we should never see you again. I little thought to
                  find you here."</p>
               <p>At the return of the black girl, Effie drew back with such instinctive repugnance,
                  Moreland was convinced she must have been very harshly if not cruelly treated by
                  her. He could not help frowning, as he rose to follow her.</p>
               <p>"Mistress says you mustn't come," said she to Effie, who immediately began to make
                  a show of resistance; "she says you must mind me, and go to bed, right off."</p>
               <p>"You <emph>must,</emph> Effie," said her father, in a tone, of authority, which
                  subdued her at once, for, sliding from his arms, she stood with an air of
                  submission by his side. Lightning is not quicker in its flash than the transitions
                  of feeling in the breast of Effie. "Speak another harsh, insolent word to this
                  child at your peril," he added, in a low but distinct voice to the girl, when they
                  reached the door of Claudia's apartment. "Leave me."</p>
               <p>He paused a moment on the threshold, while Effie walked quietly away with her
                  surly conductress, looking back wistfully at every step; then opening the door
                  with noiseless touch, he found himself in the presence of her who had once been
                  his wife. She lay on a low couch, in a half-reclining position, supported by
                  pillows, not more colourless than her face. How ghastly white it looked, gleaming
                  from amid the purplish blackness of her hair! Her eyes, so large, so black, so
                  wildly, painfully brilliant, were riveted upon him with such burning intensity,
                  they seemed to scorch while they gazed. He was not prepared for such a fearful
                  change. He felt cold, faint, dizzy, and his face turned nearly as pallid as her
                  own.</p>
               <p>"You have come; yes, you have come," said she in a quick, panting, husky tone. "I
                  ought to thank you, but I have no time for idle words. You see I am dying. I have
                  often prayed for death; but I did not know what it was,—no, no, I did not know
                  what it was!"</p>
               <p>"Oh! "Claudia!" he exclaimed, with a burst of irrepressible emotion. It was all he
                  could utter. He seemed hurled back, with a violent wrench, over the chasm of
                  years, to the moment when, in the splendour of her girlish bloom and beauty, she
                  had fascinated his young imagination. He saw that radiant, graceful figure, the
                  goddess of the ball-room, side by side with<pb n="170-171"
                     xml:id="VAC6695-00000091"/> the pale, emaciated, reclining shadow—the sad
                  mockery of life; and he shuddered and groaned at the contrast.</p>
               <p>"I don't want you to pity me," said she, a softer expression nevertheless passing
                  over her face; "it will do no good. An ocean of tears could not save me now from
                  the grave that yawns black and cold before me. I did not send for you because I
                  wanted your compassion, or even your forgiveness. I have suffered you to believe a
                  lie. After I am dead, I do not wish you to think of me as worse than I really am.
                  The crimes imputed I would not deny, because they reflected shame and misery on
                  you. In my hatred and revenge, I felt willing to sink down to the lowest abyss
                  myself, provided I dragged you with me, the sharer of my disgrace. But, on the
                  word of a dying woman, the accusations brought against me were false. For my after
                  career, I am responsible to no one. I make no confessions: I ask no
                  absolution."</p>
               <p>Moreland was too much shocked to reply. Whatever joy he might feel at the avowal
                  of her innocence, was deadened by the knowledge of the bitter and revengeful
                  motives which had so long withheld it.</p>
               <p>"You do not speak to me! You do not believe me!" she cried, in an impatient, yet
                  exhausted tone, a dark fire kindling in her eyes.</p>
               <p>"Yes, Claudia, I do believe you; but let the past be forgotten in the
                  contemplation of the future. Time is nothing to you—eternity, everything. You do
                  not want<emph>my</emph> forgiveness; but there is One whose forgiveness you
                     <emph>must</emph> obtain, or the doors of mercy will be for ever closed."</p>
               <p>"It is too late to think of such things—too late!" said she, sinking back on her
                  pillow. "I am going; but whether into the blackness of annihilation, or—"She
                  stopped, with a spasmodic shudder, and added with rapid utterance—"Oh! if you knew
                  what I have suffered!—such agonies of pain! I have died ten thousand deaths
                  already! Oh! surely there is expiation in this! Tell me, if there is not! Sin must
                  be burnt out in the flames of suffering like mine!"</p>
               <p>"There is One who bore the burden of our sins, and the agonies of our sufferings,"
                  said Moreland, with inexpressible earnestness and solemnity. "His alone are
                  expiatory. To Him only can the living look for happiness; the dying for hope and
                  consolation. Oh! Claudia, by the love we once bore each other; by the child in
                  whose heart our own life is throbbing; by the eternity to which we both are
                  hastening; and by your soul and mine, which the Son of God died to redeem, I
                  beseech you to cast yourself, lost and helpless as you are, into His arms of love,
                  and breathe out your life in prayers for pardon! It is not too late! Dare not
                  limit the mercy of the Omnipotent!"</p>
               <p>"Where is He?" asked she faintly, raising herself on one elbow, and looking wildly
                  upward. "Where are the arms open to receive me? I see them not! I feel<pb
                     n="172-173" xml:id="VAC6695-00000092"/> them not! No, no, no! There is no
                  Saviour for me! I cannot pray—and they tell me prayer alone can open the gates of
                  heaven!"</p>
               <p>With an involuntary motion, Moreland knelt by her bedside and breathed forth one
                  of the most Solemn, fervent, thrilling prayers that ever gushed from mortal lips.
                  A soul shrouded in almost heathen darkness, trembling on the threshold of
                  eternity, seemed pleading through him, in agonies of supplication, from the depths
                  of penitence and remorse.</p>
               <p>Claudia lay with closed eyes, and hands tightly clasped over her bosom. The
                  silence of death reigned in the chamber long after his voice ceased, and Moreland
                  thought she slept, when, suddenly, low sobs, that threatened her with suffocation,
                  convulsed her frame, and she burst into a passion of tears, such as seldom flow
                  but from the eyes of childhood. The more Moreland endeavoured to soothe, the more
                  bitterly she wept. Deeply affected, he raised her head on his arm, and put back
                  the damp, matted locks that fell blinding over her temples.</p>
               <p>"I don't deserve this," she said. "You ought to curse me. Oh! I have been walking
                  in darkness all my life, and light dawns just as my eyes are about to close for
                  ever. How kind, how good, how just you have been, and I knew it not till now! Oh!
                  Moreland! if the living could know how the dying feel!"</p>
               <p>We will not attempt to describe all that passed in this hour of awful
                  reconciliation. Several times she was seized with paroxysms of agony terrible to
                  behold, but she would not allow him to ring for assistance.</p>
               <p>"The anodyne you have given me is the only thing that gives me the slightest
                  relief," she said, in the interval of her sufferings. "I cannot bear the sight of
                  those horrible negroes. I can bear pain better than their insolence."</p>
               <p>Moreland might have told her that no tyrants are so despotic as those who have
                  once been tyrannized over themselves; that they were revenging themselves while
                  she lay helpless on the bed of sickness, for the wrongs they had endured from her
                  in her day of power. He might have upbraided her for tearing away her child from
                  the gracious influences which were blessing her childhood, and exposing her to the
                  harshness and insolence she had brought in judgment on herself; but he came to
                  pour oil, not vinegar, on the wounded heart of the humiliated victim of her own
                  unmastered passions.</p>
               <p>"Why are you here without friends?" he asked; "at the mercy of menials, so
                  destitute of comfort, so lonely and desolate? Why did you not send for me sooner,
                  that I might relieve your sufferings and administer to your necessities?"</p>
               <p>"I felt a sullen pride in suffering alone and unpitied," she answered. "I dreamed
                  there was atonement for sin in such unknown anguish. Friend! I have no friend. You
                  are the only friend I ever had in the<pb n="174-175" xml:id="VAC6695-00000093"/>
                  world. Friend—clover—husband once," she slowly repeated, "now for ever lost to me.
                  Yes! I had one more friend—my adopted mother. Thank heaven! she died without
                  knowing how utterly unworthy I proved of her guardian love. My God! It was in this
                  very room she died! perhaps on this very pillow!"</p>
               <p>"Would that Eulalia were with me!" exclaimed Moreland; "she would prove to you an
                  angel of consolation. Let me send for her. You may linger yet for days and weeks.
                  You may yet be restored to health and life."</p>
               <p>"Never! the talons of the vulture are here," laying her hand on her breast. "It is
                  more than a year since I have known that I have an incurable malady, and I have
                  seen death coming slowly and surely, nearer and nearer, dark, cold, and
                  inexorable, with a burning dart in his hand, ready to transfix my writhing heart.
                  They wanted me to stay in Italy and die, but I would not. I could not die without
                  seeing you once more. I went to your door, almost, but dared not enter. Sickness
                  had made me a coward. I saw my child playing among the flowers, and there was no
                  one near to guard her. I stole softly behind her, threw my mantle round her head
                  to stifle her cries, and fled. Poor child! I wish I had not done it. I had better
                  left her with your Eulalia. I cannot make her love me."</p>
               <p>After another pause, in which her thoughts seemed flowing in a more tranquil
                  stream, she added—</p>
               <p>"You must not bring her hither. We ought not to breath the same atmosphere. She is
                  too pure, too holy. I should envy her even in my death-gasp. As I have lived
                  without the friendship, I can die without the sympathy of woman."</p>
               <p>Moreland could not realize that death was so rapidly approaching—she spoke with
                  such occasional energy, and such jets of fire issued from the dark fountains of
                  her eyes. But when unnatural excitement subsided into lethargy, and the
                  dark-veined lids closed over the large sunken orbs, while a deeper pallor settled
                  on her altered and sharpened features, he could see but too plainly the mark of
                  the skeleton fingers, whose grasp was tightening over her heart. There was nothing
                  left but the embers of life, which a breath might reduce to a cold heap of ashes.
                  Sad and mournful were his vigils. The melancholy winds of autumn swept with a
                  sighing, wailing sound against the windows, and sometimes the dry leaves came in a
                  drift against the panes, rustling and crackling as they fell. The stars gleamed
                  faintly through gray, rifted clouds, and the roar of a distant waterfall, with a
                  monotony more dreary than silence, murmured on the ear. Oh, woman! how dreadful,
                  even in this world, is the retribution that follows thy aberration from rectitude
                  and duty! Canst thou gather grapes of thorns, or roses from the barren sand? Canst
                  thou put thy hand in the cockatrice's den, without feeling the sting and venom of
                  his fangs? Canst thou wrap<pb n="176-177" xml:id="VAC6695-00000094"/> thyself body
                  and soul in the sheet-lightning of passion, without being scorched and shrivelled,
                  furrowed and scarred? A wife, without the protection or name of her husband,—a
                  mother, disowned by her child,—a mistress, the vassal of her slaves,—an
                  accountable being, awakened to the responsibilities of life at the very moment
                  when they are sliding from the grasp; an eternal soul, trembling, shivering,
                  groping in darkness illimitable, for something to sustain it, even if it be but
                  the wind-shaken reed! Wasted hours, perverted gifts, lost, lost treasures behind,
                  an unfathomable abyss below, a consuming God above—oh! is not this retribution?
                  These thoughts swelled high in the breast of Moreland, as he sat watching the
                  death-like slumbers that hung, like a heavy mist, over the couch of Claudia. The
                  wind rose higher, and swelled into loud and stormy gusts, before which the dark
                  cloud-racks scudded, unpiloted barks of a dim and boundless sea. Moreland rose and
                  looked out through the curtains, feeling a gloomy pleasure in the apparent
                  sympathy of nature. Dreariness without, desolation within. He was glad the moon
                  was not shining down, with cold, sickly effulgence; he was glad the stars were
                  hiding their twinkling faces under a cloud-veil, whose edges, torn by the wind,
                  seemed to flap as he gazed; and, when lightning came darting in zigzag leaps, high
                  up from the zenith, and plunged hot and fiery into the bowels of the earth, he
                  felt congenial electricity burning in his soul.</p>
               <p>He waited for the thunder, and it came muttering and roaring, like the startled
                  lion from his lair, mingling with the howling wind and the drifting rain. It was
                  one of those wild, terrific storms, peculiar to a Southern latitude, which
                  destroy, in a few moments, the growth of years. The shallow roots of the China
                  trees were torn up, and lay heaving and quivering on the earth; the broken
                  branches of the acacias went hurrying through the air like birds of rapine; and
                  every drop of rain seemed to bear upon its bosom a rent and twisted leaf.</p>
               <p>Claudia slept in the midst of this elemental war, for her senses were steeped in
                  lethargy by the powerful drug of the East. She slept, but she began to moan in her
                  slumbers, and toss her arms with delirious gesture—those poor, emaciated arms,
                  once so round and fair, and glittering with gems.</p>
               <p>"Oh! thou who ridest upon the wings of the wind, who makest darkness thy
                  pavilion," cried Moreland, turning from the dim-lighted couch to the darkened
                  heavens, "come not in judgment, but mercy! Have pity on the frail and erring
                  creatures thou hast made! Thou knowest our frames: thou rememberest that we are
                  but dust! Oh! it is a fearful thing, this rending of the immortal from the
                  mortal—fearful to witness, but, alas! more dread to bear!"</p>
               <p>At this moment, a large branch of the live oak came tumbling, crashing against the
                  house, bursting in the casement, and shivering into splinters the crystal
                     panes.<pb n="178-179" xml:id="VAC6695-00000095"/> The house rocked, and every
                  article of furniture vibrated with the concussion. The shock, the crash, roused
                  Claudia from the stupor in which her senses were steeped. She opened her eyes with
                  a look of indescribable terror.</p>
               <p>"The destroying angel is come!" she ejaculated, in a hollow, trembling voice. "I
                  hear the rushing of his terrible wings!"</p>
               <p>"The Lord is in the whirlwind, as well as the still small voice, Claudia," said
                  Moreland; but even as he spoke an awful change came over her countenance, and
                  violent paroxysms convulsed her features. Moreland, believing that the last
                  struggle had indeed begun, roused the servants, who, awakened by the storm, came
                  hurrying into the room, incapacitated by terror from rendering the services
                  required, Effie glided in after them. She looked with awe and dread on the pale,
                  writhing form her father was supporting in his arms; but she manifested no alarm
                  at the wild storm-gusts raging abroad.</p>
               <p>Moreland would have sent for a physician, but it was impossible to brave the fury
                  of the tempest; and he knew the skill of man was vain. That chill, gray tint,
                  never to be mistaken, that shows the tide of life has all ebbed, leaving the sands
                  dry and bare, was stealing, like twilight, over every feature, with a gradually
                  deepening shade.</p>
               <p>Moreland hung over her in unspeakable agony. He would have given worlds for one
                  assurance from her dying lips of submission to her God, of hope in her Saviour's
                  mercy. He felt a portion of that divine love in his heart, which threw its halo of
                  light round Calvary's blood-stained brow. He would willingly have offered up his
                  life for the peace of that departing soul.</p>
               <p>"Speak to me, Claudia," he cried, "and tell me if the hope of pardon has taken the
                  sting from death, the victory from the grave! Look at me, if speech is denied!
                  Give me one glance, in token that a forgiving God is found!"</p>
               <p>She could not speak, but she lifted her eyes, where all that remained of vitality
                  was concentrated in one burning spark, and fixed them steadfastly on his. Never,
                  never did he forget that glance. It haunted him years afterwards. He saw it in the
                  blaze of noonday—the darkness of midnight. It haunted him till his dying day.</p>
               <p>The morning sunbeams shone clear and bright on the wreck of the midnight storm—on
                  the uprooted trees, the splintered limbs, the drifted leaves, the torn and
                  dripping moss garlands. The morning sunbeams stole, with stealthy rays, through a
                  rifted curtain on the ruins of life,—the cold, white face, the shrouded eyes, and
                  folded hands; on the chillness, the stillness, the mystery of death. They
                  glimmered on triple bars of dust, stretching across the apartment, and gave them
                  the appearance of gauzy gold. The glittering particles sunk<pb n="180-181"
                     xml:id="VAC6695-00000096"/> lower and lower, till they seemed to float like a
                  shroud over the body of the dead.</p>
               <p>Even in death was the hand of retribution visible. No white blossoms, emblematical
                  of purity, were scattered over the couch,—no fragrant jessamine or roses,
                  overpowering, with their sweetness, the deadly odour of mortality. The fair,
                  perishing tokens of love and memory with which Southern custom beautifies the
                  shroud and the coffin, were wanting here.</p>
               <p>Moreland and his little daughter followed her to her lonely grave. He was spared
                  the pain of a public funeral by the isolation of the dwelling. It was the
                  country-seat of Claudia's adopted mother, remarkable for the beauty of its
                  situation, and once distinguished for its elegance and taste. Now, however,
                  everything wore a neglected, dilapidated appearance. The vines and shrubbery which
                  the former mistress had so carefully trained had grown to rank luxuriance, the
                  former trailing in the dust, the latter covered with dingy cobwebs and defaced by
                  the caterpillars' nests.</p>
               <p>A new care now rested on Moreland. Effie, by her mother's death, became the
                  heiress of her property. He would gladly have been released from this additional
                  responsibility, for the negroes, left so long without proper discipline, were
                  exceedingly difficult to manage. He resolved to break up the establishment and
                  take them to his own plantation, which was under such excellent lent regulations,
                  and where the influence of example would be more powerful than precept or
                  reproof.</p>
               <p>Little did he dream of the subterranean fires sullenly roaring under the apparent
                  quietude of the surface. Little did he dream that Lucifer, in the garb of an angel
                  of light, concealing the cunning of the serpent under the dissembled innocence of
                  the dove, was plotting rebellion, bloodshed, and ruin.</p>
               <p>There was peace and happiness, however, in reserve, in the home doubly endeared by
                  contrast with the harrowing scenes through which he had lately passed. And yet the
                  remembrance of Claudia, her sufferings and her death, long brooded in sadness on
                  his heart. That last glance, so earnestly sought as a token of peace, and received
                  as a sign of unutterable agony, often awakened him suddenly from the dreams of
                  midnight, and seemed to be accompanied by a wailing cry that rang through the
                  household, and left its mournful echoes in his soul. Eula wept over her fate. Not
                  all her joy at the restoration of the lost Effie could remove the sad impression
                  of her mother's melancholy death—and it was long before the Effie who was taken
                  from them reappeared. The little wilful being, whose childish prattle was
                  vulgarized by African phrases, learned by constant association with the negroes,
                  was not the child of Eula's tender, restraining care. She had to begin anew her
                  labours of love. New tares were to be uprooted, new thorns extracted, and choking
                  stones removed, before<pb n="182-183" xml:id="VAC6695-00000097"/> the lately
                  neglected plant could receive, in blessing, the sunshine and the dew of
                  culture.</p>
               <p>But Eula, with unexampled sweetness of temper and constancy of purpose, applied
                  herself to the task, in the hope of final success. She had another cause of
                  anxiety, of which she never complained, but which her natural sensitiveness and
                  timidity made her shrink from analyzing. She missed the respectful, affectionate,
                  spontaneous obedience which had made the relation of mistress and servants
                  hitherto so delightful. Albert seemed less changed than the others, but there was
                  something, even in him, which she felt, without being able to explain.</p>
               <p>The Ides of March! The Ides of March!" Will a darker spirit than that which
                  crimsoned the Roman Capitol with blood, be suffered to consummate its fell
                  designs?</p>

               <head>CHAPTER VIII.</head>
               <p>THE jailer's wife sat alone in a little room adjoining the prisoners' cells. Her
                  husband was absent, and had committed to her care the keys of the prison-house,
                  which she most faithfully guarded. The new jail, a handsome, massy brick building,
                  had been burned down a short time previous (whether by accident or design, no one
                  had been able to discover), and the dismal walls of the old wooden one once more
                  showed signs of occupancy. The partition that separated the cells from each other
                  were so thin, the shrunken boards exhibiting many a chink and crevice, that voices
                  could easily penetrate the barrier. Thus the prisoners, though nominally divided,
                  could hold occasional intercourse with each other, when they believed themselves
                  safe from vigilant and listening ears.</p>
               <p>The jailer's wife was an energetic and industrious woman, who frequently sat up
                  beyond the midnight hour, plying her busy needle. It was a nice, quiet time to
                  sew, when the children were asleep, and the prisoners at rest on their pallets of
                  straw.</p>
               <pb n="184-185" xml:id="VAC6695-00000098"/>
               <p>The only present occupants of the jail were two negro men, who had been arrested
                  in the act of breaking into the bank, They belonged to different masters, and had
                  previously sustained honest and respectable characters. The name of one was Jerry,
                  the other, Jack.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Wood, the jailer's wife, was seated by a comfortable fire, for it was a
                  chilly, wintry night; and, as she heard the low whistling of the wind under the
                  doors and windows, she thought, of their cold, lonely cells, and wished she could
                  communicate to them some of the genial warmth she was enjoying alone. She was a
                  kind-hearted woman, and many a heart had blessed her, in going forth from those
                  prison walls.</p>
               <p>She was startled by the sound of voices in the cells, where she knew the prisoners
                  were in solitary confinement. Laying down her needle-work, and stepping to the
                  door on tiptoe, she put her ear to the key-hole, and held her breath to listen.
                  She heard distinctly the voice of Jerry talking to Jack through the chinks of the
                  partition; and, gathering the import of their preceding conversation from the
                  words which met her ear, she stood paralyzed with amazement and horror.</p>
               <p>"Hush!" said Jack, "you talk too loud. 'Spose somebody hear what you say? Put your
                  mouth close to this crack. Now, just talk easy. How long, you think, Tore
                  Christmas?"</p>
               <p>"'Bout two weeks, or so; 'spect it's most by," answered Jerry. "The Lord Harry!
                  ain't we gwinter have a merry Christmas, this time? White folks laugh wrong side
                  of the mouth, won't they?"</p>
               <p>"'Spose they find us out, Jerry!—wonder how merry we'll be then? 'Most wish I'd
                  never had nothing to do with it, no how! If the Lord all on our side, as
                     <emph>he</emph> tell us, wonder what he let 'em catch us and shut us up here
                  for? He said the Lord gwine to fight for us, with great big flaming sword! Don't
                  see it! Don't much believe he got any!"</p>
               <p>"You're fit for nothing but a coward, Jack! If it hadn't bin for you being afeard,
                  we shouldn't bin cotched in the fust place! I tell you 'twill all come right. The
                  patrole never stays out arter twelve,—they're too lazy to keep out of bed more
                  than they can help!"</p>
               <p>"Wonder if they warn't up when they poked us in this here ole dark hole?"</p>
               <p>"The niggers 'll be too mighty for 'em <emph>this</emph> time, I tell you! Ain't
                  they coming from all the plantations? And what good, I want to know, is the
                  patrole gwine to be, when the bridge set afire, go splash in the water, and white
                  folks got nowhere to go?"</p>
               <p>"How we gwine to get out, wonder?" said the misgiving Jack.</p>
               <p>"You great big black fool of a nigger," cried Jerry, in a contemptuous tone,
                  "think they won't set fire to the old jail fust of all? Can't get 'long without
                  Jerry, I know!"</p>
               <pb n="186-187" xml:id="VAC6695-00000099"/>
               <p>"Look a here, Jerry—wish I'd never had nothing to do with this business. Hain't
                  had no peace of mind since it was sot a going. 'Tain't right, killing and burning
                  folks in the dark—folks as done well by a body, too. Don't think we gwine to
                  better ourselves, arter all."</p>
               <p>"There's no use in talking to a fool," cried the lordly Jerry; "but you better
                  mind! If you let out on it, one syllable, you'll swing up by that black neck of
                  yourn, way up yonder on the pine tree! Don't you know what the preacher said?"</p>
               <p>"Shouldn't think the Lord would send that sort of preacher. Well! he know best,
                  sure enough. Tell you what, Jerry—I'm gwine to sleep. Bimeby you'll find out what
                  a raal fool means. 'Spect you think you my massa aready—hi!"</p>
               <p>"Shut your mouth and go to sleep," said Jerry, who, though he addressed such
                  imperious language to his brother prisoner, uttered it in a tone of good-natured
                  contempt, as if he were more in jest than earnest. Silence followed this last
                  injunction, which was soon interrupted by a snoring sound, implying that the order
                  was obeyed.</p>
               <p>The jailer's wife turned from the door and walked softly back to the fire,
                  shivering in every limb. Leaning her elbows on her knees, and her head upon her
                  hands, she revolved in her mind the startling hints she had just heard, and the
                  best course of conduct for her to pursue. As we said before, she was a woman of
                  great energy of character; and though horror-stricken at the plot just unfolded,
                  she was not intimidated. The idea that Providence had made her the instrument of
                  discovering a conspiracy so dark and deadly, gave her a moral courage and
                  determination appropriate to the emergency. Her husband being absent, she resolved
                  to act on her own responsibility. Not being able to sleep, she watched with
                  impatience the dawning day, thinking the morning twilight had never lingered half
                  so long.</p>
               <p>After having sent the prisoners their usual breakfast, she filled a plate with
                  nice things from her own table, and went to the grate of Jerry's cell. His was the
                  master spirit, and the one she was resolved to bring under her influence.</p>
               <p>"Here, Jerry," said she, "if you didn't sleep more than I did last night, I
                  thought you might feel poorly this morning, and would relish a mouthful of my
                  breakfast."</p>
               <p>"Missus mighty good," answered Jerry, gloating over the plate with eager,
                  devouring eyes; "but what make her think I didn't sleep? Slept like a top all
                  night long. Wonder what made missus keep awake!"</p>
               <p>"I'll tell you presently," said she; "but I want to ask you one question before I
                  begin. Have I not been kind to you, Jerry? Have I not done all I could for you and
                  Jack, and treated you just as well as if you were white?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, that you have, missus; but what make you ax<pb n="188-189"
                     xml:id="VAC6695-00000100"/> me that now?" The eyes of the negro glanced from
                  one side to the other, without looking towards her, and the muscles about his
                  mouth began to twitch.</p>
               <p>"Have you a cruel master, Jerry, and a bad mistress?"</p>
               <p>"No, missus, not as I know of: got nothing to complain of. Never worked at home
                  much—work out by the job. Pay so much to massa; all I make over, keep myself."</p>
               <p>"Have you had hard times getting work? Do the people cheat you out of your
                  money?"</p>
               <p>"No, missus! good work, good pay, or Jerry wouldn't have nothing to do with it.
                  Always got 'long mighty well 'bout money."</p>
               <p>"Then, Jerry," said she, fixing her eyes resolutely on his face, and speaking in a
                  calm deliberate tone, "what do you want to kill me for, if I am your friend? and
                  your master and mistress, if they have been good to you? and the white people, if
                  they have never abused you? What put such a thing as that in your head?"</p>
               <p>So quietly and coolly she questioned him, one might have supposed she was asking
                  him how he liked the breakfast she had brought him. The negro winced under her
                  steadfast gaze, and his hands trembled so that the plate dropped into his lap.</p>
               <p>"Don't know what you talking 'bout," said he, putting both hands to his head and
                  rubbing his wool till it stood up fierce and grim all round his temples. "Sure
                  enough missus must be crazy!"</p>
               <p>"No, Jerry! I'm in my right mind, thank God! and you soon will find it out. I
                  heard all that you and Jack said last night, and if you don't tell me the whole
                  plot, from beginning to end, you shall both swing from the scaffold into flames
                  hotter than your Christmas bonfires."</p>
               <p>"Oh, missus!" cried Jerry, every feature working and convulsed, while his
                  eye-balls glowed like burning coals. "I just talking in my sleep—knows I was.
                  Don't know nothing what you mean. Hain't got nothing 'gin white folks—never did
                  have."</p>
               <p>"There's no use in lying to me, Jerry. It won't do. Your only safety now is in
                  speaking the truth, and the whole truth, and nothing but the truth. On no other
                  terms can you have one hope of pardon. I am going to a magistrate, to tell him all
                  I have discovered; and you will just as surely be hung upon the scaffold as you
                  are sitting on that bed of straw."</p>
               <p>Here groans and ejaculations from the next cell came gushing through the chinks.
                  Jack could not hold in any longer.</p>
               <p>"Oh, Lord a'mercy! Lord a'mercy!" exclaimed Jack; "wish this nigger had never been
                  born!"</p>
               <p>"Hush, Jack!" said the jailer's wife; "hush that noise! I'm coming to you
                  presently. Make up your Jerry. Tell everything you know, and get a<pb n="190-191"
                     xml:id="VAC6695-00000101"/> good chance for life, or choose chains, the rope,
                  and scaffold.</p>
               <p>In consequence of the quiet behaviour of the negroes and the entreaties of Mrs.
                  Wood, their manacles had been knocked off, and their limbs were now free as her
                  own.</p>
               <p>"Jerry sprang to his feet, shaking himself as the shaggy mastiff does, when the
                  fierce, animal nature is roused within him. He looked wild and desperate, and a
                  timid woman would have fled trembling from that grated window. But the jailer's
                  wife stood her ground with undaunted mien, and kept her intrepid eye on the black,
                  ignited face before her.</p>
               <p>"I am not afraid of you, Jerry," said she; "you would not lift a finger against me
                  to save your life. You have not a bad heart. You have been set on by others, who
                  would destroy you, body and soul, if you would let them. Well! I am going. There
                  is no time to be lost."</p>
               <p>"Stop, missus!" exclaimed the negro. "I made up my mind."</p>
               <p>"Twon't do no good if you hain't," cried Jack, through the chink, "I'll make a
                  clean breast, if I be hanged for't."</p>
               <p>The plot, as related by Jerry, with occasional episodes from Jack, was cunningly
                  devised and deeply laid. During the Christmas holidays there was to be a general
                  insurrection in the surrounding country, and the rallying spot was the city, of
                  which they were to take possession by fire and sword. Quantities of ammunition,
                  brought in by night, by secret agents, were concealed under the African church and
                  in the old cellars of houses occupied by negroes, who hired their own time of
                  their masters. A false key was to open the doors of the arsenal; the bridge was to
                  be set on fire; the strongholds of wealth and power to be broken up. And who was
                  the master spirit that raised the whirlwind, and was to direct the storm? What
                  power had lashed the peaceful waters into wrathful foam, and was rolling them on
                  in waves of insurgency over the land?</p>
               <p>It was he, who, clothing himself with the authority of a divine mission, and
                  gifted with an eloquence passing that of the sons of men, had wrapped his
                  influence, like a mantle of fire, round his superstitious victims, and every
                  struggle but drew the burning folds tighter and tighter. When prostrate at the
                  altar, where his terrible representations of Almighty wrath had driven them, he
                  first breathed into their ears his insidious designs. He told them he was the
                  agent of the Almighty, and that whoever betrayed his counsel would be doomed to
                  everlasting punishment. He promised them riches, honours, and happiness in this
                  world, and crowns of glory in the next, if they yielded themselves to his will, in
                  faith and trust. The robbery of the bank was a step towards the kingdom of heaven.
                  The money was needed to carry on the Lord's work, and he who stretched forward
                     the<pb n="192-193" xml:id="VAC6695-00000102"/> boldest hand would be accounted
                  the most faithful and profitable servant.</p>
               <p>The next step taken by this firm and resolute woman, was to go for a magistrate,
                  to whom the statement was repeated, and taken down in writing. He enjoined upon
                  her perfect secrecy, till the authorities of the city had decided upon the proper
                  measures to be taken in an affair of such vital importance.</p>
               <p>That evening Moreland was called away, and remained till a late hour. When he
                  returned, Eula noticed at the first glance that something unusual had occurred. He
                  was very pale, his eyes seemed to wear a darker hue, and there was no love-smile
                  as usual, responding to the greeting smile of his wife.</p>
               <p>"Where is Albert?" he asked; and never had Eula heard his voice sound so stern and
                  unnatural.</p>
               <p>"I suppose he is in the kitchen," answered Eula. "I have not seen him during the
                  evening."</p>
               <p>Moreland rung the bell with such force that a quick, startling peal rung echoing
                  through the house. Becoming more and more alarmed, Eula's fears, winged by natural
                  affection, flew to her native home, and imagined a thousand ills, whose tidings
                  had just readied him, and which he would fain conceal from her.</p>
               <p>"Oh, Moreland, tell me what has happened!" she asked, in tremulous accents. "Have
                  letters from the North arrived? Do they contain evil for me?"</p>
               <p>"The North!" repeated he, almost fiercely. "No, Eula! Would to Heaven—" He paused,
                  and added in an altered accent—"Do not question me, my dear wife. I am hardly
                  master of myself; but be assured, that as far as I know, your Northern friends are
                  well. You have no cause for apprehension, believe me. Albert," said he to the
                  mulatto as he opened the door, "put the black horse in the buggy directly, and
                  bring it round to the gate. I am going to start for the plantation, and you must
                  go with me."</p>
               <p>"To-night!" exclaimed Eula. "Oh! not to-night! The sky is dark and lowering! You
                  will not go tonight!"</p>
               <p>"I must, my Eula; there is no alternative. I wish I were not obliged to leave you
                  and my children. Albert, why don't you obey me? Must I repeat my commands a second
                  time?"</p>
               <p>"Oh, master, don't go to the plantation! Don't leave mistress and the children
                  here!" cried Albert, his golden complexion changing to a gray, ashen hue, and his
                  eyes expressing the very agony of supplication.</p>
               <p>"And why should I not go?" demanded he, sternly. "Do you know of any evil
                  threatening me there that you keep back from my knowledge? Have <emph>you</emph>
                  turned traitor to the master who has so loved and trusted you, Albert?"</p>
               <p>"No, dear master," cried he, throwing himself at his feet, and winding his arms
                  round his knees, "I wouldn't harm you or mistress for a thousand worlds; but
                     there's<pb n="194-195" xml:id="VAC6695-00000103"/> them that will! Don't go to
                  the plantation, master! That preacher you sent there——oh! Mars. Russell—he made me
                  swear on the Bible not to tell what he was going to say, or I'd told on him long
                  ago. I wouldn't have nothing to do with it, and they never let me know nothing
                  since. He says I'll lose my soul for a false oath; but I'll lose body and soul
                  'fore I see harm happen to you and mistress. Oh! Mars. Russell, don't go to the
                  plantation!—don't go where Mars. Brainard is! Don't think Albert would turn
                  against you!—no, he die first!"</p>
               <p>The mulatto wept bitterly, as he lay grovelling at his master's feet, entreating
                  his forgiveness, and imploring him to take care of himself and "Miss Eula."</p>
               <p>"Rise, Albert," said his master. "I am glad you have told me this, but I knew it
                  all before. I can no longer trust, though I may forgive. My wife, there is no
                  cause for these pale cheeks, this trembling frame. There is no danger, for
                  everything is discovered. The moment there is a suspicion of a plot, there is
                  safety. Every one is on the watch. A strong patrole will guard the city every
                  night, and all the night. You are surrounded by friends, under whose guardianship
                  you will be as safe as at this moment, in my enfolding arms. Would to heaven I
                  were not compelled to leave you! but the serpent is spreading his venom among my
                  poor deluded people, and I must go and save them from his fangs!"</p>
               <p>"Let me go with you!" cried Eula, clinging to him, with passionate entreaty;—"let
                  us take our children, and go together. If there is no danger for you, there is
                  none for me. I fear not for myself; but, oh! let me not be separated from you, in
                  these dark and troubled moments! Let me go, my husband; I will not trouble you
                  with one weak, womanish fear!"</p>
               <p>Moreland looked at her with an irresolute, troubled countenance, and clasped her
                  closer to his breast.</p>
               <p>"Was it for scenes like these," he cried, in tones of mingled bitterness and
                  sorrow, "that I took you from your peaceful village and quiet home? But, oh! my
                  Eulalia, the spoiler came from your Northern region; and, under the sheltering
                  banner of the Cross, has been working the deeds of hell! His birth-place was his
                  passport,—his holy calling his protection from suspicion. Am I to blame, for being
                  so blindly duped, so basely deceived?"</p>
               <p>"No, no!—but let me go with you. I shall die if you leave me behind! With you, I
                  fear nothing, not even death itself!"</p>
               <p>"I know not what to do!" cried Moreland, his heart yielding to the pleadings of
                  his wife, while his judgment condemned its weakness; "it is agony to leave you,—it
                  seems madness to take you! And Ildegerte,—poor Ildegerte!"—</p>
               <p>"Take her with us. She will think and feel as I do. Husband and brother, as well
                  as master, listen to our pleading hearts!"</p>
               <pb n="196-197" xml:id="VAC6695-00000104"/>
               <p>"If I did not know that you would be as safe there as in this drawing-room," said
                  Moreland, "I never would consent. But it is only in my absence the tempter can
                  have any power. I know my own influence. The moment I am in their midst, they will
                  return to their allegiance, ashamed of their transient dereliction. Well, be it
                  so, then; but prepare as quickly as Josephine did, when she followed Napoleon in
                  his midnight tours. Go, Albert, and hare the carriage ordered as well as the
                  buggy,—a saddle-horse besides."</p>
               <p>Eula, who felt as if she had had a reprieve from death, in permission to depart,
                  flew to Ildegerte, and told her in as few words as possible all that had
                  transpired. To the crushed heart of the young widow, everything short of the one
                  great sorrow that had darkened her life seemed a minor consideration. Like
                  Moreland, too, she felt such perfect confidence in the attachment of their
                  slaves,—she believed his presence only was necessary to insure their obedience and
                  returning loyalty.</p>
               <p>It was astonishing with what celerity and ease everything was accomplished.
                  Kizzie, though bewildered and half-terrified at the summons, took the sleeping
                  Effie in her arms, while Eula cradled the infant Russell in her own. All necessary
                  garments were previously packed; and, when the carriages came to the door, the
                  whole party were in readiness.</p>
               <p>A threatened insurrection! Eulalia well remembered the horror she had felt, even
                  as a child, at the bare idea. She remembered, too, that her father had justified
                  the act, and said that were he near the scene of action, he should think it his
                  duty to abet and assist the insurgent party. Brainard had announced himself as her
                  father's friend. He had sat down at his board, been warmed at his fireside, and
                  admitted into the most intimate social communion with him. Could he be aware of
                  his secret designs? Was he willing to sacrifice his daughter, with more than Roman
                  stoicism, to the fierce spirit of <emph>philanthropy,</emph> embodied in the
                  reckless, cruel, and insidious Brainard? She could not, would not believe it; but
                  the possibility of her father's being in collusion with this agent of darkness,
                  gave her unutterable anguish. Strange! she did not tremble, now she was brought
                  face to face with a reality, whose phantom had so often chilled her in her
                  Northern home. Her courage rose with the occasion; and since she was permitted to
                  remain at her husband's side, she felt that whatever trials were in reserve for
                  him, she could not only share them with the devotion of a wife, but endure them
                  with the spirit of a martyr. Gentleness, sensitiveness, and delicacy, flowers of
                  life's sunshine, had always blossomed in her heart. Fortitude, heroism, and
                  self-renunciation, stars of the night-shade of existence, now illuminated with
                  deepening lustre the darkness of her spirit. And now she recalled the manner in
                  which he had spoken of her marriage, and of Claudia's right to her child, and<pb
                     n="198-199" xml:id="VAC6695-00000105"/> his words lost their sting, since she
                  understood the spirit which gave them utterance,—envy, malice, and all
                  uncharitableness, and a fiendish love of inflicting pain.</p>
               <p>As they approached the plantation, Moreland became silent and abstracted. The
                  dependencies which hung upon him were heavier than the chains of slavery, and more
                  galling. He had a double task before him,—to unmask the <emph>holy</emph> traitor,
                  who had so basely requited his hospitality and his confidence, and unwind his
                  coils from the necks of his deluded victims. He felt, in all its venomed power,
                  the sting of ingratitude and treachery. He had fulfilled the duties of a master so
                  faithfully and conscientiously, bearing them not only on his mind, but his heart;
                  had laboured so assiduously for the moral improvement, as well as happiness of his
                  slaves, and felt towards them so tenderly and affectionately, that he could not
                  think of their disaffection and alienation without bitterness and sorrow. Yet it
                  was in compassion, rather than anger, that he regarded them, for he well knew the
                  arts which had seduced them, and the eloquence which had swayed.</p>
               <p>Had he received no intimation of the conspiracy, he would have known from the
                  countenances of the negroes that an under-current, black as their skins, was
                  flowing beneath the smooth surface of their welcome. Had they been
                  thunder-stricken, they could hardly have appeared more smitten than by the
                  unexpected arrival of their master and his family.</p>
               <p>Moreland's first inquiry was for Brainard. He had just left for the other
                  plantation. How long since? About ten minutes. Aha! he must have seen their
                  coming, as they wound round the hill, which looked down on the cultivated fields
                  and smiling plain, which More-land had never before greeted without an emotion of
                  pleasure. He had a warrant, given him by the city authorities, to arrest the
                  villain, whom he expected to find in the comfortable quarters he had assigned him.
                  For one moment he felt an impulse to pursue the traitor, whose flight was
                  sufficient proof of his cowardice and perfidy; but the next he dismissed the
                  thought. He could not leave his family unprotected. Let him go,—the emissaries of
                  justice were now abroad in the land, and would, sooner or later, circumvent his
                  path. Let him go,—"Vengeance is mine, I will repay," saith the Lord.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER IX.</head>
               <p>A LONG, winding blast of the bugle-horn summoned the labourers from the field, the
                  carpenter and blacksmith from their shops, the spinsters from their wheels, the
                  weaver from her loom, and emptied, as if by magic, the white-washed cabins. The
                  negroes, one and all, had been told to attend their master's call, expressed by
                  that sounding blast. It was just before the sunset hour,—one of those mild,
                  glowing days, that so often diffuse over the aspect of a Southern winter the
                  blandness of summer and the haziness of autumn. Eulalia and Ildegerte stood in the
                  portico, spectatresses of a scene which made their hearts throb high in their
                  bosoms. Ildegerte's eyes flashed with excitement. Eulalia's cheek was the bed of
                  its coming and vanishing roses. She saw her husband standing, as she had seen him
                  once before, the centre of a dark ring, but she gazed with far different emotions.
                  It could not be said that she feared for him. His superiority was so manifest,
                  that it suggested, at once, the idea of triumph—the triumph of mind over matter.
                  He seemed to her an angel of light surrounded by the spirits of darkness, and,
                  knowing that he was defended by the breastplate of righteousness, she was assured
                  of his safety as well as his power.</p>
               <p>Moreland waited till they had all gathered, and they came with halting, lingering
                  steps, very unlike their former cheerful alacrity; then, telling them to follow
                  him, he led the way to the grave of the old prophetess, Dilsy, at whose burial he
                  had made with them a solemn covenant, which <emph>he</emph> had kept inviolate. It
                  was long since any of them had approached the burying ground. In all their nightly
                  meetings they had avoided passing it, fearing that the spirits of the dead would
                  sweep their cold wings in their faces, or seize them with their stiff and icy
                  fingers, or shriek in their ear some unearthly denunciation. As they walked
                  through the place of graves, the long, dry yellow grass broke and crumpled under
                  their steps, and the brambles twisted round their ankles. They had neglected their
                  dead. The autumn leaves lay thick, damp, and rotting on the sods that covered
                  them, choking the vines and plants, which, in happier hours, had been cultured
                  there</p>
               <p>Moreland stopped by the headstone, which his own hand had placed at Dilsy's grave,
                  and indicated by a commanding gesture the places they were to assume. Paul, the
                  preacher, stood nearest to him, his arms folded on his brawny chest, and his hoary
                  locks of wool bent so low they seemed scattering their powder on the ground.
                  Vulcan, the blacksmith, black and sullen as a<pb n="202-203"
                     xml:id="VAC6695-00000107"/> thunder-cloud, stood on his left. The women, who
                  had most of them been excluded from the secret deliberations, hung timidly in the
                  rear, curiosity and apprehension struggling in them for mastery. And beyond the
                  edge of the burying-ground, the two children of More—land,—the one holding the
                  hand, the other borne in the arms of Kizzie, shone in the innocence of infancy and
                  beauty of childhood, on the gloom and duskiness of the scene.</p>
               <p>"More than two years have passed," said Moreland, his eyes glancing from face to
                  face, calmly and gravely, as he spoke, "since I stood on this spot, on which the
                  grave-clods had just been thrown, and you all stood around me then, just as you
                  are gathered now. At that hour, I renewed the vows of protection and kindness to
                  you which I uttered, when a boy, in the ear of a dying mother. I told you, if I
                  ever proved unkind, unjust, and tyrannical, if I ever forgot my duties to you as a
                  master and a friend, to meet me here, in this solemn enclosure, and remind me of
                  what I then said. You all promised then, to continue faithful, trustworthy, and
                  obedient, and, judging of the future by the past, I believed you. And yet," he
                  added, his voice deepening into sternness and his eye kindling with indignation,
                  "you have basely deceived me; you have been listening to a traitor and a villain,
                  and plotting against your master and your friend. Under pretence of worshipping
                  God, you have been engaged in the service of Satan, and doing the work of devils.
                  I know all your horrible plans. I know what holiday frolics you are preparing.
                  Which of you has a word to say in his defence? Which of you can look me in the
                  face and say he does not deserve the severest punishment, for treachery and
                  ingratitude to a master as kind and forbearing as I have ever been? Paul, you have
                  taken upon you the office of a preacher of the gospel of peace, who, on all
                  occasions, are the voice of your brethren; look up, speak, and if you have one
                  word to say in your justification and theirs, let us hear it, and hear it
                  quickly."</p>
               <p>"No, massa!" cried Paul, slowly raising his head, without lifting his eyes; "got
                  noting to say—noting—only Massa Brainard."</p>
               <p>"Poor, deluded creatures!" said Moreland, "poor, blind tools of an artful,
                  selfish, false, and cold-hearted hypocrite, who cares no more for you than the
                  grass you are trampling under your feet. I pity you; for I sent the wretch in your
                  midst, believing him to be a man of God. He has beguiled you with promises of
                  freedom. What is the freedom he can offer you? Nothing but poverty, degradation,
                  and sorrow. If you could compare your condition with those of the free coloured
                  people at the North, you would shudder to think of all that you have escaped.
                  Listen! You are slaves, and I am free; but I neither made you slaves nor myself a
                  free man. We are all in the condition in which we were born. You are black, and I
                  am white; but I did not<pb n="204-205" xml:id="VAC6695-00000108"/> give you those
                  sable skins, nor myself this fairer complexion. You and I are as God Almighty made
                  us, and, as I expect to give an account of the manner in which I fulfil my duties
                  as a master, so you will be judged according to your fidelity, honesty, and
                  uprightness as servants. The Bible says—'Can the Ethiopian change his skin? No, he
                  cannot! but there is no reason why he should have a black heart, because his skin
                  is black. Free! how willingly would I make you free this moment, if, by so doing,
                  I could make you better and happier! Free! I would to heaven you were all
                  free,—then I, too, should be free from a burden made intolerable by your treachery
                  and ingratitude! I would rather, ten thousand times, cultivate these broad fields
                  myself, than be served by faithless hands and false, hollow hearts. I have hands
                  that can work. I would do it cheerfully, if labour was the portion God had
                  assigned me in this world. Better, far better, the toiling limbs, than the aching
                  heart!"</p>
               <p>He paused a moment in indescribable emotion. Among those who were looking
                  earnestly in his face, and drinking in his words with countenances expressive of
                  shame, remorse, and returning devotion, were some who had been the playmates of
                  his childhood, and others in whose arms he had been dandled and caressed when a
                  little boy, and others, again, mere boys now, whom he had made the playthings of
                  his youthful <unclear>years.</unclear> He remembered sitting, many and many a
                  time, in the lap of Paul, under an old tree, teaching him to read, while the negro
                  would twist his dark fingers in his childish locks, and pray God Almighty to bless
                  him and make him a blessing to mankind. As able filament was twisted in every cord
                  that bound him to the past. The associations of bygone years rose above the
                  painful and gloomy present, and it was far more in sorrow than in anger, that he
                  regarded the large family whom the most consummate art had alienated from him.</p>
               <p>"Paul," said he, turning to the preacher, whose head was drooping still lower on
                  his breast, and whose cheeks were marked by a wet, shining streak, where silent
                  tears were travelling, "Paul, do you remember Davy, to whom my father gave his
                  freedom many years ago, and who afterwards bought his wife and settled in the
                  State of New York?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, massa!"</p>
               <p>"Here is a letter, which I received from him a few days since. I will read it. I
                  want you all to listen to it."<ref rend="super" target="#note_002"

                              /> away. I'm very sick; the doctor says I can't live long. I'm willing
                              to die; but there's one great care on my mind. I don't want to leave
                              my wife and children here. I've made a considerable property, so they
                              wouldn't be in want; but that ain't all a person wants, master. If I
                              had life before me again, I'd come back myself, for I've never been as
                              happy, or as respectable, as when I lived with old Master. I heard so
                              much talk about the white people at the North being such friends to
                              the blacks, I thought we'd be on perfect equality; but it's no such
                              thing. They won't associate with us; and I never want my wife and
                              children to put themselves on a level with the free negroes I see
                              here,—they are a low, miserable set, and folks that respect themselves
                              won't have anything to do with them. My dear young master, please come
                              on, or, if you can't come yourself, send somebody to take back my wife
                              and children,—I have but two daughters, if they were boys I would not
                              care so much. I give them to you, just as if they had never been free.
                              I bequeath you all my property too, and wish it was more. Oh! happy
                              should I be, could I live to see the son of my dear old master before
                              I die,—but the will of God be done. I've got somebody to write this
                              letter for me, for I am too weak to sit up; but I'll put my name to
                              it, that you may know it comes from</p>

               <p>"This letter," said Moreland, "was dictated by one who has tasted the joys of
                  freedom, as it exists among the black people at the North. His condition is far
                  better than the majority, for he has acquired property, while most of them are
                  miserably poor. Listen to me, sons and daughters of Africa! If I thought freedom
                  would be a blessing to you, it should be yours. East, West, or North, anywhere,
                  everywhere, you might go, and I would bid you God speed; but I would as soon send
                  those poor sheep on the hill-side, among ravening wolves, as cast you amid such
                  friends as this pretended minister of God represents! Which of you wants to trust
                  him now? Which of you wants to leave your master and follow him? Tell me, for I
                  will have no Judas in the field, ready to betray his too kind and trusting
                  master!"</p>
               <p>"Oh, massa!" exclaimed Paul,—completely subdued and melted, and sinking down on
                  his knees, right on the grave of Dilsy,—"forgive us! Don't send us away! Trust us
                  once more! We've ben 'ceived by Satan, and didn't know what we were doing!"</p>
               <p>The moment Paul prostrated himself before his master, all but <emph>one</emph>
                  followed his example, entreating for pardon, and imploring with tears and sobs not
                  to be sent away from him. Vulcan, the blacksmith, stood firm and unmoved as the
                  anvil in his forge. All his dark and angry passions had been whetted on the edge
                  of the murderous weapons hidden beneath his shop, and<pb n="208-209"
                     xml:id="VAC6695-00000110"/> made red not by the flames of the midnight furnace.
                  His stubborn knees refused to bend, and a sullen cloud added luridness to his
                  raven-black face.</p>
               <p>Moreland and he stood side by side;—all the rest were kneeling. The beams of the
                  departing sun played in golden glory round the brow of Moreland; the negro seemed
                  to absorb the rays,—he looked of more intense, inky blackness.</p>
               <p>"Vulcan!" said his master, "if you expect my forgiveness, ask it. Dare to resist
                  me, and you shall feel the full weight of my indignation. "</p>
               <p>"I'm my own master," cried the blacksmith, in a morose, defying tone. "I ain't a
                  gwine to let no man set his feet on my neck. If the rest are a mind to be fools,
                  let 'em!" and he shook his iron hand over the throng, and rolled his bloodshot
                  eyes, like a tiger ready to spring from its lair.</p>
               <p>The face of Moreland turned pale as marble, and lightnings kindled in his eyes. To
                  brute force and passion he had nothing to oppose but moral courage and undaunted
                  will; but he paused not to measure his strength with the muscles swelling out,
                  like twisting serpents, in the negro's brandished arm. Laying his right hand
                  commandingly on his shoulder, he exclaimed:—</p>
               <p>"There is but one master here. Submit to his authority, or tremble for the
                  consequences!"</p>
               <p>Suddenly wrenching his shoulder from the hand that grasped it, the blacksmith
                  leaped forward, and seizing his master in his gigantic arms, was about to hurl him
                  to the ground, when a tremendous blow on the back of his head laid him prostrate
                  and stunned at Moreland's feet. So sudden had been the attack, so instantaneous
                  the release, that Moreland was hardly conscious how it had been effected, till the
                  sight of Paul, standing with dilated nostrils and panting chest over the fallen
                  giant, and brandishing with both hands a massy rail, which had been lying at the
                  foot of the grave, made him aware, who his deliverer was.</p>
               <p>"Let me kill 'em, massa—let me kill 'em," cried Paul, swinging the rail above his
                  head, and planting his foot on the broad breast of the rebel.</p>
               <p>"Stop!" cried Moreland; "in the name of God, stop! He may be dead already! Let him
                  be carried to the guard-house and there taken care of. Give him in charge to the
                  overseer. "</p>
               <p>Four of the stoutest negroes sprang forward, eager to show their recovered zeal
                  and loyalty, and lifted up the heavy mass of insensible flesh, which they would
                  have beaten to jelly in their indignation, so powerful was the reaction of their
                  feelings.</p>
               <p>"Paul," said Moreland, holding out his hand, "true and faithful servant yet! Let
                  the past be forgotten, or remembered only to forgive!"</p>
               <p>"Oh! dear massa!" cried Paul, dropping the rail, and throwing his arms round
                  Moreland's shoulders, he wept<pb n="210-211" xml:id="VAC6695-00000111"/> and
                  sobbed like a child,—"you're safe and alive yet! Bless a Lord Almighty! Paul's
                  heart always was right, but he got a mighty poor head of hisn."</p>
               <p>When Moreland seemed under the ruffian grasp of Vulcan, the women uttered the most
                  terrible screams; but wilder and more piercing than all the rest was the shriek
                  that issued from the portico, that commanded a full view of the scene. Eulalia and
                  Ildegerte, who were standing with arms interlaced, gassing on what to them was an
                  exciting pantomime, for they could not hear one syllable of what was uttered,
                  beheld the giant leaping on his master, and believed it the signal of death. How
                  they reached there they knew not, for the place was at some distance from the
                  house,—but they found themselves forcing their way through the ring just as Paul
                  was weeping on his master's shoulder.</p>
               <p>"All is safe!" cried Moreland, as they threw themselves into his arms, clinging to
                  him in an agony of emotion—"all is well! Look up, my Eula! Sister, be not afraid;
                  it is all over! Here is Paul, who is ready to die in my defence. "</p>
               <p>"Me too, master!" cried Albert, with glistening eyes; "Paul struck 'fore I got a
                  chance, or I would have killed him!"</p>
               <p>The little golden-brown head of the infant Russell was seen peeping behind the
                  ring, like a sunbeam playing on the cloud-edge. Kizzie, nearly distracted, had
                  pressed as close as possible to the scene of action, after the terrible rebel was
                  secured; and the infant, excited by the tumult, clapped its cherub hands, and
                  glanced its beautiful hazel eyes from face to face with <choice>
                     <sic>innoceut</sic>
                     <corr>innocent</corr>
                  </choice> curiosity.</p>
               <p>"Bring that child here," said Moreland; and Albert, springing forward, bore it in
                  triumph over the woolly heads between, to his master's extended arms.</p>
               <p>"This child," said he, raising it aloft in its smiling beauty, "is your future
                  master. With its first lessons of obedience to his parents and love to his God, he
                  shall be taught his duties to you, and yours to him. Born and brought up in your
                  midst, he will learn to regard you as a part of his own life and soul. I trust,
                  with the blessing of God, he will live to be a better, wiser, kinder master than I
                  have ever been, and watch over your children's interests when I am laid low in the
                  grave. "</p>
               <p>The infant, delighted with its elevated position, laughed in its glee, while the
                  negroes gazed upon both father and child as beings of a superior world.</p>
               <p>The admiration, love, and devotion which the negro feels for the children of a
                  beloved master, is one of the strongest, most unselfish passions the human heart
                  is capable of cherishing. The partition wall of colour is broken down. The sable
                  arms are privileged to wreathe the neck of snow, the dusky lips to press soft
                  kisses on the cheek of living roses. And, though, in after years, the child feels
                  the barrier of distinction drawn by the<pb n="212-213" xml:id="VAC6695-00000112"/>
                  Creator's hand, in infancy it clings with instinctive affection to the dark bosom
                  that nurses it, and sees only the loving heart through the black and sooty skin.
                  If such are the feelings which infancy usually inspires, it is not strange that
                  the child of such a master as Moreland should be an object of idolatry, for,
                  notwithstanding they had been tempted from their allegiance by the irresistible
                  arts of Brainard, the principles of strong affection and undying loyalty existed
                  in their hearts, and now throbbed with renovated vitality—with the exception of
                  the fierce and rebellious artisan. His was one of those animal natures which,
                  having had a scent of blood in the breeze, snuffed it with savage delight, and,
                  being baffled of its prey, revenged itself for its unslaked thirst in roars of
                  defiance and deeds of violence. He was now, however, incapable of inflicting
                  farther injury. The well-aimed blow of Paul, though not mortal, had caused a
                  terrible concussion in his system, from which he was likely long to suffer; and he
                  was also strongly guarded.</p>
               <p>That night the deepest tranquillity brooded over the plantation. The stormy
                  elements were hushed; the late troubled waters subsided into a peaceful yet
                  tremulous expanse. Eula, exhausted by the agitation of the several preceding days,
                  slept as quietly as the babe that rested on her bosom. But no sleep visited the
                  wakeful eyes of Moreland. He went abroad into the stillness, the solemnity and
                  loneliness of night, and beyond the clear and illimitable moonlight, he looked
                  into the darkening future. The clouds of the preceding night were all swept away,
                  and the moon glided, slowly, majestically, radiantly over the blue and boundless
                  firmament, a solitary bark of silver navigating the unfathomable ocean of ether.
                  Moreland walked through the long rows of cabins, whose whitewashed walls
                  reflected, with intense brightness, the light that illumined, them, and envied the
                  repose of the occupants. The signs of the times were dark, and portentous of
                  disunion and ruin. The lightnings might be sheathed, but they were ready, at any
                  moment, to rend the cloud and dart their fiery bolts around. Supposing, for one
                  moment, the full triumph of fanaticism, how fearful would be the result! The
                  emancipation of brute force; the reign of animal passion and power; the wisdom of
                  eighteen centuries buried under waves of barbarism, rolling back upon the world;
                  the beautiful cotton-fields of the South left neglected and overgrown with weeds;
                  the looms of the North idle for want of the downy fleece, and England, in all her
                  pride and might, bleeding from the wound her own hands had inflicted. None but the
                  native of a tropic zone, physically constructed to endure the heat of a Southern
                  clime, can cultivate its soil and raise its staple products. That the African,
                     <emph>unguided by the white man's influence,</emph> would suffer the fairest
                  portions of God's earth to become uncultivated wildernesses, let St.<pb
                     n="214-215" xml:id="VAC6695-00000113"/> Domingo, Jamaica, and the emancipated
                  islands bear witness. Suppose the triumph of fanaticism, agriculture would
                  inevitably languish and die; the negro, as well as the white man would not only
                  sink into an abyss of poverty and ruin, but the withered energies, the decaying
                  commerce, and expiring manufactures of the North would show the interests of the
                  two different sections of our common country to be connected by as vital a
                  ligament as that which unites the twin-born brothers of Siam. Let the death-stroke
                  pierce the bosom of one, the other must, soon become a livid and putrifying
                  corpse.</p>
               <p>If it be God's will that our country, so long the boast and glory of the
                     <unclear>age</unclear>, should become its byword and reproach; if the Genius of
                  America is to be driven from her mountain heights into the dens and caves of
                  earth, weeping over her banner insulted, its stars <choice>
                     <sic>extintinguished</sic>
                     <corr>extinguished</corr>
                  </choice>, its stripes rent asunder, with none left to vindicate its rights; if
                  the beauty, order, and moral discipline of society are to be resolved into the
                  gloom and darkness of chaos, the silver chords of brotherhood snapped asunder, and
                  the golden bowl of union for ever broken:—if it be God's will, let man lay his
                  hand upon his mouth, and his mouth in the dust, and say,</p>
               <p>"It is good!"</p>
               <p>But let him beware of mistaking the traces of human weakness and passion for the
                  stately footprints of the Almighty, lest the Lord come in judgment and avenge his
                  insulted majesty!</p>
               <p>Such were the thoughts that banished sleep from the eyes of Moreland, and sent him
                  abroad, a nocturnal wanderer, in the holy splendour of the night. His feet
                  involuntarily turned to the blacksmith's shop. It was a lonely path that led to
                  it, and, just before it reached the building, a dense thicket of pines made an
                  impervious shade, black and heavy by contrast with the beams beyond. While he was
                  passing through the shadows, and about to emerge into the light, he saw the figure
                  of a man stealing cautiously round the shop and approaching the door. A low,
                  distinct knock was heard, repeated at intervals. He was sure, from the outline,
                  that it was the form of Brainard, and he could see that it was the face of a white
                  man. His first impulse to rush forward and seize him,—his next, to watch his
                  farther motions. Stepping very cautiously, and looking round at every step, the
                  figure went to the pile of brushwood we described in a former chapter, and removed
                  it from the excavation. Stooping down and groping his way under, he disappeared,
                  while Moreland, accelerating his steps, reached the spot before he had time to
                  emerge again into the light. He could hear distinctly the clinking of steel under
                  the house, and wondered if the man had engaged some subterranean knight in
                  conflict. An old door, broken from its hinges, lay upon the ground. Moreland
                  raised it as noiselessly as possible, and putting<pb n="216-217"
                     xml:id="VAC6695-00000114"/> it up against the opening, planted his foot firmly
                  against it,—thus making the man, whoever he was, his prisoner. The sudden
                  darkening of the moonlight, which streamed in under the building, made the
                  intruder aware of his situation, and he came rushing against the barrier with
                  headlong force; the planks vibrated and cracked, but Moreland stood his ground,
                  firm as a rock.</p>
               <p>"Vulcan, Vulcan! is it you? For God's sake, let me out! It is I! Don't you know my
                  voice?" It was the voice of Brainard,—not the sweet music he was accustomed to
                  breathe from the pulpit, but the sharp, quick, startled accents of fear.</p>
               <p>"Excuse me, Mr. Brainard," said Moreland; and a proud smile curled his lip at the
                  ridiculous and humiliating position of his enemy. "I hope you do not find yourself
                  uncomfortable! I was not aware that you had lodgings there before; but I believe
                  you are fond of subterranean works!"</p>
               <p>"Mr. Moreland," exclaimed Brainard, "it is not possible that it is you who are
                  opposing my egress? Is this the treatment that one gentleman has a right to expect
                  from another?"</p>
               <p>"Gentleman!" repeated Moreland, in an accent of withering sarcasm; "coward!
                  traitor! knave! too vile for indignation, too low for contempt! Come forth, and
                  meet me face to face, if you dare! Rise, if you are not too grovelling to assume
                  the attitude of a man!"</p>
               <p>Removing his foot from the door, it fell forward, and the moon again shining into
                  the aperture, revealed the prone and abject form of the pretended minister.
                  Crawling a few steps on his hands and knees, he rose slowly, for his limbs were
                  cramped and stiff, and shook the earth-soil from his garments. His face was now
                  directly opposite Moreland; and from his blue, half-closed eyes, the unsheathing
                  daggers of hatred and revenge were furtively gleaming.</p>
               <p>"What are you doing here?" asked Moreland, sternly, "stealing round my premises at
                  the midnight hour, burrowing like a wild beast in the earth, after having fled
                  like a coward at my approach, to avoid the consequences of detected perfidy?"</p>
               <p>"I have been on my Master's business," he answered, looking upward. "I am not
                  accountable to any man, being amenable to a higher law."</p>
               <p>"Hypocrite!" exclaimed Moreland, his dark eyes flashing with indignation, "away
                  with this vile cant! Throw aside the cloak with which you have tried in vain to
                  cover your iniquitous plots! Everything is discovered. If you were seen now in the
                  city whose hospitality you have so wantonly abused, you would fall a sacrifice to
                  the vengeance of an incensed community. We are safe, thank Heaven, from your
                  incendiary purposes; but what can save you, bare and exposed as you are, from the
                  hands of an outraged public?"</p>
               <p>Brainard was in such a position that it was impossible for him to escape. On one
                  side was a jutting beam, an<pb n="218-219" xml:id="VAC6695-00000115"/> abutment of
                  the building; on the other, the pile of brushwood he had thrown aside; before him,
                  the proud, resolute form, and commanding glance of the man he had deceived and
                  attempted to destroy. By what subterfuge could he now elude the doom he had
                  brought upon himself?</p>
               <p>"Mr. Moreland," said he, "I have sat at your board, slept in your bed, and broken
                  bread at your table. Even the wild Arab will protect the stranger who has partaken
                  of his hospitality. Will you, a Christian, do less than he?"</p>
               <p>"Yes; you have done all this," replied his host. "I know it but too well. You have
                  slept in my bed that you might strew it with thorns. You have broken my bread that
                  you might infuse into it poison and death. It is my duty as a Christian to
                  incapacitate you for the perpetration of new crimes."</p>
               <p>"I may have been carried farther than I intended," said he, in an humble, adjuring
                  tone; "but it was not for myself I was labouring. I have been made the agent of
                  others, whose cause I embraced with premature ardour. I have been misled by false
                  misrepresentations, to adopt a course which I now sincerely regret. A candid man,
                  Mr. Moreland, would require no other apology."</p>
               <p>"False as cowardly!" answered Moreland. "If you are the tool of a party, it only
                  aggravates your meanness. There may be those who are degraded enough to employ a
                  wretch like you, as an instrument to work the downfall of the South; but, if so,
                  they must be the lowest dregs of society. There may be men, and women too, for I
                  have heard of such,—but I do not believe there is a respectable down or village in
                  the Northern States that would not consider itself disgraced by your conduct, and
                  blush for the opprobrium which you have brought upon their name. I have travelled
                  in the North,—I know the spirit of the times; but I know, too, that there is a
                  conservative principle there, that would protect us from aggression, and itself
                  from ignominy."</p>
               <p>"It matters not whose agent I am," said Brainard, bitterly. "I see I am at your
                  mercy. Yet, if you will suffer me to depart in peace, I will pledge my solemn word
                  to leave this part of the country, immediately and for ever."</p>
               <p>"What faith can be put in promises like yours? No, sir! The day of blind
                  confidence is past. I arrest you by virtue of a warrant which I bear about me.
                  Come with me, till better accommodations are provided for you at the public
                  expense."</p>
               <p>Even while speaking these words, Moreland was conscious of great perplexity, for
                  he knew of no place of security but the guard-house, where Vulcan was already
                  imprisoned, where he could put the arch-traitor. It is true, Vulcan was now in no
                  situation to be influenced by his insidious arts, but he did not like their
                     juxtaposition<pb n="220-221" xml:id="VAC6695-00000116"/> position. Another
                  thing, it was considerably distant from the blacksmith's shop, and it would be no
                  easy task to conduct a desperate and infuriated man to that place of confinement.
                  Still, he must not be suffered to escape, so, laying a firm hand on his shoulder,
                  he commanded him to follow him. Quick as a flash of thought, Brainard drew a bowie
                  knife from his bosom with his free right hand, and made a plunge at Moreland's
                  breast. Moreland saw the steel glittering in the moonlight, and the next moment
                  might hare been his last, but, throwing his assailant back with a violent jerk,
                  the stroke glanced in the air. This was the commencement of a life-struggle,
                  fierce and bloodthirsty on one side, bold, firm, and unrelaxing on the other. One
                  could hear the gritting of Brainard's grinding teeth, as he tried to release
                  himself from the clenching grasp of his antagonist. Moreland was armed, for, at
                  this time of threatened insurrection, every man was provided with defensive
                  weapons, but, instead of drawing his own, his object was to get possession of
                  Brainard's knife. Had he released his hold one second, his life might have been
                  the sacrifice. Once or twice he felt the sharp steel gashing his left arm, but he
                  heeded it not, and once, in warding off a deadly blow at his heart, he turned the
                  point of the knife and it plunged in Brainard's right arm—the arm which wielded
                  the destructive weapon. Moreland, after the first moment of exasperation and
                  excitement, did not want to kill him, but to defend himself self, and incapacitate
                  him from further mischief. The knife dropped from Brainard's powerless hand, and
                  the blood spouted from the wound. Moreland, well knowing it was not a mortal
                  stroke, and that his left hand still had power, snatched the knife from the ground
                  and sheathed it in the folds of his vest. The blood was flowing from his own
                  wounds, but, without heeding it, he bound his handkerchief round Brainard's arm,
                  who had reeled as if fainting, against the walls of the shop. He looked very pale,
                  but Moreland could plainly see that it was not the death-like paleness preceding a
                  swoon. Still, he did not like to drag him, in that situation to the guard-house,
                  and, enfeebled as he was, he believed he could leave him in the shop with safety,
                  while he went to rouse the overseer and some of the strongest hands, to assist in
                  guarding him, and he himself obtained proper materials to dress his wound. The
                  door of the shop was usually locked at this hour, but, in consequence of Vulcan's
                  arrest, who had the charge of it, the key was left hanging in the padlock—a
                  circumstance fortunate for Moreland's design. The wooden windows were barred
                  inside, and Vulcan, while prosecuting his midnight labours, had added iron
                  staples, as a greater security from intrusion. Had Brainard not been disabled by
                  his wound, Moreland would not have dared to have enclosed him, even for a brief
                  time, in a place where the weapons of deliverance might be found in the massy iron
                  tools of the blacksmith; but he well<pb n="222-223" xml:id="VAC6695-00000117"/>
                  knew that the arm, whose reeking blood had already dyed his handkerchief, could
                  not wield the ponderous sledge-hammer or the iron bars.</p>
               <p>"Come," said he, taking him by the left arm, "come into the shop, while I go for
                  linen and balsam to dress your wound. I presume it is not the first time that you
                  have found shelter in its walls."</p>
               <p>"Bring none of your linen and balsam for me," he answered, "I'll none of it. Put
                  me where you please, it makes no difference; I scorn and defy your power!"</p>
               <p>Though he spoke in a faint voice, it was expressive of malignity and revenge. He
                  no longer resisted, however, and Moreland, drawing rather than leading him round
                  to the front side of the shop, opened the door, sprang upon the threshold with his
                  prisoner, then releasing him suddenly, he sprang back, closed and locked the door,
                  and returning to the rear of the building, examined the shutters on the
                  outside.—It would not do to leave them without some barrier, for Brainard might
                  remove the inner bar with his left hand, and leap from the window. There were two
                  large posts lying on the ground, which seemed left there for his peculiar purpose,
                  and though it required an exertion of strength to lift them, with his left arm
                  weakened and painful as it was, he did it with astonishing celerity, and steadying
                  the lower ends against the old fallen tree, suffered the upper ones to fall
                  heavily upon the shutters, just below the jutting of the wood-piece nailed across
                  them, and in this position every effort to open the windows would only make the
                  posts more firm in their resistance.</p>
               <p>"That will do," said Moreland, turning away, and directing his steps towards the
                  overseer's dwelling-house. With an involuntary impulse, he drew forth the knife
                  concealed in his bosom, and suffered the moonlight to gleam upon it. Half of it
                  was stained with blood, the other half shone cold and blue, with deadly lustre, in
                  the serene glory of the night. He shuddered at the temptation he had momentarily
                  felt, to bury it in the false heart of Brainard, and blessed his guardian angel
                  for covering the edge of the weapon with his interposing wings.</p>
               <p>The chivalry of his nature had received a painful, wound. He had discharged an
                  imperative duty, but in a manner revolting to the magnanimity of his character. He
                  had felt his cheek burn, while turning the key of that black sooty prison on a
                  wounded enemy. Had he known that Brainard was familiar with even more gloomy
                  walls, that, even when a boy, he had made his bed on the dungeon's floor, and worn
                  the felon's badge of ignominy, he would have been less fastidious with regard to
                  his accommodations.</p>
               <p>Having awakened the overseer, and told him to rouse immediately several of the
                  stoutest negroes, including Uncle Paul, and repair to the shop, which they were to
                  guard during the remainder of the night; he began to feel the necessity of having
                  his own wounds attended to,—<pb n="224-225" xml:id="VAC6695-00000118"/> though not
                  deep, the flowing of the unstanched blood, and the straining of the muscles in
                  barricading the shutters, made him feel weak and nerveless. He therefore
                  commissioned the overseer to act as leech, as well as guard, and sought his own
                  dwelling.</p>
               <p>Fearing to awake his wife, and alarm her by the sight of his blood-stained
                  garments, he entered with noiseless steps, and the faint, soft, regular breathing
                  that met his ear gave him a sensation of exquisite repose. Eulalia still slept,
                  and the babe still slumbered on her bosom. Again the image of the virgin mother
                  and the infant Jesus rose before him, as when he had knelt by her, when reclining
                  over the cradle of her son. And once more he knelt, but without awakening her, and
                  commended them both to the God of the South as well as the North,—"to the Monarch,
                  and Maker, and Saviour of all!"</p>
               <p>"Ah, my sweet wife!" thought he, when, rising from his knees, he looked down upon
                  her with unutterable tenderness, "you are paying a sad penalty for the love that
                  lured you from your quiet village home. Better had it been for you had I left you
                  near the shadow of that temple where your seraph voice first waked the slumbering
                  music of my heart."</p>
               <p>For a moment he had forgotten his arm, and the blood-stains on his dress; but a
                  stiff, painful feeling reminded him of the past conflict, and, with the same
                  noiseless steps with which he had entered, he left his own room, and, seeking the
                  one where Albert slept, committed himself to his healing hands.</p>
               <p>In the mean time Brainard was not idle. When left by Moreland in the grim retreat
                  with which he had made himself so familiar, he stood at first perfectly still, in
                  the centre of the shop, where the momentum given by Moreland's releasing arm had
                  sent him. It was not utterly dark, for silvers of moonshine penetrated the chinks
                  of the boards, and fell on the blackened planks. He looked round him, straightened
                  himself up to his full height, and shook his left arm in defiance, as if facing an
                  invisible enemy.</p>
               <p>"Fool!" he muttered. "He did not know he was dealing with an ambidextrous man.
                  There is as much cunning in this hand as in that. Does he think these, drops of
                  blood have weakened me so that I cannot burst these bars and free myself from his
                  power? Ha, ha! I played the part of a fainting man to put him off his guard; but I
                  have strength enough yet to perform a good night's work. These shutters are
                  nothing but old boards. I'll soon shiver them. I'll hurl them into fragments. Yes,
                  yes! if the morning find me a prisoner here, may I hang from the gibbet, and the
                  fowls of heaven feed upon my carcass!"</p>
               <p>Guided by the light of the silver bars on the floor, he seized the sledgehammer
                  with his left hand, and, swinging it high in air, brought it down upon the shutter
                  with a tremendous blow. There was a jarring and rattling<pb n="226-227"
                     xml:id="VAC6695-00000119"/> of boards, and a cloud of black dust, but
                  Moreland's strong barrier resisted the effort.</p>
               <p>"Death and fury!" he exclaimed; "are the boards lignum vitæ? I'll try the door. If
                  I cannot break that open, I'll spill my own brains on these planks!"</p>
               <p>Swinging the huge hammer once more, he hurled it against the door with maniac
                  force. Ha! it does begin to yield. Bravo! strike again. They hear your blows, to
                  be sure, but they think the horses are pounding and kicking in the stable, as they
                  are wont to do. Strike again; a desperate man can do anything. No matter if every
                  stroke makes the blood ooze from your wounded veins, and the sultry sweat-drops
                  gush from your pores. There! don't you see the hinges strain, tug, crack, and at
                  length give way with a sudden crash. Jump through! the avengers are coming. Make
                  haste! they are in the dark path now. Remember <emph>you</emph> are in the
                  moonlight.</p>
               <p>Yes! Brainard did remember all this, and he leaped through the opening with
                  supernatural agility, flew, rather than ran to the stable, mounted the fleetest
                  horse, and cut the air like the arrow. He was seen, just as he reached the stable,
                  by the party appointed to be his guard. Paul, who seemed to have the vigour and
                  fire of youth miraculously restored, shouted till the thicket reverberated the
                  sound, and rushed after him, his long limbs sweeping over the ground like forked
                  lightning. The overseer and other negroes followed, but they could not begin to
                  keep up with the streaking steps of Paul. As he reached the stable Brainard leaped
                  into the road. Paul was on the back of Swiftsure, one of his master's strongest,
                  fleetest horses, with the quickness of thought, and away he went in pursuit of the
                  fugitive.</p>
               <p>"Good Lord!" cried Paul, "let me only catch 'em! Just let massa know what Paul can
                  do for him! Go it, go it, Swiftshur!—wide awake! wide awake!—keep a eye
                  open!—stretch a feet apart!—that the way to go!"</p>
               <p>Paul lay almost horizontally on the barebacked animal, grasping his mane for a
                  bridle, his body thrown up and down by the violence of the motion. Brainard had
                  saddle and bridle, for he was on the same horse which had been caparisoned to bear
                  him from the plantation, just before Moreland's arrival. The odds were in his
                  favour, and he knew it. His scornful laugh was driven back into Paul's face, like
                  a dash of cold water. Once he reeled in the saddle, and his speed perceptibly
                  slackened, and the shadow of his pursuer appeared to be leaping on his back; but
                  just as Paul stretched out his long arm, thinking him within reach, he shot ahead,
                  with dizzying velocity, and Paul grasped a handful of moonbeams. It was all in
                  vain. As he told his master the next day—"The devil was in him, and one might as
                  well try to catch hold of a streak of lightning."</p>
               <p>All the time Brainard was winging his way, thought, swifter than his flight, was
                  darting in his mind, bringing<pb n="228-229" xml:id="VAC6695-00000120"/> messages
                  from the future, that lit up his countenance with vindictive joy.</p>
               <p>"Oh! I have a glorious career before me," said he to himself, dashing his spurs
                  into his horse's smoking flanks,—for he had equipped himself like a knight when he
                  started on his midnight expedition. "I have planned it all—and when did I ever
                  plan without executing? Who says I have failed? I tell you, you lie, sir. I have
                  made a plenty of dupes. The flames I have kindled will not be quenched. They will
                  burst out afresh, when people think they are gazing on ashes. Yes! I will go back
                  to the North, and deliver such lectures on the South as will curdle the blood with
                  horror. No matter what I say—I'll find fools to believe it all. If I pour
                  falsehoods hot as molten lead down their throats, they will believe them all, and
                  smack their lips with delight. Take care, Master Moreland! the devil shall be an
                  angel of light compared to the foul demon I will represent you to be—you, and all
                  your tribe. Thank Heaven for the gift of eloquence! Oh! I'll rave of blood-marked
                  chains, of flesh torn from the body with red-hot pincers, of children roasted
                  alive, of women burned at the stake! They'll believe it all! The more horrors I
                  manufacture the more ecstasy they will feel! Curses on the arm that failed to
                  pierce <emph>his</emph> heart's core! Curses on <emph>him</emph> for every drop of
                  blood he has drawn! But I'll have my revenge!—a glorious revenge!—ha! ha!"</p>
               <p>Away with him! Close the shutters of that workshop of Satan—his breast. We shudder
                  at the glimpses revealed. Let him go, and fill up the measure of his iniquity:
                  brimming as it now seems, it is not quite full. The crowning drop must be blacker
                  than all.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER X.</head>
               <p>IT cannot be said that Moreland regretted the flight of Brainard. Detected villany
                  is no longer to be feared.</p>
               <p>The threatened insurrection had been proclaimed trumpet-tongued through the state,
                  and guards everywhere appointed to watch over the public safety. A minute
                  description of his person was published in all the papers, so that none might
                  unwittingly receive the traitor as a guest. Though Moreland was convinced that he
                  was an impostor, he addressed letters to the Conference to which he professed to
                  belong, making inquiries respecting his standing as a minister. The answer denied
                  any knowledge of a person by the name of Brainard. There was no minister belonging
                  to their Conference or denomination of that name. They did not hesitate to
                  pronounce him a vile impostor.</p>
               <p>Mr. Hastings also affirmed, in his letters, that he knew nothing of such an
                  individual, relieving his daughter's mind of an unspeakable weight. He could not
                  account for his familiarity with the names of his household, but by supposing he
                  had passed through the village, and made himself acquainted, by report, with its
                  principal inhabitants,—a supposition which was founded on truth. The agitation he
                  had caused in the domestic circle and in the public mind gradually subsided, and
                  the peace he had disturbed once more settled on the community. The negroes were
                  pardoned, as their ringleader was white, but put under a stricter discipline.
                  Having so shamefully abused their religious privileges, they were restricted in
                  their nightly meetings, which were no longer allowed to be kept up beyond the
                  ringing of the nine o'clock bell. The midnight hour, which was the scene of their
                  unhallowed orgies was constantly guarded, and no night passed without the scrutiny
                  of the vigilant patrole within the walls of their cabins.</p>
               <p>The domestic establishment of Moreland resumed its usual peaceful and cheerful
                  aspect. Jim and Crissy were seen, as formerly, unfurling the contents of the big
                  chest to the morning sunshine, and Kizzie's countenance rejoiced once more in its
                  former expression of consequential good-nature. Eulalia began to look upon the
                  past as a frightful dream, and to enjoy, without fear of molestation, the comforts
                  of her Southern home. There was one circumstance which she considered a blessing;
                  for she never could think of Vulcan, the blacksmith, without horror and dread. As
                  soon as he had recovered from the effects of the blow, and, after humbling
                     himself<pb n="232-233" xml:id="VAC6695-00000122"/> self before his master, been
                  released from imprisonment, he absconded, stealing, in imitation of his
                  illustrious predecessor, one of his master's finest horses, and baffling the
                  vigilance of pursuit.</p>
               <p>"I am glad he is gone!" cried Moreland, when the tidings of his flight reached his
                  ears; "for I never could have had any reliance on, his fidelity, any confidence in
                  his truth. He was an excellent workman, and, as far as labour is concerned, a
                  great pecuniary loss to me, but he seemed to cast a dark shadow over the
                  plantation, which I rejoice to have rolled away. I suspect he will soon be
                     <emph>lionized</emph> at the North, as one of those poor, injured, persecuted
                  beings, escaped from Southern tyranny to throw themselves in the expanded arms of
                  Northern philanthropy. Brainard may become his keeper, and tell to a gaping
                  multitude the story of his sufferings. When Vulcan was a little boy, a negro about
                  his own age, who was playing with an axe, chopped off two of the fingers of his
                  left hand, and he has the scar of a terrible burn on his shoulder. The mutilated
                  hand may be shown as the mark by which a Southern planter identifies his slaves,
                  and the scar as the brand of his cruelty. Mark my words, Eula, and see if I am not
                  a true prophet."</p>
               <p>Eula remembered her father's giant protege and blushed.</p>
               <p>Before we dismiss this era in our history, we ought, in justice to the intrepid
                  wife of the jailer, to mention the manner in which the grateful public manifested
                  their appreciation of her services. When told by a friend that she was to be
                  presented with a splendid silver waited, on which the prison scene, of which she
                  was the heroine, was to be wrought in bas relief, she remarked, with her usual
                  sound, practical good sense—</p>
               <p>"I don't want them to give me anything, for I've done nothing but my duty—I would
                  despise the woman that would do less—and least of all, a silver waiter. It would
                  shame my homely furniture; and be as much out of place as if I should stick a
                  crown on my head. If they would send my boy to a first-rate school, that would be
                  something to be grateful for."</p>
               <p>In consequence of this hint, the silver streams of knowledge were poured into the
                  boy's mind, and his education continued at the public expense.</p>
               <p>Eula hailed the opening spring with anticipations of delight. She was looking
                  forward to a visit to her Northern home, and almost every thought and feeling had
                  reference to that joyous event. She watched the unfolding charms of her beautiful
                  boy with a jealous eye, fearing one infantile beauty might fleet, before the eyes
                  of her parents could gaze upon its loveliness. She talked to Effie of her sweet
                  little sister, Dora, as her playmate and companion, forgetting that three passing
                  years had added considerable dignity to the five-year-old child, who used to call
                  her sister-mother. She opened her casket of love-tokens, and spread them in<pb
                     n="234-235" xml:id="VAC6695-00000123"/> fond review before her, thus reviving,
                  in all their early freshness, the associations of her youth:—the faded flowers she
                  had pressed; even the humble Ironing-holder and modest comb-case, which had been
                  carefully preserved; and, more precious than all, poor Nancy's heart-shaped
                  breast-pin, containing a lock of her long raven hair.</p>
               <p>"I fear I am selfish," said she to her husband, grateful for his animated sympathy
                  in all her anticipations. "You can look forward with no such joy as mine. I fear
                  even that the journey may be painful to you, from recent associations."</p>
               <p>"You are mistaken," he replied, "I shall revisit with delight the beautiful
                  village of your birth. I never can forget the kindness I received, as a stranger,
                  when I was lying sick and apparently dying there. There was no cold Levite passing
                  the other side: all were ministering Samaritans, whom I bless in remembrance. Your
                  excellent pastor—how I long to clasp his venerable hand once more! that hand which
                  I last saw placed so tenderly on the head of my kneeling bride! My friend, the
                  bridge architect, I respect as a high-minded and most honourable gentleman; and
                  good Mrs. Grimby will recede from me a most cordial greeting. You need not think
                  of appropriating to yourself all the joy, leaving me nothing but self-sacrifice to
                  'console me. But there is one thing, my dear Eula, that we must not forget. You
                  know we are going quite strong in number, and people are not accustomed, at the
                  North, to visit in caravans, as we do. My sister, who will accompany us, has no
                  claims on the hospitality of your home. Nay, let me finish my declamation. Our
                  little Effie is another interloper. Then, two servants, my own inseparable shadow,
                  and the nurse to the honourable heir of the house of Moreland, will make in
                  addition a goodly company."</p>
               <p>"I was thinking I had better not take a nurse," said Eula. "Ildegerte's experience
                  has intimidated me."</p>
               <p>"It should rather give you courage. There is no danger of any of them being
                  induced to follow Crissy's example. Netty, who is now the wife of Albert, may go,
                  in place of Kizzie, whose ample person is something of an encumbrance to a
                  trailer. I do not intend that you shall endure the fatigue of a mother's cares
                  unassisted, or that your parents shall be burdened with the expense of our family
                  during our long summer visit. The fatted calf and golden ring of welcome will be
                  ours; let this trifle" (putting a folded paper in Eula's hand) "be theirs. Coming
                  from you as a filial offering, they will not shrink from receiving it. Do not
                  blush, my Eula. Is not all mine thine, and all yours theirs, if occasion requires
                  the appropriation? Had I millions to pour into their coffers, I never could repay
                  them the countless debt I owe."</p>
               <p>"Flatterer!" exclaimed Eula, smiling through glistening tears. "Is not mine the
                  debt, and shall not my<pb n="236-237" xml:id="VAC6695-00000124"/> life repay it?
                  How kindly, how generously and considerately do you relieve me of every anxiety! I
                  well know that my father's means are limited; and the fear of drawing too largely
                  on his resources has been the only drawback to my joyous anticipations. How can I
                  do justice to my grateful heart?"</p>
               <p>"Hush, my wife; never, never speak of gratitude to me. If I could be angry with
                  you, it would make me so."</p>
               <p>Kizzie would have been greatly mortified at being superseded by the young and airy
                  Netty, had not Eula told her most truly that she could not leave the care of the
                  household in any other hands than hers. Dicey was too aged to take the
                  superintendence; Crissy too delicate in health, and Judy entirely too ignorant.
                  They had lately received a valuable addition to the household establishment.
                  Moreland, in accordance with the dying wishes of Davy, had sent for his wife and
                  daughters, by a gentleman who was then travelling to the North. They had arrived,
                  and were now members of his family. He had offered to settle them in a dwelling of
                  their own, where they could be entirely independent, but they pleaded so earnestly
                  to remain with him, that he could not refuse. This was a perplexing circumstance
                  to him; for, notwithstanding the husband's and father's legacy, he looked upon
                  them as free, and resolved never to be personally benefited by their labours, or
                  to appropriate to himself the property bequeathed to him. He could make no
                  distinction in his treatment of them, however, and they seemed to desire none.
                  Davy was now dead. His last injunction to them was, to place themselves under the
                  protection of Master Moreland.</p>
               <p>This is a remarkable fact, and, if placed in the scales of justice, might outweigh
                  a thousand exaggerated statements of oppression and cruelty. But prejudice is
                  stronger than iron, more heavy than lead, more sounding than brass,—opposed to its
                  weight, the deeds of an angel would be as down in the balance; the ordinations of
                  Heaven but as dust. Its trumpet-cry to the sons of men is, "Tekel, Tekel! thou art
                  weighed in the balance and found wanting!" Is there no invisible handwriting on
                  the walls of its conscience? Is there not a greater than Daniel to interpret the
                  mystic characters?</p>
               <p>At length the time appointed for the departure of the travellers arrived, and with
                  it all the customary bustle and preparation. We have intimated before, that our
                  good friend Kizzie was a very bustling body, and fond of creating a breeze
                  wherever she moved. Now, when she was about to be left, with a charge scarcely
                  inferior, in her estimation, to the seven churches of Asia, it is not strange that
                  she should make her responsibilities known.</p>
               <p>"Yes! mistress," said she,—enumerating a few of her duties to Eula, with emphatic
                  gesticulations,—"I shall have a heap of things to see to; but you'll find I've
                  taken an obligation of the whole. There'll be the<pb n="238-239"
                     xml:id="VAC6695-00000125"/> pickles to make, the vegetables to be gathered, the
                  peaches to dry, and the preserves, and jellies, and catchups to be put up; the
                  watermillion rinds to be cut into citron; Master's winter clothes to be aired, so
                  that the moths can't get in 'em, and your winter ones too, mistress; the linen
                  aired, the carpets taken up, and the picter frames converted with muslin, to keep
                  the fly-specs off. The curtains must be taken down, too, for they needn't be
                  wasting themselves on nobody but niggers!"</p>
               <p>"You will really have a hard time, Kizzie," said Eula, compassionately, while
                  Moreland laughed at Kizzie's tremendous vocabulary.</p>
               <p>"You had better let Jim and Crissy do the airing part," said he; "they understand
                  it by this time."</p>
               <p>"I tell you, mistress," said Kizze,—after honouring her master's remark with a
                  respectful laugh,—"the hardest part of all is to part with little master. I love
                  little missy, but your baby has got the nighest place in my heart. It goes mighty
                  hard, mistress, to gin him up. If anything should happen, and you never bring him
                  back no more!—"</p>
               <p>"Don't, Kizzie!—don't!"</p>
               <p>"I can't help it, mistress!" cried she, beginning to sob, while she hugged the
                  beautiful boy in her arms, and pressed her cheek on its silky hair; "things is so
                  unsartin in this world, and children's lives are nothing but spiders' webs, any
                  way! Lord Almighty bless you, honey sweet baby! and keep you a burning and a
                  shining when Kizzie's candle done need no more snuffing!"</p>
               <p>Eula could not help being affected by the grief of the demonstrative Kizzie; and
                  the young Russell seemed to appreciate, in its fullest sense, the affection of his
                  old nurse. He clung to her neck, refusing to unlock his loving hands, till
                  Moreland, with gentle firmness, withdrew him from her arms, and gave him in charge
                  to the waiting Netty.</p>
               <p>"You must not forget me, either, mammy!" said Effie, blowing kisses to her from
                  the carriage, where she had enthroned herself.</p>
               <p>"Bless your little heart, no!" cried the tender-hearted nurse, sobbing afresh.</p>
               <p>Ildegerte was very sad, for she remembered her last fruitless journey, and that
                  she was lonely now; but the bright and beautiful morning, the air fragrant with
                  the breath of opening roses, and the exhilaration of motion, soon produced a
                  reaction in the spirits of the travellers, and Ildegerte's sadness became
                  illuminated by the cheerfulness of her companions.</p>
               <p>While the travellers are pursuing their way rejoicing, we will turn to the
                  beautiful New England village, to which the reader was introduced in the early
                  pages of this history.</p>
               <p>How fresh and green and quiet it looks! Fresh as when baptized with the morning
                  dew of creation, it first<pb n="240-241" xml:id="VAC6695-00000126"/> reflected its
                  Maker's smile; green as when 'emerging from the waters of the deluge, the dove of
                  the ark hovered over its bosom. It was fair and beautiful three years ago; it is
                  fair and beautiful now. Scarcely one new building has been erected, one change
                  made to remind one of the insensible lapse of time. Mr. Grimby's sign, having an
                  eagle on one side, and Washington, prim and dim, on the other, swings majestically
                  in the wind, and the beautiful bridge constructed by Mr. Brooks, spans with its
                  graceful arch the river's azure volume. There stands the church, with its
                  glittering vane, and leaden dome, and snowy pillars, "looking tranquillity;"
                  yonder is the parsonage, embosomed in its consecrated shades; and here is the
                  well-known mansion, rising mid its grove of sycamore and mountain ash. Methinks it
                  looks younger and fairer than it did three years ago,—and well it may, for it has
                  just put on a new robe of paint, and the old green blinds have been rejuvenated
                  also. Let us peep in the inside, and see if it wears the same familiar aspect. The
                  painter's brush has been there likewise,—the ceiling is dazzling in its fresh,
                  unsoiled whitewash, and the walk papered and bordered anew. Everything is as fair
                  and smiling as a bride adorned for her husband.</p>
               <p>Ah! dear must be the daughter and sister for whose welcome even inanimate objects
                  thus renew and beautify themselves!</p>
               <p>Eulalia's expected return was indeed an era in the quiet, monotonous life of our
                  villagers. There was not a house whose inmates were not excited, in some degree,
                  by the anticipation. Even strangers, and there were a few, who had sought the
                  retirement of the valley, participated, through sympathy, with the all-pervading
                  feeling. If such was the general interest, what must have been the emotions of the
                  household where, as a young divinity, she was enshrined and worshipped? Yet, while
                  every chord of their hearts was vibrating with hope and quivering with love, there
                  were one or two little discordant notes mingling with this music of nature.
                  Moreland, the planter, whose princely abode and broad possessions Eulalia had so
                  often described, was more awe-inspiring than the stranger who had wooed her for
                  his bride. Then, he merely visited them, now he must be domesticated; and the
                  contrast between his own luxurious style of living, and their plain and
                  necessarily economical habits, would be inevitably more conspicuous. Then his
                  sister—they shrunk from the thought of her being admitted into their simple,
                  unadorned circle, accustomed as she had been to all the appliances of wealth. The
                  house was small, the rooms low and old-fashioned, the furniture, most of it,
                  handed down from other generations. Mrs. Hastings, with all her genuine piety and
                  sound good sense, could not help occasionally being troubled and. careful about
                  these things. It was one of the weaknesses to which poor human nature is liable,
                  and, though one of the most<pb n="242-243" xml:id="VAC6695-00000127"/> excellent
                  of her sex, she was still a woman, and had all a true woman's pride of appearance
                  and self-respect.</p>
               <p>Betsy was in a perfect fever of expectation and preparation. She scarcely slept at
                  night, thinking of the morrow's work. The ghost that haunted her came in the shape
                  of the negro nurse. Albert she knew, and did not care for him; but Netty must be
                  proud and "sarcy," and would turn up her nose at everything, she saw and heard.
                  She would give all the world if Miss Eula had left her at home. She was willing to
                  work her fingers to the bone herself—she did not mind that; but she could not bear
                  to be interfered with, as she knew she should be. Yet such is the inconsistency of
                  human nature, that while Betsy gave utterance to these misgivings, she liked to
                  boast of the style in which Miss Eula was coming, and would have been quite
                  ashamed to have had any one suppose that she had to attend to her baby herself.
                  The way she scrubbed and cleaned and cooked was almost miraculous. The genius of
                  Aladdin's lamp hardly wrought more wonders than Betsy out of her limited
                  materials.</p>
               <p>One day, after receiving a letter from the South, Mrs. Hastings entered the
                  kitchen with a glowing countenance.</p>
               <p>"Betsy!" she said, "I want you to look out for a young girl, who cap help you
                  while Eula is here—a nice, respectable young person, who can wait upon table and
                  put the rooms in order."</p>
               <p>Betsy opened her eyes wide, and dropped the shovel in her astonishment.</p>
               <p>"That would be grand," she answered; "that's what I've been wanting all along, but
                  I was afraid to say it, 'cause you allers said you couldn't afford any
                  extras."</p>
               <p>"We cannot do too much in honour of Mr. Moreland," said Mrs. Hastings. The letter
                  of Eulalia was in her bosom, containing the munificent gift her husband had
                  insisted upon her offering to her mother, and it was accompanied by words so sweet
                  and affectionate, the most fastidious delicacy could not shrink from its
                  reception. All that her warm and liberal heart had yearned to do, could now be
                  done without impoverishing her husband, who was burdened with many cares.</p>
               <p>"To-morrow they will be here," cried Reuben, now a graduate of —— —College, with
                  the highest honours of the institution adorning his reputation, and who had been
                  distinguished among his classmates as the eloquent champion of Southern
                  rights.</p>
               <p>"To-morrow and one day more, you mean," exclaimed Dora, in whose intelligent eyes
                  and darkened hair the shade of three passing years softly rested. "How long the
                  days are now! It seems as if they would never, <emph>never</emph> end!"</p>
               <p>The morrow came and went; the one day more was nearly closed, and Dora, in her
                  best white frock and curls smooth as satin, stood on the gate, and, shading her
                  eyes with her hand, watched the road through the<pb n="244-245"
                     xml:id="VAC6695-00000128"/> vista of lofty poplars, this side of the tavern.
                  Reuben's glowing locks were seen leaning against the sycamore tree, which
                  commanded the most distant view. Mrs. Hastings, too agitated to leave the house,
                  gazed through the windows, which often grew dim as she gazed. Mr. Hastings's
                  portly figure stalked up and down the yard, in its suit of Sunday broadcloth; and
                  Betsy flourished about the kitchen in her finest calico frock, pinned up to be
                  sure, and guarded by a blue-checked apron. Never were the setting-sun rays so
                  anxiously watched. Every object seen through the poplar vista was a coming
                  carriage. Sometimes it proved a black cow, sometimes a gentleman in black with a
                  white vest, who was mistaken for a white-faced horse. The buzzing of a humble-bee
                  was converted into the humming of distant wheels, and the haziness of twilight for
                  the dust that heralded the approaching carriage. For hours, the supper stood
                  untouched on the table, waiting for the expected guests, but they came not. Dora,
                  who had soiled her white dress rubbing against the gate, and strained her eyes
                  till they ached, and their clear white was streaked with little blood-shot veins,
                  went supperless and weeping to bed. Betsy folded up her nice calico frock, grieved
                  that she had tumbled it for nothing, and sighing over the flannel cakes so light
                  and melting, and the muffins, white and porous as the froth of albumen.</p>
               <p>"What was the reason folks never come when folks were ready and looking for them?
                  'Twas such a putty time to come about sundown, and have a whole night to rest in!
                  One does hate to be cotched in their duds!"</p>
               <p>Poor Betsy! people are so perverse they never Will come at the exact moment,—they
                  will take their own time, and it is generally the very worst in the world.</p>
               <p>The morning was veiled in mist, so dense that not one solitary sunbeam could
                  penetrate it. As Betsy said, "one could hardly see a hand before them." The
                  disappointment of the preceding evening had cast a gloom over the family; and Dora
                  wondered if it would be possible to live through another long day of
                  expectation,—and foggy days were so dreary, they were longer than any other. But a
                  short time before noon, the fog began slowly to lift up, like the curtain of a
                  theatre, revealing the charming scenery concealed by its folds. It rose, becoming
                  more and more thin, and brightening as it rose, till it assumed the appearance of
                  transparent, silvery gauze, through which the green foliage was seen waving and
                  sparkling, and the spring flowers softly glowing. It rested, a gossamer canopy, on
                  the tops of the sycamores, then, melting into soft, bluish wreaths, floated, up
                  into the depths of ether. Just as the silver veil was slowly lifting, the sound of
                  carriage-wheels was heard, right at the very gate, before any one was aware of
                  their coming. Two carriages were there, and the steps of both let down before the
                  door flew open, and the <emph>welcome home</emph> commenced. Oh! was not that
                  glorious sunburst, penetrating the vaporous, gauze-like<pb n="246-247"
                     xml:id="VAC6695-00000129"/> folds, an emblem of the joy of that meeting hour,—a
                  joy shining through tears! That lovely youthful matron, with such a pale yet
                  radiant face, who throws herself trembling in her mother's arms,—ah! that is sweet
                  Eula Hastings, the flower of her native village! That beautiful boy, nestling,
                  dove-like, in its father's bosom, and looking wonderingly at the strange faces
                  that surround it,—that cherub boy is hers. For one moment, even Moreland was
                  forgotten, who turned with glistening eyes to his sister, that seemed to say,</p>
               <p>"You see, New England hearts are warm and tender as our own."</p>
               <p>The Southern stranger was not chilled by her reception, though her own
                  demonstrative nature exceeded its warmth. Her heart involuntarily sprang forward
                  to meet Mrs. Hastings, whom she loved already, as the mother of Eulalia. When she
                  came forward to greet her, with that air of subdued kindness which shows there is
                  a well-spring flowing within, and extended her hand to the young creature clad in
                  the sable weeds of widowhood, Ildegerte threw her arms round her neck, and
                  exclaimed,</p>
               <p>"Let me be your daughter, too!"</p>
               <p>The warm embrace that followed this petition was a mute but expressive answer. Was
                  this the lady whom her imagination had invested with such stately grace and
                  aristocracy, whose coming she had secretly dreaded, this fair, pensive, loving
                  being, who claimed so sweetly her maternal love?</p>
               <p>The little black-eyed fairy, whose hand is already closely locked in Dora's, every
                  one knows it is Effie, "the child of the sun," as Eula had often called her; Dora
                  leads her into the house with such a protecting, motherly air, so confidential yet
                  so patronizing, it is impossible to describe it. Dora has become such a precocious
                  little woman, since Eula left her home, has so many responsibilities resting upon
                  her, as the only <emph>unmarried</emph> daughter,—has so many of Eula's proteges
                  to take care of, and her own reputation to sustain as the brightest scholar in
                  school, that there is some danger of her losing some of the graces of childhood,
                  without receiving a full equivalent. The wild and pranksome Effie will soon bring
                  her back to the right level.</p>
               <p>The "neat-handed Phillis," who had been engaged as Betsy's assistant, insisted
                  upon relieving Netty of the carpet-bags and bundles which she was bearing, so
                  that, fortunately, Netty's first impression of the village servants was, that they
                  were very polite and well-bred; and Albert, who was never outdone in politeness,
                  insisted upon taking them from the "neat-handed Phillis," who, on her part,
                  thought the Southern slaves the best bred people in the world. But where was Betsy
                  herself, that she had not appeared to welcome one whom she so deadly loved? She
                  had been flying halfway up<pb n="248-249" xml:id="VAC6695-00000130"/> stairs, and
                  halfway down stairs, in a state bordering on distraction,—resolving one moment she
                  would change her domestic morning dress, the next, thinking it would take too
                  long,—almost crying for joy at the thought of seeing Miss Eula's beautiful face
                  once more, yet recoiling in imagination from the "sarcy" black negro, who
                  accompanied her.</p>
               <p>Eulalia's affectionate heart waited not for Betsy's vacillating and bewildered
                  movements. Catching her baby in her arms, she sought the kitchen with eager steps,
                  and found Betsy hovering, like Mahomet's coffin, between two counter
                  influences.</p>
               <p>"Why dear, good, faithful Betsy, how glad I am to see you!" cried she, her voice
                  tremulous from excitement, and pressing Betsy's callous hand in her soft and rosy
                  palm. "I have brought my boy to show you—my fair and beautiful Southern
                  blossom."</p>
               <p>Betsy gazed upon the mother and gazed upon the child with brimming eyes, that soon
                  overflowed in a genuine heart-shower.</p>
               <p>"Oh! you are puttier than ever, Miss Euly!" said she, laughing and crying in the
                  same breath, "and just as good—better you couldn't be. And is this your own sweet
                  precious baby—the beautifulest darling that ever my eyes sot upon!"</p>
               <p>There was something in Betsy's homely, but honest, sterling features that
                  attracted Master Russell's discriminating minating eyes, and, with a most engaging
                  smile, he extended his snowy arms towards her.</p>
               <p>"Bless his little heart and soul! I'm ashamed to touch him, that I am—all in my
                  dirty morning working clothes. I dressed in my best last night and you didn't
                  come, and now ain't I a sight to see?"</p>
               <p>"You look very well indeed, Betsy, and your kitchen, as usual, as neat as wax. How
                  is your poor lame brother, Betsy?"</p>
               <p>"He is better off, a great deal, Miss Euly, for he's gone to Him that makes the
                  lame to walk like the bounding roe. For a long time it seemed as if I'd nothing to
                  live or work for; but them that has a plenty to do hasn't time to spend a
                  grieving, and it's a mercy in the end."</p>
               <p>It is not to be supposed that so important a personage as Eulalia would be
                  suffered to remain alone in the kitchen, for the doorway was soon filled with
                  those that followed her movements and hung upon her accents, as if her lips
                  dropped manna. Moreland greeted Betsy with genuine cordiality, and Count D'Orsay
                  himself could not have displayed more grace than Albert, in introducing his young
                  and coquettish-looking bride to the sturdy, republican Yankee servant. Netty
                  thought herself vastly superior to Betsy, but she had been so well drilled by
                  Albert in the <emph>proprieties</emph> of a Northern kitchen that she condescended
                  to be very courteous and genteel. Indeed she stood too much in awe of her master
                  to do anything which she knew would displease him.<pb n="250-251"
                     xml:id="VAC6695-00000131"/> Betsy saw the vision of the insolent black woman
                  fade away, and a trim, smiling, smooth-faced mulatto beaming in its place. From
                  that moment she extended the hospitalities of the kitchen with excellent
                  good-will. Betsy was an uncommon instance of unchanging devotion to one family, in
                  the midst of general fluctuation. It is not often that you find, among
                     <unclear>Northern</unclear> servants, one who remains, as she had done, a
                  fixture in the household, identified with the best interests of the family, and
                  participating heartily in all its joys and sorrows. But in a small inland town,
                  where the tide of emigration does not come flowing in, there is less of the spirit
                  of change than in the large cities. Those who prefer labouring in a family to
                  toiling in the crowded factories, are generally of steady, domestic habits, and,
                  having made up their minds to work as a necessity, see no advantage in rolling,
                  like the stone that gathers no moss, from door to door.</p>
               <p>Had Mr. Hastings become reconciled to his Southern son-in-law? One would suppose
                  so, from the bright sparkling of his keen black eyes, the constant friction of his
                  hands, and the "very happy to see you again," that repeatedly gladdened his lips.
                  Not that he had voluntarily yielded one iota of his principles—he still persisted
                  that they were as firm as Mount Atlas; but he was more guarded in the expression
                  of his feelings, and the letters of his daughter had insensibly wrought a change
                  in them greater than he himself was aware of. He could not but respect and admire
                  the character of Moreland, and rejoice in the happiness of Eulalia. He was proud,
                  too, of the wealth of her husband, and the distinction his alliance had given the
                  family.</p>
               <p>The being, beloved as Eulalia was, returning after the absence, even of a few
                  years, to the bosom of her family and friends, has an earnest of the bliss of
                  reunion in the spirit-world. There was no mistaking the testimonies of joy and
                  affection that greeted her wherever she moved. The venerable Dr. Ellery, her
                  beloved pastor, shed tears of joy when he embraced her; and when, with all a
                  mother's pride and tenderness, she placed her blooming boy in his arms, he raised
                  it towards heaven, and blessed it with the inspiration of a prophet and the
                  solemnity of a saint. Then gently drawing it to his bosom, he said,</p>
               <p>"I remember you, my daughter, an innocent, smiling babe, thus nestling in my
                  paternal arms. I love, to look back to that period, seeing before me the
                  fulfilment of my fondest prayers. I love to look forward to the future destiny of
                  this child. The blood of the North and the South is blended in its veins, and may
                  he be a representative of the reunion of these now too divided parties!"</p>
               <p>"Amen!" exclaimed Mr. Hastings. The spirit certainly moved him to utter it, for he
                  seemed as much electrified by its sound as any of his auditors. The truth was,
                  that little child, with its soft, downy touch,<pb n="252-253"
                     xml:id="VAC6695-00000132"/> had done more to make <emph>Mount Atlas</emph>
                  shake, than the giant efforts of reason, or the strong though invisible pressure
                  of conscience.</p>
               <p>On the following Sunday, Eulalia, dressed as she was accustomed to do as a village
                  maiden, in simple, unadorned white, took her place behind the green curtain with
                  the choral throng. With but few exceptions the same choristers were there,
                  composing the singing band, the same "Harmonicas Sacras" lay open, at the notes of
                  the same old, majestic anthems, which were wont to usher in the morning worship of
                  the temple. The temple itself was unchanged. Pure from the breath of sacrilege,
                  its walls presented the same spotless surface, and the same spotless hands
                  ministered at the altar. When the choir, rose, and, with a simultaneous burst of
                  melody, chanted the sublime hymn commencing thus— <q>
                     <lg type="quotation">
                        <l>"Before Jehovah's awful throne,</l>
                        <l>Ye nations bow with sacred joy;"</l>
                     </lg>
                  </q> Eulalia met the uplifted eyes of her husband, and they both remembered the
                  first time he had heard her voice sustaining the magnificent chorus. The memories
                  of three years of wedded happiness, such as seldom is given to mortals to enjoy,
                  were gathered in that single glance. Her heart swelled with adoring gratitude, and
                  gave utterance to its emotions in strains of angelic sweetness and power. There
                  were some, whose aged ears had never hoped to hear that voice again, save in the
                  celestial orchestra, were moved to tears as they listened, and blessed the lips
                  that still, pure from worldly guile, loved to sing the holy songs of Zion.</p>
               <p>Nature itself harmonized with the spirit of the scene, and breathed forth its
                  gentlest, balmiest influences. The air, soft and bland as the gales of the South,
                  stole in through the half-opened blinds, reverently parting the white locks of
                  age, and fluttering the ringlets of childhood. Effie's gipsy curls and Dora's
                  light-brown tresses, as they sat side by side, unbonneted, as children usually are
                  during the heat of summer, were twined together by the loving gale. Beautiful
                  representatives of the North and the South, they sat, with hand linked with hand
                  and heart meeting heart! Oh! that they might be typical of that harmony which
                  ought to exist between two regions which God has so greatly glorified, so
                  abundantly blessed!</p>
               <p>Moreland was exceedingly gratified by the cordial manner in which the citizens
                  expressed their congratulations for his return, greeting him at the door of the
                  church, when the services of the morning were over. Mr. Grimby's swarthy features
                  wore quite a benignant glow.</p>
               <p>"What a man soweth, that doth he also reap."</p>
               <p>Moreland's charities, though unostentatiously bestowed by the gentle hands of his
                  wife, had glided through the byways of the village, quietly as the stream that
                  fertilized its soil, imparting, like its clear and shaded waters, greenness and
                  bloom. The blessing of<pb n="254-255" xml:id="VAC6695-00000133"/> the poor rested
                  upon him, neutralizing the curse of fanaticism,—the anathema of prejudice.</p>
               <p>Where was the aged mother of Nancy? This was a question Moreland and Eulalia both
                  asked. She dwelt in the almshouse, the abode she had so long dreaded to inhabit.
                  After Nancy's death, it was impossible for her to remain alone, in her age and
                  infirmity. Though all were kind to the lonely octogenarian, none could assume the
                  heavy burden of her support. Few had a room to spare or time to devote to one
                  requiring so much watchfulness in life's second childhood,—that sad, sad era,
                  marked by the helplessness of infancy, without its innocence; the infirmity of
                  age, without its majesty. So she was borne to the almshouse, where many of the
                  poor, unhappy, scattered members of the great human family were doomed to meet.
                  The building was ample and comfortable, their common wants were supplied; but the
                  withered and rent associations of home were trailing after their weary steps, and
                  hanging in mournful tangles round their broken hearts. Who, while they bless the
                  benevolence that founded these institutions of mercy, does not pity the miserable
                  beings who, deprived of all other shelter, are condemned to bear the cross of
                  humiliation, and suffer the most melancholy of earthly privations? We would ask
                  any unprejudiced person, if old Aunt Dicey, in her comfortable cabin, in the midst
                  of home and its unbroken associations, was not happier than Dame Brown, the
                  companion of the drivelling idiot, the imbecile, the crazed, the lame, the halt,
                  and the blind?</p>
               <p>The poor old creature wept like an infant, when Moreland and Eulalia sought her in
                  her sad retreat. They tried to comfort her, but their own hearts were full. How
                  strange it seemed, that she should be suffered to live, the survivor of all
                  earthly ties and joys, with the clanking of life's broken chain ringing in her
                  ears; and Nancy, the joy and comfort of her age, blighted and cut down in the
                  flower of her youth!</p>
               <p>Never had Eulalia felt such an oppression of the heart, as in quitting that
                  melancholy abode. The inequality of happiness in this world struck her with a
                  force that was appalling. Why was she so richly blessed, and others so barren of
                  comfort? Were poverty and suffering the black clouds prepared as the background
                  for the exhibition of Christian graces? Must the earth for ever be darkened, by
                  the smoke of human suffering, creation for ever groan beneath the burden of sorrow
                  and of want? Eulalia gave utterance to these interrogations, on her homeward path,
                  and Moreland answered thus,—</p>
               <p>"I have pondered long and deeply over these things, and have come to the
                  conclusion, that, if every individual would do all that he can to relieve the
                  sorrows and trials of those <emph>within his reach,</emph> whom Heaven has placed
                  under his immediate influence, the sum of human misery would gradually and surely
                  diminish, and dwindle into<pb n="256-257" xml:id="VAC6695-00000134"/> nothing. But
                  man places himself on the hill-top, and, overlooking the valley at his feet,
                  stretches his hands afar, grasping at intangible objects, and wasting his energies
                  in fruitless and impossible efforts. He is not obliged to lift up his voice, to
                  appease the groaning poor at his side,—the world will not hear the soft hushings
                  of his benevolence,—his name will not echo to the distant hills. Every once in a
                  while, he mounts a hobby, whose thundering hoofs trample down all individual
                  rights, and disturb the repose of nations. Anti-slavery is the monomania of the
                  present day; and a black face, provided it belongs to a fugitive, irrespective of
                  every moral claim, a passport to favour and distinction."</p>
               <p>Moreland started, and a glow of pleasure illumined his serious and thoughtful
                  countenance. Whom should he meet near the threshold of Mr. Hastings's door but his
                  Western friend, Dr. Darley? The doctor was making a Northern tour, the present
                  summer, and his route leading him through this beautiful village, he learnt, with
                  joy, that he might have an opportunity of meeting his Southern friends. This
                  unexpected addition to their happiness was duly appreciated by all, but most
                  especially by the grateful Ildegerte, whose countenance became literally radiant
                  with the joy of welcome. Mr. Hastings was "very, very happy to see Dr. Darley, and
                  to entertain so distinguished a guest." He was proud of the honour—so proud and so
                  happy that he almost rubbed the skin from his hands by incessant friction. The
                  doctor, who was an enthusiastic and poetic lover of the beauties of nature, and
                  who thought he had found the loveliest resting spot in creation, consented to
                  remain a few days, and, during that short time, he had an opportunity of
                  exercising that commanding influence for the public good which he exerted wherever
                  he went.</p>
               <p>A placard had been put up at Mr. Grimby's tavern, and in the most conspicuous
                  public places, announcing that Mr. Howard, a distinguished philanthropist, would
                  lecture on such a night in the Lyceum hall. He was to be accompanied by a fugitive
                  slave, who would relate some of the most startling and thrilling incidents of the
                  horrible system from which he had recently escaped.</p>
               <p>Mr. Hastings was placed in a very perplexing dilemma. His house had always been a
                  kind of abolition-tavern, and all itinerant lecturers were received by him with
                  all the honours of hospitality. They were sure to bring him letters of
                  introduction, and he was sure to introduce them to the public with a glowing smile
                  of patronage. Supposing this stranger came, with his sable satellite, expecting
                  admission to his home, how could he receive him under the same roof with Moreland?
                  Yet, if he refused, how recreant to the principles he had so often declared
                  himself ready to die to defend! Dr. Darley, too, whose sentiments on the subject
                  he had been careful to ascertain, and whose good opinion he was most anxious to
                  secure, would consider<pb n="258-259" xml:id="VAC6695-00000135"/> himself insulted
                  as well as Moreland, by his countenance of one, the avowed champion of a cause,
                  against which he had thrown the weight of his talents and the influence of his
                  reputation. Poor Mr. Hastings was sadly troubled and perplexed. The large, staring
                  black letters on the placards seemed branded on his mind, and by a most painful
                  introspection, he beheld them from "morn till noon, from noon till dewy eve."</p>
               <p>"I want to hear this orator," said, Moreland, "and his African colleague. If he
                  has the eloquence of a Brainard, he may make every green leaf of the valley
                  thrill. I want to hear Dr. Darley, too, on the other side of the question."</p>
               <p>"Not when Mr. Moreland is present."</p>
               <p>"Surely you, Dr. Darley, standing as you do on the borders of the West, with the
                  North on one side and the South on the other, can speak with a far better grace
                  than one whose personal interests are identified with either."</p>
               <p>"It will be as the occasion prompts," replied the doctor. "I do not believe I ever
                  stayed three days in a place without being called upon to make a public address,
                  by the imperiousness of circumstances."</p>
               <p>Moreland had related to him the history of Brainard, the insurrection he had
                  plotted, the scene at the grave of Dilsy, and the after flight of Vulcan.</p>
               <p>"Perhaps this is the self-same man, figuring under a new name," said Dr.
                  Darley.</p>
               <p>"I have been thinking so," replied Moreland.</p>
               <p>"If so, we may anticipate some great scenes," said the doctor, the merry spark in
                  his eye scintillating with unusual brilliancy.</p>
               <p>This was not said in the presence of Mr. Hastings, who wandered like a restless
                  ghost the whole afternoon of the appointed evening. Every knock made him start and
                  change colour: but to his unspeakable relief his Hospitality was unclaimed—the
                  modern Howard had not yet made his appearance.</p>
               <p>When they arrived at the Lyceum Hall, it was already crowded almost to
                  suffocation, all the front seats being occupied by ladies, and the window sills by
                  little boys, with long republican sticks in their hands, ready to applaud the
                  coming orator. Neither Mrs. Hastings, Eulalia, or Ildegerte were present, and
                  Moreland, for reasons well known to himself, took the most remote and obscure
                  corner of the hall. Dr. Darley glided in very quietly and seated himself at his
                  side, while Mr. Hastings, with a reddening brow, walked forward with slow and
                  measured tread to his accustomed place of honour on the platform.</p>
               <p>The appointed hour came and passed. Heads were constantly turning towards the
                  door, shuffling feet betokened impatience, and there was an incessant coughing and
                  hemming in the audience, as if they were endeavouring to fill up the awful pause
                  of expectation. Some accident must have occurred to detain the orator: there<pb
                     n="260-261" xml:id="VAC6695-00000136"/> was no use in remaining longer in that
                  close, oppressive atmosphere. Just then, a commotion near the door caused a sudden
                  revulsion of feeling, the crowd divided, and a tall and slender figure, of erect
                  and dignified mien, passed on towards the platform, ushered by the obsequious Mr.
                  Grimby, and followed by a stout, brawny framed negro, black as the shades of
                  Erebus. Moreland gave a sudden start, and laid his hand on Dr. Darley. He
                  understood the pressure, and smiled. Yes! that was the sinewy arm which had forged
                  the weapons of rebellion in the midnight forge, which had been wrapped in
                  straining coil round his master's form when paralyzed by Paul's avenging blow.
                  Yes! there were the murky brow, the sullen, bloodshot eye, the fierce, vindictive
                  mouth, and glittering teeth of the Herculean rebel. But the orator! Moreland gazed
                  upon his face, hypocritical Brainard, thus transformed? His hair was short, and
                  pushed far back from his high, fair forehead; Brainard's long, sleek, and meekly
                  parted on his brow. A thick, dark beard, clustered round his mouth and chin,
                  giving it a massy and bold appearance; Brainard's was smooth and sharp, as little
                  Effie's classic eye had at once discovered;—yet there was the same half-sheathed,
                  steel-like glance, and the voice, though more clear and ringing, had the same
                  false, silver sound. The garb of the minister, the clothing of the sheep, were
                  cast aside for the bolder lion's skin, but the wolf was apparent behind them
                  all.</p>
               <p>Moreland's blood began to seethe in his veins when he saw Vulcan, far more
                  embruted and animal in appearance than when he defied him over the ashes of the
                  dead, ascend the platform and sit down side by side with his own father-in-law;
                  when he saw the vile impostor, whose path had been marked with the slime of the
                  snake, the brand of the incendiary, and the steel of the assassin, standing in
                  that elevated position, the centre of every gazing eye, assuming to be the
                  champion of truth and humanity, while violating their most sacred fights. He
                  announced himself as a traveller recently returned from the South, that beautiful,
                  but accursed region, "where all save the spirit of man was divine." He had had the
                  most abundant opportunities of studying and examining its social and domestic
                  institutions, and he was prepared to lay the result before an intelligent and
                  enlightened community. He began with the utmost calmness and deliberation,
                  describing the delicious climate, the luxuriant vegetation, the gardens of roses,
                  the bowers of jessamine, and groves of orange trees, which made an Eden of that
                  smiling land. He dwelt with enthusiastic admiration on the grace and loveliness of
                  its daughters, the brave and gallant bearing of its sons. One would have supposed
                  that to praise was his Only task; but he was making a flowering groundwork, to
                  enhance by contrast, the effect of the hideous structure<pb n="262-263"
                     xml:id="VAC6695-00000137"/> ture he was about to rear upon it. Anon the hand
                  that had been gently scattering roses, began to hurl the hissing thunderbolt, and
                  in the wild and thrilling eloquence which succeeded, Moreland found no difficulty
                  in recognising the splendid orator of the African church. He heard himself (for in
                  what other planter's home had he been so closely domesticated?) described as a
                  demon of cruelty, his slaves the subjects of the most atrocious barbarity, his
                  plantation the scene of horrors that baffled the power of imagination to conceive.
                  The clanking chain, the excoriating manacle, the gashing scourge, the burning
                  brand, were represented as tortures in daily, nay, even in hourly use; the shrieks
                  of womanhood, the cries of infancy, and the lamentations of age, as no more
                  regarded than the yelling of wild beasts or the whistling of the wind. The
                  audience was becoming painfully excited. Ladies were passing little bottles
                  containing the spirits of ammonia from one to the other, and covering their faces
                  with their white handkerchiefs; men groaned audibly, and many a dark and sinister
                  glance was turned to, the dim corner, where the Southern planter sat, unseen as
                  yet by the orator of the night.</p>
               <p>"Hush, hush!" whispered Dr. Darley to the excited and indignant Moreland. "Not for
                  worlds would I have you prematurely interrupt this scene. Wait, and you shall have
                  a signal triumph."</p>
               <p>It was a terrible struggle with Moreland, to keep from rushing forward and hurling
                  the wretch from the platform, exposing him at once to the crowd, whom he was
                  deluding by his falsehoods and magnetising by his electrical eloquence.</p>
               <p>"Behold," said Brainard, after having exhausted, for the time, the vocabulary of
                  horrors, "behold one of the poor victims of Southern barbarity—behold his
                  mutilated fingers, his branded and disfigured body. Hold out your hand,
                  long-suffering son of Africa—and show the awful mark of your master's
                  cruelty."</p>
               <p>Vulcan stretched out his left hand, in which the two central fingers were wanting,
                  making a sickening chasm. We have already related the accident which caused this
                  loss, as well as the burn which had left such an enduring cicatrice.</p>
               <p>"Look at this poor disfigured shoulder," continued Brainard, folding back the
                  negro's shirt-collar and displaying a terrible-looking scar(probably embellished
                  by a few touches of reddish paint). "This is but a small portion of the scars
                  which seam and corrugate his whole body."</p>
               <p>Groans and faint shrieks were now heard from every part of the house, and again
                  Dr. Darley's restraining hand was laid on Moreland's quivering arm.</p>
               <p>"Not yet, not yet! We must hear the negro's story. The climax is to come."</p>
               <p>But, just as Vulcan opened his huge lips to speak, in obedience to a gesture of
                  Brainard, and people were<pb n="264-265" xml:id="VAC6695-00000138"/> pressing
                  forward, half standing in their eagerness to catch every word of the hideous
                  speaker, a young man forced his way through the crowd in the doorway, and rushed
                  to the centre of the hall. So sudden was his entrance, so rapid his movements,
                  that no one recognised his colour till, slackening his pace and looking wildly
                  round him, he disclosed the bright yellow hue and dark-beaming eyes of the
                  mulatto.</p>
               <p>"Master, master, Mars. Russell!" he exclaimed, breathlessly, pantingly; "where are
                  you? Why don't you speak, and tell 'em they're all lies? Why don't you tell 'em
                  it's Vulcan, that tried to kill you, and Master Brainard, that tried to make
                  everybody kill you? You may kill me if you want to!" cried he, shaking his
                  clenched fist at the astonished Brainard. "I don't care if you do! I'll call you a
                  story-teller and a rogue. I'd a heap rather be killed, than stand still and hear
                  the best master that ever lived made out a monster of a brute!"</p>
               <p>It is impossible to give the faintest conception of the effect of this impassioned
                  appeal. The young republicans in the windows brought down their sticks like
                  rattling thunder, while, high above the din, several voices were heard
                  exclaiming—</p>
               <p>"Put him out, put him out!" and many leaped forward to execute the order.</p>
               <p>"Stop!" exclaimed a voice of command, and Moreland, without waiting to make a
                  passage through the people, sprang from bench to bench, till he reached the spot
                  where Albert stood, directly opposite the platform, in the full glare of the
                  lamplight. With glowing cheek and flashing eye, he faced the bold, but now pale
                  impostor and cowering slave, then turning to the people—</p>
               <p>"Let no one," he cried, "on their peril, touch this boy. He is under my
                  protection, and I will defend him with my life. He has spoken the truth. This man
                  is a vile impostor. Pretending, to be a minister of God, he introduced himself
                  into my household, and, under the cloak of religion, plotted the most damning
                  designs. I received him as a friend, cherished him as a brother, and obtained for
                  him the confidence of a generous and trusting community. I blush for my own
                  weakness; I pity the delusion of others. As to the horrible charges he has brought
                  against me and my Southern brethren, I scorn to deny them. If you could believe
                  such atrocities of <emph>any</emph> man, your good opinion would be valueless to
                  me. That you can believe them of <emph>me,</emph> knowing me, as most of you now
                  do, I know it is impossible. Had he been less malignant, he had done me more
                  evil."</p>
               <p>"I have spoken the truth, and nothing but the truth," interrupted Brainard,
                  grinding his teeth with suppressed rage; "our black brother can bear witness to
                  all I have declared."</p>
               <p>But "our black brother" did not seem disposed to back his falsehoods with the
                  boldness he had anticipated. Though brute force, roused by long-continued
                     excitement<pb n="266-267" xml:id="VAC6695-00000139"/> ment, had once triumphed
                  over moral cowardice, it gave him no sustaining influence now, and he shrunk and
                  quailed before the thrilling eye of his deserted and injured master. The influence
                  of early habits and feelings resumed its sway, and gleamings of his better nature
                  struggled through the darkness of falsehood and treachery. Notwithstanding the
                  bluntness of his perceptions, he felt the power of Moreland's moral superiority
                  over Brainard, and when he found himself called upon to confirm his unblushing
                  lies in the pure light of his master's countenance, a sudden loathing for the
                  white man who could stoop to such degradation, filled his mind; and a strong
                  desire for the favour he had forfeited and the place he had lost, stirred his
                  heart.</p>
               <p>"Speak, Vulcan!" cried Moreland, who had marked the changes of his dark face with
                  intense interest, "speak! and in the presence of an all-hearing God, say if this
                  man utters the truth, or I."</p>
               <p>"You, massa, you!" burst spontaneously from the lips of the negro, and it seemed
                  as if a portion of blackness rolled away from his face, with the relieving
                  consciousness of having borne testimony to the truth.</p>
               <p>"Villain!" cried Brainard,—stamping his foot, and turning fiercely on the
                  blacksmith,—"villain, you lie! you and your master—"</p>
               <p>"Order, order!" exclaimed Mr. Hastings, who had been terribly agitated during this
                  scene. Before he could add another syllable, Moreland, with one bound, stood upon
                  the platform, and seizing Brainard by the arm, gave him a downward swing that sent
                  him reeling against the living wall below. The act was instantaneous as lightning,
                  and the mimic thunder of the pounding sticks followed the flash. Brainard could
                  not, at any time, compete in strength with Moreland, and now, when indignation
                  nerved the arm of the latter, it seemed to have a giant's sinews. Conscious of a
                  great revulsion of feeling in the audience, since Vulcan's testimony against him,
                  he began to feel the insecurity of his situation. Turning in desperation to the
                  platform, like an animal at bay,</p>
               <p>"Sir," said he, addressing Mr. Hastings, "I appeal to you for redress, and
                  protection from insult and outrage. I appeal to this whole assembly, as a stranger
                  foully wronged. I appeal to Northern justice, for defence against Southern
                  insolence and aggression."</p>
               <p>For one moment, there was a breathless stillness, awaiting the reply of Mr.
                  Hastings. The face of Moreland crimsoned, and his heart throbbed audibly. Would
                  Eulalia's father throw the shield of his protection round this man? If so, they
                  must be for ever separated.</p>
               <p>"Sir," cried Mr. Hastings,—coming forward and speaking with emphasis, though in an
                  agitated voice,—"I have no protection to offer an impostor and a liar! This people
                  have no redress for one who insults them by asking it, in the face of such a
                  shameful detection. He shall find to his cost, that Northern justice will<pb
                     n="268-269" xml:id="VAC6695-00000140"/> protect the South from aggressions and
                  slanders like Lis!"</p>
               <p>A deafening shout went up as Mr. Hastings concluded, showing how warmly public
                  sentiment was now enlisted in the cause of Moreland. Moreland, relieved from an
                  intolerable dread, involuntarily grasped the hand of his father-in-law, and
                  pressed it with more cordiality than he had ever felt before.</p>
               <p>Where was Dr. Darley all this time? Was he a cool, indifferent spectator of this
                  exciting scene? By no means. Look at his keen, scintillating eyes, sparkling right
                  over Brainard's shoulder; see the ignited, glittering particles they emit, and say
                  if he is cool,—think of coolness if you can, in the presence of that countenance
                  of fire. He has been biding his time, and it has come.</p>
               <p>"My friends," said he,—addressing Mr. Hastings and Moreland,—" may I stand by you
                  a few moments? I have a few words which I would like to say to this good people,
                  if they will permit me. I want this man to hear me, also,"—laying his hand on
                  Brainard's shoulder,—"I pray you," turning courteously to the gentlemen in his
                  rear, "not to suffer him to depart."</p>
               <p>Mr. Hastings, who seemed quite inspired by the occasion, immediately descending;
                  the steps, led up Dr. Darley, and introduced him in the most flattering manner to
                  the audience, as one of the most distinguished citizens of the American
                  republic.</p>
               <p>"You see before you a plain, blunt man," said the doctor,—bowing with great
                  dignity to the audience,—"as deficient as the Roman Antony in the graces of
                  oratory and the flowers of rhetoric. Yet, I am given to making long speeches, and
                  if I chance to inflict one on you, you must; impute it to the force of habit,
                  rather than inclination. The man who has addressed you to-night, and who is a most
                  wonderfully eloquent speaker, is not entirely unknown to me. No testimony of mine,
                  however, is requisite, to add force to the words of Mr. Moreland, whom I am proud
                  to call my friend, whose hospitality I have experienced, whose domestic virtues
                  are fully known to me, and whose kindness to his black family I have myself
                  witnessed and appreciated,—no testimony of mine is needed to give effect to the
                  spontaneous tribute paid by this son of Africa to his master's truth and worth,
                  Your own hearts have given the verdict, your own consciences bearing witness to
                  the justice of the decree. But, I said before, I have some little knowledge of Mr.
                  Howard,—alias, the Rev. Mr. Brainard,—alias, Mr. Hiram Coates."</p>
               <p>"Alias Ichabod Jenkins," cried a voice from the back part of the house.</p>
               <p>Brainard started as if he had been shot, but there was no egress through that mass
                  of living beings.</p>
               <p>"I doubt not that he has innumerable aliases," continued the doctor, "but my
                  present business is with Mr.<pb n="270-271" xml:id="VAC6695-00000141"/> Hiram
                  Coates, who figured rather extensively in the West several years since. His
                  magnificent forgeries are even now the wonder of the Queen City, where I reside.
                  Now, if a man is determined to be a villain, I like to see him go on a grand
                  scale. If he sells his soul, he should set a lofty price. Gentlemen, I recognised
                  this individual the moment I beheld him, as the accomplished criminal who broke
                  the prison bars of the West, and eluded the punishment of his transgressions. His
                  after course you have learned; and what his future will be, if his evil passions
                  are allowed to have scope, it requires no prophetic inspiration to tell. He is a
                  dangerous, unprincipled, and lawless man, who should no more be suffered to roam
                  at large than the brindled tiger or the shaggy bear. If there is a sheriff
                  present, I call upon him to arrest him, on my own responsibility. If not, I call
                  upon every lover of the peace of society, every advocate for the rights of
                  mankind, to assist in securing him, till proper legal measures can be taken."</p>
               <p>The prompt response of the sheriff, who was present, proved the alacrity with
                  which he obeyed the summons. There was no escape for Brainard. Wherever he turned,
                  detection glared him in the face. The individual who had called out "Alias Ichabod
                  Jenkins," now came forward, and begged permission to recall to the public mind an
                  incident which occurred in the county many years since. He asked if there were not
                  some present who remembered a boy of that name put in the penitentiary for theft,
                  but whose sentence was mitigated in consequence of his extreme youth, and the
                  influence of many benevolent individuals, who interested themselves largely in his
                  behalf, and defrayed the expenses of his collegiate education. He reminded them of
                  the notorious character the young man afterwards established, of his wonderful
                  powers of dissimulation, and his successful villany. For years he had disappeared
                  from public notice; but there he was, the self-same individual, and he would swear
                  to his identity though hundred thousands were present endeavouring to prove the
                  contrary.</p>
               <p>It is singular, but there are oftentimes moments in the life of individuals, who
                  have seemed to possess a supernatural power of elusion, when an accumulation of
                  evidence suddenly falls upon them, and they are crushed as if with a thunderbolt
                  from Heaven; when the keystone of the proud arch of their iniquity gives way, and
                  they are buried beneath its ruins.</p>
               <p>As they were bearing this man of many <foreign xml:lang="LAT">aliases</foreign>
                  out of the hall, he turned round, and bursting into a sardonic laugh,
                  exclaimed—</p>
               <p>"Fools! dupes that you are! who strain at a gnat and swallow a camel! if I had not
                  known your credulity, and proneness to believe evil of your brethren, I never
                  should have prepared the black and bitter pill ye have been rolling as a sweet
                  morsel under your tongue. You had better profit by the lesson."</p>
               <p>'Yes, my friends," said Dr. Parley, as soon as the<pb n="272-273"
                     xml:id="VAC6695-00000142"/> criminal had passed through the door, where the
                  rabble received him with hootings and hissings of scorn, "it will be well to
                  profit by a lesson which, though it comes from a polluted source, may be salutary
                  to you. We are too prone to believe evil of others, to forget extenuating
                  circumstances, to put our own consciences in other men's bosoms, to decide upon
                  their motives of action, and shake them, at our own will and pleasure, over the
                  borders of the flaming lake. I am a man of many faults, but there is one thing I
                  claim as a virtue, and that is patriotism. I love my country—my whole country. I
                  recognise no North or South, East or West in the affection I bear it. I find no
                  cardinal points in my heart, though they are convenient to use for geographical
                  purposes. Born in one of the Middle States, I emigrated, in my boyhood, to the
                  West. Since I have been a man, I have devoted much of my time to travelling, and
                  studying the great book of mankind. I have learned to respect the rights of my
                  countrymen, wherever they reside; to appreciate their virtues, to judge kindly of
                  their motives of action, and to mete them with the golden measure which I would
                  have applied to myself. I have learned to consider the iron bed of Procrustes as
                  an abomination of heathenism, and the shame of a Christian land. I do not believe
                  that when you and I and the whole congregated universe shall be arraigned before
                  the great God and Judge of all, that he will ask whether we came from the North or
                  the South, the East or the West(there will be no cardinal points in heaven
                  either); that He will ask whether we were born in a free or a slave State: but
                  whether we have been faithful to the responsibilities imposed upon us, faithful to
                  our own peculiar duties; whether we have done all we could to advance the sum of
                  human happiness, and to promote His sovereign glory."</p>
               <p>It is not our intention to repeat all that Dr. Darley said, for he spoke at least
                  two hours, yet they scarcely seemed more than two minutes, so intent was the
                  interest that hung upon his words. Every one felt that it was a whole-souled,
                  whole-hearted, high-minded man who addressed them, lifted above all party zeal or
                  sectional feeling, acknowledging the great brotherhood of humanity, while
                  respecting the distinctions the Almighty has made. The kindling eye, the earnest
                  tone, the impressive rather than the graceful gesture, the whole countenance
                  illuminated with intelligence and sensibility, riveted the attention and made it
                  impossible for it to wander.</p>
               <p>There was one present on whom the events of the evening and the eloquence they
                  elicited had a most powerful and enduring influence—and that was Reuben Hastings.
                  He had listened with unspeakable indignation to the false representations of
                  Brainard, and with difficulty restrained himself from rushing forward as Albert
                  had done, in defence of the slandered Moreland.</p>
               <p>But the youth of New England are accustomed to<pb n="274-275"
                     xml:id="VAC6695-00000143"/> repress their emotions, and habits of self-control
                  are woven in with the woof and warp of their existence. At his father's indignant
                  denunciation of the impostor, he could not help waving his hat in the air, while
                  he pressed the other hand on his lips to hold back the exulting hurrah. Nor was he
                  the only one who responded in heart to Mr. Hastings's remarks.</p>
               <p>"That was the best speech you ever made in your life, squire," said Mr. Grimby to
                  him the next day. "You hit the nail right on the head. To tell the truth, squire,
                  I begin to think we have been a <emph>little</emph> too hard on the Southern
                  people. It won't do to believe everything we hear. I wouldn't feel as cheap
                  another time as I did last night to be made President of the United States. Now,
                  that doctor of the West is the right sort of man. He don't shut up one eye and
                  squint with the other, but he looks wide awake all round him, and sees everything
                  at once. There ain't many men could keep me standing two hours on my feet without
                  knowing it, as he did. We needed just such a speech, and it will do us all good. I
                  tell you what, squire, if all the Southern people were like your son-in-law, Mr.
                  Moreland, I wouldn't say one word against them as long as live."</p>
               <p>"There are few such men anywhere as Mr. Moreland," replied Mr. Hastings, delighted
                  to find that he had not injured his social position by the stand he had taken the
                  previous night. "You know," he added, in a self-appreciating tone, while his palms
                  gave each a friendly salute, " that I made a sacrifice, when I gave him my
                  daughter; but, like every act of self-immolation, it has met its reward. If ever
                  woman was happy in marriage, my Eulalia is."</p>
               <p>"If ever woman deserved to be happy, she does," said Mr. Grimby. On this the two
                  gentlemen shook hands very warmly, and Mr. Hastings seemed to be attacked with a
                  sudden cold, for he blew his nose and cleared his throat several times before he
                  continued the conversation.</p>
               <p>Vulcan humbled himself in the dust before his master, begged to be reinstated in
                  his favour and received again' into his family, but this Moreland refused.</p>
               <p>"I forgive you, Vulcan," said he, "but I cannot place that confidence in your
                  fidelity necessary to the relation that has existed between us. I have always said
                  that the moment one of my slaves became rebellious in feeling to me, they might
                  go. I want no unwilling service. You have an excellent trade, and, if steady and
                  industrious, can earn a comfortable living. If you want money, I will give it to
                  you. Come to me if you are in trouble, and I will relieve you,—but the relation of
                  master and servant must exist no longer."</p>
               <p>Vulcan had one of those surly, animal natures, that grow affectionate and yielding
                  under a stern, controlling will. He had not appreciated his master's favour
                     while<pb n="276-277" xml:id="VAC6695-00000144"/> basking in its sunshine, but
                  now it was withdrawn for ever, he crouched in abject submission at his feet.</p>
               <p>"I forgive you," again repeated Moreland, "but the rebel arm which dared to lift
                  itself against my life, must never more wield the hammer or strike the anvil for
                  me. Nothing can change this resolution. Go—you are free."</p>
               <p>Vulcan turned gloomily away, cursing the tempter who had lured him from the
                  white-walled cabin, the "old plantation," and taught him to lift his hand against
                  his once affectionate and indulgent master.</p>
               <p>The stirring events and <foreign xml:lang="FRA">denouement</foreign> of that
                  memorable night furnished subjects of conversation that appeared inexhaustible.
                  The result was the diffusion of a more liberal, charitable, and enlightened spirit
                  in the whole community. But the change in Mr. Hastings was most remarkable. His
                  very person seemed to alter. His eyes looked larger, and his hair had a more
                  subdued colour. He was constantly quoting Dr. Darley's opinions, and inveighed
                  with great bitterness against one-sided and prejudiced people. As Mr. Brooks said,
                  when first describing him to Moreland, he always had a hobby, which he rode
                  without mercy. As his last had given him such a terrible kick, he resolved to
                  discard it, and mounting another, it was not long before he was in danger of being
                  carried as fast and far in an opposite direction. He talked a great deal about"
                  our visit to the South" next winter, or rather the winter after next, of the fine
                  prospects of "my son Reuben," who was to be established there as a lawyer, under
                  the patronage of "my son-in-law." He even spoke of the possibility of his
                  remaining there himself, and opening a classical school.</p>
               <p>Shall we describe the visit of the Northern family to Eulalia's Southern home? Not
                  minutely, lest we weary the reader by recapitulation; but it was an event
                  unparalleled in interest in the lives of our villagers. It was long before Mrs.
                  Hastings yielded her consent to the journey, well knowing that they would be
                  placed under new obligations to the generous and uncalculating Moreland. But he
                  bate down at last all her scruples, and when he had obtained her promise to accede
                  to their wishes, he insisted upon carrying with them the young Dora, as a hostage
                  of its fulfilment.</p>
               <p>When he told Betsy that she must accompany the family, as it would not be
                  considered complete without her, she shook her head, and said,</p>
               <p>"I thank you, from the bottom of my heart, for not being ashamed to ask me, but I
                  ain't fit to travel about and wait on ladies. My place is in the kitchen, and I
                  Wouldn't feel at home anywhere else. I'd feel as strange as a fish out of water,
                  anywhere, but where I had to knock about and scuffle with my work. People gets
                  used to the way they live, and, though it mayn't be the best way, it's hard to
                  turn 'em any other. Your fine niggers don't make fun of me here, 'cause they see
                  me in the right place; but let me stick up as a lady's maid, and<pb n="278-279"
                     xml:id="VAC6695-00000145"/> go among 'em, I'd be the biggest laughing-stock
                  under the sun!"</p>
               <p>Betsy was right, and Eula, feeling that she was, did not endeavour to shake her
                  resolution. She had too much regard for her feelings to wish to see her in an
                  uncongenial situation, where her visible awkwardness might expose her to ridicule,
                  and her innate worth be undiscovered or unappreciated.</p>
               <p>The family made their visit in the winter season; but they were not suffered to
                  return till they had witnessed the beauty and magnificence of a Southern spring,—a
                  spring which does not break forth at once, in the full glory of the Northern
                  season; but comes stealing gently on the scarcely perceptible footsteps of
                  departing winter, showering roses, and distilling the odours of Paradise. They
                  were enchanted with the climate, the luxuriant vegetation, the wilderness of
                  blossoms and profusion of sweets, and even <emph>bondage,</emph> which at a
                  distance had seemed so dark and threatening, lightened up as they approached it,
                  like the mist of their valley, and receded from their view.</p>
               <p>They passed a week at the plantation, from which all traces of the arch-fiend
                  Brainard were now removed, and their respect and admiration for Moreland were
                  heightened, when they saw him in his true position of planter and master, and
                  filling it with such dignity, firmness, and humanity. Mr. Hastings acknowledged,
                  that, if all masters established as excellent regulations, and enforced them with
                  the same kindness, wisdom, and decision, the spirit of Abolitionism would die away
                  for want of fuel to feed its flames. He carried a memorandum-book in his pocket,
                  which he filled with notes, as materials for a new course of lectures, with which
                  he intended to illuminate the prejudices of the Northern people. He had
                  relinquished the idea of the classical school, believing that he would not be
                  considered as great a man at the South as in the little village of which he had
                  long been the intellectual autocrat. His son Reuben was to remain as his
                  representative, and among his parting injunctions, while rubbing his hands with
                  serene self-complacency, he warned him from cultivating an illiberal, narrow
                  spirit, and bade him sustain his father's reputation for candour and
                  philanthropy.</p>
               <p>Perhaps some young, romantic girl may ask, "Did Ildegerte never marry again?"
                  Perhaps they may wish that Dr. Darley were a young man for her sake, or that he
                  had not devoted himself with such matchless constancy to the memory of his buried
                  wife. It is certain, that Ildegerte values his esteem and friendship now more than
                  the admiration of more youthful men; but the time may come when her blighted
                  affections will bloom afresh, and another fill the place of the departed Richard.
                  She is still young and very beautiful, a charming representative of her native
                  South, by the side of the Northern Eula.</p>
               <p>We are loth to leave her, our sweet "Northern bride,"<pb n="280-281"
                     xml:id="VAC6695-00000146"/> now a wife and mother, far happier than the bride;
                  but, committing her to the guardianship and kindness of a generous public, we bid
                  her farewell.</p>
               <p>We know there are some who will throw aside these pages, with the impression that
                  they give false and exaggerated views of Southern life; but, with a conviction
                  that a God of truth beholds the lines traced by the hand which He has formed, we
                  give them to the world. We have not gone groping in dark by-lanes and foul dens
                  for tales of horror, which might gratify a morbid and perverted taste; but we have
                  described what we have seen and known, without the intention of enhancing what is
                  fair or of softening what is repulsive. We believe the Southern character to be
                  misunderstood, misrepresented, and wronged, and that it is the duty of those in
                  whose minds this conviction is rooted, to vindicate it, as far as their influence
                  extends, from calumny and animadversion.</p>
               <p>Not merely in the expectation of honour or profit, have we entered the lists as a
                  champion of the South, but from a motive which we glory in acknowledging. We love
                  it as the home of noble, generous hearts, of ingenuous and lofty minds. We love
                  the magnanimity and chivalry of its sons, the pure and high-toned spirit that
                  animates its daughters. Shall we dwell in its beautiful bowers and see the
                  canker-worm eating into the heart of its blossoms, without teaching out a hand to
                  rescue their bloom from the destroyer? Shall we breathe its bland, delicious
                  climate, and know that the noxious miasma is rising and spreading, without
                  endeavouring to disperse its exhalations, or trying to counteract its deadly
                  influence? We love the North— <q>
                     <lg type="quotation">
                        <l>Land of the wild and wintry blast,</l>
                        <l>Of spirits high and glowing,</l>
                     </lg>
                  </q> of minds exalted and refined, of hearts steadfast and true; even its snows
                  and icicles are dear to our bosom; but it needs no champion to assert its
                  uninvaded rights. Enthroned on its granite hills, it reigns in unmolested grandeur
                  and serene repose. No volcanic elements are heaving under its wintry shroud, or
                  threatening to lay waste its summer bloom. But, should the burning lava of anarchy
                  and servile war roll over the plains of the South, and bury, under its fiery
                  waves, its social and domestic institutions, it will not suffer alone. The North
                  and the South are branches of the same parent tree, and the lightning bolt that
                  shivers the one, must scorch and wither the other.</p>
