TuIs volume is affectionately dedicated to the FRIENDS of E. N. G-; because it would never have come into being, had not their unchanging love and true sympathy oftentimes kindled the ashes of a dead hope, and encouraged her to renewed exertions, both in the inner and the outer world; because they first suggested the idea of her collecting those little stray leaves, that she thoughlt the breezes had scattered too widely apart, for her ever to trace their wanderings; and by instilling the spirit of faith and trust in her brothers and sisters, that should enable her to rise above thatfear which had paralyzed her, whenever she thought of laying aside the veil of private life, which had heretofore proved as a shield, and of Which one constituted like herself, shrinking from publicity, ever stands in need ;-for, " life has been a hard battle with her, and like a bird with a broken wing, she would seek the covert of shady places." But she has grown strong. She has asked herself, what right had she to hope to escape severe criticism, if not unjust censure, when those most highly fa- vored of the Muse-those who have gained the Olympian heights, and are soothed by the divine harmonies of that upper region--are often sad- dened by the tumult and jargon from below; and they are charged with "plagiarism," "lack of common sense," of being "foolishly romantic,'" - and "hopelessly imbecile." Because, when weary and discouraged, she has ever found a resting place in their homes and their hearts. They have been " like stars clustering near and shining brightly upon her path- way. They are among the exceeding great and precious gifts, for which her heart would daily offer up its gratitude to Heaven. They have made    <pb n="viii-ix" xml:id="VAC6530-00000005"/> viii.         DEDICATION. life beautiful. They are more to be desired and prized than kingly dia. dems or crowns of fame, or abundance of golden treasure." "Shall she thank God for the green summer, and the mild air, and the flowers, and the stars, and all that makes this world so beautiful, and not for the good and beautiful beings she has known in it? Their presence has been sweeter to her than the flowers. They are higher and holier than the stars;" and to them she brings this simple offering-knowing that they love-her too well to have advised her to do aught, that their highest judg- ment would not have sanctioned. Thus, fearlessly she lays these heart- throbs, upon the altar of friendship. E. N. G. i   I INTRODUCTION. "I had to live, that therefore I might work; And being but poor, I was constrained, for life, To work with one hand for the booksellers, While working with the other for myself And art. Having bread, For just so many days, just breathing room For body and verse, I stood up straight and worked My veritable work. I labored on, alone; the wind and dust And sun of the world beat blistering in my face; And hope, now for me, now against me, dragged My spirits onward. Behold, at last, a book! If life-blood's necessary,-which it is, If life-blood's fertilizing,-I wrung mine On every page of this. Shall I fail?-Measure not the work Until the day's out and the labor done; Then bring your gauges. If the day's work's scant, Why call it scant; affect no compromise; And in that we have nobly striven, at least, Deal with us nobly, women though we be, And honor us with truth, if not with praise.    <pb n="x-1" xml:id="VAC6530-00000006"/> X.         INTRODUCTION. Be sure, no earnest work Of any honest creature, howheit weak, Imperfect, ill-adapted, fails so much, It is not gathered as a grain of sand, To enlarge the sum of human action, used For carrying out God's end." AURORA LEIGH. "In early years, when, though so frank as to the thoughts of the mind, I put no heart confidence in any human being, my refuge was in my jour- nal. I have burned those records of my youth, with its bitter tears, and struggles, and aspirations. Thospiratirations were high, and have gained only broader foundations and wider reach. But the leaves had done their work. For years to write there, instead of speaking, had enabled me to soothe myself; and the Spirit was often my friend, when I sought no other. Once, again, I am willing to take up the cross of loneliness. Resolves are idle, but the anguish of my soul has been deep. It will not be easy to profane life, by rhetoric." MARGARET FULLER. ?-   NO. I. "OH I ask not, hope thou not too much Of sympathy below; Few are the hearts whence one same touch Bids the sweet fountain flow; Few-and by still conflicting powers Forbidden here to meet; Such ties would make this life of ours Too fair for aught so fleet." IIEMANS. FRIDAY, July 3d, WEDNESDAY afternoon, I left for New York.   Oh I what a dreary day that was to me.  I employed every moment of my time in arranging all that would add to my children's comfort during my absenice. God only knows with what anguish of heart I bid them farewell I I feared I was gazing upon them for the last time. After kissing them fervently, and praying that the all wise Father would keep them in the hollow of his hand, I stepped hastily into the carriage, and was driven far from my home, and all that made earth    <pb n="2-3" xml:id="VAC6530-00000007"/> 2       LEAVES FROM AN beautiful to me. Our ride to Stonington, in the cars, was cheerless; for it was a stormy night, and I could not banish from my mind the thought that our children would be thrown upon the cold charity of the world, in case of any serious accidents, and I could not think of one relation on either side, who could be bur- dened with our treasures. The fog was dense, and we were obliged to stop at Stonington till the next morning. We listened to some sweet music-a mod- est, pretty little German woman played the harp, and her husband accompanied her with his flute, while her sister sang, and played the guitar. I had some conversation with her, and found her heart was far away in her native land, where she had left her only child, and she had not seen it for many a long month. No wonder her face was sad while she was playing the gay tunes that were called for by the heartless crowd around her. We arrived in New York about four or five o'clock, Thursday afternoon, and just as I was stepping from the boat to the carriage, I heard a cry of anguish; and then a man crossed my path, holding in his arms a lit- tle boy, about the age and size of my little R., and as he stumbled over the stones, a girl of about ten or twelve years of age came running after him with bare feet and swolen eyes, exclaiming all the while,- "Ohl he will kill him! he will kill him!-he is drunk, he don't know what he is doing. Oh stop himn, stop him." Then I perceived that the mnan was hardly able to stand, but was running, as drunken men will some- times, to keep from falling. Hastily I joined the chase,   IINVALID 'S JOURNAL.        3 and laying my hand upon the shoulder of the girl, said,- "What is it, my poor child?" She repeated it over again that her father was drunk-that he had taken the child from her, with the determination of killing him. The poor girl sobbed aloud, and I wrung my hands in agony, and begged the men to hasten and save the child. Never shall I for- get that moment, as I saw the wretched man standing on the very verge of the wharf, trying to unclasp his little son's hands, that were clinging fast to his neck for safety. It was my own child, for the moment. My husband dropped the trunks and came after me; his own soul was moved with pity, for he comprehended the whole at a glance, but as he saw others engaged in securing the child, he said " you must come, the man is waiting; in this tumult and confusion we shall lose our baggage." "I cannot go till the child is safe," I replied, and my tears fell fast. Some kind men ap- proached, and very respectfully told me the child was safe. Then I ran forward again, and entreated the girl to be good to the child, and oh! how my heart went forth in prayer for that little Suffering girl her- self, with no one to counsel, no one to guide, and that little helpless brother to look after. I thought how I had murmured at a short separation, from my healthy, happy children, and felt condemned. I rode through the splendid streets of New York city, and although many things were pointed out to interest me, I could see nothing but that brutal father, that motherly self sacrificing sister, and the little chubby limbs of that three years old boy. Sobs would come from my heart, and I could not repress them.    <pb n="4-5" xml:id="VAC6530-00000008"/> 4       LEAVES FRONM AN We arrived at our destination, and whilst taking tea ---  tried to give a description of the scene we had witnessed. They smiled, looked at me, and said: "Such things affect persons who have weak nerves, very much." Weak nerves! I wonder if the rum- sellerfs wives and daughters would not have been af- fected by that scene, even if they had been possessed with strong nerves. But my memory, as Mrs. Child says, is a PDaguier- reotype machine," taking instantaneous likenesses3 o whatsoever comes in its way, whether it is beautiful or not, and this scene is indelibly imprinted, and I cannot efface it.

For, as a seal, upon the melted heart, "Tis set forever!" SIGOURNEY. TUESDAY, April 10th. In looking over the leaves of my journal, my eye rests upon this sentence :-"Nannie bade me farewell to-day, and I shall not probably see her again before she starts for P." All! how well do I remember that day. I was lying down; for I was very, very weak, and was unprepared to see any one: but the door   INVALID'S JOURNAL.        5 opened, and Nannie, she whose presence always filled me with delight-stood by my bedside. She saw my surprise for it was Tuesday, and I thought she was in her school-and said, "You did not know that I had left school to have a good long rest! Doctor-- called and told me, if I would save myself from a fit of sickness, I must leave immediately and go into the country; but you know it is a very unpleasant season of the year, to visit the country, and I have concluded I   to go to P---". Every thing grew dark around me as she uttered these words. How could I live with- out her?--she, whose coming I looked for as the sick child looks for its absent mother. Oh! Nannie, I ex- claimed, you must not leave me. What shall I do when you are gone? She kissed me, and kept smoothing my hair with her little trembling hand, as she said-"It will be but a short time, and it will pass so swift- ly, that before you can think it possible for six weeks to have flown by, I shall be with you again, and then our separation will be as though it had never been; only I shall have so many things to tell you of all that I have seen, and you will have much to relate to me of all that has transpired to interest you during my absence. Cheer up dearest, let us hope for the best." "I will try to do so," I said-"I know I am very selfish." But the dark cloud was still there. We parted --she imploring me to take care of myself, and to be- lieve that she would soon be with me again. I prom- ising that I would, and resolving in my heart that not an idle moment should make me wretched but at the same time feeling that there would be no true enjoy-    <pb n="6-7" xml:id="VAC6530-00000009"/> 6       LEAVES FROM AN ment, and that I should be in a hurry for those weeks to pass. This was wrong. I feel it; I know it. We never met again I A letter came, but it was short and unsatisfactory; and then another, in which she said, * If you could see my pale, blue face, you would not wonder that I cannot write more-but do not be alarmed, the canker is not dangerous, you know." A third letter, in an unknown hand, Told me she'd left me, for the Spirit Land. I will not speak of the bitter anguish this separa- tion caused me. I knew she was happy, and I would not have had her back, if, by raising my hand, I could have done so. It was for myself I mourned. Our 'communion had been so perfect, so unalloyed. How many things do I remember since her departure, that were hardly thought of at the time. Her health had been failing for two years, and she was subject to fre- quent attacks of illness. At such times, I acted as nurse, and often read aloud to her. One day, I was reading ' Hamlet's Ophelia,' from "Mrs. Jameson's Characteristics of Women." A short, quick sob in- terrupted me. I looked at N--- ;her eyes were filled with tears. Laying aside the book, I knelt be- side the sofa, and kissing her cheek, said, "Do not feel sad, dear Nannie; you will be well soon." "I am not sad," she replied, smiling through her tears-" but I was thinking, should I be called to the better world, and leave you still toiling and struggling here below, could I be happy without you, even though I were in Heaven 1"Ah! yes, beautiful and holy was the love that lay shrined in her heart, for her poor, erring friend.   INVALID'S JOURNAL.        : She was chosen to read the original contributions of our little circle; wherefore, those who have listened to that sweet voice, can best tell. These were the closing lines of the last piece I ever heard her read- Life is the sultry day, parched by the wind and sun; I    And Death, the fresh, cool night, when the weary day is done." Little did I think that the sultry day of her exist- ence here, was so soon to end; that even then, " the fresh, cool wings of death," were fanning her fevered brow. I could never plan a bright future in this world for my friend; for whenever I attempted it, I would be stopped as by an invisible hand, and I would say-- "Her Heavenly Father can do it far better than I can." And how true was the language of a mutual friend, who wrote me, soon after he heard the sad news of her death, when he said-"And oh! may we not believe that HE who rules the world in love, saw the little one in all her trials; that she had already approached near to the nature of higher beings; in mercy resolved to make them short; and hath taken her away unto himself." "There was a fair and deli- cate flower:-it seemed an exotic, though it flourished and bloomed for a while in the rough soil where it grew; but just as it began to droop and fade, the watchful Gardener carried it to a milder clime, that nourished by more congenial skies, it might live and bloom in immortal beauty." Ancd again, and oh! how soothing was this language to my tortured heart, for many months after her departure. In the day time, and in the still, holy night, I would find myself repeat- ing it.

Her remains lie in that sweet resting place for the dead, "Laurel Hill Cemetery ;" and when the fair moon, and the quiet stars, shed their soft radiance over that hallowed spot, there, too, the friend she loved so well, often wanders in imagination, and as she bends over the grave, the language of her heart is, "Father, I thank thee, for thou " gavest me one who taught me how to live, and how to die."

AGAIN I turn over the leaves of my Journal, and     Ithough there are many that are blotted with the   INVALID'S JOURNAL.         9 tears I shed while penning them, there are also those that are bright with the sunbeam of Hope. They were recorded after the thick dark clouds had passed, and the angels' faces that peeped from them were clear- ly to be seen, as were those that environed Jean Paul. "Sorrow may endure for a night, but joy cometh in the morning."  A few pages back and every line breathes forth despondency. There I say, "I have no more a wish to meet with one who can love me; and whose love I can return." But here my heart gushes forth in words of gratitude and love to the All Wise Father, and I say, "God is too good to me; for as soon as he has removed one loving, gentle heart, he sends two to fill its place."

A little note, in her deli- cate hand writing, lies before me, in which she says:- "Long have I sought, and vainly have I yearned To meet some spirit that could answer mine- Then chide me not, that I so soon have learned To talk with thine." And there is another:-her presence has brightened my home and her counsels have led me to look from the actual sufferings to the future rest. Again, there are two beings who love me far better than I deserve. One said, "I will do all that is in my power tO supply her place," and nobly has she fulfilled her promise!. The other stands ever ready, and her sympathy and love often make the rugged paths smooth. Oh! how desolate must that heart be who traverses the journey of life, uncheered by the sympathy of loving souls! What have 1 done that I should be beloved?

It has always been my good fortune to have those, who were far above me, look down smilingly upon me; and clasping my hand, they have aided me to rise higher, but they were still above me! And shall I not do the same, if there are any lower down than myself? The cold and prosaic may live without sympathy, and they may think it sinful for me to prize it as I do, but I cannot think so.

IV. AUGUST 27. YESTERDAY, I passed nearly the whole day at "GREENWOOD CEMETERY," that retired and quiet rest- ing place of the Dead; and what a world of memories are connected with that hallowed spot! We took the stage for Brooklyn; and as soon as we arrived at Fulton ferry, the usual cry of "Greenwood Cemetery right away," saluted our ears. The exchange was made in a few moments, and we were again jogging on as fast as the poor horses could carry us. It was a glorious day,-not a cloud to be seen in the blue sky. The heat would have been oppressive had not the gentle breezes every now and then fanned us, as they passed on their way. They were most gratefully welcomed, and as we bade them farewell, we turned to receive their companions, who could only give us a. fragrant kiss in passing, and has- ten on to fulfil their mission. The stage -was full, but I noticed only two particularly. One fwas a young mother, with a bright eyed little babe of some four months old, with whom she was evidently delighted, and thought every body else must be. The other was an old man, whose countenance I shall never forget. Whenever the eyes of strangers are upon us, we al- ways repress the kindly feelings of the heart; and how- ever much we may desire to speak to those who look sad, we shrink back: and those very persons may look upon us and think us proud and unso cial:-but this good old man gave utterance to the feelings of his   TINVALID'S JOURNAL.       13 kind and truthful heart. He praised the bright eyes of the baby, and modestly asked us if it was not an uncommon lovely child. He spoke of everything that was beautiful and worthy of note, as we passed along, but the little one within claimed the largest share of his attentions, and I knew he would gladly have taken it on his own knee, had it been possible. I loved him from the moment he spoke to the child. When we ar- - ig  rived at the grounds, he left us, and I saw him, with a friend by his side, passing along one- of the avenues. How cheerful, and yet holy, was that place to me! The sighing of the breezes through the tall forest trees, the glad sunshine, the blue azure sky that overarched the whole, the pure white marble-all had a language of their own, and my heart responded to it. We wan- dered round for some time, but had not yet seen the grave of poor MacDonald Clark and the quiet little lake that I had heard so much about. Fatigue had crept ov- er me by degrees and I was obliged to rest before we started in search of them. A pleasant seat was found under a tree, and there my friend left me. How im- pressive was the silence that reigned around! For a moment a feeling of awe took possession of my mind. Alone with the dead! I repeated softly-but it soon passed away, and my soul was in harmony with nature.  ^ I could not believe that this place had once been the i   scene of warfare and blood shed; that, perhaps, on the -very spot where I was then resting there had been an. gry combatants and dying groans.

Suddenly a group of mourners were before me, and as they bowed their heads and looked into the graves, a tall figure approached. In soothing tones he in- quired, "Why seek ye the living among the dead?"- then he raised his arm and pointed upwards, and with a firm voice he uttered that majestic and sublime truth, "They are not here, they have risen!"

Leaving his companion, he drew near to where we were seated, and with an animated face gave a most glowing description of many parts of the grounds; but when he spoke of Macdonald's grave, and the young Indian girl's, and the Sylvan Lake, and the Gondola, his language was not only eloquent, but poetical. I said he is " growing old gracefully" and his presence will make glad the hearts of those who journey by his side, as the little Oasis in the desert, cheers the faint and thirsty traveller; and his own soul will be watered by its refreshing streams: this would be a fit resting place for him. Some would have smiled, and said he was in his dotage. Ah! should I live to be as old, may I be as enthusiastic, and as ardent an admirer of the true and the beautiful!

I rejoiced that his Father had called him home, for this is indeed a cold world to one, who, like poor Clark, " had a nerve protruding at every pore." Peace be to his memory! I took a seat in the Gondola, and did not wonder that the old gentlemen grieved that there had not been something arranged to have sheltered it from the weather. I gathered some of the tiny wild flowers from the graves of those two beings whose fate I had pondered over so much. There was an unfinished monument of one -who was the idol of her fond pa- rents, .and who was suddenly deprived of life without a moment's warning. How unutterably bitter must have been that poor mother's anguish! In imagination, I instinctively clasp my own dear daughter to my heart, and pray heaven to shield me from a like trial.

I gazed long into the deep sky, and all the glory above me; then down upon the green grave by my side. I saw-I felt all these things; but there was no mother's voice to break the solemn silence, and a deep sadness stole over me.

He has a very clear and vivid memory, and among the many reminiscences of his early days, the pleasure that dear friend's presence gave, stands out as a little green "oasis," that gladdened his young spirit many and many a time, and although it has passed from before his I eyes, it has left its own fragrance and refreshing per- fume behind.

He is, emphatically, the apostle of Peace; and his views of woman's efforts in that blessed cause, were intensely interesting. He wished me to set about establishing a "peace league" to be the "nucleus" of a little circle of friends and neighbors, whom I might gather around me, for the purpose of dissemi- nating those glorious truths, that were Christ's pre- cious legacy to his children, but of which they have taken so little note. He was to correspond with me, and put me in communication with some highly culti- vated ladies in England; but my timidity overpowered my benevolence, and I dared not make any promise. My many cares loomed up before me, and the constant- ly recurring thought,-" could one, hitherto so useless do aught, however earnestly she might desire it, to- wards spreading any truth,"-made me shrink back, and propose another instead. But my conscience is yet tender, and when I do not perform that which the inward monitor, tells me is my duty to do, regrets fol- low me like my shadow.   Christ came to instill love in our hearts, and that peace is the offspring of love, surely none can question.

Child as I then was the inconsistency of christians, or those professing the spirit of the meek and blessed Jesus, to be in favor of war, I could not conceive of; and throughout my life, -that has been one of the stumbling-stones in my path- way. The intense desire to convert the soul to God, the prayers, the tears, the entreaties to flee from the wrath to come; the worth of the immortal soul;-all this we daily witness: but let these same earnest work- ers for the soul, know that their land is invaded, their rights threatened, their property in danger, and their cry is, " to arms!" The work of the immortal soul is then forgotten, the temporal reigns supreme! It is painful to me to see so little interest on this subject. I feel that it would be useless to speak to most of our ladies, their minds are preoccup'ed: dress, company, and frivolities, leave no room for peace leagues; and if one, from a sense of duty, should introduce the subject, they would look suspiciously, and ever af- ter, when speaking of that person, would say, " she is a good sort of a woman, but she has such queer no- tions."

Not that I for one moment doubted her truth, her affection, or her willingness to write me whenever it were possible, for her to do so. We may care to cor- respond, we may not even hear, or know of the other's destiny; but we shall never cease to love; because we fondly trust. Like that dear one, I too have had to give up letter writing nearly altogether, and the de- privation weighs more heavily upon my heart, than most people would imagine, who seek pleasure and amuse- ment in the world. I fear some of my correspondents think me dilatory. But I can write only when it is quiet, and so wait thinking and hoping, that time will come; but the blessed season never arrives, and some who do not know me as well as -- does (I mean the tenacity of my nature to cling, where the heart has been touched) may think I forget them, because my pen is silent. I have many things to distract and trouble me, and I suffer almost constantly, both in body and mind; but my letters have been such a source of deep enjoyment to me, that I know not how to be deprived of it. In this letter dear S. tells me of her approach- ing marriage. and says," The feeling you mention dear Elise, only gives me more convincing proof of your love, and therefore endears you the more; whatever be my fate, I shall always be" toujour le meme" to you ma 'chere."

I can see her, but I cannot transfer her features, that are graven upon the tablet of my heart to you: that certain, indefinable something that the soul transposes into every feature, must be seen, to be felt.

It was like an electric shock to me, coming in contact with such a mind as hers, and on one particular subject, if I understood her aright, I feel she was laying my own heart bare to the world., I do not see why Lamartine with his clear intellect, and pure heart, should have given it to the world, if its tendency is evil.

She looked in my face and said, "I have all the rights I desire, have not you?"I could not answer her for a moment, so overwhelmed was I by a contemplation of woman's real position-feeling perhaps, it were better to be wronged, to suffer, than to have one's eyes and ears closed to the wrongs and sufferings of others, because their peculiar experien- ces, had never been our own. Then, there was the letter from a correspondent in England, with its keen sarcasm, and out spoken manly truth. His remarks on Mrs. Norton's case, were ex- ceedingly interesting, for from a child, I have sympa- thised deeply in her wrongs. And that noble "dis- course of Victor Hugo!"I had read it before, but was glad to read it again. Mrs. D's remarks on war, struck home to my heart, and I echo back her noble sentiments. I have copied a little poem, that was written for Burrit's paper, but as it is particularly ad- dressed to woman, I thought it might be republished just at this time, perhaps to advantage, and should they think best to give it a place in the "Una," it is at their service. I have not time to write any thing new at present, though they have my warmest sym- pathies, and best wishes; and I doubt not, if woman is true to her higher nature, if she does not quench the spirit that is struggling for utterance, she will yet have all the rights she desires; and, oh! may the time be not far distant, when thousands may make a better use of those which they already enjoy.

ACCORDING to my promise, I have made a beginning in those "series of letters," which,- desired me to forward him from time to time, as the "spirit" should prompt. I feel it would be selfish in me to turn aside from this appeal, (however much I may shrink from any publicity,) when I remember by whom it was made. I cannot forget, if I would, the early and tried friend, who found me in comparative dark. ness, and who so kindly took me by the hand,-aiding me in my slow and toilsome ascent, tenderly removing the stumbling stones that would have proved impass- able barriers to one possessed of so little physical strength; cheering and and encouraging the timid one, till she, too, at last, gained a view, a far off view, (but only the more desired and yearned for,) of the green, waving fields of Literature and Science. And now, when a trifling boon is asked, as a slight compensa. tion, shall I turn away, and not even make an attempt to prove my gratitude? Knowing, as I well kno, that even should I fail, I have only to take refuge in the large charity of the same kind friend. No, no, I am ready to try, even should I fail. I will not be dis. couraged, when the whole current of my being sets toward this outward expression of the interior thoughts and emotions of the soul, and in which I am as, anx- ious as he could wish me to be, to utter worthily, if at all.

When beings, who are destined to be blessed with real friendship, meet for the first time in the world, does it not seem that they find and recognize each other, as if an indistinct presentment had announced them to one another? It is because each finds in the other some traits of that excellence, which was already the object of his devotion; and on the friend thus chosen, is bestowed a portion of this devotion." "He who rightly trusts, shows that he has seen the deity face to face; and there is, perhaps, no higher, moral gratification on earth than this- if sense and testimony attack the friend in your heart to hurl him thence, even then to stand by him with the God in you, to preserve and to love him, not as formerly, but more deeply." TUESDAY EVENING, Oct. 30th, 1855. MY OWN DEAR JULIA!-for she is still mine, even though she may have passed into the spirit-land, as I have sometimes felt she had, when such longings have taken possession of me, to see her dear face once more in this world! To-day, I have such a yearning to hear of her welfare-to know whether she, or any of her dear ones, have been swept away by the " chol- era," that has been raging in Pittsburg and Alleghany, as I have seen all along by the papers.    Her last let- ter is lying by my side. I have read it over and over, and while doing so, I have felt as though I must fly to her! It is very hard that I cannot sit by her side, and look into her sweet face, giving and receiving the kiss   of love! I am so occupied with household cares and duties, that I have to postpone from time to time, what I would gladly be doing now. Such has been the case with my writing to her. I would have written her every day, had it been possible, and I should have been more than repaid, could I have known it had given her a mo- ment's satisfaction. I hope I may hear ere long, if it is only a line; but so fearful am I of taxing her little strength, it would not pain me as much as I once thought it would, to see another hand-writing, instead of her own; telling me all about the dear one, who in times past could tell me every thing herself, and whose precious let- ters are among my choicest treasures. I wrote her a week ago, and I trust it has reached her, ere this. When I read her last, I thought I would write often to her in the form of a journal, but I have been suffering from a difficulty of the heart, and I could not use my arms, without producing the pain; consequently, writing was out of the question. Oh! darling, day after day, I have wished that some spiritual communication might reach thee, breathing out all the love and regret, that lay in this poor, beating, throbbing heart, that has given me so much trouble.

It is here now, and we cannot believe it." This sad intelligence, darkened all of the dav and many hours of the night. I had been expect- ing it for a long time, and had striven to prepare muyself to meet it, but is it possible for us ever to be prepared for such losses? And then, the bitterrcgret, that I could not have seen her once more in this world! And oh! how I wish that I had made extra exertions to have written her every week, during the past summer, but I feel that she comprehends it all now! We loved and trusted each other so entirely, that if years had elapsed and not a line had passed between us-not a shadow or doubt could have risen in the mind of either; for hlead not our souls been bound together by a holy tie, never to be sundered throughout time and eternity? I was very miserable for a season, after I knew the worst; but I began to think of her; of all that she had been to me from the day we first met; of our last par- ting; of her inspired words, and graceful motions ; and a sweet peace a holy calm fell upon me, and I felt that she was near-nearer than when her loving and yearn- ing spirit was fettered by the frail tabernacle of clay. I asked no questions, but welcomed the angel of resig- nation, and sleep fell upon my heavy eyelids. Yes, terday, I read all her letters-long, tender and beau. tiful epistles: faithful transcripts of her own true wo- man's heart. I have always felt, when with her, and when reading her letters, (and now more than ever,)   INVALID'S JOURNAL.        41 that she gave to her friend, too exalted a position; and I think, now that the veil has been removed, she will see me il a different light.  But surely I should be willing that she should see me as God sees me! There was a feeling of surprise and chastened awe, while reading some of those letters. I quote from one writ- ten more than seven years ago-and I had forgotten entirely, that such words had ever been penned to me. She says:-"We have formed a society, which is to include both music and reading. I only wish you could be one of our number. It is such a blessed privilege to have such a friend as you, dearest,-one to whom I can open my inmost heart, and feel sure of finding sympathy and congeniality of feeling. Oh what a strange world this is, where all our best thoughlts and feelings-our truest, purest affections, must be re- pressed or crushed. Oh! Elise; my dear, dear Elise, how I wish I could talk with you have only one quiet day with you! You never misunderstood me, and from you I always get courage and strength to go on." And again, "Oh! I do sometimes so long tobe away- "To be a purefree mind, and dwell with God." I should then only be withdrawn from the eyes of my friends on earth. I should be near them still-.-and there are some with whom I might yet hold sweet commun- ion. If I should die, dearest, before you, do not feel that I have left you. Think of me, and love me still; and doubt not that I shall be often with you, especially in those moments, when sad and weary, the heart wants sympathy and companionship, and fails to find it here. Oh I that it might be my mission to cheer such lonely ones.

If so, dearest, and if you should go first, will you not come to me sometimes, and soothe and cheer, when I am weary and sad? But you must not die ; I cannot be deprived of my sweet sister spirit, yet! How much I have thought of you this summer. How much I have talked with you. Do you never hear me? It seems as if my ear- nest thought must almost have reached you, sometimes." I might go on quoting from these precious letters all night; but was it not strange that those very words, were there that I so much stood in need of? In the first letter I ever received from her, it will be seen, by her own words, how truly the key-note of our souls was struck, even in our earliest intimacy. Listen to its vibrations. "Do you remember that when we were alone that afternoon, an acquaintance of mine called? A social, lively, little lady she was, but I shall never forget the entire change of feeling that her pres- ence produced in me. I felt as if I had been suddenly transported, from a warm genial clime, to one of icicles, which though they. were dazzlingly bright in the sun, and had a sort of ringing music of their own, yet threw a freezing spell over me, and I felt that it was an effort for me to speak one word. The thought came into my mind then, that we might spend a whole lifetime in daily converse, and yet not know each oth- er as well as you and I, after one hour's conversa- tion."

She was a hard student; one sure to bring reputation to a teacher and a school. Teachers are seldom slow, to profit by such schoolars; and she was pressed on and on, through sciences, languages and accomplishments, after giving all of her days and the greater part of her nights to study. A member of the Protestant Episcopal Church, from early youth, she died in its communion, and had ever the largest love and sympathy for all that was Christ- like in any denomination or individual. For some years before her death, she was unable to attend church; and in this time appeared to have been so directly taught of God, that her opinions on relig- ous subjects were like inspiration: the practical teach- ings of the New Testament were all in all, the theo- ries built upon them as nothing; and when deprived of the use of the institutions of religion, she lost the need of them. When asked, near the close of her protracted illness, if she would like prayers offered for her, in the church, she said Oh, no ! I have no need of them; for the Saviour is so near. He answers my petitions before I can utter them. He does not wait to be entreated." When asked if she was not anxious to die a happy death, she answered. , No, but I am anx- ious to live a good life. Let my life testifiy that I belong to Christ, and my Father may send me what- ever kind of death pleases Him. The time of dying is but a little while, and I know that it is all happiness after that."

She requested that her body might be prepared for the grave, in a muslin shroud, because this was a dress the the industrious poor could afford for their loved dead, without injury to the living. Thus, in all her calcula- tions and opinions, shone forth her appreciation of the brotherhood of man, of the greatness of a human soul, which raises the possesor above all fictitious, earthly distinctions. Withl her central idea fixed in heaven she was with us as one of us; not as an enthusiast or an abstraction; but as a sister; so much like an angel of light, and yet so unconscious of any superiority." Such, was my precious and beloved friend, as viewed by another. What she was to me, her written words can- not even tell, though they are such faithful transcripts of her own purified spirit. I said, I always felt that she placed me too higlh that she gave to me a spiritual life and beauty, that I did not possess, or at least was unconscious of. Especially would I realize this, when she spoke of my letters, I, who never wrote a letter (as it seems to me) in the true acceptation of the term, who only gave out now and then, a few fragmentary inarticulate heart-throbs,-how  strangely would her language fall upon my ear, and with w hat an humbled chastened spirit, would I pray that it might indeed be true!

To my spiritual perceptions,-they speak volumes of the heart's history; of a heart purified by suffering and filled with higher, purer. aspirations than this world can ever sat- isfy.

They cannot be tears of sadness, for love and jov are certainly not sorrowful emotions; and indeed I have not room for such when communing with you.

Sometimes, even, when the idea that I would express fails to find utter. ance, you seem to catch the germ of thought by intui. tion, and send it back to me a lovely, blooming flower, so soothing and cheering in its fragrance and quiet beauty.

I have been looking over some of the letters I wrote her, during that absence. She left them, (the old ones,) at home, knowing well that the new ones would take up all the spare room. When I glance at the the tame, common place remarks with which we com- mence our letters, I think of what dear J. P. said in one of her epistles to me. "What is it that always chokes my pen, and chokes my poor throat till the tears come, whenever I attempt to write to( you? I think it must be because of the multitude of thoughts, feelings and emotions which come rushing along at once,-all struggling to get out first, and so gorging the narrow channel of communication that the waters must of course overflow their banks.

The one prayer of my heart, since I have been a mother, has been, " let them be pure in heart." I have not asked for temporal blessings, or worldly honors, but I have striven and agonized for this.

If, in the future, she should feel that it would be an aid to her spiritual growth, to become a member of a church, God grant her grace and strength to do so, but never forJashion's sake, or to run from one extreme to another; for I think there is as much sin committed, in running to church too much, to the neglect of one's health, and social, or home duties as there is in seeking worldly pleasures. One, whose thought -is at all times deep and wise, because simple and true, has said, " obedience is better than sacrifice;" that the way to benefit our fel- low-creatures most, and cultivate best our own natures, is by knowing and obeying all the Iaws of God; for those laws are in perfect harmony each with the other, and we are never required to sacrifice the real well being of our own souls in order to do good to others, nor will such a sacrifice of ourselves be a real benefit to others." *  *   *   X  I have listened to several conversations on Solger's lecture on woman, that were very interesting. I re- gret, now, that I did not hear it, the better to judge   INVALID 'S  JOURNAL.      53 for myself. In regard to the inferiority of woman; or her equality to mian, that question does not disturb me, except when I hear it argued upon foolishly. As dear L. says: "I am satisfied in regard to that point, with the belief, that among the greatest and best men who have ever lived, there have been none so superior, that woman could not understand and sympathize with their highest and noblest conceptions." I believe God created man and woman to be one though I acknowl- edge, with deep humiliation, that they have become widely sundered; yet such was the original design of the All-wise Father. It seems to me, no true gentle- man would arrogate to himself or to his sex, a supe- riority over the other half of the race, whom God cre- ated to form a " whole," and it is only in this light they can be viewed or spoken of. I understand thlat Emerson and Parker have told him that he must not deliver that lecture again; and that he has since said, that had he thought more on the subject, and had the conversations, he has since had, with several true and noble-minded women, he surely should not have given it to the public in that form, but should have qualified very much. I doubt whether Robert Browning would take that view of the sex, if he judged of them by that "perfect wife" of his, who is ever by hJis side. Let man be the head but woman must be the heart.

I have not read a word about "1Maud," or Browning's new book. Though I know the former has been severely criticised; yet to me there is a perfect charm in and through the whole poem. I do not think those persons who cry out against it so, have a clear idea of the poet's conception in regard to the work. I look upon it as a portraiture, or a series of pictures, of the internal workings or states of mind of one who has been outraged from his birth, and who has become sensitively morbid, and suspicious of every thing around him, yet whose- noble and delicate nature abhors all wrong and injustice. Compared with other poems of Tennyson's, it will not stand so high as a work of art, and such was not the intention of the au- thor, it seems to me; but if he has been true to what he aimed at, that is all we have to do with. We may quarrel with the subject, but surely it seems to me if we look at it impartially, not with the way it has been handled by the poet. People are very apt to inveigh against lore, as though there could be no such thing in the world- and when a skillful operator lays bare its se- cret springs, giving a faithful transcript of the tortured heart's hopes and fears they call it " maudlin."

In this respect, I am (indeed) like the poet: "Contented if I may enjoy The things which others understand." Mrs Browning could not have written such a poem as  "Saul," neither do I think Robert Browning could have written   the ' Seraphim" or "Lady   Geraldine's Courtship," yet each can appreciate the subtile and del- icate points of the other. It makes my heart glad when I think of two such natures coming together, where the husband can say, from the depths of a full heart, such words as these.

And do we not stand in need of them? Marriage. to me, is the most awfully solemn act of our lives. Yet we cannot but judge from the reckless manner in which hun- dreds enter upon it, that they feel little and think less. It has always been my firm belief, that there is not that man living, who can comprehend, to its full extent, the position of woman, when she surrenders her earth- ly all to the keeping of another: when she consents to become the wife of one, even whom she loves better than life, and whom her own heart had chosen from all the world beside. If genuine love continues to the end; if sympathy, which is dearer than all, cements the bond; sickness, poverty, and all, things may be cheer- fully borne for each others sake. But, ah, it is a del- icate flower, that cannot stand in the burning rays of the sun, with no gentle dews to water it, without drooping.

He politely pointed to one, asking me if I had any interest in it. I replied, "I did not know but the largest share of my heart was in it." He seemed surprised; we had some pleasant conversation; he told me he was from the "Tropics," and was most frozen to death; that he would not live in New-York, if they would give him    the whole city. He had no sympathy with the fashionable places of resort, during the summer seasons; thoulght them altogether too exclusive; contrasted the life at New- port, and other watering places, with the social gath- erings of the South. We spoke of Fanny Kemble, and her views of the "best society" of N. Y. and other American cities. He seemed to sympathize truly in her untoward fortunes; said he was present at her first performance in this country, and he thought her at that time, the most beautiful woman he ever saw; thought herpossessed of wonderful genius, and strength.

I told him I thought every true woman's heart must be opposed to the whole system. He said we knew nothing- here, at the North, of the institution of slavery, as it really existed; that they would have slaves in Massachusetts if the soil was suited for them. I told him, I thought all who possessed the true spirit, acted conscientiously in striving to do unto others, as they would be done by; having that passage of script. ure in my mind: "Remember those in bonds as bound with them." "Yes, yes," he replied,/" that's it. Let them take a few of those simple phrases, containing so much, and be guided by them, and they would do very differently." I saw he had mistaken my mean- ing. I then spoke of the deleterious effects it has upon man and woman,-causing them to become savaoe and tyrannical in nature, from believing themselves possessed of absolute power. He said this was some- times the case, but not often. He had known instances where, if either were abused, it was their own children; because, the slave- being injured, they felt their prop. erty was at stake. Ah! yes; the poor chattel was looked after, because it was a chattel; but the im- mortal part of both children and slaves, was over. looked, and I thought this told more against the sys- tem, than other things we had spoken of.

That would apply to all white mothers, but not to the poor slave mother! He intro- duced me to the Captain, and then took his leave. I bade him farewell with sorrow and regret in my heart, that one so courteous in manner, and seemingly possessed of many noble virtues, could be so entirely blinded on the great question of human freedom; re- cognizing, and justifying an institution, that not only tramples upon the physical organization, but often times denies that those men and women have souls that are to exist throughout the countless ages of eternity.

But his kindness in this instance, proved a misfortune; for he no sooner had spoken to her than she seemed to have a spite against me. She did not answer him, but turned to another person- near, and said, " half past seven is not very early." This was in reply to his remark that he hoped to be up himself. In the morning, I might have slept an hour longer, if I could only have got an an- swer from her in regard to the time. I was so fearful of being left, I could not be quiet. When the cars were ready to start, she turned to those passengers who were in the other part of the cabin, and said, "all you have to do, is to take your seat in the cars ;" so I took my carpet bag and followed them.

XVI. WE left P., Tuesday eve, for -- , and had a delight ful ride through the country, by the light of a most glorious moon. I was sad and tired, but a dream-like feeling stole over me, and it seemed like riding through fairy-land. It is so seldom that I have a chance to see the moon in all its glory, and to lay aside the cares of this working-day world, that the capacity for- enjoyment seemed intensified by this unlooked for pleasure. All fear of danger-all thought of the mor- row-was forgotten; and I revelled in the emotions of quiet joy that pervaded my spirit. Yet ever and anon the " shadow on the way," came between my soul and its soothing rest, and I would have to face it, and then strive to banish it by drinking in the unutterable beauty ia which I was enveloped.

There is something so delightful to me, in this; a sense of pro- tection, and yet of out-going life; a calm satisfaction that I cannot describe. There are no precipices to startle, no fear of collision. The muffled sound of the horse's hoofs, and the rustling of the leaves, bring nought but a sense of quiet enjoyment. In the'afternoon, we went to the "Shore," passing through the woods on our way, listening to the soothing music of the tail pines. There were birch, maple, juniper, and other    <pb n="64-65" xml:id="VAC6530-00000038"/> "EAVES FROM AN trees. But the pines I what is the peculiar charm of the pine, that makes us single it out, above all other trees of the forest ? I know not. Perhaps it would not make such an impression on us, if it stood alone. How harmonious are all God's arrangements! Who could alter to improve ? Would that I lived where I could spend whole days in the woods. There are the ferns, the mosses, the laurel, and many other wood plants, that I never tire looking at. And there, too, for the first time in my life, I saw the sensitive plant. There is a wonderful charm connected with this delicate, shrinking little plant, both in the leaves and flowers. There was such an upspringing life in it, as it stood there, in its green beauty, that I shrank from touching it,-having an intuitive feeling that it would be pained by the contact. Yet I could not leave it; so we gently dislodged the roots, and I was rejoicing in the pos- session of my treasure, when, lo! as I looked upon it, it had been suddenly transformed.  The exquisite leaves were contracted; its green beauty had vanished; and it lay there, like a crushed and heart-broken wo- man, whom the world had dealt harshly with, and who had been foully betrayed, by those in whom she had fondly trusted. I put it in a tumbler of water; but all of the next day it remained the same, and it spoke to my heart of those delicate human plants, who had been as suddenly crushed, by some rude hand. To my surprise, however, the morning following, it was clothed in all its former life and beauty. I rejoiced at this, and to make sure of its longer sojourn, I added more water, not touching it in the least; but it imme- diately drooped, to revive no more.   And there, too, lay the river, in its quiet beauty, reflecting back the blue heaven, above; and although there was a sad event connected with this same river, yet it was hard for us to realize aught of death, while looking upon its still waters. Is it not often so with human faces ? Do we not see them exteriorly calm ? but we know that at times the waters have been dark and turbulent, and the poor human heart has sunk down, down, till that, too, had been engulfed in the dark waters of despair. But the stranger would not think this, for the troubled waves had passed over; the sunbeams rested on the chastened and subdued face; and that face, like the river, reflected naught back, but the image of Heaven !

As I stood in the center, directly under the dome, I fancied that some magic spell had conveyed me to the Eastern land of "Aladdin," and that this fairy-like building, unique in its entire con- struction and arrangements, had suddenly dropped down, or risen up in the night-time, to make us have more faith in the marvellous stories that we drank in so eagerly in our childhood. Next to the charm of the building itself, was my surprise at the room, the freedom every one could enjoy there. I had shrank from going; having a secret dread of being in a crowd, and if any accident should occur, the impossibility of extricating one's self from it; but it was just the reverse of all this. I never realized, for a moment, that it was a place where thou- sands resorted. There was no eagerness, no rudeness, no noise. We spent nearly the whole day there, and  although weary and exhausted after the extra exer- tions, I went home in a kind of clairvoyant state, un-   INVALID'S  JOURNAL.       67 conscious of getting in and out of carriages, of pass- ing over the ground, of every thing unpleasant, as I always do, after attending one of the "Germania" concerts. The sense of beauty had been so complete, so perfect, that it had harmonized the inner with the outer world; and I floated along, it seemed to me ,as the clouds float, unconscious of any impediment. There was but one thing that disturbed me, in the arrange- ment of the articles, and that was "Power's Statu- ary" being placed just where it was. I felt it ought to have had a little niche, that would have been conse- crated by its presence, as Thorwalsden's was. I had seen the "Greek slave," shielded in this way before, and at one time, for nearly an hour, alone, and-it seemed to me the sacredness of her grief, demanded this se- clusion. It could not, however detract from the exquis- ite conception and mechanism of this, to me, unrivalled statue. We stayed till evening, and saw the building illuminated, and heard the rushing noise of the foun- tain, whose cooling, feathery spray sparkled in the gas-light. But when the glorious music burst upon us; wave upon wave of harmony, tumultous, and sub- lime; the charm was wonderful beyond any thing I had conceived of. It was too much for our little boy, who sank down, trembling from head to foot; weeping and gasping for breath. We carried him out into the fresh air; and as soon as he revived, took our seats in a stage for home. I have visited it several times, since, and each time, have been more conscious of the beauty of its architecture, and of the rare gems of art that have been collected from every nation. \,    <pb n="68-69" xml:id="VAC6530-00000040"/> 68        LEAVES    FROM   AS  I stood beneath thy mighty dome; Yet, fairy-like, it seemed to me, Where winged thoughts at will might roam, In love with faultless symmetry  Thy fair proportions filled my soul, With a new joy unknown before; Bearing me back, without control, To my young days, and dreams of yore.

How many passages of scripture fasten themselves on the mind and heart, and come before us, when we stand most in need of them. Jn deep affliction, or when the storm rages, this awe inspiring sentence is ever with me-an unseen presence, but mighty in its influence-rising above all the din and uproar of the elements. "Be still, and know that I am God."   Again, when I hear the roar and moan of the ocean, my spirit in deep sadness, repeats the soothing     declaration, "There shall be no more sea."     Many times have I   INVALID'S JOURNAL.        69 been present, but a silent listener, when theological questions have been earnestly discussed; and as the cloud gathered around me, and I became bewildered, these memorable words have fallen on mine ear, so quieting in their marvellous beauty:--"Let not your heart be troubled; ye believe in God, believe also in me. In my father's house are many mansions; if it were not so I would have told you. I go to prepare a place for you." And when the heart is full, and the bitter waters come bubbling up,though we strive so hard to repress them, the angel whispers, "Jesus wept,"- then are we more patient with ourselves, and the tears flow freely. But there is not a passage more emphatic, and at the same time more cheering and comforting to the afflicted soul, than this: "It is I, be not afraid." In the hour of trial, when the clouds of adversity dar- ken our path, and there appears not one ray of light to guide our steps; when the-tempest roars, and death, that grim tyrant, stares us in the face; then it is that this sublime and soothing passage comes with all its force, and calms the troubled soul of man. What a blessing these words of comfort have been to mankind,ever since they were uttered by our Saviour! The child, when in the dark,hears a footstep approach; its little heart beats faster; but the mother's voice falls upou the ear, "it is I love, be not afraid," and all is peace in the infant's bosom. Oh! is it not beautiful to contemplate the child's reliance on its mother, but infinitely more so, to see the young leaning with that same reliance on the bosom of their Saviour.

Suddenly it gasps-it breathes once more, and all is over, and that wretched mother sits almost distracted. In her despair she cries, "My child! my child! who has taken it from me? was it not mine own?"But a light breaks in upon her, and a voice whispers-"Thy child is not dead, but sleepeth; it is I, be not afraid." Again we kneel beside the death bed of the loved one, and ever and anon a shade of doubt and anxiety passes over the pale face as the shadow of death falls upon it; and like the mariner, tossed upon the ocean wave, without compass or a guiding star, so is the loved one, until we rouse the scattered senses by whis- pering the blessed assurance of our Saviour, "Though you pass through the valley and the shadow of death, yet will I not leave thee; it is I, be not afraid." And we have the satisfaction of knowing it is all sufficient. The eye brightens; there is hope beyond the grave. The immortal part has winged its way to the spirit- land. Oh I may I ever call to mind these words of our blessed Saviour-"It is I, be not afraid"-and I think I may bear the ills of life, and the approach of death, without a murmur. NO. XX. DECEMBER 12th.

I must have improved, to love him as 1 do." But a few words " to mothers," I cannot forbear quoting for my journal. "If you once believe that every thing depends on education, what name do you deserve, when, pre- cisely as your position is high, you entrust the educa- tion of your children to persons of lower rank; and while the children of the middle class, have their pa- rents, those of the higher classes have only nurses and maids, as the directors of their path in life? It is true, that the sacrifices you make for the world, will be little known by it. Men govern and earn the glory; and the thousand watchful nights and sacrifices, by which a mother purchases a hero, or a poet, for the state, are forgotten, not once counted; for the mothers them- selves do not count them; and so, one century after another, do mothers, unnamed and unthanked, send forth the arrows, the suns, the storm-birds, and the nightingales of time! But seldom does a Cornelia find a Plutarch, who connects her name with the Gracchi. Twice, however, you will not be forgotten.

On the blue mountains of our dim childhood, towards which we ever turn and look, stand the mothers who marked out to us from thence our life. The most blessed age must be forgotten ere we can forget the warmest heart." I feel deeply grate- ful towards those who first led me to read, and soon, very soon to appreciate the literature of Goethe, Schil- ler, Richter, Herder, and many others. I remember from this distant date, how --  came to me with a package of books, and said, "If you were invited to enter a gar- den, where you would see every thing beautiful in na- ture and in art; rare flowers, fine paintings, and ex- quisite statuary; but, now and then, interspersed, you would meet with something that would offend your taste, and give you momentary pain, what would you do,--go in, or stay out?" "Go in, I replied." Then read s"Wilhelm Meister," (said he) and the three vol- umes were laid upon my table. But shall I ever love Goethe so well as I do Schiller? I fear not; yet it may be because I am only a child in knowledge, as yet. If I ever live to be a woman, I may think and feel diffrent- ly about these things. I have a little " bust" of each of them, and the members of the family have settled it in their minds, that the cold marble even of Schiller's is dearer to me than the lighter parian of Goethe's; and -  says it must be "lightly touched" for it is   INVALID ' JOURNAL.        73 one of my "household Gods."

I never take the pen in my hand, or take up a book, but I feel, as I fancy a child must feel, who is conscious of doing something that would be condemned if it were found out; and when my heart is full-when I have looked upon beautiful objects, or listened to the relation of a noble action, or been overpowered by the magic strains of music-then, when that mysterious thrill creeps over me, and the tears spring to my eyes; oh! how longingly do I yearn to give vent to the thoughts and emotions that oppress me. But I have' to turn away from the temptation. I dare not look upon the blank paper, or the fascinating page. Ah! how blessed those beings must be, who feel perfect freedom to write when they please, and as long as they please. But do they realize this blessing? NO. xXI. JAN&amp;UMYO tst.

It seems as if there is.    <pb n="74-75" xml:id="VAC6530-00000043"/> ?4      LEAVES FROM   AN no language wherewith to express the far-reaching perception-the all-comprehending knowledge he has of the soul. His "Life of Schiller" was written (Goethe says) as only a German could have conceived of, and written out the German character. Then came his "Miscellanies;" and what could give greater de- light to all genuine lovers of the Scottish Bard, than his article on Burns? His "French Revolution" is a rare poem; few such have ever been written out. His" "Sartor Resartus" is all Gilfillan says it is. His "Past and Present" was just the book that was needed at the time it was written. Yet, if he had never written any other than this, "Heroes and Hero-worship," it would stamp him, to my mind, one of the most won- derful men and writers of this or any age. When he fastens his far-seeing, fathomless eye, upon an indivi- dual, it is to set about ploughing furrow after furrow, till he gets to the deepest deep of the spirit that is in him; and then, with that large charity which is the crowning characteristic of those persons who have the power of reading the poor human heart's hopes, fears, and struggles, he gives a faithful portraiture of that being, so that others may draw near and admire; but who would have passed heedlessly by, perchance, lacking the genius and godlike power of penetrating the inmost of man's spiritual nature. I remember, some years ago, of reading an article on Carlyle, and his writings, in a quarterly review, where the author said, you would turn page after page over, expecting and hoping that some thought or idea was coming, but it never came! II cannot conceive of any person's saying this in honesty and good faith , but if that fact   INVALID'S JOURNAL.        75 is indeed true, lie must first have bound thiok leathern spectacles over his eyes, and then endeavored, vainly, as it seems, to get at Carlyle's spirit, through his written word. But the most satisfactory book to. me, that Carlyle has written, is his "Life of Sterling." What other biography ever penetrated and grasped the whole spiritual being, as that has done? There, you get at the genuine tenderness, and true pathos, that, after all, is the foundation stone in Carlyle's own character; and you feel, after reading this book, that your knowledge of him would have been one-sided, had he not set about the "' duty," which he felt it to be, to give to the world the true life of John Sterling. Does Emerson's calmness proceed from greater strength, or does it arise from a different physical and mental organization? Calmness is born of suffer- ing, it is said; but is Emerson capable of suffering as keenly as Carlyle? I know not, but it seems to me that he is invulnerable, while Carlyle is open at all points, and has to struggle with a giant's strength, to turn aside the poisoned shafts. He sees " the death- less sorrow and pain" everywhere; but lie sees, too, the " victory which is also deathless." What he says of Dante's portrait, applies to himself-his spirit face, as I conceive it. "To me, (he says,) it is a most touching face; perhaps of all faces that I know, the most so. I think it is the mournfullest face that was ever painted from reality; an. altogether tragic, heart-affecting face. There is in it, as foundation of it, the softness, tenderness, gentle affection as of a child; but all this is as if congealed into sharp contradic tion, -into abnegation, isolation, proud, hopeless pain.

This is Dante; so he looks, this " voice of ten silent centuries," and sings us " his mystic, unfathomable song." Again, he says, "I know not in the world an affection equal to that of Dante. It is a tenderness, a trembling, longing, pitying love, like the wail of Eolian harps, soft, soft; like a child's young heart;-and then, that stern, sore-saddened heart I These longings of his towards his Beatrice; their meeting together in the Paradiso; his gazing in her pure, transfigured eyes- her that had been purified by death so long, separated from him so far; ah! one likens it to the song of an- gels; it is among the purest utterances of affection; perhaps the very purest that ever came out of a human soul." Carlyle thinks and writes of individual souls-Em- erson, of Soul; and that is the reason, perhaps, inour imperfect state we draw nearer Carlyle; yet I cannot but feel that every soul has the power of arriving at the truth; and when once there, it is all harmonious, and we lose sight of the individual, in the grand and sublime whole! Margaret Fuller suffered, as it seems to me, unnecessarily, when she first made Emerson's acquaintance, from this peculiar characteristic of his nature. She compared him to a tall palm, that had grown too high to shade the weary traveller at its foot. Speaking of George Sand, she says, ' I saw, as    INVALID'S JOURNAL.        7 one sees in her writings, the want of an independent in- terior life; but I did not feel it as a fault, there is so much in her of her kind." Had Margaret possessed this in its fulness and purity, she would not have felt as she did when she first met Emerson; nor would she have hastened into a marriage, that caused dark fore- bodings to knock at the door of her heart;-making her question (from the unfitness, as she herself could not help feeling it to be, of her choice,) the strength and durability of her husband's love. Poor Margaret! it is to be hoped that she found the " living spring," at last, as she says the weary pilgrim did: and that he rested, and refreshed himself, and looked back with less pain at the unsympathizing palm, which yet towered in the distance. When reading her "Me- moirs," and thinking of her world-wide celebrity, I ever ask myself, if those things have been any balm to her mother's heart! Soothing, and gratifying, it could not but be, to a sensitive and loving nature, to have the dear ones beloved and respected by the noble and the good; but is not the sad refrain-the tragic end--ver present in that mother's heart?

A young Germain- the music teacher in the academy where I boarded- gave me an account of her leave-taking, and her ap- pearance on the occasion.

There were two, however, that we both read years ago, and liked so much,-that little poem by Lowell, "The vision of Sir Launfal," and "Angela," by Mrs. Marsh. Mrs. Jameson's "Characteristics," is one of the "gold books," to me. I never think of her, without a thrill of pride and delight. She is, indeed, won- drously gifted with subtile powers of analysis, with strength and far seeing vision; but more than all to me, is that crowning glory of sweet womanliness, which, like a bridal veil, falls gracefully around her; so pure and transparent, you can see the guileless workings of her heart beneath. Margaret Fuller says, "Sex is but an accident of birth." I cannot think so; I believe there is a deep meaning in this manhood and womanhood. I have always blessed God for the woman's soul, which He bestowed upon me, notwithstanding my life of suffer- ing; and I cannot remember a time, even from my earliest childhood, when life was not a burden-when I did not have to struggle to live. 'Tis true, I feel woman's wrongs most deeply, and it is ever a source of bitter anguish to me, that she can, but rarely, be free and spontaneous in her manner and utterances, without having her words and actions misconstrued by man, who, at all times, should be her supporter, and encourage the living out her true life. This, at times, has been a barrier to me in my in- tercourse with the other sex; and it has made me look yearningly forward to the spirit home, where no such obstacles can exist.

I have, with a few exceptions, ever found (even in life-long friendships) men, noble and good enough, to comprehend a woman's whole nature;, and with my erratic spirit, which is so apt to fly from one extreme to another, how necessary it is, that I should come in contact with those only, who can read aright that spirit and its moods. Margaret Fuller, too, was greatly blessed. She was surrounded by noble souled, liberal, cultured men, who could appreciate her na- ture, notwithstanding all her eccentricities, and rev- erence it. put I was thinking of books and authors, and I ought not to forget "'Alton Locke."

It is worthy the author of "Uncle Tom." In this last work, she has taken the subject up, just where she left off in the former, and the argument is perfect. The most- painful chapter, judg- ; ing from the hints I have heard dropped here and there, I did not read.

At present, however, I do not think it well for me to persevere in reading anything that will have a tendency to leave a lasting impression where the effect is painful. I re- member when reading the death of the child wife, in Dickens "David Copperfield," how it overpowered me. It was no longer a picture, but a living reality; and for a week or more, I felt as though a personal calamity had befallen myself. But there was one scene in that book, that I could never turn to again. It was where the cruel Murdock was putting blows, thick and fast, on poor little David, who had crept noiselessly away, with his sorrowful heart, to the lonely attic. I was almost suffocated; and I could not restrain my indignation against that weak ,and, as it seemed to me at the time, wicked mother, for placing herself in a position, that would give such a being authority over her tender hearted little son. Dickens, more than any other au- thor, has the power of descending into the heart of a lit- tle child; of reading the whole spiritual nature, with all its hopes, fears, and disappointments. But "Dred,"- I had put off reading it for some time, thinking and fearing that I should be disappointed, as I had been in reading "Shirley," and Villette ;" not that Charlotte Bronte failed in those volumes, had she written them before writing "Jane Eyre." The chief charm to me in "Dred," was the way in which the author treated the subject of love. I had been heartily sick of the whole tribe of heroes who felt it a duty to mould and to make those beings, who in process of time were to become their wives, forgetting that God caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam, while He was fashioning Eve; 8    <pb n="86-87" xml:id="VAC6530-00000049"/> 86      - LEAVES FROM   AN and perhaps such heroes, would lay the charge ofher sin and fall to that account. Had they had the moulding and making, she would have behaved better I There was Mr. John, in the "Wide Wide World"-and there was the miraculous "Winthrop," in a book by the same au. thor. And there was St. John, in Jane Eyre-on a broader, nobler scale, because of marble; while the others were of doubtful flesh and blood. The only thing that gave me patience to read St. John to the end, way, that he found it beyond his power to make over our little "Janet." Her God-given instincts, her own individuality, stood by her in her hour of ter- ror and weakness,-giving her strength to rise above the yearnings of her heart, the loneliness of her situa- tion; but more than all, over that fearful spirit who was using all his power and will to overpower her. The man who does not reverence the individuality of the woman he is endeavoring to win for his wife, is not wor- thy to have a wife. If he succeeds in finding one who has no more character, than to lay aside her individu- ality for the purpose of pleasing another fallible being, his whole after life will be a comment on his choice. Man wants a helpmate; woman wants a helpmate; they do not wish to marry their echoes. They think to sanction these things, by calling it religion; but to me, it seems like cant, and nothing else.

How deeply grateful am I to Mrs. Stowe, for this true, and genuine picture, of conjugal love. NO. XXIV. I have been reading "Aurora Leigh."  The first time, I read it through hastily; yet was conscious of deep satisfaction and gratitude and delight, inter- mingled with feelings of disquiet, and a dim forebo- ding that either I was incapable of comprehending the height and breadth of the author's philosophy; or that she had sent out a book, which, instead of being an aid to strengthen woman in her lonely and toilsome life, was to make her feel that it was impossible for her to live alone, and not repine at her fate. There was a vague sense of unfitness in its having been writ- ten in blank verse; that it would have been better had the story been told in prose; that, as a work of art, it was very faulty. I judge entirely from feeling, as I know nothing of the rules of Art; but throughout, the strength, far reaching thought, and at times the masterly execution of that thought, astonished me. When I finished the book, the predominant feeling was dissatisfaction and regret; for it seemed to me that the beautiful (as far as principle was concerned) superstructure Mrs. B. had been rearing for our admi-    <pb n="88-89" xml:id="VAC6530-00000050"/> 88      LEAVES FROM AN ration and benefit, had been suddenly overturned,-she herself removing the foundation! If the author meant to say that she had " failed," because she had cher- ished a willful pride, and had sinned in constantly de- nying her love for Romney; then I can understand her, as there "is nothing truly great but humility." But it seems to me she does not think, nor write, for those beings who may never have an opportunity to make known their love-who love hopelessly. Is the highest life shut out from the thousands of men and women who never marry; and from those sorrowing ones, upon whom the burdens of life have fallen heav- ily, who bear about in their bosoms aching hearts, yet whose very sorrows have led them to the fountain of all love, and they have risen to the light? The script- ure injunction, "Seek first the kingdom of Heaven, and all these things shall be added unto you," has been tested in their cases, and has not been found wanting. Is it not possible, if we have sought and found this kingdom of Heaven within, to realize by the fullness of our love, all external relations? are there any limits to this divine love? It seems to me we stand greatly in need of books that should prove as aids to strengthen and encourage those whose destiny it is to live alone, whether married or single; for there are those who are alone in spirit, though externally married, and to whom (it seems to me) as full, as rich, and as true a life is opened, as to those favored few, who have found their spirit's mate and are united to them in this world. Let us have books that shall teach us never to barter the highest within us, for the sake of any external advantage. Does the author   INVALID 'S JOURNAL.       ZY mean for us to throw aside all of those truly grand (grand because true) philosophical views that she ad- vanced throughout all the first part of her book, be- cause one woman finds out that she cannot be happy, without humbling her pride enough to confess that she does indeed love one who had tendered his love to her, many years before? It seems to me that it must have been a proud and happy moment for a true and noble minded woman, with the humblest heart beating in her bosom, and deeply conscious of having failed in realizing her highest ideal; of having missed of that peace and contentment that she ought to have arrived at, whatever the outward circumstances of her life might have been; but, alas! so few of us ever do arrive at. To have the man whom she secretly loves, but whom she could not conscientiously marry, at length standing before her; telling her earnestly that her writ- ten words had been the means of enabling him to stand on higher, broader ground, and to have a clearer vision of all things; and for this he had sought her presence to make known his gratitude. If Aurora had succeeded in proving to Romney that he was mistaken; that there was no reality in the new life and beauty that had at last dawned upon his spirit, and which her writings had been the means of imparting; it would have rendered him weak to the last. Without any compromise of womanly delicacy or dignity, it seems to me, she might have made known her love for him, instead of advising another to wed him, simply be- cause Romney was strong enough to be a good hus- band, and could surround his wife with every exter- nal comfort, rather than resting upon the true and 8*    <pb n="90-91" xml:id="VAC6530-00000051"/> 90      LEAVES FROM AN only foundation of marriage, mutual love; and when appealed to, her answer should have been, "If he loves thee better than all beside, and thou lovest him likewise, then art thou truly married, and it is wise and proper to seal it by an external sign." Could we have loved or respected Aurora, had she married Romney, on that June day? Was she not more worthy to be his wife, after all those years of " endless toil and endeavor?"I think she had reason to thank God for having been a medium of truth to others, if for nothing else; and I, for one, would be willing to suffer much, could I at last know that I had been the hum- ble instrument of good to others; of awakening in one of the lowest of God's creatures, truer and no- bler views of the life on earth, which is only the pre- 'lude to the life eternal! Is it not true, that the greater part of the miseries now in the world, spring from false views of marriage? that the existing state of things, grows out of mothers rearing their daugh- ters to believe that in marriage alone can they suc- teed in the world, and that it is a failure, if they do not get a husband, at whatever cost? And after read- ing this book, "Aurora Leigh," carefully, three times through, I can come to no other conclusion, but that at will have a tendency to confirm mothers in their already insane ideas on this subject of marriage; in- stead of arousing them to greater exertions to instil ,truth and honesty in the youthful minds of their chil- Adren, and in teaching them that every thing which pertaineth to their highest well-being, will be theirs, if they seek aright, whether married or single. Fred- ericka Bremer has done a good work for her sisters in   INVALID'S JOURNAL.        91 this respect. She exemplified it in her own life, and with true, God-given instinct, has striven to impart it to the suffering tried ones around her. Marrion, is the chief charm of the book, and it is in connection with her, that the true strength and beauty of Auro- ra's character is most conspicuous. She may be thought by some to be too intellectual for one born and brought up under such circumstances; but we must remember her thought is clothed in Aurora's language. Believing as I do, that the most unlettered child, if true to the divine intuitions of wisdom, can instinc- tively detect the highest spiritual truths,-though he or she may not be able to solve a single mathemati- cal problem,-Marrion's far-reaching thought, and deli- cate intuitive perceptions of the true and false in ev- ery thing, does not seem to me over-drawn; and in this respect, she is far above Aurora. She has given up Romney; she will never be married; but will her life prove a failure? Is not God still within, and Heaven all around her? It may be said that she had a child to live for; but Aurora had not only Marrion's child, but poor Marrion herself, to solace and to cheer; and is not God's world full of little children waiting and watching for the true sisters of charity to succor and to save? If I have failed in getting at the au- thor's true meaning, I trust I may yet read her book with different feelings, and do homage to the strength of thought, lofty genius, and purity of intuition, as I have heretofore always done. ,  .    <pb n="92-93" xml:id="VAC6530-00000052"/> 92       LEAVES FROM     AN NO.

Faith and love are all ideal, speaking with a music tone; And without their touch of magic, labor is the devil's own. Therefore are we glad to greet thee, master artist to thy place; For we need in all our living, beauty and ideal grace, Mostly here, to lift our nation, move its heart, and calm its nerves, And to round life's angled duties to imaginative curves.

Yet I have striven to rise above self, for the sake of the loved ones, and I sometimes think I have, in a measure, succeeded; for many come to me with their joys and sorrows.

"No wonder God made a world, to express his thought. Who, that has a soul for beauty, does not feel the need of cre- ating, and that the power of creation alone can satisfy the spirit?

They appertain exclusively to the spiritual, and not to the externals of life; and the beauty of the language and elevation of thought, were deemed sufficient reason to justify their publication, notwithstanding their frequent allusions to the author; who fears that her friend's too par- tial eye, and own spiritual emanations, caused a halo to encircle her, and that dearly loved one looked upon it admiringly, unconscious that it pro- ceeded from her own beautiful and purified spirit. She felt it would be a wrong done to herself, to send out a book of her heart histories, yet withhold, or disconnect it, from that precious friend, whose affection and aspirations had occupied so large a share in that heart's spiritual life and experience; and in those quotations which she has selected, the peculiar relation which existed between them, could most clearly be seen. She also feels that those "extracts" cannot but reflect more beauty on the "freed spirit" that uttered them, than on the " fettered one" which still remains behind.  E. N. G.   glinim-el    t n rauret a  te "Dear mother, why do you look so sad every day, and night too; and why do you keep looking out of the window? And when I ask you questions, you do not hear me, but sometimes say, " yes darling;" and then you say, ' mother did not understand you;" and often I see tears on your cheek-but you try to hide them from me. You did not use to cry; and when dear father camrne home, we used to be so happy!- Now, he does not laugh and talk, and take me on his knee, and let me lay my head upon his shoulder. Once, when I looked up in his face and kissed him, and said, " dear father," he would kiss me, and always call me his precious little Minnie. And little Charlie does not now creep up to him and say, "Papa," as he used to. .Why is all this, dear mother? I cannot go to sleep after you have kissed me and bid me good night; what is it dear mother? do tell your little Minnie." The mother clasped her child to her bosom, with a convulsive grasp, and the tears would force their way through the closed fingers, as she said, "My precious,    <pb n="106-107" xml:id="VAC6530-00000059"/> 106        M I N NIE, precious child! have I indeed betrayed the bitter an- guish of this tortured heart? I had hoped that thy childhood would be as sunny as was thy mother's; so that, in after life, it should be to thee ever as a beauti- ful dream of sunshine and of flowers. I have no right to drop pebbles into the pure and guileless fountain of thy innocent heart, and I have struggled hard not to do so; but thou art like that delicate plant that shrinks and trembles at the slightest approach, and closes its little petals even before the rude hand is laid upon it. 1 cannot deceive thee, my little cherished flower." Then, the mother put back the soft curls from her child's forehead, and gazed into those mild, thoughtful eyes,-thoughtful beyond their years,-and said, "what if thy fate should be like thy mother's!" And she clasped her close to her heart, and shuddered. She held her there, for a few moments, in silence, and then said "Minnie, my first-born darling -my precious one, I cannot tell thee what makes thy mother sad, and why a change has come over our once happy home, but thou wilt know it soon enough, for it comes on apace. I would not have a shadow darken thy pathway; but stern duties are before us both, and in stead of being refreshed with the flowers, thou wilt feel nothing but the thorns. Tis hard for me to think this, much more to speak it; but thou art old beyond thy years, and you and little Charlie are all I hat:e in the world,-now, now that I cannot."-She paused, for she could not speak against the father of that trusting, loving little being. Ella Howard was an only child; thile idol of her parents, the bright cherished flower that for seventeen summers, bloomed in their elegant and   A TEMPERANCE TALE.        107 tasteful mansion. But, although it was adorned with rare paintings and statuary; to their fond hearts, and to the hearts of their visitors, Ella seemed the most worthy of admiration. Simple in manners, and affec- tionate in heart; without one particle of coquetry, or af- feciation; she grew up beloved by all who knew her. Ella was a christian-thus following the example of her good and excellent parents. It seemed impossible for one constituted like herself, so thoughtful and affection- ate, to pass through life and not look above and be- yond it. She reverenced all she looked upon; the low- liest flower was a mystery to her mind; but, still, it spoke to her heart of the goodness of God. Ella had many suitors, but she loved one, and one only. They had grown up together; he was ever by her side, even in her childhood, when he watched every expression of her guileless face, and was eager to gratify her every wish, ere it was uttered. As she grew to womanhood, he regarded her as a holy and pure being, and the ear- nest wish of his heart was, that he might be worthy of her affection. All who looked upon the manly face of Charles Arnold, and who were acquainted with his for- mer life. said, "He alone is worthy to be the husband of the beautiful Ella ;" and the fond parents thought so too-and though they gave her away with tears, they felt he was worthy to be entrusted with their treasure. Such was the father and mother of our little Minnie, when they. stood before the altar, and plighted the marriage vow which was registered in Heaven. But how had that vow been kept? We shall see. Soon after their marriage, Ella was called upon to witness the departure of that dear mother, who had /     <pb n="108-109" xml:id="VAC6530-00000060"/> 108        MNNIE, watched over her with such sedulous care. It was a hard blow; but she endured it as only the christian can bear up, under such overwhelming trials. Not many months after, her father followed I A fever, that proved fatal to many, deprived her of her last earthly parent. Poor Ella!-the death of her father and mother had come upon her so suddenly and un- expected, that she would have sunk under it. had it not been for the untiring love and sympathy of her husband; and she blessed God, that he had bestowed such a priceless blessing upon her. And, at that time, he was worthy of her love. He possessed that intuitive sense of the beautiful-that ready sympathy, which is rarely to be found in man-united to a childlike submission to the will of his heavenly Father, that you sometimes look in vain for, in the older and more advanced christian. Charles Arnold was sincerity it- self. But it was fashionable, among the higher circles, to have wine on their tables, and handed round when callers came. He had early imbibed a taste for it, and was in the daily habit of drinking it; but never, for one moment, did he think that he should become the slave of that habit. He was a promising lawyer; but, as there were many of that profession, in his na- tive city, he thought it best for them to remove to the beautiful town of N. Ella bade farewell to the- home of her childhood, and accompanied her husband, with a resigned heart. For a few years, all was peace, in their happy dwelling. Little Minnie came, to gladden their hearts with her winning smiles; and, three years after, the little, prattling Charlie. But a change, (almost imperceptible, at first,) by degrees   A TEMPERANCE TALE.        109 took place. Ella often perceived that her husband's face was flushed, and his eyes were unusually bright; but she laid it to over-exertion and excitement in his business. Very soon, however, it became too appa- rent, and she could hide the horrid truth from her heart no longer. I need not describe the agony of that moment; it was far, far worse than death. Step by step, he trode the downward path, and his fine mind each day became more obtuse. For a time, he was invariably kind to his gentle wife and winning children;-but what will the accursed alcohol not, change? They had lived a very retired life, as ill health had been her portion, for the last few years;. and now, in her utter desolation, she had none to look to, unless she could look for comfort in her little Min- nie, whose discerning eye had detected the change,. and could bear it no longer; and the conversation, ensued, with which our story commenced. Passing' over a few years, in which his business was, at first,. neglected, and finally given up entirely; their prop- erty was all gone, and extreme poverty had come upon them. Many a sleepless night, poor Ella passed in watching and waiting for her now wretched hus- band. Once in a while, le would revive a little, and' would seem to have still the milk of human kindness, in his heart. At such times, he would say, "Oh, Ella!. if I could once go where rum was not, your husband would yet be restored to you; but I have lost all power over myself!"Then she formed the resolu- tion of going to all the rumsellers, to implore them to, save her husband. She who had been so tenderly nurtured, was alone; with no servant; destitute of the, 10    <pb n="110-111" xml:id="VAC6530-00000061"/> "O        MNXNI E, bare necessaries of life, and in feeble health; for her continued watching had worn down a frame naturally delicate, to a mere shadow;-but what will not woman endure and suffer, for the husband of her youth? - Be- hold her, then, wending her steps to the grog-shops! It was of no use-she might as well have appealed to the stones. Time rolled on, but brought no change to the sufferers: starvation often stared them in the face. The mother did all she could, and Minnie as- sisted. She had sent them to school, for she did not feel adequate to the task of teaching them; but the finger of scorn was continually pointed at them, even by the rumseller's sons and daughlters-they, who lived in their splendid houses, that had been built -with the groans and tears of the suffering thousands: and the mother could not bear that they should suffer this, when they had so much to endure at home; and she withdrew them from school. All the while, the heart of Minnie was almost bursting with suppressed emotion. She had endured the harsh treatment of her father, oh! how many times; and, although she felt a deathly sickness creep over her, and she trem- bled like an aspen, when she heard his step approach, still, she thought she could suffer all- every thing- rather than see her angel mother and her darling brother, the objects-of his hatred. At such times, she would almost lose her reason, and she would exclaim' constantly, "What can I -do? Oh! my Father in Heaven, what can I do for my suffering mother? Oh, show me some way to aid her!" One night, after one of these bitter conflicts, she threw her little weary body on the pallet of straw-   A TEMPERANCE TALE.       1" striving to think how she could crush the hydra-head- ed mnonster. She fell asleep, and dreamed that God had given her power to destroy every drop of spirit- uous liquor that was in the world-and it covered a space much farther than the eye could reach. And a lighted torch was handed her; and, as she touched it, the flames reached to heaven! Then she clapped her hands, and shouted for joy; and she called aloud, (and her voice floated all over the earth,)-Come, suffering mothers, and broken-hearted wives; come, despond- ing sisters, and despised children; come, and see the great coniflagcration. The monster is crushed; not another drop can be on this earth, whilst God reigns in Heaven! And they came, with their pale faces and sunken eyes, and experienced a joy they had not known for years. Suddenly, her ear was arrested by the most unaccountable sounds; they were like the wail- ing(rs of the damned. She turned, astonished; for at that moment, she thought there was not a heart in the world, but was bounding for joy. There was a multitude of grim-visaged beings; and, to her eager inquiries, of who they were, it was shouted, on all sides,-"They are the rumsellers; their day is up. Woe! woe I to the defeated rumsellers." Then Minnie awoke, and found it all a dream. "Oh! (said she,) if this had been true, to what a different world should I have opened Iny eyes this morning!"-and tears fell fast on her pillow. But she thought the dream had a meaning. She believed that her earnest and oft-re- peated inquiries of what she should do, had, at length, been answered, and that henceforth it was her duty to destroy all that it was in her power to get at. She    <pb n="112-113" xml:id="VAC6530-00000062"/> "2        MNNIE, never mentioned the subject to her mother; for she thought she would not see it in the same light that she herself did; but her resolution was taken. Ah! Minnie, herein was thy great mistake. Thou shouldst have consulted with that wise and good mother; and, surely, one who had ever been so dutiful and obedient, would have listened to her counsels. She would have taught thee that it is far nobler to endure affliction, than to do " evil" that good may come. It was an error of the head, not of the heart. Enthusiastic she was, to a degree that separated her from the children around her; and she had witnessed nothing but suffer- ing, from a child; but revenge could not, for a moment, find a resting place in the heart of one so tremblingly alive to the sufferings of others. Physical prostration, and intense mental excitement, had produced a sort of monomania on this subject; and it would have been impossible, perhaps, to have convinced her that it was not the finger of God, that had pointed out her duty; and it was this view of it, that gave that naturally timid girl, strength to perform that, which would have caused many a stout-hearted man to trem- ble. She was well acquainted with many places in the town, where it was kept; for, as she traversed it often, in search of fuel, to keep them from freezing, the fumes of the liquor she could trace for miles. One place, in, particular, she remembered. It was a long, red building, standing on a wharf; and she knew that it was filled with the deadly poison. She had several times been in it herself, when she saw children going in and out; and she was drawn thither, she knew not why. Once, when they had been repairing it, she   A TEMPERANCE TALE.        113 ventured in, and asked permission to gather the chips that were lying around. She looked at the barrels, and thought, if it had not been for rum, our home would have been as happy as we could have wished. My father would have been beloved and respected. I should have honored him, and looked up to him. He would have provided us with fuel, and I should not have been here; my poor mother would-," but her heart was too full, when she thought of her, and she hastened out of the building. It was owned by the wealthy Mr. N-  , the wealthiest merchant in the town. She knew that he sold it to the rumsellers, and they dealt it out to her father and to thousands of poor wretches beside. "This," said she, " shall be the place where I will commence. It is alone; io dwelling is near; no one can be injured by the flames." At night, when her mother slept, for a while. that young girl crept from her bed; wrapped a shawl hastily around her, and, with the materials in her hand, stole forth. Her heart beat fast; but, at the same time, she was conscious that she was stronger than she had ever been before. She reached the spot; drew out the shavings, and placed them where she thought they would do best; then applied the match. She never looked behind till she reached the street that led to the room where her mother and brothers were sleeping. Then she turned, and saw the flames rising; and it seemed to her that her dream was about to be realized. Just before she reached her home, the cry of ; Fire!" fell on her ear. She ran faster; gained the door; glided in, and lay down on her bed. Her mother was asleep, but soon roused. 9*    <pb n="114-115" xml:id="VAC6530-00000063"/> "4        M I N N IE, Springing up, she exclaimed," It is fire! where are you, my children?"Minnie answered, as calmly as she would have done at any other time, "We are here, dear mother. Do not be alarmed; we have nothing to fear." In the morning, there was not a trace of the building to be seen, save the blackened mass of burnt timber that was strewn over the ground. It was effectual. Every drop of the fire-water was consumed. Several times, Minnie succeeded in carrying out her work of destruction; but she was, at last, detected! They rushed in, and tore her from her mother, who lay stretched upon a bed of sickness, and left her, as one dead. Charlie-a noble-hearted boy, who had now reached his thirteenth year-was distracted. He wanted to follow his sister, but could not think of leaving his apparently dying mother. He looked at her pale face, as she lay there in a swoon, unconscious of what was going on around, and, kissing her fore- head, said, "Oh! my injured mother thou hast ever preached forgiveness; but if they ill-treat my sister, it shall no longer be peace, but a sword." It was near night when they took Minnie from her home, and conveyed her to prison. They thrust her into a narrow cell, and turned the key upon her. But she trembled not; she shed no tears. At that moment Ahe felt that she could suffer even death itself. She 'was unconscious that it was dark around. At length she .thought of her mother, and the flood-gates of her heart were opened, and tears rushed to her eyes. She dropped on her knees, and implored the Father of mercies to watch over that mother. "Oh! my God, (she said) thou wert near me in my dream; thou   A TEMPERANCE TALE.        115 not forsake me now. Whatever punishment they may see fit to inflict, may I bear it cheerfully-but they will not separate me from my mother; Oh, Father, they will not do that!" and the poor girl wept and prayed till morning. Then she fell into a troubled sleep, but was awakened by the sound of whispering voices, and the gentle pressure of a kindly hand rested upon her., She thought this, too, was a dream,-a dream that would be dispelled as the other blessed vision had, all too soon, vanished; but she was mistaken. They were friends, who had heard her strange story, and had wept and pondered over it, and had resolved to do all that lay in their power, to bind up the bruised reed, and make her prison life comfortable. They had read the heart of Minnie, and therefore had min- istered to the wants of the sick and suffering family, first. These were the glad tidings that greeted Min- nie on awakening. Her mother had been tenderly cared for; they had searched and found her wretched father; and the heart of Charhe had been comforted by the assurance that no harm should come to his dear sister, other than the separation that must ne- cessarily continue for some time longer. Thus days, weeks, and months wore away, and found our Minnie still a convict in the prisoner's cell. But new friends were daily added, and she bore up bravely under all the crushing thoughts and feelings that oppressed her delicate and sensitive spirit. The family had been removed to a neat and comfortable cottage, and a good and efficient nurse had been procured to take care of them. A long and protracted fever, brought on by exposure, had completely prostrated her father,    <pb n="116-117" xml:id="VAC6530-00000064"/> "6        MNNIE1,  and brought him to the verge of the grave. Her mother was unable to leave her bed. The constant anxiety and yearning desires of her heart, retarded that progress toward health, she so earnestly coveted. so that she might once more look upon her darling;  yet for that dear one's sake, she struggled hard   E to be patient. Each day their wants were abund-     antly supplied; and that blessed sympathy which gold cannot buy, was now hers, an ever present angel in their house of mourning. At length, the day of trial came, and Minnie was led out to face the multitude. The house was crowded, for it had created a great sensation throughout the neighboring towns, and they ! all thronged to see one who had dared so much. It was buzzed on all sides that it was the daughter of a drunkard, but they were astonished when they beheld Minnie. She was just turned of fifteen; rather tall, but slender; nay, almost fragile in form. There was the noble dignity of mien, that had characterized her father, united with the exquisite grace and gentle- ness of the once beautiful Ella. Her hair was glossy, and of a rich brown color; her face was pale, but the features beautifully moulded; the mouth small, and the sweet expression of that mouth was never for- gotten by those who had once seen her smile; the eyes were hazel, but there was a world of pity and be- seeching tenderness in those soft, dark, liquid orbs, and a high, holy expression, that awed the beholder. No unbeliever in a future state, could look into the depths of those eyes, and not feel that there was a Heaven, and thither the poor, forsaken child of scorn was bound. The witnesses were examined; Minnie's   A TEMPERASNCE TALE.       117 counsel plead long and ably; he forgot all but the wrongs that had maddened and driven to the verge of insanity that delicate, tender hearted little being before him. He portrayed the agony that must have wrung the heart of one so constituted. He plead for her as he would have pleaded for his own sister; for he was young, and his heart had not yet become bard- ened by contact with the selfishness that is in the world. He spoke of her extreme youth; of her doubts and fears; of the intensity of her emotions; of the delicate heart-chords that vibrated to every wail of sorrow. He pictured the all absorbing thought that took full possession of her mind after her dream,- that it was a duty she was called upon to perform; that she could not turn aside from it, from the fear of consequences, without trampling upon the highest and holiest dictates of her spiritual nature. She knew that God had forbidden us to put the cup to our neighbor's lips; that we are commanded to feed the hungry, and clothe the naked; but they had been stripped of all they possessed in the world. Her broken hearted mother was constantly before her; and she remembered a time when that mother went forth a suppliant, imploring those men not to give her hus- band that, which would deprive him of his reason. She had asked the question,-what right had they to turn the morning of her mother's days into one long, dark, cheerless night? What right had they to reduce her and her little brother to beggary, and after they had covered them with rags, let their children point the finger of scorn at them? Then he drew a comparison between the sin of the dealers in the rum traffic, and    <pb n="118-119" xml:id="VAC6530-00000065"/> "8        MNNIE, those who were considered by law, criminals. All these things, said he, have they done, but they are re- spected; the law cannot touch them; nay, it is on their side; but if a half starved wretch takes but elough to satisfy his hunger, you straightway condemn him to imprisonment. If the angry, but kind hearted man, who would scorn to deprive children of their bread, commits a deed, in an unguarded moment, that his very soul abhors, and he would give worlds to undo; you condemn him to death, and think you have done a Christian deed. Oh! he exclaimed, how much rath- er would I clasp the hand of such a man, dripping with blood, though it be, than come in contact with his, who deals out death every hour; death not only to the body but the soul, and feels no compunction I Throughout the whole of this speech, Minnie's eyes were riveted upon the speaker, with that intense and fixed gaze that showed the spirit, for the time being, had entirely lost sight off its earthly surroundings. Then the counsel for the state arose with the inten- tion of overthrowing all that had been said; but it was not an easy task, in this instance, for he, too, was young, and he had felt the trx]uth of all the preceding re- marks; but it was his profession. He had to look away from Minnie, and endeavored to take a practical view of the matter. He showed how absurd a thing it would be, for reasonable people to be beguiled by dreams and visions; that if an exceptio n was made in her case, the country would be flooded with similar cases; that our lunatic asylums would be crowded by persons fancying they had certain missions to per- form, that had been divinely communicated. But this   A TEMP ERANCE TALE.       19 part is too sad to dwell upon. Suffice it to say, that Minnie was found guilty, and sentenced to three years impri!sonment. Before the judge had pronounced her doom, she was asked if she had any thing to say why sentence should not be passed upon her, and was comrn. manded to rise. As she did so, a murmur ran through that crowded audience; the sympathies of all were excited in her behalf, except a few of the most har- dened and selfish. It was with difficulty she could stand; for she had barely tasted food the day before, and the bitter night of suffering had almost deprived her of strength. She supported herself by leaning on the railing which hems the prisoner in; then she raised her eyes and gazed on the multitude. She wondered if there was one in the wide world, so desolate, so ut- terly forsaken as herself. Where was the father who should have been near, if danger had assailed her? There was a breathless pause; the heads of all were bent toward, and the hearts of the sympathizing beat fast. It was 'evident she was suffering much. She gasped for breath. Some one near, put a glass of water to her lips; she made one or two efforts more to speak; then, raising her head, and pointing to her counsel. said, in a low, but distinct voice, "That gentleman has spoken truly, he has read my heart aright; I was un- conscious of crime, I did it for poor humanity's sake. It did not seem to be myself, but a power superior, that controled and guided my spirit. If I have sinned and trampled upon the laws of God and the land, then ought I to suffer the penalty. I will throw myself upon God's mercy, which is never withheld from his erringl and repentant children; but from the experience of my    <pb n="120-121" xml:id="VAC6530-00000066"/> 120        MNNIE, short and sorrowful life, it would seem worse than use- less to hope for any mercy from man." The last words were scarcely audible, and she sank down exhausted. As the officers approached Minnie, for the purpose of conveying her back to prison, there was a murmur of dissatisfaction among the crowd, Land several sprang forward. In the tumult of strange noises, the terrified girl knew not where to look for help; but a kindly arm was thrown around her, and she was drawn out of the crowd. She had fainted, and many ladies sobbed aloud when they saw that pale, beautiful face borne along in the arms of the gray-headed gentleman; and hard visaged men brushed the tears from their cheeks. When Minnie opened her eyes, her head rested on the shoulder of the kind old man. He spoke in soothing tones and said, "Fear nothing, my poor child, I am go- ing to be thy father." "' Father, (said Minnie) I have no father." "I know it, but I will be thy father." "Where is my mother? my poor mother!-oh! take me to her." He assured her that pleasure should soon be hers; that they would use every means in their pow- er to have her sentence repealed. At that moment the carriage stopped, and Minnie was once more an in- mate of the prisoner's cell. The old gentleman was the wealthy Mr. N., whose property Minnie had first destroyed. He had been in- terested in the case, and had often assisted the family without their knowing from whence the aid came; but not until he looked upon Minnie, did the whole extent of their misery rise up before him. He visited her daily, and wa s engaged heart and soul in her cause. In the mean time, great changes were going on around   A TEMPERANCE TALE.       121 them; the most influential men of the place rose in a 'body, and declared it was time to do something in the cause of Temperance. The people of N. had been notorious for holding out against all reforms, and they had heretofore laugh- ed at temperance pledges and tetotallers; but now they said,-we will have a " pledge,"-and they wrote one, and hundreds signed their names to that pledge- Mr. N. leading the way. Such a tremendous excite- ment was never known in the town of N. before. Some of thile rum sellers even brought out their casks and turn- ed the liquor into the streets. Many remembered the fine looking lawyer when he first came among them, and they said; " if he could fall, there is no safety for any one." Again it seemed as if Minnie's dream was, about to be realized. But to return to that suffering one. From the mo- ment she entered the cell, though surrounded by weep- ing and kind-hearted beings, an apathy gradually stole. over her, and in a few hours she seemed unconscious. ,of the presence of any one. By night, the delirium of fever had fastened itself upon her prostrated frame ;: and her unconscious cries for her mother, for release from bondage, for rest and freedom from pain, were heart-rending to hear. Her mother had to be ap- prized of her condition, and Mr. N. set out to per- form that painful duty; and painful, it was, indeed, to, him. The kind hearted old man wept like a child.. On that bed, lay one worthy to grace a court; for the- true nobility of the soul will shine forth, let the out-. ward surroundings be what they may. There was no, alternative; the mother must go to her child, even if' "    <pb n="122-123" xml:id="VAC6530-00000067"/> 122        MNNIE, leath should be the result. We must pass over that neeting. It was well, perhaps, that one was uncon- ;cious. o Hours, days, and weeks passed, and the fe- ,er still raged. It was on the brain, and Minnie's life hung by a slender thread. Those long nights of bit- ter agony.-who can describe them? When the spirit is swayed to and fro, now on the verge of precipices with no power to retreat; now poised on loose frag- ments, high, high up, with no arm to snatch us from falling, and we sink down, down, our cries for help lost in the fathomless depth below; then the hor- rible sense of suffocation, when we struggle to free ourselves,; to cry for aid; with the faculty of percep- tion, intensified tenfold! Oh! ye fathers, who tarry long at the wine cup, bringing disgrace and sorrow, not only to your own souls, but to the tender, hap- less beings whose lives ye have invoked, come, look upon this picture! It is only one of a thousand, but it is a faithful transcript. We will not linger. Suffice it to say, that the time came, when the magnetism of the mother's touch, was distinguished from all others; when the mother's voice- "had power to quiet The restless pulse of care, And came like the benediction That follows after prayer." The death-angel had passed by, and it was Minnie's destiny, (she who was born with the martyr spirit,) to live; to live, though, Promethian like, chained to a rock, with the vultures gnawing at her vitals,--she, meanwhile, striving to conceal the wounds, smiling sadly upon the loved ones, and speaking gently to   A TEMPERANCE TALE.       123 all. But there was one now often near, who had watched and waited with the anxious mother; one whose presence had become dear to the youthful con- valescent. She listened for the approaching footsteps, while a new world of joy sprung up in her heart, and irradiated that hitherto sad little face; and this new world of love, transfigured every thing around her, causing a halo of peace to rest, even upon the walls of her prison. Arthur P., the young and promising lawyer, who had labored so earnestly in Minnie's cause, had found it impossible to banish from his mind, her form and face. In' the midst of business, sleeping or waking, those tender, pleading eyes were ever before him. For a 'time, he struggled against what some would have deemed a weakness, but his nature was noble, and he was not ashamed to follow the dictates of his higher nature, when thus prompted.

Thus, day after day found him by the side of the mother, tenderly nursing the sick, and watching with intense emotion, every change of that disease, which was to cause new buds of promise to spring up, or to dash those new and heaven inspiring hopes, sud- denly to the earth! But the death-angel passed, as we said before, and Minnie lived and loved! Arthur's had been a thoughtful, reflecting mind, even from his boy- hood ;and he could not but feel, that Minnie was the instrument that God had raised up to strengthen those principles, to enlarge and sanctify those aspirations. Passing over long months of weariness and suspense;    <pb n="124-125" xml:id="VAC6530-00000068"/> 124        MNNIE, of " hope deferred, that maketh the heart sick ;" the friends of Minnie at length succeeded in obtaining her release, and they bore her in triumph to her home. With a chastened heart, she knelt down, and, burying her face in her hands, sobbed out a prayer of gratitude to God, for freedom to roam over the green earth once more, and to be ever near the loved ones! Those scenes, and the emotions they produced, were never effaced from her memory. Mr. N. had taken the necessary measures to make Minnie his adopted child, while she was yet a prisoner. He had no chil- dren of his own; and a prouder man was not in the town of N. than he, when he took Minnie by the hand, and imprinted a kiss on her fair young cheek, and called her, daughter. He never forgot the first time her friendless head rested upon his shoulder, when he was bearing her through the streets, all un- conscious on whose bosom she leaned. The presence of Minnie imparted new life and strength to each drooping member of that little family; and she tend- ed, with assiduous care, her now repentant father,- ministering to his wants, day and night. He was re- joiced to know, a change had taken place in the for- tunes of his gentle wife and dear children; but remorse was like a vulture at his heart, and he could not bo happy. It was hard, very hard for him to rise above his besetting sin; but his guardian angel was always near, even at midnight, to strengthen and encourage; and he would say, You see, dear Minnie, what a slave I am, even with the fear of God before my eyes."7 He was desirous to put his name to the pledge,   A TEMPERANCE TALE.        125 and did so. He shed tears of sorrow and re- pentance; and said, that if it was the will of God that he should remain in this world, still longer, he felt that he should lead a different life; but he could not retrieve the past! It was evident, however, that his hours were numbered. He lingered for a few months after Minnie's release; and then, Ella closed the eyes of her once idolized husband. Bitter tears she shed over him; for she remembered all that he had been to her in her youthful days. She thought of his sym- pathy and untiring love, when she was bereft of her parents; and of his tenderness, and. joy, and delight, when their little Minnie was born; and how proud he was of his little Charlie. She dwelt upon his good. ness and kindness to all around, until he became the slave of alcohol. She forgot those long years of suf. feringo; or, if she thought of them, only pitied the poor slave of intemperance, the more. After Ella had looked upon her husband, for the last time, she turned to Minnie, and, clasping her to her heart, said, "My first-born darling! my precious one! thou hast been a blessing to us all. Thou didst err; but God has over- ruled that evil for our good. Little did I think, when I told thee that stern duties were before us, that thou would'st finally triumph so gloriously. I said thou would'st feel nothing but the thorns, but thou wilt be refreshed with the flowers; and surely thou hast rich- ly deserved it!"Charles, the noble minded Charles, was ever an apostle of Temperance. He had suffered so much himself, that he could never forget the suffer- ings of others, particularly the children of intemperate parents. He had a house built, and thither he would "*    <pb n="126-127" xml:id="VAC6530-00000069"/> 126        M INNIE. have all poor, street drunkards carried. There they were fed and clothed, and when the mania came on, stimulants comparatively harmless, were given them instead; and he saved hundreds in this way. Several years have elapsed since Minnie quitted her narrow cell, and the affianced lovers are of one heart and mind. They have striven to make life beautiful and sublime, by doing cheerfully the duty that lies nearest, and by being always active in every good word and work. Theirs was not the mad haste that would lead them to "sacrifice the palm-tree for the temporary draught of wine," as alas, thousands have done and are constantly doing. Arthur had but one purpose and aim in life, and the gentle, but heroic being was ever by his side, as an angel of patience and of hope-of endurance and trust! The long, dark, starless night had vanished, and the morning star shone brightly in the heavens,-its pure, tender light, falling on all around. While the behold- ers were gazing upon it, it gradually disappeared from their view, obscured by the stronger light of the rising sun; for its mission was to usher in that glorious orb whose warmth should fertilize the earth, and whose ;bright beams, were to make glad the hearts of the ,sorrowing ones. Thus, slowly, and noiselessly drops 4he curtain, before the advent of the true marriage of ,Love and Wisdom I   %lmt oro, t   'ictim of lthernge, Reader, will yon allow me to introduce you to that group of young girls who are standing in a summer house, which is covered with vines, with here and there a flower peeping from among the green leaves. They are in the spring time of life,-that joyous season which comes but once, with its bright hopes and boundless expectations; when they open their eyes upon a world that is all beauty, and they are sure you know nothing of life, when you tell them that their dreams and anti- cipations can never be realized. These girls are all pretty, and each has her own peculiar charm; but a stranger would be particularly struck by the face and figure of Alice McLane; and next, you would single out her companion, Julie Gra- ham, as most worthy of observation. Alice was an orphan, and she had drank deep of the cup of sorrow; but you would not have thought it, for her face beamed with smiles of affection, and she was ever ready to speak cheering words of sympathy to all who "faltered by the way." Julie's father had taken her when she    <pb n="128-129" xml:id="VAC6530-00000070"/> 28        ALICE; was a child, into his own family, for she was the daugh- er of his early friend and classmate. The two girls ere as unlike in character as in personal appearance. Alice was winning and gentle; June was imperious and naughty. Alice was fair, with soft, grey, loving eyes, chat expressed every emotion of the soul; very small in person, and every motion betraying a nervous tem- perament. Juhe was dark, with piercing black eyes, and hair of the same color; tall and finely proportioned. She could look any one down, and never lost her self- possession. All who were acquainted with them pitied the little trembling Alice, and thought there could not be much congeniality of thought and feeling between them. That they could not sympathize in each other's pursuits is true. How could they? Juhe had chosen this world, and looked no higher for pleasure and hap- piness; whilst, from a child, Alice had felt that this was not her home. She labored to perform the duties that were imposed upon her, and to make every thing more beautiful by cheerfully doing for others what they could not do for themselves; for she well knew that only as heaven was developed in her heart here, would she be prepared to enjoy the Heaven hereafter. She possessed far more strength, moral courage, and deter- mination of purpose than Julie; no one would have thought it, who looked only at the outward. We will not speak of all that Alice had suffered from the una- miable and tyrannical disposition of Julie. Suffice it to say, that the parents thought their daughter could do nothing wrong; and Alice would turn from the disagreeable, aad strive to find only the good. She was ealled the "'P:eacemaker," by the young girls of   OR THE VICTIM OF REVENGE.      129 the village, and well she merited the name. Even Julie allowed that Alice had patience without end; and she surely should have known, for she taxed it to the utmost. Not that Alice was perfect; for she often found the spirit of resentment rising within, and the warm blood mantling her cheek; but she had only to close her eyes and behold the crucified one gazing upon her, and the bad spirit would vanish like clouds before the sun. Alice took great delight in her village school. The little children would surround her as she entered the school-room, or as they ran out to meet her on her way thither; and she had a kind word and a smile of approval for each little grateful heart. She also visited the sick, and destitute, and ministered to their wants ; and the look of delight with which her presence was welcomed, more than repaid her for the time and strength it required. And then, there was a little pre- cious one at home, too, that she loved with a mother's tenderness. From the moment little Grace had opened her eyes and smiled upon her, Alice felt it a joy to watch its growth, as one watches a tender plant; detect- ing the weeds as they spring up, shielding it from the  chill breezes, and placing it in the warm genial sunshine and each morning anxiously looking for the little buds of promise; and the child returned that loves She ran to Alice, with all her joys and sorrows. About this time, a stranger preached in the village, and Mr. G. invited him home to dine; and he became much pleased with the appearance of the family, but was particularly interested ia the unobtrusive manners  ,    <pb n="130-131" xml:id="VAC6530-00000071"/> 130         ALICE; and soul-lit face of Alice. Each succeeding interview only strengthened his reverence for her character. Frederick A. possessed a mind of no common order; an accomplished scholar, with a pleasing exterior; and, though stern, uncompromising integrity of character was written on his manly face, yet he was not devoid of sympathy. He had been in the ministry some six years, but had never met with one whom he could choose as a companion for life. A year before, he was obliged to resign his pastoral charge on account of ill health. and he was travelling for its recovery; but his strength had returned now, and being well known to some of the members of the church in the village, he was invited to fill their pastor's place, for a few months; he being unable ,to preach. Thus, a way was opened for him to become better acquainted with Alice; and before the time of his engagement had expired, they were betrothed. Alice was only too happy now. She felt that she had found father, mother, brother and sister in her noble-hearted Frederick. The tears would often steal silently down her cheeks, and when he detected it, he would say, "Alice, are you unhappy?" and she would answer, "Oh, no! it is because I am so happy that these tears flow." It was arranged that as soon as he was permanently settled again, their marriage should take place. But where was Julie all this time? She had been a silent, though not unmoved, spectator. She had had offers of marriage, but the gentlemen did not suit her, and she gave them decided refusals. She did not love Frederick; but her vanity was wounded, and she re- solved, be the consequences what they might, that Alice   OR, THE VIOCTIM bOP REVENGE.     i31 McLane should never become the wife of Frederick A. The time had arrived for Frederick to leave the village; but he knew not yet where they should find a home. He intended visiting several places, and they were to correspond during his absence. The evening before he started, he entered the sitting-room where the family were assembled, and Alice scarcely recognised him, he was so pale. In alarm, she was hastening to him to enquire the cause; but to her surprise, instead of welcoming her with a smile, he gave her a look- such a look! the remembrance of it, even, was sti- fling-and then left the room. Alice was completely stunned ;-but what did it mean? She waited till late in the night, thinking he would return and explain all; but she waited in vain-he came not. Then she sought her lonely chamber, and shed such tears as she never shed before. She was not in the habit of tell- ing her sorrows and disappointments to others, ex- pecting sympathy in return; and she retired, this night, without speaking of the subject that had almost de- prived her of her reason. She passed a sleepless night. At daylight, a carriage drove to the door; she lis- tened, raised the sash, saw Frederick enter it and drive away. She had not power to articulate a word- and the opportunity was lost. Had he heard the tones of her voice, and seen that pale, haggard face, he would have desired an explanation; but he thought her guilty and he hurried on. Poor Alice watched the carriage  with straining eye; she felt it was a hopeless case.; there was a pain, as though an arrow had pierced her heart; she tried to call for aid, but no sound came    <pb n="132-133" xml:id="VAC6530-00000072"/> 132         ALICE; from her lips; she struggled as a drowning man strug- gles with the waves, for she was suffocating; then she gave a piercing shriek, and sank sensless on the floor. Juhe was near at hand, for sleep had forsaken her pillow, and, as she heard the poor girl pacing the room with hurried steps, and listenod to the sobs of repres- sed anguish, her heart smote her, and she would have recalled Frederick, but her pride would uot allow her to confess her guilt; but when she saw that pale, life- less one stretched beside her--her face as white as the robe that shrouded her sweet form---oh! what would that guilty girl not have given to have undone the work of the last few hours. Alice had always been so patient, and borne up under suffering with so much calmness, that she thought she could not feel as acutely as others but now she witnessed the depths of feeling that that calmness was the very offspring of, under less trying circumstances, and she realized what it was for a strong nature to love. Alice never raised her head from the pillow, after she was laid on the bed; it seemed that the dreadful shock had deprived her of the power of motion, but her mind was as clear as ever. They did not know which route Frederick had taken; but Julie, uubeknown to Alice, wrote and directed to where she thought he might be, entreaat- ing him to come back to them, for Alice was dying. But no answer was returned. His name had not been mentioned in her presence, and Julie could not gain courage enough to ask her if she knew aught concern- ing his movements. The wretched girl could not bring her mind to confess her guilt; but she thought if Frederick only returned. Alice would live, and then   OR, THE VICTIM OF REVENGE.      133 she could confess all. Little Grace sat beside the bed, the tears coursing each other down her cheeks; she could not understand why dear Alice was sick, and why she did not smile upon her. One day, when Juhe was in the room, Grace said, ," Cousin Alice, did any one hurt you, that you were sick?" Alice thought a moment, and then said, "No, dar- ling, not in the way you mean." "I am glad," little Grace replied, " for I am sure I could never love any one who could hurt you." "Then you are not good, my darling," said Alice; "do you not remember how much Jesus loved those. who were wounding him. Have you forgotten his last; prayer, Grace? Was it not ' Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do.'" "But dear cousin Alice," said the child, "if any one- should wound you, and make you very, very unhappy; you could not surely forgive them? "Then I should not be a disciple of the meek Sb. viour, whom you love to hear so much about. We. must learn to forgive our bitterest enemies, and the greater the injury, the more they stand in need of our pity and forgiveness. I know, my dear little Grace, it is the hardest of Christian injunctions to fulfill, but it must be done, or we are none of His." Julie sat silent throughout the conversation, but every word fell upon her heart, scorching it like coals- of tire. A moment after, she rose from her seat, andy approached the bed; she gazed into the eyes of the in- jured one, and felt it was true-the'meek spirit of for- giveness was there. She dropped on her knees, and 12    <pb n="134-135" xml:id="VAC6530-00000073"/> 134        ALICE; clasping the hand of Alice, said, "Alice, I AM THAT BIT- TER ENEMY!"A spasm passed over the face of the dy- ing girl, and there was a motion as though she would have withdrawn her hand, but she did not. "I do not ask you to forgive me ;" said Julie, " that would only add to the pangs I already endure; but jus- tice demands this confession. Alice, I made him be- lieve you were not worthy of him; that you had de- ceived him; that you-were engaged to another! and, in the phrenzy of the moment, he waited not to examine the truth of the statement, but has gone. But le will return; oh! I know he will return. Live, Alice! do not let me be your murderer!" There was silence for a moment; Julie buried her head in the bed clothes; then Alice said, I forgive you as I hope to be forgiven. You did not know the bit- ter suffering it would cause, or it would not have been done." Every effort was now made to find Frederick; but in vain. Alice sank rapidly: her constitution was nat- urally delicate, and it needed but this last blow to pros- trate it. Just before she breathed her last, she called Julie to her bedside, and said, "I am too weak to write, but if you ever see HM, tell him I loved him next to my Creator. It was too bright to last! God's will be done; and Julie, prepare to meet me in that bet- ter world, where there is no envy and strife, but where all is peace forever more." A few moments after, her pure spirit took its flight, and the friendless one had found a home. Frederick had been as one in a dream; he travelled unconscious of his destination. "If she is false, then   OR, THE VICTIM OF REVENGE.     135 is nothing true in the world," was ever uppermost in his mind. Nearly a week had elapsed before he could reason calmly; he then thought there might be some mistake; then he resolved to seek her, and see if she could justify herself. He arrived at the town of--, and unconsciously stepped into the Post Office. There was a letter for him. He broke the seal hastily, and only read that Alice was dying. He rested neither day nor night, till he arrived at the house; but it was only to look upon the pale, calm face of Alice, as she lay shrouded in the habiliments of the grave. Julie stood beside the coffin, and as Frederick en- tered the room, she raised her head and said, "I mur- dered her. Why did you leave her? You knew she was as pure as an angel in Heaven. I was the foul one. She said, ' Tell him, I loved him next my God,' and she loved you only." Then she shrieked aloud, and they bore her from the room. Frederick was alone with the dead. Bitterly did he upbraid himself; and as he bowed his head over the coffin, and imprinted a kiss on the cold forehead, he said, "Oh! Alice, I wandered over the earth in search of a kindred spirit, and when I had found it, I thrust it rudely from me, at the fift breath of suspicion, instead of holding thee to my heart all the closer, that thou wast belied. I would not call thee back, for well I know this world was not thy home: and surely one who was' so ready to believe aught against one so pure, could not have passed a long life by thy side, without planting many thorns in thy pathway. I am justly punished!" The remains of Alice were laid in the village grave- yard. The children were there, and tears were in    <pb n="136-137" xml:id="VAC6530-00000074"/> 136        ALICE. their eyes, and sorrow in their hearts, for they knew they had lost their best friend. Juhe had a simple slab of pure white marble placed over the grave, and, at her urgent request, these words were cut deep in it-"HERE LIES ALICE MC LANE, THE VICTIM OF RE- VENGE." Years passed, and all who had shrunk from Julie as something impure, now felt that she was a dif- ferent being. She seldom spoke, and none saw her smile; but she went about doing good. The " divine origin" of the gospel, was manifested in her case. Alice had heaped coals of fire on her head, and she be- came the Saviour's friend. Frederick left his native land, but continued to labor in his Master's field, among the heathen. Little Grace was all that Alice could have wished: the good seed, sown by her own hand, had taken root, and bare fruit. The villagers hailed her coming with delight; for they said it seem- ed as though the spirit of Alice came with her. And whenever there was a disturbance among the children, and one little " peace-maker" rose to entreat them to "Love each other," then they who heard it, would say "The gentle, meek spirit of Alice is still amongst us 'and, though dead, she yet speaketh.'"   HENRY. Oh! how glad I shall be when I am a man, Frank, for then I shall be a real soldier and shall not have to make believe I am one, as I do now. Say, Frank, do you not long to be a man, so that you can be a soldier, a real soldier. FRANK. I do long to be a man, but not a soldier. HENRY. Why not? You do not mean to say that you would be a man and not be dressed in a fine uni- form, and shoulder a gun, and have a sword by your side? Why I would not care to be a man if I did not think I should be a soldier too. It is a foolish notion you have got into your head, cousin Frank. Do all the boys in the country think and feel as you do, on this subject? If so, I am glad I was not brought up there. Come, tell me what objections you can possi- bly have to being a soldier. FRANK. In the first place, I do not believe that God intended we should be soldiers. Henry, do you know what the buisness or trade of a soldier is-- what all this training and drilling is the prelude of? It is to blow out our brother's brains; to butcher *12    <pb n="138-139" xml:id="VAC6530-00000075"/> 138    A DIALOGUE ON PEACE. those who are made in the image of God; to make children orphans; and make happy homes desolate. I know gay uniforms are pleasing to the eye, and mar- tial music thrills the soul. The music is perverted, and all the rest lead to misery and despair. HENRY. I know very well that when men go to war, they have to shoot and slay their enemies, and although it mayr be a hard and disagreeable task, still. it is our duty, for what would become of us if we did not defend ourselves? FRANK. Where do you find that it is our duty to shoot and slay men for the purpose of defending our- selves? HENRY. Where do I find it? Why-why-it has been so ever since the world began. Do we not read, in the Bible, of battles that were fought, and of glo- rious victories won? Ever since I can remember anything, this becoming a soldier has been uppermost in my mind. Yes, when I was a mere baby, my moth- er would make paper soldier-caps and place them on my head; and the mimic gun was put into my hand; and the wooden sword was fastened to my side; and ,when I was all equipped, she would call me her brave little soldier! FRANK. But dont you think her heart would have 'been torn with anguish could she have followed you to the field of battle, and seen the child of her bosom -writhing (in the agonies of death; with not a drop of water to cool his parched lips; with no mother's 'hand to wipe the death damp from. his pallid brow? I know you read in the Old Testament of battles that -were fought; but the- Prince of Peace had not then   A DIALOGUE ON PEACE.       139 been welcomed by the song of the angels, and men were comparatively in the dark. The Saviour's teach- ings are all opposed to war, and the spirit of war.- Did he not say,-"A new commandment give I unto you, that ye love one another." And agaii, "If my kingdom were of this world, then would my servants fight." And, "Ye have heard that it hath been said, an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth; but I say unto you that ye resist not evil; but whosoever shall smite thee on tlge right cheek, turn to him the other also." And does not the apostle James define, clear- ly, the nature and spirit of war, when he says, "From whence come wars and fighting among you? Come they not hence, even of your lusts that war in your members?"And are we not commanded to forgive, as we hope to be forgiven? Oh! yes; the New Testament is full of this glorious doctrine. And our Saviour did not intend that his teaching and preaching should be a beautiful theory, that people would look. at and admire, but would find it impossible to prac- tice. No! when he bowed his meek head upon the cross, and breathed forth that touching prayer, "Fath. er, forgive them, for they know not what. they do," he- well knew that only as they imbibed His spirit, would they be enabled to carry out His sublime precepts. HENRY. But how came you to know so much about these things, cousin Frank? Your father died when you were an infant, and aunt Fanny was sick many years, before her death. FRANK. 'Tis true, my father died when I was too young to feel his loss, and my dear mother was always an invalid; but that did not prevent her from sowing    <pb n="140-141" xml:id="VAC6530-00000076"/> "O    A DIALOG/UE ON PEACE. the seeds of eternal truth and divine love in my heart. For many months before her departure, I used to sit by her bedside, and the lessons I there received can never be effaced from my memory. She taught me that he alone was the true conqueror, who, when he was ill- treated, nobly forgave, and harbored no bitterness in his heart against his short-sighted enemy. "I say unto you, love your enemies, and do good to those who despitefully use and persecute you," stands out in bold relief, and we cannot turn aside from it. HENRY. But d6 you never get angry with your playmates? And do you not like to have your own way? FRANK. Oh yes, often. And then I am so wretched: for I know that I have sinned against.

But I gain strength every effort I make to overcome evil with good, and each day I live, I realize more and more that the divine law of love is omni- potent. HENRY. Well, my mother has always told me never to strike first; but when I am struck, to strike back again, till they get enough of it. FRANK. And in so doing, I suppose you have always got enough, before you got through, have you not? HENRY. Oh yes, but I always feel bad and blame myself more than I do the others; but I thought there was no other way. FRANK.

And whenever you glory in the prospect of becoming a soldier, just ask your own heart how you would like to have those dearest to you in the world, slaughtered, and made the victims of war; and remember that no being is so iso. lated, but that some human heart beats for its weal or its wo; and you will find that real heroism does not consist in mere animal courage, but will learn to rev- erence those who never shed a drop of blood, but who have fought many battles, aye, even the "Battle of Life." Yes; such was Howard, Clarkson, Wilberforce, Wesley, and Elizabeth Fry, and many, many more. They were the truly heroic of their age, and such spir- its are the truly heroic of every age. HENRY. Well, cousin Frank, I do feel that what you say is true, and my boyish dream has lost much of its brightness; but I will strive to be a noble warrior, not- withstanding, and war againt the only enemies we must not love, viz: sin, ignorance, narrowness and in- justice.    <pb n="142-143" xml:id="VAC6530-00000077"/>   POEMS.

While those sweet dream-spells were around me cast, Another sought my love. From the dim past I hastened to the, future-my brow, the while, Crowned with hope's flowers, which drooped, when thy sad smile Fell on my heart; for well I read thy fears, And knew those smiles were forced, to drive back tears! I journeyed on; but, in mine hour of need, My spirit pined for thine; the broken reed  Watched for thy coming, as in days of yore; Feeling thy presence could alone restore * The fleeting courage, for that fearful strife In which Death battles, hand to hand, with Life! And thou wert with me, in each trial hour; Giving new strength to thy frail, drooping flower; While sympathizing tears, like dew would fall Upon my fevered brow-thy smiles recall The faith and hope, that cankering cares well nigh Had shut out from my heart, and veiled my sky! 13    <pb n="146-147" xml:id="VAC6530-00000079"/> "6          P0 EMS. But that sad hour arrived, which had, for years Anticipated, brought fast-flowing tears! Upon my shoulder thy dear head was laid: The youngest of the flock was not afraid To clasp thee close, and watch the fleeting breath, Which brought to us that cold, dread victor, Death I Then, then I clasped the closer; but the fear That thy enfranchised spirit still might hear The bitter wail,-I smothered that wild grief, And prayed that God would give thee sweet relief. A sickening sense of loneliness then fell Upon my heart. It was the last farewell! Since, I have stood beside thy grave, alone, And heard the music of that far-off tone; And felt the kindly pressure of the hand That cooled life's fever, as by breezes fanned; While something soft and shadowy round me stole,  Hallowing the bitter conflicts of the soul. And flowers, too, were there: the purple bloom Of the wild thistle, added to the gloom. It spoke of thorns, that pierced thee every hour, 'Till trickling life-drops formed the purple flower; Yet, tiny, star-like ones bloomed on thy breast, And breathed of triumph-of the spirit's rest. I gathered both; and they have been to me The symbol of the soul's high destiny; The history of thy life is written there- Thy birth, thy marriage, and the wild despair That sometimes bowed thy spirit.

A-little, trembling, fluttering dove, with folded wing and eye, The slightest touch of mortal hand called forth thy feeble cry. Years have flown by; but thou art prized as fondly as of yore; For love, like God, is infinite-a sea without a shore. Then tread life's pathway still, beloved, with Hope's wreath on thy brow; For surely none can seek to harm one good and true as thou. I cannot read thy future, with its untried hopes and fears; But shouldst thou err, or lose thy way, I'll dry thy falling tears; If thou shouldst be a wanderer, and others say, "Depart!" Oh! come to me-for then, as now, thy home is in my heart! Next came the little timid fawn, whose magic glance could wile The hearts of all who gazed upon that rare, unearthly smile; While I, her mother, felt, each hour, that worlds on worlds were mine; And, turning from all outward things, I worshiped at that shrine.    <pb n="148-149" xml:id="VAC6530-00000080"/> "8          POEMS.

Once more I gaze on thee, While Memory's magic wand awakes The slumbering past for me. Long intervening years have flown, And Sorrow's drooping wing Has fanned my brow, yet now my heart Bounds as in childhood's spring. Old Ocean's anthems aye peal forth- Resounding o'er the land- The glad, the bright, the sparkling waves Still break upon the strand.

Yet, not as then, alone-alone- With ocean's endless roar; For fashion's votaries in throngs Now gather on the shore.

"Sure 'tis weak to mourn, Though thorns are at the bosom, or the blasts Of this bleak world beat harshly, if there come Such angel-visitants at even-tide, Or midnight's holy hush, to cleanse away The stains which day hath gathered, and with touch Pure and ethereal, to sublimate The erring spirit."'

At twilight's calm and tranquil hour, She called her children near, And clasped them in her loving arms With trembling hope and fear. But ask that anxious mother, why Her eye rests on her boy, With more of deathless tenderness, With more of fear than joy? She hears a voice you cannot hear; Oft-tiaes it whispers low,- 'Art thou prepared to give him up When God shall deal the blow?' They knew not then, at that same hour An angel near her stood, Questioning that deep and earnest soul To make it strong and good. And when death laid her darling low, They said that she was calm, And wondered why that sudden shock Had not caused wild alarm.

Thou hast pined for that loved voice That made thy young heart rejoice; Thou hast lost the magic spell That could all thy passions quell; Fanning with hope's wing thy brow, That with clouds is shadowed now.

ECHOES. "The spirit is sometimes veiled in shadows, and there are times when the heart is sad and the soul is dark;-seasons, when the light that shines in the inner sanctuary, burns but dimly. We almost fancy that weeping angels are our ministering Spirits, and a strange influence is around us, like an atmosphere of sighs. Then, to us, the earth and all but heaven, is changed. But the hour of gloom, when the unquiet spirit feels that its pinions are heavy with earthly vapors, is consecrated to a holy use. The light of earth is withdrawn, that the soul may seek companionship with the invisible. Long had ignorance sought the kingdom of light and the home of the angels far away; but Heaven's great Messenger of peace on earth, revealed the kingdom that is within. Sit thou by the gateway of that heaven, and bright beings shall come and go, and be thy com- panions. When no wind of passion moves the mental deep, and the soul is calm as an unruffled sea, the stars are disticntly mirrored in its still depths. Oh! let the current of thy inner life be smooth and peaceful, and the angels shall see themselves in thee." SHEKINAH.

Earth has one angel less for me to greet, When worn and weary, with life's care and pain; For oh! .thy words, peace-fraught, have fallen sweet, And cooled the fever of this throbbing brain: For well I knew, that, were the power thine, Thou 'd weave bright rainbows from these tears of mine. Darling, 'tis hard to know' I never more Shall sit beside thee, clasping that dear hand; That our high communings on earth are o'er, For we. have spoken of the better land- Of the soul's destiny, of future rest. Now, all is clear to thee; thou 'rt with the blest. Gone-yet thou still art near! we 'll commune oft, For faith's own prayer can open worlds of light; Thy angel footsteps, falling low and soft, Shall make the midnight darkness noonday bright.

My boy,. my only boy! on this bright morn I wake, to gaze once more on thy fair brow, Where thought, beyond thy years, sits throned, e'en now, An earnest of the future, still unborn.

Of sadness and of joy, of home and hearth! Will not thy spirit aid me then to raise The trembling pinion of my hope from earth?" MRS. HEMANS. 'Tis long since we have met, but thou art near! When worn with cares, thy beaming eyes I see! When faith's calm light is hidden, then I hear Thy low, sweet voice, breathing these words to me- "Be of good cheer, though all is dark around ;"- And, absent, thus to thine my soul is bound; The incense of thy prayer, falls on mine ear. Apart, yet not forgotten!-no, oh no! Though time and distance intervene, the more I turn to thee, as to one loved of yore; And thus, dear Lucy, wheresoe'er I go, Thy image journey's still-we cannot part!
