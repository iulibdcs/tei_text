THE&#xD;
DESERTER'S DAUGHTER.&#xD;
CHAPTER I.&#xD;
« This has been a day of events to me and I shall not&#xD;
soon forget it."&#xD;
Thus spoke. Captain Forrester, alighting from his horse&#xD;
in front of his tent, and addressing his first.Lieutenant,&#xD;
who, in company with several of the men, were seated&#xD;
around a camp fire passingoff the evening in jovial con-&#xD;
versation.&#xD;
" Any thing new on the picket lines, Captain," asked&#xD;
the Lieutenant anxiously.&#xD;
"No excitement there, I believe but"-&#xD;
'.'Why then will you remember to-day so especially ?&#xD;
Another adventure I guess ?"&#xD;
"No not an adventure ; but an escape."&#xD;
"From the widow's bewitching eyes," answered the&#xD;
r Lieutenant jestingly. .&#xD;
".Don't be jealous, Lieutenant," said the Captain fore.&#xD;
ing a smile.&#xD;
But the want of life evinced by Capt. Forrester, in thus&#xD;
turning what he knew to be a. very important matter into&#xD;
a joke, was instantly made quite evident to. Lieutenant&#xD;
Hart.&#xD;
"Have a non-commissioned officer and twelve men de..&#xD;
tailed immediately, Lieutenant, aid order them to am-&#xD;
bush tkemselres at the secondmile post beyond the vidette&#xD;
at the fork of the road. There they will find a blind foot&#xD;
path leading off to the right exactly at the Wle-.post That&#xD;

&#xD;
path I desire to have strictly watched. Instruct them to&#xD;
keep well concealed to'arrest every one that endeavors to&#xD;
pass and bring them to me, and to continue there until&#xD;
further orders." Finishing these instr.uctiQns he turned&#xD;
away and ordered his cook . to " prepare dinner in five&#xD;
minutes."&#xD;
"The Qaptain's excited," said one of the men at the&#xD;
fire. '&#xD;
" There's something wrong as sure as twice one make&#xD;
four," answered Charlie M.&#xD;
This lapsus lingua, or the wrong answer to the, wrong&#xD;
". sum, caused, a general outburst of laughter, and Charlie&#xD;
in ridicule was ordered'by all present, to go imnniiediately&#xD;
and call on the widow that she might teach him mathe-&#xD;
datics.&#xD;
"-Hur:y off the cletail, Lieutenant," ordered the Cap-&#xD;
tain as he seated himself at his mess-chest to eat his has-&#xD;
tily prepared meal.&#xD;
"Saddle up !" s outed the non-coinnissioned officer,&#xD;
and in a few minutes the detail was making its way to&#xD;
the place designated.&#xD;
It was now growing dark and the sombre clouds boiling&#xD;
up from the noi'theast and spreading over the horizen&#xD;
gave ominous signs of a snow storm, while' a boisterous&#xD;
wind shrieked and howled amid the towering forest pine&#xD;
tops. The camp-fires of Captain Forrester's squadTon&#xD;
blazing brightly, and the men that were not immediately&#xD;
on duty were quietly seated around them, waiting for&#xD;
their "turns" to go.&#xD;
At headquarters things were exceedingly quiet.' Alone&#xD;
Capt. Forrester ind Lieutenant Hart might be seen by&#xD;
the light of their fires seated in dreamy silence-the Lieu-&#xD;
- '    tenant in wonder, while the Captain was evidently en-&#xD;
gaged in deep thought ; and from the oftei voluntary&#xD;
contracting of his' dark brow the path of duty'over which&#xD;
these thoughts were then meandering were beset with&#xD;
&#xD;
many unpleasant obstacles. But 'at last, as though to&#xD;
break the suspense that he knew must be passing through&#xD;
the 'Lieutenant's mind, he said, "to-day, Lieutenant., I&#xD;
have ome in possession of positive information that there&#xD;
is in our -midst a secret league, composed of our own fel-&#xD;
low-citizens, (but I am glad to say that the league is&#xD;
small) whose avowed intention it is to thwart our designs,&#xD;
who have a regular means of communication that conveys&#xD;
information to the enemy with the greatest dispatch, whio&#xD;
carry on a nefarious contraband traffic, 'and who are en-&#xD;
deavoring to induce our fellow soldiers to desert their&#xD;
country's flag. If this .disaffection is not crushed in its&#xD;
infancy it bids fair to weaken, if not destroy, the cause in&#xD;
North Carolina. This is perfectly reliable information,&#xD;
from a responsible source ; but, 'by the wxay, came near&#xD;
costing me my life to-day ;" and opening the breast of&#xD;
his coat he displayed the trace of'a rifle' bullet that just&#xD;
missed his body at the heigth of his heart.&#xD;
"This, too, was the work of what was once a lady&#xD;
but '-hesitating he buried his forehead in his hands.&#xD;
"Is it possible !" asked the Lieutenant in surprise.&#xD;
"But before to-inorrows's sun Heaven may favor us&#xD;
with some cue to this dark plot, and if so I shall go im-&#xD;
mediately to work heart and. hand to bring those black&#xD;
hearted villians to summary justice, and rid our mother&#xD;
State of the stigma that their conduct is already bringing&#xD;
upon her fair name."&#xD;
" You will need assistance, Captain, in this matter,&#xD;
and remember that I am anxious t' be your abettor."&#xD;
"Yes, I am aware that it will be a hazardous under-&#xD;
taking, and to be successful will require nerve, energy&#xD;
and perseverance' I know of no one on whom I can more&#xD;
confidently rely than yourself in this matter, and I shallr&#xD;
expect your assistance." Rising from his seat he extend-&#xD;
ed his hand to the Lieuten'ant, who grasping it said,&#xD;
w      ' I&#xD;

<pb  n="6-7" xml:id="VAC6713-00000004"/>&#xD;
"Here I suppose, Captain Forrester, we mutualy resolve&#xD;
to succeed or perish."&#xD;
"That's the determination," was the response.&#xD;
&#xD;
*HAPTER II.&#xD;
"Nothing has been heard from. the detail I suppose,&#xD;
Lieutenant?'.' asked the Captain early on The next morn-&#xD;
ing.                                         4&#xD;
" Nothing except what has just been brought in by the&#xD;
relieved picl~ts.. They report that firing was heard be-&#xD;
low about day-break."&#xD;
"Order a man to saddle his horse and report to me,"&#xD;
said the Captain. "But hold," I see a man riding in.&#xD;
camp now.&#xD;
"It's one of the detail," answered the Lieutenant9&#xD;
"and, strange to say, 'he has a little girl on the horse&#xD;
with him."&#xD;
"A little girl! ha, thus Heaven has crowned this enter-&#xD;
prise with success.&#xD;
Captain Forrester, followed by Lieutenant Hart, walked&#xD;
in the tent as the horseman rode up in front.&#xD;
"Captain," said he, lifting the little girl from his&#xD;
horse, "I have come to bring this little girl whom we&#xD;
caught this morning, acompanied by some one, endeav-&#xD;
&#xD;
7&#xD;
&#xD;
oring to pass through our ambuscade. Her escort made&#xD;
his escape, after we had fired on him several times. She&#xD;
will give us no information."&#xD;
"Come here tome," said the Captain, putting on an&#xD;
austere frown and addressing the little miss who had as-&#xD;
sumed a look of perfect resignation. This abrupt order&#xD;
caused a little agitation, however, in her features, but,&#xD;
placing the nail of her left fore finger between her teeth,&#xD;
she promptly obeyed the order as the Captain turned&#xD;
away to complete his toilet, which he had not quite fin-&#xD;
ished.&#xD;
"Take a seat on the bed here, sissy. Ain't you cold ?"&#xD;
asked the Lieutenant.&#xD;
"No sir !" answered a low voice.&#xD;
The Captain, somewhat attracted by the soft musical&#xD;
voice, turned his eyes upon the beautiful- features of the&#xD;
blue-eyed neat little maiden and asked,&#xD;
"Whose little girl are you?"&#xD;
She hesitated in perplexity.&#xD;
"I am nobody's little girl."&#xD;
"What is your name&#xD;
"Lula.&#xD;
"Lula-what else ?" asked the Captain.&#xD;
"Nothing else ?"&#xD;
"What is your father's name ?"&#xD;
She refused to answer.&#xD;
"Where is your home?"&#xD;
"I hav'nt got any home."&#xD;
"Where is your mother ?"&#xD;
"I have no mother now," she answered3 while the&#xD;
tears chased each other down her plump cheeks.&#xD;
"You are a singular little being," said the Captain..-&#xD;
"You belong to nobody. You have no home nor mother&#xD;
and named nothing but Lula."&#xD;
"Where is your father?. Come, you must answer rae.'&#xD;
eI don't know sir.'&#xD;

"tHave you no brothers and sisters ?"&#xD;
"Yes sir, I have two brothers and one sister. '&#xD;
"Where are they ?"&#xD;
"I don't Jno.w sir."&#xD;
"A4nd what's your sister's name&#xD;
"Julia."&#xD;
"Nothing but Julia of course," said the Captain iron-&#xD;
ically.&#xD;
"Is she grown?"&#xD;
"Yes sir."'.&#xD;
"What is your age?"&#xD;
"Ten," she answered.&#xD;
"Ten," said the Captain.&#xD;
"You know a great deal more than you have told."-&#xD;
He made a feint as though to draw this sabre from its&#xD;
scabbard, hoping thereby to intimidate her. She caught&#xD;
the movemeint, and, throwing herself into Lieutenant&#xD;
Hart's arms, she shrieked, "oh, Lieutenant, don't let'&#xD;
him kill me." "&#xD;
" He will not hurt you if you will tell us why you were&#xD;
passing our men this morning, and who was with you.",&#xD;
"I was sent," she said, "and couldn't help it. Oh !&#xD;
if you please don't makeine tell any more."&#xD;
"Don't be rash-with her, Captain."-*&#xD;
"She must be sent to the General," said the Captain,&#xD;
"I'll swear, by Eternoal Heaven, to wreak vengeance&#xD;
upon the heads of those villians yet." -&#xD;
Captain Forrester was a young Confederate officer of&#xD;
much promise   No one yaw him but to love him. His&#xD;
manly form, his frank, open countenance, his fierce black&#xD;
eyes, his generous heart, and inflexible determinatioU won&#xD;
the admiration even of his enemies. ''&#xD;
An enemy to him, however, was an enemy, and he hated&#xD;
him with all the bitterness and venom that the depths of&#xD;
his soul could foster, while he loved his friends with' that&#xD;
interesting .devotion that ever characterises the faithful&#xD;
&#xD;
"&#xD;
i&#xD;
&#xD;
heart. The cause of his country was dearer to him thai&#xD;
even life itself; and hae respected no one that did not&#xD;
cherish a. like devotion.                         .&#xD;
When Captain Forrester was convinced thata plan was&#xD;
really set on foot in his native state to break down the&#xD;
eause in which he himself was. struggling, and in which&#xD;
he had seen so many of his comrades and even a cherish-&#xD;
ed brother sacrifice,-their .lives, it aroused every nerve in&#xD;
his form to energy. Then the rews through )ris picket&#xD;
lines to the enemy awakened him to a vigilant seuse of&#xD;
his duty;&#xD;
In Lieutenant Hart he found'a genial companion. One&#xD;
whose motto was ever to do or die, One who loved ad-&#xD;
- venture with a veteran hunter's devotion. One who never&#xD;
shrank from any duty except where his finer sentiments&#xD;
were compromised. Never,'therefore, could the disaffect-&#xD;
. ed mob of North Carolinians havd had two more deter-&#xD;
mined foemen watching them than'these two who before&#xD;
a camp-fire "mutually resolved to crush them or die."&#xD;
"Lieutenant," said he after musing for a few moments,&#xD;
"we are now fairly on the track of those traitorous rene-&#xD;
gades whose headquarters, (if we may honor their den by&#xD;
this appellation,) I have every reason to believe, is-not far&#xD;
distant from this place in the wilds of Dover Swamp.' To&#xD;
detect and defeat them now only requires a little cunning&#xD;
courage and energetic action."&#xD;
"What course ought we now to pursue? or what are&#xD;
your plans ?"&#xD;
"We must first find out their base of operations. This&#xD;
movement must be definitely -understood.; they must be&#xD;
betrayed by strategy, and then we must crush them at&#xD;
orle blow. Of course we cannot commence au open cam-&#xD;
paign against them in their dens in Dover Swamp. So&#xD;
secrecy on our part.willbe the ground work of success."&#xD;
"I am well acquainted with all of this country, Cap-&#xD;
tain, and I offer you my services as a scout."&#xD;

"I suggest, then, that you. take with you three day's&#xD;
cooked rations and set out this evening. I am sure that&#xD;
the foot path at which our gnen are now ambushed is a&#xD;
cominunication to their headquarters. Take that path,&#xD;
and find to what mystical rendezvous or hover it leads,&#xD;
and what dark deeds of treachery it witnesses. Cauion&#xD;
must be your watchword ; and let me advise you to keep&#xD;
your eyes open and have no confidants. Order your de-&#xD;
tail to camp."&#xD;
This plan was adopted and Lieutenant Hart was dis-&#xD;
patched as a seout and IJetective.&#xD;

CHAPTER III..&#xD;
" The widow gives us another ball to-night," said.-&#xD;
Charlie M---as he walked hurriedly in camp and ad-&#xD;
dressed a number of his comrades who had seated them--&#xD;
selves upon the pine straw and were very diligently watch-&#xD;
ing two of their number who were deeply interested in a&#xD;
contest at che'cks,-                    -&#xD;
"Not to us," answered one of the men, "Charlie, bit&#xD;
to you."&#xD;
&#xD;
"0 he !: the invitation is extended to as many of the&#xD;
squadron as are disposed to go. You must go, boys. We&#xD;
shall have splendid mnsie. 'Furthermore, there is to be&#xD;
some new ladies there. The widow, says they are beau-&#xD;
tiful."&#xD;
"Where are they to come from ?" was asked.&#xD;
"They are to run the blockade of our pickets to-night&#xD;
after dark, accompanied by Edgar and Austin. But this&#xD;
must not be made knbwn to Captain Forrester !"&#xD;
. "It will be a hazardous undertaking; and, further-&#xD;
more, it is acting in bad faith to the service. How are&#xD;
they to return ?"&#xD;
"I reckon the Captain will grant them a pass in the&#xD;
morning to return," answered Charlie.&#xD;
"You are mistaken, Charlie ; orders have just been is-&#xD;
sued that no one shall pass the lines without written per-&#xD;
mission from the General."&#xD;
"Never mind, boys, the matter is all fixed with the&#xD;
Captain, and-will all tirn out right," and Charlie turned&#xD;
away and walked to another portion of the encampment.,&#xD;
"That boy deserves sympathy," said one of his friends&#xD;
eyeing him closely as he left.&#xD;
"Why ?" . sked another.&#xD;
"Because by subtility that woman has completely en-&#xD;
trapped him, and is fast leading him astray. I for one&#xD;
have but little confidence in her."&#xD;
"I am sure that she has always treated us very kindly,&#xD;
and, for all I know, she is a perfect lady."&#xD;
"Very true, but'I do not like the cut of her eye. Fur-&#xD;
thermore, her husband died in the Yankee service, and&#xD;
some even doubt his, being dead at all-nevertheless,sI&#xD;
suppose she is called widow."&#xD;
"She could not help what her husband did.&#xD;
" Probablp not."&#xD;
Three hours afterwards and the merriment at the wid.-&#xD;
~ow's ball was at its acme.&#xD;

the relief, who have reported it-to the Captain. The&#xD;
Captain says that he intends to arrest the ladies early in&#xD;
the morning, aid he has doubled the picket lines to pre-&#xD;
vent their escape. The Captain has offered a reward to&#xD;
know the boys that piloted them tl.rough.' The relief&#xD;
could not recognize them in the dark. Edgar is strongly&#xD;
+     suspected."&#xD;
"I know that none of the boys who are knowing to all&#xD;
the circumstances will betray Edgar and Austin, end I&#xD;
will make all of these facts known to them immediatelyl"&#xD;
saying this Charlie called his two friends to one side&#xD;
and related the circumstances to. them.&#xD;
"This is very strange conduct on the part of the Cap-&#xD;
rain, or else 1 have been deceived in the matter," said&#xD;
Austin, "for-"&#xD;
" Never mind, boys," interrupted Charlie, '" it will all&#xD;
be right."&#xD;
Yes, but if Captain Forrester made this threat he will&#xD;
carry it into execution unless the ladies are carried back&#xD;
through the lines before day. And this must be done.&#xD;
Go,Edgar, and tell them what has.happened. Tell them&#xD;
that we will take them back at four o'clock, and be ready"&#xD;
then to start. Tell them, also, that it will be impossible&#xD;
to.take them back on horse-back, and that they will have&#xD;
:to walk."-                        .&#xD;
Edgar did as he was advised and soon returned with&#xD;
the report that the ladies were very much excited, and&#xD;
ready to start immediately."&#xD;
" No," says Austin, "at four o'clock the fifth relief will&#xD;
take post. We will pass the lines at patrol number one.&#xD;

At four the patrol' will be expecting the, relief and' will&#xD;

"And then how ?" asked Edgar.&#xD;
"We will get into the field at the gate, from whence&#xD;
there is a smdll path leading into the main read beyond&#xD;
the last vidette post."&#xD;
'How.near the pickets do we have to pass ?'&#xD;
"In rifle shot ; but if we are cautious we shall pass un-&#xD;
observed.'"&#xD;
At the hour set apart this plan was put in execution.&#xD;
As they passed out o.f the field, at which place they were&#xD;
safely across the picket lines, Austin~exclaimed:&#xD;
" And now I feel relieved. All danger is now over.,&#xD;
" Was'nt that the tramp of horses' hoofs'on the road ?"&#xD;
asked Edgar.&#xD;
" Be still."&#xD;
" The enemy ! the enemy !" whispered one of the young&#xD;
ladies. You had better return to y our command. We&#xD;
are not afraid now to return home by ourselves."&#xD;
"We are sorry'that we cannot see you safely home, but '&#xD;
it is bes-t for us to return," and, extending their hands to&#xD;
the young ladies, they bid them in- haste good-bye.&#xD;
" Tell Captain Forrester," whispered oe of the young&#xD;
ladies, but before she could complete the sentence she was&#xD;
abruptly interrupted by her companion ; and the two&#xD;
young men hastened back in the direction of their camps.&#xD;
When they were passing their picket post they were,&#xD;
as they had'done before, using great precaution for fear&#xD;
of being discovered. Edgar halted suddenly and laid his&#xD;
hand on the shoulder of his companion.&#xD;
"Hark !" he whispered, " an.advancing footstep ahead.&#xD;
Lie down."&#xD;
The form of a man passed them. "He is alone," whis-&#xD;

CHAPTER IV.&#xD;
If three days previous had made a lasting impression&#xD;
upon the mind of Captain Forrester, indeed this was a&#xD;
day of memorable events to the entire command. The&#xD;
most important information had been communicated to&#xD;
the General commandingby this'nerveusspy and his dis-&#xD;
patch, while the minor deeds of treachery that had been&#xD;
going on even within the bounds of, Captain Forrester's&#xD;
camps began to unfold themselves before his eyes.&#xD;
The day commenced~with a demonstration by the enemy&#xD;
upon the picket lines. The pickets were everywhere&#xD;
driven back upon the reserve, when, to maintain their&#xD;
position, a most desperate skirmish took place, which,&#xD;
though it resulted in completely routing the insolent foe,&#xD;
yet many of our bravest boys had fallen. Among those&#xD;
were Edgar'and Austin, who, while feeling the trength&#xD;
i the enemy's.line of battle in the first part of the en-&#xD;
gagernent, were shot dead, and at a point, too, where no&#xD;
nemy was suspected.&#xD;
Hardly had the enemy;disappeared, the line of battle&#xD;
been broken and the excitement . of the morning passed&#xD;
away, when LieutenantHartireturned to camp from his&#xD;
epedition.&#xD;
This was a new case of excitement, for every one could&#xD;
see in his tell-tale countenance that~he had brought infor-&#xD;
matiou of importance.&#xD;
" What's the news!f what's the news I Lieutenant ?"&#xD;
asked voice after voice.&#xD;
&#xD;
i&#xD;

&#xD;
"I suppose you thrashed the Yankees this morning,"&#xD;
would be his evasive answer.&#xD;
He sought Captain Forrester in1 private interview. The&#xD;
camp was in breathless suspense until broken by-an order&#xD;
issued by the Captain : "For all of the men to be ready&#xD;
to march at four o'clock, on foot."&#xD;
When the men were marched to the field of operation.,&#xD;
nut one knew where he was, nor what he was to do. They&#xD;
had marched through the wild woods -for an hour and a&#xD;
half, and were now halted in the thickest place they had&#xD;
-   seen. The Captain andLieutenant, who had lead their&#xD;
horses in the-rear a few moments before halting the men,&#xD;
had fastened them to trees   .&#xD;
"The Captain wants to hide us good," said one of the +&#xD;
men in mimic ridicule.&#xD;
Ordering the squadron to count off the strength of the&#xD;
line in an under tone, he divided it into two equal parts.&#xD;
With the first he formed a parallel line of battle, and,&#xD;
placing it in charge of Lieutenant Hart, he marched the,&#xD;
second forty paces, filed it to the right, halted, brought it&#xD;
to a front in a line corresponding witly the first.&#xD;
"Now make ready with your pieces, men, lie down and,&#xD;
await order 4"&#xD;
In the greatest suspense and anxiety they all prostrated&#xD;
themselves upon the earth, with their pieces cocked, and&#xD;
in a position to be discharged -at the command*AFire.&#xD;
How indiscribable is that ,feeling of impatience that at-&#xD;
tends the anticipation of a final issue. Every stroke of&#xD;
the heart seems to say "wait," while it apparently makes&#xD;
but four vibrations per hour.&#xD;
"What is to be done ?" would be asked by one of an.&#xD;
other all the way down the line.&#xD;
The suspense was one of novelty with the men. . Every&#xD;
thought would seem to ask its successor, "what's the is-&#xD;
sue ?"  With Captain Forrester it was different. His sus-&#xD;
&#xD;
pense was half doubt, intermingled with hopeful antiOi.&#xD;
pation. He and Lieutenant Hart alone in the-two line'&#xD;
then'confronting each other, knew that between them16y&#xD;
a small iut well beaten foot-path. As the last lingering&#xD;
sun beam took its departure from the tallest forest pine&#xD;
top,'the man on the left of the first line touched his nea-&#xD;
est comrade with his elbow. "Look," he whispered, and&#xD;
nodding his head to the left, he drew his attention to a&#xD;
detachment-say a hundred'--armed men marching ii&#xD;
single file, close order. On they marched unsuspecting.&#xD;
some wore the insignia of the soldier, both blue and gray,&#xD;
while by far the greeter portion were garbed in the habit&#xD;
ef the plebeian citizen.&#xD;
As the head of the ntarehing column passed the riglt&#xD;
ef the ambuscade, Captain Forrester rose coolly and or-&#xD;
dered his men " upon their feet."   The men sprang&#xD;
from their cover, like mad lanther, their guns sprung&#xD;
and levelled.&#xD;
" Surrender," he d.emanded in a firm yet animates&#xD;
voice.&#xD;
This fell upon their unsuspecting reverie like a thunder&#xD;
bolt. Some attempted to run, some. threw down their&#xD;
arms and shouted, "don't shoot."&#xD;
"Shoot out the brains of the first scoundrel that ak&#xD;
temptsto escape," ordered Captain Forrester.&#xD;
"We'll give up," and other tokens of surrender'rang&#xD;
out all the way down the line.&#xD;
Arrangements were made for their safe 'escort to the&#xD;
anmp, when the Captain shouted, "to our horses, Lieu-&#xD;
tenant, to our horses," and, mounting their restless&#xD;
chargers, they set off with almost lightning speed down&#xD;
the foot-path through the dense gloomy forest.  -&#xD;
The path brought them suddenly to ,n opening at thi&#xD;
Riouth of a lane. The Captain reined up.&#xD;
That is it," said the Lieutenant,,pointing to a cottag.-&#xD;
built farm-house two or three hundred yards in the d-&#xD;
nze.&#xD;

&#xD;
They drew their pistols from the holsters and, pressing&#xD;
their rowels to their horses' sides, they made them redou-&#xD;
ble their exertions. As they neared the gate leading to&#xD;
the yard, two armed men stepped from behind the gate&#xD;
posts, and, levelling their guns, fired. Lieutentant Hart&#xD;
reeled.in his saddle and finally fell from his horse, while&#xD;
Captain Forrester's horse fell dead in a few paces of the&#xD;
gate. He caught on his feet, however, and recovered&#xD;
from the shock of the fall, only to find himself confronted&#xD;
by the two men, who, with fixed bayonets, had thrown&#xD;
themselves in the'gate-way to dispute his farther advance.&#xD;
Raising his pistol he shot one of them dead in his tracks.&#xD;
The other, seeing the fate of his companion, endeavored&#xD;
to save himself by flight ; but, ere he made but few steps,&#xD;
he met a like fate. The Captain.now caught his pistol im&#xD;
his left, and, drawing 1 lissabre with his right hand, rushed&#xD;
en still to the house. As he placed his foot upon the door&#xD;
steps the smoke from a musket almost stifled him, but the&#xD;
hall missed its mark. .Raising his sabre at a "teirce&#xD;
point" he thrust it into the bosom of his antagonist, and&#xD;
bore him struggling .to the floor. Like a tiger roused&#xD;
from his lair, with the scent of blood, he leaped over the&#xD;
prostrated body of the eying man and into the passage of&#xD;
the house. To the left he spied a shut door. With an&#xD;
elastic bound he threw himself against it and hoisted it&#xD;
from its hinges. As his ey es met its interior, now shaded&#xD;
by the soft evening twilight, a woman, with hands ex-&#xD;
tended towards Heaven and speechless with fear, met him&#xD;
and knelt at his feet.&#xD;
Are you," he demanded,    one of the fiends of this&#xD;
den, to?"         .     '-&#xD;
She fixed her dark' blue eyes upon the blade crimsoned&#xD;
with a father's gore, and now raised over her own de-&#xD;
fenceless head, and in a faint, tremulous voice implored&#xD;
'him to spare her life.&#xD;
For a minute he stopped-" arrested in his mad career"&#xD;

CHAPTER T&#xD;
The next morning following these tiagieal events was&#xD;
ese of those calm mornings when winter-is just emerging&#xD;
into spring, when a placid smile hay be said to be dawn-&#xD;
ing upon the lips of nature-when each little songster dares&#xD;
to speak forth an anxious carol in unison with the notes&#xD;
of the gladdened insects that have been awakened by a&#xD;
stealing sunbeam. A morning that brings gloom over&#xD;
dhe despondent and makes the grave;, light-hearted, mirth-&#xD;
ful-when joy and despair seem to linge; together upon&#xD;
ihe air:.-&#xD;
As the sun lifted his sparkling face rbove the low wall&#xD;
of smoke that belted the surrounding horizon,. all the&#xD;
gloom in the neighboring atmosphere seemed to concen-&#xD;
trate and hover over Captain Forrester's camp. It was&#xD;
indeed a picture of a calm after a storm to a ship-wrecked&#xD;
crew, who had been rescued from  immediate death, but&#xD;
doorped to perish by degrees upon a barren and solitary&#xD;
sock in the immense bosom of the briny deep. Here and&#xD;
there might be seen one gloomy face, seated undisturbed.&#xD;
and alone, his mind wandering apparently in the fathom-&#xD;
less depths of despoudeney: At sone other point: groups,&#xD;
were assembled as though to mingle and share each others&#xD;
ennui. The death of a comrade, a mess-mate or afriend&#xD;
dad tb be commemorated in mutual sympathy.&#xD;
At headquarters things had been quite astir at an early&#xD;
hour. During the night couriei-s had been dispatched t®&#xD;
and returned from  the General Commandiag, with in-'&#xD;
structions. At sunrise Captain Forrester was walking&#xD;
back and forth ip front of his tent, his eyes fixed intently&#xD;
upn the earth and grasping 'tightly his right arma with&#xD;

his left, both.of'which were drawn tightly across hip bo-&#xD;
som. something haunted him ; and what was it?&#xD;
Charlije entered the camp hurriedly and sought him. ~&#xD;
".Captain--," his voice faltered.&#xD;
"Have you-obeyed my orders, Charlie ?'&#xD;
' We found it impossible, Captain.''&#xD;
"Impossible !'' retorted the Captain.&#xD;
"We found her a corpse.''&#xD;
A crpse, indeed".-.&#xD;
"She has Coinntted suicide,'' said Charlie, handing&#xD;
the Caitain a note                                 -&#xD;
" She held this note in her han  which is addressed io&#xD;
you."&#xD;
The Captain read the note aloud as follows&#xD;
"I-know, Captain i orrester; before this yiu have been&#xD;
apprised of m'y Wickedness. I know that es cape is im-&#xD;
possible, and I have preferred death to-disgrace.&#xD;
So, Charlie, this widow, wih hw i:om we have all as-&#xD;
sociated and recognized as a friend, has beei one of the&#xD;
chief accomplices in getting information to the enemy.--&#xD;
She has been a spy e en vhwithin the bounds of our camp .&#xD;
Charlie icoked horrornstricken ; for this widked woman&#xD;
by her cunning devices, had exerted an influence over&#xD;
his youthful heart that was fast developing itself in a&#xD;
deep-seated affection. His ftr lhve was blighted at a&#xD;
blow. In this note he saw her history at a glnce. How&#xD;
he had been duped I For a moment lie was moved ; but&#xD;
how easily can the heart forgive a fatl, even in a worth-&#xD;
less object of affection?&#xD;
When Captain E'or." ete had obstarined satisfactory e vi-&#xD;
deuce of the guilt Oh this woman he knew not of the inti-&#xD;
- *macy that existed between Oharlie and herselF, and, as&#xD;
Charlie was one oi his favorites, he was charged with the&#xD;
execution of the order for her arrest. Charlie could not,&#xD;
would not, shrink from the duty, but resolved in his heart&#xD;
to rescue her frQm imprisonment. But with her own&#xD;
&#xD;
hands she had snow shut herself within the walls of a&#xD;
prison-house, from which the most desperate lover hae&#xD;
never attempted to extricate the ideal of his heart. And.&#xD;
now Charlie retires from the further thread of this story,&#xD;
if not a better at least a mueh wiser-boy.&#xD;
But this did not ease the heart and; calm the troubled.&#xD;
bosom of Captain Forrester. He had been the hero in'&#xD;
noble enterprise. His whole actions must come before the&#xD;
eyes of the world for approval or disapproval; but&#xD;
" Let th e  -it}!d  '='-:t tUa'  mer knew&#xD;
One tender Iog te geruts nature tru "&#xD;
condemn him.&#xD;
Lieutenant Tart, whom we left fallen from his, horse in&#xD;
the lane near the deserter's house, not killed but severely&#xD;
wounded in the head, as soon as he recovered from the&#xD;
shock was placed upon his faithful steed that did pot do-.&#xD;
sert him; by Captain Forrester, and succeeded in return-&#xD;
ing to camp, from whence he was sent to the hospital at&#xD;
Kinston. Little Lula, who had borne herself out nobly&#xD;
before the General by telling all she knew and probably&#xD;
a great deal more,-when she heard that Lieutenant Hart&#xD;
was at the hospital wounded, volunteered her services to&#xD;
nurse him ; and when a day or two afterwards he was&#xD;
granted  permission  to be sent home by his regnest&#xD;
she accompanied him.     Mrs. Hart, the Lieutenant's&#xD;
mother, is very much interested in her history as related&#xD;
by herself, and will not consent for her to leave. Little&#xD;
Lula is very happy now and says the Lieutenant is her&#xD;
sweet healtt.&#xD;
The "Cit-t-e-ezin,'' with his vile abetters, have met a&#xD;
very merited end, that is the end of a rope.&#xD;
Now let uns return and follow Captain Forrester through&#xD;
the sequel of his noble project:&#xD;
Captain Forrester of himself had undertaken a worthy&#xD;
- purpose, that of bringing a treasonable league of his fel'&#xD;
low-.ountrymen to the ba'r of justice. How far he had&#xD;

Headquarters and had given it a death-blow. But hadhe&#xD;
net conte short-of his duty #t .,        .         .&#xD;
At that headquarters he found a woman, a daughter of&#xD;
the ring leader.' He, as a military chieftain. was acting&#xD;
for the cause of his country, regardless of selfish conside-&#xD;
ration. He ought to have arrested her, but the sympathy&#xD;
de had elicited .in her behalf had caused him to forego&#xD;
mat unpleasant ordeal. She was a woman-like hit&#xD;
mother--like his sister. She might be an enemy-an ac-.&#xD;
eemplice in the hell-born band that be had crushed. Such&#xD;
a train of thoughts as these were wrangling in his bosom&#xD;
this morning. But he saw her still in his mind as he had&#xD;
seen her in reality-the pure; innocent, blue-eyed Julia-&#xD;
te "angel in the den of ruffians "-a lily that had&#xD;
sprung up unfortunately among brambles-the aromatic.&#xD;
Ettle flower-that seemed destined&#xD;
-   .     '    *    *   " To blush unseen&#xD;
And waste its swetuess on the desert air'.':&#xD;
In these operations he had been General, commander-&#xD;
in-chief, as well as the war making power.- Might he not&#xD;
be allowed to exercise his judgment in the entire plan,&#xD;
regardless of what th'e world night -say in detail; and&#xD;
hope to be justified by the final results?-&#xD;
"Surely," he thought, "there can be no treachery in&#xD;
a heart to which those eyes are the index."-       '&#xD;
. But the idea haunted him in the farther discharge of&#xD;
lis duty. ' At the very consummation of his plan he risk-&#xD;
ed his judgment in an important matter, and might it&#xD;
mot have beeii modified by tears in the eyes of a beautiful&#xD;
woman. He stopped in his walk ; some solid henclusion&#xD;
iad passed through his mind. He said aloud :&#xD;
"Human nature is deceitful, and woman is an unsolved&#xD;
mystery. If she las deceived me-if she is an accomplice&#xD;
of the enemy, now she has neither home nor friends, she&#xD;
Xll seek his protection.°&#xD;
&#xD;

As sooi as a respite from duty wonid permit hire'he r-&#xD;
safed to satisfy himself by seeing her again. So, iount-&#xD;

.he met him at the gate the same warm-hearted Julia ;&#xD;
nevertheless wearing an expression of sadness in her sym-&#xD;
pathy-inspirin-g eyes. But she did not meet him as one&#xD;
who had been the means of throwing her upon the old&#xD;
. world without a friend to sympathize ora home te shelter&#xD;
her head, but as her deliverer. 'When he grasped her ex-&#xD;
tended hand, its warm palm sent a pang of sorrow to his"&#xD;
keai-t that nothing save restoration to her could ease and&#xD;
caused a tear to concentrate in his fierce eyes.&#xD;
" Julia," said he, " I came this  orning that yoi&#xD;
might tell me of and show me those pans of which you&#xD;
spoke yesterday&#xD;
"Come in, Captain."&#xD;
"Thank you I would be glad to do so, but I must soon&#xD;
return."&#xD;
She flitted back into the house and soon returned ready&#xD;
to accompany him to the house where but the evenifig&#xD;
previous he had been the hero in so bloody a tragedy.-&#xD;
They walked on in silence ; for what could he say. She&#xD;
broke the suspense:&#xD;
"Captain, Itold you last evening that-I had been hell&#xD;
- as a prisoner-I told you that I had one opportunity of&#xD;
communicating to you tl* treason that was going on in&#xD;
he neighborhood of your commnd. On the night of the&#xD;
widow's ball my father consented for me, accompanied by&#xD;
a wicked woman, one of his accomplices, to go with me in&#xD;
your lines, (she went with the purpose of obtaining infor-&#xD;
mation.) 1 intended to go to you and expose the whole&#xD;
affair ; but your threat to arrest us, coupled with, the&#xD;
knowledge that I'was in bad company, and would be un-&#xD;
able to exculpate myself' intimidated me, and my planu&#xD;
were all frustrated."&#xD;
-" Where is that wonian now ?" asked the Captain.&#xD;

"She has escaped to the enemy and will go to New&#xD;
York, where she has relatives ; and she is, therefore,&#xD;
gone forever beyond your readh."&#xD;
Just at-this moment they emerged into a large neigh-&#xD;
borhood road, one end of which led to a Confederate pick-&#xD;
et stand and the other through Dover Swamp into the&#xD;
"lower Neuse road."  Julia stopped suddenly and burst-&#xD;
ed into tears.&#xD;
" Captain,'' said she, ' here, a few days 'age, my poor&#xD;
misguided mother sufferect herself to be placed as a senti-&#xD;
nel while my father endeavored to surprise and capture&#xD;
your pickets, was encountered by some one, on whom she&#xD;
frTed. In the contest she was shot and killed. My father&#xD;
suspected some of your men and, to retaliate, he tookmy&#xD;
poor little sister that night and started in your lines with&#xD;
a phial of arsenic, which she was to deposit in the well&#xD;
from which you obtained water. Onhis way be was met&#xD;
by a number of soldiers,. who captured her and fired on&#xD;
him. I have not heard from him since.'' Overcome by&#xD;
these thoughts she seated herself upon a fallen tree and&#xD;
burst into a most violent paroxysm of grief.&#xD;
Captain Forrester watched her in wonder. and agitation&#xD;
until his heart grew sick within his bosom. He seated&#xD;
himself by her side and threw his arm gently around her'&#xD;
shoulders and drew' her to his bosom.&#xD;
"CJulia,'' said he, "'will you--''&#xD;
"Captain Forrester," she'exclaimed, endeavoring to&#xD;
free herself from his grasp, "would y ou insult a poor girl.&#xD;
whose heart'is already borne to the earth with sorrow--&#xD;
whom a father's conduct has (Jisgraced."&#xD;
"Hear me, Julia-if you can ever love me, hear me.&#xD;
Since I have deprived you of all that you must have held&#xD;
.dear on earth-since I have deprived you of friends and&#xD;
"home-I here offer you my love as remuneration and my&#xD;
hands to protect you. Say, Julia, that you will be n y&#xD;
'wife."&#xD;
&#xD;
a&#xD;
&#xD;
How could she believe him otherwise than true?  One&#xD;
look at his face was sufficient to convince har of the purdy&#xD;
of his heart.&#xD;
"You do not love me, ai!d if you do I am unworty of&#xD;
your love."&#xD;
"If I thought so, Julia, I should surely be unworthy&#xD;
of yours,"&#xD;
Leaning with complacent confidence upon the arm that&#xD;
had slain mother, father and brother, she sighed--- and&#xD;
a few days afterwards General Picket signed Captain For-&#xD;
rester's leave of absence for thirty 'days, and he led t&#xD;
the altar his beautiful- Julia; TuE DESERTER's DAUGUT] a&#xD;
