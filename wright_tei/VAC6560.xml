BY ULRIC DE LAZIE, Gentleman. NEW YORK: P. O'SHEA, 104 BLEECKER STREET. 1864.    <pb n="0" xml:id="VAC6560-00000002"/> Entered, according to Actof Congress, in the year 1864, by EDMUND D. GRIFFIN, In the District Court of the United, States for the Southern District of New York.   DEDICATION. I AM excessively puzzled how to word my dedica- tion, for I wish to inmitate the oracles of old, and vie with the mystic revelations of Dodona, of Delphi, of the Macedonian Amphiaraus, and' the Caspian Na- barca. I would utter my Kpoto-o? AXvv Staf3ag JzeyaXflv apXnv KcaraXvaet -to puzzle my readers accordingly, so that each of my acquaintances who desire this great honor, may read this and say, "Bless my soul! the book is positively dedicated to me." Hence, as in the old game of forfeits, I wish it dis, tinetly understood that I inscribe this to-the prettiest, address it to the wittiest, and dedicate it to the one I love best. Some persons of insignificant position in the polite world may suppose I am here alluding to myself; number one being usually the object of our tenderest regards. I do not precisely deny this, for I    <pb n="vi-vii" xml:id="VAC6560-00000003"/> vi          DEDICATION. have considerable affection for myself, and am some- what interested in my own prospects in life. But, at the same time, being inclined, as I before stated, to be. Sir Oracle, I distinctly wish it understood that I do not commit Myself by any confession. ]Now I agree with Montaigne,* when he says he regards many of Csesar's exploits as indicative of a resolution to win or die; and I concur with that cel- ebrated essayist in regarding it as a very great feature in any person's character, provided the thing to be won is worth dying for--a good saving clause, which will forever preserve me from any too practical application of my principle. As my present object is to be oracu- lar, and to achieve the glorious victory of winning every one without exciting jealousy (for, of course, there will be an immense competition to secure the honor of this dedication, equal to an American crowd of office seekers at the inauguration of a new Presi- dent), it behooves me, as a hero, to sink or swim, live or die, survive or perish at my post. Therefore I again repeat that the Muse of Prose, the laurel-crowned Clio, the glory-celebrating daughter of Mnemosyne, who in- vented history, and who presides over the chronicles of Dreamland, is the one who inspires me with gas, such -,;s once intoxicated the Pythoness, and, making me  .to use a -playful expression) a very gassy indi- * "Quant i moy/ il me semble lire en plusieurs de ses exploicts une certaine resolution de se perdre, pour fuyr la honte d'estre vaincu." --'iss de Montaigne, liv. ii, ch. xxxiv.   DEDICATION.        Vii vidual, causes me to spout out the following words- the substance of this immortal dedication: DEDICATED TO THE ONE TO VIRTUE MOST DEDICATED. TTis, I flatter myself, will cause a huge sensation. Mighty will be the rush to catch this honor, even as at rustic fairs many hands are stretched out to seize the prize pig by its greased tail. The most virtuous! Nobody says he is the most virtuous; but if we are to/Jldge people by the way they decide upon their n ighbors' misdemeanors, and by the way they ex- cuse themselves on every possible occasion, we have some grounds for assuming most of our acquaintances --not exclusive of ourselves-consider themselves as vastly superior to the world in which they live. Hence those who read this (if any do) will have a lingering notion that I can mean no one but the reader then and there present. To you, then, dear sovereign of Ulric de Lazie, first when present, first when absent, and first in virtuous excellence-to you, whoever you are, wherever you are, and whatever you are-to you who never slander your neighbors, bully your servants, fawn on the' rich, or despise the poor-to you who can be proud with reason and humble by goodness, just to the rich, and generous to the poor, beautiful in form and chaste in love, indig- nant at sin, but gentle with the sinner, true always, amiable always, noble always-to you, paragon, wher- ever you may be found, do I, Tlric de Lazie, offer ms    <pb n="viii-ix (Table of Contents) " xml:id="VAC6560-00000004"/> Viii       INTRODUCTION. homage dutifully and cordially. And I beg you to recommend this book to others, because I want to make a swinging profit on it, if I can. As I have quoted Greek and French, let me show my scholarship by furnishing my dedication with a quotation from the language of Cicero and Virgil- Sic transit gloria mundi. Thus my novel, the glory of the world, runs away to the printer's. Be charitable, ye critics; and thou, tutelary genius of writers,'descend with thy flower-encir- cled head, and thy preceous cornucopia, showering on my forehead coronets of laurel, and cypress, and the emblematic thyme, and the sweet-scented rose; even as Aquarius, the son of Tros, the son of Ericthonius, the son of Dardarus, the son of Jupiter, born to his cloud- compelling ancestor, to return in gusts, and thunder, and fertilizing rain, pours plenty of liquid from his/ celestial watering-pot on the thirsty bosom of Cybele.

THE doors are open. Already pit, gallery, and boxes are filled with an eager audience: for the new melodrama, tragedy. comedy, or whatever you choose to call it, is about to begin, and there is much curiosity respecting it. Before the first act there will be a Prologue, and, after the fifth, an Epilogue. The author sustains a part; many brilliant stars have volunteered for the occasion; all deadheads, except the press, are refused admittance; and, in fine, there is an intense excitement about it throughout the theatrical world. Will it succeed, or fail? What is the author thinking about now? Is he nervous?                      f The truth is, that the author is neither trembling nor nervous. In that state of mind which virtue alone inspires, "joy fills his soul, joy innocent of thought." Sustained by a cool and admirable self- conceit, he neither courts nor expects popularity. To court, means to try to please a superior. To expect, implies doubt. Superior himself, he cannot court. Certain, he cannot expect. Why? Because self-sufficiency is essential to dulness, and dulness (at least when shown in dressing nothing in substantial and im- posing forms) is the passport to success. Therefore the author, in the consciousness of genius and certainty of eventual success, is at present sitting on a table, drinking lager bier, behind the scenes. The gentlemen who are to play chorus by and by are round him, similarly employed; except one, who, in the vanity and glory of having a perfectly new suit, is engaged in a futile attempt at    <pb n="xiv-xv" xml:id="VAC6560-00000007"/> xiv           PROLOOUE. looking upon the back buttons of his coat while it is on him; a thing which no mall but an indiarubber man can ever reasonably expect to do. Timotheus, placed on high amid the tuneful choir, now taps the tin before him, and the overture begins. See them sweat! Clang-clash go the cymbals, toot-toot go the flutes, rub-a-dub-dub go the drums, bray-bray go the trumpets, tweedle-de-dee squeak the fiddles. Up, down, left, right, flourishes the fiddlestick of Timotheus.. Slap over the leaf, fiddle a little, then again up, down, left, right. That's right, Timotheus! Brayvo, sir. Get excited now; keep the pot boiling. There are the whole set of them working away at an overture which nobody listens to, and everybody wishes was over; and which is accompanied by the box opener, who audibly expresses his thoughts in such words as these: "Can't sit there, sir; taken. Go a little farther on. Can't you sit a little closer, ladies? Here's a seat ma'm," and so forth. Ha! There's the bell. Hats off, gentlemen. The curtain rolls up. And now for the Prologue. That's the author. Where  Him at the table. Is it, though? Silence! Hush! The scene is a study, with books, globes, busts, etc., strewn round. The author, a pale, interesting youth, with long hair and Byron collars, is seen sitting at a table, writing. He raises his head languidly, and delivers himself in the following original manner : "In the midway of this our mortal life, I found me in a gloomy woods asth ay, Gone from the path direct." Good! There can be no doubt but that I have turned up, somewhere in that neighborhood. I wonder whether Virgil is going to come, at the command of Beatrice, and pilot me to heaven, via hell and purgatory? [He rises, and paces up and down rapidly, then turns to the window.]. Again that cheerless prospect Away, thou foul quintessence of the tedious! O ye, wont only to pass your summers in the rustic portions of the world, how little can ye realize the weariness of this melancholy season in a country village; with the wind howling dismally around, the bitter cold biting shrewdly he nose when its owner stirs abroad, the terrible and sloppy vexations of a thaw, and the consequent effect of all these -divers discomforts upon those who   PROLOG US2.            XV inhabit the land. I shall seek in sleep a Lethean refuge from tho ennui of these inhospitable shores: "I And by a sleep to say we end The heartache, and the thousand natural shocks That flesh is heir to. 'Tis a consummation Devoutly to be wished." Indeed it is. I thank thee, Shakspeare! Yet sleep comes not always at a mortal's bidding. I can call spirits from the vasty deep as well as Glendower-but I ask, with Hotspur, Will they come when called? Nay! I have heard-and do in part believe it-that when the Morphean spirits do refuse obedience to our spirit-wearied call, there is a potent and undoubted spell to suck them from their subterranean spheres, by fancying nine hundred silly sheep chasing ea(ch other in an Indian file over a wall.

AUTH.--Thou art lovely, yet cruel; enchanting, yet sorrowful. May I not, like Cato, seek oblivion? Must I always be the victim of a rooster? MEM.-Victim of a rooster? Thy sorrows, son, have driven thee beside thyself. AUTH.--Am I destined always to be looking out-of the window at the house over the way? Must I ever be contemplating the melancholy rooster of those people; a bird who is eternally stand ing upon one legt, except when he is standing on the other? There he is. Yon can see him yourself; standing like Poe's raven, "a grim, ungainly, ghastly, gaunt, and ominous bird." M EM.-M-Say it not be, in the mysterious dispensations of for- tune, that there are roosters who die of broken hearts? May it not be that these animals are more sensible than man supposes? May it not be that JEsop, and Gay, and La Fontaine, and the author of Reinecke Fuchs, like Pythagoras, held esoteric revela- tions concealed under exoteric symbols? May it not be that Ori- ental mythology is correct, and transmigration the true religion? Consider, my son. Thou thyself mayst be a rooster in the ages to come. May it not be- AUTEr. [impatiently interrupting].-I tell thee, spirit, that rooster is the bane of my life, the worry of my lazy hours, the concentration of all that is horrible in this dull period of the year. M[EM.-The power of memory is upon thee. Speak, and tell me what brought thee to thy present condition? AUTH.--I sought oblivion in study. The subject I chose was the Oriental faiths; plunging wholesale into such a labyrinth of revelations, that the little sense I had was knocked out in an in- conceivably short period of time. Buddhism, Brahlminism, thoe Tao philosophy, the doctrines of Confucius, Mohammedanism, the faith of Zoroaster, all became jumbled up together like the four-and-twenty blackbirds- MEi.--I beg your pardon. The what? AUTH.-Four-and-twenty blackbirds baked in a pie. MEM.--Oh! ah! I remember. Proceed, my son. AUTI.--At length I became so bewildered, that, whether the Zendavista was preached by Genghis Khan, or whether Confucius taught that there was but one God, and Mohammed was his prophet,   PROLOGUE.           XYlV or whether Laou-Tszee and the Dalai Lama were originally one and the same persons, were open questions in my mind. I got up. MEgM.-And then? AUTH.--Shook my fist at the rooster. MEM.--Pass over that. What didst thou next? AUTH.-Tried again.  Nol Daedalus and Icarus were not more caught in their own net, than I in mine. [He pauses, and meditates gloomily. MEM.-Continue. AUTH.-- How could a man make a proper selection, with the eaves dripping, the trees dripping, the gutter tinkling as the water plashed down from the roof, and that infernal rooster over the way looking as if he were just about to give up the ghost? MEM.-Come I I see thy mind is in an unhealthy state. Spirits I draw back the curtain of reminiscence, and fashion it into dream form. [The AUTHOR sinks down. The background opens, and dis" cevers VISHNU on a chariot among the clouds. Enter, meeting him, MOHAMMED, CHAKIA-MOUNI, CONFUCIUS, ZOROASTER, LAOU-TSZEE, and five half-starved blue devils. mVISHNU.-Most potent, grave, and reverend signors! Vishnu salutes you from the seventh heaven. Son of the Hegira! slain, alas I by mutton; and you, illustrious sages, I call you here on a sacred mission. Does it trouble your celestial hearts?   e TaE OTHERS.-NO, sir. Far from it. We are only too happy to oblige you. VISH.-Thank you, gentlemen. I will not keep you long; for one of you, I see, is hurried. CONFUCIUS [sententiously].-When you call upon a man of business in the hours of business, talk of business, and nothing but business; then, when you have finished your business, go about your business, and leave him to attend to his business.

IREAMS WITHN DREAMS. CHAPTER I. HOW ALBERT, ROMANUS, AND MY LORD CLODOLPHUS MADE THEIR FIRST ENTRANCE.            V IN the time of IKing Louis, XIII, there stood in one of the valleys of the great Dreamland empire an ancient chateau, known by the name of Castle Bertrand. It is to the park surrolunding this edifice that we direct our reader's attention. The hlour is late; )but the solemn night, withdrawing her army of stars into the bltie vault as the moon slowly rises in her glory, reveals the long avenues of tall trees, clear fountains adorned by variegated shells, and curved paths strewn with snowy pebbles, lying stretciled cut before the gray old towers of the castle. At this time and in this park we can distin- guish two men walking, whom1 we shall call Albert and Ro- manus. Thley seem to be in earnest conversation. The former is energetically instructing his companion how to act under some peculiarly delicate circumstance. The latter is evidently very stupid, and appears to misunderstand half his friend says, and not to understand the other half at all. Thls they continue their ramble in the park, where the obscurity relieves us of no inconsiderable trouble and per- plexity; since we have thereby an excuse for not dwelling minutely on their costume, much to our own gratificatio:!, and perhaps that of the reader also: for, since Sir Walter Scott's time, he who peruses the fanciful chronicles of the past, is generally forced to skip a long catalogue of vestments, which the author has been- at the pains of studying and describing to 19     <pb n="2-3" xml:id="VAC6560-00000010"/> 2    DREAMS WITHN DREAMS,  very little purpose. Let us, therefore, present the two actors on our stage as gentlemen, and suppose them to be genteelly clothed according to the latest Parisian mode. And, let us add, this must apply equally to all the other heroes and heroines who have the good luck to be rendered immortal by the pen  of our genius. But wh4t brought Albert and Romanus out so late at night? Jelousy was the spirit who had inspired Albert to  watch the/conduct of Nora Berthaldes de Piquemlont, in the i hopes of baking the engagement between her and his friend  Clovis Bertrand; for the poor son of a soldier had need of the rich heir of a noble, and marriage is woh0c to interfere with  bachelor friendships. Wherefore Albertplad watched nar- rowly the conduct of the Lady Nora; ind Fortune, smiling  upon his endeavors, now seemed to crown his labors with suc- cess; for he and Romanus had been secret witnesses of a clan- destine meeting, between that lady and a stranger, in the park. "I thought as much," remarked Albert, with a sneer, referring to what they had seen, "I thought as much. I never knew your exceeding pious persons turn out well. Extraordinary devotion is always suspicious; and, for one saint, you find a hundred hypocrites." "Oh! ah!" murmured Romanus. "To be sure-regular  bogus confessors, eh? You think so?" "Who does not?" remarked Albert. "I believe you," returned the other, who affected a no slight degree of sanctity himself; "I believe you. Was not what-do-you-call-um taken by a wooden horse?"  "Why," said Albert, stopping in his walk, and looking at his friend, as if he were very much amused at something,  "why, if [ drew my inference from nothing else, you would be enough. I need not go to the banks of the Scamander on such a voyage of discovery."  "What do you mean?" asked Romanus, who had a dreamy idea that something disrespectful might possibly be meant. "What do I mean?" echoed Albert, "why, I mean you."   i "Oh! you mean me, do you?" said Romanus, looking stolidly at his companion. "Why, man alive," replied Albert, "do you suppose your beads and litanies, your psalms and hymns, your matins, primes, lauds, terces, sexts, nones, vespers, and complines ever  i   DIREAMi W 1l VtJll' vi r-aiusso.  deceived me?-me, who know you to be a-pshaw I you need not look vexed, because that sort of a thing won't do for me. If you had the courage to draw your sword, the very sight of mine would hurry it back into its sheath." So saying, A left nodded his head expressively at his companion; who looked stupidly at him with his boiled eyes, as if he did not under- stand a single word he said: which was very probably the truth. "At the same time," continued Albert, "I may be doing your valor a grievous wrong. Here is a pleasant spot. Sup-  pose we draw. I shall really have great pleasure in measur- ing weapons with you beneath the pale, chaste rays of Diana." So saying, he urbanely kiAsed his hand, gracefully drew his sword with an air, and politely saluted his companion according to the strictest courtesy of the duello. Romanus fidgeted a little, took off his hat, scratched his head, looked silly, and replied: "Upon my life, I think not. Do, Albert, for goodness' sake, put up that infernal piece of iron; it makes me nervous." Albert laughed, as he returned his weapon to it, scabbard. "Ha!" said he, "we may trifle now, for the game's oir own at last. Ah! I will save Clovis." "Oh, you will, will you?" remarked Romanus. "I will," replied Albert, firmly; "it is his nature to be loved, and I love him-" "How can that be," interrupted the other, "whlen you have been scheming these last Nix months to make him un- happy? Don't you think it's yourself you love-not Clovis? "I tell you," replied Albert, coloring (for stupid people accidentally hit the mark pretty hard sometimes), "I tell you I love Clovis dearly, faithfully, constantly, and consistently. I hate all rivals, all who come in my way. Why, I would think nothing at all of assassinating you, for instance, if you were an obstacle to my plans." This candid little piece of information rather disconcerted the valorous Romanus, as the idea vividly occurred to him that the confidence of such a man was anything but desira- ble: seeing that secrets are sometimes prevented from being indiscreetly revealed by the summary prpcess of knocking the recipient thereof on the head. The brave Romanus edged off a little, and looked scared. "Clovis Bertrand," pursued Albert, not noticing, or pre- tending not to notice this movement, "loves this Nora. Con-    <pb n="4-5" xml:id="VAC6560-00000011"/> sequently she must be exposed. I may need a witness. Con- seqllenlly you are 1my confidant. Do you understand that?" Romants undelstanding that, the other continuedc: "I never liked women. Even when a snubbed and melan- choly little boy, I used to sit for hours pondering on the nature and attributes of your s weethearts " "My sweethearts?" interirupted Romanus, aghast; " my sweet healts? , I have no sweethearts." "Confound youl, and your sweethearts to boot!" cried Albert, irritably. "Who the devil is talking about you?  I mean thhoe anialsl, called the soft sex : your Heloises, Ber- ,shebas, llcretians, Cressidas, Thiisbes., Helens, Cleopatras, and the rest of the she-devils." i "i Of thLe what?"- asked Romlanus, politely. Albert looked sternly at his companion; and then, moved - by a solU1ddenl imulllIse (whichl, h1owevel, he checked on- thle instant), made a fierce step forward. Whlereat the other, nlis- taking tfhe motion for the commencement of a ruthless assault, to be made forthwith on his body, started back, tumbled over, and rolled helplessly and ignominliously in the dust. Recover- ing himself, however, like a true knight, worsted but not sulb- dued in some tournament, the brave Romanus rose to his feet. Concealing his amutsemenl, Albert looked fiercely at his colm- panion, who ruefully returned the gaze, rubbing his back thle while.  For a few seconds the two champions confronted each other, wlien Albert first broke t}le awfll silence. "Take care," quoth lie, tapping the hilt of }his swo'rd; " this little instrument has a flat as well as a sharp side. Do not compel me to draw it again, or yollr slhoulders will smarl, for a day or two aifterward. What'is the use of enllterlaining you ithl matters above the comprehensio n of a, scljoolboy?  alrk ye! You saw Lady Nora in the arms of a man?" Yes." "And that man a stranger?" "Yes." "By night, in this park?" Yes." "Remenmber to say that, if asked; and to say nothng, if not asked.  And now run awatv, and dltst yourself:" So saying, Albert stood watching Romanlus as he retreated, until the latter hlad disappeared: when he fell into a deep train of thcught, and seemed to be revolving something very im- portant in his mind.   DREAMS WTITHIN D REAMS.         5 As he thus stood thinking, who should come toward him but my lord Clodolphus?  And here we must respectfully pause a few moments, to introduce this extraordinary man with all the ceremonies befitting so wise and exalted a personage. Hieronymus Clodolphus de Thome (or Tome, as some spelt it) ;was of a noble family, closely allied to the princely house of ;Mangelwurzel. My lord Clodolphus himself was the most wonderful man of the age. His enormous learning, prodigious memory, and love of talk generally had the effectof showing his friends how near a man can approach the confines of insanity without -absolutely becoming an incurable lunatic: for the con- versation of the noblemanl was distracting; being wont to ram- ble and not wont to be brief. If reading books is all that is necessary to make a man wise, undoubtedly my lord Clodol- phus could lay claim to a huge amount of sapience. If quoting alolne, with a supreme contempt for appropriateness and a thor- ough conviction that a quotation was enough, whether it aDplied to the subject or not, be sufficient to make a controversialist, my lord Clodolplhus was decidedly the first polemic of his aoe. Otherwise he was a sterling man, of great sagacity, kind feel- ings, and honorable impulses: in short, a not uncolnmon nix- ture of gentleness, pedantry, obstinacy, and honesty. This was the gentleman who now approached Albert, as he stood musing in the park. "What brings your lordship out so late?" inquired Albert, - deferentially. Quoth my lord Clodolphns: "Verily, my young friend, it was philosophlly.  A pedantic fool, an ignoramus, as we say in Latin (for nlone are like the tl ncienl, Ronliais in their nomencla- ture; or, indeed, all other primitive nations, such as the Assyr- ians, the Egyptians, the Indians, the Medes, the Persians, the Greeks, the Eitruscans, the Gauls, the Celtoe, the Scythiai1ns, .nd the Scandinavans---to say nothing of the Danes, the Saxons, the Frtanks, the Bohemians, the Burgundians, the Vanlldals, tlhe Slavini, the Iuthungi, the Visigoths, and divers others), well! an ignoramus lias presumed to dispute my assertion that Patro- clus was an Irishlman." ;       "' Your lordship will have some difficulty in proving your theolry," remarked Albert, not a little inclined to laugh. Said my lord Clodolphu s: "Not in the least. The name Patroclus, my young friend (:L name which has bein held not only by the son of Menoetius and Sthenele, but also by sundry paynims, to wit, a certain Athenian averse to cleanliness, an S   -         .,    <pb n="6-7" xml:id="VAC6560-00000012"/> 6       DREAMS WITHN DREAMS. Archon, and a Lacedemonian spoken of by Thucydides), the name Patroclus is one undoubtedly Hibernian in its origin; together with all other names beginning with the monosyllable PAT-such, for example, as Pat-O'Rafferty, Pat-Flannagan, Pat-Murphy, and divers others." "And who was it, pray," asked Albert, smiling, "who dared encounter so keen a blade as your lordship's wit?" "You know him not," quoth my lord Clodolphus. "He is one Rappenhammer, a good soldier, and a merry boon compan- ion, but no scholar." "Indeed," said Albert, "the man surely must be a great fool to argue with your lordship." "Precisely what I say," quoth my lord Clodolphus. "What is the use of trying to convince a man like you?" said Albert. I cannot see," quoth my lord Clodolphus. "When you say anything, you stick to it, right or wrong," said Albert. "Of course I do," quoth nmy lord Clodolphus. "Why are we to be educated, if we are not right even when we are wrong?" said Albert. "Exactly so," quoth my lord Clodolphus; "your paradox is better than Tertullian's. You are, my excellent young friend, far beyond your years in wisdom." "Nay, wisdom grows in better soil; and I leave'the laurels to your lordship, who deserves so fairly the Olympian coronal," said Albert. "Now really, really it surprises me to find so much discre- tion in one so young," quoth my lord Clodolphus. "Perhaps," remarked Albert, "I have less than your in- dulgence supposes. Will your lordship condescend to honor me with a little advice?" "Proceed, nmy young friend," answered my lord Clodolphus. Albert was about to begin, when the other interrupted him. "Do you remark," said he, " my classic attitude?  "I do," replied Albert, reverentially. "Do so," continued my lord Clodolphus; "I always choose this position when my advice is asked. It is a facetious and merry jest of my own composition, albeit verily my friends rarely see the jocularity, unless I myself point it out. It is that of Agamemnon at Aulis, when Iphigenia was about to be sacri- ficed to Phoebe by Chalcas. Fancy Diana, appeased by my submission, subsituting a hind in the place of the innocent vice   DREAMS WITHN DREAMS.         7 tim. I hide my face in my cloak thus, as Atreides was repre- sented by Timanthes of Sicyon, who has been much applauded for the idea; albeit Euripides imagined and Polygnotus painted it before the birth of that artist. But what saith the ancient? I Rumor, res sine teste, sine judice, maligna, fallax:' which, being translated, means-Fame is a thing sans evidence, sans judge, malign, and deceptive." "And why do you play the' part of Agamemnon, even in jest, when your advice is asked?" inquired Albert. Said my lord Clodolphus: "Will not my opinion, the darling daughter of my soul, which springs, like Pallas, all armed from my laboring brain, soon fall, an innocent victim, on the altar?" How so?" asked Albert. "Innocent young man!" replied my lord Clodolphus; " ad- vice is begotten of experience, to be sacrificed by inexperience. It is prayed for, to be scorned; demanded, to be neglected; begged for, to be repudiated; received, to be refused; asked for, to be dishonored. Hence' stand I, verily like Agamem non, looking upon you as upon a ruthless Chalcas, ready to im- molate the innocent offspring of my brain at the shrine of self- sufficiency. But continue. Perhaps you are an exception to the rule." "Suppose-" began Albert, when he was interrupted by my lord Clodolphus. ' Supposition," remarked that gentleman, dogmatically, "is a very bad way of introducing a subject. Thus: a man says to me, 'Suppose you were a hyena.' I say to him, 'My friend, you are absurd. I am not a hyena, I never was a hyena, and I never expect to be a hyena. It is utterly impossible for me to suppose anything about the animal, except, perhaps, that, as books inform,us, it continually devours the fatlings of the S:  flock, whenever the possibility of so doing is practicable.'" "Well," said Albert, who was willing to say anything likely Aid  to stop the flow of his companion's observations, "let me then come at once to the point. I have a friend who is in love-" "In love, eh?" said my lord Clodolphus. "Stop there. :;   What kind of love? Is it furious, steady, blustering, or maud- lin; the passion of Orlando, Abelard, Brutus, or Antony?" Xi!   " "Whatever you please?" replied Albert, somewhat bewil- 'i'   dered. Said my lord Clodolphus: "My dear young friend, physi- cians are not verily competent to heal, unless they are perfectly possessed of the disease's symptoms (whether digestive, pulmo- }K    <pb n="8-9" xml:id="VAC6560-00000013"/> V            VV JlAi Y11-iht UJL^LJ^Ylbr, nary, nervous, cervical, epileptic, apoplectic, cataleptic, or dys- peptic) they are called upon to treat. Above all things let us have the prognosis. Therefore, in sooth, will I explain you the divers kinds of love. Love is furious when it is like a bull who sees a red shirt. Remove the shirt and you tame the bull. Abrocomus, in Arist,anetus, saith, ' Teclum vivere amem, tecum obeam lubens,' wlich, being translated, is: 'With thee I may take pleasure in living, withl thee I may die exceedingly pleased,' the which, verily, he may have been. ready to do or not, according to our opinion of his veracity. Of this kind we(re Armida, Tancred, Dido, Phaedra, Venus, and Potiphar's wife. Then you have steady, constant, undying love; the which, in sooth, I have remarked, is generally directed to lnumber one. Yet, I wot, there be such love, especially in the mafrvellous pleasant romances we read. There pay, for instance, be a steady love, which can only be unsteadied by contradictory cir- cumstances. Thus, Amoratts loves Atlnorata. Allorata loves not Amoratus.  In comes Superlativa.  Superlativa lov-es Amoratus. Superlativa is fairer than Almorata. Amlora"tus leaves Amorata for Superlativa; who, in due course of time, and with the churclh's blessing, becomes MrsI. Amoratuss. Again, there is, we are told, a steady love by prinlciple; t lie which, surely, can only be overcome by principle. Tlim.1, Don Ricardo Alberto Nunez loves the dainty Donna Martfla Isa- bella Dolores de Pontenegro, a supposed widow. In   the middle of a love scene, wlien Don Ricardo is at the feiet of the dainty Donna Martha, suddenly in comes the huSlband, Don Juan Perez Pizaro Garcia le 'Pontensnero, and threatens to cut off the head of Don Ricardo, if he does not immediately get up and go away out of that. -Don Ricardo is a good Catholic, and does not want. his llead cut off. He rises, apologizes, bows, walks off, and leaves the daintuy Donna Martha to the chaste embraces of Don Juan Perez Pizaro Garcia. Besides these kinds of love, you have the blustering--not unlike a kettle--hot, loisy, vaporous, and puffy. This we see in the case of Artemisia, who, we are told, drank her husband's bones beaten to powder; a beverage I have always thougllt both unwholesome and un- savory. Lastly, you have love maudlin, which is the consum- mation of all that is the ass in human nature. You may place Paris of Troy, Anacreon, and David Rizzio in this category. ,Now, which of all these, pray, young friend, can you say cllar- acterizes your fiiend's affection?" "Whew I " said Albert to himself, "has he come to an end   at last?"Then he continued aloud, "My friend is steady by principle " "Very good," replied my lord Clodolphus; " you may now tell me the matter; but you had better be quick, as verily you have wasted my precious tinie already with your idle talk." Albert opened his eyes wide. '"If," pursued my lord Clodolphus, severely, "if you had told me at once your friend was an upright, steady man, you would have spared me all these remarks." Albert devoutly wished he had, but tookl care not to express the thollg ,t aloud. He then proceeded, with divers lengthy interruptions friom my lord Clodolphus, to make that gentleman acquainted with Lady Nora's conduct: it being the fill deter- ination of the young man to leave Clovis no loophole to escape breaking tlte engagement on the score of secrecy. How my lordt Clodolphlus was affected by this, will be seen hereafter. CHAPTER II. HOW ALBERT ACQUAINTED CLOVIS WITH THE INFIDELITY OF HS BETROTHED. GHiOSTS are by no means the property of any particulai age, country, or family. They come and go where they like, when thiey like, and lhow they like-especially in Dreamland, where you may raise the devil himself without verging the most remotely on thie improbable. Tllis being conceded, we shall have little or no difficulty in furnishing Castle Bertrand with one of these aristocratic nuisances, without which the noble house could not pretend to that genteel station in society, so necessary to its awakening a proper respect in the reader's mind. If man has a, weakness, it is for high life; and how can we have higlh life without a ghost? In ancient times the sine qua non of gentility was a horrible destiny, such as .Eschylus and Sophocles love to portray; a sort of-shoving on to the shoulders of Fate all the rascalities done in the family. Now- a-days we are more modest, and are contented with a spectre or two, whose business is to tunmble up out of the grave whenever required, to the no small delight and interest of everybody except the person visited by the apparition. 1' <pb n="10-11" xml:id="VAC6560-00000014"/> 10       DREAMS W  rrH DmRE S. Talking of the person visited, reminds us of a couple of distinguished gentlemen, who are waiting for us in the hall of Bertrand Castle; for the Spectre of Bertrand (as it is common- ly called) has been seen again, and one of these gentlemen has seen it. The two are known by their Christian names of Peter and Samuel; their stations are menial but honorable: that of Peter being the same duty, although on a more limited scale, assigned to Hercules in the Augean stables; that of Samuel being the healthy occupation of cleaning boots and other arduous duties of the kind. ' Good gracious! you don't say so!" said Peter to Samuel. "I don't know," replied Samuel; "I can't say if I am on my head or my heels. These are my heels, I believe?" "They are," said Peter. "And this is my head, I suppose?" continued Samuel. "All you have got of one," remarked Peter, who was given to jocularity. "Head or heels," pursued Samuel, "I am in such a state, you might knock me over with a feather.  Everything is a-spinning round, as it does when a fellow is drunk-" "Which a fellow often is," remarked Peter, waggishly. "When I first came here," continued Samuel, darkly, "they told me I would see things as would make my hair stand on end; so I had it cut close, to prevent the terrible calamity. But it came for all that. I see a ghost." CJDid you, now?" asked Peter. "I did," said Samuel. "Bless my soul!" cried Peter. "I believe you," said Samuel. "It was I Bless my soul I' with a vengeance. I just thought my hour was, come. I crawled all over." "Crawled all over what?" asked Peter. "It was my flesh crawled, not my limbs," said Samuel; "I just thought my skin would come off. Have any of you sold yourselves to the devil?" "Not as I knows on," said Peter. "Then," said Samuel, " he is here on speculation: so look out for yourself, my boy, that's all." a Don't talk so awful," said Peter, trembling; " don't talk so awful, Samuel." "Awful I I believe you," said Samuel; "if you see what I see, you would be awful too. Here I stood, just so--"               DREAMS WITHN  DREAMS.        J "Was your mouth open that way?" inquired Peter, anxiously. "Just so," repeated Samuel; " and before ne, as it were behind yon--don't turn round so. There's nothing there-as it were belind you, there it was." "What?" asked Peter, under his breath. 4 A long, lean, white woman, pale as a lump of lard," said Samuel. "What was she a-doing?" ftskled Peter. "How should I know?" replied Samuel, indignantly, " do you think a fellow doesn't run away when he sees a ghost? You would yourself." "True," answered Peter, "I have heard of her. She lives in rather an unsettled condition." "Does she, now?" asked Samuel. "Ah! that she does," replied Peter, philosophically; " she must, for she is perpetially a-getting in and out of her grave, and haunting fellows. She must keep that pot a-biling, folks say, till the last Uphorn is dead (we, you know, are related to the Upllorns by the mother's side); and she never comes with- out a screw's loose." "Do tell! does she, now?" said Samuel, with his mouth open, and his eyes looking sideways vacantly. "Does she?" replied Peter; "does she? Of course slte does. Why shouldn't she, if she has a mind to? Hallo, Ga- briel!" he continued, as the steward entered, "Sam see a ghost " But Gabriel would not tarry to listen, bidding them rather hasten to their duties; the which, indeed, they had utterly for- gotten, while solacing themselves with conversation. Now, although we are a devout believer in ghosts, the spec- tre, in the present instance, unfortunately turned out to be a large wlfite turkey gobbler, concerning whch we shall have more to relate anon. But, as another instance added to the long list of fancy's victims, let us say that the rumor of an appa- rition being seen, having reached the ear of Clovis Bertranld, and cooperating with a slight nervous attack, produced one of those deceptive presentiments of evil, which all of us, mo'e or less, have experienced at one timne or another. It was in this mood, so favorable to his purpose, that Albert found his friend on the memorable evening. Clovis looked up, as his friend entered. "Welcome, old <pb n="12-13" xml:id="VAC6560-00000015"/> JLW       U"L./JfUfJl. J LO  1 VILAAIIAAII L/A .. i-XA1 fellow," he cried, "I have had a fit of despondency. Thought speeds busy in my brain to-night." "A goodly speed," remarked Albert, "'if it flies on the wings of joy. Whly not?  You are the son of a kind father, the heir of a noble estalte, and the accepted lover of the lady you love. Health, wealth, and Eros-by George! Clovis, you are to be envied." "And yet," said Clovis, moodily looking into the fire, "I cannot say I am perfectly contented. I cannot say I feel per- fectly happy. Pshaw! the bluedcvils are strong fellows, I suppose. Let us change the subject." "You feel dull," remarked Albert quietly, as he sat down and stretclhed out his legs before the hearth. "You are prey to idle imaginations. Rouse yourself, and you will overcome it. Resist it, and it will fly from you." "And how/a ould you set to work in my place?" asked Clovis.    I "I Before eve ything else," replied Albert, " study to know yourself, and beware of the impulse of the moment. Manl is a bundle of impulses--not Labits--and'his unhnppiness lies more in his laziness than he faGnies. We yield to every new senti- ment as if it were an in pilation. Are ve a little unwell? We are straight-wtay moody and miserable. Tush! Fight it , out. Beat back the bluedevils. Occupy yourself. Tmun head over heels a dozen times-wash your face--and take a drink. Study the art of self-govelrlnment. That is the way."'  " "And what would that comhe to?" asked Clovis, not a little amused at Albert's dry way of talking. "First," replied A llert, secretly overjoyed at the effect he 'Was producing, "first, you will spare yourself much, ennui. Then you will learn to smile at the proper time; to swear, pray, laugh, cry, eat, drink, fast, flatter, 'defy, applaud, and con- demn at the proper nioment. Learn to look at nulmber one as a nonpareil, the god of your idolatry, and the sull total of your destinv. I wan ant you, then, never to feel sad again.' Bored , you mriy be while dullards speak and time drags-but you will :never feel sad." "  Bosh!" cried Clovis, impatiently pushing a log ill the fire with his-foot; "you are alwavs advocating the salne Norldlv philosophy. I will have none of it. Marriage, old fellow, marriage shall be my panacea." ' Are you so sure?" replied Albert. "Marriage, at best,   DREAMS WITHN DREAMS.        13 is a problem. Look around you, and tell me again you are sure it will prove all you expect." "But Nora--" began Clovis. "No personal examples, if you please," said Albert. "Sup- pose you espoused a lady, to finld out afterward that her heart was not your own?" "Not so rare as you think," said Albert. "And suppose you had a friend who knew this beforehand, and never told you?  "You speak contradictions," replied Clovis;. "a friend would never be silent under suchl circunmstances." "You think not?" "I know not." M Looking Clovis fuill in the face, Albert first pointed to a portrait of Nora, which hung against the wall, and then to him- self. "I take you at your word," he said. "There is the lady, and lere the fiiend." Clovis turned pale. "W'hat does this all mean?" he said. ' You were shrewd a t solving riddles,-when a boy," replied Albert; "' is this enigma too difficult? Well, then, in a word, this very night Romanus and mys'elf saw Lady Nora, your be- trothed, in the arlms of a lover, whom she hlad clandestinely met in your fiathlerl' park.'. "Let me gather nly ideas together,"' said Clovis, petrified by the news. "You saw Nora in the arms of another?" "In the arms of another."' "Nora!" "Are you sure it was she?"  "As sure as that I am myself." "Great God!" "You are moved, Clovis." "More than you think; for I have soon to choose between two alternatives--the loss of my betrothed or my friend. If she denies it, you must prove it. If you prove it, she-" ' And if I cannot prove it?" "I will hold you responsible." Albert looked quietly at Clovis for a few minutes, and then said, calmly : "I can prove all I say. Otherwise I would not have said it. But you-will you be satisfied with the evi- dence?  I know not. I have done my duty at least. With me," he continued, more calmly, " friendship is eternal, living    <pb n="14-15" xml:id="VAC6560-00000016"/> "       DREAMS WITHN DREAMS. more sacred in unmerited exile than in honorable preferment. Allow me at least to finish what I have begun. I fear you enter upon the examination of this question (a question, Clovis, so irconceivably important to your future happiness) with a determination not to be convinced. Fearing this, I have confided the secret to my lord Clodolphus, whose honorable character. and good sense fit him to advise you on so im- portant a matter. But let me offer counsel. I have a right to do that. Beware of imposition, and, above all, of self-imposi- tion. Suppose me right and yet disbelieved. You repudiate evidence, court deception, and fall into the snare. Do you think it will end here? This is but the first act of the unhappy drama. When love becomes uxorious, it is fatally blind. By and by the deadly mine is sprung, and life, honor, happiness, all are shattered. Too much stung by madness to deliberate, too suddenly undeceived to act prudently, the husband, by his own violence, reveals the whole scandal to the public. Unable to look society in the face, possessing no hope of future remedy, and obliged to hide from the world, the unfortunate man is henceforth dead to all that renders life valuable. I warn you now to investigate this matter calmly. Take my advice, and you never will have cause to regret so doing; reject it, and I never will again urge you to do your duty." Could any person of the present century have seen Clovis, as he stood leaning on his arm, by the chimney, he would have beei, struck with his uncommon likeness to the unfortunate Charles Stuart. Kindly holding out his lhand to Albert, he dis- mis:ed the subject with these words: "No more, Albert. I believe you saw what you tell me. Nora has not acted wise- ly; but I pledge my life on her virtue. I cannot claim so many attractions (God help me!) as to believe myself justified in reproaching her for preferring another. It was a beautiful dream, and I have awakened. Perhaps I may be able to talk with you more hereafer; but not now-not now." "Can it be," said Albert to himself, "that the man i already tired of his fincy? But what matters it? All is cor. that comes to my mill. Tired or not tired, the affair is over, and her ladyship settled; and that is all I desire." -- But Albert, with all his cunning, overlooked (as, in fact, do all- the- cunning men I hleave had the misfortune to know) the fact that there is a straightforward way of acting which, in nine cases out of ten, baffles th- most wily opponent. Taking for granted that, since Nora had met a man, ergo Clovis would   DREAMS WITHN DREAMS.         15 abandon her, it never occurred to him that possibly his friend might have an explanation with the young lady, resulting quite contrary to his wish. And here it is that cunning differs from intellect; for the former seldom looks more than a move ahead in the game of life, while intelligence knows the need of study- ing all the combinations of. circumstances before it ventures to advance a piece. While the foregoing conversation was being held, a scene of quite another description was taking place in another part of the castle. The next scene, which is in the hall of the castle, opens a new view, and presents new characters, both human and animal. Nor is the introdcton of animals without classic pre. cedent. We all have heard pf the Coliseum, and the remark of the pilgrim, "Quanldiu stat't Colyseus," etc. nor have we for- gotten the bright suggestion of a son of John Bull, to convert that ruin into a railroad depot-for which, he remarked, judi- ciously, it was eminently calculated by its shape and size. But what was the amphitheatre of Titus, even though Calphurnius informs us it reached almost to the heavens (it was 43- yards high), to the great circle of the public, crazy to get at this illus- triousi triumph of the intellect? Let us then have our animals also. We shall not send to Nunidia for a supply of lions and leopards. Our vivarium shall not contain tigers or panthers. iBut tdignity is only comparative; and If our beasts have not the dignity ascribed to them by fable, tfhe shall at least have the more domestic attributes only produced in the farmyard. For Count Bertrand, a man of -a peculiar turn of mind, had taken it into his head to have all his poultry brought into the castle hall every night for the purpose of roosting. We are not prepared to assert that the admittance of this congregation met the approbation either of the countess or servants; but we can conscientiously declare that the domestics faithfully executed their part in driving them in, knowing by experience that the Count was never known to fail either in counting the feathered mob, or in making the devil's own row if the number were not exact. This night, a turkey gobbler, known under the title of Erasmus, was missing, much to the wrath of the noble Count. So it came to pass that my lord Clodolphus, after Albert had left him, and while that gentleman was engaged with Clovis, was startled in the midst of his meditations on the Hibernian origin of Patroclus, bly seeing the menials flying about wildly in every direction; when, inquiring into the cause of the tumult, he ascertained the reason, and was alarmed no more. Being by this ,*    <pb n="16-17" xml:id="VAC6560-00000017"/> 16       DREAMS WITHN DREAMS. time satisfied with his Patroclean hypothesis, he determined to turn his attention to Nora, to save her, if innocent, and to screen her, if guilty; with which purpose he turned his steps toward the castle. Meanwhile the servants flew round. There was no use coming in without the turkey gobbler. This they knew as well as they knew their catechism. Hearing the tumult, the Countess and Nora descended to the hall, where the worthy lord and master of Castle Bertrand, in a red-hot state of excitement, was storming at anybody and everybody. "What have they done?" he cried, anllswriig hs wife's alarmed inquiry, " what have they done, woman? What haven't they done? That's the way to put it. They have taken away my turkey gobbler. That's what they'v\e done. Tllat fowl was the favorite of my old age.  liThat fowl is not here. Where is it? Gone. Where?  No one knows. WhIy? Because no one cares, A turkey gobbler of my own laying and hatching is gone. That's what they've done. I will neither eat, driln n!or sleep, until Erasmus is forthcoming. I would not hesittce, with lmy own hands, to cut my own brother's throat, if I even suspected him of this abominable deed. I would not. I would cut it from ear to eai." "You would play the part of Virginius," said my lord Clo- dolphas, who had just entered. "Oh! you are there, are you?" replied the Count. "Iave you seen my Erasmus?  "Certainly," replied my lord Clodolpllus, promptly. "Where?" asked the Count, joyfully. "Up in the library," answered mly lord Clodolphus. "IThank you," cried the Count. " lere Peter, Gabriel, Samuel, you born idiots, run up to the library and fetch it down. And you, fellows," he continued, shaking his fist at the other servants, as the three scampered up stairs after the gobbler, " a pretty reckoning you'll have to make for having left the door open." In a moment the ambassadors returned without the turkey gobbler. "Where is it, you fool?." asked the Count of Peter. "'Ta'n't there," said Peter. "Why, I saw it there myself, only half an hour ago," re. marked my lord' Clodolphus. "Half an hour ago!" cried the Count, hotly. "Has it been there so long as that?" Has it?" said my lord Clodolphus. "Certainly it has."   DREAMS WITrrI  DREAMS.       17 "Oh, you wretch!" cried the Count, addressing Peter whereupon that faithful domestic, who never, -by any chancet entered the castle unless called, and whose business lay entirely in the stables, was very muclh perplexed; seeing that until now the thought had never entered into his head that the loss of the gobbler could, by lny possible or impossible contingency, ever 'be referred to himl. ,  resumed my lord Clodolj'lus, "I was examining it befbre I came down stairs this evening." "No!gT tlo matter, I hope," s aid the Count, anxiously. "Not much," quoth my lord Clodoiphius. "Its back was a little torn, and it was a; litle wormeaten, that's all." Tori and wormeaten!" cried the Count, terror stricken. " aond we m   I Wy, the thinig's infectious." N onsense! replied my lord 0loclolplnls. " I have had the lhing in my pocket I don't know how many tines, and Ji ltve cltaght nodling yett. "You've imad it in your pocket?" cried the Count, agtast. "Iloutptht were 'kS of your Ecu,^^ Iit my "Of course I hl've," 'r'eplied my lord Clodolplus.

Nor I," replied the Count; ' but there is something rather so in a man stuffing a turkey gobbler there. Who the devil is talking about books?" "And who the devil is talking about turkey gobblers?" retorted my lord Clodolphins.  "I am," said the Count. "I thouglht we were speaking of your Erasmus," quoth my lord Clodolphus. So we were," said the Count. "' And, pray, what has Erasmus to do with turkey gob. blers?" asked my lord Clodolphus. 'We call our gobbler Erasmus," explained the Countess. "h I  bg your pardon then, quoth my lord Clodolphus "I know notht, ... t. I       e h book."      o the gobbler. I tlought you meant a "'Tlere!

Come, you scoundrels, hunt for your lives!" And the servants, whp had hoped their search was over, began again, with renewed vigor. Now a turkey gobbler is not the sort of bird easily lost, both on account of its size and remarkable power of voice. Hence it was not long before the mystery was solved, seeing that the fowl was all the time in the castle, having found a door open, and pushed its way into one of the apartments. The conse- quence was that the Count, who had given strict orders to close all the doors, and who had left this one open himself, began again to storm at Peter for not having shut the same. To that troubled menial's rescue came the Lady Nora, who laid her fair hand on the Count's mouth, and drew him away; which she did the more easily, as that worthy peer had a dim consciousness that he might possibly be in the wrong. The company, therefore, proceeded to the great room, where they usually assembled. Casting a look at Nora, half compas- sionate, half sorrowful, the learned Clodolphus took a seat and drew out a pipe; a luxury which had comparatively recently been brought from America by Sir Walter Raleigh, and was already highly in favor in Dreamland. The Count, who was nc smoker, immediately attacked my lord Clodolplus on the habit; the which he declared to be ridiculous in the extreme, and tho conversion of the nose into a chimney-a- thing for which (he argued) it wasgcertainly never intended. Now it was the Count's wont to do what little boys style "pitching into " my lord Clodolphus, whenever he. had a chance; not because he had not the greatest respect for that gentleman's hoenor and learning, but because he (the Count) was very fond of excitement, and his philosophic guest was sure to furnish him with an occasion, provided ire could only set him talking. Besides this, the Count had a gr,;at ad- vantage in the rambling nature of Clodolphus's conversation; whereby he (the Count again) was not obliged to keep so strictly to the point, as is required in scholastic arguments, which left him ample means cf securing a good retreat when pressed too hardly in a discussion. Add to this that the Count invariably got into a passion and made up in noise for the want of sense, and the reader can easily see how a man of very little education can keep it up with one very much learned, if he only tries. In reply to the anti-tobacco observations of his friend, my ford Clodolphus, clearing his throat, made answer:   DREAMS WITHN DREAMS.        Al "Since the ladies have been so good" (here he bowed courteously) " as not only to permit but urge me to use my pipe in- their presence, I need not defend my conduct from the charge of ill breeding. But, on the matter of taste, to you, Count, I address myself. After reading carefully the thoughtful pages of Seneca, the honeyed chapters of Plato, the profound ideas of Aristotle, the mystical lucubrations of the Judao-Platonic Philo, the urbane remarks of Herodotus, the eloquent philosophy of Cicero, the teise sentences of Thucyd- ides and Tacitus, the interesting observations of Livy, Dio- dorus Siculus, and Plutarch, I should really like to add unto my stock of information by hearing your opinion of a nose. What was it made for?" "To smell with," replied the Count, laconically. "Ay '" pursued my lord Clodolphus; "a dog's nose can do that. You might have added sniffling and sneezing and snoring to the catalogue., But that does not answer my ques- tion. Now, about a nose-" "Oh! blow your nose!" cried the Count, impatiently. "It does not require it," replied my lord Clodolphus. "But let us continue, pray. Seneca has acquitted Epicurus of the false and slanderous charges put upon him by Aristotle; and establishes the fact, according to my judgment at least, that his su/imum bonum is not corporeal but spiritual comfort-albeit verily much may be spoken of the psychological and entological  hair-splittings seen in the discussions of the early Greek phi- losophers, as set forth in the Eleatic and Italic schools, the Pythagorean, and divers others. Now the true philosopher, regarding the senses as mere channels of mental gratification, improves those aqueducts of joy (or, as we can never be too correct, let us call them bonaducts, from two Latin words, to wit, bona, or good things, and ducere, to lead)--improves, I say, these bonaducts to the best of his ability." "Bosh!" cried the Count. "No bosh at all about it, my dear Bertrand," quoth my lord Clodolphus; "we cultivate the eye by divers arts, such as the magical perfections of painting, wherein perspective is duly esteemed, color carefully chosen, and all nature, from the birds of the air, the fish of the sea, animals, vegetables, minerals, and the human face divine, whether in landscapes, still life, pieces historical, allegorical, metaphorical, melancholical-" "Or diabolical," suggested the Count, with a grin. "Are," continued my lord Clodolphus, taking no notice of    <pb n="20-21" xml:id="VAC6560-00000019"/> 20       DREAMS WITHN DREAMS. the interruption, "are properly and delectably represented. The ear is improved by music, with all its hosts of semibreves, minims, crotchets, demicrotchets, quavers, shargl, flats-- "Gracious goodness!" puffed the Count. "Scales major and minor, andante, allegro, allegro modera- toe, pursued my lord Clodolphus, ruthlessly, "crescendo, soste- nluto, dimtinuendo, and sundry others." "Has he done at last!" cried the Count. "The touch," continued my lord Clodolphus, inexorably, L the touch is cultivated in various ways; by delicacy of apparel, by soft pillows, by easy chairs, and the like. The taste is min- istered unto by savory dishes, calculated to please the appetite; and by generous wines, alit liquors, herb drinks, and divers others. But the nose-tlhe nose, my dear Count-has hitherto been neglected; and we tobacco smokers have indeed, keeping verily to the mean between extremes, on tte principle (as saith the old adage) that a superabundance of pudding choketh a dog, we, I say, we tobacco smokers have so far advanced beyond tlhe age as to administer to the sumnmum bonumn of Epicurus by means of the proboscis." "Do not all these long words about bony ducks and the rest of the trash mean," said the Count, who was slow to learn, and singularly unmoved by the venerable sages of antiquity, "that you seek ghostly comfort by means of a filthy pipe? I nevler heard so much nonsense uttered by a respectable man before. Do you seriously mean to tell me that sucking in and snorting out that nasty stuff is going to benefit your spiritual con- dition?" And the Count, wlio fancied he had said something very witty, threw himself back in high gool hlumor in his large easy chair, and laughed boisterously, in wkich he was joined by the good-natured philosopher. "Alh i " quoth my lord Clodolphus, drawing a long sigh, and removing his right leg from the knee of his left one, for the more convenient purpose of placing his left leg on top of his right knee. "Ahl, Bertrand! a true word is often spoken in jest, and a fool sometimes tells the truth." '"Thankee," said the Count. 'h! you are welcome, I am sure," said my lord Clodol-. phlu. wVith loving kindness, "you are welcome. But, as I was about to observe, this suztmmum bonurn is seriously the divinity must of us worship, good Catholics as we imagine ourselves to be. Golconda and Visiapour, so famous for their diamonds   DREAMS WITHN DREAM.         21 (chiefly to be found, by the by, about Raolconda, Coulour, and Gandicotta), offer their jewels generally lying about loose in the narrow crevices of the rocks; out of which fissures they are picked by means-of long iron rods. Now, if we only took the same pains to pick. truth out of conversation, verily many gems would be found lying about loose somewhere. In sooth, the cul- tivation of the senses tends rather to destroy than increase the operations of grace. Holding the flesh in suljection has always been considered a sine qua non of heroic sanctity. What else drove Benedict alone to the desert mountains of Sublacum? What brought the seraph of Assisium to his retreat at Mount Alverno? What drove Johnlthe Baptist to the desert and the penitent of Magdala to a life of mortification? But what has all this to do with the subject? We were talking of the natu- ral. You bring in the supernatural. I maintained a philo- sophical opinion. You lug faith in by the head and shoulders. Right in what you say, you do not make me wrong in what I say. Ywiss to worship your nose would be wrong; but you may follow your nose, wipe it, blow it, ay! and cultivate it without endangering your fiith." The Count, whose conprel'ension was limited, and who was always puzzled on any subject if the discourse was only lengthy, had sat very still while the ollth- was holdi n g   for, iting  his turn to talk, and nol tlroublingl hs head in the least with paying attention to his Irienld's obserNvations; but simply passed the time preparing his own aIswer, and wishing the other would stop. Wlen my lord Clodolphus paused, the Count broke in with : "I don't believe a word you say." "W;hy, my dear," said the Countess, "you must not talk so, even in jest. And to a guest too! For shame!" Trhe Count looked at his wife a moment irresolutely, and then burst out: "Why," he cried, "how on earth is a respectable man to sit stijl when he is told you can't go to heaven without squirt- ing tobacco through your nose? Who ever heard of such a thing?" "  But I did not mean any such a thing," quoth my lord Clo- dolphus. "Oh, indeed!" replied the Count. "I ask your pardon then, for my stupidity; although I will take my oath you said so." "I wonder where Clovis is?" remarked Nora, to change the subject.    <pb n="22-23" xml:id="VAC6560-00000020"/> 22       DREAMS WITHN DREAMS. My lord Clodolphus watched the young girl narrowly. No. She seemed purity itself. "If I understand women," he said to himself, " that young lady is innocent of wrong. I will try her, however." Raising his voice, he then turned to the Count, and said: "When, you missed that turkey, Bertrand, I fancied there was something in the wind; for I saw the figure of a man, a little before, stealing out of your park." As he said this, Nora flushed greatly. "I was mistaken," th9ught my lord Clodolphus. "A man marauding about my premises at night!" cried the Count, excited in an instant. "He has come after the hens. I knew it. I always said so. I did. I always said that these pirates had their evil eyes on my farmyard. But my wife would never believe me. There! You hear my lord Clodol- phus, Countess Bertrand. You hear him. He saw it. Oh! I am glad to prove right; and with so good a witness. But the desperado shall not escape. Perish the thought. If ever I had a foreboding, I have one that I shall have the satisfaction of shooting the reprobate. And my hens, too! Cannot he go and steal his own hens? I never trouble his poultry." While the Count thus continued vehemently inveighing against poachers and their like, and having matters all his own way, my lord Clodolphus rose, seated himself by Nora, and found occasion to say: "My child, trust me. I am old enough to be your father. If you need assistance, come to me. Verily I may aid you. You are young, and unaware of what you are doing. Remember, if walls have ears, trees and foun- tains hear sometimes." To this Nora listened attentively and tremblingly, neither replying nor trying to reply. With a delicacy which only those who knew him ever dreamed he possessed, my lord Clo- dolphus proceeded to turn the Count's attention away from the young girl by the very easy process of working that gentleman up into an excitement. This was speedily and thoroughly accomplished by a single remark to the effect that poachers, according to his (Clodolphus's) view, were justified by the neces- sities of the case. "Justified!" cried the Count. "So you justify stealing, do you? Much good Julius Caesar and the rest of the old chaps have done your morality. A nice preacher you'd make. Jus- tified I What do they want to steal hens for?" "To eat them, I fancy," quoth my lord Clodolphus.   DMEA-.rS WTTRIN DREaJUS.       23 "T o eat them" hOtlyreplied the Count. "Wy sould they want to eat my hens? Wy don't they eat their own?" They probabl, want their own to lay eggs," remarked my lord Clodolphus. "Well! I want my hens to lay eggs for me," said the Count, and  am not going to have them  justify t heir felony on any such course of defence." Tle evening passed away thus quietly.

As the Count had roused his wife from a sound sleep for the purpose of giving her this piece of information, by the ingenious process of slhng her until she answered; and as the infmation, even if true, was scarcely of enoulgh impor. tance to warrant the act, the Countess was exceeding wroth and took her spouse roundly to task; in the middle of which curtain lecture she discovered that amiable man was fast asleep, having forgotten to divest himself of half his clothing, before retiring. CHAPTER III.

"This is really too bad," growled tflCount. But my lord Clodolphlus still contcll uoed to give mouth. "I need hardly speak of fthe 'Roman heroes: such as killg Tullis Hostilius and his three goodly t nights, the illustriousl Horatii ; or of that other Horatius, ycleped Cocle-, who distin- guisled hmsclf when Lars Poirsna, king of ClhsiIlIm, took pos- session of the Janiculum and attacked the Sublician bridge ; or of suclh heroes as Caius Mucillus, Ci0ncinnatlus, Furius CamGiilIus, Tituts Macloinu, Quintus Fabius, Fabricius the incorruptible anid undaunted, Regulus, Duilius, Claudius Marcellus, Tiberiu s Sene - pronius Gracehus, Publius Cornelius Scipio Afiricanus, and tile rest of them." "Please somebody chuck a cork down that man's throat," cried the Count. Nobody casting the missile, my lord Clodol- phus continued. "War," saith be hath likewise been verily beloved in modern times.

We read of Peter du Bois, Francis Atre. men, Peter le Nuitre (or l'H-uitre, I forget which), and divers other captains, who surprised Oudenard in the night; whereby the captors did gain great riches of corn, and of wine likewise. Whereas this young gentleman hath also surprised us in the night; gaining, thereby, delectable viands and generous wine. You see, a soldier's life, albeit perilous, hath its dulcet side. Go, then, my young friend, to war. I will stay at home and celebrate your deeds in a ballad." "And sing it too, I suppose," remarked the Count. "Verily, even would I do so," replied my lord Clodolphus; "but I have not what hypercritics would call a fine voice. In sooth, I have occasionally attempted dulcet strains when others were by, and have been as often requested not to do it; some- times courteously, sometimes with divers execrations, according to the urbanity or churlishness of my audience: albeit, I have been often applauded for my exactness in imitating the peculiar sounds emanating from cats, when they solace themselves with conversation on the housetops. Now-" "Look here, Clodolphus," here broke in the Count, leaning on the table, and addressing that gentleman the more solemnly by keeping time to his own remarks, by gravely waving a spoon up and down. "Look here, Clodolphus, not to interrupt you, but to come to the point with the least possible waste of breath (a thing you don't seem to value much), and in the quick- est possible time, don't you think you have talked enough? Don't you? I ask it as a friend. By George, sir! if those execrable pagans are immortal, as you say, all I can say is, I wish the whole set of them had never been born. To hear you jabber about them is enough to set a man's teeth on edge. Excuse me for interrupting you. Go on now as soon as you like." "Upon my word," replied my lord Clodolphus, reddening, it is not likely I will proceed after such remarks as those. No, sir. I will not pursue the subject." ; Now you are angry," said the Count, blandly, holding theo spoon meanwhile by the handle, just as if he were taking aim at my lord Clodolphus's eye; now you are angry. I knew you would be." "Then why the devil, man," asked my lord Clodolphus, 2    <pb n="26-27" xml:id="VAC6560-00000022"/> testily, "couldn'tf you keep quiet, and not say precisely what you knew would have that effect? For the sake of goodness, Bertrand, do put that spoon down. It makes me nervous.  "Very well," said the Count, laying down the spoon, "I object to nothing in reason, mind; but when it comes to Julius  Cesar, I must have my say." "Indeed, 1 cannot agree with you, remarked the young office. "By these general remarks we help each other in brushing up what education we received at school. A soldier's accoutrements should be always in order, and it is the same with the scholar's accomplishments." "Bravo!" cried Alb ert, "I am not a scholar myself, but I have a wonderful respect for it in others. Philosophers are marvellous fellows. It is true no two of them agree; but that in itself is so extremely refreshing, since we have a glimpse by that of ho, very expansive is the soul, which cal take more shapes we can find names to call them by." "All very well, I dare say," said the Count, obstinately, "but I adhere, nevertheless, to my first opinion, and will not be convinced of error." "Admirably put," replied Albert, laughing, "and remind- ing me of Jupiter." Here, the young man repeated the lines of Homer, which we give according to Pope's translation: "League all your forces then, ye powers above, Join tal and try th' omni o ce of Jove: Let down our 4olden, evasli g chain, Whose strong embrace holds garth, and heaven, and main: Strive all, of mortal and immortal birth, To drag by this the Thunderer down to earth-- Ye strive in vain-" "W ell said, Albert, my boy," said the Count, kindly. "By the by, here is a letter I wish you to deliver in Treviot. Read it, arld see how you like it." Albert, obeying, found nothing but an order on a banker in his own name for a considerable SUmli. His eyes grew dim as he received this additional proof of the Count's kindness and generosity. "How  can I ever thank you sufficiently?" he said. a By becoming a good man like my old friend, your father," replied the Count, benevolently. "Tush manl don't be so affected. You have been a true friend to boy, ad gold cannot repay that." Albert colored deeply.   1J5lP A"M W lItl'JlN i JL)lAt;Mt Verily we shall have war," said my lord Clodolphus at that moment. "Hush, pray," whispered the Count. "Old Folio is tuning up. Hush, pray." Reader, have you ever seen a dog cock up his ears and make ready for a fight whenever he sees a stranger of his own breed coming up the road? Such was the Count's mental con- dition, whenever my lord Clodolphus spoke. But, frustrated in the humane intention of opposing that philosopher, on whatever side he placed himself (the Count was not particular which), by his intended antagonist pausing in his talk to drink with one of the company, the lord 'of Bertrand forthwith plunged headlong into the conversation, which was about the insurrection, with that happy knack of saying the first thing that came into his head, which was one of that nobleman's most striking charac- teristics. He began by declaring that, if he were a king, he would give no cause for revolution, but that, if there were no cause, and malcontents tried the experiment of stirring up a rebellion, he would soon settle the matter. The shortest way, he argued, to put an end to the present trouble at Treviot, was to accord a general permission to sack the towh; whereupon, he de- clared, both sides, rebels and loyalists, would unite in excellent fellowship, and so finish up the matter at once. These remarks had, of course, the effect of rousing my lord Clodolphus; who replied by voluminously quoting divers writers and acts, which did not seem to say anything very much to the point at issue: such as Tacitus de Moribus Germanorum, the Annals of Fulde, Gregory of Tours, Eusebius, Timothy of Alexandria, and the Canons of the second ecumenical Council of Lateran. To this the Count replied by sundry impatient ejaculati ls, such as Pish I " and "Pooh, pooh!" which defined his otion per- haps better than they convinced his antagonist.  "I will tell you what," said the Count, secretly delightq to be at my lord Clodolphus, "I will tell you what. If my itches, I scratch it. If my tooth aches, I have the fang hauled  out. Let me catch my head itching or my tooth aching, and I will- know the reason why. Let it be inscribed on my tomb- stone: 'For every itch he had a scratch. and for every ache a remedy,' and I will blithely go down into my grave-when I am dead. Very well. So far so good. You would scratch your head, I believe?" "I would," quoth my lord Clodolphus.    <pb n="28-29" xml:id="VAC6560-00000023"/> Cc And you would have a tooth out?" pursued the Count. it Distinguo," replied my lord Clodolphus; " if I could not cure it otherwise--concedo; if I could, nego. "I don't care a snap for your Latin," answered the Count; "would you have the grinder out, or would you not?" "Let us say yes, then," quoth my lord Clodolphus, some. "Very well, then," continued the Count., argumentatively, "here we are at the root of the matter." "Do you mean the root of the tooth?" asked my lord Clo- dolphus.,In)  It The root of the tooth?" replied the Count, impatiently, "the root of a broomstick i What do you mean by talking such nonsense?"  "e I meant it facetiously," remarked my lord Clodolphus. I Oh! you did, did you? )" answered the Count. "Well, keep your jocularity for a more fitting occasion, and don't be frolicsome when I am making solemn  observations, if you please. Wherewas I?  Oh,yes! If I was a monarch, and there was a rebellion, I would pull a tooth out of the head of every man Jack among them; and, if that would not do, I would pull out another." The young officer, at this point of the argument, suggested that the rebels were first to be caught. "Caught?" replied the Count; "pooh, pooh! That has nothing to do at all with the mnatter. I11 am talking of pulling out their teeth. And so I certainly would. I would. First I would be mild. I would say' 'M My friends, are you fond of your chewing utensils?' Of course they world answer' 'Yes, your majesty.' Then I would reply: ' Then you keep mighty still, or y6u may happen to find yourselves minus a fang before you are aware. So go home. Keep your tusks. And be happy." At these words the young officer laughed very much, and said the idea had at least the merit of originali ety: whereat the Count received the assurance complacently, and r emarked he was sure of it; whereat Albert observed that it was too good a notion to pine in obscurity; whereat the Count chuckled; whereat my lord Clodolphus remarked that it only wanted com- mon sense to be worth. listening to; whereat the-Count grew exceeding wroth, and a new discussion was on the eve of arising between these worthy men, when the young officeer smoothed matters over by declaring that, if ever his majesty called him into the privy council, he would suggest the plan. At this the   Count's equanimity was restored, and he assured the young officer that he was quite welcome to the idea, and that he (the officer) need not say he (the Count) originated the idea; but might take all the credit to himself, as the thing might insure his promotion. Whereat both Albert and the young officer laughed more than ever. Now, in order the more graphically to furnish the reader with all that occurred, let us follow Albert, who is rising from the table to bid his last adieu to Clovis, and leave our other friends for the present to the quiet enjoyment of their midnight banquet. Provoked, biting his lips in his vexation, and much troubled act this sudden sunnmmons, which threatened to interfere with his plans, Albert ascended the stairs to see the last of his friend. On the Iway he met the faithful Peter, who had been paying one of his fellow servants a visit on the sly, where he had been regaled with spirituous liquor at the Count's expense. Now Peter, as the reader may have already remarked, was a gentle- man not overburdenea with brains. Deeming a spy would not be a bad thing to have, the idea struck Albert that lie might terrify Peter into submission; especially as he saw at once, by the sneaking expression of that gentleman's lineaments, that he had betn doing something he had no business to do. Albert therefore seized him by the collar and pushed him against the wall, exlaiming, sternly: " Tell me, you scoundrel, what you have been doing; or I will at once lead you to your master by the lobe of the ear." "I am sure, sir," cried the ill-fated Peter, shrinking down, so that his head shrank into his body, like a turtle, " I am sure, sir, I would not deceive your honor for the world." "You had better not," said Albert authoritatively. "-Now tell me, were you not up stairs ? " This Albert uttered boldly and with a searching glance, intended to impress his victim with a terrible idea of his sagacity; although it scarcely could be said to prove that, since it does not require an uncommon degree of penetra- tion to know a person has been up stairs when you meet him coming down. Nevertheless Albert's manner had that effect. Peter gasped out a terrified acquiescence, and evidently took Albert's knowledge for something supernatural. Albert folded his arms and looked down upon Peter sternly, taking care to stand upon a higher step, so as to impress his victim with a physical as well as a moral sense of the colossal.  <pb n="30-31" xml:id="VAC6560-00000024"/> Peter turned up his eyes at Albert and looked so ludicrously scared that the other smiled in spite of himself. There ! you will do    ," said he. Do you wish to be skinned ?" Peter murmured his objection to being peeled. "Then mark me," said Albert shaking his forefinger at him, " don't you dare disobey me. Keep a watch over all that you see, and be ready to cone to me whenever I send for you, and faithfully to do whatever I order you. Obey me, and   I ill keep your act of to-night secret. Disobey me, and I will have you broken on the wheel." " Lord ! " groaned Peter. "Hung," continued Albert, perceiving the effect of his threats. '0 No, no." " Drawn and quartered." "Dear, dear."' " Racked and beheaded." Peter shuddered. And   after that you shall first beburied alive and then ord       lo, sir," gasped Peter. "lease don't. I will do all you tell nme. I never see such threats. Yes, I will." ', Silence, you baboon I " cried Albert sternly.  " My God I what is that ? " As he said this both saw a formless white thing, impalpable as the air, sweep slowly by; without shape, without substance, shadowy, horrible. Peter fell~on his knees, while Albert, over- come by terror for the first time in-his life, sank down oil the steps and covered his face with his handsq. When the first awful senoations had subsided, Albert uncovered his face, which ~s dea y pale, and said: t this was frilghtful. Qan such things be ?  "Depend upon it," said Peter, his teeth chattering in his head, "it was the devil, sir." " But, Peter," askd Albert, " do.these things often happen in the castle ? " . "Yes, your honor," replied the other, "more often than agreeable. Sometimes we see shirts, and think 'em ghosts. Sometimes we see ghosts, and think 'emr shirts. Sometimes-" " Strange," muttered Albert to himself, " I seemed to know what it was, and yet not know. I felt as I have done in   dreams sometimes; as if I were falling, falling down an un- fathomable abyss; and then I started and awoke." "I should think you did," said Peter. "You skipped as if you had sat down on a pin. Lord! if a hornet had a-stung you, you couldn't have hopped quicker." "And," continued Albert, still muttering to himself and unconscious of Peter's remarks, "and I seemed to see the face of a little child, peering out of that white cloud, mocking me as I fell down the pit, at the bottom of which was unutterable horror waiting for me. Oh I "-here he shuddered. "I think you had better have a drink of gin, sir," said the wily Peter, who wanted one himself. At this Albert recovered his presence of mind, and respoiid- ed to Peter by aiming a ferocious blow at his nose. But Albert had miscalculated his distance, and before he could repeat the blow, Peter had fled down stairs with the speed of lightning. And now Albert really presented a grand sight. His will struggled manfully with fear. Reason came to his aid and wrestled with superstition. He took out his handkerchief and wiped the cold sweat which had gathered on his forehead. "If we had not both seen it," said he, " if it had appeared only to me, I could dismiss the illusion without a thought. But what are these mysterious substances which come we kno-v not whence, and go we know not whither?  What dreadful exhalations are these which sail through space, and cast the chilling influence of death over whomsoever they encounter? What is their substance, purpose, use in the economy of nature? By heavens! I will not yield to them. He who gave me a soul taught me to overcome terror, and I will do it." He mused a moment, and then burst into a hysteric laugh. "Ah " he cried, "shall it be said a vapor prostrated nle. to the level of that miserable specimen of mortality, the wise. Peter? It has passed and I am unharmed. Let it pass, thel, for' what it is worth. I will have no more of it." Uttering imprecations upon himself for his folly, Albert then rose with some difficulty, and slowly proceeded on his way; now and then involuntarily looking over his shoulder, as if he half expected to see the thing again. Nothing transpiring, however, he gradually recovered his presence of mind, and, by the time he reached the door of Clovis's apartment, even began to laugh at his own fears. --,: . .                    I      <pb n="32-33" xml:id="VAC6560-00000025"/> D. J ffl/.,L ; NVal . -L :-  The parting was short. Clovis was half dressed and wait ing for him. Albert extended his hand and said: "Clovis, let us converse for a few moments, before we part, on a subject painful enough, I confess, but one which I only revive because we are to part so soon-and for so uncertain a length of. time. Remember, I beg you, your high station. When you go abroad, recollect your opportunities, and try as much as you can not to harp on the past." "tYou are right in a measure," replied Clovis. a Let us never more recall the past. To tell the truth, it is better for both of us that we part awhile, for your conversation shocks me, and, if I should hear you lo ng, you would only double my sorrows. Our best friends-and I say this, dear old fellow, kindly-can- not always understand us; and there are secret places where only he who has loved can enter. You, who never loved a woman, are unqualified to enter the Holy of Holies, but must remain without in the court of the Gentiles." A"Indeed," replied Albert, "r now this is a pretty farewell. Ita is pleasant to have a surly, thankless friend like yourself. Because I cannot look upon a   woman as anything but a woman, and have not the imagination to idealize her into an angel;, because I cannot look upon a lover as anything but a lover, and have the honesty to avow frankly an opinion which all the world knows to be true, to wit: that love is transien, fickle, and more easily consoled in disappointment than satisfied in possession; because I cannot look upon your case as ulncome. Mon, your love as unchangeable, your lady as peerless, or your grief as inconsolable; now, therefore, I must forthw ith be dis- missed as obnoxious. Well, old felow, let it be so now. By and by you will come to your senses. I ought not to and will not be provoked, for I cannot regard you as knowing now either what you are saying or doing. Let us part, therefore, but we need not part coldly, old friend." And here Albert stretched out his hand cheerily, for, with all his selfishness, the man was really attached to young Ber, trand in his own way. Clovis shook it warmly and said: "But can you not enter a little into the spirit of my troubles? Even if you think them ideal, mutable, and shadowy are opti cal illusions less terrible if we know them not as'such?" "Ay " replied Albert, " but we may know them as such if we only choose. I had one to-night. It overcame me at first, because I am flesh and blood; but it affects me no longer,   because I hold and practise the idea that spirit must govern flesh and blood. This is precisely what I. quarrel with in your case. Hold your head up, man, and you will find the water of affliction won't drown you. It is confounded shallow, I assure you. Your illusion is manifest, yet you refuse to hear even that it is one. You actually revel in sorrow. What an enjoy- ment! Thank heaven I am not married! But come! I must be stirring. Good Clovis! let no folly lead you. That is my last, my very last recommendation. A short time, and I will visit you again; meanwhile keep up your courage, be philo- sophical, show yourself a man in the true sense of the word. And now, good-by. Think of me kindly, old fellow. I am sure you owe me no grudge." And so they parted, to meet no more as friends. Better for one of them at least, had they never met again. On descending the stairs, Albert heard a noise below which sounded rather uproarious. Voices in exceeding great rage, the one speaking in divers tongues, and the other pouring forth vollies of indignation, made the very rafters of the castle shake. The cause of all this hubbub originated in the peculiar disposi- tion of the Count and my lord Clodolphus when those gentle- men were under the influence of Bacchus. My lord Clodol- phus, a good-natured man in the main, was wont to grow dog- matic in his cups; while the Count, under like circumstances, would wax exceeding obstreperous, and, being a man not over particular in the choice of his expressions, the twain generally managed at such times to come to loggerheads; when there was actually no staying in the house with them. In these festive disputes, so to call them, for there was more bark than bite in the wars between the Count and the philosopher, my lord Clodolphus would seem to invent quite a new language, as quotation after quotation poured forth from his sapient lips. On the other hand, as the Count's general view of learning was condensed in the opinion that "the brain became soft in pro- portion as it was squeezed; " as, moreover, this learned opinion labored under the slight disadvantage of being rather obscure, and consequently the better calculated to be understood as more aggravating and offensive than it really was intended to be; and, finally, as the Count, when exhilarated by the bacchanalian influence, would utter this apothegm in his most obstinate and irritating way, it generally had the effect of exasperating my lord Clodolphus prodigiously. Whereupon that gentleman would more than imply that the Count would be decidedly im-     <pb n="34-35" xml:id="VAC6560-00000026"/> 34.      DREAMS WITHN DREAMS. proved by a little common sense; which remark usually led to a row, as in the present instance. The way the trouble began this night, or rather morning, Was by the Count's innocently remarking that something was as true as that the moon was made of green cheese. This idea my lord Clodolphus lustily combated, and indeed not without some show of reason, since modern astronomy, even with all her stupendous discoveries, has not succeeded in proving that our  satellite is composed of the alleged material. Hereupon my lord Clodolphus, now in his perfect element, launched forth with great vigor; commencing with the Chaldeans, touching upon the school of Alexandria, quoting Aristarchus of Samos, Era- tosthenes, Aboul-Wefa, and Tycho Brahe; and was just about introducing Kepler and Copernicus, and giving his own opinion on the origin of tides, when he was interrupted by the impatient Count. "By George, sir!" cried that noble, " you are enough to drive a man crazy. If I had my way, the best use I could put you to, would be to confine you in a cell of one of our Cister- cian monasteries, keeping you fed on a diet of roots, and using you as a penance. Whenever any monk sinned, I would hlave his director assign him as penance one hour in the society of nlmlord Clodolphus-two hours-three hours-just as the case migllt be. Then at least you might be useful as a volun- tary mortification to others, instead of being an involuntary mortification to your friends and relations." Tliis odd notion set everybody laughing, even my lord Clodolpllus himself. Whereupon the Count remarked that he had a right to talk, that lie would say the moon was made of green cheese, and that, moreover, lie would like to see the man who would try to stop hilm. But my lord Clodolphus was not to be browheaten. He took a casual view of the Count's position on the liberty of speecl, remarking that he (the Count) was, of course, entitled to express his opinion; but that nonsense was nonsense, who- ever uttered it. "Astronomy," he continued, "was first discovered by Chain, though where he got his ideas from, nobody knows. It has been diligently pursued ever since, and has lately been re- garded by many as unworthy of respect; and this may be par- tially attributed to such ideas as the one you, Bertrand, have just now annunced. Such verily also is the absurd idea of believing the .ience of the stars leads to the reading of future   35 DREAMS WITRIN DRT2          o events; the folly of which was well illustrated by the witty re- ply of a lady, who consulted one of those vendors of prophecy under false pretence. The soothsayer gabbled some meaning. less sounds, and then held out his hand for money. .She gave him fifteen sous. After carefully asking her the year, month, day, hour, minute, and second of her birth, he drew her horo- scope, began to utter'some more unintelligible sounds, and said 'Madam, I find from the stars, that you have lost some money.' 'I have indeed,' replied the lady, laughing, 'just fifteen so' now in your pocket.' You may de pend upon it," concluded my lord Clodolphus, " that astronomy is like a pretty woman badly dressed-it has a great deal of trumpery hangig round it." The Count, who was a devout believer in anything ap- proaching the black art, replieq that if one man could tell a story, another (meaning himself) might be found to tell another of quite a different color. In order to establish the truth of astrological predictions, he related how a certain citizen of Lyons, having been told the exact hour of his death, divided his wealth into a number of portions corresponding with the nuima- ber of years it had been foretold he should live. The man did' not die at the moment predicted, but lived poor in his old age. "If," concluded the Count, "if that is not martyrdom, I should like to know what is?" This extraordinary proof of the supernatural craft of sooth- saying did not convince my lord Clodolphus, who endeavored to show that, so far from testifying to the accuracy of these pre. dictions, the fact narrated only went to prove the contrary. Whereat the Count replied that none were so blind as those that would not see, and more than hinted his opinion that my lord Clodolphus was drunk.              y Now this is not precisely a remark calculated to please a man. Consequently the tocsin was sounded and war ensued. Tile storm was at its height when Albert entered. His pres- ence dififsed peace, since the Count then remembered he was a host, and my lord Clodolphus was desirous of standing well in the young man's eyes as a true philosopher; that gentleman having been greatly flattered by Albert's compliments in thle park. Peace, therefore, having been proclaimed, hands hakenl, and harmony regained, the young officer and Albert rose to depart. All descended to the courtyard, where the lorses were waiting. The day was breaking in the east (why do authors always say that? Did the day ever break in the west '), and bade fair to be fine. So, after a last hearty fare-    <pb n="36-37" xml:id="VAC6560-00000027"/> 36       DREAMS 1WITHN LREAMS. well, the young men trotted off toward Treviot; feeling that elasticity of body and mind which only youth knows when straddling a noble horse at that early hour. CHAPTER IV. HOW A COMPANY MET TOGETHER IN THE VILLAGE INN. IN the village of Bertrand there was, of course, an inn, sacred to the good entertainment of man and beast. The land- lord was one Ernest Toservem, a gentleman possessed of all the qualifications necessary to the proper presiding over this central point of village life. Nor need the gentle reader sneer at our jealous care of Ernest's reputation; for it would argue very little knowledge of the world to suppose an innkeeper's position not to be one of extraordinary difficulty and responsibility. Lodging people alone requires superhuman wisdom, if you wish to satisfy everybody. If you add boarding to the list, the com- plication of arduous duties becomes frightful. But if to these be added the cares, the anxieties, and the accountabilities of the tap, the terrible magnitude of the position vividly stares us in the face. Ernest Toservem, therefore, and his good wife, Dame Toser- vem, and his amiable children, the Misses and Masters Toser. vem, were supported lawfully and honestly by boarding and lodging whatever gentleman or lady shodld require shelter for the night and good entertainment for man and beast. Around the fire of the public room would gather sundry cronies and talk over the events of the day, according to the custom of villagers time out of mind. On the very night when Albert and Romanus saw Nora in the park, there was assembled round the fire in Toservenl's tavern quite a little circle of cronies. The fire leaped, and danced, and shone so brightly that, by common consent, no light was brought in; for everybody knows that the genial rays of a glowing fire are far more conducive to comfort and conversa- tion than the cold, steady flame of any lamp or candle ever invented. "You have travelled a long way, now, I expect, sir?" said Samson Shuttle, the weaver, to a stranger who was sitting    DREAMS WITHN DREAMS.        3T cosily in the chimney corner. Samson was a small, thin man; whose body would have looked as if it had shrunk, only it pre- sented no reliable evidence of ever having been washed. The gentleman he addressed seemed a jovial fellow, with laughing eyes, but whose lower face was hidden by a very dirty bandage. "You have travelled a long way, now, I expect, sir?" said Samson Shuttle, the weaver. "So I have, friend," assented the man with the very dirty bandage; "I have come from far beyond Rochateau to-night." Indeed?" said the weaver; ", I do not like long walks myself. I prefer setting-or laying," he added, after a mo- ment's consideration. Solomon Coffin, the sexton, a little man with a huge wig and large boots, whose face was wrinkled all over like a frozen apple, was hereat heard to growl " lying." Who is lying?" asked the weaver, gruffly. "Nobody, as I knows on," quoth the sexton. "Then what are you talking about?" asked the weaver, ferociously. Said the sexton: "You hadn't ought to say laying." "And what ought I to say, then?" asked the weaver loftily. "You ought," rejoined Coffin, in a sepulchral tone, "you ought to say lying, Samson Shuttle. You can't lay, Samson, and don't tell me you can. Only birds lay." "I don't know that," said the weaver, defiantly. "If you can, then," remarked the sexton, "all I can say is I never see your eggs." And Solomon Coffin laughed bitterly. Hereupon a dispute arose, which extended to all the circle some of the company asserting that a man could lay, and others declaring a man could not lay. The gentleman with the very dirty bandage concluded the debate by observing that a hen lies when sle lays, and sits when she sets; whereat the rest looked prof6und, as if that was the point and no mistake; al- though in their hearts they were in no little perplexity as to what the stranger meant, regarding him as a man of prodigious learning and great power of expression. Well, Coffin," said Ernest, " and so you have come back to us? I hope you enjoyed your journey'? You found them all well at home, at any rate." "Well " echoed Coffin, squinting. (For reasons unex. plained, Solomon was never seen abroad without a piece of court plaster stuck on the end of his nose; in effoirts to look at    <pb n="38-39" xml:id="VAC6560-00000028"/> 38       DREAMS WITHN DREAMS. which he was wont to turn his eyes to an oblique position.) "Well  Of course they were. The children was as well as turnips." "Al!" said the man with the very dirty bandage, "it's a great thing to have children." "Just so," assented Solomon. "Don't I think of that, though? Don't I console myself with thinking how soon they will come to an age when I can whop them? And, my eye I won't they catch it when they do?" "I did not mean that," said the gentleman with the very dirty bandage. Ah! but I did," continued the sexton, putting his hands in his pockets, as he leaned back on his chair's hind legs. All! I but I did. I guess there will be considerable flying about by and by, when I put my finger in the nursery pie." "Your wife was glad to see you back?" said Ernest. "Of course she was," replied Coffin. "Women are all fools. There she was snivelling and boo-hooing when I re- turned, enough to try the patience of a saint. And yet that woman has a heart!" With this unexpected conclusion, Solomon looked at his nose to see if the court plaster was safe. Finding it was, he glared malevolently at the company; an habitual expression of the worthy sexton, and one not to be accounted for by natural causes; for there was not a kinder or warmer-hearted man in Bertrand. Suddenly he burst out again malignantly. "And darn me," said he, " if those fools of children were not glad too, the idiots." "What about?" asked Peter Cutter, the barber, a lean, tall gentleman, with a pair of long legs loosely attached to a small body. "Wlhy, to see me-just as if I was a crocodile or a hippo- potamus," replied Solomon. ' I do not quite understand," said Peter Cutter. I mean a wild beast," replied Coffin, "a wild tiger in a cage. That's what I mean. The young wipers were crawling all over me, like bugs; some on my neck, some in my arms, and some round my legs. And yet I could stand there, and not thrash their skins off!" "Not quite that, I hope," said the man with the very dirty bandage. "No, I didn't," continued Coffin, gruffly. "It kind of goes   DRIEAMS WITHN DREAMS.        39 against the grain to lick a child only because he is fond of "And why did you go to Villaburg at all?" inquired Er. nest. Solomon looked wrathful. "Oh!" quoth he, "oh  but 1 was a fool to go and be charitable, as I did once. I went and helped a hunchback, who was in trouble. A week ago he came to me. 'Coffin,' says he, 'do you love your cousins?' 'I don't know but I do,' says 1. 'Well, then, says he, 'mind what I say. You go to Villaburg immediate.' 'And what for?' says I; "why should I go to Villaburg any more' than to Jericho?' ' Be- cause I will be there, says he. ' A mighty good reason for making a fifty-mile journey,' says I. 'But do,' says he. 'Get out!' says I, 'I won't do any such a thing. Cool, that! Tell a fellow to go fifty miles to see' somebody he can see every day at home.' 'That a'n't it,' says lhe; 'I will meet you there, andi  give you my reasons why I asked you to go.' 'And why can't you spit them out at once and have done with it? ' says I. 'Because it won't do,' says he; 'maybe I -won't have anything to tell you after all when you get there.' 'You're a pretty fellow,' says I, 'to go and ask a man to make such a tramp for nothing.' 'No! no ' says he, quite earnestly. 'If I tell you nothing is the matter, you will be more glad than if I have something to tell you.' " "And did you go?" asked Peter Cutter. Wait a minute," replied the sexton. "Go! of course I went. Oh! but if ever there was a fool under the blessed sun, I'm the fool." And Solomon glared malevolently at the piece of court plaster, as if he were now determined to squint it off his nose or perish in the attemp. "Ah!" he continued, 'I went, and met the hunchback there. lie looked as crestfallen as a wet rooster. 'Solomon,' says he, we are in a mess.'

'It's a hoax,' says he, 'and me and you are made fools of.' Go on, says I, for all my rage; 'go on. Let's see now whether we can't get out of the scrape.' Well, with that he shows me a letter he got without the name of the writer-a what-do-you-call-it letter." "Do you mean anonymous?

"Well, the letter says that the man was to bring me to Villaburg without my knowing why, because one of my cousins was going to disgrace the family. Hunchy, whbn he reached Villaburg, went to my uncle and showed him the letter, when the old fellow burst out laughing like the devil. 'You don't mean to say,' says my uncle, 'that you and Solomon have come all this way on a wild-goose chase? Why, Bill,' (that's my cousin, you understand,) ' Bill has just been entered apprentice to the eoffin business, like Sol. A nice piece of business it is for an undertaker to come and remonstrate with another for entering the business." "And who wrote the letter?" asked Ernest Toservem.. "Can you ask?" growled Coffin. "Of course there is only one man bad enough in the wide world. It was that fiend, Claude Hartrettet." Here the man with the very dirty bandage laughed heartily. "Oh, you can laugh away," said Solomon, "but there is no living in peace for an honest man, if that fellow is within twenty miles of him. It was only the other day he- " Here the sexton was interrupted by the entrance of one of the neighbors, a gentleman known as Squire Flint, a big, burly fellow, who 'burst into the room like a bull. He had bright blue eyes, curly yellow hair, and a voice like a tornado. "( Hey, Toservem I " he cried, " bring us a pipe, and bring us a bowl, and bring us our fiddlers three. Effie has gone to her father's, and I am bound to have a spree. Hang it I but there are pretty tlings going on." ' What?" inquired Jonathan Sewell, the tailor, timidly. Jonathan was a large, fat man, with a husky voice, and rather henpecked than otherwise. "Ha!" cried Squire Flint, wheeling round swiftly as the tailor spoke, "Ha! are you there, my prince of loiterers, my quintessence of procrastination, my shilly-shally, dilly-dally son of St. Goodman? Where are my breeches? Not made, of course. What is it, inherent in you gentlemen of the goose, that makes you always tell lies? You don't like that, don't you? Well then, don't tell lies, and you won't be abused." "What is the matter with the man?" asked Ernest. "What has Jonathan been a-doing of?

"Have I not seen you before, friend?" asked Squire Flint, looking at him keenly. The two   exchanged a meaning glance. "Your beggar man," contined  Flint, turning to Ernest Toservem, as if he wislhd  to change the topic; "your beggar man has been prowling round here again to-nioht." "Has he?" said Ernest. Yes," replied Flint. "I met him on the road which leads up to the castle." What beggar man?" asked the stranger with the very dirty bandage. "Ernest will tell you all about him," replied Flint. "I don't know much," said Ernest in answer to an inquir- ing look from the stranger.  "The first time I saw him was when our Doctor Owen, who had just returned from the Indies with a wife and two sweet babes," (here Squire Flint grinned,) "and we were walking together." "Owen I " cried the gentleman with the very dirty band age.  "Owen I was he the fellow who was once engaged to--?" with the handle of his pipe. "When  he returned from sea, Eflie (that's her name) had been married to our friend Flint here for a twelvemonth i 'Do you love me still, Effie?' asked Owen. Effie turned her head away. 'I love you as a brother, Owen, said she. 'Only as a brother?' said he. 'Only as a brother,' said slhe; 'I am married to another.' 'And are you married?' said Owen. 'Forgive me,' faltered she, 'I am.' 'Euphemia,' said Owen 'be happy. I would be no bar to your enjoymnt         py. I   would be no bar to your enjoyment. I am married myself.' 'Married!' she dried.

"And didn t 1 nearly let one of the babies fall?"  Solomon evidently regarded this as one of his most cheerful reminiscences. He laughed heartily. "Euphemia and Owen," continued Ernest, "were good friends thereafter, and many a goodly laugh had the twain at the odd meeting, when each had tried to break the awful news to the other. But, bless my soul!" "What's the matter? ' asked Solomon, startled very much by tie abruptness of the exclamation. "I forgot all about him," said Ernest. "About whom?" asked Coffin. "About the old beggar man," said Ernest, "I declare." "You get out!" growled Solomon, wrathfully, "to go and startle a fellow that way for nothing." And Solomon looked at the piece of sticking plaster fero- ciously. "Well," continued the innkeeper, " as I was saying, I was walking with Owen; when a miserable looking man came up to us as if to beg. But he only asked several questions about the Lady Nora-" "The Lady who?" inquired the stranger with the very dirty bandage, who had hitherto listened to all the conversation in an indolent and amused way, but who suddenly became very much excited; "the Lady who?" Ernest stared at him, surprised. "My good fellow," continued the other, "I pray you, go on. You do not know how much I am interested in your story." "I see you are," remarked Ernest. "Well, go on then, man," said the other, impatiently, " he asked after Lady Nora, did ie?" "Yes," replied Ernest, "after the Lady N'ora Berthaldes de Piquemont." "Daughter of the Count of Piquemont?" Yes." "Who is now in exile?" "Yes." "The Lady Nora being under the protection of Count Ber. trand?"  The same." "Good. Go on. The beggar man asked you about her, did he? Well, and what did you reply?"

"I answered as well as I could; Whereat he thanked me and went away. He refused the money I offered him, my bowels being moved to compas- sion for the poor old mma-els beg "d t       ps Here Solomon Coffin broke in disdainfully. Your bowels were moved to what?" said he. "To compassion," replied Ernest. "To nonsense!" cried the sexton, testily. "How can you move your bowels to compassion? and Solomon snorted with ' impatience. With the mildness of conscious rectitude and superior expe. rience in virtue, Ernest calmly answered: "Never you mind. You let my bowels alone." Then he resumed his narrative. "That night," said he, "returning from where I had been I passed Bertrand park. The moon was shining, and I dis- tinctly saw Lady Nora walking up and down with the old beg- gar man, whose arm encircled her waist." "Mighty improper," snorted Solomon Coffin, the sexton. "I'll tell you what, Solomon, said Ernest, turning on him fiercely, "if you go and put your dirty spoon into my dish again, I'll yunch your head. What do you mean by sitting there, volunteering your remarks, as if they were called for  What do you know about the matter?" "What do I know about the matter, Ernest Toservem?" snarled Coffin. "Maybe I know more than you calculate." "Oh, you do, do you?" sneered the innkeeper. "You always know a lot more than other folks. Improper! And what is there improper in a child embracing her father? And what is. there improper in an exiled father wanting to see his only child?  What is there improper in all that, Solomon Coffin?" "Nothing," replied that gentleman. "'Good," said Ernest; 1" and now you have forced me to let the cat out of the bag, I hope you feel better." "I do," quoth Solomon. "By George, sir," continued Ernest, with a flushed face addressing the stranger, respectfully, "I never meant to tell this; but that skeleton of a sexton has got it out of me some- how or another; and, as I have told so much, I may as well tell the rest.

Flint, you will assure these gentle- men of my honesty.  Let Godfroy of Rochateau have the news when you discover any (he will see it comes to me), and I will give a thousand marks to the first man who brings the infor- mation." '"What say you," said Ernest to the others; "shall we join together in the search, and share the reward?" Agreed," cried the rest. "And now for my song," said the stranger with the very dirty bandage. "I call it- "TO NANNY." When the swallows homeward fly, And the bloom is on the rye; In the merry month of May, My fair, ye swains; is gone astray. Why, lovely charmer, tell me why Down among the dead men, I must lie? Love is a sickness full of woes- Love is a blossom which there blows. The smiling morn may light the sky, The radiant star of day be nigh,  The thirsty earth may drink the rain, But give me more love or more disdain. Then, Nanny, wilt thou go with me, With a wet sail and flowing sea? Thou'lt not? My love I'll not deplore. I loved thee once. I'll love no more. While this anacreontic song was sung in a whining tone, by the stranger with the very dirty bandage, Solomon sat glaring at him. When it was over, he said: "Haven't I heard something very much like that before?" "Not at all unlikely,' replied the man with the very dirty "ba One thing I like about that song," remarked Ernest, "is, that you can't make head or tail of it. And that, I believe, is a true sign of merit." "' Or at least it is thought so," replied the stranger. "Oh I if that's the chat?" said the sexton, "I can give you one that will beat yours hollow."  With that, Solomon howled out the following:   DREAMS WITHN DREAMS.          45 TO BETSEY. One fine, rosy morning, the sun was declining, And Hesperus, beaming, environed the sea; Sweet, sweet were my dreams, 'neath a rose bush reclining, I musing lay bent on the land of the free. Ah, long may the green, sunny land of my rapture, Its pure, shining meadows, its bright running streams, Freed from the dread of inimical capture, Sparkle forever in love's happy dreams. Farewell! farewell! gentle spirit indwelling, May virtue enrobe thee with kindness and bliss, May the heart of the minstrel forever be telling How sweet is the hour succeeding to this. But we feel that we have lingered too long upon this part , of the story. Having given the reader a glimpse of what is to come, and having, moreover, properly presented him to the gentlemen who formed the festive circle at the inn, we must return to the castle; stopping by the way at the house of one of our good old friends (who will accompany us afterward), a person who plays his part in this strange, eventful history. CHAPTER Y. HOW FATHER WILFRID CAME TO THE CASTLE, AND WHAT RESULTED. MANY years before this story opens, there lived, near Ber- trand, a gentleman of good family, who, being (at least every- body said so) afflicted with a harmless aberration of intellect, had freedom of every castle and cottage in the neighborhood. And, indeed, the world had some foundation for its judgment, seeing that lunacy, being a disordered state of reason, is known by the afflicted party acting in a strange way, his actions form ing an exception to the general rule of human deportment; and seeing also that this gentleman's carriage, demeanor, and man- ner of acting in relation to the duties of life, savored of great, though innocent eccentricity. Accordingly, for all these reasons, and many more of equal weight, his neighbors justly deemed him a person whose understanding was so unbalanced, that he was no longer able to act in conformity with the generally re.    <pb n="46-47" xml:id="VAC6560-00000032"/> ti       DREAMS WITHN DREAMS. ceived regulations of worldly wisdom; the unfortunate man being patient, mild, merciful, continent, forgiving, and in short having all those inconceivable weaknesses which mark feeble and disordered brains, and set their owners apart from the great majority of mankind. Often did young Wilfrid (for such was his name) study his own vocation, and examine himself as to his fitness for the sacred ministry, trying to steer carefully between the Scylla of scrupulousness and the Charybdis of presumption. While he was thus considering, several other insane men, the most insane of whom, I regret to say, was a cardinal, wildly took it into their heads that Wilfrid- was anything but mad; and advised him to prepare for holy orders. In the course of time, there- fore, he was ordained priest, and returned home, the curate of Bertrand; where, owing to the aforesaid cardinal, a great revo- lution of opinion had taken place in his favor; and where peo. ple began to think his charitable youth might possibly have been actuated by principle. On the evening when this faithful narrative opens, the priest received a visit from a mnan who called himself Curma La Cham- bre, and who would have been called a very handsome man, were it not for a cat-like expression about the eyes. What he had to say was in substance as follows: Some years before the opening of this tale a certain noble- man fell in love, and secretly married the daughter of a widow. A child being born during the father's absence, and the young wife dying before she could reveal her marriage, the widow fled in shame together with the infant. From that day to the pres- ent the nobleman had been vainly looking for his child. For some reason Clovis Bertrand had been interested in the matter, and had applied to La Chambre for certain papers then n i his possession, which Clovis believed would throw a light upon the missing child. La Chambre had promised to look them over and acquaint Clovis through Father Wilfrid with the result; which result was contrary to Clovis's expectations. Meagre as was the tale, Father Wilfrid understood it per- fectly, and dismissed La ChamDre with the assurance that he would proceed the very next day to the castle. La Chambre, who had regarded the priest throughout the whole interview with intense dislike, bowed, and departed without more ado. Father Wilfrid the following morning, therefore, went to the castle, where he delivered the message in precisely the same words that he had received it, and no more.   DRENMS WIrrTHN DREAMS.       47 Poor Clovis, who still kept his room, hailed the priest's arrival with the greatest delight; and lay at once before him all that Albert had informed him the precedng night. Father Wilfrid listened, and then gently replied I tellyou ,  Clovis, you and Albert are both mistaken. I have known Nora from a child. I heard her first confession, gave her her first com- munion, prepared her for confirmation, and intend, with the blessing of God, to solemnize your marriage. I know she from the height of candor to the depth of duplicity." "But Albert saw her with a man," said Clovis. "True my dear child" replied the priest; but the ques- tion is who was that man? Need a man be a lover, because ather meets a lady by night? ight he not, for instance, be a Clovis started up. "I never thought of that," he cried. Father Wilfrid smiled sadly. "We seldom err on the side of charity," he said "and, althoughe notoriously faulty, we never give those we judge advantage of it." "What would you advise me to do?" asked Clovis. "I think your father should be made acquainted with the whole matter," said the priest, mildly; "as guardian of the young lady, he should know what has happened." "But father is so impetuous," Clovis began, when the priest gently laid his hand on his shoulder, and said: "My dear child, this is a question of righlt and wrong. Nora's father left her a sacred charge to your father's keeping. Whatever you think, it was the Count of Piquemont's right; and it would not become you, either as a son, a lover, or friend, to run counter to the opinion of older and wiser men." "But could it have been the Count of Piquemdnt?" asked Clovis, earnestly. "I have good to reason to suppose it was," replied the priest. "Well, tell my father all, then," said Clovis, "and may God bless you, Father Wilfrid. Add also that, should my sus- picioi prove true, I must leave the castle for a while, until she is married. My lord Clodolphus, I am sure, will give me a commission." Father Wilfrid smiled, saying: ," If that is all your chance of bearing arms, I am afraid you never will be a soldier." tHe then departed to see the Count. ^^K-^^^*    <pb n="48-49" xml:id="VAC6560-00000033"/> 45       DEEAMS WITHN DREAMS. And here we feel obliged to acquaint the reader with one or two facts concerning the Count of Piquemont. The revolutions of Dreamland bear a striking resemblance to those of the world without. Sometimes they succeed, and sometimes not. Among those revolutionists who suffered from a want of success, was Nora's father, now legally in exile, but. really living in almost utter destitution somewhere near the castle. Now it may seem extraordinary, that so great a per- sonage, and above all so great a friend of the Count's, should be in so woful a predicament; but Piquemont feared lest his near kinsman, Godfroy of Rochateau, should know of his where- abouts. And for the following reasons, to wit: First, because the said Godfroy held possession of his for- feited estates, until the said Piquemont should be restored. Consequent-A would be very imprudent to let Godfroy know he had returned, since it was obviously Godfroy's interest, vul. garly speaking, to get Piquemont into a scrape. Secondly, because Godfroy wished to marry Nora, and might make use of Piquemont's present dangerous position to force her into nuptials which Piqueanont would rather die than allow. Thirdly, because Piquemont might be restored any day (he being a very popular man, both on account of his principles and misfortunes), and consequently Godfroy would naturally be more than usually energetic just then; which idea seemed to be corroborated by the fact (hat Godfroy, suspecting the truth, was hunting for his kinsman ar and near. Nor would it do to take the Count (for the purpose of clear- ness, we shall always call our friend Bertrand by his title) into confidence; it being the height of absurdity and a positive proof of lunacy in any one to confide a secret to that worthy man, who had no more power to keep one than a sieve has to retain water. Now, although Nora had her own ideas and opinions con- cerning Godfroy, she was too good a daughter not to obey; but the painful nature of her present position determined her, Without loss of time, to confide the whole truth to the Count and Clovis, especially since, by the remarks of my lord Clodol- phus, she saw that her interviews with her father had been observed. As she sat engaged in thought in the Countess's boudoir, a little after the interview between Clovis and Father lWilfrid, the Count walked in.   DREAMS WITHN DREAMS.        49 "What is all this stuff," began that worthy man, "Clovis has been talking? He says you kissed a man in the back gar- den, and he means to go and be a soldier. Have you been kissing a man in the back garden?" "I confess it," said Noa. "Was it wrong?" "Upon my word," replied the Count, "you take things mighty coolly! Was it wrong? Oh! you know very well it was wrong. Of course it was wrong. Suppose I kissed a woman behind the stable; do you think I would ever hear the end of it?" "Well," remarked Nora, quietly, " and what has your kissing a woman behind the stable to do with the subject?" Count Bertrand started. "How did you find it out?" he asked; "I thought every- body was in bed. But that has nothing to do with the case in point. Suppose your father comes to me and says: ' How do you do? How is my daughter? How has she been amusing herself lately?' and I answer: 'With kissing men by night, in the back garden.' Do you suppose he will be gratified?" "Why," replied Nora, "this is not the first time I kissed him." "The deuce it isn't!" cried the Count; " a pretty story to tell me, and you engaged to Clovis! Ar'n't you ashamed of yourself?" "I cannot say I am," replied Nora, smiling. "MWhy I!" cried the Count, nearly out of his senses; "of all the cool remarks I ever heard uttered by a young lady of seven- teen, this is about the coolest!" "I was brought up," replied Nora, " to think there was no harm in it." "Then," answered the Count, "all I can say is, that you must have had a nice bringing up. Where is your sense of decency? Where is your sense of propriety?" ' What!" answered Nora, " do you really, seriously mean to tell me it is wrong for a daughter to embrace her father?" "Who the devil is talking about a daughter embracing her father?" replied the Count. "I am speaking of your having kissed a man." "Well," replied Nora, innocently, "is not my father a man?" "I have no reason to suppose the contrary," said the Count; "fathers usually are. But what on earth, woman I has your blessed father's being a man to do with the business? 3    <pb n="50-51" xml:id="VAC6560-00000034"/> 50       DREAMS WITHN DREAMS. ' He don't want a proxy, I believe? If you want a parental embrace, why don't you come to me?" "You are not handsome enough," said Nora, demurely.   - The Count grinned.  "Others differ from you there," said he.  "Aha!" cried Nora, with a merry laugh. "I have hunted you to your hole, have I? These will be pretty tricks to tell the Countess." "Don't!  cried the Count, terrified. "She would not leave me a hair on my head. I don',t do it often. But, really,  we ought not to amuse ourselves with these trifles, when your conduct is in question." "But my own father," urged Nora, "Confound your father!" cried the Count, "at least-no! don't confound him. Why are you always lugging your father in by the head and shoulders? I speak of the man you met last night." ' But he was my father," said Nora. "Who was your father?" asked the Count, bewildered. That man," said Nora, smiling. ' How the devil could he be your father," asked the Count, "when you have one already? You can't have two fathers any more than you can have two noses. Don't talk to me." "But this man is the only father -I ever had," urged Nora. "Nonsense!" cried the Count; "Piquemont was your father long before you were born, or your mother either." "But the Count of Piquemont, your friend, and my father," said Nora, "it was, I met last night." At this the Count was transfixed with astonishment, and sat looking at Nora with his mouth open, as if he were undecided which part of her he should bite first. "Do you mean to say," quoth he, at last, "do you mean to say that your father was here last night? Bless my soul I It's a mercy he didn't catch his leg in the trap. And I thought he came after the hens. Bless my soul, what a world we live in I And that fool of a Clovis-oh I what a mortal ass that young man is-with his face a yard long, hunting up evidence of your infidelity I Evidence, indeed I The next thing I shall  hear, I suppose, will be that he is hunting up evidence to prove I have the leprosy, or that his mother is a cannibal.

Whew!", And the Count puffed as if he were out of breath. Sud- denly the bright idea struck him that the servants (who slept at the back of the house) might espy Piquemont on his visits; and, in order to prevent the calamity, he determined, forthwith, to change their apartments. Actuated by which purpose, the worthy nobleman rushed out of the room on his errand of love. Now, in lovers' reconciliations there is not much spoken. One embrace, half a dozen unconnected expressions of tender- ness on the part of the young man, and a flood of happy tears on that of the young girl-that was all. It was then my lord Clodolphus-who had a talent for turning up always when least expected, and least wanted-gave mouth: "In sooth," quoth he, "this is refreshing. What saith Tully? ' Love is a furious disease of the mind.' And, again, Plotinus hath it, 'Oculi sunt in amore duces,' which, being translated is, the eyes are love's harbingers; from which word, to wit, duces (dux in the nominative singular), the lower classes are wont to call their sweethearts ducks. Again, Plato calls love a privilege of nature, and Xenophon treats thereof most dulcetly in his Symposio; to say nothing of Lucian, Valerius Flaccus, Seneca, Theocritus, and divers others. Now-" But here my lord Clodolphus was interrupted by the Count's reentrance. He reposed his jaws as the Count began: "Well, old bull of Bashan, are you at it agian? If you couldn't talk, you'd swell up and burst." "Would I?" retorted my lord Clodolphus. "Ah! would you," replied the Count. "Did you ever see a fool?" "Plenty," quoth my lord Clodolphus. "And would you like to see one now?" asked the Count. "I would," quoth my lord Clodolphus. "Well, then, look there," said the Count. ".Verily you cannot mean that young lady," quoth my lord Clodolphus, shocked. "A pretty philosopher you are," cried the Count, highly excited. "Do I mean Nora? Of course I don't mean Nora." "Then you mean Clovis," quoth my lord Clodolphus. Considering there are only two, and you guessed it the second time, I must congratulate you on your penetration," said the Count, in a taunting voice. What are you pitching into me for?" asked my lord Clo-.    <pb n="52-53" xml:id="VAC6560-00000035"/> 52       DREAMS WITHN DREAMS. dolphus, in an injured tone; "you are as aggravating to-day, Bertrand, as a bear with a sore head." "Oh, indeed!" replied the Count. "Am I? And maybe there's nothing to aggravate me? There's that dolt of a son of mine--" "Meaning Clovis?" asked my lord Clodolphus. "How the devil could. I mean any other, man alive!" re plied the Count, impatiently. "One would suppose, to hear you talk, that I had a hundred thousand sons-" "Wouldn't ninety-nine thousand nine hundred and ninety- nine do?" inquired my lord Clodolphus, facetiously. "Nine hundred and ninety-nine thousand devils 1 " cried the Count. "Oh, get away! What's the use of trying to talk reasonably with you? Get away." ! And why am I a fool?" asked Clovis. "Why?" replied the Count. "You had better not talk. To go and make a fool of your only father in that way I Tle least you say, the better, I should think. And here's your mother coming. One would think I had had enough trouble on my shoulders this blessed morning, without having that woman in the room too." "Why, Charles, what's the matter?" inquired the old lady, who had just entered. "Matter! matter enough," cried the Count. )tHere's Pique--" "Hush, father," said Clovis. "Please hush," said Nora. "Verily you will let the cat out of the bag," said my lord Clodolphus. The Count muttered something in an undertone. Taking advantage of his silence, my lord Clodolphus deemed it a good opportunity to make a few remarks of his own. "Verily," said he, "silence, say the paynim Saracens, is gold; and speech only silver, Silence, I trow (called by the ancients Harpocrates and 'AprroKpaTrr1), was doubtless originally an Egyptian divinity, represented by a youth clad in the skin of a wolf, spangled all over with eyes and ears, and holding his finger on his lips. The Romans, I am told, placed this god at the doors of their temples, typifying that decorous silence verily is proper for a house of worship. Now, the question naturally comes up, ' Which is the best, speech or silence?' If a man saith silence, I point to baboons,", (here my lord Clodolphus accidentally waved his hand, as if singling out the present com-   DREAMS WITHN DREAMS.        53 pany as peculiarly appropriate specimens of the simia tribe.) "I point, I say, to baboons; concerning whom the blacka- moors, in sooth, declare that they possess the proper organs of speech, but remain dumb, in order not to be compelled to work. Baboons do not talk. Are they therefore superior to man, who does talk? I think not. If inferior, why inferior? Be- cause they cannbt talk. Talking, therefore, is better than silence." "You seem to think so, at all events," said the Count. \ "You differ from me, I suppose," said my lord Clodolphus, addressing the Count. "I prefer silence when you are in the room, at any rate," said the Count, impatiently. "Very well," quoth my lord Clodolphus, waggishly, " for the future I never will think of a baboon, without being remind- ed of you." "You get out," said the Count; "you are a pretty sort of a -,uest, to be uttering your impertinences so blandly. By C   rge I " he continued, "when I see that fellow taking it so e . I feel like jumping out of my skin like a crab." I meant it for wit," quoth my lord Clodolphus. "Wit I " exclaimed the Count. "You might as well call it theology. Go and call a man an African baboon, and then chuckle over it like a joke." "Well, if you don't like to be called a baboon in joke," quoth my lord Clodolphus, "'I will call you one in earnest. Anything to gratify you." "AAnd I won't be called one in earnest either," said the Count. "You're as hard to please as a pig," said-imy lord Clodol- phus, irritably. "I must either call you an ape in jest or not in jest, mustn't I?" *'I see no call for your calling me one, any way," retorted the Count.  "' Just hear the man! I shall go out of my senses directly." "But," argued my lord Clodolphus, " don't Tibullus say--" "I don't care a jot if he does," said the Count. "Don't what?" asked my lord Clodolphus. "That," replied the Count. "What's that?" asked my lord Clodolphus. "Oh! you know as well as I do," answered the Count. Tibul--" began my  lord Clodolphus. "No  you don't," interrupted the Count, "I am not going <pb n="54-55" xml:id="VAC6560-00000036"/> 54       DREAMS WITHN DREAMS. to have the head knocked off my shoulders by Julius Cesar, I can tell you." "'Very well," quoth my lord Clodolphus, loftily, "then don't you go and tell me you had the best of it." "The best of what?" replied the Count. "Bless the man, I think his wits have gone woolgathering. I don't want the best of anything, unless it's the best of wine; and since that has come up, suppose, old folio, we go and take a drink." "Verily," quoth my lord Clodolphus, facetiously, "if J be an old folio, I will so far confess to my stupidity, as to allow I am a very dry one." "Oh, you do, do you?" said the Count. "Well said. If you never say anything less true than that, you won't have to /confess many lies. Well, come along, then, and let's liquor." "Liquor!" exclaimed my lord Clodolphus.  "What's that?" "Oh, you don't know, you don't," replied the Count. "Don't you know what folks mean when they say 'Let's liquor?' " "I do not," said my lord Clodolphus; "albeit I can guess." "You know just as well as I do, old fellow," said the Count, seizing his arm. "Come along." "You speak," quoth my lord Clodolphus, as they walked lovingly away, arm in arm, " you speak metonymically." "What?" exclaimed the Count, pausing in his walk, and looking my lord Clodolphus hard in his intellectual face. "Metonymically," repeated my lord Clodolphus. "I don't know that," said the Count, shaking his lead; "I think it is more drinkonymically than meatonymically. But don't let's bother over your infernal polysyllables. Anything you like, so long as it's good." And with that the two friends descended the stairs, to enjoy themselves metonymically for a while. "Oh, what a man he is I " said the Countess, speaking of her lord and master, as that gentleman led my lord Clodolphus off; "he has actually, my dear! gone into the maids' rooms and tossed their things out of the window. But you young people are evidently not hearing a word I say." Bless you! they were not. What a wonderful thing is' a woman! How she twists us round her little finger! What is beauty? You don't know. I don't know. Nobody knows. Look at that young girl. There she stands; a weak, fragile   DREAMS WITIN DREAMS.         55 thing, with a power before which genius is a dwarf and comr mon sense a pigmy. Let us go and look at another. What! :.   you don't want to look at another, don't you? With a purely platonic admiration, of course. What did you say? Of course? Well, I said of course-with a purely platonic admiration you wish to please your taste, and admire that rosebud? That is the way it is with all of us. You are catching the disease, my poor friend. By all I honor! a sudden thought strikes me-is love infec- tious, or is it contagious? Doctors have attempted to make a distinction between infection and contagion, and, of course, have disagreed, and left us on our beam ends-whatever part of the human frame that means. Well, as far as 1 understand it, con- tagion requires contact, and infection does not necessarily. If so, then love is decidedly infectious. Assuming all contagious diseases are infectious, but all infections are not merely conta- gious, on the philosophical principle that all rattlesnakes are animals, but all animals are not, therefore, rattlesnakes (and a m ighty comfortable world it would be without the reptiles)- assuming this, I say, I think we can safely call love a very infectious malady, caught by means of a certain indescribable something (not to be too generaD, emanating from a woman, and having the peculiar property of making men sheepish. Charles Lamb remarked, when told he looked modest, that " the older the larth, the more sheepish it became." With love the thing is reversed, and sheepishness belongs to the youth of man rather than to more advanced years. The prognosis of the disease (for particulars of which I refer you to Burton's Anato- my of Melancholy), the prognosis easily decides the course of the disease by the peculiar symptoms of love-madness. I would quote Latin here, only Burton has monopolized everything said on the subject; and stealing your quotations from that author is so stale a trick, that I would no more think of trying it than I would open a game of chess, if I played with Morphy, by trying to foolmate the man. But about love. Look at our friend Mercutio approach our fair Agnes. He is the wittiest man in the country. He never was at a loss for a reply; but look how silly he stands string at our little fairy, as if e would say, "Oh, my dear! I would if I could; but I couldn't." Tell me, Mercutio! could you say "Boll!" to a goose now, if you tried? You could not, you fool; and you know it as well as I do. Ha, Mercu- tio, are you hurt? " 'Tis not so deep as a well, nor so wide    <pb n="56-57" xml:id="VAC6560-00000037"/> 56       DREAMS WITHN DREAMS. as a church door; but 'tis enough; 'twill serve." Ha, Mercu. tio! if thou livest a thousand years, thou wilt not feel that rapture twice. Oh, fancy! oh, Morpheus! oh, dreams within dreams! oh, human life, when art thou so fair as when we create our own happiness, and draw from within the magic which enchants us? Let others seek wealth, fame, and pleasure; but as for me, give me a hair mattress and?. oft pillow, tuck me up, and let me go to sleep. Imagination shall lend me her wings, and I will revel in the ideal. And what the deuce has all this to do with the story? Reader, it is written to fill up. When you come to write a story, you will know what that means. Until then, leave it alone. For your sake I will cut it short, and return to the Countess, her son in esse, and her daughter in posse. Clovis related to his mother all that had occurred; and his mother, in return, told him what the faithful Peter had narrated, touching the apparition. Nora was very much interested, and inquired what was the legend about the spectre? Whereat the old lady told it in the following words: "It is not much, ny child. Once upon a time there was a cruel nobleman, whose name was Curma of Uphorn. From him I am descended. In fact the Count's family and those of the Uphorn are so closely related by many marriages, that, according to the legend, we share the warnings of the spectre. ' Now this Curma ohad married a gentle creature, who bore him a son in the course of time. Her marriage was only a repetition of the old story of neglect which we read of in the chronicles of every century. At length it is said he slew her in a fit of jealousy, just three months before their son Edward was to return home from the university. "' The first appearance of the spectre, we are told, occurred in the following manner. Edward had returned home. He knew of his mother's death, of course, but was not acquainted with the manner; for who would dare confront the vengeance of Curma Uphorn? "There was a nunnery near the castle-you can visit the ruins of both 'any day you choose, for they are near here-and Edward, as he stepped out upon the balcony, heard them sing- ing their vesper hymn. It is a very old one. I remember it as well now as if I sang it yesterday." "Pray, repeat it," said Nora.   DREAMS WITHN DREAMS.           57 "It is very simple, child," said the old lady. "But you shall hear it, if you will: "' Consolation of the holy, Refuge of the melancholy, Oh! amid the sins and folly Of the human race, By the love that Jesus bore thee, By the millions who implore thee, By their grief who kneel before thee, Show thy servants grace. Thou, who rays of sacred glory O'er the dark and solemn story Of the ages past and hoary Scatterest divine, Bend, ah! bend thy gaze, sweet power; When descends the dreadful hour, Be to us a shield rmid tower From the foe malign. Seat of wisdom! Refuge given! Comfort to the sorrow-driven! Help of Christians! gate of heaven! -Hearken to our prayer. Let the Lamb of God but hear us, Let good angels hover near us. Mary! mother! haste to rear us From our sad despair.' "While he stood listening, the following extraordinary inci- a   dent is said to have occurred. Close to one of the towers (he was standing on the walD a stone bench had been placed, where he and his mother used to sit when he was a child.   As his eyes naturally turned in that direction, he saw the form of a female seated on the  bench.  Although, as he   afterward acknowledged, he was awed by something unearthly in her appearance, he made a step forward.   As he advanced, the figure raised her head, and disclosed the features of his mother. Thl apparition raised her hand as in warning, and pointed to heaven.  Moved by some feeling for which he could not ac- count, he again made a step forward, when the figure disap- peared. "The young man, recovered from   his first astonishment, looked carefully round to see if any person could have played him a cruel deception; but the great height of the walls made the impossibility of escape at once obvious. "Curma lTphorn died the next day.   Since then, legends    <pb n="58-59" xml:id="VAC6560-00000038"/> 58-       DREAMS WITHN DREAMS. say, the figure has appeared whenever any of the Uphorns are about to die in their sins. Sometimes the lady of Uphorn ap- pears; sometimes a faint mist only passes before the beholder's terrified eyes." CHAPTER VI. OF HOW ALBERT AND THE YOUNG OFFICER HAD AN ADVENTURE. "OVE, be it boldly declared, is the sum and substance of our history. Why not?  Love is the most elastic of passions, comprising not only admiration of the fair sex, but love for our pursuits, our interests, and our potatoes. You cannot paint a man naturally, unless you make him love something, if it be only himself. In fact, even at the risk of repetition, we intend to intersperse our history with remarks on the tender passion. But not always in propria persona. So let us listen to our learned friend, Dr. Prometheus. How do you do, Professor? Glad to see you. The Doctor gives a learned hem! and goes right to work. Let us hear what the Doctor says. "Hem! You have spoken of woman. Let me speak of man.  Virum cano." "Arma virumque cano," I say, correcting him, for I have perused the JEneid as far as that. "Virurn cano," says the Doctor emphatically. "What have I to do with arms, indeed, unless it be those nature has given me, and which I find useful at times? But I know Latin, sir: "Felix qui potuit rerum cognoscere causas, Quique metus oinnes et inexorabile fatum, Subjecit pedibus, strepitumque Acherontis avari." "Please translate," I say. The Doctor chuckles maliciously, and remarks dryly: "I thought I would bring you down a peg or two, sir, with your Arma virumque. The meaning of that quotation--which you don't know-is, according to my humble understanding: Happy the man who knoweth the causes of .things; who tramples Under his feet all dread and fate unflinching in purpose; These despising, together with greedy Acheron's roaring. Ha  And now -you are put down, and not likely to be try- ing to crow over me with your learning, suppose we go on."   DREAMS WITHN DREAMS.        59 Suppose we do," I remark, being pretty effectually cowed by this time; for the Doctor not only considers me a fool, but takes remarkably little pains to conceal his conviction. "Mythology," says the Doctor, "tells us-Jupiter granted perpetual youth to mankind, once upon a time. This gift the human guardians of. the treasure laid on the back of an ass, who, stopping to drink at a fountain, was prevented by a ser- pent until a change of treasures should be mutually agreed upon  which accordingly was done; the contract explicitly stating that the serpent, party of the first part, should have the youth, and the donkey, party of the second part, the water, to each severally and his heirs forever. Now," concludes the Doctor profoundly, " what does all this mean? Is it not clear even to the meanest capacity-if you don't understand me, my dear friend, I will explain more fully-to the meanest capacity, I say, that this perversion of true history beautifully illustrates the learned opinion of antiquity that every woman was an ass, if every ass was not a woman?" I reply that this certainly is a new way of looking upon the subject; that I am unprepared to give any opinion as yet; that it strikes me as proving, if anything, that the ancients did not regards the fair sex as respectfully as they might have done; and divers other feeble remarks of the same calibre. "Humph!" says the Doctor. "A little reflection would not hurt you, young man. We all know how Christianity is essen- tially the friend of woman. A woman is. necessarily an ass." "Is she?"I ask. "Necessarily," says the Doctor, dogmatically; "and, what is more, an ass of the lowest type. Otherwise, how is it that, while so many nincompoops are married, I have been refused distinctly four times? A woman, young man, is only worth her salt after she has bestowed her affectidns on some young fellow-or middle aged one," adds the Doctor, correcting him- self. "Your Nora, for instance, is not a bad example." I looked pleased. "Oh you needn't smirk," says the Doctor. "I don't mean at all to say she is well painted. I only take her for an ex- i'   ample in want of a better one. She is a great ass in considering Clovis a demi-god." I here suggest that I never said she did. "Don't interrupt, sir I " cries the Doctor. He has, by the way, a habit of forgetting himself at times, and- imagining he is in the schoolroom. "Don't interrupt. sir. I tell you she    <pb n="60-61" xml:id="VAC6560-00000039"/> 60       DREAMS WITIIIN I REAMS. does. She is a great ass in thinking that Clovis a denii-god, yet I love her the better for it. The Mrs. Prometheus that is to be, can't do better than follow that example. Women con- quer by non-resistance. Who can ike an infant? Woman is mighty in her very helplessr, i ow pay attention. Don't yawn, because yawning i' ,olite. And don't try to yawn with your lips togethc chat is worse. It does not conceal the act in the sli;' . degree, and makes you look ill favored, to say nothi-- us aggravating me, and appearing as if you thought m(e . fool. Woman, I say, is strong in her weakness. Agamemnon can tell an old father he intends to make a cham- bermaid of his daughter; but your Christian would be hooted out of society if he so much as insulted a woman by a look. What does all this prove? That the more a woman is a donkey the more she is liked? No. That was in the ancient order of things. What then? Why, of course, that in raising woman, man unconsciously raises himself; while, on the other hand, the more gentle a woman is, the mightier is she." I suggest that everybody knows this. Which remark the Doctor takes in high dudgeon. "Yes, sir," he replied sharply, , and everybody knows that the square of the hypothenuse, in a right-angled triangle, is equal to the squares of the two other sides; but that don't prevent our teaching it anew to every new generation. As a writer, it is your business to play moral schoolmaster, and -back up old saws with modern instances. If you write at all -and excuse me for adding that you had best think twice before you do-it is your duty to second good and resist evil; and how can you do so but by clothing old virtuous ex- pressions and ideas in a more modern garb?  Adam wa doubtless a handsome man, and his wife a very stylish woman, but if you wish to present your friends in genteel society nowa- days, fig leaves and skins are out of fashion. 'A man's a man for all that,' but he must yield to custom. So let us have old ideas in new garments." "But I don't do it," I say feebly. "A pretty looking fellow my lord Clodolphus would be in fig leaves, or the Countess in a wolfskin." Oh," says the Doctor, compassionately; "but you are a beautiful specimen of a fine intellect. And you, too!-you to  write a book!" "Well, you said so," I remark. "Silence, sir," replies the Doctor, sternly. "Silence, or   DREAMS WITHN DREAMS.         61 you and I will fall out. To finish what I have to say in three words, allow me to make this peroration: "My advice to you is to stick to love. People never get tired of it-no more should they. And what is easier than to write a love scene?  John woos Joan.  John loves Joan. U;i  Joan loves John. John grins at Joan. Joan grins at John. rhat is love rustic. Again, Mr. Smith, the honorable Mr. Smith, loves Lady Jones. Smith and Jones dance together, flirt to- gether, walk together, sing together. Finally they are mar- ried. That is love genteel. Don Bolero de Whiskers has a passion for Donna Christina de Askmydad. Jousts, dragon- killing, Moor-conquering, enchantments, final triumph and a gorgeous marriage. That is love romantic. It is very easy. Love is but the frame to the novel picture. After you once have the plan, go and buy a dummy. Get one or two stock love novels. Pick out the one you like best, and copy it. You need not fear being found out. One love story is as like t! ' another as two eggs. Copying saves time, and pleases all the same; for love and murder, doves and poniards are, after all --let whoever will say nay-only the common properties of the Romantic Theatre." So much for Doctor Prometheus, who pretends to create his scholars by stealing light from the heavens, and making men of them. We thought his observations a very proper preface to the conversation of Albert and the young officer, as they rode toward Treviot; which we now purpose to transcribe. "Were vou ever in love?" asked the young officer. "No," replied Albert; " and, what is more, I hope I shall never be." Why so?" aked the other. "Because men are so simple when they are trotting after women," replied Albert, scornfully. "In love, foul is: fair, darkness light, obsequiousness courtesy, and servility obedience. I have no wish to be under any woman's slipper. Bah! Love is. a hash of sympathies, antipathies, jealousies, fear, sorrows, suspicions, anxieties, dotage, melancholy, fire, unkindness, death, and hell." "Truly," replied the officer, laughing, " you have not suf- fered, I see; for if you had, you would not speak so philosoph- ically about it. Servile When was love ever otherwise? What is obsequiousness in reason, is humility in love." "Perhaps so," said Albert, dryly. I should like to have you talk to an old friend of mine,    <pb n="62-63" xml:id="VAC6560-00000040"/> 62       DREAMS  ITIIIN DREAMS. one Fulgentius Ardor," replied the other, good naturedly. ' He holds pretty strong opinions on the subject." "Fulgentius Ardor!" said Albert; "surely I have heard the -name before? If I am not mistaken, he is expected at the castle." "Very likely," replied the young officer. "The man is a character. . You have missed a treat." "Very possibly," said Albert. "But let us regard the matter coolly. What a man most desires, becomes at last an infatuttion. We are creatures of habit. Let us say a woman is to our liking; a fair one with bright eyes, fine features, and good complexion; a very masterpiece of a woman, in fine. What then? The luxury is at best expensive. These women are too officious-too full of sensibilities, and the devil knows what not. You never know where to have them, and where not to have them. Let them alone, and you are spared all difficulty. That is what I do; and I am satisfied that, on the whole, I have acted wisely."' "Permit me to put the case in a different light," replied the young officer. "Did you ever know a person who was con- tented with his lot?" "Certainly not," replied Albert. "There is always something we want," pursued the other; "no matter how much we possess, is there not?" Of course," answered Albert, And that something else, whatever it may be," continued the young officer, " would not satisfy us, even, if we had it; for at once some new wish would spring up. Am I right?" "Who does not know  that?" said Albert. "Human wishes are like the hydra's heads. Two spring up for one cut off the list of man's wishes." "Exactly," replied the other. "And this shows us that the soul is satisfied with nothing short of everything good; that is to say, infinite good." "Well?" said Albert. "Now," continued the young officer, " infinite good is God, and God is love; love from the smallest to the greatest; love to everything that exists, in fine." "I follow you," said Albert. "The world of man," pursued the other, " is only bright to him who possesses the sun of love. There are two degrees of love, but only one kind; and both degrees must possess, as a sine qua non of sincerity, the entire affections of the individual placed upon God, and upon his neighbors, for God's sake." upon upon his thrz   DREAMS WITHN DREAMS.         63 "So priests say," remarked Albert. "And so says revelation," said the other, "and so says reason, and so says common sense. God is not only good, but goodness; not only lovable, but love; not only beautiful, but beauty; and in loving goodness, love, and beauty, we are, con- sciously or unconsciously, loving God. He who is attracted by a gentle girl, loves her for what she is-for her sweetness, truth, sincerity, constancy, and beauty; because man loves sweetness, truth, sincerity, constancy, and beauty; or, in other words, because man tends to love God." "Well?" said Albert, his interest and curiosity awakened. "He," continued the young officer, "who properly loves a woman, acknowledges this directly or indirectly; and hence will never marry without the permission and sanction of God." "How do you prove that?" asked Albert. "By the notorious fact," replied the other, "that in every age, however remote, and in every country, however civilized or degraded, marriage has been and is a religious ceremony. Man instinctively feels that matrimony is the peculiar care of the Divinity. And it is." "Then, why do priests exalt virginity?" asked Albert. "Because," replied the other, "it necessarily follows from my premises, that it is a sign of a loftier intelligence, and a greater degree of advancement in truth, when a soul realizes the fact of God's beauty so effectually as to fall in love with the Deity himself, and to be satisfied with nothing short of the pos- session of God. But these cases are rare, and must be so." "And why?" "Heaven only knows," answered the other, with a sigh. "We are at best degraded beings endowed with hope. And :   now, if it will not weary you, I have no objection to tell you a love tale. Perhaps I may convert you to my opinion " "I think not," replied Albert, dryly; " for nothing, I assure you, amuses and entertains me more than to see what an ass a man makes of himself in that condition; and, if philosophers '     are right, derision is no sign of respect." "You are pleased to be facetious," said the young officer, slightly offended. "No! no! Upon my honor, no I " cried Albert, anxious to efface the impression. "If I laughed, it was not at you. Do not be offended, I beg you." "You are right," said the other, "and I am indeed more vexed with myself now than I was with you."    <pb n="64-65" xml:id="VAC6560-00000041"/> "      DREAMS WITHN DREAMS. "Tush, man!" replied Albert, kindly; "we all give way, and I assure you I am as bad as yourself at times." "If all men were as sensible as you," said the officer, "we would soon have done with the duel." "And so you would fight a duel?" asked Albert. "' It is not a question of would or would not," answered the other. "I must do so if I am affronted. The common law of the army is imperative, and more shame to those who founded, and us who keep up the abominable custom I We drive or keep out of the army men who would be an honor to any profession. I remember a case once, where a gay Lothario eloped with the wife of a gentleman. A duel ensued, in which the husband was killed. Even this striking example of the duello's injustice had no effect, and the husband, after losing wife and honor, was supposed to gain satisfaction by surrender- ing his own soul and body to the seducer." "Still you would fight, if challenged?" pursued Albert. "Yes, I would," replied the other. "I would fight to- morrow, if insulted. Please God I mayinever be tempted!" "That is a strange way of pleasing God," remarked Albert, with the slightest perceptible sneer, "to acknowledge a thing to be wrong, and express with the same breath a full determina- tion to do it." The young officer sighed, but made no reply. "Let me tell you my story," he said at last. "It is very strange how the subject of duelling has -formed the preface of my tale; for the narration of my love experience has so much to do with the subject, that I cannot separate the one from the other. "Our regiment was once quartered in the neighborhood of a little provincial town, which we found inexpressibly dull, and where we were at a loss to know how to pass the time. The usual pastimes were called up and used until we were satiated, and, as a final resource, the officers took to hunting as the only means left of conquering ennui. "Five of us always hunted together.  We had been schoolfellows once, and, by a turn of fortune's wheel, found ourselves thrown, luckily or unluckily, in the same regiment. Besides myself, the company consisted of two brothers, called Bernardine and Ludger, and two young noblemen, whom I shall call Leopold and Damian. "But hunting palls when there is little or nothing to hunt, and, after several days of bad fortune, we agreed to give the thing up in disgust. It was then the brothers informed us that   DREAMS WITHN DREAMS.        65 this town was their native place, and proposed that we should join the little circle of their acquaintances. Not relishing much the small talk of a country town, we had hitherto neglected the worthy burghers; but what will not ennui drive a man to? We were actually overjoyed at the prospect. "Bernardine's father was one of those solemn, Dutch-built gentlemen of the phlegmatic school; a stern, uncompromising man where honor was concerned, but as generous as the sun.- He was a widower, with an only daughter-and that daughter was Rosalia." "Ha!" said Albert, smiling, "we have come to the point." We have," replied the other. "When I first saw her, she was leaning on her father's arm, laughingly smoothing his gray hair. Her arm-oh, what a lovely arm " "Yes," said Albert, a little sarcastically. "Well, never mind," said the officer. "It was what the inhabitants of the British Isles call a stunner." "Oh, indeed!" said Albert, laughing outright. The other joined him good humoredly, and then continued. "From the crown of her pretty head to the sole of her pretty foot, she was a most remarkable body, I assure you. And as for her soul (not the sole of her foot this time), there was nothing wanting, I am perfectly convinced." "Short and sweet," remarked Albert. "I beg your pardon," said the other. "Not short at all She was a five foot-sixer." "Oh! I don't mean the lady, but the description," re- marked Albert. "Oh!" echoed the other. "Well, do you know I fell in love with her?" "I suppose so," replied Albert. "It does not require much sagacity to understand that." "I fell in love with her," continued the officer. "I was in fetters at once." "And are now?" "And am now, of course." "And what did the lady do?" "Loved me in return." "I congratulate you," said Albert. "But why are you not married? You are rich enough, surely." The young officer's countenance fell. "I will tell you," he replied. "Rosalia had a companion, one of the most superb    <pb n="66-67" xml:id="VAC6560-00000042"/> "    DRIEAMS WITIIN DREAMS. women I ever beheld. She was not like Rosalia-a rosehud; she was one of your full-blown flowers-what men call a stylish woman; with wit and money, and the devil knows what." "The devil, I suspect, has considerable to do with those kind of women," remarked Albert. "Whether he does or he does not generally," said the other, "lie certainly put his finger in the pie this time. The two brothers and their two fellow officers all fell in love with her, and the diabolical woman encouraged all four." "Of course she did," assented Albert, with a nod. "She w -as just the kind of woman to do it. You always find more bees hovering round your full-blown flower than your bud. Well, and how did it end?" "The two brothers came to an understanding," replied the officer, "and challenged their rivals. They met, and both the brothers fell. Bernardine died on the field, and Ludger ex- pired while we were conveying him home." The young man was silent for a moment, nor did Albert -break the silence. "I shall pass over the sorrow and despair of the family," continued the yoing man after a while, "and simply say that the father forbade me the house; for I had been Ludger's second. But my love for Rosalia conquered everything. I pushed my way into her father's presence, and urged my suit with all the violence of despair. He heard me coldly, and replied: 'If God spares you tor one year, and does not call you to account for the blood which cries up to him for vengeance, I will for- give you. Leave us for that time, and return at its expiration. By the fear of men's opinions, you have been led to transgress the law of God. If he spares you for a year, I will take it as a token that he has forgiven you, and will submit to his decree. But do not be elate. Since the beginning he has set his brand on murderers.' 'And his pardon on the repenting,' I replied. 'Young man,' said the father, sternly, ' ad you repented, we would never stand here this day holding this conversation. In your own heart you know you do not repent, and would seek a man's life to-morrow. As you have sown, so must you reap. But enough of this. You are, at least, no worse than the rest. Return in one year and claim my daughter's hand. If I car. lot teach her meanwhile to forget you, she must take the husband of her choice.'" "And did you return?" asked Albert. "The year expires to-day," said the other. "If I live until to-morrow, I shall go and claim the hand of Rosalia.' '   DREAMS WITHN DREAMS.         67 Now, before we continue, let us pause toremark one of those strange means Providence uses to convert the soul. A thoroughly wicked man sometimes makes a remark which arouses the attention of another, who ponders on it, acknowl- edges its force, obeys the impulse of grace, and is saved; whereas the other, who was the means of this man's salvation, forgets his homily the next minute, and is lost. This is a com- mon occurrence in the history of souls. There lives not a man, perhaps, who has not seen this thing effected; and it is a mighty reply to those who love to exclaim: "Physician, cure thy- self." Now, Albert's sneering remark to the effect that acknowledging a thing sinful, and expressing at the same time an intention to do it, was a strange way of pleasing God, actually had roused his companion to a proper view of the ques- tion. "Whatever be the result," he said to himself, "I vow I will never fight a duel again." But let us continue. As the young officer finished his remarks, they heard a sound as of a horseman breaking through the bushes. Looking in that direction, they perceived a man coming toward them on a stout nag. "By George " said Albert, "I am not sorry to see him; for, to confess the truth, I have been very doubt- ful for the last half hour as to whether we were going in the. right way or not." As he said this, the stranger came up, and, hearing their trouble, bade them follow. The stranger was stern enough, haughty enough, and abrupt enough, but had still that polish which is only formed by mingling with the higher classes of a very civilized community; a very good thing in the abstract, but, like all other polish, not of much value if the wood it adorns be rotten at the core. As their guide vouchsafed no remarks, the other two followed in silence. At length, think- ing it uncourteous, and supposing the stranger waited to be first addressed, Albert began a conversation by remarking that the insurrection seemed to be spreading fast, rather than diminish- ing; adding that, as a king's officer, he felt very sorry to think there might, by any possibility, arise a collision between the loyalists and the revolutionary party. The stranger looked at him disdainfully, and then turned away his eyes as he replied: "Let Alfred XIV know the truth, then. Let him understand what he is doing before it is too late. Courtiers hedge a monarch in from the importunities of facts. The man who is controlling that puppet, Louis of France, is the only man alive who seems to understand the    <pb n="68-69" xml:id="VAC6560-00000043"/> P)       DREAMS WITHN DREAMS. spirit of the age; and, cardinal as he is, he has more the spirit of the statesman in him, than all the fools who fill the Parlia- ment taken together. Let Sully's rebuke fit your courtiers: ' Sire,' said he to Louis, when the French courtiers tried to hold the grim old veteran up to ridicule in the royal presence, ' Sire, when the late king, your father, of glorious memory, did me the honor of entering into conversation with me on great and important affairs, he was wont, as a preamble, to make all the buffoons go out.'. Louis was sensible enough to order the courtiers to leave the room immediately. Now here is an in- surrection spreading every day. Let Alfred send all the jacka- napeses with gold lace " (here he eyed the young men contemp- tuously) " out of the window, and come and look for himself. His brother of France acted sensibly at least once in his life. Let King Alfred try, if he can, to do one wise thing before he dies." "You are malapert," said the young officer, highly offended. "That means," said the stranger, reining in his horse, and looking the other sternly in the face, "that means mischief, young man." "A  strange way of pleasing God. A   strange way,of pleasing God."  These words rang in the officer's ears, as virtue and vice wrestled within him. "Well?" said the stranger, after a pause. Albert looked at his fiiend, surprised at his irresolution. "I retract what I said," groaned the young man, as if the words burst from him in an agony. The stranger's lip curled. Albert looked scornfully at the young man. "Is it possible?" said he. "Can it be that you can tamely bear the insult of this vagabond without a word of rebuke?" "And whom mnay it please you to call by that title?" asked the stranger. "You," replied Albert fiercely. ' One will, suit as well as another," said the stranger. "You wish to insult me, then?" "You seem slow to learn!" replied Albert, more and more enraged every moment at the haughty scorn which spoke plainly in the expression of the stranger. "Enough," said the other, descending, fastening his horse to a tree, and talking deliberately all the while. "Enough. You wish, I see, to affront me. If you will have the kindness to dismount, we can settle this little matter at once."   DREAMS WITHB DREDEAMS.       69 Albert, his eyes flashing, leaped from his horse, and the two antagonists proceeded to divest themselves of their upper garments and their long riding boots.  The young officer vainly tried to interfere. He was treated with scorn by the other two equally. Fully determined at all costs to prevent the duel, he drew his sword, and swore he would drive it through the body of the stranger if he did not instantly retire. A scene of terrible confusion followed. With an oath, the stranger flung himself on the young man, and a deadly contest ensued. Before Albert could interfere, the young officer lay bleeding upon the grouna, while the stranger, seizing his gar- ments, leaped on his horse and disappeared in the forest. CHAPTER YII. OF A CONVERSATION ON BALLADS AND DIVERS OTHER DELECTABLE THNGS. "ET us now return to Bertrand Castle, where we will find our old friends, together with Father Wilfrid, and a certain Sir Wolfgang de Vere, a tall gentleman, with huge mustaches, and a bronzed skin, a cousin of my lord Clodolphus, who' had arrived on the day of reconciliation. Romanus, for reasons which the reader will easily guess, had departed on his way. And it came to pass that, the conversation having turned upon ballads, the Countess asked Sir Wolfgang if he could sing? "Yes, my lady," quoth the knight modestly, "if so that a harp can be had." That dulcet instrument being produced, Sir Wolfgang pro- ceeded to tune the same, and, after sundry clearings of his throat, he sang as follows: "OVE IS FOLLY. When Eleonora said me nay, I fled from her presence in grief away: "Alas!". in bitterness I did say, /           "All love is folly." 1 [Twinkled the stars in the azure sky, JgJ [But they seemed friom their heavenly thrones to cry: i          i "Like love we glitter, like love we fly, For love is folly."    <pb n="70-71" xml:id="VAC6560-00000044"/> 70       DREAMS WITHN DREAMS. And the streamlet babbled between its banks, Where at night the fateiie plays her pranks: "ILove," it cried, " is much pains and little thanks, For love is folly." When Eleonora came to me, And smiled as only smileth she, I straight forgat my miseric; For love is folly. Ah! the stars may speak, and the streams may cry, And reason mav plead from her throne on high. On the wings of love to heaven we fly ; Though- love be folly. "A  right good song," quoth my lord Clodolphus, "and right well sung, albeit pitched perlhaps a third of a note too high. I myself, though not blessed with a dulcet voice, am wont to sing when alone. I have evenl gone so far as to com- pose a ballad myself, on the rats who devoured a certain divine, who had taken refuge in a tower which is situated on an island washed by the Rhine. The gnawing of the vermin's teeth, is, I flatter myself, quite distinctly heard in one of my verses, wherein I make use of the words crunch, crick, and crack. It is quite an onomnatopceia. It jis much finer than the ,roXvq6krrf/3oLo 3aXkao'w'. The sound I rick-crack remind one forcibly of the rpLtXa re Kal TErpaX a orhe Iliad. Verily are ballads 'delectable. Verily are they amorous. Verily are they beloved. Erasmus (not your gobbler, Count, but the other) saith, 'Musicam docet amor,7 which may be given thus- Cupid is a music teacher. Sweethearts surely are wont to be pleased with the Hymeneus." (Here my lord Clodolphus ran up the octave with a grating voice.)  W We have Anacreon, who, according to my view, was a hoary-headed old rip, and again Ovid, whose books are not comely. Scurrilous tunes---" "Stop!" cried the Count. "What's the matter?" asked my lord Clodolphus. "Who'll bet that old porcupine don't choke himself within ten minutes, if he goes on?" demanded the Count. "I am not afraid," quo(th my lord Clodolphus. "I believe you," replied the Count. "I know you a'n't. But I am." "Be it so," quoth my lord Clodolphus; " but as it is of very small consequence which is right, suppose you permit me to ask Lady Nora for a song? I am sure she plays the harp, for two reasons, to wit: first, forasmuch as one is here, the which is exceeding strong presumptive evidence in favor of the idea;   DRElCAMS WITHN DREAMS.        71 and secondly, because ladies are wont to play thereon, for the double purpose of exhibiting their talents, and displaying the symmetrical proportions of their fair arms; which, I am told, being held in an upright position, as verily is needful wheu playing upon the dulcet instrument, are whiter than usual, owing to the blood being diverted from its ordinary clhan- nels " "For shame, my lord!" cried Nora; "I have a great mind to punish you for publishing your observations, by refusing to sing." "Nay, maiden," quoth my lord Clodolphus, " that, in sooth, would be false justice; seeing that you would likewise afflict the innocent. Therefore, as it is a known principle in edquity that it were better nine guilty men should suffer than one in- nocent man escape, you will proceed, madam, with your dulcet song." "No! she shan't for a minute," said the Count. "What do you mean by it is better nine guilty should suffer rather than one innocent man escape? Why shouldn't the innocent escape?" "Did I say so?" asked my lord Clodolphus. "Did you? Of course you did," replied the Count. "Verily, then, I made a lapsus lingue," quoth my lord Clodolphus. "You made a what?" asked the Count. "A lapsus linguce," replied my lord Clodolphus. "Well, don't make another," said the Count, who had not the slightest idea what a lapsus linguee meant. "' Men are wont to make mistakes," remarked my lord Clo- dolphus. "What saith Quintilian in the seventeenth book of his Oratorire Institutiones?" "What do I care?" said the Count, interrupting him testily. "I never saw such a fellow. Leave your books alone, and you won't talk nonsense. If your thick skull can let a moral through, take my advice, and drop that old trash your brain is so full of; and then you will always talk sense, as I do. Go on, Nora." And Nora went on: THE FOUNTAIN DEMON. Fair and slowly peeps the moon From the snowy mountain; Soft her cold and virgin rays Play o'er Dela's fountain.    <pb n="72-73" xml:id="VAC6560-00000045"/> 72       DREAMS WITHN DREAMS. II. From its breast pellucid up Comes the demon-maiden; Seeming like a soul forlorn, Sad and sorrow-laden. "I. Should a youth the fiend behold In her seeming sorrow, She will kiss his lips to-night, He will die to-morrow. IV. God protect the thoughtless youth From the haunted fountain, When serenely Phoebe peeps From the snowy mountain. "Verily," quoth my lord Clodolphus, when Nora had ended, "these ballads are not as simple as they might be. There is more in them than a superficial glance--such as our friend Bertrand," he continued, with a remembrance of the Count's late attack, " such as our friend Bertrand. would give, for example-" "You be hanged!" interrupted the Count. "I like im- pudence. You are a cool sort of a fellow. What the devil do you pitch into me, for?" "Never you mind," said my lord Clodolphus, majestically. "Ahl but I will mind," retorted the Count. "Just hear the man. I won't be pitched into for nothing." "Who is pitching into you?" asked my lord Clodolphus. "You are!" said the Count. "I am not," said my lord Clodolphus.  "Don't talk to me." "Why won't I talk to you, if I have a mind to?" said the Count. "I tell you I am not superficial. I would scorn to be so. I would just as soon think of being supernatural." "Very well," said my lord Clodolphus, testily. "Then we will say you are not., Anything to satisfy you." "Bless the man! he is actually angry," said the Count, looking about him with round eyes. "' He goes and calls me superficial, and then is angry because I say I am not. Now if this is not cutting it fat, I should like to know what is? Oh I what a splendid magpie was lost to the feathered world, Clo- dolphus, when you smuggled yourself into existence as a man." My lord Clodolphus, together with the rest of the company, laughed at this, and the learned man, merely remarking that a   DREAMS WrrHN  DREAMS.        73 magpie belonged to the genus corvus, as whoso listeth might read, proceeded: "As I said," quoth he, "superficial men, like our friend Bertrand," (here the Count gave a snort, and my lord Clodolphus a grin,) "do not ywiss comprehend the value of a ballad. Methinks they may be properly styled the traditions of nature, 'being sung before written, and known before published. The Germans-" ("Now we are going to have it," from the Count,) cultivated this taste very early; numbering in theip-ranks many excellent ditties and discrete minstrels, such as ' The Rhyme of St. Anno,' The Song of Hil- debrand,' 'Pfaffe Chunrat,' ' The Niebelungen Lied,' Hartman Von Aue and the goodly company of the Minnesingers.' The bards of Spain also are most delectable. Who has not read the Cid and El Conde Lucanor, to say nothing of Ber- nardo del Carpio, Alonzo de Aguilar, and the deeds of Or- lando. In Italy have we not the sublime Dante, the enchant- ing Tasso, the amorous Petrarch, and the divine Ariosto? May not France boast of her Thibault, her Regnier, and her Malherbe; which last hath written an ode to Louis XIII. on the occasion of his marching against Rochelle, which is verily fine. Finally-" "Ah,' muttered the Count, "we are near the end, are we?" "Finally," continued my lord Clodolphus, "literature, whether (as Slhakspeare hath it) tragical, comical, pastoral, pastoral-comical, historical-pastoral- -" "Won't somebody take that man to bed?" from the Count. A general giggle, during which my lord Clodolphus, keeping down his own inclination to laugh, proceeds solemnly. "Tragical-historical- " "Clodolphus!" from the Count. "Tragical-comical-historical-pastoral- " "Clodolphus!" "Scene individual, or poem unlimited- " "Unlimited! you may well say unlimited." "-Is nought at first but the current of history in unlettered times. All nations are alike, from the enlightened Italian to they anthropophagi of Florida. TWe have songs suited to all tastes-high tastes, low tastes, and no tastes; vulgar tastes, and refined tastes; from the Divine Comedy down tp the war song. For what saith Machiavel?

Therefore literature, whether historical, pastoral, tragical, comical- " Here the Count could stand it no longer, but jumped up in a great rage, when my lord Clodolphus threw himself back in a long and uncontrollable fit of laughter. The others joined so heartily, that after a moment the Count caught the infection and laughed too; remarking that he might have known it to be a jest, since nobody with a head on his shoulders could talk seriously in so diabolical a manner. And so harmony was restored. "These ballads, certainly," remarked Sir Wolfgang, quiet- ly, " are doubtless the parents of literature. But they are more. They appeal to the people with prodigious effect, for they appeal to their passions in their own tongue. In them are seen the most tender love, the most jovial glee, the most delicate pathos, the truest sense of honor, and the most sincere veneration for religion. The terrific side enforces the fear of offending Heaven far better on its hearers than the wisest homily. Hell is shown in its proper aspect. Despair is traced often with a master hand. Remorse is depicted visibly, forci- bly, frightfully. Even if we deny the supernatural horrors, we cannot but acknowledge that such terrors as the dread, for instance, which creeps over the guilty at midnight-the pale spectre with glassy eyes which pursues the assassin-the skele- ton phantom which lays its bony hand on its victim's heart until it embraces a corpse-ay, and the voice of outraged nature herself protesting against the long-protracted punish- ment of crime, as the whirlwind howls and wild shadows flit rapidly past the moon - that all these are better calculated to make the people understand the wrath of God than those abstract theories wherein the schools delight, and which can only reach the educated. If you are interested in ballads, I remember one well known in my native place, which I have tried to put to music. I will sing it to you with pleasure." The company having signified their curiosity, Sir Wolfgang took the harp and struck a few chords. The tune was simple and wild; sounding like the far-off murmur of the wind. ALBYO. I. Come hither, come hither, my daughter, Now hither come to me; Come hither, come hither, my daughter, And hear this history.   DREAMS WITHN DREAMS.             75 What story, O my mother, Wilt thou relate to-night? What story can it be, mother dear, That doth thy soul affright? I. For pale is thy cheek, dear mother, And ice-cola is thy hand. What moveth thee to terror Thou canst not even withstand? Wilt speak of love forsaken, Or lovers true and blessed, Or of conscience troubled and terrified When daylight hath died in the west? III. Or wilt thou tell of witches That ride beneath the moon When the mist envelops the mountain crest, And the forests bathe in gloom? Then tell me, dearest mother, That I may soothe thy pain, Nor let the love of thy daughter Pour forth a prayer in vain. IV. The history, my daughter, I will relate to-night, The history, my daughter, Which does my soul affright, Is not of love forsaken, Nor lovers true and blessed; But of conscience troubled and terrified When daylight hath died in the west. V. Nor is it of wicked witches That ride beneath the moon When the mist envelops the mountain crest, And the forests bathe in gloom. But it is of love and sorrow, Of constancy and trust, When the generous hopes of happy youth Did crumble into dust. VI. The night was dark and stormy, And the night was cold and sad, The hills were wrapt in the chains of frost, And the valleys in snow were clad. Isabelle looked out from the lattice, Her Albyo to greet: But the solemn gloom of the sombre night Lay sleeping beneath her feet. i'! ;j    <pb n="76-77" xml:id="VAC6560-00000047"/> T'6        DREAM8 WITHN DREAMS. VII. And she heard at length the tinkling Of her lover's lute on the snow, But it sounded more like a solemn dirge, Or the plaint of the ghosts below: "Oh waken, waken, lady mine, Oh waken, waken," quoth he, "For a long sad vale and a weary path Have I walked my true love to see. VIII. "Oh waken, waken, Isabelle, For my heart is cold and chill, And say thou lov'st me, Isabelle, Oh say thou lov'st me still." "Nay, Albyo! I know thee not, For Albyo's cheeks were red; But thy pale blue face is the face of one Who lieth with the dead." IX. "Pale are my cheeks, my lady, For a cold, damp couch is mine; Yet come to me, my own true love, For my heart was ever thine." "But, Albyo, thy very eyes Are glassy as in death." "Oh kiss them, gentle lady, They will brighten at thy breath." X. Then Isabelle stooped from her lattice, And kissed her lover dear; Then back she fell in her chamber, struck By an agony of fear. And they found her in the morning cold Upon her spotless bed; And they found him on the mountain, Cold, motionless, and dead. XI. In the churchyard there stood many By the grave of lovers twain; And the De Profundis was sung aloud For the souls of the just in pain. And, amid the mourners' orisons Rose the voice of Hermengild: ( Hearken," he cried, " to the wrath of God, For the blood that I have spilled. XII. "I met him, and I slew him, As to Isabelle he hied, And the cold, white snow of the upland glen With my rival's blood was dyed: And home I went exulting, And happy then was I; For I deemed-woe's me!-that I now should win A glance from my lady's eye.   DREAMS WITHN DREAMS.           " XIII. "And I knew not God would ask me- 'Where is thy brother slain? For his blood cries up to the judgment seat, And it may not cry in vain.' At the hour of one a horror Smote my spirit like to death, As if some unseen being fanned My cheek with its icy breath. XIV. "And I heard-my God!-a hollow voice Thrice summon me to hell; And it seemed to me, every time it spoke, I heard a funeral knell. And I heard the voice of Albyo call Revenge for a brother slain; And I knew my soul was branded With the infamy of Cain." xv. Thus Hermengild in terror spoke, As if something forced him e'er To tell the tale of his midnight deed, In the anguish of despair. Then Hermengild, when the tale was told Fell writhing on the ground, And over all a horror crept, And no one uttered a sound. XVI. Hermengild writhed, Hermengild shrieked, And no one stirred to aid; Foi Providence on woman and man A fetter of terror laid; And before the priest could shrive his soul, He, howling, gave up the ghost, And stood before the judgment seat 'Mid the great departed host. XVII. Child! Isabelle, my sister dear, Thus in youth and beauty died: And Isabelle and her Albyo They buried side by side. Said my lord Clodolphus, when this was finished: "Saint Augustine, in his De Civitate Dei, if I remember rightly, makes a remark to the effect that Providence does not always reward us here, lest we should become mercenary; nor always punish us, lest we should become servile; nor does God abso- lutely refrain altogether from visible retribution and rewards, lest the unjust should say there is no Providence." In fact, my lord Clodolphus shot not always wide of his mark in his quotations.    <pb n="78-79" xml:id="VAC6560-00000048"/> 4        L A 1 b WITU VXlElUl DKEASl.       a "It may be all very well to talk so," said the Count. "You are of course entitled to form your own opinions; but I differ from you on every point whatsoever, conceivable or in- conceivable. I deny everything you have said, from beginning to end. There is not an atom of truth in anything you have propounded." "How  can you say so?" asked my lord Clodolphus, settling himself down comfortably for a long argument. "How can you say so? Ask Father Wilfrid there about the De  Civitate Dei. I suppose Saint Augustine is a better theologian than you? The thing does not admit of dispute." "I tell you it does," said the Count. "You and your Saint Augustine, forsooth! How am I to know you ever read him? How am I to know, if you have, that you under- stand him? I am not going to be bullied by you or any other  man. Saint Austin, or Augustine, as you improperly call   . him-"        '  I do not," interrupted my lord Clodolphus.  "I beg your pardon," replied the Count, politely. "You ' are mistaken. Augustine may be, the short for Austin-I do not deny that-but it was not his name."  "Ask Father Wilfrid," cried my lord Clodolphus, 9very much excited. No! no!" said Father Wilfrid, laughing. "Settle these little disputes among yourselves."  "There!" said the Count; "' can't you see the very priest is laughing at you? Take my advice for once, and don't expose  yourself again." "Upon my word," began my lord Clodolphus, when the Count again interrupted him, saying: "You are entirely in the wrong, my poor Clodolphus I en- tirely in the wrong. The less you say the better." "Never, sir I never will I admit the idea that Austin and  Augustine are different names," said my lord Clodolphus. "Come," replied the Count, you have had the talk pretty much all to yourself this evening. Suppose you let me fire away a bit, just for variety." "Oh I go ahead!" cried my lord Clodolphus, perfectly dis- gusted, and throwing himself back in his chair with a bump that nearly broke the back out. Whereat the Count con- tinued : "My nephew," said he, " was named Austin-after me, they said; but seeing my name is Charles, the thing is not clearly *   DREAMS WITHN DREAMS.        79 made out. 'Why didn't you give him his name?' I asked the priest. 'So I did,' said he. 'No, you didn't,' said I. 'Excuse me. You called him Augustinus.' 'Well, it is all the same in Latin,' said he. 'Mighty comforting,' said I. 'I suppose you mean it is all the same in Greek ;'-an expression we use in our part of the world Mhen we find ourselves in a box. ' But you have a right, in foro conscientice, to call him Austin," said he. 'Oh! I have, have I?' said I. 'I am very glad to hear it, because I intended to do so, anyhow. However, since you admit his name is Austin in foro conscientice (whatever that means), I have nothing more to say.' So it was I learned the right name was Austin, and not Augustine. You see, my poor Clodolphus, you are not always right; although I admit  that, generally speaking, you are not a bad hand at Julius Caesar and the rest of them, when you are sober, for a man in your station of life." "And what," inquired my lord Clodolphus, majestically waiving discussion, " what makes you suppose me mistaken in my understanding the De Civitate Dei?" "The fact." answered the Count, "that I do not believe Saint Austin ever wrote a ballad in his life." "And who said he did? ' demanded my lord Clodolphus. "Why, you did," replied the Count. "I?" cried my lord Clodolphus, petrified. "I? I said Saint Augustine--" Austin," corrected the Count. "Augustine!" cried my lord Clodolphus, heavily bringing his fist down on the table, and shaking it afterward, being greatly pained thereby. I said the holy Bishop of Hippo wrote ballads?" "I didn't hear you say anything about the Bishop of Hippo," replied the Count. ' Why don't you keep to the point?" "So I am," said my lord Clodolphus. "You are not," said the Count. "The Bishop of Hippo," began my lord Clodolphus. "I don't want to hear a word about the chap," said the Count. "Do you know who he was?" asked my lord Clodolphus. "No, and I don't want to," replied the Count. "Very well," snorted my lord Clodolphus. "As I was saying," resumed the Count, "I didn't hear you say anything about the Bishop of Hippo, but I know what    <pb n="80-81" xml:id="VAC6560-00000049"/> 80       DREAMS WTTHN  DREAMS.            . you said about Saint Austin. Do you mean to tell me you did not, when you quoted from the man not five minutes ago?" "Why," replied my lord Clodolphus, " cannot a man quote from an author without quoting verse? Do you possibly    '; fancy I think the De Civitate Dei to be a madrigal or a con- i1:i vivial song, with Tol lol de rol chorus?            -Jt "' I don't care a snap about all that," answered the Count. i' I only know what you said. If you don't mean things, don't   41 say them. How the deuce am I to know what you mean?"??    j To this my lord Clodolphus answered nothing, wrapping    ;  himself up in silence and compassionate dignity, until he retired I MA for the night.                         : Now one of the Count's many peculiarities (and goodness  l;: knows he had enough of them) was to rise very early, rousing .: it his wife by his intense efforts to move quietly. He would then i'! prowl round the park before breakfast, when it was fine weather, 'A: with a big stick in his hand, doing a very little work and a \.-? very great deal of mischief in a small way. The gardener fol- lowed his master for the sole purpose of arranging all he disar- ranged, rearranging all he arranged, doing all he undid, and undoing all he did; for the Count was no proficient in horticul- g ture, although, to use his own words, he was " some at fixing." . X On the morning following the arrival of Sir Wolfgang, as the Count was busier than ever in his grave duties, wherein he    i resembled, as my lord Clodolphus told him in one of their innumerable discussions, "an ape employed in imitating the   :;; acts of a man, as those beasts those beasts are pleasantly described doing in ' divers well written tomes," it suddenly occurred to him that Nora had never communicated the reason why her father     ,, wished to lie concealed from his friends ; together with a certain indescribable shadow of a suspicion that he (the Count) had not acted as wisely as he might have done. "For," argued that   Al; worthy gentleman, " it stands to reason that the servants must X':} suspect something is going on. I wish I had not removed them  ,;. so suddenly." Now, it was the Count's custom, as it is that of . l some other people, fully to understand a thing had occurred after he knew it had happened; but never, by any accident, to ;; look an inch before his nose into fuiturity. This method of con ducting his affairs, although not in itself the wisest, was decidedly : beneficial in the Count's case; since, whenever that gerleman ;a attempted to look prudently into the fuiture, he invariathly made matters much worse than when he sailed smoothly down the current of time without troubling himself about what was to  i i '   DREAMS WITHN DREAMS.         81 come. Had he always, or even often, used forethought, there can be no doubt his affairs would long since have been considerably involved. So, having concluded that he might have acted more sagaciously in his well-meant efforts to aid the exile, he charac- teristically forgot all about it, and sent for Nora. In due tinle the young lady descended, when the Count inquired into the matter at once. Nora replied that her father feared Godfroy, and proceeded to tell him all the reader already knows.                       m I My father," concluded the young girl, with tears in her eyes, " seems so overpowered, so timid, so very much changed, that I do not think you would know him again. The Duke of Uphorn himself did not. His old friend met him lately, face to face, and even inquired the way of him, without recognizing him at all; and father had not the heart to tell his old brother at arms who he was. He is so fearful of Godfroy (I don't know why, I amL sure; for, if ever there was a true man, God- froy is he), that he will not tell me his place of residence, though I know it must be near. How could I deny my poor old father his request, even if it were unreasonable? Oh, Count! You have some influence with him. I wish you would persuade him to live in the castle. I am so frightened sometimes, especially since I heard that robbers infested the neighborhood-" "The deuce you have!" said the Count. "What!" asked Nora, " have you not heard of them?" "This is the very first time I ever heard the thing men- tioned," replied the Count. "Is it possible?" said Nora. "Possible!" cried the Count. "' Oh I you know it as well as I do. Possible! Just hear the girl! How the devil could I have heard of it? Nobody ever tells me anything." "I thought you knew it," remarked Nora, gently. "The girl is mad!" cried the Count. "Thought I knew it! Do you suppose, if I knew it, I would not have been at them long ago? What have I done to be surrounded by free- booters? And there is your father-right in the middle of them, no doubt, by this time, dressed in a sugar-loaf hat, and with all sorts of fixings round, his calves. Here, Peter I Samuel! Peter! go call Master Clovis, and Sir Wolfgang, and my lord Clodolphus! Hurry, you scoundrels, or I'll break the heads of every mother's son of you! Robbersl I have no doubt but they have had their eyes on my hens. Ha I Peter 4*    <pb n="82-83" xml:id="VAC6560-00000050"/>    did not have far to run. Here they are. Run, Nora., quick, to the Countess, and tell her to hurry up breakfast, as we are going out after banditti." "But she is asleep," pleaded Nora. "Shake her!" replied the Count. "That's my way; and I find it generally answers. Shaltke her like the devil." "I .will see to breakfast myself," said Nora. ' Well, do as you like, child; only be quick," replied the Count, dismissing her withl a kiss on her forehead. Said my lord Clodolphus, waggishly, as the gentlemen came up: "Ha, Bertrand! you are at it early." "Early!" repeated the Count. "Early! I believe you. It is well there is somebody here to get up early. Why, it is a miracle we were not all murdered in our beds." "What is the matter?" asked the three gentlemen at once. "Matter!" cried the Count. "' Matter! Robbery-con- flagration--arson-assassination-pillage-rape--and hen-steal- ing. All sorts of tlings." "But," asked Clovis, who was used to his father's ways, , what are the particulars?" "Particulars I " replied the Count. "Who cares for partic- ulars when the very ducks are already invested, and the geese are in a state of siege; when martial law must be proclaimed in the barnyard, and vigilant sentinels posted over the hen- coops? Let me tell you, I am not going to lose my hens, to say nothing of my wife-and, confound it! she is a considera- tion-for all the freebooters in the universe and out of it too. There is a gang of the vagabonds somewhere about, and they have already, no doubt, cast their coveteous eyes on my coops." "Why, I could have told you that a mouth ago," said my lord Clodolphus. "Oh, you could, could you?" replied the Count. "So could I, if I had known it." "But I not only knew it, but even warned you only last week," continued mly lord Clodolphus. "If I have told you once, I have told you fifty times. But you never pay the slightest attention to my observations."7 "I know I don't," answered the Count. "What the devil's the use? Do you suppose I am going to bother my head about what you say? By George, sir I the fiend himself would have trouble to understand you at times-to say nothing of a respectable man past sixty."   "But how about the robbers?" said Clovis. ", Ah!" cried. the Count; "we must look to the hens at once." "Are there not things more important than hens, father?" asked Clovis. "And what, pray?" inquired the Count. "The peasantry they may plunder," replied his son, "the travellers they may rob, the women they may carry away, and the property they may destroy. ' ;' Oh! ah! to be sure," said the Count, scratching his head; "I suppose so." "Yet," quoth my lord Clodolphus, " while we take care of all these, we are not wrong in providing also for the trifling comforts of life. The poultry, I trow, should verily be pro- tected." "Bravo, old folio!" cried the Count. "You are getting on, andt may turn out something better than a fool, in your old age, after all. I never gave you credit for so much sense. By the by, there's Piquemont- " "Where?" asked Clovis, very much startled, and looking round; for the tone of his father's remark led him to suppose Piquemont might be hid somewhere in the vicinity-say behind the barn. "Oh, you born fool," replied his affectionate relative, wrath- fully. "Where?   Nowhere. I mean he is among these scapegraces."                  t "Do you mean to say," inquired my lord Clodolphus, sur- prised, " that the Count of Piquemont has turned bandit?" Looking at himn with a wistful and sorrowfully admiring look, the Count replied:             . "I have long thought that when your good mother, of bustling memory, invited the fairies to your christening, she omitted one; who, consequently, angry at the slight, after tt-e others had graced you with health, courage, and learning, spoiled all by declaring you should never use those gifts for any useful purpose." "Good," said my lord Clodolphus, who liked a simile, and felt complacent at the idea of the Count's admitting him to be in the possession of health, courage, and learning. "Good , Bertrand I Fire away!" "Those gifts," repeated the Count, "' for any useful purpose, like Cassandry-" "Cassandra," said my lord Clodolphus, correcting him.    <pb n="84-85" xml:id="VAC6560-00000051"/> 84       DREAMS WITHN DIEAM3S. "I won't be interrupted," replied the Count, wrathfully; '"Cassandry it is, and Cassandry shall it remain. After your calling Austin, Augustine--" "That was rig}lt," quoth my lord CUodolphus. "Poohl, pooh!" said the Count. "But I don't care. Cas- sandry, as I call her, or Cassander as you-" "Cassandra," quoth my lord Clodolphus. "Well, Cassanderrer then, if that will satisfy you," said the . :-s Count, fietfully; "Cassalldry or Cassanderrer, Austin or Augus- tine, you are like a tulb without a bottom."  "Without a what?" asked my lord Clodolphus.       .;^4 "' Without a bottom," replied the Count. "How am I without a bottom?" asked my lord Clodolphus.  , "'Oh! you know as well as I do," replied the Count.    .. "Learned nmen like you-I don't mind admitting you are one-  . should have the sense to keep all the stuff they scrape out of . l books to themselves, and not be leaking and spoiling every society they are in, by dribbling, dribbling pieces of Julius C3esar - all over the conversation."  "You do not understand the value of educationl," remarked my lord Clodolplhus.          -            ] "No, I don't," replied the Count, shortly. "Here you   ':: are, a man with some pretension to learning, just talking like a : fool. What ldo you mean by standing thfere, looking as much . like an amiable owl without feathers as a, man can do, asking a : sensible person whether the most honorable noble of the land is :-! a cutthroat? Now I suppose you are going to be angry. It   - l would be just like you, if you were. A man cannot address a  ! few polite remarks to you, without your becoming as red as a boiled lobster."           :            : "You lhave a strange way of being polite," quoth my lord Clodolphus.                          .iH "Oh, incied!" answered the Count, loftily. "You liave  ; your opinion. I have mine. You have- your way of doing things. I have my way. That's my way. And." he concluld- ed, still more loftily, " if any gentleman does not like my way, ; he is quite welcome to lump it." "But," here Sir Wolfgang struck in, "but we must not  leave Piquemont where lie is for another day." "Very good," replied the Count, calmly; "but do you  know why Jack would not eat his supper?" "No, I do not," said Sir Wolfgang.    . "Who was Jack?" inquired my lord Clodolphus, always thirsty for information. ::J i! 1 i   DREAMS WITHN DREAMS.        85 How. should I know?" replied the Count. "Well, Jack wouldn't eat his supper, because he could not get it. Now, you won't remove Piquemont because you can't get at him. Why can't you get at him? Because he a'n't to be got at. You can't find him." "jVon est inventus, eh?" quoth my lord Clodolphus. "Come," replied the Count; "you be still, or else talk sensibly." "Still," continued Sir Wolfgang, " there can be no harm in trying, I suppose." "Perhaps not," replied the Count, with a sniff. "' Then what do you say," pursued the knight, " to yourself and my lord Clodolphus going together to find his where- abouts?" The Count rested both of his hands on his big stick, and looked Sir Wolfgang in the eyes. "If," said he, impressively, "if you wish to bid me farewell forever, do that. Do it, and never behold me more. Why that ma n would kill me in twenty minutes, if we were alone together. See I he is chuckling over the idea already, and licking his bloated lips like a cow." "What a man you are, Bertrand!" said my lord Clodolphus, grinning. The Count reciprocated the grin, and Sir Wolfgang continued : "Then, suppose," said he, " my lord Clodolphus and I go." "Cannot I accompany you?" suggested Clovis. "I think it would be better not," remarked Sir Wolfgang, quietly. "One of the two ought to be an old friend of Pique- mont's, and I think it would' be best if the other were not so interested a party as yourself; if you will excuse my saying so." "Don't mention it," replied Clovis. "If you think so, that is enough." "I really do," said the knight. "I can put the case to the old' man more calmly, and consequently more plainly. Then I amr more intimate with Godfroy than you. Altogether I think, if Clodolphus is willing, we are the best fitted for the search; as indeed I thought at first, only I wished to hear the Count's opinion." "But why cannot you and I go?" asked the Count. "Perhaps," began Sir Wolfgang, "Clodolphus being in Uphorn's confidence-" "Oh 1 ah!" said the Count. "Well, and what do you say Clodolphus?"    <pb n="86-87" xml:id="VAC6560-00000052"/> 86       DREAM]S WITHN DREAMS. Now the gentleman referred to was willing enough; but, wishing to punish the Count for his late roughness, he deter- mined to give a little trouble. Accordingly, after a fr w pre- liminary hems and haws, lie answered: "You see, Bertrand, there are many things to be taken into consideration."  "I don't see one," replied the Count. "Wait," remarked my lord Clodolphus, with dignity. "First, we must ask ourselves what is this investigation's aim, 'I! purpose, motive, end, reason, idea, intention, design, conse. quence, and object?"                    % "Well," said the Count, impatiently, " what of it?"   . "Wait,' reiterated my lord Clodolphus, waving the Count *q: away with his hand. "Secondly-hem---if we assume the aim to be honest, the purpose good, the end attainable,- the motive ? proper, the reason sound, the idea sensible, the intention charita- ., ble, the design discreet, the consequence happy, and the object ; lawful, are we certain this prudent aim, good purpose, attainable 'A: end, proper motive, sound reason, sensible idea, charitable--" a "Oh! for the love of all your honor," cried the Count, to X Sir Wolfgang and Clovis, " let us gird up our loins and flee. If this is only the second consideration, we shall be insane be- : fore that man reaches the fortieth; and there are a hundred, I ^ bet, if there is one."                     X Sir Wolfgang and Clovis at this burst out laughing, which :- merriment served to augment the Count's exasperation. "t ow can you stand there chuckling," said he, " when you ?: hear that infernal chattering? Ask him if he means yes or no, will you, somebody? Ask him, Clovis." "Will you?" asked Clovis, laughing. "Ah!" replied my lord Clodolphus, with a solemn wink. "Ah! as Shakspeare saith, ' To be or not to be, that is the : i question.' A'n't it, Bertrand?"          f  The Count did not answer a word. "You see, Bertrand," continued my lord Clodolphus, " as Julius Caesar says in his Commentaries-" But the Count was gone. At the hated name of COasar, he  decamped speedily, leaving the others to follow at their leisure, which they did merrily. During breakfast the whole party discussed the mlanceuvre, wherein every one, of course, had something to say, and wherein the quiet way of Sir Wolfgang, his clear head and patient good sense, shone so well that even the Count felt he was the man to   DREA MS IrrHN DREAMS.        87 do the thing, if it was possible to do it. Indeed, so practical was the way he put the case, so cheerfully he spoke, so piously he trusted in Providence, that he quite won'Nora's esteem, and, had not her heart been already surrendered to Clovis, we can. not say what Sir Wolfgang might or might not have done, had he chosen. But he thought little of winning the favor of ladies. As chivalrous a gentleman as any knight errant who ever put lance in rest, his affections had been long buried in the grave of his young wife. But to come back and not ramble, let us briefly say that to Sir Wolfgang was left the superintendence of the whole affair; although, of course, not without much learned advice from my lord Clodolphus, to which the knight listened patiently and cheerfully, trying, without success, to see how the remarks of that learned man bore upon the subject. The counsel of my lord Clodolphus was, of course, frequently interrupted by the Count's impatience; but, on the whole, the breakfast may be said to have passed over harmoniously, and soon after our two adventurous friends made preparation for departure. Sir Wolf- gang was already in the saddle, conversing with Clovis and Nora, who stood by the door caressing the knight's dog Romu. lus-that is, whenever the gayety of that animal would permit the liberty; for, as is the wont of dogs, he was perfectly wild with joy, in prospect of the excursion,-when my lord Clodol- phus, who was slow to act, made his appearance. With him came the Count, the two loudly discussing as they walked as to lwhether the holy Bishop of Hippo was called Augustine or Austin; my lord Clodolphus holding to the former, the Count to the latter hypothesis. CHAPTER V1II. WHEREIN MY LORD CLODOLPUS AND SIR WOLFGANG DE VERE SET FORTH ON THEIR FAMOUS EXPEDITION. Now my lord Clodolphus on his stout horse Neptune, and Sir Wolfgang de Vere, knight, on his good charger Cincinnatus, together with the dog Romulus, set fbrth from Castle Bertrand to gather knowledge concerning the cruel banditti, and to rescue,    <pb n="88-89" xml:id="VAC6560-00000053"/> 88       DREAMS WITHN DREAMS. if need might be, the noble Count of Fiquemont from their hands. Already the saffron morn, covered with early blushes, had risen refulgent from the couch of Tithonus, and gilded the courts of heaven with newhorn day, as forth through the ancient forest rode the adventurous gentlemen. The gallant beasts, Neptune and Cincinnatus, nimbly went their way, arching their necks and throwing' out their legs right horsefully ; while the dog Romulus bounded along before, wagging his bushy tail and barking boisterously. 'Twas then, at the hour sacred to conversation, that my lord Clodolphus philosophically gave mouth. "Will you tell me, Wolfgang," he asked, " why you call your horse Cincinnatus, and your dog, Romulus? For verily am I puzzled to account for the appellation." "For the same reason, I suppose," answered Sir Wolfgang, smiling, "that you call your horse Neptune. The animals. wanted a name, and one is about as good as another." "Verily are you mistaken," quoth my lord Clodolphus; "man, being a rational animal, should always have a reason for everything he does."  "And what, pray, was your reason for calling your horse Neptune?" asked the other. Said my lord Clodolphus: "My dear young friend, there can be no name more appropriate for the quadruped in ques-  I tion. When Cecrops, the reputed son of Vulcan-or Tubal Cain, as certes divers linguists do guess him to be, right cun- ningly,-built the city of Athens, both Minerva and Neptune  disputed who should give a name to the infant metropolis; con- cerning the early part of which city, I refer you to Strabo, Solinus, Pliny, and divers others. Now Cecrops is supposed to be an Egyptian, who built the fortress afterward ycleped the Acropolis, and improved the natives considerably. We are not, therefore, astonished to hear that Neptune, an African deity, should be represented as contending with Minerva, the  aboriginal goddess of the Pelasgi (?)-as the whole legend, if we  free ourselves from the perplexity of names, tends to show that there was a dispute originally as to whether the city should live by piracy or agriculture; Neptune representing the earlier pur- suits of Cecrops, and Athene, or horticulture, representing the attractions of peace. Now, there is verily no time when a man is more disposed to quiet than when he has stolen some- thing, and wants to keep it. Neptune accordingly was beaten;  the tradition telling us that the gods, who were arbitrators -   DREAMS WITHN DREAMS.        89 between him and the blue-eyed goddess, preferred the olive emblem of peace to the equine allegory of war. Hence call I my quadruped Neptune; nor is the name less useful as typical of the ocean, which, in its turn, is again typical of our pas- sions; being unstable, treacherous, and moved by every wind and current." "Bravo!" cried the knight. "Out of a horse you have made wonders." "Wonders!" repeated my lord Clodolphus; " why, Wolf- gang, you do not understand the philosophy of trifles. Verily, my boy, it is precisely by taking care of trifles that we come to perfection-to which point, I regret to say, there is no short cut-no royal road to geometry, as said Euclid to thingumbob." "But might we not look too much to trifles?" asked Sir Wolfgang. "Of course," quoth my lord Clodolphus, profoundly; " tlere's Bertrand, for instance, with his hens. But a hen lays eggs for all that; and lie who uses no eggs can have no omelet. Verily," continued my lord Clodolphus, very much struck by his own brightness, " verily am I a great man. Verily am I a philoso- pher. That saying will go down to posterity. Verily is it laconic. Verily is it pithy. Verily is it epigrammatical. He who uses no eggs can have no omelet! What a beautiful expres- sion? He who uses no eggs can have no omelet I Verily must I note it down at the earliest convenient opportunity." "Then," said S;r Wolfgang, laughing, "I will continue to call my horse Cincinatus, to remind me that patriotism must be guided by the reins of reason, or it will always go to the stable -which is an allegorical way of typifying the spoils of office, sinecures, and the like. Moreover, the dog shall keep his name, since he is a wolf hound, and that will remind me Romulus was suckled by a wolf." Said my lord Clodolphus thereat: "A good conceit, albeit the tradition is not as weil founded as others." "Never mind," remarked the other, incautiously. At which terrible heresy my lord Clodolphus became rigid with indignation. "Never mind " quoth he; " why, Wolfgang, I am ashamed of you."O "Why?" asked that gentleman. "Why!" replied my lord Clodolphus. "Can 'you ask me why? Is it nothing to know the truth?" "But of what earthly consequence can it be, how the infant founder of Rome sucked?" urged Sir Wolfgang. V    <pb n="90-91" xml:id="VAC6560-00000054"/> 90       DREAMS WITHN DREAMS. "Why has nature put your head on your shoulders?" answered my lord Clodolphus. "To contain a brain. Why a brain? To be able to think. Why to think? To be able    9 to judge. Why to judge? Because you possess information. And why, verily, has your lamented father expended so much money on your education, if you are never to make use there- of? See history. What a mass of contradictions it possesses! One says ' yes; ' another, ' no;' another, 'I cannot say.' Behold the sublimest dramas enacted by man neglected and forgotten. Scepticism has blighted them with a sneer. Behold the foun- ! dations of morality shaken from their centre. Scepticism has been the earthquake. Behold the ramparts of religion be- sieged by the cohorts of heresy, infidelity, and hatred. Scepti- cism has marshalled and arrayed this formidable host. 'Ad- spice nobilissimarum civitatum fundamenta vix notabilia; has ira dejecit.' Ah! but Seneca, when he spake of wrath, verily little knew its power; for it works hardest against truth, : whether historical, political, moral, or religious."  "And how does all this apply to me?" asked Sir Wolf- gang, wondering whether he was to come under the head of  the ruthless invaders of civilization, the malignant propagators ? of unbelief, or the savage destroyers of peace.  How can you be so absurd," replied my lord Clodolphus,  fretfully. "I mean that you should want to know all about  i Romulus, if you are not gone mad."             I "And so I do," said Sir Wolfgang, anxious to appease his  good cousin's wraith. "Ah!" replied my lord Clodolphus, a little more gra-  ciously, "if you do, that is quite another affair. What I hate  is talk."  Sir Wolfgang looked up surprised, for he was startled not only by the suddenness of the remark and his own inability to see what bearing it had on the sulject, but also by the extreme ; wildness of the idea that his cousin loved silence. "What I hate is talk," repeated my lord Clodolphus, com- placently. Albeit I have no objection to use my lungs when.  ever I can do so to the advantage of an intelligent audience, which, verily, I am thankful to say, is of frequent occurrence. So now in sooth will I proceed to enlighten your understanding with a few humble remarks. All legends agree in placing the Palatine as the original site of Rome. Let us now suppose a Sabine town, built upon the neighboring Quirinal-whence Quirites,--.and let us call this rival city the party contending   DREAMS WITHN DREAMS.        91 with Rome for the mastery. Palium and Quirium stand now before us, ready to cut each other's throats. Do you follow?" "Yes," replied Sir Wolfgang, good naturedly. "Do so," quoth my lord Clodolphus. "Verily I have in- vented the name Palium, but for reasons which you will soon perceive. For I hold it, in sooth, a goodly method to put a case clearly, everybody else to the contrary notwithstanding." "Certainly," said Wolgfang. "A clear case," pursued my lord Clodolphus, profoundly, "is only clear when not obscure.' "Of course," remarked the other. "And consequently," continued my lord Clodolphus, dog- matically, "the clearer you put a thing, the less obscure it is necessarily." "To be sure," murmured the knight. "Palium is not a bad name, quoth my lord Clodolphus. "It is a very good name," said Sir Wolfgang. "A very good name," continued my lord Clodolplihd. "Then why not use it?" "Why not?" said the other. "A thing has to have a name, and hence I call thio Palium, just in the same way that Priam called his children severally, Hector, Paris, Laocoon, Deiphobus, Helenus, Troilus, Creusa, Cassandra, and the like." "I agree with you," said Sir Wolfgang. "We have, then,9 continued my lord Clodolphus, "'two rival cities, to wit, Palium on the Palatine, and Quirium on the Quirinal. The sovereigns of the respective kings meet in the Comitium, between the Palatine and Capitoline hills, and there the two allied senates assemble. Thus the twins Romulus and Remus exist, fight, and, in the end, Romulus, or Palium, conquers, and all becomes Rome." "Certainly," said Sir Wolfgang. "The wolf, doubtless," continued my lord Clodolphus, "originated in the festival of the Lupercal-for the honor of' animrals is a thing which comes down to us from the earliest ages-introduced, Livy tells us, by Evander from Arcadia, wherein the young men ran about naked, in honor of Pan Lycaeus. We may regard the myth of Silvia and her chil- dren, their being cast into the Tiber, overturned at the root of a fig tree, rescued by a wolf, fed by a woodpecker, (by the way, verily, there is one while we speak,) carried by Faustulus to Acca Laurentia, and brought up by shepherds-we may f          -    <pb n="92-93" xml:id="VAC6560-00000055"/> 92       DREAMS WITHN DREAMS. regard all this, I say, as nonsense, if we choose; and, if we do not choose, we may believe every word of it; for, verily, this is a land of liberty, and one wherein freedom of thought, if not expressed, is universally admitted and inculcated." As my lord Clodolphus thus spoke, who should come toward them but Doctor Owen on a gray mare?   As he  came up, my lord Clodolphus accosted him, but the other excused himself, saying that a young man who had been wounded in a duel required his aid. So cheerfully bidding them good morning, the Doctor put spurs in his horse, and trotted off.  "I was thinking, Wolfgang," said' my lord Clodolphus, after they had continued on their way awhile in silence, I was  thinking I have been talking a great deal this morning." "I wonder if he has just found it out?" thought the knight, who remarked aloud, "Oh, not too much." "No, not too much," replied. the other, complacently. "Of course not that; but a great deal, nevertheless. Now I want you to tell me one thing frankly." "What is it?  "Your opinion on duelling." Sir Wolfgang looked very grave, not to say bitter. "Ah,  Clodolphus I " he said, " it is only one of those sins which are sugared over by society. There is not a single crime which is not tolerated, nay, cultivated, in the highest circles. There : Paris is applauded, and Cain called a hero. The only distinc- tion, in my mind, is in favor of the open villain, for he, at least, pays the penalty of his offence. Ay I the miserable outcasts,  branded with ignominy, shunned by respectability, and whose idea of law is not a protecting but a revengeful minister, these are not all who must answer for theft and murder, vice and  profligacy, dishonor and licentiousness. Shame governs the  palaces, the ball rooms, the banks, the counting houses and ex- changes, as powerfully as where it lies festering in the foul  haunts where squalor and crime stalk openly in their repulsive ugliness." "'You have spoken manfully and well," replied my lord Clodolphus, looking proudly at his cousin, whom he admired and loved more than any other being. "I am sure whatever you ever do is worthy of yourself; and higher praise, my dear boy, I can verily. give no man." Modestly bowing and blushing like a young girl, Sir Wolf- gang replied nothing. Indeed, my lord Clodolphus, when he   DREAMS WITHN DREAMS.        93 chose, could speak a great deal of sense, and had a heart big enough to accommodate something besides his library. And thus talking, the two went their way pleasantly. Now, they had first resolved to bend their way toward Toservem's inn, rightly supposing a public house, as the centre of gossip, might furnish them with some useful information. So they rode straight there, and, alighting from their horses Nep tune and Cincinnatus, went in with the dog Romulus; who forthwith attacked the cat with a view to worrying the same- he being a sprightly dog, and wont to chase, bite, bay, harass, and otherwise ill treat cats, both tom and tabby, whenever the possibility of so doing was feasible. The cat, who had made a gothic arch of herself; as cats are wont to do when attacked, was rescued from her canine foe by the summary process of dragging that sagacious animal away by the tail; who thereupon stretched himself before the fire with his tongue lolling out, and his countenance expressing an amiable satisfaction with the world without, and the calls of conscience within. Quiet being restored, our two friends had leisure to look about them. Father Wilfrid was sitting by the fire, and now greeted them warmly. The three, together with Ernest, then sat down and talked of the crops, Squire Flint's last baby, the insurrection, and other matters of the like village importance. At length Ernest mentioned the appearance of the beggar, and the offer of the stranger with the very dirty bandage. Now, at the mention of the beggar, Sir Wolfgang, who had been revolving in his mind how he should naturally bring Piquemont into the conversation, pricked up his ears most blithely; the more so when the priest remarked mildly: "I thought he was only a poor, half-witted person, until a few days ago." "And a'n't he?" inquired Ernest. "No," replied Father Wilfrid. "On the contrary, he is a man of great strength of character." "So you have seen him?" said Ernest. "I have," answered the priest. "A few days ago, as I was returning from a sick call, where a poor fellow was lying dangerously ill of a fever-" "Nothing catching, I hope?" said Ernest, edging off a little. The good priest smiled and shook his head. "I must do my heavenly Master's will," he said, "and in it I fear no harm  but I was not sent to endanger my flock."    <pb n="94-95" xml:id="VAC6560-00000056"/> "      DREAMS -WITHN DREAMS. Sir Woligang and my lord Clodolphus, touched by the old man's gentleness and simplicity, looked at Father Wilfrid with interest, who continued:    : ': I was returning, when I was caught in a sudden shower  of rain, just as I stopped to speak to him. Seeing I was old, . and the rain heavy, he invited me to his dwelling, adding that,  if poor, it was at least a shelter."           'i1 "And where does he live?" inquired Ernest.      ig "' My son," replied the priest, gently, "I must know more X of that stranger before I answer. A thousand marks are not offered without a motive; 'but, if it will ease your mind any, I Ad assure you I will communicate with his friends as soon as I 1 think it proper-."                     : Whereupon Ernest scratched his head (as is the wont of  : your innkeeper all over the world), and looked as if it would;lS ease his mind a great deal more if he hlad in his pocket that  share of the marks especially to be reserved for his own use .g and profit. But the entrance of two other guests, announced Aid by Romulus, who evidently considered their appearance as an : intrusion, and an insult to be barked at, drove the thought in. stantly from his mind.           ..n One was a dismal, wretched little man, whom his companion called Ebenezer; the other was a short but grotesquely stout gentleman, who looked like a badly made keg, and rejoiced in .j the name of Smaragdus. The dismal, wretched little man was  pot bellied and bandy legged. His face looked always as if he had just taken a bite out of an uncommonly sour apple, and he  was constantly complaining of a sore head. Nor, indeed, were i his lamentations confined to any particular part of his carcass; a for, according to his own account, there never was a person so persecuted by disease since the demise of Job--a party less g afflicted than Ebenezer, as that injured man was willing to swear for a slight remuneration.             X Smaragdus was a hero of another stamp. If he had a neck, he kept it at home stowed away somewhere; for he was never ! seen abroad with anything distantly approaching one. He  j was a solemn man, with a big head, like a squash, and no end of stomach. He was a grave man, who never laughed except at his own jokes, which were undoubtedly excellent and un- questionably unintelligible. He was a severe man, and would inform Ebenezer that he had talked enough by fetching him a  crack over the head with any handy article within reach. He talked little, and that little generally consisted in asking for l,!   DRECA'MS WXITHN DREAMS.       95 something to cat or drink. He sat down on a chair when he entered, and broke it. He sat upon another, and broke that. He was then accommodated with a third, which did not break. After this he never moved or spoke, except to call in a husky voice for beer and tobacco; but sat puffing his pipe and im- bibing malt- liquor in a dignified, not to say stupid, silence. Ebenezer, however, who was give,; to talk, entered at once into the circle of conversation, and made divers observations in a treble key. It was not as interesting as it might have been, owing to his constant recurrence to his sore head and general debility. So he talked, the priest sympathized, Sir Wolfgang yawned, and my lord Clodolphus thought of something else; although the latter gentleman looked so interested that the wretched little man addressed nine tenths of his remarks to him. Ernest, meanwhile, sat watching with a serene expres- sion the cataracts of beer which plunged foaming down the mouth of the silent Smaragdus, and calculating his dimensions as if he were a tub or a hogshead. And here we may as well remark that the newcomers were masons-not free, but brick and mortar-and had come down to work for Lord Godfroy. Ebenezer always accom- panied his friend Smaragdus on his rounds like a moon; for the little gentleman's tongue was apt to get him into trouble, and Smaragdus was a good protection. Now my lord Clodolphus, who had been silent for some time, and who would rather talk with an idiot than not talk at all, seeing that, for some reason, Sir Wolfgang prolonged bis stay, turned to the wretched little man and said : "Tell me, friend, if any very curious thing has happened lately in the neighborhood? And mind you say nothing of your sore head, which we will take for granted; for, to confess the truth, I am not curious myself on the matter." The wretched little Ebenezer grinned and replied: "Oh! I know everything that passes. Oh! I can tell you all about everything. Oh I if there is an entertaining thing occurring, I am just the man to know it." "And just the man, too, to tell it all round, I fancy," said my lord Clodolphus. "Suppose' you leave out your 'ohs,' which are as tedious as your sore head. Verily, friend, you are as nervous as a cat on a hot pan. Cannot you tell a story without wriggling as if you had a fishhook in your insides?" At this Smaragdus bent forward slowly, took up a pewter can, and made it sound on the head of the wretched little man, saying:    <pb n="96-97" xml:id="VAC6560-00000057"/> 96       DREAMS WrTHN DREAMS. "Talk sensible!"  Whereat Ebenezer howled dolefully, screwing his knuckles into his eyes like a schoolboy. "Indeed," said my lord Clodolphus, compassionating the  - sorrows of the wretched little man, "I am verily sorry to have caused your friend physically to enforce my observations. But you say you have a story to tell me. Do so, and I will mind neither your 'ohs' nor your sore head, if essential. Verily have I remarked that a habit, being a second nature, becomes E a sine qua non of doing things properly. So, friend, I will pass over these little eccentricities, provided your tale be in-  teresting."                        i "Once upon a time," said 'the wretched little man, " there [ lived in a remote part of Bohemy- "' "You should say Bohemia," quoth my lord Clodolphus. "This habit of ending words in A with the letter Y is perfectly execrable. Thus many call the ophthalmia, the ophthalmy; Atalanta, A talanty; Medusa, Jledusy ; phenomena, phenomeny, and the like. The which, verily, is inexcusable." "Well, as I said," continued Ebenezer, " once upon a time there lived in a remote part of Bohemia, a man who was troubled with scabs-what doctors call a scrootaneous dis- order--" '"Cutaneous, not scrootaneous, friend," quoth my lord Clo- dolphus, " the word being derived from cuticula, diminutive of cutis, or skin; albeit the skin should be carefully distinguished from the cutis, being composed of not only the cuticle, and the rete mucosum, but also including, beside these, the cutis itself, or hide. The cuticle I allude to is a thin, insensible layer, and serves to prevent too rapid perspiration; acting as a protection, as do clothes on men, fur on beavers, hair on goats, feathers on birds, bark on trees, rind on melons, peel on oranges, wool on sheep, scales on serpents, horn on turtles, shells on oysters, and extraordinary thickness of skin on hogs, tapirs, elephants, hip- popotami, and the like. Wherefore you must say cutaneous. You are right in so calling scabs, (derived from scabo, first person singular, present indicative active of the verb scabo, scabre, scadbi), which are incrusted substances, dry and rough, formed on the skin."  "Very well," continued Ebenezer, who had listened, open- mouthed, to so much book learning, and who, it is hardly necessary to say, was perfectly delighted with it, although my lord Clodolphus might as well have spoken Chinese for all the l   DREAMS WITHN   DREAMS.       97 wretched little man understood. "Very well, as I said, once upon a time therq lived in a remote part of Bohemy-I mean Bohemia-a man, who was troubled with scabs; the which he desired to have cured. So he went to a leech-though why they call a respectable man a leech beats my comprehension." "Then I will verily tell you," quoth' my lord Clodolphus. "The world leech is derived form a Gothic word signifying a physician. - The aquatic animal, vulgarly called bloodsucker, is known under the same appellation. Some pretend to derive the name of the latter from a Saxon verb, meaning to seize; but I myself am not of their opinion. I hold it to be of the same origin as that which gave the title to physicians, that is to say, from a word meaning to heal; for, if the healing art is practised by leeches with two legs, it is no less carried on by their reptile coadjutors." "Lord i what. a wonderful man you are," said Ebenezer, with unfeigned admiration. Said my lord Clodolphus, benignly:  "Proceed, friend Ebenezer, and relate your entertaining history of the man with the scab." Whereat thus Ebenezer: "Now the leech, having atten- tively heard the case, asked him whether he was a daring man or not, since there was a cave in the vicinity wherein the fairies were wont to hold their nightly gatherings- " Then, interrupting, spoke my lord Clodolphus: "Verily your leech was a quack. The idea of fairies, albeit pretty and poetical, is truly fabulous and superstitious; as also are un- dines, gnomes, sylplls, naiads, kobalds, and salamanders. The idea of fairies originated in Brittany, but spread rapidly throughout Christendom. But I forgot. Proceed with your story, for indeed I feel as if I should apologize for having so often interrupted you." "No," replied Ebenezer, "I like to hear you." "Nevertheless," answered lord Clodolphus, urbanely, '"it is not'riglt, friend, always to be interrupting." Whereupon Ebenezer was highly delighted, saying to him- self: "I ever met so civil a gentleman." 4' No our frlend with the scab," he continued " had two friends similarly afflicted, who lived near the cave of the fairies. Their names were Thomas, Richard, and Henry. It is said that all four proceeded to the spot, and saw the spirit, who instructed them how to cure their malady, but warned them not to yield to the flesh or scratch themselves, while on 5    <pb n="98-99" xml:id="VAC6560-00000058"/> 98        DREAMS WITHN DREAMS. enchanted ground.  The goblin then disappeared.  The friends were returning, and indeed had nearly reached the open air, when fortune, never wearied with persecuting mankind, tor- mented them with a great desire to scratch their backs.   Re- membering their fairy's warning, however, they pushed on manfully.  But, alas  fate was unpropitious.  Scratch they must, and scratch they did, hoping to evade the law by forming a circle and each performing the necessary office for the other: Thomas rubbing down Henry; Richard, Thomas; and Henry, Richard.  But the enchantment of the fairy proved an en- chantment as was an enchantment.   The three were doomed to continue rubbing each other down forever, and the trembling peasantry declare they are seen sometimes, when the clock strikes midnight, still busy at their eternal scratch.   This legend has been put to poetry in the following verses: "THE ENCHANTEP THREE. Dark within the fairy cavern Flow the waters of the fay, Never sun or moon reflecting, Never sparkling in the day; Never winding through the meadows; Never gliding to the sea: Tumbling down into the entrails Of the deep profundity. Richard, Thomas, Henry, thither Entering boldly hand in hand, Seek the spirit of the waters On its necromantic sand. "Go!" he cried, " and let your trouble Be forever cured to-day; But beware how ye relieve it In the cavern of the fay." Thus he spake, and they retired Jovial at the coming cure; Sure of all they ever yearned for, Of their perfect safety sure. But, alas! a foe lay ambushed, And great Nature tickled some, Scratch or perish was the watchword, Scratch and perish was-to come. '   In a circle stood the patients, Rashly hoping to evade What the goblin had commanded, When, "Scratch not," he sternly said. Thomas Henry, Henry Richard, Richard Thomas rubbed and scratched. Thus the viper of enchantment Was by disobedience hatched.   DREAMS WITIIIN DREAMS.         99 Many a year has rolled its story To the archives of the past; Many a nation seen its glory On the shoals of ruin cast: And within the frightful valley, When-the midnight bells resound, Scratch the three enchanted patients, Never more to be unbound." Said my lord Clodolphus: "Ywiss have you told a very entertaining story, and one verily whimsical. Have you any more of the kind, friend Ebenezer?" "No," replied the wretched little man, "but I can tell you one which I think will amuse you, although it tells somewhat against myself." "Pursue, friend," quotl my lord Clodolphus, condescend- ingly, "your facetious talc. It will come all the better from yourself, forasmuch as the jocularity of an amusing adventure is verily augmented by the good-natured narration of the person against whom it tells." So encouraged, the wretched little man, after first exchan- ging a grin with the silent Smaragdus; began: "I had," said he, "a pain last night in the small of my back, and although your honor objects to my head being sore, you must permit my back to pain me for the present, as the whole story turns on that fact." "Proceed, young m n," quoth my lord Clodolphus. "There was a certain person in the tavern where we lodged," continued the wretched little man, "who called him- self a physician, and whom the landlord addressed by the name of Claude. He assured me that prevention was better than cure--- "That is trae," quoth my lord Clodolphus. "And that he could cure any disease short of death." * Verily is that dubious," said my lord Clodolphus, pursing up his lips and joining the tips of his fingers. "I doubt Doctor' Claude's science." "So do I," remarked Ebenezer, "and with good reason But, however that may be, I believed in him then, and promised to abide by his prescription. It was a curious one." "What was it?" asked my lord Clodolphus. No less," replied the wretched little man, "than a plaster applied to the spot, with the injunction that my bedfellow and I should lie close together for the benefit of warmth, first divesting ourselves of our clothing. I had much difficulty in    <pb n="100-101" xml:id="VAC6560-00000059"/> 100       DREAMS WITHN DREAMS. persuading Smaragdus to come to the scratch-did I not, Smaragdus?" "You did," said Smaragdus, solemnly. "Well, what must that vagabond of a make-believe doctor do," continued Ebenezer, "but scream 'Fire' in the middle of the night? Up I hopped, but I could not get out of bed. I was stuck to Smaragdus as tight as if I grew out of the man. The villain had actually gone and smeared both sides of the plaster with some diabolical compound, which stuck us together like the nose on your face. Smaragdus is not easy woke, but when he was, he was in a rage, I believe you. Wern't you, Smaragdus?"  Smaragdus nodded a grave assent. "Meanwhile," said the wretched little man, "the noise waxed louder and louder. What the deuce were we to do? We wouldn't burn, and we couldn't separate. 'Hang your plaster,' said Smaragdus, 'I can't get my breeches on.' 'Neither can I,' says I. Can't you kick a fellow a little more?  I suppose you think I have no feeling? Can't you keep that knobby knee of yours quiet?' 'If you don't stop  stooping,' says Smaragdus, 'I'll punch your head. You are pulling my skin off.' ' What are we to do?' says I. 'We  can't be burned alive for the sake of decency.' 'I should hope not,' says he. ' Go ahead. Now, keep step.'  "So, putting on what clothes, we could (and that was mighty little, I assure you), off we strutted and walked into the hall, where a crowd of men, women, children, dogs, and cats were assembled. Lord I what a row ensued. You ought to have seen them. Some screeched, some screamed, and some called for strait waistcoats, thinking (and I don't blame them for it) that two lunatics had broke loose. Up comes the inn- keeper, and as he comes in we bounce against him. He went over as neat as you please; but when he scrambled up he stormed some, I tell you. He wanted to know all sorts of things-what we meant by making this disturbance?-how we dared come out in that airy costume?-in fact, I can't remem- ber the half of it. That impostor doctor then interposed, and told'him the whole story, which, when he heard it, made the landlord screech with laughter. 'Oh, master Claude! master Claude I ' says he, 'you will be the death of me some day. Will you always be a boy?  You two had better retire.' 'But,' says I, ' must we always be so. I have a wife. What will she say to this man's company? I can't go home. I   DREAMS WITHN DREAMS.       101 can't see my Betsey. Oh! do take him away, somebody.' 'I think,' says the impostor, with the heartless grin of a fiend, 'a can of oil will dissolve the adhesive mixture." Whereat I heard execrations behind me, proceeding from Smaragdus, who swore he wouldn't have the lamp oil poured at all unless he did the job himself; which he finally did, and all I know is, I got more than half of it in my ears." "Claude Hartrettet," said Ernest, when the wretched little man had finished his narration, "Claude Hartrettet is always up to some dodge like that. You are not the only sufferer, I can tell you. He a doctor? Why you might as well call me a viceroy. He is the head of a band of smugglers, or banditti, or poachers, or something, who infest the neighborhood. I never could quite make out what he was. He is not a bad fellow, though wild as he can be; more blame to the father who made him so. At any rate he is smart enough for a dozen, and a man would have to get up precious early to take him in. But you are not going, Father Wilfrid, surely?" "I must," replied the priest, who had risen. "You know I cannot stay long anywhere. Good day, gentlemen." And, with a comprehensive bow, he left the room. Sir Wolfgang, who only waited for this, signed to my lord Clodol- phus, and paid for what they had ordered; when the two gentlemen quietly mounted and trotted rapidly off in the same direction Father Wilfrid had taken. CHAPTER IX. BEING A CONTINUATION OF THE ADVENTURES OF SIR WOLFGAXG AND MY LORD CLODOLPHUS. HARDLY had Father Wilfrid ridden a quarter of a mile, when he heard the trot of horses behind, and the dog Romulus bounded past his nag,.who of course shied, much to its rider's discomfort. Looking round, after his first alarm, he perceived Sir Wolfgang and my lord Clodolphus rapidly coming up. So he reined in his horse, and awaited their approach. Their errand was soon told; the priest identified the beggar  with Piquemont, and agreed to direct them to the spot where    <pb n="102-103" xml:id="VAC6560-00000060"/> 102       DR LAMS WITIN DPEAMS. the exile lived. "You will not find it a palace," he said, smiling mournfully, " but it shelters him from the inclemency of the weather."' "And where is it?" asked my lord Clodolphus. "In the ruins of the old Uphorn Castle," replied the priest. "I suppose you know where that is, of course." "There is no of course about it," replied my lord Clodol-  phus. "I do not know where those ruins are."        Af "Indeed?" said Father Wilfrid. "s I am astonished that a i man so interested in antiquity as yourself, should ignore one l of the most valuable relics of old times we have in the country. A Why, Uphorn Castle was built nine hundred years ago, and this even is the most modern part of the edifice, which rests on  the ruins of a Roman temple. The foundations and lower walls of that structure were so strong that the barbarian architects  found half their trouble saved." "Dear me!" said my lord Clodolphus. ' What a strange ! man Bertrand is, never to have mentioned the thing! Bless my soul! What an extraordinary thing! But you have seen it, Father Wilfrid? Tell me, is it verily placed on the ground d or on a podium? Is the altar without or within, circular or square? Or is the building hypaethral? Tell me all about the shafts and capitals, the pilasters and steps, the cornices and mouldings, the antae, proanos, niche, and shrine. Tell me - all about everything-who built it? to whom was it dedicated? in what century? And, when you have answered all that, I shall have leisure to ask you one or two more questions." "My dear friend," replied the priest, laughng, " you have evidently a great idea of my learning. To say nothing of what is to come, I could not reply to half your questions. Besides, as I told you, only the foundations remain. The ruins of Up- horn Castle lie heavily above them. There are supposed to be apartments partly concealed in the Roman foundation, and partly subterranean, but nobody knows for sure. I should say there exist unquestionably such chambers, as it seems un- reasonable to suppose the base solid. But you shall see and judge for yourself." t I will," said my lord Clodolphus, who meant what he said. "And, while I am talking," continued Father Wilfrid. ' here comes our neighbor Prytanis Musarurnm, who doubtless can give you the information you seek." As the priest said this, the gentleman called Prytanis Mu-   DREAMS WITHN DREAMS.        103 sarum, or Sir Prytanis as he styled himself, joined the company from a cross road. After the customary introductions, the four separated, Father Wilfrid and the knight taking the van, and the other two falling to the rear. Prytanis was a long, lean, gawky looking customer, with a thin face and a) long nose. Being hYgely conceited, and fancy. ing himself the most profound scholar of the age, he uttered his   sentences with a dignity which overawed the villagers. With men of real learning he had acustom, which we publish for the benefit of our fellow men, as the thing is neither patenteid nor copyrighted. Not being as well posted in books as he might have been, he had the custom of buying some widely celebrated work, studying it carefully, and always turning the conversation in so dexterous a manner that this particular volume would be alluded to by somebody else; whereat he would plunge at once into the matter, keep the conversation at this point, and, having lately read up, naturally would know more about it than those who had not opened the volume perhaps for years. By this means he contrived not only to inspire people with the idea of his wonderful accomplishments, but to terrify modest merit into the background. This method is pnrsued by many, and requires only a loud voice and a tolerable decree of impul dence to make it generally successful. But, alas! an  experiment can be tried once too often. Ninety-nine times is the bucket safely carried to the well, to be broken the hundredth.  Prytanis had a Tartar to deal with in my lord Clodolphus, whose prodigious memory forgot nothing. Hence Sir *  Prytanis talked much, and my lord Clodolphus talked more, until the detected philosopher under false pretence was completely silenced. Whereat he determined to read up some more books and take his revenge hereafter. Being naturally goodnatured, my lord Clodolphus affected not to see his companion's confusion, and asked him his opinion of the ruin? Taking courage, Sir Prytanis replied:  "Poor, sinfiul wretches that we  are! I can tell you all about it. We are degenerating daily. See what a ruin that is I Can we build a ruin as old as that? I believe not." r'                  am -inlined to think "No," replied my lord Clodolphus I am inclined to think time has  something to do with age. Sir.

"I mean, can we build a Roman ruin?" "Certainly not," replied mly lord Clodolphus, " only Ro- mans could." "Worm that I am! I don't mean that," said Prytanis. "I mean, can we build a structure like the Ronlans, with ! Roman stones, unless we first tear down Roman buildings, like a Vandals?"? "Yes," remarked my lord Clodolphus, " you might, if you Hi foundksome Roman building already down." ' But not otherwise, sir," said Prytanis, profoundly. "I think you are right at last," answered my lord Clodol- phus, dryly, " since it would be hard to take bricks away from X a brick house, and build another of the same size with the a materials, without destroying the first edifice." "Oh i wretches that we are!" quoth Prytanis. "That is  not what I mean."                    ! "Are you quite sure that you know exactly what you do mean?" inquired my lord Clodolphus.           i "Yes, I do, though a reptile," said Prytanis.     i "Before you tell me," continued the other, " will you have the goodness to inform me why you are continually calling yourself a wretch, a reptile, and a worm?" "With the greatest pleasure," answered Prytanis. "I I flatter myself I am the vilest wretch on the face of the wide, g wide world. That is the way, you know, to become a saint; or, if you do not know it, you are on the road to perdition. I am not yet a saint, but expect to be soon." "How soon?" inquired my lord Clodolphus, ironically. "Before next Tuesday, would you say?"      ' "You would not laugh if you' knew all," quoth Prytanis. "I could now sit in the Court of Investigation and determinie whether a person should be canonized or not-I know so much of sanctity."                      ! "I should not like to pin my faith on the deeds of the saint e you canonized," answered my lord Clodolphus. "Nay, I do not think you good enough to be the devil's advocate." "The devil's advocate I " cried Sir Prytanis, horrified. ;' The devil's advocate! A Christian man was never so insulted before. I may not be a saint, but the idea of my advocating the devil, to say nothing of not being good enough even for that, is an outrage to the' commonest laws of breeding!" "Now confound you, for the greatest impostor I ever had   DREAM8 WITHN DREAMS.        105 the misfortune to meet " cried my lord Clodolphus, utterly losing patience. "Y ou pretend to know everything, and you know nothing. You talk of canonization without knowing what the devil's advocate is. Insult, indeed! Verily you in- sult any respectable man by presuming to give your opinion when lhe is by. Hold your tongue. Don't you dare to inter- lrupt me when I am making observations for your good. Verily are you a humbug.  Verily are you an idiot. Verily are you the most stupid, the most stubborn, the most- shameless, and the most unmitigated ass that ever walked upon two legs." "Oh! go on, go on, by all means!" cried Prytanis, grin- ning with rage. "Hadn't you better say a little more?" N"Now, verily," pried my lord Clodolphus, " did ever mortal hear such impudence? You are impertinent: do you hear that?" "If you would halloo a little louder, I might," retorted Prytanis, sarcastically. "Bellow a little more, won't you, old bull of Bashan?" "Why," cried my lord Clodolpllus, almost beside himself with rage, " did ever mortal see such effrontery?" "No! I'll be lianged if he ever did," replied Prytanis. "Here is a fellow with a paunch like a jelly bag. I meet him, accost him politely, and talk to the best of my ability. What does be do in return for my civility and condescension? He contradicts everything I say; he tells me to hold my tongue, and he calls me an ass. A stick, my fine fellow, well applied to your shoulders- " Here the luckless Prytanis was roughly interrupted. En- raged beyond measure, my lord Clodolphus gave him such a buffet that he knocked his lanky companion clear off his horse. Jumping then down, the valorous Clodolphus caught his an- tagonist by the hair, dragged him up, and began to punch his head lustily. mrhereat the dog Romulns did ferociously seize the unfortunate Prytanis by the right heel, which he shook like a rat. :NTow, Prytanis, being no Coeur de Lion, finding himself attacked front and rear, began to bawl piteously; whereat Father Wilfrid and Sir Wolfgang, who were a little distance ahead, turned round to see what was the matter. At that' moment the battle field presented a curious mixture of squirm- ing limbs, human and canine, out of which ascended sounds of rage, anguish, and the barking of dogs. Sir Wolfgang at once galloped up, dismounted, and parted the combatants, or rather    <pb n="106-107" xml:id="VAC6560-00000062"/> rescued the victim from the sacrifice. Upon which Prytanm scrambled up the side of his horse, dug his spurs into its sides, and was out of sight in a minute. Puffing and blowing, my lord Clodolphus arranged his gar- ments, and slowly mounted the horse Neptune, when hLe rode quietly on by the side of his companions, who considerately forbore to question him. Indeed, Sir Wolfgang knew his cousin, and the priest, Prytanis, so well, that neither was much at a loss to divine how the crisis was brought about. After a ride of about five minutes, during which all three preserved a solemn silence, Sir Wolfgang broke the quiet by a long and loud fit of laughter, in which he was joined by the other two. The silence being at an end, Father Wilfrid remarked that Piquemont was hardly in proper company; for Claude was not fit society for the exile. "And who is this Claude?" asked Sir Wolfgang. "I have heard so much of him, that I really should like to hear his history." "Would you," replied the priest. "It is not long. Claude was the son of the village blacksmith. He was wild from a boy, and of an ungovernable character. The only way he could be moved was through his feelings, and a kind word he never could resist. He was very frolicsome, and fbnd of prac- tical jokes-such as the one we heard the little man relate at Toservem's. His father was not fitted for the responsible posi- tion of a parent, or rather-as we must not put our-faults on nature-had never controlled his own passions sufficiently to give his child that proper example, without which blows and  admonitions are worse than useless. Had Claude been a timid  child, he would either have died under the treatment, or be- come an idiot; for the old man was brutal in his cups, and not  often sober. But Claude was intrepid, brave, fierce as his father, and a match for the old man in every sense of the word. His agility helped him to escape the blows aimed at him, and  his sagacity taught him that his father would forget when sober what he did when intoxicated. Thus Claude went on from bad to worse, until at length he fell in love. This sobered him a little, and I began to hope the gentle hand of Cecilia would lead him into the path of virtue; and I solemnly declare I be- lieve she would, had not a terrible catastrophe occurred, which frightens me even now to tell. "Old Hartrettet came home one night, more intoxicated and savage if possible than ever. As, at my recommendation,   DuJIsAMS wrITIN DREAMS.       107 Toservem had refused him any drink at his tavern, and conse- quently he was forced to obtain inferior liquor at a higher price from the smugglers, he had, as you may imagine, a great grudge against me. My having highly favored the betrothal of Claude and Cecilia, therefore, made the old man regard it with no favor; and this night, when drink and the devil were stronger in him than ever, he chose to make me the subject of  a contention, the lamentable end of which I have innocently caused. "When old Hartrettet staggered into the room, he found the young lovers seated by his wife, conversing pleasantly. The mother had just invoked God's blessing on the girl for all the comfort she had given to her declining years. My friends! while the awful name of God" (here he crossed himself de- voutly) "was still on that poor old mother's lips, her husband reeled in With curses and blasphemies. He cursed his wife  he cursed me; he cursed his son; he cursed Cecilia; he swore that Claude and I had conspired against him; and, finally, in a perfect frenzy of rage, he struck Cecilia down. "In a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, Claude's hands were on his father's throat. The old man, stunned and amazed at this unexpected attack, fell heavily on the floor; the mother interfered with loud screams; and Claude, horrified' himself at what he had done, assisted his father to rise, and bore him off to bed, where he sank into a drunken sleep. When Claude re- turned, he found his mother in a fit. Already worn out by long years of anxiety and ill usage, her constitution long un- dermined by neglect and privation, the last trial had been too much for her powers of endurance. Convulsion followed con- vulsion. I was sent for, and administered the last sacraments, and soon after she expired. RPquiescat in pace." The old priest was silent moment, and then continued: "The next morning," said he, 'hen old Hartrettet awoke, he found Claude at his bedside. The young man had never spoken a word since his mother's death. His face was pale. He lIad not slept all night. His dress was disordered, and seemed to have grown years and years older in a few hourm. His father stared at him and trembled, for there was that in the young man's expression few would have cared to face; still less one whose conscience must have been terribly awakened, if I may judge by what he said afterward. "Unheeding this, however, Claude spoke to him in a harsh, dry tone. 'Father,' said he, 'for I will call you by that name    <pb n="108-109" xml:id="VAC6560-00000063"/> 108       DREAMS WITHN DREAMS. for the last time-the last time, mark me, so help me God H the cup of your transgressions is full. You have never spoken a kind word to me since I was born. You have made my life a torment and my home a hell. You have been the only being who ever spoke a cruel word to my poor old mothher. Yoea have struck down the only being who offered me what you have denied me from my cradle. You have ended your work. False and cruel, dastard and drunkard, coward and murderer, the tears of the innocent, the blood of my mother, and the curse of your son are registered against you. May the mem- ory of your crimes haunt voa henceforth; may the blackness of guilt darken your deathbed, and may consecrated ground reject you! If the raising of a hand could spare you now, I would not raise it. HHenceforth we -meet no more, until I rise up in evidence against you before the judgment seat of God.'  "And with these terrible words he was gone. Cecilia's parents, who, although they loved Claude as a son, always opposed the match, now withdrew their consent. Strange to add, Claude never urged the suit. His father died six months afterward, under the effect of drink. Lately it has been whis- pered that Claude and the parents of Cecilia have come to an i understanding; and I partly believe it, since Claude seems to have regained 'is old spirits. Some say he is a robber, but there is no p oof he is. He may be a smuggler, since his father, I knew, was on an intimate footing with several contrah bandists. That Claude is a criminal against the game laws, I think. In fact, we know so little about this pairt of his career, that we must beware how we express too hasty an opinion."  .: "But he seems a merry smuggler, or poacher, or freebooter, or whatever he is," said Sir Wolfgang, "' if I may judge his character from the prank he played that dismal, wretched little man with the sore head." "Oh!" said the priest, laughing, and with a pleasant    reminiscence of his old favorite, "Claude was alwrays that,  and yet I never knew him to play a cruel trick. There was, at times, even something indescribably delicate in the way he played his pranks. Thus, an old and ruined man, who resides in the village, and was once, they say, a professor, a very poor and very proud man, was informed by master Claude that the Count wanted to see him on important business. Now the Count always presented the old professor with quite a little fortune (for him) every January, but had forgotten it. The professor (as we call him) went up to the castle. when there   DREAMS WITHN DREAMS.        109 happened precisely what the young rascal counted upon: all the Count's wrath was directed at Claude, while the other's presence reminded him that he had forgotten his annual dona- tion. The next day Claude was sent for, and appeared with a penitent face, but managed, in the middle of the Count's scold- ing, to upset his gravity by a serio-comic defence; which so delighted the nobleman, that he gave the boy a gold piece on the spot." "You interest me in the young man," said Sir Wolfgang. a If he has committed no worse crime than poaching and smug- gling, it will go hard if I do not manage to procure his pardon, and set him up honestly in life." Thle priest's eyes filled with tears. "For the love of God, noble young man!" he cried, " do not forget this. You will never regret it. Poor priest that I am, and ignorant of what the world calls wisdom, I tell you such a deed will stand you better in Heaven's eyes than if you had conquered a city. But I must now leave you. Do you see that tree?  Well, continue keeping your eyes on it until you reach it; then look 'ound, and you will see the ruin. You cannot miss your way. Go now, my friends, and may God's blessing be on your work."  Both Sir Wolfgang and my lord Clodolphus bowed rever- ently. Father Wilfrid then rode away, and the other two pro- ceeded. as directed. On reaching the tree, they saw a beautifiul landscape stretched before them. They found themselves on the top of a hill on the skirts of the forest. Before them extended a roll- ing country with a, background of blue hills. A creek, like the more celebrated Phrygian stream, meandered among the many little elevations like a blue snake, until it was lost behind a somewhat higher range of little bluffs. On one of the Lilli- putian heights stood a very old ruin, which the practised eye of my lord Clodolphus detected as the relics of a Gothic castle on a Roman foundation; the lower part being built of those flat tiles known as Roman brick. 5What had once been an entrance, an arched gate adorned by Italic columns, was now blocked up by huge stones. Above this rose the ruins of the castle, which was now crumbling fast to decay. The towers that remained stood amid a mound of rubbish, over which the grass had already spread its carpet. The whole was over- grown with creeping plants, which luxuriated greatly, making the ancient structure appear to be drawing its mantle decently    <pb n="110-111" xml:id="VAC6560-00000064"/> round it, like Csesar, as it fell dying beneath the reiterated stabs of time. "A very good idea, Wolfgang," quoth my lord Clodolphus, as the knight made the last-mentioned remark; "a very good idea, and one that might be polished up into something." "I am glad you like it," replied Sir Wolfgannr. "Oh! by all means," quoth my lord Clodolphus. "Give me the classics, or give me death. But I should much prefer coming here at my leisure, in sooth-which, with the blessing of God and St. Thomas, I will do soon-to be talking or even thinking now of anything else but our friend 7iquemont, whose forlorn condition raises my pity considerably. And, as philoso- phers, pity should we verily not overlook, since it is the ante- chamber of charity, and without charity (see St. Paul's first  epistle to the Corinthians, which he wrote at Ephesus and sent to Corinth by Stephanus, Achaicus, and Fortunatus)-without charity, I say, we become as sounding brass or tinkling cym-  bals, even if we speak with the tongues of angels. Verily is Christian philosophy greatly above the ancient. It seems, in  sooth, vainglorious to compare one's self with such men as Peri- ander of Corinth, Cleobulus of Lindus, Chilo, Solon, Thales, Aristotle, Pliny, Plato, Cicero, Seneca, or Socrates. Yet, if you only bear in mind the words of Didacus Stella, to wit, 'Pigmei gigantum humeris impositi plus quam ipsi gigantes vident' (which, being translated, is, Pygmies placed on giants' shoulders see more than the giants themselves)-if, I say, you remember these words, you will see, I trow, the benefit we have in standing (so to speak) not only on the shoulders of the  heathen philosophers, but also on those of the fathers of the  church. I say the fathers, because heathen philosophy is not enough; for what saith the Greek proverb? KaKOV KopaKo;, KaKOV wov--Bad the crow, bad the egg; albeit I do not see why the wickedness of the bird should necessitate the egg being addled; but never mind. Verily I may have mistaken the meaning of the proverb. A heathen, at any rate, could only teach heathen pity. Charity is of another growtlh. Touching pagan virtue, we may say, in the words of Martial, 'Nos haec novinlus esse nihil'-We know these things to be nothing; and this we may say boldly, Pelagius to the contrarry notwithstanding." To all this Sir Wolfgang made no reply, saying to himself, "What a wonderful flow of talk my kinsman has, to be sure I It would not do for a nervous person in a delicate state of   AJJLX1!AO Vl A VA IX N LLMJAL4U  IIC JL. J. health to sleep with him, as I am sure he must talk prodigiously even when asleep." In which opinion Sir Wolfgaing was partly right and partly wrong. It is true that my lord Clodol- phus would have kept any ordinary bedfellow awake, but. not in the way the good knight supposed; my lord Clodolphus not being wont to talk in his sleep, but to snore outrageously. Meanwhile, however, we must not forget the object of our friends. They descended the hill, waded through the creek, and rode up to the ruin. As he advanced, Sir Wolfgang kept turning over in his mind how he should act, and paid no atten- tion whatever to my lord Clodolphus, who continued spouting Latin and Greek, and dwelling upon Pelagianism in a most learned manner. That gifted man was already in the middle of the controversy, 'and had already brought St. Jerome into the field on the heresy of apathy, or human enlargement from the fetters of passion, when they reached the ancient court- yard. Here, in front of the ruined keep (which my lord Clo- dolphus informed his companion was also called the donjon; at which Sir Wolfgang replied, "Oh, indeed!" in an absent manner), they saw a young man leaning on the edge of a well. The youth, who had a curly head and a very pleasant face, advanced to meet them, and seemed curious to know what brought them there; although he said nothing, and only turned an inquiring look toward the visitors. Sir Wolfgang was very much perplexed, as he had not expected to meet any person but Piquemont. But, seeing my lord Clodolphus about to speak, and knowing well that if that learned man once opened his lips, it would be no one else's turn to talk for a good half hour at least, he hastened to antici- pate that philosopher, and addressed the young man at once. ' My fiiend," said he, "I have come here to visit an old man. If he be one in whom you are interested, my knowledge of his whereabouts must satisfy you as to my motives. If, on the contrary, he be unknown to you, leave me to find him out for myself." The stranger nodded, and proceeded to scan the faces of the two earnestly. "I do not know either of you," he said at last, "but your countenances speak in your favor, and, as you say, your knowledge is a true passport. You are brave men, I doubt not; but, brave or not, let me respectfully warn you, if you have any evil intentions, to return before it is too late." "Thank you," replied Sir Wolfgang. "You are blunt, friend, but your manner is frank, and your words honest and F    <pb n="112-113" xml:id="VAC6560-00000065"/> "X       DREAMS WJ'ITHJN UKDREAMS. straightforward. I trust we are true men, and incapable of treachery." "' That may be, and that may not be," answered the youth. "Good appearance never argues good kernel. There is, noth- ing more like a sweet apple than a sour one." "Verily," quoth my lord Clodolphus, "you are a wonder- ful youth. Verily is your idea neatly and epigrammatically expressed.  rhat saith Hesiod? 'I8CLEv tfev'ea 7roXXO X'yeLV ETrvALOLct o/ota-which, being translated, is, Sometimes we disguise truth in fiction.

X You see, my young friend," continued my lord Clodolphus,  "Agamemnon and Achilles strove together about a damsel named Brisiis, who was, in sooth--" "Had we not better think of Piquemont?" whispered Sir Wolfgang. "Certainly," replied my lord Clodolphus; "but what can be the harm of first acquainting this good youth with the cause of the wrath of Achilles?" "Because time presses," remonstrated Sir Wolfgang. "If you think so," replied my lord Clodolphus, "I will defer the story of Chryses and Chrysiis to a more convenient opportunity." "You had much better do so," said Sir Wolfgang.   DREAMS WITHN DREAMS.        113 "I will," quoth my lord Clodolphus. "At another sea- son, my young friend, verily will I tell you about the son of Latona; the ill-fated Hector; the swift-footed son of the silver- footed goddess; the unfortunate Priam, slain at the altar, as Virgil tells right dulcetly, by Pyrrhus; the suicide iof Ajax, son of Telamon; the beautiful Helen, wife of Menelaus, bro- ther to Agamemnon; the escape of the discipline-loving Dio- rred from his treacherous wife 2Egiale; the sage Nestor, and the discreet Ulysses; besides the fortunes of Sarpedon, Patro- clus (who I shall prove to you was an Irishman), and /Eneas, poetically supposed to be the founder of Rome." At this harangue, Sir Wolfgang, notwithstanding his pa- tience, and the respect he had for his kinsman, waxed exceed- ing impatient. The youth, on the contrary, who seemed a lover of mischief, did his best (a very easy task) to set my lord Clodolphus going again; and, being a shrewd reader of human nature, at once succeeded, by observing, "You can never convince me, sir, that what's-his-name was an Irishman." Immediately name after name, author after author, quotation after quotation poured from the lips of my lord Clodqlphus like a deluge. This, together with a list of heroes, such as Cairbre- Liffeaclhair, the Na-Gceart, Moel Conry, Cluan-Mac-Noisk, and Cluan-Aigneach, 1made up a conversational chaos, " a universal hubbub wild of stunning sounds," which filled the audience with admiration. When, however, my lord Clodolphus paused for want of breath, intending soon to begin again, Sir Wolf- gang interposed decidedly. "If you wish," said he, "to waste time, stay here and have your talk out. But I shall push on." "Let me guide you," said the youth, "for this you can only do with my permission." "I do not know that, friend," said the knight. "I think I should do so, even if you opposed me." "Not so easily as you -fancy," replied the other, smiling. "I am a fairy, and could nail you to the spot with a wave of my magic wand. But, whether I can or cannot prevent you, I certainly have no wish to do so. At least permit me to ac- company you. Perhaps" (here he smiled again) "Oberon's presence might prove useful, in case the sylvan Pucks became frolicksome." "You are a strange man," said the knight. "But I will 'trust you." , "So say my friends," replied the young man lightly, as he led the way.    <pb n="114-115" xml:id="VAC6560-00000066"/> "4      -DRBEAMS WITHN DREAMS. Now it came to pass that the dog Romulus, who just now joined them, began to smell the legs of the youth, as dogs are wont to do; whereat Sir Wolfgang said, "Down, Romnlus!" At these words the youth shot a rapid glance at the knight, his dog, and' his goodly horse Cincinnatus. A meaning smile irradiated his face, though he said nothing but "A very fine animal. Come here, sir!" And, to Sir Wolfgang's great wonder, the dog, who was accustomed to bay strangers rather than otherwise, went obe- diently up to the young man, and fawned on him. ' Ah," said the youth, dryly, " an excellent dog! He would prove invaluable if you were attacked. See how he treats strangers." "What devil's cunning have you?" asked Sir Wolfgang. "You seem to have power over beasts." !"Ah," replied the other, in the same dry way, "you are not courteous. Saints have such power; perhaps I am one. Besides, I told you I was a fairy. Seriously speaking, now,  confess--have I not puzzled you more than you have me?"  : "I confess," answered Sir Wolfgang; "but, as I reserve  ; my own, I ask not your confidence."; "Prudently said," remarked the youth, opening ;a door. "I see you are both fond of your horses. Lead them in.  There are robbers, you know, and they might be stolen. We have room enough here to accommodate you all." Thereat our two friends, nothing loath, crossed the threshold, and entered a large apartment. CHAPTER X. BEING A CONTINUATION OF THE ADVENTURES OF SIR WOLFGANG AND MY LORD CLODOLPHUS. THE room was vast, bare, cold, and dismal. Two pallets of straw, several iron pots, and a few necessary articles of fur- niture-none of comfort or luxury--were scattered round. Round the huge fireplace several logs were arranged as if for seats. A door at the other end of' the room was on the jar,. and our friends perceived it opened on a spiral staircase.   DREAMS WITHN DREAMS.        115 i"Your friend will be in soon," said the youth, piling logs on the fire. "Meanwhile, make yourself as comfortable as you can." So saying, and taking another long view of the gentlemen as he pretended to arrange the fire, by the ingenious but not over-gracefull method of stooping and looking at them through his legs at the hazard of having all the blood in his body run into his head, the youth watched our friends take their seats on two of the logs. Having satisfied his curiosity, and winked at my lord Clodolphus, who was staring right in his face through the arch of his leas, the youth regained an upright position, shook himself, and gravely offered pipes and tobacco to his guests. a' Verily will I take one," quoth my lord Clodolphus, gra- ciously. "In sooth, tobacco is not lightly to be rejected." "Rilght," said the youth, nodding his approbation. "There are a great many thingo. worse than tobacco, old fellow." My lord Clodolphus, a little nettled at the familiar title of "old fellow," looked dignified, and replied nothing. The youth, seeing this, continued: "You don't like my calling you ' old fellow,' evidently." "I do not, young man," quoth my lord Clodolphus. "And yet," said the youth, "I can prove you I am right; ' End not only that, but complimentary." 'Proceed; my young friend," quoth my lord Clodolptus. "Verily woulld I hear your reasoning. Verily am I fond of ratiocination." "Good," answered the youth, with a smile. "And now hearken. Dicturus sum-" Hallo!" cried my lord Clodolphus, pricking up his ears at the sound of a dead language-like a crow who scents a car- cass, we were going to say, only that a crow is not blessed with ears, or it might possibly improve its vocal powers a little." ' Hallo!" cried my lord Clodolplius. "Old, means long cultivated, don't it?" asked the youth. "For instance, we call land old land, when it has been long cleared, plowed, and fixed generally, don't we?" "We do," said my lord Clodolphus. "And fellow means an equal, don't it?" pursued the youth. "It does," quoth my lord Clodolphus. * So might bob-whites. They are odioes.-R. [Found written in the margin of the manuscript.--US.

Old, we have proved to mean cultivated. Therefore an old fellow means a cultivated (or educated) nobleman." "Verily," quoth my lord Clodolphus, "have you done well, my young friend. Verily are you logical. Verily might you aid me, methinks, in proving Patroclus an Hibernian." "Was Patroclus a bear?" asked the youth. "Nay," quoth my lord Clodolphus. "Then what was the tlhing?" asked the youtl. "Why, a man, to be sure," replied my lord Clodolphus. "Was lie poor?" asked the youth. "Nay," quoth my lord Clodolphus. "That was a pity," said the youth. "Many a poor fellow would like to do like hil." "Do what?" asked my lord Clodolphus. "Hibernate," replied the youth. "Winter, like a bear, sucking its paws." "Who said lie could?" asked my lord Clodolphus. "Didn't you call him a Hibernian?" said the youth. "And what would be the good of being a Hibernian, if you couldn't hibernate?" and he winked at Sir Wolfgang. "Verily, young man," quoth my lord Clodolphus, "you are either trying to be witty, or you do not apprehend my mean- ing." "Oh! I am not apprehensive of your meaning anything," replied the other, misunderstanding him purposely. "I am not given to that. People of my trade are more afraid of being apprehended, thlan of apprehending anybody." "And ivhat is your trade?" asked my lord Clodolphus. "People call it a carrying trade, and accuse me of carrying away anything I can lay hands on, that is not too heavy or too hot," replied the youth. "Verily, I trust they are mistaken," quoth my lord Clodol- phus. "And verily, I shouldn't be surprised if they were," re- plied the youth, "for, as the proverb goes, people say every- thing but their prayers. But why do you wish them mis- taken?" "Because I have taken a liking to you," said my lord Clo- dolphus. The other looked pleased, and his handsome young face was lighted up by a very engaging smile. "Thank you," said he,   DREAMS W'ITHN DREAMS.       117 in a very different voice from the light one in which he bad hitherto spoken. "You are verily welcome, for I mean it," said my lord Clo- dolphus. "May I ask your name?" You may," replied the other, resuming his light tone. I am called by all kinds of names. Sometimes I am a fine fellow, sometimes a rascal, sometimes a brick, sometimes a fool, and sometimes a knave." "And what do you call yourself?" asked my lord Clodol- phus. "That depends upon circumstances," replied the other. "I have several names. For instance, I called myself an ass this morning, when I let a bucket fall on my toes." "But generally?" pursued my lord Clodolphus. "What name are you known by most generally?" "My best friend, Claude Hartrettet," answered the young man, "otherwise known as Wild Dick of the Woods-" Sir Wolfgang started. "What is the matter?" asked the youth. "Nothing," replied the knight. "I understand the mys- tery of Romulus now. You must be, as you say, a friend of ,Master Dick, who did me the honor some time ago, to send me the animal." "So you know Dick?" remarked the youth. "Not personally," answered Sir Wolfgang. "But he and a great friend of mine are on very good terms." The young man laughed. "And so that is Cincinnatus, is it? And I am entertaining no less a person than Sir Wolf- gang de Vere, am I?" "Why, who the devil are you?" asked the knight. Y'ou seem to know everybody and everything." "Nay," said the other. "What I know, you never told me; so what I am, is no matter of yours." "I shrewdly suspect," said Sir Wolfgang, " that you are no less'a person than Dick himself." "You are not as far from the bull's eye," replied the youth, with another laugh, " as if you thought me the Holy Father in disguise. At any rate, Claude and I are the best of friends. Whoever hurts him, hurts me; whoever does him a good turn,  does me one; although Claude and I sometimes disagree, and he does things which I do not approve."  "You were about to speak of Claude," sai the knight. "I pray you continue, for I have a personal interest in the young man, and would fain do him a service."    <pb n="118-119" xml:id="VAC6560-00000068"/> "8     DRElEAMS WITI1N DREAMS. My lord Clodolphus nodded approval, and growled out, without taking his pipe from between his teeth, "G-ood!" ill Ca,icude's name I thank both of you for the wish," re- plied the young fellow, very gently. "And pray, how would you serve him, if I may ask the question without impoerti- nence?". "No offence," said Sir Wolfgang. "N Tot, in the least," growled my lord Clodolphus. "NMy desire is to rescue him," continued Sir Wolfogang, "from lIis present career, and establish him in a position where he may honorably woo fortune." "Honorably!" cried the youthl, fiercely. " -onorably! And is Claude lHartrettet accused of dishonor I He, too, of all men, who from childhood up has wrestled against a current that would have swept away many a high-born gentleman to damnation. Honorably! I trust you only repeat what you have heard, or I would call you to such a reckoning that nothing but blood could satisfy." "You are heating yourself for nothing," replied Sir Wolf- gang, mildly. *"A person may be honorable (as you under- stand the word), and yet take a very false view of things. When men once defy society, and yet are not strong enough to constitute an independent nation, a-lthough, perhaps, they are powerful enough to resist the authorities, they are unable to organize themselves into a properly governed community. In ancient times " (here my lord Clodolphus pricked up his ears) "nations doubtless often rose from such beginnings; but those days are past, and if we take a practical view of things, we must regard such associations as inevitably tending to evil. This we know not only by theory-" "A priori," growled my lord Clodolphus. "But also by studying history--" "A posteriori," growled my lord Clodolphus. "Thus, either taking it a priori or a posteriori," continued the knight, with a slight smile, " we may rest assured that it is far wiser to bear any wrong the State mnay effect on one or two individuals, and to submit to any law not actually op- posed to conscience, rather than set to work so terrible an engine for evil; which soon passes away from its founder's con- trol, and hurries him, perhaps, through a wicked life to a dis- honorable death." "Well and bravely'spoken!" cried the youth. "Forgive me my impatience. The future will do justice to Claude.

Piquemont's appearance would have moved the most careless heart. He seemed a very old man, although grief rather than time had effected the melancholy cha nge. His eyes were sunken, his face emaciated, his white hair dis- ordered, his beard tangled, and his tattered clothes of the mean- est kind. An old greasy cap covered his head. A staff sup- ported his trembling limbs, which shook as if with incipient palsy. My lord Clodolphus, who remembered him as a stal- wart, 'handsome old nobleman, was touched to the heart; while there was a moisture in Sir Wolfgang's eyes, as he advanced to greet him, whch was very like tears. Piquemont started as his eyes encountered the knight. He did not see my lord Clo- dolphus at first, for the room was dark. "And what," he ex- claimed, " what has Sir Wolfgang de Vere to interest him in the misfortunes of a broken-down -old man?

' My advice," said my lord Clodolphus, stepping forward. "Mine, old friend. Do vou not know me?" "You here, Clodolphus I " cried the old man. "Why have you both come?  Would you enjoy my hospitality? Would you view   my manor and estates?  Would you ask permission to hunt on my grounds?  My hospitality will be freely offered,/though a Sybarite might grumble at the luxuries. Here is bread, there water, there a pallet of straw. In my palace, of course, you will be comfortable; but I feel I mist apologize to your horses, who are used to better accommoda- tions." Hereupon Piquemont burst into a laugh, which was not pleasant to hear. "Come, come, old friend!" said my   lord Clodolphus, kindly, "is it likely Wolfgang and I would have taken so much trouble to hunt you up for the purpose of injuring you?    <pb n="120-121" xml:id="VAC6560-00000069"/> 1 20*      DREAMS WITHN DREAMS. I trow not, Comne, old friend. You were verily wont to hear reason in timles of yore. Listen thereunto even now. You know what Horace saith: ' Eripe turpi colla jugo '--Loose (or snatch) thy neck from the shameful yoke. Let not passion, in sooth, master discretion. ' Liber, liber sum I die age'-Say out, I am free, free! That, verily, is the way to do. You are distressed? So was Socrates with Xantippe. What thel? Hope, as men do who have espoused shrews, and ponder on the possibility-the joyful possibility. --of becoming widowers one day.  You are wedded to misfortune?  Very good. Verily is she nearly gone. Verily is she on her last legs. Verily is she already on the eve of giving up the ghost. Verily are we come to bring you, by fair means or by foul, on foot or on horseback, with your leave or without your leave, even to comfort, your due, to friends who await you, and to a daughter who prays for our success." Hereupon, mucll to the youth's astonishment, seeing the whole thing was unexpected, and my lord Clodolphus was bulky and unwieldy, that philosopher, seizing both of' his (the youllh's) hands, solemnly led him round and round in a kind of ecstatic war dance. This eccentric way of testifying joy star- tled Sir Wolfgang and Piquemont, especially as the youth, recovering from his first surprise, began to caper like mad, throwing his legs about in such unc.-,uth positions that he was aeliving defiance to anatomy, and showed the triumph of man over hs kneepans. This dance, in the which my lord Clodolphus not a little resembled a bear, and the youth an eel squirming at the end of a hook, hIad the effect intended. Piquemont burst into a loud and long fit of laughter, in which he was joined by Sir Wolfgang. All over perspiration, and breathless from his exertions, my lord Clodolphus, encouraged by the good effect of his jocularity, took advantage of the moment. "That has done you good already, Piquemont," said he. "Now for a little serious talk. You look a hundred per cent. better since you began to laugh. Depend upon it, the facetious side is the best one to view the world from." "You seem overjoyed," said Piquemont, still laughing at the odd scene he had just witnessed. "Verily I am overjoyed," quoth my lord Clodolphus, L" for, ' dum rore cicadae,' while the cicadse (such as treehoppers, fro- hoppers, locusts, and the like) feed on dew, so long will your reputation last. Verily must you promise me to return with   DREAMS WITHN DREAMS.        121 Wolfgang to the castle; and, moreover, permit me to go be- fore you, and announce the good news to your daughter. For, should you promise the same, I will have no fear of your tell- ing a lie, and so following the steps of Ananias, and Sapphira his wife, Mwho fell dead at the feet of St. Peter, prince of the apostles, for having, with a criminal mental reservation, se- creted some part of their estates; in which they wished to appear very charitable, whereas they were only ostentatious: of whose salvation verily are there divers opinions: St. Basil fearing they were lost everlastingly; St. Augustine (or Austin, which is the same name, as I declare in spite of Bertrand), St. Jerome, and St. Gregory the Great, besides St. Chrysostom and St. Isidore of Pelusiumrn, holding that their temporal pun- ishment may Ilave been sufficient for the example, and that saving contrition may have been allowed them in the last agony; as likewise to the antediluvians, to Giezi, Onan, Pha- raoh, and the Sodomites. To the which may be added sundry others, such as Korah, Dathan, Abiram, Balaam, Nadab, Abihu, Absalom, and the hberesiarch Arius; who, having, by the exertions of Eusebius of Nicomedia, been forced, as it were, by the emperor on Alexander, Bishop of Constantinople, died by visitation of God: whereat the holy Athanasius re- marked it was not right to rejoice over the death of a person, for everybody must die, yet nevertheless he could not help regarding the death of Arius as something beyond human penetration." "And which," asked Piquemont, smiling, "which of all these do you think I most resemble?" "Nay, my friend." replied my lord Clodolphus, I spoke oft all these to show you that I did not consider you a son of the father of lies." "I am very much obliged to you for your good opinion,", said Piquemont. "No, it is not that," said my lord Clodolphus. "If I ram- bled'a little in my discourse, it is because I hold it as a prin- ciple that it is a great deal better to say too much than too little." "I am afraid," remarked Piquemont, "there are some un- reasonable men, who will hardly agree with you. What, for instance, does our friend Bertrand say-?" "Oh I Bertrand," replied my lord Clodolphus, "is a very good sort of a man in his way, and it is a great fortune to him that he was born with a silver spoon in his mouth. But he 6    <pb n="122-123" xml:id="VAC6560-00000070"/> ILJ       DREAMS WrITHN DREAMS. talks too much. If I hate anything, it is your great talker. Let every one have his turn, say I. If you recollect, there was once a famous conqueror, called by some Gingis Chan, by others Genghis Khan, by others Gentchiscan, by others Tchink- guiz Khacan, by others Tchinggis Klhacan, by others Genghiz- can, by others Cingiscan, by others Tchinguiz Khan, by others Tchinkiz - Khan, by others Djenkiz Khan, by others Tchingis Caen, by others Tching kisse-ko-han, by others-" "Yes, I know all about it," said Piquemont. "What of him?" Said my lord Clodolphus: "Oh I not much. Having be- sieged the city of Nin-Hia, capital of the kingdom of Hia, in China (for particulars, see Marco Paolo), the conqueror prom- ised to the king of that city peace and protection, provided it surrendered before the month expired. This Genghis Khan did, meaning treachery all the while. Now your talkers- thank my stars, I was born taciturn!--these talkers, I say, verily promise ;ilence to decoy people into their houses, and then overwhelm them with conversation; in the which, if they do not resemble the Khan, I cannot help it, since the story, having once comle into my head, must be told at any cost. But to come back to where we started from, and say what I would have said if Welfgang had not interrupted me-"  "I I " cried the knight. "Yes, you," replied my lord Clodolphus. "Why, I haven't opened my lips since you began to speak!" said the bewildered knight. "Nevertheless have you frequently interrupted me," replied my lord Clodolphus, firmly. "A look may be as great an interruption as a word; and verily have you looked skeptic, when I was making my remarks.  The skeptics-" "Well, never mind the skeptics," said Sir Wolfgang. "What about me?" "And what about me?" added Piquemont, smiling. "Well," quoth my lord Clodolphus, "I wjl leave the skep. tics for a season, together with Wolfgang's/fisdemeanors, and simply say that you need fear Godfroy no more; that Uphorn, De Steele, Rappenhammer, Bertrand, Weezy, and many oth- ers, are already up in arms. v There is no necessity for your hiding any longer. The iron is hot, and we mean to strike. Tell me, then, you are coming to the castle, and I will straight return and prepare for you a royal reception." "Do so," added Sir Wolfgang, seeing Piquemont was wa- vering.   DREAMS WITHN DREAMS.        123 "I will, then," said Piquemont. "I do trust you, Clodol- phus. Wolfgang and I will depart at once.  But-why, the man is actually gone!" So he was. As' soon as Piquemont signified his consent, my lord Clodolphus, determined wot to give him time to change his mind if he wanted to, walked up to N-eptune, led him out, and trotted off without saying good-by. Piquemont was now obedient as a child. The knight wrapped his fur mantle, brought for the occasion, round him, and led him from the ruin. Outside they found the youth, with a mule already caparisoned. "I knew," he said, "you would have need of this." "You have guessed shrewdly, my king of the fairies," re- plied the knight. "Will you do me one more grace? Let me know your name." The youth, who, at the commencement of this address, was about to walk away, turned, and, drawing himself up to his full height, said: "You know as well as I do. A good name. has not been my lot, but I trust to win it one day. Claude Hartrettet, gen- tlemen, has the honor to inform you personally, that he is neither a poacher, smuggler, nor bandit. For further particu- lars, he refers you to his grace of Uphorn. Claude Hartrettet, gentlemen, has also the honor of saluting you." Sp saying, he walked away with a whimsical twist in his countenance which betokened mirth. As Sir Wolfgang had suspected as much, the revelation of Claude's identity did not astonish him. Piquemont mounted quietly, and the knight, after assisting' his companion, did the same, simply remarking, "If I had known this, I might have spared myself some trouble." The two then started for the castle. "Indeed!" said Piquemont, as they proceeded slowly, " is the time of my exile then drawing so fast to a close? I have one advantage, at least; I shall learn to distinguish false from true friends. But you are silent, Wolfgang, and seem to doubt what I say. Come; speak frankly. I always have heard you spoken of as a man endowed with sense, and your silence therefore is eloquent." "Perhaps I misunderstand you," said the prudent knight. "You do not," replied Piquemont. "You must know how bitterly I feel toward those who deserted me in my need." "And what else could you expect of them?-since you    <pb n="124-125" xml:id="VAC6560-00000071"/> 124      DREAMBS WITnm DREAMS. encourage ine to speak," said Sir Wolfgang. "For my part, I think the men who surround us in prosperity, and desert us in adversity, are unworthy of a thought. These kind of people seek companions only for amusement. It is a give-and-take affair altogether. They amuse you-you entertain them. If they sing, and I want them, I invite them. If they choose to be as senseless as the harps I play on, I let them. I look at them as I do at my plate, my horses, my house--as useful in a certain way, nothing more. My friends I take to my heart; I treasure them when living, and I pray for them when dead. But these triflers may desert me, and I can only regret my inability to have them round me so far as they are good actors on the stage of daily amusement." "Bravo!" said Piquemont. "But you have never been deceived-" "Perhaps I have been," sighed the knight. Piquemont did not press the subject any further. "Tell me," he said, after a moment, " what did Clodolphus mean, by my being restored? How? Why? How is it I -have not been apprized before? When is it to be? Why has my daughter remained ignorant of so important a fact? Or may not your plans be divulged? '" "I will tell you," replied Sir Wolfgang, "and the more willingly, as I wish to vindicate a very noble gentleman from a very great misrepresentation. Godfroy of Rochateau is one of the most amiable, honorable, charitable men I ever knew. Nay, hear me out. Did he not offer to marry your daughter when you were exiled?" "Yes," said Piquemont, bitterly, "and the marriage would increase his income not a little." "'Does he not hold your property," continued Sir Wolf- gang, " only as a sacred trust, to be redelivered to you when- ever you may safely claim it?" "When he can hold it no longer, yes," replied Piquemont. 'You treat him unkindly to suppose so," said Sir Wolf- gang. "Was he not the cause of my exile?" "Yes, but innocently." "I don't know that. Has he not been seeking me high and low?"  "Yes, but to explain his motives to you, and offer you a shelter." "I don't know that. And would he not have made my   DREAMS WITHN DREAMS.        125 daughter a beggar like myself, if she had not a claim on my estate in her mother's right?" "Your daughter's claim," replied Sir Wolfgang, "is a fiction." "A fiction!" "Yes. I will prove it to you hereafter. Meanwhile, take my word as a gentleman." "And whose fiction, pray?"   - "I see you know already." There was a pause for a little after this. At length Pique- mont broke the silence: "Am I to understand you," said he, "that my child has been supported by Godfroy?" "She has." "Great God!" "And the surplus income has lain by, accumulating for your or her advantage. Godfroy would rather die than touch it." "I never knew this! God be my witness,'I never knetw this I " cried Piquemnont. "Let me see him, to ask his forgive- ness. I, who have never wronged a foe, have wronged a friend. Woe to the man who trusts too fondly to his own dis- cretion. Old age shall overtake him in tears, and the faces of his friends shall smile upon him no longer." After this they continued silently. The old man's head was bent down, and his meditations were too sacred to be inter. rupted. So they proceeded, until they reached the village. The unexpected, and, to confess the truth, extraordinary appearance of the two, created quite a sensation in the little village of Bertrand. Piquemont was clad in the fur mantle we mentioned, the stiff collar of which made- his tangled white beard stick out horizontally like a broom. This, taken with his unpicturesque headdress (a greasy white nightcap, tied tight round his chin by two strings, one of which was black and the other green), did not take away from the generally absurd appearance of that gentleman. The cloak, having hitched up on the side opposite Sir Wolfgang, and which, consequently, was not seen by him, but very plainly by everybody else, showed a leg naked up to the knee, dangling down-quite un- gracefully. This singularity was made rather the more con- spicuous by the sagacious conduct of the dog Romulus. That animal, being somehow or another possessed with the idea that Piquemont was unlawfully in possession of his master's cloak,    <pb n="126-127" xml:id="VAC6560-00000072"/> 126      DREAMS WITHN DREAMS. kept close to him, watching him angrily, and occasionally leap- ing up and snapping at his heel; when the old man, who was immersed in thought, would kick instinctively, much to the amusement of the spectators. As they passed the inn, Ernest Toservem stood at the door, with round eyes. Samson Shuttle and Solomon Coffin were walking home together, and their marvel was great. Peter Cutter was looking out of the win- dow, and, seeing the old beggar on a mule, cried out to his two friends, the sexton and the weaver, beginning with "My eye!" Thereat Jonathan Sewell, who was in his back garden, poked his nose over the fence to see what was the matter. Divers little boys, not having that veneration for age which boys should be taught to have, did hoot the twain right lustily, and, more- over, excited the dog Romulus (who was nothing loth) to bay Piquemont, by sundry exclamations of "Stuboy!" "Nip his heel!" and others of like nature. In fine, Sir Wolfgang was not sorry when the little village was left behind, especially as they were now near Castle Bertrand, whose gray towers rose above the tall trees of the park. CHAPTER XI. BEING A CONCLUSION OF THE ADVENTURES OF SIR WOLFGANG AND MY LORD CLODOLPHUS. RIGHT exceeding was the joy at the castle when Sir Wolf- gang and Piquemont arrived. Right marvellous was the ex- citement of its liege lord, who performed so many new absurd- ities, especially invented for the occasion, in the way of making confusion worse confounded, that his wife hardly knew him, but set him down henceforth as an inscrutable mystery, liable to produce wild phenomena at unexpected times and in an un- expected manner. Right hospitable was the reception of the Countess, whose good old face-bless it!-was lighted up by benevolent smiles. Right deep was the. bliss of Nora, who clung to the old man, and could not let him go. Right touch- ing were that old man's sobs of joy, as he strained his child again and again to his bosom. Right pleasant was the more quiet welcome of Clovis, round whose neck, after the first   DREAMS wITHN DREAMS.        127 moment of joy was over, Piquemont threw one arm, while the other still embraced his child. Right learned were the obser- vations of my lord Clodolphus, who greeted the company gen- erally in divers tongues, living and dead (especially dead), and with wise quotations, which nobody heard in the general noise. Right cordial was the enthusiasm of Samuel, and Gabriel, and Peter, and the other menials, who in five minutes had drunk themselves into a state of amiability, and, in five more, into a state of devotion. Right profuse were the thanks poured by all upon Sir Wolfgang and my lord Clodolphus, which extended. even to the dog Romulus and the horses Neptune and Cincin- natus. Right wonderful was the amazement and pleasure, when they heard of the kindness of Claude to Piquemont, and his noble efforts to rise above destiny. Never was the Count more energetic, than when he swore Claude should be his son, his pet, his particular freebooter. Never was my lord Clodol- phus so profound, as when he demonstrated to a migratory audience (nobody being calm enough to remain in one place for two consecutive minutes), from authors who never wrote a word on the subject, that brigands were men of great sanctity, and deserved applause rather than reprobation. Never, in file, was there seen such a compound of love, nonsense, uproar, grati- tude, welcome, folly, good will, absurdity, and pleasure before in the grand old hall of Bertrand Castle.  But the Count was not the man to let things stop there. It would have been an insult to his hospitality-or to his no- tions of that virtue, which came to about the same thing-to suggest the idea. He was determined to have what he was pleased to call " a devil of a night." However, after a great deal of persuasion and argument (whereinf the harmony of the company was threatened more than once by long and violent discussions between the Count and my lord Clodolphus, espe- cially on the eternal subject of St. Augustine), the worthy lord of the castle was induced to listen to reason, and to admit, with divers wry faces, that it was barely possible Piquemont, after his long deprivations, and at his age, had better not sit up all night, drinking and roystering. The Count contented him- self, therefore, with accepting as a substitute the promise of the rest to do their best to make him forget his disappointment. "We will not," quoth my lord Clodolphus, " go home until the morning; until Aurora sprinkles with rosy light the orient sky, and Phoebus, rising from the eastern sea, causes daylight to appear-the which, verily, is a fragment of an ancient ditty,    <pb n="128-129" xml:id="VAC6560-00000073"/> that whoso listeth may read. We will stay with you, friend Bertrand, mingling Acheloian goblets (albeit sparingly) with the newly discovered juices of the grape. Any fluid, there- fore, which you may offer us, to be taken into the stomach for the lawful purpose of quenching the thirst or pleasing the appe- tite, in the goodly shape of wine, beer, cider, or other dulcet beverages, soothing to the senses and savory to the palate, will doubtless be welcomed heartily." The Count thought this by far the most sensible speech my lord Clodolphus ever made; especially the allusion to not re- turning until morning-an idea the Count approved of hugely, having himself sung the said song at divers times. Being thus encouraged, my lord Clodolphus had begun: "The ancient Chaldeans regarded wine-" when the Count interrupted him, saying: "Now, I am not going to stand that, you know. At such a time as this, to go and lug those devils of ancients into the conversation, is cutting it a little too fat, upon my sacred word and honor." Thereat my lord Clodolphus contented himself with a dubi- ous smile, and answered that perhaps he had better leave the Chaldeans in the Elysian Fields. "Elysian Fields i" said the Count, with a look of pity. "Don't you know the Chaldeans inhabited Chaldea?" As there was no controverting this statement, my lord Clo- dolphus forbore trying. So it came to pass, that after the rest had retired, the four boon companions remained at the festive board. The fun soon began to wax fast and furious. The Count became merry first. My lord Clodolphus was the second to cross the Rubicon of jollity. Sir Wolfgang followed his kinsman very soon; while Clovis alone remained sober, that gentleman not being able to be made drunk by any known finite quantity of liquor. A song being volunteered by Sir Wolfgang, and the Count and my lord Clodolphus being ready for anything which would make a noise, from a fishhorn to a typhoon (both included), the proposal was applauded vociferously, the Count casually asking what were the odds, so long as you were happy? and my lord Clodolphus clearing his throat for action in the coming chorus; which musical preliminary being observed by Sir Wolfgang, he hastily begged his kinsman to abandon the intention, or no price would seduce him (Sir W.) into a vocal performance. Now the knight had a very fine voice when sober; but the *   DREAMS WITHT   DREAMS.        129 fumes of alcohol often interfere with the functions of our organs, as I have been informed. Whether the case is general or not, in this particular instance it was, so. Sir Wolfgang howled out the following hideous ballad in an intensely melan- choly key, commonly called " sing-song," which was anything but melodious, and possessed the incomparably original advan- tage of passing to his audience's ears through the medium of the knight's nose. An occasional and supererogatory snuffle, the effect of which it is quite impossible for me to put on paper, completed the attractive features of the performance. KNIGHT EVERARD. Oh! where are you riding, Knight Everard? Oh! where are you riding to-night? Oh! where are you riding, Knight Everard  Oh! where are you riding to-night? Riding to-night? I am riding my true love to see, There I am riding to-night; I am riding my true love to see, There I am riding to-night, Riding to-night. When come you back, Knight Everard? There quick riding to-night? Oh! when come you back, Knight Everard, There quick riding to-night? Riding to-night? Oh! I will be back to-morrow, Though I am riding to-night; Oh! I will be back to-morrow, Though I am riding to-night, Riding to-night. Said my lord Clodolphus, interrupting him at this point: "Is there much more of that ballad?" "Ninety-six verses," replied Sir Wolfgang, " there being one hundred in all, and four being already sung. You shall now hear the rest." "Couldn't you put off singing the rest until another sear son?" inquired my lord Clodolphus anxiously. "I will," replied Sir Wolfgang, rather offended, " provided you can give us a better one." "Better is not the proper word," quoth my lord Clodol phus, "better being built upon good, and your song not pos- sessing that qualification either in matter or brevity."  "Well, let me try," said Clovis. 6*    <pb n="130-131" xml:id="VAC6560-00000074"/> 130       DREAMS WITHM  DREAMS. CLOVIS'S SONG.

"That you probably will be whenever you get a chance," quoth my lord Clodolphus, alluding to the last line of the last verse. "I never, verily, saw so much liquor go down one man's throat at once. In sooth have I read-albeit my mem- ory is so treacherous that I cannot at present recall his name- how a person did once depone solemnly that he never took to his lips but one goblet at a time: but you, for the last ten min- utes, have been draining at least two at once-which is not seemly." "Truly, I think you are right," quoth Sir Wolfgang. "I will now continue the ballad of the Knight Everard." "If you do," said my lord Clodolphus, "you had better go cool yourself out in the yard, and finish it there." Thereat Sir Wolfgang did weep, remarking that he had been ill used since childhood. The Count, meanwhile, was sol- emnly assuring Clovis that he had a foreboding of an attack of catalepsy, and conjuring him, that if he (the Count) should die in the night, to keep him until in a state of advanced putre- faction. "Indeed, indeed," said Sir Wolfgang, the other side of the table, to my lord Clodolphus, "I am to be pitied. I pray you, replenish my goblet, for I am athirst." My lord Clodolphus tried to soothe him. My dear young friend," said he, "you have verily a friend in me. Tell me your little history. Repose on my fidelity. My dear young friend, ingratitude is the bane of generosity. Let us not then   DREAMS WITIIN DREAMS.       131 be ungrateful, but grateful. Why not? Take my advice- the advice of an older man, and a dear friend of yours-n-ever sing the ballad of the Knight Everard again. It is not pleas- ing." "You think not?" asked Sir Wolfgang, with tears in his eyes, and his voice broken by hiccoughs. "My mother taught it me in my childhood. It is entwined with the mem- ory of purer days. I pray you, ask me not to forget it. I never can l" "Indeed," said my lord Clodolphus, putting his arm on the back of Sir Wolfgang's chair, and sitting closer to him, " in- deed, I too, my dear friend, have a mother. I have neglected her." "You should not have done so," said Sir Wolfgang. "I know it, I know it," quoth my lord Clodolphus, re- morsefully. "But it is not too late. My poor mother! I will console her declining years. Let us drink to her health. Take care, my dear friend; you will upset your goblet. There! Verily you have done so." Thus passed the night. In the morning, while Clovis, who had retired rather earlier than the rest, was snoring comfort- ably in his bed, the others were discovered in divers places, somewhat the worse for drink. The Count was found on top of the table; whence he was removed to bed under the dismal impression that he was being conveyed to the sepulchre. My lord Clodolphus was accidentally discovered by one of the maids. He was sharing the kennel with the dog Romulus. He had wandered into the garden with the pious intention of seeking and comforting his old mother. Sir Wolfgang could not be found until after a long search, but was ultimately tracea by his wearing apparel, which he had dropped, piece by ,.e:,i on his way to the stable: where he was discovered ale i:i;p the manger of the horse Cincinnatus.    <pb n="132-133" xml:id="VAC6560-00000075"/> 132      DREAMS WITHN DREAMS. CHAPTER XII. INTRODUCING TWO NEW CHARACTERS ON THE STAGE. t         n SOMEWHERE in Shadowland there dwelt two gentlemen of the names of Fulgentius Ardor and Simon Simplicius von Eifer. Being intimate friends, neither concealed anything from the other. Consequently, in the course of time, each was made acquainted with the amorous flame enkindled in the other one's heart. The love of Ardor for the divine Amanta, and the passion of Simplicius for the amiable Liebchen, became more than the staple of their daily conversation; which, however uninteresting it might be to a third party, proved an inexhaust- ible source of amusement to the two votaries of Eros. It is true, Ardor would at times grow weary of his companion's raptures over the accomplishments and attractions of the fair Liebchen, and that Simplicius would yawn over his friend's glowing descriptions of the peerless Amanta; but, finding no one else would listen patiently to them, the two struck up a mutual sympathizing confraternity, with the tacit understand- ing that both should have the privilege of talking, and neither be obliged to show other than a polite appearance of attention; interest being merely nominal, and true fellow feeling a work of supererogation. These worthy gentlemen's characters will be displayed bet- ter hereafter. We will simply show how they came to enter upon the stage of this history. It seems that the course of true love did not run smooth with the enthusiastic Ardor. Amanta would have nothing to say to him. Hence Simplicius, who united in himself a strong admiration for his friend, together with a certain rebellious spirit which appeared on occasions, being in an imitative mood, imagined Liebchen's heart was fixed upon another; although, to tell the plain truth, there was no reason why the man should take any such view. But Ardor pined, and he must pine also; otherwise he was not one of your true lovers, but a bogus one, unworthy of the name. Ardor determined to forget his pain in travelling. Simplicius resolved to do the same. Ardor sent a farewell letter to Amanta. Simplicius wrote a broken-hearted adieu to Liebchen. So it came to pass that both, having made up their minds, resolved to seek the army of Uphern, rush to battle, perform wonders of courage, and perish gloriously on   DREAMS WITHN DREAMS.        133 the, field of honor. Their first station being Bertrand Castle, it is nothing very astonishing if we find them, on the very day of Piquemont's return, travelling together through the forest which encircled the Count's stronghold. Having been silent for some time, Ardor (who tried his best to imitate the heroic knight of La Mancha), conceiving the idea that love-melancholy, being an eternal gnawing at the heart, should not lie too long dormant, began to tear his hair, and cried out: "Thrice and four times happy thou, O fortunate Holo- fernesI Was it not better, since the fair Judith loved thee not, to die at her feet, cut off by her fair hand in the midst of thy dreams of love, than to be slain, as I am daily, by so lovely a foe, ever lingering on in torment?" "I believe you," said Simplicius; " but, I say, Ardor, this dying of love is a very slow piece of business, after all. A body might be dying of love, like ourselves, for the devil of a time, without being a whit the worse for it. It was only yes- terday I smelled a beefsteak cooking; and although, like love- lorn sufferers, we could not, of course, touch a morsel, I must confess the concupiscence of the flesh led me to covet the viands." Ardor, still harping on Don Quixote, still dreaming to imi- tate that illustrious dreamer, replied: "O man, incapable of generous sentiments I it is because you understand so little of love, that you are so tepid in exile. Have you never read Chaucer's Statutes of Love? No?  But I have. Nay I  have pondered thereon day and night, and fashioned myself accordingly." "Incapable of generous sentiments, eh?" replied Sim- plicius, in a-rage. "I've punched a bigger fellow's head for a smaller o ce, I can tell you." You have, have you?" sneered Ardor.   "And how much did you pay him to let you do it? I suppose you gave some blackguard a gold piece, so that you mnight tell that stoiy without lying about the matter; but I don't know."  "Oh! you don't know, eh?" said Simplicius. "No," replied Ardor, musing; "because I believe you'd as lieve lie as tell the truth, any day." "And you would rather," retorted Simplicius. "Do you want me to kick you?" said Ardor. "I should like to see you try," answered Simplicius. "Wait, then, till we get off our horses at the next inn," said Ardor.    <pb n="134-135" xml:id="VAC6560-00000076"/> 134      DREAMS WITHN DREAMS. "Very well," replied Simplicius, who, estimating Ardor's valor (and correctly, too) by the standard of his own, knew very well what the proposed procrastination meant. "And now, suppose you tell me about that fellow." "What fellow?" asked Ardor. "He who wrote the Statues of Love," replied Simplicius. "Statutes, not statues," said Ardor. "What's the odds?" replied Simplicius. "You are so very particular. Let me alone, will you? How can a fellow be always remembering those hard words? Go on about the statutes." "The Statutes of Love," said Ardor, "show us the painful nature of our present situation." "Hadn't we better leave them alone, then?" asked Sim- plicius. "Don't people say that it is folly to be wise where ignorance is bliss?  "Such people," replied Ardor, severely, "are numskulls, ignoring that intellect with pain is preferable to ignorance with- out it." "I suppose so," said Simplicius. "I know so," remarked Ardor. "But now for the stat. utes " "I thought you called them statues a moment ago, and jawed me for calling them statutes," said Simplicius. "No," returned Ardor; "it was you who miscalled them statues." "I did not," said Simplicius. "You did," said Ardor. "It's a lie!" cried Simplicius. "If you don't shut up, I'll pitch you over the hedge, and your horse after you," said Ardor. "You are as likely to do the one as the other," said Sim- plicius. "But go on with your statues, then, since you will have it called so." ' I did not say statues," said Ardor. "I said statutes- S-T-A-T, STAT, U-T-E-S, UTES, STATUTES." "Oh " cried Simplicius, with round eyes, "what an in- fernal -storyteller you are I But go on, anyhow." "The first," said Ardor, "enjoins truth in thought, word, and deed, to Eros himself." "'And who may Eros be?" asked Simplicius.  "Your sweetheart?" "No, nor yours either," replied Ardor. "Eros is the sym-   DREAMS WrrHnN DREAMS.       135 bol of love, as is Ate of mischief, Venus of beauty, Vesta of Chastity, and Hercules of strength." "A cymbal, eh?" said Simplicius. "What the deuce makes you call love a cymbal? Is it because it requires two to make harmony, and that the pair, when they come together, usually clash?" "Why, what the devil is the fool talking about?" cried Ardor. "If you mean yourself, you ought to know better than I," replied Simplicius. "Didn't you talk of cymbals?" "And what of symbols?" asked Ardor. "Why, cymbals," replied Simplicius, "are brass things that smash together, a'n't they?" "I really believe the idiot imagines I am talking of cym- bals!" cried Ardor. "So you were," said Simplicius. "Sym-bols, not cym-bals," said Ardor, emphasizing the last syllable of each word. "Oh! what's the use of splitting hairs that way?" replied the other. "Whether you call the darned things cymbolb or cymbals, it don't make a jot of difference." "A symbol is no instrument at all," said Ardor; "it is a sign." "Of an inn?" inquired Simplicius. "Of an inn?" repeated Ardor. "No; I mean a type." "Oh! what they print with," said Simplicius. "I wish I could print a kick on your carcass," cried Ardor. "I mean a representation." "Is it a theatrical representation?" asked Simplicius, try- ing to catch the idea. "Oh, I am going mad!" cried Ardor. "I mean an image, you blockhead, of something." "A picture, for instance," suggested Simplicius. "Will you hold your tongue, and let me tell you, booby?" cried Ardor, fiercely. "A symbol is a sign representing the peculiar properties of any person or thing." "And suppose a person hasn't got any property?" argued Simplicius. "The second statute," continued Ardor, waiving the ques- tion, "enjoins us to avoid scandal andfoolish talk." "By George I it would be a happy world if we could avoid scandal; but we can't," remarked Simplicius. "Many men," pursued Ardor, " as soon as they have sue-    <pb n="136-137" xml:id="VAC6560-00000077"/> 136      DREAMS WITHN DREAMS. ceeded in gaining a modest woman's affections, immediately publish it to the four winds of heaven. Vanity is at the root of this common habit; for we may well say, ' Ubi homo, ibi vanitas.' Hence your true lover, being modest, keeps his aspi- rations to himself, and only confides them to those who he is sure will sympathize with him, or at least respect his senti- ments." "True," said Simplicius. "I remember a man in our vil- lage (you must know Tom Tinker: ie owns that dog who is always on the bow-wow-wow i), who was trapanned by old Martha Ketchum into an engagement with her one-eyed daugh- ter. Tom never would talk about it, saying he was ashamed of his betrothed, and wished her to the devil." "Your example is not a good one," said Ardor. "Where there is no love, there is no amorous sensitiveness, and conse- quently no sensitive taciturnity." "Maybe not," replied Simplicius. "I won't disagree with that, because I have not the least idea what it means. But go on." "The next statute," continued Ardor, "is an injunction to constancy; a thing without which no true love can exist." "Good," said Simplicius. "The next," continued Ardor, "is to become a missionary of love, trying to convert the world to the worship of Cupid- a vocation requiring many virtues, such as zeal, perseverance, honesty, courage, and independence." "This is the first time I ever heard of that," said Sim- plicius. "And would you have Cupid pulpits in our churches?" "Dolt!" replied Ardor.  "Can you never understand metaphor?" "Understand what?" asked Simplicius. "Metaphor," repeated Ardor. "Metaphor, metaphor," said Simplicius; "that is a word I never met afore." And the man laughed at his own wit. The missionary of love," continued Ardor, "preaches his homilies in verse, and sings them too, when he can. Thus the slave of beauty becomes her champion, standing all armed in the lists of literature, ready to encounter any opponent who will dare deny the justice of her claims to undivided empire.' "But suppose a fellow a'n't poetical," argued Simplicius. "I guess, if Venus had to depend wholly on my poetical genius, she would mighty soon retire to genteel privacy." "Everybody is not gifted alike," replied Ardor. "You   DREAMS WITHN DREAMS.        137 may aid the cause greatly, by firmly believing, openly confess- ing, and always applauding it whenever you have an opportu- nity. If the poetry be poor, say the cause hallows the bad verse. If it be good, become ecstatic at once. If anybody denies it, disagree with him. If he becomes' vituperative, punch his head." "But suppose he is the stronger," suggested Simplicius. "That makes no difference," replied Ardor. "I don't know that," said the other. "I think it makes a great deal. I would not object to pitching into a timid little man, but I should make myself mighty scarce if a big fellow was around." "Another statute," continued'Ardor, loftily overlooking the last remark as unworthy of reply, " enjoins us to take solitary rambles, musing on our ladies--lsuch as you and I are now doing." "But," said Simplicius, "can we call our journey solitary, since there are two of us?" "Solitude," replied Ardor, " is not only actual destitution of company, but may be more widely construed. Thus the lion dwells with the female and her cubs, yet nevertheless is he called a solitary beast." "And in our intercourse," asked Simplicius, "which do I represent-the male, the female, or the cubs?" "Take your choice," replied Ardor, "since I shall not an- swer any of your absurd questions." "Well, go on," said the other. "How beautifully true to nature," cried Ardor, " and what a very common thing it is to see a lover who has been rejected, wandering in the wilderness, all clad in the deepest mourning, his eyes all tears. He retires to some desert to lead the life of an anchorite. Let us view the recluse of love in the wilder- ness. In some rocky cave, perhaps, or, at any rate, in some very uncomfortable location, lie chooses his solitary abiding place. 'He weeps all the time. He eats very seldom-not over once a year, I should say. His bed is of the coarsest materials. The portrait of the beloved, covered with a silk canopy as white as the driven snow, is suspended over an ala- baster altar, on which burn, day and night, costly tapers. Tell me, Simplicius, can there be anything more natural or sen- sible?"                             f "Of course," assented Simplicius. "But there is one assertion of yours, which seems to me highly improbable.    <pb n="138-139" xml:id="VAC6560-00000078"/> 138      DREAMS WITHN DREAMS.  You say the rejected lover eats only once a year. Is not this rather a pull on digestion?" "It would never do," answered Ardor, severely, "to be making a lover always eating. Love and victuals don't agree. It is far, far better to run to the extreme of fasting than feast- ing, in such cases; and, if you do not take care, I will make him fast for two years instead of one." "Nay," replied Simplicius, " then I will say nothing; for I think twelve months enough, without keeping the poor fel- low longer from his dinner." "As Seneca says of anger, so say I of gluttony," said Ardor. "I do not know if the vice be most ugly or most hateful. If the man must eat to live, let him eat; but do not, I pray you, fancy him always gormandizing like a hog." As Ardor said this, he suddenly reined in his horse. Sim- plicius, without knowing why, did the same. "What is the matter?" he asked. "Do you not see before you," replied Ardor, "those two mounds recently erected beneath that oak?" "So I do," said Simplicius. "What a funnynotion!" "Funny!" cried Ardor, horrified. "Of course," said Simplicius. "Why under the blessed suni should a chap want to be buried out of a churchyard?" "And cannot you see?" replied Ardor. "These are no common graves. They are the last resting places, doubtless, of  two fair young girls, cut off in the flower of youth. -The thing does not admit of doubt. Else why here? Why, if romance has not chosen this spot as hallowed by the associations of the past? Let us descend here, and mourn our own departed joys. See how the tender blossoms cluster round the freshly opened earth, as if meditating a gentle invasion of the hallowed hillock. Soon will crosses be erected, on which the name of the young girls will be carved. The early dayspring will light up these lonely graves. By night the stars will shed their solemn light, and the moon will cast her silvery radiance over them. Violets and primroses will perfume them, tears water them, seclusion adorn them, and hope hallow them. Here love can sigh unseen, and pour forth its tender lamentations un- checked. What spot were more fitting for us? Here repose the relics of beauty, hope, joy, anticipation, never, alas, to be realized! Let us, who. mourn the loss of these treasures, de- plore them before these sacred shrines." So saying, the two descended, and approached the newly   DREAMS WITHN DREAMS.       139 miade mounds.  "Cruel Amantal" cried Ardor, as they reached them; "here, by the relics of departed hope, do I pic- ture thy destructive charms. As the dove, shorn of his mate by the thirsty shaft of some hunter, so do I grieve over the unkindness of my destiny, which deprives me so ruthlessly of thy adored society. Here, by the graves of departed inno- cence- We cannot say how much more Ardor might have said, or what beautiful thoughts Simplicius might have uttered when his turn came, had they not been interrupted by the appear- ance of a man and a boy. The boy was crying, and promising not to do something again. The man had a spadein his hand, and was scolding at a great rate. As they came up, Ardor, curious to know by whose graves he had been holding forth so feelingly, inquired of the man who had been buried there? The man, who was a surly peasant, replied that nobody was buried there, but that his son (the lad with him), having chased and killed two of his pigs, in company with several boys of the neighborhood, had secretly buried them. "And the worst of it is, gentlemen," concluded the rustic, "that if the urchin had only told me at once, I might have at least sold the pork; but now it is a question if the hide is worth the trouble of digging. They were the two best sows I had--" "There I there, good friend!" cried Ardor; "do- not say any more. You do not know what you have done." So say- ing, he sighed, walked to his horse, and mounted. Simplicius followed, whistling as he went, and with the faintest possible indication of a grin on his intellectual countenance. The rus- tic stood leaning on his spade, staring at the two, and wonder- ing how the mention of two sows could have caused the two gentlemen so much emotion. Once away, Ardor said: "You see, Simplicius, how unfor- tunate is he who loves. Ridicule in her most ridiculous shape is his foe.' See our own fate. Destiny hath ordained that we should nevermore think of love, without associating our ladies with pork chops-if not with onions likewise." "And not a bad association either," remarked Simplicius. "With apple sauce, pork chops are not to be sneezed at. I wish I had a couple now, piping hot." "Peace  vain trifler, peace " quoth his companion. "Love is too holy for such jests. It has many degrees.. The betrothed, the wife, the mother, the husband, the father, the sister-"    <pb n="140-141" xml:id="VAC6560-00000079"/> "O      DREAMS WITHN DREAMS. "Cousins?" suggested Simplicius, seeing the other pause.. "' I wish," cried Ardor, angrily, "that you and your cousins Were at the bottom of the Red Sea, I do. Look yonder. There comes a mother with her innocent babe. What a lovely sight! The little one lies nestling in her fond embrace, pil- lowed upon her snowy breast, and encircling her fair neck with its tiny arm. Confess now, Simplicius, that you never saw a more attractive sight."  "I would, but for one objection," replied the other, "and that is, it is no mother and her child at all, but a buxom peas. ant girl carrying a monstrous tomcat, who has one eye bitten out, probably in some recent fray." "Stop, for mercy's sake!" cried Ardor. "Have you no soul? Cannot you imagine a little?" "I cannot imagine a tomcat with one eye-" began the other, when Ardor interrupted him. I tell you," he said, "I wish to hear nothing of your one- eyed tomcat." "Maybe, then, it's a tabby," said Simplicius, sulkily. 'Tabbies are  equally objectionable," replied Ardor. "Grimalkin generally may not be introduced into the conver- sation." "Well, I won't, then," said the other. "But, to change the subject, where do you propose putting up for the night?" "A little farther on," replied Ardor, " there is an inn kept by one Ernest Toservem. I should prefer staying there to going on to the castle to-night, as they may not be prepared to receive us." So talking, the two continued their way, and, entering the village of Bertrand about night, rode up to the inn, where we shall now leave them. CHAPTEE XIII.

"There is not the slightest  rain on the intellect while listening to your work." "Not the slightest," added another gentleman, who goes nong us by the name of Cheesy.  "It is all stuff," remarked another, known as the Codger in  ir facetious circle.  "And will never succeed. I told you so," added a tow- eaded cousin of mine, the best-natured man in the Union.

So I continued to read, and they to listen. It seems, that on the night when there was feasting at the castle, quite a little party assembled at Toservem's tavern. Everybody was there, and everybody had a great deal to say; which everybody included not only the usual circle of cronies, but also Ardor and his friend Simplicius, Smaragdus, and his wretched little companion with the sore head. Jollity and her twin sister laughter ruled the night. Ernest was the only ex- ception to the general hilarity, for that gentleman, having gone to. the cellar in the dark for beer, upon his return, when he had already reached the top of the staircase, supposed there was still another step to be climbed. Consequently he brought the leg he lifted up under that vain impression, down very vio- lently and with a prodigious shock; which broke his pipe, spilled his beer, and made him wroth. Hence the worthy landlord was sulky. There was, of course, an immense deal of talk about the great event of the day-the return of Piquemont. Every one had a distinct version of his own, and every one regarded the version of every one else as a fiction. Quite a clamor rose in   consequence. We give the various rumors in as few words as we can. Owen declared, that Sir Wolfgang had arrested Piquemont  for being the leader of the banditti, after performing prodigies of valor, and singlehande routing the freebooterS. Flint corroborated the prodigies, but denied the arrest; saying the knight had rescued Piquemont from the merciless brigands, and borne him off in triumph on a mule. Jonathan Sewell, the tailor, timidly affirmed that he had it from his wife, who had it from somebody else, who heard some-  body say that he had heard that the old beggar man was not the Count of Piquemont at all, but a woman in disguise. Solomon Coffin, the sexton, partially corroborated this, by  declaring Piquemont to be at the present prior of a Carthusian monastery; concluding with the somewhat inconsistent asser- tion that he had been dead these eight months. Peter Cutter, the barber, solemnly assured the company, 1st, that Father Wilfrid and Sir Wolfgang had found Piqle- mont buried up to the neck in a bog; from which they extri- cated him by the painful method of drawing him out by the head; 2d, that he (Cutter) had heard the Count of Piquemont presented a dirty appearance when hauled out, but could not positively affirm the same for lack of evidence; 3d, that Pique-    DREAMS WITHN DREAMS.        145 mont had lustily abused the twain after he was on firm earth, for not coming sooner, offering to fight both together for a groat. All which the said Cutter declared to be true of his own knowledge, except those things deponed according to his belief; and as for those things, he believed them to be true. Samson Shuttle, the weaver, varied the information, by asserting that Sir Wolfgang had found Piquemont in an awk- ward situation: he being undoubtedly a freebooter, and about to be hung by the gang, because he had objected to surrender his captaincy when the lawful term of his office had expired. To each and every of which versions Ernest Toservem gave the most offensive denial. And at each denial of the inn- keeper; Solomon Coffin made a wry face-intended to express contempt, but really impressing the company with the idea that he was uncomfortable in his insides. "I am inclined to think, gentlemen," said Ardor, "that all your stories may be combined ipto one very natural and prob- able explanation. You may depend upon it, love lies at the bottom of the affair, as in most other matters. What is more likely? Do we not know how a warrior starts off in his search for glory? Sweetly smiles his fair bride upon her lord depart- ing. The tramp of many feet, the neighing of horses, the clash of arms, the stirring sound of the clarion, the imurmur of many voices, fill the troubled air. The lady smiles. She has no mis- givings. She fears nothing. Diamonds and pearls deck her hair. Silks and satins flow loosely from her shoulders. She waves a lily-white hand. A look, a smile, a kiss, and he is gone. But he never returns. No! Stretched on the bloody ground he lies, very possibly half eaten by jackals. She hears the news. She weeps. But what are tears?  They seal the volume of grief, but it exists nevertheless. Now. why not sup- pose some such thing has happened? Sir Wolfgang, you say" (to Owen), "arrested Piquemont; and you" (to Flint), "that he rescued him. Combine the two, and you have the battle, the neighing of horses, and all complete. You" (to the tailor) "talk of imposture. You" (to Solomon) "speak of a prior. You " (to Cutter) " of a bog. Combine all in one. The story Xs plain. Now what but love could have brought all this about? Love it was, then. Doubtless the ladies (whoever they were) employed the hours of their lovers' absence in adorning their hair with pearls and ostrich feathers: a way of passing time which everybody knows is continually being done 7,                         o    <pb n="146-147" xml:id="VAC6560-00000082"/> "6      DREAMS WITHN DREAMS.  by all ladies, whose husbands or lovers are in imminent danger  of their lives." "For my part," said Solomon Coffin, squinting at the piece ,] of court plaster on the end of his nose, "I do not believe a word of these love stories. Schoolmaster lent me one or two books, and I never read such nonsense before in my born  days."  "Possibly," replied Ardor, mildly, "you have had the mis- , fortune to read poor works. The abuse of a thing does not deny its use. Love may be abused as well as anything else."  "Oh I I assure you," replied Coffin, " that in the books I speak of, love was anything but abused. It was lauded up to the skies. There was a chap called Abelard, and a she-male called Eliza. Both of them committed all sorts of dodges, and played a whole lot of games. They ended by retiring to a convent, where they finished their days. The book praises them up considerable. Now I say it is all stuff. If you want to teach morality, don't go and make such a fuss over a hot-  blooded wench and a licentious rake, and sugar over their crimes with fine words. Call a horse, a horse, say I. Good is :; good, and bad, bad, all the world over."           i So saying, Solomon glared ferociously at Jonathan, as if he were the cause of all his indignation. "How," exclaimed Ardor, "do you dare, you wrinkled mummy, to sit there and talk such blasphemy against Cupid?  If you were of my rank, I would spoil your ugly face, I would. ;: What do you mean? Have not Abelard and Fleloise shared the sympathy of mankind with Antony and Cleopatra?"  "I don't know anything about Antony and Cleopatry," re- plied Solomon; " but I know, when I prepare for confession, X what the Church calls sin. If Abelard and his mistress are to  be praised, I may as well tear up my catechism, and blot out ? the ten commandments. It seems to me, murder is just as  much murder if you call it by any other name, like schoolmas- ter's proverb about the rose."  "Thrice a fool was I to argue with you, boor I wretch I  rascal!" cried Ardor. "You see nothing but the material,  you animal I Come, Simplicius, let us go to bed, lest our ears  be again offended." So saying, Ardor darted a withering look of contempt on the whole company, and stalked haughtily out of the room, followed by his companion. When they were gone, Solomon laughed sardonically. "I   DREAMS WITHN DREAMS.        147 think them two," said he, "were a great deal better in bed. Ernest, give me another pot of beer." "No, I will not," replied Ernest, wrathfully; "and, what is more, I don't know I ever want you to call for one again." "Pish " said Solomon. "There is no 'pish' about it," replied Ernest. "What the devil do you mean, by coming here and driving noble company away, who drink a quart of wine, where you take a pint of beer? Couldn't you see your ugly remarks were uncalled for? Who wants to know your opinion of love, or anything else, you wrinkled jackass? Another pot! I wouldn't go for one, unless it was to throw it into your skinny face, and knock the bottom out over your dirty nose. Do you hear that, Solomon Coffin?" "Yes, I hear that, Ernest Toservem," snarled the sexton. "I ain't deaf, I believe." "I wish you were, with all my heart," replied the inn- keeper, "and dumb, too." "Well, if you want to sneeze, as I see you do," said Solo- ri  mon, " turn your head away, please." "I wish your head was knocked off," cried Ernest. "Oh! you do, do you?" remarked Coffin, ironically. "Yes, I do," repeated the innkeeper; " and, what is more, I advise you to keep your gash of a mouth mighty shut when ! gSentlemen are here, or you may find yourself pitched into the ashhole." "I don't care," said Coffin. "The devil knew well what he was about when he invented love stories. If you don't want me to say so, I won't. But I think so. If love stories are not lineal descendants of the father of lies, I'll stand treat all round." "Good!" said Ernest. "I take you at your word. Let the company decide." "Very well. Agreed!" replied the sexton, innocently. :    .We hardly need say that the company at once, cheerfully and unanimously, declared Solomon wrong. The sexton, see- ing he was caught, laughed, and ordered glasses round, not for- getting himself; and proposed as toast, "Confusion to love sto. ries!" While this conversation was going on, three more guests had joined the circle. The first was our old -acquaintance with the very dirty bandage. The second was a shabby gentleman with a bushy black beard. 'The third was a person whom we beg more particularly to introduce. I    <pb n="148-149" xml:id="VAC6560-00000083"/> "8      DREAMS WITrHN DRRAMS. He was a ruined gentleman, who lived in the village on an income which approached very near starvation. He was tall and gaunt, and rejoiced in a red head of hair cut to within an inch of his skull. Nobody knew much about him, and few cared to know. He often joined the circle at the tavern, but seldom opened his lips, except to say "good evening" when he came in, and " good evening" when he went out. Some thought he was once a professor, others a physician. He was generally called Professor, by which name, therefore, we shall continue to call him. The morning's history, with variations, was confided to the three newcomers, who appeared very much interested, and (two of them, at least) not a little amused. "So you think," remarked the man with the very dirty bandage, "he was the robber chief?" "I do," replied Samson. "You may depend upon it. I know the world, sir, and am seldom far out of the way. The bandits are headed by no ordinary man, and Claude Hartrettet is not much more than a Brazilian baboon." Here the shabby man with the bushy black beard burst out laughing. "Claude!" cried Solomon, disdainfully. "He never would come to good. Haven't I said so from the day he told me to dig a grave for old Caleb Quartier, when the man was as much alive as ever he was?" "Did you dig it?" asked the shabby man, with a grin. "Did I dig it?" replied Solomon, swelling with indigna- tion. "Didn't I dig it? And a pretty mess I made of it." "Because," said the shabby man with the bushy black beard, "when you brought the coffin to Quartier, you vowed you wouldn't go away until you were paid." "How did you find that out?" asked the sexton. A person, called Robin Goodfellow, told me," replied the other. "I know a great many things." Well, I never I " ejaculated the tailor. "However you found it out," said Solomon, "it is the blessed truth. I came up with the coffin-" "What are you bringing here?" asked Quartier, dumb- founded. "Can't you see it's a coffin?" said I. "Of course I can," said he. "Then what do you ask for?" said I. "Why do you bring it here?" said he.   DREAMa S WITHN DREAMS.      149 "I am sure you ought to know," said I. "It would be quite impossible for me to say, seeing you a'n't dead yet and be hanged to you." in"Oh! you are sure I a'n't dead, are you?" said he, sneer- ing. "Why shouldn't I be?" said I. "Don't I see you are not? What are you talking about?" "And so," said he, "you don't think I'm a ghost, then?" "You're ugly enough for one," said I. "But I doubt it." "I am glad to hear it," said he, "because, if you had thought me a blessed hobgoblin, I should have been under the painful necessity of kicking you and your coffin to Jericho." "You miserable little whipper-snapper!" said I, catching him by the back of his neck, and shaking him like jelly, "if you was worth your salt, I'd quilt you to within an inch of your life." "What are you a-d4ag of?" gasped he, scared half to death. "Are you going to kill a man?" "No," said I, "but I am going to shake a man consider- able." With that I shook him till his teeth clapped together like castanets. "You miserable sexton " he choked out; "you did well to bring me a coffin. I shall be ready for it soon." Your're about right there, Caleb," said I, as an idea flashed over me. "I'm blessed if I don't fit you for one at once. You may as well go easy, because, if you don't, I might squeeze you some in the operation." "So I rolled him into the coffin, shut down the lid, tilted the thing against the door, and knocked like the old Harry. When I heard Dame Quartier coming to open it, I hopped into the cart, and drove off brisk. I fancy," concluded the sexton, placidly resuming the pipe he had been flourishing about in the excitement of narration, "I rather fancy the old woman was astonished some. I don't know, for certain, because I never went there again. but I fancy she must have been." So saying, the sexton reposed his jaws. "And," said the shabby man, "so Caleb Quartier loves Claude about as much as yourself?" , I don't know," replied Solomon, squinting at his nose to see if the court plaster was right. "  But what do you think? " "I can't say," said Solomon, relapsing into a grim smile,    <pb n="150-151" xml:id="VAC6560-00000084"/> OUV     AJvSDEslS Wrl'THlN DiMEAMEL "what Caleb thinks of Claude, but I forgive him the prank for the pleasant way it ended. But he's a bad one, for all that." "How so?" argued the other.  "Does he not fill the country with mirth?" "Yes," replied the sexton; " but, if I was the person robbed, the cream of the joke would be rather sour, as far as I was concerned." "And the fact," urged the other, "that the poor go scot free?" "How could he rob a. body as had nothing?" remarked Solomon. "But he never robbed the rich either," said the other. "If shooting game is not poaching," quoth Solomon, "I should like to hear the word defined." "Do you call poaching wrong?" inquired the other. The sexton, who had been more than suspected of having unlawfully come into possession, at divers times and on divers occasions, of certain birds and beasts which the more rigid would class under the head of game, but who had reformed since rheumatism compelled him to stay at home, when he cheerfully acknowledged the justice of the law, now indignantly answered that he did consider poaching a grievous wrong, and one worthy of condign chastisement. And now great astonishment befell the company. One of the strangers, untying the very dirty bandage, displayed the lineaments of Godfroy of Rochateau, while the other, remov- ing his bushy black beard, grinned the grin of no less a per- sonage than Claude Hartrettet. "Good people," said Godfroy, "the time is come for action. You, Samson, will be wanted soon. Flint, your men must be mustered at once. Uphorn orders it. There is some- thing in the wind. Let there be no delay, friend, for every moment is precious; so be off with you." At these words, 'Squire Flint, Owen, and Shuttle departed with Claude. "Now, Ernest," continued Godfroy, turning to the bewil- dered innkeeper, who, with the rest, looked on with round eyes, " now, Ernest, I have no time to chatter. I am rested enough, although I have been in the saddle since daybreak, and I must be off. Open your ears. There is a little girl out- side, and I want you to take care of her." At this, Ernest looked exceedingly frightened. 'Why I what is the matter with the man?" cried God-   t DREAMS W  1 DREAMS.       51 froy, impatiently. "One would suppose I wanted to bring a s     trhinoceros into the house." "My lord," said Ernest, "I love my good wife, but you don't know-nobody knows-what a one she is when wroth." "The devil fly away with the woman l" cried Godfroy. "What am I to do? Coffin, will you take her?" After several puffs, the sexton replied that he would if he could, but if he couldn't, how could he?-a delicate way of expressing his inability to meet the views of my lord Rocha- ;st'itittt teau. "Hang you both!" cried Godfrey.  "And you, Cutter, what do you say? Come, now, answer at once, like a good fellow." The barber was more urbane in his reply. Trying to couch his refusal in those polished terms he thought most fit for my lord Godfroy's noble ears, he framed his speech so ingeniously, that Godfroy had not the slightest idea what he meant. "Good gracious, man!" cried Godfroy, " say yes or no, and have done with it. What do you mean?" At this the rest tittered, especially Solomon, who chuckled over the barber's fall, Cutter being wont to plume himself on ;F his breeding. "I cannot, then,' replied the discomfited shaver. At this, much to the surprise of all, the Professor, who lhad been passed over as a matter of course, opened his lips. "I think," he said, quietly, " that Dame Chervin will be glad to take care of the child.  She is poor, and you can thus effect a double charity."  "Poor I ", cried Godfroy, indignant in a moment. "Poor I A poor woman in the parish, and I not know it?  Who has dared to let that woman be destitute, and not tell me?" PHere Godfroy's eye fell on Jonathan, who moved uneasily in his chair. "Yes, I am speaking to you," said Godfroey to the hapless tailor.  "Oh I I know you. If any one is at the bottom of this, it is you." The tailor feebly murmured a remonstrance. The wretchbd little man with the sore head ventured also to speak, whh Godfroy opened fire on him forthwith. "Why, you abominable, weazen little skeleton!" he cried; "if I hear another word from you, 'll roll you into a ball, and swallow you alive. I sent for you to cut stones, not to cut into the conversation. Ha! well done, Smaragdus," he concluded, :!*    <pb n="152-153" xml:id="VAC6560-00000085"/> 152      DREAMS WITHN DREAMS. as that stout gentleman dexterously tumbled Ebenezer forward on the floor, by a vigorous slap on the back of his head. The wretched little man plunged heavily head foremost into Jona- than's stomach, who, in his turn, his chair breaking at the mo- ment, went over backward, dragging Coffin with him. Quite a little scene of confusion ensued. When it was over, God- froy continued: "I leave her to you," said he, addressing the Professor. "She shall stay here to-night, whether Toservem or his wife like it or not-" "But--" began Ernest. "But I " cried Godfroy, stamping his foot. "Do you dare argue with me? My old nurse, your mother, has saved your skin more than once, let me tell you." "Well," replied Ernest, philosophically, "considering she gave me my skin, it is her business to look out for it." This had the effect of making Godfroy laugh; as almost anything would, for the matter of that-which fact may possi- bly have been known to the innkeeper. "Now, Ernest, listen," said Godfroy. "Nonsense is all very well, but you mind what I say. Fetch her in, you fat booby of a beerseller, or you and,I will fall out." The little girl was accordingly brought in by Ernest, who knew very well it would not do for him to refuse "You are going, my child," said Godfroy, kindly, "to where you will be well taken care of." At this he stooped down, and kissed her. As he did so, lie started, took her up in his arms, and scanned her features attentively. "No," he muttered to himself, as he again kissed her, and put her down gently, "no, it must be imagination!  So saying, he once more admonished Ernest, handed some money to the Professor for Dame Chervin, and strode heavily out of the room. The little child-so very, very little-looked bewildered round her. She was a gentle little creature. Her hair curled down her neck, and her large blue eyes had a melancholy soft- ness, very touching in one so young. As Dame Toservem was not at home, and Ernest (who was unused to children) stared at her with lobster eyes, she crept frightened into a cor- ner, and sat there very quietly until she fell fast asleep. She was awakened by some one tenderly laying her down, and putting something soft under her head. She looked up. The lights were all out but one. Ernest was snoring in his   DREAMS WITHN DREAMS  .       53 chair, and the company had gone-all except the old Professor, i)   whose heart had yearned toward the little orphan, and who had roused her in his well-meant efforts to make her comfortable. The child smiled, and sank again to sleep as the old man bent over her gently, and a tear glistened on her golden curls. CHAPTER XIY. WHEREIN, AMONG OTHER MATTERS, THE AUTHOR MOUNTS PEG- ASUS, AND TAKES THE READER ON AN AERIAL EXPEDITION. THE wind blows keenly over hill and dale, and through the forest, where the trees creak, and bend, and shake as if they would fain take leave of their strong roots, and are tugging in impotent wrath to deliver themselves from the bondage of earth. It howls around the inn, and then, with the vast mur- mur of a mountain, flies to assault the old castle. Up it flies, swooping like a hawk into every nook and cranny, and gen- erally rendering itself liable to heavy damages in a suit of assault and battery brought against it by the material world. Hither and thither, over the land and under the stars it rushes madly, and we must mount its back to-night, would we see all that is to be seen. Nor need we the enchanted car of Ismeno, the Syrian Archimage; nor his black aerial steeds; nor the winged wheels; nor the swift, soundless flight, baffling the rival pin- ions of the wind. Nor need we seek the son of Hippotas and Melanippe, who, on the Vulcanian island, confined by strong walls of brass, holds in check Eurus, and Notus, and Africus, thick with tempests, and Boreas furious from the North, and the flower-kissing Zephyr. Stronger pinions must we have than Mercury lent Perseus when he flew to the watery con- fines of the world, and blessed the land of Ethiopia. Higher must we soar than Bellerophon; aye, with a loftier bound than Mahomet on his horse Al Borak with his human face, his eagle wings, and his jacinth eyes radiant as stars. See, how rapidly we have shot by them all-Ismeno, Perseus, Bellerophon, Ma. homet  Where are we? In the land of imagination.

These spirits teach authors to read thought. Their cavern is divided into an upper and a lower part.  Phoebus illumines the supe- rior division, where the sage enchantress Fancy sits under a cypress before a large mirror, in which are portrayed the thoughts of the human race.   Here authors flock in troops, notebook in hand, and pens over their intellectual ears or be- tween their intelligent teeth. Here they transcribe the many wonderful relations of motives, descriptions of thought, and other operations of the soul, which we, delighted, read.  In the second or lower division-where we now    descend-the sage Merlin aids us to interpret dreams.. Here Sleep, extended on an ebony couch, is watched by his doorkeeper Morpheus. Deceptive visions flit continually past, rushing on through an ivory door.  Divine warnings and consolations occasionally issue, angel-like, from a portal of horn. Hither authors, but not so many, venture also. Come, let us question the drowsy god. He is a famous somnambulist, and will give us some dim insight into the future of the characters now playing their parts in our narrative. Come, Merlin! give old Sleepyhead a nudge, will you, and tell him there are a-couple of gentlemen who want to ask him a few questions. What is that he says? S O M N U S. Shrouded in the arms of rest, Pleasure-gifted, conscience-blessed, There the just celestial food Taste in slumber's solitude.

Tossing, muttering, groaning, mad, Conscience-smitten sleep the bad. Tempests howl and lightnings glare, Horror fills the murky air. Sweep foul phantoms howling past Wailing, shrieking, hurrying fast, While the owl and raven cry 'Mid the storm's artillery. Moaning, sweating, the unblessed In their slumbers find no rest.   DREAMS WITHN DREAMS.        '15 Well, what's the hour of day? Does all this mean that the old fellow is agreeable? Yes, he is. He is invoking his spirits. Listen to them. How their wings rustle. Come, Merlin, read us our dreams. "Look at Piquemont. How like death are his slumbers! The rising sun lights up the towers of his f;lthers. He dreams of the time when he shall await, in the old hall of his ances- tors, the last scene of this earthly drama; when he shall be deposited in peace in the old mausoleum, where in stately array the long line of Piquemonts await the summons of the last trumpet, and where the ivy spreads its green pall over the relics of the dead. Love gilds the visions of Nora. A mist envelops all, out of which fancy fashions strange, fantastic, beautiful forms. Let then keep their phantom seeming; nor let her learn too soon how Clovis's visions show him a little child, lovel as a cherub, desolate, looking round her timidly, and frightened at her loneliness. But what sound now strikes our ears? Judgment's day! yon dreadful day, When the world shall melt away, Draws more nigh, the prophets say. God! what dreadful hurrying When the Judge comes, summoning All to their strict reckoning. Hear it, Albert! Hear it, thou dreamer! Thy first dis- like to Nora has ripened into hatred. Thou seemest to be standing on a mountain, uncertain whither to go. A  child's form stands by thy path. She directs thy steps. But beware! for he who digs a snare for another, may fall therein himself. The Count slumbers on the table at Castle Bertrand. His dream  is whimsical; for he fancies that his wife is deceased, and that Father Wilfrid is uncanonically urging him to marry his own grandmother. Down in the kennel of the dog Romulus, my lord Clodol- phus dreams of a book which he would fain read, but cannot, because of a very hairy fiend, who holds its claws over his eyes--wthich one skilled in the art of interpreting dreams might trace to the fact that the dog was lying on top of the philosopher. Sir Wolfgang dreams of Arctic snows, and polar bears 4 tB ')    <pb n="156-157" xml:id="VAC6560-00000087"/> 156       DREAMS wrrITH  DREAMS. making a meal of divers wayfarers, as he lies slumbering un- easily in the manger. And yet, in the visions of the Count, my lord Clodolphus, and Sir Wolfgang, there is one peculiarity which savors of sameness. In the vision of the Count, Father Wilfrid urges the policy of satisfying Uphorn by a prudent alliance; in that of my lord Clodolphus, the book is a list of the insurgents; and in that of the knight, the bear which nibbled him seems to be the transmigrated soul of his political enemy. For all which reasons, we may suppose the three gentlemen embarked in some dangerous conspiracy. In the inn, Ernest Toservem has his visions. He has been taken captive by the freebooters, who inexorably compel him to swallow his nightcap, with the privilege, if he chooses, of spitting out the tassel-which he does. Claude superintends this business. Claude (who is standing up to his neck in a bog) stoops, and picks something out of the marsh. It is a child. Suddenly a woman with a pale face rushes up to Claude, snatches the child away, and calls for Clovis. The woman then changes into Dame Toservem, and tells him not to pull the coverings all over his side of the bed. He starts, wakes, loses his balance, and rolls out of bed, carrying with him the pillow and all the bedclothes, and shaking the very rafters of the house. The wretched little man dreams of his sore head. The devil comes to him, and tries to bargain for it. He piously defies the' foul fiend; whereat that evil spirit puts his thumb to his nose, and stretches out his hand, to the little finger of which he applies his other thumb, stretching out the other fingers like- wise; inquiring with a grin, as lie playfully flaps the same up and down, if he (Ebenezer) has ever seen a screech owl, be- cause (adds the foul fiend, alluding to his fingers) those are its wings. The wretched little man fears this is necromancy, and essays to fly. He cannot. A weight is on his chest. He awakes to find Smaragdus leaning on him heavily. That gen- tleman, having awakened in the night, and seeing the lamp still burning, has conceived the laudable desire of quenching the same. Being indolent, he is now lying partly on his own stomach and partly on the stomach of his bedfellow, employed in a futile attempt to spit the light out. Jonathan Sewell also visits the land of fancy. He is op- pressed with the idea that he has a pair of breeches to make in a given time, under penalty of death. The chief difficulty is   DREAMS WITHN DREAMS.        157 not the time, which is ample, but the material, which is uncom- mon-being nothing less than the skin of his good wife. He summons sufficient courage, at last, to ask her; whereat she promptly acquiesces, and steps out of her skin with the most perfect ease. She then informs him that she has worn that skin for a considerable time, and is tired of it, for it is not her own. Jonathan is also surprised to find that his wife has for a long time worn, under this outer covering, a face, whose ex- pression is entirely different from the one he has known hith- erto: the inner one wearing a sad and anxious aspect, as if the features of one who bore a heavy secret in her heart. Solomon Coffin, the sexton, dreams he is digging his own grave, partly from a pious wish to remember his end, partly for the purpose of using it provisionally as a cistern. While digging, he comes to a skeleton. Somehow or another he asso- ciates this skeleton with Clovis. On its hand is a plain gold ring. The old Professor, rusty and taciturn as he is, has his dreams. He dreams of another little child, the age of the one he loves for her sake, and her mother; of a cottage far away by the side of a blue lake, and the grand old Alps rising, rising up, up to the heavens; of a churchyard wherein are two mounds-a large one, and a very, very little one-with two rustic crosses, shadowed by the old Gothic church, which the moonlight silvers as her rays pour mildly over those beloved graves. And he dreams of a broken-down old man, with no one left to love him, who is now waiting for the hour when he will again meet his young wife and little child, buried long, long years ago. But morning comes after night, and reason holds once more undivided sway, except over lunatics, idiots, habitual drunk- ards, and married women, all of whom are legally supposed to be lawful nonentities. The Count, my lord Clodolphus, and Sir Wolfgang having been tumbled and trundled into bed, as has been already described, the household is already stirring and putting things to rights. Clovis and Nora are in the park. rplj   Phoebus slopes his morning rays on the young girl, as her lover hastens to meet her, and his two'bright eyes look gladly into :1    her two blue ones. Old Helios roguishly winks at them from behind a mite of a cloud, as if the old fellow knew a thing or two.

German forests, I have danced in bright eyes, black, blue, and hazel. I understand you perfectly." At first the deer are startled, but, growing accustomed to the two, they graze on carelessly, as if they said, "It is only two lovers, after all. They won't hurt us." The birds, of course, understood the thing at once, and warbled on the old gnarled boughs, turning their little round eyes on the couple, and singing away for dear life. So the lovers stroll round in the bright morning, talking no end of nonsense, and just as happy as if their words were philosophical. The dog Romulus accompanies them, and insists upon walking between the twain, where there is not much room (for they keep unaccountably close together), until, espying a cat, he darts violently after the same; who escapes up a tree, where he bays her boisterously. So passed two delicious hours. "I am glad," said Clovis, as they seated themselves on a rustic bench after their walk, "I am glad we are alone--" "Verily, here we are," interrupted a voice, and, to their great annoyance, they saw my lord Clodolphus puffing up the little eminence where they were seated. "Confound it!" muttered Clovis, between his teeth. "Aha!" said that gentleman, rubbing his hands as he came up; "aha  here we are, Clovis! here we are, damsel  Fine day  Glorious, upon my honor! Verily will I join you; for what saith Virgil? 'Numero deus impare gaudet'- The god rejoices ii-an unequal number. Verily will I join in your love talk.

I love Phyllis above all others;' and again with Damsetas, ' The wolf is a nuisance in the stable' (verily I should think it was), 'rain to ripe fruit, wind to trees, and the wrath of Amaryllis to us;' and again with Menalcas, ' Moisture is good for corn, straw- berries for weaned little goats, the slender willow to the teem- ing flock, but Amyntas only to me.' Verily will I be classic. Verily shall ye share in all these good things. Hi, Romulus I dost thou understand Latin, thou dog?

Ploratur lachrymis amissa pecunia veri '-which, being translated, is, Cash lost is mourned with veritable tears. What carest thou for cash, happy dog? In sooth, thou art justly to be envied." "Indeed?" murmured Clovis, trying to look pleased, but sincerely wishing my lord Clodolphus to the devil in his secret soul. "Oh, yesI " replied my lord Clodolphus; "yes, indeed. Animals have no future, except in the minds of men, who doubtless have their opinions regarding that part of their career. Thus, man looks upon the colt as to be trained, the lamb as to be fleeced, the turkey as to be eaten, the oyster as to be opened, the pig as to become pork, the calf veal, the ox beef, the sheep mutton, and the like. Eating animals, verily, is of very ancient origin. The Jews were forbidden to eat divers of them-such as the camel, the cherogrillus (by some supposed to be a rabbit, by others a hedgehog), the swine, the ostrich, the owl, the cormorant, the bat, the lizard, creeping things, and sundry others. Saint Peter, in his vision at Jcppa, I\'!  however, learned that this prohibition was revoked, and hence C    may we eat what we choose. Therefore all animals have a future in the market, provided the palate of the generation is tt   pleased to devour them. Doubtless cats, rats, mice, bugs, and the like, are not eaten, but they may be. Hence the rule ap- plies to all beasts; whose only future lieth in man's will, except when he cannot get at them, as is the case with divers monsters of the sea, who dive so deeply that they are secure from human depredation." "I suppose so," remarked Clovis, trying to look interested. "Suppose so " cried my lord Clodolphus. "Don't you know so?  The bottom of the ocean, besides being strewn with wrecks, treasures, skeletons of men, sand, pebbles, corals, and shellfish, undoubtedly harbors great monsters, who lurk in its caverns, and rarely mount to the surface." "Of course," assented Clovis. "I thought you must know better," continued my lord Clo- dolphus. "No doubt they had fine times when Noe's flood 7?' Hswept over the earth." "Don't you think," said Clovis, who had been turning over in his mind several plans for getting rid of his loquacious com- panion, " don't you think you ought to take advantage of this fine morning, and look at that old stone you saw the other day, and proved so plausibly was a Roman something?" t    <pb n="160-161" xml:id="VAC6560-00000089"/> 160      DREAMS WITHN DREAMS. "I have seen it," quoth my lord Clodolphus. "But I mean a little more particularly," said Clovis. Said my lord Clodolphus: "The word particular, my dear young friend, partakes of divers significations. First, it may apply to a single person or thing; as we may speak generally of boobies, and then add, 'These remarks apply to yourself. Here a particular booby is pointed out. Then again, I may say, 'Such and such an one sniffs in company.' Here, you per- ceive, I am alluding to a particular bad habit. Then, you may say, ' Such a lady has nothing particular about her, except a boil on her nose!' Then, again, you might say, ' I have par- ticularly examined your head, and am of opinion it wants combing.' And in this, verily, am I omitting several defini- tions. Now let us apply all this to the stone in question. Can I say-but peradventure I am fatiguing you?" "Not in the least," said Clovis, with a rueful politeness. "Very well, then," continued my lord Clodolphus. "This stone, verily, will I tell you more about. I remember reading an anecdote of Diogenes. The cynic lived, as you know, by begging. One day he met a prodigal, and begged more of him than of all the rest present. Says one of the bystanders to the philosopher, 'You must be a very mean kind of a fel- low, to take advantage of his generosity.' 'Not so,' quoth Diogenes; 'but I mean to beg of the rest again.' Hence you do well to beg for my prodigal observations when I am present." "Prodigal, indeed," thought poor Clovis. "Consequently," pursued my lord Clodolphus, remorse- lessly, "the stone, together with its remarkable peculiarities, scientific, moral, historical, allegorical, tropological, metaphor- ical, and incidental, shall be fairly discussed and sentenced, I trust, disinterestedly. Stones, you see, are verily of divers kinds. There is your petrifying spring, wherein, if you im- merse wood, or other objects, they speedily acquire the nature of stone: albeit I am certes of opinion that, should you chuck a philosopher therein, he would not become anything approach- ing the philosopher's stone. But this is facetious. Then there is naphtha, the bituminous mortar, as Bacon hath it, used in the walls of Babylon, which verily grows into an entire and stone- like material. Then there is gravel, a coarser kind of sand, and pebbles, likewise, of divers proportions. Then there are precious stones, such as diamonds, sapphires, emeralds, beryls, jacinths, zircons, topaz, and others. There are also peach stones, cherry stones, plum stones, and divers others. So you   DREAMS WITHN DREAMS.        161 see, when we come to speak of stones, the subject is verily fruitful. "Yes, and any other subject your lordship handles," thought Clovis. The young man was really growing very ner- ;14  vous, but politeness ruled impatience. I i     "By the way," quoth my lord Clodolphus, "we are to have two new visitors to-day." "Indeed I " replied Clovis. "Who are they?" "They are called Fulgentius Ardor and Simon Simplicius von Eifer," replied my lord Qlodolphus. "Simplicius was a very strange lad when he was young. Verily is it related of him, that he did once ywiss meet a pieman going to the fair. "et me taste your pastry, O pieman,' quoth he. Whereat said the pieman, 'First give me a penny.' To whom Simon made answer, 'I have none.' Doubtless you have heard of him." "I have," 'said Clovis. "And who, pray, is Ardor?" "Ah " answered my lord Clodolphus, " as Euripides-if I be not mistaken-says, according to the version of-now who was the man?" "I really don't know," said Clovis. Said my lord Clodolphus, "Verily it is unfortunate, since we cannot be too exact. Never mind. Another time will do as well. Euripides says, 'Optima viri possessio est uxor be- nevola '-A benevolent wife is a man's best property; 'Miti- gans iram et avertens animaam ejus a tristitia '-Softening wrath and turning his mind from sadness. That is what Ardor wants the man being verily Cupid-smitten, love-stricken, sighing like a furnace, and talking like a fool. He is a fair specimen of love maudlin, is Fulgentius Ardor." "Surely your lordship does not quarrel with gallantry," said Nora. "No, I don't," replied my lord Clodolphus, dryly. "I look upon it as a necessary evil." For shame!" cried Nora. "Is not chivalry lauded to the skies?" a      dfMy lord Clodolphus sniffed. "Is it not?" urged Nora. '     ^"Verily," quoth my lord Clodolphus. "And does not chivalry include gallantry?" inquired Nora. My lord Clodolphus sniffed. "Does it not?" asked Nora. "What of it?" quoth my lord Clodolphus.    <pb n="162-163" xml:id="VAC6560-00000090"/> 162      DRyEAMS WITHN DREAMS. "Only," replied Nora, "that love is considered a divine flame." "And woman the divinity, eh?" quoth my lord Clodol- phus. "Ah, my dear child, there are a great many things we know, and a great many things we don't know. Solon, being asked if he had given the Athenians the best code, replied, 'Yes, the best they would receive '--a qualification which shows the wit of Solon, rather than the virtue of Athens. The world is pretty much the same." "But I don't see how that applies," said Nora. "I did not expect you would," replied my lord Clodolphus. ' Verily, to try and convince a woman that gallantry is not the highest human virtue, would be a waste of breath." "I do not know that," said Nora. "I acknowledge the claims of virginity, but--" "But! but  but!" cried my lord Clodolphus. "Ah, there it is. What would the world say of me, if I should try to answer the 'but' of a woman? Verily would they say, ' Here is the man with the stupid brain, Who dared to attempt the effort vain, Of telling a woman again and again, That a level land is a country plain, When to hear the woman would not deign, Which shows how much the man was insane, To use his breath, To move his tongue, To fashion words, To get the best of a woman." "But, in this house that Jack built," said Nora, "there is not a single thing against love." Said my lord Clodolphus: "Verily a good conceit. The house that Jack built! Often, in sooth, have I admired the style of that immortal ballad. Observe and wonder. What a chain! Take one link away, and the whole is incomprehen- sible, for it is like Dante's Inferno; thought conceiving thought in logical succession, from the cock who crowed in the morn down to Jack himself." Clovis looked at my lord Clodolphus. When'is that man going to stop?" thought he. "What don't he know? From the Council of Nice down to the house that Jack built, he seems to know everything, to have pondered on everything, and to have an opinion on everything." At this moment, Ardor, Simplicius, and the breakfast were announced. The 'three therefore turned toward the Castle, where they met Ardor, who handed Clovis an important letter, of which we shall speak more hereafter. Clovis begged the two strangers to make themselves comfortable in the society of   DREAMS WITHN DREAS.        163 my lord C]odolphus, while he went to communicate the con- tents of the letter to his father. To which Ardor responded, by begging Clovis not to put himself out of the way on his account. Whereat Clovis replied, "Not at all," meaning some- thing polite, but really declaring he would not put himself out of the way on the said Ardor's account. In fine, Clovis was urbane, and Ardor courteous, as gentlemen are wont to be. Clovis then left the two strangers to the tender mercies of my lord Clodolphus, who was as fresh as if he had not spoken a word that morning. Sir Wolfgang had now descended, and was waiting breakfast. A short time afterward, Clovis re. turned, having found his father still asleep. So braklfast was ordered, the ladies came down, and they all fell to. "Verily," quoth my lord Clodolphus, taking a huge bite out of a piece of bread, "verily, friend Ardor, they say you are a pilgrim of love. When Saturn, dethroned by Jupiter, fled to Italy, he was royally received by King Janus. Touched by the king's kindness and hospitality, the godlike exile civil. ized Latium, and improved it considerably. In this golden age there were no written laws, no tribunals, no magistrates, no lawyers, and, above all, no physicians. Happy age! Verily, as I understand, this is the age you would bring back." "Iidceed," quoth Ardor, "you are not far from wrong. I would,. if I could, renew the pastoral age." "Yes," added Simplicius; "ram, lamb, sheep, and mutton, goats, maypoles, madrigals, songs, and dances, birds, beasts, and fishes, animal, vegetable, and mineral, all chopped up in one delicious hash." "Ah," said Nora, "your ideal prospect is agreeable enough; but when foul winds prevail--what would your shep. herds and shepherdesses do on rainy days?" "Indeed, fair lady," replied Ardor, giving Simplicius an awful punch under the table, as a hint to keep his remarks until called for, "in the woodland retreat the inclemency of the weather is provided for as elsewhere. And wherefore not? Surely, under simple sheds, by some stately stream, the garden cultivated and bearing nutritious vegetables, and the orchard bending under the tribute of autumn, amid the larks, and bees, and goats, and stags, the innocent and rustic life glides by un- mindful of storms." "Stop," quoth my lord Clodolphus, "until I verily recite the fourth eclogue of Virgil: 'Sicelides Muse! paullo ma. jora-'"     <pb n="164-165" xml:id="VAC6560-00000091"/> 164       DREAMS WITHN DREAMS. "Nay," said Nora; "I protest,my lord, against any inter- ruption. The other gentleman has he floor." "But," replied my lord Clodolphus, " my remarks are in sooth so very appropriate. Fain would I give you a taste of the Mantuan swan. Does he not say the coming boy, 'Paca- tumque reget patriis virtutibus orbem ;' which, being translated, is, The peaceful globe shall be ruled through his father's vir- tues'? And again: 'Occidet et serpens, et fallax herba veneni Occidet; Assyrium vulgo nascetur amomum;  which, being interpreted, meaneth, ' And the snake shall yield up the ghost, and the deceptive poisonous herb shall die, and everywhere shall sprout up Assyrian spikenard'? Verily is this eclogue but a poetic version of one of the prophecies of the Cumaean sibyl. I say nothing of this particular work, but methinks the sibylline prophecies are not properly understood. Besides the authority of such pagan writers as Virgil, Horace, Varro, Cicero, Suetonius, and the like, we must verily not over- look such early Christian authorities as Saint Justin Martyr, Saint Clement of Alexandria, Eusebius, Athenagoras, Origen, Theophilus, and Saint Clement of Rome.   To say that these are Christian forgeries, is untenable (as Lactantius verily re- marks), if we take the trouble to listen to Cicero.  'Quem hominem  et in quod tempus est?' saith the orator, inquiring into the sibylline prophecies. Hence, as my dear friend re- marks, we must not doubt too hastily the future realization of the golden age, which heathen and Christian together have con- spired to foretell." "True," added Ardor; "nor does the return of pastoral innocence imply the destruction of those accomplishments which we regard as the result of civilization. As Tasso beautifully shows, in the case of Ermenia, a lady may live thus, and still lose neither grace nor dignity. 'Those rustic weeds hid not the princely fire And grandeur, so instinctively her own. In every action, through her quaint attire, The latent spirit of the lady shone; Whether she drove her flocks to range alone The thymy down, or penn'd them in the fold Or, to wild ditties, sung in mournful tone, The dulcet cream in churns revolving rolled, Till firm the fluid fix'd and took the tinge of gold."' Said my lord Clodolphus: "In sooth, Tasso wrote well.   DREAMS WITHN DREAMS.       165 For my part, I liken him to a bumble bee: not only producing honey, but melody likewise." "A humble bee, not a bumble bee," said Sir Wolfgang. "Not at all," replied my lord Clodolphus. "You may say both; the word bumble being derived from flBouBos, a great noise; and humble from the verb to hum." i"What don't you know, my lord?" asked Clovis, laugh- ing. "I fancy that whatever my lord Clodolphus don't know, is not worth knowing," said Nora. "I agree with you, madam," added Ardor. ' Not so," replied my lord Clodolphus, highly delighted, as he always was with compliments. "There are some things well worth knowing, which I don't know." "And what may they be?" asked Nora. "For example, I don't know what a woman means, when she says 'no,'" answered my lord Clodolphus. "I do, then," said Nora. "Of course you do," assented my lord Clodolphus, laugh- ing; "but that does not enlighten me at all." Nora laughed. "When a lady says 'no,'" said Ardor, she means ' no,' I suppose." "Not at all," said Nora, gayly. "No, indeed," chimed in my lord Clodolphus, compla- cently. "No, indeed," echoed Clovis and Sir Wolfgang. Whereat, much to that learned gentleman's surprise, Ardor rose, and em- braced my lord Clodolphus. "O friend!" he cried, "how can I thank you sufficiently? How can I honor you enough? How can I embrace you long enough?" "Get away!" cried my lord Clodolphus, as well as he could, for the suddenness of the salutation had made him swal- low the wrong way, and he was in an agony of coughing. "Get away, crazy man!" "Oh I " cried Ardor, rolling his eyes up, "I mayvyet hope for the smile of my Amanta." "To be sure you may, man," said Clovis, sitting down again, for he had been zealously engaged for a minute in slap- ping the back of my lord Clodolphus; "to be sure you may. Go in and win. Faint heart never won fair lady. But do sit down, and control your ecstasies. What the devil is the other doing?" It seems that Simplicius, modelling his conduct on that of    <pb n="166-167" xml:id="VAC6560-00000092"/> 3 friend, had followed his leader. MWhen Ardor had released  r lord Clodolphus, Simplicius waited patiently until the cough. g fit was over, and then, throwing his arms round that learned mn, gave him a squeeze that Bernardo del Carpio, or a bear, Hercules might have envied. Now my lord Clodolphus as wroth enough at the first embrace; but, when in the grip Simplicius, anguish overmastered rage, and he kicked and ared lustily. Whereupon Sir Wolfgang interfered as well as could for laughing, and unlocked the arms of the persecutor; st as my lord Clodolphus thought all his ribs must give way. "Confound your flames!" gasped the philosopher, as soon he could recover breath. "If that is the way ye worship ros, and want to bring back the golden age, verily may ye go the devil for impertinent meddlers who are botchers in the siness. What do you two mean, by choking a man that "I will tell you," said Ardor. "You must excuse every- ing in a lover. Lovers are all fools. How we shrink from e bright eyes of our Rosamunds, Roxelanas, and Beatrices I e how Ovid immortalizes the victory of Daphne over the iver-bowed Apollo! Yes, you must, indeed, excuse anything a lover. Women are tough enemies to deal with. Ay, ake a lover of a man, and you have a metamorphosis exceed- g those of Ovid. Talk of Eros or write of him, feel his dart describe it, the common mind can only paint it idiocy, and enius call it madness." "There! what do you think of that?" remarked Sim- licius, turning to my lord Clodolphus. "Hush, you fool!" said Ardor. "Don't you know he is philosopher?" "A what?" asked Simplicius. ' A philosopher," replied Ardor. "Well, I am about as wise as before," replied Simplicius. And what, pray, is a philosopher? Is it a nation, or a re- gion?" "Neither," said Ardor.  "Well, then, what is it?" inquired Simplicius. - Can't ou tell a man? How should I know what a philosopher is? L man can't be knowing everything, I suppose? Of course, don't know what the darned thing is." "Few do," quoth my lord Clodolphus, dryly.  "Your over of wisdom is rare, nowadays." "Shut up, you fool!" said Ardor to Simplicius. "Don't rou see how you are exposing your ignorance?"   "I should just like to know what the deuce you mean?" replied Simplicius. "Would you?" sneered Ardor, for neither was very much afraid of the other-in the which both gentlemen showed un- common good sense. "Would you?" sneered Ardor. "Yes, I would," replied Simplicius. "You talk like a halfbreed between a fishwoman and the witch of Endor." w Witch of Endor 1" said Ardor, disdainfully. "And who was she?" L"Oh! I a'n't much up in. biblical literature," replied Sim- plicius. I suppose she was something infernally ugly." "Well, remarked Ardor, breathing very hard, "I do not think, if I were solemnly asked to point out a man so degraded as only to possess a faint claim to the smallest spark of the very commonest decency, I could conscientiously point you out as even having that minute claim to respect. What do you mean by sitting there, like a great, fat, lubberly heap of carrion, making your senseless remarks on me; just as if the wild idea of your possessing taste ever penetrated that thick and brain- less skull of yours?" "Now, bless my soul I " replied Simplicius, spurred on by seeing the rest were laughing, "if you have not more wind than anything else, it is because you are equally endowed with impudence. I have certainly as much right to give my opinion of you, as you have to call me a fool. And taste, too I fancy I have more than you, my man." "Taste " retorted Ardor, contemptuously. "You beg- garly peasant I you have no more taste than brains." heaAnd you about as mich," replied Simplicius, nodding his head violently. ". Keelp still, and let me talk," said Ardor. "I'll be hanged if I do," answered Simplicius. "You are a pretty fellow to be telling a man to keep still while you talk? No, I won't keep still, Fulgentius Ardor. What then?" Then I will make you," said Ardor. "Will you?" sneered Simplicius. "I will,", replied Ardor. "Try," said Simplicius. "Get up, then, and let me," cried Ardor. "Come on, you fat Colossus!" "Come on, you spectre of Brocken!" cried Simplicius. "For shame, gentlemen I " interposed Clovis. "Sit down, and be friends. There, that is right.

"I trust, Simplicius, that you, having received a good lesson-which I hope you will remem- ber all the days of your life-will act more respectfully and submissively toward me, and your other superiors, for the future." Simplicius folded his arms, and looked at Ardor with an as- tonishment not wholly unmingled with admiration. "Well," he said, "I like impudence. There is a peculiar modesty about everything you say and do, which is perfectly beautiful. Allow me to thank you for the moderation of your chastisement; which was so very light, that I really ignored its existence until you gave me the information." "I readily  don you," said Ardor, grimly twirling his mustache, ' inasmuch as I never expected anything better of you. Men grieversly suspect you, my man, of running away when danger is nigh; and one of the peculiarities of cowardice is, that the recreant is very deaf when reminded of the fact." "Who," said Simplicius, "fled when his castle was at- tacked? Men said you must have possessed Hop-o'-my- thumb's seven-leagued boots; for the speed with which you scampered away was miraculous." "Who ran away from a white sow by night," asked Ardor, "and thought it was a weir wolf?" "Who took a back view of a jackass feeding on the grass  by night," retorted Simplicius, "and said he had seen the devil?" "Who," returned Ardor, "was found locked up in a closet by an old woman, whom he had valiantly attacked, and who beat him and his rapier to boot with a broomstick?" "And who," said Simplicius, " disgraced himself and his family by going about Treviot, at the Carnival, covered with rags?" "I represented the Commander of the Faithful," said Ardor. "And pray, who was he-a mountebank?" asked Sim- plicius. "You had better not expose yourself," replied Ardor, con- temptuously. "Why," asked Simplicius, "how am I to know the name of everybody? Do you suppose a man has nothing to do but keep the title of every son of Adam at his finger ends?" "The Commander of the Faithful," replied Ardor, loftily, "* means the Caliph of Bagdad."

' h-f-ope, they would be ashamed of their general." "Thrient shos," replied Ardor, how much you know of oriental customs." "What kind of customs?", asked Simplicius. "Oriental," answered Ardor. cOh  oriental," pursued Simplicius. "No, I don't know nuch about them. If dressing up like a born fool is a speci- men of them, I don't think much of the whole set." "Oriental means Eastern," replied Ardor, compassionately. "I don't care a button," said Simplicius, "if it means northern, southern, eastern, and western put together. It is just as absurd.

I send this therefore to warn you, trusting rumor has been at her old trade of mis- representation." "There I what do you think of that?" remarked Clovis, folding the letter, and looking up. "What do I think of it?" replied the Count, with a yawn that would have done honor to an alligator. "I really can't say. There don't seem to me much mystery about it. Albert expresses himself very neatly. He don't go round the bush, like that old folio Clodolphus." "But he might have said more," reasoned Clovis. "So he might--so he might,"' replied the Count. "I for- got that. I am really very much obliged to him. Short and sweet, should be the motto of a letter." "You seem to like it," remarked Clovis. "That I do," answered the Count.* "I never could bear your long letters. When I want an axe, I ask for an axe. When any one wants me to lend him an axe, I like him to call it by its name, and be done with it. There is that Clodolphus I catch him calling anything by its proper name. He would die first. If he wanted a saddle, for instance, he would begin with the creation of horses; inform you, perhaps, horses never had horns-as if anybody ever said they had; then he would come to harness, showing the difference between the accoutrements of a knight and the furniture of a beast. This would lead to saddles, and, after a long talk about saddles of mutton, saddles of venison, saddle cloths, and saddle bags, he would cursorily mention he wanted a saddle. Now why he could not have asked for the thing at once, the devil only knows." But, urged Clovis, gently, "you have not yet explained to me your opinion of the letter." "What letter?" asked the Count. "Albert's," replied his son. "Oh, that!" said the Count.  "I quite forgot. Well, what's the matter with the letter? The young fellow makes a pretty shrewd guess. I am sure I don't care." "You don't mean to say it is true?" cried Clovis. "Don't I?" answered his father. Maybe I don't-may. be I do. Maybe I will get stretched, maybe I won't." "What do you mean by stretched?" asked Clovis. "The rack, man!" replied the Count.

Now, if the Count had tudied h an nature, and nothing else, all his life, and moreover had conned over this speech for a twelvemonth, he could neither have painted the danger more fully, nor appealed to his son's feelings more effectually. Per- ceiving this, he gave h imself not little credit for sagacity, although he was as innot of any intention when he began, as the mother who bore him." "Very good," he said, placidly. "Don't tell me I did not warn you, when you come to tihe scaffold" This the Count said, as if everything was already arranged, and all Clovis had to do was to prepare for execution. "I rather think,' continued the Count, "that if any of those ministers pokes his scrutinizing b eye into my affairs, he will have that eye considerably punched." "But you have changed your mind very suddenly, haven't you?"c said Clovis.           -aal I have, assented hi father    I have a way of always following two plans-one, never to think if I possibly can helt it; the other, to think like the devil hiile I am about it. Now, old habit made me loyal; but I am not going to have the nose wrenched off my face for the love of old habits." "I cannot see what your nose has to do with the revolu- tion," remarked Clovis. "Possibly not," replied his father, complacently. "It would be out of reason to expect ayng an  ees  an old one. (Yah! yah! yah!  how terribly sleepy I am   DREAMS WITHN DREAMS.        173 again! Hang the coffee! It is as weak as a cat.) The whole question is this, and I will tell it to you, if you let me go to sleep afterward. The king wants to consolidate all power into his own hands. (Talking of cats, by-the-by, there was one yowling under my window this morning, until he set all my teeth on edge.) Now, the nobility, of course, won't let the king have his way--if I get hold of that infernal tomcat, I'll cure him of screeching under my window for a spell-" ' You would have another Runnemede?" said Clovis, anxious to bring his father back to the subject. "No," said the Count; "the time for that is past. Inde- pendence is an impossibility; we are too weak. (Remind me to blow the woman up for making the coffee so sloppy.) We must change masters." "How will that better us?" asked Clovis.   i "New brooms sweep clean," replied his father. "I won- der whether they had much to sweep up this morning." "But," said Clovis, " we must take care these new brooms do not sweep all our power away." "You talk like an ass, my son," replied the Count, benig- nantly. ' The true security of little States lies in the compli- cations of great powers. A pawn has been often known to make and mar a checkmate. I suppose you know there is a quantity of gunpowder in the cellar? You did not? Oh, yes I there is quite a little mine of it." This agreeable intelligence had not the anticipated effect. So far from being pleased, Clovis looked disagreeably surprised. "Why, father!" he remonstrated; " how could yol do such a thing? And under my bedroom, too I And, of all places, to choose the spot where the servants go with lighted torches!" "Permit me to regulate my own affairs," said the Count, severely. "This is no business of yours." "I think it is," replied Clovis, who was determined not to be talked down. "If you wish me to die for our rights-" "To die for a fiddlestick!" cried the Count, testily. ' Do you suppose I put it there for the sole purpose of blowing you up?" "No," replied Clovis; "but you might, for all that." "Might! " repeated the Count, impatiently. "I might do a great many things. I might boil your mother, but I don't mean to. Did ever anybody hear such a fool I Thinking I want to send him up like a skyrocket I " At least," said Clovis, "let me close the cellar up." <pb n="174-175" xml:id="VAC6560-00000096"/> 174      DREAMS WITH  DREAMS. "Of course," assented his father. "I can have no reason- able objection to that, as I have at least the full of a hogshead in the storeroom." "You have the full of a hogshead in the storeroom!" cried Clovis, horrified. "Why, father, I would not give a groat for our lives." "Upon my sacred word and honor," cried the Count, I believe you are drunk. Have I? Of course I have. And, what is more, there is no end of the stuff scattered all over the castle. Now don't bother me any more." So saying, the Count turned over with a grunt, and fell asleep forthwith. And so it was that the conspiracy, shadowed forth in the dream shown us by Somnus, was confided to Clo- vis; and now it flashed on him why my lord Clodolphus paid them so long a visit, and why so much communication passed between them and the several lords of the province. But Clovis, when he came to think over his father's com- munication, had sundry misgivings as to the prudence of trust- ing so great an enterprise to the discretion either of his parent, Godfroy, or my lord Clodolphus. But the more he reflected, the more cheerful the prospect became. "For," reasoned the young man, '" the revolution is evidently directed by able men, and the very fact that my father has been called into council at all, shows that everything has been long settled." With which1 unfilial conclusion he became better satisfied, and, indeed, not without some show of reason; as it was the wont of the Count's acquaintances never to ask his advice until they had fully made up their minds what to do-for the warmhearted and impetuous master of Bertrand Castle was no more fitted to give wholesome counsel than to lay eggs. So Clovis set to work to investigate the cellars. As he might have expected, they did not contain a grain of gunpow- der. High and low he hunted, but there was not a pinch of that material to be found anywhere. He peered into odd cor- ners; opened suspicious-looking barrels, boxes, and baskets; hauled down the woodpile; looked into the wine department, and was soon covered with dust and cobwebs. N o, not a grain! A crow, who is supposed to be able to smell that article of commerce at an inconceivable distance, would not have found its olfactory organs annoyed by its presence. In fine, there was none there. "t Now I wonder," said Clovis to himself, " what on earth my good father could have meant by telling me such fibs?"   DREAMS WITHN DREAMS.175 "Ts that you, Clovis?" cried his mother, peering down through the darkness. "Yes," said Clovis. "Come up here, then," said the Countess. "In a minute, mother," replied her son. "I am looking for something." "If it is powder you seek, you may as well give up," said the Countess, "Come up here, and I will tell you all about it." Clovis followed his mother to her room, where the old lady took a seat. and entered at once into the subject. ' I thought I knew what you were after, when you went down to the cel- lar, Clovis," said she. "It was my duty not to mention this until necessary. Your father, who makes a mystery so very mysterious that everybody finds the secret out at once, had two barrels of powder brought here one night, and placed in the cellar. I knew there was no use arguing with him; so I just had the stuff trundled to the pond in wheelbarrows, where-you will find it now, I dare say. The idea of that old creature ex- pecting a body could sleep in peace with that under the bed " "But," said Clovis, "father spoke of a quantity all over the house." "Of course he did," replied the old lady. "When did he ever look at a goose, and see a goose? No, no. It is either a swan or a vulture-just as he happens to be in the humor. No earthly power could ever make him believe it a goose, un- less he had said so, and then no earthly power could ever make him deny it. But I am not going to live in a powder mill, Clovis. Your father may cut up his antics until he is tired, if he only leaves me alone. But when it comes to piling up powder under one's bed, it is carrying things a little too far." Clovis laughed, and the old lady, who had grown warm on the subject, relaxed, and joined in his merriment. "Bless the man " she cried; "I wonder how he was brought up? He must have burst into life like a roasted chestnut, and kept up the habit ever since." Hereupon the old lady looked at her husband's portrait-a portrait with a very obstinate expression, which was the Count's to life-with so much fondness, and benevolence, and womanly pride, as there passed in her kind old heart the scenes of her youth, when she was a girl, and he a fine, impetuous youth, always in trouble, and always coming to her for advice: so much love and indulgence, that Clovis was affected. "Will    <pb n="176-177" xml:id="VAC6560-00000097"/> Nora," thought he, "be like her when old?" and his heart sank at the word; for he remembered another who never grew old, and who now slept in the churchyard, with a plain gold ring encircling her finger..                 :I It being now noon, and the guests (with the exception of  Simplicius and Ardor, of whom more anon) having descended, Clovis hastened to join them. They were assembled on the northwestern terrace, where the towers protected them from the sun. Nora, hanging fondly on her father's arm, was walk- ing with him up and down. My lord Clodolphus was laying down the law very energetically to Sir Wolfgang, who looked rather bored. Greeting these two, Clovis joined Nora and Piquemont, leaving the knight to the tender mercies of his kinsman. "Godfroy will be here to-day," said Piquemont, as Clovis approached. "It is long since we met, and I owe him no little reparation."  "You will not find much trouble in that," said Clovis.  "Godfroy has not the slightest idea what memory means, when the reminiscence is not pleasant. There never was such a fel- low." Piquemont looked pleased, for perhaps there is nothing  more attractive than to hear one fine young man praise an-  other. "And so," said he, there never was such a fellow, eh?"? "Never," replied Clovis, emphatically. When a boy, he did everything better than everybody else. The little boys  plagued him as much as they pleased; for he was like one of  those great, good-natured dogs who placidly take the impudent familiarity of the smaller as a matter of course, and one never  to be seriously considered. He was only once angry, in my Recollection, and that was when the son of a neighboring gen- tleman threw a stone and killed a blind man's dog. Godfroy was only twelve years old, but he immediately marched up to the boy's house, called for the boy's father, had the boy sum- moned, told the story, and wound up by reading the boy a moral lecture, which perfectly delighted the father. No; there never was such a fellow." How much I should like to know him I " said iNora. "Have you never seen him?" asked Clovis. "Not since I was a child," replied Nora. "Take care of your heart when you do,' said Clovis. "Godfroy has the strength of a Goliath, and the big heart of a   little child. I have seen him toss a hammer so as to make a smith stare; and I have seen him carry a dozen children at once, without hurting any. I shall be terribly jealous, and have no doubt Godfroy and myself will be cutting each other's throats before morning. He has a wonderful way with woman, and is an old rival of mine." Seeing he had unintentionally struck a painful chord, Clovis led the way to the fountain, where the others were standing. , No, my lord Clodolphus was saying as they approached; not at all. You are totally misinformed. The pygmies verily are not the same as the dwarfs of other nations. These little warriors, we read, inhabited Thrace, in houses made of egg. shells. They waged war with the storks, who invaded their country every year, coming in flocks from Scythia. Then these tiny gentlemen ywiss were wont to mount on partridges, rams, and goats, and valiantly go out to war, and smite the foe hip and thigh. Hercules was attacked by these little creatures, when sleeping after his battle with Antaus. The pygmies drew Lup in battle array ight skilfully. While the left wing assaulted his hand, the main body stormed his stomach, and the archers made a fierce onslaught on his feet. The queen, mean. while, at the head of picked troops, marched the forlorn hope against his head. Awakened by the arrows, Hercules looked round, and, seeing the frightful danger which threatened him, did verily laugh facetiously, and, gently sweeping the whole host into his lion skin, took them home as a sample of courage under difficulties. But the Celtic and aelic pygmies were creatures of quite another growth, having been formed from the giant Ima (or Ime, as some have it); that is to say, the earth -even as children, as I have been credibly informed, are verily wont to fabricate pies in the dirt. C0yrano de Bergerac--an author whose stories must be taken with divers pinches of salt -tells us, in his journey to the moon, that there are dwarfs there. His book of travels may have more right to credence than I can as yet admit; but if so, the pygmies must have entirely emigrated to that satellite, seeing that I have never beheld any myself, nor have I ever known any one who has. The Gnomes of Gothic and the Hochdoutsch mythology, are doubtless traces of the Icelanders; albeit verily we cannot but conjecture thereon. Still, he -who shall read the works of Bothius, the Norse ballads, and the traditions of Northern tongues-such as the Ostro and Vestro Gothic, the Dalekar. man, the Guldbrandsdalske, the Hardangerske, the Sueo-Gothic,    <pb n="178-179" xml:id="VAC6560-00000098"/> the Dcensk, and the Norraean Tunga, the Saxon and the Alt,- hochdeutsch-shall in sooth form divers opinions which the vul- gar do not." "What the devil's up?" asked the Count, now joining the  party. "What are you scratching your throat for with all those names? When I first heard you, I thought you were sick at your stomach, and then I thought somebody was dying. I did. I said to myself, If ever there was a mad dog round the castle, one has been here to-day biting somebody.' What do you do it for?" Said my lord Clodolphus "I have been quoting." "So I supposed," replied the Count; " bt, if you go on quoting in that way, friend, you will some day be falling down in a fit. Don't tell me. If you have not invented those names, as I very much suspect you have, and if there is, or ever was, a nation upon earth which talks that way in the face of the blessed sun, all I can say is, either you have no talent for the language, or the language has no benevolence for you. To tell me," concluded the Count, indignantly, "that anything but a wolf, and a wolf with a cold at that, could ever make such infernal sounds come out of its throat, would be to tell me I was a zebra-or a giraffe." And here the Count began to snort viciously. "What is that letter you hold in your hand?" inquired Clovis, anxious to change the subject, for my lord Clodolphus : was growing very red in the face.  "Why," replied his father, " here is another pretty mess.  Here is Godfrey writing to me that he'll be hanged if he will  come.' "? "Nonsense, father " said Clovis. "Godfroy never sent  you any such a message."  "You are a pretty fellow!" cried the Count. "You are a wise young man! Oh! you are as great a fool as your mother. Just what she said, when I told her the same thing. Oh, you born idiot!" "But," said Clovis, patiently, "Godfroy is not the man to send any such message." "Don't I tell you he does?" retorted the Count. "A    I nice son you are, to give your father the lie, and hunt for his curse. But I'll be hanged if you get it. I am not going to be bullied into a malediction, any more than I am to be bullied out of my hens. But, since you are so positive, and I, of  course, am always in the wrong, I will read you the message: -           I ...   'My dear Count, I will be hanged if I come to the castle, unless my kinsman promises to meet me as if nothing has hap. pened.' There! I am wrong, am I not? Of course; I always "But you did not mention the last part of the sentence," said my lord Clodolphus. "I don't see that. it mends the matter," replied the Count "Indeed  began my lord Clodolphus, when the Count interrupted him. Now don't," said he; "don't, for goodness' sake, begin  We will suppose we know all Julius Casar has said on the matter, all the devil has said and all Robin Hood, the old man of the mountain, and Saint Austin-or, as you improperly cal him, Augustine-- "I deny that! cried m ylord Clodolphus. "I do not," said the Count. "You cannot prove it," quoth my lord Clodolphus. CI can," said the Count. "There is Arnobis of Sicca, Julius Firmicus Maternus, Lactantius, Saint John Chrysostomrn, Commodianus, Evagrius Ponticus, Prudentius of Saragossa, Antiochus of Ptolemais, John of Jerusalem, Zozimus of Rome, and Synesius the Pla. tonist," cried my lord Clololphus, rapidly. Confound your long aongue!" replied the Count. "There is Charles Bertrand of Bertrand, and he is better than all your Cesars and fellows. I tell you his name is Austin, and that is an end of the matter." "If this be really Godfroy's wish," began Piquemont, when the Count turned short on him, and said: "Oh I I did not see you. What do you think of it?" "It is very plain," answered Piquer ont, "the young man wishes to spare my feelings." "Maybe so," said the Count, with an incredulbus sniff; "but I cannot, for the life of me, see the use of all this fuss." There is no fuss, as you call it, at all," replied Piquemont smiling. "It is just a  fuss Godfry delicately wishes to avoid."                    wishes to "Well," rejoined the Count, "all I know, is, that I differ with you, and I rather fancy I have given that young man a pretty thorough blow up.

' But I have; and, what is more, I will thank Godfroy to attend to it." "And what was that answer?" asked Piquemont; "for you must remember how very delicately I am placed." "Pooh! pooh!" cried the Count. "I really am, my dear friend," urged Piquemont. "Delicately!" said the Count. "What are you talking about? You are as bad as my lord Clodolphus with his Saint Austin." "Augustine," quoth my lord Clodolphus. "Austin," said the Count, dogmatically. "You must really allow me to differ with you, my dear friend," urged Piquemont. "Tell me, what was your mes- sage?" "I told him," replied the Count, "to mind his own busi- ness, or words to that effect-maybe a little stronger. That was worthy of Austin himself." "Augustine," murmured my lord Clodolphus, "Austin," said the Count, pitching the word, as it were, at my lord Clodolphus over his shoulder. "But, father, upon my word," said Clovis, "this is serious. I must overtake the messenger, and send another reply. With that he started off for the stable. As he was hurry- ing, he met his mother with Godfroy's servant. The Countess had overheard her husband's answer, and intercepted the ser- vant on his return. "Thank you, mother," was all Clovis said, and he hurried the man back to the terrace. "Tell Lord Godfroy," said Piquemont, " that I will act as he requested." "And say," added the Count, " that he is a great, big, fat, blundering nincompoop, to require any such assurance." "Pray do not say any such thing," said Piquemont, hastily. "Give him simply my message." The man nodded, and departed with Clovis, who attended him to the gate, impressing upon him the necessity of adding nothing to the message. "Bless you, master Clovis!" said the manr, grinning, "I know. We never mind what your father sdys. He always is a-saying something." With which the ser ant touched his hat, and trotted off. "Now, will you have the goodness to tell me," said the Count, as Clovis and the servant walked away, "what the deuce is in the wind? People always seem to have a horror of whatever I do."

"But I seem to be always mistaken," said the Count, "even when I speak of Saint Austin." "Augustine," quoth my lord Clodolphus. "Austin," replied the Count, firmly. ' You are not always mistaken, I assure you," said Pique- mont. "But you are sometimes, and so are the wisest and holiest." "(Well, then," sighed the Count, as if he contemplated a harsh ruling of fate which must be borne with patience and resignation; "well, then, I suppose I must be one of the wisest and holiest, without knowing it. Perhaps even I am uncon- sciously a cherubim." "A cherub, quoth my lord Clodolphus, correcting him. "Hang it!" cried the Count. "I do not see why you have to shove your spoon in whenever I talk! How do you know what I mean?  To suppose I don't know the difference be- tween a cherub and a cherubim " .  "A cherub is singular," quoth my lord Clodolphus, "and cherubim is its plural; as seraphim of seraph, and children of child. You must not say a cherubim." "I should just like to see you, or any other man, try to stop me," replied the Count, with defiance in his eye. "I mean to be a cherubim just as much as I please. This is a land of liberty, I believe?" At this moment Clovis returned, and proceeded to change the topic of conversation, as he often had to do when the Count and my lord Clodolphus had an argument. "You have often promised me," he said to the latter, "to tell me the origin of the Tartar tribes. Do you know I am impatient to hear all about them?" "Lord love the man!" cried the Count, when he heard this, hurrying Sir Wolfgang away to another part of the ter- race; "Clovis is a born fool I What on earth is he winding up that windy old machine for?- He might be sure Clodolphus would not run down for two mortal hours at least. But what is all this about Hartrettet?

"We caught the goose, at any rate," said the knight, smil- ing. "I So you did,"\ replied the Count. "But how is it I am the last man to hear of what occurs under my nose? "The Countess says you were told fifty times over, and would never believe it," answered the knight. "Yes, I know," said the Count; "but. that was because old Folio-I mean Clodolphus by that, you understand-began a long story about Nimrod (I do believe the man never can tell anything, without beginning at the creation, or a little before), and so bothered me, that I thought he wished me to believe my castle was in a state of siege. Why could he not say robbers at once, and let a man understand him?" "I must confess he misled me," said Sir Wolfgang. "My dear young man," replied the Count, in a fatherly tone, "you will learn experience one day. As a proper begin- ning, let me tell you that a great reader and a great booby are synonymous terms. If a man opens a book, he is virtually, if not actually a fool." I was also misled," continued Sir Wolfgang, waiving dis- cussion, "by the name Claude Hartrettet. I had always heard him mentioned as Wild Dick o' the Woods. In fact, Claude, or Dick, sent me the very dog Romulus who is with me. I never saw him until yesterday, but I have been in communica- tion with him. He is really no robber at all, but one of our recruiters, who, I suppose. has used the name of brigand to conceal his real purpose. And now you know all I know." CHAPTER XVI. SHOWING, AMONG OTHER THNGS, HOW, IN THAT DREAM WITHN A DREAM CALLED LIFE, THE SAME VISIONS WILL OCCUR TO TWO PEOPLE, COMMONLY CALLED PLAGIARISM WHEN PUT TO FAPER.* Now Ardor, having, among other things, openly declared (although we forgot to mention it), at Toservem's tavern, that he intended to capture the notorious freebooter, Claude Hart. * The mystery of this title we leave to wiser heads to clear up.-ED.   DREAMS WITHN DREAMS.       183 rettet, alive or dead, had received a communication purporting to come from one Barnabas, and offering to betray Claude for a remuneration. Having forgotten all about it, Ardor was just about joining the company on the tertace, when Samuel an- nounced a visitor. The stranger was a tall and unfortunately melancholy-looking customer, with his clothes hanging some. how or another on him, and presenting, altogether, a generally baggy appearance, especially about the hips. Out of an ex- tremely wiry and decidedly tangled pair of whiskers, two enor- mous ears, very red, and with a strong inclination to stick out at right angles with his head, added a new grace to his charms. Politely bowing, the visitor solemnly took a chair, and, setting it opposite Ardor, sat down gravely, placed both his hands on his knees, and said: "You will excuse me, if I take a seat. You will forgive me, if I place it thus. You will pardon me, if I have drawn it up too close. Secrets are best not spoken loudly too near walls." "Indeed," replied Ardor, leaning back, and regarding his extraordinary visitor with unfeigned astonishment. "Pardon me," continued the other, "if I suggest the expe- diency of your not elevating your voice. You will excuse me for so doing, I am sure." "Will you have the goodness to tell me who the devil you are?" said Ardor, leaning forward. The other shed tears. "I am," said he, "the fatted calf killed for my brother's delectation." "Your brother must have found you rather tough," replied Ardor. "But a truce to allegory, and let me know your name." "Barnabas," said the other. "I am the man, you know-" "Oh I I know," answered Ardor. "You need not go into particulars. Well, master Barabbas-" "Barnabas," said the other. "It don't matter," replied Ardor, significantly. "I fancy you take more after the villain than the apostle. To begin with, let me assure you, that if you had stood among a thou- isand, you would have been the last I should have marked as the one I wanted." "You will forgive me," said Barnabas, " if I remind you of the ancient adage, that a cat whose fur has been super- ficially burned is better than she seemeth." And here the man wept.    <pb n="184-185" xml:id="VAC6560-00000101"/> ' vv ny, wnat are you crying aoout r asKeca -ruor. "You will excuse me," replied Barnabas, "when I tell you this is the anniversary of my grandmother's death. It is a melancholy day for me. Certain days of the year I always set apart for woe." '"Very proper," remarked Ardor, yawning, " and very pious." "My mother," continued Barnabas, " died on the first of July. A dear sister of hers perished on the seventeenth of February; and, what is a strange coincidence, just nineteen years, seven months, and three days before her death, her dear aunt expired in Villaburg. I have also days set apart for lamentations over the memory of six cousins, an aged grand- father, three dear friends, and an uncle." "You must have your time pretty well employed," said Ardor. "Rather, thank you kindly," replied Barnabas. "Oh! but it is a sad thing to lose one's kinsmen. (Here he took out an immense brick-colored cotton handkerchief.) They all left a little property (here he wept copiously); and it all came to me." "Very consoling," murmured Ardor, with a yawn. "You must pardon me," replied Barnabas; riot at all con- soling. Filthy lucre cannot take the place of-of beaming countenances." "Of course not," acquiesced Ardor. "What is'money, after all?" continued Barnabas. "Mere dust," "So it is," said Ardor. "' Why should we wish to collect it?" pursued Barnabas. "The grave opens, and in we roll; but we don't carry our cash box with us. Ah, poor Thomas I Thomas left me a herd of swine, when he departed for the happy land. You should have known Thomas. He was a heavy loss to me. Many .and many an evening-a merry evening-have I spent listenilg to him imitate a pig whose throat is being out. He taught me the same; thus." And, before Ardor could prevent him, Barnabas faithfully ,executed a correct imitation of a hog in the last agony. "For goodness' sake, stop that infernal noise " cried Ardor, indignantly. "I don't know but you are right," answered Barnabas. "Poor Thomas  I He was a merry soul. Alas i life is short.   hayen hve I seen him dance to the tune of 'All around the haycock;' thus." And, again to Ardor's astonishment, Barnabas, taking hold of his trunks as a lady holds her dress in the dance, gravely began skipping round the room, accompanying himself with a melodious hum. "Sit down, sir!" thundired Ardor; "sit down, or I will discharge you at once. A man of your age, too I Sit down, I tell you." "Alas!" said Barnabas, as he obeyed, "we are weak and erring. Oh I that-" "Now stop!" interrupted Ardor, shaking his forefinger at him. "Talk another word of nonsense, and I discharge you. To business, man. How much do you expect for betraying your comrades? Will fifty pieces of silver do? rMoney, as I said before," replied Barnabas, is but filthy lucre. For less than seventy-five I could not consent to make the wife a widow, and the children fatherless. Thank heaven! I have a conscience." "So it seems," said Ardor, "and a very nice one, too. Allow me to congratulate you on its possession." "Thank you," replied Barnabas. "Your honor is prob. ably not acquainted with Joe, the herdsman?" "I certainly do not number him among my particular friends," said Ardor. "The loss is yours," answered Barnabas. "While my uncle Peter still dwelt in this vale of tears, Joe was a great favorite of his. Well, Joe always said unto me 'Barney you have as elastic a conscience as any man in the country." "I agree with Joe," said Ardor. "It will gratify him to hear it," said Barnabas. What is life without sympathy-"i "I say, master Barnabas, or Barabbas, or whatever your name is," said Ardor, interrupting him, "do you know that you aro the most prodigious hypocrite in the land-?" "  No, answered Barnabas. "Well, you know it now," said Ardor. "So, having set- tled that distinctly, let us proceed to business. You shall have the seventy five pieces, if you faithfully execute your part; and, burn me! if you won't have a cracked skull if I catch you tripping. Do you understand that, you traitor?" "Even so," replied Barnabas. "Fain would I be lowly--" "Let me talk now," continued Ardor.

Now, you are to have seventy-five-no more. Ask for another, under any pretext whatsoever, and you will have none. Do you understand that, you Judas?" "Even so," replied Barnabas. "Now do not misunderstand me, for your own sake," pur- sued Ardor.  Seventy-five, and no more, if successful; noth- ing, if unsuccessful; and a cracked crown, if treacherous." "Even so," replied Barnabas. "Very well," concluded Ardor. "Wait here a moment, until I call up a friend." Ardor then went to seek my lord Clodolphus. He was gone about ten minutes or a quarter of an hour, for he had to wait until that learned man had ended his remarks to Clovis about the origin of the Tartars. When they returned, Barna- bas was gone. The following letter, which he left upon the table, explained the cause of his abrupt departure: , MY DEAR FELLOW: Not thinking, upon due consideration, that I could betray Claude for so small a remuneration, I resign my commission as Judas. Will you have the kindness to give my love to Slmpy? Believe me, as ever, Yours affectionately,  C. H. Ardor read the epistle with a horrified expression on his lineaments. "By all I honor," he cried, as he set it down, "it was Claude himself. The impudence of the blackguard! actu- ally to come here and pay me a visit. Why, the fellow was here only a quarter of an hour. ago, squealing like a pig, and dancing to the tune of 'All round the haycock.'" "Why, it was not Claude you verily desired to capture?" quoth my lord Clodolphus. "To be sure it was," replied Ardor. In sooth," quoth my lord Clodolphus, "have you been at the chase after a wild goose; the which bird belongs to the tribe yclept Anser in the Latin tongue, and is both migratory and gregarious. But who is Simpy?" "Simplicius, I suppose," answered Ardor. "And then to have the face to call me 'my dear fell6w,' and to sign himself 'yours affectionately '-the impudent vagabond " Said iny lord Clodolphus: ' Verily is Claude fond of jocu- larity. Verily is he whimsical. Verily is he facetious. Verily hath he tricked you, my dear young friend.  What saith Terence?  '0 frater, frater! quid ego nunc te laudem?' Verily is he cunning, but verily, also, would he never cheat me, now that I have see a him face to face."   DREAMS WITHN DREAMS.        18T At this moment, Samuel knocked at the door. "Well, what now?" asked Ardor. "The man who came with the other, asks to see him," an- swered the servant. Oho I!" said Ardor. "Blows the wind in that direction? Show him up, Samuel, by all means. Ah," he continued, after the servant left, "the fellow will find himself in a pretty trap." "Verily," quoth my lord Clodolphus, " even as divers have done, hath this man fallen in his own ambuscade. Thus were, for example, sundry monsters slain by Theseus, son of JEgeus, king of Athens, and .Ethra, daughter of Pittheus, king and founder of Trcezene in the Peloponnesus; among whom, verily, the most renowned were, the brigand of Epidauria; Sciron (or Scirris, I forget, in sooth, wjhich), who waylaid travellers in the mountain gorges near Megara, and whom Theseus kicked off a rock, and s6nt whizzing into the dire abyss, where, verily, he was considerably squashed when he reached the bottom. Then there was Sinnis, or rather Synnis, besides a mysterious person called Phaea, on whose identity, in sooth, scholars are divided: some opining it was a sow, others a woman who could not have been over cleanly-id est, according to the observa- tion of my limited-" But here my lord Clodolphus was interrupted by a knock at the door, and the man expected was announced. He was a tall, red-headed, red-bearded fellow, with a fiery complexion, and rather a sheepish expression, and had an awkward way of jerking out his sentences, as if he wished to spit them in your face. He made a clownish bow, and stood staring straight before him. "So you want Master Barnabas, do you?" asked Ardor. "I'm sure I ought to," replied the rustic, gruffly. "He's got my hat, and he promised to be down in five minutes, and he a'n't come, and I a'n't going to wait no longer." "If he has your hat, my opinion is you will never see it again," remarked Ardor, quietly. "In sooth, even so," added my lord Clodolphus. "What! Baint he honest?" asked the peasant. "Not in the slightest degree, let me assure you," answered Ardor, urbanely. "Whatever Claude Hartrettet lays hands on, he keeps-at least," he concluded, prudently qualifying the remark, " unless the thing should prove too hot or too heavy." "Why, him warn't Claude, were he?" asked the rustic, ' H   gaping.      <pb n="188-189" xml:id="VAC6560-00000103"/> "I can assure you he was," replied Ardor. "Verily," growled my lord Clodolphus, who thought an "amen" dexterously thrown in now and then, would not be amiss. ' And now," continued Ardor, suavely, "will you have the condescension to inform me how you came in his company?" "I never come in his company nohow," said the rustic. "He come in mine. And he took my hat. And I a'n't got none." "Well, go home, and never do so again," replied Ardor. "For a man like you, the experience of to-day will be far more profitable than a volume of good advice." "Verily," growled my lord Clodolphus. "So go away, there's a good fellow," said Ardor. "I woan't go hone," said the rustic. "You won't go home?" replied Ardor. No, I woan't go home without my hat," said tfle rustic. "Really, my good fellow," reasoned Ardor, " we have not got your hat." "I don't care," said the peasant; "I want my hat." "Go to the devil!" cried Ardor. "I woan't," said the rustic. "I tell you we know nothing about your property," said Ardor. "I don't want my property," replied the rustic. "I a'n't got none. 'I want my hat." "Now, what on earth are we to do with the man?" asked Ardor, looking hopelessly at my lord Clodolphus. "Have you no old one?" asked that learned man, who was slightly inclined to laugh. "t No," answered Ardor. "What are we to do? Look at him there. Just look at him. Is there no law in the land?" "Verily, but little," replied my lord Clodolphus, smiling. "Can nothing induce you to go away, man?" inquired Ardor, appealing to the rustic, who simply reiterated his inten- tion of not taking his leave without the' article in question. "I believe I have an old hat," said my lord Clodolphus, rising up rather loath (for he loved not motion). "Wait here, friend." So saying, the learned man trotted heavily off. While he was absent, Ardor, disdaining to hold any further communica- tion with the peasant, who was staring round the ceiling, and - occasionally wiping his mouth with the back of his hand, turned ' . -  - *n,    LOt his back, and took up a book. He was suddenly startled from his revery by the sound of a key in a lock, and, turning quicly, saw the peasant just going out, and fitting the key of the door outside. The peasant, having achieved this performance to his own entire satisfaction, then put his thumb to his nose, grinned the grin of Barnabas, alias Claude Hartrettet, nodded, and said, 'Yours affectionately." Ardor made a rush at the door, but Claude was too quick for him. le had closed and locked it before Ardor could stop him. "Let me out, scoundrel!" cried Ardor. 'All. round the haycock!"' replied Claude, jocosely, through the keyhole. "Let me out, I say I " cried Ardor. "Love to Simpy!" answered Claude, walking away. As he was departing, he met my lord Clodolphus, who was returning with the hat. Humbly accepting the same with many thanks, Claude informed him that Ardor wanted to see him very much, and then walked grinning away. While Claude was playfully sporting with Ardor, more to his own than that gentleman's amusement, Simplicius, armed with his friend's authority, went in quest of one Christopher Xacca, an astrologer, to profit by his aid in shaping out their future course. And here we must pause a moment for a little explanation. The two lovelorn gentlemen began to feel more and more uneasy as they approached the seat of war nearer and nearer. Now, as the good reader very well knows, astrology was com- monly believed in the seventeenth century, although long past the zenith of its popularity. Hence our two valiant friends argued that could they but secure the approbation of some man eminent in the science of the stars, they would have excuse enough for backing out of danger. Simplicius had not the slightest faith in astrology, but Ardor instructed him nevertheless not to spare money, to pre. tend to be a devout believer, and to make love the pretext of his visit. On the other hand, Xacca, although a soothsayer by profession, considered astrology a humbug, and had a huge con- tempt for all who had faith in the stars. Finding sorcery profit- able, however, and, moreover, not being overburdened with conscience, he looked upon necromancy as about as good a trade as another. Being averse to physical exertion, and hav. h,  4    <pb n="190-191" xml:id="VAC6560-00000104"/> 190       DREAMS WITHN DREAMS. ing no extraordinary yearning for military fame, he naturally argued that astrology was a good short cut to competence with the least possible amount of trouble or risk. Thus, with secret feelings of contempt for each other, but a great show of humil- ity on one side, and condescension on the other, Simplicius and Xacca began their conversation. "You have come, my son," said the sorcerer, when he had gravely heard Simplicius, and solemnly pocketed the donation, "you have come to inquire of the seven planets and twelve constellations, things not otherwise to be discovered. Please to remember, Saturn and Jupiter rule your two ears." "Certainly," replied Simplicius, politely. "Mars and Venus," continued the sorcerer, " rule your nos- trils. Do you follow me?" "To be sure," answered Simplicius. "The sun and moon," continued the soothsayer, "govern your eyes." "Do they, now?" asked Simplicius. "Yes," replied the magician. "One one eye, t'other, t'other." "Bless my soul!" cried Simplicius. "I believe you," said Xacca, impressively. "Mercury sways'your mouth." "You don't say so!" quoth Simplicius. "I do, replied the astrologer, firmly. "I want to know!" said Simplicius. "And well you may, my son," quoth the soothsayer. "And, what is more, if you are born under Saturn, you are saturnine; if under Jove, jovial; if under Mars, martial; if under the sun (SoD, solemn-" "Why, a'n't everybody born under the sun?" asked Sim- plicius. "You be quiet," replied the seer, majestically. "If you are born under the moon (Luna), you are a lunatic; if under Mercury, mercurial; if under Venus, Veni, vidi, vici." "And what kind of a thing is that?" asked Simplicius. "Veni, vidi, vici," replied the soothsayer, "are three Greek words, meaning, I came, I saw 'em, and I walloped 'em. All born under Venus, come, sec-- 'em, and wallop 'em." "Wallop whom?" asked Simplicius. "Whoever they see," replied the enchanter. "You, for instance, were born under Venus. You therefore have only to go in and win."   DREAMS WITHN DREAMS.        191 Simplicius now began to think there might be something in astrology after all. "The stars," pursued Xacca, "require the corroboration of human efforts, whereby subjective affections may become trans. migrated into objective." "Hold up!" cried Simplicius. "I may as well say at once, I don't understand a word of all that. Don't begin that way again."  "Very well," said Xacca, condescendingly. "I cannot always remember others have not pursued the great science as deeply as myself. What would you with me?" "Advice in love," answered Simplicius. "The first thing I would advise you to do," said Xacca, "would be to wash yourself." "Just so," answered Simplicius. Is that necessary?" "Absolutely so," said the seer, solemnly. "Do the stars recommend that?" asked Simplicius, anx. iously. "They do," replied the necromancer. "Well," sighed Simplicius, "I suppose it must be done, then. It is only once, after all." "I should next advise you," continued the sorcerer, "to comb your hair. Otherwise the conjunction of the- planets might be neutralized. I should also advise you to procure a clean pair of boots. The constellation of Bootes requires "Does it really, now?" inquired Simplicius. "It does," replied the enchanter. Astrology seems a queer kind of a thing, don't it?" de- manded Simplicius. "I believe you," returned the wizard, solemnly. "A lot of dodges are always being tried up in the sky. You get Mars and Venus in a tangle-that's a conjunction. You can't see the moon, perhaps. Why?  Because the sun is in the way. There you have another conjunction. Mind and look after the conjunctions, and there you are." "Where?" asked Simplicius. "There," replied the soothsayer. "Don't you ask too many questions, my son. You stick to your business, and leave me to mine. At present you want to go home--to bring, in other words, your lady love and yoursalf into conjune. tion. That is the point, I believe?" "I suppose so," answered Simplicius.    <pb n="192-193" xml:id="VAC6560-00000105"/> 4 Don't you know so?" asked the soothsayer. "Devil a bit," replied Simplicius. "How am I to know whether I want her in a conjunction or not, when I don't know what you mean? Is it anything like an embrace? Because, if it is, I am agreeable." An embrace certainly is a conjunctionl" remarked Xacca. "Well, then, all right, and fire away," said Simplicius. "Let us have as many conjunctions as you please, and as quick as you please." "Are you a musician?" asked Xacca. "A perfect one," answered Simplicius, complacently. "Can you sing?" asked Xacca, suavely. "N o," replied Simplicius, decidedly. "Oh! you only play, then," said Xacca, urbanely. "Can't play a single note," replied Simplicius, shortly. "But, you must either sing or play, if you are a musician," said Xacca, bewildered. "Why?" demanded Simplicius, sternly.  "Because a musician must either sing or play," replied Xacca, dogmatically. "I don't know that," said Simplicius, obstinately. "Why don't you know that?" asked Xacca, aghast. Because I don't," replied Siinplicius, surlily. "Pray, what is your idea of a musician?" asked Xacca, scornfully. "I haven't very clear ideas on the subject," answered Sim- plicius, sulkily. "I should not think you had," said Xacca, contemptuously. "At any rate, permit me to say, my crude ideas on the subject are, that a musician must be one or the other, or both." "Oh, indeed!" remarked Simplicius, more quietly. "Yes," said Xacca, a little mollified, but still with some degree of loftiness in his manner. "And since you can do neither, you must not call yourself a musician. Can you write poetry?" "Which?" asked Simplicius. "Poetry," repeated Xacca. "No," said Simplicius. "Can you write any composition?" demanded Xacca. "Which?" asked Simplicius. Composition," repeated Xacca. "No," said Simplicius. Xacca looked at him mildly. "What on earth cam you do?" he asked, after a moment. . X. v e    "Say that again, will you?" demanded Simplicius. "Are you deaf?" bowled Xacca. "No!" bawled Simplicius back. "Then why the deuce do you make me repeat every- thing? bawled Xacca. "Because you ask such strange questions, that I can hardly believe my ears," replied Simplicius. "Do you think a man has nothing better to do than read? One would suppose you thought me a genius." "I never made such a mistake," said the astrologer. "Oh I wouldn't have cared if you had," answered Sim. plicius. "But, however, let bygones be bygones. What about Liebchen? Shall I go and see her?" "Decidedly," replied Xacca. "You neer ought to have t And Ardor?" "Also." "Good!" "And remember," continued Xacca, "for the future to keep a loving subservience to the dear one's inclinations." "Does that mean giving up to her?" asked Simplicius. "Certainly," replied Xacca. "What! in everything?" pursued Simplicius. "For a time--yes," answered the wizard, with a wink. Simplicius scratched his head. "Don't do that over my cold chicken! cried the necro. mauncer, hastily. "Beg pardon," said Simplicius. "Well, good by. Yo have got out of me all you can, and I have got out of you all I can. If you are as satisfied as I am, we are a couple. Mind you indorse my return?" "I do," said the necromancer, with a wink. "AIl right I hope you may enjoy a good conjunctiont. a Tyhankee," replied Simplicius, nodding, and walking away. We must now give our history a push in another direction for, if we mistake not, we hear the sound of a trumpet, we see the glittering of silk banners, and we smell afar off the war. Ia! a flourish of trumpets. Soon shall our friends be roused by the alarms of battle. The whole land was now in a state of insurrection, but, no blow had been struck yet. Uphorn, however, was busily em. ployed, and couriers galloped through the land in every dire- 9                  ever     <pb n="194-195" xml:id="VAC6560-00000106"/> 194      DREAMS WITHN DREAMS. tion. It was reported that Uphorn had received the royal ulti- matum, but what would result, only the initiated knew. On the very day when Rumor gave this last report, four young officers were leisurely strolling about the ruins where we first found Piquemont, chatting cheerfully, laughing gayly, and looking here and there with careless curiosity. Their names were Adolphe de Cerci, Hollar, Max Reissel, and Hans von Schnapsheim. "Truly a venerable old pile," said Hans. "Really, I do not know,' languidly drawled De Cerci. "It seems to me, ruins are very stupid places-mere rubbish. I don't know really what we came here for. Let us go back to our horses." "'Bah " said Max; "you never care for anything but horses and dogs, women and wine." "Well," drawled De Cerci, languidly, " does not your song go: "Who loves not women, wine, and song, Remains a fool his whole life long." "Certainly," added Hans; "and, to suit De Cerci here, we should add a couple of lines, and say: "But who loves these, his dog, and horse. Is wise, and good, and brave, of course." "Bah!" drawled Adolphe. "But who is that person over yonder? A stranger, really. He seems a plebeian." And he stroked his mustache languidly. If the young officers had looked round, they might have seen a number of men cautiously surrounding them. The per- son who approached them now was no other than Claude. As he advanced, six men, armed with carbines, emerged from the keep, and took their stations silently at a short distance. Hollar, who had hitherto said nothing, shot an uneasy glance round, and understood their danger at once. "Be on your guard," lie whispered. "I told you not to come. I feared something would happen. Do not seem to notice anything, but notice everything." At this moment Claude came up. "Good day, gentle- men," said he. "I am sorry to disturb so agreeable a party; but you are my prisoners.". "Really!" replied Adolphe. "We are much obliged to you; but you should positively, my fine fellow, first ask our consent. If you are a robber (and I am sure I cannot imagine   DREAlMS WITRtN DREAMS.       195 who else would dare stop the: king's officers), you are a very stupid one. What, is to prevent us four taking you prisoner, and holding you as a hostage? Really, my dear fellow, yo are imprudent--upon my soul, you are!" Claude smiled. "I am afraid, gentlemen," said he, "tha you are not nimble enough for that; and to make hare soup, the hare must first be caught. Besides, there stand six dead- shots. I should like to know how long it would take a bullet to come over here? Gentlemen, it is the fortune of war. pray you, surrender your swords."tune of warI "Really, this i very annoying," replied Adolphe. "And pray, what are you going to do with us, Master Robber?" "No robber," said Claude. "You are prisoners to his grace the Duke of Uphorn."            to his What! has the revolution actually come to blows?" asked Hans, eagerly. "I f it has not, it soon will," said Max swin d  ing his hand on the hilt of his sword. am not the man to give this (here he tapped the hilt) to any peasant holding corm. mission under a rebel, be he duke or devil." "Let us hear this man first," said Adolphe. "And, my good friend, is it your kind intention to keep us in this delight. "No," replied Claude, respectfully but decidedly; "I shall convey you to Bertrand Castle." "Bertrand a rebel!" exclaimed Hollar. Wor ds are but sounds," replied Claude, sternly. Rebel or no rebel, you must share the Count's hospitality, by fair means or by force." "Very strange!" remarked Adolphe. "Why, I have a letter of introduction to the Count from a friend of his son, who is in our regiment."            his son "You will have a chance of presenting it,' replied Claude. "But come, gentlemen; will you surrender your swords peace- ably, or must we take them?" "Come and take them," cried Max, unconscious that he Was uttering words rendered immortal by history. "I really am  afraid you must, my good fellow, said Adolphe. The four drew, and stood on guard. Claude leaped back, and gave a shrill whistle. Instantly, like at the sound of Rod. enctk Dhu's signal, armed men sprang up on all sides. The young officers drew back. Hollar, who had been rapidly roll    <pb n="196-197" xml:id="VAC6560-00000107"/> ing his eyes round, cried: "Follow!" and leaped into the ditch. The descent was twenty feet. The others followed at once, and all, except Adolphe, reached the bottom safely. De Cerci's ankle was sprained. "Run," he cried; "I will keep these hounds at bay." And he advanced limping, sword in hand. "Fire not! fire not! Take them alive!" cried Claude, who was struck with admiration at the gallantry and boldness of the manceuvre. And down came Hartrettet at the head of fifty of his men, while as many advanced each side up the ditch. Max, Hollar, and Hans now encircled their wounded friend, who could hardly support himself. Max, throwing his arm round Adolphe's waist, held his sword ready, and stood frown- ingly awaiting the attack. Hans and Hollar, their faces flushed, their eyes darting fire, and their bright blades glitter- ing in the sun, intrepidly prepared for the mortal struggle to come. No idea of surrender, even under such' desperate cir- cumstances, ever entered the minds of these hairbrained youths, who saw a hundred men rushing on them from every side, with as much eagerness for the fray as if they themselves headed an equal number. We cannot say what would have resulted, had they come  to blows. But, at the critical moment, a man in full armor galloped up, and ordered the assailants to stop. The cry of "Rappenhammer!" was raised, as the men obeyed. Reining in his horse within a few feet of the officers, he uncovered his head, and displayed the martial bearing which we only see in old soldiers. "Gentlemen," he said, courteously, " sheathe your swords. Resistance would be as criminal as useless. I am here to bear witness to your gallantry. Do not force me to witness youri death." "My lord," replied Hans, "we willingly surrender to a nobleman; but-"             '  "But," interrupted Rappenhammer, " you need not. Keep. your weapons. Claude, guide these gentlemen to the castle, and be yourself at Rochateau to-night. Excuse me, gentle- men, if I leave you abruptly. I have the honor of saluting you."  With which he rode away as suddenly as he came. Their horses being ready, Adolphe was gently assisted to mount, and the four, guided by Claude, slowly set off toward the castle. --------- -kaY1   CHAPTER XVII. NIGHT AND MORNING. SILENCE brooded henlike over Castle Bertrand.  In a lonely tower sat Hollar and his companion, Hans von Schnaps. can; but Uphorn forbids parole for the present, so I must coop you up, till I receive further orders. He then received their swords courteously-for the Coun could be polite enough when he veral pose-and ordered the young men to be conducted to their several places of confinement; Adolphe and Max to one room, and Hans and Hollar to tVe turret, where we found them at the beginning of the chapter. "I thougt as much, said Hans as he threw himself down in a richly carved armchair. "The king has roused every noble to arms. You will soon be obliged o resign your com. mission, if this continues." "I know it," said Hollar, absently. "But we must first get out of this. I do not like making a virtue of necessity." "I wonder what your father will do?" remarked Hans, throwing his legs over nuother chair, and leaning back lazily. "Can't say," replied -Hollar, who was carefully looking round. "This move of Bertrand and Rappenhammer, I think, will turn the scales. Many who hesitated, will follow suit. And let me tell youl one thing more, Hans: Treviot will be taken as sure as it is attacked." "How so?" inquired Hans. "The king is crazed, I believe," replied Hollar. "W t. ever my father says, I will draw no sword against Uporn; and nine tenths of the garrison side with us who say so. "You do not mean to say, after this morning-" I did not know who attacked us; secondly, I drew my sword in self-defence; lastly, I defended my friends. But enough of that. I have had my eyes about me, and we must escape." "Good  " said Hans. "Which way do you prefer--walk. ing through a cast-iron door, or out of a window one hundred feet from the ground?"    <pb n="198-199" xml:id="VAC6560-00000108"/> 198      DEEAMS WITHN DREAMS. "I shall choose the window," replied Hollar. "Good again," said Hans. 'Perhaps you have a pair of wings." i"I have something as good," answered Hollar. "What do you think of this?" And, as he spoke, he dragged the end of a rope from under the bed. "Why! where the devil did you get that?" asked Hans, astonished. "Oh  I know the Count of old," replied Iollar. "He never thinks of anything. He keeps this here in case of fire, as a means of escape, and thus has put us in the only room in the castle where windows and doors are of no avail. Wait until night, and then-" Hans looked at Hollar, and he looked at the room, and then he gave a long whistle. Night came at last, and the two young men were attended to by Clovis himself, who sat a while chatting, and finally left them to a ttete--tete. The night wore on. They heard the tramp of horses, then a great bustle, then, after an hour or so, the tramp again, as if horsemen were departing. Then silence brooded, henlike, over Castle Bertrand. "Now is our time," said Hollar, looking out the win- dow. The night was dark, and the wind swept past, rustling through the trees of the park with a solemn sound. The moon had not yet risen, and dark clouds hid almost all the stars, although a few peeped here and there through the openings, and seemed all the brighter for not having too many rivals. "So much the better," said Hollar. "We can slide down the rope, escape into the woods, make a circuit, and be safe in Tre- viot before morning." "It is a fearful descent," concluded Hollar, calmly; "but freedom is at one end, and a prison at the other. I am for liberty's end." "So am I," replied Hans. "Who will go first?" "It makes no odds," answered Hollar. ' Shall I, or shall we toss up?" "Toss up," said Hans. "Here is a coin. What do you say?" "Heads." "Heads it is. Go it, my boy." "Well," said Hollar, mounting a chair, and fastening the rope. "When you feel the cord shake, follow." "Tie it strongly," said Hans, anxiously.   DREAMS WITHN DREAMS.        199 "All right!" replied Hollar. "Now, god by, old fel- low." "God bless you!" cried Hans, as his companion swung himself lightly out of the window, and disappeared. Hans remained anxiously peering into the darkness, and waiting nervously for his friend's signal. Presently the cord shook. "Thank God!" cried he, relieved of an immense bur- den. "And now for my turn."   The young man naturally hesitated, but the darkness was favorable, since it was impos sible to realize the immense height of the tower. Hans grasped the cord, started as he heard a noise, and looked round. No; it was only the wind. Again the cord shook. He mounted, straddled the ledge of the window, and looked at the rope. Ie pulled it. It seemed strong enough. But, if it should not Hans scratched his head. A third time the cord vibrated. "By Jove " said the young man to himself; "if I stop to think, I never will reach the bottom alive!" So saying, he seized the cod, twined his legs round it, and slid carefully He was received in his companion's arms, who whispered Be very quiet, and follow me, for I have a general idea of the way." "Where is the tower wall?" whispered Hans. "he devil only knows," replied the olher. "It ought to be to the left, but I cannot find it. What a dark night!)!" It was dark indeed. The two young men almost touched each other, without being able to distinguish each other's forms. "Hang it! where's the wall?" whiser ed Hollar, groping. "Perhaps you turned round when sliding down" said Hans. "Try the right." "Oh! here it is," whispered Hollar. "All right, m boy " "It's devilish dark," said Hans. "I never saw so gloomy a night." "Hush!" whispered the other.!"Have you hold of the wall?" "Yes," replied Hans. "A'n't it damp?" "Be still," answered Hollar. "We will be overheard. Co11me on." Thus, groping their way, they followed the wall for about half an hour, when Hollar muttered something to himself. "What is up?" asked Hans, in a whisper.    <pb n="200-201" xml:id="VAC6560-00000109"/> 200      DREAMS WITHN DREAMS., "I had no idea," rejoined his companion, " that the castle was half so large. Why, we must have walked a mile." "You know we are walking in the dark," said Han, " and that should be taken into consideration. Distance is doubled by darkness." "Allowing for ail that," replied Hollar, "we must have advanced a great way." So we must," assented Hans. Let us go on. They then continued for ten minutes more. "By Jove " cried Hans at last, "I don't believe there is any end to this infernal wall. I wonder whether the castle is not enchanted, and keeps stretching out as we advance?" "Nonsense!" ieplied ollar. "I wish the moon would rise." They then continued for about ten minutes. "Now, said Hans, at the end of this period, "I am not going to stand this, you know. If the castle has no end, there is no use trying to find one." "Well, I confess to being puzzled for once," remarked Hol- lar. "I cannot make head or tail of it. Here we havel been following this blessed wall for at least fifty minutes, and 5io not seem any nearer the end than when we began. And yet I can swear we have come to no angle. The wall is as smooth as a girl's cheek. Now, where the deuce are we?" "I really can't say," replied Hans, scratching his head "Can't vou see anything?" "Not an inch before my nose," answered the other. "What shall we do?" "It is quite impossible for me to tell you," said Hans. "Bless your soul! I think we are asleep. That's my opinion." "Let us see what we are treading on," remarked Hollar. "Thlat may guide us a little." "Well?" inquired Hans, as his friend stooped. "It is evidently a road," answered Hollar, "and has been much travelled by horses. What is that?" "What is it?" asked Hans. "A horseshoe," replied Hollar. "Let us cross the road, and see 'what is on the other side." ' Agreed," said Hans, and the two commenced carefully to cross. The road was much wider than they expected, but at last they reached the otier side, where they encountered an- bther w                   aked Han. "We can't have got into the ditch, can we?" asked Hans.   DREAMS WITHN DREAMS.       201 "No," answered Hollar, " unless all the water has disap- peared since sunset. But let us talk the matter over quietly. We are evidently between two parallel walls, one of which we know, and the other we do not know. I think that our safest course would be to keep to the one we do know. What do you say?" "What do I say?" said Hans, scratching his head. "Why, I suppose we may poetically be said to know the other, but I cannot say I know much more about it than I do about this one. However, here's for it." And they both recrossed the road, and followed the first wall. After five minutes more, they agreed to make another crossing, in. doing which Hans stumbled over something, and fell down with a crash. "Are you hurt?" whispered Hollar. "No," whispered Hans. Don't stir, then, till I listen," continued Hollar, in the same low tone. "No," he whispered, after several minutes; "there is no one near. I thought there could not be. What have you fallen over?" "Let's see," whispered Hans. "Here is a pile-of bones, here is a broken chair, and here a heap of ashes. Now, what a mysterious kind of a castle this is I We ought to havt been away half an hour ago, and here we are as near the thing as ever. And now to find bones, of all things!" "What under the sun does the Count mean, by piling rub- bish up in his park?" said Hollar. "Hallo 1" cried Hans. "Hnsh!" said Hollar. "What is it?" "A flight of steps," replied Hans. "Bravo!" whispered his companion. "I think I know where we are now. I saw a flight of steps, as we came, lead- ing up to a terrace, and I am glad to discover any trace on this dark night. There ought to be a door at the top." "Was your flight a winding one?" asked Hans. "No," replied the other. "Very well," said Hans, " then your trace is not worth much, for this is a regular corkscrew." "Indeed?" remarked Hollar. "What a very remarkable place this is! Well. at any rate, the stairs must lead some- where, if only round and round." "Round and round, indeedl" growled Hans.   "The ascent would suit an eel to a T." 9*    <pb n="202-203" xml:id="VAC6560-00000110"/> 202       DREAMS WImTHN DREAMS. "If I did not know we were outdoors," said Hollar, "I should say we were mounting a belfry." "Oh, no 1" answered his companion. "Wherever they lead, these steps are not in a tower. I should say that they led to a terrace. I have seen such before." "Possibly to a conservatory," said Hollar. "So be care- ful." "All right," whispered Hans, as he preceded his compan. ion. "Here is a door." "Will it open?" asked Hollar. "Yes," replied Hans. "Go on, then, but quietly, for your life," said his com- panion. "What a smell!" remarked Hans, as he opened the door gently. "It don't smell like a flower garden. I should rather say we were emerging in the pigsties." "Nonsense!" replied Hollar. "It smells like-now what does it smell like? But never mind. Go on. Easily, now- easily, for your life. How darkit is! Hallo i what is that?" As he said this, a most terrible clamor arose. Cluck! cho- rused a tribe of hens; gobble! replied a squadron of turkeys; hiss screeched a battalion of geese; quack! yelled a congre- gation of ducks: and, amid the clucks, and the gobbles, and the hisses, and the quacks, as the young men stood bewildered, the voice of the Count was heard; trumpets sounded; troops rushed in; lights appeared, and the young men found them- selves-in the hall of Bertrand Castle. "Seize them! hang them! shoot them! cut them down I the pirates! the hen inveiglers! the corsairs!" yelled the Count, appearing in undress, followed by the terrified women. Hallo, you two! You here?   How did you get here? Where did you come from? You, of all men, after my hens I Are you not ashamed of yourselves? Oh, you young miscre- ants! Your fathers and mothers, I dare say, have long since been hurried by your misdeeds into untimely and dishonored graves. And my hens, too!  Oh! where is virtue extant, when noblemen descend to the trade of turkey filchers? Oh! you abominable young rascals " "Charles! Charles!" cried the Countess. "If you will allow me to speak," cried Hollar, "let me assure you that, so far from our desiring acquaintance with these feathered fiends, they have assisted you to recapture us. We were escaping, and how we got here, the devil only knows.   DREAMS WITHN DREAMS.       203 If you will go to our room, you will find the rope by which we escaped. Send and see." Well," said the Count, a little mollified, i believe you  but, you see, my hens are coveted by all the country round, and I am naturally excited on the subject-very naturally. I have them in here every night, and count them myself. So you tried to escape, did you.? Well, I admit you on parole. Uphorn may give me what orders he pleases, but I am not going to have my hens disturbed for all the dukes in Christen. dom-ay, or out of it either." "You should have allowed it from the first," said Hollar. We wished, of course, to reach Treviot, but we would never have thought of quitting you so suddenly without saying fare. well, had you left it to our honor." "Treviot!" replied the Count. "Humph! You would hardly have enjoyed yourself much in Treviot. It is already taken." "Taken!" cried Hollar and Hans both together. The Countess whispered to her husband, who nodded, and took a letter out of his pocket. "Here!" he cried, tossing it to Hollar. "Read that. And now, let us go to bed." "Before you do," said Hans, "pray expound to me the mystery of our adventure to-niglt; for I am curious to under. stand how we got here." As the reader may wish to know also, we will now ex- plain. It seems that, under the young men's window, at the base of the tower, a hole had been constructed to light up a circular apartment in the cellar, used formerly as a riding school. The rope had been let down until it reached terra firrna; which said terra. firma was the cellar floor, the rope descending through the hole. Hence, Hans and Hollar slid down right through the opening, which they did not distinguish in the darkness-to say nothing of their excitement-and alighted safely in the cellar; where for nearly an hour they followed each other round and round the apartment. The hole being wide, they had missed the rope when they passed under the opening, as the rope hung six feet from the wall; the room itself extending beyondthe base of the tower, which was here upheld by two strong pillars, and an inverted arch; room being left between the wall and pillars for the horses to pass. The young men had sometimes crossed the room, and re-    <pb n="204-205" xml:id="VAC6560-00000111"/> 204       DREAMS WITHN DREAMS. crossed it, and at last crawled up the staircase in the centre, and entered the hall, where they stumbled over the poultry; which, as we said in another chapter, were driven every night into the castle. We must now go back, and relate the fortunes of the little child we left at the inn. Early on the morning when these events took place, the old Professor, according to promise, came to the inn of Ernest Toservem to conduct the child to her new home. He walked with so elastic a step, that his acquaintances hardly knew him; for the Professor was rich now, having come into the posses- sion of a thousand francs per annum, payable quarterly; so he walked sturdily and with the faintest show of bluster, as is meet for rich men to do. His mind plotted mighty things, as was the wont of Croesus, Attalos Philadelphos, and others of his rich brethren. Vast prospects of charity and munificent donations to worthy institutions flashed grandly before his mind. He must not be haughty now. No, no. Pride is sin ful and unphilosophical. It would be hard, of course. One thousand francs per annum, payable quarterly, is not to be sneezed at, let me tell yo u. It is not everybody whose income amounts to one thousand francs per annum, payable quarterly. Think of that. And the old Professor actually laughed, as he murmured, dulcetly, "One thousand francs! Dear me! And his village friends noticed the change. Solomon, who met him, turned round to stare, and then walked off whistling. Peter Cutter bade him civilly "good morning" from the open window of his shop, and watched him with open eyes, while he (Peter) held a customer by the nose preparatory to shaving the same; whereat the said customer growling, he was re- minded that he was not doing his duty. Jonathan Sewell, who was sitting cross-legged by his open door, called his better half to witness the phenomenon, and was reprimanded for the same by that virtuous lady, who was wroth at being taken from the washtub "only to look at that old creeter." Samson Shuttle cried out to him, "Hallo, Professor! how spruce you be." In fine, everybody was astonished at the gayety evinced in the step, eye, smile, and general manner of the old man. But he marched stoutly on, and did not mind them a straw. When he reached the inn, Smaragdus was lolling out of the window, smoking and spitting-he actually, indeed, uninten- tionally planted a shot right in the centre of the Professor's hat,-and, seeing the old nman, gave a g tunt; whereat the   DREAMSI WITHN DREAMS.       205 wretched little man poked his head out of another window, and shri'ly asked what was to pay? Without answering, the Pro- fessor went straight up to the porch step, where the child had been deposited, like a bag of meal, by Dame Toservem, at early dawn: that good lady considering the thing as a liberty taken with her house by Lord Godfroy. As the old man stooped to kiss the child, that excellent woman, who had been lying in ambush for him, thrust her head and shoulders (which were comely, albeit skinny) out of the window, and bade the Professor "take that brat away;" adding, moreover, that she was not going to have any fellow's natural children in her house, for all the addle-headed, red-haired, pipe-smoking, beer- swilling professors in the world: thereby, with the usual accu- racy of her amiable sex when wroth, charging the Professor, much to his discomfort, with being the depraved father of the little girl. "My eye!" screamed the wretched little man from the second-story window. "I thought better of you, you old vil- lain!" The Professor blushed scarlet, and looked up, horrified at the insinuation. Smaragdus was looking down, and grinning horrible a ghastly smile. "A'n't you ashamed of yourself!  continued Ebenezer, with jocose indignation. "You old fel- I i lows are always the worst. IToo! hoo! hoo!" This last interjection, which we have vainly sought in the dictionary, was uttered in a treble key, and in a tone anything but respectful. "Really, sir-" began the poor Professor. "Hoo! hoo! hoo!' screamed the wretched little man, poking his nose rapidly now out of his own window, now out of that of Smaragdus, when his little bullet head would appear like a moon, eccentrically revolving round that gentleman's gigantic cocoanut, which grinned broadly at the unfortunate victim. "Hoo! you old debauchee!  Running after the women at your time of life! Hoo! hoo I Get away with you!" Seeing the impossibility of offering any vindication, the old man caught the child up in his arms, and ran off, pursued by the whistles and derisive screeches of the wretched little man. In this undignified way he passed the village at a smart trot; nor did he recover breath enough to enter into conversation with his charge, until quite a little while afterward. When he regained presence of mind (so to speak), he continued to walk    <pb n="206-207" xml:id="VAC6560-00000112"/> more slowly, although that even was pretty brisk. He had been blullhing like a young girl, and the color still flushed his face. He bore his little charge in his arlms, and it seemed to him that iie could not bear her too gently. Quick to know a fiiend, the child put her little arms round his neck, and leaned her head against his shoulder. Clumsy and ungainly as was the old man, no mother ever bore her child more lovingly than the Professor carried this motherless little girl. "And what is your name, darling?" he asked, caressingly. "Gertrude," replied the child. "Whly do you cry?" "Because," he answered, "I once had a little girl like you, with your name." ' Where is she?" asked Gertrude. "In heaven," replied the old man. "She would have been a beautiful woman now, if she had lived, as you will be, please God, one day. But she went away to heaven, and is now a beautiful angel, as you will be, if you are good." ' And will I live with you now, or go to heaven?" asked Gertrude. "You will live near me," replied the old man; "next door, in a dear little cottage, with Dame Chervin; and by-and- by, if you are good, you will go to heaven, and live with Our Lady, and the bright angels." "I know Our Lady," said Gertrude. "Nurse taught me the Ave and the Salve Regina. How I love the Mother of God!" "That is right," answered the old man. "And you must behave like a good girl, and feed the turkeys, and chickens, and ducks, and do all Dame Clervin bids you. And you can play with me, if you want to, at night, I dare say." "Will there be turkeys where I am going to live?" asked Gertrude, her face lighting up with pleasure, as she leaned for- ward to look into the old man's face. He kissed her, and replied, "Yes; plenty of 'em." The child actually screamed with delight. "And when I go to heaven, can I take the turkeys with me?" she asked. "I hope there won't be any gobblers in heaven; they frighten me so." "No," replied the old man; "there will be nothing to frighten you there. But tell me, Gertrude, where did you live last?" The child turned pale. "I lived with nurse," she said. Were you afraid of her?" asked the old man.   UtJlAiMs WITHN DREAMS.      207 "That I was," replied the child. "Last night she lay in a terrible state. She laughed and sang. Then the gentleman who brought me, came In, and she spoke to him, and then fell back. And the gentleman took me away, and said I should never be sent back; and I am so glad! And there are the turkeys! Are these mine?" "All of them, if I have to buy them myself," said the old man, as he opened a gate, and turned up toward a neat little cottage. "And here we are, and there is my house next door, and here is Dame Chervin to welcome us, I am sure." What a kind old woman! what a beautiful house! what stupendous turkeys! Then there was breakfast, with Dame Chervin, all smiles, at the head of the table, and the old man, all complacency (although not without dignity, for he remem- bered the thousand francs per annum, payable quarterly), at the foot, and Gertrude, decidedly autocratess (to coin a word), all chat between them. And if that child was not sick after that breakfast, it was not owing to any prudence on the part either of the dame or the Professor. And then the turkeys had to be fed, and there had to be long consultations between the two old people. And Gertrude did just as she pleased with both. And, when evening was come, there was the Professor again at the foot of the table, stuffing Gertrude with good things, until Dame Chervin had to interfere. And, after sup. per, out he was on the porch, watching the child until she went to bed. And if ever a fervent prayer ascended to the throne of God, such was the supplication of the old man when he knelt down in his bare room before he went to sleep, and poured out his gentle heart to the Father of the fatherless. Was it fancy? Was it not? His wife and little child seemed hovering over him as he prayed; and he heaid, or thought he heard, a distant sound like the vesper hymn when it floats on the Alpine breeze, and dies away in the distance. But before he retired, he had already paid a visit to the castle, where Godfroy of Rochateau had arrived. Godfroy, hearing some one desired to speak to him, excused himself to the company, and entered the room where the old man awaited him. "Hallo!" said Godfroy, a little surprised. "What now, friend? You call late." "I trust I am not disturbing your lordship?" replied the other.    <pb n="208-209" xml:id="VAC6560-00000113"/> 208      DREAMS WITIN DREAMS. "Not at all," answered Godfroy, leaning his gigantic form against the door. "Take your time. What is the matter?" Nothing is the matter, my lord," replied the other. "Only, as your lordship is difficult to find, H- "You thought," said Godfroy, seeing he hesitated, "that you would strike while the iron was hot. That was right. Well, here I am." "I have come into quite a little property," said the old man, with a little pride, perhaps, in his tone; "one thousand francs, my lord, per annum, payable quarterly." "I congratulate you," replied Godfioy. "I trust we are not going to lose you." Oh, no!" answered the other. "Here, please God, will I live, here will I die, and here will I be buried. But I have something on my mind. What is to become of that little girl? Have you thought of that, my lord?" "Why, old friend," said Godfroy, "you are in a strange humor to-night. Was I ever known to desert a person in need? You have more to say, surely?" "I have," mildly replied the old man. "That your lord- ship means well, I never doubted. But what enterprise is even now engaging your mind? One of peril and hidden dan- gers And, amid the clamor of battle, and the dreams of am- bition, may you not forget the little lamb now nestling so hap- pily in your fold? Have you thought of this, my lord? You1 great men are rewarded by the reverence of a nation, the grati- tude of posterity, monuments emblazoning your deeds, and those countless treasures with which fame bewitches her vota- ries. You cannot expect, amid all this, to remember the fate of a little child; and yet her soul is far more precious than a storied urn, or all the idle pomp of posthumous paise." "And what do you propose?" asked Godfror, gently. "To take charge of her myself," replied the other. "I have sufficient, now, for both. Will you give her to me?" "But are you sure, friend," asked Godfroy, " that you are as able as you are willing?" "Surely am I old and ungainly," replied the other, sadly. "The smile of love meets me no longer at my threshold, and my solitary way has had but few gleams of sunshine. Ask me not, my lord, if I am able, for I know not. I love the child- that is all I can say. But ask yourself' if she has a better prospect, and if my offer, by securing to her a competency, however small, is not better than her present destitution? Re-   DREAMS WITHEI DREAS.        209 member, my lord, that war has its chances. Courage cannot defy death; and he who lies with his feet to the foe, slumbers not less eternally than the coward who dies in his bed, or the caitiff who expires on the gallows. Noble gentleman I would it not console you, if God willed you should perish on the field of glory, to know the orphan was safe, even in my poor home?" Good Godfroy's eyes were dimmed. "Old man," said he, wringing his hand, "if she was my own child, I could wish her no better protector." And so they parted. And now nearly all the company at present in the castle were assembled in the room of state, and already there was a talk of sending up for the prisoners, when Clovis entered, and whispered something in his father's ear. Whereupon the Count quietly bade his wife and Nora retire. "No matter why, my dear," he added, hurriedly, and in a manner very different from his usual headlong way. "Do what I tell you." The ladies retired, and the Count approached Godfroy,-who was narrating some merry adventure in a loud, jolly voice. Laying his hand upon that gentleman's shoulder, the Count said, "For goodness' sake, hush! Uphorn is coming." The effect of these words was electrical. Godfroy sat mo- tionless. Sir Wolfgang sprang up, and arranged his dress. My lord Clodolplus forgot a quotation he was about to make. Piquemont's face flushed, and his eyes shone with excitement. Almost while the Count was speaking, the clatter of horses was heard below, and the master of the castle hurried down to receive his guest. CHAPTER XVIII. BEING A CONTINUATION OF THE PRECEDING CHAPTER, AND SHOW- ING HOW THE COMPANY DISPERSED. A DEAD silence reigned until the Count returned with the Duke, when they all, except Piquemont, respectfully rose to their feet. We have said Godfroy was a giant, but he seemed a dwarf alongside of the tremendous being who now entered    <pb n="210-211" xml:id="VAC6560-00000114"/> the room. Louis, Duke of Uphorn, was full six feet six inches in height, and broad, in proportion. He wore a full beard, trimmed in the fashion of the time, and his long hair curled in massive ringlets over a rich lace collar which hung almost to his shoulders. A crimson sash came over the right shoulder of his steel corslet, and was tied at his left hip. His legs were covered with loose garments, somewhat resembling mod- ern trousers, but reaching only a little below the knee. Boots, very wide at the top, completed his dress, the whole of which, we hardly need add, was of the richest materials. His heavy sword and golden spurs rattled as he walked. As was the fashion of the day, he carried a cane. His boots were splashed with mud, bespeaking hard riding. Such was the personage, whose very coining caused so much emotion. Uphorn threw a rapid glance round the room as he entered, and coldly but courteously returned the respectful salutations of the company. His eye rested a second with haughty surprise on Piquemont, as if he were unused to being received by any one in a sitting posture; but he said nothing, merely bowing to the Count as he took the chair offered him, placed his cane on the table, and looked round at every one again, drawing his riding gloves off slowly the while.  ! Some men have a fascination in their manner, a calm strength of mind, apparently created to command, which few can resist. When to this is added immense wealth, high rank, renown in arms, and accidental superiority (as in the case of a commander-in-chief), this fascination is almost irresistible. The eye of each person involuntarily sought the ground, as that momentary but searching glance fell upon him. A deep silence ensued, which Uphorn broke, as he addressed Clovis in a dry, dictatorial, and unquestionably haughty tone. "I think," he said, "you have a friend, young man, in the royal army. Treviot is taken, the king's army has capitulated, and your friend is a prisoner. Contrary tojny wish, the coun- cil of war is opposed to retaliation, and your friend's life is safe. It will go hard with me, now I am really at the head of affairs, however, if I do not teach Alfred to war a little more like a civilized monarch for the future." Then, coldly turning his face away, as if he forgot Clovis' existence, Uphorn addressed the Count: "I see," he said, "you have been faithful to your word. Another party of soldiers will arrive to-night to garrison the castle. You will command them, of course. How comes it I   have not been informed you have four prisoners here? This is not war, my lord of Bertrand." "A messenger was sent-" began the Count. "Yes," said Uphorn " four hours after you received them. Let this not occur again. Let the young men be kept in strict confinement until they are won over. You have a son of the Marquis of Hollar. Give him that letter from his father, who has joined our standard. And now for your instructions. Shoot down any one who is in arms, and refuses to obey you, unless he has orders from myself. Keep the place against who. ever attacks it, and count on me for relieving you." "You may take your oath of that, your grace," replied the Count. "I will obey you in everything but an order to sur- render. That, you know, was the sole condition I made." "We understand each other," said the Duke, frowning to repress a smile. "I ask your pardon for having been so for- getful as to think a reminder necessary." "My hens-" began the Count, plucking up a little spirit, when the Duke interrupted him very unceremoniously. "You must not trifle," said he. "You understand your instructions, and that is enough." And he turned away from the Count as coldly as he had done from Clovis. "Sir Wolfgang," he continued, fixing his eyes calmly upon the knight, " how comes it you are not at your post? Oh! I remember-you were to wait me here. Go, report yourself at headquarters, where you will await my coming." Sir Wolfgang bowed, and departed. Uphorn turned then to my lord Clodolphus somewhat more cordially. "Your lord- ship," said he, "has indeed proved a friend in need. Let me thank you for the assistance you have rendered the cause. Without it, the whole enterprise must have failed." Verily I thought so," quoth my lord Clodolphus, with a chuckle, "and verily I said so." h"When does your lordship purpose joining?" asked Up- horn. "No time," replied my lord Clodolphus, sententiously, "is like the present." "Bravelv resolved," said Uphorn. I will wait for you." Thereat did my lord Clodolplus depart to make his prepa- rations. "Can I offer your grace anything before you leave?" in- quired the Count.    <pb n="212-213" xml:id="VAC6560-00000115"/> 212      DREAMS WITHN DREAMS. The Duke smiled. "I have no time to waste," he said; "but my soldiers are very tired, and a flask of wine, or so, will do them good. I, too, would not be the worse for a cup of your celebrated Burgundy. Thank you for your thoughtful. ness." Hereupon the Count bustled off, very glad to get out of the room; for, like most warmhearted men, he felt uncomfort- able in company with a cold, distant, reserved person. Mean- while, the Duke addressed Godfroy: "We missed," .he said, "your strong arm sadly in our attack." "Indeed, your grace!" replied Godfroy, with a forlorn attempt to say something natural. "You should have seen me, if I had known it." "Obedience," answered Uphorn, coldly, "is the soldier's first duty. It was well for you that you did not make that attempt; it would have cost you your rank. But, if hard blows are to your liking, you shall have enough of them. You must take Viot within two days from now." "The time is short," remonstrated Godfroy. "Then take it in one," was the reply. Godfroy gave a comic look aside at Clovis, who burst out laughing. Uphorn seemed petrified at this indecorous conduct. "Excuse me," said Clovis, reddening, " but-" "But what, sir?" asked Uphorn, sternly. "It was my fault, your grace," said Godfroy. "Clovis is unused to your up-and-down way of ordering; and I was wrong enough to set him going." Uphorn looked kindly at the two handsome young men. "The sin was not very great," he said. "Perhaps you two would like to strike a blow together?" "Indeed, I would!" cried Clovis. Take care of him, Godfroy," said the Duke; and then, as if afraid he had been too familiar, he drew out writing mate- rials, and began to write; taking no notice whatever of Pique- mont, who sat quietly in the corner, evidently very much hurt by the treatment. Seeing this, Clovis walked quietly up to the table where his commander-in-chief was writing, biding his time to speak. Uphorn looked up coldly, and with evident displeasure. "I beg your grace's pardon," said Clovis, pointing to Pique- mont, "' but can it be you have forgotten your old friend?" "I do not understand you," replied Uphorn, looking at Clovis.   DREAMS WITHN DREAMS.       213 "The Count of Piquemont," faltered the young man, who feared--he knew not why--that he had made some terrible blunder.                    t "What!" cried the Duke, laying down his pen. "That the Count of Piquemont? You are trifling with me, sir." "That I can say he is not," said Piquemont, quietly. Uphorn rose, crossed the room, and grasped Piquemont's hands. "My friend! my firiend!" he cried. "And is this my old schoolfellow? So altered! so worn! so very changed! My ord  my lord I your wrongs have been revenged by the God of battles." Then, turning to the others, he said, "Let every one leave the room." They obeyed in silence, leaving the two together. "Old friend," then said Uphorn, "to see you thus in your old age, drives me mad. Why did you not come to me? Why not write? Where have you been? Great God I to think that you, of all men, should wander homeless, and I "You forget," answered Piquemont, gently. "I could not leave my child; and she was happiest here." "I do not know that," said Uphorn. "Your child would have been as my own--my own! Oh, my little child! I had but one little lamb, and it was taken from me." And the stern soldier, the haughty noble, strode rapidly up and down. His expression was as cold and proud as ever, nor did a tear dim his sight; but there was a gnawing of the lip, a fire in the eye, which betokened the keen torment within. "Had Heaven," he continued, "summoned her from my arms, I could have laid my little baby in her coffin, and borne my grief with patience and resignation. Had Heaven willed us both to lose rank, fortune, and home, I could have lain down like Job in the dust, and surrendered my all without a sigh. But to be a father, and yet childless; to know she lives, and yet not be able to bless my little one-oh! what shall I do to Thee, Keeper of men? Why hast Thou set me opposite to Thee, and I am become burdensome to myself?  Yet, old friend, all this I might have borne. - Bt the thought of her very infancy perhaps corrupted by evil; the thought of her childhood tainted by vice; the thought of all horrible things probable or possible, haunts me day and night. Pity me, old friend, if your heart is still susceptible to compassion." "Louis," said Piquemont, rising, taking Uphorn's hands, and looking up earnestly in his face, "is your faith a mockery,    <pb n="214-215" xml:id="VAC6560-00000116"/> 214       DREAMS WITHN DREAMS. and your trust a shadow? Do you remember how you replied to your mother, when you had plunged into the river, and saved me from drowning-' Mother, God was in the midst of the waters'? The sky is dark now, and the floods of sorrow flow over you; but God, Louis, is in the midst of the waters." And Piquemont, letting go Uphornl's hands, clasped his neck. The Duke threw both arms around Piuemnont, and thus, with a love surpassing the love of woman, the two clunmg together. A trumpet sounded below. Piqlemont started. The Duke recovered himself, and, when the messenger entered, presented the same haughty, passionless appearance which he bore when we first saw him. Ha! we smell war. Fee, fo, fum! Be they alive, or be they dead, against the foe we'll soon be led. But, alas! I call on Calliope in vain. Momus comes instead, and I must resign myself. Some hlave sung the glories of war; others described its sorrows; to me is reserved the deplorable task of laughing. Verily, I try the heroic strain-it falls into a jingle. Nor am I even allowed to strike out into the current of originality. How can I, and be natural? How can I describe men, and not plagiarize? Come, reader, to Rochateau. Fancy a camp, with all the magnificently stern array of battle, and all that sort of a thing, you know. Let us approach one of the fires, and see the hero of the coming struggle. He was a gentleman of eccentric manners, and seemed to have a very vague idea of what defensive armor was meant for; since he wore that part of his headpiece in front, which vulgar and ordinary-minded people would have placed on the back of their heads; and his leggings were likewise reversed, probably for the same reason which induced the notorious gel- tleman from Cork to button his coat behind. He had a car- bine, of which he seermed excessively afraid, and which he generally managed to get between his own legs, or those of his friends, to stumble over, and to perform divers other origi- nal evolutions not to be found in works on military tactics. His name was Leander; his good mother having so called him, partly in honor of the saint. and partly in memory of a certain Greek notorious for swimming, whose adventures with Hero she had heard related by the priest of the parish. Her son did not take much after either of his patrons, being neither remark- able for romance nor sanctity.   DREAMS WITrIN DREAMS.       215 "But why," said this hero, addressing one of his compan. ions, "why does not the king stop all this fighting? Have not I been up these three mortal nights, just as if I could do any good? What is the use of my walking up and down with a matchlock for two hours at a stretch, and told to shoot people if they try to pass? Why do the officers tell me to shoot people? How would they like to be shot themselves? And then I am told that, if I sleep, I am to be shot. Why am I to be shot, if I sleep? How would the officers like to be told, that if they went to sleep, they would be shot? What is it all about?" "Why, it is. all for glory," replied Samson Shuttle, the weaver, who had just come up, and now stood warming his hands at the fire. "' Glory!" exclaimed Leander. "Where is there any glory in marching round and shooting people? I cannot see what all this fuss is about. I want to go home." "Ah, but you can't go home," said one of the men, with a grin. "Why can't I go home?" continued Leander. '"Why must I stay here perpetually? Why can't we fight, without killing people? That's what I want to know.  Why can't we? There was Peter Mullin and Matthew Jaques-they fought for a good half hour before Toservem's tavern. They never thought of killing each other. We would not have let them. Then why can't we fight like Peter Mullin and Matthew Jaques?" "The devil's in the man, I believe," growled an old weather-beaten pikeman who was sitting near. "I think the wine he drank has knocked out the little sense he ever had. What are you talking about? Fighting, and no killing! I warrant you, you will have both before long-ay, and perhaps learn the ' why' to your cost." "That is all very well," replied Leander, "and I under- stand all that; but, why-" "Go to the devil with your 'whys!' " cried the pikeman, fiercely. "Do you suppose we want any of your infernal non- sense here?" Leander shrank back. The pikeman muttered a curse, and looked scowling round. "If I read the signs right, we will have work soon, and in that direction," he continued, pointing toward Viot. "I remember defending it once, and, just as the enemy succeeded in storming the town, I was commissioned to blow up the works. Bah! the train was out of order, and off    <pb n="216-217" xml:id="VAC6560-00000117"/> 216      DREAMS WITH  DREAMS. it went at once. I was thrown back insensible, and how I escaped, the devil only knows; for the explosion was the death of hundreds, to say nothing of the wounded. If we attack Viot, we are sure to have this over again, for I know mines have been constructed under the battlements." So saying, the pikeman surlily walked off. "Warm work, a'nt it, Leander?" inquired Shuttle. "Dear! dear " cried that hero, taking courage in the pike- man's absence. "And to think that we are going up in the air like an arrow! I wish I had never come." "You will be buried honorable," suggested one of his fel- low soldiers. "But I don't want to be buried honorable," replied Lean- der. "I had rather live. Then why may I not live?" "How did you happen to come at all?" asked Shuttle. Said Leander: "I will tell you. I was at home making stockings (for such is my trade), when the steward came to me. 'You are to go to war,' said he. 'Am I?' said I. 'You come to the castle at dawn to-morrow,' said he. 'Will the war be there?' said I. But he told h'le to mind my busi- ness, and went off. So, just to see the sport, I was up to the time. 'You are prompt,' said Lord Godfroy. ' Oh 1 your honor will always find me ready when any fun is going on,' said I. With that he praised my spirit, as he called it, and, of course, I took it all in trust; for I little knew, I can tell you, all the things they were going to do with me. "Why, what did they do?" asked Shuttle. "Do!" exclaimed Leander. "All sorts of awful things. First, they put me in a row of men, and gave me a suit of clothes, a sword, and a matchlock. 'Thank you,' says I. 'Hold your tongue!' cries the man they called a surgeon- though why, I don't know. 'Hold your tongue! Eyes to the right!' Wondering what he was talking about, I stretched my neck to see what on earth there was to, be seen on the right. 'Keep that cocoanut of yours in,' cried the surgeon, fiercely, 'or I'll knock a hole in it!' I pulled up straight as I could, I believe you. 'Now turn your eyes to the right,' says the surgeon. 'Don't squint. So!' Well, I learned what they called drill. ' Can't I take this kettle off my head?' says I to the surgeon. At which he swore at me not a little. And then, dear dear I when I first fired a matchlock off, what a time there was! I just tumbled right over. Then my com- panions would have it I trod on their toes, and brought my   DREAMS WITHN DREAMS.        217 carbine on them.  What if I did?  It wasn't my fault. 'Bring your carbine to the hip!' says the surgeon. 'There I' says I. 'Oh, lord!' groaned a fellow behind; 'you have knocked all the wind out of me.' ' Then get out of the way,' says I; for I had brought the butt end in contact with his stomach. 'Silence!' roars the surgeon. 'There ' says I; 'don't you hear the offieer yelling at you? 'I mean you,' says the surgeon. ' You keep quiet in the ranks, will you?' So it was. What with the pot on my head, and these two frying pans on my breast and back, and with the carbine and drill, I was nearly beside myself half the time. And then I had to walk up and down for two mortal hours at a stretch, when a decent man should be in bed and asleep. 'Do you know your instructions?' asked the officer-not the surgeon, but the other fellow who goes round with him. ' Yes,' says I; 'but I don't understand a word of them.' 'Who put that man here?' says the officer to the surgeon. 'It's all right, my lord,' says the surgeon to the officer. 'He is an original, and always wants a reason, and that is what he means by under- standing orders.' 'Well,' says I, 'and that is true enough. Just explain them, there's a good soul.' ' Be still!' cries the surgeon. 'Don't you know this is my lord Rapandhammer?' 'What a queer name!' says I. 'Silence!' cries he. ' You have told me that often enough, goodness knows,' says I. 'I suppose you want all the talk to yourself.' The surgeon shrugged his shoulders. 'I can do nothing with him, my lord,' says he. 'Well,' says Rapandhammer, laughing, 'what are you to do?' 'Stay here for two mortal hours,' says I; 'and I wish they were over.'  'Never mind remarks,' says he. What is the watchword?'  Rochateau,' says I; ' and big fools they were for choosing it.' 'Why I how dare you criti- cize the conduct of your superiors?' says Rapandhammer. 'I leave it to yourself' says I. 'Suppose a man comes. "Where are you a-going to?"I asks. Why, what could he answer, on this road, but Rochateau?' 'But you must not go that way to work,' says Rapandhammer. ' You must only ask for the word.' 'Well, I know all that as well as yourself' says I, 'and maybe better, for all your feathers. Now don't bother me any more. * You have screwed out of me all I know.' With that they laughed, and left me. By-and-by, Uphorn comes along. 'Stand, friend!' says I, 'till I load my gun, and shoot you'-for I had forgotten to put any powder in the thing. Uphorn gave the word, but looked awful. 'So you 10    <pb n="218-219" xml:id="VAC6560-00000118"/> 218      DREAMS WITHN DREAMS. forgot to load?' says he. ' And no wonder,' says I, ' seeing they bother me so, I don't know which end of the matchlock is the safe one to be at.' 'And this is the way you do your duty, sir?' says he, and off he goes. 'A good riddance to bad rubbish,' thinks I to myself. 'For all the grand way lIe has, hle is as bad as the rest.' But he was better than 1 thought; for he gave a kind word for me to the surgeon--who was mighty mad, I believe you-and I was never asked to walk at night again." As Leander finished, Godfroy and Clovis rode up. Rappen- hammer, Sir Christopher Weezy, Sir Peter de Steele, and the other officers, were summoned to council. Godfroy stated his intentions shortly, which was to surprise Viot; since Sir Bene- dict de Balde (its governor), expecting the speedy arrival of the king, little supposed Uphorn meditated any attack. "The walls," said Godfroy,- " are negligently guarded, and a surprise would give us great advantage. What says your scout, Claude?" "Here he is, my lord," said Hartrettet. "Let him speak for himself." "The citizens of Viot," said the man, in reply to an in- quiring look from Godfroy, " need only to be attacked to run away bravely. The garrison you can overcome. Your great danger is the mines." "May I speak, your lordship?" asked Claude, eagerly. "Certainly," replied Godfroy. "If your lordship will leave that to me, I can guarantee you from fear on that score," said Claude. i"How so?" asked Rappenhammer. Claude laughed softly. "The ditch," lhe said, " is not only empty, but has flooded the mines themselves.' "The devil. it has!" cried Weezy. "I was not to say anything until to-night," said Claude, "but my men have been at work under orders to turn the river's channel from the ditch, which has a natural drain, and becomes empty if not constantly supplied by the stream. A friend of mine, who lives in Viot, thinking, no doubt, it was hardly fair to take all the water away from the town, has con- siderately bored a hole. and flooded the mines and magazines." "But they must find that out immediately," suggested Rappenhammer. "Finding it out won't dry the powder," replied Claude, with another noiseless laugh. "What bunglers the engineers   DREAMS WITHN  DREAMS.       219 must have been, to go and put powder below the water's level." "And when," inquired Godfroy, " was all this effected?" "About dark,en replied Claude.  "The ditch (I mean ours) turned the water off about the same time that my Viot friend was to pull the plug out." "By whose orders was this done?" asked Godfroy. "The Duke's," replied Claude. "Uphorn has a head on his shoulders," said Godfroy. "I wonder why he never confided this to me?" "If I may take the liberty of giving an opinion," re- marked Claude, "I think he is always trying his officers." "A shrewd guess, even if wrong," replied Godfroy. "But come, we have no time to lose. To horse, gentlemen!" With that they all rose, and went out. Confusion yet order, bustle yet discipline, now reigned. Captains flew in every direction. Pikemen, musketeers, infantry, all hastened to their respective quarters, and fell into rank. Leander was in everybody's way, and was hustled and anathematized accord- ingly. Everything being ready, the storming ladders were hoisted on their bearers' shoulders. Leander miraculously fell into his proper place, the word was given, and the little army started silently. "You are in for it now, Leander," said one of his compan- ions. "Can't you keep step, you idiot? Keep step, I tell 'you, or I will drop the butt of my carbine on your toes." "I say, Leander," said one behind, poking the head of that hero with the muzzle of his carbine. "Stop!" cried Leander. "I say," said the other, grinning, "you are to be the first who mounts the ladders." "What! them things?" asked Leander. "Yes," replied the other. "Why, I wouldn't go up them   things," said Leander, ap- palled, " not if you was to pay me a million pounds." "Silence!" cried the sergeant. "O1 O!  you may well be screeching  ' silence,"'" replied Leander; " but these fellows are poking and punching me till I am sore." "Then why don't you shoot them?"   remarked the ser- geant, sarcastically. "So I  will, if you order me," said Leander, lowering his carbine. "Who shall I begin with?"    <pb n="220-221" xml:id="VAC6560-00000119"/> "; You had better begin with me, old goat," suggested the one behind. "Keep still, both of you!" cried the sergeant, fiercely. "You, Baytel, ought to know better." {'Better!" screamed Leander. "I have been straddling the barrel of that man's matchlock for I don't know lhow long. He will hold it between my legs." i If that noise is not stopped," cried Sir Christopher, riding up, and drawing his pistol, "I will blow out the born devil's brains who makes it. Who is the mall?" "That one,' replied the sergeant, pointing to Leander. "'Ta'n't me!" screamned Leander. Sir Clinstopher, the best shot in the country, took aim, fired, and his ball, as was intended, glanced from the top of Leander's headpiece. "Oh, lord!" cried the poor fellow, tumbling down; "I am a dead manll.:  "No, you are not," said one of his companions. "Get up "i "It was well for you the bullet missed," said Sir Christo- pher, as Leander rose trembling. "It does not happen to me very often, I can tell you." Leander, after this, marched silently enough. On, on, tramp, tramp, on to the work of death went the gallant little army. The mud grew thicker and thicker. Le- ander first lost one shoe, and then lhe lost the-othier, much to the indignation of those who had to pick them up; for all now were nearly wild with excitement- But, bless nly soul! I really am hurrying as fast as I can into the heroics. That will never do. Let us suppose the march, alld-all that kind of tiling. The besiegers reach Viot; the signal is given; the men with the ladders rush forward; the infantry follow at filll run; the musketeers spread to the right and left, their carbines fitted to their bandoleers, or what- ever you call them, ready to pick out whatever poor fellow should be unfortunate enough to poke his nose over the battle- ments. Let us suppose all this, I say; and, if our fancies are not strong enough, let us look up'Froissart, where there will be enough such scenes to choose from. Of course, Clovis was wounded; not mortally, you may be sure, but just enough for glory--let us say inll the arm, a little above the elbow. As for Claude, he did wonders. Leading his men, he leaped into the ditch (dry now), and crept, under   DREAMS WITHN DREAMS,         221 shelter of the darkness, along the walls, until he reached a turret door, conveniently left open for him by his friend in Viot. Claude's troop, as they imitated their leader, and crept on all fours after him, certainly did not present a martial ap- pealrance, but looked a great -deal like a flock of bears, as they crawled along on their hands and knees.  However, they reached the door, and nmounted to the walls unperceived by the sentinel, a big, fat man, with no end of belly, who was sleepily watching the fight as if it was no business of his,'and the more he let it alone the better. This gentleman was soon settled Claude seizing him by both ankles, and tipping him quietly over into the ditch, where his life was saved partly by the soft mud, and partly by Leander's admirable presence of mind. That military hero had crawled after the rest of Claude's men, although (of course) lie should have been elsewhere. Seeing at once, with a clearness we cannot all boast, the advan- tage of keeping out of harm's way, he reasoned that the ditch was about the safest place round. So, as we said, he crawled after Claude's men, and got llis mouth full of mud from the heels of the gentleman who preceded him, before he had ad- vanced fifty yards. When Claude tipped the sentinel into the ditch, Leander was immediately below  him, and consequently the sentinel fell very close to our friend's head, who (i. e., Leander) set up an appalling howl, supposing this the first- fruits of the coming explosion. Recovering himself, .he took courage, and proceeded to the spoil; pulling the sentry's body out of the mud, and fumbling in his pockets while he lay stunned.  The other, however, recovering consciousness, gave Leander a kick in the stomnach, whereat he ran away, and the sentinel likewise; the one in one direction, and the other in another. The sentinel finally escaped safely, but Leander's bad fortune led him into the thickest of the battle; for Sir Benedict de Balde, Governor of Viot, had made a sally.  Le- ander came  thundering along, and ran right between the two hostile ranks.  One of De Balde's men made a thrust at him with a  pike, just as one of Godfroy's soldiers, who did not know   him, cut at him with a sword. Luckily, the sword met the pike, and severed the head from the handle, and so saved Leander's life. The man with the pike, being enraged, then g'Eve the poor fellow a most tremendous thwack over the head 'with the but end. His headpiece saved his head, but the force of the blow sent him headforemost into his own ranks, where his weight and impetus knocked two  men over. He was ac.    <pb n="222-223" xml:id="VAC6560-00000120"/> cordingly about to be pretty roughly handled. when Sir Bene- dict himself made another terrible but vain charge. Leander received a tremendous thwack on the stern from Sir Benedict's sword, which, happily, struck flat, or it would have cut him in two. As it was, it sent him flying into the town. where he was nearly shot four times; but, favored by fortune at last, he stumbled accidentally down an area, where he thought it wise to remain. The appearance of Claude on the walls settled ilie fortunes of the day. Sir Benedict was left almost alone, dealing blows like a madman, and killing or wounding with every stroke. A rush was made on him finally, and he was overpowered by numbers. They found him, the next day, lying on his back, still clutching his broken sword in his stiffened hand. CHAPTER XIX. CONCERNING TH&amp;E OLD PROFESSOR AND LITTLE GERTRUDE, THE evening after the Professor paid Godfroy a visit at the castle, he was seated by the fire, apparently waiting for some- body. The fire leaped and hissed as if it were merrily engaged in some wild dance, and the smoke rushed upward like a stream determined to defy the laws of gravitation. Still the old man sat looking intently )upon the blaze, his thoughts wandering, God knows whither, without remarking its cheerful, companion- like beauty, as if he had long bid adieu to even the wish of earthly comfort. He was at length aroused from his reverie by a knock; at which he started, rose, opened the door, and ad- mitted the visitor. The stranger was a short, powerful, thickset young man, about twenty years old, blessed with a pug nose and bushy hair. His clothes lboked as if they were never taken off, and his boots were innocent of blacking. A devil-may-care expres- sion, rather attractive, sat enthroned on his lineaments; and, altogether, you would say, judging from his appearance, that he was that kind of a person whose career in life was not likely to be ruined by too much modesty and diffidence; he being just the sort of man to make himself perfectly at home with Poly-   1JtLwA-M WITHN DREAMS.      223 phemus himself, had inexorable fate thrown him unexpectedly into the society of that cannibal. The stranger's first proceeding was characteristic--being no less than to propose that the Professor (a perfect stranger till then) should then and there, and at his own individual expense, treat him (the stranger) to some brandy and water, or, as the youth pleasantly called it, a glass with a stick in it. The Pro- fessor expressing his willingness to taste that beverage, the liquor was produced; and the youth mixed his grog, and stood, smiling benignantly on the older man, with his back to the fire: indeed, in such close proximity did he take his stand, that the roon was immediately made fragrant with the rich flavor of hot cloth. The Professor continuing silent, hs companion proceeded to make himself agreeable; commencing the conversation by opining that the inventor of spirituous liquor (to use an expres- sion he had learned in a recent voyage to the British colony of Virginia) must have been half horse, half alligator with a sprinkling of the earthquake. This being a new view of Bacchus (who, although that god distinguished himself in the siege of Olympus as a lion, has never been represented by art under an equingcrocodilian form), the old man had nothing to venture in reply. Taking silence for assent, the youth pro- ceeded to strengthen his position, by narrating some of his ad- ventures in America, where (he said) men were always either beastly drunk, going to be beastly drunk, or just emerging from a state of beastly intoxication; in which country (he added) the greatest talent of the world was concentrated: from which he naturally argued, that spirituous liquors conduced greatly to the improvement of the human race. To prove this, he con. eluded by relating how an intimate friend of his in that region had bit off a gentleman's nose. At which point the Professor hastily interposed, assuring his visitor that, as he was as yet unprepared for such a high state of civilization, he trusted that he (the youth) would not improve his nature by too frequent visits to the spartkling bowl. Whereat the visitor poetically replied, that, when he dressed, it was his custom to put on his stockings before his boots; thus allegorically conveying the information that he knew how to perform the duties of life properly and decorously. Except when he made the last-reported observation, the Professor had sat hardly hearing a word his companion said but seemed to be weighing the pro and contra of something he    <pb n="224-225" xml:id="VAC6560-00000121"/> was trying to put into a practical form of expression. At length, leaning forward, lie suddenly changed the topic, and said, to the nlo small consternation of his companion: "Do you know, young man, what it-is to die?" The youth hastily answered in the negative. "Do you know what it is to die?" repeated the other. "I do not mean the sundering of soul and body, when the lat- ter goes to decay, and the former flies to the bosom of its God; but that long, lingering, death in life, when the early blossoms of hope have been blasted by the frost of grief, never again to beautify the present with their loveliness, or the future with their promise." Thus forcibly appealed to, the youth replied that these were very horrid ideas, and made him creep all over. Looking at him steadily, the old man continued: ' You are young and thoughtless; I, old and thoughtful. You are happy in hope and carelessness; I, in a better hope, for it is founded on a rock. My carthly joys are over, and nothing remains for me but to do my duty and die." At this the youth fidgoted, and rermarked generally that'lle wished he wouldn't, and that he didn't see why he was sent for to be talked to that way. Hardly noticing the interruption, the old man continued: "The line," said he, "between the material and the spirit. ual, the temporal and the eternal, the finite and the infinite, the living and the dead, is so narrow, that we are often able to penetrate the mystery of the tomb, and commune with the departed. Do you understand me? Do you understand my state?" At this the other replied lie certainly did, and that it was his opinion the sooner the Professor got out of it, the better. Still, hardly hearing him, the other continued: "You know I found Gertrude at Toservem's inn, young, destitute, and friendless. I solemnly believe she is a gift from the other world--else why should death seem to have brought this little creature to my home? Whenever I look in her eyes, I seem to read my sudden end. Whenever I listen to the sound of her voice, I think I hear mny summons. Am I sound in mind, or am I not? Is this foreboding true, or deceptive? Am I awake, or dreaming?" "I am sure I don't know," replied the youth, who hardly knew what to say. "' You ought to know yourself." -"You know," said the Professor, still mindless of his com.   DREAMS WITHN' DREAMS.        25 panion, "I rescued my little darling from neglect, brought her here, and have since adopted her. That child is the only being of all I ever met for many a long year, who seems my own flesh and blood. You know something of her history. It was at your own mother's house she was found. Tell me all. Who is she? Has she any relatives? How did you find her? Where? When?   Was there no letter, paper, parcel, any- thing to identify? In fine, how came she under the care of that woman in whose house Lord Godfroy found her? But, first, your name?" "Jack," replied the other. "Well, Jack," said the Professor, " your father, I believe, was a sailor? "He was," replied Master Jack. "And Gertrude?" pursued the other. "Was found," answered Master Jack, judiciously leaving out punctuation in order to be more intelligible, " was found near our door on a dark night tied up in flannen with no stars to be seen and a green cap with a foo." The Professor, possibly from having heard the story before, understood him, however, and asked: "You know nothing more?" "All I know, is this," replied Master Jack; "father, never having carried a baby before, unbuttoned his shirt, and slipped her down the back-luckily, feet first-and, having stowed her amidships safely, buttoned his shirt round her neck, and walked home with her screaming 'bloody murder' behind-" "' Never mind details," said the other. "How came she under the woman's charge?" "She was a volunteer," answered Master Jack.  "Said she took quite a fancy to baby, and took her. Mother says- but then, mother is always saying something." "And what does she say?" asked the Professor. "She says," replied Mastfer Jack, " sle thinks that woman knew more than she wished to tell, and half suspects it was the mother of the child herself, who dropped it to have it picked up by father, and then get it as a stranger, and so escape shame." "Possibly," remarked the Professor, musing. "Your let- ter prepared me for something like this. Thank you, friend. I am glad you came. Can I do anything for you?  "Well," answered Master Jack, "I don't know exactly 10*    <pb n="226-227" xml:id="VAC6560-00000122"/> 226       DREAM]S WITHN DREAMS. You see, I a'n't given much to wishing, unless it is for grog-" Take some," said the other. "Thankee," replied Master Jack.  "You see, I am a sailor, and likes my allowance. You know," he added, brill- iantly, "when I feels it going gurgle, gurgle down my throat, I snorts considerable, and feels fiisky. Consequently" (he con- cluded, logically), "I likes it." So saying, he helped himself, and, being moved by the ex- hilarating liquid, volunteered a marine song; the purport of which was, that the best way of fulfilling man's destiny, was to pull away like a bully boy; ending the whole, as is the wont of maritime warblers, with an appalling howl. While engaged in a particularly prolonged yell, the door suddenly opened, and Father Wilfrid appeared. The Professor briefly told him of Gertrude, and the consequent object of Mas- ter Jack's visit: whereupon the priest grew very interested, not to say excited, questioning and cross-questioning Master Jack, until the old Professor wondered what was up. "I cannot say," was Father Wilfrid's reply to the Profes- sor's questions. "We should not publish our suspicions with- out good reason, lest we wrong some one." "But you have a good reason, surely,' answered the Pro- fessor. "Am I not interested in this child's welfare?" "So much so," said the priest, mildly, "that whatever is proper for me to communicate, shall be told you at once. You will trust me, 1 am sure." "I will," replied the Professor. "I fear we will gain little by any discovery. Old nursery tales are all very well to read, and a lost child is a good theme for a work of fancy; but it would be superstition to trust in such practically." "And how superstitious?" asked Father Wilfrid. "Superstition is a belief in the absurd,' replied the Profes- sor, dogmatically. "A great many folks call things superstitious, what a'n't," remarked Master Jack. His two companions looked at him inquiringly: whereat the young gentleman attempted to show how sundry charms, and the like, were beneficial, and not absurd: in illustration of which, he related how a friend of his bought a child's caul, and gave it to his wife. Tle wife was upset, one day, in a boat, and all, except herself, sank at once to the bottom. She, on the contrary, was found floating several days afterward, her   DREAMS WITHN DREAMS.        227 feet having caught in some tackle which was attached to a loose spar. It is true (he added), she was dead; but where would she have been, had it not been for the caul; which kept her feet out of water, if it did not her head? This lucid example illustrating the life-preserving qualities of cauls, not convincing either the priest or Professor, a pause ensued; which ended in Master Jack's taking his leave. Now it may be well to say, while we are about it, that Master Jack's mother was sister to the wife of Jonathan Sewell, the tailor; and also, before we dismiss the young gen- tleman, to report a certain conversation held in the private apartment dedicated to the genius of social life in the house of Master Jack's parents. Mr. Jack, the father, was, as we know, a sailor; and Mrs. Jack, a thrifty, bustling woman, with a sharp voice and a kind heart. She was a grim housekeeper, and what some would call fussy; but, as she herself often remarked, she had no notion of folks spooking about idle all day lonig, or lolling round, wearing out the bottoms of her chairs, and certainly she acted up to it. Her house was a small tavern, about three or four miles from the village of Bertrand; whose rooms were scrubbed, and whose stairs were scrubbed, and whose whole appearance bore evidence of eternal washing. Still Mrs. J. was no autocrat; her husband's constitutional privilege of smoking, and leaving little piles of ashes round (much to his wife's disgust), being one limitation to the presid- ing power; while a second offset was Master Jack himself; who had made a private declaration of independence before he laid aside the boyish prcetexta. On the night of Jack's visit, and after his return, the whole family were assembled, including the two Jacks, Mrs. Jack, and Miss Jemima Jack. "Well, Jack," aid Mrs. J., "so you see the chuckle- headed old fellow, dty"ou?" "Nonsense, mother," replied Jack junior. "You mustn't, call him names." "Good gracious!" cried Mrs. J. "What has that man got the matter with his brains? I shouldn't wonder if he had a whole nest of worms in them. What did he do with them clothes I sent him?" Jack junior replied, that " he was blessed if he knowed." "Don't tell me," continued Mrs. J., scratching her head with a knitting needle, and looking at her son, " don't tell me 3    <pb n="228-229" xml:id="VAC6560-00000123"/> 228       DREAMS WITHN DREAMS. that man isn't chuckle-headed. He don't understand a girl no more than I do a wolf. He is as shiftless about her, as you was when you killed that polecat." "Wildcat," said Jack junior. "Well, wildcat, then," replied his mother. "It's all the same, I dare say. Ctildren always know more than thei. parents. You'll be teaching me how to suck eggs next, I sup, pose. But that's neither here nor there. Take your legs off that chair. In my days, chairs was made to set on. What does he want with a girl? He'll be wanting to nuss a baby next." "But it's charity," argued Jack junior; " and a'n't charity immortality?" To this Mrs. J. assented grudgingly: observing that, as for immortality, she had never heard of anybody's being immortal until after he was dead; and then he might as well be mortal as immortal." "But Gertrude," she continued, "will never thrive, grafted on that old withered trunk of a feller. If I had to sweeten my cake with the sugar made out of his sap, I would have to leave cake alone. He's got money now, but he'll put off mak- ing his will, you see; and then we will have Gertrude back-- good gracious, Jack! don't you never comb your hair?" Master Jack, naturally taken aback by this abrupt appeal, hastily assented, and looked a little frightened. Jack senior, who had hitherto sat smoking in placid silence, was heard mut- tering something to the effect that his spouse had better keep her off a point or two, as she was steering wide of the course. To which Mrs. J. replied, by asking her husband if he ex- pected a hard-working woman to sit easy in view of a hooroar's nest? Believing himself called upon to correct the wilfulness of his son and heir, and rather flattered than otherwise by the appeal, Jack senior at once began his pious task: but, having no very definite plan of teaching the young idea how to sh.'ol:, he proceeded on the Socratic method; a way which, in his management, always resulted in bewildering both his hearers and himself. On this occasion he began by asking, if the shark did not follow the pilot fish?-if a light was hung at the bows for nothing?-if the boatswain did not whistle for grog? Here, however; Mrs. J. burst impatiently into the conver- sation. "What's the old creeter after?" she cried. "What's sharks and grog got to do with Jack's hair? He's more like a   '   DRJEAMS WITHN DREAMS.       229 porklepine than a human. There's Jemima, too! To make her look like anything but a hedgehog, I have to curry her like a horse." Whereat Jemima, a young lady troubled with a perennial rash in the head, through excessive friction, feebly assented. "But them bristles," continued Mrs. J., "all come from the father's side. Oh! I was a fool the day I married a man with a scalp like half a horse-chestnut shell. You needn't grin, Jack. I'd like to know where you'd be now, if it wasn't for me?" As it was barely possible that, without a mother, Jack would be just nowhere at all, that young gentleman thought a reply unnecessary. At this moment, the servant announced that Father Wil- frid was below, and wanted to see Mrs. J. When she was gone, Jack senior, turning to his son, puffed out a dense vol- ume of smoke, and said: "She a'n't a bad wife nor mother, Jack. A good wife is a jewel, my boy; and so is a good husband. I knowed a lubber, onot, who had a good wife, and never knew it." "Didn't he?" remarked Jack junior. "No," replied Jack senior. "I never see such a pious man when he was drunk, in all my born days. He used to yelp psalms, until you'd have thought all the dogs in the neigh- borhood would go mad a-answering him. And wouldn't' he preach hellfire then?" "Would he?" said Jack junior. "I believe you, he would," replied his father. "You ought to have heard him. 'Did you see Timothy to-day?' said a friend of mine to me. 'No,' said I. 'WTell, he's a-going it,' says he. 'I want to know?' says I. 'He a'n't elevated sky- high yet,' says he, ' but he's got as far as purgatory already; and that a'n't far from the mark.' By and by he would get sober, and then you ought to have heard him." "Was he very bad?" inquired Jack junior. "Bad!" cried his father, with a long whistle; " bad! Old Nick never beat him, I believe. The way he used to abuse his womankind, was a caution. Poor creeters! Some men seem to think women was made just to be kicked when things goes wrong." "So they does," remarked Jack junior. "I only wish your mother had the management of him for twenty-four hours," continued Jack senior. "If she wouldn't    <pb n="230-231" xml:id="VAC6560-00000124"/> wrench his blessed ears off, I'm an Indian crocodile. I see them women crying fit to break their hearts, and the big, ugly brute yelling and abusing like mad. It would serve him right to make him sit five minutes in a kettle of biling water; and I guess he would squirm considerable in the operation." To this, Jack junior assented gravely. "When I was very benevolent," continued his father, "I used to go and kick Timothy's shins; but the women alw"ays turned against me; so I give it up. Women, Jack, is rum when they gets contrary; then they're like bad eggs-you don't exactly know what to do with them." With such apt illustrations of philosophy, Jack senior strove to edifv his children, as good fathers should always do. Jack junior was melted. He grinned. "Ah," said he, "I see, once, a queerer start than a woman." "Did you?" remarked his father. "I did," said Jack. "We was down in South Ameriky, and went off on a day's hunting. After shooting one or two birds of prey, we began to grow hungry-but a fellow must be mighty hungry before lie takes kindly to eating a turkey buz- zard. In the middle of our troubles, one of the mess cried, ' Hallo! here's a eel!' a Ve run to the spot where the critter was caught. He had swum into a hole in the rock, and, when the tide ebbed, couldn't find his way out." "I understand," said Jack senior, nodding. "So," continued his son, I poked my arm in to haul the thing out. My! how I caught it." "The eel?" asked his father. "No, indeed," replied Jack. "What did you catch?" asked his father. "I don't know," answered Jack.  "I felt as if the eel kicked me in the pit of my stomach." "Good!" remarked the senior. I should like to see an eel kick-when the critter a'n't got no legs." "Can't help that," continued Jack. 'If he hadn't no legs, he kicked with his tail. That's all I know. The way I tumbled over, was a caution. 'Why didn't you bring him out, horse? ' asked one of the fellows. 'Bring him out 1' said I. ' Why, he brought me out.' 'So I see,' says he. ' What's the matter with you?  You look as pale as a snowhall. What a chap you are-to be scared by a eel ' says he. 'You try,' says I, 'and there will be two of us.' So in he 1   goes, and grabs the eel by the tail. But it was no go. Nther he, nor any of the others (for they all would have a triaD, cared to poke their fingers in that pie twice. I never could make out what it was.") "No; nor anybody else," remarked Jack senior, knocking out the ashes of his pipe. "I rather fancy, my son, you were all drunk. A sober man needs have his wits about him to grapple an eel; but a gentleman what's a little slewed, might as well try to pick up his own shadow; as I have tried scores of times, thinking it might get wet lying on the ground." What Father Wilfrid wanted with the lady of the house, cannot yet be told. Suffice it to say, that the next day he paid Mrs. Sewell a long visit; the object of which will ppear here- after. As the chapter is short, suppose we conclude it by relating what occurred at Viot ; matters introductory to what we have to say by and by. but not sufficient for a chapter by themselves. The garrison of Viot had surrendered, the prisoners had been marched to their respective places of confinemient, and Godfroy, together with his officers, met in the town hall, where the mayor, etc., gave in the town's adhesion to the cause of Uphorn. When this ceremony was over, and the mayor, etc., had departed, Godfroy turned to Claiude, and said- But here let us pause. Would there was an artist talent ed enough, and moderate enough in. his charges, to do justice to the scene. Fancy, O my reader! fancy a large hall, with, a1 raised platform at one end, on which stands Godfir-oy, surround. ed by his suite in their very best uniforms. There is Godfroy, first of all, full three inches higher than any present. By him stands Sir Christopher Weezy, martial, but not prepossessing in personal appearance; being what Englishmen would call meagre, and Americans scrawny.  Next conies Rappcnlham-. mer himself, as fine a specimen of the old soldier as ever stood upon human legs. On the other side, Sir Peter de Steele in his scarlet dress, whispers to the valorous Bolero Schneider. knocker, who would look very much like a, hero if he did not look more like a bolster. In fine, fill the platform and line the sides of the room with the elite of Dreamland.  There standa the grandees of that country: the Niebelungens; the Vander Utopias; the parvenus Von Kabeljaus, and their cousins tle Delamorues, whom  the envious were wont to call the (odiiz:li aristocracy; those great nobs of the land of dreams, the Suores, the head of whose house, Lord Snore, had led the van inll the ^5;tS--^^    <pb n="232-233" xml:id="VAC6560-00000125"/> 232       DREAMS WITHN DREAMS. recent assault; in fine, all the De Reves, the TrAiums, the De Cauchemars with their connections, the Alpdriickens, etc., etc., etc. From t among these Claude is called out, and addressed by Godfroy in most magniloquent terms. "Young man," qllot}h he, "it has pleased his grace, Louis, Duke of Uphorn, in con- sideration of your invaluable services, to reward you for your patriotism, your gallantry, and your perseverance. You are promoted to the rank of colonel in the State's service; and- as a knight only can hold so lofty a position-in the Duke's him the accolade in the most genteel manner, he added, ' Brave in battle, judicious in council, modest humlane, and charitable, rise, Sir Claude, no longer llartrettet, but lord and governor of this town. Your coat of arms shall be a femnme vielle or, em bracing an azure heifer gules with the motto, 'De gustibus non of that name."  "By Jove '" said Rappenhamnmer, sturdily, "Sir Claude o ou. You have worked hard for your kn ighthood. and won it as fairly as, I am sure, you will oear it gracefully." And my lord Rappenhammer could say no more; for his few hours before he died. Then said Sir Christopher Weezy: "Allow me to con- gratulate you. I shall be most happy to see you any time you call." With this, the man reposed his jaws, and his polite invita- tion was, indeed, cheap enough; seeing the estates of that gen- tleman lay on the extreme boundary of Transylvania. Then said Sir Peter de Steele, a nobleman exceeding wont to pilfer, and with a fine eye for the spoil: "You ha ve gained more, perhaps, than you woet of; for the town of Viot is mar vellous opulent in corn and wine.'" "Sir Peter," interrteed Godfroy, who overheard thi re- marl, "I know Sir Claude, and he knows my observations do not affect him personally. Uphorn has positively forbidden   DREAMS WITHN DREAMS.        '233 the taking anything without paying for it, under any shape or pretext. And although," he concluded, somewhat sarcastically, "so chivalrous a knight as Sir Peter de Steele would not de- mean himself by stealing, a knight just as noble would be hanged if he did." Sir Peter, whose feelings were not hurt very easily, grinned, and winked at one of his subalterns; the which Godfroy did not choose to remark. "Now, Sir Claude," he continued, with an expressive smile, "your gubernatorial duties will not begin while I am in possession of the town. You therefore have leave of absence for a few days." Here Godfroy nodded pleasantly to Claude, who bowed, and was off- -In a jiffy * to his men, who greeted him with loud hur- rahs. In another jiffy, he was on a barrel, making them an oration. In another jiffy, he had hold of a horse, somehow- for the man had contrived already to make himself so popular in Viot, that he could have anything he liked for the asking. In another jiffy, he had leaped on the animal as never knight did before. In another, he was galloping over hill, over dale, through bush, through brier; dwelling gladly on the meeting which was so near; flying along in the fresh air of dayspring; thinking of Cecilia, and what she would sav. And what a rapturous jiffy, when her cottage came in sight! What a devil of a jiffy it was, when he leaped off his horse, thundered at the door, cracked a panel, and frightened the old man nearly out of his senses, as he opened the door, and Claude bounced in, tumbling over his father-in-law elect, and both rolling in the dust together; getting up somehow; greeting the old woman with a hug, and the young one with another (albeit longer), and then sitting down and telling all about it. And great was the surprise at Bertrand, when the news spread. Wonderful were the false reports that circulated. Much was the conversation at the inn of Ernest Toservem. Mighty was the throng of visitors at the cottage of Cecilia. But, if the reports were marvellous, much more wonderful was the history given by Claude himself.  Lord Godfroy had, singlehanded, slain one half the garrison, while Clovis was throwing the other half into the ditch. The whole town had * Jiffy.-Let not the reader scorn the word; it is in Webster.

Benedict de Balde had hung himself to his bedpost in despair, until he had been blown up with the rest, and dropped, piece by piece, into the camp; when he liad been picked up, carefully put together, and sent home to his mother. Exceeding was the obstinacy of Ernest Tor-ervem, wh1o be- lieved everything fabulous, and doubted or denied everythiing true il the narrative. Scornful were the remarks of Solomon Coffin, the sexton, in his criticisms on' the conduct of the be- siegers, which he delivered in a sepulchral voice. Timorous was the admiration of Jonathan Sewell, the tailor. Stolid was the countenance of Smaragdus, who never uttered a syllable. Curious was Ebenezer, who forgot his sore head, and was quite inquisitive. But all agreed on one point, to wit, that Claude was greatly improved, and a credit to the village. And there sat Cecilia, thinking of that poor old mother, and how proud she would have been that day. And then the girl looked proudly at her lover, as if she would say, "I loved him when everybody spoke ill of him. And see here I " It was high holiday in the village, you may be sure. The Professor, who was in great favor now he was independent, came to the cottage with little Gertrude; who was in his arms so much, that Dame Toservem remarked, "she stuck to him like a pimple on your nose." Which simile, doubtless, was suggested to that excellent woman by the fact that her counte- nance was embellished by such acuminated elevations of the cuticle. But, whether or no, there he was, and there was little Ger- trude. Cecilia, who had already struck up an intimacy with the child, had her at once. The gentle little creature laughed merrily, as she hugged Cecilia, and Claude stood by delighted, while the old Professor rubbed his hands in serene satisfaction. Claude and Gertrude immediately fell in love with each other, and the newhorn knight had her out of Cecilia's arms before a wight could say Jack Robinson. And 'there Claude sat, be- grimed with powder, his dress disarranged, strong and muscu- lar, like the sturdy warrior he was, holding the fairy child on his lap, and laughing pleasantly as she patted his bronzed cheek. Meanwhile, the day passed busily at Viot. Godfroy was occupied in quartering troops, seeing to the fortifications, send- ing and receiving messengers, and all that kind of a thing. It was on the arrival of one of those messengers from the Duke, that one of Leander's comrades informed him that my lord   DREAMS WITHN DREAMS.        23J Rappenhammer had received orders to hang him forthwith on a lofty gallows. This terrible news burst like a thunderclap on the heroic man. "Good gracious!" cried he. "There's the reward of merit." "But you deserted your ranks," argued the originator of the report. "You are in for it now, my boy." "But what is the use of hanging a man?" whined the poor fellow. "As an example," replied his tormentor. "Are you not proud? You will serve your country by your death." "But I don't want to serve my country by my death," said Leander. "Why am I picked out?  Why do they not hang somebody else? How would they like to be hanged? I am sure I do not want to be hanged. Who does? It is out of reason to suppose anybody does want to be hanged. Well then, why do they want to hang me? Why do they go and talk of such hideous things?" "Hadn't you better go to Lord Godfroy, and tell him so?" suggested Shuttle, little thinking Leander would do so. "I will, replied Leander, and off he went. Now it came to pass, that as Godfroy (who, as the reader may suppose, needed rest after his violent toil for six-and thirty hours) was about to retire for the night, his servant entered the room with a bewildered look. "What is the matter now?" asked Godfroy. "There is a man outside," replied the servant, "who says he has important business with your lordship, and will not be denied admittance. I think he is a little deranged." "Let him in," said Godfroy; "but first put those arms out of reach." Leander entered. "Well, my good fellow," asked Godfroy, "what do you want?" nI want to know when I am going to be hanged," replied Leander. Godfiroy stared at him. Just say that again, will you?" said he. I am not sure I quite understand you." "I want to know," reiterated Leander, '. when I am going to the gallows?" "Really, my good friend, I cannot give you'any informa- tion upon the subject," said Godfroy. "What! are you so certain of escaping drowning?"        .    <pb n="236-237" xml:id="VAC6560-00000127"/> DREAMS WITHN iDREtiiAMS. "I don't want to be drowned neither," replied Leander. "But I want to know when I am going to be hanged ?" "My friend," said Godfroy, getting into bed, "have you been drinking to-night ?" "Not that I knows on," replied Leander. "Are you sure ? " asked Godfroy. "Certain," answered Leander. "Then what the devil do you want, man?" asked God- froy, impatiently. "Speak out, there's. a good fellowl for I want to go to sleep." "Why," said Leander, " if you are going to hang me-" "Who is going to hang you ? " asked Godfroy, wrathfully. " Wly, you," answered Leander. I ? " 'cried Godfroy. " Who told you so ?  'My lord Rappenhammer," promptly replied Leander, mentioning the authority of his informant. "Call my lord Rappenhammer here," cried Godfroy to the servant. " He is asleep by this time," hinted the servant, who lield opinions of his own on Leander's veracity. "Wake him up, then," said Godfroy. "I will not have the humblest of my followers tormented by such cruel jests. And my lord Rappenhammer, too, of all men! Why, I would as soon have thought of the Holy Father cutting capers. And with his gray hair ! Call him here at once." Now Sir Peter de Steele slept in the room next to that of my lord Rappenhammer, and the servant was obliged to rout him out,.because the door was locked, and there was no other communication except by crossing Sir Peter's apartment. That knight, being unlawfully in possession of certain personal prop. erty which his enemies might call plunder; and being, more- over, one of those gentlemen whose ideas are not very clear when they are suddenly roused from a heavy sleep; this same gentleman, gathering from the servanc's'message through the door that he was come on hanging matter, was in a great stew, perspiring exceedingly. He therefore sent back word to God- froy that he might set his mind at ease; for there was no use trying to get him (Sir Peter) out of bed at that hour of the night; and that, if attacked, he would defend himself even to the death. All which the servant, who did not know who was speaking, faithfully reported to Godfroy as coming from my lord Rappenhammer. "I believe the devil is in them all to-night I" cried God-   I),REAMS WITHIN DREAMS.   froy, leaping c, of bed, and dressing himself hastily.  " What possesses' tIlt r a ? I)o you really tell me he sent such a mes- sage ? " "VWordl for word as I have reported," answered the ser- vant. "Well," cried Godfrov, " we will smoke the rat out of his hole, I warrant. The mountain will not come to Mahomet, so Mahomet must needs go to the mountain. Somebody is insane to-niglt, if I am not so myself. Come along, sir. What is your name?   Leander, el ? Come, Master Leander, and we will settle our little difficulty at once." So saying, Godfroy strode rapidly on till he reached Sir Peter's door, at which he began to thump energetically. "Hallo, there ! Hallo! hallo I" cried he, thundering at the panels. "You will never take me alive," replied Sir Peter, despe- rately, from within. "' Who the deuce wants to take you, alive or dead ?" cried  Godfroy. "' Open the door. I want to see Rappenhammer." "What the devil's up?" cried that nobleman, from the inner room. "Why don't you open that door, De Steele, and stop that infernal noise ? Is the town on fire ? " " No, the town is not on fire," answered Godfroy, entering the room, followed by Leander; "but I want to know what induced you to send me such a message ? " My lord Rappenhammer opened his eyes wide. "A mes- sage ? " said lie. " I never sent you a message." "WhatI" asked Godfroy.    "When I sent for .you, five minutes ago, did you not send me word you would not come ? " " Did I ?" replied Rappenhammer, taking off his nightcap, and replacing it more comfortably. "Did I ? Of course I did not." Godfroy sat down in despair. " Now I wonder," said he, emphatically, "I wonder who is doing all this?  Come here, fellow. Tell my lord Rappenhammer what you told me. He informed you that you were to be hanged, did he not ?" " He ?" replied Leander. "Why, he never spoke a word to me on the subject." " Go-go to the devil! " roared Godfroy, leaping up. Out flew Leander, with Godfroy after him, leaving my lord Rap- penhammer in a state of considerable astonishment; for it might well perplex anybody to be awakened at midnight, to    <pb n="238-239" xml:id="VAC6560-00000128"/> 238      DREAMS WITHN DREAMS. see one gentleman bring another gentleman into the room apparently only for the purpose of kicking him out again. And so Leander learned he was not to be hanged; after which, quiet and slumber reigned over Viot. CHAPTER XX. NARRATING WHAT ARDOR AND SIMPLICIUS DID MEANWHLE. MEANTIME, the ardent Ardor and his companion, the wise Simplicius, not being valiant men of war, as they had fondly deemed themselves, upon Uphorn's arrival feigned important business, and left Bertrand Castle. Fearing, if they should return to their native town, they would be enlisted on one side or the other, they wisely determined to seek some rural retreat out of harm's way. "For," argued Ardor, when speaking to his friend on the subject, "it behooves us to mortify our incli- nations, the better to show our devotion to the cruel ones we love. Therefore let us deny ourselves the glory and pleasure of smiting the foe; and, seeking out some rustic retreat, pour forth our sighs upon the balmy air. This the statutes of Cla lu- cer absolutely enjoin."  "Do they, now?" said Simplicius. "They do," replied Ardor. "The fifteenth statute tells us to do this; for instance, it commands us to swear and stare and counterfeit a lesing; to save our lady's honor, and fight for her boldly; and to say she is good, virtuous, ghostly, clear of entent and heart; yea, of thought and will. It is true, there are many things I do not understand in this statute. For instance, why should a lover swear and stare? Swearing is wrong, and staring impolite. Yet-in such great respect hold I the immortal bard-I have had a dummy made to represent the mysterious thing I ought to swear and stare at: the which I have done roundly. Then, I have not the least idea what counterfeiting a lesing is: but I am ready to counterfeit it the instant I am informed. Then, again, why should I call my charmer ghostly? I am not courting a hobgoblin, I believe? But Chaucer says ghostly, and so do I. Whatever it is, it must mean something very spiritual."   DREAMS WIrrHN DREAMS.        239 "I should think so," observed the wise Simplicius. "It would never do for us to give up the ghost. And pray, what isclear of entent?" "I cannot answer that question with the preciseness I should like," replied Ardor. "I fancy, clear of entent means clear of understanding. Some women are possessed with an intellectual clearness of perception, just as you possess reason- merely nominally." "Upon my word," said the incensed Simplicius, "you can be as blandly impudent as any man I ever knew. Merely nominally, indeed! I like that!" "Well, what's the matter with the word?" asked Ardor. "A'n't it nice?" "The word is nice enough," replied Simplicius; "but I object to being only nominally reasonable." a"You raise strange objections," said Ardor. "But have it as you like it, and let us be harmonious." "Good," replied Simplicius. "You will always find me peaceable, unless you try on your superior airs." "Airs!" cried Ardor. "Airs, sir! I have airs, sir? No, sir. I never have airs, sir. You have airs, sir." "I have airs?" cried' Simplicius. "No, sir. I never have airs, sir. I wouldn't condescend to have them at no price." "At any price, you should say," corrected Ardor. "Two negatives make an affirmative-don't you know that, you Abderite?" "You're another," retorted Simplicius. "What is an Abderite?" "An Abderite is the classic for a fool," remarked Ardor. "Oh, indeed!" said Simplicius. "Then I advise you, when you talk that way to me, to stick wholly to the classics, and not translate. But what were you going to say about clearness of understanding?" "I forget," replied Ardor. "Ah!" he sighed; " what a lot of dodges lovers are always up to." ' So they are," assented the wise Simplicius. "By the by," continued Ardor, " there is one way of mak- ing yourself immortal, Simplicius, which I wonder you never thought of." "Is there?" said Simplicius. "There is," said Ardor. "Shall I tell you?" "Why not?" replied Simplicius.    <pb n="240-241" xml:id="VAC6560-00000129"/> 240       DREAMS WIrHN DREAMS. "Do you," said Ardor, "go to Liebchen's door, and sit opposite it on a sthne, or any other very uncomfortable seat. There you must remain, weeping bitter tears, until you die. Then, with her snowy hands she will dig your grave. Anselm shall write a ballad in your memory, and I will go round sing- ing it. Thingumbob gave me the notion, in his Lay of the Young Count; and the idea is really not bad. I should very much like to see somebody else do it." "Precisely my case," said the wise Simplicius. "I should infinitely prefer seeing somebody else do it. I suppose, after death, I will do as did Aager." "And who, pray, was Aager?" asked Ardor. "Oh! a chap," replied Simplicius, " who figures in a Dan- ish ballad. He loved one Feva-a'n't that a rum notion?" "Why?" demanded Ardor. "Feva and Aager sound deuced like fever and ague, don't they?" asked Simpllcius. "The coincidence is strange," said Ardor. "But what about them?" "Why," replied Simplicius, "Aager died one day. Feva wept, of course; hearing which, Aager jumped out of his grave, slung his coffin on his back, and stalked up to the house. ' Who's prowling round here?' says Feva. 'It's me,' says Aager.  ' Who's e?' says Feva.  'Aager,' says Aager. "et me in.' 'Can't,' says Feva. 'Guess you're the devil, old hoss.' 'Blessed if I an!' says Aager. So she let him in, combed his hair, and asked him how he liked his quarters? After some chat, he shouldered his coffin again, said he guessed he would go; and the beauteous Feva, saying she would see him as far as the churchyard, put on her bonnet and shawl, and off they started. The upshot of the whole was, that she died on the next Monday; though of what disease, the poet don't say." "Truly," said Ardor, " you tell that romantic tale in 'a very unromantic manner." "Romantic or unromantic," replied Simplicius, "I never read such trash. People don't go round shouldering their coffins after they are dead and buried; or, if they do, what's the use of undertakers?" "You must not take things too literally," said Ardor. "The legend is an allegory, showing how memory rises from the tomb." "And has its hair combed," sneered Simplicius.   DREAMS WrrHN DREAMS.        241 "Why, what a miserable ass you are!" said Ardor, indig- nantly. "Oh I I am, am I?" replied Simplicius. "Of course you are," said Ardor. ' Cannot you see that all these little attentions argue solicitude and womanly affec- tion, you booby? Bless my soul! what a nincompoop you are, to be sure. Now, don't answer me, whatever you do. On these points I admit no discussion. You hold your tongue, or else go away." This, of course, silencel Simplicius, who was a strange mixture of submission and rebellion. Harmony being restored, the two proceeded lovingly together. Now it came to pass, that near by was a natural grotto; seeing which, Ardor reined in his horse, and exclaimed, joy- ously, Fortune at length, Simplicius, has indeed favored us. Let us get off our horses." "Do you see any more graves?" asked Simplicius, with a grin. Ardor reddened, but pretended not to hear. ' Do you see that grotto?" he asked. "I see a hole," replied the practical Simplicius. Well, hole, then," said Ardor, snappishly. (Call it what you like; but do you see it?" "Certainly," replied Simplicius; "and a dirty one it is." "Never mind remarks," said Ardor. "Confine yourself to answering my questions. I intend to remain 'here for a sea. son. Here shall our retreat be-" "Not much of a treat," muttered Simplicius, turning up his "Come," continued Ardor, "let us descend, and examine this sequestered nook." "It don't smell very nice," remarked Simplicius, as they entered the cavern of love. "We can soon remedy that," replied his companion. "I wonder to what use it can have been consecrated? Perhaps already some unhappy swain has embalmed it with sighs--" Embalmed I   " interrupted the other. " By George! I should say skunks had been here lately. I thought I knew the infernal odor. I can't stand it, if you can. Love is all very w'ell; but I never heard unrequited affection was associated with polecats. Come along, Ardor, or you'll have to bury your clothes. Lucky for us, the diabolical animals have gone "    <pb n="242-243" xml:id="VAC6560-00000130"/> 242      DREAMS WITHN DREAMS. out to air themselves. Air themselves, indeed! They want it sadly." "Oh!" sighed Ardor, as they were proceeding from the sequestered nook, " pigs-cats-skunks-what next?  Lead on 1 " And, pausing, he sighed again. Simplicius whistled. "I'll tell you what, Ardor," said his companion, after a while; " you don't go the right way to work." "And what would you advise?" asked Ardor, humbly. "Cottages are plenty, a'n't they? Why don't we hire one?" replied the other. "We can hallow it with tears, and keep the roof from leaking with shingles." "True!" cried Ardor, his eyes sparkling with delight. "The idea is excellent. Embrace me, Simplicius." And the two embraced. But, if we should look before we leap, we should do the same before we embrace on horseback. The turning of the two friends caused their toes to stick into their horses' sides; which, acting as spurs, caused the animals to start forward briskly. The unfortunate men, coming in hard contact with a bough which stretched across the path, were both shoved un- ceremoniously over their horses' tails, and came down on the earth in a sitting posture, with an awful bump; each swain uttering an agonized "Oh!" The horses stopped at once, and their unhappy masters, each rubbing the afflicted spot, mounted the saddle with rueful countenances. After this, they rode on quite a while without speaking, until Ardor broke the silence, by remarking that, a little be- yond, there was an inn kept by one Jack, where they might inqaire about a cottage.. "Good!  observed Simplicius, approvingly. "Yes, indeed," said Ardor, brightening' up; "and there we can keep the Statutes of Love right pleasantly. One of them will be peculiarly applicable to our situation." "And which one is that?" asked Simplicius. "To sigh," answered Ardor, "seven times in the evening, seven times at midnight, and seven times in the morning; to drink a caudle very early; to keep our heads from all diseases; and thus to win the lover's garland." "And what may a caudle be?" asked Simplicius, anx- iously. "A  warm drink," replied Ardor, "composed of wine,   DREAMS WITHN DREAMS.        243 water, and spices. 'I see you like the idea, by the way you lick your lips. That is right. You may always love whatever the statutes recommend, for they were inspired by the oracle of Eros himself." "And why do they enjoin us to keep our heads clean?" inquired Simplicius. "Because," answered Ardor, "a lover should be comely; and how could he be comely, unless he used a comb?" "True," remarked Simplicius. "I did not think of that." "You never think of a great many things," said Ardor; "and it is lucky for you I am by to aid you sometimes. Ah, we must sigh evening, midnight, and morning; sigh piteously, yea, bellow right lustily for love. I have even read of lovers who went so strongly into this part of the business, that they have eaten huge quantities of unripe fruit; so that the colic, which was sure to follow, might aid them to yell the more loudly. And then we must act like the Black Knight." "Who was he?" asked Simplicius. "One of Chaucer's heroes,' replied Ardor, " who says, that in his will he leaves his lady his heart and spirit, to do with them whatever she likes: though I cannot see what she can do with the heart, but bury or pickle it. As for the spirit, unless she likes spectres better than I do, she would not be very gratified by the legacy. This is what he says: ' And, if I die, in my testament, My heart I send, and my spirit also, Whatsoever she lists with them to do.' By the last remark, to wit, ' if I die,' you may perceive, Sim- plicius, that it is not at all necessary to perish for the sake of love; and that is the only thing which now restrains me from following my first inclination, and shining in battle. Other- wise, no doubt, I should outrival the deeds of the lion-hearted Richard in Palestine, and you would eclipse the deeds of Paris on the fields before Troy." "What! the city of Paris?" asked Simplicius. "No, you fool!" replied Ardor. "I mean Paris, son of Priam; otherwise called Alexander. Did you never hear of him?" "Did I never hear of him?" repeated Simplicius, impa- tiently. "What a fellow you are! Of course I never heard of him. A man can't know everything, I suppose?  Who was Paris?"    <pb n="244-245" xml:id="VAC6560-00000131"/> 244       DREAMS WITHN DREAMS. "Paris," answered Ardor, "was the son of Priam by his wife Hecuba. He was carried, when quite an infant, to Mount Ida by Archelaus--" Beg pardon," interrupted the wise Simplicius, ' but was that the Archelaus, son of King Herod, who murdered the innocents?"   - "1I wish you had been murdered before you asked me such a stupid question," said Ardor, testily. Why, this happened before the Trojan war, you fool " "And wht: of that?" asked Simplicius. "What has the Trojan war to al with the matter? Of course, you needn't answer unless you choose. And don't call me a fool again, if you please." "Well, I won't," said Ardor. "The siege of Troy hap- pened many hundred years before Herod was thought of." "Oh I it was another Archelaus, then!" said Simplicius. "Wise man! You have discovered it at last, and can cry, Eureka! Eureka!" remarked Ardor.  "But to continue. Paris, as I am told, being left on Mount Ida, was brought up by shepherds-classic heroes, by the by, are always being brought up by shepherds-and, in the course of time, became a man." "Was he a woman before?" asked Simplicius. "Well, then, grew up," replied Ardor, tartly. "Oh " said Simplicius; "that was the game, was it?" "He grew up," pursued Ardor, "and married a nymph-" "Married a what?" asked Simplicius, aghast. A nymph," replied Ardor. "An imp?" said Simplicius, scandalized. "A nymph, jackass!" cried Ardor. "Don't you know what a nymph is?" "You can pronounce it impf, if you choose; but the add- ing an f to Old Nick's tail, won't alter his character or dispo- sition," said Simplicius. "Well, I forgive you this time," remarked Ardor, "seeing you have stumbled accidentally upon a sensible view; for an imp and a nymph are first cousins by the side of their father: a gentleman who has great influence with you, my poor Sim- plicius." And who is he?" asked the other. "The devil," replied Ardor, urbanely. "Get out!" cried Simplicius. "You're another. But don't chaff a chap. Tell me what a nymph is, there's a good fellow."   DREAMS WITHN DREAMS.        245 "A nymph," replied Ardor, "is a classical young lady, generally represented as genteelly dressed in the covering afforded her by nature, and nothing else." "What! not a stitch?" asked Simplicius, aghast. "Not a stitch," answered Ardor; "not so much as a brooch. There were a great many kinds of them. There were mountain nymphs, dale nymphs, mead nymphs, water nymphs, tree nymphs, and wood nymphs. The whole lot of them were devils." "The devil they were!" cried Simplicius. "The devil they were, indeed," said Ardor; "and such an one was it the fate of Paris to espouse. Her name was (Enone. He went back to Troy, and left his wife on Mount Ida; but he made a pretty mess of it in the city." "Did he, now?" said Simplicius. "He did," said Ardor. "He ran away with Helen, wife of Menelaus, and caused the Trojan war. After signalizing himself in that struggle chiefly by running away whenever he had a chance, he was wounded at last by a poisoned arrow, and died on Mount Ida in the arms of his wife CEnone, whom he had so cruelly deserted. Paris and CEnone were buried in one grave; where they probably decayed in-the course of time, unless properly made up into mummies." "Upon my word," snorted Simplicius, " you are a pretty fellow  You compare yourself to Richard of England, and can find no better likeness for me than your valiant Paris, who, you say, signalized himself in war chiefly by running away whenever he got a chance." "There are some strong points of resemblance between you," replied Ardor. "Are you not even now running from the dangers of battle?" "Once there was a pot,' remarked Simplicius, "and once there was a, kettle. The kettle called the pot sable, and the pot called tne kettle ebon. Which was sable and which was ebon, or whether both were neither ebon nor sable, but black as the ace of spades, I leave you to determine."  "Pot or kettle, ebon or sable, black or white, brave or cowardly," replied Ardol, " here we are at the inn. Hallo I How are you?  This last remark was addressed to a pale young man, who was reclining on a rustic sofa just outside the door of the tavern. A very pretty young girl was leaning over him, ad- justing some part of his dress.    <pb n="246-247" xml:id="VAC6560-00000132"/> 246      DREAMS WITHN DREAMS. "Hallo, Ubald!" cried both the lone pilgrims. "Hallo, Simplicius Hallo, Ardor!  returned Ubald, who was no less a person than the young officer who had been wounded when he interfered, in the forest, between Albert and his antagonist. "Why," said Ardor, as the young girl turned her head, "why, Miss Rosalia, who would have thought of meeting you here?" "My wife," said Ubald, presenting her. "I. congratulate you, my dear fellow," cried Ardor. "So you are married, at last?" "Yes," replied Ubald. "I was wounded. Rosey's father thought me dying, took pity on me, and journeyed down here with Rosey. We were married soon after, and I began to mend from that day. I am out of danger now, and, with the physician's consent, we are about to stay a few months in a pretty cottage close at hand in the, woods." "And is there any other near, which is vacant?" asked the wise Simplicius. "Two," answered Ubald. "Then, by Jove I I vote we hire one of them," cried Sim- plicius, turning to Ardor. "It is just what we want." "Yes," replied Ardor; "let us do so without delay. Where does the owner reside?" Ubald laughed. "As ardent as ever," I see," he said; "but do not trouble yourselves on that score. I am the owner of both, and you are welcome to either you choose. But tell me all about yourselves, and chiefly why you so especially want the cottage?" Hereupon Simplicius, in the innocence and purity of his heart, was just about faithfully to narrate a circumstantial ac- count of their adventures, when he was luckily stopped by a pinch in the thigh, administered by his friend, who related their history in the following poetical strain: "Happy are ye, fair Rosalia and fortunate Ubald! to be joined forever in the bonds of union and bliss. Not so with us, poor, unfortunate victims of the tender passion, crippled in our energies, overthrown in our course, trampled upon by the fickle goddess who rules the ups and downs of life. Why are we wanderers over the face of this sublunary sphere? Be- cause Love has proved unpropitious, and compels the wise man and the fool to be close companions in their unhappy peregrina- tions."   DREAMS WITHN DREAMS.        247 "I am the wise man, you understand," remarked Sim- plicius. "Yes, indeed," said Ardor, turning wrathfully on him. "You are the wise man for choosing a sage as companion; and I was a fool for selecting a zany for mine. Bat to con- tinue. The consequence is, we roam together, seeking nothing but repose, looking for nothing but a quiet spot, where in secret we may weep over our woes. Often hath fortune perse- cuted us savagely, and I may say with Virgil's hero, 'I am the pious Ardor, tossed about over many lands and seas by the avenging wrath of a cruel goddess." "iJust as pious as tossed over seas," remarked Simplicius, quietly. Without noticing him, Ardor continued: "I have been deceived everywhere, by a mother with her babe ---  "Miaw!" cried Simplicius. "At the tomb itself-" Simplicius grunted. "Until I reached Castle Bertrand, where I was received with kindness, and treated respectfully by everybody." "'All round the haycock, " sang the wise Simplicius; "Leaving Castle Bertrand," continued Ardor, "our road led us through a diversified country, very much like a terres- trial elysium. Romantic hills swept the western horizon, while, to the orient, rose cloud-capped mountains crowned with per- petual snow, which raised their stern crags, bristling with pines, and threatened to pierce the blue sky-" "And make a hole in it," added Simplicius. "The smooth valley," pursued Ardor, "carpeted with green grass and many-colored flowers, fed a vast multitude of sheep and kine:   while a silvery streamlet, gliding through emerald meadows. spread fertility through the vale, and afford- ed nourishment to the lowing and bleating-"  "And baaing," suggested Simplicius. "I wish, Simplicius," cried Ardor, turning angrily to that gentleman, "  that you would not be forever poking your re- marks into my observations. Well, Ubald, as I was saying, Nature, in all her pomp, spread her treasures before us, who were seeking a solitary retreat, wherein we might deplore the cruelty of the divine Amanta, and the wench Liebchen-" "Wench yourself!" cried the indignant Simplicius. " What do you mean by blackguarding a lady, whose shoe your Amanta is not worthy to wipe with her hair?"    <pb n="248-249" xml:id="VAC6560-00000133"/> 248      DREAMS WITHN DREAMS. "O  man of triple brass!" cried Ardor; "you never read. You never think. You always talk nonsense. A wench, in poetry, means a young woman; and your Liebchen, being only eighteen, can be called nothing else. Therefore she is a wench." "Oh! if that's the dodge," said Simplicius, "I beg your pardon. I suppose, then, Amanta is a wench too?" "Of course she is," replied Ardor, indignantly. "Did you think I would court my grandmother? Now let me go on, and don't be shoving that beldame Liebchen again into the con- versation." "Stop! stop! 'stop!" cried Simplicius. "Call her a wench as much as you like, but I won't have her called a beldame." "Unpoetical cormorant!" said Ardor. "Does not Spen- ser call a fair girl a beldame-that is, a belle dame-a beauti- ful lady? Go along with you, and let me proceed. To you, fair Rosalia, and to you, happy Ubald, I address myself. While we were thus peregrinating, we came to a frightful cave. We were about entering, when a hideous monster rushed forth, whom we would have slain, only he escaped by casting round him such dense vapors of sulphur, that we fell to the ground unable to pursue him. A little farther on, our horses stumbling, we were obliged to dismount." ("I should think we were," from Simplicius.) "Whereat I proposed that we should bend our steps hither, and go practically to work; hiring a cottage, and not acting-as Simplicius always does- like a stupid ass." "You be still," growled the gentleman thus flatteringly referred to. "You propose! I want to know who did pro- pose that move? I wonder who thought of it, after you had made a fool of yourself a score of times? You cut a rigma- role out of whole cloth; call a sow's grave, a girl's grave; a tomcat, a baby; a polecat, a dragon; and me, a stupid ass: one thing about as true as another." As the wise Simplicius thus let the animal out of the bag, Ubald could not help laughing, and even Rosalia smiled. Whereat Ardor, growing very red in the face, turned sharp on Simplicius, and cried: "Liar! dolt! knave! fool! idiot! ass t Who saw a pole. cat? Who saw a sow's grave? If you did, I did not. You big quintessence of a sieve, that can't hold anything, don't you see a lady is present? Don't you know, that when we speak to the fair sex, a polecat is a dragon; a flea, a backbiter; a   DREAMS WITHN DREAMS.        249 dish of cabbages, ambrosia; a mug of ale, nectar; and a drink of water, the crystal tribute offered by the babbling brook and pellucid fountains to refresh the wearied lords of  creation? Have you been so long in my society, and still need this information, you blundering blockhead? Don't you know better, you concentration of the quintessence of the most ran- cid dregs of extreme vulgarity? Hold your infernal tongue, or with my naked hands wilt I twist it out of your vile mouth, and throw it to the dogs." At this, Simplicius, who had never seen Ardor in quite such a rage before, really became frightened, and was consid- erably relieved by the opportune arrival of our old acquaint- ance, Prytanis Musarum, who now rode up on his nag; this brave and learned gentleman having left his home, urged by pretty much the same reasons that had exiled Ardor and Sim- plicius. Learning their object, lie readily agreed to unite his fortunes with theirs. Ubald and Rosalia, delighted with the prospect of society, encouraged the idea. Names being deemed romantic, and Ubald luckily having a copy of Virgil's Bucolics, each chose the pastoral title which he thought peculiarly adapted to his case; Prytanis, who had never read but one line of the Eclogues (and didn't understand that either), but who wished to appear perfectly conversant with them, selecting Tityrus (he thought the name was Tityre), without glancing at the vol- ume; which name the profound classic commentator knows to be the very first word of the very first line of the very first Eclogue. Ardor chose the euphonious name of Meliboeus, and very judiciously assigned that of Galatea to Simplicius; but was induced to withdraw the title, on being informed it was the name of a lady. Simplicius suggested for his own title the sonorous one of Lycisca, until he was informed it was the title of a mongrel, half dog and half wolf. He was finally con- tented with the name of Alphesibceus. The names Rosalind and Orlando were conferred. upon the young couple, which (Ubald remarked) would be the more consistent, as those pas- toral lovers were joined by Hymen at the end of Shakspeare's play. Sir Prytanis, who had never read a line of Shakspeare's, looked very profound, and said the idea was capital. But he inwardly resolved to read that author, and crush Ubald at the earliest convenient opportunity. So was formed the little rural group, of which more here- after.

Now my lord Clodolphus, being charged by Uphorn to attack General Drowsie, who commanded a body of cavalry quartered near a narrow pass, and, having driven them beyond the gorge, to keep the place, and let him know of it at once; my lord Clodolphus, I say, being ordered to do all this, and being, moreover, partic\ularly enjoined neither to spare spur nor sabre, did arm himself for battle, and place himself right valiantly at the head of his horsemen. "Verily," quoth he to his men, "verily will we make them gird up their loins and flee. Verily shall our warcry be, The spur and the sabre.' But, in sooth, must ye keep cool, and be in no wise wroth with the foe; for true courage, I trow, wots nothing of rage. 'Iram,' saith Seneca, 'ante vicit (id est, Scipio) quam Hanibalem ;' the which, verily, since some of you are not erudite, I translate thus: 'Anger he conquered be- fore he overcame Hannibal'-the latter word, to wit, over- came, being understood, and vicit being governed by Scipio, understood likewise. For more on which vice, I refer you to divers authors, profane and Christian; such as Cicero, Pater- culus, the historians of Alexander the Great, the fathers of the Church, and the like. Wherefore, keep cool. Coolness in a soldier is especially to be recommended. He must not only fight bravely, but judiciously. Verily is this not done by yield- ing to passion, but by conquering it. Accordingly must ye coolly slash the foe; and if a man among you doth not show plack, verily will I slash his head open, as sure as my name is Clodolphus." This speech was favorably received, not because the soldiers understood much of it, but because the last phrase-coupled, as it was, with my lord Clodolphus's known bravery, and accom- panied, as it was, by significant gestures -went to the hearts of a number of men, already goaded on to a great desire of revenge by repeated acts of injustice and tyranny. They soon reached the place of their destination. Say, Muse, how terrible was the charge, when the earth did shake, the unshorn mountains quake, and the terror-stricken foe awake. Down came my lord Clodolphus like a bolt, heading the charge,   DREAMS WITHN DREAMS.       251 with his pipe in his mouth, and as coolly giving orders as if he were ordering the disposition of viands at a picnic. "Quadru- pedumque putrem  cursu quatit ungu]a campum.' Oh  but there was a hurrying to and fro in Drowsie's camp! One started up, trod on the bottom of his nightgown, and slit it all up the back. Another upset the night lamp, and could not find his trousers in the dark. Here you might see one crawl- ing, terror stricken, under the bed, from one side; while there crept another under thk same, from the other, their heads meet- ing with a hollow sound, followed by shrieks and groans. Drowsie's tent was knocked down as he lay in balmy slumber; whereupon the heroic man awoke, and, guessing the nature of the disturbance, wisely judged it best to stay where he was. So he turned over, and went to sleep, leaving his army to take care of themselves; for which that injured man was afterward court martialled and cashiered. One of the great events of this battle was the upsetting of the tent used as the guard house. It was an immense pavilion, and accommodated more than a hundred men, who slept close together under its ample protection. Almost as soon as it was knocked down, it was hauled off, and there lay exposed to the eye a scene of pandemonian confusion: the whole guard lying together in their shirts, like a nest of gigantic white worms; some above, some below, all squirming, and each trying to crawl over somebody else. The sentinels all ran away at the very first attack. And sundry hogs, driven there for the pur- pose of being eaten, got loose, and filled the air with grunts and squeals. And everybody who could run away, did run away; and those who couldn't, lay on their stomachs, pretend- ing to be dead; and it was a glorious victory. So my lord Clodolphus won great fame and rich spoil. And my lord Clodolphus was mightily elate thereat; compar- ing himself with victors both ancient and modern (chiefly, how- ever, ancient), and pouring forth voluminous quotations. The enemy being thoroughly routed, my lord Clodolphus recalled his men, and encamped in the gorge; made a lofty rock his headquarters, and despatched a messenger to Uphorn, with the following despatch: "Veni, Vidi, Vici. I spurred, I sabred, I overcame. I wait further orders.                   CLODOLPHUS." Having sent this letter, posted sentries, and done all that was necessary, the learned warrior next looked out for some-    <pb n="252-253" xml:id="VAC6560-00000135"/> 252       DREAMS WITHN DREAMS. thing to eat. "For," he said, "verily is savory food not to be neglected by soldiers. Have we not many instances of heroes reclining at goodly banquets, discussing delicate viands? I believe so. Then let us eat. Surely may I say, Expedit militi edere, anirzam non edere-a facetious pun of mine own, meaning, it is useful for a soldier to eat, not to give up the ghost: the which, whoso listeth, may understand." Therefore my lord Clodolphus, whose headquarters, as we have said, were on a lofty rock overlooking not only the gorge itself, but the slope of the mountain on each side, placed a watchman, and then determined not to sleep until he heard from the Duke, but to while away the tedious hours with savory food and wise conversation. Ranging his officers round, who were nothing loath to follow their leader's example, my lord Clodolphus placed the first bit between his learned teeth just as the day broke. "Verily," quoth he, "I do not often see the sun rise, but I will to-day, in honor of our victory. In sooth, my country is now bound to offer nle crowns both mural and civic, and to place upon my head another of grass; even such as the legions placed on the head of Publius Decius, when he rescued the Roman host, who had been led by the Consul Cornelius, when he set out from Saticula, a frontier town of Campania, to chas- tise the Samnites, who came from the land of Samnium, which lieth over beyond Latium toward the rising of Phcebus Apollo. But, what I should like the most-' nee dubito quin mihi pla- citura sit;' the which, verily, ye doubtless understand-and what I think I the most deserve, is a triumph. The parlia- ment, being convened, should order me to enter the capital in triumph: for this honor must be conferred by the senate, albeit, when, in the Flaminian meadows, the patricians refused this pomp to the consuls for their double victory over the AEquans and Volscians at Algidum, and the Sabines (those de- termined enemies of Rome), Lucius Jeilius, tribune, and Caius Claudius so managed that, for the first time a triumph was cele- brated (as Livy tells us) by order of the people, without the authority of the senate. This honor having been awarded me, there will naturally arise a great discussion as to whether it shall be an ovatio or a curulis. I need not weary so learned an audience with trivial questions or descriptions of the tri- umphal ceremony. Verily, let us pass over the senatorial con- gregation in the temple of Bellona; the meeting outside the Capena gate; the style of my robes; the anilimals to be har-   DREAMS WITHN DREAMS.        253 nessed to my chariot, whether the customary white horses, or elephants, as in Pompey's case; or lions, as in that of Mark Antony; or tigers, as in that of Heliogabalus; or deer, as in that of Aurelian. Perhaps our country, having a right to her own opinions, may aim at originality, and my car may be drawn by giraffes, monkeys, goats, or donkeys, as the taste, the whim, or the desire of the age may demand. But let us pass over the details, and come to a name suitable for my glory. Alexander, in sooth, was styled the Great; Scipio was sur- named Africanus; and other great men have likewise been equally distinguished. If modesty permitted it, I would sug- gest that of Drowsianus, as both suitable, sonorous, and classic. Clodolphus, or rather Publius Clodolphus Drowsianus, would be verily majestic. It is true, I have no right to the prae nomen Publius; but a kite may have two tails if the owner pleases; and they who have the right to baste a name on one end, have the right to tack another on the other. So Publius Clodolphus Drowsianus it shall be. Verily, I like the name hugely. Publius Clodolphus Drowsianus! Just please, mas- ter lieutenant, repeat the same, for I fain would hear it from other lips." "My lord Publius Clodolphus Drowsianus," said the lieu- tenant, with his mouth half full of bread, "pass the mustard." "Very good," quoth my lord Clodolphus, huskily, for he was gnawing the drumstick of a chicken, and had forgotten to take it from his mouth; "very good. You may yet live in history as the first who saluted me by the title. Indeed, I wonder that Nature herself hath not recorded this victory, as it did when the first intelligence came to Rome of the renewal of hostilities by the Carthaginians. At Cumse, the orb of the sun grew small; in the land of Veliternum, the earth sank in great chasms, and trees were swallowed up (verily I should like to swallow some wine-thank you); at Arica, the forum and the shops around, at Frusing, a wall in several places, and a gate, was struck by lightning; in the Palatium, a shower of stones fell, and the Tiber so overflowed its banks-" "Not to change the subject," said the before-mentioned lieutenant, " what do you think of our chances, my lord?" "Not to change the subject!" repeated my lord Clodol- phus, staring. Verily, I think you have changed it, with a vengeance." "Perhaps I did," remarked the lieutenant. "But speak of the chances nevertheless. Rome is all very good in its way, but the present is infinitely more interesting."    <pb n="254-255" xml:id="VAC6560-00000136"/> "True," replied my lord Clodolphus. "Our chances, eh? Chances? Oh! yes. Well, you see it all depends upon what you mean by chances." "( I mean chances, when I say chances," explained the lieu- tenant. "Very likely," quoth my lord Clodolphus. "In sooth, chance is a queer kind of. a thing. You may chance to meet a wolf. If you do, he may chance to eat you. Again, chance may be regarded as fortune. Again, it may be looked upon as misfortune, although not always; because, if you should chance to secure a drink of something hot, spicy, and savory, verily you could hardly call it a misfortune-at least, I w"uld not- (I wonder if there is any to be had). Then, again, it may mean an opportunity; thus--" "A chance shot sometimes hits the mark," said one of the officers, handing my lord Clodolphus a cup of mulled port. "Verily you are right," replied the learned commander. "Lo! it is pleasing to my palate. I remember how the great author Tibullus-" The immortal thoughts of Tibullus were not divulged, for at this moment a messenger from Uphorn ordered my lord Clo- dolphus to repair to Bertrand on a secret mission, and leave the gorge in charge of his lieutenant; for the Duke feared lest that philosopher should impede the workmen employed in fortifying it, with learned and lengthy directions. What was the secret mission, will appear hereafter. Let us, meanwhile, return to Viot, and see what Godfroy is doing. He was awakened, this morning, by Rappenhammer. "There is a friend of yours below, waiting for you," said he. "A friend of mine?" exclaimed Godfroy. "What is his name?" "It is not a gentleman," replied Rappenhammer. "It is no less a person than your cousin, Lady Letitia." "Letitia here!" cried Godfroy. "Queen Mab is busy to- day. Why, I would as soon think of a hare making one of a party of hounds, as fancy Letitia coming, 'of her own accord, where fighting is going on." "I do not think you will wonder much," said Rappenham- mer, laughing, " when you know the reason why." "Do tell me," replied Godfroy, drying his face on a towel. "i I am quite curious to know." "I will not," answered Rappenhammer.  "Go on, and dress yourself."   JU+RnJAl WlJlnrM VAJX&amp;lS.      &amp;uzoo "I am doing it as fast as I can,' said Godfroy, who pur- sued his toilet then undisturbed until he was dressed, when they both descended to the apartment where the fair Letitia awaited him. She was accompanied by a young lady with eyes as black as coals, who was laughing merrily at something when the two gentlemen entered. "Why, Letitia 1" cried Godfroy; " what the deuce brought you here?" "You must ask Kate," answered Letitia. "And pray, who is Kate?" inquired Godfroy, laughing. "Kate Golightly, at your service," said the young lady with the coal-black eyes. "I thought we would surprise you; so I ordered the horses this morning, and, before Letitia knew where she was, whisked her off to Viot." "But the danger--" remonstrated Godfroy. "Danger!" replied Miss Kate. "I should have liked nothing better than a whole troop chasing me." "And we were frightened enough as it was," added Le- titia. "Frightened!" cried Kate.  "Not I.  A  certain Sir Christopher Weezy met us outside the walls, and told us we were prisoners. Letty certainly was alarmed, but I soon set- tled the matter. I rode up to old wrinkles. 'I will tell you what, my fine fellow,' said I; 'I want no liberties taken, do you understand? You touch us at your peril.' ' But I must bring both of you to Lord Godfroy of Rochateau,' said he. 'Just what we want,' said I; 'but let me see you behave properly, or I will know the reason why.' This tamed him a little, especially as all his men were on the broad grin. Then he began to compliment us, but I stopped that mighty quick, and told him a man of his age ought to be thinking of his grave, instead of running after the girls. The old fool I To think I was going to have him smirking at me before eight- and-twenty men, and handsome fellows at that." "May I ask you how you intend to return?" asked God- froy, laughing. "That is your business," answered Kate. "I think we have had quite enough trouble coming here." "And a nice time the general will have, with two such supernumeraries at his heels," said Rappenhammer. "I only wish Uphorn were here. I should like to see you and him together."    <pb n="256-257" xml:id="VAC6560-00000137"/> EiQV      VFi   Y I ai W s. 1'N  JJxIIfJbixO :   Oh I for mercy's sake, don't talk of the awful creature," cried Kate. "He is too much for flesh and blood. I met him once by accident, and I never want to see him again." "What did he do?" asked Godfroy. "I was laughing," began Kate, when Godfroy interrupted her. "I have no doubt you were," said he. "Laughjng, just as I caught his eye," continued Kate. "It sobered me in an instant, for I felt as if somebody had unex- pectedly thrown a pail of icewater over me. ' Who are you?' he asked, just as if I were a recruit, or a deserter, or anything odious in the shape of a rational biped; 'who are you?' 'Kate Golightly,' said I, quite nervous, and all trembling. With that he smiled-oh, so beautifully! You may depend upon it, that man has been unfortunate in love-and said, calmly, 'Well, Miss Kate, good-by,' and walked off. I ran away as fast as I could scamper, and I never want to see him again." "How would you like to be the Duchess of Uphorn?" asked Godfroy. "Not so great a fool as you take me to be," replied Kate, making a face. "How would you like to marry a princess of Timbuctoo? The two nuptials will be celebrated the same day.. Well! I shall not break my heart, and the Duke will not break his." ' But, really, you must be looked after," said Godfroy. "I should hope so," replied Kate. "Seriously, though," continued Godfroy, addressing his cousin; "seriously, Letty, when I left you at Rochateau, I never dreamed of your having so daring a companion. I do not know how to make you understand how very imprudently you have acted." "Let me try," said Kate. Then, turning to Letitia, and mimicking Godfroy to, perfec- tion, as he stood by showing his delight in every feature of his jolly face, she said: ' My dear child, you are the pink of per- fection, but rather soft withal. Nevertheless, if you had not fallen into bad company, you would have now been home suck- ing your thumbs, instead of here, where you are not wanted. I do not blame you, but that wicked woman who led you astray. So go away, and never do so again." "You will do," cried Godfroy. "If I ever marry, I shall certainly throw myself away on you." /   DREAMS WrrTH  DBREAM.      25 "Thank you for nothing," replied Kate, courtesying. "Well, as there is no shorter way of coming to the point," said Godfroy, I must inform you that Clovis Bertrand has been wounded--" "Not severely, I trust," cried Letitia. "Oh  a mere nothing," replied Godfroy. "He will be well soon, never fear that. The wound is only skin. deep, but it makes him feeble just now. But, as I was about to say, Clovis will proceed home this morning with an escort, and you two must accompany him. I think you girls will be paid suffi. ciently for your freak, by being short of dresses for the next fortnight." Are there any men about the premises?" inquired Kate. Plenty," replied Godfroy. "Why?" "Because," answered the young lady, "I will make them my slaves in ten minutes, and have my knights errant spurring to Rochateau for my wardrobe before the quarter of an hour is up. So, thank you once more for nothing." "Let your mind be easy," said Godfroy. "I myself will be your knight errant. Count Bertrand will be glad to see you, and will be very fond of you, I dare say." "I shall take care he is," said Kate. "And you are just the one to do it," replied Godfroy, slap- ping her heartily on the back. "or shame, cousin Godfroy!" cried Letitia. "You have made her color up." "Yes," added Kate; " but with anger." "No.! have I?" said Godfroy. "I do not believe it. I saw the young lady casting looks of admiration on me when I first entered the room, and I,am not conscious of having done anything since to lessen her regard." "If you call wonder admiration," retorted Kate extremely nettled, " I confess to the charge. I was wondering how much beef you usually consumed at a sitting. "You allow me, then, to be large enough?" said Godfroy. "If that will comfort you, yes," replied Kate; "but we cannot have little enough of some people." "' And strong enough?" added Godfroy. 'Ay, answered the saucy lady; '  but better strong brain and weak body, than weak brain and strong body." "And with a proper reputation?" pursued Godfroy. "Reputation, like dreams," replied Kate, "must sometimes be understood by contraries."    <pb n="258-259" xml:id="VAC6560-00000138"/> 258      DREAMS WITHN DREAMS. "Well," remarked Rappenhammer, " when you and Rocha- teau are married, I hope you will invite me to spend the honey- moon with you. I should like to see the sport, of all thngs." "When we are married, you shall," replied Kate. "And what have you to say to me?" asked Rappenham- mer. "Pardon me, my lord," replied Kate. "I trust you have not so slight an opinion of me, as to suppose I am ignorant of the respect due to age and honor. I only shoot my arrows at fools." "Meaning me," said Godfroy, with a grin. "Meaning you," answered Kate, with a courtesy. Rappenhammer looked at her, well pleased, and so did God- froy. "Under that crazy surface of yours lies a warm heart, my girl," thought the latter, as he went out to make arrange- ments for their departure. He'found Clovis already in his litter. "You are better already," he said to the young man. "Owen will go with you, and also two young ladies, who will prove pleasant com- panions for the Lady Nora." Who are they?" asked Clovis, languidly. "Oh! Letty, and a friend of hers," answered Godfroy, "who will pull the roof of the castle off, I suppose, before she has been there three days." "Is she insane, my lord?" asked Owen, horrified at the idea of such a companion to a sick man. "I really don't know," replied Godfroy, laughing. "If not acknowledging any respect to my dignity, beauty, and vir- tue be a proof of insanity, she is so certainly. You will find her, at any rate, crazy enough to suit you." "But it does not suit me at all," said Owen. "I earnestly hope the ladies will keep quiet." "If such be your wish," replied Godfroy,: "tell them your- self, for there is no use of my trying to speak to them seri- ously." "It must be done," said Owen, firmly; " and I will do it myself." "Well,vhere they are," replied Godfroy, as the young ladies appeared, escorted by Rappenhammer. Whereat Owen ac- costed them earnestly, and Godfroy watched him with a grin, anticipating sport; in which wish, however, he found himself mistaken; for Kate, as soon as she heard the physician's wish, gently acquiesced, turning a pitying eye on the invalid.   r,  *  DREAMS WITHN DREAMS.        259 "Confound the girl!" said Godfroy to himself. I never could understand what a woman was after." So thinking, he quietly approached Kate, who stood by her horse, and, without a "with your leave" or "by your leave," tossed her on the animal's back. The young lady looked neither surprised nor angry, but, nodding her thanks, laughed, and took the reins; sitting the horse with as much nonchalance as if she took it for granted no four-legged beast ever could have the better of her -which was precisely the case. So the escort started; Kate and Letitia, accompanied by Sir Peter de Steele, cantering briskly in front, and the rest fol lowing slowly after. "Now," thought Godfroy, as he stood gazing wistfully after them, "if ever a woman was born afraid of nothing, there she goes. How glad I am she has neither father, mother, sis- ter, nor brother, and is as poor as the deuce." Having given expression, so to speak, to this extraordinary remark, he sighed, then laughed, and so entered the hall. The escort arrived, at length, opposite Cecilia's cottage, where there was quite a little crowd listening to Claude; who, leaning on the gate, was favoring his friends with some particu lars of the last fight, which savored rather of the supernatural, but which were greedily swallowed by the admiring throng. Seeing the litter, Claude at once pushed his audience aside, and, walking up, asked Clovis how he felt? "  Better," replied Clovis, feebly. I   am glad to hear it," said Claude, kindly. Suddenly Clovis turned very pale. "Who is that child?" he asked. "Oh! that is Gertrude," answered Claude. "Come here little woman, and show yourself." "Some water! Quick!" cried Owen. Clovis had fainted. Claude ran to the well, and brought some water in his hat. In a few minutes Clovis returned to consciousness, when he -whispered to Claude': " As you love me, send Father Wilfrid to me at once." Claude nodded. The ladies, who had loitered a little, now cantered by, and the whole party soon disappeared. Claude hastened to the priest's house, ruminating as he went. "Now, was it only his sickness? " he kept asking himself as he went along, and he had not satisfied himself when he reached his destination.    <pb n="260-261" xml:id="VAC6560-00000139"/> -260      DREAMS WITHN DREAMS. Meanwhile, at Castle Bertrand, the Count was in a terrible state. He had had a skirmish with divers of the royal troops, who had escaped from Viot, and were dispersed throughout the whole country. Having repulsed them, he was very slightly wounded by a bullet in that part of the body where philosophers declare honor to be especially enthroned. Whereat he was exceeding wroth, for wounds in the back give rise to grievous suspicions. But no one alive ever accused the Count of any want of valor, that gentleman usually fighting, as he did everything else, without the slightest prudence or fore- thought; being known, on one occasion, actually to disperse an overwhelming force of men, by charging on seven hundred infantry with only twenty horsemen. Nor must this be attrib- uted to cowardice on the part of the superior force; since they naturally deemed the Count's troops to be only the vanguard of an immense army, from the confidence with which he charged. A panic ensuing, the reader can guess the rest; or, if he cannot, we refer him to the official account of the great battle of Bull Run. But to return. "To think," cried the master of Bertrand Castle, "to think of my receiving a bullet in the back, of all places I sha'n't be able to sit comfortably for a year." "And so there is to be a truce," said the Countess. "What do I care if there are forty truces?" rejoined the Count. "I am thinking of my back." "Tell me one thing," replied the Countess, "and I will talk of your back as much as you like." "Confound the woman!" cried the Count. "I do believe she is bent on setting me distracted. What are you talking about? I would not have the thing mentioned for worlds." "Well, then, I will never think of it again," said the old lady, if you will only tell me about the truce." "Never think of it again!" cried the Count. "Here is a pretty wife I Oh! here she is. Where are your connubial feelings? Where are your matrimonial sympathies? I sup- pose you would never think of it again, if I was devoured by wild lions." "Well, then," said the old lady, wishing to pacify him, "I will always think of how you were wounded." "Oh! I dare say you will," replied her husband. "A nice spouse you are, to be sure-to go and tell me to my face that I was running away." "You are as hard to drive as a pig," said the Countess.   DREAMS WITHN DRAMS.        26 "Tell me what you want. Shall I speak of your wound, or shall I not?" At this. the Count fidgeted in his chair, and muttered some- thing about true affection being instinctive, and requiring no assistance or advice. He then condescended to speak about the truce, informing his wife' that the capture of Treviot and Viot, the rout of Drowsie, the determined position of the no- bility outraged by the king's treachery, the firmness of parlia- ment, the generalship of Uphorn, and 'the fact that, if Alfred were beaten in a pitched battle, he would have no means of retreat, had forced the monarch to terms. "Then there will be no more fighting!" cried the Count- ess, joyfully. "No," said her husband. "Uphorn has moved so quickly, and has had matters so thoroughly organized, that the whole land was in arms in four-and-twenty hours after the bonfires were lighted." II And you and my boy are safe!" cried the Countess, rais- ing her eyes to heaven, and murmuring a blessing on God. "Clovis's wound is slight, and you have escaped unscathed." This remark awakened all the Count's ire. "Unscathed!" he cried; "unscathed!  Hear the woman!   Unscathed l And she with two goggle eyes staring at my wound  Un- scathed! *Why, I would rather have a bullet in each eye, and two in my stomach, than this scratch. Unscathed! The foul fiend fly away with the awkward fellow for not learning to shoot properly. I must sit on half a chair for the brief rem- nant of my miserable existence." "Oh! you will be well enough in a week," said his wife. "I don't care a snap if I am well enough in two," replied the Count. "What has that to do with the question?" "Well, don't look so stern," said the Countess. "Stern!" roared her husband. Leave the room, woman I You are malignant." "Here they are!" cried the old lady, joyfully jumping up, and rushing down to the courtyard, with the Count briskly limping after her. The meeting was tender. Clovis was very pale and lan- guid. He was immediately carried up to his room, where he was joined soon after by Father Wilfrid; although what passed between them, it would be premature now to publish. Letitia and Kate accompanied the Countess to Nora's apart- ment, and Sir Peter, together with the Count, repaired to the    <pb n="262-263" xml:id="VAC6560-00000140"/> J  a  .  ... teat room of statre, to imbibe generous wine-always the very Trst thing the worthy Count was wont to order when anybody ame to the castle.

GD " CIAPTER XXII. ]WHEREIN THE AUTHOR AIND HS FRIENDS MAKE SUNDRY WISE REMARKS. I  the thirteenth chapter of this most moral, most enter- taining, and most instructive history, I introduced the reader to several gentlemen of my acquaintance. Their opinions I trans- ferred to paper, at the risk of being accused of stealing my ideas, and for two reasons: first, I am above such clharges, and scorn such petty criticism too much; secondly, I know I do steal my ideas, and no blame to me either. It saves a world of trouble and vexation of spirit. Virgil stole from Homer, aud Thomson from Virgil.  Do you suppose people are going to bothler their heads about the lawful proprietors of ideas now- adays? I don't. When I read, my object is information, anwl I do not care much who originated the thought, as long as it suits me. Who does originate ideas?   Perhaps Adam  did, once upon a time, but I rather fancy we have not added much   "bU i^ijLY VVAtrnZIA J1JLAXJ LmLUV, I 4u to the stock for a considerable period. The adaptation, of known first principles to practical results suited to the necessi- ties or whims of the age, is about as much as we can lay claim to. There is not much new under the sun, after all. I have often spoken of Homer, a person who wrote some Greek poetry which was of considerable notoriety in its time. I intend to speak of him again, but at present I wish to con- fine myself to the Odyssey-a book not unknown to fame-and show one strong resemblance between the Prince of Poetry and myself, the Prince of Prose. If the profoundly classic reader recollects the thirteenth book of that epic, he will re- member how very much troubled the commentators are by the strange conduct of the Phmeacians to Ulysses. As, however, some of the readers may not call to mind the particulars, they will excuse my giving an abridged account of the manceuvre. The son of Laertes, after presenting himself in rather an unbecoming costume to the Princess Nausicaa, daughter of Al- cinous, king of Phleacia (the man did not have a stitch of clothes on in that celebrated interview), is accommodated by that lady with wearing apparel, and proceeds to the palace, where he sees Queen Arete; who very naturally wants to know where he got those clothes? Indeed, she delicately inti- mates that she half suspects him of having unlawfully come into possession of the same; a suspicion not wholly unwar- ranted under the circumstances; for when a man stalks into your house dressed in your own daughter's petticoats, you are naturally curious to know what the deuce is up. The man of many woes vindicates himself nobly from the implied charge of petty larceny; and, among other things, says (according to Pope) to the Queen, when speaking of the Prin- cess : "To her I sued. She pitied my distress, Like thee in beauty, nor in virtue less." A very nice sentiment, but, unfortunately, Homer never said it. This is the only fault I find with the translation. The words, "Like thee," etc., are manufactured out of whole cloth, by our esteemed friend, Alexander P.; he, no doubt, settling it quite to his own satisfaction that Ulysses would have said it if he had thought of it-the remark that a lady is young enough to be her own daughter being always pleasing to ladies who have daughters grown up. I say nothing, of course, of less rhyming with distress, which would settle the matter by itself. Ulysses is then hospitably received, and, after partaking a    <pb n="264-265" xml:id="VAC6560-00000141"/> hearty supper, relates his adventures with a brazen effrontery which would appear entirely out of character, if we did not remember he was a hero. For heroes must perform every- thing better than any one else; and, as Ulysses was not only a hero, but a travelling one, his lies must, of course, surpass those of common wayfarers. And he certainly uses his privi- lege to a huge extent. We must form a very low opinion of iIng Alcinous's understanding, and a very high one of his cre- dulity, when we are officially informed by Homer that Minerva herself advised her-favorite Greek to gammon his royal host so outrageously. Alcinous, swallowing every lie as readily as fish ever gob- bled up bait, next rather raises himself in our estimation by giving the son of Laertes a Roland for his Oliver, in the shape of an assertion, which, to do him justice, is as great an outrage on truth as any related by divine Ulysses himself, touching cer- tain ships then in his possession, which beat the steamships of these degenerate days all to pieces; having the valuable prop- erty of intelligence, or some other such probable accomplish- ment unusual to craft generally. So the much-enduring man is whisked off to Ithaca while he is asleep, and left, still snoring, on the beach by the Phaeacian sailors, who then start for home. If Pheacia be the same island, as some aver, now known as Corfu, Homer might as well have allowed the spouse of Penelope to make the voyage like a decent pagan, and take it coolly. From this we infer that either the author had not studied Malte-Brun (a not improbable thing), or else made up his mind, since he meant to sell the book, to give as many fibs for twopence as he could. Now the commentators of the Odyssey, for reasons I could never fathom, are greatly perplexed by this desertion. First of all, why in thunder does he sleep? Why not? Ulysses was naturally drowsy. All wise men are. I am myself. I have always admired this little trait in the father of Telemachus. I hate your pious iEneas, and am always uncommonly irritated when the fellow coolly writes on his card, "I am the pious IEneas," and wish he was at the bot- tom of the sea with Lycus, and the brave Gyas, and the brave Cloanthus.             , So our Ithacan hero is laid sleeping on his native shore, and the Phaeacians sail off without saying "good-by." Why do the Phasacians sail off without saying "good-by?" So ask the commentators.   I--*}.V4L^&amp;V ,AA VKAMSN. D6EAS I don't want to be dictatorial, or to force anybody to hold my opinions, who do not want to; but it seems to me, when you read a book, you ought to take. it for what it is. Homer either wrote the truth, or he did not. As I do not believe, myself, in the existence of Circe, Calypso, Polyphemus, the Syrens, and numberless other gentlemen and ladies who appear in the epic, I am inclined to regard the Odyssey as not true in other words, as a fiction. Now what under the sun is the use of asking why people who never existed performed acts which never occurred? Reasons can be found as plenty as blackberries, if a body wants them. Perhaps the Phaacians were seasick and did not feel like conversing. Perhaps they were drunk, and did not think of it till too late. Perhaps-- but why continue? Now I promised to show how I was like Homer. I have my commentators, who are continually worrying me with just such questions; and, as I am naturlly merciful, besides being the weakest of the party, I have never followed the first promptings of wrath urging me to punch their heads. The Codger is 'the first of this worshipful company; a young gentleman who has conceived a great passion for dogs, and who possesses five very mangy mongrels, which he swears are of the purest breed. One of those infernal curs has scratched a hole underthe fence, where he lies in wait for un- wary travellers, whose heels he seizes as they pass, much to their terror-especially' if they be nervous old ladies. The Codger resembles this particular cur, as he lies in wait for me, and pounces on my work at unexpected times, much to my annoyance. My tow-headed cousin stands second in the critical 'ank. He is a goodnatured, burly fellow, to whom I owe many a debt of gratitude for protecting me, when a boy, from the wrath- of my playmates. Cheesy (so called from the love he bears that article when in an offensive condition) is one of those men you occasionally come across, who always go by contraries. There was a Gnos- tic sect, in the second century, called the Cainites, whose calen. dar presented the extraordinary patrons Saint Cain, Saint Esanu, Saint Judas Iscariot, and the martyrs of Sodom and GWmorrah. Now Cheesy is not prepared, perhaps, to go as far as this, but he has nevertheless a contradictory way of landing everything history condemns, and vice versa. He is not convinced Nero was a tyrant; has his suspicions that Robespierre was an' ill- 12    <pb n="266-267" xml:id="VAC6560-00000142"/> 266       DREAMS  VITEIN DIEAMS. used man; defies us to prove Voltaire no Catholic; does not see that the rape of Lucretia has not its extenuating circum- stances; and has not as yet made up his mind on the right eth- ical view of the slave trade, piracy, assassination, and modern polygamy. Cheesy is perhaps as good a specimen of the dis- tinction between theory and practice, as anybody would be likely to meet with on a summer's day. However strongly he expresses himself, his actions are strictly honorable, and his kindness unimpeachable. The candid friend makes up the four, and-his name shows his character. These are the commentators who are my Plu- tarchs, Quintilians, Spitzlers, Thierslches, Bekkers, and Eus- tathiuses. I had just finished what I may fairly call the first part of Dreams Within Dreams, when the whole company opened upon me. "Good for the little cuss!" cried my tow-headed cousin. "But impudent," added my candid friend. "Oh! of course," said my tow-headed cousin. "It is the nature of the beast." "Who knows nothing of dogs," remarked the Codger. "And still less of men," summed up Cheesy. "Ah," said the Codger, "I think you jump too much. You leave us with the first return of Piquemont, and then lug in a little girl. Then you fly to a conspiracy, and then to war. You never prepare us for what is to come. While we expect Clovis and Nora to be hero and heroine, we suddenly find Up- horn and Gertrude usurp their places." "If you will allow me," I replied, urbanely, as authors are wont to do when criticized, " you will see that, whatever my imperfections, I am not guilty of that. Not to compare myself with the immortal bard of Avon--" "-I should think not," said my tow-headed cousin. "Not to compare myself with the immortal bard of Avon," I continued, ignoring the existence of the obnoxious cousin, "may I not still say that Othello is open to the same objec- tion? We travel from Venice to Cyprus, when there is no apparent necessity--I mean, of course, dramatic necessity. Now, I gave hints enough of what was to come, in the inter- view between Father Wilfrid and Curma la Chambre; to say nothing of various trifling incidents scattered here and there-- all which bear upon the main plot, around which all will be found ultimately to group themselves. Again-"   DREAWS WITHN DREAMS.        2ff7 "Oh, lor!" cried Cheesy.          "Again," I continued, inexorably, "again, do Romeo and Juliet meet as lovers in the first act? I trust I may humbly follow the footsteps of the gentle Shakspeare, and use him as young artists do the great masters." it True," replied the Codger; " but it is not always safe to copy. As to your idea of Othello, do you know what Doctor Johnson says on the subject? ' Had the scene' (he writes) opened in Cyprus, and the preceding incidents been occasion- ally related, there had been little wanting to a drama of the most exact and scrupulous regularity.' As for Romeo and Juliet, I do not think you have made out your case at all. We are prepared for their love in the first act-nay, the title of the play is enough. The misdirected passion of Romeo for Rosa- line admirably shows a loving disposition dike that of Prince Ahmed al Kamel in Irving's Pilgrim of Love), seeking -what it has not yet found--a reciprocated affection." "I tell you what, Codger," said my tow-headed cousin, the little man is right, and you are wrong. In Dreamland, we must know all about'the characters from the author, as we never heard of them before. But I say, Ulric, you are in deep water on the love question. It is very easy to criticize, and quite right to ridicule false sentiment; but leave poetry alone. Caricature, or rather exaggeration, is the Muse's province, whether tragic, comic, satiric, or amatory. In verse, love that is not ultra is tame." "I don't know that," said I. "Take Hood's Bridge of Sighs, and compare it with Chaucer's nonsense. The first is the sad lamentation of nature, the other the miserable hypoc- risy of art." "You are talking heresy, little man," said my tow-headed cousin. "Criticism may call it heresy," I replied, "1but nature stamps my   opinion as orthodox" "In your own opinion," remarked my  candid friend. "In the opinion of every sensible person,"-I replied. "Whew!" cried my candid friend, "Ah," I   continued, "you may say what you like. If people used to go courting their sweethearts-" "What a   vulgar expression! " cried the Codger. "Court-. ing their sweethearts, indeed I  ' And what should I  say? " I asked.

"What  adoration?" "Adoration," said Cheesy, sententiously, "taken in the ise you require, means profound reverence, or homage, paid one in high esteem." "And homage?"I continued. "Homage," said Cheesy, "in the same sense, means devout ection." "Then I should like to know how much of that coin is id into the treasury of Cupid?"I inquired. "Men run er women-" "Don't say 'men run after women,"' interrupted the idger. "Say--" "Get out 1"I replied, testily. "If we go on this way, will never reach the end. Let me alone, will you?

"Don't say 'a long chalk,'" cried the Codger. "Let me go on reading," I replied. CHAPTER XXIII. JIRATINO HOW THE PROFESSOR HAD AN INTERVIEW WITH A MYSTERIOUS STRANGER, AND HOW DIVERS PLEASANT OCCUR- RENCES HAPPENED AT THE CASTLE. AND now all was hubbub at Castle Bertrand. Every room is occupied. As we have said, my lord Clodolpkhs had come. r Claude de Viot (much to Cecilia's gratification) was invited. r Wolfgang had come; likewise Godfroy, Rappenhanmmer, r Christopher Weezy, and Sir Peter de Steele. Hollar and ax were free. Adolphe and Hans were on parole.  Of urse, Piquemont and his daughter were there, together with ate and Letitia. And the Duke was coming. Rochateau was also filled with officers, while eight thousand Idiers encamped between the two castles. There was much   DREAMS WIrrTI  DREAMS.       269 coming and going, hunting, and what not; for, between the Count and Godfroy, moments were not likely to be wasted Picnics. dancing, music, theatrical representations, riding excur- sions, visits to the old ruins, in fine, everything to while away time, was set in motion. Sewell had so much work on hand, he did not know where to begin. Shuttle was cock number two of his village, coming next after Claude. Ernest had quite a thriving trade. Ebenezer fbrgot his sore head for so long a time, that his friends began to hope le had forgotten it treat him, and was consequently half drunk all the time, except at night, when hhe was entirely so. Coffin alone reaped little profit from the throng; but even he could at least eye the host with the look of a disdainful prophet, and know that many of them might require a gravedigger before long. And that, too, was a comfort. And now we have reached a point in our narrative where we hardly know whether we will be believed or not. Yet, even before the catastrophe hereafter to be recorded, there were not a few who already whispered a, strange story round the country; the which we feel obliged to narrate. It has always seemed to me that there is a peculiarity about all supernatural tales which no others possess. If I should re- turn from a distant land, and announce that I had witnessed some extraordinary phenomenon, I should at least be patiently heard, if not believed, especially if I had any claim to reputa- tion as a scientific man. Yet, let a dozen honest persons, capa. ble and' clearsighted, depone to certain supernatural manifesta. tions, straightway they are condemned, without a hearing. This I believe to be occasioned by two causes. First, we supernrtural manifestationse o be fully received; since ma'  people, if once really convinced of even one solitary such in- stance, would give thenselves up to false alarms and frightful illusions. We are too weak to cope with the supernatural, as a race. Hence there is a doubt almost always thrown over these cases which preserves mankind in a sound and healthy state of mind. As the story goes, one night the old Professor was return- ing from a solitary ramble. The moon was high in the heav- ens, and silvered the whole landscape far and near. Suddenly 4c    <pb n="270-271" xml:id="VAC6560-00000144"/> 2 T0      DREAMS WITHN DREAM\.S. he was aware that he was not alone. As he afterward con- fessed himself, although there was nothing remarkable about the person's appearance who now joined him, still he felt an indescribable awe in his presence. Upon after consideration, he came to the conclusion that it was some poor man whose mind was unbalanced. Others, however, disagreed with him, especially after the terrible catastrophe occurred which this mysterious personage had predicted. "I have come to speak to you," said the stranger, as the other turned his head. "To me?' repeated the Professor. "Why, what can you have to say to me?" "You have a child under your charge,"' answered the other. "She will not be long with you; or, rather, you will not be long with her. Yet fear not. She is born to high sta- tion, and the hour comes which shall restore her to her rights." "Who are you?" inquired the Professor, not a little puz- zled by the matter and manner of this address. "Ask me not," replied the other,' "who I am, nor yet what I am, whence I come, or whither I go. Believe in what I say; or, if you believe it not now, believe it hereafter." The Professor looked compassionately at his companion, supposing, as I said before, that he had lost his mind. Think- ing it, therefore, advisable to change the subject of conversa- tion, he pointed out Uphorn's camp, which was plainly to be seen in the moonlight, stretched along the plain. "A fine view," he said, carelessly. "Fine!" repeated the other, sadly. "Can an old man like ' you call it fine? Do you remember the tears of Xerxes? Of all these men, now reposing in the pride of health and courage, where may many be when a few moons shall have rolled through the constellations of heaven? Where must they all be before a century has swept into the future?" "Indeed, you speak truly," said the Professor, sorrowfully. "Ay, and tritely. Why not?  Truth is older than the sun. She has plead with man from the beginning. She spoke when the Chaldeans watched the evening star setting on the plains of Assyria. She uttered her voice thousands of years before, when the sun rose brightly from behind the purple hills of Eden. She will be still speaking when the last sun sets, and its last sickly ray falls feebly on the corpse of the last man. But she is trite, friend, nevertheless." How can truth be trite?"   DREAMS WITINH DREAMS.       '271 "Anything is trite which has lost its novelty and interest. You may object to my definition. I care not. Or you may say my definition itself is trite. I care not. The sun has not less its daily lesson, because we see it every day. Is a truth often spoken less true than one rarely uttered.? The world is falling into second childhood-soothed by flattery--vexed by trifles. As the statue of Mennon greeted the break of day with mournful music, so the monuments of the past chant a funeral dirge over the advent of each sun. Truth has spoken from the beginning, yet, miserable mortal, lool there! Man is as eager to butcher man as he was in the days of Cain." "Yet has the world progressed." "In what? Man's mind is busy. Now it labors in one direction, now in another. Now it raises colossal monuments on the Nile, which bid defiance to the elements, and withstand the undermining of' centuries. :Now, on the banks of the Euphrates, it bricks in an enormous city with Titan walls, which Providence allowed to increase in strength. so that God might the more plainly show mian his folly in contending with Heaven. Now it extends its iron sceptre oyer a world, and its eagles are planted over empires and generations. 'Now it erects castles on every rock, and establishes nuclei for coming monarchies. Now it turns to science, and weighls the heavens, and the earth, and all that in them is. But it is the same spirit always, worldly, selfish, cruel, diabolical. Scorn it, and it over- powers you. ' Resist it, and it crushes you. Denounce it, and it crucifies you." "And what do you call progress?" "Do you ask for information, for the sake of argument, or only for amusement?" "Why?" "Because, if you ask for information, I will tell you; if for the sake of argument, I never argue; if for amusement, I have done with you." "I ask to hear your mind." "Properly answered. Progress, then, as far as man is con. cerned, is only advance in virtue; for man can only be said truly to progress in that for which he was created." "And that is?" "To save his sou." There was a pause after this, which was first broken by the Professor. "Yet," said he, mildly, "may there not be an infe. nor progress of the intellect, based on experience?"    <pb n="272-273" xml:id="VAC6560-00000145"/> 272       DREFAMS wrrtIN DREAMS. "There may," replied the other; " but it is the progress of him who, having to remain in a certain country but a short time, tries to make his temporary sojourn as comfortable as pos- sible. If he be called to high honors in another land, the lesser progress (so to call it) would be totally eclipsed by the higher progress-to wit, the fitting himself for the high office he was called upon to fill." "Continue," said the Professor. "Intellect is like the body-a servant to the soul, a thing more or less perfect, more or less to be cultivated, and nothing more.. It is, like our senses, more or less capable of adminis- tering pleasure. Man is no more responsible for his under- standing, than for his personal attractions or strength of limb. Both are instruments, but mere instruments." "Friend, I will think on what you have said." "It is well. But this is not for what I came. Ask me not who I am, nor yet what I am, but attend to me. God has favored your kindness to the orphan, and will reward it-but not here. Fear not for yourself, neither for the child. Put your house in order, and prepare for whatever may come to pass." And, with these words, the stranger stood still. The Pro- fessor gazed on him perplexed, for he knew not what to make of him. As they thus confronted each other, a clarion sounded in the camp. The Professor turned his head, and, when he looked back, the stranger was gone. Meantime, there was quite a gathering at Castle Bertrand. The next day was appointed for the'grand fete.. The Duke would arrive in the morning, and there was to be quite a day of it. Everybody was gay and pleased, and there was a crowd of people, a hum of voices, the pleasant sound of merry laugh- ter, and all that kind of thing. The Count was quite in his element, bustling about to his heart's content. Gabriel and Samuel and Peter, and the rest of the servants, were ordered to keep sober, under the penalty of instant execution if disobe- dient. All the officers who could get off duty were there, and already there was quite a congregation of ladies, old, young, pretty and plain; for the Count had scoured the country round far and near, and had filled the whole castle with anything in the shape of a petticoat he could find, provided the s id thing in the said shape had any pretensions to being of noble blood. In fine, Picluemont was evidently to be reinstated with as much uproar as Count Bertrand could produce--that being the non   DREAMS WITHTN DREAMS.        273 plus ultra of anything noisy. There was no end to dancing, and flirting, and carrying on of all description. At about mid. night, the Count had the great doors thrown open, and there was a supper good enough for a king. For, no matter how re- fined people's notions are, no matter how delicate their flirta- tions, no matter how politely they converse in the drawing room, oysters and sandwiches, to say nothing of punch, are not amiss at a social gathering. My voice is all for suppers. Now, not being an antiquarian, I am somewhat at a loss to know what provisions to give my company. I could hunt it up, no doubt, but I am 'too lazy. So we will just take for granted that the good people ate whatever was commonly eaten in the seventeenth century, and drank ditto. And in this way of treating the subject, I am the more confirmed out of compassion to myself and some of my dear readers; for, to some people, it is an act of the greatest cruelty to talk of any. thing to eat, unless they can get at it at once. Now, I have already described one scene of inebriation, and some say it is a literary fault to give two representations of the same thing in the same work. Yet what am I to do? I must tell all, or nothing. Homer has given us mbre than one fight in his Iliad. Nonsense! The truth is, the gentlemen became what I have good rea- son to believe is called " boozy " by the lower classes. In old. times, a little of this booziness was not regarded as so great- a sin as it is nowadays. And this must be our friends' excuse. What a strange witch is alcohol! Say, Muse, why should it make the Count so boisterously friendly with everybody? Why should he gratuitously inform his guests that he was not drunk, when nobody said he was? Why should it cause my lord Clodolphus (who was a good son) once more to feel re- morse about his conduct to his poor old mother?  Why should it give Sir Wolfgang the baseless impression that he was left alone to buffet with a heartless world? Why should it cause Sir Christopher Weezy to defy Sir Peter de Steele to mortal combat for no particular reason alleged? Why should it infect my lord Rappenhammer with a great desire to dance?  Why should it induce Godfroy to volunteer one of the most atrocious attempts at a song, ever hateful to human ears?  Say, Muse I since it is thy business to answer the questions of authors. * 5' Mumming," quoth my lord Clodolphus, "is derived from HMumme, a Danish word, and the practice is supposed to have arisen from  the Sigillaria, or days added to the ancient Satur- 12'    <pb n="274-275" xml:id="VAC6560-00000146"/> lia. Tlhs, at Christmas, the English verily had one of se; in the which appeared divers heroes, such as Old Father ristmas, the noble Mynce Pye, St. George, the. Doctor, and ;tle Jack the Saucy Dwarf, with dolls on his back. This imming would be, in sooth, attended by trumpets, sackbuts, i shalms. My poor mother verily did love mumming, yet I, r son, had the heart to forget it." "Ah," said the Count, " you are my friend, old cock, and I yours. I tell you so. Upon my word, it is the truth, old Low. I am not in the slightest degree tipsy, I assure you. it you must allow me to say you talk a great deal of non- ise sometimes. Upon my word, you do. Yet, never mind. e laws of hospitality are sacred. Hurrah! Let us be ly." "If such be the case," said Sir Christopher, darkly, "tell It Peter de Steele to stop outraging me. Tell him so, Count, blood will be shed-blood!" "Nay," replied my lord Clodolphus.  "Has he not a ther? You would not wring her heart?" '"No," answered Sir Christopher, "but I will wring his se. I will wring his nose, as sure as I am a knight." "Nay, rather," said Rappenhammer, "let us have a ace." "Or a good song," suggested Godfroy. Sir Wolfgang said nothing. He felt lonely. Why should raise his voice in mirth among strangers? The tears )pped heavily down his cheeks, and he groaned. "I tell you," said Sir Christopher, ' that nothing but the ath of one or both of us can satisfy my wrath-nothing." "Why, what the devil is the matter with you?" asked Sit ter. "Caitiff " thundered the other; " caitiff, draw!" "I propose," said one of the officers, winking at another, hat we proceed en regle. Both Sir Christopher and Sir Peter ist withdraw, pledging their words of honor that nothing )re shall be done until we settle what course they should rsue." "Very well," said Sir Christopher, majestically. "I leave F honor, gentlemen, in your hands." And, with a fierce look Sir Peter, he quitted the banquet hall, and joined the ladies. "You must do the same," said the officer to Sir Peter. "What the deuce is it all about?" asked that gentleman, wildered.    *                 *'.       - 1.'* t .

"Now," said the officer to the gentleman he winked at previously, "one half these men are far from being sober. Let us form a committee, and de- bate on the code of honor." The other, delighted, assented at once, and soon a council was called, composed of Hollar, Sir Wolfgang, my lord Clo- dolphus, the Count, Rappenhammer, Godfroy, and the two officers. "Gentlemen," said the proposer of the committee (and who was unanimously voted into the cliair), when they were all seated, "gentlemen, a grave question is now laid before us. One of our fellow guests complains that another has insulted him; while the other assures us he never intended so to do, and is very sorry for the misconception. The question is, shall the apology be accepted, or must there be a combat?" Said my lord Clodolphus: "A writer, not unknown to lit- erary fame, called Shakspearc, hath happily touched upon these matters (more fully discussed in the book on 'Honor and Hon- orable Quarrels,' by one Vincentio Saviolo), in a play called 'As You Like It' (and I like it welD; wherein he verily doth make one of his characters, a clown yclept Touchstone, give mouth to the following effect: 'I did dislike the cut of a cer- tain courtier's beard. He sent me word, if I said his beard was not cut well, he was in the mind it was: this is called the retort courteous. If I send him word again, it was not well cut, he would send me word he cut it to please himself: this is called the quip modest. If again, it was not well cut, he dis- abled my judgment: this is called the reply churlish. If again, it was not well cut, he would say, I lie: this is called the countercheck quarrelsome: and so the lie circumstantial, and the lie direct.' Now, the question to be propounded is, whether Sir Peter verily hath given any or all of these replies. For, unless I be grossly mistaken, this matter, verily, must be first determined." "I think," said the Count, who sat gravely at the council table, with. his eyes half shut and his body oscillating witl. a seesaw motion, "I think that the whole consists in the one idea-' May we ne'er want a friend, nor a bottle to give him.'. What's the use of quarrelling, when we have plenty to drink? Not that I'm drunk, gentlemen-only merry, I assure you.    <pb n="276-277" xml:id="VAC6560-00000147"/> 276      nDREAMS WITHN DREAMS. Glodolphus is a wise man-a very wise man--but he is a fool sometimes. Gentlemen, let us have no fighting, and plenty of drinking. Hurrah, gentlemen!" "I agree with Bertrand," quoth my lord Clodolphus, groan- ing. "There is nothing so holy as to prevent crime. Would that I had done so in my youth. My mother would have been happy. Yea, let us not permit these hot-heads to smite each other even to death." "Ye-es," hiccoughed the Count. "Let us be jolly, old folio." "Oh!" cried Sir Wolfgang, "this is laudable. Oh, my friends! ye are indeed happy in your affections. Hear the wailings of one who is friendless, and let not the kindred of these two sweet gentlemen deplore their untimely end. A song, very applicable to this, will I now sing. It is called 'The Knight Everhard ' " "Verily, but you don't sing that song while I am alive," cried my lord Clodolphus. "It is worse than an emetic." "Yes,' said the Count, "worse than ipecac- oh! who the devil could get the infernal word out?" "Ipecacuanha," quoth my lord Clodolphus, "otherwise known, in sooth, as Cephaelis Ipecacuanha." Sir Wolfgang shed tears. The Count was melted. "You shall never be without a friend," said he, "nor without one who has a bottle to give you. Beloved Wolfgang, will you have a drink? I assure you I am thirsty-not drunk, but thirsty." "So am I," replied Sir Wolfgang, sobbing. With that, the two rose, and left the committee. "Will you have the kindness to take your feet off my lap?" asked my lord Rappenhammer of my lord Clodolphus. "With alacrity," quoth my lord Clodolphus, doing so. "I thought you were an ottoman, my dear friend. Verily the room gyrates exceeding. I think I will retire." And he did so. "The council of war is fast dispersing," said the officer to Godfroy, as Rappenhammer fell heavily under the table. "Where is Hollar?" "; Here I am," said a faint voice, and that gentleman was seen leaning out of the window with a pale face. He probably had become enamored of the fine prospect, and wished to study the effects of light and shade by moonlight.   DRiEAMS WITHN DREA M.       2t7 "You and I, then," said' Godfroy to the officer, "must go and report to Christopher and De Steele." With that, both proceeded on their mission of love. The reconciliation was grave and formal. The next morning Weezy only remembered the occurrence in some indistinct misgivings that either he had insulted somebody, or somebody had insulted him. As for the performance of some of the other gentlemen of the party, we will give them in few words. The Count reentered the room of state, and wasted the remainder of the night in a futile attempt to induce the Countess to dance a jig. Sir Wolfgang offered himself to no less than four young ladies, one after the other, whom he had never seen before in his life, and, on being refused, shed tears. Hollar danced a minuet with one of his fair acquaintances; which dance ended rather abruptly, by that young gentleman's losing his balance in trying to make a graceful bow, and but- ting his head into his partner's stomach; whom he overthrew, falling heavily on her. My lord Clodolphus amused himself, for the rest of the evening, with sitting uncomfortably close to anybody he could find on a sofa, and staring at him or her silently, with an ex- pression of drunken stupefaction. The conduct of Rappenhammer was the most eccentric. If the reader remembers, that noble fell under the supper table, where we left him in quiet. Recovering after a little, he took off his coat for the purpose of dusting the same, and put it on again, after he had shaken it a little. Unluckily, being in a half dreamy state, he put it on upside down; and in that novel costume, with his hair all in disorder, he walked inco the dancing room, smiling sickly, and asking round whether anybody had seen his nightgown, for his stomach was out of order, and he wanted to go to bed. He was quickly hurried offlhand locked up in his room; where he immediately began beating at the door, and screaming to get out. The company broke up at last, and anticipation ruled the dreams of all respecting the entertainments of the morrow.    <pb n="278-279" xml:id="VAC6560-00000148"/> 278      DREAMS WITHN DREAMS. CHAPTER XXIV HOW GODFROY RELATED A CURIOUS STORY, IN THE PARK, TO CERTAIN OF THE ACTORS IN THS MELODRAMA. NOEA, LETITIA, and KATE rose early the next morning, to enjoy a stroll in the park before breakfast. Accident, I sup- pose, led Clovis, Hollar, and Godfroy to join them, the whole party pairing off at once: Clovis and Nora, Godfroy and Kate, Hollar and Letitia falling into ranks with the ease of disci- plined soldiers. And what, indeed, was more natural? Of course, Clovis joined Nora, and equally of course, Godfroy could not pair off with his own cousin, when a strange young lady was present. So, out of comnon politeness, he joined black eyes. Hollar, therefore, offered his arm genteelly to Letitia. And it was all good breeding, and urbanity, and courtesy, and suavity. And the dog Romulus was there, be- having as dogs are wont to do. And the deer and the birds seemed to be much of the same opinion of the six as they for- inerly were of Clovis and Nora. But birds and deer do not know everything, after all. Nora and Clovis had a great deal to say, for the wedding day was near. Whereat Godfroy remarked he quite envied them; in the which observation Hollar assenting joined. Kate said nothing, although she seemed in unusual spirits to- day. Letty embraced Nora, and Hollar slapped Clovis on the back. And here I pause a moment to be philosophical. A kiss and a slap are two very extraordinary manceuvres. When a woman kisses another, it may be because she loves her, and it may be because she don't. So with slaps between men. As Bunsby says, "The bearing of this observation lies in the application of it." "Ah," said Clovis, "love is delightful, except the act of declaring yourself. Then you go round and round, as you did, Hollar, in the riding school." Godfroy, who had not heard the story, inquired about it; which adventure Hollar lhimself related with a great deal of humor.  Godfroy absolutely shouted with laughter, as he leaned against a tree, and the others laughed more at seeing Godfroy enjoy himself, than they did at the adventure itself.   DREAMS WITHN DREAMS.       279 "By Jove " said Godfroy; "I should like to have seen you. You must have been somewhat puzzled." "Truly I was," replied Hollar. "I began seriously to think the devil was playing his tricks with us. But Hans was more bothered than I was. It is strange I never thought of the truth." "Not at all," said Clovis. "Walking without the aid of light, is tough work for one who is unaccustomed to it. Put any man but a blind man in the dark, with the firm conviction that he is outdoors, and touching a known part of a castle's wall, and the chances are a thousand to one he would be troubled as you were. And this would be more likely, should he be in your situation; his fears of discovery excited by the circumstances of his position." "Yes," added Godfroy; "I once had to walk to Toser. vem's by night, and found, when I reached there, that, although I had walked fast, I had taken more time than usual, even when I walked slowly. Coming to think the matter over, and to ask myself the reason why, I began to put this and that together, and determined to try again before I came to a con- clusion. Repeated experiments showed me, that those little inequalities of the ground, which appear nothing by daylight, cause us to stumble by night. Hence we walk more carefully and more slowly, although we appear to hurry." Thus chatting, the blissful half-a-dozen strolled on, until they reached a part of the park where the Count had, with hid own hands, erected a rustic seat, so artistically placed as to command the only prospect in the vicinity not worth looking at. The young ladies seated themselves, when the bench im- mediately collapsed, landing them on the ground with a bump. As no one was hurt, only laughter emerged from the accident; Kate observing, after the first merriment was over, that it was an ill wiid which blew nobody good, and suggesting that the broken seat should be turned round, so that they might contem- plate a landscape worth seeing. This was accordingly done. The ladies took their new position, and the gentlemen took pos- session of a prostrated tree which lay conveniently near. "Come, now," said Nora to Godfroy, when they were all placed, "' you promised to tell me about that pretty little child you found so strangely. I am quite curious, and I am sure we will all feel quite interested." "That I will readily," answered Godfroy, " especially as a rest after our ramble will be good for Clovis, who looks quite pale."    <pb n="280-281" xml:id="VAC6560-00000149"/> 280       DREAMS WITHN DRY'AMS.  "Oh! it is nothing," replied Clovis, to an anxious look from Nora. "Pray do tell us your adventure." At that, Godfroy related the following story: "I hardly know whether the fact that so much, accidental interest, born of whatever cause, rests around the mere history of a child, will not strike you, as I confess it has me, as some- thing approaching the improbable. Indeed, who has not known something in life, something which he himself has experienced, and which is so wonderful that he dared not relate it lest the world should impeach his veracity? "I was travelling on a secret mission, when I chanced to come across a poor hovel in the neighboring forest. Now a hovel is no uncommon object anywhere, and therefore I was not very much surprised at meeting one on my way; but what did surprise me, was the unaccountable effect the sight of it pro- duced upon me. A strange coldness thrilled through me, and I felt one of those attacks of terror which sometimes come upon as unawares, and without any apparent cause. "So far from being a materialist, I have been accused by my friends of superstition; yet I can truly say that I am guilty of neither extreme. When a phenomenon presents itself hav- ing some claim to the preternatural, I hold that we should neither reject nor accept it too readily; but, keeping our judg- ment in abeyance, first ascertain whether such phenomenon did occur or no: and, having decided in the affirmative, next seek the cause-in nature, ifrpossible; out of it, if necessary. "In this particular case I was certainly frightened, and frightened by something I did not comprehend. I have always held, that a man without fear is an impossibility; but as fear without a cause is equally so, the business of the sensible man is to discover and remove the cause, if he can. I set therefore to work to study the hovel and its neighborhood; to discover, if possible, the occasion of my present discomfiture. "' The hut was built on low, marshy ground, against two. oaks which had been blasted by lightning. The roof was cov- ered with moss and fungi, and sheltered a number of lizards, toads, and snails. Brambles and briers, and a spectral kind of white flower grew thickly round under the shade of the pine trees, whose almost black branches hid the greater part of the sky, and through whose dark leaves the moon peered coldly down. A deathke stillness reigned over the spot, and one would have supposed the place deserted, had it not been for the smoke which curled up from the roof through a hole. Such was the general appearance of the hovel.   DREAMS WITHN DIEAMS.        281 "I had reined in my horse, and remained thus struggling with this undefinable fear, which seemed to be striving to gain the mastery over me. I do not know how you will regard me, when I tell you I was unsuccessful. But I must speak the truth. "I laughed at myself, but my laughter was forced. I felt a sensation of awe creeping over me, as I have experienced when a boy, while my nurse was telling me some ghost story. I looked round again. 'By Jove! old fellow,' said I to my- self, 'I will find out the mystery before I am an hour older.' "With that, I tied up my horse, and knocked at the door. It opened readily, and I entered. A woman was lying on a  v bed at the other end, with a little child seated near her. I turned to see who had opened the door. Nobody was there. I must have knocked it open. "The child never stirred, but kept her large eyes on me as I advanced. The woman looked at me with a wild stare, and then motioned me to sit down; which I did, the child vacating her chair for me, and retiring to a corner, where she sat down very quietly on the floor. "'You have come at last,' were the woman's first words. "Did you expect me?' was my reply. "'I expected some one,' said she. 'God Almighty knows aid is needed here. Here,' she continued, fiercely, ' in this abode of fiends, some messenger was needed to save that un- protected child. I wish to speak to you, whoever you are. But you must not urge me. My strength is failing, and I can only say a little at a time.' "I bowed, for (as you can easily imagine) I began to be greatly interested in the adventure. She sank back, as if cl- lecting strength to speak. I waited patiently, and at leih she began: "' I have lived here,' said she, 'for a long while-for years-and have gone through with that which I truly believe mortal never experienced before, and lived to tell. Have you noticed nothing dreadful about this place?' "'Since you ask me, I have,' said I. "She shuddered. 'So many say,' she continued. 'What is it?' she whispered. 'No spectre appears, no strange sounds are heard, no ghostly touch affrights you;. yet there it is, nevertheless-a horror, intangible, all-devouring, all-petri- fying.' "'You were not born to this, said I, almost involuntarily; for I saw she was educated and refined.    <pb n="282-283" xml:id="VAC6560-00000150"/> 282       DREAMS WITHN DREAMS. "' You are not the first who has said so,' she replied. "'If this place,' urged I, ' be so terrible, why do you not quit it? The child, should not be subject to so unwholesome an atmosphere.' For I now really began to be persuaded that some exhalation from the marsh affected the health, and conse- quently the spirits of those there by night. "' Unwholesome!' she repeated. ' Ah, you do not distin- guish between the occasion and the cause. Heat occasions water to boil, but the cause of boiling lies as much in the water as the fire.' "I looked puzzled, but she continued, without regarding me: ' 'The cause' said she, 'of this horror, is not in the un- wholesomeness of the air, but il something deeper. That child is never affected. Let any one come here, who would deny her a home to-morrow if she were destitute, and they would experience nothing. But let any one enter this hut, or even pass by it, who would assist her, and these terrors steal upon them. They have driven away all her humble friends but myself, and they are now killing me.' ' But,' I replied, wishing to humor the poor soul, 'if such be the case, why have you not removed your residence? You could not find a worse place, and might have found a better.' ' I have not moved,' she replied, 'because I have com- mitted crime, and he who persecutes me, assaults me more ter- ribly elsewhere. I am chained here until I die.' "'And what crime have you committed?' I asked. "'The unpardonable sin,' she answered. "'My good woman,' said I, cheerfully, 'you must not talk so. The unpardonable sin only becomes so if persisted in to the last. While there is life, there is hope. The holy sacra- ment of penance absolves every sin'to the truly contrite.' "She raised herself up in bed. 'It is a lie I' she cried. 'I tried to save her from him. When I could not, I arraigned God himself, and swore His justice should grant me salvation in spite of the past, since my wrongs demanded this recom- pense. Talk no more of penance. I will have neither priest nor sacrainent, but enter eternity as I am.' "'Come,' said I, 'I do not like to hear you speak so, even in the excitement of fever. Take a more hopeful view.' "She coldly passed over my remarks as if they had never been offered. 'I am glad you have come,' she said. 'I would have been glad had it been any other; for the child must be   DREAMS WITHN DREAMS.        283 removed, and removed instantly, or I cannot answer for her life. Listen to me. I am an outcast from hope, but my natu- ral affections are strong. Until lately, although I have been harsh, I have been sufficiently tender of her to preserve her health and peace, although she is greatly afraid of me. But since I became a-' "A what? ' I asked. "'Since I killed,' she replied, fixing her eyes on mine, and looking like a tigress, ' since I murdered her mother, if you will know all, I have never been the same woman. When I first came here, and experienced the terrors of this forest, I fled the place. But all other spots were worse, and I was forced to return. Gertrude was not affected by them, so I let things remain as they were. As I told you, those who inter ested themselves in the child were troubled, and so they gradu- ally, one by one, abandoned us. They could not remain, I knew very well. "'So things lasted,' she continued, after a short pause, 'until last night, about twelve. I am always awakened at mid- night by, I know not what. I rose in my bed. Gertrude lay sleeping on her little pallet by the fire. I knew something was working within me. At first I hardly distinguished it from the usual fears I experience here by day and by night. Gradually it assumed a frightful character. Something, which seemed to possess me, was urging me to arise and kill the child. I Wres- tled with the fiend, but he was too strong for me. I rose, and approached her, battling all the way with my invisible enemy. He forced me on. I reached the child's bed, knelt by her, and clutched her throat. I still struggled, and even so much as to writhe, as if I were wrestling with a material foe. In this fight I upset a heavy log which leaned against the wall. It fell, and struck me senseless. When I came to consciousness, it was broad day. I rose, and went to my bed (for I felt faint), and here I have lain ever since.' i' Upon my word,' said I, when the woman finished speak- ing, 'upon my word, I agree with you, my good woman. The child shall not remain under your care an hour longer. You are not a safe guardian.' "As I said this, she rose, cried in a terrible voice, 'This is the second death!' and fell back a corpse. "Paralyzed by her sudden death, I stood perfectly motion- less, when I was aroused by the trampling of horses. I ran to the door. It was Claude, and some of his men. ' Come here,    <pb n="284-285" xml:id="VAC6560-00000151"/> 284      DREAMS WITHN DREAMS. for God's sake!' I cried. At which he reined in his horse, dismounted, and hastened to me. I explained briefly the whole matter, and said I wished to remove the child at once. As I had merely mentioned the facts, I was astonished to see how uncommonly agitated Claude became at the intelligence. He said nothing at first, however, but- called one of his men, and gave him a rather long order; after which the soldier mounted, and galloped off. "'Now, my lord, I will explain what order I gave, and why I gave it,' said Claude, when he returned. 'I have sent to the Benedictine monastery. You must know how the good fathers have been accused of intolerance and bigotry, and, con- sequently, how they are obliged to act with more than common prudence. They have long interfered to protect this miserable woman from the peasantry-for strange rumors have gone abroad about her. I have been long commissioned to report her death at the convent as soon as I might know it, so that the fathers may remove the body, and bury it privately. I must wait here until their bearers return-which cannot, at most, be more than half an hour-for I have sworn to burn this cursed hovel down as soon as the old witch died.' "And what is your reason?' I inquired. "' You will hardly believe me,? said he; 'nevertheless, I will tell you. A young girl to whom I am betrothed took compassion on this little girl, and used to visit this hut occa- sionally; for (she said) it was hard to see so delicate a flower pining in this noisome marsh. While she was here, she has often told me herself she was terrified half out of her wits by a nameless dread which came over her as soon as she crossed the threshold. I tried to dissuade her from coming, but she always put me off with some such excuse as "t Wait till next time"-"I will try once more "-"The child surely is worth one more trial," or something to such effect. One day I had accompanied her here (for you may be sure, after all she told me, I never trusted her to come alone). I waited outside, as usual. As I was walking up and down, I heard Cecilia scream. I rushed to the door. I threw myself with all my force against it, and burst it open. I found Cecilia lying on the ground, with the old hag grinning and mouthing over her. I flew to my betrothed, ani raised her up. "Oh, Claude!" she cried, "take me away. Do not touch the woman-do not think of her-think of me-of me."  I never gave the hag a thought. My whole attention was given to Cecilia. When, afterward, I   DREAMS WITHN DREAMS.        285 would question her on what had happened, I saw she was so terrified whenever I alluded even to the subject, that I never had the heart to pursue it.' " "How very strange!" said Hollar, when Godfroy reached this period of his story. "In half an hour," cpntinued Godfroy, " the fathers came, and took the corpse away. When they were gone, Claude lifted the child on a horse before one of his men, and bade him ride on with the rest to a certain spot, and there await our com- ing. When they were gone, we first led our own horses back a little in the forest, and then returned to fire the hut. The flames rose very fast-much faster than I had expected. When the whole building was wrapped in fire, a strange thing happened. The hovel presented the aspect of a vast pyramid of flame, surmounted by a cloud of smoke, which, instead of rising upward, seemed condensed into a thick black ball. Sud- denly-very suddenly-the flame separated into a thousand different fiery tongues, resembling serpents, writhing and twist- ing, perpendicularly, horizontally, obliquely, upward, down- ward, blue, white, violet, green, red, and yellow. Then the whole hut fell in, and a pitchy darkness followed. The fire went out instantaneously. I never saw such a conflagration extinguished in so short a period of time; if, indeed, you can call the duration of a lightning flash, a period. So the fire went out, and so darkness succeeded." Here Godfroy paused. "And is that all?" asked Clovis. "There is little more to tell," answered the other. "Claude and I silently betook ourselves to our horses, mounted them, followed, and reached our men; where Claude, at my request, ordered them to repair to Rochateau, and accompanied me to Toservem's. There the worthy man who is the child's pres- ent guardian first took charge of her." "A strange story," said Hollar. "Strange!" echoed Nora.   "I think it very disagree- able." "Nonsense!" cried Kate.  "It has the true smack of. sorcery, especially that part about killing the child." "That, indeed," observed Hollar, gravely, " savors rather of the diabolical. Such instances are not uncommon in the annals of demonism." "And do you really believe the devil can force a person to murder?" asked Kate. "My dear young lady," replied Godfroy, "be sure he can.    <pb n="286-287" xml:id="VAC6560-00000152"/> Many who disbelieve in his power, and regard the occult sci- ences as only natural mysteries, are drawn into evil by little and little. No really good man would ever waste his time in trying to rival the Gospel miracles. His instinct would tell hiim Yuch were a fruitless, wicked task, and any (false) science promising as much, was illusory and diabolical. Hence he would instinctively be repelled from the study."    ! "And pray," said Kate, "will you tell your dear younllg lady (many thanks for the title) how Satan goes to work with such men?" "My dear young lady," replied Godfiroy, " for I shall con- tinue to call you so, since you insist upon the title--" "But I assure you I do not," interrupted Kate. "Oh! I beg your pardon. I thought you said you did," answered Godfroy. "You know very well what I meant," said Kate. "And you know very well what I meant," replied God- froy, laughing. "Come, Kate," said Letitia; "let us hear Godfroy's an- swer.7 "Well, Letty," said Godfroy, "I will try to satisfy you. If we are to believe Satan has any power over man, on whom could he exercise it better than on those who work themselves up to believe they are going to achieve preternatural things? They become nervous and fanciful. ]Now a fanciful-nervous state 'of body and mind is peculiarly adapted for illusions, and the devil's wonders are illusions. A mind who deserts faith, is strengthened in its desertion by these apparent evidences, and is led farther and farther. Thus Satan at last reduces him to such a state, that he is not only deceived himself, but actually becomes a medium for deceiving others, disposed, like himself, to tamper with unearthly things. Diseased, finally, in body and mind, the dabbler in black arts communicates this conta- gion to all who are susceptible of infection. He takes, as it were, the devil's place. Having acquired a kind of juggler's knack (what I call chemical illusions), he performs apparent prodigies, to the destruction of weak souls. If God did not set a limit to this, the human race would be irretrievably lost. But I really think we must stop here-we may keep the company waiting."  So saying, he offered his arm to Kate, and the whole party returned to the castle.   DREAMS WITHN DREAMS.        287 CHAPTER      XXV., E0OWING HOW GODFROY ENTERTAINED THE COMPANY AT ROCHA- TEAU, AND HOW MY LORD CLODOLPHUS DID VERILY SEE A THNG OR TWO. WHEN I first wrote this vastly entertaining story, I entered largely into the details of Piquemont's military reception; but, according to the good advice of my esteemed friend and critic Cheesy, I altered my intention, and passed the thing over. The dear reader must therefore fancy all this, and join the little procession, as they left the camp and proceeded toward Rochateau. To any spectator, the company would have presented quite a pretty sight. The noble horses, rich costumes, bright arms, glad faces, the mixture of gold, silver, steel, satin, velvet, plumes, jewels, and embroidery, made them appear really daz- zling as the rays of the sun played on them. Everybody was in high spirits; and, although the pace was a walk, there was no slowness about it. You may be sure the village was all alive.  Every window was crowded with spectators, and, when the tail of the last horse was seen, every house poured forth a thronhtof persons, who followed the procession all the way to Rochateau. There was one exception to the general mirth. and that was the unfortunate Hollar, who had been consigned by malignant fortune to the tender mercies of my lord Clodolphus. The young man earnestly wished his noble companion to the devil, not only because he bored him to death, but also because he wanted to ride by the side of the fair Letitia. "Verily," quoth my lord Clodolphus, " posterity seems equally divided as to whether Homer was born in seventeen different places at once (which, in sooth, seems improbable), or was never born at all-the which I opine to be going rather to. the other extreme." "Oh, indeed I " murmured Hollar. Said my   lord Clodolphus: "Yes. The whole matter is easily understood. It lies thus: First, there never-was such a person as Homer.   Secondly, there was. Thirdly, it, is doubt- ful." "What are you talking about?" asked Sir Wolfgang, rid.    <pb n="288-289" xml:id="VAC6560-00000153"/> OD I' DREAMJS      % ITHiN DRl4 AliS. ing up, in very pity of the victim. Whereat Hollar, blessing his stars, abruptly left his tormentor. "According to Herodotus (who never wrote it), my dear young friend," quoth my lord Clodolphus to Sir Wolfgang, "Homer was born in Smyrna (see Cicero, pro Archia, cap. 8); whence that poet is called Melesigenes, from the river Meles, which, to use a conventional term, washes the walls of that city. All I can say, is, that, if it does, it is verily the only washing Smyrna gets the whole year round; for it is one of the dirtiest holes in the Turkish empire. There have been divers opinions as to whether such a person as Homer ever ex- isted at all. The existence of his works, indeed, is assumed for the sake of argument, seeing that the world is not as yet prepared to deny the existence of a book which is in every- body's library. The result of all their trouble is, to rouse as many different opinions as there are persons employed in the conjecture; and, as antiquity gives Homer seventeen distinct places and four distinct centuries to be born in, we ought verily to be please4-at the clear light thrown upon this interesting subject." "Ah," said Lord Snore, riding up, " how are you, Clodol- phus? You gave my kinsman Drowsie a pretty good drub- bing the other day, and served the fool right." "Potztausend!" cried the valorous Bolero Schneider- knocken, if but the Von Kabeljaus behaved nobly in that assault." f Verily they did," replied my lord Clodolphus, dryly. "In the heat of the battle, Maximilian Alpdrficken caught the brothels Von Kabeljau, with their cousin Delamorue, drunk behind a haystack. A nice mess, in sooth, we would have made of the whole business, had it not been for Traum. Verily, Schneiderknocken, you better drop the Von Kabel- jaus. They are parvenus of the worst stamp. Old Gregory Von Eabeljau made a fortune by the American fisheries, and bought the barony of Morue; but 'money does not make nobil- ity, I trow. Like a poet, a peer is born, not made." "Potztausend!" cried Schneiderknocken; " and from what sprang the first of the race?" "If you mean Adam--" replied my lord Clodolphus, ' What's up?" asked the Count, joining them. "I asked Clodolphus a question, and he answers by begin- ning with-Adam," growled Schneiderknocken. "Well, that's a mercy," answered the Count; " lie don't   DREAMS WITHN DREAMS.        289 generally begin so late in history. You don't know the man, I see. Why, he would quote Caesar on the scaffold, cap verses with the executioner, and talk till the axe fell." "So I would," quoth my lord C]odolphus. "I would be myself till I died." "What's the matter with you to-day?" asked the Count. "How could you be anybody but yourself?" "I might be beside myself," said my lord Clodolphus. "Beside the -devil!" cried the Count, impatiently. "But hold your tongue now, if you please, for we haven't ridden three miles to hear you talk, and here is Godfiroy's fellow." Godfroy had prepared a reception for Piquemont somewhat like the one Sir Walter Scott represents the Earl of Leicester to have given Queen Elizabeth at Kenilworth. Unfortunately, however, Letitia was at Bertrand, and Godfroy was thrown on his own resources, which were not fertile. The consequence was, as we shall see, everything went wrong. In the first place, Godfroy had intended that a man, dressed as the Wild Huntsman, should stand as porter, and recite a piece of poetry, composed by the Professor, welcoming Pique- mont as an old friend whom he (the Huntsman) had lately pro- tected in the forest. The idea was not bad in the abstract, but, unfortunately, Jonathan Sewell, the tailor, was chosen for that post; for which he was about as fit as a cow would be to dance the Mazurka. I do not think the less of a man for being fat; but I do say, nevertheless, that a gentleman measuring five feet round the waist is not the best person to represent the Wild Huntsman, especially if he have round -eyes, fat cheeks, and no perceptible nose. Besides, Jonathan bulged out too much behind.   He also had arrived, somenow or another, at the conclusion that all he had to do was to repeat the lines, and have the thing over at once. Which he proceeded to do in a sing-song voice, with his hands in his breeches pockets; when he walked off presenting a  back view of broad propor- tions, rather uncommon to fiends. -oweyer, there was plenty of music from the walls; and that would have been something, if the drums had not been drunk, and raised such a noise as to drown everything else. On the bridge a  new form appeared, intended to represent the Sleeping Beauty; who was allegorically supposed to be a type of Piquemont's estate waiting for a prince (Uphorn) to break the spell. This idea, likewise, would have been good enough, had a pretty woman been chosen to act the part; but 13     <pb n="290-291" xml:id="VAC6560-00000154"/> 290      DREAMS WITHN DREAMS. what must they do but choose a man, and what man, of all others, must they hit upon but our friend Smaragdus?' He looked so ludicrous as the Sleeping Beauty, that those muscles which gentle Nature has given us for the purpose of contract- ing in jocund mirth, were severely tried as to the spectators assembled, and twitched considerably; especially when the name of the allegory was gravely and formally announced by Ebenezer, as Cupid. Good breeding achieves wonders, and order was kept, when Ebenezer, from a lofty flour barrel, thus addressed the noble throng; while they, meanwhile, assembled, stood like a flock of the golden age, whose wool has learned to counterfeit vari- ous colors, now the sweetly blushing purple, now with yellow dye and crimson spontaneously clothing the feeding lambs. "Cupid am I," said he; "Cupid, the baby god of Love, watching over innocent Beauty-" Here Smaragdus opened his bullet eyes, and stared stolidly at the spectators, much to Godfroy's indignation, who cried out, "Shut those lobster goggles of yours at once, sir." The Sleeping Beauty obeyed. At this moment the god of Love, incautiously advancing a step, lost his balance, and trod on the stomach of the Beauty; who collapsed, and uttered an execration. A pair of decidedly dumpy legs kicked vigorously in the air, while Cupid, being upset, rolled ignominiously on the ground. At this the gravity of the company was upset. Uphorn even joined in the general mirth, and Godfroy cut short the mumming, being of the opin- ion that his genius did not lie in that direction. Cupid and the Beauty scampered off; Ernest Toservem, who was to have acted the part of Apollo, and Solomon Coffin, who was to have represented a Naiad, found they had taken much pains for noth- ing; and the whole party entered, laughing, the castle, whither they were led by their hospitable host, who, although at first somewhat discomfited, ended by laughing at the whole thing as heartily as the rest. They then all assembled in the park to discuss a magnificent banquet. Godfroy had prepared a pas. toral performance, but learning, on inquiry, that the Chief Shepherdess had the toothache, and that, as substitute for the Queen of May, they had dressed Leander up in her garments, he thought it best to omit that part of the ceremony. So they made up for it by eating and drinking, laughing, flirting, dan. cing, and complimenting, until it was time to return. And so ended the great festival at Rochateau. Godfroy,   DREAMS WITrIN DREAMS.        291 however, was consoled for his disappointment, by every one assuring him that the failure was better than any success could have been, and imparted quite a novel delight to the entertain- ment.- As he saw this was the unfeigned and unanimous opin- ion, and as, moreover, Kate had laughed until she positively -cried, he soon regained his spirits, and entered heartily into the humor of the day. During the ride back to Bertrand, nothing was spoken of but the great performance. My lord Clodol- phus especially was heard learnedly showing how the unex- pected is one of the elements of success; quoting, in proof thereof, from miscellaneous authorities, such as Justin Martyr, Serra di Falco, Francisco de Brito, Pausanias, Lycophron, and others: one saying about as much on the subject as another. At which the Count replied, by observing he did not believe a word of all that trash, any more than when he (my lord C.) quoted Saint Austin. At which my lord Clodolphus replied, "Augustine." At which the Count retorted, "Austin." And so they joyously reached Castle Bertrand, where sundry bon- fires were lighted, as twilight already had set in. ; The company had retired to prepare for the ball, and there was divers putting on and casting off of linen habiliments, not to be mentioned to ears polite. At the end of-a couple of hours, Clovis met Nora on the landing, and had a chat with her for a minute or so. The space of time represented by the word " so " was perhaps somewhat more than sixty seconds, rigorously understood-but then, lovers never know the value. of moments. Hence, they had conversed for a period which a practical man of business would call half an hour in his mer- cantile way, when a door behind them suddenly opened, and the Duke of Uphorn appeared. He was as calm as usual, but smiled as he observed the two. They lowered their eyes, as if they had been doing something very wrong; while Nora red- dened like a rose, and Clovis like a peony. The Duke's eyes rested first on Nora, then on Clovis. We mentioned, in a pre- ceding chapter, that Uphorn had coldly scanned that young man's face; but his thoughts then were occupied with the great events of the day. He now, therefore, virtually saw Clovis for the first time. At first he stood quietly looking at him with an amused ex- pression, a half smile lighting up his stern, handsome counte- nance. There was something absolutely fascinating in Uphorn when he smiled, if for no other reason, for the tender melan- choly he displayed, and which was so unexpected in so haughty    <pb n="292-293" xml:id="VAC6560-00000155"/> 292      DREAMS WITHN DREAMS. a man. Kate was not unreasonable in her conjecture. Any one who ever saw this smile, would have felt that some sad event had shed its influence over his character-some sorrow- fil, gentle influence, as beautiful and as mournful as a mother's grief at the loss of her child. As Uphorn looked at Clovis, a change came over his face -a strange, puzzled, wobegone expression. He raised his hand mechanically to his head, as if to aid him recall some- thing he had forgotten. Suddenly he strode forward, laid his hands upon tie young man's shoulders, and scanned his fea- tures narrowly. "No," he muttered, "I must be dreaming. How old are, you?" "Twenty-seven," replied Clovis, amazed.. I thought so," said Uphorn. "It could not be." Then he turned to Nora. "And you are to be married soon?" said he. "My child, your father has been more than a friend to me. God bless you both." And, with these words, he turned the same strange, puzzled look toward Clovis, and, hastily bidding them adieu, reentered his room. "Hallo!" quoth my lord Clodolphus, coming down. "Verily is there love going on hugely in this establishment. I just left a pair of turtledoves on the landing upstairs, and lo I I find two on the landing downstairs. Now, what says Hor- ace? 'Ficta voluptatis causa sint proxima veris;' which, being translated, is, Pleasurable fiction should be enrobed in the likeness of truth. And, again, Juvenal hath it, 'Nullum numen abest si sit prudentia;' which may be paraphrased in the vernacular thus, Be prudent, and hang the gods. And in this, truly, I am decidedly of the satirist's opinion; as I verily hold the ancient gods were celestial humbugs, and little better than ambrosial corsairs. But, to come back to our subject (by the by, put me in mind, at a convenient opportunity, to give you my ideas on corsairs), and talk of lovers. Verily did I see two up stairs. One, I assure ye, was a man, and the other a woman."  Whereat wise looked my lord Clodolphus. "Very likely," observed Clovis, smiling at the oddness of the idea. Said my lord Clodolphus: I don't mene that. I mean that one, verily, was a woman, and the other a man." "I do not see the alteration is for the better," remarked Nora. "Possibly not," quoth my lord Clodolphus, complacently;   -DREEAMS WITHN DREAMS.       293 "and I do not see how either you or my esteemed frienid Clovis will ever understand me, unless you deign to hear me out." "I beg your pardon," said Clovis. Said my lord Clodolphus: "Oh I no offence, I assure you. Both of you are young and hasty. I was once young myself. Of course, when there are lovers, one must be a man, one a woman; but it is always well to be correct in stating facts. You can never be too particular. Verily, when you are as old as I am--that is, as I am now; for you could never be my equal in years, if we both lived ever so many centuries-but when you arrive at my present mature and discreet age, you, in sooth, will fully understand that you can never be too cor- rect in stating facts. For what saith Tacitus? 'Specious names are lent to cover vices-Nomina honesta praetenduntur vitiis.' Beware of false glossings. But to come back to our subject, and talk of the lovers I saw up stairs." "Who were they?" asked Nora. "Lovers," replied my lord Clodolphus. "Yes, I know that," said Nora; "but what were their names? Do tell me, my lord, for I am very curious." Said my lord Clodolphus: "Names are not always to be relied upon. They are not always the most proper channels for conveying ideas. I might give you false names, which would lead you to a very erroneous conclusion. Again, I might give the first name correctly, and the second incorrectly; which would have the selfsame effect. Again, I might give the first name incorrectly, and the second correctly, with the same result." "Does not this mean," asked Nora, timidly, "that you might tell me something which is not true?" "Precisely," quoth my lord Clodolphus. "I am glad to see you follow me." "But suppose you don't tell me any such thing?" sug- gested Nora. "That is, as yet, wide of the subject," said my lord Clo- dolphus. "T We must look at the matter from every side. Take a cheese, for example. It has a rind which is unwhole- some, and an inside which is savory, albeit at times wormy. Bite I one side? It is rank. Bite I the other? It is delec- table. Verily is it so with conversation. We must look at it first, and so learn wherein (allegorically) to fix our teeth. So,    <pb n="294-295" xml:id="VAC6560-00000156"/> 291      DRTEAMS WITHN DREAMS. to come back to our subject, and talk of the lovers I saw up stairs." "Well," said Clovis, "who were they? For I cannot think of any other way of putting the question." "And a very good way it is," quoth my lord Clodolphus. "There is nothing like coming straight to the point. It is what I always do myself, as everybody knows, except your respectable father, who verily is slow of belief. If I remem- ber aright, Ovid makes use of the word venenatus (or poison- ous), in speaking of a certain kind of talk. Now I never would poison my friends' ears with circumlocution. No, no. And thus we naturally come back to the lovers I saw up stairs." At this moment, Hollar and Letitia came down, looking very sheepish. My lord Clodolphus grinned; Nora and Clovis laughed: then Nora walked up to Letty, and Clovis walked up to Hollar; then Nora kissed Letty, and Clovis winked at Hollar. Which mystical ceremony performed, silence ensued awhile. "Aha!" said Clovis at last to my lord Clodolphus, whose intelligent features were wrinkled up into a broad grin, " aha! we have found out your secret, before you found time to tell it "Verily," quoth my lord Clodolphus, "these are not the two." At this moment, down came Kate and Godfroy, looking as if butter would not melt in their mouths. My lord Clodolphus thereat did chuckle; whereat Clovis did understand, and did wink at Godfroy even as before he did wink at Hollar: whereat Nora was put to the necessity of smiling at Kate; the which she did roguishly. At this Godfroy did verily laugh, and his fair companion looked as unconcerned as you please, albeit a little red withal. And the seven did then descend, the young ladies tittering by the way. And divers pokes in-the ribs did pass between my lord Clodolphus, Godfroy, Hollar, and Clo- vis; which whoso listeth may understand.   DREAMS WITHN DREAMS.        295 CHAPTER XXYI. HOW THE GREAT BALL BEGAN, WHAT INCIDENTS MARKED IT, AND HOW IT ENDED. AND were there not mighty preparations for the great ball? The Countess, who was determined that there should be no repetition of the yestere'en's inebriation, if she could help it, had arranged a new way of presenting the supper (so to speak), which shall hereafter be described in its proper place. And there was a platform erected, with a seat on it for Pique- mont, and another for the Duke. And there was another, high up, for the m'usic. And, in short, everything was perfection. Now all the servants, of course, were in requisition. Ga- briel, having received his orders from the Countess, had set diligently to work, and the rest hurried blithely about. After everything was arranged, it came to pass that Peter and Samuel unlawfully stole in to look at the room before the company should enter; for this had been strictly forbidden by the Count, as he had great fear lest some of them should awk- wardly upset something. "So this was where you see the ghost?" said Peter to Samuel. ' This was where I see it," said Samuel to Peter. "And what do you think of it now?" asked Peter of Samuel. "I don't know," answered Samuel to Peter. "Lor I was so scared, you might have poked your finger into my eye up to the knuckle, and I never could have moved an inch." "Bless my soul!" ejaculated Peter, looking at Samuel. "I guess it was 'bless my soul!" replied Samuel, looking at Peter. "I guess, if you see that blessed spectre, you would want to say your prayers; which I don't believe you trouble yourself much about generally." "What do you mean, Samuel?" asked Peter, majestically. "You use big words, but you are like a witch; you try to raise hell, and break things: but you forget that when a body raises the devil, he gets chawed occasional." This was said with a grand air, for Peter tried to copy the bearing of the Duke of Uphorn.    <pb n="296-297" xml:id="VAC6560-00000157"/> 296       DREiAMS WITHN DREAMS. "You get out!" said Samuel. "Mayn't a fellow talk, without a fellow getting mad? You keep still, will you?" "Samuel," replied Peter, solemnly, "when one man of honor speaks to another man of honor, he must not give him sarce; or it may happen that one man of honor gets his head awfully punched by another man of honor." So saying, Peter drew himself superbly up, a la Uphorn, and looked daggers at Samuel. But men should not draw themselves up without calculating chances. Above Peter was a bracket, and on the bracket stood a silver candlestick. Peter drawing himself up to full height, his head came in contact with the bracket, and upset the candlestick with a crash. At the same moment the voice of the Count was heard outside, much to their consternation. "What shall I do?" cried Peter, appalled, and quite for- getting his dignity. "Hide the thing!" cried Samuel, who was equally terri- fied. '"Hide it anywhere, if you don't want your head bit off. It is bad enough we are here without leave-but don't let him see that thing on the floor."' And now the Count's voice came nearer and nearer. In his fear, Peter lost all presence of mind, and, hastily taking up the candlestick, crawled under the two chairs we have already described as destined for Piquemont and Uphorn. As he did so, the Count entered, and immediately began to storm at Samuel for being there : whereat that servant sneaked off, and the Count remained, pacing up and down the room. In a few moments the Countess joined him, followed almost immediately by Nora, Letitia, Kate, Clovis, Godfroy, Hollar, and my lord Clodolphus. Others now began rapidly to enter by twos and threes, and so poor Peter found his hopes of escape growing every instant fainter and fainter. By and by they were all assembled. The rainbow alone contains the colors there displayed, and only Dreariland could furnish such feathers and jewels. Ostrich plumes eighteen yards long; diamonds as large as cobble stones; no end of rubies, emeralds, and all that kind of thing. And there blazed the lords and ladies of Fableland. There were our lady hero- ines, all charms and loveliness. There were our particular heroes, all gallantry and feathers. There was Weezy, all' smiles and wrinkles; Rappenhammer, witty and dignified; De Steele, inspecting the spoons; Schneiderknockeii, like a feather bed on legs. There thronged the Niebelungens, the Vander   '\  DREAMS   IT'HN DREAMS.      297 Utopias, the Von Kabeljaus (their crest is a codfish salient), the Delamorues, the Alpdruckens, etc. There stalked Lord Snore, following a huge nose like a bowsprit. There, in fine, was the creme de la creme of Dreamland. And there was a buzz of many voices, the clink of many spurs, the bowing of mally heads, and the blowing of many noses. Piquemont had been received with a flourish of trumpets. The Duke, who was to join the company later in the evening, remained in his rooh, receiving and despatching couriers, writ- ing and answering letters, and occasionally even accompanying some especially important messenger to the terrace; where the two could be seen walking up and down in earnest conversa- tion: at the end of which, the courier would leap on his horse and gallop fast away. As this was to be expected, nobody was astonished, and the evening festival went on merrily. "Ah," said our old ac- quaintance Adolphe to my lord Clodolphus, " not a bad idea of a prison, upon my word! If jails are all like this one, really I should not object to being a prisoner for life. It really is re- freshing to be in good company, and have no trouble about ex- pense, and all that. By Jove! that is a pretty girl, mv lord. Who is she?" I' That," replied my lord Clodolphus, ' is Susan de Tom. son; rather poor, but proud, and verily of a great family. Of course you have heard of the De Tomsons? You must have heard of them." "Yes," said Adolphe, languidly. "They are connected with the De Jaxons and the De Ouilsons, are they not?" "Precisely," quoth my lord Clodolphus. "They are verily connected with them thus: About a century ago, three brothers came to Dreamland; one was called Sir Charles, the other Sir William, and the last Sir John. Charles had issue, to wit, Charles, Ellen, who married one of the De Jaxons, and Mary Ann, who espoused a Ouilson. This De Ouilson was youngest son of the Archduke of Katzenjammer; whose principality was subsequently divided into three kingdoms of five miles square each; to wit, Katzenjammer Frihstfick, Katzenjammer Abendbrod, and Katzenjammer Mittagsessen.   A great deal of eating, verily, goes on in these realms. But, to come back to Sir- Charles. He used to say that, out of a son .and two daughters, he had contrived to have three male heirs; for he was now father to a Tom-son, a Jax-son, and a Ouil-son. He I      13:  '    <pb n="298-299" xml:id="VAC6560-00000158"/> 298      DREAMS WITHN DREAMS. was, in sooth, a witty man; indeed, so witty he sometimes quite bored you, I hear, with his play upon words." "And what," remarked Sir Christopher Weezy, in another part of the room, to Rappenhammer, " what do you think of that?" "Do you mean the young people?" asked Rappenham- mer, seeing that his companion's eyes were disdainfully turned toward Godfroy and Kate. "I think it very natural. Some- thing may come out of it. It will be a great thing for the girl. She has nothing. Confess, now, yourself, they will not prove a bad or unsuitable couple." "My opinion is," replied Weezy, sourly, "that Rochateau is a fool. We don't do things so in Transylvania. When is young Bertrand and Lady Nora's marriage to come off?" "Next month," said Rappenhammer.  "I suppose you have nothing to object there; for everything is equal on both sides?  "Yes, I have," snarled Weezy. "Piquemont is actually throwing his daughter away. Why, she might marry a prince, if she chose. We don't do things so in Transylvania." "Then," replied Rappenhammer, placidly, " you must cer- tainly do things in Transylvania very different from what is done in every other quarter of the globe." "Good evening, Rappenhammer," said Godfroy, cheerily, as he walked up. "Fine time. I suppose you are too old to dance? But, now, is a man ever too old for that?" "Yes, and for drink, too," replied Rappenhammer, as the envious Weezy walked off with a look of positive disgust on his wrinkled lineaments. "I am quite ashamed of my conduct last night. But where is De Vere? I have not seen him for some time." "Oh! dancing like the Old Harry," answered Godfroy. "You won't catch him to-night. He is all for the ladies." "That is right," remarked Rappenhanmmer, benignantly. "Then you will excuse me if I leave you?" said Godfroy. *' I will not excuse you if you don't," replied the good old fellow, smiling. "Pitch in, my boy." Godfroy nodded, laughed, and pitched in, as advised, imme- diately. "Ah, my lord," said Rappenhammer to Piquemont, as he approached that gentleman, who was observing the young people with a pleased smile, " this is a pleasant scene." "Very," replied Piquemont.   DREAMS WITHN DREAMS.       299 "Did you ever hear of the ghosts who are said to haunt this room?" asked Rappenhammer. "They say fairies dance here at night. I warrant they never had a fairer nor a mer- rier company than we have to-night."  "Fairies!" growled Weezy, who was standing near. "It is all stuff. Fairies are believed in only by asses. We don't do so in Transylvania." "So this is a haunted room," said Piquemont, looking round. "Do you know I would have thought so, without being told? I have had such strange sensations to-night." "Good I " cried Rappenhammner. "' Here we have a ghost story, cut, and dried, and ready for us; with plenty of com- pany to drive away fear, and enough lights to scare the devil." "No, no " answered Piquemont. "That is not it. But my chair certainly has moved quite strangely of itself, once or twice; and I could almost swear I felt a phantom hand clutch- ing my ankles at one time. I looked down, but saw nothing." "Hallo!" cried the Count, who had come up, and was standing impatiently listening. "Hallo! A ghost, hey? Let's see." With that he stooped down, and looked under Piquemont's chair. "What the deuce is this?" cried he, seizing Peter by the ear. "Come out, you vermin, and let us have a look at you. I suppose you want my hens? Come out, you villainl" So saying, he drew the unfortunate man out from his hiding place, and led him into the middle of the room by the lobe of the ear. Peter's knees knocked together. He gasped, held out the candlestick, and said, "Here it is, please, sir! It a'n't broke. I never will do so again. No, that I won't." "Now you are a pretty fellow," cried the Count, "to go and crawl under chairs in that way. And what the devil do you mean by taking down my candlesticks, and carrying them off in that style? Are you going to build a nest, and turn raven, in your old age, making it a receptacle for anything you can lay your filthy paws upon? Tell me instantly, you scoun- drel where are my hens?" "Oh! please, sir," whimpered Peter, "I never touched one of your lordship's hens. I wouldn't do it, not if I was going to be hung. No, not if I was going to be hung on a gibbet." "Don't be so sure," replied the Count, "that you are not going to be hung. Don't you know you have been caught in the act of theft? Don't you know that, you vagabond?    <pb n="300-301" xml:id="VAC6560-00000159"/> Don't you know that theft is a hanging matter? My lord Clo- dolphus, come! You know all sorts of things. Tell me if a count of this empire may not order the instant execution of one of his vassals, caught in the act of stealing?" Said my lord Clodolphus: "Verily he may. The Salic laws, and those of the Bavarians, Thuringians, Burgundians, and divers others, are plain on this marvellous entertaining subject. Yet, in sooth, must we carefully distinguish between the laws yclept Salic and those observed by the Visigoths and Burgundians. The former were partial to the Franks, as thus: double the fine was levied for the murder of a Frank than for the murder of a Roman; and sundry other equally unjust stat- utes of the like kind. Now, the laws of Gondebaud, still in force, give no benefit to him to the manor born, but require that the citizen should be equally punished with the stranger within our gates. Verily I shall say nothing of the ages be- fore the flood, because-" "Because nobody wants to hear about them," interrupted the Count, fretfully. 'Who the deuce does? Gracious good- ness, man! can't you answer a man, when he asks you how much two and two make?" "Certainly," quoth my lord Clodolphlus. "Well, do it, then," said the Count. "Two and two make four," solemnly said my lord Clodol. phus. "I don't want to know that," cried the Count. "Then why did you ask?" quoth my lord Clodolphus. "Oh! you know very well what I mean," replied the Count. "Can I hang the fellow, or can I not?" "If that's what you want to know-" began my lord Clo- do]phus. ' Yes, that's what I want to know," interrupted the Count. 4"So please don't go and tell me anything else." "The shortest way," replied my lord Clodolphus, "is to put the accused to the test by water. Have a caldron of that liquid set over a fire, until the same boils. Then place the accused therein, having previously taken off his habiliments." "His what?" asked the Count.! "His clothes," explained my lord Clodolphus. "Oh!" replied the Count. "And what next?" "If the accused be innocent," pursued my lord Clodolphus, "then verily will he be scalded at once, even unto death." "I see," said the Count.   aDREAMS WITHTIN DREAMS.       301 "If,".. ontinued my lord Clodolphus, "the accused be guilty, he will remain in the boiling element unharmed; under which circumstance you may have him instantly executed." At these terrible words, Peter began to howl dolefully. "A very good notion," said the Count. "My dear," con. tinued he, addressing his wife, " my dear, get a kettle." "I will not have any such a thing in my house," replied the Countess, indignantly. "Are you not ashamed of your- self, Charles?" "There It" replied her husband; "you are always telling me. how wise Clodolphus is; and the very first time I deter- mine to follow his advice, you blow up with a bang." ' And my lord Clodolphus ought to be ashamed of himself too," replied the old lady. "Come along, Peter. Don't howl so dreadfully. Nobody is going to harm you. Here, Clovis; take him away." "Now, did you ever see the like?" cried the Count, as Peter was hurried off. "The law  is verily antique and just," observed my lord Clodolphus. "We don't do things so in Transylvania," said Weezy, shaking his head. 4 No, nor anywhere else, I hope," remarked Rappenham. mer, as the music struck up. So the dancing began again, and flirting was resumed, and all that kind of thing; and at last it was-tim9 for supper. The Duke was sent for, and came down. Anr/the music saluted him, as he bowed politely to the company, and took the seat assigned him. Then Wolfgang, De Steele, Clovis, and Claude, who had been appointed directors of ceremony, caused every- body to take seats around the room; whereat arose much jocose squeezing and sundry silvery laughs at brazen propo- sitions.  Suddenly music was heard, although whence it came no- body could divine. While they all were wondering, the wall opposite the platform opened, the wainscot sliding back, and an immense table resembling a  harvest cart was dragged in by twenty boys, by gilt cords. Seated on the cart was a young girl, who guided the lads by silver reins fastened to golden bits, which the boys held between their teeth. When the car reached the middle of the room, it stopped. The young girl then asked for the Count, who stepped forward, and replied- "What would you with me?'    <pb n="302-303" xml:id="VAC6560-00000160"/> 302      DREAMS WITHN DREAMS. "Noble Count," said the girl, "Titania, Queen of the Fairies, hearing that her court could not hold its accustomed meeting in this their favorite spot to-night, desired to know the reason of so novel an interruption. Learning that it was an entertainment held in honor of the Count of Piquemont, she bade me offer this small tribute as a token of her favor and approbation." "Tell her grace," replied the Count, "that, in the name of my guest and myself, I thank her, and am heartily sorry to have interfered with her pleasure even for only one night." "Nay," answered the girl, c"I will bring but half your message. My memory is short, and will but bear your thanks." "And will you not stay and share the feast?" asked the Count. "The donor's presence should grace the gift." "Immortals may not eat with mortals," replied the young girl, bending gracefully. So saying, she clapped her hands. The wainscot again rolled back, and a huge dragon crawled in. It was about twenty feet long, besides a long tail curling up. Creeping up to the car, it crouched at an imperious sign from the girl; who descended, and took her seat on its neck. The dragon then made a complete circuit of the room, bearing its fair mistress, and finally disappeared by the door, which again closed. The lads then stepped out of their harness, and, under the superintendence of De Steele, Claude, Wolfgang, and Clo vis, handed the refreshments round with which the car was loaded. "Not bad," said Lord Snore, pompously, to Sir Christopher Weezy. "I don't know," replied that gentleman. ' I don't like it. We don't do so in Transylvania." "Transylvania seems to be a mighty strange country," whispered Rappenhammer, who had overheard the remark, to Bolero Schneiderknocken. "And to have mighty strange inhabitants, if Weezy be a fair specimen," replied Bolero, huskily. "Rather better than my affair," said Godfroy to Kate, by whom he was accidentally seated-or, at least, if it was no accident, it certainly is no business of ours. "I don't know that," replied Kate. "You cannot compare the two, any more than you can compare our fairy girl to your Sleeping Beauty." "Smaragdus certainly was out of character," said Godfroy. I wish I had thought of a woman."   DREAMS WITHN DREAMS.        303 "No, no!" cried Kate. "I would not have had the scene lost for the world. But are you not going to dance?" "With you?" inquired Godfroy. "I am too tired," answered Kate. "So am I," said Godfroy. "But yet-" hesitated Kate. "Well, will you?" asked Godfroy. "h! I could not think of troubling you, since you are so tired, said Kate. (Who is the greatest humbug-a man, or a woman?) "I don't think I am tired, after all," said Godfroy. "I think it will do me good. I only felt a little weak." "Yes," replied Kate; "you must feel faint after eating so very little. You hardly managed to finish five pounds of solid food. I think you must be in love." "I think I must be," assented Godfroy. "Pray tell us the lady's name," cried Kate. "Don't you know?" asked Godfroy. Now, blessed reader, mark! Why under the sun, moon, stars, comets, planets, and asteroids, should Kate want to know who was the fair object of Godfroy's affections? And echo answers "Why?" "What was going on between these two was evident to the meanest capacity; but the why and where- fore is not so easily seen. It is a fact, that at this crisis God- froy actually proposed to Kate, and Kate actually refused God- froy. Now what game was the young lady playing? I don't know, and I don't believe you, or anybody else knows. It is true, Kate said, with some show of reason, that an acquaint- ance of less than a week hardly justified such a proposition; but then, why did the woman draw the man on to commit him- self? And again echo answers "Why?" As they were en- gaged in this interesting conversation, all the room rang with a loud cry: "My God!" "Quickl" cried Piquemont.  "Help I  The Duke has fainted." The mufic ceased, the dancers hurried toward the platform. "What is it? What is it?" was heard on all sides. "Lend your arm," cried Piquemont. "So! Throw the water on his face. That is right. How are you now, Louis?" Uphorn opened his eyes. "  Here," said Piqueront, "take my arm-or no! Godfroy is stronger."

"What was it?" inquired Kate of Wolfgang. "The Count," he answered, "called Uphorn's attention to the portrait of his eldest son, now dead, when the Duke cried, ' My God I' and fainted." CHAPTER XXVII. TAKING A VIEW OF TITYRUS, MELIB(EUS, ALPHESIB(EUS, ORLAN DO, AND ROSALIND; TOGETHER WITH THE INTRODUCTION OF A NEW CHARACTER. FROM the havoc of war, the pomp of processions, the dis- cussions on witchcraft, the learning of my lord Clodolphus, and dissertations on Homer, let us turn to a rural scene perfectly delightful. Ubald and Rosalia, Ardor and Simplicius, together with the wise Prytanis, under the pastoral names of Tityrus, Melibceus, Alphesibceus, Orlando, and Rosalind, had carried out their determination, and dwelt happily together in two rustic cottages beneath the brown boughs and green leaves of the woodland. Now poetry and sheep as naturally go together as roast goose and sage. Each desiring to show his or her talent in that direction, Ardor presented the company with a copy of verses, which he declared to be of his own composition. As I have great doubts myself on the subject, and as the story brings an actor on the scene whom I shall soon want, there can be no better way of presenting him to the reader than by trying to clear away the mists of doubt from this great question. The reader will pardon me, therefore, if I go back a little. In a poor cottage sat a young man, apparently in delicate health, a few days after Ardor and Simplicius first reached Ber- trand Castle. As they say a man exposes. the secret passions of his soul when he talks too much, we may infer that an au- thor does the same when he writes a great deal. The reader, if he cares to pursue the subject, will learn the peculiar bent of the young man's character, by perusing those verses we have taken from his collection, and which we give as the best de- scription of his bent of mind. Now I know the usual fate of poetry in a novel-it is   DREAMS WITHN DREAMS.           305 skipped; but I don't care. I intend to smuggle verses in, and, as they are the easiest things to pass over, let them be skipped by whoso listeth.   On the other hand, whoever is curious enough to read them, let him do it. There they are. I have not scratched my head in the agony of composition, and gone within a few  feet of distraction in hunting up rhymes, to be put off in that way, I can tell you. Cheesy says they are stuff; but what does Cheesy know about the sublime? So here are Anselm's verses (that is the lad's name, by the by), and, if they are poor, put it to him, not me. We know not hope, who ought to know her well; We heed her not, who ought to heed her e'er; Chained to the transient by a wicked spell, We court presumption or invoke despair. Seldom her warnings reach our sordid hearts Until too late to profit by her worth; Until eternity the truth imparts Which time already testified on earth. Celestial comforter, first joy of man When angel choirs round his cradle sung, And first the march of centuries began The constellations of the sky among: Although, sweet spirit, thou hast ever charmed Enchanted millions with thy tuneful lyre; Although thy name is evermore embalmed Where souls to immortality aspire; Although pure from thy store full many a gem Research hath gathered to adorn the past; Although o'er life to come a diadem Of endless glory thou hast smiling cast: Although thy brow from beauty's mould is ta'en; Exquisite touches from thy pencil fly; Thypleasures joy: thy loveliness must reign, YWhile man is conscious of his destiny- Still must we pause and doubt, complain and grieve, Rebels to thee, when miseries descend, As if a mortal ne'er the earth did leave, As if in heaven we possessed no friend. For, when stern death awakes us from life's dream, Hoarse are our cries, and terrible our gloom; As if our heaven spread not on high serene, Above the mouldering kingdom of the tomb. Come, sacred virtue, and, descending here, Touch thou my heart, and feed love's sacred fire; Thee I invoke, chaste hope! from yonder sphere Where thou wast born, and where thou must expire.    <pb n="306-307" xml:id="VAC6560-00000162"/> 306        DREAMS WITHN DREAM1S. Span the abyss of dissolution. Show The blissful mansions of the hallowed dead. Pluck from the bier its attributes of woe, And comfort o'er the mourner's spirit shed. Descend to mine assistance, and display Thy dying children to my raptured eye: Depict their calmness as they pass away, And teach me, sacred virtue, how to die! Even at, the risk of wearying the reader, I have to intro- duce another extract, because it was the occasion of a conver- sation developing some of our good friend Ardor's peculiarities. As Anselm finished the above verses, that love-loving gen- tleman entered, and asked whether the verses he had ordered (he talked of them as if they were so many groceries) were ready? Anselm replying in the affirmative, Ardor expressed his curiosity to hear the same, which were as follows: TO MY AMANTA. God save thee, loved one. Thou hast grieved me much; So fair-so scornful. As the tall pines, 'neath Zephyr's airy touch, Breathe music mournful: I, for thy sake, Touched by the breath of grief, my lamentations make. Thy heait is blessed? Alas! and wherefore then Hast stolen mine? Cruel! the gift I cannot take again Thou know'st is thine. Thou know'st full well That while my heaven thou art, thou also art my hell. God save thee, loved one. Pride is useless here, An idle pain. The grief I feel brings no unmanly tear,  No regret vain. But was it right To meet me, charm me, win me, leave me quite? Still clings my heart about thee as its own, My idol still. Though judgment bids me calmly look upon Thy Siren skill, And draw from this How false a heaven thou art and what my folly is. Supernal love was all I should have asked, Praying for love; My spirit then had not been overtasked Its strength above; Nor sorrow met; Nor tasted close behind such rapture such regret.   DREAMS WITHN DREAMS.           307 "Do you call that poetry?" asked Ardor, contemptuously. "Why, there a'n't two lines of a length.   If that is all you can do, I don't like your ware, my man. Come; I see you want a lift. I will help you. Begin with the Muses.   That's the way." "But," remonstrated Anselm,   it will never do to begin a love song with an address to the Muses." "No Muses, no money," replied Ardor, laconically. Anselm  sighed, and wrote a few  moments.   "Will that do?" he asked at length. Euphrosyne hail! and ye, AEonian nine, Who from Homeric heights the passions viewed; Who, 'mid the Roman liberty's decline, The Mantuan lyre with harmony indued; Who Dante's mind with sapience imbued 'Neath mystic forms the unseen to intrust; Who jewels on the banks of Avon strewed, Whence rise fair sounds of melody august, Strains of your favorite child, long crumbled into dust. "Just so," said Ardor, complacently.   "My notion pre- cisely. I give you credit for a kind of rhyming, sing-song tal. ent, but the idea is mine. Now let us go on. Next I want a whole lot of stuff about stars, and graves, and music, and all that kind of trash." The boy looked at his companion not a little perplexed. "Stars, and graves, and music!" he repeated.  "How can I put that in a love song?? "Oh! you can squeeze it in, if you choose," said Ardor. "I don't see how," said Anselm. "No stars, graves, and music, no money," replied Ardor, obstinately. Whereat Anselm sighed again, and wrote as follows: Behold, Amanta, my once hoped-for bride, The loveliness of nature spreads sublime, While the sole relic of fair nature's pride, Her conqueror man, great sovereign of time, Image of God; by God Himself divine; Created wise, and good, and strong, and brave, Can only add (oh, memory malign!) To nature s wondrous excellence-a grave, Or where the monarch sleeps, or where lies stretched the slave. Shall ever on this little sphere of pride, Be realized imagination's dreams? Nature, one great cathedral, far and wide, To eyes angelic in her beauty seems.    <pb n="308-309" xml:id="VAC6560-00000163"/> oVo        DrEAa3S WrIln, U NDREAMS. A great cathedral, whose fair pavement gleams Beautiful mosaic; mingling land and sea In one broad view all exquisite; where streams And hills and valleys join in harmony, O'erarched by yonder dome-a starry canopy. O Spirit! say, who can so much foretell, Say, will it ever hear such anthems rise- Will ever man the happy music swell, Which rolls along the temple of the skies? Or must the End come robed in peaceful guise, When rapine and dismay precede our fall, 'Mid strife, and groans, and hatred, moans and sighs, Till ruin is the awful end of all, Cursed by the %inful chains which millions now enthrall? "You see," said Ardor, " you are one of those animals who need the hand of reason to guide you by the bit of compulsion. Now don't you go and say you composed this, because you did not. It is all mine, except the prosody. You are getting on finely, now that a sensible man shows you how to set to work. Now shove in a moral." "A moral!" exclaimed Anselm. "Yes, my poor friend, a moral," replied Ardor, compas- sionately.   "'I won't have anything to do with immoral poetry; and a song without a moral is necessarily immoral. Don't talk to me. If you don't stick a moral in, I won't pay you." So Anselm, meekly obeying, as is meet for him who ex- pects money from another, took up his pen, and wrote: Blessed are we, dear love, by nature taught. Her page was written by our Maker's hands; Nor classic lore nor academic thought Preface e'en what the mighty work commands. His folly with contempt inquiry brands, Whose soul presumptuous its pure lessons scorns; Oblivion consigns him to her bands In insignificancy's iron thongs: For it is God's own book, to whom all truth belongs. Celestial love! of graces mightiest, best, How true, how pure, how matchless is thy page! Some honor woo. Some sail in mammon's quest. Some vengeance seek. Some cynic grow with age. Some for their wrongs, and some for nothing rage. But thou in recollected calm dost dwell; Enthroned in peace, with war thou war dost wage, And justice-even justice-soft canst quell, Beatitude of heaven, and agony of hell. "I  don't know   about that," remarked  Ardor, critically. "You seem    to be very fond of poking hell into your poems. Hell is not exactly the subject one would choose for a lady's                     ' '   Vx^i A.Mqo WT I rI3N DREAMS.        JV  amusement. But let it pass. If you spoil my beautiful ideas, you can't help it, I suppose.  Now please to fetch me in with a burst. I wish to come in like a bull, tossing things about, and kicking up my heels generally.    You understand?" "I can't say I do," replied Anselm, meekly. "Well, I will help you, then," said Ardor, "since you have so little sense. Let's have a contrast. You ended the last verse with a very hot idea.   I want you to freeze some- body at the end of the next." I Good gracious!" groaned the young poet. ' Come, pitch in!" cried Ardor, encouragingly.    ' Don't forget the ice. Have a regular North Sea affair, a touch of the ague; a thing to make a man shiver, and his teeth to chat- ter; a thing to make a fellow turn blue." With pious resignation, Anselm    tried to make the best of it. "Will this do?" he asked. Amanta! striving fierce With grief and wrath I wander, prey to woe and vain desire. My peace is ruined, and my father's hearth Can offer now, at the domestic fire, No place for me; where once my good old sire So oft hath smiled when crept I to his knees. Henceforth the world, its misery and ire, Is all my portion, all my hope of ease ; Yon icy land, whose blasts the young affections freeze. "Very good," replied Ardor.   "You see what you can do when   you try.  Now  wind up with something  gloomy, and let's have an end of the trash." "I  think we had  better," replied Anselm, who   then con- cluded thus: As ebbs the tide, abandoning the coast, And fall its plashing waves with solemn roar; As its floods gradually yield the ghost In measured tread, and back their squadrons draw Majestical, retreating from the shore, So dies the saint. His spirit, grace-upborne, By nature's fixed, irrevocable law, Deserts the light; while flesh-bound souls look on, As life sinks low, and now, with one last sigh, is gone! Thus perished all my blessings; though I still The recollections of my fancies prize. In vain resisting (when had love free-will?), My reminiscence to those hours flies. Imagination bids each scene arise, Such as enchanted once the fleeting hours. Rich were their meadows, beautiful their skies, Solemn their shades, and exquisite their flowers; Fairer their calm this day when dark the tempest lowers. c ,     *      ,         *.'   -   * .

The constellations glittering above, Once learned when time could smile as well as fly, Still sparkle as they sparkled o'er outr love, Still shine o'er those who smile and those who die. Farewell! Bliss dead, why longer linger I? Farewell! To God I leave thee, lady mine. When I am dead, if thou canst breathe no sigh, Offer one prayer unto the throne divine, For his repose who living was so truly thine! "Don't those last two words sound very much like the way we end letters?" asked Ardor.   "'Truly thine,' or 'yours truly.' I don't quite like that. Couldn't you stick something else in? What rhymes to 'thine,' now? "Swine," replied Anselm. "That would be worse." said Ardor. "Well, let the thing stand. She won't notice it, I dare say. Besides, I don't know but that 'yours truly' is a very proper way of winding up. Everybody begins with Muses.   Why shouldn't everybody end with some fixed sentence? Yours truly' is the last nail driven into a letter. By Jove I you and I will start a new idea, my boy. Henceforth let all poetry, amatory or other- wise, end with 'sincerely yours.' And so it was Ardor came into possession of the verses ho now presented to the pastoral company as his own compo- sition. Politeness required that the company should applaud this conception of the brain; although, whatever they may have thought of the verses, taken singly, they found some difficulty in seeing with what intention they were strung together. Now Rosalia, who had a keen sense of the ridiculous, had detected certain weaknesses in the discreet Simplicius, and, in spite of Ardor's reiterated protestation, managed to bring him out capitally. Under her benign patronage, the discreet Sim- plicius improved amazingly, and actually defied Ardor himself. Among other things, Rosalia had made him believe himself a poet, and now the idea came into her head to draw him out in rivalry to his former companion. If the reader has read Spenser's Shepherd's Calendar, he will recollect a song in the Aigloga Octava, sung alternately between Willie and Perigot. Rosahla, having just perused this poem, afterward read it aloud to the company, and then said: "I pray you, Alphesibceus, let us try our hands at this kind of song, by this purling stream, under these verdant trees; for I am sure Spenser himself could hold no candle to you." Whereat the discreet Simplicius simpered, and consented, and Ardor   DREAMS' WIThITN DREAMS.         31 grew nervous; but he had sense enough to say nothing, where he knew remonstrance&amp; would be useless.  They then sang the following, which we copy under their pastoral names: Rosalind. Once upon a time, a maid Alphesiboaus. Hey, ho, maiden mine! Ros.    Of Dan Cupid was afraid; AlIp.    For it wasn't in her line. Bos.    To the forest she retires: Alphl.    Hey, ho, cut your stick! Ros.    For her many a youth aspires: Alph.    Poor devils! lovesick. Ros.    Cruel, she heeds them not; Alph.    Hey, ho, heeding; Ros.    They, fasting, haunt the spot; Alps.    Mighty poor feeding. Ros.    One moaned, another sighed, Alph.    Hey, ho, sighing; Ros.    Another fain for her had died. Alph.    Pretty tall lying. BRos.   Fled she to her forest home, Alph.    Hey, ho /fleeting, Ros.   Feeding on the honeycomb. Alph.    Not bad eating. Res.   Small and slender were her feet, Alph.    Hey, ho, footsies; Ros.    Treading on the blossoms sweet.  ApIsh.    Oh! what little tootsies! Hereupon Rosalind, or Rosalia, could   keep serious no longer, but laughed long and merrily. The discreet Simplicius, not in the least embarrassed, joined her forthwith in a grating voice, which sounded more like sharpening a saw than an effort at cachination. Indeed, there was quite a variety in the laugl- ter of this assembly: that of Rosalia being silvery; that of her husband a regular "Ho! ho! ho!" and that of Prytanis resembling a cackle. "I suppose you compare that rubbish of yours to my Muse,'9 said Ardor, contemptuously. "For my part, fair Rosalind," observed Simplicius, ignor- ing Ardor's existence, "I think that all poetry, except yours and mine, is humbug." "Worm that I am! I deny that," cried Prytanis.  "What have you to say against mine, for instance?" "I never knew  you wrote poetry, Signor Tityrus," said Rosalia. "Miserable sinner that I am!" replied Prytanis; "there are not two Tityruses here, fair Rosalind." Rosalia looked puzzled.  "I mean," continued the wise Prytanis, "that I naturally supposed, since you called me Tity-    <pb n="312-313" xml:id="VAC6560-00000165"/> 312      DREAMS WITHN DREAMS. rus senior, you fancied there was a Tityrus junior somewhere in the vicinity. I am neither married nor to be married." "Nay," replied Rosalia, laughing, "I said Signor Tityrus, not Tityrus senior."  "There is not a jot of difference," said the wise Prytanis. "Before or behind, in front or in rear, head or tail, previous or afterward, it is precisely the same. A fine horse is a horse who is fine; a fertile field is a field which is fertile; a splendid diamond is a diamond that is splendid; and Senior Tityrus is Tityrus senior." "Certainly," acquiesced Ubald, gravely. "My dear, you must not talk nonsense." Rosalia looked laughing at her husband, who burst out, "Ho! ho! ho!" Simplicius and Prytanis, who did not under- stand what Ubald meant, looked grave; the former trying to comprehend it, and the latter pretending so to do. Ardor gave a howl intended for a laugh, which gave the whole com- pany a nervous start; for none of them could ever get used to that gentleman's manner of cachination. But the wise Pryta- nis, bringing the conversation back to its origin, said: "I tell you, my poetry is mellifluous." "Your poetry is what?" asked the discreet Simplicius. "Mellifluous, or like honey," replied the wise Prytanis. "I don't know that," said the discreet Simplicius, shaking his head. Drones don't make honey, and there is very little of the working bee in your carcass, old Nosey." - Whereat Ardor, who had been fretting under Simplicius's  impertinence for a long while, took up the gloves for Prytanis, and cried, before that wise man had an opportunity to answer: "My opinion of you, Simplicius, is that you are a hog." This unexpected attack startled Simplicius not a little; but he soon recovered presence of mind, and desired Ardor to be blowed. "'No, I won't be blowed," replied Ardor. "You be blowed yourself. You, forsooth, to call a gentleman Noseyl What do you mean by bringing your dropsical carcass into polite society, and opening your foul mouth in ribald remarks. when your brutal opinion is neither required for information, nor asked out of courtesy? If you have not the most des- perate hope of ever accidentally possessing the most remote claim to the faintest spark of even embryo good breeding, have a at least the instinct to hold your tongue in their presence who are more than infinitely your superiors. You criticize poetry, indeed I Oh get out."   DREAMS WITHN DREAMS.        313 "You're another," retorted Simplicius. "Why shouldn't I?" "Do you know what Horace says?" asked Ardor. "And who the deuce was he?" asked the discreet one. "Horace," said Ubald, gravely, " was a Welsh bard, who wrote love songs in the reign of Nimrod." "Now you know who he was," said Ardor, twirling his mustache. "You see how ignorant you are, and how you are obliged to come to me for information." "It strikes me," answered Simplicius, "that the informa- tion never came from you at all, but from another person." That has nothing whatever to do with the point at issue," replied Ardor. "I would have given you the same-facts, had time been allowed me. Permit me, therefore, to repeat mildly, that you are a hog." "Get out!" cried Simplicius. "You are one yourself. How can a man know everything? Come, I will catch you, wise as you think yourself. Have you ever read the Odes of Alivanus?" "Certainly," replied Ardor. "And I too diligently, miserable toad that I am," added the wise Prytanis. "Why, who has not?" asked Ubald, looking round with mock solemnity. The discreet Simplicius looked from one face to the other with wonder, and then burst into a hoarse laugh. "Why," he cried, "there never was such a poet. I in- vented the name on the spur of the moment, to entrap Ardor; and bless me, if my hook hasn't come up with three fishes in- stead of one!" At this, Ubald shouted, and acknowledged himself fairly caught; Prytanis pretended he had only said so to further the joke; while Ardor, mortified at being so publicly beaten by a person whom he had always considered, and not without cause, half a fool, turned very red, and looked very sulky. Now I must remind the civilized world (which I take fot granted will eagerly devour this immortal work), that the rural retreat sacred to the conversation of this select company, was not far from Bertrand Castle. Remembering this, the afore- said world will not be astonished to hear that, at this turn of the talk, Anselm himself came up with a letter from the Count, inviting them all to join the goodly company assembled at the "'    <pb n="314-315" xml:id="VAC6560-00000166"/> castle. Ardor introduced the young poet, and immediately Rosalia requested him to give her a specimen of his art. t"I will repeat only a fragment," he replied, modestly, "and I pray you not to judge too severely.   Heaven has not willed that I should have that comprehensive genius which knows how to combine its faculties, and concentrate them    in one work.  Whatever may be the value of my ideas, they come to me without being called up, and float past as indis- tinctly as a vision of the night. If I try to embody them in words, they  elude my  grasp, as the fabled ghosts of the JEnead.' With this preface, be then proceeded to repeat the follow- ing verses: 1. "Material wealth with syren music lures Man's homebound vessel to mammonian shores. That virtue, lasting as high heaven endures, Few men to-day entirely controls. At best, we find some unassuming souls, Who Ophir own not as their favored clime; But truth, as on the tide of sorrow rolls, Bears few such spirits to the brink of time, While meekness man contemns, and murder calls sublime. II, And what the counter-charm? A mote, indeed, A shadow which deserves a worser name; 'Gainst which at first integrity did plead Until the small grew up a monstrous shame. The venial, the mortal sin became. The mortal sin of thought became an act. Then, holy God! of thy creation bane, What miserable sins did man enact  In heaven a woful tale; on earth a hideous fact. "I. Ah, innocence! how can thy hate of sins Allure men by materialism chained? Simplicity alone true wisdom wins, Because this world its goodness hath not stained. Edenic joys! why have ye not remained? Edenic bliss, by Christ to man restored, Why--why hast never to the wide world deigned More sons of thine illustrious to afford? Why must mankind still stand rebellious to our God? IV. The holy man, whatever his degree, Must in his secret meditations mourn The languid efforts of humanity, By mammon fettered and by faction torn; The prize of hell, its victim, toy, and scorn.   -  - si cto.         315 Tepidity's sick twilight o'er our sky hroeth its lurid haze; whose view forlori, Dispirits zeal, debilitates the eye, And leaves no further wish than to enjoy and die. v. And mammon's heart, so callous, selfish, hard, Refuses to relieve a brother's woe. The worldly human sympathy discard, Nor poverty's experiences know. Mammon at mercy strikes a deadly blow, By gold absorbed and avaricious care. O self-denial the most deadly foe The covetous no brother's burden bear. What fellowship has wealth with sickness-want-despair? VI. Have sought the cloister or the hermitage; Or why luxurious purple they have doffed, Daring contempt and shame in every age? Sweet Charity! thy beauty to the sage Fraught with such honor is, he longs, he flies The battle of ambition and its rage; Within the cell content to close his eyes Upon a world where man so sins, so lives, so dies. Need we then wonder at the path, so trod, Where, solitary, virtue to pursue, Man seeks the gentle presence of his God; AtheDe's natural mysteries passing through, Until his spirit, hungerinlg for the true, Joys unitative tastes with awed amaze: Where science ever ancient, ever new, Floods the awed intellect's enraptured gaze, As Paul prostrated, blind, by God s supernal rays? I     vIIrI Hope in retirement ennobles life Teaching the value of the heavenly prize. Humility annihilateth strife. Mortification leads to Paradise. By penance man grows happ, good, and wise, And patiently life's temporal ills are borne , Interior life seeks guerdon in the skies.

Simplicis, who had not the slightest idea what a Vandal was (indeed, how can a man be supposed to know everything?), took for granted it was something bad, but had sense enough to see that Ubald was in earnest. Ardor looked on, well pleased, and then tipped Anselm a wink, as if to say, "It's all very well, my boy; but, between ourselves, you never composed that; although you have a sort of a gift for prosody." Prytaos sat till, and looked grim; not for any particular rea- Prytanis  sat   s , ' n suited his son, except that he generally thought that expression suited his particular style of beauty. At this moment, the rural company s pastoral ears were awakened by the tramp of horses, and, before they recovered from their first surprise, Father Wilfrid and the Professor rode up. The priest, recognizing Prytanis, paused to greet him, when he was invited to stop a while and rest himself. Assent- ing, he and the Professor descended, and a committee of the whole house was convoked to consider the Count's invitation. The argument was gravely opened by the great Prytanis. To you, reverend priest sad he    to you, most worthy instructor of youth; to you, poet laureate of this syl- worthy instructor o          MelYboe van retreat; to you, fair Rosalind; to you, Melibcus, Orlando, and Alphesibceus, do I, Tityrus, a mierable a al, addres myself, for a purpose hereinafter to be mentioned. At this introduction, the two newcomers were not a little astonished; wondering what under the sun the man meant byhis Tityruses wondering what " ount Bertrand," continued Prytanis, ' has and Orlandos.) Count  -      et laur- ate of this invited, by the mouth of yonder youth, poet lau reate of this sylvan retreat, the present company, exclusive of this reveren priest and that worthy instructor f youth (doubastl.

But, as we are here knit in the bonds of good fellowship, let every one speak: nce I hold it just that the decision should be unprejudiced, the consent cheerful, and the vote unanimous," Whereupon the love-loving Ardor, heavily sighing, rose to his feet, and thus began"   DR]EAMS WITHN DREAMS.        1 "Miserable animals would we indeed be, most wise Tity- rus, should not each and every one here present hold himself bound to abide by the decision of the present pastoral congre- gation. Therefore I propose that we choose one who, for the universal favor wherewith he is here regarded, shall receive the secret assent or dissent of each particular individual, and give in his report as simply unanimous or not; a unanimous vote being, as you profoundly observe, a sine qua non of our appro- bation." Thereat uprose the discreet Simplicius, who volunteered his services as confidential agent. To whom the love-loving Ardor sternly thus replied: "Sit down, coxcomb!  Sit down, and let your betters speak. You are here only on sufferance, and should be hum- bly grateful for our condescension in not kicking you out with ignominy."  With which  ejaculation, Ardor, boiling with wrath, snorted like a walrus. Then thus Simplicius: "You go to grass, you rag-tag Caliph of Bobtails. You needn't snort, or mutter 'Bless my soulI' quite so loud. Bless your soul, indeed! You won't find people doing that in a hurry, unless they bless you for doing them the inexplicably .incomprehensible benefaction of quitting their company." Here Ubald rose to restore peace, and wisely showed that Ardor, as proposer of the motion, was entitled to the position. After much argument with Simplicius, the point was gained, and Ardor proceeded to collect the votes; which being done, he made the following speech: "To the company I now address myself, feeling it my duty (since the vote is unanimous) to give, with the previously ascertained consent of each person, the individual opinions of the sylvan associate orders of love and mutton; the fair Ro- salind and her valorous spouse Orlando, Tityrus, Alphesibceus, and myself; together with the opinions of the reverend priest aind the worthy instructor of youth, and the poet laureate of this forest. "As a slight difference of opinion has lately transpired be- tween my umquehile companion Simplicius, better known as Alphesiboeus (or, if you prefer it, Alphesibceus better known as Simplicius), at any rate, between that gentleman and my- self, I trust that he will evince his true reconciliation by cor- recting me, should I, by any untoward accident (never suffi- ciently by me to be deplored) fail to express the will of the    <pb n="318-319" xml:id="VAC6560-00000168"/> 318      DREAMS WITIIN DREAMS. company to me for the present time, in a most flattering, a most agreeable, and a most confidential way confided. "This being premised, you must know all, that I, Melibceus, have, at a certain unhappy time, fallen in love with a certain cruel damsel, peerless in beauty, matchless in accomplishments, and unequalled in understanding. Her name,' I need hardly say, is Amanta. At the same time, my umwhile companion at love, Simplicius, took a sneaking hankering after a certain buxom female named Liebchen-" "Allow me to correct you," interrupted Simplicius, politely. "You have made no less than three mistakes. First, my love was not sneaking; secondly, Liebchen is neither buxom, nor a female; and, thirdly, I am not Simplicius here, but Alphesi- -bcus." "Indeed?" urbanely rejoined Ardor; "indeed? Are you aware of what nonsense you are talking, most discreet Alphe- siboeus. I rather think not. The word 'sneaking' denotes not only meanness and servility, but also something hidden. When we say we conceive a sneaking regard, we mean that we hide our flame in the depths of our hearts." "' Oh!" replied Simplicius; "i if that is what you- meant, I retract." "Never," suavely answered Ardor, " never be a fool again, my good fellow. As to your second objection, I should like to know what the deuce Liebchlen is, if she is not a female? And, as to the qualification buxom, she is not a skeleton, I fancy?  As to your being Alphesiboeus, and not Simplicius here, who the devil cares? It is not a proper cause for inter- ruption. So hold your infernal tongue, or I'll knock it out of your dirty jaws, and send your head rolling after it." Then, turning to the company, Ardor continued: "As I said before, the divine Amanta led me captive in the chains of love, and the wench Liebchen, a healthy, strap- ping lass, took my companion's fancy, who entertained a han. kering for her. To me, Love appeared to touch Nature with sooty fingers, making all black. I pined, and sighed, and bel- lowed lustily. I wandered about in unpleasant weather. I uttered complaints to the moon. I did all, in fine, that a bona fide lover ought to do under the circumstances. Simplicius, being rejected by his woman, would fain follow my footsteps. Yet his success was not equal to mine. He could not pine, because he ate too much. When hlr tried to lauwn t, he fe l asleep in the operation. When he essayed solitary rambles, he   DREAMS WITHN DREAMS.        319 always managed it badly; either he was caught in the rain, or trespassed on the grounds of another-when he usually was ignominiously ordered to come out of that, with execrations. On one occasion, I remember, he was assisted in his flight by means of a bulldog, who fixed his teeth firmly some seven inches below the small of his back. Yet, for all this, I took compassion on him. I became his patron. We wandered to- gether. Together have we wept over the graves of entombed innocence. Together have we mourned our loves. If he has profited by my instructions, be mine the credit. If he has not, let him ascribe it to the true cause-to wit, his own stupidity: for a more senseless, pig-headed, stupid, shameless, greedy, utterly irredeemable combination of the donkey and the hog, it was never before my lot to meet with in this vale of tears." Here Simplicius snorted. Turning to him, Ardor said, impressively: "Now, Simplicius, let me warn you not to put your spoon into my pie. You may snort as much as you please, and breathe as hard as you please, but don't talk. If you say a word about the graves of entombed innocence, I will punch your head. Contradiction is the parent of punched heads. Let that be the formula of your future intercourse with me. ' Therefore," continued Ardor, turning once more to the company, "we joined you in this abode of the nymphs. You, beauteous Rosalind, and you, magnanimous Orlando, have doubtless reasons of your own, as likewise the sapient Tityrus. This, our poet laureate, before the happy arrival of yonder reverend priest and yonder worthy instructor of youth, has invited us to the castle. Must our company, then, be broken up? No.  Why?  Because we mean to return. What, then, are we about to do? To pay a visit. Therefore thus speak we: for a few days let Rosalind become Rosalia; Orlan- do, Ubald; Tityrus, Prytanis; Alphesibceus, Simplicius; and Melibceus, Ardor. In a few days will we return, when once more Ardor shall become Melibceus; Simplicius, Alphesibocus; Prytanis, Tityrus; Ubald, Orlando; and Rosalia, Rosalind." HEe said, and all agreed. Meanwhile, Father Wilfrid had been engaged in a long conversation with Anselm on matters which will be related hereafter; the result of which is all we may now tell, whicih as, to join the company on their visit to Bertrand. They were too late for the great ball, but arrived opportunely nevertheless, as we will show in another chapter.    <pb n="320-321" xml:id="VAC6560-00000169"/> 320       DREAMS WITRHN DREAMS. CHAPTER XX:        III. TOUCHNG SEVERAL STRANGE THNGS WrHCH OCCURRED AT THE CASTLE. ON the day after the ball, my lord Clodolphus met Nora on the terrace. "Verily," quoth he, "I have something for you." "And what?" asked Nora. As she asked this/the Count came up; whereat my lord Clodolphus, feeling facetious, winked at Nora, cleared his throat, and said: "To be pleased, we must have something to please us; to have something to please us, we roust be able to receive it; to be able to receive it, we must be in proper con- dition ; to be in proper condition, we must be in a good state of will; to be in a good state of will, we must be perfectly amiable; to be perfectly amiable, we must be perfectly healthy; to be perfectly healthy, we must be very prudent; to be very prudent, we must be very careful; to be very careful, we must be very discreet; to be very discreet, we must have learned discretion; to learn discretion, we must be educated; to be educated, we must have proper masters; to have proper mas- ters- " "Are you never going to stop?" asked the Count. "Are you possessed with windy devils?  Can you stand calmly there, driving honest people to distraction? Have you no compassion? Gracious goodness, man! are you not aware we have nerves?" Thereat chuckling, winked my lord Clodolphus, and, hand- ing Nora a letter, he locked his arm in that of the Count, and the two worthies strolled away toward the barnyard together. As Nora finished the letter, Clovis came up. She silently handed it to him. "What is it?" asked Clovis. "A false letter from a treacherous man," replied the young girl.. Clovis pressed her hand to his lips, and then read the- let- ter, which ran thus: "You are about to marry one who loves you not, and whose heart is bound to the dead. Ask him if he ever knew CGertrude Gallahaut? I throw myself on your discretion for the concealment of this communication."   DREAMS WITHN DREAMS.       321 "Humph!" cried Clovis, as he finished reading, " I should know that hand. And so, Nora, you thought concealment wrong?" "I certainly did," replied Nora. "Anonymous letters, for the purpose of working mischief, should always be treated with contempt. /If you, Clovis, had the heart to do me wrong, I could-at least I think I could-at least I hope I could-tell it at a glance." Her lover looked at her with admiration. *And yet," said he, fondly, "a I once doubted you." "Oh I that was quite different," cried Nora. "I do not know that," replied .the young man. "Suspi. cion proves as often lweakness of mind as shrewdness of charac. ter. But to come back to our letter. Here, Gabriel," he cried as that servant passed. "Sir?" said Gabriel. "Who brought this letter?" "A strange man." "Is he still here?" "Yes, sir." "Send him to me." "Yes, sir." "' And now, Nora," continued Clovis, as Gabriel left them, "are you busy this morning?" "No, Clovis," she replied. "Well, then, if you are curious to know more about this, meet me half an hour hence, at the seat where Godfroy told us the history of the little girl. I must first speak to this mes- senger." Nora assented, and ran in to prepare herself. Clovis con- tinued pacing up and down, until Gabriel returned with the man.  Clovis scanned him  narrowly, and, muttering "I thought so," bade him follow him to his room. When they were alone, Clovis began the interview. '"Who gave you this letter?" he asked. "A  person," replied the other, " whom I never saw before." "Describe him."   ( "He was very short, very thin, and had but one eye. He bade me  give the letter to Lady Nora, at Bertrand Castle, and not wait for an answer. I would have gone before now, only --what"   "Only what?"    <pb n="322-323" xml:id="VAC6560-00000170"/> 822      DBiEAM8  WITHN DREAMS. "Only I hoped I might be taken in service here. If you have an answer-" "You may meet the man again, you know," said Clovis, quietly, but contemptuously, " and he may question you. So you had better be posted up in what you should reply. Take a seat, for what I have to say is somewhat long." When the man had sulkily done as requested, Clovis con- tinued: "When we begin the trade of falsehood," said he, "we often deceive ourselves. We fancy, perhaps, our motives are good because the mask we put on is fair. But, when de- ceit is grown up, she insolently defies public condemnation, and walks abroad in the impudence of malice; for she has so long practised deception on herself, as well as her victims, that she begins to think herself inscrutable. Soon, however, the day comes when her delusive hopes are shattered by the very devil who has hitherto aided her. Then she stands naked before the world, a loathsome and abhorred object for general disgust and abomillation." "And what is this to me?" "You shall know presently. Now picture to yourself a cold, calculating, cruel man, who only works for the gratifica- tion of his own evil passions. Imagine him to have transferred what little affection he had, which was not absolutely selfish, to another man. Suppose that man is betrothed. The girl, then, is a rival. What does the false friend do? He uses all efforts to undermine their affection, and is, let us say, for a moment partially successful." "What is all this to me?" "You will understand in a little while. Suppose that he leaves his friend at a critical moment, and that, during his ab- sence, a reconciliation takes place. His friend, imagining him to be influenced by the purest motives of friendship, writes him a long letter full of affection,' and joy, and the mad folly of love. He receives that letter. His plans have failed. He determines, more than ever, to hinder the marriage; for there is a malignant devil pushing him on now, who was not in him before." "Again I ask, what is all this to me?" "Again I answer, you will understand in a little while. He writes an anonymous letter. He violates the most sacred confidence. He sends that letter to the lady. She reads it, and her. innocence conquers his malice, as the archangel tram. ples on Satan. Not for a moment does doubt enter her gentle   DREAM3S WITUIN DREASo.       323 heart, and charity, with a touch, overthrows the rampart which malice has: raised. And this evildoer, this treacherous friend, this liar and villain, perjured and godless, -stands by, witness of his own defeat. Albert D'Esterre, thou art the man!" Albert leaped to his feet, and threw off the false hair which disguised him, with the roar of a wild beast. "Dowri again on your seat I " cried Clovis, his eyes blazing fire. "Do you hope to confiont me-me, in your hellish rage? With truth, and honesty, and conscience, and God on my side, do you hope to cope with me?  Raise but a hand, say but a word, and, weak as I am from my wound, I will crush you as I would a serpent. For the love of what you were once, for the love of the being I believed you to be, for the hope that you may yet be reclaimed, I spare you public exposure. But we meet no more. An abyss is between us, and never will I join hands with you again, until God Almighty Himself tells me-this is a brother's hand."' Albert had now recovered presence of mind. "Upon my word," said he, " you are not unlike your father with his hens -but common sense does not run in the family. You throw me off; you give me the lie; you heap insult upon insult: and for what? Because I would not stand by and see a young girl sacrificed to a man who was not less a seducer because my friend. Tush, boy! your accusations, like your anger and petulance, are totally lost on me." "So " said Clovis, " you throw off your mask. You cover falsehood with falsehood, and, as you do so deliberately, I can say no more." "Let there be an end of this." "Amen, with all my heart." "You will repent this." "I hope you will." "I will meet you again." "But not to address me." "Yes, to insult you publicly." "If you do, I will lay my horsewhip on you." Hardly had Clovis said this, when Albert struck him vio- lently on the face. Both drew at once, and rushed upon each other, fighting more like devils than men. They soon closed, and then a  deadly struggle began. Each wrestled for the mas- tery-for life now hung on victory. Clovis, it is true, was' weakened by his recent wound, but anger had lent him a super- natural strength. Seizing his antagonist by the throat, he    <pb n="324-325" xml:id="VAC6560-00000171"/> 324       DREAMS3 WITHV'IN DREAMS. absolutely forced his head back, and struck him on the fore- head, with the hilt of his sword, such a terrible blow, that he fell stunned. Clovis rose to his feet panting, but, feeling the necessity of calling for prompt assistance, he went to the door, where he met my lord Clodolphus.  He called him in, ex- plained the whole matter to him, showed him the letter, and asked his advice. Now my lord Clodolphus was just the man for the occasion. Setting all his pedantry aside, he spoke at once to the purpose. "( He is only stunned," said he. "He must not see you when he recovers. As you promised to meet Nora, go and meet, her, saying nothing about this, of course, and leaving me to see to his quiet removal. Never mind your dress; you can arrange it as you go. Meet Nora, and take a long walk with her, and make your mind easy; for the young man verily will be well enough in a day or two. Now go. He is recovering already." Seeing the justice of what my lord Clodolplus said, Clovis left the room, descended the stairs, drank a. goblet of wine (for he was trembling now from weakness and excitement), and then proceeded to the seat in the park, where lNora was wait- ing for him with one of her brightest smiles. "Let us sit here awhile, FNora," said the young man. "I feel a little fatigued, and I want to take a long walk with you by and by. So we will first have an explanation, and then leave the matter forever. I have only one request to make, and that is, you will not refer to it again, lafless you really wish to know something T have not told you, or if it is other- wise necessary to renew the subject." "Before you say more," replied Nora, " let me speak. If you would prefer my knowing nothing, I have no curiosity to hear anything. I believe you, Clovis, on your simple affirma- tion." 4 God bldc: n y Nora!" said Clovis, fondly.. "No, no; I am not defending myself. It is best you should know it. Al- though the secret of another, and in no way directly influencing myself, my little v, ife is worthy to hear it, and sensible enough to advise me. So listen, Nora, and gravely, too, for it is not a tale of joy." ' Seven years ago, my brother Charles died; but no one knows the particiJlars of his last hours, except myself and a few to whhom I was obliged to communicate them. "About a year before he died, there lived near the village a lady called Madlame Gallahaut, and her daughter Gertrude.   DREAMS WvITHN DREAMS.       325 I knew that my brother was in love with the girl, and that his love was not returned, for Charles made me his confidant. His whole soul was wrapped up- in the pursuit, and he hoped to win her heart by constancy and perseverance." ' "And what would your father have said to it?" asked Nora. "Gertrude," replied Clovis, " was the daughter of an ex- iled nobleman. Did he object to you for that reason?" "True," said Nora, smiling. "Shortly before my brother's death," continued Clovis, ';he became very sad. He used to sit for hours leaning on his hand, and plunged in the most melancholy thought. I tried to rouse him from his depression, but in vain. He would thank me gently, and walk away without giving me any clue to the cause of his sorrow." Here Clovis paused a monlent, and then continued: "One night, he and I were alone together. He was sad- der than ever. Wishing to cheer him as well as I could, I mentioned some words Gertrude had let fall when I last saw her, and which, I argued, spoke well for his chances. Hardly had I spoken, when he looked wildly in my face; the blood poured in torrents from his mouth, and he sank on the floor insensible. (' For a moment I was paralyzed. Then I ran to the door, and screamed for help. Charles was carried to his bed, from which he never rose again." Once more Clovis paused, as if to collect his thoutghts, and then continued: "I watched day and night by his side, but we all knew there was no hope. His faculties, which were entirely lost for a while, gradually returned, and he told us-exactly what the physicians'had predicted-that he felt no pain whatever. A little before his death, he told me all. Gertrude had been be-. trayed by a man he had often met at her house. The man's name he would never tell me. Indeed, I do not think he knew it himself; for he continually called him a stranger, and assured me once that he thought he knew; who the person was. That was all I ever knew of the cause of my brother's untimely end. He expired that night. "As Soon as the funeral was over, I hastened to Madame Gallahaut's cottage. I found it in the possession of a woman who has since married our village tailor.' "Dame Sewell!" cried Nora.    <pb n="326-327" xml:id="VAC6560-00000172"/> 326      DIkEAMS WITHN DREAMS. "Yes," replied Clovis. "What is the matter with you?" "Was she not foster sister to the Duke of Uphorn?" asked Nora. "She was," answered Clovis. Ah," said Nora, thoughtfully, "I understand now." "What do you understand?" "Do you remember the Duke's words, when he met us on the landing?" "Well?" cried Clovis, his face flushing. "His words, his looks, his cry, at the sight of your bro. ther's portrait-oh I I see all," said Nora. "You have jumped at a shrewd conclusion," replied Clo- vis; " but listen to what I have to say. There is more in the story than I know, or you can guess, my dear girl. That Up- horn was Gertrude's lover, I believe as well as you; that he was a false one, is not so well proved." "But your brother?" "Believed it? Yes. Proved it? No." "And on what grounds do you base your doubt?" "On evidence intrinsic and extrinsic. Uphorn's character, his whole life, give the lie to such an accusation. He is haughty and cold and peremptory, but there is nothing treacherous in him. He has the virtues of a Cato, and the honor of a Don Quixote. But that is not enough. I know he was the lover of Gertrude Gallahaut, and I believe she was his wife." "But then, why not publish it?" "I will tell you. As I said, I went to the cottage, and found it in the possession of Dame Sewell. She informed me Gertrude and her mother were gone--nobody knew whither. After some further questions, I returned to the castle. "I searched every part of the country, but could not find a single trace of the fugitives. So matters remained for six months; when, one night, I received a mysterious message, telling me to proceed to a certain part of the forest. I did so, and came to a poor hut, at the door of which Madame Galla- haut stood awaiting me. "Her story was brief, and told with an anger I never saw equalled. Gertrude was dead. A little girl was born. Where the child was, the mother swore no one should know. She had sent for me because she wished her daughter to be privately buried, and knew I had both will and power so to do. Ger- trude was buried by Father Wilfrid-Coffin, the mother, and myself being the only ones present. Shortly after the funeral,   DREAMS WITHN DREAMS.        327 the mother died also, and was buried. She never told me where the child was, and the secret seemed to be entombed with her." "But, if Gertrude was married, would she not have told her mother?" asked Nora. "I don't know," replied Clovis. "Women too often sacri- fice themselves for one they love." "But what object could the husband have in keeping the marriage a secret?" "Heaven knows. If Uphorn was the man, he was obliged to absent himself at the time; and, before he returned, the catastrophe had occurred. The whole matter was hushed up. He was not suspected. It was very natural that he should keep the secret, at least until he discovered his child." "Why?" "Because it was the interest of others that the child should not be found." "Can men be so wicked?" "Men can lie, and steal, and kill, Nora." The young girl shuddered, but said nothing. "Until very lately," continued Clovis, " such has been all I knew of the matter. I think I begin to see a little into it. Listen, my dear girl, and do not let the very winds of heaven carry my words away.  That little child Godfroy told you about, is the image of Gertrude Gallahaut." "And the child's name?" "Is Gertrude. Hush! I know more yet, but may not tell it now, You shall know all, when it is proper. Do you con- fide in me?" "I do."  Clovis drew her close to him, and kissed her forehead. They then took a long walk together under the shady old trees; adroitly dodged my lord Clodolphus, who passed very near them, and pursued their way through the greenwood. And so let them pass out of sight for the present.    <pb n="328-329" xml:id="VAC6560-00000173"/> 328      DREAMS WITHN DREAMS. CHAPTER XXIX. THE ARRIVAL OF THE PASTORALS AT THE CASTLE. THE Count and my lord Clodolphus, laving visited the barnyard, and separated for a while, once more met on the ter- race, where all the pastoral company, except Prytanis, had just arrived. The usual greetings were exchanged; Rosalla was welcomed; Ubald's wound was inquired after; Ardor and Simplicius were congratulated on their return, and hospitality grinned on the meeting. Verily," quoth my lord Clodolphus, " ye have lost divers entertaining things. Nevertheless, others, peradventure, may be in store. What saith Saint Augustine--" "No, you don't!" interrupted the Count. "Austin he is, and Austin he shall be. I won't stand that, you may depend upon it." "By George!" cried Ubald; "what a splendid cock t Iow he would fight! Why, he is a regular hero. "Ah, that he is," said the delighted Count. "Not bad for a dunghill," observed my lord Clodolphus, critically. The Count looked at the learned man with supreme chn- tempt. "Dunghill!" he cried. "Where are your eves?" "I tell you, that rooster is a dunghill," quoth my lord Clo- dolphus, " and there is no more to be said on the subject." "I tell you there is!" cried the Count, hotly. "There is a great deal more to be said on the subject. My rooster a dunghill! I like that. You, too, with your talk " "I can prove it," calmly said my lord Clodolphus. "You can't," replied the Count. I suppose you will try some of your confounded sophtry." Sophistry, not sophtry," said my lord Clodolphus, correct- ing him. ng No, I don't mean anything of he kind," answered the Count. "You are pretty free with your remarks. I mean sophtry. What do you know about hens? I suppose Julius Csesar taught you that. You ought to be ashamed of your- self. By George, sir! if I had the unblushing impudence to call myself an educated man, with the same breath that I used to call that noble animal a dunghill, I should go at once and commit suicide; I would. I would hang myself on a rope.   DREAMS WITHN DREAMS.       329 Said my lord Clodolphus: "No, you would not. With Cicero (Academicorum posteriorum liber primus ad M. Teren- tium Varronem), I answer, ' Non hiesitans respondebo- " "I dare say you do," answered the Count; "but, as I never asked Cicero anything about the matter, suppose you let him wait till I do." "Very well," quoth my lord Clodolphus. "I say you would not hang yourself, and you would not. Verily, if I thought you would, then should I apply to you the words of the great Thomas More, born in London A. D. 1480; entered Canterbury College, Oxford, A. D. 1497; became M. P. A. D. 1501; was appointed Judge of the Sheriff's Court in the city of London, A. D. 1510, was made Treasurer of the Exchequer, A. D. 1520; chosen Speaker of the House of Commons, A. D. 1523; intrusted with the Great Seal, A. D. 1530; executed on Tower Hill, A. D.-" "Lord love the man!" interrupted the Count; "he is insane. Suppose you stop that now. It seems to me, you take a long while to get at my rooster. Leave Caesar alone, leave history alone, leave everything alone-hang it, man  can't you talk like a respectable Christian? The idea," con- tinued the Count, turning to the company, " the idea of our being obliged to listen to such a long list of infernal dates, which have as much to do with the subject as the death of Nebuchadnezzar has to do with my back hair!" "Very well," quoth my lord Clodolphus, "I will stick to the point." "That's what you should have done an hour ago," replied the Count. Said my lord Clodolphus: I will do so. The origin of the ancient Britons " "There! there I there " cried the exasperated Count. "I would not hear another word; no, not if it saved me from the rack. Ugh!" he continued, with a jerk and a shiver; "ugh I the very notion has set me perspiring. Whew i But here they come. Hallo, Godfroy! Hallo, Nora  Hallo, all of you I Come along!" And, so saying, the Count performed the necessary intro- ductious, sent the baggage and animals up to the castle, escorted the whole company to the terrace, ordered wine, and disap- peared with Godfroy-for purposes hereinafter to be told-in the twinkling of an eye. Clovis and Nora were out walking.; The Countess soon called Rosalia to accompany her within. The rest stood or sat round the fountain, chatting cheerfully.    <pb n="330-331" xml:id="VAC6560-00000174"/> OtUU      DREAMS WITIIIN DREAMS. "Without any peradventure," quoth my lord Clodolphus,. "I see before me divers gentlemen who have lately worshipped at the shrine of the god Pan; who, according to a merry con- ceit of mine own, was not only a rural divinity of Arcadia, distinguished from the satyrs by goats' feet and horns, as like- wise, by hair verily shaggy, but he should also be considered a culinary deity, presiding over the kitchen, and giving his name to pans and pancakes. But this is facetious. To abandon jocularity, and come back to the serious, verily must I con- gratulate you. Pan, or Nature, some say, was the son of Mer- cury. Others give him, for parents. Jupiter and Hybris (which, if true, would not be very complimentary, since Hybris means a mongrel; a name one would hardly like to hear applied to one's own mother) ; while all agree that he was brother to the Parcte, or Fates. It is my opinion, however, he was not; for, considering the Fates could do just as they pleased, it is quite impossible that they should turn out so misshapen a specimen of a brother: albeit his father and mother, peradventure, had the most to do with that department of the manufacture. However, let that pass for what it is worth. Pan was the god of hunters, shepherds, and, in fine, all rustic people. There- fore may I well call your retreat the sylvan temple of Pan. And ye doubtless have turned this temple into the shrine of Cupid, singing, i Vivamus, mea Lesbia! atque amamus '-Let us live and love, oh, Lesbia mine! Verily that was gracefil. Verily that was appropriate." 9}4f "Yes," replied Ardor, sighing. "We have indeed been tantalized by the sight of connubial joys; while we, poor ex- iles, were banished from bliss!" "It was just awful," remarked Simplicius. "I sighed (according to fashion) at the remembrance of past what-do-you- call-ems, and Ardor did the same for the sake of his sweet- heart." "Shut up!" sternly said Ardor. "Know; fool, that ' a sweetheart' is vulgar." "And what should I say?" asked the discreet Simplicius. "You should say," replied Ardor, " a ladye, a Dulcinea, or --still better-a divinity." "Should I?" asked Simplicius. "Yes, you should," answered Ardor. "It is imperative." "Oh!" replied Simplicius; "if it is imperative, I have nothing more to say." "Thank luck 1" muttered Ardor.   DREAMS WITHN DREAMS.        331 - "Ah," quoth my lord Clodolphus, "what creatures we are of circumstances and fashion I! What saith Suetonius, speak- ing of Sylla when speaking of Caesar? 'Cesari multos Ma- rios inesse '-In Caesar there are many Mariuses. Verily, in fashion there are many devils. Why not sweetheart?" "Why not?" remarked Ubald, solemnly, for he. now be- gan to catch at the weakness of my lord Clodolphus; " why not? Ah, your lordship may well ask, Why not?" Said my lord Clodolphus: "I perceive you are a man of powerful discrimination." "It does not require a telescope to see the sun," replied Ubald, 'nor a great understanding to apprehend your lord- ship's merit." "The allegory is delicious," quoth my lord Clodolphus, de- lighted. "Verily am I confirmed in my opinion of your good sense. A man, in sooth, who can tell a flattering truth with- out flattering, is a great man. Sweetheart, indeedl And wherefore not sweetheart? Pliny tells us, if one crushed a liv- ing mole to death, the hand by which it was done could cure with a touch the toothache and the stomachache. Now love, like the royal hand in scrofulous cases, can cure divers maladies (not precisely the stomachache, but the heartache) by a touch yclept a kiss. Now, what is sweeter than such a cure? Noth- ing, I trow, unless it be the touch itself (yclept a kiss), which is doubtless delectable. For what saith Atheneus concerning the fly which lighted upon the cheek of the fair Malthius? 'Ut oscularetur,' that he might kiss, ' non ut pungeret-' " "At it again?" asked the Count, who came up at this mo- ment.  "Bless the man!  Eternally boring  somebody, of course! Can't I hammer into your head the idea, that nobody wants to hear all that trash? Come, Hollar shall judge be- tween us. I say, Hollar!" "Hallo!" replied that gentleman. "Can you honestly say you were interested?" asked the Count. "Interested in what?" inquired Hollar, who had been con- versing, we need hardly say, with Letitia. "Interested in what Clodolphus was saying," replied the Count. "To tell the truth," said Hollar, "I ought to be ashamed of myself, I know; but, really, I was not listening." "Of course you were not," replied the Count, "and nobody else, I bet. Who could, and keep sane? Now, you hear that,    <pb n="332-333" xml:id="VAC6560-00000175"/> 332      DREAM 3 WITHN DREAMS. Clodolphus? I am glad that, for once at least, you must ac knowledge yourself in the wrong." "But I do not," quoth my lord Clodolphus. "Far from it. I am not wrong. Verily--" "Hey ding diddle, the cat and the fiddle, the cow jumped over the moon," said the Count, derisively. "The cow jumped over the what?" asked my lord Clodol- phus, aghast. "The moon," replied the Count. The devil " quoth my lord Clodolphus, disdainfully. "I suppose that was the cow out of whose cream you churned green cheese." "Churn cheese, eh?" replied the Count. "Much you know about cheese. But I don't care. I don't say the moon is made of green cheese, and I don't say it is not. Until you prove the contrary, I stick to the cheese." "A man verily is not obliged to prove a negative," said my lord Clodolphus. "Then a man verily must not talk negatives," answered the Count.  But, of course, you are always right. My ioos- ter is a dunghill, Saint Austin is Saint Augustine, and ek cetera." "You have made two blunders in three words," quoth my lord Clodolphus. "First, you say 'ek,' when you should say 'et;' secondly, you say, 'and et cetera,' which, in sooth, is a superabundance of redundance." "I can't see why I am obliged to sing your notes," replied the Count, obstinately. "Why may I not say ' and ek cetera,' if I choose?" "' Oh I you can say anything, if you choose," said my lord Clodolphus. "You can call a horse a reptile, if you choose. You can call your dunghill a game cock, if you choose. I don't see anything to prevent you. But that don't .make you right. What said Daedalus-" "Never mind what DTedalus said," interrupted the Count. "Let us hear what you say. Or, rather, let me talk. Do you admit, that when the wind blows from the north, the trees bend toward the south?" "I do," quoth my lord Clodolphus. "And," pursued the Count, "do you admit that you would drink good brandy, if you could get it?" "I do," quoth my lord Clodolphus. "Before the flood-" ".Confound the flood!" testily cried the Count. "Well,   DREAMS WITHN DREAMS.       333 then; just as sure as the north wind blows south, and you would drink brandy; just so sure will I say ek, and not et cetera." Said my lord Clodolphus, taking snuff: "Q. E. D. Your last argument is the best I ever heard you make. It is one that verily admits of no answer whatever-the which, in sooth, I cannot say generally of your reasonings." "Ha I ha! ha!" laughed the Count. "And (which is more wonderfuD, for once, you and I agree." "Your altercations," said Sir Wolfgang, smiling, " remind me of a story I once heard. Once upon a time there lived, somewhere, two persons, whose names I cannot recall-" "When and where did they live?" asked my lord Clodol- phus. "The precise period I have forgotten," replied Sir Wolf- gang. "As to the locality, it has escaped my recollection." '"I protest against that story," quoth my lord Clodolphus, "for divers reasons. Xenophon informs us that Bacchus and Ariadne were good subjects for eating rooms. Why not? But this is not the point." "I should think not," growled the Count. "The real question-" began my lord Clodolphus, when he was interrupted by the Count. "The real question," said 4hat gentleman, " is to let Wolf- gang alone. Can't you let a fellow talk, without butting head- foremost into the conversation without being asked? Merciful powers!" And here the Count began to puff like an exasperated loco- motive. "Well, never mind that," said Sir Wolfgang, smiling. "You can settle it, you know, by and by. The names of my hero and heroine were John and Jill. They lived in England, near an elevated range of hills, in the days when pigs were swine." "Stop " cried my lord Clodolphus.  "Pigs are swine even unto this day. Verily I object to this false kind of aiie- gory. Some say a pig is a young hog, both being of the genus Sus. Never mind that. Is a hog a swine? Yes; a hog is a swine. Is a pig a swine? Yes; a pig is a swine. Assume that a pig is a young hog. What then? Let us proceed syl- logistically-thus: All hogs are swine. A pig is a young hog. Therefore a pig is a young swine." "Oh, indeed!" sneered the Count. Let me give you a 'tit' for your ' tat.'"    <pb n="334-335" xml:id="VAC6560-00000176"/> 334      DREAMS WrrHN DREAMS. "What do you mean to give me?" asked my lord Clodol- phus. "A 'tit,'" replied the Count. "I don't want any of your 'tits,'" quoth my lord Clodol- phus. "Wait," replied the Count. "You like a syllogism, so here's one: All hens lay eggs. A female chicken is a young hen. Therefore a female chicken lays young eggs. Oh11 logic is beautiful indeed. Give me common sense, and I will beat your logic round the park. Only give me common sense- that's all." "I wish to goodness somebody would," quoth my lord Clodol- phus. "I never heard such barefaced sophisms in my life before. All hens lay eggs, do they? No, they don't. First of all, dead hens lay no eggs. Secondly-but I am not going to argue. What I say, is truth. Dixi. I positively assert that pigs are swine, albeit there are divers kinds of pigs. First, there is your wild boar-such as slew Adonis; such, also, as was cele- brated in the Calydonian hunt (near Calydon, a city of XEtolia, on the Evenus. See II. 2,460; Thuc. 3,102), wherein the un- fortunate Meleager (son of CEneus and Althea) figured consid- erably; which boar, it is said, was as large as a bill, and was hunted by Theseus, Jason, Castor, Pollux, Mopsusi the afore- said Meleager, and Alalanta, a fair huntress who slew the boar. Then you have, in sooth, sundry other kinds of swine-such as sows, pigs with curly tails, and those not blessed with the same. Again, children are wont sportively to call young swine 'piggy-wiggies,' according to what may be called philological nicknames-such as, for horse, horsey; for pig, piggy; for cat-" "Oh, I am choking!" growled the ount. "For cat, catty-" "For mercy's sake I Clodolphus-" "For nurse, nursey." "I'll pitch into you, if you don't stop." "Well, then, Wolfgang, verily must you proceed." "John," continued Sir Wolfgang, "being in want of water, determined to ascend a mountain near by, for the avowed pur- pose of procuring a pailfull-" "Bless your heart alive I " interrupted the Count. "You a'n't going to give us ' Jack and Jill,' are you?" Sir Wolfgang laughed. "Well," continued the Count, "I can save you a deal of trouble. The whole story, Clodolphus, lies in one verse:   DRI 'EAMS IrrHN DREAMS.      335 "Jack and Jill went up a hill, To get a pail of water, Jack fell down and broke his crown, And Jill came tumblng after." "So," continued Sir Wolfgang, now laughing outright, "so. your arguments always end in both of you climbing an im- mense hill for nothing, and both of you tumbling to the bot- tom, pail and all." "A nice sentiment, indeed," quoth my lord Clodolphus, turning red. "And," said the Count, "not very far from the truth." Whereat my lord Clodolphus grinned at the Count, and the Count grinned at my lord Clodolphus. CHAPTER XXX. CONTAINING IMPORTANT MATTERS NOT APPARENT AT FIRST SIGHT. "HA!" cried Sir Wolfgang, as he saw Gabriel coming out on the terrace with the harp; " now we are about to see the sun rise."               X As he spoke, the ladies joined them, and the conversation became general. Music being the order of the day, each took his or her turn, and many an old ballad rose through the trees, and floated off toward the pigeon house, the wind blowing in that direction. "Give me the thing," cried Wolfgang. "I want our mod- est friend here to tune up." Anselm blushed, as the eyes of the whole company were directed on him. "I would rather not," he faltered. "I dare say," replied Simplicius; "I dare say, my boy; but you've got to, for all that." "Shut up!" cried- Ardor, knocking his hat over his dis- creet eyes. "You leave me alone," replied Simplicius, drawing his head into his shoulders like a turtle. "Go in " said the Count, encouragingly, to Auselm.    <pb n="336-337" xml:id="VAC6560-00000177"/> tJW       *LIl!lM   W lJ llJ JJiKEAX L And Anselm went in: "Spirit most akin to woe, Pity, why dost move me so? See this beggar child in tears, Old in sorrow, young in years. Think on such, complaining soul I Minor troubles to console. Thou mayst on thy pillow sleep, They must to the kennel creep. Thou, 'mid friends, wilt close thine eye, They must in a hovel die. Justice gives the recompense- When-is known to Providence. Here-hereafter-none can sayv-- Heaven appoints the judgment day. Here on earth no mortal knows What are pleasures, what are woes." "Is this your own composition?"5 asked Ubald. "Yes," replied Anselm. "And is it founded on fact, or only fanciful?" pursued the other. "It is founded on fact," answered Anselm. Ubald grew thoughtful, and was about to speak, when my lord Clodolphus struck in. "Verily," said that learned man, "verily would I fain give mouth.  What is pleasure? Is it pursuit? Is it possession?  Is it progress?  Is it anticipa- tion?  Who can say? Does it lie in the senses. Let us see. Is it in the eye? One may ask, Why? Others may ask, Why not? It is in the eye, or it is not in the eye-that is sure. Then again, I ask, Is pleasure all in my eye, or not at all in my eye? or partly in my eye, and partly not in that optic? Why my eye?   Why not my eye?    Such are the questions. If my eye, why? If not my eye, why not? What saith Pro- pertius? ' Murrheaque in Parthis pocula cocta focis '--The Murrhean vases baked in Parthian furnaces. But we--'nos bibimus vitro '-we drink out of glass, as Martial hath it. Pleasure, indeed, is baked in Parthian furnaces-the which, verily, may be used allegorically for our passions. But I really forget what I was talking about." "Oh! you do, do vou?" said the Count. "Well, then, I will tell you. This gentleman (pointing to Ubald) was talk- ing, when you interrupted him, by asking a long string of ab- surd questions about your eye, which nobody could answer if he would, and which, goodness knows, nobody would answer if he could. Of course, Julius Caesar marched in. I wonder at you, I do. Since you like quotations, I will tell you the   DREAMS WrrIm DREAMS.             337 only one I know. I remember it because it reminds me of you. In Shakspeare's play of Ceesar, there is a scene begin- ning, 'Thunder and lightning.      Enter Caesar, in his night- gown.'   "' And what of it?" asked my lord Clodolphus. "I am  going to tell you," replied the Count.  "When you talk, we begin with thunder and lightning; but it always ends with Caesar in a nightgown, with bare shanks, and a woollen nightcap on his head, with a long tassel bobbing at the end." Happily, here the dispute ended, by Ardor's beginning to sing a ballad, called, by him, Reginald Pedro. REGINALD PEDRO. To the wars rode Reginald Pedro, Unto the wars rode he. His horse was the fleetest you ever saw, As off he galloped to the war; As fine, in fact, as e'er rider bore, So splendid a horse was he. Gallantly rode his master, Dressed in a garment green; His coat of mai was terribly bright, And never before such a beautiful sight As yonder peerless and stainless knight Was by lady or chevalier seen. Hey, ho, horse!  Hey, ho, horse! Gallop on for life! Whisk thy tail noble and free, Bear the rider who straddles thee, Bear the pink of chivalry To the glorious strife. Clang! Clash  ! the swords are crossed. Hurrah! the struggle begins. Parry and thrust, cut and slash, Hew the enemy into hash. Cross your swords. Clang! Clash! Good for the party who wins. And where is Reginald Pedro? Oh where, oh where is the man 9 The fight is long, the fight is fierce; The crles of the wounded the welkin pierce. Now is the time for carte and tierce, If ever since time began. Bold is Reginald Pedro, Doubtless exceedingly brave; But on the field is nowhere seen That dauntless knight in vesture green, With his blazing shield and scimitar keen, Where the ranks in violence wave. * Julius Caesar, act ii, scene ii. 15    <pb n="338-339" xml:id="VAC6560-00000178"/> *338       DRIBAS WHN DREAMS. Alas! and is the warrior gone?  Is he trodden down by the horse? Lies he upon the crimnson bed Where many a hero, to glory led, Sleeps the sleep of the warrior dead, A pale and mangled corse? Or has he crawled to some'limpid spring, A draught of water to drink, As many a noble knight bath done When the battle field has been lost and won; Drank a draught 'neath the scorching sun, Then feebly down to sink? Glory to the dauntless hearts Who fought for us, and died. A monument to the hero raise Of gratitude and heartfelt praise. Let the monument stand to the last of days, And with goodness the palm divide. No, no, no. No, no, no! Reginald is not there. Courage is good, but he had none: He had legs, and so to run When the slaughter first begun, Was Reginald Pedro's care. To the forest off he flies, Where he a maiden sees. "Beautiful maiden! be my wife. I have come from a terrible strife, Where they battle unto the knife, Where he is wise who fees. Beautiful maiden, oh! be mine, I thy charms adore. I have a sword; I have a shield; I come hot from a battle field, Where one doth win, the other yield, When the struggle is o'er. I am Reginald Pedro, Reginald Pedro the brave. I run better than I fight; So if thou choose me for thy knight, Thou canst easily conquer me quite, And make me thy humble slave. "Oh, sir stranger! I cannot be thine. Constance is my name: Constant to valor; constant to ruth; Constant to virtue; constant to truth, Constant to all but thy-like, in sooth, For I never am constant to shame. "Honor I love, duty I prize, Base dishonor I scorn. Never thine is destinym ine. How can virtue to vice incline? What are pearls to filthy swine Reginald Pedro, begone."   DREAMS WITHN DREAMS.        339 "Ah!" quoth-Reginald. Pedro: "Innocence ever will be Pure and prompt, dauntless and bold, Old when young, and young when old, Unto passion frightfully cold, It never will do for me. "To some metropolis I will fly Where my riches may gain Glory and pomp, place and power. Gold can enter a lady's bower There at any capricious hour; Never knocking in vain." Said my lord Clodolphus: "Not bad, upon my word. Upon my word, not bad.  What saith Horace?  'Dummodo risum excutiat sibi, non hic cuiquam parcit amico '-Provided he can excite to laughter, not his friend even doth he spare-" "Now, stop a moment," interrupted the Count. "I want to ask you a question." "Fire away," quoth my lord Clodolphus. "Will you just have the goodness to inform me," continued the Count, " what the deuce that quotation has to do with the subject? I have often had a similar question on the tip of my tongue, but, somehow or another, the opportunity has slipped by unheeded. Pray, tell me now, what has all that rigmarole of your friend Horace to do with Reginald Pedro?" 4"If you wish to know," replied my lord Clodolphus, '"verily must you let me begin at the beginning. When the tower of Babel was first erected-" "In mercy to all here present," cried the Count; in mercy to yourself, who must have a conscience; in mercy to common sense, so often outraged by your observations, desist. If you will answer my question, do so; but if we have to begin with the tower of Babel, keep quiet, or you will tempt me to do something desperate." "Let me speak, and you will verily--" began my lord Clodolphus. "No, I won't," interrupted he Count. "Hallo, Ubald! what's the matter?" "Nothing," replied Ubald, seeing all eyes were turned on him; " only I have heard from this young man some very im- portant intelligence. Count, I am about to ask you a strange favor. Will you permit me to stay here a few days longer than the extent of your invitation?" "Stay a century, if you will," replied the Count, good- humoredly. "Stay forever. The favor is your company, not my hospitality." i    <pb n="340-341" xml:id="VAC6560-00000179"/> 340      DREAMS WITHN DREAMS. c Neatly expressed," quoth my lord Clodolphus. "It does you great credit, Bertrand. You are really improving, and, maybe, one day you will be something approaching a civilized being." b  Oh indeed!" cried the Count. "I am much obliged to you for your good opinion. You are cool enough, goodness knows! I suppose impudence is philosophy." "It is," replied my lord Clodolphus. "The philosophy of impudence is verily an exceeding beautiful science. Thus: you have the impudence to call that draggle-tailed rooster of yours a game cock--" "My what?" cried the exasperated Count. "Your draggle-tail rooster," quoth my lord Clodolphus. "My rooster a draggle-tail?" retorted the Count. You are a draggle-tail yourself." Calmly then proceeded my lord Clodolphus: "Very good. You admit, then, that your old dunghill is a draggle-tail? Very well. That being admitted-" "Ah, but it isn't admitted," interrupted the Count. "I deny all you say, all you ever have said, and all you ever will say.17 Now there was a lurking grin on the intelligent lineaments of the learned Clodolphus; which a discreet observer would have accounted for by supposing that philosophic man was per- forming that exquisite manceuvre commonly known as chaffing a fellow. However that may be, he proceeded calmly in his profound observations. "Verily," quoth he, " what I say is true. I tell you, Ber-. trand, you are grievously in error. Is a stone confined to inac- tion, and obliged to remain motionless, until moved by a supe- rior force? I think so. Is a fish confined to water, where it may swim, dive, wriggle a little, pursue its prey, and do divers of the like performances; but may never aspire to graze on the mead, or sit gayly perched upon the woodland bough? I believe so. Is the reptile cold blooded, and given to crawl on its belly, produce eggs, perchance, and breathe the vital air (with the exception of the tadpole, erroneously styled a polli- wog), but can never impress upon its young a Christian's vir- tues, duties, and responsibilities? I suppose so. Is the bird verily covered with feathers, but never gifted with four legs? I fancy so. Is the beast whether rejoicing in paws, hoofs, hands or claws, an irrational animal, never hoping to rse from instinct to reason? I think so. Very well. What do we   DREIAMS WITHN DREAr S.      341 learn from all this? From the mineral to the vegetable, from the vegetable to the fish, from the fish to the reptile, from the reptile to the bird, from the bird to the beast, we learn that mineral, vegetable, fish, reptile, bird, and beast show a common likeness as between beast, bird, reptile, fish, vegetable, and mineral; for if the mineral, vegetable, fish-" "You a'n't going to begin again?" cried the Count. "By the powers, man! I would rather have a tooth wrenched out any day, than listen to you, I would. I would infinitely prefer being roasted on a hot gridiron. Who ever supposed, or could sup- pose, or wanted to suppose, that a stone could crawl round; a fish could roost on a tree; a bird had four legs; or a polliwog could impress on its young a Christian's moral duties and re- sponsibilities? Who ever did? What a wonderful imagina- tion you must have, even to dream of such nonsense! Ah, there is a summons to discuss something better than your talk. Ladies and gentlemen, let us go in and discuss lunch. I know you will find cold chicken, and the best wine, better than the kind of stuff we have just been swallowing." "Cold "chicken, eh?" quoth my lord Clodolphus, facetiously, for the idea of something to eat usually roused his jocularity. "Cold chicken, eh? I hope, Bertrand, you have not killed that draggle-tailed dunghill rooster of yours for us?" Whereat the Count grinned, and they all walked amicably in together. - . . . CHAPTER XXXI. SHOWING HOW GODFROY SUCCEEDED IN HS COURTSHP; HOW HE TOOK THE FORTRESS OF LOVE BY STORM; TOGETHER WITH OTHER INCIDENTS. GODFROY and Eate were betrothed. The gentleman hav- ing a huge contempt for the proprieties of life, and disdaining the received notion that one week's acquaintance is not enough preface to the solemnities of an engagement, went in (as the saying is) to win, and won, too. Being repulsed in his first attack on the stronghold of the lady's affections, he turned again, and planned another assault. Deeming allies useful, he immediately bought the Ctunt's \    <pb n="342-343" xml:id="VAC6560-00000180"/> 842      DREAMS WITHN DREAMS. good will by an enormous number of hens (which were added to the stock, much to the Countess's disgust), and, through him, reached the potent ears of Uphorn. The Count needed very little encouragement from Godfroy to go instantly to the Duke, and to rush in medias res forthwith. Now Uphorn was Kate's lawful guardian; the match was a good one, and Godfroy knew Uphorn would urge it. Kate," argued he, " scarcely knows the Duke. She will hardly dare speak, and will at least give me hopes." And in this conjecture he was right. Kate, when kindly questioned by Uphorn, admitted that her only objection was the hastiness of the proposal, and her little knowledge of God- froy's character. The Duke then spoke highly of him, and convinced the girl, by showing her how much her own predi- lections were supported in so high a quarter. The Count, of course, was at her in the twinkling of an eye; to say nothing of Nora and Letty: and the poor girl was positively bullied into the engagement before she knew where she was. After all, Kate was not unhappy. It was a rather sudden affair; but then, as Godfroy remarked, there were "peculiar circumstances." So the victim of peculiar circumstances was kissed (but not by Godfroy, let us trust), and congratulated, and envied, and happy, and proud, and all that. And the happy man was shook by the hand, and poked in the ribs, and winked at, and slapped on the back. And everything, in fine, was done in the most genteel manner " Ah," said my lord Clodolphus, " ye are indeed to be en- vied.' Godfroy hath caught a pearl indeed; seeing that the lady is amiable, and pretty, and nice, and neat, and beautiful, and lovely, and clean, and witty, and accomplished, and sub- lime, and musical, and artistic, and-" "When he gets through the dictionary, wake me up," the Count was heard to mutter. "What do you say, Bertrand?" mildly inquired my lord Clodolphus. "Oh, the devil!" growled the Count. "I do not understand," quoth my lord Clodolphus. "Who wants to hear all that?" asked the Count. No- body." "' But somebody does want to hear it," said Kate. I am sure I could listen to the list of my attractions for an hour. Go on, my lord. You left off at my being artistic, I believe." ' Mercy!" groaned the Count. She is actually setting him on."   DREAMS WITHN DREAMS.       343 t N," quoth mylord Clodolphus; "I think I have said enough." "I should think you had," murmured the Count. "I shall stop," quoth my lord Clodolphus. C I should think it was about time," growled the Count. Otherwise," continued my lord Clodolphus, otherwise I should tell you what was said on the subject by Saint Augus. tine---- "Austin," said the Count. "Augustine," replied my lord Clodolphus. "Pooh! pooh!" cried the Count. "I suppose you will quote poetry from him next. I like poetry, but you will never make me believe Saint Austin wrote any." "I will never try," quoth my lord Clodolphus. "Poetry  Much you know about it. I do not believe you like it at all." on t you hear me tell you I do?" asked the Count. Said my lord Clodolphus: I. cannot help that." "Is not my word sufficient?" hotly asked the Count. Said my lord Clodolphus: "'o! For instance: you think you like cauliflowers--" And I do like cauliflower," interrupted the Count. Said my lord Clodolphus: "Pardon me; you do not. You only like the taste of cauliflower. You must distinguish be- tween the thing and its taste. Thus: you would not put a cauliflower in a nosegay, I believe?" "I don't know that," sail the Count. "How don't you know that?" asked my lord Cloddolphus, aghast. "Never you mind," replied the Count. "You are not going to entrap me. I know your way of proving anything you please, by decoying people into admissions, and then com- ing down on them suddenly. I am not going to be caught by that bait," "nBut surely," pleaded my lord Clodolphus, "surely you can have no objections to admit that a cauliflower would not be it for a nosegay? Come; I suppose you will veriy o as far as that? "No, I will not," answered the Count, firmly. "How am I to know what devil's snare is behind your cauliflower? Thus ended this discussion. And now we may as well take up the thread of Albert's adventures on this memorable day, and have our narrative in order, so that we can push on more rapidly to an end.  o    <pb n="344-345" xml:id="VAC6560-00000181"/> 844       DREAMS WITHN DREAMS. The blow from Clovis's hilt glanced from his head, or he never would have spoken more. When lie returned to con- sciousness, he found himself alone with my lord Clodolphus, who, in few words, explained how he happened to be there. Albert looked at him, hardly understanding what he said; so the other conducted him to his room, and left him on his bed. When he returned, Albert was gone. A letter lay on the table, including another directed to Clovis. The first ran thus: "I but awaited your departure. I thank you for your kindness. I have touched nothing. I will neither eat, drink, nor sleep in this house. I beg one favor. Will you hand the enclosed letter-first reading it yourself-to the Count's son? You are an older man than I. Therefore judge whether to give it or not. I trust entirely to your discretion." The letter to Clovis was as follows: "All between us is at an end. Yet much remains to be paid you back. Blood will not satisfy me now. Until we meet." My lord Clodolphus held the letter awhile in his hand, and stood quietly before the fire, profoundly meditating. At length he roused himself, and, tearing both letters up, threw the frag- ments into the fire. "  No," he said to himself. "To be forewarned, is verily to be forearmed; but Clovis is a match for that young man, and it will come better from me. Yes, it will come better from me." So thinking, he repaired to Clovis, and had a long inter- view with him; stating the substance of the letters, informing him why he burned them, and advising him in such a kind, sen- sible way, that Clovis hardly knew him for the same person, who was always up to the ears in quotations. Meanwhile, Albert went his way to Toservem's inn. His knees shook as he walked, and he staggered like a drunken man; but he reached the tavern at last, where he accounted for his appearance by stating he had been violently thrown from his horse. He asked for a private room, and, being conducted thither by Ernest himself (who did not recognize him in his dis- guise), threw himself heavily down on the bed, where he slept until night. He awoke from his slumber, or rather stupor, shivering. He was already much better, except for the swelling on his face, which pained him greatly. He called for a light. "I shall probably remain here some time," he said to Ernest, as he entered with candles. "What is your price?"   DREAMS WIrrIN DREAMS.        345 Ernest named it. "Here it is, in advance," replied Albert. "I will give as much again, if I am not annoyed by impertinent curiosity. Do you understand?-double pay for quiet." Ernest understood the part relative to the double pay quite clearly. "I see you understand," said Albert. "Let me have sup- per now." "Hre?" asked Ernest, with round eyes. What does the fool mean?" cried Albert, impatiently. "Nothing, sir; nothing," replied Ernest, leaving the room. Tosefvem had sense enough to see that no ordinary travel- ler was lodging in his inn; for, although Albert was meanly dressed, for the intended design of concealment, and was, more- over, not to be recognized on account of his swelled features, still his manner and bearing betrayed him. "Whoever he is," said Ernest to himself, L he is not what he seems. No peasant would have ordered me about that way, I know. And no peasant has hands like his." So saying, the innkeeper bustled about to make his guest comfortable, and finally Albert was left alone. He had received a physical as well as a mental shock. He was so nervous, that, when Ernest once opened the door, he leaped up in alarm, and shook afterward as if stricken by the palsy. When alone, he gave vent once more to his passions. It would have been frightful, could a spectator have watched him unobserved. He walked up and down the room at first in a perfect frenzy of impotent rage, cursing and blaspheming like a fiend. Never once did his perverted soul turn the awful les- son he had received to a proper account. Never once did he think that he had struck the first blow, and that he had com- pelled Clovis to act in self defence. Never once did he call to mind, that, if his former friend had spoken harshly, it was under one of the most aggravating circumstances that can happen to extenuate the thoughts, words, and deeds done in anger. Never once. Clovis had insulted-had nearly killed him-nay, had not killed him, but dared to spare a life he had stained with dis. honor. "I would set him on a slow fire," muttered Albert. "I would have him linger in torments. Oh! can men sell themselves to Satan? I would accept his terms, for the one idea how to have revenge." He paced up and down the room. "I have it!" he cried at last, with a terrible laugh. "The child-his own brother's !5'    <pb n="346-347" xml:id="VAC6560-00000182"/> 346      DREAMS WITrIN DREAMS. child-I know she is-I am sure she is-I feel it by the hate I bear her. He shall seek her high and low-shall meet her, at last, where he would rather find her a corpse And, with this devilish determination, e actually hugged himself, and again laughed that terrible agf. Was this Albert D'Esterre, the once bble intellect, who entered the world with all the high spirits and whole-souled emulation of a boy? So passion changes man. So will we recognize the damned on the day of judgment. And now began the fearful retribution which dogged Albert's steps until the end. Whether Satan really took him at his word, or whether his nerves never recovered the shock occasioned by Clovis's blow, must remain matters for conjec- ture. Whichever hypothesis we take, the fact remains the same. As he laughed, he thought some one had entered the room, and was looking over his shoulder. He turned. No; the door was locked. He must have been mistaken. He began to re- consider his plans. It would be easy to kidnap the child, and the rest was easy. There were many disbanded soldiers round, who would do anything for gold. The disappearance of the child could never be traced to him. - He would have her con- veyed far away; place her under the charge of a woman he knew; bring her up in every vice, and amid every kind of profligacy; for ten years he would keep Clovis in suspense, just administering sufficient hope to keep him on the rack; and then they should meet-" Again that feeling as if somebody was leaning over him. Again he turned. No; he must have again been mistaken. He continued thinking, thinking, thinking. Such and such soldiers were poor enough, and ruffianly enough, to do any. thing. Everything seemed to favor him. :' We will see, he said, if the fiend-" Again that feeling of somebody leaning over him, This time he wheeled round rapidly, but saw nothing. He looked round the room, peeped under the bed, examined the closets, No; the room and closets were empty, and the door locked, No one could have entered. What could it be? Once more he resumed thought. He fixed upon the town, named the woman, and arranged how he would. first commun nicate to Clovis, by forged evidence if pecessary, the idea that Gertrude was his brother's child; how he would lead him here and there on a useless search;' how, sometimes, he would send   DREAMS WITHN DREAMS.       347 him word the child was dead; how, when the first grief was past, he would again revive hope; how-       . Again that invisible presence. Again he turned. This time he trembled. Hle recovered himself by an effort. "It must be fancy," he said. "I have received a severe blow. I will lie down, and think more to-morrow." He undressed, still thinking, extinguished the light, and went to bed. But hardly had he lain down, when that horrible something seemed hovering over him. He could battle with terror no more. He leaped from his bed, lighted his candle, and lay down again; nor, after that night, was he ever known to sleep without a light burning in his room. Let us now return to the castle. "Kate," said Godfroy to that young lady, as they were seated on the broken bench in the park known before in this excellent history as the spot where the story of little Gertrude was narrated; "Kate, don't you wonder, now, who that child can be?" What child?" asked Kate. ' The one I found in the forest," replied Godfroy. "Certainly I do," said Kate. So -do I," observed her lover. "I have half a mind to make some inquiries, and see if I can discover any clue. You have never seen her. She is really an uncommon child." "I should like to see her very mucl," remarked Kate. "What do you think of it, my lord Clodolphus?" asked Godfroy, as that gentleman walked up. "Think of what?" inquired my lord Clodolphus. "Of-  But you never heard about her," answered God- froy.  I found a little girl in the forest, who has quite an aris- tocratic air, around whose birth there seems to hang some mys- tery." "I should 'let it hang, then," said my lord Clodolphus, dryly. "You would, would you?" asked Godfroy, doubtfully. "I would," quoth my lord Clodolphus. "There is not likely to be much worth knowing in that quarter." "You think so?" asked Godfroy. "I do," quoth my lord Clodolphus. "The chances are verily a thousand to one, the girl herself would not thank you for your pains. Wherefore? Forasmuch, in sooth, as a doubt is better than an unpleasant certainty." "That is true," assented Godfroy.    <pb n="348-349" xml:id="VAC6560-00000183"/> Said my lord Clodolphus "My dear young friend, take my advice, and never meddle too rashly in matters which do not concern you. Verily must discretion be trained like a hawk. You should first lure it-that is to say, teach impulse to obey the voice of prudence, even as hawks are taught to know the voice and lure; albeit I once essayed to subdue a hawk, the which did bite my thumb right lustily. Then must you in- struct your mind in the art of judgment; even as the falcon, the gerfalcon, the saker, the lanner, the merlin, the hobby, the goshawk, and the sparrowhawk are instructed in the appropria- tion of game. Nor must you omit the using of your faculties according to their capacities; even as the falcon tender is set at mallards, the gerfalcon at herons, the saker at cranes, the lanner at pheasants, the Barbary falcon at partridges, the mer- lin at larks, the goshawk at hares, and the sparrowhawk at blackbirds. I pass over details, such as hoodwinking, jessies, lunes, bewits, creances, and divers others to be found in the hawk dictionary by whoso listeth. I pass these over, I say, merely remarking, that virtue and vice are antagonistic." Now what my lord Clodolphus meant by the last part of his speech, and by what complicated logical evolutions he arrived at his moral conclusion from his premises, must remain a mystery forever. Suffice it to say, that he smiled benignly on the two, as much as if he observed, "You are welcome to my wisdom, my dear young friends." "How do you remember all you know?" asked Kate. "Verily, my dear lady," quoth my lord Clodolphus, "I proceed systematically. In this matter, I confess, I had great difficulties; but I succeeded by composing some unworthy verses, which fixed the same in my mind. My poetry is worth listening to." "I am sure of that," said Kate. \"It hath truly a smack of Parnassus," quoth my lord Clo. dolphus, solemnly. "Remind me to give each of you a copy, It goes thus: "On a rock stood a damsel, Lonely and sad: Beautiful damsel, Why art not glad?

No merlin, no hobby, No goshawk indeed, Who gobbles up hares, So notorious for speed. "I hoodwinked the same With jessies and caps, With lunes and with fixings, And manifold straps; With creances, bewits, And bells, I declare: But he now has escaped, And flown up in the air." "Beautiful l" cried Kate and  Godfroy, clapping their hands. "Why, my lord," said Kate, "I never knew you were a poet before. You appear in a new character every day. Is there no end, positively, to your accomplishments?" "Truly," quoth my lord Clodolphus complacently, "I do not think it bad myself." "You have only to add one thing to make it perfect," said Kate. "And what is that?" asked my lord Clodolphus, anxiously. "Give me a piece of paper," replied Kate. "Thank you," she added, as my lord Clodolphus supplied her with the article in question, which he produced from his pocket in a very crum- pled and dirty condition; for he generally carried a quantity of stationery and a number of books about his person, which cargo gave him a deformed and bunchy appearance. "You must have something like this for a beginning," said Kate, after she had rapidly dashed off a verse.  "Not mine, of course.  My doggerel would spoil your poem. But you can better the idea, you know." "Read it, damsel," quoth my lord Clodolphus, intensely jnterested. So Kate read, her voice supplying the false prosody which graced the verse: Sing, Muses, of hawks, Sing, Calliope; Sing, Clio; sing also, Melpomene; Urania, Thalia, Terpsichore, Polymnia, Erato, And Euterpe. i    <pb n="350-351" xml:id="VAC6560-00000184"/> outs       DiRlAMSJ WITHlN DREfllAMS. Said my lord Clodolphus: "Verily this is classical. Verily this is lovely. Verily, maiden, thou art a wonder. For what saith Seneca, in Octavia? ' Vincit vultus haec Tyndarios Qui moverunt horrida bella.' The which I myself have translated thus: Her beauty above Helen's 'soars, Which caused so many horrid wars. Yet have you not only excelled Helen in poesy, but the divine Sappho in verse; showing excellent sound discretion in choos. ing the subject you adorn, and a happy tact in carrying out the magnificence of the idea. Verily, since I see you can appre- ciate the sublime, permit me to give mouth to a heroic poem I have written." "By all means," said Kate.  "Let us hear it." Thereat my lord Clodolphus, waxing enthusiastic, did recite the following beautiful effusion of genius. "I call it," quoth he, "The Death of Thersites. He was one of the heroes of the Iliad." Sing, Muse, Thersites and his death, and burial likewise, And where in gory, glorious, blood-stained, cold, damp earth he lies; For he died upon a bed, he expired on a blanket, Small grace to fortune for the thing, and hence he didn't thank it. Achilles he stood weeping by, with Hector by his side; And Ajax verily was there, and Paris with his bride; And Priam and Deiphobus, and Agamemnon too, And divers other chieftains of the marvellous great crew; And Diomed, and Nestor, and Ulysses, wise for three; And they all were at his bedside aweeping piteously. Then, when they thought the man was dead, they wrapped him in a sheet, And burned his clay-cold body, as is for corpses meet; And they went home, and went to sleep, and soundly slept in bed: Thus Thersites was buried, forasimuch as he was dead. "There I " quoth my lord Clodolphus, when he had made an end of reciting, "I think, verily, that the unity is complete. You have the alye8e ea, the death scene, weeping friends, etc. Then the return home. There is, you see, no involving of the plot. It is simple, plain, to the point, not too long, and not too short." "Anything you write, my lord, would be too short," said Kate. "In sooth, maiden, you are partial," quoth my lord Clot dolphus, brightening with pleasure, and rubbing his hands. "Nevertheless, many a true word, as saith the old. adage, is   DREAMS WITHN DREAMS.        351 said' in jest; and you may be right. I think, if my humble muse hath any merit, it is the absorbing interest I give unto my lucubrations. 'Now, in the death of Thersites, you are in. voluntarily carried away. If you begin it, you cannot stop, so to speak, until you have finished. What saith Horace? ' Scri- bendi recte sapere est et principium et fons;' which may be thus translated: ' The root and base of good writing is to be wise.' Now-interest is verily the wisdom of fiction. Interest, I trow, is the real soul of success in all great works. Take the ' Jerusalem Delivered,' for instance. Begin it, and you cannot lay the work down until you have finished the same. In sooth, I have often thought my style not unlike Tasso's." At this, Godfroy and Kate nearly lost their gravity. "Just so," continued my lord Clodolphus, complacently. "I have compared myself with divers others, such as Christo. pher Marlow, Spenser; Petrarch, and Virgil; but I find, after all, Tasso verily comes nearer me than any other." [' Look what a queer shape that bough has," cried Godfroy, pointing, as he spoke, to the crooked bough of a neighboring tree. Kate and my lord Clodolphus turned their eyes in that direction. Godfroy and his betrothed laughed heartily. My lord Clodolphus looked at it solemnly. The truth was, that the young people wanted in excuse to laugh, as they knew it would mortally offend their companion if he supposed they were laugh. ing at him. "I do not see anything ludicrous in that bough," said my lord Clodolphus, gravely, after he had contemplated it solemnly a few minutes. "Will you have the goodness to point out wherein lieth the facetiousness thereof?" "Oh I " replied Godfroy, " you know a ridiculous thing is killed by an explanation." "I do not know that," quoth my lord Clodolphus. "Just try." "Well," said Godfroy, ," don't you see that crook?" "If you would not laugh so much," said my lord Clodol. phus, testily, " verily I might catch an idea. All I hear, as it is, indeed, is, ' That--ha! ha! ha!--crooked-- ha! ha! ha ' What's the joke?" "' Positively, my lord," said Godfroy, now absolutely at his wits' end for something to say, ' I don't know." "Just what I suspected long ago,"' replied my lord Clodol. phus. ' Young people are wont to laugh at nothing. Animal What's the joke?"    <pb n="352-353" xml:id="VAC6560-00000185"/> 352      DREAMS wITHN DREAMS. spirits, I should say. However, laughter increaseth fat, as saith the old adage (which whoso listeth may read), and I verily am not the one to quarrel therewith." And now the dog Romulus, who had formed a fourth of the party, pricked up his ears, barked, and started off at full run. The three looked up, and saw the Count and Sir Wolf- gang approaching. As these two gentlemen came up, Kate wickedly said to the Count: "Pray ask my lord Clodolphus to repeat his poem on hawks. You cannot think how interesting it is." "No, I'll be hanged if I will," replied the Count. "At least," said my lord Clodolphus, " you will allow me to ask you a question?" "A hundred questions, but no hawks," replied the Count. "Come here, then," said my lord Clodolphus; "and you, too, Wolfgang. Now, Bertrand, do you see that bough?" "Of course I do," said the Count. "And do you see it, Wolfgang?" inquired my lord Clo- dolphus. "Certainly," replied that gentleman. "What of it? My lord Clodolphus looked at them both. Not a smile moved their lineaments. "What the devil's the matter with the bough?" asked the Count. Sir Wolfgang looked inquiringly first at the bough, then at my lord Clodolphus, who answered: "Just what I want to know." "What!" cried the Count; " you don't know, yourself?" "I do not," quoth my lord Clodolphus. "Oh, get away from my very sight!" cried the Count. "You are always at some trash or another. What on earth is in your head to-day? Hallo What are you two laughing about?" ' Don't ask me," said Godfroy. "Nor me," said Kate. "Hang it!" cried the Count; "I believe you are all gone mad. What on earth is in the bough? Come, stir yourself up, Clodolphus, and answer. You must have some reason (although, generally speaking, you have deuced little) for show- ing that branch to me." Said my lord Clodolphus: "Only that, as these young people saw something verily facetious in that bough while I was quoting, and I could not, I thought you might aid me un- derstand wherein lieth the jocularity."

"I might have known, without asking, that you were at the bottom of it all, quoting away as if the foul fiend were to carry you off in his claws the first day you did not drive some poor soul dis- tracted with Julius Caesar. However, this is a park of liberty. Laugh or wonder as you like. I am not going to trouble my head any more on the matter. I have enough to think about. Here has Clovis been nearly murdering somebody." "God forbid!" they all cried. "Yes," continued the Count; " and you, Clodolphus, have been aiding and abetting him. A nice guest you are-to go and comfort an assassin." "You do not verily call your son an assassin?" quoth my, lord Clodolphus. "I don't know what I brought him into the world for, if not to call him names," said the Count, obstinately. "Why, the very first thing I did to him, when an innocent baby, was to call him Clovis; and if that a'n't a name, bless me." "That was quite different," quoth my lord Clodolphus. "It was not," said the Count. "It was," quoth my lord Clodolphus. "Never mind that," said Godfroy. "What about Clovis? How did you hear it?" "Peter was under the bed, and saw the whole," replied the Count. "He heard Clovis come in, and, as he had no right to be there, hid himself under the bed. That man is always hiding somewhere. I believe his mother must have been con- fined under a sofa, or behind a chest of drawers, or in a ward- robe, and so given him the nature of a wild Indian, who is always lurking somewhere for the purpose of crushing your skull in with a tomahawk." "I will tell you the truth," said my lord Clodolphus. Here- upon he gave the Count a true version of what had passed between the young men. "What!" cried the Count, when he had concluded; "Albert I Upon my word! Served him right. He, to draw his sword in my castle, on my son! Upon my word! Who is safe, when those we cover with benefits turn and sting us? What next, I wonder? I suppose you, Clodolphus, will be chucking stones at my hens. Hang the fellow! But what's all this about Gertrude? Is that the- Why, I know all about it. Come along I Come along!" And, with these words, the Count led the way rapidly to the castle, leaving the rest to follow or not, as they liked.    <pb n="354-355" xml:id="VAC6560-00000186"/> 354      DR1AMS WITHrN DREAMS. CHAPTER XXXII. BEING A VASTLY DIVERTING ONE TO WHOSO IS VASTLY DIVERTED THEREBY. HAVING climbed up to the dignity of governor, Claude began to find greatness a nuisance. Admirably adapted for guerilla warfare, he found his occupation gone when elevated to the executive department of Viot. Uphorn, whose practical eye detected this at once, proposed to him the government of a dilapidated fort in the neighborhood, with instructions to rebuild it at the expense of the state. "You will hold this," said he, "until peace is proclaimed, and the garrison discharged. It will then be your own property. From my own means I will assign to you three hundred acres of land round it; so that, in the end, you will become a proprietor, not only of a consider- able estate, but a chateau well worth owning. You will retain, of course, your name of De Viot, marry whom you please, and lay the foundation of a noble house." Claude gladly accepted the offer, resigned his command to Rappenhammer, and was now busily employed at the fort, where he had more volunteers than he desired; Claude's very name being a tower of strength in the vicinity. But the ex-governor had certain eccentric ways of doing things, and much was the merriment which his performances occasioned. Among other ways, it was his wont to employ Leander on impossible undertakings, and to rate him soundly for not performing them. So it happened, that once he ordered him to repair instantly to the Devil's Rock, and undermine it; removing the earth carefully until he had completed a tunnel six feet square, leading from one side to the other. Consider- ing the rock descended some three miles into the bowels of the earth, the reader may think the undermining thereof was not an easy task. And so Leander found it, after he had dug some ten feet. What shall we do?" asked Master Jack (who, with oth- ers, had accompanied him to see the sport). What shall we do?" asked he, leaning on his spade, and grinning broadly. Master Jack had worked a very little, and laughed a great deal the whole time. We may as well remark here, that he had enlisted under Claude, and was one of Captain Leander's most   DREAMS WITHN DREAMS.       3bi5 untiring persecutors. Indeed, he had suggested the promotion of that gentleman; whose rank, we hardly need say, was a sinecure. "What shall we do, Captain? The water is beginning to come in. See here," said he, slapping up a spadeful of moist clay in Leander's face. "A'n't it wet?" "Stop!" cried Leander. "You have filled my mouth with mud, and a whole lot has run down my back. Ugh! how it scratches. What are we to do? Let us go back." "I would not advise you to do that," said Master Jack, winking at the others. "Sir Claude said, the other day, you were not worth your salt, and that, when he tried you again, if you failed, he meant to give you seven hundred and fifty lashes on the bare back." "Then I will run away," cried Leander. "Ah, but we won't let you run away," said the grinning Jack. "If you try that game, my man, we will tie you neck and heels, and carry you back to be shot. Don't you know desertion is a capital offence?" "Dear! dear!" cried Leander. "What a terrible set of fellows you are! Here I am told to dig up a mountain, and, if I can't do it, I am to have seven hundred and fifty lashes. Why am I to have seven hundred and fifty lashes? Why must I dig up a mountain? You can't dig up a mountain. Sir Claude can't dig up a mountain. Then why should I? Sir Claude has no bowels" "I wish I hadn't," growled one of the men, ' and then I could laugh at aches, and despise peppermint." "How does Sir Claude treat you?" asked Master Jack.. Said Leander: ' I will tell you. He never lets me alone. One day he reprimands me because I can't ride a vicious mule. The thing just chucked me off as fast as they hoisted me up. Now why should they let me be kicked off? That's what I want to know.  Why should they?  Did they suppose it would improve my horsemanship?" "Not much, I fancy," remarked Master Jack. "Dear! dear!" continued Captain Leander; "and then, what must Sir Claude do, but order me on a secret expedition. 'Where to?' says I. ' Don't you know, you fool,' says he, 'that it would not be a secret, if you knew it? Go along with you.' ' But where shall I go?' says I. 'Be reasonable. How can a fellow start, if lie don't know where to start to?' 'Begone,' says he, 'or I'll be after you in the twinkling of an    <pb n="356-357" xml:id="VAC6560-00000187"/> OW     I lUCtDAKA V5 WvIUIN AJDREAMS. eye.' ' Mey e ye!' says I. ' But I can't start, without starting somewhere.' ' You are the most mortal ass in the country,' says he. ' Come here,' says he; and, with that, he leads the way to a door opening on some steps going down. 'You are to go there,' says he. 'What I! in that hole? ' says I. 'Yes,' says he. 'I won't go,' says I. 'I won't go without a light.' 'Oh I yes, you will,' says he. 'You will find lights below.' Well, I looked, and, to be sure, there was a light a long way down (a mile; I should think), as if a body was coming up. 'Hi I' cries Sir Claude. Hallo! ' says a faint voice at the bottom. 'Set your light down, and come up,' says Sir Claude. 'All right,' salys the faint voice at the bottom. Just as he had set the light down, and was coming up, what must I do but slip. I caught Sir Claude by the leg, and pulled him after me. Down we slid-1I on-my stomach, straddling the steps, and Sir Claude in a sitting posture. Lor! how he bumped. I went along like grease; but he Hwhy, it was a bump for every step, and one of extra hardness for the bottom one, where we both upset the man who was just coming up. And what a row I got then I ' Oh, you villain! ' cries Sir Claude, giving me a clip. Didn't you know better than to grab me by the leg?' "And, says the other, fetching me a kick,' what do you mean by bumping your infernal seat of honor against my nose, you lubber?' So the two abused me for a good half hour, I should say. Then they both began laughing like mad. Then they both left me in the dark, while I hollered till I was hoarse." "And where was it?" asked Master Jack. "Oh  it was the wine cellar," replied Leander; "and I fancy they found a few bottles cracked, next day." ( Accidentally, eh?" said Master Jack. Not a bad ad- venture, on the whole." "Ah," sighed Leander, "if they all ended like that, I wouldn't complain; but the awful things I have had to do, a'n't to be told in ran hour, I believe you. What must Sir Claude do, but make a scout of me. 'You are to be a scout, says he. 'Am-I?' says I. ' What's a scout? ' A scout,' says he, 'is a fellow whoi observes the enemy's motions, and reports the same to the officer. You are to be stationed alone in the churchyard eyery night, and all night long. If you leave your post, I. will hang you as a deserter; and if the enemy catch you, they will hang you as a spy. So now you know your duty,' says he. 'I won't go,' says I. 'Heydey I ' says he. 'Go yourself, says I. ' How would you like to be alone with   DREAMS WITHN DREAMS.        357 graves at night?' I should hope so. Lor I the very idea of the churchyard gave me the agey. And then to be hung by either side! Pretty cool that, wasn't it? ' You've got to go, or be hung,' says Sir Claude. 'Well,' says I, 'since it must come to hanging either way, I'd rather be hung without ghosts, than be haunted first, and hung afterward. So get the gallows up. I'm ready.' This rather puzzled him. Says he, ' You are a coward, Captain Leander.' Says I, 'I know that, Sir Claude.' 'I must cure you,' he says. Says I, 'I wish you would, for it makes me mighty uncomfortable.' With that he walks whistling away. But he made me a scout, after all. Only he never sent me to the churchyard." ' And what did you do as a scout?" asked Master Jack. "Do!" replied Leander. "Do I Just nothing at all. H wasn't going to do anything.. I had enough to do to keep out of danger. Oh! I wish they would let me go home." Now, as we said before, Master Jack, understanding the nature of Leander's duty from the very beginning, had not overexerted himself, but had stood leaning on his spade, and solacing himself with conversation. Wishing to keep the vic- tim up to the mark, he struck his spade into the earth as if he. intended lo be very busy. As the instrument entered the soil, he felt a resistance. Pushing the clay aside, what was his astonishment, when he discovered a small iron box. To get it out, was the work of a few minutes. The lock was very strong, and the box very heavy. Curiosity and avarice moved all the laborers, who resolved unanimously to convey it at once to Sir Claude, and claim salvage if (as they supposed) it should be found to contain a treasure. Leander and Master Jack were appointed carriers, and the rest formed an escort. A long pole was produced, and the box slung on it. Master Jack then in- formed Leander that, as captain, he must go first; which ar- rangement enabled Jack to shove the box close to Leander-who was not posted up in mechanics-and thus give him the lion's share of the burden. Poor Leander complained, but Master Jack proved that both equally supported the weight. After lihe had stumbled two or three times, however, the rest took com- passion on him, and relieved him by turns. Thus they pro- ceeded to the fort, all being on pins and needles to know what the contents might be which were so carefully guarded. Now, to be true to my calling, I must skip round in your true novel style; giving the reader a bite here and a bite there. of my romantic feast. Sometimes a piece of sugar, sometimes    <pb n="358-359" xml:id="VAC6560-00000188"/> a piece of orange peel, sometimes something else turns up; and the whole goes to give that delectable character of mixture common to melodramas and mince pies. This being premised, we will leave the iron box to those who found it, and return to the castle. Two hours after the Count made his open confession of knowing something about little Gertrude, Sir Wolfgang was sent for; at which summons he proceeded to Piquemont's apartment, where he found that gentleman, together with the Count, Clovis, land Godfroy. When he was seated, Piqueimont began the conversation. '"Sir Wolfgang," said he, ' we have sent for you nn important business. You have the reputation of possessing  uncommon talent for discovering clues that nobody else can. The way, for example, you discovered my residence, shows me that your reputation is not without founda- tion." "That," replied Sir Wolfgang, " was as much due to acci- dent as to any shrewdness of mine." "I do not think so," answered Piquemont. "You first had the sense to think of the tavern. Next, putting this and - that together, you jumped at the conclusion that the beggar and myself were one and the same person. Still, call it acci- dent, or whatever else you please, we want a man like you, who can turn accident to account." "Anything I can do for you, my lord," replied Sir Wolf- gang, i' I will do readily and willingly; for I am sure it will be a pleasant duty." "I knew that," said Piquemont, smiling. ' And now let us give you the particulars." "One moraent, my lord," returned Sir Wolfgang. "As several persons, if I understand you aright, are to furnish me with particulars, I should like to note them down. Or, no," he continued; "perhaps it would be better not." "What I have to say," pursued Piquemonrt, " is this: Seven years ago, Uphorn married, secretly, a young girl, the daughter of a French exile. A romantic wish to secure the disinterested affections of some young woman, induced him to conceal his rank. The consequence was, that the death of the mother in childbirth, and before the marriage was openly an- nounced, gave; good reason for thinking the child illegitimate. -fFfe Child was concealed, and since then Uphorn has been seek- ing. ter high anld low, but without success." -"And you suppose little Gertrude to be the child?" asked Sir Wolfgang.,   DREAMS wTn'IW  LREEAMS.       59 Piquemont smiled. "You see," he said, "that your talent for guessing will shine out. You have anticipated already what I was about to say. But now listen to the others. .Will you begin, Bertrand?" "I," said the Count, " as you all know, had a son, who died seven years ago. Before he died, he spoke to me about a child hidden somewhere in the forest. Uphorn, you know; fainted at the sight of my son's portrait. We have had Clovis and Godfroy in, and there seems to have been no end of games played all round. I never heard of them. Of course not. Nobody ever tells me anything." Clovis and Godfroy then told Sir Wolfgang all the reader knows. When they had finished, Piquemont concluded, by saying: "You see, first, we have the fact that Gertrude Gal- lahaut was really married to Uphorn. For this I can pledge you my word. Next, we find a child, bearing the dead mother's name, living in the forest. Next, the personal resem- blance between the child and her supposed mother is very re- markable. Lastly, there is a child of Gertrude lost. Now what do you think?" "Should Uphorn die," answered Sir Wolfgang, "who would benefit by his death?" "His property naturally would revert to his next of kin," replied Piquemont. "Male, or female?" "The bulk would belong to the male heir, although the Duke would be able to leave a large amount to his daughter." "And this last--what of it?" asked the knight. "Is it a large property?" "Colossal," answered Piquemont. "And this next of kin?" pursued Sir Wolfgang. ' "The male heir, I mean. What do you know about him?" "I know  very little good of him," replied Piquemont. "He is crafty, selfish, and suspected of pursuing unlawful knowledge." "Humph 1" muttered Sir Wolfgang.   "And pray, is he rich?" ' he was once," answered Piquemont; " but he is one -of those prodigals, who may be born to the wealth of Creesus, and yet perish, at last, of want by the wayside." "Crafty, selfish, unscrupulous, and a spendthrift," said Sir Wolfgang. "Truly a formidable enemy to such a little erea. ture."                        ,      <pb n="360-361" xml:id="VAC6560-00000189"/> 360      DEEAMS WrlnIIN DREAMS. "What do you think?" asked Clovis, anxiously, as he saw the knight paused, and shook his head. "The truth is," replied Sir Wolfgang, " the child, in all human piobability, is Uphorn's lost daughter; but I fear it would have been better for her a thousand times that she was not."' "Do not say so," said Piquemont. "If she is his child, why say so?" "Proof is wanting," said the knight, sadly; "and estates, such as you describe Uphorn's to be, are not so easily won. So deserted, and with such an enemy, what can a child do?" "And so you give up hope?" asked Piquemont. "I would be false to duty if I did," answered the other. "No, I do not give up hope." The Count here gave a sniff. "Have you anything to re- mark, Bertrand?" asked Piquemont. The Count gave another and a louder sniff. "I don't care a snap," said he. "The girl's Uphorn's child, or she a'n't. If she is, she is; and if she isn't, she isn't; and there's an end of it." "Very true, said Sir Wolfgang, wondering what the Count meant. "Then all we have to do," continued the Count, "is to prove she is, or to prove she isn't. Proofs are what we want." "Very true," said Sir Wolfgang again. "But where shall we find them-?" "Find them?" repeated the Count. "What has that to do with the subject? You have only to go the right way to work, and you are sure to find them." "If we can," suggested the knight. "If you can?" repeated the Count.   "If you can? Pooh I pooh!" Saying which, the Count, who was satisfied that he had aided the council materially, chuckled. "And now," continued Sir Wolfgang, turning to Pique- mont, "now give me a description of this male heir." "He is a tall, thin man, with black hair touched by gray. He has a very pleasant manner when he chooses, and quite an agreeable expression; but you can know him from a thousand by a peculiarly wicked, catlike expression when he sits im- menied in thought--" Clovis started. "Is he not," he inquired, "known by the name of Cuima la Chambre?"    DREAMS WITHN DREAMS.       361 "I believe so," replied Piquemont. "I think I have heard something of the kind. Why?" Because," said Clovis, "if he be the same, there remains little doubt concerning the child's parentage. This man has papers which must throw a great deal of light on the subject." "But will he deliver them up?" asked Piquemont. "To me, yes." "And why to you?" "I hold him in my power." "And where can I find this Curma la Chambre?" asked Sir Wolfgang.                  * "I will bring you to him," answered Clovis; "that is, if you consent to let me guide yoq blindfold; for I have pledged my honor to him not to reveal his place of residence, unless I have good reason so to do." The Count looked perplexed, and was evidently about to protest strongly, when Piquemont begged him not to throw any difficulties in the way. "What do you say, Wolfgang?" he inquired. "That, of course, I will do as Clovis wishes," he answered. "But the Count seems to have some objections to propose. Let us hear them, for in these matters every advice is im- portant." "All I have to say," remarked the Count, " is, that it ap- pears to me there is a great deal of fuss. Why on earth must you be blindfolded? You a'n't going to play blindman's buff, I suppose?"                      v "Oh! we will manage that part of the business," answered the knight, smiling. "In the mean while, Count, suppose you consult my lord Clodolphus on the matter. His opinion would be of great service; and, if you have no objections-" "But I do have very strong objections to doing anything of the kind," interrupted the Count. "I have the very great- est objections. Why, I wouldn't be alone with that terrible man for a quarter of an hour, unless I had my ears stuffed with beeswax. No, not if you offered me a kingdom." "Leave it to me," said Piquemont, significantly. "Why," continued the Count, "do you know what that man would do? Do you know how, the moment he had the slightest excuse to talk, he would open a masked battery of Julius Caesars, and shell me out of my boots? Goodness gra- cious, man alive I have you been twenty minutes in company 16    <pb n="362-363" xml:id="VAC6560-00000190"/> 362       DREAMS WITHN DREAMS. with that chattering magpie, without losing your senses? Don't he call Saint Austin, Saint Augustine?" -"Very good, Bertrand," said Piquemont, anxious to resume the subject of conversation. "Didn't he call my game cock a draggle-tail rooster? continued the Count. "True," assented Piquemont. "And now, my dear Wolf- gang--" "Didn't he say I disliked cauliflower?" pursued the Count. "True," assented Piquemont.  "Now, this Curma la Chambre--" "Didn't he say you must shoot tobacco through your pro- boscis, if you wanted to be virtuous?" continued the Count. "Don't he know everything, when he knows nothing? Pooh! pooh! I won't ask him. No, sir. No 'my lord Clodolphus' for me, and no 'me' for my lord Clodolphus." "Very well," said Sir Wolfgang, rising. "So let matters stay for the present. You and I, Clovis, must hunt this gen- tleman up. When will we start?" "To-night," replied Clovis; " not before, as it would be of no use. So make yourself as comfortable as you can until then."  When evening was come, Clovis and Sir Wolfgang started on their secret expedition. The road, at first, was straight enough, but, after a short distance, they turned to the left, and plunged into the forest. After threading its mazes for some time, Clovis todk out a handkerchief, and bound it over his companion's eyes, when they proceeded slowly. After about an hour's riding, Clovis, who had been guiding the knight's horse, reined! in, and said: "Do not remove the bandage, but sit still." So saying, he dismounted, tied the two horses, and then assist- ed his companion to alight. Sir Wolfgang took Clovis's arm, and felt himself led down several flights of steps, and through sev- eral crooked! passages. At length they paused. "You can now uncover," said Clovis. Sir Wolfgang removed the band- age, and found himself in a small apartment lighted by a soli- tary earthen lamp. There was no furniture in the room, ex- cept a rough bench. "Sit down," whispered Clovis, "and wait until I return." Sir Wolfgang obeyed, and the other left him. He heard the noise of Clovis's footsteps until it died away in the dis- tance. 1                 .A   DREAMS WITHN DEAMS.        363 "Well," said he to himself, "this is an adventure, to be sure. I wonder what is coming of it?" He remained patiently waiting for about an hour, when he heard steps again; but this time there were two. "There is nothing like being ready," said he to himself, bringing his sword to a more convenient position. "It may be Clovis, and then, again, it may not. There can be no harm, at least, to be on one's guard, especially when one does not know where one is." But it was only Clovis and the person they sought. La Chambre fixed his catlike eyes on the knight, bowed politely, took the lamp, and requested them both to follow. This they did through several passages, until he stopped before an iron door, took out a key, unlocked the massive bolt, and bade them enter. Then, following them, he lighted another lamp from the one he held in his hand. The apartment was lighted by an immense silver lamp, which hung from the ceiling, and threw out a dazzling lustre. The walls were hung with costly drapery. Richly carved tables, chairs, and other furniture lined the sides. A glass case containing a collection of minerals was in a corner, while busts and statues, vases and arms, were tastefully collected and arranged. One or two large landscapes graced the walls, and a perfume of roses gave quite a summer air to the room. Both the visitors almost involuntarily expressed their admi- ration. La Chambre seemed in ill humor, and made no direct reply. "Come," said he, "you have visited me on business, and not by way of compliment. I thought you would like a parlor reception. As for myself, these matters do not interest me at all. What do you want?" "The papers I spoke to you about," answered Clovis, quietly. "I have not got them," said La Chambre, frowning heav- ily; "and I cannot give you what I do not possess." "Very well," replied Clovis, still more quietly. "We will remain here half an .hour. If they are not forthcoming, you must go with us." "I appeal to you," said La Chambre, turning to Sir Wolf- gang; "is this fair? This man has gained an advantage over me, and seeks to rob me of my own." I know too little of what you mean," said Sir Wolfgang, "to form an opinion; but if you intend to say that Clovis Ber- trand is unfair in act or intention, you waste words with me. Such an accusation were a vile slander." -    <pb n="364-365" xml:id="VAC6560-00000191"/> 36 4-     DREAMS WITHN DREAMS. "If you knew who I was-" began La Chambre. "Perhaps I do," interrupted Clovis. La Chambre stared at him. "Perhaps,"' continued Clovis, "you expect, one day, a duke's fortune l' La Chambre sprang up as if stung. "How do you know that?" cried he. "Confound you! With all the art I have practised for years, you are always before me. You discovered my residence in spite of me; and, in spite of me, now you have discovered my birth. Is it chance? he muttered to him- self, " or is it Jehovah?  "God Almighty," said Clovis, still very quietly, 'is stronger than the devil you serve. I warned you, seven years ago, to quit your art, as you call it; and you scorned my coun- sel as the advice of an inexperienced boy. You now confess yourself that I am the stronger of the two, in admitting that your science had failed. Failed I Why, with all the aid of man's bad passions, when did evil ever succeed, in the long run-?- Search the pages of history, and refute me, if you can." La Chambre sneered. "Be it so;" continued Clovis. "I understand you per- fectly. Let there be an eid to this. Let us strike a bargain. I promise you secrecy, perfect and inviolable, on condition you surrender those papers. Moreover, I promise you, in case they prove of service, a quittance of all you owe me, and a princely income from Uphorn for the rest of your life." "I have not got the papers, I tell you," said La Chambre. "Then," cried Clovis, now losing all patience, "you shall come with us, and tell the Duke so yourself." La Chambre made a rush for the door with the intention of lockilg them in; but Sir Wolfgang, who had steadily watched him all the while, caught him by the collar, and swung him violently to the other end of the room. The knight then calmly placed his back against the door, and folded his arms. "By heaven, you shall not!" cried Clovis, drawing his sword, and eying La Chambre sternly, as he gathered himself together like a panther making ready to spring "Wolfgang, be on your guard 1 " "Tush!" replied the knight, contemptuously. "If the man thinks to harm me, he will find his art (as he calls it) rather a poor ally." La Chambre fixed his eye on Sir Wolfgang. who met his   -   DREAMS WITIN DREAMS.        365 gaze with a haughty scorn. "Bear witness, Heaven!" said Clovis; "if this vile man succeeds, I will cut him down as I would a serpent." "Curse you both!" cried La Chambre, foaming with rage. "Take your papers, sign my release, and begone." So saying, he pulled a package of documents from his bosom, threw them on the table, and flung himself blaspheming on a chair. "Look over them, Wolfgang,"', said Clovis, "while I watch this half devil, lest he work us a mischief." The knight took up the bundle, and read the headings over to Clovis. They were all correct. "Now," said Clovis, when his companion had ended, "now, La Chambre, write as I dic- tate." La Chambre sullenly complied. When he had finished Clovis read it over, signed it, and delivered the document to him. "And now," he concluded, sternly, "do you go before us with the light. Turn neither to the right nor to the left, as you value life. When we leave you, take my word for it, you will never be troubled by me again." La Chambre complied. Clovis seized him firmly by the collar, and, sheathing his sword, drew his poniard. Sir Wolf. gang followed them. So they proceeded, when Clovis, turning his head, told his companion to pull his cap over his eyes, and take hold of him. The other obeyed, and soon found himself mounting steps, and then emerging into the outer air. "Can you mount your horse blindfold?" asked Clovis, leading him up to Cincinnatus. Sir Wolfgang answered by laying his hand on the saddle and vaulting up. "Bravo  " cried Clovis, untying the horse. "Here are the reins. So. Now wait a moment, and I will be ready." In a few moments the two were out of sight. La Cham- bre stood watching them, his whole face violently working with passion. As they disappeared, he stretched out a claw-like hand, and shook it in the direction in which they had vanished. It will go hard, Clovis Bertrand," he cried, "if I am not even with you yet." As he spoke, he felt a hand on his shoulder. He turned short round, and glared like a tiger at bay. " Who are you?" he cried. "What are you doing here? Ha   I should know you." And he held his light up to the stranger's face.    <pb n="366-367" xml:id="VAC6560-00000192"/> 366      D:"DREAMS WITH DREAMS. "I thought so," he continued. "And how comes it Albert f.'Esterre is here at this hour?" "Albert ID'Esterre," replied the other, " gives an account of what he does, only when it pleases him so to do. I over- heard what you said just now. You are the man I want. We both wish evil to the house of Bertrand and its heir. Let us work together." La Chambre eyed him narrowly, and then replied, "I am satisfied."  "You may be so," returned Albert. L "Ha!" muttered the other.  "Fast friend, fast foe. Worshipper and hater, idolater and iconoclast! I accept your offer. Yon brand on your forehead marks-" "I ellfire!" cried Albert. "Leave these matters. Shall we work together, or shall we not?" "More than you think, and less than you would desire, if the stars speak truth," replied La Chambre. "There is death in your face;" "Death as soon as you will," said Albert, "if his pre- cedes it." "Come with me, then," answered the other, leading the way. CHAPTER XXXIII. HOW ALBERT AND LA CHAMBRE TOOK A MOONLIGHT SURVEY OF THE OLD RUIN. "THS," said La Chambre to Albert, "is a very ancient ruin. The Count of Piquemont found an asylum here during his banishment." "Indeed!" said Albert, looking round. "His apartments, I hear, did not equal those of Croesus." "Yet I live here," remarked La Chambre. Albert looked round again, but said nothing. "You think I might choose a better place," observed L. Chambre, eying his companion keenly. Albert admitted that such was his opinion. "You will change it soon," said the other. "And pray, who built this edifice?" asked Albert   DREAMS WITHN DREAMS.        367 4 "A part of it was originally the foundation of a Roman temple dedicated to Isis," replied Lia Chambre. "The en- trance to its subterranean chambers was blocked up when my ancestors chose this spot as their place of residence." "You are, then," said Albert, astonished, " an Occa?" "I am," answered the other.  "The house of Uphorn numbers my name among its sons. But leave that. Of what was I speaking? :'  "Of subterranean chambers, supposed to exist under this ruin," replied Albert. "Yes, yes," said the other. "Since the castle was burned and abandoned, our family preserved the secret of these cham- bers." "They exist, then?" "They do." '"I should like to visit them." "Your wish shall be fulfilled. Look round you. What do you see?" "A small cell going fast to decay. . It looks like a hermit's celL" "'You are right. The only one of our, family, to whom tradition accords any pretensions to godliness, lived here. He was the natural son of one of my direct ancestors, and was deemed half an idiot from his childhood. tHalf an idiot  Idiots are not good judges of sanity. Man, in his miserable self-conceit, imagines himself infallible. Idiot! Why, Albert D'Esterre, I have devoted a whole life to the study of how to acquire power; ay, and I can wield weapons, whichl if nar- rated to the world, would be deemed the veriest ravings of a madman. And yet the weakest girl can subdue me; a child can master me. These idiots have a science I cannot under- stand, a power I do not possess, an ally I cannot detect, a strength I cannot overcome." "And so you think your ancestor was not an idiot?" in- quired Albert. Come with me," was La Chambre's only reply, as he led the way out of the cell to a half-destroyed turret. Preceding his companion up the spiral staircase, he led him to the present summit of the building. The whole ruin /could be distinctly seen in the moonlight from this spot. As Albert thus stood looking round carelessly, his eyes chanced to fall upon the two towers which rose far above the crumbling walls of the old castle. As he looked at them, he    <pb n="368-369" xml:id="VAC6560-00000193"/> 368      DREAMS WITIN DREAMS. started, for a thrill of vague, frightful, inexpressible horror smote him. So, superstition tells us, we shudder when some one inadvertently passes over the spot which one day will be our grave. "In the time of my ancestor, the monk's father," continued La Chambre, " this castle was standing, strong enough, appar- ently, to resist the undermining of centuries. Our ,race has always had the reputation of being unscrupulous, revengeful, crafty, and bloody." "The present Duke and his father-" suggested Albert. "Are only two individuals," replied La Chambre. "The monk was another. But, with few exceptions, none of our race ever went to his final account without the stain of blood on his conscience. 'o You see those two towers close together? I wish you to remark them particularly, as the whole story hangs upon what once occurred near them. But let me tell it first, and after- ward give my explanations. See. There they stand, still rising two hundred feet, and only three yards apart. It would not be safe to stand on the summit of one of them now, although you may still safely climb the other. Some day not very far distant, the farther will come down with a crash, and the shock will probably topple over the other. Do you see them?" Albert looked in that direction. Again the thrill of horror ran through his veins. Again he started; for the unseen phan- tom seemed behind him, looking over his shoulder. Again he turned, again saw nothing, and again the feeling disappeared. "The monk," continued La Chambre, not noticing Albert's shudder, "was named Cyrillus. I style him the monk, more from habit than any real reason, for he never received holy orders. We always have called him so. His father, too proud to allow even his natural son to enter the Church without the payment of a large endowment, and too avaricious to give the money, imprisoned Cyrillus when he expressed his wish; nor did he release him until he had extorted a promise that he would abandon the idea. The old man worked upon his son's humility, by representing that he was unworthy of so high a station as the sacerdotal rank. Ha I He was a wily old fox, that same ancestor of mine. "A compromise was at last effected between them. Cyril- lus was to have his cell, and his father was not to molest him. And so the young man lived in the little room down yonder, and nobody troubled himself about him.   DREAMS WITHN DREAMSS.        369 "It is said, my worthy ancestor practised magic (as the world calls it); but, as few understand what magic really is, I never knew whether the story was true or false. If true, it satisfies a theory of my own. I have long suspected that magical powers are hereditary." "What!" cried Albert; " and do you believe in magic?" La Chambre smiled.  "Innocent young man," said he, "would-be philosophers talk a great deal, without precisely knowing themselves from what premises they draw their con- clusions. When I read their self-conceited remarks, I always picture to myself a scientific meeting of the born blind discuss- ing the existence of light. I can hear these wiseacres unani- mously deciding that, beyond feeling, tasting, smelling, and hearing, there are no senses. They resolve sight to be impos- sible, and brand those who talk of eyes as impostors." Explain yourself," said Albert. "Why," answered La Chambre, "nine tenths of men who are born are as incapable of deciding what magic is, as the born blind are incapable of judging color and perspective. The best of them, those who approach nearest the arcana, have shown the magnitude of the difficulties they encounter, as it were, upon the threshold, by asking such questions as, 'Are these fluids material, after all?" "What do you mean?" inquired Albert. "I mean," replied the other, "that the greatest materialist finds out, sooner or later, that there is a something, very like soul, pervading the material world; which is not God, which is not man, which is not matter." "And which is- -" La Chambre laughed, and turned the conversation, by say- ing, "No matter. Let us return to Cyrillus. He took a strange dislike to his father's practices; nor was it long before the elder man found out how his son's will interfered with cer- tain experiments. He charged him with tacitly opposing him- self to what he was doing. Cyrillus did not deny the fact, and a stormy scene ensued, which ended in my ancestor turning the boy out of doors. "It was a bitter night. The wind was blowing terribly, the cold was intense, and the snow falling thickly. Cyrillus begged for mercy, but his father refused, cursing him for a sneaking, praying idiot. 'I shall die I' cried the poor boy; 'I shall die, father, in this terrible storm.' 'ie, then,' his father replied ; die, and let me be rid of you. But, father,' 16*     <pb n="370-371" xml:id="VAC6560-00000194"/> V I V      Ul1NA -DCiUL W lt1IJllN UEAM S pleaded Cyrillus, ' if Heaven's good will ordain it, be it so; yet let me not perish by your hand. For your own sake, if not for mine-for your soul's salvation, do not this wicked deed.' ' You shall not move me by your hypocrisy,' answered my forefather. 'Then God forgive you,' said Cyrillus, sadly; ' for you must soon appear before Him, to answer for what you have done.' "As the dear child "-(here, to Albert's great surprise, La Chambre seemed much more moved by the tale than people usually are by a legend)-" as the dear child stood trembling with cold, and looking imploringly up -at his unnatural father, the soldier who guarded the walls interfered. And I honor him for it." "You seem strangely affected by the tale," observed Albert. "Man I man I " replied La Chambre, "much evil have I done, and will do more; but the voice of our blood never speaks vainly to us, while we retain a single atom of the human in our natures. I have been discarded by my race, yet am I one of them; and he who is disowned by the living, often -turns for affection and consolation to the dead. But to continue." As he spoke, Albert remarked in his companion something he had. not observed before. There was a simple grandeur about him, when he remembered his race, which was evidently not counterfeited. "Good or bad," thought Albert, "the Occas bear always the same stamp of greatness. I would know one in rags." "The sentinel," continued La Chambre, "was melted at the sight of the boy. 'May Heaven desert me in my hour of need,' cried he, ' if I desert that poor young man.' This act of insubordination maddened my ancestor. ' Then go to him! ' he cried, hurling the soldier over the battlements. The man fell yonder into the ditch, and never rose again. The ice broke under his weight, and he was drowned. The next day it had frozen over the spot, but those who saw it aver that the shape of the new ice was like a coffin; and the peasants declared that, until the ditch became dry, it never froze there, but the spectator could see a coffin traced distinctly on the ice over the place where the sentinel lay drowned. "Cyrillus's body was found, the next day, on the snow. Within two months after, his father die1: under circumstances which caused the ruin you now see before you. In the middle   DREAMS WITHN DREAMS.         371 of the night, my ancestor was roused. by the alarm of fire. He had already reached the door, when the building fell in. He was never seen again. A few towers only remained, and the castle was never rebuilt." "But you said the story hinged on those two towers," said Albert, again shuddering as he looked at them. "I have not finished," replied La Chambre. "There is a prophecy in our family, to the effect that those twin towers will stand until the last of our house expires. Look at them. What sustains them? Would any architect guarantee their standing twenty-four hours longer? And yet, for eighty years, there they are, seemingly as near falling (and no nearer) as they were the day after the fire." "And what was the prophecy?" asked Albert. "It is not long," replied his companion. "I have it by heart. "' When the faun shall be rescued from terror and death, Destruction shall rise from her cavern beneath, Embracing the stronghold by centuries spared, And death by Uphorn and his towers be shared. The last of the race and its last mighty tower Shall vanish from life and renown the same hour.'" "And you?" inquired Albert. La Chambre stretched forth his arm in the direction of the tower.  "We shall fall together," said he.  "The Duke is childless. I am the last of our race. But let that pass. I was about to tell you how these towers are interwoven, as it were, with the history of our fanmily. As I said, almost every. one of us has been a murderer. The devil of murder, indeed, has taken up his habitation there. Before those two monu- ments of crime were erected, two graves marked the spot where they now   stand. One of them  was the tomb of a daughter of our house, who disgraced the name. The other was her lover's. They were both buried alive." Albert shuddered. "It was there," continued La Chambre, "Cyrillu, con- fronted his father. It was from that door he was turned, to perish in the snow. It was from that battlement the soldier was hurled.  And it wras there the fire began. Every crime we have committed, has had its origin there. They are called the Wicked Towers, being further distinguished by the titles of the Youth and the Lady, in memory of the legend.   But come; we have had enough of this. Let us descend."    <pb n="372-373" xml:id="VAC6560-00000195"/> 372       DREAMS WITHN DREAMS. They soon reached the monk's cell. "Look around you," said La Chambre, "and tell me what you see." "Nothing but a pile of rubbish," replied Albert. "Place your hand on it," continued his companion, "and tell me what you think it is?" Albert did so. "I should say," he replied, "it was origi- nally a part of the building. It feels solid enough. The mor- tar must be very strong, for the stones adhere as if they formed one solid piece." "Could you lift it?" asked the other. "Certainly I could not," answered Albert. "It must weigh several tons." "Let me try," said the other, stooping, and unfastening something co icealed in a crevice, when the whole mass rose slowly of its own accord, and remained apparently in the air, showing a concealed flight of steps, leading downward. La Chambre smiled.  "Eluilibrium," said he. "This mass is raised by the simple contrivance of the child's seesaw. The other end is fifty pounds the heaviest. When down, a hook keeps this side closed; and, the hook removed, it rises." ".But how do you close it?" asked Albert. "Do you seriously ask? The other end, I said, was fifty pounds the heaviest." "Well?" "Well, although there are many tons' weight, let me place a weight greater than fifty pounds here, and there we are." "But where is the weight?" At this, La Chambre burst out laughing, and jumped upon the stone, which sank at once. Albert looked a little foolish, and said, "True." "Come on," continued La Chambre, leading the way. When Albert was down, La Chambre bolted the secret door from the inside. "There I " said he; " we are now secure." And, so say- ing, he again led the way down several flights of steps, until they reached a long passage far under ground. "Perhaps you would like to know more about this place," said La Chambre; "and, as we are to be allies, I have no objection to tell you." Albert consenting, his companion led him into a large room. "Here," said he, " in perfect silence, and by the light of torches, the Secret Tribunal used to assemble. Where you and I are, the accused used to stand in the middle of a masked   DREAMS wrruIN DREAMS.        373 assembly. When he had finished his defence, a bell sounded, light suddenly glared from every side, for now the hour of judgment had come.  The accused found himself surrounded by a multitude dressed in black. If condemned, he was hur- ried to execution through yonder door. Let us survey the path of death." He then preceded Albert through the narrow passage. Pausing at an iron door on one side, he entered. This door opened on a smaller passage at right angles to the one they had just left. Lihing this second passage were doors closed by iron gratings, through which Albert could see small cells; in some of which were rusty chains, and in one a human skeleton. "These were the prisons," said La Chambre; "but they were seldom used. Instant execution, or perfect liberty, was their usual method of proceeding. Yet sometimes a harsher plan was adopted. That skeleton, for example, is all that re- mains of one who lay dying there for seventeen years. She had a child born there, about three months after she first came." "And the child?" asked Albert. "Oh  they just chucked him into the ditch," replied La Chambre, yawning. "You could not expect the Secret Tribu- nal to bother themselves about wet nurses, you know." This coal way of viewing things rather disconcerted Al- bert; but La Chambre apparently forgot all about it before they had again entered the passage of death. Following this, he opened a door leading to a large room with a sugar-loaf ceil- ing. "This is the torture room," said he. There was a dilapidated rack in one corner, and several rusty iron instruments in another. "That was a first-rate article once," said La Chambre, eying the rack with pardonable pride. "When I was a young man, I tried it on an ox, and cracked his bones considerably. But it's getting crazy now, more's the pity." Albert surveyed his extraordinary companion with great astonishment. La Chambre, however, seemed ufnconscious of it, and led him to another room, evidently a chapel. "Do not advance rashly," he cried, restraining Albert by the arm. "This is one of the most beautiful and fascinating tortures ever invented. Stand still." There was a stone in a corner. La Chambre picked it up. "Now mark," said he. "The condemned, half dead with ter- ror, is shut up here. He knows what has passed. He does. K    <pb n="374-375" xml:id="VAC6560-00000196"/> 374   :   DRIEAMS WITHN DREAMS. not know what is to come, when it is to come, nor whence it is to come. Death may come from above, for ceilings some- times crush the victim. It may come from below, for floors give way occasionally. It may come from any side, for walls advance, odd times, pressing the victim quite flat. Now, under such exciting circumstances, what would the condemned naturally do? Here is a chapel, there an altar. Ninety- nine out of a hundred would pray. Fancy him advancing. Look." So saying, La Chambre threw the stone upon a particular part of the loor in front of the shrine. The stone was not heavy, but'hardly had it touched the ground, when the appar- ently solid pavement gave way, opened, and swallowed the stone. Then the frightful trap noiselessly closed again, pre- senting, seemingly, a solid pavement as before. "I never feel safe here," said La Chambre, leading the way out. "Te condemned who fell there, fell on a wheel set in motion by machinery, and covered with knives. So he re- volved, sometimes under water, sometimes out, until he ex- pired. If I only knew how to set the thing going, and had one or two people of my acquaintance here, I could go to bed and sleep peacefully." With which pious wish he turned into another room, fol- lowed by Albert, lighted a lamp, and took a seat in front of him. CHAPTER XXXIV. WHCH WHOSO LISTETH MAY READ.

"No, I don't." "Nor the spirits there?" "No, sir. I know you." Oh I you know me, do you?" "I do. You have a black complexion, red eyes, homed head, and a caudal appendage halfway down." "This is a pitiful slander." "Oh! no, it isn't. You must be polite, my good fellow, if you wish to stay here. Hard words won't do for me, my man." "Trifler, beware I?' "Thank you kindly. I shall. Now. please don't tip the table quite so much. You really are making me nervous. It is not going to fall on my toes. I know that as well as your- self." Here the spirit vanished, and I awoke (for I had dreamed all this), and at once began to muse on humbug-for there is a supernatural as well as a natural humbug, and Satan is the king of quacks. Deception led me to contemplate the character of our old acquaintance, Christopher Xacca, the necromancer and astro logical bladder. But we must not bear too hard on the wizard. Doubtless he was no saint. He simply wanted money, and    <pb n="376-377" xml:id="VAC6560-00000197"/> 376      DREAMS WITIN DREAMS. studied popular taste for that purpose. Astrology being in fashion, he was an astrologer; that science only requiring a capital of brass, in which material he was opulent. But let us return to our story. How came it Ubald and Claude consulted Christopher? Let the result explain the rea- son. Suffice it to say, that the day after the opening of the iron box, Claude sought Anselm, was referred to Ubald, and both together sought the presence of the weird enchanter. "Ah," observed the soothsayer, "ye have doubtless come to consult the stars. Truly, my sons, ye are wise. What would ye?" "We would ask concerning the past," replied Ubald. "The past," said the wizard, "is obscure; yet can I but try. When were you born?"  "Thirty years ago," answered Ubald. "The stars tell me," said the magician, after examining a huge manuscript before him, "that you are now beginning your one-and-thirtieth year." "Bless my soul!" cried Ubald, feigning astonishment. "How could you have known that?" "Ah, that indeed!" replied the seer. "I can tell you more than that, sir. By sidereal computation, you may take it for granted, generally, that he who hath just passed the thir- tieth anniversary of his nativity, hath entered upon his one- and-thirtieth year." "How wonderful!" cried Ubald. "Ah, I believe you!" replied the enchanter. "We know a thing or two. Take a horoscope, for example. What a thing that is! See the constellations now--twelve of them. There's the Scales. A whole lot of queer things happens to him born when that fellow's round. Then, there's the Scor- pion, tail, claws, and all. All I have to say, is, don't be born under that lot. I always tell my patrons so." "And do they follow your advice?" asked Ubald. "They do," replied the seer. "Then, again, there's Sagit- tarius. What a fellow he is, to be sure I Bless you I he's the jockey for me. And then, what a regular one is the Goat! Regular jumper, that chap. Bless your souls! you don't know what games isn't being played up in the sky. I don't. No- body don't. Get the Ram all right, and there you are. The Twins bring inheritance. Oh I what a great thing it is to have twins." "Women don't think so," said Claude, demurely.   DREAMS WITHN DREAMS.       3" Xacca looked at Claude attentively. Claude winked, and put his thumb to his nose. They seemed to understand each other at once. "What the devil do you want, if it is not astrology?" asked the mighty necromancer, grinning. "We understand each other, I see. You have not come here for this trash" (flinging the manuscript away); " so out with it." But we must not trespass on the sage's time any longer. What transpired between the three, may not be disclosed as yet. Let us rather fill up the space between the acts, with some remarks on what has been heretofore written, which may or may not interest the dear reader. "Stop!" cried my tow-headed cousin. "Remarks being now in order, I wish to speak. Gentlemen, I have the floor." "Go ahead," said I, "and don't stumble so over the begin- ning. You always remind me of those old authors, who could not write a book without first poking in no end of dedications, introductions, approbations, prefaces, explanatory chapters, and preliminary remarks." "My dear Ulric," replied my tow-headed cousin, "don't be an ass. You leave me alone, and I will leave you alone. Pray, let me quietly make my observations." "Very well," said I; " that is just what I want. Go in." "I am afraid," continued my tow-headed cousin, "you are becoming prosy. I see clearly you are convinced that philoso- phers are sometimes humbugs. I regret to see that. The words 'philosopher' and 'humbug' should never be spoken in the same breath." "Why not?"I asked. "Don't you cut in till I have finished my remarks," an- swered my tow-headed cousin. "A man tells me he is a philosopher. I respect that man. I say to myself, 'Really, here is a person who is going to discover all sorts of things.' If he says he is a metaphysician, my admiration increases, and I say to myself, 'Here, indeed, is a hero. Here is the man for my money. Here is a chap about to devote a life to theO impossible. Here is a fellow who is going to become a scien- tific Ajax, defying the thunder.' It is true, that, if the bolt had struck Ajax, he would have felt pretty small, and found defiance no great shakes of a lightning rod. But we admire Ajax all the same. Whether he be a poetical or a metaphys- ical lightning-defier, it is all the same." "And why shouldn't we?"I asked.    <pb n="378-379" xml:id="VAC6560-00000198"/> 378       DREAMS WITHN DREAMS. "Why not?" echoed my tow-headed cousin; " why not, indeed? The Chinese have written books on politeness. So many bows for a sixpenny present; so many for a shilling one; so many for one which costs eighteen pence. The class- ical and philosophical writers have composed a similar code. So much admiration for the Trojan horse; so much for Jupiter Tonans; so much for Ajax putting his thumb to his nose at the Tonans of Jove. You must not say the Trojan horse was a clumsy contrivance. You must not say Jupiter was an old Lothario, always running after the girls. You must not con- sider Ajax a great ass, who defied lightning because he might have known (and probably did) that the lightning was not going to bother itself about him or his rage. No. The code of classic politeness settles the matter, and you must admire where your ancestors admired, and not presume to condemn anything but what Doctors Smith, Jones, and Robinson hae-. condemned. So with metaphysics. By all means pretend to understand. You will know fill as much as the rest, and, by a little concession, will pass for a shining light, whether you understand or not. Read, at all costs. Be sure to learn the headings of the chapters. You need not trouble yourself about the contents. Indeed, it is better not to read the contents, be- cause then you can invent as you go on, and you can't miss it, if you only talk vaguely enough." "Well, have you done?"I asked, seeing he paused. "No, I am only a little out of breath," replied my tow- headed cousin. "But I will be, soon. I am also glad to see you have a slap at progress. That is delicious. But I would not say so. I would keep it to myself. I would believe it, and keep it to myself. As a general rule, always say what the world says, and keep your own opinion. You will thus pass for a sensible man; for our contemporaries judge us favorably or not, according as we flatter or defy their opinion. It is all very well to talk of freedom of speech. There is no such thing, never was, and never will be, this side of eternity. So let me advise you to stick to the popular worship, to adore mysticism and rationalism, and to swear by the nineteenth cen- tury." "Bah!" cried the Codger, removing his dirty pipe from his mouth (he always smokes, by the way, the filthiest speci- mens of pipes procurable in or out of the market). "Bah I What are you talking about? What is it to the reading world of this century whether you are right or wrong? Give them   DREAMS WITHN DREAMS.       379 originality, and you may advocate what you will. A pinch of the improper, indeed, spices the work. I think a writer who would set to work to prove the globe was square, or white black, would really dispose advantageously of his work." "After Consuelo," observed Cheesy, "only a maniac could  doubt that." "Ah," said I, kicking up my heels, and smoking vigor- ously, " there it is! Dispose of your work, eh? My talent a'n't in that line. The auri sacra fames is an epidemic, and I, like the rest of the world, have caught the disease. But I never shall be a Croesus, unless I have wealth thrust upon me." "You are about right there," said my candid friend. "Do you know of what you remind me?" "Something disagreeable, I suppose," said I, sulkily. "You are half right," answered my candid friend. "You remind me of one of those useless old pieces of furniture, with crooked legs of unequal size, and drawers which it requires a struggle to. open when shut, and a pitch battle to shut when open; a crazy old piece of lumber, with angles to knock your kneepans against, and then dance and holler like the deuce; a rickety old ugly thing, with leaves that give way unexpectedly, and break things." "Nice, upon my word!" growled I. "Nice as a curiosity, perhaps," said my candid friend, "but confoundedly nasty for any useful purpose. What under the sun are you writing a book for?" "I am sure I don't know," said I, feebly. "I suppose it is to sell it; but I never looked upon the subject in that light before." "H adn't you better hurry up, and do it now?" inquired my candid friend. "I don't know but that I had," I replied. "If people are bored, can't they shut up the book? If they lose the worth of their money, don't they get off cheaply? Who would not pay a small sum to get rid of a bore?" "And may not the publisher have something to say about all that?" asked my candid friend. "Bless my soul I " said I; "I never thought of the pub- lisher either. I suppose he will manage the thing all right." "But how?" pursued niy candid friend. How?"I repeated, feebly. "Oh somehow-" *    t *   *        t   ft    <pb n="380-381" xml:id="VAC6560-00000199"/> 380       DREAMS WITHN DREAMS. The critical reader may naturally here ask me a question, which, I honestly confess, I have asked of myself, namely, "' Has this chapter a head or a tail? and, if so, where are they?" After diligently reading it over, I must reply, that I don't know myself. What then?  The thing is written, and I am not going to write it over again. Lazie by name, and lazy by nature, the terrible fatigue of thinking is a little too much for me. Besides, I don't know but there is a great deal of wisdom lying about loose somewhere in the chapter. The thing is vague, it is true; but why not? It gives the reader-(I can say reader, since I am certain to have one, if it is only myself; for I have a prodigious opinion of my own works)-it gives, I say, the reader a faint glimpse of the glorious scenes yet to come, just as the perfume of the kitchen salutes our noses with promises of unborn joys, when dinner is still in a chaotic con- dition down in the saucepans and on the spits. So let it stand, beautiful as the aspect of dim nature, when the first ethereal drop of blood tinges the cheek of Aurora and Phoebus, etc. CHAPTER XXXV. CONTINUING THE STORY. THE usual circle had assembled round the fire of Ernest Toservem's inn, and much conversation was there on divers subjects important and unimportant, when Coffin, squinting at the courtplaster which graced the end of his. nose, asked: "Where is the little man with the sore head?" "He will be in soon," said Ernest. "The war seems finished, don't it?" asked Jonathan Sewell, the tailor. "Yes," answered Shuttle; "it looks very like peace." "The Professor told me so," remarked Jonathan. "He is pretty spruce now," observed Shuttle. "I suppose he will clean himself up now, and go sparking. Do you know, I shouldn't be surprised if he took a wife to his bosom?" Coffin glared vindictively at the weaver, and said: "You   DREAMS WITHN DREAMS.        381 talk of a wife, as if a husband was a wet nurse. But he won't try." "I suppose not," replied Samson, musing. "He is too wrapped up in the child." "I wish," said Coffin, in a sepulchral tone, "I wish you would talk like a Christian, Samson Shuttle. You would spoil the best language ever invented. Who ever heard of a man being wrapped up in a child?" "Ay," remarked Ernest. "A man can be wrapped up. Can't you say, So-and-so was wrapped up in a woollen com- forter?" "Yes, I can, Ernest Toservem," replied Coffin, snappishly; "and I suppose the Professor ties little Gertrude round his neck to keep his nose warm, don't he?"So saying, Solomon again squinted hideously at the courtplaster. "True," assented Ernest, struck by this new way of putting the case. "You are right. One man cannot be wrapped up in another." "Of course he cannot," continued Coffin. "You might say a man was wrapped up in a boa constrictor, after he was swallowed whole; but the notion of that little girl rolling the Professor up in a ball, and popping him down her throat, is a little too rich." To this, all except Shuttle assented. The weaver, being in the minority, said nothing. Solomon sat chuckling in his corner. Ernest looked profound, and Jonathan sat gravely smoking, when Ebenezer and Smaragdus entered with Leander. Oh!" cried the wretched little man, "I have such a sore head. If you touched it, I believe it would split. Ohl I have such a nice story for you all. Oh! you cannot imagine how nice a story I have for you all. Oh! you have not the least idea how nice a story I have for you all." "What is it? ' cried omnes. "What is it?" repeated the wretched little man. "Oh I it is a nice story. Here is my authority. Oh I he told me all. Come here, Leander, and tell the nice story you have for all." Leander, being thus adjured, said: "There is great doings about. Master Clovis has gone and fowt the devil." "Dear me!" cried Jonathan Sewell, the tailor. "Yes," continued Leander. "The devil came to him in his room, where a cousin of mine, called Peter, was hid; and they had an awful fight; and Clovis beat him; and he fell down; and there has been a great fuss."    <pb n="382-383" xml:id="VAC6560-00000200"/> 382      DREAMS WITHN DREAMS. "Nonsense!" cried Coffin, glaring at Leander ferociously. "How do you know Peter has not been humbugginlg you?" "Because I do," replied Leander. "Haven't I seen the Count and the Countess on the matter? And didn't I get blown up on the matter? And didn't I get kicked upon the matter? And didn't I get hustled out of the castle on the matter? Dear! dear! Will I never be let alone? Why are people always blackguarding me, and punching may head, and kicking me, and turning me out of somewhere?" "How did it all happen?" asked Samson. "I will tell you," replied Leander. "When Peter told me, I thought I would just step up to the Countess, and ask her if it was true. She got scared, I believe you, and sent for Peter, who told her all. Then the Count was sent for, and came. And then, wasn't there a row kicked up?  'You blackguard I' says he to me; ' how dared you go and frighten my wife?' 'I a'n't a blackguard,' says I. 'Peter told me-' 'The devil take Peter, and you too,' says he, interrupting me. 'Didn't you know better than to go and frighten a mother that way? ' ' Why,' says I, 'why shouldn't I tell his mother? I couldn't go and tell his grandmother, could I?' ' Come to me, next time,' says he. 'Yes, and get called a blackguard,' says I. 'You dare bandy words with me, do you? ' says he; and, with that, he kicks me all the way down stairs; and he is mighty strong in the legs, and he gave me a kick for every step, and it is a long flight, and I am mighty sore." "The story sounds probable enough," said Samson, "espe- cially the latter part. It sounds just like the Count." "Yes, and it feels like the Count,' said Leander, rubbing the afflicted part. "The devil is in the castle, and a mighty muscular one, too." "Alive and kicking, eh?" asked Coffin, squinting at the courtplaster. "Kicking?" answered Leander. "I believe you." "When are you going back?" inquired Solomon, with a grim smile. "Going back?" replied Leander, horrified. "Why, I wouldn't go back to that castle, not for nothing." "Gentlemen," said Ernest, blowing out a long cloud of smoke, "I tell you what. Our strange lodger has a finger in that pie, somehow or another. He cries in his sleep, and my wife and I distinctly heard him, last night, talk about a fight he had up at the castle."   DREAMS WITHN DREAMS.       383 "You don't say so 1 " said Jonathan. "Ay, but I do," replied Ernest. "And about Gertrude. There is something in his face I can't make out. Sometimes I think I know him, and sometimes, again, I think I don't. I can't say. But he's no good, depend upon it." Ernest's eye, at this moment, happened to rest on Smarag- dus, who nodded assent, much to the innkeeper's astonishment; for he had not the most remote idea that that gentleman ever took note of anything except victuals and drink. He was roused by the entrance of the Professor, who gave his customary salutation, and took his usual seat. Ernest then resumed: i I don't like this new guest of mine at all," said he; " and that's a fact. He spends money freely enough, but he seems always afraid of something, and is always looking kind of scared over his shoulder. You had better look out, Professor, by the by." The Professor looked up inquiringly. "I have a mysterious guest, who talks in. his sleep about your little girl-that's all," continued Ernest. "He has been asking me several questions about her already-where she lives, when she goes out, and so forth." "Tell me more about him," said the Professor, becoming pale. "Is he a pleasant man? Is he old enough to be her father?" "Decidedly not," replied Ernest. "He is neither pleasant, nor old enough. He looks deuced like-now who the deuce does he look like? I could swear I had seen him before." "You trouble me very much," said the old man. "Well, I thought you ought to know it," remarked Ernest. "You are right, friend," said the other; " yet it troubles me, I cannot say why. I always feared my darling would be taken from me. Yet, why fear? The child was surely born for better things than I could give her." "Why, man alive," remarked Coffin, kindly, although he glared malevolently at the tip of his nose, " why, man alive, you don't suppose, should a rich relation turn up, you would be forgotten, do you? No, no. You will live near her then, and see her happy. Nobody then will suspect you,?ke that fool of a Shuttle-" "I say," quoth the gentleman referred to, "shut up, will you?" "Like that fool of a Shuttle," continued Coffin, loftily    <pb n="384-385" xml:id="VAC6560-00000201"/> 384      DREAMS WITHN DREAMS. ignoring Samson's presence, " of taking her to your bosom, and tying her round your throat to keep your nose warm." The old man brightened up. Surely," said he, "you are right. Providence is always kind, and it is we who misunder- stand its workings when it appears otherwise. Surely would I rejoice to see my darling a great lady. And if"-here he fal- tered a little-" if she forgot me, I could pray for her." Bravo!" cried Ernest. "Take some more beer, friend." "Do," growled Smaragdus, like a benevolent bear. I thank you," said the Professor, gently. "I have ex- ceeded my allowance. I must go home now, and think over all this. It is so new to me." And, so saying, he sadly left the room. "Oh dear!" squeaked the wretched little man, when the Professor had left; "ohl dear! A'n't we struck of a heap l What an old hypocrite! To come for to go for to make us believe she is not his child I To come for to go, for to-" Here the wretched little man was brought to by a dexter- ous crack on his bullet head, administered by Smaragdus. "You be still!" growled that gentleman. "You be still, or you'll get another." "Oh, my sore head!" screeched Ebenezer. "Oh  you will be the death of me, one day. Oh, what agony I Get me some sticking plaster. Something is broken somewhere, I know." "Stop howling " growled Smaragdus; and, having spo- ken so much, he was naturally fatigued. So he reposed his jaws, drank eight imperial quarts of malt liquor, and stumped up to bed. Albert returned late, and Ernest, who was sitting up to wait for him, let him in. Ernest looking at his guest rather more attentively than pleased him, Albert said, with a frown: "What are you staring at, man?" Have I not seen you before?" asked the innkeeper. "Yes," replied Albert. "What then?" Ernest murmured something about natural curiosity. "Listen," said Albert, sternly. "I wish to come and go as I please, and without questions. Do you hear? You do? Well, then, enough of this trifling." He snatched the light rudely from Ernest, shook his head at him, and strode up stairs. Ernest looked puzzled, scratched his head, shook it wisely, and retired for the night. Albert strode up and down, thinking. He was to meet La   DREAMS WITHN DREAMS.        385 Chambre the next day, after having an interview with the Pro- fessor. La Chambre had heard all his plans, and applauded them to the letter, although there was certainly a strange ex- pression about his eyes as Albert had developed his intentions. So matters stood between the worthy gentlemen. Looking hastily over his shoulder, Albert set the candle on the table, and flung himself on the bed. In about five hours he woke. The candle had burned out. Somebody, he thought, was leaning over him, and he started up with a shriek, struck a light, and looked fearfully around. The thing was gone. The day was breaking, as he stood at the window, trembling and cursing. And so the next day came. Now there is one peculiarity about Bertrand, which strikes the eye of the most unobserving stranger; and that is, its being pretty much the same to-day as it was five hundred years ago, and will be, probably, five hundred years hence. As the villagers are now, so have they been for centuries, with the tri- fling exception that people do die there occasionally. In com- mon with all other villages, it was a gossiping, calumnious little heap of houses; and consequently, when Albert walked out in the morning, every eye was on him, and everybody knew he was mysterious, down to the boys, who coughed loudly as he passed, and the dogs, who smelled his legs from thhind suspi- ciously. Hardly heeding them, Albert went on his purpose as stead- ily as if it were virtuous. It never occurred to the young man that La Chambre might be playing him false. It never oc- curred to him to ask who Gertrude was. Passion displayed him in the miserable character of the foolish wicked. Had he known the relationship existing between the child and his con- federate, he would have better understood the flush that crim- soned his companion's cheek as he developed his plans. And, even not knowing it, if he had not been blinded by anger, lie might have suspected that his devilish intention was not likely to find an echo even in the heart of the most depraved; for, to tle worst-God be blessed 1-there is generally an appeal which unresisting innocence makes, that softens them, if they only have time to reflect. But the infatuated man heard nothing save the depraved counsels of the devil that possessed him, and so hurried him on to the end. v;-l   EHis first object was to gather all information he could re- specting the child. He found Ebenezer on the porch, chatting 17    <pb n="386-387" xml:id="VAC6560-00000202"/> 350      DREAMS WITHN DREAMS. with Smaragdus; so he opened the conversation, by asking who was that old man he saw in the inn last night? Smaragdus opened his eyes, until they looked like two fishy globes. "Hey!" cried the wretched little man.  "And where were you? I did not see you." "I hardly know what I am saying," replied Albert, slightly confused. "'I did not mean last night. I mean generally. I have seen an old man coming in and out, with a child some- times, and sometimes without her. Who is he?" Smaragdus grinned a broad grin.  "Oh!" cried the wretched little man, grinning likewise; "I know all about him. Oh I he's an old rake." "He is, is he?" said Albert, encouraging him to talk. "Oh I that he is," replied the wretched little man. I He is a bad one, you may depend upon it, for all the way he has of showing you the white of his eyes." "Indeed I " said Albert, leaning against the wall. "You can't say what he is up to," continued the wretched little man. "Oh! I have no doubt his conscience is populated with lots of babies." "And this child?" asked Albert. "Interesting," said Ebenezer, critically. "Cleaned up and tittivated, I have no doubt she would be handsome." "You seem to know all about these things," remarked Albert. "Ohl yes," replied the wretched little man, greatly flat- tered. "But what are you up to? Anything in the exposure line?"I 4"I don't mind telling you," said Albert, confidentially, "because I see you and your companion are two men of the world. Your advice would be invaluable." Smaragdus smoked violently. Ebenezer, who, if there was one thing nearer and dearer to him than anything else, it was a good sound calumny, pricked up his ears amazingly. "I shall have to ask you one or two questions as I go along," continued Albert; "and any observation you wish to make, will doubtless be valuable." Smaragdus looked stolidly at Albert. The wretched little mnan was delighted. "I am here," continued Albert, " trying to prove a charge of kidnapping, and to bring it home to the old man. "Now this is delicious!" said Ebenezer.  "In order to do this," pursued Albert, "I must have evi dence."   DREAMS WITHN. DREAMS.    3.87 'I do not think that would be legal," remarked Ebenezer, profoundly. "How so?" inquired Albert, not a little puzzled. "I do not think evidence is justified by law," replied Eben- ezer. "It would be far better to call in witnesses. Two or three of them, a few circumstances, and such like, is better than all the evidence in the world." Thank you," said Albert. "I am very much obliged to you for the suggestion." "Not at all," answered Ebenezer, politely, "You are quite welcome." "I shall then call witnesses." said Albert. "You had better," remarked the wretched little man. "Having witnesses," continued .Albert, "you see, the rest would be easy; that is to say, if they could attest to the child's being kidnapped." "I do not think," said Ebenezer, dubiously, ' that the law permits witnesses to attest to a fact. You had much better have them prove it." Here the wretched little man was interrupted by Smarag- dus in the usual manner; that gentleman fetching him a crack over the skull with a small log intended for the fire, about two feet long by five inches thick. "Don't be a fool," quoth Smaragdus, as he accomplished the manoeuvre. "I wish you were in the sepulchre, I do," howled the wretched little man, rubbing his head. "Don't you know how sore I am up there?" "Don't be a fool," repeated Smaragdus. "My good friend-" interposed Albert. "Don't you be a fool," said Smaragdus. "I'd as lief heave this log at you, as anybody else." "But, my good friend," remonstrated Albert, "I see no reason for your flinging that elegant weapon at anybody." "Don't you?" replied Smaragdus, shortly. "No I de't, really," answered Albert. "You, too, with your kidnapping," said Smaragdus. "If that Ebenezer tells you another word, or if I catch him at it, I'll give him particular fits." "Why, you don't mean to say that you let that fellow knock you about as he pleases, and make you hold your tongue whenever he chooses?" asked Albert, addressing the wretched little man.    <pb n="388-389" xml:id="VAC6560-00000203"/> 388      DREAMS WITHN DREAMS. "Yes, I do," replied Ebenezer; "and, what is more, you would too, if you was me." "Would I?" said Albert. "Let any one try it; that's all. " "If you was a man always getting into trouble," continu- d Ebenezer, "you would want a protector too." "Is that fat-tub a protector?" inquired Albert. "I can- not see how he is, unless you crawl down his throat when dan- ger approaches, like young snakes." "- He knows how to mind his own business," said Smarag- dus, sullenly, " which you don't." "But why all this anger?" inquired Albert, more respect- fully, for he found the " fat-tub" had more in him than he thought at first. "I know when a chap's lying," answered Smaragdus. "You had better sheer off, my man. You won't get any more out of us." Albert was greatly enraged, but, reflecting on the absurdity of such a quarrel, frowned, and strode off. "That person," said Smaragdus, pointing at Albert's re- treating figure with the stem of his pipe, "that person, Eben- ezer, is everything bad. Don't you have nothing to do with him, or I will cave your skull in." And, being weary after so much exertion, Smaragdus called for some beer, and fell into a half torpid state for the remainder of the day. Albert then proceeded to the house of Dame Chervin, feel- ing that many more such rebuffs would disqualify him for his investigations, and seeing that he was evidently a suspicious character to the gentlemen and ladies of the village. When he reached the little cottage where Gertrude lived, he found the Professor smoking his pipe on the porch. The child was en- gaged with her doll, and was sitting on the steps chatting with the old man, who sat regarding her with a fond, sad smile. "Good morning, friend," said Albert. "Can I have a few words with you, alone?" The Professor cast an alarmed glance toward Albert, and, silently bowing, led the way to his own house. When they arrived there, he motioned his companion to a seat, and then took another himself. "I am sorry to trouble you," began Albert; "but, as you have been very kind to the child of one of my friends, I came personally to thank you."   DRESEAMS WrrM  DREAMS.      389 "The child of one of your friends?" repeated the other. "Yes," replied Albert. "The story is a sad one. I was commissioned to look after her, years ago, and never traced her until to-day." "And her parents?" suggested the old man. "Are both dead," replied Albert. "The mother died when the child was born; the father, some three years before." "The father died three years before the child was born?" asked the Professor, with round eyes. "Did I say before?" said Albert, coloring. "I meant after. Both the parents died in the deepest poverty. I my- self am not rich, and hardly know what to do." The Professor's face brightened. "If," said he, "if this be the case, where can the child be better than where she is?" "Nowhere, I am sure," replied Albert. "I willingly-- nay, gratefully-leave her under your care. I am sure I owe you that at least for your benevolence and charity. But I stipulate for one thing." "And what is that?" "That I may sometimes come and see the child of my old friend." "Surely, surely," said the simple old man, affected by what he considered Albert's delicate remembrance of the dead, "you needed not have made any such stipulation. Any one can come, and welcome.  I, too, feel with you, friend. The thoughts of the departed hold fast to me." "As I said before," continued Albert, "I love my dead friend. Let me come at twilight, and smoke a pipe on the porch with you. I have very little money, but I should like to aid you when I can-for the child, you understand." "Now," thought thehold man, " now this is a noble young man. How appearances deceive!"  Indeed, there was a luxury in patronizing a poor man, which the Professor had not tasted for many years. "Be- sides," he argued, "I have no right to deny the widow her mite; and a little money, now and then, could certainly be dis- posed of advantageously." "Allow me to begin with this," said Albert, putting down ten pieces of gold on the table. "But keep the matter a secret. I was obliged, this morning, to palm off a false report on the villagers, who are curious to know why I was here. Indeed," he continued, laughing, "to put them off the scent, I left them under the impression that I accused you of kidnap- ping the child."    <pb n="390-391" xml:id="VAC6560-00000204"/> 390      DREAMS WITHN DREAMS. The Professor's countenance fell. He looked first at the money, and then at Albert; then, leaning on his knees, he scanned his companion's face for some time, and at length said quietly, "Please take back your gold." Albert frowned. "Why?" he asked. "Friend," replied the other;, "you are an educated man, and will understand the words of A Kempis: 'Vellem me pluries tacuisse; et inter homines non fuisse.' "' "I do not," answered Albert. "You must translate them, and give me the application." "I think you understand both meaning and application very well," said the old man. "Yet, as I may be mistaken, I will give you both: ' Often have I wished I had been silent, and not gone into the company of men.' It will be better for both of us, if I do not open my lips. I would prefer not giving my reasons." "'In common justice to me, you are bound to do so, after what you have just said," replied Albert, with a frown. "Since you urge it, then, I will," said the other. Re- member, I speak at your own request. It is still time for me to refrain." "I repeat my desire," replied Albert. "Plainly, then," said the other, "I think you are deceiving me. According to your own story, you have been deceiving others. A man, as charitable as you pretend to be, might not wish his right hand to know what his left was doing; but Christians never use falsehood to accomplish a good work." Albert looked at him angrily. "You are insulting, old man," said he. "I meant not to be so," returned the other, mildly. ," Young man, perhaps I have spoken harshly. Forgive me. You have, perhaps, a kind motive; but I cannot help my sus- picions. I have been wrestling with a sad presentiment for some time past. I feel as if a dark cloud hung over me. Do you know," he continued, half addressing his companion, half speaking to himself, " do you know I had a strange dream last night? I thought little Gertrude led me to the top of a high place. I thought she smiled, and pointed to heaven. Then I thought a serpent crawled up out of a hole, and stung me. And lightning seemed to come out of heaven, and strike the snake, and as it died; the thunder roused me, and I awoke. But let us end this painful conference. Go forth boldly. Prove your -claim, and come for the child. I will then ask you to pardon my doubts. Until then, keep your gold."   DRKEAMS WITHN DREAMS.       391 And, so saying, he gently forced the money into Albert's hand. "Baffled again I " muttered the young man to himself, as he walked away. "Simple, stupid, or gossiping, they all seem to detect my motive at once. I wonder whether La Chambre was right, after all, and that there is a hidden power, called Providence, always active? And then that dream I Wlhy should that dream affect me? Could I have had one like it? While he was relating it, I seemed half to anticipate every- thing he said. There are men who aver that we have had an existence previous-to our being born on this earth, and that we sometimes have thus dim recollections of the mighty past. But that cannot be. Surely man was not destined to be eter- nally repeating a series of the same thoughts, words, and actions. No. I must have had a dream very like-it, the par- ticulars of which I have forgotten, while my memory retains a vague, general recollection of the vision." While Albert was thus engaged, he would have been sur- prised had he known all that was passing in La Chambre's mind. With all his vices (and they were many), and with all his selfishness (and it was great), La Chambre's family pride was moved to the very foundation by the diabolical plans of' Albert. The reader may. guess something of what is to come, in seeing him pace up ahd down, his face working with pas- sion, as he kept muttering to himself: "The daughter of our house--the daughter of our house." So one passion often neutralizes another; and so, in the conflict of our worst impulses, the adage is often true, that when thieves fall out, honest men get their due. CHAPTER XXXVI. A GREAT DISCUSSION WITHOUT GREAT RESULTS, AND DIVERS OTHER THNGS INSTRUCTIVE, ENTERTANINING  COMPREHEN- SIBLE, AND INCOMPREEENSIBLE. Now there had been a very long consultation at the castle over the papers brought by Clovis. In the first place, they proved the marriage, the birth of the child, and her mysterious    <pb n="392-393" xml:id="VAC6560-00000205"/> 392      DREAMS WITHN DREAMS. disappearance. Next, by a letter from Gertrude Gallahaut's mother, they showed that the child was a girl, and named Ger- trude. Finally, from a description of the infant, no reasonable being could doubt the identity of the little girl with the infant daughter of Uphorn. Still the proof was not sufficient; for there may be enough evidence to constitute moral conviction, when there is not sufficient to prove the fact in the eyes of the law. "It is not yet time," said Piquemont, "to inform the Duke; yet still we now have good hope of discovering his child, even if little Gertrude be not the one we seek. I should, however, advise her being instantly removed to a place of security, since, if our surmises be correct, she is hardly safe, where she is, from La Chambre's machinations." "Would you separate her from her present guardian?" inquired Godfroy. "No, indeed," said the Count. "Let them come here. Clovis, go right away, and fetch them." Nobody objecting, Clovis departed. "And now," continued Piquemont, turning to 'the Count, "as your eldest son's memory is interested in the disclosure, I wish, Bertrand, you would hear something Clodolphus has to say." "But I don't want--" began the Count, when he was in- terrupted by Piquemont, who said: "Clodolphus has promised me not to make a single quota- tion." So saying, he smiled, and looked at my lord Clodolphus, who nodded knowingly. "Very well," replied the Count; " then I will listen to him until doomsday." "The doomsday book-" began my lord Clodolphus, when he was happily checked by a look from Piquemont; whereat he apologized, and said he forgot. "What I have to say," then added the learned man, "is that, although, in sooth, full ten years younger than myself, Charles and I were great friends. We fought, as you know, side by side, at the attack of St. Jean d'Angeli, and afterward at Montauhan, under Louis. The cause of the war verily-" "Never mind the cause of the war," said Piquenmont. "Well," continued my lord Clodolphus, "we will pass over that. Some little time before Charles's death, when I was on a visit here, I saw a great change had come over him. One   DREAMS WITHN DREAMS.        393 day, as I was out in the forest, I met a man of immense size, with a huge red head of hair-I should verily say more than six feet high." "Do you mean to tell a respectable mat, that you saw a man whose hair grew up six feet above his head?" asked the Count, indignantly. "In sooth, no," quoth my lord Clodolphus. "The six feet appertained to the man, not the hair." "How can that be," asked the Count, "when you distinctly said he had a huge red head of hair more than six feet high?" "Let him go on, and never mind such trifles," suggested Piquemont, mildly. "Let him go on l" cried the Count. "Ah, but I won't let him go on, and tell'me a man's hair, under any possible combi- nation of circumstances, can stand up like a lilac bush." "But he declares he never meant to say so," urged Pique- mont. "Oh, indeed!" rejoined the Count. "By and by he will be telling me I have a horse's tail, and then will be denying he ever said anything of the kind. Now I am not going to stand that, you know." "But the importance of the subject," pleaded Piquemont. "The very reason for being particular in what you say," replied the Count. "Then I will try to speak plainly," said my lord Clodol- phus. "I know this person was Uphorn disguised. I found it out in rather a singular way. Charles, Clovis, and myself, in sooth, were one day amusing ourselves with javelins, and try- ing to pick the hens off the fence-" "Oho!" cried the Count. "That's the way my hens go, is it? A beautiful incident to relate! And you confess it without a blush on your bulging cheeks I You and my sons to fly in my very face and kill my very hens with my very spears on my very fences I Upon my word I " "For goodness' sake, Bertrand," urged Piquemont, "do leave those worthless hens of yours alone for an instant." "I like that!" cried the Count. "Worthless hens! Of all hens in the world, to call mine worthless! Are my hens never to be secure from marauders? Am I to find their assas- sins even in the bosom of my family, and in the guest at my table? Clodolphus Clodolphus I this is worse than a hundred quotations." "Shall I continue?" inquired my lord Clodolphus. 17*    <pb n="394-395" xml:id="VAC6560-00000206"/> 394      DREAMS WITHN DREAMS. "Yes," answered the Count, " if you will make me a sacred promise never to kill any more hens of mine, and never to shy stones, sticks, brickbats, or any other missile at them." "I do," quoth my lord Clodolphus. "Henceforth I will aim only at the ducks." "The deuce you will!" cried the Count. "Have I not yet verily given you satisfaction?" asked my lord Clodolphus. "Satisfaction, indeed!" cried the Count. "You must know the oath is to be registered as much concerning ducks, as hens; in fine, including all the poultry-geese, ganders, and goslings; hens, cocks, and chickens; ducks, drakes, and duck- lings; turkeys, gobblers, and little turkeys; bantams, pollan- ders, game, and dunghill; white, black, brown, and mottled." "Very well," said my lord Clodolphus; "and, now we have settled this little matter, shall I proceed?" "My poultry," continued the Count, "their nests, coops, eggs, feathers, ponds, food, drink, and so forth, are sacred things. They must not be touched, or I begin to raise my back." "Very well," quoth my lord Clodolphus; "and now let me continue. After I killed the hen-" "My hens," said the Count, " must not even be looked at, but with an eye of reverence." "Confound your hens!" cried my lord Clodolphus, losing patience. "If you don't listen, I'll wring every one of their blessed necks." "You will, will you?" said the Count. "Oh, for a word to express my defiance! Oh, for a language sufficient to show my indignation!  "Well, you can hunt them up, you know, by and by," said my lord Clodolphus, who, on any subject but books, was wont to humor the Count in his peculiarities. "When I have fin- ished, you can fire away to your heart's content." "Mighty well!" said the Count, snorting like a walrus. "Why, man, verily was I only facetious," quoth my lord Clodolphus. "Some subjects are too holy for jests," replied the Count. "Then," said my lord Clodolphus, "I beg your pardon, and likewise the pardon of the goodly congregation of the barnyard: the geese, the ganders, and the goslings; the hens, the cocks, and the chickens; the ducks, the drakes; and the ducklings; the big turkeys, the little turkeys, and the turkey   DREAMS WITHN DREAAMS.      395 gobbler; the bantams, pollanders, and muscovies; game, dung- hill, and dunghill game; white, black, blue, green, crimson, and yellow. There! And now you and your poultry may verily go to the deuce." And, with this courteous apology, magnificently bowed my lord Clodolphus. "My hens," replied the Count, "want no apology. All they want, is, for people to let them alone. You never heard of any of them rushing out and devouring the unwary travel- ler, have you?" -"I have not," quoth my lord Clodolphus. "Very well, then," reasoned the Count; "then why should the traveller rush in, and kill my hens? ' "How can you have roast goose for linner," asked my lord Clodolphus, " unless you first kill the goose?" Piquemont looked on in feeble despair, Godfroy with a laugh. "But I never said I wanted roast oose for dinner," an- swered the Count. "Ah!" said my lord Clodolphus. "Yes, ah!" retorted the Count. "But--" began Godfroy. "Don't set them on, for mercy's sake 1 " whispered Pique- mont. Godfroy grinned. "But what?" asked the Count. Godfroy hesitated, but his love of the whimsical prevailed. 'I don't think you give Clodolphus a fair chance," said he, "or he would beat you in the argument, so that you would never hold your head up again." "For shame, Godfroy!" remonstrated Piquemont, who could not help laughing, in spite of his vexation. "How would he beat me?" asked the Count, firing up at once. "How don't I give him a fair chance?" "You forbid him to quote," replied Godfroy; "and that is like tying a man's hands behind his back, and then challenging him to fight. If Clodolphus was fairly armed, he would un- horse you in two minutes." "Let him try," cried the Count, greatly excited. "Go on, Clodolphus. I' retract my demand. Give us Caesar, and the rest of them. Bless your soul you shall not say I shirked from any fair field. Fire away." "Comne, be generous for once, Clodolphus," pleaded Pique- mont, "and give up."    <pb n="396-397" xml:id="VAC6560-00000207"/> 396      DREAMS WITHN DREAMS. "Give up! Be generous!" repeated the Count. "That he shall not. I am not to be tricked that way. Come on, old Folio!" Seeing that, the more he remonstrated, the worse things became, Piquemont gave up in quiet despair. So the Count and my lord Clodolphus had a long and furious argument, in which they both grew exceedingly excited; and in the course of which, from having some general ideas of what they were talking about, they finally had not the least idea of what was the subject of discussion. Godfroy encouraged them from time to time, until they were both out of breath, and could talk no more; when they both appealed to him as umpire. Pretend- ing to consider the matter awhile, he at length gravely decided that the Count was defeated. This set him going again, just as Piquemont really began to hope the matter was ended. But my lord Clodolphus, who wash greatly elated at his victory, had the sense to let the Count alone, and the argument was closed by a defiance on the part of the latter, directed to society in general. The fight thus terminated, my lord Clodolphus was permit- ted quietly to resume his story; the only new point of which was the mentioning of one Margaret Halles, who, he thought, was the only person alive capable of clearing away the mys- tery, as she was known once to have been Madame Gallahaut's servant. "Margaret Halles be hanged!" said the Count, when my lord Clodolphus had finished. "Your story is a great piece of nonsense. What the deuce has Margaret Halles to do with the matter? If you Iare going to bring in all the fiiends and relations of the family, and hear what they have to say, you had better send for this Gallahaut woman's mother, ay, and her grandmother, and her great-grandmother, and so on, all the way up to Adam, together with all the collateral branches: which, no doubt, would be hugely to your liking, as including all man- kind, and consequently every author who ever lived." "Now why," thought Piquemopt, "why did I ever bring these two men here? I might have known that no consulta- tion could ever be decently carried on, with the two together in one room." Said my lord Clodolphus to the Count: "Ah, but you do not understand the matter." Said the Count to my lord Clodolphus: "Ah, but I do. Why don't I?"   DIEEBMS WITHN DREAMS.       397 "Because you don't listen," quoth my lord Clodolphus. "There can verily be no wrong in trying to find out all we can. In sooth, to me, the hunting up evidence is delectable."* "I dare say it is," returned the Count, " especially where a woman is concerned." "And what would be the harm if I did?" inquired my lord Clodolphus. "What would be the harm if you did?" echoed the Count. "Now, a'n't you ashamed of yourself?" "Why, what the deuce is the matter with you?" asked my lord Clodolphus. "The harm 1" continued the Count. "Haven't you any morality? Haven't you any idea of what is right, and what is wrong?" "But we want Margaret," urged my lord Clodolphus. "Speak in the singular, if you please," answered the Count. We do not want her. You want her." Said my lord Clodolphus: "Well, then, I want her." "And so do I," said Piquemont. And I also," added Godfroy. "Well, you can't all have her," cried the Count. "You, Godfroy, are engaged; and you two are too old to be thinking of changing your condition." "Why, you don't think we want to marry her, do you?" asked my lord Clodolphus. "We are verily not inclined that way."' ( So much the more shame on you, then," replied the Count. "But you shall not do any such a thing in my house. You, Piquemont, are the worst of the three." "Nonsense, Bertrand," said Piquemont, smiling. "You don't believe that yourself." "Just what I thought,' returned the Count. "Clodolphus has been addling his brains, as usual. He and Godfroy are the ravishers." At this, Godfroy grinned, and my lord Clodolphus burst into a loud laugh, much to the Count's wrath. "Ah," cried he, "you may grin and laugh; but he laughs best who laughs last. When the devil has his claw on you, you will laugh on the other side of your mouths, let me tell Vou." "Bosh " exclaimed my lord Clodolphus. "What saith Tully?" "Never mind what Tully says," answered the Count, nod-    <pb n="398-399" xml:id="VAC6560-00000208"/> *D0      DIREAM8 WITIIN DREAMS. ding his head. "You wait till you hear what Beelzebub says.'? "Surely," urged Piquemont, " you will take my word that you are mistaken?" "How can I be mistaken?" asked the Count, resentfully. "My best friends love to tell me I am always wrong. But here the case is a little too plain. Look at those two. Just look at them--grinning like a couple of skulls." "But you really have misunderstood them," said Pique- mont. "Nonsense!" replied the Count. "I have two ears, I suppose? A'n't those two already rivals? Didn't they both just tell me they wanted this Margaret? Goodness gracious l am I to be bullied into the idea that I am a born fool?" "But we only want her for a witness," explained my lord Clodolphus. "A witness for what?" asked the Count. "To prove whatever she can," said Piquemont. "Pooh! pooh!" cried the Count.  "That is all stuff. Who ever heard of a man courting a woman for such a pur- pose? I don't seek women, to make them prove anything-- unless it is to prove agreeable while I am by. Then why should you?" "So you like agreeable women, do you?" asked Godfroy, laughing. The Count winked.  Piquemont, encouraged by this to hope a little, now ventured a remark. "This Margaret," said he, "must be pretty old, I fancy." "If she is old," said the Count, "why, let the woman alone. I dare say she has wrinkles and gray hair." "No; but let us come to the point," remonstrated Pique- mont. "Just what I have been trying to do this half hour," re- plied the Count. "And, now I think of it, what is the point? Begin all over again." Said my lord Clodolphus: "We want this Margaret Galla- haut-at least, I don't mean Margaret Gallahaut--at any rate, we want her testimony as to the identity of the daughter of Gertrude Halles-at least, I don't mean Gertrude Halles; I mean-" "Oh " interrupted the Count, " do have mercy on me. What on earth are you talking about? You want the evi- dence of somebody who never existed, to prove the identity of   DREAMS WITlIN DREAMS.        399 somebody who was never born. Now, did ever one Christian man see another Christian man before, sitting placidly in an armchair talking such appalling nonsense?" 4"It is lucky," thought Piquemont, " that we have plenty of time. I give it up for to-day." "You won't hear me out," said my lord Clodolphus. "Verily you are so quick, you make me nervous." "Nervous I " cried the Count. "I like that. Here is a man talking absurdity by the yard, and then blaming me for it." ' But-" began my lord Clodolphus. "He kills my liens," summed up the Count, with divers snorts. "He tells me he saw a man with hair six feet high. He goes after his Margarets. He says he don't want her, after having sworn he did for full half an hour. He informs me that there is no such a person, and he wants to find her to prove the existence of another person, who, he assures me, never drew the breath of life. And then he says I make him nervous." "But, Count--" began Godfroy. "Yes; and you are as bad as he," said the Count. "There you sit, giggling, and grinning, and backing him up with his Margarets, and telling me I am deaf, and all kinds of things- just as if I were a raving lunatic, let loose to prey on society." "Still, my dear Bertrand-" began Piquemont. "'And you are the worst of the three," said the Count. "Where is your sympathy? Where is your friendship? Haven't we known each other since we were boys? And yet you can see me here, the victim of oppression in the shape of two ravishers." As the victim of oppression was pretty excited by this time, the three set to work to console him. Piquemont soothed him by taking the ground thlat the fault lay in their bungling way of relating facts; to which the Count graciously assented with a sniff. Godfroy put him in good humor, by assuring him that he had laughed only to see how thoroughly he (the Count) had put down my lord Clodolphus; to which the Count replied by a chuckle. Taking the hint, my lord Clodolphus confessed to the defeat; at which the Count remarked, that he thought him- self a match, any day, for any man. So the debate was adjourned, and they separated harmoni- ously. On the way down stairs, Piquemont privately remon- strated with Godfroy. "It is not of much consequence, as things stand," said he; " but, as a general rule, do not let your    <pb n="400-401" xml:id="VAC6560-00000209"/> 400      DR"AM S wrrHm  DREAMS. love of drollery move you to interrupt an important consulta- tion, no matter how ridiculous you may deem the interruption. Sometimes a moment is precious. And I shall take care, too," he added, with a smile, "never to hold a council at the same time with Bertrand and Clodolphus in the same room. The two have as much respect for each other as two men can have; but, for all that, I will never consult, at one and the same time, Count Bertrand and my lord Clodolphus." Now, while tie other gentlemen were busy enjoying them- selves, Piquemont drew Sir Wolfgang aside, and communicated to him what my lord. Clodolphus had said. "You see," he concluded, "the discovery of this Margaret Halles, if possible (and I think it is), would throw a light upon the whole affair greatly to be desired. Can you suggest anything?" Where was she seen last?" inquired Sir Wolfgang. "In Villaburg," replied Piquemont. "But that was so long ago, and our time is so precious, that really I do not see how that can help us." The knight considered a moment. "I think I can do some- thing-or, at least, I can try," said he, at length. "But, if you put the matter in my hands, you must let me go my own way to work." "My dear Wolfgang, that is just what I want," said Piquemont. "With your quiet way, you have more real merit than nine tenths of the men 1 know." The knight colored up with pleasure like a young girl. What do you think of my consulting Brother Stanislaus?" he asked.  Piquemont started. "You have untied the Gordian knot, which the keen blade of my wit could not even cut," he cried. "My dear boy, the difficulty is at an end-the problem is solved." "I," said my lord Clodolphus, coming up. at this moment, "I am of opinion that dragons and serpents have verily one and the same origin, both in natural and mythological history. Salamanders, in sooth, who are said to live in fire, and to have also force to extinguish the same, must be possessed, as Lord Bacon hath it, of two things for this operation; to wit, first, a very close skin, whereby flame (which, in the midst, is not so hot) cannot enter; and secondly, some ,extreme cold and quenching virtue in their bodies, which choketh the fire. The cockatrice is verily supposed to be hatched from a cock's egg. But here the question doth arise, Do cocks lay eggs? I be-   DREAMS WITHN DI.-l:M.\ .      401 lieve not. If, then, cocks do not lay eggs, surely can no ser- pents emerge therefrom; since something, I trow, cannot arise from nothing. And, if a cock lay no eggs, -then no cock's egg can produce a cockatrice. Quod erat demonstrandum.  In sooth, gallinaceous birds (such as the comimon poultry, as, like- wise, the tribe of pheasants, which contain divers sorts, as the wild, the frizzled, the dwarf, the negro, the crested, and sun- dry others)-gallinaceous birds, I say (whether Otis, Struthio, Didus, Pavo, Crax, Phasianus, or Tetrac), must be verily females, or there are no eggs; albeit a male is doubtless of use for the production of young. Therefore I reject the fable of the cockatrice. Only hens lay eggs." "What's that about hens?" inquired the Count, from the other end of the room. "Nothing," replied Piquemont. "Clodolphus is giving me quite interesting information. Come and listen to it." "I'll be hanged if I do I " said the Count. And he went ol with his conversation. "Dragons," continued my lord Clodolphus, "dragons are doubtless remnants of old biblical revelations concerning Satan, dished up to suit the tastes of different nations. The word 'dragon' means sleepless; and truly is the devil a watchful spirit, less given to slumber than was the many-eyed Argus. The same Lord Bacon whom I have already quoted, and who bequeathed posterity a little work entitled The Wisdom of the Ancients' (wherein he showeth the allegory contained in many of their fables; such as, Typhon, or a rebel; Styx, or leagues; Orpheus, or philosophy; Ccelum, or beginjings; Cupid, or an atom; Ericthonius, or imposture; Nemesis, or the vicissitude of things; Atalanta, or gain; Sphynx, or science; Metis, or counsel, and the like)-Bacon, I say, has thrown a clear, if not a new light on the way of properly understanding mythology. The dragon is an enormous winged serpent, voracious as .a wolf, strong as a lion, swift as the lightning, and sleepless as- as a dragon. In sooth, I am verily somewhat at a loss for a simile. One of these reptiles we find guarding the gardens of the Hesperides. The hydra of Lerma was another of these vermin, and joined to the possession of seven heads the addi- tional peculiarity of shooting out two new ones whenever you cut off one of them; the which, in sooth, embarrassed Hercules not a little. 'This,' cried the hero, 'is coming it rather strong. Do you suppose I am going to chop at you all day, for your amusement?' With which words, he seared the necks of the    <pb n="402-403" xml:id="VAC6560-00000210"/> OV:     DRlEAMS W rITHlN DREAMS. reptile whenever he sliced -off a head (albeit, where he got the hot iron from, I don't know), and so soon put an end to that way of going to work. Dragons, indeed, figure quite largely in history. Cadmus sowed their teeth in Attica, and repeopled the place by that original way of colonizing a country; the which, I think, accounts for the scaly way in which they always treated their great men. Possidonius verily speaks of a dragon who did swallow a knight whole, and never knew it until he felt the man's spurs scratching his throat like a fish- bone. At Mons, you hear of a dragon who was killed by one Giles de Chin. We all have heard of the monster of Rhodes. Then you have the dragons of Colchis, of the golden fleece; of Andromeda, and of Delphi, besides gryphons, and other chimaera. Indeed, the subject is verily fruitful."' By this time, the audience of my lord Clodolphus had melted away one by one, and now only Sir Wolfgang re- mained. As the learned man ended, and before he could again give mouth, the knight hurriedly remarked, that he had not the slightest doubt the subject was fruitful, and that he would pur- sue it more fully at another time; but that now he must really beg to be excused, as more important business awaited him. My-lord Clodolphus inquiring what, Sir Wolfgang informed him of his approaching visit to Villaburg. Whereat my lord Clodolphus volunteered to accompany him; which offer the knight declined, for reasons which he could not explain. CHAPTER XXXVII. WHAT SmR WOLFGANG DID AT VILLABURG. TRULY is there on this habitable earth no quainter spot than the old city of Villaburg. Never was- so curious a collection of grotesque houses jumbled together; houses all corners, with their gable ends projecting over the streets, and presented at every conceivable angle except a right angle; houses with win- dows of every size and shape, and no two windows on precisely the same level; houses with little Lilliputian turrets stuck on their corners three stories up, as if they had been glued to the   DitE3AMS - WITHN DREAMS.      403 outside; houses with all sorts of unexpected ways of getting in; with deep porches, doors almost hidden between projecting walls, doors round the corner where the stable ought to be- doors, in fine, anywhere-as if 'the architects never thought of them until the buildings were completed, and then knocked a hole in the wall anywhere for the purpose. In sooth, a strange old city was this same Villaburg.. If the houses were perplexing, the streets were more so. You never could tell, when you started, where you would fetch up; although, if you had to make a right guess, or die, your safest plan would be to say the place where you did not want to go; as that was the spot reached, nine times out of ten, by the adventurous stranger, after walking an hour or so. There was no use of a foreigner trying to go anywhere alone in Villaburg. Deucalion might as well have hoped to emerge from the labyrinth by the use of his legs. But, if you had no particular intention, perhaps Villaburg was as good a place for a stroll as you could wish to find. New and unex- pected sights were constantly appearing, like the actors in a pantomime; sometimes springing out of the ground, in the shape of a richly carved fountain, which had an eccentric way of occasionally getting out of order, and squirting water side- ways over you; sometimes out of the walls, in the likeness of a saint's image, or a porch with a fat burgher smoking -his pipe; sometimes out of the sky, in the shape of a basket dati- gling from a crane; and sometimes out of the windows, where little mirrors were fixed for the convenience of the inmates, who could comfortably view everything passing below, without the trouble of rising from their easy chairs. Indeed, to one who never was there before, and who was reckless of consequences, or had the prudence to hire a guide, the city of Villaburg was well worth visiting. There was the City Hall, for example; a building in which art had exhausted all her resources and mathematical ingenuity in the erection of corners. From belfry to cellar, the genius of zigzag was conspicuous. You went sideways up a flight of steps, and, when you were morally certain you had reached the top, you found another rising in the opposite direction. The hall went straight for about twenty yards, and then branched like the letter Y. The great chamber, with one part of the ceiling (of course) lower than the other, had a vast number of bow  windows, no two of a size. The furniture, too, was crooked, and looked as if crushed by irregular pressure: al, though there was a rude beauty about it, too.    <pb n="404-405" xml:id="VAC6560-00000211"/> SY       DREAKAMS WITIIN DRE AMS. Before the city hall was the market place, called the !" square," which did not have the most remote appearance of squareness, or, indeed, any other shape that has a name. A-round the market place was a covered promenade, consisting of a kind of extension of the houses, supported by columns. These extensions, being left to the taste of the owner of each house, displayed a variety quite in keeping with the whole city; some extensions being high, others low; some having long, thin, spindle columns, others short, fat, dropsical ones. lHere, on a market or fete day, crowds of men, women, and children would walk or lounge; while around the huge foun- tain in the middle, temporary tables displayed their wares, to tempt passers by. Opposite the city hall, and at the other extrelnity of the square, stood the cathedral; an immense gothic building, ever so old. It was brown with age, and its carvings were already almost worn away. But it was a strong old cathedral never- theless; a grand old cathedral, with its lofty spires, its rich en- trance, its solemn aisle, its stained-glass windows, its splendid altars, and its twilight stillness. To enter it, and leave the city behind, with its noise, bustle, and confusion, was to pass from life to immortality; to forget the petty cares and troubles and plans and hopes of this world, and to stand gazing wist- fully at the broad ocean of eternity, whither life is slowly flow- ing; to remember what we are, and why we were created; to ask ourselves how we have fulfilled the high destiny to which we have been called; to think upon the great army of the dead; to ponder on where they now are, and to recollect how soon we must depart thitherward; to look at the spotless can- dles glittering on the altar of Mary, with their gentle coronets of light, and to think on her chaste beauty, her long agony, and her eternal glory; and, blushing over our own unworthi- ness contrasted with her excellence, to turn bur eyes to that mild light shedding its soft rays over the high altar, and remem- ber in whose gracious presence we stand, and to whom we may turn, as the sick to a physician, the weary to Him who gives them rest, the child to his father. As Sir Wolfgang entered the cathedral, Brother Stanislaus was just commencing the holy sacrifice. He was an old, a very old man, and was assisted by two boys, whose youthful beauty, as they grouped round the venerable man, spoke elo- quently of how lovely is God's service, embracing all that is amiable in creation, and sanctifying all with attractions that never fade away. *                        1-h   DREAMS WrrHrN DREAMS.        405 "Kyrie Eleison I " Like the memory of the dead, sweet and solemn rose the mournful harmony of penance, and the whole church reechoed the wail, "Lord, have mercy upon us I " Ay, God be blessed! we who live are not forbidden prayer; and the sun of gloryv, shining through our tears, paints the rainbow of our hope in heaven. "And of all Thy saints; by whose merits and prayers grant that we, by the help of Thy protection, may be de- fended." Sir Wolfgang's eyes sought the priest, and he thought (God only knows why), as his gaze fell on the venerable old man, that his presence added a new sanctity to the sacred place. Wash your hands among the innocent, ye priests of the Lord; love the beauty of His house, and the place where His glory dwelleth. Lift up your hearts, for here, it is you daily invoke His presence by whom the angels praise the majesty of. the Eternal Father, the dominations adore it, the powers trem- ble before it, the heavens, the heavenly virtues, and the blessed seraphim with common jubilee glorify it. Lift up your hearts in humility, blessed priests of Christ, fpr it is meet and just. HOC EST ENIM CORPUS MEUM. Let there be silence now, and let all thought centre on the awful miracle of mercy- now acting before us. At this the cherub veils his face, the angel and archangel shrink, the choirs of heaven tremble, and sinful man alone partakes. Let there be silence on earth. There is more than silence in heaven. And now let the bells ring in the belfry, announcing to the world that the King of glory has descended on our altar. Who is this King of glory? The Lord of hosts, He is the King of glory. The old priest knelt long at the Agnus Dei, as if he would fain linger over those solemn words; for the best are always the most contrite, and they who have fewest faults to confess, confess them often with most compunction. The known sance tity of Brother Stanislaus, and the love all bore him, brought tears to Sir Wolfgang's eyes, as he heard him uttering the Miserere Nobis.  "If he has so much to mourn for," thought the knight, " how shall I answer for my misdeeds?" Oh, my God I oh, my crucified God! oh, life! oh, dream within a dream! when shall we wake from this troubled vision, where all that is, holy, all that is pure, all that is lovely, must    <pb n="406-407" xml:id="VAC6560-00000212"/> 406      DREAM8 WITHN DREAMS. pass through the dark valley of sorrow; where time is but the incessant repetition of agony and lamentations; where we love to lose, cherish to lose, honor to lose; where the death of hope and joy and life and love confronts us day after day? Oh! when shall we wake, .to dream no more? When the mass was over, Sir Wolfgang sent in his name at the convent gates. The porter bowed silently, and motioned to him to follow. The knight obeyed, and was conducted to a room, where, shortly after, the prior entered, and inquired whether his business was of such a nature as to require a per- sonal interview. "For," said he, "Brother Stanislaus is a very old man, my son, and we do not like to have him troubled by trifles." On Sir Wolfgang's respectfully but firmly assuring him that a personal interview was absolutely necessary, the prior said nothing more, but courteously ushered him into an- other room, where he found Brother Stanislaus. The old priest received Sir Wolfgang cheerfully, and inquired after his family. But here it may be as well to inform the reader who Brother Stanislaus was. Adolphus, Duke of Uphorn, and father of the present Duke, married late in life, and had one son, Louis, the present Uphorn, who was born exactly one year after the marriage, when his mother died in giving him birth. Adolphus took his wife's death very much to heart, and, giving up ambition, de- voted himself exclusively to the education of his only son. When Louis came of age, his father retired to the convent, resigning his title and possessions to his son, excepting his pri- vate property, which he distributed among the poor. He was sixty years old when he entered the convent, ard had been there for fhirty-five years. This was Brother Stanislaus. After the usual salutations, Sir Wolfgang related what the reader already knows. "You have done well, my dear child," said the old monk, as the knight concluded, ".and have shown a discretion very uncommon. Louis must be prepared for these tidings, and I thank my God that He has ended my only son's trials. The child is his daughter. Of this there can be no reasonable doubt; and it will not be difficult to prove it to Louis, even without the assistance of Margaret Halles. Un- less you have as much courage as discretion, my dear boy, let me earnestly advise you to leave matters as they are. A daughter cannot inherit the title or public possessions of Up- horn; and Louis's private fortune is his to do with as he likes. Hence there will be no more proof required than moral evi- i\   DREAMS WITHN DREAMS.        407 dence; and, as that is complete, nothing more need be done." "May I ask you one question?" inquired the knight. "Why not, my child?" "You made the remark, 'If you have not as much courage as you have discretion, leave matters alone.' What is this danger?" The old religious looked mildly at the knight. My son," said he, " there are some very terrible mysteries on this side of the grave, which the more we leave alone, the better for us. Undoubtedly are there secret powers wielded by malice for the destruction of souls. Men are ambitious and proud. Both these passions are gratified by the possession of power. Satan is very subtle. How far his influence extends, what are its lim- its, who can say? He is the father of lies; and, whether he works by preternatural means, or inspires certain minds to use certain natural forces for a cruel and malicious end, matters very little. The less we ask, the better. At best, it is lost time. A wicked imposture for a wicked end, is as bad as the most horrible tale of witchcraft, if it effects the same conse- quences. I say this to prepare you for what is to follow. This woman has a dreadful reputation. I dare not judge her, but it is best to be on your guard. Should you visit her, you may have to combat uncommon enemies. What do you say now? ' "I say," replied Sir Wolfgang, firmly, "that, since you deduce the proof of Gertrude's birth to be indirectly connected with Margaret Halles, but one course remains. I will meet this woman face to face, and will to will. But I have my doubts." "Of what?" "Of her warranting the reputation fame has given her." "And why, my child?" "Because your kinsman, Joseph Occa, has an interest in keeping inquiry from that direction; and 1 know him of old as a charlatan of the worst description. Who can say what occult power has been used here?" "But Louis has made his will, my child." "And that will-do you know where it is?" "In the hands of his friend." "Ay, father; but that friend has betrayed his trust. I would have informed his grace before, but it was only discoyv ered lately." "And how?"     '     <pb n="408-409" xml:id="VAC6560-00000213"/> "The will was in an iron box buried near a place called the Devil's Rock." "And why do you suspect Joseph?" "Because a man called Xacca was his agent. This Xacca has. been obliged to confess to the truth. It seems Joseph Occa employed him to bribe your son's friend to surrender the will, and, of course, the usual consequence followed. Xacca con- cealed the will, in order to have a hold upon his confederate, and to extort money from time to time; the rascal being cun- ning enough not to keep the document on his premises, for fear Joseph should discover and steal it. But let that pass. It but remains for me to ask Margaret's address, and to beg your blessing." "She lives," said Brotler Stanislaus, "in a house long abandoned by its owners, about five miles north of the city, close to the forest of Teruan. Go to the village of Kempen- groot, and ask any one where Margaret Halles lives, and he will tell you. And now, my dear child, may God bless you. I see His grace prompts this step. You are like your great- grandfather, who was my early friend. You start at the idea; but, my child, I am ninety-five years old." The old man smiled so gently, and looked so good, so mild, and so loving, that the knight threw himself on his knees, and flung his arms round the monk's neck. The other stroked his hair, as if Sir Wolfgang were indeed a child. The knight rose, blushing likd a young girl, made some awkward excuse, bowed, and strode rapidly out of the room. "If," he muttered to himself, "I have acted foolishly, is not love folly?" And lie sang the verse: "The stars 'may speak, and the streams may cry, And reason may plead from her throne on high; On the wings of love to heaven we fly, Though love is folly." But the knight knew the value of moments.  Taking a short repast, he mounted Cincinnatus, and, accompanied by Romulus, set forth for the village of Kempengroot. About two miles from the city his horse lost a shoe, and this detained him, for a blacksmith had first to be found; and, when the knight reached the shop, Mrs. Blacksmith had to go for her husband. So it came to pass that Sir Wolfgang did not reach Kempengroot until nearly dark, although he started at four o'clock, and had only five miles to go. Hle rode up to the inn, and made his inquiries; at which    tU the innkeeper looked at him with as much amazement as if he had asked where the devil lodged. Two or three idlers, hear- ing the knight's inquiry, crowded round, open mouthed, which vexed Sir Wolfgang not a little. "Why, good people," said he, rather impatiently, " what are you staring at? Is it yery wonderful I should want to see anybody?" The innkeeper shook his head. "You do not know, sir, what you are saying," he replied. "Heaven forbid that a noble gentleman like yourself should go there by night. I am glad to say she will not be at home until to-morrow. You had better see her by daylight, I assure you." "You are the very man I want to talk with," said Sir Wolfgang, leaping from Cincinnatus. "Here! tell your ostler to come for my horse. Let him rub him down, and not give him anything to eat until I attend to it myself. I stay here to- night." The innkeeper disinterestedly approved of the last resoiu- tion, and led Cincinnatus away himself. Sir Wolfgang, fol- lowed by Romulus, entered the public room. In a few min- utes the host returned. "Now, friend," said the knight, " first let us order supper. What do you like best yourself?" "Hare with champagne sauce, partridges and mushrooms, vegetables to match, a roly-poly, and a flask of Stein," promptly answered the innkeeper, running hastily over the most expen- sive items his house could furnish. "Good," replied Sir Wolfgang, nodding approval. "Have them all up in a private room-covers for two; that is, for you and me. Come and sup with me. Add a couple of bottles of champagne, and there we are." The host rubbed his hands, nodded, and bustled off to make the proper arrangements. In a couple of hours all was ready. The knight said grace, and fell to with a good will, for he was as hungry as he was discreet. But the innkeeper beat him at a knife and fork, for all that; eating as a man does who feasts at another's expense. During the repast, Sir Wolfgang pumped his host thoroughly. The landlord's information was chiefly hearsay, but he prom- ised, after supper, to send him in a man who knew more. "He is a little cracked," he remarked, " but you won't mind that, I dare say. He was once a cabinetmaker, and the bravest man in the village; but he heard of the ghosts seen up in the hol- low near where the witch lives, and annoyed our carpenter so 18    <pb n="410-411" xml:id="VAC6560-00000214"/> "O       DREAMS WITHN DREAMS. by ridiculing a story he told about her, that the carpenter dared him to go there by night." "And did he go?" asked Sir Wolfgang. "Oh! he went," replied the other. "Valentine (that's his name) was not the man to be dared." "And what came of it?"  "God knows. When he came back, we hardly knew him. He was a hardy, jolly fellow the day before. The next, he was just what you will see him. He could work no more, and now lives on charity. If I might be so bold, sir, you would do a good work if you gave him a trifle before he went away." "My good fellow," replied Sir Wolfgang, "how could I be angry at such a suggestion? Let him come, by all means. But is he capable of telling a story straight?" "Sometimes he is," answered the landlord, "and sometimes he isn't. Michael," he continued, addressing the servant who was removing the dishes, "step over the way, and tell Valen- tine I want to see him." The servant went away.  "Yes," pursued the landlord, "he can tell a story straight enough, if he pleases, and I think he would do so to you; for you have a kind way about you, which is uncommon, I am sure." Sir Wolfgang smiled. "I am sure," he observed, "I have had compliments enough, lately, to make me quite vain." "Beg your pardon," asked the innkeeper; "but are you married?" A shadow passed over the knight's face. "I was," said he; "but my wife lived only one day after our marriage. The innkeeper smoked silently, and so passed five minutes, when a timid knock was heard at the door, and Valentine entered. He was emaciated to the last possible degree consistent with life. His hair was white, but evidently not with age, for his form was erect. His eyes were restless, and he had a nervous way of opening and shutting his hands. He paused timidly at the door, until the innkeeper bade him enter and take a chair; when he shuffled to a seat, and looked round with a vacancy of expression very painful to behold. "Are you hungry, Val?" asked the host. (No, sir." "Thirsty?  "No. sir" Cold?"   DREAMS WrrHN DREAMS.        4" ' Ye-yes, sir; I am always cold. H shiver always." "Pull up your chair to the fire, then." "Thank you, sir. I am comfortable where I am, sir, if you please." "Well, do as you like. Here is a gentleman, Val, who wants to see you, and have a talk with you, and give you a little trifle, I dare say." Valentine bowed humbly. "And, Val, he wants to know all about Margaret Halles- the old witch, you know. He comes to give her her dues." This was said at a venture, but it produced an extraordi- nary effect on the man. His face flushed, his eyes sparkled, and his whole frame quivered, as he turned to the knight: "Have you come at last?" he cried. "God knows how wearily I have been waiting for you. Heaven be praised! the hour of retribution is at hand." "Yes," replied Sir Wolfgang, willing to humor the fancy of the poor, half-crazed fellow. "When God's time comes, friend, the deeds of darkness are brought to light, and punish- ment falls on the guilty head." "Ay, ay!" cried Valentine. "So my dreams say. The fiends crowd round me at night, and jeer me; but they always fly shrieking away before a white form, who comes slowly, slowly down from heaven. Her face is always veiled, and she is always draped in white. And she comes slowly, slowly down from the blue sky. And then they curse, and vanish.'" "Well," said the host, "don't bother over your dreams. We understand all that, you know. Tell us about your ad- venture." "Pray, let him speak," said the knight, compassionately. "Oh, bother his rtuff!" cried the landlord. "If you let him go on that way, he will keep it up half the night. Trust me to steer him straight. I say, Val." "Yes, sir." "Are you listening?" "Yes, sir." "Will you tell us about the witch?  "Surely I will, sir." "Well, then, fire away, you precious old skeleton." "Yes, sir." "Remember, we don't want to hear anything about your dreams. Go straight on, and stick to the subject. If you pass a nightmare on the way, let it slide. Are you listening?     <pb n="412-413" xml:id="VAC6560-00000215"/> "2      DREAMS WITHN DREAMS. "Yes, sir." "He is in right trim now," whispered the host to Sir Wolf. gang.  When you see his eyes fixed that way, be sure he is going on the right tack." "Hush!" said the knight. "He is about to speak." And the man, looking straight before him, related the fol- lowing extraordinary adventure. p . CHAPTER XXXVIII. NARRATING VALENTINE'S STORY, AND WHAT SIR WOLFGANG DID. "SHE conquered me by power such as Heaven only can overcome. She has blasted my life, but she cannot damn my soul. "First let me tell you who she is, and why she is what she is. "She was the daughter of a husbandman, and I loved her; but she would have nothing to say to me; and one night she fled with another, cursed by her father, pitied by the good, and despised by the bad. "And I met her, when, at length, deserted by the world, abhorred, cursed, abandoned, she sat like Eve at the gates of Paradise, and said, 'A serpent hath done all this.' "And I met her when pride struck its fangs into her heart, when wrath flashed in her eyes; and she cursed me-me, who only would have consoled her. "And I met her once again, after long years had passed away. But how? She had formed an alliance with a man I know not; a terrible man, to whom she had sold herself for revenge-revenge against the world, but chiefly against him who had betrayed her. "' The night I went up to her house, the whole heaven was overcast, the rain poured down in torrents, the thunder rolled, and the lightning flashed. But I pursued my way neverthe- less." "Oh, Moses I " cried the innkeeper. "I say, Val." "Yes, sir." "We really can't stand this much longer, you know."   DREAiMS WITHN DREAMS.       413 "Ye, sir." "Just curb your imagination a little, please, and keep to the point. You got to Margaret Halles's house, didn't you?" "Yes-yes." "Very good.  Did anything pass before you went to bed?" "No-no." "And afterward?" "Ay I " cried the poor fellow, looking wildly around. Do you mean to tell it, or do you not? "I will-I will." "Then spit it out straight, and don't slobber." "She conducted me to my sleeping apartment,' continued Valentine, a little more rationally, " and left me alone; when I examined it carefully, and, being a cabinetmaker, detected a secret door in one of the panels. I touched the spring, opened the door, and saw steps leading downward. I looked round. The entrance to my room was secured by a bolt. I listened. The quiet of death reigned. I took my light, atd softly de- scended the concealed staircase. "Hardly had I descended a dozen steps, when I heard a groan, and the rattle of chains. I paused. Another groan startled me, and I felt fear for the first time. "'What is this strange woman?' I asked myself 'and what place is this?' "I took courage, at last, and continued. The steps led to a passage constructed in the thickness of the wall, terminating in two other doors. I opened one of them, first placing my light in an angle of the wall As I opened it, I felt the fresh air blowing in my face. I stepped carefully out, and examined this secret means of exit. "The house was built of stone, profusely ornamented with carvings, and the door was constructed of oak, covered with thin plates of stone corresponding in appearance to the rest of the building; so that, from the outside, you would have thought it a portion of the wall itself. '  Opposite this door, and on the other side of the concealed passage, was another door, communicating with the cellars, and equally well hidden; so that there were three ways of entering or leaving the house unobserved. I am particular in describing all this, for you must have it all vividly before you, if you would understand what followed.  "As I softly closed the outer door, and- stood before the    <pb n="414-415" xml:id="VAC6560-00000216"/> "4       'Ir:'.:AS WITHN DRTLEAMS. entrance to the cellars, I heard suppressed voices. 'I did not stir, but listened eagerly. One of the voices was Margaret's, but I could not exactly make out what the other replied. As I was trying to catch what they said, a light suddenly threw its rays into the passage where I was standing. My own lamp being left, as I said before, in an angle, I had been listening in the dark. This new light showed a loophole in the wall, so contrived that any one in the passage might observe all that was going on in the cellar; and, to prevent the hole betraying the existence of the secret place, it had been cut very high up, being reached from the inside by stones projecting from the wall. It was now plain to me, that, if I had not accidentally placed my lamp on the spot where it stood, its rays would have betrayed me to those in the cellar. As it was, I was safe so far. "I climbed up, and looked in. The subterranean room on the other side was much lower than the passage. Indeed, the hole of espial was close to its roof. I looked down into a kind of pit. As the floor of the passage, was some ten feet below me, and on a level with the ground, I calculated that the bot- tom of the pit must be twenty feet below the surface. It looked like a deep grave. There was a flight -of steps on the other side, leading from the top to the bottom; but, had I opened the passage door, and tried to advance from my side, I would have fallen to the bottom of the cavity. All this I saw at a glance, for my attention was fixed on what was going on at the bottom of the pit. "Margaret was standing, with a light in her hand, before a kind of cage, such as wild beasts are kept in. Opening the door, she set down her light, and took a seat near by, where there was a plate of broken meat, and an old mug of water. She next summoned the inhabitant of the cage in an imperious tone, when there crawled out a miserable-lobking wretch on his hands and knees; for the door of the cage was so low, he had to creep out in that lowly posture. "Virhen he had reached her feet, she set the broken meat and the mug of water on the ground, just at the length of his chain, and sat looking at him eat with a malignant triumph ex- pressed in every feature. The captive ate ravenously, as he grovelled before her. When he had finished, she drove him again into the cage, fastened it, and went up the steps. a I was sick at heart. I recognized her victim, though I had never seen him before. It must have been the one who   DRkAMS WITHN DrEAMS.        415 betrayed her. I knew, now, that she was alone in the house. 'Heaven,' I thought to myself, ' has sent me here for that poor wretch's liberation.' Ah, when I thought that I, a healthy, able-bodied man, was able to cope with this woman, I little knew Margaret Halles. "When she was gone, I waited a little while, and then, taking my lamp in my hand, cautiously ascended the steps. 'She is but a woman,' said I to myself; 'but doors are doors, and she might close them on me.' So I hastily returned to my room, determined to secure her before I took further steps. "I proceeded to her room. She was not there. I then resolved to search the whole house. You know it is one of our largest houses, and she guards it in the owner's absence. I determined ,to search room after room. My God I why did I not leave the cursed place at once? There was a long, dark hall; with the great staircase at one end. I began with the first room. The bed was drawn into the middle of the apartment, and on it lay a corpse. I started back, and hastily closed the door. My light only ren- dered the dark hall darker, and I felt a thrill of horror shoot through me. "I went to the room opposite, and so to all the apartments which opened on the hall. In every one the bed was drawn out, and on it lay a human corpse. When I reached the last, I almost fell to the ground. And now comes the most awful part. When I turned toward the stairs, every door opened slowly-- slowly-and I saw each corpse standing ghas!ly in its shroud, each before its door. I seemed rooted to the spot-then forced to move on slowly throughbthis hideous avenue of death. And, as I passed each corpse, I heard it following me-tramp, tramp, tramp-until I was at the head of the ghostly procession. "I reached the stairs, and the spell was broken. I flew down. I reached the hall door.  I fled through the park. I never stopped until I reached the village. Nobody knew me, at first. All think me crazed. None believe my story, yet they are all afraid of venturing up there. And the poor pris- onter, if he bes not dead, inhabits his cage still, and I can do nothing." Sir Wolfgang listened to this extraordinary story with com- passionate attention. - Signing to the landlord to remain, he re- warded Valentine, and dismissed him.  When he was gone, the knight turned to his companion. "It is evident," said he, "that this poor fellow has been deluded-how, I care not to    <pb n="416-417" xml:id="VAC6560-00000217"/> ask. Now, although it would not be wise to put faith in what he has just told us, yet, as it is barely possible that a man is confined up there, it is our duty to investigate the matter thor- oughly. But we must have no more such adventures. I pro- pose, therefore, boldly to go up there to-morrow, in broad day- light. The poor man certainly made use of one correct expres- sion, and that is, 'Doors are doors.' So it would be best to prevent our being locked up without help near. Now, do you know half a dozen brave fellows, who would volunteer to aid me?" "It were a shame to Kempengroot to say nay," replied the innkeeper. "I will be the first volunteer." "That is stout," said Sir Wolfgang. "Find them at once. The men must understand, however, that they are under my command, and must obey me implicitly." "I take," returned the host, nodding his head. "Make your mind easy. Just go to bed, and leave matters to me. I shall quietly bring them together. Nobody but the men shall know anything about it." "Willingly," said the knight. "See I am awakened at seven, and have everything in readiness." The other nodded, drank a last cup, and retired. Sir Wolf- gang sat a little longer by the fire, thinking, and then went to bed. In the morning, he was awakened at the hour named, took his breakfast, and went down stairs. The landlord was stand- ing at the door, looking as unconscious as if he had never seen the knight in his life before. A little vexed at not perceiving anything done, Sir V olfgang called for Cincinnatus. The land- lord sent for it with the same indifference of manner. As Sir Wolfgang mounted his horse, he observed another near;. but he was too old a soldier to say anything, especially as he heard the innkeeper say to the ostler, "James, I aln going a little way with this gentleman. Be particular while I am gone." He waited, therefore, for the host, who, mounting his fat nag, said to him, "Come, sir; I have much to do. This way." They proceeded up the street, the host nodding to several of his acquaintances, and stopping several* times to exchange a few indifferent words with them. As they turned out of the road up a lane, two horsemen joined them quietly, and a little further on three more. They now numbered, in all, seven men. If ever Margaret Halles was to have her due, surely this was the hour.   lUtEjAMS W iiHlM DJ"ALNLEAMS. L1 ( The house she inhabited was a very old building, surround- ed by a desolate park full of old trees rising out of a tangled mass of undergrowth. Whatever was once beautiful, had now van- ished. The statues were broken, and covered with a slimy green mould. The deer had long died. The walks were cov- ered with'weeds. The flowers had been choked by thorns. The marble steps were cracked, and the terraces to which they led were overgrown with grass. There was a blight over the whole place. One chimney had fallen, and another, leaning over, threatened to come down with the next high wind. All the shutters of the house were closed. The door was covered with moss and dust and cobwebs and rust, as if it had not been opened for years. A quantity of ashes and rubbish had been carelessly thrown on what had once been the steps lead- ing to the great entrance, and which now was only a loose pile of huge stones, between two of which a snake glided as the horsemen rode up. Seeing a side door, the knight, followed by his companions, reined in before it. Sir Wolfgang, accompanied by the inn- keeper and two others, dismounted, and went in; while the other three remained mounted near the other animals, ready for any emergency. Sir Wolfgang and suite entered the house, where they found Margaret stooping over the fire. "We are here," said the knight, sternly, "to arrest you on a serious charge. You had best come quietly with us." The witch looked very scared, and replied: "Lord's sakes alive, gentlemen! what do you mean?" "I thought as much," muttered the knight; who then said aloud to the innkeeper: "The house must be searched; but first, I shall examine the woman." "Me?" said Margaret. "You," replied Sir Wolfgang. "Sit down on that chair." The woman sat down. "Now," continued the other, seating himself opposite her, listen to me. Your name is Margaret Halles, I believe?" "Bless the soldier man! what is he after?" cried the woman. ' Is it, or is it not?" pursued Sir Wolfgang. "I never heered the contrayry," answered Margaret Halles. You don't take me for a queen in disguise, I suppose?" "I want no questions," replied the other. "It is for me to 18*    <pb n="418-419" xml:id="VAC6560-00000218"/> ask, and for you to answer. Do you know a man called Val- entine?" "I do." "Did he ever come here, and pass a night in this house?" "Yes; and got into the secret passage, and nearly tumbled into the icehouse, and saw me feeding Baby-" "Baby!" "Baby-the wolf dog." "Oh!" "And then went up stairs, spooking round the bedrooms, where he was almost frightened to death by the old statues." "Statues " "Yes; the ones we had put on the beds, for fear they'd spoil. But, gentlemen, please don't harm me. Everybody hates me because I am poor and lone and old and ugly. All my goods a'n't worth taking; but I love what I own, for the sake of the past. They belonged, once, to my dear mistress. Ah, I remember well when she gave me those clothes. 'Why are you so sad, nurse?' said she. 'Oh, my child!' I an- swered; 'when I think how, one day, you must lie cold and still in other vestments, the tears come to my eyes.'" So saying, the poor old woman began to cry. ' Are you sure, Sir Wolfgang," suggested the innkeeper, "that the woman is not deceiving you?" "Sir Wolfgang!" screamed Margaret.  "Who was it said 'Sir Wolfgang?' Are you-are you-Holy God!" In a moment, she seized the knight by the shoulders, and scanned his face earnestly. "You do not know me," she sobbed at last. "You, like all, have forgotten me; and yet I remember how proudly you led my darling to the altar, and how-" "Ellen!" cried the knight. "And is it you?" And he fell on her neck, and wept. Very much moved, the men gathered round. There was silence for a few moments, during which the knight strove to subdue the violent emotions which this sudden opening of old wounds had occasioned. Then he proceeded to clear up the whole mystery, showing how Valentine had been the victim of his own idle terrors. Ellen, or Margaret Halles, corroborated the story of little Gertrude; and said, moreover, that, supposing the child to be illegitimate, she had preserved a cautious silence. But the most extraordinary part of her story was the fact that Up-   horn's wife was no less a person than the sister of Isabel de Jelleaux, Sir Wolfgang's young bride, who had died the day after their marriage. It requires little imagination to think what followed. They all quietly went back: Sir Wolfgang and Margaret proceeding to Villaburg, and the rest returning home, with the following caution from the knight: "By Jove I " said he, as they parted company; "let us keep this adventure quiet, or the crusade of the seven against an old woman will become a jocose theme for the Kempengroot wags at our expense." CHAPTER XXXIX. RETUIRNING TO CASTLE BERTRAND. "I HAVE got some fun for to-night," said the Count to Godfroy, on the evening Sir Wolfgang left the castle. "I have a match for old Folio." "And who, pray, is old Folio?" asked Godfroy. "Oh! that Clodolphus," answered the Count.  "You have heard that Prytanis is here. Now he's. the devil of a chap for the classics-beats old Folio all to pieces. Clodolphus gave him a hammering one day, and Prytanis is thirsting for revenge. He has been reading up, and means to go it. And won't we have Julius Caesar, and the rest of it?" "But I thought you hated such talk?" suggested God- froy. "As a rule-as a rule," replied the Count. "I a'n't much in the classic line myself; but I want to see old Folio cave in for once, and I think Prytanis is the man to do it." So, when evening was come, the Count, having winked at Godfroy, addressed Prytanis, and asked him if it was true that he had lately been in Greece? To which Prytanis replied tlat he had. "Ah," quoth my lord Clodolphus, pricking up his learned ears, "you never told me that. Greece, indeed! And have you verily beheld the land of Phocian, and of Themiistocles, and of Diogenes, and of Thrasybulus?

Prytanis looked at him contemptuously, and said: "Spoon meat for babes I Much you know of Greece, except from books! Classics, like everything else, are going rapidly to the devil.

"The world," continued Prytanis, pompously, for he had been reading up, and had no fear as long as he could keep to the subject matter, ' the world is degenerating, miserable bipeds that we are I See how the arts progressed once, and how they are now retrograding-a sure sign of our coming destruction.

I wish I had Diana " "So you like the girls, do you?" observed the Count, actually hugging himself in his delight to see my lord Clodol- phus at a loss what to say. In truth, my lord Clodolphus, un- aware that Prytanis had been preparing himself for an encoun- ter, and unaccustomed to be met with quite such a heavy broad- side, had not yet recovered from his surprise. "So you like the girls, do you?" said the Count. "I am nothing but a degenerate being," replied Prytanis, with a melancholy wink. "I am what you may call a weed, and unfit to grace the garden of the Hesperides. I love a fine woman, though. I admire talips of every description, and I consir a handsome woman to be a tulip." "SE they are," assented the Count, reciprocating the wink. 'Julius Caesar has taught you more sensible things than he ever imparted to our friend Clodolphus." "And what a man was Tasso " continued Prytanis. "Oh, what a genius was he I Just think of Armida, with that booby of a Rinaldo at her feet; ' he proud of his bond- age, she of her empire.' Oh, what poor creatures we all are I Only think of her open veil; of the smile in her eyes, 'spar- kling like a ray of sunshine in a blue fountain;' of her hanging over him, and he-the wretch!-with his head pillowed on her knees. And then, when he leaves her, what a villain he is I Nay! wouldn't I, sinner that I am, have staid? Oh, no!" "I would," observed the Count. "And so would I," remarked Godfroy. "And I too," quoth my lord Clodolphus. t"I should think so," assented Prytanis. "We degenerate every day. If any of us three were in Armida's lap, the war-  rior Dane and his friend Ubaldo would go back with a couple of fleas-one in each of their respectable ears. The heroic    <pb n="422-423" xml:id="VAC6560-00000220"/> age has departed. It has fled like Astrea. It has been caught up like Ganymede. It has been carried off like Hylas. We call for it vainly, as did the Argonautic crowd in Bithynia. ' Hylan nautas quo fonte relictum clamassent'-At which spring the sailors call lustily for the lost Hylas. 'Ut littus, Hyla  Hyla! omne sonaret '-So that the whole shore resounded, Hylas! Hylas!- Virgil." Now it was all very well to display learning, and it was even possible to silence my lord Clodolphus for a little while; but he was not the man to have games like these played, with- out having (as the vulgar saying is) a finger in the pie. So he now girded up his loins for a literary race, and drove into the arena of conversation, ready, according to the advice of Nes. tor, to be rather wise than swift; to turn the flying wheel round the goal, so as neither to break the car nor lame the horse; and, in fine, to cut in, as a classic hero ought to do. And then was there not a time! If a short-hand writer had been by, he might have collected sufficient material for a classic encyclopaedia. Neither gentleman was very particular in his choice, so long as he could show all he knew; although there was a very marked difference between them, nevertheless. My lord Clodolphus went at it like a man determined to do or die, and brought so many new authors to bear, in so miraculously originala way, on so many subjects, that even the Count was struck with admiration. "Bless the man!" he thought; "what a fund of knowledge he has! He beats the devil, I do declare. He is like a snake with its tail in its mouth. There is absolutely no end of him. How much those old ancients must have known!" On the other hand, Prytanis fought well, though he had evidently the worst of it. While expatiating upon the degen- eracy of the days, and extolling those of the past, down came my lord Clodolphus on him, thundering away like Jupiter. In vain he took refuge in stating, once more, that he was a worm. "If you are a worm," quoth my lord Clodolphus, pitilessly taking every advantage, and meeting him at every turn, "go and live with the caterpillars. By and by, perhaps, you will wind yourself up in a chrysalis form, and come out a butterfly. Until then, don't you go trying to fly. And when you cease to ce a grub, and come out with wings, don't you go too near the fire. Verily, my good friend, your classic reputation is in jeopardy.

If you are a miserable wretch as you say you are-and I do not deny it-go and count your Armidas, your Dianas, your Junos, and your Venuses, and leave learning to those unblessed by chuckle heads. What saith the poet? A man, sorrily dressed, stood before Henry IV of France. Like you, he was a sui generis kind of a body. ' Whom do you serve?' asked the king. 'I belong to my- self,' replied the churl. Whereat his majesty, as the poet hath it, replied: 'How I pity, my friend, your unhappy disaster, You e' er could have had a worse fool for a master.'" CHAPTER XL. NARRATING HOW THE COUNT AND PRYTANIS HAD A LITTLE CON- VERSATION; HOW HOLLAR AND LETITIA HAD A LITTLE DITTO, AND WHAT CAME OF IT. WE have said, in a former part of this wonderful book, that the Count was wont to rise early, and prowl round his premises with a huge stick in his hand, digging. up roots care- fully planted by the gardener, and making himself useful in a variety of ways, when morn, advancing her rosy steps, sowed the earth with orient pearl. On the day after the occurrences narrated in the latter part of the preceding chapter, as the saffron Aurora, beaming and refulgent, rose from the bed of Tithonus, and dressed herself in blushes-which are all the clothes we ever hear of that lady wearing-the Count took his stick, and commenced his daily prowl. First, he saw his hens safe into the barnyard. Then he visited the stables, and blew Peter up. "For," argued the Count, "it is always well to keep your hand in; and, even if everything is going on right, preventive is better than cure." So he always blew Peter up when he visited the stables. Next, he walked into the garden, which we have so often confounded with the park, that we really think it high time to explain the thing to the dear reader. The garden was really a part of the park, not being divided from it by any fence. There was, however, a ditch round it,    <pb n="424-425" xml:id="VAC6560-00000221"/> 424      DREAMS WITHN DREAMS.         ! the bottom of which ditch containing just enough moisture to please a hog or an eel. No earthly argument, however lucid, could convince the Count that a ditch three feet broad by four deep was of no possible practical use. The ground was his, he replied, and he meant to have as many ditches as pleased him. Consequently, for five years no stranger had come to the castle, by night, without tumbling in ; for it was a regular pit- fall, as it skirted the road quite a little way; and, as the road wound, it sometimes stood directly between the nocturnal wan- derer and the lights of the castle. But to our story. While the Count was busily engaged, this morning, in pruning a plum tree, and assisting nature by the novel method of olhopping at its roots with a blunt axe, Prytanis came loung- ing along, and bade him " good morning." The Count, who was perspiring with his exertions, replied without looking round, and continued chopping away at the roots. "There was an awful noise near my door last night," said Prytanis. "Was there?" asked the Count, with an impatient ejacu- lation, as he tugged at the axe, which stuck at that moment. "Was there? Hang the thing I I wish it would not stick so. What kind of a noise was it?" "Like that heard in the capitol on the memorable night when Manlius saved Rome," replied the other. "Very good," said the Count, tugging again at the axe. "And now put that into sense, and let me know when it is done." "It was a sound like the distant murmur of geese," an- swered Prytanis. "h011 " returned the Count, resting on the handle of the axe; ' you probably heard my geese. Oh I yes, yes. Well, and how did you like it?" "Like it I " ejaculated Prytanis. "You mean, how did I dislike it? It must have annoyed you quite as much as it did me. But I have a way of curing that sort of a thing. I will tell you what I am going to do. I am going to clip one wing of every one of your fowls; and, if that won't keep them out of the house, why, we must get a pile of stones ready to chuck at them." "Oh, indeed I " said the Count. "Now mark me. If any man chucks stones at my hens, I'll chuck his head into the cis- tern. And if any man cuts the wings off my fowls, I'll cut his nose off-a nose for every wing. That's what I'll do. By   DREAMS WITHN DREAMS.        425 George  you talk of my poultry as if they were your own." ' Why, Count," replied the other, " in these days of awful degeneration, is it possible that sinful men can have sunk to the worship of chickens, as in the case of the pagan Egyptians and the benighted Blackamoors?" "Benighted tomcats!" cried the Count, irritably. "If you have a liking for your miserable carcass, you Wkave other people's hens alone. Days of degeneration I Days of fiddle- sticksl Go and Julius Caesar your own fowls. I have no doubt they are all as lean as Job's turkey." '1 We are all dust and ashes!" said Prytanis, meekly. "Sinful creature that I am I I believe you will be wroth with me." "What have yout been doing?" asked the Count. "Miserable wretch that I am!" replied Prytanis, gloomily, "I fear I hove a brickbat at the gobbler. I fear I was wicked enough to shy divers oyster shells at the Muscovies. And I am afraid I was bad enough to heave an old boot at sundry of the feathered tribe, congregated together, doubtless, for the purpose of gathering sustenance out of a pail." "A very nice story before breakfast!" growled the Count, shouldering his axe like a pioneer. i"Don't do it again." "Are the cats likewise under your wing?" asked Prytanis. "There were divers of those feline quadrupeds on the roof, last night. Miserable sinner that I am! I was base enough to wish them in Jericho." "Chuck your stones at them as much as you like," said the Count. "Hang the cats!   They eat my young hens. Oh, what fiendish animals cats are! They have the mischief of a baboon, and the power of nuisance of a philosopher." Truly," replied Prytanis, changing the subject of conver- sation, " truly 1 should like to know why you have been chop. ping at that tree?  If' you want to cut it down, why don't you let your man do it?" "That is to make it bear more plentifully," remarked the Count, learnedly. Prytanis looked with'a puzzled expression at the jagged cats and bruises with which the Count had lacerated the roots. "We are degenerating fast,"' he observed. '"Do  you know, Count, that, in my ignorance, I should have supposed that way of going to work was the surest way of killing the tree?" ( Very likely," replied the Count, graciously. "You city    <pb n="426-427" xml:id="VAC6560-00000222"/> t50      DREUAMS WUrrUN DREJAMS. aen do not understand horticulture as we do who have de. oted a life to the study." "Oh! by the by," cried Prytanis, " there is a man waiting or you at the house." ' The deuce there is!" said the Count. "Yes," continued Prytanis. "He says his message is of he highest importance. So you had better run along, and not vait."' "And is it possible," replied the Count, "that you have ,een keeping me here, talking of hens, and cats, and chucking tones, and old boots, while you knew all the while the man vas impatiently waiting for me? Oh, what a fine aide-de-camp rou are for a person in a hurry!" With these words, the Count stalked off indignantly, bear- ng his axe on his shoulder, and leaving Prytanis to follow or lot, as he pleased. But Prytanis did not please to follow; for he had chanced o see the fair Letitia, whom he now joined. "Have you been shooting?" she inquired. "No," he answered, with a hideous leer intended to be captivating. ' Carbines are the invention of these retrograding lays. It is true, the process of using them is quite simple; ;ince you have only to point the muzzle in the right direction, and you are sure to hit the mark. But I have hitherto found in incomprehensible difficulty in bringing the muzzle to the ?roper direction. Sinner that I am! I have not as yet learned low to shoot a carbine." At this moment Hollar came up, and saluted them. Now Prytanis, as we have before hinted, was a very timid man, and lad, morover, on divers occasions been justly accused of run- ling away, when, according to vulgar prejudice, he should have Ataid and fought it out. Consequently, when Hollar ad- vanced, he fell in the rear, and followed the two like a great log. As they were thus promenading, the Count returned. "What the devil did you send me on a fool's errand for?" he began, as he came up. "There was no messenger at all." Prytanis looked meek, not to say sneaking, at the Count. "i Hey?" said he. "I said," repeated the Count, " what on earth did you send me on a fool's errand for? There was no messenger at all." "' Surely, surely," replied Prytanis, "I might have told you so myself." "The devil you might " cried the exasperated Count.   DREAMS WITHN DREAMS,       427 "Don't I know that? So we come back to the question-why did you do it? What is the man at now?" he continued, as Prytanis beckoned at him in a ghostly manner. "Perhaps," suggested Hollar, "he wants to speak to you privately." The Count assented grumbling, and followed Prytanis to a corner, who said, in a hollow whisper: "Count, can you keep a secret?" "Yes," answered the Count; " but please don't tickle my ear. You blow right into it, as you talk." "Count," continued Prytanis, " do you see that woman?" "Do you mean Letitia?" asked the Count. "The same," said Prytanis, solemnly. "Well, then, why don't you say Letitia at once," cried the  Count, testily, " and not be standing there putting on the airs of a spectre?" "I saw her in the garden," pursued Prytanis, gloomily. "I wished to have her to myself, but was frustrated by fate. That is why I sent you on what you are pleased to style a fool's errand. Miserable sinner that. I am! I sent you on a fool's errand." "Well," gasped the excited Count, "of all cool things and brazen confessions, this has the most cool and brazen aspect of any I ever heard tell of." "Everything is fair in love," said Prytanis. "Everything is fair in Barryhack!" hotly replied the Count. "Don't you send me after any more mares' nests, or there will be the foul fiend to pay. Besides, Letty is engaged to Hollar. A'n't you, Letty?" bawled the Count to that lady, who, with her companion, was now at the other end of the walk. "Am I not what?" she replied.- ' Betrothed to Hollar!" bawled the Count. Letitia blushed. "Yes," cried Hollar. "Are you not ashamed?" remonstrated Letty. Where- upon ensued an important conversation, the result of which will appear hereafter. The Count looked at them, musing. "They are no more betrothed, as yet," he said to Prytanis, "than I am to Old Scratch. Ten to one they will be soon. By Jove! I'll take twenty to one he is popping the question now. A'n't you, Hollar?" "-A'n't I what?" bawled Hollar.    <pb n="428-429" xml:id="VAC6560-00000223"/> 428      DREAMS WITHN DREAMS. "Popping the Q," cried the Count, putting his hands to his mouth as a temporary speaking trumpet. Letty ran away, and Hollar joined the gentlemen, with a red face. Whereat the Count laughed boisterously, and Prytanis looked on sourly, and rather silly. "Your game is up, Prytanis, my boy," continued the Count, as well as he could for laughing. "Truly have I found a mare's nest instead of you," replied Prytanis. "Well, Hollar," said the Count, " did she say 'yes?' Did she, eh? Did she send you to pa? Did she? Oh, you cun- ning dog I " Hollar winked. "Ha! ha I ha!" laughed the Count. "You look as red as a brick. Never mind. Burning ardor bakes us -all." And, with this beautiful metaphor, the Count burst into an- other ha I ha I ha I "What mare's nest have you found?" asked Hollar. "Sinner that I am I " said Prytanis, taking upon himself to reply; 1"I did send our worthy friend in search of a cock and of a bull." "Hang you I Yes," cried the Count, wroth in an instant, "sinner that you are I If you do it again, I know another sinner not a thousand miles off, who will wring your blessed neck." "Breakfast is ready, sir," said Gabriel, coming up. "Bravo!" cried the Count. "Sinners that we are, let us partake of the good things of life I Oh, you old wretch! To go and send a man of my age after a jack-o'-lantern I And to throw boots at my hens I Come on, you miserable sinner." At breakfast there was quite a busy conversation about how they should pass the day. Many were the suggestions, and many the objections to the suggestions. Terrible was the struggle between the Count and my lord Clodolphus on the eternal subject of Saint Augustine; but this was looked upon as a matter of course. At length they resolved to pay the old ruin a visit, and the idea was unanimously applauded. So, amid laughter and bustle and a confusion of tongues, the ladies retired to make preparations, and the gentlemen remained seated round the breakfast table. Hollar whispered something in the Count's ear, who cried: "Bravo I By George, we'll have it!" and trotted out of the room. The rest continued conversing, when, presently, their worthy host returned with Gabriel, who bore wine and glasses, which he set on the table.   DREAMS WITHN  DREA,S.      429 "Now go it, my boy I " said the Count, nodding. Amidst an attentive silence, Hollar rose. "Gentlemen," said he, ' the most noble the Marquis, my father, having been written to by his most dutiful son, here present,-" "Hear! hear "  sarcastically from  Prytanis, who was kicked on the shin by my lord Clodolphus, whereat he gave a doleful howl.

"'Stop!" cried the Count, breathlessly. "I have an amendment.  Let us add, the future Marquis-the presump- tive-" "Apparent," murmured my lord Clodolphus. "Presumptive," repeated the Count, with an emphasis on the word. t Presum ptive Marquis of Hollar." A great uproar ensued-general congratulations, most heart- ily from Godfroy, a little sarcastic from Prytanis, and most up-- roarious from the Count. Then rose my lord Clodolphus: u Verily," quoth he, " must I too deliver a toast. As the Count, our worthy host, objects to the dead tongues, I will verily deliver my goodly observa- tions in living ones, and confine myself to translations.--"  "Why don't you do so always?" from the Count. "For what saith Virgil?  ' Satis est pot --no I I mean, 'It is enough that you appear to have been able.'

There was no applause after this speech, but many hands were stretched out to the Count. For once the Count was fairly overcome, and his only thanks (characteristic enough, goodness knows!) was to turn to his old friend, with tears in his eyes, and say: "I will never call you old Folio any more." And now the gentlemen were summoned to attend on the ladies  As they were leaving the room, the Count drew Hol- lar aside. "You have had," said he, "6 no cause, I hope, to complain of your treatment here?" "Of course not," answered Hollar. ( When," pursued the Count, " when you were a prisoner, everything was done to lighten your condition, was it not?" That it was," replied Hollar, heartily. "Since you have been free," continued the Count, you have met with nothing but kindness here?" "Nothing," said Hollar, wondering more and more what the Count meant. "Then," continued the Count, 'will you do me a favor? It is a very little one." ; Certainly," replied Hollar. "What is it?" "Only tell me," said the Count, "were you not popping the question when I bawled to you in the garden?" Hollar squeezed the Count's hand, and they both went out in high glee. CHAPTER XLI. HOW ALL THE PARTY ENJOYED  THE DAY IN THE OLD RUII, BESIDES OTHER THNGS. AT the ruin there was great festivity. The old room was visited in which Piquemont had passed so many sad hours, and turned by the servants, when they came, to a storeroom for the dinner they carried there. "Here," said Piquemont, - was it where Wolfgang found me  . It is strange how-our misfor tunes    <pb n="432-433" xml:id="VAC6560-00000225"/> 432       DR:BAIS WITHN DRnAM3S. turn to account. Had I not been exiled, I should never have known Claude.  Had I not known Claude, lie never would have been anything but a smuggler; for it was indirectly through me that he became known to Uphorn. I never knew his name until I left here; but I saw signs of great promise in him, and gave him a letter of recommendation to the Duke, on the condition-which he faithfully observed-that he should not betray my whereabouts. Had it not been for Claude's being here (and he would have left long ago, were it not for the confidence shown him by Uphorn), he and Cecilia would never have kept their eye on Gertrude. Again, had it not been for my exile, Godfroy--my dear Godtioy-would not have scoured the country round, and so come upon the little girl just when he did, and saved her from La Chambre. In- deed, my painful exile has been the means of giving me three of the sweetest rewards of my life: for it has shown me what my child is; it has given me the love of Godfroy; and it has sent me the hope of consoling the old age of my friend Up- horn." Meanwhile, the old Professor, having left Gertrude to the care of the ladies (who began immediately to do their best to spoil her, if petting could do it), took a solitary stroll. He had already been made acquainted with the hopes which cenred round the unravelling of the child's history, and we can truly * say it rejoiced his heart. But he felt lonely, nevertheless. God only knows what is selfish, and what is not. The springs which move our affections are so hidden, the condition of our souls so unknown, that the Searcher of hearts alone can judge such questions. The old man saw the object of his tenderest love gradually slipping from his embrace; and He who wept at Lazarus's tomb surely compassionated the sorrows of that poor old man. He felt that the day's invitation had been ex- tended to him more out of consideration than for any desire for his company. "They are right," he said to himself, with a sigh. "I am surely not fit to associate with great people." So he wandered sadly among the ruins. A sudden turn brought him to a part of the castle where he could see the whole com- pany. They were seated on the grass, or wandering round. Clovis was singing, and Nora sat beside him. Kate and her squire, Godfroy, were walking up and down; Godfroy holding little Gertrude in his arms, while both were evidently playing with her as they walked. Letitia was sitting on an old column, and Hollar was bending over her, talking earnestly. The   DREAMS WIrrInTN  DREAzMS.     433 Countess and Piquemont were conversing near the entrance of the old keep. The Count was bustling about, ordering the ser- vants, and occasionally bawling to anybody near for assistance. My lord Clodolphus and Prytanis were peering about, looking at the ruin (especially the Roman part), and holding a consulta tion, in which gesticulations of a violent nature were a con- spicuous feature. "Probably," thought the Professor, "they are having an argument." Probably they were. The old man's eyes turned wistfully at them from his soli- tary station. The child seemed now in her proper sphere; he, out of his element. They seemed to have been separated for years and years, although she had only quitted his side ten minutes since. "God bless her!" sighed the old man. "Let her pass away like a dream. I have wakened. before. God I when shall my happy slumbers be no more disturbed?" He looked round wildly for a moment, then suddenly passed his hand over his eyes, and regarded the scene be- fore him with that stare we remark in the delirium which often precedes the last agony. "How  strange!" he exclaimed. "What is this place? Why should it so affect me? There seems to be a sentiment in my heart quite new, and yet (para- dox!) very, very old. What hidden relations can there be between the world of matter and the world of soul?" "Your servant, sir," said a low voice at his elbow. Hie started, and turned. Before him stood a tall thin man, whose black hair was sprinkled with gray. His green, catlike eyes gave him a very unprepossessing expression, were it not that it was redeemed by a certain sorrowful look, which ap- peared a recent passion, still sitting awkwardly on him, but which, nevertheless, was evidently sincere.  "I came to visit this spot," continued the stranger, " and, seeing a large company assembled, I paused. I am curious to know who they are. Perhaps you can give me the requisite information?" "Surely, friend," answered the Professor. ' Well, who is that old man in the corner?" "The Count of Piquemont." "Ay, ay I The exile, who lived here for a long time in disguise; the bosom friend of Uphorn, and whose daughter is about to marry Clovis Bertrand," said the stranger. 'And where is Lady Nora?" "Over there," replied the Professor, "talking to Clovis, who has just finished singing." 19    <pb n="434-435" xml:id="VAC6560-00000226"/> 434       DREAMS WITHN DREAMS. "Just so," assented the stranger. "Love and music, fow- ers and marriage. Why not? Beautiful things are homoge. neous. Let there be seven notes to harmony, seven colors to the rainbow, and seven times the length of the foot to the truly proportioned height." "And seventy times seven to the forgiveness of our bro. ther's sins," added the Professor. The stranger turned quick round, and looked searchingly at his companion, as if he would read the motive of his re. mark. But the old man had so gentle an expression, and was so evidently innocent of any particular application of his re- mark, that the stranger was satisfied, and simply answered: "If the death of Cain be avenged seven times, and the murder of Ltmech seventy times seven, the father to the orphan shall be crowned with a sevenfold crown, whose glory shall never depart. Who is that child? '! i' Gertrude," replied the other, starting at the abruptness of the question. Hardly had he spoken, when he started again, for the other suddenly shook as with an ague, and became deadly pale: "The spirit of prophecy is on me!" he cried, wildly. "Watch her. I may not look. Tell me what you see." As he said this, he veiled his countenance. The old man looked at him with a troubled expression of countenance. "Quick!" cried the stranger. i"Where is she going?" "She is running," replied the Professor, " before her com- panions. They are chasing her, and laughing. She, too, laughs. They have nearly caught her. Now the lady has her in her arms, and ki sses her." "And where is the spot?" inquired the stranger. "It is under an old tower, which rises close- to another. I believe they call them the Wicked Towers, from an idle legend of the neighborhood."' The stranger now unveiled his face. "Listen," he said, solemnly. "Go not near that spot until the time of gladness comes. Go not near it, for death lurks there, atd you are the prey it seeks. There is one other, too; but I know him not. But go not near the tower, as you value life." ,And, with these words, he passed away like a ghost. The old man saw him gliding softly down the ruins like a cat, and then disappear round an angle. He had come so suddenly, spoken so abruptly, and gone away so quickly, that the Professor hardly knew what to make   DREAeMS WITHN DREAMS.           435 of him. Their conversation seemed mere snatches, mere jump- ing, without connection, from   one subject to another.  Yet there was a certain reflection of his vague feelings in what the stranger had suggested-shadowy and unsubstantial as a dream -yet leaving, like a dream, an impression behind. Meainwhile, Godfroy asked Clovis whether he would not favor the ladies with the old legendary ballad of the Wicked Towers? As they all expressed curiosity, especially as they were on the very spot, Clovis smiled, and sang the following ballad: THE WICKED TOWERS. Hark to the wind that sighs Over the towers; Hark to the voice which mourns Sorrowful hours. For in the wind and cry Are there like measures: This, for the death of day; That, for dead pleasures. Gone and forever are Bliss and contentment: Gone at the spell of A sire's resentment. So in the wind and cry Hear we like measures: This, for the death of day; That, for dead pleasures. Up from the valley came John the lowhorn, Daring to love the child Of the Uphorn. And o'er the evening breeze, To the young maiden, Cupid on music flew, Melody laden. Up from the valley thus Rising, kept rising Love on the lyre's strains, Sorrow disguising. Lightly the mead she trod Swiftt to her lover; Trusting her holy God Smiled above her. Clattering rode there men Through the rich valley now, Leaving behind them Upon an oak's sturdy bough Something so terrible, Something so white, That the traveller seeing it Fled with affright.    <pb n="436-437" xml:id="VAC6560-00000227"/> 486        DREAMS WITHN DRAB MS. Oh! what a cry, I ween, Pierced through the vale, When Uphorn's daughter Heard the sad tale. Bury her! Bury her I Hide her from fame; Bury thy daughter To save thy proud name. Dark, in the midst of night, Dug they graves then; One for the lover who Died in the glen; One for the daughter, To rescue from scorn The name and the memory Of the Uphorn. Living they cast her in; Living, the earth they pressed Over her body Reposing unblessed. Over their graves they built Towers of strength; Towers to hide The dread secret at length. But wildly flew Rumor From mountain to vale, On the beams of the sun, On the breath of the gale, On the voice of the river, The flower's perfume, And the house of Uphorn Felt the murderer's doom. Dark from the towers now Mournfully came The voices of grief, Of sorrow, and shame. Never, ah! never Ceasing by night The wailings of woe, And the shriekings of fright. They whisper around, but low; When grief descends O'er the house of Uphorn, Or its legions of friends. Fate from these towers Swoops on the head Of the victim it marks For the land of the dead.

DREAMS wVIIN    DREAMS.      437 Quoth my lord Clodolphus: "Divers, indeed, are the opin- ions of people touching these kinds of tales. According to my view of the case, they are much misrepresented, even as were the Jews by ancient writers. Sir Walter Raleigh, a man of note, and not to be injuriously contemned by the small fky of tile world, such as our friend Prytanis (Sir Prytanis very in- dignant) and myself (Sir Prytanis consoled), tells us many things, the which, verily, I have found true. Thus Quintilian speaks infamously of the Jews. Diodore and Strabo declare they were Egyptians. Some incorrectly affirm that their exo- dus was effected by two leaders, one called Iudas, and the other Ierosolymus; which is absurd. Moses, I believe, was the gen. eral of the Israelites. 'Iustine,' says Raleigh, 'of all others most malicious, doth derive the Jews from the Syrian kings; of whom Damascus, saith he, was the first; and to him suc- ceeded Abraham, Moses, and Israel.  He again supposeth (somewhat contrary, to himself) that Israel had ten sons, amnong whom he divided the land of Iuda; so called of Iudas, his eldest, who had the greatest portion. The youngest  (Raleigh spells it yongestest, which verily is incorrect) ' of the sons of Israel he called Joseph, who, being brought up in Egypt, became learned in magical arts, and in the interpreta- tion of dreams, and signs prodigious; and this Joseph (says he) was father to Moses; who, with the rest, by reason of their foul diseases, and lest they should affect others, were ban- ished Egypt. Further, he telleth how these men, who were thus banished, when in the desert they suffered extreme thirst and famine, and therein found relief the seventh day, for this cause ever after observed the seventh day, and kept it holy; making it a law among themselves, which afterward became a branch of their religion.' So writes Raleigh; from which we may gather two tilings: first, that our good friend Instine was not wont to study the Old Testament with that care required of a good historian; and secondly, that he had an extraordinary talent for telling fibs. Could there be more lies packed to- gether in a smaller bundle? I pass over the accusations of Cornelius Tacitus and Claudius Iolaus, together with the replies of Josephus and Tertullian, and come to the application of this unto our present topic. These ballad legends are held in de- rision by those who have'never taken the trouble to examine them, and reject a proposition without weighing its evidence. In the case of the Jews, the subject was of sufficient impor- tance to be treated by the great men of divers ages. Conse-    <pb n="438-439" xml:id="VAC6560-00000228"/> ^46Q    DREAMS WITHN DREAMS. quently we have the true version. These legends, not being so important, have sunk into disgrace, witlout a fair opportunity of defending themselves." As my lord Clodolphus said this, they heard a smart crack, like a stick coming in contact with a board, followed by a whine near them. Turning iound, they saw two persons; the one, a dismal, wretched little man, who was whimpering; the other, a short, fat man, who was in the act of saying, "You be still." "Hallo!" cried Godfroy; "what do you two want here? Leave hinm alone, Smaragdus! can't you?" As the ensuing conversation was somewhat long, and inter. spersed with remarks about Ebenezer's sore head, and suchke observations, of no interest to the dear readers, we will give them only an abstract of wlhat was elicited. Ebenezer, being examined by Godfroy, said that he had been up to the castle in search of him, and was directed to the ruin by the sagacious Peter. Being cross-questioned, he said that he was commissioned to inform Godfroy to be on his guard, and to warn the Count that something was about to be done on his premises which would displease him very much. At the Count's inquiry, he replied that the object of the conspiracy was not directed against his hens; that what it was, he could not exactly make out, but that it certainly had nothing to do with the chickens. Reexamined by Godfroy, he deponed that a certain Lean- der had brought the message; that the said Leander had very indistinct ideas who sent it; that the said Leander was forth- coming, being now at hand. Whereupon the said Leander was sent for, and produced in a state of mental conglomeration and universal bewilderment. The said Leander, being examined, could not say who told him; was not certain where he was told; could not exactly take upon himself to say when it happened; was of the opin- ion it might have been in the morning; was not prepared to say it was not noon; was not disposed to maintain that- it might not have been afternoon; would not deny it might have been evening; should not be surprised if it was night. "Upon my sacred word and honor!" cried the Count. "By the revered memory of my forefathers, if that man is not a nincompoop, call me a horse! Now why," he continued, in a melancholy tone, " why, in the mysterious dispensations of fate, was that man ever thrust upon society in such a barefaced state of imbeeility?" I   DREAMS WITHN DREAMS.       439 "If it was not for my sore head-" began the wretched little man, when he was interrupted by the Count, who cried: "You and your sore head may go to the devil! What do you mean by bringing that incarnation of all that is miserable here?" Ebenezer was about to reply, when Smaragdus interrupted him by the summary process of grasping his scalp, and shaking him like a duster (indeed, quite a little cloud of dust flew out of Ebenezer's head when knocked, as you will see emerge from the bottoms of very old chairs when smartly tapped), and growled his usual "You be stilL" "Well done, fat one!" remarked the Count. Perhaps you can tell us something. You seeni to have a sensible way of correcting your friends. "Ah," said Smaragdus, solemnly, "it saves talking; and I am not fond of that." "And do you know anything to enlighten us?" inquired Godfroy.  "Do you see her?" said Smaragdus, in a hoarse voice, which sounded something like the cutting of a slate pencil, and pointing out Gertrude. "Certainly," replied Godfroy. ' She's her," said Smaragdus, solemnly. "She's who?" asked Godfroy. 'Her," quoth Smaragdus. "Look out for her. There was a fellow asking about her. And Ebenezer would have told him a lot. But I fetched him a crack, and he stopped." "Do you know any more? ' asked Godfroy. "No," said Snlaragdus, solemnly. "Very well., You can go, then," said Godfrey. "I am much obliged to you for the information." "No; let them stay, if they want to," said the Count. "I suppose you like eating and drinking?" he remarked to Sma- ragdus. Smaragdus nodded solemnly. "And you too?" said the Count to Ebenezer. "Oh! don't I?" replied the other. "And you also, you idiot there?" said the Count to Le- ander. Leander did like it. "Very well," continued the Count; "there is the beer. Go help yourselves. And you-I mean you, fat one!-if that skeleton of a Brazilian ape over there talks another word on the subject, knock him over the head with my compliments."    <pb n="440-441" xml:id="VAC6560-00000229"/> "O      DREAMS WITHN DREAMS. In order to show how fully he understood the Count's meaning, Smaragdus nearly smothered the wretched little man, by facetiously chucking a large lump of dirt, that was lying near, on ile top of his crown, where, being moist and flabby, it broke, and covered the whole outside of his head. "You leave me alone!" screamed Ebenezer. "I a'n't doing nothing. You leave me alone." "And," continued the Count, perfectly delighted, and pitching Smaragdus a gold piece, which he caught dexterously as it flew past, "if that booby goes to speak, treat him in the same way." Smaragdus, rendered vain by the applause he had received, walked solemnly up to Leander, who was sitting on the ground with his back to him. As Smaragdus marched up, Leander was just throwing his head back with a mug of beer to his lips. This probably suggested a plan to our phlegmatic friend, who deliberately sat down on his upturned face. Now Smaragdus was not a light man, and the attack was totally unexpected. So Leander lost his balance, and fell over backward. The beer ran down his neck, and Smaragdus (who retained a sitting posture on Leander's face) nearly smothered him, before he was rescued. "There," said Godfroy; "you need not try that again. We are all convinced of your zeal. And I fancy you two know your companion sufficiently, now, not to talk." "'Dear! dear!" cried Leander. "And to think of my coming here to be made a chair of I Why should you make a chair of me? Why do you not make a chair of somebody else? Iow would you like to be made a chair of yourself? Why don't you leave me alone?" "If you a'n't still," said Smaragdus, "I will throw a dish at your head." Leander was silenced. "Oh!" howled Ebenezer; "oh! my sore head.   Oh I what a mess. Oh! was there ever so much dirt in one head of hair before? Oh! I will never get it out. I will have to shave my scalp. Oh! you nasty Smaragdus." A look from that gentleman silenced him, and he took it out in sniffs. In the evening, the whole party returned to the castle, everybody keeping a good lookout for the clhild, whom Godfroy would bear in his arms. Her eyes, sparkling in the sloping rays of the setting sun, danced with merriment. The child   DREAMS WITTH  DREAMS.      441 was absolutely intoxicated with delight. She had already won the Count's heart by going and feeding his hens. She could hardly be kept away from them. Hence she was high in his graces. Her silvery laugh, her extraordinary beauty, and her cunning little ways had done the rest; and I do not believe there was one of the ladies who would have refused her their jewels, even, if she had wanted them, or one of the gentlemen who would not have crawled all the way on his hands and knees, had she desired to play horse, and expressed such a wish. The old Professor followed quietly, praying all the way for grace to resist the selfish feelings of sorrow and loneliness which crowded so thickly in his heart. And his prayer was answered. Never after, until the end, did he feel melancholy again. A calm, passing all understanding, pervaded his thoughts. And it was afterward remembered how the quiet old man spoke and acted from that day, as if he had fought a good fight, had finished his course, had kept the faith, and as if there was henceforth laid up for him a crown of justice, which the Lord, the just Judge, would soon render him. CHAPTER     XLII. HOW THE COUNT HAD AN ADVENTURE, AND HOW   HE FARED THEREIN; TOGETHER WITH A FEW REMARKS. THE information vaguely given by Ebenezer. Leander, and Smaragdus, had excited the Count's curiosity. Having a great opinion of his own sagacity, he had heard of Sir Wolfgang's success with the same feelings that, as all little boys who have gone through Anthon's Jacob's Greek Reader know, actuated Themistocles, when he heard of Miltiades and Marathon-he burned to emulate his deeds. Like 'all great geniuses, the Count did not disdain advice when it suited him. Consequently, as Sir Wolfgang, when he first started to seek Piquemont, had gone to the tavern, he de- termined to do the same thing, and not say anything about it; thus benefiting indirectly by what we may call Sir Wolfgang's discretion, without losing credit for intelligence. 19*    <pb n="442-443" xml:id="VAC6560-00000230"/> But the Count was a man who stood a great deal on his dignity; and, as he walked along, he revolved in his mind how he could hear the conversation in the inn, without entering the plebeian circle of those who were in the habit of fiequentilng the same. "For it will never do," he said to himself, " for mei to be talking with tailors, barbers, sextons, and the like." Hence it was a great satisfaction for our friend to find no- body in the public room when he entered. ': By George!" quoth he to himself; "I can hide over there, creep out after they have shut up, and nobody the wiser." The spot designated as " over there," was a large, empty beer barrel, lying on its side in a corner. As it will be neces- sary, for the full understanding of what is to follow, that the dear reader should know what it was intended for, and why it was there, we must pause to describe the apparatus. Ernest Toservem, fearing robbers, had purchased a huge dog, which was soon to arrive. As the animal was uncom- monly large, and uncommonoly fierce, he had constructed a pro. visional doghouse, quite of his own invention. This was made of an immense beer barrel, at the open end of which a strong bar of iron had been fastened. Crosswise, another movable bar was arranged, which, when let down through a hole in the top into a hole in the bottom, closed up the opening like a grating. When let down, the weight of the bar sustained it in its position. Under those circumstances, the dog could nei- ther remove the bar, nor squeeze out; for the movable bar, having a hook at the bottom, had only to be twisted, and it locked the barrel up, so to speak. It was into this barrel the Count determined to creep. Looking first carefully round to be sure he was not observed (for he was afraid of ridicule), he popped in just in time to escape the eyes of two persons who entered the room. Now, to pop was one thing, and to pop prudently was an- other. Not understanding the destination of the barrel, the Count jarred it considerably as he crawled in. Consequently the bar descended-luckily, between the Count's legs, or it would have hurt him-and just as consequently the Count was in a trap. He could not draw his legs up, for there was no room. He could not turn on his back, for the bar was in the way. He could not lift the bar, for the following reason- "What's that?" cried Ernest Toservem, entering the room with Smaragdus just as the Count had concealed himself. ' Confound that bar 1 it has fallen." And, so saying, he gave c   DREAMS WITIINT DREAMS.       443 it a screw, unconsciously debarring the Count from his last hope of escape. Luckily, the opening was next to the wall or he must have seen a pair of legs sticking out behind. "This is very awful," thought the Count, as he lay on his stomach. "If I speak, I can never show my face in the vil- lage again. I shall probably die here of starvation; and whllen, at some future day, they remove this infernal barrel, my dust only will be found." And the perspiration rolled down his face. Ernest and Smaraglus sat down before the fire to smoke. "If that fat man," tlought the Count, "was only away, I could trust Ernest." But the fat man did not go away, and the Count was obliged to listen to a variety of topics, told by the innkeeper, who was in a talkative humor, and honored by Smaragdus with divers solemn nods and grunts; when a new annoyance sprang up. There happened to be at the inn a peddler, who possessed a very sprightly terrier of pure breed, and greatly admired. In common with other dogs of his kind and age, he was wont to play. Also he was given to poke into corners, and perform divers antics with ig he could lay his teeth on. He re. joiced in the e   of Jacass. Now Jackass, rushing sideways into the room, soon ex- plored every corner in the same. Coming upon the barrel in his exploring expedition, he conceived the Count to be a toy especially put there for his delectation; and, being a sprightly dog, commenced gnawing at every angle which that gentle- man's body presented, more to his own joy than to the Count's gratification. The sports of Jackass, being usually of a boisterous descrip- tion, attracted no attention. The Count, who heroically deter. mined to stand anything rather than suffer exposure, did not even venture a. kick. He strove, by caresses, to keep the dog quiet. But, instead of receiving them in the spirit in which they were intended, the animal, taking the Count evidently for another dog, only became more turbulent in his mirth, and conm- menced chewing the nose of that mighty nobleman. Being deprived of this amusement by the Count's shoving him away, he scampered some two or three dozen times from the nape of his neck to his heels, and back again, and finally seized his smallclothes between his teeth, and shook them violently. The Count put his hand carefully down, and tried to pull    <pb n="444-445" xml:id="VAC6560-00000231"/> "4       DREAMS  rITHN DREAMS, them away. The dog resisted. It was verily pull Dick, pull devil. Finally, both succeeded, but at the cost of the Count's nether garments; for, a hole being made, the Count pulled up, and Jackass pulled down; and, between them, they managed to make a considerable rent. As, when a breach is made in the wall of a besieged city; as, when a hole is formed in a dike, the work of destruction becomes easy: so the fatal rent was the cause of the utter de- struction of our friend's clothes. In a helpless agony, he felt that infernal dog tear piece after piece away in strips. He was getting more and more naked; but what could he do? I am not prepared to say to what extent Master Jackass would have undressed the Count, had not supper called his attention away; but I am certain the Count's legs were pretty nearly bare when the terrier left him alone. "He will be back again," groaned the Count, when left to himself, "in less than half an hour." And he tried again to escape. "6 If I only had a little more elbow room!" he mut- tered, making herculean efforts, and vainly. "What did I come here for?" he groaned. "By George! I am in a pre- cious mess. Wouldn't Clodolphus enjoy it? I wonder what he would do in such a position? Quote himself out, I sup- pose." By and by the company returned, but withont the -dog. "Where is Jackass?" asked the wretched little man. "Oh!" replied Toservem, "he is outdoors. I never let him in after supper." "Thank goodness!" thought the Count. "I wish the pro- hibition had extended before, as well as after. I never will have a terrier in my establishment, if I can help it." "Pray do have him in for once," said Ebenezer. The Count groaned. "What was that?" asked Toservem, looking up. "Only a rat," replied the wretched little man. Ernest consented, and Jackass was introduced. After cut- ting divers capers, and jumping on each of the company, he quietly lay down by the fire. A moment after, he suddenly remembered his friend in the barrel, and was at him again. This. time the Count, who could bear it no more, gave hm an awful kick, which sent him sprawling into the middle of the room. (' Why, what is the matter with the beast?" cried Ernest. "ook out for hydrophobia I " screamed Ebenezer, jump- ing on his chair.   DREAMS WITHN DREAMS.        445 "Get out, you vermin!" cried Ernest, turning him out of the room, and shutting the door on him. "There! we have got rid of him now.  Aha, Solomon, my boy!    How are you?" Solomon Coffin, who had just entered, assured the innkeeper that he was robust. "Bah! what stale beer I " cried Ebenezer, making a wry face. "You must have drawn it a fortnight ago." "; Nonsense!" cried Ernest. "Let us have a taste." "Just do," replied the wretched little nman. "By all that is flat I " cried the innkeeper, after raising the mug to his lips; "you are right. I will go down and get some more." With this, he spat a mouthful of beer behind the barrel, right on the Count's legs, and went down to draw some better. While he was gone, Smaragdus, whose mug had been filled at the same tap, deliberately crossed the room, and, stretching a little over the barrel, so that his arm just reached the other end, emptied an imperial quart of malt liquor over the Count. "Upon my word!" groaned the peer. "What next, I wonder? I am resigned to anything, now. Oh! why did I leave my happy home, to go on such an errand?   Soppy, naked, and stuck in an old beer barrel, what would my friends think of the noble Count Bertrand?" . So passed the evening. The Count heard, certainly, a mis- cellaneous conversation, but had not the heart to pay any atten- tion to it. He just lay down in his beer puddle, and went to sleep. The guests at last retired, and he was alone.  "By George I " lie cried; "I will get out now, if I have to gnaw my way out." With that, he felt at his belt for his poniard. Drawing it with some difficulty, he inserted it into the head, and, Using it as a lever, found, to his great joy, that it was beginning to give way. Inspired by success, he tugged and tugged, and at last emerged from his prison, in about as pitiful a plight as he ever could have imagined. "So much for hunting up other people's business," he said, shaking himself, and tying up the strips of clothes which hung round his legs, as well as he could. "Now, to get out and go home. I wonder where the door is?" "Old man I " said Dame Toservem, shaking her husband; "old man u "    <pb n="446-447" xml:id="VAC6560-00000232"/> "O      DrEiAxMS WITr IIrN DE\AMS. "What?" asked Ernest, drowsily. "There's thieves down stairs." "Nonsense!" said Ernest, turning round with a grunt. "I tell you there are," continued his spouse. "Just listen." Ernest sat up in the bed, and listened attentively. "By Jove!" he said, after a moment; "I believe you are right." And, with these words, he got carefully out of bed, dressed himself hastily, and crept lightly down stairs. Meanwhile, the Count, finding the door was locked, was fumbling about for the key, when he heard some one coming down. Not knowing it was Toservem, he stood motionless, hardly daring to breathe. "Al, you rascal!" cried Ernest, at a venture; "I see yol. " It was pitch dark. "I see you " repeated Ernest. "You had better give in peaceable; because it will be all the worst for you if you don't." "Is that you, Ernest?" said the Count, in a low voice "Ah, it's Ernest," replied the innkeeper. "Don't speak so loud," whispered the Count. "I am Clunt Bertrand. For heaven's sake, let me out." "You're a pretty fellow, to tell such lies!" said the inn- keeper, laying hold of him by the collar. "I wonder you don't tell me you are the Emperor of Chayney." "Take your hand off my collar!" said the Count, whose blood was up, in a low, deep voice; "or, by the faith we both believe, I will stab you. I am Count Bertrand, man. Do you not know my voice?" Ernest knew it now. Astounded, le let go his hold. "Lead me to a private room," said the Count, authorita- tively, " and mind you let no one know I ani here. I wish to speak to you alone." Perfectly mystified, Ernest obeyed. But, if tie was mysti- fied in the dark, how much more so was he when he saw the condition which the Count's clothing presented in the light. "' Let me out quietly," said the Count. "I need hardly tell you to keep silent on this matter. Leave the door open, and tell all who inquire, that you forgot to lock it, and that a strange man came in to inform you of the fact." Still more mystified, Ernest did as the Count ordered him. As they passed the stairs, Ebenezer, who had descended, poked   DREAMS WITHN DRfTAMS.       447 his nose out of the door of the public room. Whereupon, to use. his own words when he related the story afterward, Ernest gave him " a smack on the snout "-meaning a smart blow on the nose. Whereat Ebenezer's head disappeared instantly, and the Count escaped unrecognized. "By George!" he said to himself, as he walked home, "I am well out of that scrape. I will never go hunting after evi- dence again." With that resolution, he set to work to coin some lie which should explain the condition of his wardrobe. He had no ne- cessity, however, for making use of any such pious fraud, for he found the private door open, ascended to his room, rolled his garments into a ball, and threw them into the fire. While he was watching the blaze, the Countess woke, and asked him what o'clock it was. For that lady had long ceased to inquire into what her lord and master did, or even wonder at it. She then turned over, and went to sleep. When his clothes were entirely consumed, he jumped into bed, and fell asleep also. So passed the first of the four days we omitted, while pur- suing Sir Wolfgang on his journey to Villaburg in search of Brother Stanislaus, and the terrible sorceress, Margaret Halles, or Ellen, as she should properly be called. Now, in a certain chapter of this very talented work, I gave, I believe, the dear reader a short historical sketch of Dreamland at the beginning of the seventeenth century. The dear reader may possibly have wondered why I gave that sketch; what the revolutionary part of this book has to do with the subject on hand; and why, in fine, if little Gertrude'a parentage was our sole object, why I put in all about the storm- ing of Viot, the promotion of Claude (who seems to be forgot- ten), and the appearance of my lord Rappenhammer, Sir Peter de Steele, Adolphe, Hans von Schnapsheim, and Sir Christo- pher Weezy, etc. All very proper questions. Now let me answer them. When I look back upon my life, I ask myself very similar questions. Why, upon the little stage of my personal experi- ence, have so many flitted for an instant, and then disappeared  forever-not died, but actually disappeared? A great revolu- tion distracted Europe in 1849. This revolution caused a cer- tain man to fly from home, and emigrate to America. The ill- ness of a relation brought me to a distant part of the United States. I met that man on a steamboat. I liked him, and he    <pb n="448-449" xml:id="VAC6560-00000233"/> "8       DRUEAM3S WITIIIN DREAIS,. liked me. We have never met since, nor do I know what be. came of him. Do I think the European revolution was got up just to bring us two together for a few hours on a steamboat? Of course I do not. And vet it actually had that effect. Now, on the microcosmic stage of the novelist, he is bound to represent things as lie finds them. The nations of Dream- land of the seventeenth century must show a revolutionary aspect, or they are either behind or in advance of their age. If these national struggles contribute to develop our phantom heroes, and bring strange things to light, apparently too trivial effects for the causes producing them, is not this what we see in a stronger and stronger point of view every day we live? Don't talk to me. Maybe I do not describe well; still I aim at telling what I know, and you know, and everybody knows. Say you don't know, and I will tell you you do. And now for another confession. Thackeray seems never tired of telling us that every house has a skeleton. Open any of his books at any page, and you will be almost as sure of finding a skeleton in them as in a doctor's library. He is still harping on his skeleton. But why not? Petrarch's sweetheart. had a skeleton, I am sure, and bawled lustily when she knocked her funnybone against any hard surface, such as a washstand or a chest of drawers. But we also all have skeletons hidden away in some closet, besides the ordinary osseous framework of our bodies. Thackeray says the spiritual closet-skeleton of a man is always a woman-some first love, fairly wooed, never won, whom he keeps (spiritually) locked up, like Rogers's Ginevra, in a box up in the garret, whither he proceeds when the madame is asleep, and on which he sighing gazes. What is all this but nonsenses? First loves are all very well; but there is an atmosphere-to speak poet- ically-of molasses candy and gingerbread about them, which is a little too sweet. First loves! Well, I like that. I am sure I have a skeleton, but I am as"equally positive that it is not a first love; and I know many in the same predicament, too. I have no hesitation in confessing what my skeleton is, I am sure. The only trouble is, the difficulty I find in persuading other people to believe it, when I give them the required infor- mation. It is an excess of modesty. And now the skeleton, like the ghost of Hamlet's father, appears on the scene. I must out with it. It bears the dread- ful name of FAILURE. Failure to do what? Ah, ' to be, or not to be; that is the   DREAMS WITHN DREAMS.        449 question." To be read, or not to be read; to be published, or not to be published ; to be condemned, or not to be condemned -those are the questions: In my nightmares I see the Devil on Two Sticks, who stands between the printing office and my. self. One thumb is on his nose, and the fingers of that hand are extended. The other thumb is on the little finger of the first hand, and the fingers of the second hand are extended also. Working his two hands like fans, he grins at me. And so the vision fadeth. But failure to do what? Here I am at a loss. I ask my- self, ".What the devil is your object in writing?"And I am forced to reply, "I am sure I don't know." Something in me compels the answer. Says the critic, "Is it a patchwork of odds and ends loosely basted together?"   I say, "Well, I don't know but it is." Says the critic, "' Is it a mere reflection of your thoughts, just as they came up?" I say, "Well, I really can't say it is not."  Says the critic, "Do you think people are fools enough to like such kind of stuff?" I say, "Upon my   word, I think- I do." "Well, then," says the critic, "you must have a nice opinion of people in general." Then enter Failure, as ghost. "Good   gracious!"I cry; "have I written all these pages for that? Mercy on me l there's a ghost." Yes," says critic, complacently; " how do you like him?"  "Please take him away I " I say. "Ha! ha! ha!" cries the critic, laughing like a fiend. "See the last act of your tragedy." A nd what do I see? I see my Work, dressed d la Don Giovanni. Don Candor acts the part of Leporello. "Think  of your sins!"  cries Candor Leporello. "Think of the characters you have mur- dered! Think of the fine women you have spoiled!" "Ha I lia! la! '" sings my Work. "I repent, Candor?  I?   Ha  lha! Never!" Knock!   knock! knock! Exit Candor Leporello, and rushes back with terror. "The statue! the statue!" it cries. My Work seizes a  candle, and goes out (I mean the Work, not the candle), and presently returns scared half to death, and white as a sheet. Tramp! tramp! tramp! Enter Failure, as Statue. Fail- ure, assisted by the drums and trumpets, reproaches Giovanni Work. "  Repent! repent! repent!" "Never I  never! never!" "Repent!"  "Never "   "Repent-ent-ent!" "Never. er-er-er!"

Enter a legion of foul fiends. The Work strug- gles, but in vain. They grab it, they carry it off, and, with a; howl, throw it down, down, down, into the receptacle for con- demned literature. Says Candor, with Moliere's servant of Don Juan, "My master is gone. My wages are unpaid I " Unpaid I I pity you, my good friend! What a little knowledge of the world you possess! When was Candor ever paid? Let "More kiclks than halfpence" be the motto of the great candid family. CHAPTER XLIII. REMARKS, ETC. "MY story is drawing to a close. Soon must I dismiss my shadowy friends, and gaze once more upon the realities of life. One more act, and it is concluded. What do you think of that, Codger?" So I remarked, as we sat together on the piazza, looking up at the stars, and smoking our pipes placidly. "I think," replied that gentleman, twisting his mouth into the shape of the letter O for the purpose of ejecting the to- bacco smoke in rings; "I think the conclusion is the best part, and your Don Giovanni idea perfection. As to the thing draw- ing to a close, no reasonable person can have any objection, I am sure. If your story only pleases once, it will have the merit of adding to the word 'Finis,' the'ejaculation, 'Thank goodness! 1'" "Upon my word!" said I, with a discontented, not to say sulky, expression of countenance. "Yes," pursued the Codger, calmly. "On the subject of your being overburdened with m4desty, we must all have our little opinions-to which we are entitled as free citizens of this great republic-and agree to differ, like the religious denomina- tions round us." "Overburdened with modesty!" growled my candid friend. "You may be, but I'll be hanged if I ever found it out. You do well to say so, because it is an act of virtue to enlighten the   ignorant; and no one of your acquaintances ever suspected it." Akn h continued the Codger, i is very evident you don't know how to write a book. The bone and sinew of a good literary production is the vein of sense which runs through every chapter, as precious metals come through the different strata on their way to the surface. Nonsense should only be a mask to hide truth. Incident should be so constructed as to convey a moral. Whereas, your scenes are only frces at best, br secondhand sentiment." nd," remarkedmy tow-headed cousin   "ho  are you ever to get on without combining a little more originality with the commonplace? Did you ever read a novel, or hear of one, that had not either a lost child or a pair of lovers? You must recollect that the merit of a great writer consists in his new way of treating old things. Scott brings you in contact with Templars, the youths of the Swiss Cantons, Highlanders, Robin ftood, the Crusaders, and the fanatics of the Covenant. Dick. ens takes you into the streets of London.

True, you have written so many pages; but Lessing tells us, in his fable, that travelling all over the world does not make a stupid person clever; and you may take your oath, writing so many quires of foolscap don't make the scribe a man of genius.

You little terrier dogs are always fiercest, and think yourselves great shakes at a fight, because we great dogs don't mind your barking." This speech cooled me a little, and the absurdity of my fighting my companions, any one of whom could have thrown me into the middle of next week, struck me forcibly. I looked silly, and then burst into a laugh. "Come, that's better," said my tow-headed cousin. "If it will put you into a better humor, I confess you have worked harder than I ever gave you credit for doing. You have writ. ten four times as much as I ever supposed you capable of writing on one subject; and if the thing is not worth much, you have at least done your best; and Shakspeare could not have done more." "Ay," quoth the Codger, "let us give the little man his due. We would certainly have been awfully bored in this hole of a place, had he not set us laughing at his tragedy, and cry- ing at his comedy-I mean, crying at his comedy, and laugh- ing at his tragedy." "I don't care a snap about all your opinions tied in a bunch and hung round my neck," I replied, in a better humor. "I can keep my head above water, I bet, in spite of them. I believe in the old saying, that everything was made for some- thing. What is writing? Is it not the art of putting your thoughts on paper properly?  Practise at, composition, and you are certain of ultimately being able properly to express your thoughts. Now the question remains, What are the thoughts worth? It seems to me that every one, if he sticks to his proper accomplishment, and writes on that, must produce something worth reading. Let the cobbler write of mending shoes. It will interest the world of cobblers. So with the artist, the physician, the poet, the lawyer, and so on. What is failure? Have we not all read how a shoemaker criticized the picture of Apelles? As long as he made his observations on the shoes, he was right. Trying, then, to criticize other parts of the picture, the painter dryly remarked, ' Shoemaker, stick to your last! ' Well, failure arises from our not sticking to our lasts. Take Milton, for instance. How enchanting are his Allegro and Penseroso! How beautiful are his descriptions of the terrestrial paradise, and the happiness, shame, contention, and reconciliation of our first parents! There he is sublime, because he sticks to his last. But take his war of the angels. What is more ridiculously absurd? What is more foreign to   DREAMS WITHN DREAMS.       453 our ideas of the angelic nature? The bad angels bowl the good ones down, like ninepins with cannon balls! If the Eng- lish Mamonides is transcendentally sublime in his genius, he is equally transcendentally absurd in his failure. I can imagine Beelzebub touching off the infernal seventy-four. Pop Down goes Gabriel, and a dozen inferior angels! God forgive me. I should not laugh at such subjects; but I really intend no irrev- erence. I merely wish to point out how signally the great English epic poet has failed, when he did not stick to his last." iWell, now, suppose you go ahead," remarked Cheesy, taking his pipe from between his teeth. "You are right," said my candid friend. "Go on, my boy." CHAPTER XLIV. TOUCHNG MSCELLANEOUS MATTERS. THE morning of the second day after Sir Wolfgang's de- parture was rainy. Down came the contents of Urania's watering pot on hill and valley, castle and cot, stream and pond; making every puddle look pockmarked; turning hens into miserable bunches of feathers; taming the haughtiness of roosters; driving turkeys to base, ignoble retreat; and form- ing innumerable temporary ponds for the future delectation of ducks. It came down uncompromisingly. You could not mis- understand it. It was going to rain all day, and there was'no use talking any more about it. The dogs, to wit, Romulus, Bingo, and Heliogabalus, crouched under the porch until com- passionately admitted to kitchen joys and the consolations of a shelter. The company amused themselves as best they could. The ladies took their sewing and embroidery down to the great saloon. My lord Clodolphus, Prytanis, and the Professor assembled in the library-a room long disused, with great folios, dusty with age, lying in neglected rows, where they had been left thirty years ago by the Count's father. They invited the young men to join them, but both the young gentlemen and Piquemont preferred ladies' society. Little Gertrude was every- where: now coming to the library and climbing up the Profes- sor's knee; now trotting up stairs to where the Count was lying    <pb n="454-455" xml:id="VAC6560-00000236"/> 45 t    DER:-IAMS WITHN DiREAM[S.. in bed after his night 's adventure, and chatting about the poul- try, peed aftring into everyting in te roo pulling his nightcap off and imiuing merrily away with it, while the old nobleman zily lay on his side, laughing at everything she did; now akiy to the. saloon, and, taking a seat by Kate, pretended 'kI ipping to the sto             te morn- to sew industriously with a pin and string. And so te mor- ing passed pleasantly away. in the dusty old library, a fourth person, in the shape of coun thstened to te earned conversation. t  ou he room end la eis e the ,t  which the Professor, Pry- tahes, and my lord Clodolphus would have chosen of all others in the castle. It was an old, out ofthe-way, qi et place, with walls disproportionally high to the gextent f e aat t. About to thousand vole, of every shpe and size, had been collected. All of thebooks which were not upside down, or placed with their backs to te wall (ad tere were enoh of them, for the Count despised literature), presented a noble array of titles; but no two volumes were placed c0nsecltively, except where my lord Clodolphus had been at work. Dust had so accumulated on them, that, to take one down, was like clean- ing a chimney. Yet they were a splendid collection, for all that. Deep oriel windows, with old, stainee glass in them, a   iI, nalyz    i ed the sun'r dds  te ons ep th e my terious Vibgyor. n came the lght, green  violet, and red, throing a partic ed antle of glory over th serene countenance of the learned Cloolphus. "And how goes the fight, Sir Claude?" inquired that philosophic man. "Oh!" replied Claude, y there will not be much of thcat, I fancy. They are negotiating, and you know what that meanis. Each is trying to win with his wits what e might have lost "Veriye goor   d conceit,. quoth my lord Clodolphus. "Truly may we say, with Apollonius: analyzerud sun's rays, a' n Delectabatur enim  Animus simnul form adulcibusque verbis.' The which I have myself translated, trying to keep to the sense of the original, thus:   DRE'AMS WITrTHN DI AM S.       455 'For ravished is The soul by the enchantment of sweet words, As by the witchery of loveliness.' And the diplomatist can effect, verily, by his honeyed tongue, far more than the soldier by his sword." "Sinner that I am! I disagree with you," quoth Prytanis. "Ah, you do, do you?"   replied my lord Clodolphus. "Truly may we say, that a Daniel has risen in judgment. And pray, how will your learning disprove my assertion?" "Were not the Etruscans," quoth Prytanis, " civilized enough? And yet the brute force of Rome crushed them into calves'-foot jelly?" "T The Etruscans," * replied my lord Clodolphus, " or rather Tuscans-for even in Cato's time were they called Tusci; whence the modern Toscana and Toscani-died, like all na- tions, of old age. Itad they not subdued the Tyrrhenians and the UTmbrians? Did they not spread over Venetia, and part of Tyrol; occupy the Alpine regions of the Po; take posses- sion of Coere, Gravisce, Alsium, and Saturnia; and wrest Pisa from the Pelasgians? Are not Mantua and Verona, the birth- places of Virgil and Pliny, old Tuscan cities? And Etruria fell slowly, very slowly. For one century she steadily de- clined. The next found her manfully struggling with Rome. The next two centuries passed, and she was still unconquered; and her final struggle with Sylla is shrouded in historical gloom. Etruria, we have good reason to believe, fell, as your favorite poet tells us the Soldan died: 'Yet dying, no disgrace Stains his long glory; to the last, his eye Glows with the memory of his state and race; He shunn'd no strokes, he heaved no groan or sigh, Nor did a single thing but what was great and high.'  "Wretches that we all are!" cried Prytanis; "what non- sense we talk sometimes! Here is a Professor, a learned man. Let him decide the question." "Not so," quoth my lord Clodolphus; "I never appeal, when reason has pronounced within her proper jurisdiction. I tell you, the Etrurians were a mighty people both in arms and civilization. Livy verily tells us that Romulus took his idea of apparitors from them; as likewise were borrowed the curule chair and the purple-edged gown." * The Etruscans formed, in very old times, what may be termed the feudal United States of Italy.    <pb n="456-457" xml:id="VAC6560-00000237"/> "Ay, and their licentiousness, too," quoth Prytanis. "Read Theopompis." "Theopompis be hanged!" said my lord Clodolphus. "What is he but a gossiping old retailer of calumnies?" "Read Posidonius," murmured Prytanis. "And what does he prove, but that Etruria was a thriving country?" replied my lord Clodolphus. "Have you read Fes- tus on their ritual books?" ' Don't believe a word Festus says," answered Prytanis. "Oh, you don't!" retorted my lord Clodolphus. "Per- haps you were there at the time, and ought to know better. Perhaps Plutarch will please you a little better." "An old granny," said Prytanis. "Oh, indeed!" replied my lord Clodolphus. "Allow me to say that your reading has not been very beneficial to you. What do you say of Thucydides' remarks on the Tyrrheni. ans? Perhaps you are going to object to him? Do you know, I really should not be surprised if you objected to Thu- cydides?" "Never heard of the man," quoth Prytanis. "Very possibly," replied my lord Clodolphus. "There are a great many things, evidently, you do not know. Smat- terers like you are deuced apt to expose themselves when they talk. My advice to you is, to shut that ugly mouth of yours, and never open it but to put victuals in. Old people say we have two ears and only one mouth, to show us that we should do twice as much listening as talking. This, of course, is hyperbolical, since its literal meaning could never be carried out; for, if everybody should resolve to hear twice as much as they uttered, who would do the talking? But the meaning is plain enough." Now this was neither respectful nor courteous, I confess, in my lord Clodolphus; but we must excuse him on the plea, that, if there was one thing which stirred up his bile more than another, it was false pretension. "Ah," he continued, "how little we know of the ancient inhabitants of Italy; of the Ligurians, the (Enotrians, the Iapygians, the Pelasgians, the Teleboans, the Sabines, and the Latins, the inhabitants of Samnium, Liguria, Apulia, Lucania, Campania, and Gallia Cisalpina-" "At it already?" said the Count, entering the room. "I give you my word, Clodolphus, that I truly believe you will die, some day, trying to get out some of your big words.   DREAMS WITHN DREAMS.        457 Why can't you leave people alone? Nobody wants to hear about all that dust and ashes, buried ages ago, and raked up nowadays by lazy folks who have nothing else to do. Where is-oh! there you are, Sir Claude. Gabriel told me you wanted to see me. What's in the wind?" "Really nothing, my lord," replied Claude; "but as you all are interested in little Gertrude, and as I heard you were somewhat mysteriously warned yesterday, I thought I would come and tell you what I knew." "I am sure, Sir Claude," replied the Count, seating him- self, "that I shall be happy to hear anything you have to say." The Count was too true a gentleman not to treat Claude much differently from the way he generally went to work with my lord Clodolphus. His high sense of what was right, taught him instinctively that a young man, recently elevated, would feel hurt at any apparent slight, and be ready to fancy one even when none was intended. So, while the Count talked to my lord Clodolphus more as if he were the son of a blacksmith than a peer, he addressed the son of a blacksmith as if he was a lord. "All I have to say," said Claude, bowing, "is not much. But, while mystery surrounds anything, the smallest occurrence may prove a clue." "Certainly," quoth my lord Clodolphus. "Cicero says-" "Now, pray let Cicero lie in his coffin," said the Count, and I shall be very much obliged to you. Go on, Sir Claude, if you please." "A very strange thing happened last night," continued Claude; "and as they say some plot is being hatched against you, I thought it my duty to communicate the few vague facts which came to my knowledge this morning." "I am much obliged to you," replied the Count. "When were you last at Toservem's inn?" demanded Claude, carelessly. The Count colored. Not for a long while," he replied. When you were last there," continued Claude, " did you observe an empty beer barrel in the corner?" think I did," answered the Count, faintly, and growing redder and redder. "Somebody was in there, last night," said Claude. The Count dared not trust himself to speak. "And what is more," continued Claude, "he had a pair of 20    <pb n="458-459" xml:id="VAC6560-00000238"/> 458       DREAMS WITHN DREAMS. your underclothes on. These strips were found in it this morn- ing, by a dismal little man called Ebenezer." "Good gracious! Let us see them," said my lord Clodol. Xhus. "Why, they are very like the ones you had on 'yester- day, Count." "No; mine were darker," muttered the Count, feebly. "Now," continued Claude, " this man Ebenezer avers that he heard voices in the night, and slipped quietly down. Chancing to look out of the public room where he had con- cealed himself, he received a tap on the nose from Ernest, who, he says, was letting a very villainous-looking man out of the house." "Bless my soul!" said my lord Clodolphus. "What is more," continued Claude, "this morning, Eben- ezer found this strip in the beer barrel; and, looking further, saw that the top was knocked out. Besides this, there is a peddler in the house, who has a little terrier called Jackass-a beautiful dog-" "I hate the sight of terriers," growled the Count. "Some do," replied Claude. "However, another strip was found in his kennel, with the arms of your family marked on it. That somebody has been representing your person, cannot be doubted; for Ebenezer himself believled, on second thoughts, until I assured him to the contrary, that it was you Ernest let out of the inn last night." "' And verily so it was!" cried my lord Clodolphus, clap- ping his hands together. "Was it not, Bertrand?" The Count looked annoyed, then hesitated, and at length burst into a laugh; "By George! Clodolphus," said he, " you have ferreted me out." And he related the whole history, much to the amusement of his hearers. "But," he said, in conclusion, " for goodness' sake, keep it to yourselves. Don't let it, on any account, creep out in the village." My lord Clodolphus was too goodnatured not to understand the Count's embarrassment, and proceeded to reassure him in his own way. "Verily," quolh he, "was not Magnus Gon- salva (saith Jovius) first honored, and subsequently exiled? Yes, indeed. Nor must we forget Marius, who, after his ex- pulsion from Rome, first retired to his villa at Salonium; thence fled to Ostia, and embarked on a vessel provided by Nu- inerius; thence proceeded to Circeii, thence to Minturnae, thence to IEnaria, thence to Sicily, thence to Africa, where the Praetor Sextilius compelled him to hide among the islands of the coast.   DREAMS WITHI  DREAMS.       459 Thus, Bertrand, have you verily been compelled, by untoward fate, to conceal yourself; and I will respect your person, even as the assassin respected -Marius." The Count was too much in the power of my lord Clodol- phus to resent his remarks, as he would have done under other circumstances. So he meekly resigned himself to his friend's Joquacity; who had the forbearance, however, to desist speedily. CHAPTER XLV. HOW CLAUDE HAD AN INTERVIEW WITH DAME SEWELL, AND HOW ERNEST TOSERVEM BROUGHT A LETTER TO MY LORD CLODOL- PHUS. CLAUDE, having had the conversation related in the forego-' ing chapter, refused the invitation given him to spend the day in the castle, and pursued his way toward Cecilia's cottage. On the road, as he passed Sewell's house, the wife of that wor- thy tailor called to him, and asked him to come in for a mo. ment. Claude, who was amiability itself, jumped off his horse, and followed her into the house. Jonathan was not in, she said. She wanted to see him alone. "See me!" cried Claude, astonished. ' Yes,' replied Dame Sewell.  "You have recently been made a great man; but I remember you a boy.   I can talk freely to you; and what I tell you, you can repeat to those I dare not address. Will you not?" "Surely I will," replied Claude. "What is it? It seems to distress you." "It does," said the woman, sitting down, and wiping her eyes.  It has distressed me long. God forgive me! I have kept silent when I should have spoken, and I know not what mischief I may have done." I "Can it not be remedied?" asked Claude. "I do not know," answered the woman.  "Innocent as I am, the weight of guilt has pressed upon me for years. They say that the parents of little Gertrude are to be discovered; but you cannot know all, except from me. "I was once a  handsome girl. Never mind how I look    <pb n="460-461" xml:id="VAC6560-00000239"/> now. A man loved me, or rather said he did. He told me how he would marry me; how he was heir to a great fortune, and how he was of a noble family. All this was true. His name was Joseph Occa, otherwise known as Joseph (also Curma) La Chambre." Claude started. "He is," continued the woman, "the last of the proud race of Uphorn. Wlhen he dies, the family name will depart. The Occas have been a fierce- race. But two of them have been exceptions, and those two are the present Duke and his holy father. "I was, as I told you, then a handsome girl. It was many years ago. But I discovered his perfidy before it was too late. Thank God! before it w"as too late. "' Yet I loved him still. He had a strange influence over me. . I would neither see nor speak to him. My present hus- band, a man whom I had looked down upon, I married, so as to show Joseph Occa that all ties between us were broken for- ever, "e A year or so before Gertrude's birth, a lady came here of the name of Gallahaut, with her daughter. There also came two women, who called themselves Catherine and Marga- ret Halles. The lady and her daughter occupied a house by %hemselves. The two sisters dwelt in a cottage, alone. Yet they evidently had known each other at some previous period. "Joseph, whom I had lost sight of for years, suddenly ap- peared in the village. At the same time, an immense man, with red hair, also appeared. I found out that he wore a wig, and was evidently here in disguise. He continually visited the house of Madame Gallahaut, while Joseph as continually vis- ited the two sisters. Knowing the man, I determined to keep my eyes open. "I soon saw that Joseph was watching the other man, who never once suspected that such a spy had his eye on him. Put- ting this and that together, I guessed that the tall man was the Duke of Uphorn, and that his kinsman was trying to frustrate his marriage, in order to turn the tide of the Duke's wealth into his own pocket. "I say I put this and that together. Let me add, that I was correct-no matter how I found it out. "The sons of Count Bertrand used also to visit at the house of Madame Gallahaut. Her daughter Gertrude was ex- quisitely beautiful. But I saw where her heart was--I saw where her heart was. r   DREAMS WITHN DREAMS.        461 ,' One night I could not sleep. I walked to the window. It was a fine, moonlight night. As I looked out, 1 saw Joseph creeping along like a cat. I cannot tell you why, but the thought came into my head to follow him. I did so, and saw him enter the house of Margaret and Catherine Halles. "Margaret was not there, I knew, for she had gone down to Villaburg about taking care of a house, or something of the kind. I believe she refused it then, but afterward accepted it. So Catherine was alone. "I crept to the window, and looked in. The night was so still, I could overhear every word they said. The fire was shin- ing brightly, and they had no candle. I can see both of them now. She was on a chair, bending over the fire, as if she was cold. He .was standing with his back to it, looking down at her with his green eyes, as' they conversed. "It is a cruel deed,' he said, keenly watching her as he spoke. "' Ay,' replied Catherine; 'cruelty against cruelty. I was her maid once. She made me feel the weight of her power I should like her to feel the strength of mine.' "'You will do it, then? ' he said. "'I will,' answered Catherine. 'I require no money. The revenge will pay me. Keep your gold back. No blood-money shall cross my palm.' "' How will you accomplish it? ' he asked. "' I keep my own secret,' she replied. "'And if a child is born?' he suggested. "'Listen,' she returned. 'Vengeance goes not beyond the mother. Touch the child, and you touch me. -I know your object. I swear to you, if it lives, the child shall be lost for- ever-so lost, that it will never be found. I swear it, because I know you; because I know its life would never be safe, if not walled in by the brand of poverty and illegitimacy. And if the mother lived, she would only breathe to bring mure chil- dren into the world for you to murder. I pity her so far, at least. I spare you so far, at least.' "' Well, we understand each other, I see,' he said. 'I leave-all to you.' "a Seeing that he was about to leave, I crouched behind a bush, and saw him come out and rapidly walk away. I looked in. The woman was still bending over the fire.. I stole away unperceived, and reached home. "I did not fully understand what they were conspiring, but    <pb n="462-463" xml:id="VAC6560-00000240"/> I had heard enough to make me very anxious. Gertrude and her mother had strangely disappeared six months before, just about the time the Count's eldest son died. I confided to Father Wilfrid all I had seen. He was very much moved, and set immediately to work to discover thie truth. Both Catherine and her sister had also disappeared. Their house was found empty the day after I heard Joseph and Catherine's conversa- tion. "I had done all I could. The thing was in wiser hands, and I went about my business as before. About a week after- ward, Father Wilfrid called me, and told me Gertrude had died in childbed, and, as far as he could ascertain, the child (a little girD was well. "I nearly fainted. ' The mother has been cruelly ihur- dered,' I gasped. ' Leave her murderers to God,' he replied. 'There is a vigorous search made for them, and they will be found when it is His will.' "They never were found. At least, I never heard they were. And now they tell me this child, bearing the dead woman's name, is supposed to be her child. If what I have told you is of any use, for God's sake, delay not!" "My good friend," replied Claude, " it is of such im- portance, that I, who have just come from the castle, mean to return at once."                - And, so saying, he hastily bade her u good day," and re- turned to the castle, where he had a private conversation with Piquemont on the subject. Meanwhile, the Count, who had suggested lunch, and my lord Clodolphus, who approved of the idea, and Prytanis, who was not averse to the same, went down stairs, for the purpose of inducing the rest to follow suit. The ladies, however, de- clared they were not hungry. But the gentlemen all applauded the motion, and it was unanimously carried by the male popu- lation of Castle Bertrand. "By Jove, how it rains!" said the Count, when they were all seated. "Come, Clodolphus; let us drive away the blues with a little sensible talk. Leave Julius Caesar alone for once, as a personal- favor to me." "Very well," replied my lord Clodolphus.   "Let us change the topic, and talk of dog kennels or beer barrels." "A beer barrel," remarked Clovis, "makes a very good dog house." "So it does," replied my lord Clodolphus. "Don't it, Count?"    DXEAMS WITHN DREAMS.        463 ' You go to the devil!" quoth the Count, gruffly. "By the by, talking of dogs," said Godfroy, " how do you like Bingo and Heliogabalus?" "Very well," said the Count, shortly, for he wanted to change the topic. 4 And talking of Bingo and Heliogabalus," remarked Pry- tanis, taking a huge bite of bread, who collected that library up stairs?"       * "One subject suggests the other very naturally, don t it?" quoth my lord Clodolphus. "Verily, you remind me of a verse I heard in my childhood: "' The gentle girl shed bitter tears Upon the woful tomb which spoke Of joys deceased, and happier years, And Hercules did serpents choke.' It was written by a lunatic. Observe the peculiar manner in which the fourth line is logically drawn from the three pre- ceding ones. Just so have the two dogs led your mathematical brain to consider books." "My books," said the Count, "are at anybody's disposal. If it was not for a deplorable weakness of Clovis's, I should have burned them up long ago. But he says he wants them; so there they are." "Burn up your books!" exclaimed my lord Clodolphus, aghast. "Why, man! do you know all they contain?" "No; and, what is more, I don't want to," replied the - Count. "And you need not begin to tell me, either. They have not done you much good, that's certain." "I did not mean," quoth my lord Clodolphus, " to attempt any such thing. I wish you would not flare up so prodigiously on the slightest notice. I meant, do you know their value? Why, man! if you are so thick skulled as not to appreciate them, there are plenty of others who can. The idea of burn. ing up such books! I would as soon think of burning up my grandmother." "Sooner, I think," replied the Count. "But let us exam- ine the thing. Here is a lot of trash. You comb your hair, I believe?" "I do," quoth my lord Clodolphus. "Very well," continued the Count. "And you clean it sometimes, I suppose?" ' I do," quoth my lord Clodolphus. "Very well," quoth the Count; "I do the same with my    <pb n="464-465" xml:id="VAC6560-00000241"/> "4       DREMrS wrrIT  DREAMS. house. If there is a litter in it, I sweep it out. If there is soot in the chimney, I have it poked down. You would not leave the soot in your chimney, I presume?" "I would not," quoth my lord Clodolphus. Vtery well," said the Count. "Here is a litter of books. What do I do? Why, sweep them away, of course." Here my lord Clodolphus suggested that the Count was begging the question, as all hinged on whether his books were trash, or not. "Pooh! pooh!" cried the Count; "that has nothing to do with it. Of course they are trash. Now you admitted, just a moment ago, you would sweep trash away. Therefore you are defeated, for that includes my books. You see," con- tinued the Count, benignantly, " how soon we set things straight when we leave Julius Caesar alone. Let me have plain sailing, and I will overhaul you in a trice. That is why I always object to your Latin and Greek. You can hide behind them, and escape me, when I get you in a corner. Otherwise I would defeat you in every argument." Thus they went on talking in their usual way, until Gabriel came in, and whispered something in the ear of my lord Clo- dolphus. Excusing himself to the company, he rose, left the room, and repaired to the library, where he found Claude and Piquemont. The story of Dame Sewell was then told him, and his opinion asked. My lord Clodolphus listened attentively. When Claude had finished, he replied, gravely: "It is a very terrible tale. Morally speaking, there is great cause for suspicion. But I fear there is not sufficient evidence to convict the guilty, if they indeed are guilty. What did the woman hear? Two people planning murder. Suppose we even prove this Catherine was once the maid of Gertrude Galla- haut, and that she was her nurse when she died-what then? She may have intended to kill her, and repented afterward. Or she may have only said what she did, to throw La Chambre off the scent. Verily have we no proof of the last act. No, no. I do not think we have sufficient to convict either. Cir- cumstantial evidence must be a perfect chain, or in common justice must be neglected. Any doubt is in the criminal's favor. I am afraid the number of years which have passed since then, will make the story more difficult of proof. The silence of Father Wilfrid was justified by his priestly charac- ter; but what shall we say to the silence of Dame Sewell? I   DREAMS WITHN DREAMS.        465 think we had best leave the matter alone until we find more evidence, if more can be found." "But the Duke, at least, should be made acquainted with it," said Claude. "I think not," replied my lord Clodolphus. "The story is either false or true. If false, it would be very unkind to give him such an unnecessary shock. If true, it may never be proved; and then, why pain him with the sad disclosure? If it can be proved, it will be time enough, when we have the whole evidence before us, to consider what we shall do." "And what would you advise for the present?" asked Piquemont. "I hardly know," replied my lord Clodolphus.  "The woman is- dead; the nurse has not been heard of for many years-unless she and the woman who took care of little Ger- trude prove one and the same person. As to La Chambre, we know where he is to be found, and have him always at hand. He evidently never suspects Dame Sewell. If no better thing can be thought of, let us find out all we can, and do the best we can. I have a great faith, myself, in the old saying, thst 'murder will out.' But I shall be better prepared to give ad- vice after I have thought a little more. How did the good Jacoponus reply, on a certain occasion, when asked why he wept? ' Quia amor non amaretur'-- Because love is not loved. We are bad enough ourselves, without wishing to make others worse than they are. I, indeed, have composed a hexameter on this, which has puzzled some of myprosodical acquaintances. It runs thus: Amor amarus amentibus animis heu! est mundi; and means, Love, alas! is bitter to the crazed minds of the world. It reminds me of Persius." Very much," remarked Piquemont, who was evidently not very attentive to the last part of my lord Clodolphus's speech, and was plainly thinking about something else. He now turned to my lord Clodolphus, and, laying his hand upon his knee, said: "A still more important thing than this must now engage our attention. I wish you to concentrate all your mind upon it, and do so as a sacred duty. It must not be lis- tened to without attention, nor decided upon too hastily. Your strong sense and kind heart point you out as the one to whom I would naturally come-" 20*    <pb n="466-467" xml:id="VAC6560-00000242"/> "6    \  DREAMS WITHN DREAMS. Here Piquemont was interrupted by the Count, who came dancing into the room in a kind of frenzy. "What do you think!" he cried. "I saw it with my own eyes. That fiend Heliogabalus has been sucking my eggs." "Sucking your eggs?" said my lord Clodolphus. "What can you mean?" "Mean!" cried the Count. "Why, my coops were open, and that dreadful dog, who was prowling round, looking for prey, actually broke into my henbuds, as I call them, and sucked them dry. Oh! where shall I find a gun big enough to shoot him with?" And the Count actually danced out of the room. ' Well," thought Piquemont, "we have come cheaply through this interruption;" when the Count danced in again. "And he has killed a hen! He has actually killed a hen!" And he danced out again. Piquemont threw himself back in his chair, and looked mournfully at the door. If he anticipated the Count's return, the anticipation was correct; for, in less than a minute, the Count danced in again. "Oh! come down, Piquemont, and see the terrible catas- trophe!" he cried. Piquemont whispered to my lord Clodolphus that he would be back soon, and accompanied the Count with Christian resig- nation. Claude and my lord Clodolphus remained silent for a mo- ment after their departure, and then both with one accord burst into a long, hearty laugh. But neither said anything on the subject, and neither asked the other what he was laughing at. At this moment Gabriel came in, and said that Ernest To- servem was down stairs, asking for the Count. "I told him," said Gabriel, "that the Count was engaged, and asked him if he could wait? He said 'no,' and asked who was in the house? I told him. He then said my lord Clodolphus, or Sir Claude, would do." "Show him up, then, " quoth my lord Clodolphus. "We are both here, and no time is like the present." Gabriel left them. In a little while he returned with the innkeeper. Ernest bowed, and remained standing by the door. ".Take a seat, friend," said my lord Clodolphus. "How is the world going with you?"   DREAMS WrrITIN DREAMS.       467 "Tolerable, thank you," replied Ernest. "People, I find, generally drink more on wet days than on dry ones." ' I always thought the contrary," said my lord Clodolphus. "So do most folks," answered Ernest. "Most folks know most about what they don't know nothing of." This philosophical remark seemed to have a deep satirical meaning known only to Toservem, who sat chuckling on the edge of his chair, as if the sentiment pleased him mightily. "There's a man at our place called Ebenezer," he contin- ued. "You see him yesterday. Lord! a'n't he a fellow for talk! To hear him speak, you would think a chattering devil possessed him. Says he to me, the other day, says he, ' Toser- vem,' says he, 'why don't you mix them two kinds of wine together? Your customers,' says he, ' would never know the difference; and, by selling the two kinds at the highest price, you would realize considerable.' 'Why, you little withered heap of rattling bones,' says I, ' did you ever hear tell of such a thing as a conscience? I am blowed,' says I, 'if I don't think you would a heap rather tell-a lie than the truth, any day of the week. Besides, do you suppose,' says I, 'everybody is as big a fool as yourself? Nobody with a palate, but would find it out at once.' " "Properly remarked," quoth my lord Clodolphus. "And what said he to that?"' "Oh! I don't know," replied Ernest. "I never listen much to what them kind of chaps say. It's in one ear, and out the other." "Verily have you hit the nail on its head," quoth my lord dodolphus. "The true philosopher lets the world talk, as we do babes, and heeds it about as much." "I don't know much about philosophers," said Ernest. "I don't pretend to be anything in that line myself. My way of treating them kind of fellows is, just to take no notice of them, unless they kick up a row; and then I chucks them out of the window." "Now," quoth my lord Clodolphus, "is this verily what you came to tell us?" "Not exactly," replied Toservem. "I camne up to give the Count this note, which reached me this morning. I don't unl- derstand it, and I thought some of you might be interested; as you are all, I hear, up to some game or another." My lord Clodolphus took the note, and Ernest loft. We transcribe one sentence in it:    <pb n="468-469" xml:id="VAC6560-00000243"/> "Let some man who knows the ins and outs of the forest, be on the watch continually until the child is restored to her--." The handwriting was that of La Cliambre. CHAPTER XLVI. RELATING HOW ALBERT AND HS COMPANION HAD AN IMPORTANT CONFERENCE; AND HOW LA CHAMBRE GAVE HM A LESSON IN MAGIC. WE must now let a few days pass; for, as I approach the end of my narrative, there is a busy spirit which htrries me on. I would fain linger on the innocent amusements and pleas- ant peculiarities of our dear friends; but it is growing late, and the curtain must soon fall. Let us, then, transport ourselves to the subterranean chambers of the ruin, where Albert and a person not totally unknown to us are in earnest conversation. The companion of Albert was a stern, haughty man, whose eye occasionally shot a fire like the red glare of embers. It was the man, indeed, who wounded Ubald in the forest, and whom Albert had engaged to carry little Gertrude away. "' She will be at the cottage of a young girl called Cecilia, to-morrow," said Albert. "We will proceed together. I will manage to bring Cecilia and the child here. I want you to be in readiness to assist me, in case any man follows. Whether we have to fight for it or not, your reward will be the same." "Hearken!" replied the other, sullenly. "Furnish me with enough to leave this place, and I will do what you please." "You feel your danger, then?" said Albert. "I do," answered his companion; with an oath. "I must leave this country. It is too hot for me. They begin to call my duels murder. I cannot remain here safely." "I suppose you know," continued Albert, quietly, "that when this thing has once been done, you will have a hold upon me?" "What is that to the purpose?" "A great deal to the purpose, friend. You might choose to make money, by betraying me; or you might choose to J   DIjEAIIS WITIIN DREAMS.      46 threaten me, in the hopes of drawing from time to time on my fears. Now I do not say you intend to do so. I only sug- gest you might." Continue," said the man, nodding his head. "Now, my good friend," continued Albert, calmly, "it is but fair that we should treat on equal terms. We must have each other equally in the power of each. So I inform you that I have long known what happened to that old man, who was found dead in his bed the night you slept in his house." The man sprang to his feet. "Tush " continued Albert. "Cannot you see that I do not want to betray you? Could I not have told the tale twenty times, if I chose? Sit down. That is better. I merely wished you to see that there is no use of yourtrying any such worn. out tricks with me. I never spoke to living soul of what I knew, and I never shall, unless you force me to do so by be- traying me. When the child is once stolen, I shall be equally in your power. Like wise men, we will both hold our tongues. I will have the child, and you the gold. I then will not dare to inform against you, lest you should betray me; and you will not dare divulge my secret, lest I put, in return, a halter round your neck. So, things being square between us, we can pro. ceed to our little undertaking with clear consciences and mutual trust-not to say esteem." "Ha!" hissed the other. "Mark me well. As sure as there is a power in man, you had better now put your plan into execution, or you will regret it." And, with this, he walked to the door, and, turning the key in the lock, drew it out and tossed it on the top of a high wardrobe. ' What are you going to do?" "You will see." "I am unarmed." "So much the better." "I do not understand you." :'I know you do. You have measured strength with me. You have dared speak to me as if you held me under your foot. Do you not guess the consequences?" "Will you murder me?" "That depends. I have not made up my mind. Stay; I will give you one chance. There are pens and paper on the table. Sit down, and write a full confession of your having murdered that old man, and then go where you please."    <pb n="470-471" xml:id="VAC6560-00000244"/> 470       DREAS VITHN DREAMS. Albert's eyes glistened, for he knew the worthlessness of such a confession, as he could easily prove an alibi. But he was a perfect actor. Feigning fear, he drew up to the table. "I must do," he said, "as you require. Will you, in re- turn, aid me in my purpose?" I will," replied the other. "But write that paper first. The priests tell me man cannot help himself when God is against lim. I, who have opposed Heaven all my life, have no fear of trying the issue with God." Albert continued writing for about five minutes; at the end of which time he turned toward his companion, and said, "Let me read you the paper." And he read as follows: "I, Albert D'Esterre, do confess that on the night of the -- day of -, in the year of grace --, I did deprive a certain person, named --, of life, in the following manner, to wit." "Will that. do for a beginning?" asked Albert. The other does not reply. Albert looks up more atten- tively than before. There is a fire in the room, beside which the man is sitting. His eyes are fixed on Albert. What can there be so remarkable in those eyes, that makes Albert start up as if a thunderbolt had fallen beside him, and nish frantic- ally to the other end of the room? What makes him seize the locked door, and shake it in an agony of terror, and scream, like one possessed, to be let out? What terrible thing stares out of those two eyes, which affects him in so frightful a way? He had no fear of trying the issue with God. Those were the last words Albert had heard him utter. And now he was sitting composedly in the armchair, looking at the seat which Albert had just left. Why should Albert tremble so, and look at his late companion as. if he were a basilisk? They had lately conversed together very calmly. Why should Albert then turn so white, and tremble so?  He had no fear of trying the issue with God. In that chair, with this terrible blasphemy on his lips; in that chair, with the knowledge that all the blood he had shed was calling to heaven for revenge; in that chair, with every bad passion raging in his soul; with no feeling of compunction for what he had done; with a fierce defiance of all that is true, and good, and sacred; in that chair he had expired, and in that chair he sat dead, his two eyes staring at Albert with a fixed, glassy, horrible look, enough to appal the stoutest heart. A few hours afterward, Albert and La Chambre were to-   DPREAMS IrrHN DREAMS.      471 gether in another room. Albert was lying on a sofa, pale and exhausted. His companion was near him. La Chambre had found Albert lying unconscious beside a door, which had been beaten off its hinges. A few questions now explained the whole occurrence. La Chambre seemed to look upon it as he would have looked upon the death of an ox or a horse. "We must bury him," he said; "and the shortest means of getting rid of him are the oubliettes, which are luckily in the very next apartment. So much for that. How do you feel now?" "Much better," said Albert. "Your restorative works miracles." "Not quite," replied the other, dryly. "If you want to see a miracle, you must not come here. But I can show you something almost as good. Come; you will recover in a few minutes. Suppose, meanwhile, I amuse you a little." With these words, he went to a cabinet, took out a curi- ously shaped box, and opened it. From the box he drew a small earthen pot filled with mould, and a paper bag. He then replaced the box, and returned to his seat by Albert. "In the art I practise," said he, "we have a very pretty experiment for beginners. You see the seed I take out of this paper bag? Very well. Here is a pot of mould. I plant the seed. Now watch." Albert looked on with interest. In about a minute and a half he saw two shoots springing up. These grew thicker and thicker; leaves appeared, then buds, then blossoms, then fruit. "Pretty, is it not?" said La Chambre. "Pretty!" replied Albert. "How the devil do you do it?" "I could show you better things than that," replied La Chambre. "But I will give you a hint, which you can work out at your leisure. Look at it. What does it appear to be?" "An orange tree, with ripe fruit." "Good. Can you smell the fruit? Try, but do not touch them." "Certainly I can." "Now pluck one off the tree." Albert tried to do so. As a bubble disappears the moment we lay hold of it, so the whole vanished, as Albert tried to touch it. Albert looked at La Chambre in utter amazement. La Chambre burst out laughing.    <pb n="472-473" xml:id="VAC6560-00000245"/> 472       DREAMS WITHN DREAMS. "So you never heard," he said, "of accidents without any tangible substance?" "Explain yourself," replied Albert. "My dear young friend," continued La Chambre, " chem. istry unfolds, every day, stranger and stranger secrets. The world, in its wise ignorance, can never distinguish between the workman and the tool, unless in matters which have been slowly hammered into its knowledge by the slow process of ages. People are continually called wizards, who are only in advance of their age. Bah! Magic is a plant of quite an- other growth. Take this experiment, for instance. It is only a chemical illusion-a phantom. The seed contains the future tree. You can raise the spectrum, as it were, of what is in the  seed, magnified to suit your convenience. Some, I dare say, cleverer than I, may make it sensible to feeling as to sight. I have only advanced as far as perfume. But it is all delusion. You can always distinguish these wonders from miracles, by the end for which they are wrought. God never sends a miracle without a purpose. It either cures the sick, or testifies to a prophet, or reveals something. It never is permitted merely to amuse idle people. In this class of illusions you must place ghosts generally, haunted houses, and the like. It is all nonsense to call this magic. It is science, used for a good or bad purpose, as the case may be. I once frightened quite a whole village, by appearing in, I forget how many places at once, and playing dead at last. They buried me, too." Here La Chambre burst out laughing. "Are you not mocking me?" asked Albert. "No, really," replied La Chambre. "Nothing is easier than to raise optical illusions; and chemists would do it oftener, only they are afraid the devil is at the bottom; or else they fear the stake." "You speak of magic as distinct from  all this," said Albert. "So it is," returned La Chambre. "In the midst of my scientific studies, I found myself occasionally brought in con- tact with an intelligence not my own. I supposed, at first, some one was playing tricks with me, as I had done with oth- ers. But bah I no man can read thoughts; and this mysteri- ous intelligence used to converse with me, and answer my questions before I put them. I then found I had powers I never suspected before.

There was your old friend, Clovis Bertrand. His will would subdue mine as easily as I can subdue a cur. Let a person be pureminded, and I can no more catch a hold on him, than climb a perfectly slippery rock." "I cannot believe all this," said Albert, "without some proof." "And what proof would you have?" "I would converse with this intelligence concerning my own future." "Then you shall. Lie still. Do not be alarmed at any. thing you see. If you think what will appear is only an opti- cal illusion, you will be convinced otherwise; for you shall con- verse soul to soul with one who is hidden beneath strange forms. I shall not use any apparatus or jugglery; but I must veil my face; for, when he comes, only one can see him at a time. Are you ready?" "Yes." "Lie still. Look to the north. What do you see?" "Only the room, as it was before." "What is there in the south?" "Nothing but the wall and furniture."  "Look to the east. Is there anything there?" "Nothing but what I have seen before." "Turn your eyes to the west,'then. I thought as much. He generally comes from there. Look at everything. Let not the slightest object escape your gaze."' "I see the wall, and a spider crawling out of a hole. It is of a monstrous size, black, and covered widi hair." "Watch it, and tell me what it does." "It has begun spinning its web right across the ceiling over my head. Now it runs down the. wall, spinning out its web as it goes along. It has reached the floor, still spinning. It seems to be winding me up in its net; for it crosses, and ascends the opposite wall, and continues dragging its web round and round me." "Now close your eyes." "Is not this one of your delusions?" "You will see. Ask, now, what you will. But first open your eyes again." Albert opened them. His companion was gone. The ter- rible invisible thing which seemed to dog his footsteps, always behind his back looking over him, appeared to be near. Albert    <pb n="474-475" xml:id="VAC6560-00000246"/> 474      DREA1MS WITHN DREAMS. felt it, although he did not see it. He tried to raise himself, but could not move. Determined to break the spell, he cried, "Is any one here?" Something like a dim vapor passed before his eyes. "Is this a spirit?" he thought; and, as he thought of the que s. tion, he distinctly heard a voice, which sounded as if it came from some deep cavern thousands of feet below the surface of the earth, answering, "It is not." ' Startled by so apt a reply, Albert determined to pursue the investigation. The following series of questions and answers were propounded and answered in the same way-mentally on the part of Albert, audibly on that of the voice: "Are you a spirit?" "I am." "What was it I just saw?" "An illusion." "For what purpose?  "A pure spirit takes accidents to attract the eyes and other senses of men." "Will you tell me the truth, if I ask it?" "I will." "Am I in any danger?" "In great danger." ' From what?" "From yourself." "How from myself?" "You lose courage too easily. Fear will prove your death, if you do not take care, and resist it." t And, if I should die, what would happen to me? Would I go to heaven?" "There is no such place as heaven, purgatory, or hell." a Explain your meaning." "All men are creatures of God. God is essentially good. Therefore He creates nothing for eternal pain. Consequently there is no hell. Man is not answerable for what has been pre- destined he should do from the beginning. Consequently there  is no purgatory. Man cannot merit. Consequently there can be no heaven." "Is death, then, annihilation?" "Death is not annihilation." "What is it?                      ]? "Progression." "I do not understand you."   DREAXMS WITHN DREAMS.        475- "Possibly not. The thing is new to you. Death, then, is a physical fact; nothing less, nothing more. The eternal body undergoes a change. From the old chrysalis, a more sublime body arises; a body which the senses cannot perceive, yet still a body. The soul inhabits it, and departs with it. Whatever virtues the soul had before death, it possesses afterward. What- ever vices stained it before, cling to it afterward. It is essen- tially the same soul, in what may be called a body emanating from the old body." "Is this new body part of the old?" "It arises from it, as perfume rises from a flower " "Is this new body eternal?" "No. As the body of an infant commences to throw off ,old atoms and receive new ones from the moment of its birth; so, from the moment of death, the new body does the same." "' Does the new body die?" "a When the soul attains a certain degree of perfection or degradation, yes." "How degradation?" ' Man is a progressing spirit, but he can retrograde if he chooses. So far free will is allotted him, and hence the origin of sin and pain. But he must progress, in the nature of things--end, at last, by discovering the true utility of virtue. So, whether advancing or retrograding, he continues to die, time after time, until he reaches that perfection where he be- comes immortal." "Do we ever return to live in the same sphere?" "Never." "Could a man reach   the immortal condition on this earth?" "Why not?  Disease is- the consequence of not taking care of ourselves, which is one of the fruits of ignorance. Ignorance springs from a want of virtue. He who is truly virtuous, is like a god, knowing good and evil; knowing how to choose the good, and reject the evil. Hence a man might so advance in knowledge even on the earth, as to live there forever, and happy." "' What of accidents?" "No accident can happen to him who knows everything, and can prevent it." "Can you tell me more?" "Is not all summed up in the one sentence, 'You shall be as gods, knowing good and evil?"    <pb n="476-477" xml:id="VAC6560-00000247"/> * 90      DUREAMS WlilTHN DUI;1AMS. "But is not this what we are told the serpent said to Eve in Eden?" "I told you there was no such thing as hell, and therefore no such things as devils. The saying is truth, in whatever mouth it is put." "And what guaranty do you give me of the truth of what you say?" "This present revelation. You know that no living man is speaking to you; for what living man can read thought?" "Were you ever alive?" "In your sense, I was. In mine, I am still so." "Have you ever spoken before?" "Yes; in the ancient oracles." "Why have the oracles become silent?" It was God's will.?' "Why?" "God never gives reasons. He wills, and we must obey, and tremble." "Can you tell me whether I shall soon die?" "I can, but may not. You will know soon.  Another spirit only has the power to tell this. Think on what I have told you.. I will be with you once more." Albert, in the same manner, asked one or two questions, but no reply came. He felt the spell was gone. He jumped upon his feet, passed out of the room, and went in search of La Chambre. He found him in the hall. La Chambre asked no questions, but quietly informed him, as if nothing had hap. pened, that he was now going to his laboratory, and would be happy to have his company. He led the way along a very long passage, until he came to a large iron door, which he opened, and Albert followed him into a large circular chamber, which seemed to be the foundation of some tower. In the middle of the room was a tremendous furnace. The fire in it was raging and roaring with a violence that was really startling. Crucibles, mortars, strange implements of many de- scriptions, were arranged round the room in an orderly manner. Bottles of many different-colored liquors, shallow pans filled with powders, loadstones of prodigious power, crystals of great magnitude, astrological tools, charts of the heavens, and many other objects of alchemy, chemistry, astronomy, and divination, some on shelves, some on tables, some in open drawers, some in cabinets, here and there and everywhere greeted the eye in all directions: A strong and somewhat disagreeable odor filled 9   DREAMB  WITHN DREAS.       4" he room; but Albert soon became accustomed to it, and forgot ;s existence. "What do you think of my study?" asked La Chambre. "I like it very much," replied Albert; "but one thing uzzles me. Where does the smoke go to? "Ah," said La Chambre, "that is my secret.  Smoke rould betray me, and so I consume it." "But so great a heat might set the ceiling on fire," returned lbert. "So it might," replied La Chambre. "Come; I will show ou something which is no illusion, and which, if I displayed ,the public, would speedily promote me to the stake. Such the world. Do you see this?" e continued, taking a white- )t vessel out of the furnace with a curiously shaped pair of ngs. "Would you say this was a good thing to keep ice in, you did not want it to melt?"  "Assuredly I would not," replied Albert. "Now look!" said La Chambre. "See! I throw a liquid to it. See! it freezes. Nay, let me take it out. Hold it in ,ur hand. There is no delusion in that, is there?" "No, indeed," said Albert, examining a mass of ice as rge as an ordinary hailstone, which had frozen in a white-hot ,se. "Ha! ha!" laughed La Chambre.

TELLING HOW LA CHAMBRE AND ALBERT VISITED THE TWO WICKED TOWERS; HOW ALBERT VISITED THE PROFESSOR, AND WHAT CAME OF IT. "A CHAMBRE led Albert up a flight of stone steps to the room above. "This," he said, " is the first story of the tower that peasants call The Youth. The other is called The Lady. It is supposed that the lover was buried underneath this one, and his mistress underneath the other. My furnace is built over the very spot indicated as the grave of the peasant boy. In this room, Cyrillus and his father had their celebrated inter. view. Come on." When he reached the next floor, he led Albert out of a window to a kind of balcony. "Here," said he, " a sentinel used to be placed. It was from this spot the man was hurled. He fell down in the ditch there, and was drowned. There is another legend attached to this room. Nicholas Occa, known under the title of Nicholas the Devil, is said to have hung ore of his prisoners here by the feet, to have then locked the room, and not opened it for a year and a day. A nice set of ances- tors I have to be proud of. You remember? Yes, I am an Occa, of the same name and blood as the Uphorn. Come on." And he led the way thus from story to story, until they reached the summit of the tower. As they emerged on the roof, again that terrible feeling of undefined horror chilled Albert's heart. But it passed away instantaneously. "This will be a good place," he said, " to hide the little girl La Chlambre looked at him with a glanice of intense dislike "Have you no compunction," he said, "after the retribution which fell upon your companion?" "None," said Albert, shortly. "Well, well," muttered La Chambre. There was a rough kind of bridge leading from one tower to the other, formed by a large beam' reaching over the preci- pice between them. The towers, as we have said before, were two hundred feet high, and only three yards apart. They had formerly been connected halfway up by a stone bridge, like the one which connects the two steeples of the church of Boppart   DREMAIS WITHN DREAMS.       479 on the Rhine. A part of the arches alone remained, the rest having fallen. Altogether, the towers themselves threatened soon to give way, and follow the bridge; and it was no slight tax on the nerves to stand on so treacherous a foundation, look- ing down from so tremendous a height. "That beam," said La Chambre, pointing to it, "was put there by an adventurous man, who swore he would explore the other tower. The upper rooms are comparatively strong, but the lower have fallen, so that you cannot reach the higher part of the Lady's Tower any other way. On that beam he actu- ally had the foolhardiness to walk and had nearly reached the other side, when he trod on a rusty nail. The unexpected pain made him start. He reeled, fell, and caught hold of the beam just in time to save his life. For a few minutes he lay ex- tended on it, with his face downward, and clinging to the beam as a drowning man clutches a rope. Shutting his eyes, and moving inch by inch, he managed to get safely back. Since then no one has attempted the feat, and nobody has removed the beam." "I should think nothing of crossing it," said Albert. "It only requires a steady foot and a clear head." "Doubtless," replied La Chambre. "Add 'a good rea- son and I will agree with you. But rashness was never cour- age." So conversing, they visited all the ruins. Every now and then La Chambre, who, for some purpose of his own, always came back to the subject, would ask Albert if he had not changed his mind respecting little Gertrude? To this, Albert would always answer " no. Whereat his companion would turn a dark eye on him, and mutter, "Well, well." Albert paid little attention to this. To be once determined witi bim, meant inexorably to pursue that determination, at whatever hazard, under whatever risk. The day after this occurred, the Professor received a letter in imating that, if he would bring the child to Cecilia's cottage, a person would meet him there, and, after looking at certain marks on the child, would give him satisfactory proof of her parentage. The writer, it continued, could not for many rea- sons come to the castle. He had chosen Cecilia's cottage, and daytime, to avert any suspicion from the Professor's mind, as he could go and return under escort of the Count's people, who were continually coming and going from the castle. It con- I.    <pb n="480-481" xml:id="VAC6560-00000249"/> 4OU      DRtLDEAMS WITH-I DREAMS. eluded by enjoining secrecy, and promising to give the Profes- sor the fullest satisfaction in the coming personal interview. Now the old man knew very little of the world; and, be- lieving fully all the assurances contained in the letter, proposed to the Count to let the child visit her old friend Cecilia. The Count, who never looked an inch beyond his nose, consenting, and the child being, of course, delighted, off they started. The two arrived safely at Cecilia's cottage, where she was delighted to see them. About half an hour afterward, Albert entered, to the great astonishment of the Professor. "You must be surprised to see me," said Albert; " but I have come for a very different purpose than the one which moved me in our last interview. Let me begin by confessing to you, that I sinfully tried to deceive you. I wish to do this even before I put into your hands the important papers I pos- sess." We have said before, Albert was a perfect actor. He ap- peared now so humble, so contrite, so ashamed of what he had done, that the simple, tender-hearted old man was touched. "Surely," said he, " are we all sinful; and the most we can do, my friend, is honestly to confess and earnestly to amend our wicked ways. If we would only exercise ourselves more in studying ourselves, and learn the futility of trying to do any good without the grace of God. we would first gain peace of mind, then learn to overcome temptation, and so win praise instead of losing it. By honestly confessing your wrong, you have raised yourself more in my esteem, than you lost in my opinion by your falsehood." Albert bowed meekly, with inward rage in his heart. "Falsehood!" he thought. "Ay, you may give me the lie now, old man; but the end has not come yet." .Then he added, aloud: "You are truly too good to me. I deserve worse. Do you mind taking a turn up and down the road with me? The child will be safe and happy here." '"Oh! yes," said Cecilia. "Leave Gertrude with me, and go talk over your business alone." The Professor and Albert therefore left the cottage. Pro- ducing a. packet of papers-which we need hardly say were forged-Albert managed, by giving them one after the other to the old man, to draw his attention away from the direction they were taking, by confining him to the documents. Thus, by little and little, Albert drew him into the forest. "Really, friend," said the Professor, when they had reached   DREAMS WITtIlN DREAMS.       481 a secluded spot, "I do not think these papers are worth any- thing. They seem to me to be forgeries;" "Indeed!" replied Albert, sneering. "Yes," continued the Professor; "you have evidently been imposed upon, or are trying to impose upon me. This confes- sion, for instance, is a transparent falsehood. It speaks of Ger- trude Gallahaut as being married to Charles Bertrand privately, just three days after his death. The date has evidently been carelessly written. No, no. I cannot say-" "Enough of this trifling!" interrupted Albert, roughly laying his hand on the old man's collar, as tlree men came up. "Here! gag him." And, before the Professor could even utter a cry, he found himself bound, gagged, and borne on the shoulders of the men through the forest. Cecilia, meanwhile, finding the Professor did not return, set herself to work to amuse the child-a not very difficult task. In the middle of her efforts, Albert came in with a pretended message from the old man, stating that he had business, but that Cecilia should take the child, and accompany him (Albert) to the castle, going by the old ruin, where the Professor would join them, if he could. Suspecting nothing, Cecilia joyfully consented, for nothing pleased her more than the walk. And so the three started through the woods together. We must now return to the old man. His captors blind- folded him when they had proceeded a certain distance in the woods, and he felt himself carried, now up hill, now down, and at last into some building. The gag was then removed, and he was unbound. He heard his companions walk away. He tore the covering from his face, and looked round. He was in a room evidently once a prison. From its cir- cular appearance, he judged he was in a tower. The window was small, and very high up, and there was no means of reach- ing it. I said, from its circular appearance;" but I made use of an incorrect expression. The room was a section only of a circle, shaped somewhat like a quadrant, being, broad and concave on the side where the window was placed, and gradu- ally coming to a point at the opposite side. A bench, or rather a stone roughly hewed into the shape of a seat, was on one side. To this bench a large iron ring had been fastened, from  which hung the rusty fragments of a heavy chain; used, pos-    <pb n="482-483" xml:id="VAC6560-00000250"/> 482      DREAMS WITHN DREAMS. sibly, in old times as an additional means of securing the pris. oner. But it was not the uncertainty of his own position, nor the nature of his present imprisonment, nor the anxiety as to how this adventure would end, which tore at the heart of the good old man. It was the child he thought of; the child, whom he had loved from the first; the child, who seemed surrounded by mystery; the child, who was so carefully guarded by her friends, and so earnestly sought by her enemies; who was now, perhaps, in danger. Never for one instant did the old man think of himself. It was always Gertrude. If he looked upon his prison, it was to think why, as the girl's guardian, he had been removed so roughly away from her. If he thought of Albert's treachery, it was to ponder on the motives of the young man, and to ask why he pursued the child with so much perseverance, and at the cost of so much falsehood. Never once did he spare a moment's thought on his own unhappy condition. He was a gaunt, awkward-looking man. He had nothing about his personal appearance in any way prepossessing, if judged by the standard of beauty. But there was a tender, melancholy love in his eyes, which spoke of Christian perfec- tion-a grace unattainable but by the humble, a charm unap- preciated but by the good. As he patiently sat on the stone bench, resigned to the will of his God, and not moved by a single selfish sorrow, Heaven knows there were very few who could fully appreciate the excellence of that poor old man. As he sat thus, the door opened, and La Chambre entered. The Professor rose to his feet, and they confronted each other. La Chambre was dressed in black from head to foot. His head was bare. From his belt hung a sword in a black scab- bard, with a hilt positively loaded with diamonds. Indeed, all his garments presented, a richness common to the period. Al- though of the sombre funereal hue of night, they were made of the richest material, and clasped with diamonds, whose value must have been immense. As he moved, the gems glittered like stars. Indeed, what with the ebon hue of his dress, and the brilliancy of the jewels, he was no unfit representative of night. Closing the door, he then turned round, and folded his arms. "Welcome," he said, "to the ancient house of the Up- horn." "May I ask," replied the other, mildly, " why I am here?"   DREAMS WITHN DREAMS.        483 "I wanted you," replied La Chambre, " and sent for you. Here I am ruler, and no other. Whoever enters here, must submit to my power, or dare it to his cost." The old man looked at him mildly. "There is something behind all this," he said. "There is," replied the other. "You have had enough misery. There has been a devil plotting mischief against you, and against those whom you love. The crowd at Castle Ber- trand are good men and wise, but they mount neither to the heights of virtue, nor plunge into the subtleties of worldly wis- dom. Hence have they neither the cunning to counteract nor the sanctity to overthrow the schemes of the initiated. Your half sinners are neither fit to cope with the world nor able to overcome the devil. Listen to me. The voice of a thousand years speaks in me. The memory of a long line of noblemen moves me. For the first time for many years have I arrayed myself as the sons of our house shoull be arrayed. The last three men of our race are soon to pass away, and the name of Uphorn shall be lost. Two of them have raised that name from the mire of crime in which its fierce possessors have plunged it. It but remains for the third to follow their exam- ple. In a few hours the daughter of our house will be here. She has a fearful foe in Albert D'Esterre; but Albert D'Esterre has a far more fearful foe in me. Make ready, for the hour is at hand." Saying this, he drew his poniard. "Can you use this?" he asked. "God is my sword," replied the old man. "Never shall my hand touch such a weapon. I can give up my own life to the slayer, but I cannot take away-the life of my brother.' "'Then the end is reserved for me," said La Chambre. "Follow me." He then strode out of the room, followed by the old Pro- fessor. Ascending a flight of steps, they emerged on the roof of the Youth's Tower. "I shall leave you here," he said. "Remain here, as you value your life, as you love little Ger- trude. She will be with you in a little while." And, so saying, he descended to the floor below. Won- dering how all this would end, the old man sat down on the parapet, and listened eagerly. In a few moments, Cecilia, half frightened to death, and holding the child in her arms, appeared. The old man uttered a joyful cry, and sprang toward them. "God be blessed 1"    <pb n="484-485" xml:id="VAC6560-00000251"/> 484:      DREAMS WITHN DREAMS. he cried; " we are safe. Cecilia, are you a courageous girl? Would you dare cross that beam?" "Yes," replied Cecilia, with that firmness which women show in the hour of danger. "Then," said the old man, "let us cross at once. I have been promised help; but we had best trust in God and our own exertions. Once in that other tower, with all communication cut off, we may remain until help comes." "Ay," answered Cecilia, softly. "It is an inspiration from God. I left word I was coming here, and told Claude to meet me. Come; let us not lose an instant." And, before the other could reply, the brave girl had crossed the stupendous height, with little Gertrude in her arms. With the courage of despair, the old man now followed her. When he had reached about halfway across, Albert ap- peared on the Youth's Tower, understood the thing at once, and, with a curse, sprang upon the beam. The Professor reached the other side safely. As his foot touched the wall, Albert struck him with his poniard. The blade entered the old man's back a little below the neck. At the same moment as the Professor fell forward on his face, Albert gave a shriek. The terrible unseen being seemed be- hind him. He turned, staggered, lost his balance, and clutched at the beam. Unable to seize it, he fell down the tremendous height upon the courtyard below, a shapeless mass. al The Professor leaped up instantly, and, exerting all his strength, pushed the beam. It fell rattling down beside the corpse of Albert. The old man then looked round wildly, and staggered. "Let me support you," said Cecilia, who knew nothing of the wound he had received, and which did not bleed at all. "Let me support you. You are old, and. the shock has over- fatigued you." N' o, no," gasped the other. "Gertrude, come here." The child ran to his embrace. Her weight was small. He had often borne her in his arms. But now he was forced to kneel and kiss her. He said nothing but "My darling-my little, little darling." You are sick," said Cecilia. "See I here is a room. Lie down, and you will be better soon. I will stay here, and watch, When Claude comes, all will be right." The old man obeyed her, and went into the next room, and patiently lay down in the coiner.   DREAMS WITHN DREAMS.        485 (W hat is he doing, Gertrude?" asked Cecilia of the child, who was looking in. "He is saying, 'Our Father,'" replied the child. CHAPTER XLV III. HOW BROTHER STANISLAUS VISITED THE CASTLE, AND HOW THE DUKE FOUND HS CHLD. AT Castle Bertrand there was more than common excite- ment; for Brother Stanislaus had arrived, a little after Ger. trude and the Professor left the house to visit Cecilia. Every. body was in a state of the wildest excitement. The Count was perfectly crazy with delight. Heliogabalus and the hens were forgotten. He could only rush round and drive the ser- vants, and impede everybody. Now he was preventing prepa- rations in the kitchen, by insisting upon things being cooked in an impossibly short time, and driving the cook to the extreme verge of insanity. Now he was in the stable, scolding at Peter, until he reduced him almost to a state of drivelling im- becility. Now he was by the old monk's side, throwing his arms round him, and testifying his reverence and affection in so boisterous a manner that he nearly upset him three tines, and then tried to make up for his awkwardness by a profusion of apologies, which nearly stunned his guest. But Brother Stanislaus did not mind it. There he sat, laughing cheerfully, and treating the Count as if he were a favorite son. It was a curious and pleasant sight to see this very old man evidently regarding another who was sixty years old as a boy, whose good spirits must be excused, if a little boisterous, on account of his extreme youth. And wasn't my lord Clodolphus grand? He may have been a shade less crazy than the Count, but the difference, if any, was trifling. :He was up in the library in a trice, and came down covered with dust, and bringing huge piles of vol- umes to amuse the monk, which it would take, on a moderate computation, five years to read through. And then, was there not dirt enough in the room? It flew round in clouds, and set everybody coughing. Then Brother Stanislaus must solve this    <pb n="486-487" xml:id="VAC6560-00000252"/> 486       DREAMS WITITIN DREAMS. difficulty, and explain that sentence, and, in fact, do such a quantity of work in the literary business, as would have ap- palled the stoutest'heart to think of undertaking. Luckily for Brother Stanislaus, one neutralized the other in their endeavors to show him how welcome he was. Clovis, who was generally a grave, quiet man, was as much out of his senses as the rest. Knowing the old man loved fine dogs, lihe had Heliogabalus and Bingo up at once; who testified their joy by jumping on everybody, and upsetting everybody they jumped on; so that the room was in quite a little state of con- fusion for five minutes. The dogs, however, seemed instinctively to know Brother Stanislaus, and did not attempt to play roughly with him. But I regret to say they respected nobody else. In one min- ute after. their entrance, my lord Clodolphus lay sprawling on top of Prytanis; the Countess was pushed on to a sofa; Lady Nora and Kate were shoved into Godfroy's arms, who said he was sure the girls had done it on purpose, and only pretended it was the dogs. In fine, those five minutes were lively times. The Duke would arrive soon, the old man said. It was for this he had undertaken the journey. The proof of little Ger- trude's claim was complete, and the father had been sent for. Sir Wolgang had gone to seek him, and the two might come at any moment. Where was the child? "At Cecilia's cottage," replied the Count. "I will send for her at once. "Clovis, you had better go. Uphorn will not like waiting." And Clovis was off like a shot. We must follow him to the village. He reached Cecilia's cottage, and found her parents very uneasy. Cecilia, the child, and a stranger had gone out together. Cecilia had left a mes- sage for Claude; but the man at whose house she had left it had gone in search of him, and they had therefore not the slightest idea where she was. She had been absent a long while, and ought to have been home long ago. The Professor they had not seen since the morning. This was all they knew. Suspecting something, Clovis im- mediately made inquiries of every one he could find. Thus, by degrees, he traced Cecilia and the child to the forest. "By Jove!" said he to himself; "La Chambre is at the bottom of this." With which idea he determined to return, rouse the castle, and proceed at once to the old ruin. As he trotted past the inn, Ernest Toservem cried out that   DREAMS WITHN DREAMS.         487 he must stop for a moment. Catching at anything, Clovis, who had already passed the door, turned his horse, and went back. "Now, my man," he said, "I have no time to waste. Can you help me in my search? If you cannot, I must not stop to hear you." At this moment, up came Squire Flint on his horse. "Ah,' he cried to Clovis, " there is no time to be lost, if you wish to save your little friend. Our Professor, Cecilia, and. Gertrude have been pursued, and are now in the Lady's Tower. Cecilia I saw, and she threw me this piece of paper. I cannot say how many men there are in the ruin. I was passing it, and saw some one waving a handkerchief. I rode up, and she threw me down this paper.  Read it." Clovis took the paper.  Cecilia had hastily written these words : "Little Gertrude, the Professor, and I, are in the Lady's Tower. Who- ever you are, bring this to Claude. Bid him be careful and not come alone, as there are I don't know how many bad men around us. CsCILI!" As Clovis finished this, he heard a horseman galloping up the road.  All turned their eyes in the direction of the sound, and saw a tall man on a powerful charger swiftly appro:.chilng. By all I honor," cried Clovis, "it is Uphorn himself! Ride, Flint, for your life, to Bertrand. Let my father know. Show him the paper. You understand?" He Ihad no time to say any more, for the Duke was coming on like lightning. Riding to meet him, Clovis raised his hand even before his voice could be heard, and cried, "Stop, your grace I for the love of God, stop I " The Duke   saw  him, reined in, and looked at him in- quiringly. "'If you love your child," said Clovis, "come with me. She is in danger, but may yet be rescued. But we have little time to wate." With that, he briefly ran over all he knew, and all he had heard. When Clovis mentioned La Chambre, Uphorn turned deadly pale, but mastered himself by a strong effort. As Clo. vis went on, he listened almost mechanically; and when the young man finished by stating he had sent Mint up to the cas: tle for aid, the Duke replied, speaking in a terrible voice: "An eye for an eye, a  tooth for a tooth, blood for blood, and lifeforlifesoshallhe bedealtith.    Come sir. I shall thank you   hereafter. Follow mrue." And, with these words, he turned his horse, and galloped    <pb n="488-489" xml:id="VAC6560-00000253"/> toward the ruin. Clovis followed, loosening his pistols, and ascertaining whether his other arms were in order as he went. Looking neither to the right nor to the left, with his face as sternly fixed as the statue of Nemesis, the Duke rode on. Clovis did not dare address him, nor did .the Duke speak to Clovis. Straight toward the goal, neither stopping for fence nor ditch, on he spurred his horse. The noble animal bore his master over every-obstacle, and Clovis's horse, roused to emu- lation, did the like. Heaven only knows what thoughts were busy in that stern man's brain. Clovis could not help looking at his face with interest as they flew along. All that was intellectually great, all that was expressive of the strong will, nothing that was base, was marked .there in characters which the most superficial could read at a glance. But all softer sentiments seemed en- cased in a panoply of sternness. "It would not be good," said Clovis to himself, " for any one who has wronged his child, to meet him now. There is more than murder in that eye." They reached the ruin at last. Cecilia was still on the watch. "I will not disturb the old man," she said to herself. "He has been sorely tried, and is weary." So the heroic girl took her station at the window, or rather at what had once been a window; and never was there a trustier sentinel. The child had gone into the next room, and lain down by the side of the old man. So were matters when Uphorn and Clovis arrived. "Which tower?" asked the Duke.  "Ah, I see, now. I see her waving her handkerchief." And, with these few words, he leaped from his horse, and strode across the yard. Without thinking of his horse, Clovis followed his example, and followed him, with his sword drawn, ready to defend him, if needful. Striding up to the door of the Lady's Tower, Uphorn drew his sword, and, applying the hilt to the lock, burst it open with a blow. They both entered. It was like a vast cylinder. All the inner part had fallen in, except the upper rooms where the three were imprisoned. Throwing his weapon down, the Duke seized a projecting beam, and drew himself up. "My God! you are not going to climb up?" cried Clovis, in a perfect agony. The Duke never answered a word. There seemed to be a spirit in him impelling him on. Clovis stood transfixed with horror, watching him mount from beam to beam, and expecting   DREAMS WITHN DREAMS.        489 every moment to see him fall.  "Holy God l" he cried, "spare the life of this poor, mad father. He knows not what be does." Whether he only fancied it or not, can never be known; but as Clovis, fascinated by the sight, kept gazing up, he saw, or imagined he saw, an angel supporting .Uphorn by the way. He closed his eyes for an instant, when he heard a heavy fall. He shuddered as he -opened them.   No. In his perilous ascent, just as Uphorn took hold of another beam, the one be- low him, and on which he had been standing, fell with a crash. So, from broken beam to beam, did that heroic father, with the courage of love, mount nearly two hundred feet, to rescue his only child. Just as he safely reached the top, and had already disap- 'peared, Clovis, who had sunk down almost fainting in his re. lief, heard the clattering of horses. It was Claude, at the head of the whole village. Clovis ran to him, and told him what ,had happened. - Praised be God and the saints!" cried Claude; "the rash man is safe. As soon as I heard what had occurred, I galloped up here, attended by our friends; for I found out the secret of that tower when the Count of Piquemont and I lived }ere. Come with me. His grace shall descend more securely." So saying, he led Clovis to a part of the foundation where there was 4 secret entrance leading to a passage made in the wall. "Now, my good friends," said Clovis to the rest, "you wait below. I know very well you would all like to come up; but I suppose you value your precious lives. I may take that for granted, I suppose?" Here he was interrupted by Ebenezer. "Oh, my!" he cried; " if here a'n't a man smashed I " "Where?" cried Jonathan Sewell, the tailor, timorously. "Bah!" said Solomon Coffin, the sexton, contemptuously; "I don't believe a word of it." "You be still!" quoth Smaragdus, slapping the wretched little man over the head with the flat of Uphorn's sword, which he had picked up. "Well," continued Claude, "I can't stop to talk now; but if you all come up, there will be plenty of men smashed. The old tower is now doing its best in carrying the weight of those up there, and I would not answer for many more. Why, that fat man there would be enough to crush the pyramids of Egypt, to say nothing of a rotten old tower like this." 21*    <pb n="490-491" xml:id="VAC6560-00000254"/> PO0      DREAMS WITHN DREAMS. Smaragdus grinned. "Come on, Claude," said Clovis. "Remember Cecilia." Claude said no more, but led the way up through the wall. As soon as the two had disappeared, Ebenezer began to whine. "I wish," said he to Smaragdus, "you wouldn't always be a fetching me cracks on my sore head." "I'll fetch yoa some more," said Smaragdus, "if you a'n't pretty considerable still." "I only said there was a fellow squashed out there," whim- pered the wretched little man. "I see him myself, when I looked through the door." "DIo you mean to say," asked Samson Shuttle, the weaver, "that you really saw what you said you saw?" "I never see such chaps I " whimpered Ebenezer. ' You are always a thinking I am a lying." "That is because," remarked Peter Cutter, the barber, "that you are always a telling lies. Don't you be always a telling'lies, and people won't be always a suspecting you." "Well," said Ernest Toservem, "let us go out and see this smash up." "And mind your eye, if there a'n't any!" quoth Smarag- dus, shaking the Duke's sword at the wretched little man. "I'll just give you a licking if there a'n't none." And I'll add a kick," said Peter Cutter, the barber. "And I, a punch," quoth Ernest Toservem, the innkeeper. "And I, a hiding," said Solomon Coffin, the sexton. "And I, a basting," said Samson Shuttle, the weaver. "Any more of you?" howled the wretched little man. "Oh, what a world this is I What do you say, Jonathan Sewell?" Now Jonathan Sewell hadwaxed valiant when he saw lle was in a majority, and hence determined to show that he was a brave man-which had been greatly questioned of yore. So, with some trepidation, he walked up to Ebenezer, and gave him a sounding slap on the cheek. The wretched little mani} yelled, and Sewell was surprised by receiving an awful slap on his head, given by Smaragdus with the flat of Uphorn's sword. "You let him alone," remarked that gentleman. The poor tailor slunk off amid the roars of his companions, who were rejoiced at his defeat.  Smaragdus watched him, and then, without altering the gravity of his expression, burst into a loud, hoarse laugh. Never having known him to do such a thing before, his ac-   DREAMS WITHN DREAMS.        491 quaintances were not a little alarmed. They then proceeded to inspect the body. The dead man was soon found, and recognized, by his clothes, as the person who lately had lived in the village. They stood congregated about him, when a loud noise of horses, coming up at full gallop, was heard. In a moment more, Count Bertrand rode into the courtyard, followed by Piquemont, my lord Clodolphus, Sir Wolfgang, Prytanis (who was embracilng his horse's neck, and had lost his hat), Squire Flint, Godfrov, Hollar, Peter, Samuel, Gabriel, and all the servants. The ser- vants, by the by, were two on a horse, and hastily armed. They numbered quite a little regiment, as they entered the courtyard. Let us now go back to the Duke. He climbed into the entrance of the room where the three he sought were impris- oned. He had acted like one in a dream, and had achieved something which he could not have done under ordinary cir. cumstances. When he reached a secure place, he was perfectly unconscious of having been in any danger. Cecilia, who was astonished at seeing an armed man ascend from the abyss, as it were, shrieked, and fled to a corner of the room; where she stood looking at him, and trembling. With an expression which reassured her, Uphorn ap. proached her. "God bless you! God bless you!" he sobbed, and fell on the floor as weak as a child. Cecilia ran to raise him. She had recognized the father of little Gertrude. Uphorn at length recovered sufficiently to speak. His first words were, "Is my child safe?" "Quite safe," replied Cecilia. The Duke flung himself on his knees, and covered his face with his hands. Cecilia understood his feelings, and stood by, a respectful and affected spectator. After a short prayer, Uphorn rose. "Lead me to her," he said. "I would embrace my child before I die." Cecilia led the way into the next room. The Duke paused at the entrance. Little Gertrude lay sleeping, and smiling in her dreams. The old man lay by her, his arm around her as if he would protect her. Silently the father bent over the two, and then started back. His child was sleeping, and the old man lay dead; his' arm around her, as if his last thought had been for his darling's protection.    <pb n="492-493" xml:id="VAC6560-00000255"/> DREAMS WITHN DREAMS.     493   CHAPTER XLIX. WHAT HAPPENED IN THE OLD RUIN, AND WHAT CAME OF IT. SLOWLY and sadly they descended the secret staircase; the Duke bearing his child in his arms, and Claude and Cecilia fol- lowing. The shout which welcomed their appearance was fol- lowed by a mournful silence when they heard of the Profes- sor's death. Taking several of the servants with him, Claude ascended to where Clovis stood watching the body. The Count ordered others to go to the woods, and cut down several sap- lings. With these they made a rough bier, and the gentlemen, unbuttoning their cloaks, threw them over the body of the old man. In the mean while, Clovis went to the secret door in the monk's cell, and found it fastened down. The only other way of entering the Youth's Tower was blocked up by huge stones, over which the earth had already long spread a carpet of grass. But the Duke was determined not to return without La Cham- bre. Consigning little Gertrude to the care of Claude and Ce- cilia, he bade them superintend the removal of the Professor's body. Pressing his child to his heart, and bidding Claude not lose sight of her until he should join him, Uphorn, recovering his stern, cold manner, ordered the men so to surround the tower that La Chambre could not escape. He then placed himself in front of it, and cried, in a loud voice which rang through the ruin: "Joseph Occa, I summon you to surrender!" As he spoke, a black figure came out on the balcony, where the legend said his ancestor had held his iuterview with Cy- rillus. "Who is it," he said, "who calls upon me so threaten- ingly?" "I, Louis of Uphorn," said the Duke. "And what would Louis of Uphorn?" asked La Cham- bre. '"He calls upon you to surrender yourself," replied the Duke; "to vindicate your name, if innocent, or to suffer the penalty of the law, if guilty." "The ears of the Uphorn," said La Chambre, coldly, " are unaccustomed to censure, and deaf to menace."   "When an Uphorn," replied the Duke, " is impeached, he must be tried, judged, and sentenced, or acquitted, as well as another." "Judged! sentenced! acquitted!" cried the other, haugh- tily. "Look around you. Here, amid the ruins. of what was once our throne, do you speak to one of our race as you would to the peasant cur you whip from your path? When was it known that an Uphorn submitted to man, while there was strength in his right arm? But to you I am willing to reply. State your charges, -n:d I will answer them." "I make no charge, and require no answer," said the Duke. "You cannot escape me now. The majesty of the law must be enforced." "Must?" said La Chambre, scornfully. "fMust?  And to me? If you speak by inspiration, you do well. But, if you are guided by human judgment, your words are worse than folly." "Send for a ladder!" cried the Duke. "A ladder, sir? Yes, sir," said the wretched little man. "Smaragdus, you run for a ladder." "Run yourself," replied Smaragdus. "We will try," continued the Duke, "your boasted power. Bar the door well, for you will soon hear me knocking." "Go," said La Chambre, with a cold, quiet scorn, that be- trayed the consciousness of power, " seek your ladders. But you, Louis of Uphorn, listen to me. When the foundations of these towers were laid, our race was mighty in the land. Now, three only remain. One is an old man; another, with- out an heir to succeed him; and the third is myself. Solitary and childless, the lasthorn of our family stands here this day. When these walls were built, it was prophesied that they should be the tomb of the last Uphorn. I, the youngest and last, will soon find a grave in their ruins. A fiery devil is even now busy sapping the foundations. Let your men bring their lad- ders, but do not order them to come near. And stand you back all, lest you, too, perish in the coming crash." As he said this, a slight smoke curled up, ascending from the window behind him. The spectators fell back instinctively. La Chambre stood with folded arms, like a statue carved in ebony. The diamonds he wore sparkled in the light of the sun. His face was deadly pale, but he was as firm and cold as if the frightful volcano was not raging beneath his feet. "Watch well," cried the Duke, "that he does not descend in the smoke, and escape."     <pb n="494-495" xml:id="VAC6560-00000256"/> DREAMS WITHN DREAMS.   495   "No fear of that," said the Count. "The wind drives the smoke away from him. We can see him as long as he remains up there. Madman! how can he? Seel the fire is already mounting." A thrill of horror passed through the crowd, as the first glare of flames was seen. The smoke was now growing thicker and thicker. As it emerged from the window behind La Chambre, the wind blew it away. And so they distinctly saw him, like a protrait with a background of smoke, veined now and then with fire. "Poor man!" said Piquemont.  "Crime is wondrous strong. See how one man can triumph over a host. God for- give him!" Death is preferable to shame," remarked Clovis. "And shame is preferable to suicide," answered Pique. mont. "Louis, for the love of God, let not that poor man kill himself before our eyes!" "Will the ladder never come?" muttered the Duke, as the fire grew stronger. "Not until too late, I fear," said Clovis. "They must go all the way to the village for one." "He must escape, then," said the Duke. "I cannot stand still and see him perish thus." Whereupon Uphorn approached the tower. "Joseph," he cried, " go, in God's name, and amend!" "I stand here, the arbiter of my destiny," was the reply. "I neither surrender, nor receive grace. Farewell." "But why this madness?" remonstrated the Duke. "Have you not a soul to save? I tell you, you are free." "Ay, Louis of Uphorn," answered the other, "I am free, and not by your kind office or benign protection. My hour is come. They have told me so, and I know it well. Once more I defy you to do your worst. For the 'last time I warn you back, if you value life." Seeing the flames were gathering more and more strength every moment, and that it was rashness to remain, the Duke was forced unwillingly to retreat. The scene had reached a point of horror which was almost insupportable. The Duke covered his face with his hands, and prayed. The Count ran up and down, wild at his. inability to do something. My lord Clodolphus, Sir Wolfgang, and Clovis ran to the forest to cut down twigs and form even a temporary ladder, although they knew it never could be finished in time. The rest stood gazing   on, fascinated by the dreadful tragedy which was being acted before them. Even Ebenezer was now quiet. They could see La Chambre's tall, black form still standing motionless. They could see the diamonds he wore glittering in the glare of the fire, which was now rapidly mounting. They could see a great furnace of flames behind him, rushing upward from story to story, and even already mounting above the summit of the tower; roaring and raging, darting out bright tongues from the windows, sending millions of sparks through the woods, and vomiting clouds of smoke in the air. At this moment, a door, hitherto unobserved, fell out with a crash, showing the whole interior, which was one red mass of glowing flames. The party now were compelled to draw a little farther back. As they did so, Brother Stanislaus, who had ridden out to meet them, came up on a mule, attended by two or three of the servants. When he learned the state of affairs, he descended from the animal, and said: "Stand all away. I myself will reason with this unhappy man." "Father! father!" cried Uphorn, drawing him back as he was advancing toward the burning tower, "' what would you do? You are rushing to your death." "My son," replied the religious, with an authority which the Duke did not dare disobey, "stand back. Remember, your father commands. you. I must obey God, and save that poor man's soul." The interest now was painfully intense. Brother Stanislaus boldly marched up to the tower, unmindful of anything but his mission of love. "Joseph!" he cried, in a clear voice; " you, who will not hearken to the voice of man, listen to the word of God. You disdain to stoop to the command of your fellow creatures. Submit to the word of your ,Creator. By Him who creates, redeems, and sanctifies, I adjure you to fly the wrath to come! If your love of your own life cannot move you; if the care of your salvation cannot sway you, let the pleadings and the risk of your old kinsman melt you. If you have no pity for your- self, have pity on me. Come, oh, my child! It was here Cy- rillus plead with his father. It is here I plead with you, not for my own life, which I risk willingly, but for your own; and oh I for what is of infinitely greater value--for the salvation of your immortal soul! Come, then, my child, in His name      <pb n="496-497" xml:id="VAC6560-00000257"/> who taketh us up when our father and our mother have left us." "You, dear kinsman," replied La Chambre, "were the only one who spoke kindly to me when others forsook me. I pray you, remain not. Good or evil, my resolution is fixed. I would have done one good deed before I died, but chance took away my opportunity. Stay not-" As he was speaking, the whole tower shook from its found- ation. Uphorn and the Count rushed forward. Crash after crash followed quickly, the one after the other. The other tower, which the conflagration had not reached as yet, trem- bled, and then, with a noise like thunder, fell down. For a moment, a dense cloud of dust and smoke covered the ruins. The crowd drew back appalled, when the Count and Uphorn emerged, supporting the old man between them. "Safe, thank God'!" cried the Duke. "Blessed indeed be God!" cried the old monk, as he fell heavily on the ground. A stream of blood poured from his mouth. All uttered a cry of horror, as the Duke raised his head. "What was it? Are you burned? Are you hurt, dear father?" asked Uphorn. "I cannot say," replied the old monk, faintly. "I think a stone struck me here, but I remember very little." And he' touched his breast as he spoke. He then lay a few moments on the ground, half conscious only, and occasionally putting his hand to his lips, and looking at it. Nothing can paint the sorrow of those around, or the agony of his son, who knelt, supporting his father's head. La Cham, bre's terrible fate was forgotten. All attention centred on the old man who lay so helpless before them. "Are you better now, dear father?"' asked Uphorn. "Much better," replied the old man. "Clovis, run for a litter! and you, Wolfgang, ride for Owen!" cried the Count. In an instant the two young men leaped on the first horses they could find, and were off. The rest made as good a bed as they could of what garments they could strip ofli and some leaves; on which rude couch they laid him. "Do me one favor, Louis," said his father, in a low voice. "Put your hand in my bosom, and draw out my crucifix. Thank you. Now let some one search for Joseph."   JJ1i5juo WITHL'IN DRIEAMS.     497 He could say no more, but, pressing the image of his God repeatedly to his lips, he lay engaged in silent prayer. A search was made for the body of the unfortunate man. It was then the Count learned for the first time the fate of Albert. But he had gone through so much that day that he did not feel it until afterward. The search was unsuccessful. La Chambre had perished in the fall of the tower, and lay buried under a large mound of stones. They renewed the search next day, when the heat had somewhat abated, but in vain. La Chambre's funeral pyre was his grave. When they bore Brother Stanislaus along gently, there was not one among them who had not an anxious heart except him- self. On one side of the litter walked Owen. "There was no present danger," he had said; "but they must be very care- ful." On the other side walked Uphorn. The old man had tried to persuade him to mount his horse, but the Duke said he preferred walking. The Count had already gone before. Godfroy, Hollar, Clo- vis, Sir Wolfgang, and Prytanis, followed quietly. My lord Clodolphus and Piquemont had remained a moment, to search for the body of La Chambre. The little procession thus reached the castle in detachments. Brother Stanislaus was removed at once to bed, and a messen. ger, at his earnest request, despatched at once to the convent. He then fell asleep. The Duke at first proposed staying beside his father's bed, but they persuaded him not to do so. Owen again assured him that there was no present danger, and told him it was best not to let his father suppose they feared for him, as such had often a bad effect on the sick. This had the intended effect. Uphorn retired, and little Gertrude was brought to him. He took her up in his arms, and said, as he parted her golden locks, "Your grandfather is very ill, Gertrude." "Who is my grandfather?" asked the child. "They say my dear old friend is dead. He used to tell me to call him my 'dear old friend.' What is death, sir?" "Call me father, my child. I am your father." What is death, father?" "A good thing for the good, Gertrude; only a bad thing for the bad." "Why did Cecilia cry, father, when she told me he was dead? May I not see him? Shall I never see him again?"    <pb n="498-499" xml:id="VAC6560-00000258"/> "8       DR!,AMS ITHNr DREAMS.             "You will, Gertrude, once more, when it shall please God, and never, never leave him more; but not here. You must wait until you meet in heaven." The child sat on the Duke's knee, gravely musing. At length she turned up her face, and, with her blue eyes all tears, threw both her little arms round his neck, and sobbed out, "I  don't understand it, dear father." We have called Uphorn a cold, stern man, and he was so ordinarily; but had any one seen him bending over his child,  caressing her, or had any one been able to read the grateful  thanksgivings which arose in his heart to his God, they would have added one more lesson to the experience of life; that ex- perience which daily teaches us not to judge too hastily the inner by the outer man. "I call my God to witness," said the Duke, turning to my lord Clodolphus, who was standing near the window, pretend- ing to look out, and wiping his eves, "I call my God to witness that I say the truth, when I thank Him for having rewarded the benefactor of my child. How could I have repaid him? Must man never learn how greatness is not the child of intel- lect, nor nobility the fruit of birth? Heaven has shown, in the virtue of that humble man's life, how piety can rise infi- nitely superior to the accidents of birth, or the little elevations to which earthly ambition would vault." My lord Clodolphus made no reply at first, and, when he did'answer, it was merely to acquiesce, for his heart was full. A noble old fellow was my lord Clodolphus, if he was a pedant. The next day the old monk was so much better, that he re- ceived them all in his room, a few at a time; although Owen cautioned them not to let him speak too much. After they had paid their respects, and were about to retire, he expressed a desire to see his son alone; which was, of course, imme- diately gratified. "My son," said the old man, when they were alone to- i gether, "I wish to speak to you before I die. Heaven has given me strength for this interview, but it will not last long. My hours are numbered; my end is drawing nigh. I must soon stand in the presence of my God." "Oh, father! dear father, no! God will not bear so hard upon me as that!"

When Wolfgang visited me, and told me of the blessing reserved for you, I thanked my God; but I thanked Him as I would have blessed Him for any mercy shown to any other man.  For I love you, Louis, now, for His sake who gave you to me; and that love is more en- during than the love of a father. Heaven, dear child, has taught me to cling to you through honor and dishonor, through bad report and good report, when praised and when blamed when just and when sinful; and the kindness of a father ex- tends not so far: for the love of our parents, unaided by grace, has its limits; but the empire of charity is boundless. All are its children--all its objects of care. "Yet the vow of obedience was on me. I was commanded to come here, and I came. Even so, had they commanded me to go elsewhere, I would have gone. The wil of God directs the will of our superior, and to obey him is to obey Heaven. "And now let me  finish my task. I came here to assist your search.  That search is ended. Let me, too, accomplish my ministry. "You, Louis, have your own destiny to accomplish, and your daughter's future to influence. Remember, my son, that the end of our creation being the salvation of our souls, the object of our education should always point to that consumnma tion. Remember what man is; how limited are his ideas; how much he is enslaved by passion; how much cause he has to regret, and how little pains he takes to amend. "System, my son, seems to be pursued in every study ex- cept the study of Christian perfection and the salvation of our souls, by the vast majority of mankind; although they come into the world, live in it, die in it, for this, and for this solely.    <pb n="500-501" xml:id="VAC6560-00000259"/> 500     DRIEAMS WITHN DREAMS.   "In these days of religious disturbance, my son, it is a great thing to keep the faith; but oh! how far greater it is to win perfect charity! Great is the man who wins the crown of life, amid the fierce strivings of the world. Remember, Louis, charity is all in all-the breath of faith, and the vitality of hope; consecrating art, elevating science, hallowing good works, sealing miracles, and perfecting martyrdom. Let our little Gertrude be taught this systematically, that we three may be all united where the weary are at rest. "Do not pay slight attention to this, my son. Many pur- sue the ways of wisdom by sudden impulses. To-day they are devout, to-morrow tepid, the next day devout again. How would any pursuit of life succeed, if carried on in that way? "And oh, Louis! let not the pomps of the world take too strong a hold on you or your child. Ambitious men cry, 'I will erect a monument more enduring than brass I' Ay, my son; it will endure forever, and its likeness is the smoke of torment, and it will stand, world without end, the tombstone of him who has died the second death, unless that monument has its base on humility-unless that monument has been raised solely and entirely by the grace of Almighty God. "Let Gertrude systematically be taught to know her destiny; to use every accomplishment she may acquire, every lesson she may learn, every worldly grace she may gain, to this one holy end. And, Louis, when the last hour shall come; when you lie upon your dying bed, you will have deeds to console you which will prove far greater comforters than the glory of war, tile pomp of rank, or all the miserable vanities we pursue so earnestly here, and learn to regret so sorrowfully hereafter." As the old man spoke, his face glowed with holy love. In a kind of ecstasy, he raised his two hands to heaven, and seemed communing with the God of love. O Love! who bendest from heaven to light the infant's eyes, as it upward turns its little face, smiling to meet the fond look of its mother. Encircling arms enclose it with a mother's might, as the helpless little one rests securely nestling in her bosom. Love sanctifies all she touches. In graceful choir the spirits of beauty praise her. Like April, now weeping, now smiling, goodly in promise and generous of hand; touching the trees, and they bud; treading the fields, and the flowers spring up; commanding the winds, and they cease; repelling winter,   and he flies to the far north: so the bright spirit of Charity comes among us, and we are gladdened. The infant spring, the helpless crowd of plants and living things which gather plenty from thy breast, O Nature, speak of His love whom all should worship, whom so few adore. But I see another spirit; I hear another voice. It speaks of love, but in a different strain. Let us mark it. Another spirit moves among the flowers.  Modest her glance as she turns away her blushing face. Each motion speaks of charms unknown.  Hearken to the song of her adorers. "Let me forever dwell with thee, sweet spirit! Let me seek th upland, as the sun peeps from behind the blue moun- tains. f-ne carve my lady's name on the boughs of some oak. Let the rapture of love wake my golden lyre. Venus and Eros, come! Let the merry satyrs join the roundelay. Let the nymphs of the grove, and the fairies, awaken the sil- very echoes with the songs of gladness. "Or, when Phoebe pours from the sky her mild lustre on the deep, let me take my stand on the rock-strewn beach of the ocean, where the billows murmuring plash as they break on the shell-covered sand. "Let fair Fancy speak, then. Let her wreathe a crown for my lady. Let her weave a magic veil for her. Let her paint her in the ideal colors of love. Fleeting as the lightning, lovely as the dayspring, let the dream linger a little longer. Take, oh, take me not away from that happy land!  Must beauty vanish so soon? Must it come and go, like the foam of the ocean?          m Lo, another spirit appears. Veiled in black it stands holding an hourglass. Its breath is cold. Its face is hidden. Hark! it speaks. "Mortal, love is eternal, beauty is eternal, goodness is eter. nal. It had no beginning. It will have no end, Before the world was, it lived. When the world will be no more, it will exist. It is three, and yet one; for goodness, beauty, and love are but one. It rides upon light, and is busy in darkness. It speaks in the attractions thou singest. It conquers in the beauty thou adorest. By it are things beautiful. By it is man hallowed. "Turn, then, thy worship to the centre of perfection, and there wilt thou find all thou seekest, all thou admirest, all thou dost adore.   <pb n="502-503" xml:id="VAC6560-00000260"/> "Seek it not here, for it is transient. Seek it where it never passes away. ' Alpha and omega, first and last, beginning and end, he that overcometh shall possess it, when all former things have passed away." CHAPTER L. HOW THEY CONSIGNlED THE OLD PROFESSOR TO H LAST RESTING PLACE. THE morning sun shone brightly over the hills and valleys of Dreamland. With a saddened glory it passed through the stained-glass windows of the chapel at Bertrand Castle. Here  a sorrowful crowd were assembled on their knees, while before the altar stood the coffin of the old Professor. His face was uncovered, and they could see it in all the calmness of that eternal sleep which soon must come upon us all. At the head of the coffin was a table shrouded in black, on which a crucifix was placed between two consecrated candles. The altar was also covered with the same dark color, and the  priest's garments were likewise of the same hue. "If Thou, O Lord, shalt mark our iniquities, who, Lord, shall abide it?"                     / Then the choir took up the reply, and the De Profundis sadly rose from the hearts and lips of the mournful congrega- tion. "Out of the depths have I cried unto Thee, O Lord  Lord, hear my voice. Oh! let Thine ears consider well the voice of my complaint." V. "Eternal rest give unto him, O Lord!  R. "And let perpetual light shine upon him." And now the Miserere ascended to the throne of grace. The voices of many whom he had served so well in life, joined in supplication for the repose of his soul. From the tears of the young child he had loved so well; from the sobs of t!;ee prince whom the peasant had so enriched; from the admiration and grief of the noble gentlemen who learned his value too j late; from the voices of the humbler crowd, who felt his great- I   DREAMS WITHN D REAIrS.       503 ness their own, and learned how the faith of Christ levels all distinctions of rank, and opens a career of ambition to al1 equally, there rose to the throne of God such prayers as are offered for few of those who pass from life to eternity. "Come to his assistance, ye saints of God I Come forth to meet him, ye angels of the Lord; receiving his soul, offering it in the sight of the Most High. May Christ receive thee, who called thee; and may the angels conduct thee to Abra- ham's bosom." Ay, may the saints and angels lead thee, old man, to the presence of thy God. May thy wife and little child, buried long, long ago by the blue lake where the Alps rise up to the heavens, where their graves are shadowed by the old gothic church, silvered by the mild rays of the moon, come forth to meet thee. May they place a crownD on thy head, and a palm in thy hand. Repose in peace, warrior of Christ! for the fight was well fought, and the reward has come. Where thou art, there shall be no curse any more: but the throne of God and of the Lamb are in it, and his servants s erve Him  And they see His face, and His name is on their foreheads. And nigfht is not there; neither need they the light of a lamp, nor the light of the sun: for the Lord God doth enlighten them, and they reign forever and ever. "Enter not into judgment with Thy servant, O Lord; for in Thy sight shall no man be justified, unless, through Thee, remission of all his sins be granted unto him." How these words sink into the hearts of the congregation! Oh! when death comes, then we realize the littleness of our plans and hopes and expectations. Spirit of our dreams say, dear imagination! how is it thy gentle power is so seldom used for virtue? Sweet Coryphaeus of hope I art thou never to be turned toward the home Christ died to give us? Must we toil and pant for the pomp and hollowness of earthly grandeur, always unmindfull of those many mansions ready for whoso wills in heaven? Oh, my soul! in this dream of life, turn thine eyes toward the holy' three. Faith, Hope, Charity-- mark them well. View their flight. Throw away thy earthly purpose, and from God's transcendent glory catch the true Pro- methean fire. Let Victory sound her summons or in war. or in science, or in pleasure; but turn thine eves upon the spot where unsought worth soars to heaven, borne upon an angel's wing.  Mark the past. Learn while thou canst. Now is the ap.    <pb n="504-505" xml:id="VAC6560-00000261"/> ointed day. Turn thine eyes to the north, and listen to the rild lamentations of the Druid.  Turn to the south, where Lthene's columns stand beneath far fairer skies than frown ver Albion.  Fitful, changeful, thoughtful, and wild, the orthern bard breathes forth his lays. Great, sonorous, stern, ad sublime sing the poets of Hellas.  But a cloud like that rhich envelops the entrance to Tartarus hangs over their "ghty minstrelsy. Dark the word issues from prophetic lips.  "Woe I woe! roe!" they cry. Yet the promise smiles through them, as ie sunlight breaks through the clouds when the tempest is bout to pass away. Then ye arose, sweet Faith and Hope!  Ye sprang from a rave, but it was the grave of God.  And between you stood "r Charity, her head encircled with a halo which poured eter- al rays over the dark realm of time. How  impure, how wicked, how  detestable seems the false hilosophy of the world, as those rays expose 'it, in all its hide- us ugliness, to the mind's eye. Listen to Anacreon. He tells s of the enchantments of jovial song, the silver bowl, and the urple grape. Maidens' eyes beam on him like the houris of a ream.  Revel in love and wine.  What more has earth or eaven to offer, than to drink, and love, and live?"Let us eat nd drink, for to-morrow we die." Can it be the rational soul deifies such revelry? Can it be "e reasoning spirit finds a heaven in the cup? Oh! see there, i that still form, which lies so quietly in its narrow bed; see here, in that mourning crowd, who bend so sorrowfully in rayer; listen to the lesson spoken in the solemn requiem which ises on the wings of music upward; to the forcible, heartfelt, nimpeachable, unwavering protest of nature against this ter- ible infatuation. Raise then thine eyes without doubt, without terror; Raise then thine eyes to the throne of thy God; Raise then thine eyes, trembling victim of error; Rather his smile need'st thou fear than his rod. Rather his smile; for the look of forgiveness Pierces far deeper than equity's frown: There is a force in the calm s solemn stillness, Greater than when the clouds awfully frown. Fear love's reproach and forgiveness, son, rather: This dread will perfect thee, and that will secure; Fear thou the grief and the tears of a father, Trust thou the love that shall ever endure.   Heed not life's sorrows. There are consolations  Only the virtuous ever can know. Up rom the depths of the saints' lamentations, Ilses an angel to hallow the woe. There is a calm only known to the upright, When the contention of sorrow is o'er. Glory descends on the death of the contrite, Anguish behind, and a heaven before. Even at sunset, which reddens the heaven After the tempest hath darkened the day Nature, rejoicing, to sinners hath given An emblem oftlife which must soon pass away. There have been storms-who doth live and not sorrow - Now there is sunshine-but fading in night; Anticipation now points to the morrow, When the red dayspring shall herald the light. Here there is grief. On the morrow unending, Only the hopes of the penitent soul, In life's calm sunset-good angels befriending-- Sees thus its last hours solemnly roll. Patience, compunction, like vapors, no longer Shadow joys sun; while, prophetic, its beam Speaks of that morrow, as, stronger and stronger, Grace's bright rays with benevolence stream. Then those dense vapors that darkened our lifetime, Serve-our last agony's pangs to efface Even as the clouds which the sunset encircle To its magnificence add a new grace.

"May his soul, and the souls of all the faithful departed, through the mercy of God, rest in peace." "Amen." Dear reader, these are vague thoughts, flitting past like shadows-dreams within dreams. Ay, there are some thoughts which cannot be circumscribed within the pale of expression. Let them stand so. Vague, indefinite, indistinct impressions; which come, we know not whence; which influence us, we know not how. Let them stand. I seem to lose my utterance, as I look across that awful abyss which I so soon must cross. The voices of the shadowy multitude come to me like the dis- tant murmur of the wind, mournful and indistinct. Let them stand. Should I write these thoughts a thousand times over, they would still preserve their phantom character. The dead speak more to sentiment than reason; and the thoughts of sen- timent suffer when expressed in the language of the under. standing. Some say we can express clearly all we think. Ah, are there not many inexpressible aspirations and regrets, which no tongue can utter? When we take our stand beside de. parted worth, are there any words which can paint our feel. ings? If there are, we have never loved deeply, never sut: fered much, Slowly and tearfully they bore the old man to his last rest- ingplace. Seldom had a poor man such an array of noble pall- bearers and noble mourners. The funeral procession wound along the serpentine descent leading town from the castle, and then proceeded through the forest beneath the shadows of thte oak, aspen, cypress, and yew, until they reached the. old church. yard. It was a beautiful spot, many acres in extent, and through which coursed a little brook. There they buried him,   and there they left him sleeping, underneath an old oak which for centuries had guarded the spot. And there the old man slept, lulled by the ripple of the little stream, and by the rustling of the leaves. There he slept, when the moon rose at the close of day; when the stars looked down upon the quiet place, and seemed to hold communion with the fathers of the hamlet. There let us leave him, with the last words of Father Wilfrid yet in our hearts: "God, who weighs us by our acts; God, who judges men with a just judgment; God, who reads the heart; God, who     ( marks each passing thought-let Him decide on his worth: and it will be well if the same crown be awarded us, when we enter the joy of our Lord." CHAPTER LI. HOW THE AUTHOR HAS A LITTLE CONVERSATION WITH DIVERS PHANTOMS. THE dream properly is over. Let us have the epilogue,      1 and so conclude. A few words, dear reader, and one mor ' scene, and you will be dismissed. Then the curtain shall drop, the lights shall be extinguished, and the doors closed. Perhaps it is a weakness so to linger at the last; but " farewell" is a very hard word to say. To confess candidly what is my real opinion, I am very much discontented with this book. Hastily begun, hastily written, and hastily concluded, I have failed in representing what T wished to produce. I do not say this in vindication of my work; for the obvious answer would be, Why, then, did you not burn it up, or rewrite it? To this I reply, that I have always looked upon better as the enemy of good. A book should be destroyed by authors (of my temperament, at least), rather than allowed to be tried to be improved. There are some men who cannot write slowly. These men seld6m write well. Of this class I am certainly a good sample. Nor can I be suspected of writing ;his to extort praise. If I said it, I would expose myself to such suspicion; for, in con-    <pb n="508-509" xml:id="VAC6560-00000263"/> 508       DEEAMS WITHN DREAMS. versation, politeness often compels us to make use of that pious fraud known as a compliment. Between author and reader, no such necessity occurs. -They seldom meet. The vanity of the one is never wounded by the observations of the other; and the opinion of Ghe world, being candid, gives a lesson to the writer. But bah! let us leave sentiment to babes, and bequeathe spoon meat to the sick. What is the use of disguising facts, or discussing matters that are as plain as a pikestaff? Failure is not so bad a thing, after all; and, besides, there are the chances. First, the publisher may like the book: that is chance number one. If he does, I am sure I shall not grum- ble. I am not going to quarrel with my bread and butter. Next, the publisher may not like the book, which is more prob- able: that is chance number two. Then there is the chance of the public admiring it very much--which is highly improb- able; and the chance of their not liking it at all-which is more than probable; and the chance of their never reading a page of it-which is positively disgusting. Oh, aspirations of Parnassus seekers! Poor -devils of authors! what a very funny set we are! People read the biographies of those who have succeeded. I think it would be equally amusing and instructive to read the biographies of those who failed. Oh, for a muse to do the subject justice! Here Jones comes in. Jones has written an absurdly feeble effort at epic poetry. Jones has been respectfully rejected. Is Jones satisfied that his book is worthless? No, innocent reader; not he. If he could be once induced to believe he had written dulness, there would be hopes for him. He might improve. But no! Jones thinks his book does not suit the times; thinks the publisher cannot appreciate it; thinks the publisher has too much on hand, at present, to undertake another work; re- ligiously believes all the publisher, in the kindness of his heart and natural politeness, says to smooth over the mortification of refusal. Jones, in fine, catches at this straw, as he sinks drown- ing in the flood of failure. Here comes Robinson. Robinson has just written an in- tensely gloomy novel, where passion is not only torn to tatters, but thrown like dust into the eyes of the spectator. With Bottom, he says (to himself), "Let the audience look to their eyes. I will move storms. I will condole in some measure." "Yet my chief humor is for a tyrant. I could play Ercles rarely, or a part to tear a cat in-to make all split.   DREAMS WITHN DREAMS.         509 "The raging rocks, With shivering shocks, Shall break the locks Of prison gates; And Phibbus' car Shall shine from far, And make and mar The foolish fates." Somehow or another, Robinson, in his tragic efforts to tear the said cat and make all split, makes the critic split his sides with laughter. Robinson is rejected. Robinson becomes a misanthrope. Jones and Robinson come together by   natural affnity. They strike up a friendship. They form a mutual admiration society. Does the reader suppose there are not many such clubs? Oh, trusting, innocent reader! 1, Ulric de Lazie, am happy to say, not only that I have often failed, but that I take peculiar credit for having done so goodnaturedly.  Why the deuce should I not fail? It is all nonsense to talk of genius being neglected be a proof of genius, how blessed our age must be in her sons! I know a great number of geniuses'-myself included-if that is to be the standard. Nonsense! A man writes to sell, and does not sell. Suppose his work is a masterpiece. Let us assume that. Now, what right has he to thrust even a master- piece on the public, if the public does not want it? We are- right in pitying the poverty of genius, and in wishing it a bet- ter fate. But the great artist or philosopher, hungry, is not more hungry than one who starves, even if he be neither an artist nor a philosopher. When a mlan perishes of want, and his works survive him, that man is necessarily brought before the public, and consequently pitied. But there are thousands equally to be pitied, whom we never hear of. It is all a lot. tery. Some have fame, some not. Some have money, some not. Some have wisdom, some not. Some have good wives, some bad ones. Some have kind husbands, some cruel ones. Let us ' go in," as they say, and determine to take success with modesty, and failure with philosophy. It will be all the same to us a hundred years hence. A good way to get out of a bad scrape, is it not? Here I am, who have suffered all the agonies of composition, displayed all the symptoms of the vanity fever, and been possessed with the itching devil of scribbling time out of mind. Here I am, perhaps a dead failure. Why should I not establish my school    <pb n="510-511" xml:id="VAC6560-00000264"/> i510      DREAMS WITHN DREAMS. of philosophy? I am sure I will have followers enough, and enemies enough, to set me up for life. I war with false rea- soning, which would elevate dulness to the rank of genius. I am willing cheerfully to sacrifice my own work, the child of my brains, like Agamemnon, if the Calchas, criticism, declares the gods will never be satisfied until the offering is given. I war with Jones and his class. I war with Robinson and his class. I say to the public, There is my work; faulty, I know -but my best. If you like it. buy it; if you don't, leave it alone. If I haven't wings, I can't fly; and what is the use of pretending to be an eagle, when all the world knows you are only a goose? "Ay, but you don't believe it yourself, you know," I hear some irreverent person remark. "You are only making a vir- tue of necessity." Of course I am. Why not make a virtue of necessity? When a fort is reduced by starvation, does not the commander surrender? Of course I make a virtue of necessity. "Well, then, don't make such a fuss about it," perhaps the same irreverent person may add. My dear friend, I am not making any fuss at all. It is you who are making the fuss yourself. I am abusing Jones. I am abusing Robinson. Remember that Jones and Robinson are only allegorical persons-only representatives of a class. This is my last chance of having a talk with the dear reader, and I wish to raise myself in his or her estimation. Do not talk to me, I pray you. You are simply uttering absurdities, and com- mitting yourself-unintentionally, I trust. But, at the same time, I pray you, do not talk to me. No, no. My object is not to talk nonsense, even if I do. Here let me array before my mind's eye a goodly multitude of readers. The luxury is cheap enough, goodness knows. If I am never to pass through the outworks even of publication; if I am to see writtelA, on the gate at which I tremblingly knock for admission to the great temple of criticism, Dante's motto: "' You, that enter here, leave hope behind!" if I can have no other hearers than fancy's crowd, no other admirers than the cohorts of vanity, no other applause than the clap- pings of self-conceit, let me at least revel awhile in supposing myself read, talked about, and questioned. Let me reply to each and every one in form and manner following; that is to say: Come you first, my pretty ex-Miss Proserpine. I know   DREAMS WITHN DREAMS.        5" your sad fate, and have long had compassion for you-a purely Platonic compassion, upon my word. I recollect very well how we all pitied you, when you were forced to marry Colonel Pluto; and especially the indignation of your good mother, Madame Ceres d'Eleusis. Your enemies, especially those whom fate hath framed to form our better moieties, have always said you caught him very nicely. No, no; I know better. It is true, he is as rich as Croesus; but then he is as ugly as the devil. Now young ladies never marry ugly men only because they are rich. Therefore you are acquitted on internal evi- dence, and the charge is judged baseless, frivolous, and ma- licious. Well, my dear Miss Proserpine-now Mrs. Colonel Pluto-let us hear what you have to say. You don't like the episode of Claude and Cecilia, don't you? Oh, Mrs. Pluto I Mrs. Pluto! Have you not wooed and won a coronet? Are you not queen of a realm-a wee gloomy, perhaps-and monarch of all you survey, except your husband? Cannot you let me patronize Cecilia, and make her a governor's wife? But she took a walk, very improperly, in the woods, with a perfect stranger. Oh, Mrs. Pluto! Mrs. Pluto I Have I not-I, your Platonic admirer--it is only Pla- tonic, I thank my stars-have I not seen you whirling round a ballroom, with the arm of an almost stranger round your waist? Oh, fie, Mrs. Pluto! What if mamma was present? What if papa approved? Has not custom been sometimes wrong? No?  Well, then, the custom of Dreamland author- izes walks in the woods. You don't see it? I never expected you would. I never calculate upon catching a woman with such chaff as logic. Who was the sage who wrote: "When a woman says she will, she will-you may depend on't; And when she says she won't, she won't-and there s an end on't"? Oh! wise sage who said that.   What a mighty power is woman's will! Did not the serpent know it in the garden of Eden? Now I hear a voice cry, Shame! I turn, and see my old chum Pygmalion. Ah, Pygmalion! how do you do? Come to hear my book read? Ay, ay; that's right. How are all the folks at home? Any news stirring? What make you from Cyprus? A truant disposition? I would not hear your enemy speak so.  You wish to confute my observations? Very well. I shall be most happy to hear, any day, from my    <pb n="512-513" xml:id="VAC6560-00000265"/> 512       DREAMS WITHN DREAMS. good friend Pygmalion. Take a seat, and do not hesitate to fire away. You speak from experience?   Good. And pray, what experience? Only your wife? Just so. And pray, who was shle, when a spinster? A - statue? Nonsense I You are laughing at me. "No, I am not," replies Pygmalion. "I made a perfectly beautiful statue. I fell in love with it. I prayed to Jupiter. He vivified it. I married it, and have been happy ever since."  Well, you are a good soul, Pygmalion, and deserve to be blessed in the wife of your choice. But I really cannot see, although I am open to conviction, what the deuce this has to do with my observations. Will you have the goodness to en. lighten me on the subject? "Certainly," replies Pygmalion. 'u My dear Ulric, logic is about as suitable to women as beefsteak is for a cow's break- fast You are too hard on the sweet creatures. Upon my word, you are too hard. Eve's case, I confess, is a strong fortress for men to fall back upon, when they war with the female portion of society. But it has always struck me, as a matter of private judgment, that Adam was not wholly fault- less. You, of course, are entitled to your opinion; but I abso- lutely must protest against this habit the lords of creation have of poking everything on the fair sex. I must, really. Will you take a pinch? Ah, you don't take snuff. Really, now? A bad habit, to be sure."7 Now Pygmalion is right and wrong at the same time. Goodness knows, if men and women begin recrimination, it is only the old story of the pot calling the kettle black. But this equally applies to women abusing women. If men are more reasonable, women are more loving. Intellect governs the one, sentiment the other. So far, so good. I will even admit that Pygmalion's way of moulding his wife to suit himself, and lov- ing her afterward, and believing blindly in her, is a manly, gen- erous spirit, more likely to improve the sex than by sneering at them. So let Mrs. Pluto stand, with her faults and virtues. All this means, of course, that I desire the reader to be equally charitable to me. Whether strict logic would deduce this conclusion from the premises or not, is another question. In writing a dream, I do not feel myself obliged to be coherent -although many, doubtless, of my acquaintances, will follow- my ideas out to their proper development. As for strangers, why, they ought to thank me for presenting them with a work   DREAMS WrrITHN DREAMS.       513 not at all calculated to keep their brains on a stretch; and just the one (if interesting) for a lazy, hot day in July, when calm- ness produces drowsiness, and meditation must not be ruffled by abstruse thought. HAPTER LII. RELATING HOW A CONVERSATION OCCURRED AT THE CASTLE, AND HOW IT WAS SADLY INTERRUPTED. Two or three days after the burial of the old Professor, Clovis returned, one evening, to the castle from Rochateau. He was met by Nora, as he entered the hall. The Benedic- tine abbot had arrived an hour before, she said, and was now at the bedside of the old monk. "His illness has taken a dangerous turn," continued Nora, sadly. "He is sometimes quite out of his senses. It is dis- tressing to see the abbot's grief. He seems to accuse himself of his old friend's death." While she was speaking, Sir Wolfgang came down. He looked very grave. "It will be best, Clovis," he said, "for you and myself to sit up to-night. We do not know what may happen, or how soon we may be wanted." "The Countess desires to speak to you, Lady Nora," said Gabriel, coming softly up to that lady. Nora at once went up stairs. "The abbot has come, I hear," said Clovis. "Yes," replied Sir Wolfgang. "Poor man! When he rode up to the door, the first question he asked, after dismount- ing, was how Brother Stanislaus was. It was a sad sight to see the venerable man, upon hearing it, sit down on the steps, cover his face with his hands, and cry so bitterly." "Nora tells me," said Clovis, "that he accuses himself of being the cause of Brother Stanislaus's death." "Yes, indeed," answered Sir Wolfgang; " although, God knows, he has no cause for self-reproach. You see, when I called upon Brother Stanislaus at the convent, the abbot came to me, and requested me not to trouble the old man, if my busi- ness could be transacted through a third party. Feeling I had 22*    <pb n="514-515" xml:id="VAC6560-00000266"/> no discretionary power to communicate the secret to a stranger, I told him that I could confide only in the Duke's father. After I saw Margaret TIalles, I returned to the convent, where, under the advice of Brother Stanislaus, we took the abbot into coun- sel. Brother Stanislaus took the ground that, being dead to the world, he should not engage in worldly affairs; quoting the words of St. Basil, ' We are able to give our relations but little help; and our commerce with them troubles the tranquillity and regularity of our life, and .draws us into occasions of sin;' and citing the case of Theodore the abbot, who, when he first took the monastic habit, heard that his mother had obtained leave of his superior, St. Pacomius, to see him. 'Dear father' said Theodore to the saint, 'if you will have me see my mother, give me your warrant beforehand that I shall not be account- able for this visit at the day of judgment.' St. Pacomius was unwilling to give it, and left the matter for Theodore to decide, who refused to see his mother." "And what did the abbot reply to that?" inquired Clovis. "He spoke to him," answered Sir Wolfgang, "very gen- tly. 'My son,' he said, 'the case is very different. You only can effect here what is to be done. It is a mission of charity. Willingly, if you require it, will I give you my warrant; and for whatever sin there may be in it, you shall not be held ac- countable.' When he said this, Brother Stanislaus never re- monstrated again. And really, Clovis, I do not know what we should have done without him. You know the Duke. Why, I would hardly have dared whisper the secret to him. Let us sum up the evidence. First, we had Godfroy's story; next, we had the fact that the Count's oldest son, your brother, knew of the affair; next, we had La Chambre's papers; lastly, Ellen's evidence. The case was complete; but, in order to be able to display it properly before the Duke, who is not one of ;hose kind of men one is free to talk with, it was necessary to call n assistance. Piquemont would have done, of course; and so, ndeed, would I, if no better could have been had: but who vas more naturally the person than Uphorn's own father?" "Who, indeed?" assented Clovis. "The abbot had already told me that he always believed Brother Stanislaus's life had been miraculously prolonged for ome especial purpose. Of course, we -cannot call it a miracle a the highest sense of the word, or suppose, for an instant, it vould be so acknowledged at Rome, where they say it takes a airacle to prove a miracle; but I truly believe the old man has   DRIEALMS WITHN DREAMS.       515 been supernaturally preserved for this purpose. It was won- derful to see his intellectual power, when, relieved of scruples, he set himself to work. He wrote his son a letter, placed the evidence in a perfectly clear light before him, in so few words, that, until I read it, I thought the letter was too short; for it hardly took up a page and a half. But when he allowed me to read it through, I was struck with the terseness and force of its expression, and felt how wonderfully he concentrated the whole matter in a short compass. After he gave me the letter, he told me to tell Uphorn that he would meet him at Castle Ber- trand. You know the rest." "And that is why," said Clovis, " the abbot accuses him- self?" "I suppose so," replied Sir Wolfgang. "And what did his grace do, when he read the letter?" inquired Clovis. "Called for his horse," answered Sir Wolfgang, "took my hand, pressed it as if he was going to crush it to jelly, and bade me follow. Follow! By George! it would take a good horse to have kept up with him." My lord Clodolphus now entered, with a cheerful counte- nance. The old man had rallied. The crisis, he trusted, was past. They had every hope of his recovering soon. "We must be very quiet," he said; " but, thank God, we have no more cause to fear." In the great room of state they found Kate, Nora, and Le- titia, Hollar, Godfroy, Prytanis, and Claude, Piquemont, the Duke, and the Countess were watching Brother Stanislaus, with the abbot. Joy was on every face, and marriage was the theme of conversation. I And was not my lord   Clodolphus sly? "Verily," quoth he, "what saith the sage? 'Desine, intu- ensque in aliorum infortunia solare mentem t -Keep still, com- forting thyself, satisfied by the misfortunes of others. Verily am I pleased that Hymen calls me not to the altar." "And verily," replied Godfroy, "some grapes are very sour." "Sinner that I am!" quoth Prytanis; "I truly agree with both of you. Grapes are only sour to those who think them 80." "So you think so, do you?" said my lord Clodolphus. "Yes, I do" replied Prytanis, snappishly. "Well, don't bite me," quoth my lord Clodolphus. "Never fear that," answered Prytanis. "You would not    <pb n="516-517" xml:id="VAC6560-00000267"/> 51 6      DREAMS WITItN DREAMS. be a nice mouthful. You seem to think, somehow, that, when- ever I open my lips, it is to talk nonsense." "' Do I verily present that appearance?" asked my lord Clodolphus, urbanely. "That you do," returned Prytanis. "This," quoth my lord Clodolphus, philosophically, "is one of the most wonderful instances of an honest man seeming to be just what he is. I truly believe, if you had shot at truth for a thousand years, you could not have hit the target more neatly." "Nonsense, indeed!" continued Prytanis, swelling with choler and a sense of injury. "Why, I could give you an opinion on marriage which would deserve to be written in let. ters of gold." "Could you?" said my lord Clodolphils, with a grin. "Well, don't tell us what you could do, but do it." "Let me shadow it forth by a little tale," replied Prytanis. "That is the proper way of going to work, I believe." "I would shadow it, as you say," quoth my lord Clodol. phus, "because your ideas are generally so bright that they dazzle a little: which probably accounts for our never seeing the point, or being able to arrive at any satisfactory conclusion concerning what you have been talking about." "Will you let me go on, or will you not?" asked Pry- tanis. "By all means," replied my lord Clodolphus. "It will prove amusing, I am sure-just as sure as that it will prove nothing else." "Once upon a time, there was," said Prytanis, " three girls. The first was a dark, brunette, brown girl; the second was a light, blonde, fair girl; and the third was a rosy, red, blushing girl. And they had three rooms to sleep in-a dark room for the dark, brunette, brown girl; and a light room for the light, blonde, fair girl; and a rose-colored room for the rosy, red, blushing girl." "Verily beautiful, albeit not original," said my lord Clodol- phus. "You be hanged!" growled Prytanis. I' Why isn't it original?" ' Listen," replied my lord Clodolphus. "Once upon a time there were three bears, who lived together in a house of their own in the woods. One of them was a little, small, wee bear; and one was a .i'ddle-sized bear; and the other was a great,   DREAMS WITIITN DREAMS.       517     huge bear. They had each a pot for their porridge-a little pot for the little, small, wee bear; and a middle-sized pot for the middle bear; and a great pot for the great, huge bear. Don't that strike you as bearing some resemblance to your story?" "Sinner that I am!" answered Prytanis; "I cannot say that I do." "Well," continued my lord Clodolphus, "do you ever eat supper?" "Yes, I do," replied Prytanis. "You will be having the nightmare, then, one of these fine nights," said my lord Clodolphus; "and I will tell you what kind of a nightmare it will be. The three bears will come to your bedside. and mount upon your breast.- 'SOMEBODY HAS BEEN PURLOINING MY STORY I' will say the great huge bear, in his great, rough voice. 'SOMEBODY HAS BEEN PURLOINING MY STORY! will say the middle bear, in her middle voice. 'Somebody has been purloining my story, and I want to eat him up ,!' will say the little, small, wee bear, in his little, small, wee voice. And then you will start up, and jump out of the window, like little Silver-hair." - "Well, sinner that I am!" quoth Prytanis, "I will be blamed if I tell another word." "Why, friend," replied my lord Clodolphus, "you are never as likely to be blamed for silence, as for talking. I never objected to your silence. On the contrary, I have always ap- proved of it hugely." "You be hanged!" growled Prytanis. "No, my friend," answered my lord Clodolphus, "I will not be hanged. Don't let passion warp your fine judgment. Verily are you irritated now-not at all sensibly but then, doing things sensibly is an act you are never guilty of." "You needn't talk so much about me,' quoth Prytanis. "Nobody asked you. Why don't you leave me alone?" "Because," pursued my lord Clodolphus, " to use a phrase much in vogue among the baser portions of society, you will 'put your spoon in,' whenever anybody is talking. Now let me give you a little wholesome advice. Talking is not only the emanation of sound, guttural, palatal, lingual, liquid, dental, sibilant, and labial, for the purpose of uttering articles, sub- stantives, adjectives, pronouns, verbs, adverbs, prepositions, conjunctions, and interjections. No, indeed; although the parts of speech are usefull, at times, for the purpose of express-    <pb n="518-519" xml:id="VAC6560-00000268"/> 518 &amp;DREAMS WITIIN DREAMS.                   l ing our ideas-that is to say, when we have any ideas to ex- press; as ywiss certain people have not. Nor can we even say that the grammatical construction of sentences is the object of speech. If a sentence expresses no idea, it may be parsed, but cannot be comprehended. Thus, if I say, ' Oh! give me Turkey-rhubarb,' for the happy purpose of quickly curing and admonishing horses, and other animalculae,' I have a sentence which I can analyze, thus: The, article; Turkey-rhubarb, pur- pose, horses, and animalcule, nouns substantive; happy, adjective; me, pronoun; give, verb; curing and admonishing, participles present of the verbs to cure and to admonish; quickly, adverb; for and of, prepositions; and, conjunction; oh! interjection. Total, a sentence comprised of the above- mentioned parts of speech. Meaning-none. By Jove! Pry- tanis, this is a fair specimen of nine tenths of all you ever have uttered, sinner that you are, in my presence." "You leave me alone!" said Prytanis. "Now don't you cut in before I have finished my observa- tions," quoth my lord Clodolphus, " because that would not be' polite. You forget I was to give you a little wholesome advice." "Oh, blow your wholesome advice 1 " cried Prytanis. "Miserable wretches that we all are! nobody asked for it. Advice, they say, like medicine and kicks, is given far more readily than received." "This," pursued my lord Clodolphus, mildly, " originates in the mistaken impression most people have that they are capable of counselling; whereas--" "Whereas," interrupted Prytanis, " folks only make them- selves disagreeable, as you are doing now. Will you never have done with your talk? Bow-wow-wow! You bark away like a dog, who, obeying the mysterious instinct of the canine dis- pensation, has conceived an incomprehensible antipathy to the moon." "Then be you verily like the moon," replied my lord Clo- dolphus, " and take no notice of my barking." "I wish you were in the moon," muttered Prytanis. "I do not," quoth my lord Clodolphus, t" and for divers rea- sons; first--" "4 Will nobody stop that man?" asked Prytanis, appealing to the company with a piteous expression of countenance. The others, who had been mightily enjoying the dialogue, here struck in, and screened Prytanis under the aegis of general con- versation.   DREAMS WITHN DREAMS.        519 "Ha I ha! ha!" laughed my lord Clodolphus, as Prytanis left the room, after he had received one or two more attacks like the one we have just described. "I fancy our friend Pry- tanis does not like wholesome advice." "For shame, my lord!" said Kate; "you bear a great deal too hard on the poor fellow." "Nonsense!" quoth my lord Clodolphus. "Verily is that man an Abderite; verily is he a 2XoXaOrr&amp;LKd (which, being translated, is, a simpleton, a booby, a ninnyhammer, a donkey). Indeed, to make a pun in Greek (the which, verily, is of doubt- ful value, since, I trow, the letters K and X should not be pro- nounced alike, albeit one may stretch a point in a pun), he does well in calling himself a worm, since crKoXrk means a worm; a(KwXIrK070KEe, to breed worms; aKo0X(KLov, a little worm; and K(Ko0XAK&amp;O, to be wormeaten.

"Who wants to know about the dogs? If you must talk (and I take that for granted, since you have to do that, or explode), do keep to the point." "What is the point?" asked my lord Clodolphus. --"How can I tell?" replied the Count. "Have you the -faintest idea yourself?" ' "I have," quoth my lord Clodolphus. "Well, fire away, then," growled the Count. Said my lord Clodolphus: "I was speaking of that man, admirably described by the verb (KAoX-yKoToKeo)." "Skolekotokeo, indeed!" growled the Count.

"Prytanis," continued my lord Clodolphus, "is verily a humbug. Sinner that he is, I think he will let me alone for the future. If I hate one thing more than another, it is your talkers." ("Oh, indeed!" sarcastically from the Count.) "' The airs some people put on, is verily amusing. Verily is it not a bad idea on the long run, however.

"Et, praeter eos agnos, meus est isteic clam mordax canis;" which, being translated, is--" "I knew it-I knew it!" groaned the Count. "Verily I forgot," quoth my lord Clodolphus.

"What, then, is the test thing to do?" continued my lord Clodolphus; ignoring the interruption. "What, then, is the best thing to do?

Verily, if you have only the cunning to ex- press a doubt, you will provoke your adversary to defend his thesis, and so make him tell you all about it, without suspect- ing your ignorance-" Here my lord Clodolphus was interrupted by Piquemont, who softly entered the room, and laid his hand on his shoulder. His face was very pale, as he said: "He wants to see you all." F"Flor God's sake, not that!" cried my lord Clodolphus, as they all started, looking at each other with pale faces. "It is God's will," was Piquemont's reply. They all quietly proceeded to the old man's dying bed, but he did not know them. Uphorn was kneeling by his father's side, the only one whose features were recognized by those   DREAMS WITHN DREAMS.    -    521 glazing eyes. In solemn awe the company gathered round the two. "Louis," said the dying man. "Yes, father." "Are there not people near me?"          F "Yes, dear father; your old friends." A sweet smile lighted up the religious' face, as he said, "Good-by." "Not yet, dear father!" cried Uphorn, shrinking back, as the prior began the prayers of the last agony, frequently inter. rupted by the dying man. "In manus tuas, Domine; commendo spiritum meum--" "Behold, a door is opened in heaven, and a voice cries, Come up hither." "' Domilne Jesu Christe, suscipe spiritum meum-" "And the Spirit and the Bride say, Come; and he that heareth, let him say, Come. Amen. Come, Lord Jesus." "Sancta Maria, ora pro me-" "Ut dignus efficiar promissionibus Christi." Turning then to his son, the old man said: "You have a daughter, Louis." "Yes, dear father." "She was lost, was she not?" "Yes, father." "You may find her." "She is found." "Found!" "Yes, father; in the old ruin." "Ay, ay; I remember now. A    stone struck me on the breast. It was very heavy. Why do they not take it off? It is crushing me." "There is no stone there, father." ' So I feel-so I feel. It has sunk into me. You cannot see it, but it presses cruelly on my heart. But your child, Louis?" "What would you with her, father?    Would you see her?" "No. She is sleeping. Waken her not." "Have you any message for her?" "No; I would speak to you, my son."

Yet I would say--" Here he seemed to wander again back to old times, as if the thought of the child brought up associations of his own childhood. Still, through all, he seemed to be laboring to ex- press a thought which he could not call up to his lips. Bending over him, Uphorn saw the struggle, and, bent upon relieving him if he could, said: "You want to speak of my child, father?" "Yes-yes." "You wish to tell me how I should take care of her?" "Yes-yes." "What is your advice?" A beautiful light gleamed from the old monk's eyes, as he sat up in bed, and, with the first return of reason, laid his arm on his son's shoulder, and said, "Louis, save her soul I " Uphorn uttered a loud cry.

It was a fine dream-a little commonplace, perhaps, but we are never over particular in dreams; and I wish to thank you for your politeness. VISHNU.-You have improved since we last met. You are wonderfully more powerful in will than you were before. Permit me to congratulate you on your advancement. MEPH.-True, friend; and, like the rest of mankind, having made a good use of my friends, I intend to cut them adrift as soon as they have power neither to make nor mar me. I have no very great talent for what you call flattery. A great pity, surely, that predestination were not the order of the day. Then might we comfortably pack our sins upon Providence, and play the fool to our heart's content.

The world would die if it had no cause to grum- ble; and then, what would become of our vocation? VIsn.-Are the blue devils so potent? Mi Pn.--Potent? They are all the fashion. The lords and ladies of creation have divided the world into working bees and drones. With the drones, it is a sine qua non to be bored--base. You do not keep your eyes open. White hands, carefully trimmed hair, fine clothes, and a languid look, are all the fashion. One is bored, nowadays, because the church is not in its primitive purity, and all that sort of a thing. Another is languidly affected with scepticism, and doubts 'revelation, you know, and faith." An- other is so very weary, that he relapses into a sort of drowsy state, like a bear, and sucks his paws. Oh by all means, un- chain the blue devils. But that is not for what I sent for you. You must show the end of the dream. Visa.-Must is a very strong word.

Now finish the dreamrn. As it sprang from the blue devils, the Old Harry is interested in its termination. VIsu.-Come, spirits! SPIRITS [without].- We are coming. We come To the sound of the drum, When the soldier marches to battle. We dance on the cloud Of the cannon-the shroud Of a host-'mid the musketry's rattle.    <pb n="528" xml:id="VAC6560-00000273"/> On the corpses so cold Did we feed of old, The relics of warrior fools. On the fruits of the fight We revel at night With the vampires, wolves, and ghouls. And a skeleton host, Each fleshless ghost The spectre of one long dead, At the hour of one Doth howling come To the field of struggle dread: And we dance and we cry Beneath the sky, As the moonlight silvery falls On coffin and shroud  And the ghastly crowd All wrapt in their phantom palls. Their lives we know, Dead long ago, Whose memories are forgotten, For we haunt the tombs Where arise perfumes From the corpses putrid and rotten. Ha! ha! ha! A gay set we are, And we come at thy bidding to thee; But woe to the soul Who cannot control Our strength, when once come we. MEPH.-DO    you take me for a fool?   Send these spirits back. They are behind the age. The devil of the nineteenth century is quite a different character.  No more of that kind of stuff. We must have two spirits, joined by a fleshy tie like the Siamese twins. Let one be sceptical and lascivious; let the other be fanatical and hypocritical. But, as for old temptation, reform it altogether.  Ghosts are no longer respectable, unless they tap, or  move tables._ Talk to some, of the spiritual spheres; to others, pretend the whole thing is a humbug. If a man tends to faith, make the devil out a superstition, if you can; and if you cannot, give him an overdose of the supernatural.   If a man is naturally sceptical, by all means keep him  so. I love to possess those kind of men.   A laugh, look you, will refute a revelation.    <pb n="Illustration-529" xml:id="VAC6560-00000274"/> ;- The Printers beg the reader's sympathy.

Lady Gertrude grew up a lovely girl, and became the beauty of the court. She was finally  married to the cousin of the reigning monarch; but never, in her greatness, did she forget her early and faithful protector. Once every year she visited his grave, and once every year was a solemn requiem mass offered for him in the Villaburg cathedral, by the Benedictine abbot. She had a number of children; the oldest of whom, with her noble husband's consent, she called by the name of the old Professor. AUTn.-And the Count and Countess? TIME.-The Count lived at Bertriand Castle for many years, as excitable and fussy as ever. His hens were his joy and trouble to the very last day of his mortal career. He and the Countess jogged along hand in hand, and died within a week of each other. The Count gave himself great credit for having found out the parentage of Lady Gertrude, and bragged prodigiously of the same all the rest of his life; although nobody ever found out on what ground he based his assumption. When Lady Gertrude came, each year, on her mournful visit, he entertained her at the castle; and, conceiving a large ball appropriate to the occasion, invariably invited all the country round to meet her; when there would be roisterous merriment, masks, and goodness knows what all. AUTH. -What of Clovis and Nora? TiME.-Clovis and Nora were married a month after the death of Brother Stanislaus. In the course of time, they became Count and Countess of Bertrand. Clovis learned of Albert's death, and caused a search to be made for his body. It was found, at last, and privately buried. La Chambre's body was never discovered. Clovis and Nora lived happily together for many years, and kept up all the old customs of the castle. And they were long remem- bered by the peasantry as " the good Count and Countess." AUTH.-What of Godfroy and Kate? TIME.-They were married by Father Wilfrid at the same time as Clovis and Nora. A month after, they had a grand entertain- ment at Rochateau, where there was a masquerade. Everybody acknowledged that Lady Rochateau was a decided improvement to the place, and had certainly given them a better reception than her husband did in his bachelor days. But this, Godfroy's wife never acknowledged; always replying that the originality of the    THE EPILOGUE.          531 great reception was its chief attraction, and that she could not improve upon it, try how she would. Godfroy and Kate, I need not say, lived happily together. They were half their time on horseback; and people used to say, after the old Count's death, that it was difficult to say whether the Bertrands lived at Rocha- teau, ol the Rochateaus at Bertrand. Godfroy and Kate rivalled Clovis and Nora in their number of children,-each having seven; and two each side married two on the other, I know. - AUTH.-Now let me hear of Hollar and Letitia. TIME.--That story is soon told. They were married, and went to court. Hollar became a great politician, and held high office. Twice a year they visited Rochateau, and there was always a royal reception. At a turn of fortune's wheel, Hollar lost his office, and retired from public life in disgust. He then lived with his wife and children far more happily than he ever did amid the toils of politics. He became philosophic as he grew older, and used to invite my lord Clodolphus to his castle. The chief trouble of his meditations was how he and his old friend Hans had been deceived, in their memorable escape from prison, by the circular walls of the riding school. He never obtained a satisfac- tory solution of the question, and never visited Bertrand Castle without going down to the cellar, and gravely examining it with  a lamp. ArTTH.-You spoke of my lord Clodolphus. What was his subsequent history? TIME.--He remained the same to the end. Being a bachelor, and wont to talk, lie spent his time in visiting and receiving visits. When Iollar retired from public life, he was a great deal at his house. He was also welcomed at Castle Bertrand, where he and the old Count would have fearful discussions sometimes. Clovis and Nora were both attached to him for his sterling kindness, and especially his conduct when Albert tried to throw suspicion on tile meeting between Nora and ler father. Old Piquemont re- turned to his castle soon after; but, becoming lonely, it was agreed that he should take up his quarters one half the year at Bertrand, and the other half live at home, where Clovis and Nora should visit him. But this did not last long. He died soon after his child's marriage, and was buried amid the tears of all the noble crowd who followed him to his grave.

AUTH.-And Ardor and his friend Simplicius? TImE. -In due course of time they returned to their native place, and married the fair objects of their aspirations. AuTI.-Were they friends afterward?. TIME.-I beg your pardon. AUTH.-Were they friends afterward? TIE.-Kind of friends; just about as usual. AUTH. -And Ubald? TImE.-He and Rosalia lived very happily; lived (as they say in story books) in peace, and died in a pot of grease. AUTn.-In a what? TIME.--In a pot of grease. AUTH.--Oh, indeed! And Sir Prytanis? TIME.-Would you believe it, that he and my lord Clodolphus became sworn friends? Such was the case, however, nevertheless. Some intimacies begin in dislike. Ah, I have seen that often. But, whatever may be the rule or the exception, this happened. They visited, together, every object worth seeing; made a journey to Italy, and returned so full of quotations, that the old Qount said he wished Italy had been buried beneath the Mediterranean. However, he never objected to the couple visiting Bertrand, al- though he had to sustain a double discharge of quotations. He used to console himself by setting the one on the other, and that was a comfort. Sir Prytanis's days were brought to a sudden end by exposure to the night air, in his enthusiasm to view the effect of moonlight on a fountain in the neighborhood. AUTH.-What of Claude and Cecilia? ' TIME.-Claude married Cecilia, and they lived happily. They had issue, to wit, six sons-Charles, Clovis, Clodolphus, Godfroy, Wolfgang, and Prytanis; and six daughters-Nora, Catharine, Letitia, Gertrude, Isabelle, and Cecilia. AUTH.-Named, I suppose, after our friends. TiE.--Precisely. You have judged most properly. Who else attracts your attention? AUTI.-- Many yet, I promise you. Tell me first of Sir Wolf- gang de Verle.   THE EPILOGUE.          533 TrIE.-As the uncle of Lady Gertrude, he accompanied the Duke of Uphorn to court. Ellen also went in his suite, although the Duke could never forget the tragedy played by her sister. She lived until she died in Sir Wolfgang's household. The knight, however, did not long survive his old nurse. He fell, fighting bravely, at the siege of Perpignan. All his property he left to Lady Gertrude, in trust for her second son, Wolfgang, his godson. AUTL.-And now, if you please, for our friends, Squire Flint and Doctor Owen. TIME.-Willingly. Squire Flint and his wife lived at Bertrand peacefully all their lives; where the Squire, after the termination of the war, turned his sword into a pruning hook, and became a great agriculturist, with a farm where there was no end of pigs, sheep, poultry, horses, cows, oxen, calves, dogs, cats, and the deuce knows what. MEtPH.-No. The deuce knows nothing about it, friend Time. TIME [proceeding without regarding the last observation].-The lad Owen, with his wife and a numberless crowd of children, continued to occupy their old quarters, and to visit their old friends. 'The Doctor, having gained a large practice, acquired a large fortune, and eventually bought a farm adjoining that of his friend Flint; where he also revelled in a large number of pigs, sheep, poultry, horses, cows, oxen, calves, dogs, cats, and the deuce knows what. MEPH i-No, my dear friend. The deuce knows nothing about it, I assure you. TIME [as before, disregarding the interruption of MEPHSTOPlHE- "ES].-Have you any more questions to put, my friend? AUTH.--Certainly. What of the wretched little man, and his friend Smaragdus? TMrE.-Smaragdus and Ebenezer, after completing the work which called them to Bertrand, went about their business. They still hunted in couples, and the wretched little man was wont to tell the story of the old ruin, with variations, to any one who would listen to him; unless interrupted, as he sometimes was, by his fat companion cracking him over the head, and saying, "You be still." AUTH.--And now for Ernest Toservem, the innkeeper, Peter Cutter, the barber, Solomon Coffin, the sexton, Jonathan Sewell, the tailor, and Samson Shuttle, the weaver.    <pb n="534-535" xml:id="VAC6560-00000277"/> 534         THE EPILOGIUE TIME.-All the same as ever.
