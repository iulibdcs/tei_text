                  <p>FIRELIGHT falling on soft velvet carpet, where white lily buds trail along
                     azure ground, on chairs of white-polished wood that glitters like ivory, with
                     puffy of seats of blue satin; on blue and gilt panelled walls; on a wonderfully
                     carved oaken ceiling; on sweeping draperies of blue satin and white lace; on
                     half a dozen lovely pictures; on an open piano; and last of all, on the
                     handsome, angry face of a girl who stands before it—Inez Catheron.</p>
                  <p>The month is August—the day the 29th—Miss Catheron has good reason to remember
                     it to the last day of her life. But, whether the August sun blazes, or the
                     January winds howl, the great rooms of Catheron Royals are ever chilly. So on
                     the white-tiled hearth of the blue drawing-room this summer evening a coal fire
                     flickers and falls, and the mistress of Catheron Royals stands before it, an
                     angry flush burning deep red on either dusk cheek, an angry frown contracting
                     her straight black brows.</p>
                  <p>The mistress of Catheron Royals,—the biggest, oldest, queerest, grandest place
                     in all sunny Cheshire,—this slim, dark girl of nineteen, for three years past
                     the bride-elect of Sir Victor Catheron, baronet, the last of his Saxon race and
                     name, the lord of all these sunny acres, this noble Norman pile, the smiling
                     village of Catheron below. The master of<pb n="10-11" xml:id="VAC6448-00000005"
                     /> a stately park in Devon, a moor and "bothy" in the high-lands, a villa on
                     the Arno, a gem of a cottage in the Isle of Wight. "A darling of the gods,"
                     young, handsome, healthy; and best of all, with twenty thousand a year.</p>
                  <p>She is his bride-elect. In her dark way she is very handsome. She is to be
                     married to Sir Victor early in the next month, and she is as much in love with
                     him as it is at all possible to be. A fair fate surely. And yet while the
                     August night shuts down, while the wind whistles in the trees, while the long
                     fingers of the elm, just outside the window, tap in a ghostly way on the pane,
                     she stands here, flushed, angry, impatient, and sullen, her handsome lips set
                     in a tight, rigid line.</p>
                  <p>She is very dark at all times. Her cousin Victor tells her, laughingly, she is
                     an absolute nigger when in one of her silent rages. She has jet-black hair, and
                     big, brilliant, Spanish eyes. She <emph>is</emph> Spanish. Her dead mother was
                     a Castilian, and that mother has left her her Spanish name, her beautiful,
                     passionate Spanish eyes, her hot, passionate Spanish heart. In Old Castile Inez
                     was born; and when in her tenth year her English father followed his wife to
                     the grave, Inez came home to Catheron Royals, to reign there, a little,
                     imperious, hot-tempered Morisco princess ever since.</p>
                  <p>She did not come alone. A big boy of twelve, with a shock head of blue-black
                     hair, two wild, glittering black eyes, and a diabolically handsome face, came
                     with her. It was her only brother Juan, an imp incarnate from his cradle.
                        <emph>He</emph> did not remain long. To the unspeakable relief of the
                     neighborhood for miles around, he had vanished as suddenly as he had come, and
                     for years was seen no more.</p>
                  <p>A Moorish Princess! It is her cousin and lover's favorite name for her, and it
                     fits well. There is a certain barbaric splendor about her as she stands here in
                     the firelight, in her trailing purple silk, in the cross of rubies and fine
                     gold that burns on her bosom, in the yellow, perfumy rose in her hair, looking
                     stately, and beautiful, and dreadfully out of temper.</p>
                  <p>The big, lonesome house is as still as a tomb. Outside the wind is rising, and
                     the heavy patter, patter, of the rain-beats on the glass. That, and the light
                     fall of the cinders in the polished grate, are the only sounds to be heard.</p>
                  <p>A clock on the mantel strikes seven. She has not stirred for nearly an hour,
                     but she looks up now, her black eyes full of passionate anger, passionate
                     impatience.</p>
                  <p>"Seven!" she says, in a suppressed sort of voice; "and he should have been here
                     at six. What if he should defy me?—what if he does not come after all?"</p>
                  <p>She can remain still no longer. She walks across the room, and she walks as
                     only Spanish women do. She draws back one of the window curtains, and leans out
                     into the night. The crushed sweetness of the rain-beaten roses floats up to her
                     in the wet darkness. Nothing to be seen but the vague tossing of the trees,
                     nothing to be heard but the soughing of the wind, nothing to be felt but the
                     fast and still faster failing of the rain.</p>
                  <p>She lets the curtain fall, and returns to the fire.</p>
                  <p>"Will he dare defy me?" she whispers to herself. "Will he dare stay away?"</p>
                  <p>There are two pictures hanging over the mantel—she looks up at them as she asks
                     the question. One is the sweet, patient face of a woman of thirty; the other,
                     the smiling face of a fair-haired, blue-eyed, good-looking lad. It is a
                        <emph>very</emph> pleasant face; the blue eyes look at you so brightly, so
                     frankly; the boyish mouth is so sweet-tempered and laughing that you smile back
                     and fall in love with him at sight. It is Sir. Victor Catheron and his late
                     mother.</p>
                  <p>Miss Inez Catheron is in many respects an extraordinary young lady—Cheshire
                     society has long ago decided that. They would have been more convinced of it
                     than ever, could they have seen her turn now to Lady Catheron's portrait and
                     appeal to it aloud in impassioned words:</p>
                  <p>"On his knees, by your dying bed, by your dying command, he vowed to love and
                     cherish me always—as he did then. Let him take care how he trifles with that
                     vow—let him take care!"</p>
                  <p>She lifts one hand (on which rubies and diamonds flash) menacingly, then stops.
                     Over the sweep of the storm, the rush of the rain, comes another sound—a sound
                     she has been listening for, longing for, praying for—the rapid roll of carriage
                     wheels up the drive. There can be but one visitor to Catheron Royals to-night,
                     at this hour and in this storm—its master.</p>
                  <p>She stands still as a stone, white as a statue, waiting. She<pb n="12-13"
                        xml:id="VAC6448-00000006"/> loves him; she has hungered and thirsted for the
                     sound of his voice, the sight of his face, the clasp of his hand, all these
                     weary, lonely months. In some way it is her life or death she is to take from
                     his hands to-night. And now he is here.</p>
                  <p>She hears the great hall-door open and close with a clang; she hears the step
                     of the master in the hall—a quick, assured tread she would know among a
                     thousand; she hears a voice—a hearty, pleasant, manly, English voice; a cheery
                     laugh she remembers well.</p>
                  <q>
                     <p>"The Chief of Lara has returned again."</p>
                  </q>
                  <p>The quick, excitable blood leaps up from her heart to her face in a rosy rush
                     that makes her lovely. The eyes light, the lips part—she takes a step forward,
                     all anger, all fear, all neglect forgotten—a girl in love going to meet her
                     lover. The door is flung wide by an impetuous hand, and wet and splashed, and
                     tall and smiling, Sir Victor Catheron stands before her.</p>
                  <p>"My dearest Inez!"</p>
                  <p>He comes forward, puts his arm around her, and touches his blonde mustache to
                     her flushed cheek.</p>
                  <p>"My dearest coz, I'm awfully glad to see you again, and looking so uncommonly
                     well too." He puts up his eye-glass to make sure of this fact, then drops it.
                     "Uncommonly well," he repeats; "give you my word I never saw you looking half a
                     quarter so handsome before in my life. Ah! why can't we all be Moorish
                     princesses, and wear purple silks and yellow roses?"</p>
                  <p>He flings himself into an easy-chair before the fire, throws back his blonde
                     head, and stretches forth his boots to the blaze.</p>
                  <p>"An hour after time, am I not? But blame the railway people—don't blame
                        <emph>me.</emph> Beastly sort of weather for the last week of August—cold as
                     Iceland and raining cats and dogs; the very dickens of a storm, I can tell
                     you."</p>
                  <p>He give the fire a poke, the light leaps up and illumines his handsome face. He
                     is very like his picture—a little older—a little worn-looking, and with man's
                     "crowning glory," a mustache. The girl has moved a little away from him, the
                     flush of "beauty's bright transcient glow" has died out of her face, the hard,
                     angry look has come back. That careless kiss, that easy, cousinly embrace, have
                     told their story. A moment ago her heart beat high with hope—to the day of her
                     death it never beat like that again.</p>
                  <p>He doesn't look at her; he gazes at the fire instead, and talks with the hurry
                     of a nervous man. The handsome face is a very effeminate face, and not even the
                     light, carefully trained, carefully waxed mustache can hide the weak,
                     irresolute mouth, the delicate, characterless chin. While he talks carelessly
                     and quickly, while his slim white fingers loop and unloop his watch-chain, in
                     the blue eyes fixed upon the fire there is an uneasy look of nervous fear. And
                     into the keeping of this man the girl with the dark, powerful face has given
                     her heart, her fate!</p>
                  <p>"It seems no end good to be at home again," Sir Victor Catheron says, as if
                     afraid of that brief pause. "You've no idea, Inez, how uncommonly familiar and
                     jolly this blue room, this red fire, looked a moment ago, as I stepped out of
                     the darkness and rain. It brings back the old times—this used to be
                        <emph>her</emph> favorite morning-room," he glanced at the mother's picture,
                     "and summer and winter a fire always burned here, as now. And you, Inez,
                        <foreign xml:lang="ITA">cara mia</foreign>, with your gypsy face, most
                     familiar of all."</p>
                  <p>She moves over to the mantel. It is very low; she <choice>
                        <sic>leanes</sic>
                        <corr>leans</corr>
                     </choice> one arm upon it, looks steadily at him, and speaks at last.</p>
                  <p>"I am glad Sir Victor Catheron can remember the old times, can still recall his
                     mother, has a slight regard left for Catheron Royals, and am humbly grateful
                     for his recollection of his gypsy cousin. From his conduct of late it was
                     hardly to have been expected."</p>
                  <p>"It is coming," thinks Sir Victor, with an inward groan; "and, O Lord!
                        <emph>what</emph> a row it is going to be. When Inez shuts her lips up in
                     that tight line, and snaps her black eyes in that unpleasant way, I know to my
                     cost, it means 'war to the knife.' I'll be routed with dreadful slaughter, and
                     Inez's motto is ever, 'Woe to the conqueror!' Well, here goes!"</p>
                  <p>He looks up at her, a good-humored smile on his good-looking face.</p>
                  <p>"Humbly grateful for my recollection of you! My<pb n="14-15"
                        xml:id="VAC6448-00000007"/> dear Inez, I don't know what you mean. As for my
                     absence—"</p>
                  <p>"As for your absence," she interrupts, "you were to have been here, if your
                     memory will serve you, on the first of June. It is now the close of August.
                     Every day of that absence has been an added insult to me. Even now you would
                     not have been here if I had not written you a letter you dare not neglect—sent
                     a command you dare not disobey. You are here to-night because you dare not stay
                     away."</p>
                  <p>Some of the bold blood of the stern old Saxon race from which he sprung is in
                     his veins still. He looks at her full, still smiling.</p>
                  <p>"Dare not!" he repeats. "You use strong language, Inez. But then you have an
                     excitable sort of nature, and were ever inclined to hyperbole; and it is a
                     lady's privilege to talk."</p>
                  <p>"And a man's to act. But I begin to think Sir Victor Catheron is something less
                     than a man. The Catheron blood has bred many an outlaw, many bitter, bad men,
                     but to day I begin to think it has bred something infinitely worse—a traitor
                     and a coward!"</p>
                  <p>He half springs up, his eyes flashing, then falls back, looks at the fire
                     again, and laughs.</p>
                  <p>"Meaning me?"</p>
                  <p>"Meaning you."</p>
                  <p>"Strong language once more—you assert your prerogative royally, my handsome
                     cousin. From whom did you inherit that two-edged tongue of yours, Inez, I
                     wonder? Your Castilian mother, surely; the women of our house were never
                     shrews. And even <emph>you</emph>, my dear, may go a little too far. Will you
                     drop vituperation and explain? How have I been traitor and coward? It is well
                     we should understand each other fully."</p>
                  <p>He has grown pale, though he speaks quietly, and his blue eyes gleam
                     dangerously. He is always quiet when most angry.</p>
                  <p>"It is. And we shall understand each other fully before we part—be very sure of
                     that. You shall learn what I have inherited from my Castilian mother. You shall
                     learn whether you are to play fast and loose with me at your sovereign will.
                     Does your excellent memory still serve you, or must I tell you what day the
                     twenty-third of September is to be?"</p>
                  <p>He looks up at her, still pale, that smile on his lips, that gleam in his
                     eyes.</p>
                  <p>"My memory serves me perfectly," he answers coolly; "it was to have been our
                     wedding-day."</p>
                  <p>
                     <emph>Was to have been.</emph> As he speaks the words coldly, almost cruelly,
                     as she looks in his face, the last trace of color leaves her own. The hot fire
                     dies out of her eyes, an awful terror comes in its place. With all her heart,
                     all her strength, she loves the man she so bitterly reproaches. It seems to her
                     she can look back upon no time in which her love for him is not.</p>
                  <p>And now, it <emph>was</emph> to have been!</p>
                  <p>She turns so ghastly that he springs to his feet in alarm.</p>
                  <p>"Good Heaven, Inez! you're not going to faint, are you? Don't! Here, take my
                     chair, and for pity's sake don't look like that. I'm a wretch, a brute—what was
                     it I said? Do sit down."</p>
                  <p>He has taken her in his arms. In the days that are gone he has been very fond,
                     and a little afraid of his gipsy cousin. He is afraid still—horribly afraid, if
                     the truth must be told, now that his momentary anger is gone.</p>
                  <p>All the scorn, all the defiance has died out of her voice when she speaks
                     again. The great, solemn eyes transfix him with a look he cannot meet.</p>
                  <p>"<emph>Was to have been</emph>," she repeats, in a sort of whisper; "was to
                     have been. Victor, does that mean it never <emph>is</emph> to be?"</p>
                  <p>He turns away, shame, remorse, fear in his averted face. He holds the back of
                     the chair with one hand, she clings to the other as though it held her last
                     hope in life.</p>
                  <p>"Take time," she says, in the same slow, whispering way. "I can wait. I have
                     waited so long, what does a few minutes more matter now? But think well before
                     you speak—there is more at stake than you know of. My whole future life hangs
                     on your words. A woman's life. Have you ever thought what that implies? 'Was to
                     have been,' you said. Does that mean it never is to be?"</p>
                  <pb n="16-17" xml:id="VAC6448-00000008"/>
                  <p>Still no reply. He holds the back of the chair, his face averted, a criminal
                     before his judge.</p>
                  <p>"And while you think," she goes on, in that slow, sweet voice, "let me recall
                     the past. Do you remember, Victor, the day when I and Juan came here from
                     Spain? Do you remember me? I recall you as plainly at this moment as though it
                     were but yesterday—a little, flaxen-haired, blue-eyed boy in violet velvet,
                     unlike any child I had ever seen before. I saw a woman with a face like an
                     angel, who took me in her arms, and kissed me, and cried over me, for my
                     father's sake. We grew up together, Victor, you and I, such happy, happy years,
                     and I was sixteen, you twenty. And all that time you had my whole heart. Then
                     came our first great sorrow, your mother's death."</p>
                  <p>She pauses a moment. Still he stands silent, but his left hand has gone up and
                     covers his face.</p>
                  <p>"You remember that last night, Victor—the night she died. No need to ask you;
                     whatever you may forget, you are not likely to forget <emph>that</emph>. We
                     knelt together by her bedside. It was as this is, a stormy summer night.
                     Outside, the rain beat and the wind blew; inside, the stillness of death was
                     everywhere. We knelt alone in the dimly-lit room, side by side, to receive her
                     last blessing—her dying wish. Victor, my cousin, do you recall what that wish
                     was?"</p>
                  <p>She holds out her arms to him, all her heart breaking forth in the cry. But he
                     will neither look nor stir.</p>
                  <p>"With her dying hands she joined ours, her dying eyes looking at
                        <emph>you</emph>. With her dying lips she spoke to you: 'Inez is dearer to
                     me than all the world, Victor, except you. She must never face the world alone.
                     My son, you love her—promise me you will cherish and protect her always. She
                     loves you as no one else ever will. Promise me, Victor, that in three years
                     from to-night you will make her your wife.' These were her words. And you took
                     her hand, covered it with tears and kisses, and promised.</p>
                  <p>"We buried her," Inez went on, "and we parted. You went up to Oxford; I went
                     over to a Paris <foreign xml:lang="FRA">pensionnat</foreign>. In the hour of
                     our parting we went up together hand in hand to her room. We kissed the pillow
                     where her dying head had lain; we knelt by her bedside as we had done that
                     other night. You placed this ring upon my finger; sleeping or waking it has
                     never left it since, and you repeated your vow, that that night three years, on
                     the twenty-third of September, I should be your wife."</p>
                  <p>She lifts the betrothal ring to her lips, and kisses it. "Dear little ring,"
                     she says softly, "it has been my one comfort all these years. Though all your
                     coldness, all your neglect for the last year and a half, I have looked at it,
                     and known you would never break your plighted word to the living and the
                     dead.</p>
                  <p>"I came home from school a year ago. <emph>You</emph> were not here to meet and
                     welcome me. You never came. You fixed the first of June for your coming, and
                     you broke your word. Do I tire you with all these details, Victor? But I must
                     speak to-night. It will be for the last time—you will never give me cause
                     again. Of the whispered slanders that have reached me I do not speak; I do not
                     believe them. Weak you may be, fickle you may be, but you are a gentleman of
                     loyal race and blood; you will keep your plighted troth. Oh, forgive me,
                     Victor! Why do you make me say such things to you? I hate myself for them, but
                     your neglect has driven me nearly wild. What have I done?" Again she stretches
                     forth her hands in eloquent appeal. "See! I love you. What more can I say? I
                     forgive all the past; I ask no questions. I believe nothing of the horrible
                     stories they try to tell me. Only come back to me. If I lose you I shall
                     die."</p>
                  <p>Her face is transfigured as she speaks—her hands still stretched out.</p>
                  <p>"O Victor, come!" she says; "let the past be dead and forgotten. My darling,
                     come back!"</p>
                  <p>But he shrinks away as those soft hands touch him, and pushes her off.</p>
                  <p>"Let me go!" he cries; "don't touch me, Inez! It can never be. You don't know
                     what you ask!"</p>
                  <p>He stands confronting her now, pale as herself, with eyes alight. She recoils
                     like one who has received a blow.</p>
                  <p>"Can never be?" she repeats.</p>
                  <p>"Can never be!" he answers. "I am what you have called me, Inez, a traitor and
                     a coward. I stand here perjured before God, and you, and my dead mother. It
                        can<pb n="18-19" xml:id="VAC6448-00000009"/> never be. I can never marry
                     you. I am married already!"</p>
                  <p>The blow has fallen—the horrible, brutal blow. She stands looking at him—she
                     hardly seems to comprehend. There is a pause—the firelight flickers, they hear
                     the rain lashing the windows, the soughing of the gale in the trees. Then
                     Victor Catheron bursts forth:</p>
                  <p>"I don't ask you to forgive me—it is past all that. I make no excuse; the deed
                     is done. I met her, and I loved her. She has been my wife for sixteen months,
                     and—there is a son. Inez, don't look at me like that! I am a scoundrel, I know,
                     but—"</p>
                  <p>He breaks down—the sight of her face unmans him. He turns away, his heart
                     beating horribly thick. How long the ghastly pause that follows lasts he never
                     knows—a century, counting by what he undergoes. Once, during that pause, he
                     sees her fixed eyes turn slowly to his mother's picture—he hears low,
                     strange-sounding words drop from her lips:</p>
                  <p>"He swore by your dying bed, and see how he keeps his oath!"</p>
                  <p>Then the life that seems to have died from her face flames back. Without
                     speaking to him, without looking at him, she turns to leave the room. On the
                     threshold she pauses and looks back.</p>
                  <p>"A wife and a son," she says, slowly and distinctly. "Sir Victor Catheron,
                     fetch them home; I shall be glad to see them."</p>

                  <head>CHAPTER II.</head>
                  <head type="sub">WIFE AND HEIR.</head>
                  <p>IN a very genteel lodging-house, in the very genteel neighborhood of Russell
                     Square, early in the afternoon of a September day, a young girl stands
                     impatiently awaiting the return of Sir Victor Catheron. This girl is his
                     wife.</p>
                  <p>It is a bright, sunny day—as sunny, at least, as a London day ever can make up
                     its mind to be—and as the yellow, slanting rays pour in through the muslin
                     curtains full on face and figure, you may search and find no flaw in either. It
                     is a very lovely face, a very graceful, though petite figure. She is a blonde
                     of the blondest type: her hair is like spun gold, and, wonderful to relate, no
                     Yellow Wash: no Golden Fluid, has ever touched its shining abundance. Her eyes
                     are bluer than the September sky over the Russell Square chimney-pots; her nose
                     is neither aquiline nor Grecian, but it is very nice; her forehead is low, her
                     mouth and chin "morsels for the gods." The little figure is deliciously rounded
                     and ripe; in twenty years from now she may be a heavy British matron, with a
                     yard and a half wide waist—at eighteen years old she is, in one word,
                     perfection.</p>
                  <p>Her dress is perfection also. She wears a white India muslin, a marvel of
                     delicate embroidery and exquisite texture, and a great deal of Valenciennes
                     trimming. She has a pearl and turquoise star fastening her lace collar, pearl
                     and turquois drops in her ears, and a half dozen diamond rings on her plump,
                     boneless fingers. A blue ribbon knots up the loose yellow hair, and you may
                     search the big city from end to end, and find nothing fairer, fresher, sweeter
                     than Ethel, Lady Catheron.</p>
                  <p>If ever a gentleman and a baronet had a fair and sufficient excuse for the
                     folly of a low marriage, surely Sir Victor Catheron has it in this fairy
                     wife—for it is a "low marriage" of the most heinous type. Just seventeen months
                     ago, sauntering idly along the summer sands, looking listlessly at the summer
                     sea, thinking drearily that this time next year his freedom would be over, and
                     his Cousin Inez his lawful owner and possessor, his eyes had fallen on that
                     lovely blonde face—that wealth of shining hair, and for all time—aye, for
                     eternity—his fate was fixed. The dark image of Inez as his wife faded out of
                     his mind, never to return more.</p>
                  <p>The earthly name of this dazzling divinity in yellow ringlets and pink muslin
                     was Ethel Margaretta—Dobb!</p>
                  <p>Dobb! It might have disenchanted a less rapturous adorer—it fell powerless on
                     Sir Victor Catheron's infatuated ear.</p>
                  <p>It was at Margate this meeting took place—that most<pb n="20-21"
                        xml:id="VAC6448-00000010"/> popular and most vulgar of all English
                     watering-places; and the Cheshire baronet had looked just once at the
                     peach-bloom face, the blue eyes of laughing light, the blushing, dimpling,
                     seventeen-year-old face, and fallen in love at once and forever.</p>
                  <p>He was a very impetuous young man, a very selfish and unstable young man, with
                     whom, all his life, to wish was to have. He had been spoiled by a doting mother
                     from his cradle, spoiled by obsequious servants, spoiled by Inez Catheron's
                     boundless worship. And he wished for this "rose of the rose-bud garden of
                     girls" as he had never wished for anything in his two-and-twenty years of life.
                     As a man in a dream he went through that magic ceremony, "Miss Dobb, allow me
                     to present my friend, Sir Victor Catheron," and they were free to look at each
                     other, talk to each other, fall in love with each other as much as they
                     pleased. As in a dream he lingered by her side three golden hours, as in a
                     dream he said, "Good afternoon," and walked back to his hotel smoking a cigar,
                     the world glorified above and about him. As in a dream they told him she was
                     the only daughter and heiress of a well-to-do London soap-boiler, and he did
                     not wake.</p>
                  <p>She was the daughter of a soap-boiler. The paternal manufactory was in the
                     grimiest part of the grimy metropolis; but, remarkable to say, she had as much
                     innate pride, self-respect, and delicacy as though "all the blood of all the
                     Howards" flowed in those blue veins.</p>
                  <p>He wasn't a bad sort of young fellow, as young fellows go, and frantically in
                     love. There was but one question to ask, just eight days after this—"Will you
                     be my wife?"—but one answer, of course—"Yes."</p>
                  <p>But one answer, of course! How would it be possible for a soap-boiler's
                     daughter to refuse a baronet? And yet his heart had beaten with a fear that
                     turned him dizzy and sick as he asked it; for she had shrunk away for one
                     instant, frightened by his fiery wooing, and the sweet face had grown suddenly
                     and startlingly pale. Is it not the rule that all maidens shall blush when
                     their lovers ask <emph>the</emph> question of questions?</p>
                  <p>The rosy brightness, the smiles, the dimples, all faded out of this face, and a
                     white look of sudden fear crossed it. The startled eyes had shrunk from his
                     eager, flushed face and looked over the wide sea. For fully five minutes she
                     never spoke or stirred. To his dying day that hour was with him—his passionate
                     love, his sick, horrible fear, his dizzy rapture, when she spoke at last, only
                     one word—"yes." To his dying day he saw her as he saw her then, in her summery
                     muslin dress, her gipsy hat, the pale, troubled look chasing the color from the
                     drooping face.</p>
                  <p>But the answer was "yes." Was he not a baronet? Was she not a well-trained
                     English girl? And the ecstasy of pride, of joy, of that city soap-boiler's
                     family, who shall paint? "Awake my muse" and—but, no! it passeth all telling.
                     They bowed down before him (figuratively), this good British tradesman and his
                     fat wife, and worshipped him. They burned incense at his shrine; they adored
                     the ground he walked on; they snubbed their neighbors, and held their chins at
                     an altitude never attained by the family of Dobb before. And in six weeks Miss
                     Ethel Dobb became Lady Catheron.</p>
                  <p>It was the quietest, the dullest, the most secret of weddings—not a soul
                     present except Papa and Mamma Dobb, a military swell in the grenadier
                     guards—Pythias, at present, to Sir Victor's Damon—the parson, and the
                     pew-opener. He was madly in love, but he was ashamed of the family
                     soap-boiling, and he was afraid of his cousin Inez.</p>
                  <p>He told them a vague story enough of family matters, etc., that rendered
                     secrecy for the present necessary, and nobody cross-questioned the baronet.
                     That the parson was a parson, the marriage <foreign xml:lang="LAT">bona
                        fide</foreign>, his daughter "my lady," and himself the prospective
                     grandfather of many baronets, was enough for the honest soap-boiler.</p>
                  <p>For the bride herself, she said little, in a shy, faltering little way. She was
                     very fond of her dashing, high-born, impulsive lover, and very well content not
                     to come into the full blaze and dazzle of high life just yet. If any other
                     romance had ever figured in her simple life, <emph>the</emph> story was
                     finished and done with, the book read and put away.</p>
                  <p>He took her to Switzerland, to Germany, to Southern France, keeping well out of
                     the way of other tourists, and ten months followed—ten months of such
                     exquisite, unalloyed bliss, as rarely falls to mortal man. Unalloyed, did I<pb
                        n="22-23" xml:id="VAC6448-00000011"/> say? Well, not quite, since earth and
                     heaven are two different places. In the dead of pale Southern nights, with the
                     shine of the moon on his wife's lovely sleeping face; in the hot, brilliant
                     noontide; in the sweet, green gloaming—Inez Catheron's black eyes came
                     menacingly before him—the one bitter drop in his cup. All his life he had been
                     a little afraid of her. He was something more than a little afraid of her
                     now.</p>
                  <p>They returned. The commodious lodgings in Russell Square awaited him, and Sir
                     Victor "went in" for domestic felicity in the parish of Bloomsbury, "on the
                     quiet." Very much "on the quiet"—no theatre going, no opera, no visitors, and
                     big Captain Jack Erroll, of the Second Grenadiers, his only guest. Four months
                     of this sort of thing, and then—and then there was a son.</p>
                  <p>Lying in her lace-draped, satin-covered bed, looking at baby's fat little,
                     funny little face, Ethel, Lady Catheron, began to think. She had time to think
                     in her quiet and solitude. Monthly nurses and husbands being in the very nature
                     of things antagonistic, and nurse being reigning potentate at present, the
                     husband was banished. And Lady Catheron grew hot and indignant that the heir of
                     Catheron Royals should have to be born in London lodgings, and the mistress of
                     Catheron Royals live shut up like a nun, or a fair Rosamond in a bower.</p>
                  <p>"You have no relations living but your cousin, Victor," she said to him, more
                     coldly than she had ever spoken in her life. "Are you master in your own house,
                     or is she? Are you afraid of this Miss Catheron, who writes you such long
                     letters (which I never see), that you dare not take your wife home?"</p>
                  <p>He had told her something of that other story necessarily—his former engagement
                     to his cousin, Inez. Only something—not the bare ugly truth of his own
                     treachery. The soap-boiler's daughter was more noble of soul than the baronet.
                     Gentle as she was, she would have despised him thoroughly had she known the
                     truth.</p>
                  <p>"This secrecy has lasted long enough," Lady Catheron-said, a resolute-looking
                     expression crossing her pretty, soft-cut mouth. "The time has come when you
                     must speak. Don't make me think you are ashamed of me, or afraid of her. Take
                     me home—it is my right; acknowledge your son—it is <emph>his</emph>. When there
                     was only I, it did not so much matter—it is different now."</p>
                  <p>She lifted one of baby's dots of hands, and kissed it. And Sir Victor, his face
                     hidden in the shadow of the curtains, his voice husky, made answer:</p>
                  <p>"You are right, Ethel—you always are. As soon as you both can travel, my wife
                     and child shall come home with me to Catheron Royals."</p>
                  <p>Just three weeks later, as the August days were ending, came that last letter
                     from Inez, commanding his return. His hour had come. He took the next morning
                     train, and went forth to meet the woman he feared and had wronged.</p>
                  <milestone n="* * * * * * * * *" unit="typography"/>
                  <p>The afternoon sun drops lower. If Sir Victor returns from Cheshire to-day, Lady
                     Catheron knows he will be here in a few minutes. She looked at her watch a
                     little wearily. The days are very long and lonely without him. Looks up again,
                     her eyes alight. A hansom has dashed up to the door, and it is her husband who
                     leaps out. Half a minute and he is in the room, and she is clasped in his
                     arms.</p>
                  <p>"My darling!" he exclaims, and you need only hear the two words to tell how
                     rapturously he loves his wife. "Let me look at you. Oh! as pale as ever, I see.
                     Never mind! Cheshire air, sunshine, green fields, and new milk shall bring back
                     your roses. And your son and heir, my lady, how is he?"</p>
                  <p>He bends over the pretty bassinet, with that absurd paternal look all
                        <emph>very</emph> new fathers regard the first blessing, and his mustache
                     tickles baby's innocent nose.</p>
                  <p>A flush comes into her face. She looks at him eagerly.</p>
                  <p>"At last! Oh, Victor, when do we go?"</p>
                  <p>"To-morrow, if you are able. The sooner the better."</p>
                  <p>He says it with rather a forced laugh. Her face clouds a little.</p>
                  <p>"And your cousin? Was she <emph>very</emph> angry!" she asked, wistfully;
                        "<emph>very</emph> much surprised?"</p>
                  <p>"Well—yes—naturally, I am afraid she was both. We must make the best of that,
                     however. To tell the truth, I had only one interview with her, and that of so
                     particularly unpleasant a nature, that I left next morning. So then we<pb
                        n="24-25" xml:id="VAC6448-00000012"/> start to-morrow? I'll just drop a line
                     to Erroll to apprise him."</p>
                  <p>He catches hold of his wife's writing-table to wheel it near. By some
                     clumsiness his foot catches in one of its spidery claws, and with a crash it
                     topples over. Away goes the writing case, flying open and scattering the
                     contents far and wide. The crash shocks baby's nerves, baby begins to cry, and
                     the new-made mamma flies to her angel's side.</p>
                  <p>"I say!" Sir Victor cries. "Look here! Awkward thing of me to do, eh, Ethel?
                     Writing case broken too. Never mind, I'll pick 'em up."</p>
                  <p>He goes down on his knees boyishly, and begins gathering them up. Letters,
                     envelopes, wax, seals, pens and pencils. He flings all in a heap in the broken
                     case. Lady Catheron cooing to baby, looks smilingly on. Suddenly he comes to a
                     full stop.</p>
                  <p>Comes to a full stop, and holds something before him as though it were a snake.
                     A very harmless snake apparently—the photograph of a young and handsome-man.
                     For fully a minute he gazes at it utterly aghast. "Good Heaven!" his wife hears
                     him say.</p>
                  <p>Holding baby in her arms she glances at him. The back of the picture is toward
                     her, but she recognizes it. Her face turns ashen gray—she moves round and bends
                     it over baby.</p>
                  <p>"Ethel!" Sir Victor says, his voice stern, "what does this mean?"</p>
                  <p>"What does what mean? Hush-h-h baby, darling. Not so loud, Victor, please. I
                     wan't to get babe asleep."</p>
                  <p>"How comes Juan Catheron's picture here?"</p>
                  <p>She catches her breath—the tone, in which Sir Victor speaks, is a tone not
                     pleasant to hear. She is a thoroughly good little thing, but the best of little
                     things (being women) are <foreign xml:lang="LAT">ergo</foreign> dissemblers.
                     For a second she dares not face him; then she comes bravely up to time and
                     looks at him over her shoulder.</p>
                  <p>"Juan Catheron! Oh, to be sure. Is that picture here yet?" with a little laugh.
                     "I thought I had lost it centuries ago." "Good Heaven!" she exclaims inwardly;
                     "how <emph>could</emph> I have been such a fool!"</p>
                  <p>Sir Victor rises to his feet—a curious passing likeness to his dark cousin,
                     Inez, on his fair blonde face. "Then you know Juan Catheron. <emph>You!</emph>
                     And you never told me."</p>
                  <p>"My dear Sir Victor," with a little pout, "don't be unreasonable. I should have
                     something to do, if I put you <foreign xml:lang="FRA">au courant</foreign> of
                     all my acquaintances. I knew Mr. Catheron—slightly," with a gasp. "Is there any
                     crime in that?"</p>
                  <p>"Yes!" Sir Victor answers, in a voice that makes his wife jump and his son cry.
                     "Yes—there is. I wouldn't own a dog—if Juan Catheron had owned him before me.
                     To look at him, is pollution enough—to know him—disgrace!"</p>
                  <p>"Victor! Disgrace!"</p>
                  <p>"Disgrace, Ethel! He is one of the vilest, most profligate, most lost wretches
                     that ever disgraced a good name. Ethel, I command you to tell me—was this man
                     ever anything to you—friend—lover—what?"</p>
                  <p>"And if he has been—what then?" She rises and faces him proudly. "Am I to
                     answer for his sins?"</p>
                  <p>"Yes—we all must answer more or less for those who are our friends. How come
                     you to have his picture? What has he been to you? Not your lover—for Heaven's
                     sake, Ethel, never <emph>that!</emph>"</p>
                  <p>"And why not? Mind!" she says, still facing him, her blue eyes aglitter, "I
                     don't say that he was, but <emph>if</emph> he was—what then?"</p>
                  <p>"What then?" He is white to the lips with jealous rage and fear. "This
                        then—<emph>you should never again be wife of mine!</emph>"</p>
                  <p>"Victor!" she puts out her hands as if to ward off a blow, "don't say that—oh,
                     don't say that! And—and it isn't true—he never was a lover of mine—never,
                     never!"</p>
                  <p>She bursts out with the denial in passionate fear and trembling. In all her
                     wedded life she has never seen him look, heard him speak like this, though she
                     has seen him jealous—needlessly—often.</p>
                  <p>"He never was your lover? You are telling me the truth?"</p>
                  <p>"No, no—never! never, Victor—don't look like that! Oh, what brought that
                     wretched picture here! I knew him slightly—only that—and he <emph>did</emph>
                     give me his photograph. How could I tell he was the wretch you say he is—how<pb
                        n="26-27" xml:id="VAC6448-00000013"/> could I think there would be any harm
                     in taking a picture? He seemed nice, Victor. What did he ever do?"</p>
                  <p>"He seemed nice!" Sir Victor repeated, bitterly; "and what did he ever do? What
                     has he left undone you had better ask. He has broken every command of the
                     decalogue—every law human and divine. He is dead to us all—his sister included,
                     and has been these many years. Ethel, can I believe—"</p>
                  <p>"I have told you, Sir Victor. You will believe as you please," his wife
                     answers, a little sullenly, turning away from him.</p>
                  <p>She understands him. His very jealousy and anger are born of his passionate
                     love for her. To grieve her is torture to him, yet he grieves her often.</p>
                  <p>For a tradesman's daughter to marry a baronet may be but one remove from
                     paradise; still it is a remove. And the serpent in Lady Catheron's Eden is the
                     ugliest and most vicious of all serpents—jealousy. He has never shown his green
                     eyes and obnoxious claws so palpably before, and as Sir Victor looks at her
                     bending over her baby, his fierce paroxysm of jealousy gives way to a fierce
                     paroxysm of love.</p>
                  <p>"Oh, Ethel, forgive me!" he says; "I did not mean to wound you, but the thought
                     of that man—faugh! But I am a fool to be jealous of you, my white lily. Kiss
                     me—forgive me—we'll throw this snake in the grass out of the window and forget
                     it. Only—I had rather you had told me."</p>
                  <p>He tears up the wretched little mischief-making picture, and flings it out of
                     the window with a look of disgust. Then they "kiss and make up," but the stab
                     has been given, and will rankle. The folly of her past is doing its work, as
                     all our follies past and present are pretty sure to do.</p>

                  <head>CHAPTER III.</head>
                  <head type="sub">HOW LADY CATHERON CAME HOME.</head>
                  <p>LATE in the afternoon of a September day Sir Victor Catheron, of Catheron
                     Royals, brought home his wife and son.</p>
                  <p>His wife and son! The county stood astounded. And it had been a dead secret.
                     Dreadful! And Inez Catheron was jilted? Shocking! And <emph>she</emph> was a
                     soap-boiler's daughter? Horrible! And now when this wretched, misguided young
                     man could keep his folly a secret no longer, he was bringing his wife and child
                     home.</p>
                  <p>The resident gentry sat thunderstruck. Did he expect they could call? (This was
                     the gentler sex.) Plutocracy might jostle aristocracy into the background, but
                     the line must be drawn somewhere, and the daughter of a London soap-boiler they
                     would not receive. Who was to be positive there had been a marriage at all. And
                     poor Inez Catheron! Ah it was very sad—very sad. There was a well-known,
                     well-hidden taint of insanity in the Catheron family. It must be that latent
                     insanity cropping up. The young man must simply be mad.</p>
                  <p>Nevertheless bells rung and bonfires blazed, tenantry cheered, and all the old
                     servants (with Mrs. Marsh, the housekeeper, and Mr. Hooper, the butler, at
                     their head) were drawn up in formidable array to receive them. And if both
                     husband and wife were very pale, very silent, and very nervous, who is to blame
                     them? Sir Victor had set society at defiance; it was society's turn now, and
                     then—there was Inez!</p>
                  <p>For Lady Catheron, the dark, menacing figure of her husband's cousin haunted
                     her, too. As the big, turreted, towered, ivied pile of stone and mortar called
                     Catheron Royals, with its great bell booming, its Union Jack waving, reared up
                     before the soap-boiler's daughter—she absolutely cowered with a dread that had
                     no name.</p>
                  <p>"I am afraid!" she said. "Oh, Victor, I am afraid!"</p>
                  <p>He laughed—not quite naturally, though. If the painful<pb n="28-29"
                        xml:id="VAC6448-00000014"/> truth must be told of a baronet and a Catheron,
                     Sir Victor was afraid, too.</p>
                  <p>"Afraid?" he laughed; "of what, Ethel? The ghost of the Gray Lady, who walks
                     twice in every year in Rupert's Tower? Like all fine old families, we have our
                     fine old family ghost, and would not part with it for the world. I'll tell you
                     the legend some day; at present 'screw your courage to the sticking place,' for
                     here we are."</p>
                  <p>He descended from the carriage, and walked into the grand manorial hall, vast
                     enough to have lodged a hundred men, his wife on his arm, his head very high,
                     his face very pale. She clung to him, poor child! and yet she battled hard for
                     her dignity, too. Hat in hand, smiling right and left in the old pleasant way,
                     he shook hands with Mrs. Marsh and Mr. Hooper, presented them to my lady, and
                     bravely inquired for Miss Inez. Miss Inez was well, and awaiting him in the
                     Cedar drawing-room.</p>
                  <p>They ascended to the Cedar drawing-room, one of the grandest rooms in the
                     house, all gilding and ormolu, and magnificent upholstery—Master Baby following
                     in the arms of his nurse. The sweet face and soft eyes of Lady Catheron had
                     done their work already in the ranks of the servants—she would be an easier
                     mistress to serve than Miss Inez.</p>
                  <p>"If she ever <emph>is</emph> mistress in her own house," thought Mrs. Marsh,
                     who was "companion" to Miss Catheron as well as housekeeper; "and mistress she
                     never will be while Miss Catheron is at the Royals."</p>
                  <p>The drawing-room was brilliantly lit, and standing in the full glare of the
                     lamps—Inez. She was gorgeous this evening in maize silk, that was like woven
                     sunshine; she had a white camelia in her hair, a diamond cross on her breast,
                     scented laces about her, diamonds on her arms and in her ears. So she stood—a
                     resplendent vision—so Sir Victor beheld her again.</p>
                  <p>He put up his hand for an instant like one who is dazzled—then he led forward
                     his wife, as men have led on a forlorn hope.</p>
                  <p>"My cousin," he said, "my wife; Inez, this is Ethel."</p>
                  <p>There was a certain pathos in the simplicity of the words, in the tone of his
                     voice, in the look of his eyes. And as some <emph>very</emph> uplifted young
                     empress might bow to the lowliest of her handmaidens, Miss Catheron bowed to
                     Lady Catheron.</p>
                  <p>"Ethel," she repeated, a smile on her lips, "a pretty name, and a pretty face.
                     I congratulate you on your taste, Victor. And this is the baby—I must look at
                     him."</p>
                  <p>There was an insufferable insolence in the smile, an insufferable sneer in the
                     compliment. Ethel had half extended a timid hand—Victor had wholly extended a
                     pleading one. She took not the slightest notice of either. She lifted the white
                     veil, and looked down at the sleeping baby.</p>
                  <p>"The heir of Catheron Royals," she said, "and a fine baby no doubt, as babies
                     go. I don't pretend to be a judge. He is very bald and very flabby, and very
                     fat just at present. Whom does he resemble? Not you, Victor. O, no doubt the
                     distaff side of the house. What do you call him, nurse? Not christened yet? But
                     of course the heir of the house is always christened at Catheron Royals.
                     Victor, no doubt you'll follow the habit of your ancestors, and give him his
                     mother's family name. <emph>Your</emph> mother was the daughter of a marquis,
                     and you are Victor St. Albans Catheron. Good customs should not be dropped—let
                     your son's name be Victor <emph>Dobb</emph> Catheron."</p>
                  <p>She laughed as she dropped the veil, a laugh that made all the blood in Sir
                     Victor's body tingle in his face. But he stood silent. And it was Ethel who, to
                     the surprise of every one, her husband included, turned upon Miss Catheron with
                     flashing eyes and flushing cheeks.</p>
                  <p>"And suppose, he is christened Victor Dobb Catheron, what then? It is an honest
                     English name, of which none of my family have ever had reason to feel ashamed.
                     My husband's mother may have been the daughter of a marquis—my son's mother is
                     the daughter of a tradesman—the name that has been good enough for me will be
                     good enough for him. I have yet to learn there is any disgrace in honest
                     trade."</p>
                  <p>Miss Catheron smiled once more, a smile more stinging than words.</p>
                  <p>"No doubt. You have many things yet to learn, I am quite sure. Victor, tell
                     your wife that, however dulcet her voice may be, it would sound sweeter if not
                     raised so <emph>very</emph> high. Of course, it is to be expected—I make every
                        allowance<pb n="30-31" xml:id="VAC6448-00000015"/> ance, poor child, for the
                     failings of her—class. The dressing-bell is ringing, dinner in an hour, until
                        then—<foreign xml:lang="FRA">au revoir</foreign>."</p>
                  <p>Still with that most insolent smile she bows low once more, and in her gold
                     silk, her Spanish laces, her diamonds and splendor, Miss Catheron swept out of
                     the room.</p>
                  <p>And this was Ethel's welcome home.</p>
                  <milestone n="* * * * * * * * * *" unit="typography"/>
                  <p>Just two hours later, a young man came walking briskly up the long avenue
                     leading to the great portico entrance of Catheron Royals. The night was dark,
                     except for the chill white stars—here under the arching oaks and elms not even
                     the starlight shone. But neither for the darkness nor loneliness cared this
                     young man. With his hands in his pockets he went along at a swinging pace,
                     whistling cheerily. He was very tall; he walked with a swagger. You could make
                     out no more in the darkness.</p>
                  <p>The great house loomed up before him, huge, black, grand, a row of lights all
                     along the first floor. The young man stopped his whistling, and looked up with
                     a smile not pleasant to see.</p>
                  <p>"Four years ago," he said, between his teeth, "you flung me from your door like
                     a dog, most noble baronet, and you swore to lodge me in Chesholm jail if I ever
                     presumed to come back. And I swore to pay you off if I ever had a chance.
                     To-night the chance has come, thanks to the girl who jilted me. You're a young
                     man of uncommonly high stomach, my baronet, proud as the deuce and jealous as
                     the devil. I'll give your pride and your jealousy a chance to show themselves
                     to-night."</p>
                  <p>He lifted the massive brass knocker, and brought it down with a clang that
                     echoed through the house. Then he began whistling again, watching those
                     lighted, lace-draped windows.</p>
                  <p>"And to think," he was saying inwardly, "to think of our little Ethel being
                     mistress here. On my word it's a lift in life for the soap-boiler's pretty
                     daughter. I wonder what they're all about up there now, and how Inez takes it.
                     I should think there must have been the dickens to pay when she heard it
                     first."</p>
                  <p>The heavy door swung back, and a dignified elderly gentleman tleman, in black
                     broadcloth and silk stockings, stood gazing at the intruder. The young man
                     stepped from the outer darkness into the lighted vestibule, and the elderly
                     gentleman fell back with a cry.</p>
                  <p>"Master Juan!"</p>
                  <p>"<emph>Mister</emph> Juan, Hooper, if you please—<emph>Mister</emph> Juan.
                     William, my old cockalorum, my last rose of summer, how goes it?"</p>
                  <p>He grasped the family butler's hand with a jolly laugh, and gave it a shake
                     that brought tears of torture to its owner's eyes. In the blaze of the hall
                     chandelier he stood revealed, a big fellow, with eyes and hair raven black, and
                     a bold, bronzed face.</p>
                  <p>"What, Villiam! friend of my childhood's days, 'none knew thee but to love
                     thee, none named thee but to praise'—not a word of welcome? Stricken dumb at
                     sight of the prodigal son! I say! Where's the rest? The baronet, you know, and
                     my sister, and the new wife and kid? In the dining-room?"</p>
                  <p>"In the dining-room," Mr. Hooper is but just able to gasp, as with horror
                     pictured on his face he falls back.</p>
                  <p>"All right, then. Don't fatigue your venerable shanks preceding me. I know the
                     way. Bless you, William, bless you, and be happy!"</p>
                  <p>He bounces up the stairs, this lively young man, and the next instant, hat in
                     hand, stands in the large, handsome, brilliantly lit dining-room. They are
                     still lingering over the dessert, and with a simultaneous cry, and as if by one
                     impulse, the three start to their feet and stand confounded. The young man
                     strikes a tragic theatrical attitude.</p>
                  <p>"Scene—dining-room of the reprobate 'Don Giovanni'—tremulo music, lights half
                        down—<emph>enter</emph> statue of virtuous Don Pedro." He breaks into a
                     rollicking laugh and changes his tone for that of every-day life. "Didn't
                     expect me, did you?" he says, addressing everybody. "Joyful surprise, isn't it?
                     Inez, how do? Baronet, your humble servant. Sorry to intrude, but I've been
                     told my wife is here, and I've come after her, naturally. And here she is.
                     Ethel, my darling, who'd have thought of seeing <emph>you</emph> at Catheron
                     Royals, an honored guest? Give us a kiss, my angel, and say you're glad to see
                     your scrapegrace husband back."</p>

                  <p>He strides forward and has her in his arms before any one can speak. He stoops
                     his black bearded face to kiss her; just as with a gasping sob, her golden head
                     falls on his shoulder and she faints dead away.</p>

                  <p>WITH a cry that is like nothing human, Sir Victor Catheron leaps forward and
                     tears his fainting wife out of the grasp of the black-bronzed, bearded,
                     piratical-looking young man.</p>
                  <p>"You villain!" he shouts, hoarse with amaze and fury; "stand back, or by the
                     living Lord I'll have your life! You scoundrel, how dare you lay hands on my
                     wife!"</p>
                  <p>"Your wife! Yours! Come now, I like that! It's against the law of this
                     narrow-minded country for a woman to have two husbands. You're a magistrate and
                     ought to know. Don't call names, and do keep your temper—violent language is
                     unbecoming a gentleman and a baronet. Inez, what does he mean by calling Ethel
                     his wife?"</p>
                  <p>"She is his wife," Inez answers, her black eyes glittering.</p>
                  <p>"Oh, but I'll be hanged if she is. She's mine—mine hard and fast, by jingo.
                     There's some little misunderstanding here. Keep your temper, baronet, and let
                     us clear it up. <emph>I</emph> married Miss Ethel Dobb in Glasgow, on the
                     thirteenth of May, two years ago. Now, Sir Victor Catheron, when did
                        <emph>you</emph> marry her."</p>
                  <p>Sir Victor made no answer; his face, as he stood supporting his wife, was
                     ghastly with rage and fear. Ethel lay like one dead; Juan Catheron, still
                     eminently good-humored and self-possessed, turned to his sister:</p>
                  <p>"Look here, Inez, this is how it stands: Miss Dobb was only fifteen when I met
                     her first. It was in Scotland. We fell in love with each other; it was the
                     suddenest case of spoons you ever saw. We exchanged pictures, we vowed vows, we
                     did the 'meet me by moonlight alone' business— you know the programme yourself.
                     The time came to part—Ethel to return to school, I to sail for the China
                     Sea—and the day we left Scotland we went into church and were married. There! I
                     don't deny we parted at the church door, and have never met since, but she's my
                     wife; mine, baronet, by Jove! since the first marriage is the legal one. Come,
                     now! You <emph>don't</emph> mean to say that you've been and married another
                     fellow's wife. 'Pon my word, you know I shouldn't have believed it of
                     Ethel."</p>
                  <p>"She is reviving," Inez said.</p>
                  <p>She spoke quietly, but her eyes were shining like black stars. She knew her
                     brother for a liar of old, but what if this were true? what if her vengeance
                     were here so soon? She held a glass of iced champagne to the white lips.</p>
                  <p>"Drink!" she said, authoritatively, and Ethel mechanically drank. Then the blue
                     eyes opened, and she stood erect in Sir Victor's arms.</p>
                  <p>"Oh, what is it?" she said. "What has happened?"</p>
                  <p>Her eyes fell upon the dark intruder, and with a cry of fear, a shudder of
                     repulsion, her hands flew up and covered her face.</p>
                  <p>"Don't be afraid, my darling," Sir Victor said, holding her close, and looking
                     with flashing, defiant eyes at his enemy; "this coward has told a monstrous
                     falsehood. Deny it, my love. I ask no more, and my servants shall kick him
                     out."</p>
                  <p>"Oh, shall they!" said Mr. Catheron; "well, we'll see. Now, Ethel, look here. I
                     don't understand this business, you know. What does Sir Victor mean by calling
                     you his wife? It isn't possible you've gone and committed bigamy—there
                        <emph>must</emph> be a mistake. You are my wife, and as such I claim
                     you."</p>
                  <p>"Ethel, you hear that," Sir Victor cried in a voice of agony; "for Heaven's
                     sake speak! The sight of this fellow—the sound of his voice is driving me mad.
                     Speak and deny this horrible charge."</p>
                  <p>"She can't," said Juan Catheron!</p>
                  <p>"I can! I do!" exclaimed Ethel, starting up with flushing face and kindling
                     eyes; "It is a monstrous lie. Victor! O, Victor, send him away! It isn't
                     true—it isn't, it isn't!"</p>
                  <pb n="34-35" xml:id="VAC6448-00000017"/>
                  <p>"Hold on, Sir Victor," Mr. Catheron, interposed, "let me ask this young lady a
                     question or two. Ethel, do you remember May, two years ago in Scotland? Look at
                     this picture; it's yours, isn't it? Look at this ring on my little finger; you
                     gave it to me, didn't you? Think of the little Glasgow presbytery where we went
                     through the ceremony, and deny that I'm your husband, if you can."</p>
                  <p>But her blood was up—gentle, yielding, timid, she had yet a spirit of her own,
                     and her share of British "pluck."</p>
                  <p>She faced her accuser like a small, fair-haired lioness, her eyes flashing blue
                     fire.</p>
                  <p>"I do deny it! You wretch, how dare you come here with such a lie!" She turned
                     her back upon him with a scorn under which even he winced. "Victor!" she cried,
                     lifting her clasped hands to her husband, "hear me and forgive me if you can. I
                     have done wrong—wrong—but I—I was afraid, and I thought he was drowned. I
                     wanted to tell you all—I did, indeed, but papa and mamma were afraid—afraid of
                     losing you, Victor. I told you a falsehood about the photograph—he, that
                     wretch, did give it to me, and—" her face drooped with a bitter sob—"he was my
                     lover then, years ago, in Scotland."</p>
                  <p>"Ah!" quoted Mr. Catheron, "truth is mighty and will prevail! Tell it, Ethel;
                     the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth."</p>
                  <p>"Silence, sir!" Lady <choice>
                        <sic>Cameron</sic>
                        <corr>Catheron</corr>
                     </choice> cried, "and don't dare call me Ethel. I was only fifteen,
                     Victor—think of it, a child of fifteen, spending my holidays in Glasgow when I
                     met him. And he dared to make love to me. It amused him for the
                     time—representing himself as a sort of banished prince, a nobleman in disguise.
                     He took my silly, girlish fancy for the time. What did I at fifteen know of
                     love? The day I was to return home, we exchanged pictures and rings, and he
                     took me out for a last walk. He led me into a solitary chapel, and made me join
                     hands and pledge myself to be his wife. There was not a soul in the place but
                     ourselves. As we left it we met papa. We shook hands and parted, and until this
                     hour I have never since set eyes on his face. Victor, don't blame me too
                     much—think what a child I was—remember I was afraid of him. The instant he was
                     out of my sight I disliked him. He wrote to me—I never answered his letters,
                     except once, and then it was to return his, and tell him to trouble me no more.
                     That is all. O Victor! don't look like that! I am sorry—I am sorry. Forgive me
                     or I shall die."</p>
                  <p>He was ashen white, but there was a dignity about him that awed into silence
                     even the easy assurance of Juan Catheron. He stooped and kissed the tear-wet,
                     passionate, pleading face.</p>
                  <p>"I believe you," he said; "your only fault was in not telling me long ago.
                     Don't cry, and sit down."</p>
                  <p>He placed her in a chair, walked over, and confronted his cousin.</p>
                  <p>"Juan Catheron," he said, "you are a slanderer and a scoundrel, as you always
                     were. Leave this house, and never, whilst I live, set your foot across its
                     threshold. Five years ago you committed a forgery of my name for three thousand
                     pounds. I turned you out of Catheron Royals and let you go. I hold that forged
                     check yet. Enter this house again, repeat your infamous lie, and you shall rot
                     in Chesholm jail! I spared you then for your sister's sake—for the name you
                     bear and disgrace—but come here again and defame my wife, and I'll transport
                     you though you were my brother. Now go, and never come back."</p>
                  <p>He walked to the door and flung it wide. Juan Catheron stood and looked at him,
                     his admirable good-humor unruffled, something like genuine admiration in his
                     face.</p>
                  <p>"By Jupiter!" he exclaimed, "who'd have thought it! Such a milk-sop as he used
                     to be! Well, baronet, I don't deny you got the upper hand of me in that
                     unpleasant little affair of the forgery, and Portland Island with a chain on my
                     leg and hard labor for twenty years I don't particularly crave. Of course, if
                     Ethel won't come, she won't, but I say again it's deuced shabby treatment.
                     Because, baronet, that sort of thing <emph>is</emph> a marriage in Scotland,
                     say what you like. I suppose it's natural she should prefer the owner of
                     Catheron Royals and twenty thousand per annum, to a poor devil of a sailor like
                     me; but all the same it's hard lines. Good-by, Inez—be sisterly, can't you, and
                     come and see a fellow. I'm stopping at the 'Ring o' Bells,' in Chesholm.
                     Good-by, Ethel. 'Thou hast learned to love another, thou hast broken<pb
                        n="36-37" xml:id="VAC6448-00000018"/> every vow,' but you might shake hands
                     for the sake of old times. You won't—well, then, good-by without. The next time
                     I marry I'll make sure of my wife."</p>
                  <p>He swaggered out of the room, giving Sir Victor a friendly and forgiving nod,
                     flung his wide-awake on his black curls, clattered down the stairs and out of
                     the house.</p>
                  <p>"By-by, William," he said to the butler. "I'm off again, you see. Most
                     inhospitable lot <emph>I</emph> ever saw—never so much as offered me a glass of
                     wine. Good-night, my daisy. Oh river! as they say in French. Oh river!"</p>
                  <p>The door closed upon him. He looked back at the lighted windows and
                     laughed.</p>
                  <p>"I've given them a rare fright if nothing else. She went off stiff at sight of
                     me, and he—egad! the little fair-haired baronet's plucky after all—such a
                     molly-coddle as he used to be. Of course her being my wife's all bosh, but the
                     scare was good fun. And it won't end here—my word for it. He's as jealous as
                     the Grand Turk. I hope Inez will come to see me and give me some money. If she
                     doesn't I must go and see her, that's all."</p>
                  <p>He was gone—and for a moment silence reigned. Lights burned, flowers bloomed,
                     crystal and silver shone, rare wines and rich fruits glowed. But a skeleton sat
                     at the feast. Juan Catheron had done many evil deeds in his lifetime, but never
                     a more dastardly deed than to-night.</p>
                  <p>There was a flash of intolerable triumph in the dark eyes of Inez. She detested
                     her brother, but she could have kissed him now. She had lost all, wealth,
                     position, and the man she loved—this girl with the tangled yellow hair and pink
                     and white face had taken all from her, but even <emph>her</emph> path was not
                     to be altogether a path of roses.</p>
                  <p>Ashen pale and with eyes averted, Sir Victor walked back and resumed his seat
                     at the table. Ashen pale, trembling and frightened, Ethel sat where he had
                     placed her. And no one spoke—what was there to be said?</p>
                  <p>It was a fortunate thing that just at this juncture baby should see fit to wake
                     and set up a dismal cry, so shrill as to penetrate even to the distant
                     dinner-room. Lady Catheron rose to her feet, uttered a hasty and incoherent
                     apology, and ran from the room.</p>
                  <p>She did not return. Peace reigned, the infant heir of the Catherons was
                     soothed, but his mamma went downstairs no more that night. She lingered in the
                     nursery for over an hour. Somehow by her baby's side she felt a sense of peace
                     and safety. She dreaded to meet her husband. What must he think of her? She had
                     stooped to concealment, to falsehood—would he ever love her or trust her
                     again?</p>
                  <p>She went at last to her rooms. On the dressing-table wax lights burned, but the
                     bedroom was unlit. She seated herself by the window and looked out at the
                     starlit sky, at the darkly-waving trees of the park. "And this is my welcome
                     home," she thought, "to find in my husband's house my rival and enemy, whose
                     first look, whose first words are insults. She is mistress here, not I. And
                     that fatal folly of my childhood come back. That horrible man!" She shuddered
                     as she sat alone. "Ah, why did I not tell, why did mamma beg me to hide it from
                     him? She was so afraid he would have gone—so afraid her daughter would miss a
                     baronet, and I—I was weak and a coward. No, it is all over—he will never care
                     for me, never trust me again."</p>
                  <p>He came in as she sat there, mournful and alone. In the dusk of the chamber the
                     little half-hidden white figure caught his eye, the golden hair glimmering
                     through the dusk.</p>
                  <p>"Ethel," he said, "is that window open? Come away immediately—you will take
                     cold in the draught."</p>
                  <p>He spoke gently but very coldly as he had never spoken to her before. She
                     turned to him with a great sob.</p>
                  <p>"Oh, Victor, forgive me!" she said.</p>
                  <p>He was silent for a moment. He loved her with a great and passionate love; to
                     see her weep was torture, to see her suffer, misery. She had never been dearer
                     than in this hour. Still he stood aloof, torn by doubt, racked by jealousy.</p>
                  <p>"Ethel," he cried out, "<emph>why</emph> did you deceive me? I thought—I could
                     have sworn you were all truth and innocence, stainless as a lily, white as an
                     angel. And to think that another man—and of all men Juan Catheron. No. I can't
                     even think of it—it is enough to drive me mad!"</p>
                  <p>She fell down on her knees before him and held up her clasped hands.</p>
                  <pb n="38-39" xml:id="VAC6448-00000019"/>
                  <p>"I was only a child, Victor. I knew nothing of him, nothing of love. I have
                     done wrong, shamefully, sinfully wrong in concealing the truth, but you were so
                     exacting, so jealous, and I was so afraid of losing you. I loved you so—I loved
                     you so. O, Victor, forgive me or I shall die!"</p>
                  <p>He looked down at her, the hatred that is twin sister to love in his eyes.</p>
                  <p>"And I was a baronet. Had that anything to do with your fear of losing me, or
                     was the deception, the falsehood, caused wholly by love?"</p>
                  <p>It was the first cruel thing he had ever said to her, repented of as soon as
                     said. She arose to her feet and turned away.</p>
                  <p>"I have deserved it," she answered. "I told you a falsehood once—why should you
                     believe me now? I have no more to say. The woman who had ever known Juan
                     Catheron, could be no wife of yours—that was your sentence—was I likely to
                     confess after hearing it? I hid the truth for fear of losing you—attribute the
                     motive to what you please. I am yours to dispose of as you see fit. Send me
                     away if you like. It will be no more than I deserve."</p>
                  <p>She stood with her back toward him looking out into the night. He was standing
                     also quite still, listening and watching her. Send her away. She knew him well;
                     knew that it was as utterly impossible he could let her go, could live without
                     her, as that she could reach up and remove one of those shining stars.</p>
                  <p>"Send you away," he repeated; "send you away, Ethel! my love, my wife!"</p>
                  <p>She was in his arms, held to him in a strained embrace. She trembled, she
                     shrank in his grasp. The fierce impetuosity of his love frightened her at
                     times.</p>
                  <p>"Then you do forgive me?" she whispered. "Oh, Victor, I am, I <emph>am</emph>
                     sorry. Indeed, indeed, my darling, it was because I loved you I dared not tell.
                     You forgive me, I know, but let me hear you say it."</p>
                  <p>"Forgive you! Ethel, is there anything in the world I would <emph>not</emph>
                     forgive? I have heard of men who went mad and died for women. I laughed at them
                     once—I can understand it now. I should die or go mad if I lost you. I forgive
                     you, but—if you had only told me before."</p>
                  <p>There was a little sob, and her head lay on his shoulder.</p>
                  <p>"I tried to once or twice—I did indeed, but you know what a coward I am. And
                     mamma forbade my telling—that is the truth. She said I had been a little
                     fool—that was all over and done with—no need to be a great fool, telling my own
                     folly. And after we were married, and I saw you jealous of every man I looked
                     at—you know you were, sir!—I was more scared than ever. I thought Juan Catheron
                     was dead. I never wrote to him. I had returned all his letters. I thought I had
                     destroyed his picture; I never knew that I had done so very wrong in knowing
                     him at all, until that day in Russell Square. But Victor—husband—only forgive
                     me this once, and I'll never, never have a secret from you again as long as I
                     live."</p>
                  <p>She was little better than a child still—this pretty youthful matron and
                     mother. And with the sweet, pleading face uplifted, the big blue eyes swimming
                     in tears, the quivering lips, the pathetic voice, he did what <emph>you</emph>,
                     sir, would have done in his place—kissed and forgave her.</p>

                  <head>CHAPTER V.</head>
                  <head type="sub">IN THE TWILIGHT.</head>
                  <p>NO words can be strong enough to reprehend your conduct, Victor. You have acted
                     disgracefully; you are listening, sir,—disgracefully, I say, to your cousin
                     Inez. And you are the first of your line who has blurred the family escutcheon.
                     Dukes' daughters have entered Catheron Royals as brides. It was left for you to
                     wed a soap-boiler's daughter!"</p>
                  <p>Thus Lady Helena Powyss, of Powyss Place, to her nephew, Sir Victor Catheron,
                     just one fortnight after that memorable night of his wife and heir's coming
                     home. The young man stood listening in sullen anger, the red blood mounting to
                     his very temples. His Cousin Inez had managed during the past two weeks to make
                     his existence as thoroughly uncomfortable as a thoroughly jealous and
                        spiteful<pb n="40-41" xml:id="VAC6448-00000020"/> ful woman can. He had
                     flown at last to his aunt for comfort, and this is how he got it.</p>
                  <p>"Lady Helena," he burst forth, "this is too much! Not even from you will I bear
                     it. A soap-boiler's daughter my wife may be—it is the only charge that can be
                     brought against her. I have married to please myself, and it <emph>does</emph>
                     please me enormously. Inez, confound her! badgers me enough. I didn't expect,
                     Aunt Helena, to be badgered by you."</p>
                  <p>"I have no wish to badger you. I bring no charge against your wife. I have seen
                     her but once, and personally I like her excessively. I believe her to be as
                     good as she is pretty. But against <emph>your</emph> conduct I do and will
                     protest. You have cruelly, shamefully wronged your cousin—humiliated her beyond
                     all telling. I can only wonder—yes, Victor, wonder—that with her fiery nature
                     she takes it as quietly as she does."</p>
                  <p>"As quietly as she does! Good Heavens!" burst forth this "badgered" baronet.
                     "You should live in the same house with her to find out how quietly she takes
                     it. Women understand how to torture—they should have been grand inquisitors of
                     a Spanish inquisition, if such a thing ever existed. I am afraid to face her.
                     She stabs my wife in fifty different ways fifty times a day, and I—my guilty
                     conscience won't let me silence her. Ethel has not known a happy hour since she
                     entered Catheron Royals, and all through her infernal serpent tongue. Let her
                     take care—if she were ten times my cousin, even she may go one step to
                     far."</p>
                  <p>"Does that mean, Victor, you will turn her from Catheron Royals?"</p>
                  <p>"It means that, if you like. Inez is my cousin, Ethel is my wife. You are her
                     friend, Aunt Helena; you will be doing a friendly action if you drop her a
                     hint. I wish you good-morning."</p>
                  <p>He took his hat and turned to go, his handsome blonde face sullen and set.</p>
                  <p>"Very well," Lady Helena answered; "I will. You are to blame—not that poor
                     fair-haired child. I will speak to Inez; and, Victor, I will try to forgive you
                     for your mother's sake. Though you broke her heart she would have forgiven you.
                     I will try to do as she would have done—and I like the little thing. You will
                     not fail me on Thursday next? If <emph>I</emph> take up your wife all the
                     neighborhood will, you may depend."</p>
                  <p>"We are not likely to fail. The invitation is like your kindness, Aunt Helena.
                     Thanks very much!"</p>
                  <p>His short-lived anger died away; he gave his hand frankly to his aunt. She was
                     his wife's friend—the only one who had taken the slightest notice of her since
                     her arrival. For the resident gentry had decided that they couldn't—really
                     couldn't—call upon the soap-boiler's daughter.</p>
                  <p>Sir Victor Catheron had shocked and scandalized his order as it had not been
                     shocked and scandalized for half a century. A banker's daughter, a brewer's
                     daughter, they were prepared to accept—banking and brewing are genteel sort of
                     things. But a soap-boiler!—and married in secret!—and a baby born in
                     lodgings!—and Miss Catheron jilted in cold blood!—Oh it was shameful!—shameful!
                     No, they could not call upon the new Lady Catheron—well, at least until they
                     saw whether the Lady Helena Powyss meant to take her up.</p>
                  <p>Lady Helena was the only sister of the young baronet's late mother, with no
                     children of her own, and very strongly attached to both Sir Victor and Inez.
                     His mother's dying desire had been that he should marry his cousin. He had
                     promised, and Lady Helena's strongest hope in life had been to see that promise
                     fulfilled. The news of his low marriage fell upon her like a thunderbolt. She
                     was the proudest of dowagers—when had a Catheron made a <foreign xml:lang="FRA"
                        >mesalliance</foreign> before? No; she could not forgive him—could never
                     receive his wife.</p>
                  <p>But when he came to her, pale, sad, appealing for pardon, she relented. It was
                     a very tender and womanly heart, despite its pride of birth, that beat in Lady
                     Helena's bosom; and jolly Squire Powyss, who had seen the little wife at the
                     Royals, took sides with his nephew.</p>
                  <p>"It's done, and can't be undone, my dear," the squire said, philosophically;
                     "and it's always wise to make the best of a bad bargain; and 'pon my life, my
                     love, it's the sweetest little face the sun ever shone on! Gad! I'd have done
                     it myself. Forgive him, my dear—boys will be boys—and go and see his wife."</p>
                  <pb n="42-43" xml:id="VAC6448-00000021"/>
                  <p>Lady Helena yielded—love for her boy stronger than pride or anger. She went;
                     and there came into one of the dusk drawing-rooms of the Royals, a little white
                     vision, with fair, floating hair, and pathetic blue eyes—a little creature, so
                     like a child, that the tender, motherly heart of the great lady went out to her
                     at once.</p>
                  <p>"You pretty little thing!" she said, taking her in her arms and kissing her as
                     though she had been eight rather than eighteen. "You're nothing but a baby
                     yourself, and you have got a baby they tell me. Take me to see him, my
                     dear."</p>
                  <p>They were friends from that hour. Ethel, with grateful tears in her eyes, led
                     her up to the dainty berceaunette where the heir of Catheron Royals slept, and
                     as she kissed his velvet cheek and looked pityingly from babe to mother, the
                     last remains of anger died out of her heart. Lady Helena Powyss would "take
                     Lady Catheron up."</p>
                  <p>"She's pretty, and gentle, and good, and a lady if ever I saw one," she said to
                     Inez Catheron; "and she doesn't look too happy. Don't be to hard on her, my
                     dear—it isn't her fault. Victor is to blame. No one feels that more than I. But
                     not that blue-eyed child—try to forgive her Inez, my love. A little kindness
                     will go a long way there."</p>
                  <p>Inez Catheron sitting in the sunlit window of her own luxurious room, turned
                     her face from the rosy sunset sky full upon her aunt.</p>
                  <p>"I know what I owe my cousin Victor and his wife," she answered steadily, "and
                     one day I shall pay my debt."</p>
                  <p>The large, lustrous Spanish eyes turned once more to the crimson light in the
                     western sky. Some of that lurid splendor lit her dark, colorless face with a
                     vivid glow. Lady Helena looked at her uneasily—there was a depth here she could
                     not fathom. Was Inez "taking it quietly" after all?</p>
                  <p>"I—I don't ask you to forgive <emph>him</emph>, my dear," she said,
                     nervously—"at least, just yet. I don't think I could do it myself. And of
                     course you can't be expected to feel very kindly to her who has usurped your
                     place. But I would let her alone if I were you. Victor is master here, and his
                     wife must be mistress, and naturally he doesn't like it. You might go too far,
                     and then—"</p>
                  <p>"He might turn me out of Catheron Royals—is that what you are trying to say,
                     Aunt Helena?"</p>
                  <p>"Well, my dear—'</p>
                  <p>"Victor was to see you yesterday. Did he tell you this? No need to distress
                     yourself—I see he did. And so I am to be turned from Catheron Royals for the
                     soap-boiler's daughter, if I don't stand aside and let her reign. It is well to
                     be warned—I shall not forget it."</p>
                  <p>Lady Helena was at a loss. What could she say? What could she do? Something in
                     the set, intense face of the girl frightened her—absolutely frightened her. She
                     rose hurriedly to go.</p>
                  <p>"Will you come to Powyss Place on Thursday next?" she asked. "I hardly like to
                     press you, Inez, under the circumstances. For poor Victor's sake I want to make
                     the best of it. I give a dinner party, as you know; invite all our friends, and
                     present Lady Catheron. There is no help for it. If I take her up, all the
                     country will; but if <emph>you</emph> had rather not appear, Inez—"</p>
                  <p>There was a sharp, quick, warning flash from the black eyes.</p>
                  <p>"Why should I not appear? Victor may be a coward—<emph>I</emph> am not. I will
                     go. I will face our whole visiting list, and defy them to pity me. Take up the
                     soap-boiler's heiress by all means, but, powerful as you are, I doubt if even
                     you will be able to keep her afloat. Try the experiment—give the dinner party—I
                     will be there."</p>
                  <p>"It's a very fine thing for a tradesman's daughter to marry a rich baronet, no
                     doubt," commented Lady Helena, as she was driven home; "but, with Inez for my
                     rival, <emph>I</emph> shouldn't care to risk it. I only hope, for my sake at
                     least, she will let the poor thing alone next Thursday."</p>
                  <p>The "poor thing" indeed! If Sir Victor's life had been badgered during the past
                     fortnight, his wife's life had been rendered nearly unendurable. Inez knew so
                     well how to stab, and she never spared a thrust. It was wonderful, the
                     bitterest, stinging things she could say over and over again, in her slow,
                        <foreign xml:lang="ITA">legato</foreign> tones. She never spared. Her tongue
                     was a two-edged sword, and the black deriding eyes looked pitilessly on her
                     victim's writhes and quivers. And Ethel bore it. She loved her husband—he
                     feared his cousin—for<pb n="44-45" xml:id="VAC6448-00000022"/> his sake she
                     endured. Only once, after some trebly cruel stab, she had cried aloud in her
                     passionate pain:</p>
                  <p>"I can't endure it, Victor—I cannot! She will kill me. Take me back to London,
                     to Russell Square, anywhere away from your dreadful cousin!"</p>
                  <p>He had soothed her as best he might, and riding over to Powyss Place, had given
                     his aunt that warning.</p>
                  <p>"It will seem a horribly cruel and inhuman thing to turn her from the home
                     where she has reigned mistress so long," he said to himself. "I will never be
                     able to hold up my head in the county after—but she <emph>must</emph> let Ethel
                     alone. By fair means or foul she must.</p>
                  <p>The day of Lady Helena Powyss' party came—a terrible ordeal for Ethel. She had
                     grown miserably nervous under the life she had led the past two weeks—the
                     ceaseless mockery of Miss Catheron's soft, scornful tones, the silent contempt
                     and derision of her hard black eyes. What should she wear? how should she act?
                     What if she made some absurd blunder, betraying her plebeian birth and
                     breeding? What if she mortified her thin-skinned husband? Oh! why was it
                     necessary to go at all?</p>
                  <p>"My dear child," her husband said, kissing her good-humoredly, "it isn't worth
                     that despairing face. Just put on one of your pretty dinner-dresses, a flower
                     in your hair, and your pearls. Be your own simple, natural, dear little self,
                     and there will not be a lady at Aunt Helena's able to shine you down."</p>
                  <p>And when an hour after, she descended, in a sweeping robe of silvery blue,
                     white lilies in her yellow hair, and pale pearls clasping her slim throat, she
                     looked fair as a dream.</p>
                  <p>Inez's black eyes flashed angrily as they fell upon her. Soap-boiler's daughter
                     she might be, with the blood of many Dobbs in her veins, but no young peeress,
                     born to the purple, ever looked more graceful, more refined.</p>
                  <p>For Miss Catheron herself, she was quite bewildering in a dress of dead white
                     silk, soft laces and dashes of crimson about her as usual, and rubies flashing
                     here and there. She swept on to the carriage with head held haughtily erect, a
                     contemptuous smile on her lips, like anything on earth but a jilted maiden.</p>
                  <p>Lady Helena's rooms were filled when they entered; not one invitation had been
                     declined. Society had mustered in fullest force to see Sir Victor Catheron's
                     low-born wife, to see how Miss Catheron bore her humiliation. How would the one
                     bear their scrutiny, the other their pity? But Miss Catheron, handsome,
                     smiling, brilliant, came in among them with eyes that said: "Pity me if you
                     dare!" And upon Sir Victor's arm there followed the small, graceful figure, the
                     sweet, fair face of a girl who did not look one day more than sixteen—by all
                     odds the prettiest girl in the rooms.</p>
                  <p>Lady Helena—who, when she did that sort of thing, <emph>did</emph> do it—took
                     the little wife under her wing at once. People by the score, it seemed to the
                     bewildered Ethel, were presented, and the stereotyped compliments of society
                     were poured into her ear. Sir Victor was congratulated, sincerely by the men,
                     with an under-current of pity and mockery by the women. Then they were all at
                     dinner—the bride in the place of honor—running the gauntlet of all those eyes
                     on the alert for any solicism of good manners.</p>
                  <p>She went through it all, her cheeks flushing, her eyes kindling with excitement
                     growing prettier every moment. Her spirits rose—she would let these people and
                     Inez Catheron see, she was their equal in all things save birth. She talked,
                     she laughed, she took captive half the male hearts, and when the ladies at
                     length sailed away to the drawing-room, Lady Helena stooped and kissed her,
                     almost with motherly pride.</p>
                  <p>"My dear," she whispered, "let me congratulate you. Nothing could be a greater
                     success. All the men are in love with you—all the women jealous. A most
                     excellent beginning indeed!"</p>
                  <p>She laughed pleasantly, this kindly dowager, and passed on. It was an
                     unspeakable relief to her to see her nephew's low-born wife face society so
                     bravely and well. And better still, Inez had not launched one single poisoned
                     dart. But the evening was not ended yet. Inez's time was to come. Enter the
                     gentlemen presently, and flirtations are resumed, <foreign xml:lang="FRA"
                        >tête-à-têtes</foreign> in quiet corners recommenced, conversation becomes
                     general. There is music. A certain Lord Verriker, the youngest man present, and
                     the greatest in social status, monopolizes Lady Catheron. He leads her to the
                     piano, and she sings. She is on trial still, and does her best, and<pb
                        n="46-47" xml:id="VAC6448-00000023"/> her best is very good—a sweet Scotch
                     ballad. There is quite a murmur of applause as she rises, and through it there
                     breaks Miss Catheron's soft, sarcastic laugh. The flush deepens in Ethel's
                     cheek—the laugh is at her performance she feels.</p>
                  <p>And now the hour of Inez's vengeance comes. Young Captain Varden is leaning
                     over her chair; he is in love with Miss Catheron, and hovers about her
                     unceasingly. He talks a great deal, though not very brilliantly. He is telling
                     her in an audible undertone how Jack Singleton of "Ours" has lately made an
                     object of himself before gods and men, and irretrievably ruined himself for
                     life by marrying the youngest Miss Potter, of Potter's Park.</p>
                  <p>"Indeed!" Miss Catheron responds, with her light laugh, and her low, clear
                     voice perfectly distinct to all; "the youngest Miss Potter. Ah, yes! I've heard
                     of them. The paternal Potter kept a shop in Chester, didn't he—a grocer, or
                     something of the sort, and having made money enough behind the counter, has
                     retired. And poor Lieutenant Singleton has married the youngest Miss Potter!
                     'Whom the gods wish to destroy they first make mad.' A very charming girl no
                     doubt, as sweet as the paternal treacle, and as melting as her father's butter.
                     It's an old custom in some families—my own for instance—to quarter the arms of
                     the bride on the family shield. Now what do you suppose the arms of the Potter
                     family may be—a white apron and a pair of scales?"</p>
                  <p>And then, all through the room, there is a horrible suppressed laugh. The blood
                     rushes in a fiery tide to the face of Sir Victor, and Lady Helena outglows her
                     crimson velvet gown. Ethel, with the youthful Lord Verriker still hovering
                     around her, has but one wild instinct, that of flight. Oh! to be away from
                     these merciless people—from that bitter, dagger-tongued Inez Catheron! She
                     looks wildly at her husband. Must she bear this? But his back is to her—he is
                     wilfully blind and deaf. The courage to take up the gauntlet for his wife, to
                     make a scene, to silence his cousin, is a courage he does not possess.</p>
                  <p>Under the midnight stars Lady Helena's guests drive home. In the carriage of
                     Sir Victor Catheron there is dead silence. Ethel, shrinking from her husband
                     almost as much as from his cousin, lies back in a corner, pale and mute. Inez
                     Catheron's dauntless black eyes look up at the white, countless stars as she
                     softly hums a tune. Sir Victor sits with his eyes shut, but he is not asleep.
                     He is in a rage with himself, he hates his cousin, he is afraid to look at his
                     wife. One way or other he feels there must be an immediate end of this.</p>
                  <p>The first estrangement that has parted him and Ethel has come. He hardly knows
                     her to-night—her cold, brief words, her averted face, her palpable shrinking as
                     he approaches. She despises him, and with reason, a man who has not the courage
                     to protect his wife from insult.</p>
                  <p>Next day Lady Catheron declines to appear at either breakfast or luncheon, and
                     when, five minutes before dinner, Sir Victor and Miss Catheron meet in the
                     dining-room, she is absent still. He rings the bell angrily and demands where
                     she is.</p>
                  <p>"My lady has gone out," the footman answers. "She went half an hour ago. She
                     had a book with her, and she went in the direction of the laurel walk."</p>
                  <p>"I will go in search of her," Sir Victor says, taking his hat; "let dinner wait
                     until our return."</p>
                  <p>Ethel has gone, because she cannot meet Inez Catheron again, never again break
                     bread at the same board with her pitiless enemy. She cried herself quietly to
                     sleep last night; her head aches with a dull, sickening pain to-day. To be home
                     once more—to be back in the cosy, common-place Russell square lodgings! If it
                     were not for baby she feels as though she would like to run away, from Sir
                     Victor and all, anywhere that Inez Catheron's black eyes and derisive smile
                     could never come.</p>
                  <p>The September twilight, sparkling with frosty-looking stars, is settling down
                     over the trees. The great house looms up, big, sombre, stately, a home to be
                     proud of, yet Ethel shudders as she looks at it. The only miserable days of her
                     life have been spent beneath its roof; she will hate it before long. Her very
                     love for her husband seems to die out in bitter contempt, as she thinks of last
                     night, when he stood by and heard his cousin's sneering insult. The gloaming is
                     chilly, she draws her shawl closer around her, and walks slowly up and down.
                     Slow, miserable tears trickle down her<pb n="48-49" xml:id="VAC6448-00000024"/>
                     cheeks as she walks. She feels so utterly alone, so utterly forlorn, so utterly
                     at the mercy of this merciless woman.</p>
                  <p>"Oh!" she says, with a passionate sob, and unconsciously aloud,
                        "<emph>why</emph> did I ever marry him?"</p>
                  <p>"If you mean Sir Victor Catheron," answers a voice, "I think I can tell you.
                     You married Sir Victor Catheron because he <emph>was</emph> Sir Victor
                     Catheron. But it isn't a marriage, my dear—you know that. A young lady can't
                     have two husbands, and I'm your legal, lawful-wedded spouse."</p>
                  <p>She utters a cry—she recoils with a face of terror, for there in the twilight
                     before her, tall, black, sinister, stands Juan Catheron.</p>
                  <p>"<emph>You!</emph>" she gasps.</p>
                  <p>"I, my dear—I, in the flesh. Did you think I had gone? My dear Ethel, so I
                     would have gone, if Inez had come down in the sisterly way she should. But she
                     hasn't. I give you my word of honor her conduct has been shabby in the extreme.
                     A few hundreds—I asked no more—and she wouldn't. What was a miserly fifty pun'
                     note to a man like me, with expensive tastes, and who has not set foot on
                     British soil for two years? Not a jewel would she part with—all Sir Victor's
                     presents, forsooth! And she's in love with Sir Victor, you know. Perhaps you
                        <emph>don't</emph> know, though. 'Pon my life, she is, Ethel, and means to
                     have him yet, too. That's what she says, and she is a girl to do as she says,
                     is Inez. That's why I'm here to-night, my dear. I can't go to Sir Victor, you
                     understand—motives of delicacy, and all that—so I waited my chance, and have
                     come to you. You may be fickle, but I don't think you're stingy. And something
                     is due to my outraged feelings, blighted affections, and all that. Give me five
                     hundred pounds, Ethel, and let us call it square."</p>
                  <p>He came nearer, his big, brown hand outstretched. She shrank away, hatred and
                     repulsion in her face.</p>
                  <p>"Stand back!" she said. "Don't come near me, Juan Catheron! How dare you
                     intrude here! How dare you speak to me!"</p>
                  <p>"How dare I? Oh, come now, I say, I like that. If a man may not speak to his
                     own wife, to whom <emph>may</emph> he speak? If it comes to that, how dare you
                     throw me over, and commit bigamy, and marry Sir Victor Catheron? It's of no use
                     your riding the high horse with me, Ethel; you had better give me the five
                     hundred—I'm sure I'm moderate enough—and let me go."</p>
                  <p>"I will not give you a farthing; and if you do not leave this place instantly,
                     I will call my husband. "Oh!" she burst forth, frantically, "between you and
                     your sister you will drive me mad!"</p>
                  <p>"Will you give me the money?" asked Juan Catheron, folding his arms and turning
                     sullen.</p>
                  <p>"I have not got it. What money have I?—and if I had, I say I would not give you
                     a farthing. Begone! or—"</p>
                  <p>"You have diamonds." He pointed to her hands. "They will do—easily convertible
                     in London. Hand them here, or, by all the gods, I'll blow the story of your
                     bigamy all over England!"</p>
                  <p>"You will not!" she cried, her eyes flashing in the twilight—"you coward! you
                     dare not! Sir Victor has <emph>you</emph> in his power, and he will keep his
                     threat. Speak one word of that vile lie, and your tongue will be silenced in
                     Chesholm jail. Leave me, I say!"—she stamped her foot passionately—"I am not
                     afraid of you, Juan Catheron!"</p>
                  <p>"And you will not give me the jewels?"</p>
                  <p>"Not one—not to keep you from spreading your slander from end to end of
                     England! Do your worst!—you cannot make me more wretched than I am. And go, or
                     I will call for help, and see whether my husband has not courage to keep his
                     word."</p>
                  <p>"You will not give me the rings?"</p>
                  <p>"Not to save your life! Hark! some one is coming! Now you will see which of us
                     is afraid of the other!"</p>
                  <p>He stood looking at her, a dangerous gleam in his black eyes.</p>
                  <p>"Very well!" he said; "so be it! Don't trouble yourself to call your hero of a
                     husband—I'm going. You're a plucky little thing after all, Ethel. I don't know
                     but that I rather admire your spirit. Adieu, my dear, until we meet again."</p>
                  <p>He swung round, and vanished among the trees. He was actually singing as he
                     went, <q>
                        <lg type="quotation">
                           <l>"To-day for me.</l>

                           <l>But will that to-morrow ever be?"</l>

                  <p>The last rustle of the laurels died away; all was still; the twilight was
                     closing darkness, and, with a shudder, Ethel turned to go.</p>
                  <p>"But will that to-morrow ever be?"—the refrain of the doggerel rung in her
                     ears. "Am I never to be free from this brother and sister?" she cried to
                     herself, desperately, as she advanced to the house. "Am I never to be free from
                     this bondage?"</p>
                  <p>As the last flutter of her white dress disappeared, Sir Victor Catheron emerged
                     from the shadow of the trees, and the face, on which the rising moon shone, was
                     white as the face of death.</p>

                  <p>HE had not overheard a word, he had not tried to overhear; but he had seen them
                     together—that was enough. He had reached the spot only a moment before their
                     parting, and had stood confounded at sight of his wife alone here in the dusk
                     with Juan Catheron.</p>
                  <p>He saw them part—saw him dash through the woodland, singing as he went—saw her
                     turn away and walk rapidly to the house. She had come here to meet him, then,
                     her former lover. He had not left Chesholm; he was lurking in the neighborhood
                     of the Royals, and she knew it. She knew it. How many times had they met
                     before—his wife and the man he abhorred—the man who claimed her as his wife.
                     What if she <emph>were</emph> his wife? What if that plight pledged in the
                     Scotch kirk were binding? She had loved Juan Catheron then. What if she loved
                     him still? She had hidden it from him, until it could be hidden no longer—she
                     had deceived him in the past, she was deceiving him in the present. So fair and
                     so false, so innocent to all outward seeming. Yet so lost to all truth and
                     honor.</p>
                  <p>He turned sick and giddy; he leaned against a tree, feeling ing as though he
                     could never look upon her false face again. Yet the next moment he started
                     passionately up.</p>
                  <p>"I will go to her," he thought; "I will hear what she has to say. If she
                     voluntarily tells me, I must, I will believe her. If she is silent, I will take
                     it as proof of her guilt."</p>
                  <p>He strode away to the house. As he entered, his man Edwards met him, and
                     presented him a note.</p>
                  <p>"Brought by a groom from Powyss Place, Sir Victor," he said. "Squire Powyss has
                     had a stroke."</p>
                  <p>The baronet tore it open—it was an impetuous summons from Lady Helena.</p>
                  <p>"The squire has had an attack of apoplexy. For Heaven's sake come at once."</p>
                  <p>He crushed it in his hand, and went into the dining-room. His wife was not
                     there. He turned to the nursery; he was pretty sure of always finding her
                        <emph>there</emph>.</p>
                  <p>She was there, bending over her baby, looking fair and sweet as the babe
                     itself. Fair and sweet surely. Yet why, if innocent, that nervous start at
                     sight of him—that frightened look in the blue eyes. The nurse stood at a
                     distance, but he did not heed her.</p>
                  <p>"A summons from Powyss Place," he said; "the poor old squire has had a fit of
                     apoplexy. This is the second within the year, and may prove fatal. I must go at
                     once. It is not likely I shall return to-night."</p>
                  <p>She looked at him, startled by his deadly paleness; but then, perhaps, the
                     summons accounted for that. She murmured her regrets, then bent again over her
                     baby.</p>
                  <p>"You have nothing to say to me, Ethel, before I go?" he said, looking at her
                     steadily.</p>
                  <p>She half-lifted her head, the words half-rose to her lips. She glanced at the
                     distant nurse, who was still busy in the room, glanced at her husband's pale
                     set face, and they died away again. Why detain him now in his haste and
                     trouble? Why rouse his rage against Juan Catheron at this inopportune time? No,
                     she would wait until to-morrow—nothing could be done now; then she would reveal
                     that intrusion in the grounds.</p>
                  <p>"I have nothing to say, except good-by. I hope poor Mr. Powyss may not be so
                     ill as you fear."</p>
                  <p>He turned away—a tumult of jealous rage within him. A<pb n="52-53"
                        xml:id="VAC6448-00000026"/> deliberate lie he thought it; there could be no
                     doubt of her guilt now. And yet, insanely inconsistent as it seems, he had
                     never loved her more passionately than in that hour.</p>
                  <p>He turned to go without a word. He had reached the door. All at once he turned
                     back, caught her in his arms almost fiercely, and kissed her again and
                     again.</p>
                  <p>"Good-by," he said, "my wife, my love—good-by."</p>
                  <p>His vehemence frightened her. She released herself and looked at him, her heart
                     fluttering. A second time he walked to the door—a second time he paused.
                     Something seemed to stay his feet on the threshold.</p>
                  <p>"You will think me foolish, Ethel," he said, with a forced laugh; "but I seem
                     afraid to leave you to-night. Nervous folly, I suppose; but take care of
                     yourself, my darling, until I return. I shall be back at the earliest possible
                     moment."</p>
                  <p>Then he was gone.</p>
                  <p>She crossed over to the low French window, standing wide open, and looked after
                     him wistfully.</p>
                  <p>"Dear Victor," she thought, "how fond he is of me, after all."</p>
                  <p>The moon was shining brightly now, though the day still lingered. She stood and
                     watched him out of sight. Once, as he rode away, he turned back—she kissed and
                     waved her hand to him with a smile.</p>
                  <p>"Poor Victor!" she thought again, "he loves me so dearly that I ought to
                     forgive him everything. How happy we might be here together, if it were not for
                     that horrible brother and sister. I wish—I wish he would send her away."</p>
                  <p>She lingered by the window, fascinated by the brilliancy of the rising
                     September moon. As she stood there, the nursery door opened, and Miss Catheron
                     entered.</p>
                  <p>"You here," she said, coolly; "I didn't know it. I wanted Victor. I thought I
                     heard his voice. And how is the heir of Catheron Royals?"</p>
                  <p>She bent, with her usual slight, chill smile over the crib of that young
                     gentleman, and regarded him in his sleep. The nurse, listening in the dusk, she
                     did not perceive.</p>
                  <p>"By the bye, I wonder if he <emph>is</emph> the heir of Catheron Royals though?
                     I am reading up the Scottish Law of Marriage, and really I have my doubts. If
                     you are Juan's wife, you can't be Sir Victor's, consequently the legitimacy of
                     his son may yet be—"</p>
                  <p>She never finished the sentence. It was the last drop in the brimming cup—the
                     straw that broke the camel's back—the one insult of all others not to be borne.
                     With eyes afire in the dusk, Sir Victor's wife confronted her.</p>
                  <p>"You have uttered your last affront, Inez Catheron," she exclaimed. "You will
                     never utter another beneath this roof. To-morrow you leave it! I am Sir Victor
                     Catheron's wife, the mistress of Catheron Royals, and this is the last night it
                     shall ever shelter you. Go!" She threw open the nursery door. "When my husband
                     returns either you or I leave this house forever!"</p>
                  <p>The nurse was absolutely forgotten. For a second even Inez Catheron quailed
                     before the storm she had raised; then black eyes met blue, with defiant
                     scorn.</p>
                  <p>"Not all the soap-boiler's daughters in London or England shall send me from
                     Catheron Royals! Not all the Miss Dobbs that ever bore that distinguished
                     appellation shall drive me forth. <emph>You</emph> may go to-morrow if you
                     will. I shall not."</p>
                  <p>She swept from the room, with eyes that blazed, and voice that rang. And Jane
                     Pool, the nurse, thinking she had heard a little too much, softly opened an
                     opposite door and stole out.</p>
                  <p>"Good Lor'!" she thought, "<emph>here</emph> be a pretty flare up! Ain't Miss
                     Inez just got a temper though. I wouldn't stand in my lady's shoes, and her
                     a-hating me so; no, not for all her money. I'll go down and get my supper, and
                     call for Master Baby by and by."</p>
                  <p>Mrs. Pool descended to the servants' hall, to narrate, of course in confidence,
                     to her most particular friends, the scene she had just overheard. There was
                     Welsh rabbits for supper—nurse was particularly fond of Welsh rabbits—and in
                     discussing it and Miss Inez's awful temper half an hour slipped away. Then she
                     arose again to see after her charge.</p>
                  <p>"Which he should have been undressed and tucked away for the night half an hour
                     ago, bless him," she remarked;<pb n="54-55" xml:id="VAC6448-00000027"/> "but I
                     could not make up my mind to face my lady after <emph>that</emph> row. Poor
                     thing! It does seem hard now she can't be mistress in her own 'ouse. It's a
                     pity Sir Victor can't turn Turk and marry 'em both, since he can't abear to
                     part with neither."</p>
                  <p>Mrs. Pool made her exit and wended her way to the nursery. She tapped at the
                     door—there was no reply—she opened it and went in—my lady had quitted it, no
                     doubt.</p>
                  <p>No—to her surprise my lady was still there. The window still stood wide open,
                     the white, piercing moonlight streamed in. An arm-chair stood near this window,
                     and lying back in the arm-chair was my lady, fast asleep.</p>
                  <p>Fast asleep. Jane Pool tiptoed over to make sure. She was pale as the moonlight
                     itself. Her lips quivered as she slept like the lips of a hurt child, her
                     eyelashes were yet wet with tears. Sitting there alone she had cried herself to
                     sleep.</p>
                  <p>"Poor thing!" Jane Pool said again. She was so young, so pretty, so gentle,
                     that all the household loved her. "Poor dear thing! I say it's a burning shame
                     for Sir Victor, so fond as he is of her too, to let Miss Inez torment her.
                        <emph>I</emph> wouldn't stand her hairs and her 'aughtiness, her temper and
                     her tongue; no, not to be ten baronets' ladies, ten times hover!"</p>
                  <p>In his pretty blue silk, white lace, and carved rosewood nest, Master Victor
                     lay still, sleeping also. Mrs. Pool softly folded a shawl around her lady's
                     shoulders, lifted babe without awakening him, and stole softly out. The night
                     nursery was an upper room. Jane Pool carried him up, disrobed him, fed him, and
                     tucked him up for the night. He fell again asleep almost instantly. She
                     summoned the under nurse-maid to remain with him, and went back to the lower
                     regions. Half an hour had passed since she left; it struck the half hour after
                     eight as she descended the stairs.</p>
                  <p>"I'm sore afraid my lady will catch cold sleeping in the night air. I do think
                     now I ought to go in and wake her."</p>
                  <p>While she stood hesitating before it, the door opened suddenly and Miss
                     Catheron came out. She was very pale. Jane Pool was struck by it, and the
                     scarlet shawl she wore twisted about her, made her face look almost ghastly in
                     the lamplight.</p>
                  <p>"<emph>You</emph> here?" she said, in her haughty way. "What do you want? Where
                     is baby?"</p>
                  <p>"Baby's asleep, miss, for the night," Jane answered, with a stiff little
                     curtsey; "and what I'm here for, is to wake my lady. Sleeping in a draught
                     cannot be good for anybody. But perhaps she is awake."</p>
                  <p>"You will let my lady alone," said Miss Catheron sharply, "and attend to your
                     nursery. She is asleep still. It is not <emph>your</emph> place to disturb her.
                     Go!"</p>
                  <p>"Drat her!" Nurse Pool exclaimed inwardly, obeying, however; "she's that
                     'aughty and that stuck up, that she thinks we're the dirt under her feet. I
                     only hope she'll be sent packing to-morrow, but I has my doubts. Sir Victor's
                     afraid of her—anybody can see that with half an eye."</p>
                  <p>She descended to the servants' regions again, and encountered Ellen, Lady
                     Catheron's smart maid, sociably drinking tea with the housekeeper. And once
                     more into their attentive ears she poured forth this addenda to her previous
                     narrative.</p>
                  <p>"What was Miss Inez doing in there?" demanded the maid; "no, good, I'll be
                     bound. She hates my lady like <choice>
                        <sic>posion</sic>
                        <corr>poison</corr>
                     </choice>; Sir Victor jilted her, you know, and she's in love with him yet. My
                     lady <emph>shall</emph> be woke up in spite of her; she'd like her to get her
                     death in the night air, I dare say. I've an easy missis and a good place, and I
                     mean to keep 'em. I ain't afraid of Miss Inez's black eyes and sharp tongue;
                        <emph>I'll</emph> go and wake my lady up."</p>
                  <p>She finished her tea and left. She reached the nursery door and rapped as Nurse
                     Pool had done. There was no reply. She turned the handle softly and went
                     in.</p>
                  <p>The large, crystal, clear moon was high in the sky now; its chill brightness
                     filled the room. The arm-chair still stood under the window; the small figure
                     of my lady still lay motionless in it.</p>
                  <p>"My lady," Ellen said gently, advancing, "please wake up."</p>
                  <p>There was no reply, no stir. She bent closer over her.</p>
                  <p>"Please, my lady, wake up; I'm afraid you'll catch your death of—"</p>
                  <pb n="56-57" xml:id="VAC6448-00000028"/>
                  <p>The words ended in a shriek that rang through the house from end to end—a
                     woman's shrill, ear-splitting shriek. She had laid her hand upon my lady's
                     bosom to arouse her; she snatched it away and sprang back in horror. Asleep!
                     Yes, the sleep that knows no waking. Sir Victor Catheron's pretty young wife
                     lay there in the moonlight—dead.</p>
                  <p>Dead! There is blood on the white dress, blood on the blue shawl, blood on
                     Ellen's hand, blood trickling in a small red stream from under the left breast.
                     Ethel, Lady Catheron, lies there before her in the moonlight stone dead—foully
                     murdered.</p>

                  <p>SHE stands for a moment paralyzed—struck dumb by a horror too great for word or
                     cry. Then she rushes to the door, along the passages, into the midst of the
                     startled household like a mad creature, shrieking that one most awful word,
                     "Murder!"</p>
                  <p>They flock around her, they catch hold of her, and keep her still by main
                     force. They ask her questions, but she only screams still that ghastly word,
                     "Murder!"</p>
                  <p>"<emph>Who</emph> is murdered? Where—what do you mean? Good Lord! young woman,"
                     cries Mr. Hooper, the butler, giving her a shake, "do come out of these
                     hysterics if you can, and speak! <emph>Who's</emph> murdered?"</p>
                  <p>"My lady! Oh, my lady! my lady! my lady!"</p>
                  <p>She is like a creature distraught. There is blood on her right hand; she sees
                     it, and with a gasping cry at the grisly sight, and before they know what she
                     is about, she falls down in a faint in their midst.</p>
                  <p>They lift her up; they look into one another's pale faces.</p>
                  <p>"My lady!" they repeat, in an awe-struck whisper. "<emph>Murdered!</emph>"</p>
                  <p>"Here!" cries Mr. Hooper, his dignity coming to his aid, "let us investigate
                     this here. Lay this young woman flat on her back on the floor, sprinkle her
                     with water, and let her come to. I'm going to find out what she means."</p>
                  <p>They lay poor Ellen stiffly out as directed, some one dashes water into her
                     face, then in a body, with Mr. Hooper at their head, they march off to
                     investigate.</p>
                  <p>"She was in the day-nursery," Nurse Pool suggests, in a whisper, and to the
                     day-nursery they go.</p>
                  <p>On the threshold for a second or two they halt, their courage failing. But
                     there is nothing very terrifying. Only the solemn moonlight, only the
                     motionless little figure in the arm-chair. And yet a great awe holds them back.
                     Does death—does murder stand grisly in their midst?</p>
                  <p>"Let us go in, in the name of Providence," says Mr. Hooper, a tremble in his
                     voice; "it—it can't be what she says. O good Lord, no!"</p>
                  <p>They go forward on tiptoe, as if afraid of awakening that quiet sleeper whom
                     only the last trump will ever awake now. They bend above her, holding their
                     breath. Yes, there it is—the blood that is soaking her dress, dripping horribly
                     on the carpet—oozing slowly from that cruel wound.</p>
                  <p>A gasping, inarticulate sort of groan comes heavily from every lip. Old Hooper
                     takes her wrist between his shaking fingers. Stilled forever, already with the
                     awful chill of death. In the crystal light of the moon the sweet young face has
                     never looked fairer, calmer, more peaceful than now.</p>
                  <p>The old butler straightens himself up, ashen gray.</p>
                  <p>"It's too true," he says, with a sort of sob. "O Lord, have mercy on us—it's
                     too true! She's dead! She's murdered!"</p>
                  <p>He drops the wrist he holds, the little jewelled, dead hand falls limp and
                     heavy. He puts his own hands over his face and sobs aloud:</p>
                  <p>"Who will tell Sir Victor? O my master! my dear young master!"</p>
                  <p>No one speaks—a spell of great horror has fallen upon them. Murdered in their
                     midst, in their peaceful household—they cannot comprehend it. At last—</p>
                  <p>"<emph>Where is Miss Catheron?</emph>" asks a sombre voice.</p>
                  <p>No one knows who speaks; no one seems to care; no one dare reply.</p>
                  <pb n="58-59" xml:id="VAC6448-00000029"/>
                  <p>"Where is Inez Catheron?" the voice says again.</p>
                  <p>Something in the tone, something in the ghastly silence that follows, seems to
                     arouse the butler. Since his tenth year he has been in the service of the
                     Catherons—his father before him was butler in this house. Their honor is his.
                     He starts angrily round now.</p>
                  <p>"Who was that?" he demands. "Of course Miss Inez knows nothing of this."</p>
                  <p>No one had accused her, but he is unconsciously defending her already.</p>
                  <p>"She must be told at once," he says. "I'll go and tell her myself. Edwards,
                     draw the curtains, will you, and light the candles?"</p>
                  <p>He leaves the room. The valet mechanically does as he is bid—the curtains are
                     drawn, the waxlights illumine the apartment. No one else stirs. The soft,
                     abundant light falls down upon that tranquil, marble face—upon that most awful
                     stain of blood.</p>
                  <p>The butler goes straight up to his young lady's room. Wayward, passionate,
                     proud Miss Inez may be, but she is very dear to him. He has carried her in his
                     arms many a time, a little laughing, black-eyed child. A vague, sickening fear
                     fills him now.</p>
                  <p>"She hated my lady," he thinks, in a dazed, helpless sort of way; "everybody
                     knows that. What will she say when she hears this?"</p>
                  <p>He knocks; there is no reply. He knocks again and calls huskily:</p>
                  <p>"Miss Inez, are you there? For the dear Lord's sake open the door!"</p>
                  <p>"Come in!" a voice answers.</p>
                  <p>He cannot tell whether it is Miss Inez or not. He opens the door and
                     enters.</p>
                  <p>This room is unlit too—the shine of the moon fills it as it fills that other
                     room below. Here too a solitary figure sits, crouches, rather, near the window
                     in a strange, distorted attitude of pain. He knows the flowing black hair, the
                     scarlet wrap—he cannot see her face, she does not look round.</p>
                  <p>"Miss Inez!"—his voice shakes—"I bring you bad news, awful news. Don't be
                     shocked—but—a murder has been done."</p>
                  <p>There is no answer. If she hears him she does not heed. She just sits still and
                     looks out into the night.</p>
                  <p>"Miss Inez! you hear me?"</p>
                  <p>He comes a little nearer—he tries to see her face.</p>
                  <p>"You hear me?" he repeats.</p>
                  <p>"I hear you."</p>
                  <p>The words drop like ice from her lips. One hand is clutching the arm of her
                     chair—her wide-open black eyes never turn from the night-scene.</p>
                  <p>"My lady is dead—cruelly murdered. O Miss Inez! do you
                        hear?—<emph>murdered!</emph> What is to be done?"</p>
                  <p>She does not answer. Her lips move, but no word comes. An awful fear begins to
                     fill the faithful servant's heart.</p>
                  <p>"Miss Inez!" he cries out, "you <emph>must</emph> come—they are waiting for you
                     below. There is no one here but you—Sir Victor is away. Sir Victor—"</p>
                  <p>His voice breaks; he takes out his handkerchief and sobs like a child.</p>
                  <p>"My dear young master! My dear young master! He loved the very ground she
                     walked on. Oh, who is to tell him this?"</p>
                  <p>She rises slowly now, like one who is cramped, and stiff, and cold. She looks
                     at the old man. In her eyes there is a blind, dazed sort of horror—on her face
                     there is a ghastliness no words can describe.</p>
                  <p>"Who is to tell Sir Victor?" the butler repeats. "It will kill him—the horror
                     of it. So pretty and so young—so sweet and so good. Oh, how could they do
                     it—how could they do it!"</p>
                  <p>She tries to speak once more—it seems as though her white lips cannot shape the
                     words. Old Hooper looks up at her piteously.</p>
                  <p>"Tell us what is to be done, Miss Inez," he implores; "you are mistress here
                     now."</p>
                  <p>She shrinks as if he had struck her.</p>
                  <p>"Shall we send for Sir Victor first?"</p>
                  <p>"Yes," she says, in a sort of whisper, "send for Sir Victor first."</p>
                  <p>The voice in which she speaks is not the voice of Inez Catheron. The butler
                     looks at her, that great fear in his eyes.</p>
                  <pb n="60-61" xml:id="VAC6448-00000030"/>
                  <p>"You haven't seen her, Miss Inez," he says. "It is a fearful sight—but—will you
                     come down?"</p>
                  <p>He almost dreads a refusal, but she does not refuse.</p>
                  <p>"I will go down," she answers, and turns at once to go.</p>
                  <p>The servants stand huddled together in the centre of the room. <emph>It</emph>
                     lies there, in its dreadful quiet, before them. Ever eye turns darkly upon Miss
                     Catheron as she comes in.</p>
                  <p>She never sees them. She advances like a sleep-walker, that dazed, dumb horror
                     still in her eyes, the whiteness of death on her face. She walks over and looks
                     down upon the dead mistress of Catheron Royals. No change comes over her—she
                     softens neither into pity nor tears. So long she stands there, so rigid she
                     looks, so threatening are the eyes that watch her, that Hooper interposes his
                     portly figure between her and them.</p>
                  <p>"Miss Inez," he says, "will you please give your orders? Shall I send for Sir
                     Victor at once, or—"</p>
                  <p>"Yes, send for Sir Victor at once." She arouses herself to say it. "And I think
                     you had better send to Chesholm for a doctor and—and the police."</p>
                  <p>"The police!"</p>
                  <p>"A murder has been committed," she says, in a cold, hard voice; "the murderer
                     must be found."</p>
                  <p>Something of her old calm, stately haughtiness returns as she speaks.</p>
                  <p>"This room must be cleared. Let no one touch <emph>her</emph>," she shudders
                     and looks away, "until Sir Victor comes. Ellen, Pool, Hooper, you three had
                     better remain to watch. Edwards, mount the fastest horse in the stables and
                     ride to Powyss Place for your life."</p>
                  <p>"Yes, miss," Edwards answers, in a low voice; "and please, miss, am I to tell
                     Sir Victor?"</p>
                  <p>She hesitates a moment—her face changes, her voice shakes a little for the
                     first time.</p>
                  <p>"Yes," she answers, faintly, "tell him."</p>
                  <p>Edwards leaves the room. She turns to another of the men servants.</p>
                  <p>"You will ride to Chesholm and fetch Dr. Dane. On your way stop at the police
                     station and apprise them. The rest of you go. Jane Pool, where is the
                     baby?"</p>
                  <p>"Up stairs in the night nursery," Jane Pool answers sullenly.</p>
                  <p>"And crying, too—I hear him. Hannah," to the under nurse, "go up and remain
                     with him. I am going to my own room. When," she pauses a second and speaks with
                     an effort, "when Sir Victor comes, you will receive your further orders from
                     him. I can do nothing more."</p>
                  <p>She left the room. Jane Pool looked ominously after her.</p>
                  <p>"No," she said, between her set lips; "you have done enough."</p>
                  <p>"Oh, Jane, hush!" Ellen whispers in terror.</p>
                  <p>There has still been no direct accusation, but they understand each other
                     perfectly.</p>
                  <p>"When the time comes to speak, you'll see whether I'll hush," retorts Jane.
                     "What was she doing in this room fifteen minutes before you found my lady dead?
                     Why wouldn't she let me in? why did she tell me a lie? what made her say my
                     lady was still asleep? Asleep! Oh, poor soul, to think of her being murdered
                     here, while we were all enjoying ourselves below. And if I hadn't took away the
                     baby its my opinion it would have been—"</p>
                  <p>"Oh, Jane!"</p>
                  <p>"'Oh, Jane,' as much as you please, it's the gospel truth. Them that killed the
                     mother hated the child. When the time comes I'll speak, if she was twice the
                     lady she is, Ellen!"</p>
                  <p>"Lor!" Ellen cried with a nervous jump, "don't speak so jerky Mrs. Pool. You
                     make my blood a mask of ice. "What is it?"</p>
                  <p>"Ellen," Jane Pool said solemnly, "where is the dagger?"</p>
                  <p>"What dagger?"</p>
                  <p>"The furrin dagger with the gold handle and the big ruby set in it, that my
                     lady used as a paper knife. I'll take my oath I saw it lying on the table
                     there, shining in the moonlight, when I took away baby. Where is it now?"</p>
                  <p>The dagger the nurse spoke of, was a curious Eastern knife, that had belonged
                     to Sir Victor's mother. It had a long, keen steel blade, a slim handle of
                     wrought gold set with a large ruby. Sir Victor's wife had taken a fancy to the
                     pretty Syrian toy, and converted it into a paper knife.</p>
                  <p>"I saw it on that there table when I took away baby,"<pb n="62-63"
                        xml:id="VAC6448-00000031"/> Jane said compressing her lips; "<emph>it</emph>
                     would do it. Where is it now?"</p>
                  <p>"Gone," Ellen answered. "Oh, Jane do you think—"</p>
                  <p>"She has been stabbed, you see, right through the heart, and there isn't much
                     blood. That devilish little glittering knife has done the deed. There it was
                     ready for its work, as if Satan himself had left it handy. Oh, poor lady—poor
                     lady! to think that the toy she used to play with, should one day take her
                     life!"</p>
                  <p>While they whispered in the death room, up in her chamber, while the hours of
                     the dreary night wore on, Inez Catheron sat, crouched in a heap, as Hooper had
                     found her, her face-hidden in her hands. Two hours had passed, an awful silence
                     filled the whole house, while she sat there and never stirred. As eleven struck
                     from the turret clock, the thunder of horses' hoofs on the avenue below, came
                     to her dulled ears. A great shudder shook her from head to foot—she lifted her
                     haggard face. The lull before the storm was over—Sir Victor Catheron had
                     come.</p>

                  <head type="sub">IN THE DARKNESS.</head>
                  <p>HALF an hour's rapid gallop had brought Edwards, the valet, to Powyss Place.
                     The stately mansion, park, lawn, and terraces, lay bathed in the silvery shower
                     of moonlight. From the upper windows, where the sick man lay, lights streamed;
                     all the rest of the house was in deep shadow.</p>
                  <p>In one of those dimly lighted rooms Sir Victor Catheron lay upon a lounge fast
                     asleep. He had remained for about two hours by the sick man's bedside; then,
                     persuaded by his aunt, had gone to lie down in an inner department.</p>
                  <p>"You look pale and ill yourself," she had said, tenderly; "lie down and rest
                     for a little. If I need you, I will call you at once."</p>
                  <p>He had obeyed, and had dropped off into a heavy sleep. A dull oppression of
                     heart and soul beset him; he had no mind to slumber—it had come upon him
                     unawares. He was awakened suddenly by some one calling his name.</p>
                  <p>"Victor! Victor!" the voice called, "awake!"</p>
                  <p>He sat up with a bewildered face. Was that his aunt's voice, so hoarse, so
                     strange? Was this his aunt with that white, horror-struck face?</p>
                  <p>"Victor!" she cried, the words a very wail. "Oh, my boy! my boy! how shall I
                     ever tell you? Oh, why did I send for you this dreadful night? Ethel"—her voice
                     choked.</p>
                  <p>He rose to his feet, staring at her blankly.</p>
                  <p>"Ethel!" he repeated. "Ethel—"</p>
                  <p>She covered her face with her hands and burst into a hysterical outbreak of
                     tears. Edwards, standing behind her in the doorway, made a step forward.</p>
                  <p>"Tell him, Edwards," said Lady Helena. "I cannot. It seems too horrible to tell
                     or to believe. Oh, my poor Victor! my poor, poor boy!"</p>
                  <p>Edwards came forward reluctantly, with a very pale, scared face.</p>
                  <p>"It's dreadful news, Sir Victor—I don't know how to tell you, but my lady, I'm
                     afraid she—she's dead."</p>
                  <p>"Dead!"</p>
                  <p>He repeated the word dully, staring almost stupidly at the speaker.</p>
                  <p>"Dead, Sir Victor!" the man repeated, solemnly. "I'm sore afraid,
                     murdered!"</p>
                  <p>There was a sudden, headlong rush from the room; no other reply. Like a flash
                     Sir Victor passed them both. They heard him clear the stairs, rush along the
                     lower hall, and out of the house. The next instant the valet and Lady Helena
                     were in pursuit.</p>
                  <p>He was mounted on Edwards' horse and dashing furiously away, before they
                     reached the court-yard. They called to him—he neither heard nor heeded. He
                     dashed his spurred heel into the horse's side and flew out of sight like the
                     wind.</p>
                  <p>"Follow him!" Lady Helena cried, breathlessly, to the groom. "Overtake him, for
                     the love of Heaven! Oh, <emph>who</emph>
                     <pb n="64-65" xml:id="VAC6448-00000032"/> can have done this awful deed?
                     Edwards, you are sure there is no mistake? It seems too unnatural, too
                     impossible to believe."</p>
                  <p>"There is no mistake, my lady," the man answered, sadly. "I saw her myself, the
                     blood flowing where they had stabbed her, cold and dead."</p>
                  <p>Lady Helena wrung her hands and turned away.</p>
                  <p>"Ride for your life after your master!" she said. "I will follow you as soon as
                     I can."</p>
                  <p>She went back to her husband's side. He was no worse—he seemed if anything,
                     better. She might leave him in her housekeeper's charge until morning.</p>
                  <p>She ordered the carriage and rapidly changed her dress. It was about one in the
                     morning when she reached Catheron Royals. The tall turrets were silvered in the
                     moonlight, the windows sparkled in the crystal light. The sweet beauty and
                     peace of the September night lay like a benediction over the earth. And, amid
                     all the silence and sweetness, a foul, a most horrible murder had been
                     done.</p>
                  <p>She encountered Mrs. Marsh, the housekeeper, in the hall, her face pale, her
                     eyes red with weeping. Some dim hope that up to this time had upheld her, that,
                     after all, there <emph>might</emph> be a mistake, died out then.</p>
                  <p>"Oh, Marsh," she said, piteously, "<emph>is</emph> it true?"</p>
                  <p>Mrs. Marsh's answer was a fresh burst of tears. Like all the rest of the
                     household, the gentle ways, the sweet face, and soft voice of Sir Victor's wife
                     had won her heart from the first.</p>
                  <p>"It is too true, my lady—the Lord have mercy upon us all. It seems too horrid
                     for belief, but it is true. As she lay asleep there, four hours ago, in her own
                     house, surrounded by her own servants, some monster in human form stabbed her
                     through the heart—through the heart, my lady—Dr. Dane says one blow did it, and
                     that death must have been instantaneous. So young, so sweet, and so lovely. Oh,
                     how could they do it—how could any one do it?"</p>
                  <p>Mrs. Marsh's sobs grew hysterical. Lady Helena's own tears were flowing.</p>
                  <p>"I feel as though I were guilty in some way myself," the housekeeper went on.
                     "If we had only woke her up, or fastened the window, or anything! I know the
                     monster, whoever he was, got in through the window. And, oh, my lady!"—Mrs.
                     Marsh wiped her eyes suddenly, and lowered her voice to an excited whisper—"I
                     wish you would speak to Jane Pool, the nurse. She doesen't dare say anything
                     out openly, but the looks she gives, and the hints she drops, are almost worse
                     than the murder itself. You can see as clear as day that she suspects—Miss
                     Inez."</p>
                  <p>"Marsh! Great Heaven!" Lady Helena cried, recoiling in horror. "Miss Inez!"</p>
                  <p>"Oh, my lady, <emph>I</emph> don't say it—<emph>I</emph> don't think it—Heaven
                     forbid!—it's only that wicked, spiteful nurse, Pool. She hates Miss Inez—she
                     has hated her from the first—and she loved my lady. Ah! who could help being
                     fond of her—poor, lovely young lady!—with a sweet smile and pleasant word for
                     every one in the house? And you know Miss Inez's high, haughty way. Jane Pool
                     hates her, and will do her mischief if she can. A word from you might check
                     her. No one knows the harm a babbling tongue may do."</p>
                  <p>Lady Helena drew herself up proudly.</p>
                  <p>"I shall not say one word to her, Marsh. Jane Pool can do my niece no harm. The
                     bare repetition of it is an insult. Miss Catheron—that I should have to say
                     such a thing!—is above suspicion."</p>
                  <p>"My lady, I believe it; still, if you would only speak to her. You don't know
                     all. She saw Miss Inez coming out of the nursery a quarter of an hour before we
                     found Lady Catheron dead. She wished to enter, and Miss Inez ordered her away.
                     She has been talking to the police, and I saw that Inspector Darwin watching
                     Miss Inez in a way that made my blood run cold."</p>
                  <p>But Lady Helena waived the topic away haughtily.</p>
                  <p>"Be silent, Marsh! I will not hear another word of this—it is too horrible!
                     Where is Miss Inez?"</p>
                  <p>"In her own room, my lady. And—I beg your pardon for alluding to it again—but I
                     think she suspects. She seemed dazed-like, stupefied at first; she is more like
                     herself now. Will you not go in and see <emph>her</emph>, poor soul, before you
                     go to Miss Inez? Oh, my lady, my lady! it breaks my heart when I look at
                     her—when I look at Sir Victor."</p>
                  <p>For a moment Lady Helena shrank.</p>
                  <pb n="66-67" xml:id="VAC6448-00000033"/>
                  <p>"Sir Victor is in there—with her?" she faltered.</p>
                  <p>"Yes, my lady—like a man all struck stupid. It frightens me to see him. If he
                     would only speak, or cry, or fly out against the murderer—but he just sits
                     there as if turning to stone."</p>
                  <p>His aunt covered her face for an instant with both hands, heart-sick with all
                     these horrors; then she looked up, and moved forward.</p>
                  <p>"Where is she?" she asked—"in which room?"</p>
                  <p>"In the white drawing-room, my lady; the doctors brought her there. Sir Victor
                     is with her, alone."</p>
                  <p>Lady Helen slowly advanced. At the door she paused a moment to nerve herself
                     for what she must see; then she turned the handle and went in.</p>
                  <p>It was one of the stateliest rooms in the house—all white and gold, and dimly
                     lit now by wax tapers. Lying on one of the white velvet sofas she saw a rigid
                     figure, over which a white covering was drawn; but the golden hair and the
                     fair, marble face gleaming in the waxlights as beautiful as ever in life.</p>
                  <p>He sat beside his dead—almost as motionless, almost as cold, almost as white.
                     He had loved her with a love that was akin to idolatrous—he had grudged that
                     the eye of man should rest on his treasure—and now he sat beside her—dead.</p>
                  <p>If he heard the door open, he neither moved nor stirred. He never once looked
                     up as his aunt came forward; his eyes were riveted upon that ineffably calm
                     face with a vacant, sightless sort of stare that chilled her blood.</p>
                  <p>"Victor!" she cried out, in a frightened voice; "Victor speak to me. For pity's
                     sake, don't look like that?"</p>
                  <p>The dull, blinded eyes looked up at her, full of infinite, unutterable
                     despair.</p>
                  <p>"She it dead," he said, in a slow, dragging sort of voice—"dead! And last night
                     I left her well and happy—left her to be murdered—to—be—murdered."</p>
                  <p>The slow words fell heavily from his lips—his eyes went back to her face, his
                     dulled mind seemed lapsing into its stupefied trance of quiet. More and more
                     alarmed, his aunt gazed at him. Had the death of his wife turned his brain?</p>
                  <p>"Victor!" she exclaimed, almost angrily, "you must rouse yourself. You must not
                     stay here. Be a man! Wake up. Your wife has been murdered. Go and find her
                     murderer."</p>
                  <p>"Her murderer," he replied, in the same slow tone of unnatural quiet; "her
                     murderer. It seems strange, Aunt Helena, doesn't it, that any one
                        <emph>could</emph> murder her? 'I must find her murderer.' Oh," he cried,
                     suddenly, in a voice of anguish; "what does it matter about her murderer! It
                     won't bring her back to life. She is dead I tell you—dead!"</p>
                  <p>He flung himself off his chair, on his knees by the couch. He drew down the
                     white satin counterpane, and pointed to that one dark, small stab on the left
                     side.</p>
                  <p>"Look!" he said, in a shrill, wailing voice, "through the heart—through the
                     heart! She did not suffer—the doctors say <emph>that</emph>. Through the heart
                     as she slept. Oh, my love, my darling, my wife!"</p>
                  <p>He kissed the wound—he kissed the hands, the face, the hair. Then with a long,
                     low moan of utter desolation, he drew back the covering and buried his face in
                     it.</p>
                  <p>"Leave me alone," he said, despairingly; "I will not go—I will never go from
                     her again. She was mine in life—mine only. Juan Catheron lied, she is mine in
                     death. My wife—my Ethel!"</p>
                  <p>He started up as suddenly as he had flung himself down, his ghastly face
                     flaming dark red.</p>
                  <p>"Leave me alone, I tell you! Why do you all come here? I will <emph>not</emph>
                     go! Leave me, I command you—I am master here!"</p>
                  <p>She shrank from him in absolute physical terror. Never over-strong at any time,
                     her worst fears were indeed true, the shock of his wife's tragic death was
                     turning Sir Victor's brain. There was nothing to be done—nothing to be said—he
                     must be obeyed—must be soothed.</p>
                  <p>"Dear Victor," she said, "I will go. Don't be hard with poor Aunt Helena. There
                     is no one in all this world as sorry for you as I am. Only tell me this before
                     I leave you—shall we not send for her father and mother?"</p>
                  <p>"No," he answered, in the same fierce tone; "they can't bring her back to
                     life—no one can now. I don't want them. I want nobody. Ethel is mine I tell
                     you—mine alone!"</p>
                  <pb n="68-69" xml:id="VAC6448-00000034"/>
                  <p>He motioned her imperiously to leave him—a light in his eye—a flush on his face
                     there was no mistaking. She went at once. How was it all to end she wondered,
                     more and more sick at heart—this mysterious murder, this suspicion against
                     Inez, this dreadful overthrow of her nephew's mind?</p>
                  <p>"May Heaven help us!" she cried. "What have we done that this awful trouble
                     should come upon us!"</p>
                  <p>"Aunt Helena."</p>
                  <p>She looked round with a little cry, all her nerves trembling and unstrung. Inez
                     stood before her—Inez with dark, resolute eyes, and stony face.</p>
                  <p>"I have been waiting for you—they told me you were <emph>there</emph>." She
                     pointed with a shudder to the door. "What are we to do?"</p>
                  <p>"Don't ask me," Lady Helena answered, helplessly. "I don't know. I feel stunned
                     and stupid with all these horrors."</p>
                  <p>"The police are here," Miss Catheron went on, "and the coroner has been
                     apprised. I suppose they will hold an inquest to-morrow."</p>
                  <p>Her aunt looked at her in surprise. The calm, cold tone of her voice grated on
                     her sick heart.</p>
                  <p>"Have you seen <emph>him?</emph>" she asked almost in a whisper. "Inez—I fear—I
                     fear it is turning his brain."</p>
                  <p>Miss Catheron's short, scornful upper lip, curled with the old look of
                     contempt.</p>
                  <p>"The Catheron brain was never noted for its strength. I shall not be surprised
                     at all. Poor wretch!" She turned away and looked out into the darkness. "It
                     does seem hard on him."</p>
                  <p>"Who can have done it?"</p>
                  <p>The question on every lip rose to Lady Helena's, but somehow she could not
                     utter it. Did Inez know of the dark, <choice>
                        <sic>sinster</sic>
                        <corr>sinister</corr>
                     </choice> suspicion against herself? <choice>
                        <sic>Coulds</sic>
                        <corr>Could</corr>
                     </choice> he know and be calm like this?</p>
                  <p>"I forgot to ask for Uncle Godfrey," Inez's quiet voice said again. "Of course
                     he is better, or even at such a time as this you would not be here?"</p>
                  <p>"He is better, Inez," she broke out desperately. "Who can have done this? She
                     had not an enemy in the world. Is—is there any one suspected?"</p>
                  <p>"There is," Inez answered, turning from the window, and facing her aunt. "The
                     servants suspect <emph>me</emph>."</p>
                  <p>"Inez!"</p>
                  <p>"Their case isn't a bad one as they make it out," pursued Miss Catheron, cooly.
                     "There was ill blood between us. It is of no use denying it. I hated her with
                     my whole heart. I was the last person seen coming out of the room, fifteen
                     minutes before they found her dead. Jane Pool says I refused to let her go
                     in—perhaps I did. It is quite likely. About an hour previously we had a violent
                     quarrel. The ubiquitous Mrs. Pool overheard that also. You see her case is
                     rather a strong one."</p>
                  <p>"But—Inez—!"</p>
                  <p>"I chanced to overhear all this," still went on Miss Catheron, quietly, but
                     with set lips and gleaming eyes. "Jane Pool was holding forth to the inspector
                     of police. I walked up to them, and they both slunk away like beaten curs.
                     Orders have been issued, that no one is to leave the house. To-morrow these
                     facts are to be placed before the coroner's jury. If they find me guilty—don't
                     cry, Aunt Helena—I shall be sorry for <emph>you</emph>—sorry I have disgraced a
                     good old name. For the rest, it doesn't much matter what becomes of such a
                     woman as I am."</p>
                  <p>She turned again to the window and looked out into the darkness. There was a
                     desperate bitterness in her tone that Lady Helena could not understand.</p>
                  <p>"Good Heaven!" she burst forth, "one would think you were all in a conspiracy
                     to drive me mad. It doesn't matter, what becomes of you, doesn't it? I tell you
                     if this last worst misery falls upon us, it will kill me on the spot; just
                     that."</p>
                  <p>The girl sighed drearily.</p>
                  <p>"Kill you, Aunt Helena," she repeated, mournfully. "No—we don't any of us die
                     so easily. Don't be afraid—I am not likely to talk in this way before any one
                     but you. I am only telling you the truth. They will have the inquest, and all
                     that Jane Pool can say against me will be said. Do you think Victor will be
                     able to appear?"</p>
                  <p>"I don't think Victor is in a condition to appear at an<pb n="70-71"
                        xml:id="VAC6448-00000035"/> inquest or anywhere else. Ah, poor boy! he loved
                     her so dearly, it is enough to shake the mind of a stronger man."</p>
                  <p>But Miss Catheron was dead silent—it was evident her feelings here were as
                     bitter as ever—that even the tragic death of her rival had not softened
                     her.</p>
                  <p>"He will survive it," she answered, in the same half-contemptuous tone. "Men
                     have died and worms have eaten them, but not for love."</p>
                  <p>"Inez," said her aunt, suddenly coming a step nearer, "a rumor has reached
                     me—is it true?—that Juan is back—that he has been here?"</p>
                  <p>"It is quite true," her niece answered, without turning round; "he
                        <emph>has</emph> been here. He was here on the night Lady Catheron first
                     came."</p>
                  <p>"There is another rumor afloat, that there was a violent quarrel on that
                     occasion—that he claimed to be an old lover of Ethel's, poor child, and that
                     Victor turned him out. Since then it is said he has been seen more than once
                     prowling about the grounds. For everybody's sake I hope it is not true."</p>
                  <p>Inez faced round suddenly—almost fiercely.</p>
                  <p>"And what if I say it <emph>is</emph> true, in every respect? He did come—there
                     was a quarrel, and Victor ordered him out. Since then he has been
                     here—prowling, as you call it—trying to see me, trying to force me to give him
                     money. I was flinty as usual, and would give him none. Where is the crime in
                     all that?"</p>
                  <p>"Has he gone?" was Lady Helena's response.</p>
                  <p>"I believe so—I hope so. He had nothing to stay for. Of course he has
                     gone."</p>
                  <p>"I am glad of that, at least. And now, as it seems I can do nothing more at
                     present, I will return home. Watch Victor, Inez—he needs it, believe me. I will
                     return at the earliest possible moment to-morrow."</p>
                  <p>So, in the chill gray of the fast-coming morning, Lady Helena, very
                     heavy-hearted, returned to Powyss Place and her sick husband's bedside.</p>
                  <p>Meantime matters were really beginning to look dark for Miss Catheron. The
                     superintendent of the district, Mr. Ferrick, was filling his note-book with
                     very ominous information. She had loved Sir Victor—she had hated Sir Victor
                     tor's wife—they had led a cat-and-dog life from the first—an hour before the
                     murder they had had a violent quarrel—Lady Catheron had threatened to make her
                     husband turn her out of the house on the morrow. At eight o'clock, Jane Pool
                     had left the nursery with the baby, my lady peacefully asleep in her chair—the
                     Eastern poniard on the table. At half-past eight, returning to arouse my lady,
                     she had encountered Miss Inez coming out of the nursery, and Miss Inez had
                     ordered her sharply away, telling her my lady was still asleep. A quarter of
                     nine, Ellen, the maid, going to the room, found my lady stone dead, stabbed
                     through the heart. Miss Inez, when summoned by Hooper, is ghastly pale at
                     first, and hardly seems to know what she is doing or saying. A very pretty case
                     of tragedy in high life, Superintendent Ferrick thinks, pursing up his lips
                     with professional zest, and not the first murder jealousy has made fine ladies
                     commit, either. Now if that Turkish dagger would only turn up.</p>
                  <p>Two policemen are sent quietly in search of it through the grounds. It isn't
                     likely they'll find it, still it will do no harm to try. He finds out which are
                     Miss Catheron's rooms, and keeps his official eye upon them. He goes through
                     the house with the velvet tread of a cat. In the course of his wanderings
                     everywhere, he brings up presently in the stables, and finds them untenanted,
                     save by one lad, who sits solitary among the straw. He is rather a dull-looking
                     youth, with a florid, vacant face at most times, but looking dazed and anxious
                     just now. "Something on <emph>his</emph> mind," thinks the superintendent, and
                     sits sociably down on a box beside him at once.</p>
                  <p>"Now, my man," Mr. Ferrick says, pleasantly, "and what is it that's troubling
                        <emph>you?</emph> Out with it—every little's a help in a case like
                     this."</p>
                  <p>The lad—his name is Jimmy—does not need pressing—his secret has been weighing
                     uneasily upon him for the last hour or more, ever since he heard of the murder,
                     in fact, and he pours his revelation into the superintendent's eager ear. His
                     revelation is this:</p>
                  <p>Last evening, just about dusk, strolling by chance in the direction of the
                     Laurel walk, he heard voices raised and angry in the walk—the voices of a man
                     and a woman. He<pb n="72-73" xml:id="VAC6448-00000036"/> had peeped through the
                     branches and seen my lady and a very tall man. No, it wasn't Sir Victor—it was
                     a much bigger man, with long black curling hair. Didn't see his face. It was
                     dark in there among the trees. Wasn't sure, but it struck him it might be the
                     tall, black-avised man, who came first the night Sir Victor brought home my
                     lady, and who had been seen skulking about the park once or twice since. Had
                     heard a whisper, that the man was Miss Inez's brother—didn't know himself. All
                     he did know was, that my lady and a man were quarrelling on the evening of the
                     murder in the Laurel walk. What were they quarrelling about? Well, he couldn't
                     catch their talk very well—it was about money he thought. The man wanted money
                     and jewels, and my lady wouldn't give 'em. He threatened to do something or
                     tell something; then <emph>she</emph> threatened to have him put in Chesholm
                     jail if he did. He, Jimmy, though full of curiosity, was afraid the man would
                     spring out and catch him, and so at that juncture he came away. There! that was
                     all, if it did the gentleman any good, he was welcome to it.</p>
                  <p>It did the gentleman a world of good—it complicated matters beautifully. Five
                     minutes ago the case looked dark as night for Miss Catheron—here was a rift in
                     her sky. Who was this man—<emph>was</emph> it Miss Catheron's scapegrace
                     brother? Jimmy could tell him nothing more. "If you wants to find out about
                     Miss Inez' brother," said Jimmy, "you go to old Hooper. <emph>He</emph> knows.
                     All <emph>I</emph> know is, that they say he was an uncommon bad lot; but old
                     Hooper, he's knowed him ever since he was a young'un and lived here. If old
                     Hooper says he wasn't here the night Sir Victor brought my lady home, don't you
                     believe him—he was, and he's been seen off and on in the grounds since. The
                     women folks in the servants' hall, they say, as how he must have been an old
                     sweetheart of my lady's. You go to old Hooper and worrit it out of him."</p>
                  <p>Mr. Superintendent Ferrick went. How artfully he began his work, how delicately
                     and skillfully he "pumped" old Hooper dry, no words can tell. Mr. Juan Catheron
                        <emph>was</emph> an "uncommon bad lot," he had come to the house and forced
                     an entrance into the dining-room the night of Lady Catheron's arrival—there had
                     been a quarrel, and he had been compelled to leave. Bit by bit this was drawn
                     from Mr. Hooper. Since then, Jackson, the head groom, and Edwards, the valet,
                     had seen him hovering about the grounds watching the house.</p>
                  <p>Mr. Ferrick ponders these things in his heart, and is still. This vagabond,
                     Juan Catheron, follows my lady to Catheron Royals, is expelled, haunts the
                     grounds, and a man answering to his description is discovered quarrelling with
                     my lady, demanding money, etc., two or three hours before the murder. The
                     window of the room, in which she takes that fatal sleep, opens on the lawn; any
                     one may enter who sees fit. No one is about. The Oriental dagger lies
                     convenient to his hand on the table. "Here, now," says Mr. Ferrick
                        <emph>to</emph> Mr. Ferrick, with a reflective frown, "which is guilty—the
                     brother or sister?"</p>
                  <p>He goes and gives an order to one of his men, and the man <choice>
                        <sic>startes</sic>
                        <corr>starts</corr>
                     </choice> in search of Mr. Juan Catheron. Mr. Catheron must be found, though
                     they summon the detectives of Scotland Yard to aid them in their search.</p>
                  <p>The dull hours wear on—the new day, sunny and bright, is with them. The white
                     drawing-room is darkened—the master of Catheron Royals sits there alone with
                     his dead. And presently the coroner comes, and talks with the superintendent,
                     and they enter softly and look at the murdered lady. The coroner departs
                     again—a jury is summoned, and the inquest is fixed to begin at noon next day in
                     the "Mitre" tavern at Chesholm.</p>
                  <p>Lady Helena returns and goes at once to her nephew. Inez, in spite of her
                     injunctions, has never been near him once. He sits there still, as she left him
                     many hours ago; he has never stirred or spoken since. Left to himself he is
                     almost apathetic in his quiet—he rouses into fury, when they strive to take him
                     away. As the dusk falls, Lady Helena, passing the door, hears him softly
                     talking to the dead, and once—oh, pitiful Heaven! she hears a low,
                     blood-chilling laugh. She opens the door and goes in. He is kneeling besides
                     the sofa, holding the stark figure in his arms, urging her to get up and
                     dress.</p>
                  <p>"It is a lovely night, Ethel," he says; "the moon is shining, and you know, you
                     like to walk out on moonlight nights. Do you remember, love, those nights at
                     Margate, when we walked together first on the sands? Ah! you never lay like<pb
                        n="74-75" xml:id="VAC6448-00000037"/> this, cold and still, then. Do get up,
                     Ethel!" petulantly this; "I am tired of sitting here and waiting for you to
                     awake. You have slept long enough. Get up!"</p>
                  <p>He tries to lift her. Horror struck, Lady Helena catches him in time to prevent
                     it.</p>
                  <p>"Victor, Victor!" she cries, "for the love of Heaven put her down. Come away.
                     Don't you know she is dead?"</p>
                  <p>He lifts his dim eyes to her face, blind with the misery of a dumb animal.</p>
                  <p>"<emph>Dead!</emph>" he whispers.</p>
                  <p>Then with a low, moaning gasp, he falls back in her arms, fainting wholly
                     away.</p>
                  <p>Her cries bring aid—they lift him and carry him up to his room, undress and
                     place him in bed. The family physician is summoned—feels his pulse, hears what
                     Lady Helena has to say, and looks very grave. The shock has been too much for a
                     not overstrong body or mind. Sir Victor is in imminent danger of brain
                     fever.</p>
                  <p>The night shuts down. A messenger comes to Lady Helena saying the squire is
                     much better, and she makes up her mind to remain all night. Inez comes, pale
                     and calm, and also takes her place by the stricken man's bedside, a great
                     sadness and pity for the first time on her face. The White Room is locked—Lady
                     Helena keeps the key—one pale light burns dimly in its glittering vastness. And
                     as the night closes in blackness over the doomed house, one of the policemen
                     comes in haste to Superintendent Ferrick, triumph in his face. He has found the
                     dagger.</p>
                  <p>Mr. Ferrick opens his eyes rather—it is more than he expected.</p>
                  <p>"A bungler," he mutters, "whoever did it. Jones, where did you find this?"</p>
                  <p>Jones explains.</p>
                  <p>Near the entrance gates there is a wilderness of fern, or bracken, as high as
                     your waist. Hidden in the midst of this unlikely place Jones has found the
                     dagger. It is as if the party, going down the avenue, had flung it in.</p>
                  <p>"Bungler," Superintendent Ferrick says again. "It's bad enough to be a murderer
                     without being a fool."</p>
                  <p>He takes the dagger. No doubt about the work it has done. It is incrusted with
                     blood—dry, dark, and clotted up to the hilt. A strong, sure hand had certainly
                     done the deed. For the first time the thought strikes him—<emph>could</emph> a
                     woman's hand, strike that one strong, sure, deadly blow? Miss Catheron is a
                     fragile-looking young lady, with a waist he could span, slim little fingers,
                     and a delicate wrist. Could she strike this blow—it is quite evident only one
                     has been struck.</p>
                  <p>"And besides," says Superintendent Ferrick, argumentatively to himself, "it's
                     fifteen minutes' fast walking from the house to the gates. Fifteen minutes only
                     elapse between the time Nurse Pool sees her come out of the nursery and Maid
                     Ellen finds her mistress murdered. And I'll be sworn, she hasn't been out of
                     the house to-day. All last night they <emph>say</emph> she kept herself shut up
                     in her room. Suppose she wasn't—suppose she went out last night and tried to
                     hide it, is it likely—come, I say! is it likely, she would take and throw it
                     right in the very spot, where it was sure to be found? A Tartar that young
                     woman is, I have no doubt, but she's a long way off being a fool. She may know
                        <emph>who</emph> has done this murder, but I'll stake my professional
                     reputation, in spite of Mrs. Pool, that she never did it herself."</p>
                  <p>A thin, drizzling rain comes on with the night, the trees drip, drip in a
                     feeble melancholy sort of way, the wind has a lugubrious sob in its voice, and
                     it is intensely dark. It is about nine o'clock, when Miss Catheron rises from
                     her place by the sick-bed and goes out of the room. In the corridor she stands
                     a moment, with the air of one who looks, and listens. She sees no one. The dark
                     figure of a woman, who hovers afar off and watches her, is there, but lost in a
                     shadowy corner; a woman, who since the murder, has never entirely lost sight of
                     her. Miss Catheron does not see her, she takes up a shawl, wraps it 'about her,
                     over her head, walks rapidly along the passage, down a back stairway, out of a
                     side door, little used, and so out into the dark, dripping, sighing night.</p>
                  <p>There are the Chesholm constabulary on guard on the wet grass and gravel
                     elsewhere—there are none here. But the quiet figure of Jane Pool has followed
                     her, like her shadow, and Jane Pool's face, peers cautiously out from the
                     half-open door.</p>
                  <p>In that one instant while she waits, she misses her prey<pb n="76-77"
                        xml:id="VAC6448-00000038"/> —she emerges, but in the darkness nothing is to
                     be seen or heard.</p>
                  <p>As she stands irresolute, she suddenly hears a low, distinct whistle to the
                     left. It may be the call of a night-bird—it may be a signal.</p>
                  <p>She glides to the left, straining her eyes through the gloom. It is many
                     minutes before she can see anything, except the vaguely waving trees—then a
                     fiery spark, a red eye glows through the night. She has run her prey to
                     earth—it is the lighted tip of a cigar.</p>
                  <p>She draws near—her heart throbs. Dimly she sees the tall figure of a man; close
                     to him the slender, slighter figure of a woman. They are talking in whispers,
                     and she is mortally afraid of coming too close. What is to keep them from
                     murdering her too?</p>
                  <p>"I tell you, you <emph>must</emph> go, and at once," are the first words, she
                     hears Inez Catheron speaking, in a passionate, intense whisper. "I tell you I
                     am suspected already; do you think <emph>you</emph> can escape much longer? If
                     you have any feeling for yourself, for me, go, go, I beseech you, at once! They
                     are searching for you now, I warn you, and if they find you—"</p>
                  <p>"If they find me," the man retorts, doggedly, "it can't be much worse than it
                     is. Things have been so black with me for years, that they can't be much
                     blacker. But I'll go. I'm not over anxious to stay, Lord knows. Give me the
                     money and I'll be off."</p>
                  <p>She takes from her bosom a package, and hands it to him; by the glow of the red
                     cigar-tip Jane sees her.</p>
                  <p>"It is all I have—all I can get, jewels and all," she says; "enough to keep you
                     for years with care. Now go, and never come back—your coming has done evil
                     enough, surely."</p>
                  <p>Jane Pool catches the words—the man mutters some sullen, inaudible reply. Inez
                     Catheron speaks again in the same passionate voice.</p>
                  <p>"How dare you say so?" she cries, stamping her foot. "You wretch! whom it is my
                     bitterest shame to call brother. But for you <emph>she</emph> would be alive
                     and well. Do you think I do not know it? Go—living or dead, I never want to
                     look upon your face again!"</p>
                  <p>Jane Pool hears those terrible words and stands paralyzed. Can it be, that Miss
                     Inez is not the murderess after all? The man retorts again—she does not hear
                     how—then plunges into the woodland and disappears. An instant the girl stands
                     motionless looking after him, then she turns and walks rapidly back into the
                     house.</p>

                  <p>THE Monday morning edition of the <title>Chesholm Courier</title>, September
                     19th, 18—, contained the following, eagerly devoured by every man and woman in
                     the county, able to read at all:</p>
                  <div type="section">
                     <head>THE TRAGEDY AT CATHERON ROYALS.</head>
                     <p>"In all the annals of mysterious crime (began the editor, with intense
                        evident relish), nothing more mysterious, or more awful, has ever been
                        known, than the recent tragedy at Catheron Royals. In the annals of our
                        town, of our county, of our country we may almost say, it stands
                        unparalleled in its atrocity. A young and lovely lady, wedded little better
                        than a year, holding the very highest position in society, in the sacred
                        privacy of her own household, surrounded by faithful servants, is struck
                        down by the dagger of the assassin. Her youth, her beauty, the sanctity of
                        slumber, all were powerless to shield her. Full of life, and hope, and
                        happiness, she is foully and hideously murdered—her babe left motherless,
                        her young husband bereaved and desolate. If anything were needed to make the
                        dreadful tragedy yet more dreadful, it is, that Sir Victor Catheron lies, as
                        we write, hovering between life and death. The blow, which struck her down,
                        has stricken him too—has laid him upon what may be his death-bed. At present
                        he lies mercifully unconscious of his terrible loss tossing in the delirium
                        of violent brain fever.</p>
                     <p>"Who, we ask, is safe after this? A lady of the very highest<pb n="78-79"
                           xml:id="VAC6448-00000039"/> est rank, in her own home, surrounded by her
                        servants, in open day, is stabbed to the heart. Who, we ask again, is safe
                        after this? Who was the assassin—what was the motive? Does that assassin yet
                        lurk in our midst? Let it be the work of the coroner and his jury to
                        discover the terrible secret, to bring the wretch to justice. And it is the
                        duty of every man and woman in Chesholm to aid, if they can, that
                        discovery."</p>

                     <head>From Tuesday's Edition.</head>
                     <p>The inquest began at one o'clock yesterday in the parlor of the Mitre Inn,
                        Lady Helena Powyss, of Powyss Place, and Miss Inez Catheron being present.
                        The first witness called was Ellen Butters.</p>
                     <p>ELLEN BUTTERS sworn.—"I was Lady Catheron's maid; I was engaged in London
                        and came down with her here; on the afternoon of Friday, 16th, I last saw my
                        lady alive, about half-past six in the afternoon; she had dressed for
                        dinner; the family dinner hour is seven; saw nothing unusual about her; well
                        yes, she seemed a little out of spirits, but was gentle and patient as
                        usual; when I had finished dressing her she threw her shawl about her, and
                        took a book, and said she would go out a few minutes and take the air; she
                        did go out, and I went down to the servant's hall; sometime after seven Jane
                        Pool, the nurse, came down in a great flurry and said—"</p>
                     <p>THE CORONER.—"Young woman we don't want to hear what Jane Pool said and did.
                        We want to know what you saw yourself."</p>
                     <p>ELLEN BUTTERS (sulkily).—"Very well, that's what I'm trying to tell you. If
                        Jane Pool hadn't said Sir Victor had gone off to Powyss Place, and that she
                        didn't think it would be proper to disturb my lady just then, I would have
                        gone up to my lady for orders. Jane had her supper and went up to the
                        nursery for baby. She came back again after awhile—it was just past eight—in
                        a temper, saying she had left my lady asleep when she took away baby, and
                        returned to awake her. She had met Miss Inez who ordered her away about her
                        business, saying my lady was still asleep. Jane Pool said—"</p>
                     <p>THE CORONER—"Young woman, we <emph>don't</emph> want to hear what Jane Pool
                        said. Jane Pool will tell her own story presently; we won't trouble you to
                        tell both. At what hour did you go up to the nursery yourself?"</p>
                     <p>ELLEN BUTTERS (more sulkily).—"I disremember; it was after eight. I could
                        tell all about it better, if you wouldn't keep interrupting and putting me
                        out. It was about a quarter or twenty minutes past eight, I think—"</p>
                     <p>THE CORONER (dogmatically).—"What you think won't do. Be more precise if you
                        please, and keep your temper. What o'clock was it, I say, when you went up
                        to the nursery?"</p>
                     <p>ELLEN BUTTERS (excitedly).—"It was about a quarter or twenty minutes past
                        eight—how can I know any surer when I <emph>don't</emph> know. I don't carry
                        a watch, and didn't look at the clock. I'm sure I never expected to be
                        badgered about it in this way. I said I'd go and wake my lady up, and not
                        leave her there to catch her death, in spite of fifty Miss Catherons. I
                        rapped at the door and got no answer, then I opened it and went in. There
                        was no light, but the moon was shining bright and clear, and I saw my lady
                        sitting, with her shawl around her, in the arm-chair. I thought she was
                        asleep and called her—there was no answer. I called again, and put my hand
                        on her bosom to arouse her. Something wet my hand—it was blood. I looked at
                        her closer, and saw blood on her dress, and oozing in a little stream from
                        the left breast. Then I knew she had been killed. I ran screaming from the
                        room, and down among the rest of the servants. I told them—I didn't know
                        how. And I don't remember any more, for I fell in a faint. When I came to I
                        was alone—the rest were up in the nursery. I got up and joined them—that's
                        everything I know about it."</p>
                     <p>Ellen Butters retired, and William Hooper was called. This is Mr. Hooper's
                        evidence:</p>
                     <p>"I have been butler in Sir Victor Catheron's family for twenty years. On the
                        night of Friday last, as I sat in the servants' hall after supper, the young
                        woman, Ellen Butters, my lady's London maid, came screeching downstairs like
                        a creature gone mad, that my lady was murdered, and frightened us all out of
                        our senses. As she was always a flighty young person, I didn't believe her.
                        I ordered her<pb n="80-81" xml:id="VAC6448-00000040"/> to be quiet, and tell
                        us what she meant. Instead of doing it she gave a sort of gasp and fell
                        fainting down in a heap. I made them lay her down on the floor, and then
                        follow me up to the nursery. We went in a body—I at the head. There was no
                        light but the moonlight in the room. My lady lay back in the arm-chair, her
                        eyes closed, bleeding and quite dead. I ran up to Miss Inez's room and
                        called her. My master was not at home, or I would have called him instead. I
                        think she must have been dead some minutes. She was growing cold when I
                        found her."</p>
                     <p>"William Hooper," continued the <title>Chesholm Courier</title>,
                        communicatively, "was cross-examined as to the precise time of finding the
                        body. He said it was close upon half-past eight, the half hour struck as he
                        went up to Miss Inez's room."</p>
                     <p>James Dicksey was next called. James Dicksey, a shambling lad of eighteen,
                        took his place, his eyes rolling in abject terror, and under the evident
                        impression that he was being tried for his life. Every answer was wrung from
                        this frightened youth, as with red-hot pincers, and it was with the utmost
                        difficulty anything consistent could be extorted at all.</p>
                     <p>"About half-past six on Friday evening, Mr. Dicksey was rambling about the
                        grounds, in the direction of the laurel walk. In the open ground it was
                        still quite light, in the laurel walk it was growing dusk. As he drew near,
                        he heard voices in the laurel walk—angry voices, though not very loud—the
                        voices of a man and a woman. Peeped in and saw my lady. Yes, it was my
                        lady—yes, he was sure. Was it likely now he wouldn't know my lady? The man
                        was very tall, had a furrin-looking hat pulled over his eyes, and stood with
                        his back to him. He didn't see his face. They were quarrelling and—well yes,
                        he did listen. Heard the man call her 'Ethel,' and ask for money. She
                        wouldn't give it to him. Then he asked for jewels. She refused again, and
                        ordered him to go. She was very angry—she stamped her foot once and said:
                        'If you don't go instantly I'll call my husband. Between you and your sister
                        you will drive me mad.' When she said that, he guessed at once, who the big
                        furrin-looking man was. It was Miss Inez's brother, Mr. Juan Catheron. Had
                        heard tell of him often, and knew he had been at the house the night of my
                        lady's arrival, and that there had been a row."</p>
                     <p>Mr. Dicksey was here sharply reprimanded, informed that his suspicions and
                        hearsays were not wanted, and requested to come back to the point. He came
                        back.</p>
                     <p>"My lady wouldn't give him anything, then he got mad and said: (James
                        Dicksey had been vaguely impressed by these remarkable words at the time,
                        and had been silently revolving them ever since) 'Give me the jewels, or by
                        all the gods I'll blow the story of your marriage to me all over
                        England!'"</p>
                     <p>The breathless silence of coroner, jury, and spectators at this juncture was
                        something not to be described. In that profound silence, James Dicksey went
                        rambling on to say, that he could swear before the Queen herself to those
                        words, that he had been thinking them over ever since he had heard them, and
                        that he couldn't make top or tail of them.</p>
                     <p>THE CORONER (interrupting)—"What further did you overhear? Be careful,
                        remember you are on oath."</p>
                     <p>JAMES DICKSEY.—"I heard what my lady said. She was in an awful passion, and
                        spoke loud. She said, 'You will not, you dare not, you're a coward; Sir
                        Victor has you in his power, and if you say one word you'll be silenced in
                        Chesholm jail.' Then she stamped her foot again, and said, 'Leave me, Juan
                        Catheron; I am not afraid of you.' Yes, he was sure of the name; she called
                        him Juan Catheron, and looked as if she could eat him alive. He had heard no
                        more; he was afraid of being caught, and had stolen quietly away. Had said
                        nothing at all about it to any one, was afraid it might reach my lady's
                        ears, and that he would lose his place for eavesdropping. At ten o'clock
                        that night was told of the murder, and was took all of a tremble. Had told
                        Superintendent Ferrick something of this next day, but this was all—yes so
                        help him, all he had heard, and just as he had heard it."</p>
                     <p>James Dicksey was rigidly cross-examined, and clung to his testimony with a
                        dogged tenacity nothing could alter or shake. He could swear positively to
                        the name she had uttered, to the words both had spoken, if he were dying. A
                        profound sensation ran through the room as James Dicksey sat down—a thrill
                        of unutterable apprehension and fear.</p>
                     <p>The examination of these three witnesses had occupied the whole of the
                        afternoon. The court adjourned until next morning at ten o'clock.</p>

                     <p>On Tuesday morning, despite the inclemency of the weather (said the
                           <title>Chesholm Courier</title> to its readers) the parlor of the
                        "Mitre," the halls, the stairways, and even the inn yard were filled at the
                        hour of nine. The excitement was intense—you might have heard a pin drop in
                        the silence, when the examination of witnesses was resumed. William Hooper
                        was again called to take the stand.</p>
                     <p>THE CORONER.—"You remember, I suppose, the evening on which Sir Victor
                        brought Lady Catheron home?"</p>
                     <p>WITNESS.—"I do."</p>
                     <p>CORONER.—"You had a visitor on that night. You admitted him, did you not,
                        Mr. Hooper? Who was that visitor?"</p>
                     <p>"It was Mr. Juan Catheron."</p>
                     <p>"Was Mr. Juan Catheron in the habit of visiting Catheron Royals?"</p>
                     <p>"He was not."</p>
                     <p>"Can you recollect, how long a period had elapsed since his previous
                        visit?"</p>
                     <p>"Mr. Catheron had not been at the Royals for over four years. He was
                        wild—there was ill-feeling between him and my master."</p>
                     <p>"Between him and his sister also?"</p>
                     <p>"I don't know. I—believe so." Here the witness looked piteously at the jury.
                        "I had rather not answer these questions, gentlemen, if you please. I'm an
                        old servant of the family—whatever family secrets may have come under my
                        knowledge, I have no right to reveal."</p>
                     <p>THE CORONER (blandly).—"Only a few more, Mr. Hooper. We require to know on
                        what footing Mr. Juan Catheron stood with his family. Did he ever come to
                        Catheron Royals to visit his sister?"</p>
                     <p>"He did not."</p>
                     <p>"Had he ever been forbidden the house?"</p>
                     <p>"I—believe so."</p>
                     <p>"On the evening of Sir Victor and Lady Catheron's arrival, his visit was
                        entirely unexpected then?"</p>
                     <p>"I don't know."</p>
                     <p>"You admitted him?"</p>
                     <p>"I did."</p>
                     <p>"What did he say to you?"</p>
                     <p>"I don't remember. Some rattling nonsense—nothing more. He was always
                        lightheaded. He ran upstairs and into the dining-room before I could prevent
                        it."</p>
                     <p>"How long did he remain?"</p>
                     <p>"About twenty minutes—not longer, I am certain. Then he came running back
                        and I let him out."</p>
                     <p>"Had there been a quarrel?"</p>
                     <p>"I don't know," doggedly; "I wasn't there. Mr. Juan came down laughing, I
                        know <emph>that</emph>. I know nothing more about it. I have never seen him
                        since."</p>

                  <p>JANE Pool was called. A suppressed murmur of deepest interest ran through the
                     room at the name of this witness. It was understood her evidence would have the
                     deepest bearing on the case. Mrs. Pool took the stand. "A decent, intelligent
                     young woman," said the <title>Chesholm Courier</title>, "who gave her evidence
                     in a clear, straightforward way that carried conviction to every hearer." "I am
                     Jane Pool. I am nurse to Sir Victor Catheron's infant son. Early in August I
                     entered the service of the deceased Lady Catheron in London; the first week of
                     September I accompanied them down here. On the evening of the murder, about
                     half-past six o'clock, or perhaps a quarter of seven, while I was busy in the
                     day nursery over my duties, my lady came in, as she often did, though not at
                     that hour. She looked pale and flurried, and bent over baby, who lay asleep,
                     without speaking. Sir Victor came in while she was still there, and without
                     taking any notice of me, told her he had received a note from Lady Helena
                     Powyss saying Squire Powyss had had a stroke, and that he must go at once to
                     Powyss Place. He said he thought he would be absent all night, that he would
                     return as soon as he could, and that she was to take care of herself. He kissed
                     her good-by and left the room. My lady went to the window and<pb n="84-85"
                        xml:id="VAC6448-00000042"/> waved her hand to him, and watched him out of
                     sight. About ten minutes after, while she still stood there, the door opened
                     and Miss Inez came in and asked for Sir Victor; she said she wanted him. Then
                     she stopped over and looked at the baby, calling him the heir of Catheron
                     Royals. Then she laughed in her soft way, and said: "I wonder if he
                        <emph>is</emph> the heir of Catheron Royals? I have been reading the Scotch
                     marriage law, and after what you and my brother said the other night—" If she
                     said any more I didn't catch it—my lady turned round in such a flame of anger
                     as I never saw her in before, and says she: "You have uttered your last insult,
                     Inez Catheron—you will never utter another beneath this roof. To-morrow you
                     leave it. I am Sir Victor Catheron's wife, and the mistress of Catheron
                     Royals—this is the last night it will ever shelter you." Then she opened the
                     door. 'Go!' she said; 'when my husband returns you or I leave this forever.'
                     Neither of them took the least notice of me; I was afraid of being seen, and
                     keep as quiet as I could. I heard Miss Inez answer: 'Not all the soap-boilers'
                     daughters in England shall send me from Catheron Royals. You may go to-morrow
                     if you will, but I will never go, never!' With that she went away, and my lady
                     shut the door upon her. I did not want her to see me there, when she turned
                     round, so I slipped out of another door, and downstairs. I took my supper,
                     lingering, I dare say, half an hour; I don't think it was much more than
                     half-after seven when I returned to the nursery for baby. I found my lady
                     asleep in the arm-chair beside the open window. She had been crying—there were
                     tears on her cheeks and eyelashes as she slept. I did not disturb her. I lifted
                     baby and carried him up to the night nursery. I left him in charge of the under
                     nursemaid, and returned to the room my lady was in. The clock was striking
                     eight as I came downstairs. I was going in to awaken my lady, not liking to
                     have her sleep in the night air. My hand was on the handle, when the door
                     opened and Miss Inez came out. She looked paler than common, I thought, but she
                     spoke just as high and haughty as usual. She asked me what I wanted there; I
                     told her I wanted to waken my lady. She looked at me, as though she would like
                     to bite off my head—she was in one of her tempers, I could see. 'You had better
                     let my lady alone,' she says, 'and attend to your nursery. She's asleep still,
                     and it isn't <emph>your</emph> place to awaken her. Go.' I was in a fury; I
                     don't mind owning that, but I said nothing and I went. When Miss Inez looked
                     and spoke like that, every servant in the house knew it was as much as her
                     place was worth to disobey her. I went back and told Ellen Butters. Ellen was
                     drinking her tea; she couldn't abide Miss Inez, and the minute she finished her
                     cup she jumps up. '<emph>I'm</emph> not afraid of her,' says Ellen; 'she ain't
                        <emph>my</emph> missis; I'll go and wake my lady up.' She went; we staid
                     below. It might be five minutes after, when she comes flying back, screaming
                     fit to wake the dead, 'Murder! murder!' There was blood on one of her hands,
                     and before we could get anything more from her except 'My lady! my lady!' she
                     drops down in a faint. We left here there, and followed Hooper upstairs. There
                     was my lady lying in the arm-chair under the window, as I had seen her
                     last—stone dead. We were all so shocked and frightened, I hardly know what was
                     said or done for a while. Then somebody says—I don't know who to this minute,
                     'Where is Miss Catheron?' Nobody made answer. Says the person again: 'Where is
                     Miss Catheron?' I think it frightened Hooper. He turned round, and said he
                     would go for her. He went—we waited. He came back with her in a short while,
                     and we all looked at her. She was nearly as much like a dead woman as my lady
                     herself. I never saw such a look on any face before—her eyes seemed dazed in
                     her head, like. She hardly seemed to know what she was saying or doing, and she
                     didn't seem a bit <choice>
                        <sic>susprised</sic>
                        <corr>surprised</corr>
                     </choice>. Hooper said to her: 'Shall I send for Sir Victor?' She answered,
                     still in that stunned sort of way: 'Yes, send for Sir Victor, and the doctor,
                     and the police at once.' She was shivering like one in the chills, as she said
                     it. She said she could do nothing more, and she left us and went back to her
                     room. It was then I first missed the dagger. I can swear it was lying on the
                     table beside a book, when my lady first fell asleep; when I looked round, the
                     book was still there, the dagger gone."</p>
                  <p>The blood-stained dagger found by the policeman, was here produced and
                     identified at once by the witness.</p>
                  <p>"It is the same—I have had it in my hand a hundred<pb n="86-87"
                        xml:id="VAC6448-00000043"/> times, and seen it with her. Oh, my lady—my
                     lady—my dear lady!"</p>
                  <p>The sight of the blood-incrusted weapon, seemed totally to unnerve the witness.
                     She broke out into hysterical sobbing, which nothing could quiet. It being now
                     noon, the court adjourned till two o'clock.</p>
                  <p>Jane Pool was then again called, and resumed her important testimony, in the
                     same rapid, narrative, connected style as before.</p>
                  <p>"I felt dreadfully about the murder, and I don't mind owning I had my
                     suspicions. I said to myself: 'I'll keep an eye on Miss Inez,' and I did, as
                     well as I could. She kept her room nearly all next day. Toward night, Sir
                     Victor was took down with the fever—wild and raving like, and Miss Inez went
                     with Lady Helena to sit with him and watch. I was watching too, Sir Victor's
                     room door. I don't know why, but I seemed to expect something. About nine, or a
                     little later, as I stood at one end of the hall in the shadow, I saw the door
                     open and Miss Inez come out. She looked up and down to see if the coast was
                     clear, then put her shawl over her head, and walked very fast to the opposite
                     end, downstairs and out of the side door. I followed her. It was raining and
                     very dark, and at first I lost her among the trees. Then I heard a whistle, and
                     following it, the next thing I saw was a tall man smoking a cigar, close beside
                     her. It was too dark to see his face; I could just make out that he was very
                     tall. They were talking in whispers, and what with the drip, drip of rain and
                     the rustling of the trees, I couldn't catch at first what they were
                     saying."</p>
                  <p>"Indeed, Mrs. Pool," the coroner observed at this point, "that is to be
                     regretted. Eavesdropping seems to be your forte."</p>
                  <p>"I don't think it is any harm to listen in a good cause," Mrs. Pool retorted,
                     sullenly. "If you don't care to have me repeat my eavesdropping, I won't."</p>
                  <p>"Repeat what you heard, if it bears on this case."</p>
                  <p>"The first words I heard, were from Miss Inez. She was giving him
                     something—money, I thought, and she said: 'Now go and never come back. Your
                     coming has done evil enough surely.' I couldn't catch his answer. He took what
                     she gave him, and Miss Inez burst out, as she always does, in one of her
                     tearing passions: 'How dare you say so, you wretch! whom it is my bitterest
                     shame to call brother. <emph>But for you she would be alive and well</emph>—do
                     you think I don't know it? Go! Living or dead, I never want to look upon your
                     face again.'"</p>
                  <p>The sensation in the court [said the <title>Chesholm Courier</title>] as the
                     witness repeated these words, was something indescribable. A low, angry murmur
                     ran from lip to lip; even the coroner turned pale.</p>
                  <p>"Witness," he said, "take care! You are on oath, remember. How can you recall
                     accurately word for word what you heard?"</p>
                  <p>"Are they the sort of words likely to be forgotten?" Jane Pool retorted. "I
                     know I'm on oath; I'll take five hundred oaths to these words, if you like.
                     Those were the very words Miss Inez Catheron spoke. She called him her brother.
                     She said but for him <emph>she</emph> would be alive to-night. Then he plunged
                     into the wood and disappeared, and she went back to the house. I hav'nt spoken
                     of this to any one since. I wrote the words down when I came in. Here is the
                     writing."</p>
                  <p>She handed the coroner a slip of paper, on which what she had repeated was
                     written.</p>
                  <p>"I knew I would have to swear to it, so I wrote it down to make sure. But my
                     memory is good; I wouldn't have forgotten."</p>
                  <p>The witness was rigidly cross-examined, but nothing could shake her
                     testimony.</p>
                  <p>"The window," she said, "of the room where the murder was committed, opened on
                     a lawn and flower-garden—any one could have entered by it. The knife lay on the
                     table close by."</p>
                  <p>Dr. Dane was next called and gave his medical testimony. The dagger shown,
                     would inflict the wound that caused Lady Catheron's death. In his opinion, but
                     one blow had been struck and had penetrated the heart. Death must have been
                     instantaneous. A strong, sure hand must have struck the blow.</p>
                  <p>The policeman who had found the dagger was called, and testified as to its
                     discovery among the brake, on the evening succeeding the murder.</p>
                  <pb n="88-89" xml:id="VAC6448-00000044"/>
                  <p>Miss Catheron was the next and last witness summoned. At the sound of her name
                     a low, ominous hiss was heard—sternly repressed at once by the coroner.</p>
                  <p>"Miss Catheron came in," quoth the <title>Courier</title>, "as pale as marble
                     and looking as emotionless. Her large dark eyes glanced over the crowded room,
                     and dead silence fell. The young lady gave her evidence clearly and
                     concisely—perfectly calm in tone and manner.</p>
                  <p>"On the Friday evening in question, the deceased Lady Catheron and myself had a
                     misunderstanding. It was my fault. I made a remark that wounded her, and she
                     retorted by saying I should leave Catheron Royals on the morrow. I answered
                     equally angrily, that I would not, and left the room. When I was alone I began
                     to regret what I had so hastily said. I thought the matter over for a time, and
                     finally resolved to return and apologize. I went back to the nursery, and found
                     Lady Catheron fast asleep. I would not disturb her, and immediately left the
                     room. On the threshold, I encountered Nurse Pool. I had always disliked the
                     woman, and spoke sharply to her, ordering her away. Half an hour after, as I
                     sat in my room alone, Hooper, the butler, came up, and told me my lady was
                     murdered. I was naturally shocked and horrified. I went down with him, and saw
                     her. I hardly knew what to do; I felt stunned and bewildered by the suddenness
                     of so terrible a catastrophe. I told the butler to send for Sir Victor, for the
                     family physician, and the police. I knew not what else to do. I could not
                     remain in the room, because the sight of blood always turns me faint and sick.
                     I retired to my own apartment and remained there until the arrival of Lady
                     Helena Powyss."</p>
                  <p>There was one fact, the <title>Chesholm Courier</title> did not chronicle,
                     concerning Miss Catheron's evidence—the formal, constrained manner in which it
                     was given, like one who repeats a well-learned lesson by rote.</p>
                  <p>As she concluded, the coroner ventured to put a few respectful questions.</p>
                  <p>"On the night succeeding the murder, Miss Catheron, you met after dusk a man in
                     the grounds. Do you object to telling us who that man was?"</p>
                  <p>"I do," Miss Catheron replied, haughtily. "I most decidedly object. I have told
                     all I have to tell concerning this murder. About my private affairs I will
                     answer no impertinent questions, either now or at any future time."</p>
                  <p>Miss Catheron was then allowed to retire. The jury held a consultation, and it
                     was proposed to adjourn the inquest for a few days, until Juan Catheron should
                     be discovered.</p>
                  <p>In one of the rooms of the "Mitre," Miss Catheron stood with Lady Helena, Sir
                     Roger Kendrick, and a few other sympathizing and indignant friends. There was
                     but little said—but little to say. All felt that a dark, terrible cloud was
                     gathering over the girl's head. It broke sooner than they looked for.</p>
                  <p>As they lingered there for a few moments, awaiting the issue of the inquest, a
                     constable entered with a warrant, approached and touched Miss Catheron lightly
                     on the shoulder.</p>
                  <p>Lady Helena uttered a gasping cry; Sir Roger strode forward; the young lady
                     slightly recoiled. The constable took off his hat and spoke:</p>
                  <p>"Very sorry, Miss, but it's my painful duty. I have a warrant here from Squire
                     Smiley, Justice of the Peace, to arrest you on suspicion of wilful murder."</p>

                  <head type="sub">"RING OUT YOUR BELLS! LET MOURNING SHOWS BE SPREAD!"</head>
                  <p>THREE days after, a long and stately procession passed slowly through the great
                     gates, under the lofty Norman archway, bearing to the Catheron vaults the body
                     of Ethel, last lady Catheron.</p>
                  <p>A long and sad ceremonial! Why, it seemed only yesterday that that mournful,
                     passing bell had rung out the welcoming<pb n="90-91" xml:id="VAC6448-00000045"
                     /> coming peal; but yesterday since they had lit the bon-fires, and tossed
                     their hats in the air, and cheered with all their hearts and souls, the gallant
                     husband and lovely wife. For a "squire of high degree" to marry beneath him, is
                     something that goes home, warm and true, to every humble heart. Sir Victor's
                     tenantry had never been half so proud of him, as when he had brought among them
                     his low-born wife. It seemed but yesterday that all the parish had seen her,
                     walking up this very aisle, in pale, flowing silks, and with the sweetest face
                     the sun ever shone on, leaning on her happy young husband's arm; and now they
                     carried her dead—foully murdered—to the open Catheron vault, and laid her to
                     sleep forever beside the high-born dames of the race who slept their last sleep
                     there.</p>
                  <p>"All men are equal on the turf and under it," once said a famous sporting
                     nobleman. Ethel Dobb, the London soap-boiler's daughter, took her place to-day,
                     among the dead daughters of earls and marquises, their equal at last, by right
                     divine of the great leveller, Death.</p>
                  <p>A great and solemn hush pervaded all ranks, sexes, and classes. Struck down in
                     her sleep, without a moment's warning, in her own home—a deep murmur, that was
                     like the murmur of an angry sea, ran through them as they collected
                     together.</p>
                  <p>
                     <emph>Who</emph> had done this deed?—the girl confined in Chesholm jail, or her
                     scoundrel brother? They remembered him well—like Ishmael of old, his hand
                     against every man, and every man's hand against him, the head and instigator of
                     every poaching fray, or hen-roost robbery, every fight and evil deed done in
                     Chesholm. Both brother and sister hated her—Inez Catheron that she had taken
                     her lover from her—Juan Catheron that he had lost her himself. After Sir Victor
                     he was heir-at-law. Failing the life of the infant son, he might one day write
                     himself Sir Juan.</p>
                  <p>It was a lucky thing, croaked the Chesholm gossips, that Nurse Pool had removed
                     the baby, else the dagger that stabbed the mother would have found its way to
                     the heart of the child. Curse the black-hearted murderer of sleeping women and
                     from the throng in the churchyard there rose up a groan to Heaven, and a
                     hundred angry hearts pledged themselves to avenge it if the law would not.</p>
                  <p>"The coroner would have let the young lady escape," said one. "See how he
                     snubbed Mrs. Pool, and how easily he let her betters off. If Justice Smiley
                     hadn't got out his warrant, she'd have been off to the continent and clear
                     away, long before this."</p>
                  <p>"Why don't they find Juan Catheron?" said another. "They <emph>say</emph>
                     they're looking for him—why don't they find him then? Murderers don't escape so
                     easily nowadays—the law finds 'em if it wants to find 'em. It's seven days
                     since the murder was done, and no tale or tidings of him yet."</p>
                  <p>"And when he is found neither he nor his sister shall escape. If the law lets
                     them clear, <emph>we</emph> won't. The time when rank could shield crime is
                     over, thank Heaven. Let them hang as high as Haman—they deserve it. I'll be the
                     first to pull the rope."</p>
                  <p>Day-by-day, the feeling had grown stronger and bitterer, against brother and
                     sister. The Englishman's proverbial love of "fair play," seemed for once
                     forgotten. The merciful reasoning of the law, that takes every man to be
                     innocent until he is proven guilty, was too lenient to be listened to. The
                     brother had murdered her—the sister had aided and abetted. Let them both
                     hang—that was the <foreign xml:lang="LAT">vox populi</foreign> of
                     Chesholm—hanging was too good for them.</p>
                  <p>"How did she take her arrest—she was always as proud as Lucifer and as haughty
                     as a duke's daughter?" asked the curious townfolk.</p>
                  <p>She had taken it very quietly as though she had expected it. When Lady Helena
                     and Sir Roger had cried out in horror at her arrest, she had stood firm. A
                     slight, sad smile had even crossed her lips.</p>
                  <p>"Dear Aunt Helena—dear Sir Roger," she had said, "there's nothing to be
                     surprised at. Don't interfere with this man; he is only doing his duty. I knew
                     this would come. I have expected it from the first. It will be unpleasant for
                     the time—of the result I have no fear. In these days, when so many guilty
                     escape, it is not likely the innocent will be punished. Let me go with this man
                     quietly, Aunt Helena; I," a flush of proud pain passed over her face, "I don't
                     want the servants—I don't want the rabble to see me."</p>
                  <pb n="92-93" xml:id="VAC6448-00000046"/>
                  <p>She held out her hand to her aunt, and her aunt's old friend.</p>
                  <p>"Good-by, Aunt Helena," she said wistfully. "Good-by, Sir Roger. Nothing that
                     they can bring against me will shake your faith in me, I know. You will both
                     come to see me often, I hope, and bring me news of poor Victor. Should—I mean
                        <emph>when</emph> he recovers—don't tell him of this—don't, I beg. It can do
                     no good—it may do him harm. Good-by once more—give my love to Uncle Godfrey.
                     Aunt Helena, don't distress yourself so; I cannot bear it."</p>
                  <p>"Do you think I will let you go alone? No, I will go with you to the prison, if
                     these besotted wretches persist in sending you there. But oh, there
                        <emph>must</emph> be some mistake—it is too atrocious. Sir Roger, can't you
                     do something? Great Heaven! the idea of Inez Catheron being lodged in Chesholm
                     jail like a common felon!"</p>
                  <p>"Sir Roger can do nothing," Inez answered; "the law must take its course. Let
                     us end this painful scene—let us go at once." She shuddered in spite of
                     herself. "The sooner it is over the better."</p>
                  <p>She shook hands again with Sir Roger. A cab was at the door—the old baronet
                     handed the ladies in, and stood bareheaded, until they were driven out of
                     sight. They reached the square, gloomy, black building called Chesholin jail,
                     standing in the center of a gloomy, paved quadrangle. Miss Catheron was shown
                     to a room. The jailer had once been a servant in the Powyss family, and he
                     pledged himself now to make Miss Inez as comfortable as was admissible under
                     the circumstances.</p>
                  <p>Once in the dreary room, with the heavy door closed and locked, Lady Helena
                     suddenly fell down on the stone floor before her niece and held up her
                     hands.</p>
                  <p>"Inez," she said, "in Heaven's name hear me! You are shielding some one—that
                     guilty man—you saw him do this deed. Speak out! Save yourself—let the guilty
                     suffer. What is he, that you should perish for his sake? He was always evil and
                     guilty—forget his blood flows in your veins—speak out and save yourself. Let
                     him who is guilty suffer for his own crime!"</p>
                  <p>The soft September twilight was filling the room. One pale flash of sunset came
                     slanting through the grated window and fell on Inez Catheron's face. She stood
                     in the middle of the floor, her clasped hands hanging loosely before her, an
                     indescribable expression on her face.</p>
                  <p>"Poor Juan," she said, wearily; "don't be too hard on him, Aunt Helena. We have
                     none of us ever been too gentle with him in his wrong doing, and he wasn't
                     really bad at heart <emph>then</emph>. If any letter should come from him to
                     you, for me, say nothing about it—bring it here. I don't think he will be
                     taken; he can double like a hare, and he is used to being hunted. I hope he is
                     far away at sea before this. For the rest, I have nothing to say—nothing. I can
                     live disgraced and die a felon if need be, but not ten thousand disgraceful
                     deaths can make me speak one word more than I choose to utter."</p>
                  <p>Lady Helena's stifled sobbing filled the room. "Oh, my child! my child!" she
                     cried; "what madness is this, and for one so unworthy!"</p>
                  <p>"But there will be no such tragical ending. I will be tried at the Assizes and
                     acquitted. They <emph>can't</emph> bring me in guilty. Jane Poole's
                     circumstancial evidence may sound very conclusive in the ears of Mr. Justice
                     Smiley, but it won't bring conviction with a grand jury. You see it wasn't
                     sufficient even for the coroner. The imprisonment here will be the worst, but
                     you will lighten that. Then when it is all over, I will leave England and go
                     back to Spain, to my mother's people. They will receive me gladly, I know. It
                     is growing dark, Aunt Helena—pray don't linger here longer."</p>
                  <p>Lady Helena arose, her face set in a look of quiet, stubborn resolve.</p>
                  <p>"Take good care of poor Victor, and watch the baby well. He is the last of the
                     Catherons now, you know. Don't let any one approach Victor but Mrs. Marsh, and
                     warn her not to speak of my arrest—the shock might kill him. I wish—I wish I
                     had treated her more kindly in the past. I feel as though I could never forgive
                     myself now."</p>
                  <p>"You had better not talk so much, Inez," her aunt said, almost coldly. "You may
                     be overheard. I don't pretend to understand you. You know best, whether he, for
                     whom you are making this sacrifice, deserves it or not. Goodnight, my poor
                     child—I will see you early to-morrow."</p>
                  <pb n="94-95" xml:id="VAC6448-00000047"/>
                  <p>Lady Helena, her lips set in that rigid line of resolve, her tears dried, rode
                     back to Catheron Royals. The darkness had fallen by this time—fallen with
                     black, fast-drifting clouds, and chill whistling winds. Two or three lights,
                     here and there, gleamed along the lofty façade of the old mansion, now a house
                     of mourning indeed. Beneath its roof a foul, dark murder had been done—beneath
                     its roof its master lay ill unto death. And for the guilty wretch who had
                     wrought this ruin, Inez Catheron was to suffer imprisonment, suspicion, and
                     life-long disgrace. The curse that the towns-people invoked on Juan Catheron,
                     Lady Helena had it in her heart to echo.</p>
                  <p>Her first act was to dismiss Jane Pool, the nurse.</p>
                  <p>"We keep servants, not spies and informers, at Catheron Royals," she said,
                     imperiously. "Go to Mrs. Marsh—what is due you she will pay. You leave Catheron
                     Royals without a character, and at once."</p>
                  <p>"I'm not afraid, my lady," Jane Pool retorted, with a toss of her head. "People
                     will know why I'm turned away, and I'll get plenty of places. I knew I would
                     lose my situation for telling the truth, but I'm not the first that has
                     suffered in a good cause."</p>
                  <p>Lady Helena had swept away, disdaining all reply. She ascended to Sir Victor's
                     room—the night-lamp burned low, mournful shadows filled it. A trusty nurse sat
                     patiently by the bedside.</p>
                  <p>"How is he now?" asked his aunt, bending above him.</p>
                  <p>"Much the same, your ladyship—in a sort of stupor all the time, tossing about,
                     and muttering ceaselessly. I can't make out anything he says, except the name
                     Ethel. He repeats that over and over in a way that breaks my heart to
                     hear."</p>
                  <p>The name seemed to catch the dulled ear of the delirious man.</p>
                  <p>"Ethel," he said, wearily. "Yes—yes I must go and fetch Ethel home. I wish Inez
                     would go away—her black eyes make one afraid—they follow me everywhere.
                     Ethel—Ethel—Ethel!" He murmured the name dreamily, tenderly. Suddenly he half
                     started up in bed and looked about him wildly. "What brings Juan Catheron's
                     picture here? Ethel! come away from him. How dare you meet him here alone?" He
                     grasped Lady Helena's wrist and looked at her with haggard, bloodshot eyes. "He
                     was your lover once—how dare he come here? Oh, Ethel you won't leave me for
                     him! I love you—I can't live without you—<emph>don't</emph> go. Oh, my Ethel!
                     my Ethel! my Ethel!"</p>
                  <p>He fell back upon the bed with a sort of sobbing cry that brought the tears
                     streaming from the eyes of the tender-hearted nurse.</p>
                  <p>"He goes on like that continual, my lady," she said, "and its awful wearing.
                     Always 'Ethel.' Ah, it's a dreadful thing?"</p>
                  <p>"Hooper will watch with you to-night, Martha," Lady Helena said. "Mrs. Marsh
                     will relieve you to-morrow. No stranger shall come near him. I will take a look
                     at baby before going home. I shall return here early to-morrow, and I need not
                     tell you to be very watchful!—I know you will."</p>
                  <p>"You needn't indeed, my lady," the woman answered, mournfully. "I was his
                     mother's own maid, and I've nursed him in my arms, a little white-haired baby,
                     many a time. I will be watchful, my lady."</p>
                  <p>Lady Helena left her and ascended to the night nursery. She had to pass the
                     room where the tragedy had been enacted. She shivered as she went by. She found
                     the little heir of Catheron Royals asleep in his crib, guarded by the
                     under-nurse—head-nurse now, <emph>vice</emph> Mrs. Pool cashiered.</p>
                  <p>"Take good care of him, nurse," was Lady Helena's last charge, as she stooped
                     and kissed him, tears in her eyes; "poor little motherless lamb."</p>
                  <p>"I'll guard him with my life, my lady," the girl answered, sturdily. "No harm
                     shall come to <emph>him</emph>."</p>
                  <p>Lady Helena returned to Powyss Place and her convalescent husband, her heart
                     lying like a stone in her breast.</p>
                  <p>"If I hadn't sent for Victor that night—if I had left him at home to protect
                     his wife, this might never have happened," she thought, remorsefully;
                        "<emph>he</emph> would never have left her alone and unprotected, to sleep
                     beside an open window in the chill night air."</p>
                  <p>Amid her multiplicity of occupations, amid her own great distress, she had
                     found time to write to Mr. Dobb and his<pb n="96-97" xml:id="VAC6448-00000048"
                     /> wife a touching, womanly letter. They had come down to see their dead
                     daughter and departed again. She had been taken out of their life—raised far
                     above them, and even in death they would not claim her.</p>
                  <p>And now that the funeral was over, Inez in prison, the tumult and excitement at
                     an end, who shall describe the awful quiet that fell upon the old house. A
                     ghastly stillness reigned—servants spoke in whispers, and stole from room to
                     room—the red shadow of Murder rested in their midst. And upstairs, in that dusk
                     chamber, while the nights fell, Sir Victor lay hovering between life and
                     death.</p>

                  <head>CHAPTER XII.</head>
                  <head type="sub">THE FIRST ENDING OF THE TRAGEDY.</head>
                  <p>EIGHT days after the burial of Lady Catheron, several events, occurred that
                     wrought the seething excitement of Chesholm to boiling-over point—events talked
                     of for many an after year, by cottage fireside and manor hearth.</p>
                  <p>The first of these, was Miss Catheron's examination before the police
                     magistrate, and her committal to jail, until the assizes. The justice before
                     whom the young lady appeared was the same who had already issued his warrant
                     for her arrest—a man likely to show her little favor on account of her youth,
                     her beauty, or her rank. Indeed the latter made him doubly bitter; he was a
                     virulent hater of the "bloated aristocracy." Now that he had one of them in his
                     power, he was determined to let the world at large, and Chesholm in small see
                     that neither station nor wealth could be shields for crime.</p>
                  <p>She took her place in the prisoner's dock, pale, proud, disdainful. She glanced
                     over the dark sea of threatening faces that thronged the court-room, with
                     calmly haughty eyes—outwardly unmoved. Her few friends were there—few indeed,
                     for nearly all believed that if hers was not the hand that had struck the blow,
                     she had been at least her brother's abettor. Many were brought forward who
                     could swear how she had hated my lady; how she had taken every opportunity to
                     insult and annoy her; how again and again my lady had been found crying fit to
                     break her heart after the lash of Miss Inez's stinging tongue. She had loved
                     Sir Victor—she was furiously jealous of his wife—she had fiery Spanish blood in
                     her veins, and a passionate temper that stopped at nothing. Jane Pool was
                     there, more bitter than ever—more deadly in her evidence. Hooper was there, and
                     his reluctantly extorted testimony told dead against her. The examination
                     lasted two days. Inez Catheron was re-committed to prison to stand her trial
                     for murder at the next assizes.</p>
                  <p>The second fact worthy of note was, that despite the efforts of the Chesholm
                     police, in spite of the London detectives, no tale or tidings of Juan Catheron
                     were to be found. The earth might have opened and swallowed him, so completely
                     had he disappeared.</p>
                  <p>The third fact was, that Sir Victor Catheron had reached the crisis of his
                     disease and passed it safely. The fever was slowly but steadily abating. Sir
                     Victor was not to die, but to "take up the burden of life again"—a dreary
                     burden, with the wife he had loved so fondly, sleeping in the vaults of
                     Chesholm Church.</p>
                  <p>The fourth fact was, that the infant heir of the Catherons had been removed
                     from Catheron Royals to Powyss Place, to be brought up under the watchful eye
                     and care of his grandaunt, Lady Helena.</p>
                  <p>On the evening of the day that saw Inez Catheron committed for trial, the post
                     brought Lady Helena a letter. The handwriting, evidently disguised, was
                     unfamiliar, and yet something about it set her heart throbbing. She tore it
                     open; it contained an inclosure. There were but three lines for herself: <q>
                        <floatingText>
                           <body>

                                 <p>"DEAR LADY H.: If you will permit a reprobate to be on such
                                    familiar terms with your highly respectable name, I address I—,
                                    under cover to you, as per order.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>The inclosure was sealed. Lady Helena destroyed her own, and next day drove to
                     the prison with the other. She found her niece sitting comfortably enough in an
                        arm-chair,<pb n="98-99" xml:id="VAC6448-00000049"/> reading, and except that
                     she had grown thinner and paler, looking little the worse. All that it was
                     possible to do, to make her comfortable, had been done. Without a word the
                     elder woman presented the letter—without a word the younger took it. She turned
                     to the window and read its brief contents.</p>
                  <p>"Thank Heaven!" her aunt heard her fervently say.</p>
                  <p>"May I see it, Inez? What does he say? Is he coming here to—"</p>
                  <p>"Coming here!" The girl's dark eyes looked at her in grave astonishment.
                     "Certainly not. He is safe away, I am thankful to say, and out of their
                     reach."</p>
                  <p>"And he leaves you here to suffer in his stead, and you thank Heaven for it!
                     Inez Catheron, you are the most egregious—. Give me that note!"</p>
                  <p>Inez smiled as she gave it. Her aunt put up her double eye-glass, and read:</p>

                                 the papers, and I'm sorry to see they've taken you on suspicion.
                                 Inez, you're a trump, by Jove! I can say no more, but mind you,
                                 only I know they can't commit you, I'd come back and confess all. I

                  <p>A flush—a deep angry flush reddened the face of Lady Helena Powyss, as she
                     finished this cool epistle. She crushed it in her hand as though it were a
                     viper.</p>
                  <p>"The coward! the dastard! And it is for the heartless writer of this insolent
                     letter that you suffer all this. Inez Catheron, I command you—speak out. Tell
                     what you know. Let the guilty wretch you call brother, suffer for his own
                     crime."</p>
                  <p>Inez looked at her, with something of the stern, haughty glance she had cast
                     upon the rabble of the court room.</p>
                  <p>"Enough, Lady Helena! You don't know what you are talking about. I have told
                     you before; all I had to say I said at the inquest. It is of no use our talking
                     about it. Come what may, I will never say one word more."</p>
                  <p>And looking at her stern, resolute face, Lady Helena knew she never would. She
                     tore the letter she held into minutest morsels, and tied them up in her
                     handkerchief.</p>
                  <p>"I'll burn them when I get home, and I never want to hear <emph>his</emph> name
                     again. For you," lowering her voice, "we must save you in spite of yourself.
                     You shall never stand your trial at the assizes."</p>
                  <p>Miss <choice>

                        <corr>Catheron</corr>
                     </choice> looked wistfully at the heavily bolted and barred window.</p>
                  <p>"I should like to be saved," she said, wearily, "at any other price than that
                     of speaking. Once I thought I would die sooner than stoop to run away—a
                     fortnight's imprisonment changes all that. Save me if you can, Aunt Helena—it
                     will kill me to face that horrible mob again."</p>
                  <p>Her voice died out in a choking sob. She was thoroughly brave, but she
                     shuddered with sick fear and loathing, from head to foot, as she recalled the
                     dark, vindictive faces, the merciless eyes that had confronted her yesterday on
                     every side.</p>
                  <p>Lady Helena kissed her quietly and turned to go.</p>
                  <p>"Keep up heart," she said; "before the week ends you shall be free."</p>
                  <p>Two days later, Lady Helena and the warden of Chesholm jail sat closeted
                     together in deep and mysterious conference. On the table between them lay a
                     crossed check for seven thousand pounds.</p>
                  <p>The jailor sat with knitted brows and troubled, anxious face. He had been for
                     years a servant in Lady Helena's family. Her influence had procured him his
                     present situation. He had a sick wife and a large family, and seven thousand
                     pounds was an immense temptation.</p>
                  <p>"You risk nothing," Lady Helena was saying, in an agitated whisper, "and you
                     gain everything. They will blame<pb n="100-101" xml:id="VAC6448-00000050"/> you
                     for nothing worse than carelessness in the discharge of your duty. You may lose
                     your situation. Very well, lose it. Here are seven thousand pounds for you. In
                     all your life, grubbing here, you would never accumulate half or quarter that
                     sum. You can remove to London; trust to my influence to procure you a better
                     situation there than this. And oh, think of <emph>her</emph>—young,
                     guiltless—think what her life has been, think what it is now destined to be.
                     She is innocent—I swear it. You have daughters of your own, about her age—think
                     of them and yield!"</p>
                  <p>He stretched forth his hand and answered, resolutely:</p>
                  <p>"Say no more, my lady. Let good or ill betide—I'll do it."</p>
                  <p>The issue of the <title>Chesholm Courier</title> four days later contained a
                     paragraph that created the profoundest excitement from end to end of the town.
                     We quote it:</p>
                  <p>"ESCAPE OF MISS INEZ CATHERON FROM CHESHOLM JAIL—NO TRACE OF HER TO BE
                     FOUND—SUSPECTED FOUL PLAY—THE JAILER THREATENED BY THE MOB.</p>
                  <p>"Early on the morning of Tuesday the under jailer, going to Miss Catheron's
                     cell with her breakfast, found, to his astonishment and dismay, that it was
                     empty and his prisoner flown.</p>
                  <p>"A moment's investigation showed him the bars of the window cleanly filed
                     through and removed. A rope ladder and a friend without, it is quite evident,
                     did the rest. The man instantly gave the alarm and aid came. The head jailer
                     appears to be as much at a loss as his underling, but he is suspected. He lived
                     in his youth in the Powyss family, and was suspected of a strong attachment to
                     the prisoner. He says he visited Miss Catheron last night as usual when on his
                     rounds, and saw nothing wrong or suspicious then, either about the filed bars
                     or the young lady. It was a very dark night, and no doubt her escape was easily
                     enough effected. If any proof of the prisoner's guilt were needed, her flight
                     from justice surely renders it. Miss Catheron's friends have been permitted
                     from the first to visit her at their pleasure and bring her what they chose—the
                     result is to be seen to-day. The police, both of our town and the metropolis,
                     are diligently at work. It is hoped their labors will be more productive of
                     success in the case of the sister than they have been in that of the
                     brother.</p>
                  <p>"The head jailer, it is said, will be dismissed from his post. No doubt,
                     pecuniarily, this is a matter of indifference to him <emph>now</emph>. He made
                     his appearance once in the street this morning, and came near being mobbed. Let
                     this escape be rigidly investigated, and let all implicated be punished."</p>
                  <p>The escape created even more intense and angry excitement than the murder. The
                     rabble were furious. It is not every day that a young lady of the upper ten
                     thousand comes before the lower ten million in the popular character of a
                     murderess. They had been lately favored with such rich and sensational
                     disclosures in high life, love, jealousy, quarrels, assassination. Their victim
                     was safely in their hands; they would try her, condemn her, hang her, and teach
                     the aristocracy, law was a game two could play at. And lo! in the hour of their
                     triumph, she slips from between their hands, and, like her guilty brother and
                     abettor, makes good her escape.</p>
                  <p>The town of Chesholm was furious. If the jailer had shown his face he stood in
                     danger of being torn to pieces. They understood thoroughly how it was—that he
                     had been bribed. In the dead of night, the man and his family shook the dust of
                     Chesholm off their feet, and went to hide themselves in the busy world of
                     London.</p>
                  <p>Three weeks passed. October, with its mellow days and frosty nights, was gone.
                     And still no trace of the fugitive. All the skill of the officials of the town
                     and country had been baffled by the cunning of a woman. Inez Catheron might
                     have flown with the dead summer's swallows for all the trace she had left
                     behind.</p>
                  <p>The first week of November brought still another revelation. Sir Victor
                     Catheron had left the Royals; Lady Helena, the squire, the baby, the nurse,
                     Powyss Place. They were all going to the south of France for the young
                     baronet's spirits and health. Catheron Royals, in charge of Mrs. Marsh and Mr.
                     Hooper, and two servants, on board wages, was left to silence and gloom, rats
                     and evil repute,<pb n="102-103" xml:id="VAC6448-00000051"/> autumnal rain and
                     wind. The room of the tragedy was shut up, a doomed room, "under the ban"
                     forever.</p>
                  <p>And so for the present the "tragedy of Catheron Royals" had ended. Brother and
                     sister had fled in their guilt, alike from justice and vengeance. Ethel, Lady
                     Catheron, lay with folded hands and sealed lips in the grim old vaults, and a
                     parchment and a monument in Chesholm Church recorded her name and age—no more.
                     So for the present it had ended.</p>

                  <p>IT had been a week of ceaseless rain—the whole country side was sodden. The
                     month was March, and after an unusually severe January and February, a "soft
                     spell" had come, the rain had poured or dripped incessantly from a
                     smoke-colored sky, the state of the earth was only to be described by that one
                     uncomfortable word "slush." Spring was at hand after a horribly bitter winter—a
                     spring that was all wet and slop, miserable easterly winds, and bleak,
                     drizzling rain.</p>
                  <p>Perhaps if you searched the whole coast line between Maine and Florida, you
                     could not light upon a drearier, dirtier, duller little town than the town of
                     Sandypoint, Massachusetts. It was a straggling place, more village than town,
                     consisting mainly of one long street, filled with frame houses of staring
                     white, picked out with red doors and very green shutters. Half a dozen
                     pretentious "stores," a school-house, one or two churches, a town hall, and
                     three hotels, comprised the public buildings. Behind Sandypoint stretched out
                     the "forest primeval;" before Sandypoint spread away its one beauty, the
                     bright, broad sea.</p>
                  <p>To-day it looked neither bright nor broad, but all blurred in gray wet mist;
                     the surf cannonaded the shore with its dull thunder; the woodland in the
                     background was a very black forest in the dreariness, and the roads—who shall
                     paint the state of the Sandypoint roads? Worst of all, the weather showed no
                     sign of relenting, no symptoms of clearing<pb n="104-105"
                        xml:id="VAC6448-00000052"/> ing up. The new clock recently affixed to the
                     Sandypoint Town Hall, was striking the matutinal hour of ten. The population of
                     Sandypoint might all have been dead and buried, for any sign of life
                     Independence street showed. Doors and windows were all closed in a melancholy
                     way—a stray, draggled dog the only living creature to be seen.</p>
                  <p>Or stay—no! there was a girl besides the dog, almost as draggled as her
                     four-footed companion. A girl of eighteen, perhaps, who walked along through
                     rain and discomfort, without so much as an umbrella to protect her. She had
                     come out of one of the ugliest of the ugly buildings nearest the sea, and
                     walked along in a slipshod sort of way, never turning to the right or left to
                     avoid an unusually deep puddle. She plunged right on through it all—a dark,
                     sullen-looking girl in a shabby black dress, a red and black tartan shawl, an
                     old black felt hat with dingy red flowers, long past being spoilt by rain or
                     wind.</p>
                  <p>And yet she was a pretty girl too—a <emph>very</emph> pretty girl. Take the
                     Venus Celestis, plump her down in a muddy road in a rainstorm, dress her in a
                     draggled black alpaca, a faded shawl, and shocking bad hat, and what can you
                     say for your goddess but that she isn't a bad-looking young woman? Miss Edith
                     Darrell labors under all these disadvantages at present. More—she looks sulky
                     and sour; it is evident her personal appearance has troubled her very little
                     this dismal March morning. And yet as you look at her, at those big black
                     somber eyes, at those almost classically regular features, at all that untidy
                     abundance of blackish-brown hair, you think involuntarily "what a pretty girl
                     that might be if she only combed her hair, put on a clean dress, and wasn't in
                     bad temper!"</p>
                  <p>She is tall, she is slender—there is a supple grace about her even now—she has
                     shapely feet and hands. She is a brunette of the most pronounced type, with a
                     skin like creamy velvet, just touched on either ripe cheek with a peach-like
                     glow, and with lips like cherries. You <emph>know</emph> without seeing her
                     laugh, that she has very white teeth. She is in no way inclined to show her
                     white teeth laughingly this morning. She goes steadily along to her
                     destination—one of the "stores" where groceries and provisions are sold. The
                     storekeeper smilingly accosts her with a brisk "Good-morning<choice>
                        <sic>nig</sic>
                        <corr>ing</corr>
                     </choice>, Miss Darrell! Who'd have thought of seeing you out this nasty
                     whether? Can I do anything for you to-day?"</p>
                  <p>"If you couldn't do anything for me, Mr. Webster," answers Miss Darrell, in no
                     very conciliatory tone, "it isn't likely you'd see me in your shop this
                     morning. Give me one pound of tea, one pound of coffee, three pounds of brown
                     sugar, and a quarter of starch. Put them in this basket, and I'll call for them
                     when I'm going home."</p>
                  <p>She goes out again into the rain, and makes her way to an emporium where dry
                     goods, boots and shoes, milinery, and crockery are for sale. A sandy-haired
                     young man, with a sandy mustache and a tendency to blushes, springs forward at
                     sight of her, as though galvanized, reddening to the florid roots of his
                     hair.</p>
                  <p>"Miss Darrell!" he cries, in a sort of rapture. "Who'd a thought it? So early
                     in the morning, and without an umbrella! How's your pa and ma, and all the
                     children?"</p>
                  <p>"My pa and ma, and all the children are well of course," the young lady
                     answers, impatiently, as though it were out of the nature of things for
                     anything to ail her family. "Mr. Doolittle, I want six yards of crash for
                     kitchen towels, three pairs of shoes for the children, and two yards and a half
                     of stone-colored ribbon for Mrs. Darrell's drab bonnet. And be quick."</p>
                  <p>The blushes and emotion of young Mr. Doolittle, it was quite evident, were
                     entirely thrown away upon Miss Darrell. "Not at home to lovers," was plainly
                     written on her moody brow and impatient lips. So Mr. Doolittle produced the
                     crash and cut off the six yards, the three pairs of shoes were picked out, and
                     the stoniest of the stone colors chosen, the parcel tied up and paid for.</p>
                  <p>"We didn't see you up to Squire Whipple's surprise party last night, Miss
                     Edith," Mr. Doolittle timidly ventured, with a strong "Down East" accent. "We
                     had a hunky supper and a rale good time."</p>
                  <p>"No, you didn't see me, Mr. Doolittle, and I don't think you're likely to in a
                     hurry, either. The deadly liveliness of Sandypoint surprise parties, and the
                     beauty of Sandypoint, and its beastly weather are about on a par—the parties,
                     if anything, the most dismal of the three."</p>
                  <p>With which the young lady went out with a cool parting<pb n="106-107"
                        xml:id="VAC6448-00000053"/> nod. There was one more errand to go—this one
                     for herself. It was to the post-office, and even the old post-master lit up
                     into a smile of welcome at sight of his visitor. It was evident, that when in
                     good temper Miss Darrell must be rather a favorite in the neighborhood.</p>
                  <p>"Letters for you? Well, yes, Miss Edie, I think there is. What's this? Miss
                     Edith S. Darrell, Sandypoint Mass. That's for you, and from New York again, I
                     see. Ah! I hope none o' them York chaps will be coming down here to carry away
                     the best-lookin' gal in town."</p>
                  <p>He handed her the letter. For a moment her dark face lit up with an eager
                     flush; as she took the letter it fell. It was superscribed in a girl's spidery
                     tracery, sealed with blue wax, and a sentimental French seal and motto.</p>
                  <p>"From Trixy," she said, under her breath; "and I felt sure there would be one
                     from—Are you <emph>sure</emph> this is all, Mr. Merriweather? I expected
                     another."</p>
                  <p>"Sure and certain, Miss Edie. Sorry to disappoint you, but that's all. Never
                     mind, my dear—he'll write by next mail."</p>
                  <p>She turned shortly away, putting the letter in her pocket. Her face relapsed
                     again, into what seemed its habitual look of gloom and discontent.</p>
                  <p>"He's like all the rest of the world," she thought, bitterly, "out of sight,
                     out of mind. I was a fool to think he would remember me long. I only wonder
                     Beatrix takes the trouble of writing to this dead-and-alive place. One thing is
                     very certain—she won't do it long."</p>
                  <p>She returned for her parcels, and set out on her wet return walk home. Mr.
                     Doolittle volunteered to escort her thither, but she made short work of
                        <emph>him</emph>. Through the rain, through the slop, wet, cold,
                     comfortless, the girl left the ugly town behind her, and came out on the lonely
                     road that led along to the sea. Five minutes more, brought her in sight of her
                     home—a forlorn house, standing bleak and bare on a cliff. One path led to
                     it—another to the sands below. At the point where she must turn either way,
                     Miss Darrell stood still and looked moodily up at the house.</p>
                  <p>"If I go there," she muttered, "she'll set me to hem the towels, or trim the
                     bonnet, or make a pudding for dinner. It's wash day, and I know what
                        <emph>that</emph> means in our house. I<emph>won't</emph> go—it's better out
                     in the rain; the towels and the drab bonnet may go <foreign xml:lang="FRA">au

                              <p>"DEAREST DITHY:—Just half-an-hour ago I came home from a
                                    <emph>splendid</emph> ball, the most splendid by far of the
                                 winter, and before one ray of all its brilliance fades from my
                                 frivolous mind, let me sit down and tell you all about it if I
                                 can.</p>
                              <p>"The ball was held at the De Rooyter house, up the avenue, in honor
                                 of their distinguished English guests, Lady Helena Powyss, of
                                 Powyss Place, Cheshire, and Sir Victor Catheron, of Catheron
                                 Royals, Cheshire. How grand the titles sound! My very pen expands
                                 as it writes those patrician names. Lady Helena. Oh, Dithy!
                                    <emph>how</emph> delicious it must be to be, 'My Lady!'</p>
                              <p>"What did I wear, you ask? Well, my dear, I wore a lovely trained
                                 green silk—gas-light green, you know, under white tulle, all looped
                                 up with trailing sprays of lily of the valley and grasses—ditto,
                                 ditto, in my hair, and just one pink, half-blown rose. A trying
                                 costume you say? Yes, I know it, but you see, the only beauty poor
                                 Trixy can claim is a tolerable pink and white complexion, and a
                                 decent head of light brown hair. So I carried it off—everyone says
                                 I really looked my very best, and—don't set this down to vanity
                                 dear—the gentlemen's eyes indorsed it. I danced all night, and here
                                 is where the rapture comes in, three times with the baronet. I
                                 can't say much for his waltzing, but he's delightful,
                                 Dithy—charming. Could a baronet be anything else? He talks with
                                 that delightful English accent, which it is impossible to imitate
                                 or describe—he is very young, about three-and-twenty, I should
                                 judge, and really (in that blonde English way) very handsome. His
                                 hair is very light—he has large, lovely, short-sighted blue eyes,
                                 and wears an eye-glass. Now, I think an eye-glass is distinguished
                                    looking<pb n="108-109" xml:id="VAC6448-00000054"/> ing in
                                 itself, and it is <foreign xml:lang="FRA">haut ton</foreign> to be
                                 short sighted. Why are they in New York do I hear you say? Lady
                                 Helena was recommended a sea voyage for her health, and her nephew
                                 accompanied her. Lady Helena is not young nor beautiful, as you
                                 might imagine, but a fair, fat, and sixty, I should say, British
                                 matron. She is the daughter of the late Marquis of St. Albans, and
                                 a widow, her husband having died some time ago. And they are
                                 immensely rich. IMMENSELY, Dithy! Capitals can't do justice to it.
                                 And of course all the young ladies last night were making a dead
                                 set at the young baronet. Oh, Dithy—child, if he should only fall
                                 in love with me—with ME, and make me Lady Catheron, I believe I
                                 should just die of pure ecstasy (is that word spelled right?) like
                                 Lord Berleigh's bride in the story. Fancy yourself reading it in

                              <p>"Dithy, think of it! It makes my brain swim, and stranger things
                                 have happened. My twentieth birthday comes next week, and ma gives
                                 a large party, and Lady H. and Sir V. are coming. I am to wear a
                                 pink silk with trimmings of real point, and pa sent home a set of
                                 pearls from Tiffany's yesterday, for which he gave $1,000. If the
                                 rose silk and pearls fail to finish him, then there is another
                                 project on the carpet. It is this, Lady H. and Sir V. go home the
                                 first week of May, and we are going with them in the same ship. I
                                 say <emph>we</emph>—pa, ma, Charley, and me. Won't it be lovely? If
                                    <emph>you</emph> were coming, you might write a book about our
                                 haps and mishaps. I think they will equal the 'Dodd Family Abroad.'
                                 Seriously, though, Edith dear, I wish you were coming with us. It's
                                 a burning shame that you should be buried alive down in that poky
                                 Sandypoint, with your cleverness, and your accomplishments, and
                                 good looks, and everything. If I marry the baronet, Dith, I shall
                                 take you with me to England, and you shall live happy forever
                                 after.</p>
                              <p>"I set out to tell you of the De Rooyter ball, and see how I run
                                 on. All New York was there—the crush was awful, the music
                                 excellent, the supper—heavenly! Sir Victor likes us Americans
                                    <emph>so</emph> much; but then who could help liking us? Oh, it

                  <p>She finished the letter—it dropped upon her lap, and her large, dark eyes
                     looked blankly out over the cold, gray, rain-beaten sea. <emph>This</emph> was
                     the life she longed for, prayed for, dreamed of, the life for which she would
                     have sold half the years of her life. The balls, the operas, the rose silks and
                     pearls, the booths and merry-go rounds of Vanity Fair. She thirsted for them as
                     the blind thirst for sight. She longed for the "halls of dazzling light," the
                     dainty dishes, the violet velvet and ermine, with a longing no words can paint.
                     She had youth and beauty; she would have suited the life as the life suited
                     her. Nature had made her for it, and Fate had planted her here in the dreariest
                     of all dreary sea-coast towns.</p>
                  <p>The rain beat upon her uncovered head, the cold wind blew in her face—she felt
                     neither. Her heart was full of tumult, revolt, bitterness untold.</p>
                  <p>Beatrix Stuart's father had been her dead mother's cousin. Why was Beatrix
                     chosen among the elect of Mammon, and Edith left to drag out "life among the
                     lowly?" She sat there while the moments wore on, the letter crushed in her lap,
                     her lips set in a line of dull pain. The glory of the world, the flesh-pots of
                     Egypt, the purple and fine linen of life, her heart craved with an exceeding
                     great longing, and all life had given her was hideous poverty, going errands in
                     shabby hats, and her stepmother's rubbers, through rain and mud, and being
                     waited upon by such men as Sam Doolittle.<pb n="110-111"

                  <p>"If I only had courage," she said, between her set teeth, "to jump in there and
                     make an end of it. I will some day—or I'll run away. I don't much care what
                     becomes of me. Nothing can be worse than this sort of life—nothing."</p>
                  <p>She looked dangerous as she thought it—dangerous to herself and others, and
                     ready for any desperate deed. So absorbed was she in her own gloomy thoughts,
                     as she sat there, that she never heard a footstep descending the rocky path
                     behind her. Suddenly two gloved hands were clasped over her eyes, and a mellow,
                     masculine voice, sang a verse of an appropriate song: <q>

                  <p>She held out both her hands, the whole expression of her face changing—her eyes
                     like stars.</p>
                  <p>"Charley, Miss Darrell, and if it had been the Man in the Moon you could hardly
                     look more thunderstruck. And now, if I may venture to propound so delicate a
                     conundrum, how long is it since you lost your senses? Or had you ever any to
                     lose, that you sit here in the present beastly state of the weather, to get
                     comfortably drenched to the skin?"</p>
                  <p>He was holding both her hands, and looking at her as he spoke—a young man of
                     some five-and-twenty, with grey eyes and chestnut hair, well-looking and
                     well-dressed, and with that indescribable air of ease and fashion which belongs
                     to the "golden youth" of New York.</p>
                  <p>"You don't say you're glad to see me, Dithy, and you <emph>do</emph> look
                     uncommonly blank. Will you end my agonizing suspense on this point, Miss
                     Darrell, by saying it now, and giving me a sociable kiss?"</p>
                  <p>He made as though he would take it, but Edith drew back, laughing and blushing
                     a little.</p>
                  <p>"You know what Gretchen says to Faust: 'Love me as much as you like, but no
                     kissing, that is vulgar.' I agree with Gretchen—it is vulgar. Oh, Mr. Stuart,
                     what a surprise this is! I have just been reading a letter from your sister,
                     and she doesn't say a word of your coming."</p>
                  <p>"For the excellent reason that she knew nothing about it when that letter was
                     written. Let me look at you, Edie. What have you been doing to yourself since I
                     left, that you should fall away to a shadow in this manner? But perhaps your
                     failing is the natural and inevitable result of my leaving?"</p>
                  <p>"No doubt. Life would naturally be insupportable without you. Whatever
                        <emph>I</emph> may have lost, Mr. Stuart, it is quite evident you have not
                     lost the most striking trait in your character—your self-conceit."</p>
                  <p>"No," the young man answered; "my virtues are as lasting as they are numerous.
                     May I ask, how it is that I have suddenly become 'Mr. Stuart,' when it has been
                     'Charley' and 'dear Cousin Charley' for the past two years?"</p>
                  <p>Miss Darrell laughed a little and blushed a little again, showing very white
                     teeth and lovely color.</p>
                  <p>"I have been reading Trixy's letter, and it fills me with an awful respect for
                     you and all the Stuart family. How could I presume to address as plain Charley
                     any one so fortunate as the bosom friend of a baronet?"</p>
                  <p>"Ah!" Mr. Stuart remarked, placidly; "Trixy's been giving you a quarter quire
                     crossed sheets of that, has she? You really wade through that poor child's
                     interminable epistles, do you? I hardly know which to admire most, the genius
                     that can write twenty pages of—nothing—or the patience which reads it, word for
                     word. This one is Sir Victor from date to signature, I'll swear. Well, yes,
                     Miss Darrell, I know the baronet, and he's a very heavy swell and a blue
                     diamond of the first water. Talk of pedigree, there's a pedigree, if you like.

                     gods should have singled <emph>him</emph> out as the recipient of their favors,
                     and left <emph>me</emph> in the cold, is a problem I can't solve. He's a
                     baronet, he has more thousands a year, and more houses in more counties than
                     you, with your limited knowledge of arithmetic, could count. He has a fair
                     complexion, a melancholy contrast on that point to you, my poor Edith; he has
                     incipient, pale, yellow whiskers, he has an English accent, and he goes through
                     life mostly in a suit of Oxford mixture and a round felt hat. He's a very fine
                     fellow, and I approve of him. Need I say more?"</p>
                  <p>"More would be superfluous. If you approve of him, my lord, all is said in
                     that. And Lady Helena?"</p>
                  <p>"Lady Helena is a ponderous and venerable matron, in black silks, Chantilly
                     lace, and marabout feathers, who would weigh down sixteen of you and me, and
                     who worships the ground her nephew walks on. She is the daughter of a marquis
                     and a peeress in her own right. Think of that, you poor, little, half-civilized
                     Yankee girl, and blush to remember you never had an ancestor. But why do I
                     waste my breath and time in these details, when Trix has narrated them already
                     by the cubic foot. Miss Darrell, <emph>you</emph> may be a mermaid or a
                     kelpie—that sort of young person does exist, I believe, in a perpetual shower
                     bath, but I regret to inform you <emph>I</emph> am mortal—very mortal—subject
                     to melancholy colds in the head, and depressing attacks of influenza. At the
                     present moment, my patent leather boots are leaking at every pore, the garments
                     I wear beneath this gray overcoat are saturated, and little rills of rain water
                     are trickling down the small of my back. You nursed me through one prolonged
                     siege of fever and freezing—unless you are especially desirous of nursing me
                     through another, perhaps we had better get out of this. I merely throw out the
                     suggestion—it's a matter of indifference to me."</p>
                  <p>Edith laughed and turned to go.</p>
                  <p>"As it is by no means a matter of indifference to me, I move an adjournment to
                     the house. No, thank you, I don't want your arm. This isn't the fashionable
                     side of Broadway, at four o'clock of a summer afternoon. I talk of it, as
                     though I had been there—I who never was farther than Boston in my life, and
                     who, judging from present appearances, never will."</p>
                  <p>"Then," said Mr. Stuart, "it's very rash and premature to judge by present
                     appearances, my errand here being to—Miss Darrell, doesn't it strike you to
                     inquire <emph>what</emph> my errand here may be?"</p>
                  <p>"Shooting," Miss Darrell said, promptly.</p>
                  <p>"Shooting in March. Good Heavens, no!"</p>
                  <p>"Fishing then."</p>
                  <p>"Fishing is a delightful recreation in a rippling brook, on a hot August day,
                     but in this month and in this weather! For a Massachusetts young lady, Dithy, I
                     must say your guessing education has been shamefully neglected. No, I have come
                     for something better than either fishing or shooting—I have come for
                        <emph>you</emph>."</p>
                  <p>"Charley!"</p>
                  <p>"I've got her note somewhere," said Charley, feeling in his pockets as they
                     walked along, "if it hasn't melted away in the rain. No, here it is. Did Trix,
                     by any chance, allude to a projected tour of the governor's and the maternal's
                     to Europe?"</p>
                  <p>"Yes." Her eyes were fixed eagerly on his face, her lips apart, and breathless.
                     "Oh, Charley! what do you mean?"</p>
                  <p>In the intensity of her emotions she forgets to be formal, and becomes natural
                     and cousinly once more.</p>
                  <p>"Ah! I am Charley again. Here is the note. As it is your healthful and
                     refreshing custom to read your letters in the rain, I need hardly urge you to
                     open and peruse this one."</p>
                  <p>Hardly! She tore it open, and ran over it with kindling cheeks and fast
                     throbbing heart.</p>

                                 in the French and German languages, and would be invaluable to us
                                 on the journey, besides the pleasure your society will afford us
                                 all. If you think six hundred dollars per annum sufficient

                  </q>
                  <p>She had come to a stand still in the middle of the muddy road, while in a
                     rapture she devoured this. Now she looked up, her face transfigured—absolutely
                     glorified. Go to Europe! France, Italy, Germany, Switzerland! live in that
                     radiant upper world of her dreams! She turned to Charley, and to the
                     unutterable surprise of that young gentleman, flung her arms around him, and
                     gave him a frantic hug.</p>
                  <p>"Charley! Charley! <emph>Oh</emph>, Charley!" was all she could cry.</p>
                  <p>Mr. Stuart returned the impulsive embrace, with a promptitude and warmth that
                     did him credit.</p>
                  <p>"I never knew a letter of my mother's to have such a pleasant effect before.
                     How delightful it must be to be a postman. It is yes, then, Edith?"</p>
                  <p>"Oh, Charley! as if it could be anything else? I owe this to you—I know I do.
                     How shall I ever thank you?"</p>
                  <p>"By a repetition of your little performance. You won't? Well, as your
                     stepmother is looking at us out of the window, with a face of verjuice, perhaps
                     it is just as well. You're sure the dear old dad won't say no?"</p>
                  <p>"Poor papa!" her radiant face clouded a little, "he <emph>will</emph> miss me,
                     but no—he couldn't refuse me anything if he tried—least of all this. Charley, I
                        <emph>do</emph> thank you—dear, best cousin that ever was—with all my
                     heart!"</p>
                  <p>She held out both hands, her heart full, and brimming over in her black eyes.
                     For once in his life Charley Stuart forgot to be flippant and cynical. He held
                     the hands gently, and he looked half-laughingly, half-compassionately into the
                     flushed, earnest face.</p>
                  <p>"You poor child!" he said; "and you think the world outside this sea, and these
                     sandhills, is all sunshine and <foreign xml:lang="FRA">coleur de
                     rose</foreign>. Well, think so—it's a harmless delusion, and one that won't
                     last. And whatever betides," he said this earnestly, "whatever this new life
                     brings, you'll never blame <emph>me</emph>, Edith, for having taken you away
                     from the old one?"</p>
                  <p>"Never!" she answered. And she kept her word. In all the sadness—the shame, the
                     pain of the after-time, she would never have gone back if she could—she never
                     blamed him.</p>
                  <p>They walked on in silence. They were at the door of the ugly bleak house which
                     Edith Darrell for eighteen years had called home, but which she was never to
                     call home more. You would hardly have known her—so bright, so beautiful in a
                     moment had Hope made her—a smile on her lips, her eyes like dark diamonds. For
                     Charley, he watched her, as he might some interesting natural curiosity.</p>
                  <p>"When am I to be ready?" she asked him, softly, at the door.</p>
                  <p>"The sooner the better," he answered.</p>
                  <p>Then she opened it and went in.</p>

                  <head type="sub">A NIGHT IN THE SNOW.</head>
                  <p>ONE snowy February night, just two years before, Edith Darrel and Charles
                     Stuart had met for the first time—met in a very odd and romantic way.</p>
                  <p>Before relating that peculiar first meeting, let me premise that Edith
                     Darrell's mother had been born a Miss Eleanor Stuart, the daughter of a rich
                     New York merchant, who had fallen in love at an early period of her career with
                     her father's handsome book-keeper, Frederic Darrell, had eloped with him, and
                     been cast off by her whole family from thenceforth, forever. Ten years' hard
                     battling with poverty and ill-health had followed, and then one day she kissed
                     her husband and little daughter for the last time, and drifted wearily out of
                     the strife. Of course Mr. Darrell, a year or two after, married again for the
                     sake of having some one to look after his house and little Edith as much as
                     anything else.<pb n="116-117" xml:id="VAC6448-00000058"/> Mrs. Darrell No. 2
                     was in every respect the exact contrast of Mrs. Darrell No. 1. She was a brisk
                     little woman, with snapping black eyes, a sharp nose, a complexion of saffron,
                     and a tongue like a carving-knife. Frederic Darrell was by nature a feeble,
                     helpless sort of man, but she galvanized even him into a spasmodic sort of
                     life. He was master of three living languages and two dead ones.</p>
                  <p>"If you can't support your family by your hands, Mr. Darrell," snapped his
                     wife, "support them by your head. There are plenty young men in the world ready
                     to learn French and German, Greek and Latin, if they can learn them at a
                     reasonable rate. Advertise for these young men, and I'll board them when they
                     come."</p>
                  <p>He obeyed, the idea proved a good one, the young men came, Mrs. Darrell boarded
                     and lodged them, Mr. Darrell coached them in classics and languages. Edith shot
                     up like a hop-vine. Five more little Darrells were added in the fulness of
                     time, and the old problem, that not all the mathematics he knew could ever
                     solve, how to make both ends meet, seemed as knotty as ever. For his daughter
                     he felt it most of all. The five great noisy boys who called Mrs. Darrell "ma,"
                     he looked at through his spectacles in fear and trembling. His handsome
                     daughter he loved with his whole heart. Her dead mother's relatives were among
                     the plutocracy of New York, but even the memory of the dead Eleanor seemed to
                     have faded utterly out of their minds.</p>
                  <p>One raw February afternoon two years before this March morning, Edith Darrell
                     set out to walk from Millfield, a large manufacturing town, five miles from
                     Sandypoint, home. She had been driven over in the morning by a neighbor, to buy
                     a new dress; she had dined at noon with an acquaintance, and as the Millfield
                     clocks struck five, set out to walk home. She was a capital walker; she knew
                     the road well; she had the garnet merino clasped close in her arms, a talisman
                     against cold or weariness, and thinking how well she would look in it next
                     Thursday at the party, she tripped blithely along. A keen wind blew, a dark
                     drifting sky hung low over the black frozen earth, and before Miss Darrell had
                     finished the first mile of her pilgrimage, the great feathery snow flakes began
                     whirling down. She looked up in dismay—snow! She had not counted on that. Her
                     way lay over hills and down valleys, the path was excellent, hard and beaten,
                     but if it snowed—and night was coming on fast. What should she do? Prudence
                     whispered, "turn back;" youth's impatience and confidence in itself cried out,
                     "go on," Edith went on.</p>
                  <p>It was as lonely a five-mile walk as you would care to take in an August
                     noontide. Think what it must have been this stormy February evening. She was
                     not entirely alone. "Don Cæsar," the house dog, a big English mastiff, trotted
                     by her side. At long intervals, down by-paths and across fields, there were
                     some half dozen habitations, between Millfield and Sandypoint—that was all.
                     Faster, faster came the white whirling flakes; an out-and-out February snow
                     storm had set in.</p>
                  <p>Again—should she turn back? She paused half a minute to debate the question. If
                     she did there would be a sleepless night of terror for her nervous father at
                     home. And she <emph>might</emph> be able to keep the path with the "Don's" aid.
                     Personal fear she felt none; she was a thoroughly brave little woman, and there
                     was a spice of adventure in braving the storm and going on. She shook back her
                     clustering curls, tied her hood a little tighter, wrapped her cloak more
                     closely around her, whistled cheerily to Don Cæsar, and went on.</p>
                  <p>"In the bright lexicon of youth there is no such word as 'Fail'," she said
                     gayly, patting the Don's shaggy head. "<foreign xml:lang="FRA">En
                        avant</foreign>, Don Cæsar, <foreign xml:lang="FRA">mon brave!</foreign>"
                     The Don understood French; he licked his mistress's hand and trotted
                     contentedly before.</p>
                  <p>"As if I <emph>could</emph> lose the path with the Don," she thought; "what a
                     goose I am. I shall make Mamma Darrell cut out my garnet merino, and begin it
                     before I go to bed to-night."</p>
                  <p>She walked bravely and brightly on, whistling and talking to Don Cæsar at
                     intervals. Another mile was got over, and the night had shut down, white with
                     whirling drifts. It was all she could do now, to make her way against the
                     storm, and it grew worse every instant. Three miles of the five lay yet before
                     her. Her heart began to fail her a little; the path was lost in the snow, and
                     even the Don began to be at fault. The drifting wilderness nearly blinded her,
                     the deep snow was unutterably fatiguing. There was but one thing<pb n="118-119"
                        xml:id="VAC6448-00000059"/> in her favor—the night, for February, was mild.
                     She was all in a glow of warmth, but what if she should get lost and flounder
                     about here until morning? And what would papa think of her absence?</p>
                  <p>She stopped short again. If she could see a light she would make for it, she
                     thought, and take refuge from the night and storm. But through the white whirl
                     no light was to be seen. Right or wrong, nothing remained but to go on.</p>
                  <p>Hark! what was that? She stopped once more—the Don pricked up his sagacious
                     ears. A cry unmistakably—a cry of distress.</p>
                  <p>Again it came, to the left, faint and far off. Yes—no doubt about it, a cry for
                     help.</p>
                  <p>She did not hesitate a moment. Strangers, who had tried this hillpath before
                     now, had been found stark frozen next day.</p>
                  <p>"Find him, Don—find him, good fellow!" she said and turned at once in the
                     direction of the call.</p>
                  <p>"Coming!" she shouted, aloud. "Where are you? Call again."</p>
                  <p>"Here," came faintly over the snow. "Here, to the left."</p>
                  <p>She shouted back a cheery answer. Once more came a faint reply—then all was
                     still.</p>
                  <p>Suddenly the Don stopped. Impossible to tell where they were, but there,
                     prostrate in a feathery drift, lay the dark figure of a man. The girl bent down
                     in the darkness, and touched the cold face with her hand.</p>
                  <p>"What is the matter?" she asked. "How do you come to be lying here?"</p>
                  <p>There was just life enough left within him, to enable him to answer
                     faintly.</p>
                  <p>"I was on my way to Sandypoint—the night and storm overtook me. I missed the
                     path and my footing; I slipped, and have broken my leg, I'm afraid. I heard you
                     whistling to your dog and tried to call. I didn't dream it was a woman, and I
                     am sorry I have brought you out of your way. Still, as you <emph>are</emph>
                     here, if you will tell them at the nearest house, and—" his voice died entirely
                     away, in the sleepy cadence of a freezing man.</p>
                  <p>The nearest house—where <emph>was</emph> the nearest house? Why, this poor
                     fellow would freeze to death in half an hour if left to himself. Impossible to
                     leave him. What should she do? She thought for a moment. Quick and bright of
                     invention, she made up her mind what to do, She had in her pocket a little
                     passbook and pencil. In the darkness she tore out a leaf—in the darkness she
                     wrote, "Follow Don. Come at once." She pinned the note in her handkerchief—tied
                     the handkerchief securely round the dog's neck, put her arms about him, and
                     gave his black head a hug.</p>
                  <p>"Go home, Don, go home," she said, "and fetch papa here."</p>
                  <p>The large, half-human eyes looked up at her. She pushed him away with both
                     hands, and with a low growl of intelligence he set off. And in that sea of
                     snow, lost in the night, Edith Darrell was alone with a freezing man.</p>
                  <p>In her satchel, among her other purchases, she had several cents' worth of
                     matches for household consumption. With a girl's curiosity, even in that hour,
                     to see what the man was like, she struck a match and looked at him. It flared
                     through the white darkness a second or two, then went out. That second showed
                     her a face as white as the snow itself, the eyes closed, the lips set in silent
                     pain. She saw a shaggy great coat, and fur cap, and—a gentleman, even in that
                     briefest of brief glances.</p>
                  <p>"You mustn't go to sleep," she said, giving him a shake; "do you hear me, sir?
                     You mustn't go to sleep."</p>
                  <p>"Yes—mustn't I?" very drowsily.</p>
                  <p>"You'll freeze to death if you do." A second shake. "Oh, do rouse up like a
                     good fellow, and try to keep awake. I've sent my dog for help, and I mean to
                     stay with you until it comes. Does your leg pain you much?"</p>
                  <p>"Not now. It did, but I—feel—sleepy, and—"</p>
                  <p>"I tell you, you <emph>mustn't</emph>!" She shook him so indignantly this time
                     that he did rouse up. "Do you want to freeze to death? I tell you, sir, you
                     must wake up and talk to <emph>me</emph>."</p>
                  <p>"Talk to you? I beg your pardon—it's awfully good of you to stay with me, but I
                     can't allow it. You'll freeze yourself."</p>
                  <p>"No, I won't. <emph>I'm</emph> all right. It isn't freezing hard to-night, and
                     if you hadn't broken your leg, you wouldn't freeze either. I wish I could do
                     something for you. Let me rub your hands—it may help to keep you awake. And
                     see, I'll wrap this round your feet to keep them out of the snow."</p>
                  <pb n="120-121" xml:id="VAC6448-00000060"/>
                  <p>And then—who says that heroic self-sacrifice has gone out of fashion?—she
                     unfurled the garnet merino and twisted its glowing folds around the boots of
                     the fallen man.</p>
                  <p>"It's awfully good of you, you know," he could but just repeat. "If I am saved
                     I shall owe my life to you. I think by your voice you are a young lady. Tell me
                     your name?"</p>
                  <p>"Edith."</p>
                  <p>"A pretty name, and a sweet voice. Suppose you rub my other hand? How
                     delightfully warm yours are! I begin to feel better already. If we
                        <emph>don't</emph> freeze to death, I shouldn't much mind how long this sort
                     of thing goes on. If we do, they'll find us, like the babes in the wood, under
                     the snow-drifts to-morrow."</p>
                  <p>Miss Darrell listened to all this, uttered in the sleepiest, gentlest of tones,
                     her brown eyes open wide. What manner of young man was this who paid
                     compliments while freezing with a broken leg? It was quite a new experience to
                     her and amused her. It was an adventure, and excited all the romance dormant in
                     her nature.</p>
                  <p>"You're a stranger hereabouts?" she suggested.</p>
                  <p>"Yes, a stranger, to my cost, and a very foolhardy one, or I should never have
                     attempted to find Sandypoint in this confounded storm. Edith—you'll excuse my
                     calling you so, <emph>my</emph> name is Charley—wouldn't it have been better if
                     you had left me here and gone for some one. I'm dreadfully afraid you'll get
                     your death."</p>
                  <p>His solicitude for her, in his own danger and pain, quite touched Miss Edith.
                     She bent over him with maternal tenderness.</p>
                  <p>"There is no fear for me. I feel perfectly warm as I told you, and can easily
                     keep myself so. And if you think I could leave you, or any one else with a
                     broken leg, to die, you mistake me greatly, that is all. I will stay with you
                     if it be till morning."</p>
                  <p>He gave one of her hands a feebly grateful squeeze. It was a last effort. His
                     numbed and broken limb gave a horrible twinge, there was a faint gasp, and then
                     this young man fainted quietly away.</p>
                  <p>She bent above him in despair. A great fear filled her—was he dead, this
                     stranger in whom she was interested already? She lifted his head on her lap,
                     she chafed his face and hands in an agony of pity and terror.</p>
                  <p>"Charley!" she called, with something like a sob; "O Charley, don't die! Wake
                     up—speak to me."</p>
                  <p>But cold and white as the snow itself, "Charley" lay, dumb and
                     unresponsive.</p>
                  <p>And so an hour wore on.</p>
                  <p>What an hour it was—more like an eternity. In all her after-life—its pride and
                     its glory, its downfall and disgrace, that night remained vividly in her
                     memory.</p>
                  <p>She woke many and many a night, starting up in her warm bed, from some
                     startling dream, that she was back, lost in the snow, with Charley lying
                     lifeless in her lap.</p>
                  <p>But help was at hand. It was close upon nine o'clock, when, through the deathly
                     white silence, the sound of many voices came. When over the cold glitter of the
                     winter night, the red light of lanterns flared, Don Cæsar came plunging
                     headlong through the drifts to his little mistress' side, with loud and joyful
                     barking, licking her face, her hands, her feet. They were saved.</p>
                  <p>She sank back sick and dizzy in her father's clasp. For a moment the earth
                     rocked, and the sky went round—then she sprang up, herself again. Her father
                     was there, and the three young men, boarders. They lifted the rigid form of the
                     stranger, and carried it between them somehow, to Mr. Darrell's house.</p>
                  <p>His feet were slightly frost-bitten, his leg not broken after all, only
                     sprained and swollen, and to Edith's relief he was pronounced in a
                     fainting-fit, not dead.</p>
                  <p>"Don't look so white and scared, child," her step-mother said pettishly to her
                     step-daughter; "he won't die, and a pretty burthen he'll be on my hands for the
                     next three weeks. Go to bed—do—and don't let us have <emph>you</emph> laid up
                     as well. One's enough at a time."</p>
                  <p>"Yes, Dithy, darling, go," said her father, kissing her tenderly. "You're a
                     brave little woman, and you've saved his life. I have always been proud of you,
                     but never so proud as to-night."</p>
                  <p>It certainly <emph>was</emph> a couple of weeks. It was five blessed weeks
                     before "Mr. Charley," as they learned to call him,<pb n="122-123"
                        xml:id="VAC6448-00000061"/> could get about, even on crutches. For fever and
                     sometimes delirium set in, and Charley raved and tossed, and shouted, and
                     talked, and drove Mrs. Frederic Darrell nearly frantic with his capers. The
                     duty of nursing fell a good deal on Edith. She seemed to take to it quite
                     naturally. In his "worst spells" the sound of her soft voice, the touch of her
                     cool hand, could soothe him as nothing else could. Sometimes he sung, as
                     boisterously as his enfeebled state would allow: "We won't go home till
                     morning!" Sometimes he shouted for his mother; very often for "Trixy."</p>
                  <p>
                     <emph>Who</emph> was Trixy, Edith wondered with a sort of inward twinge, not to
                     be accounted for; his sister or—</p>
                  <p>He was very handsome in those days—his great gray eyes brilliant with fever,
                     his cheeks flushed, his chestnut hair falling damp and heavy off his brow. What
                     an adventure it was, altogether, Edith used to think, like something out of a
                     book. Who was he, she wondered. A gentleman "by courtesy and the grace of God,"
                     no mistaking <emph>that</emph>. His clothes, his linen, were all superfine. On
                     one finger he wore a diamond that made all beholders wink, and in his shirt
                     bosom still another. His wallet was stuffed with greenbacks, his watch and
                     chain, Mr. Darrell affirmed were worth a thousand dollars—a sprig of gentility,
                     whoever he might be, this wounded hero. They found no papers, no letters, no
                     card-case. His linen was marked "C. S." twisted in a monogram. They must wait
                     until he was able himself to tell them the rest.</p>
                  <p>The soft sunshine of April was filling his room, and basking in its rays in the
                     parlor or rocking-chair sat "Mr. Charley," pale and wasted to a most
                     interesting degree. He was sitting, looking at Miss Edith, digging
                     industriously in her flower-garden, with one of the boarders for
                     under-gardener, and listening to Mr. Darrell, proposing he should tell them his
                     name, in order that they might write to his friends. The young man turned his
                     large languid eyes from the daughter without, to the father within.</p>
                  <p>"My friends? Oh! to be sure. But it isn't necessary, is it? It's very
                     thoughtful of you, and all that, but my friends won't worry themselves into an
                     early grave about my absence and silence. They're used to both. Next week, or
                     week after, I'll drop them a line myself. I know I must be an awful nuisance to
                     Mrs. Darrell, but if I <emph>might</emph> trespass on your great kindness and
                     remain here until—"</p>
                  <p>"My dear young friend," responded Mr. Darrell, warmly, "you shall most
                     certainly remain here. For Mrs. Darrell, you're no trouble to her—it's Dithy,
                     bless her, who does all the nursing."</p>
                  <p>The gray dreamy eyes turned from Mr. Darrell again, to that busy figure in the
                     garden. With her cheeks flushed, her brown eyes shining, her rosy lips apart,
                     and laughing, as she wrangled with that particular boarder on the subject of
                     floriculture, she looked a most dangerous nurse for any young man of
                     three-and-twenty.</p>
                  <p>"I owe Miss Darrell and you all, more than I can ever repay," he said, quietly;
                        "<emph>that</emph> is understood. I have never tried to thank her, or you
                     either—words are so inadequate in these cases. Believe me though, I am not
                     ungrateful."</p>
                  <p>"Say no more," Mr. Darrell cut in hastily; "only tell us how we are to address
                     you while you remain. 'Mr. Charley' is an unsatisfactory sort of
                     application."</p>
                  <p>"My name is Stuart; but, as a favor, may I request you to go on calling me
                     Charley?"</p>
                  <p>"Stuart!" said the other, quickly; "one of the Stuarts, bankers, of New
                     York?"</p>
                  <p>"The same. My father is James Stuart; you know him probably?"</p>
                  <p>The face of Frederic Darrell darkened and grew almost stern. "Your father was
                     my wife's cousin—Edith's mother. Have you never heard him speak of Eleanor
                     Stuart?"</p>
                  <p>"Who married Frederic Darrell? Often. My dear Mr. Darrell, is it possible that
                     you—that I have the happiness of being related to you?"</p>
                  <p>"To my daughter, if you like—her second cousin—to me, <emph>no</emph>," Mr.
                     Darrell said, half-smiling, half-sad. "Your father and his family long ago
                     repudiated all claims of mine—I am not going to force myself upon their notice
                     now. Edie—Edie, my love, come in here, and listen to some strange news."</p>
                  <p>She threw down her spade, and came in laughing and glowing, her hair tumbled,
                     her collar awry, her dress soiled, her hands not over clean, but looking, oh!
                     so indescribably fresh, and fair, and healthful, and handsome.</p>
                  <pb n="124-125" xml:id="VAC6448-00000062"/>
                  <p>"What is it?" she asked. "Has Mr. Charley gone and sprained his other
                     ankle?"</p>
                  <p>"Not quite so bad as that." And then her father narrated the discovery they had
                     mutually made. Miss Dithy opened her bright brown eyes.</p>
                  <p>"Like a chapter out of a novel where everybody turns out to be somebody else.
                     'It is—it is—it is—my own, my long-lost son!' And so we're second cousins, and
                     you're Charley Stuart; and Trixy—now who's Trixy?"</p>
                  <p>"Trixy's my sister. How do you happen to know anything about her?"</p>
                  <p>Edith made a wry face.</p>
                  <p>"The nights I've spent—the days I've dragged through, the tortures I've
                     undergone, listening to you shouting for 'Trixy,' would have driven any less
                     well-balanced brain stark mad! May I sit down? Digging in the sunshine, and
                     rowing with Johnny Ellis is awfully hot work."</p>
                  <p>"Digging in the sunshine is detrimental to the complexion, and rowing with
                     Johnny Ellis is injurious to the temper. I object to both."</p>
                  <p>"Oh, you do?" said Miss Darrell, opening her eyes again; "it matters so much,
                     too, whether you object or not. Johnny Ellis is useful, and sometimes
                     agreeable. Charley Stuart is neither one nor t'other. If I mayn't dig and
                     quarrel with him, is there anything your lordship would like me to do?"</p>
                  <p>"You may sit on this footstool at my feet—woman's proper place—and read me to
                     sleep. That book you were reading aloud yesterday—what was it? Oh, 'Pendennis,'
                     was rather amusing—what I heard of it."</p>
                  <p>"What you heard of it!" Miss Darrell retorts, indignantly. "You do well to add
                     that. The man who could go to sleep listening to Thackeray is a man worthy only
                     of contempt and scorn! There's Mr. Ellis calling me—I must go."</p>
                  <p>Miss Darrell and Mr. Stuart, in his present state of convalescence, rarely met
                     except to quarrel. They spoke their minds to one another, with a refreshing
                     frankness remarkable to hear.</p>
                  <p>"You remind me of one I loved very dearly once, Dithy," Charley said to her,
                     sadly, one day, after an unusually stormy wordy war—"in fact, the only one I
                     ever <emph>did</emph> love. You resemble her, too—the same sort of hair and
                     complexion, and exactly the same sort of—ah—temper! Her name was Fido—she was a
                     black and tan terrier—very like you, my dear, very like. Ah! these accidental
                     resemblances are cruel things—they tear open half-healed wounds, and cause them
                     to bleed afresh. Fido met with an untimely end—she was drowned one dark night
                     in a cistern. I thought I had outlived <emph>that</emph> grief, but when I look
                     at you—"</p>
                  <p>A stinging box on the ear, given with right good will, cut short the mournful
                     reminiscence, and brought tears to Mr. Stuart's eyes, that were not tears of
                     grief for Fido.</p>
                  <p>"You wretch!" cried Miss Darrell, with flashing eyes. "I've a complexion of
                     black and tan, have I, and a temper to match! The only thing <emph>I</emph> see
                     to regret in your story is, that it wasn't Fido's master who fell into the
                     cistern, instead of Fido. To think I should live to be called a black and
                     tan!"</p>
                  <p>They never met except to quarrel. Edith's inflammatory temper was up in arms
                     perpetually. They kept the house in an uncommonly lively state. It seemed to
                     agree with Charley. His twisted ankle grew strong rapidly, flesh and color came
                     back, the world was not to be robbed of one of its brightest ornaments just
                     yet. He put off writing to his friends from day to day, to the great
                     disapproval of Mr. Darrell, who was rather behind the age in his notions of
                     filial duty.</p>
                  <p>"It's of no use worrying," Mr. Stuart made answer, with the easy <foreign
                        xml:lang="FRA">insouciance</foreign> concerning all things earthly which sat
                     so naturally upon him; "bad shillings always come back—let that truthful old
                     adage console them. Why should I fidget myself about them. Take my word they're
                     not fidgeting themselves about <emph>me</emph>. The governor's absorbed in the
                     rise and fall of stocks, the maternal is up to her eyes in the last parties of
                     the season, and my sister is just out and absorbed body and soul in beaux and
                     dresses. They never expect me until they see me."</p>
                  <p>About the close of April Mr. Stuart and Miss Darrell fought their last battle
                     and parted. He went back to New York and to his own world, and life stagnant
                     and flat flowed back on its old level for Edith Darrell.</p>
                  <p>Stagnant and flat it had always been, but never half so<pb n="126-127"
                        xml:id="VAC6448-00000063"/> dreary as now. Something had come into her life
                     and gone out of it, something bright and new, and wonderfully pleasant. There
                     was a great blank where Charley's handsome face had been, and all at once life
                     seemed to lose its relish for this girl of sixteen. A restlessness took
                     possession <choice>
                        <sic>of of</sic>
                        <corr>of</corr>
                     </choice> her. Sandypoint and all belonging to it grew distasteful. She wanted
                     change, excitement—Charley Stuart, perhaps—something different certainly from
                     what she was used to, or likely to get.</p>
                  <p>Charley went home and told the "governor," and the "maternal," and "Trixy" of
                     his adventure, and the girl who had saved his life. Miss Beatrix listened in a
                     glow of admiration.</p>
                  <p>"Is she pretty, Charley?" she asked, of course, the first inevitable female
                     question.</p>
                  <p>"Pretty?" Charley responded, meditatively, as though the idea struck him for
                     the first time. "Well, ye-e-es. In a cream-colored sort of way, Edith isn't
                     bad-looking. It would be very nice of you now, Trix, to write her a letter, I
                     think, seeing she saved my life, and nursed me, and is your second cousin, and
                     everything."</p>
                  <p>Beatrix needed no urging. She was an impetuous, enthusiastic young woman of
                     eighteen, fearfully and wonderfully addicted to correspondence. She sat down
                     and wrote a long, gushing letter to her "cream-colored" cousin. Mrs. Stuart
                     dropped her a line of thanks also, and Charley, of course, wrote, and there her
                     adventure seemed to come to an end. Miss Stuart's letters were long and
                     frequent. Mr. Stuart's rambling epistle alternately made her laugh and lose her
                     temper, a daily loss with poor, discontented Edith. With the fine
                     discrimination most men possess, he sent her, on her seventeenth birthday, a
                     set of turquoise and pearls, which made her sallow complexion hideous, or, at
                     least, as hideous as anything <emph>can</emph> make a pretty girl. That summer
                     he ran down to Sandypoint for a fortnight's fishing, and an oasis came suddenly
                     in the desert of Edith's life. She and Charley might quarrel still, and I am
                     bound to say they did, on every possible occasion and on every possible point,
                        <emph>but</emph> they were never satisfied a moment apart.</p>
                  <p>The fortnight ended, the fish were caught, he went back, and the dull days and
                     the long nights, the cooking, darning, mending began again, and went on until
                     madness would have been a relief. It was the old story of the Sleeping Beauty
                     waiting for the prince to come, and wake her <choice>
                        <sic>into into</sic>
                        <corr>into</corr>
                     </choice> life and love with his kiss. Only in this instance the prince had
                     come and gone, and left Beauty, in the sulks, behind.</p>
                  <p>She was eighteen years old and sick of her life. And just when disgust and
                     discontent were taking palpable form, and she was debating between a jump into
                     Sandypoint bay and running off, came Charley, with his mother's letter. From
                     that hour the story of Edith Darrell's life began.</p>

               <div type="chapter">
                  <head>CHAPTER III.</head>
                  <head type="sub">TRIXY'S PARTY.</head>
                  <p>TWO weeks sufficed for Miss Darrell's preparations. A quantity of new linen,
                     three new dresses, one hat, one spring sacque—that was all.</p>
                  <p>Mr. Darrell had consented—what was there he could have refused his darling? He
                     had consented, hiding the bitter pang it cost him, deep in his own quiet heart.
                     It was the loss of her mother over again; the tender passion and the present
                     Mrs. Darrell were two facts perfectly incompatible.</p>
                  <p>Mrs. Darrell aided briskly in the preparation—to tell the truth, she was not
                     sorry to be rid of her step-daughter, between whom and herself perpetual war
                     raged. Edith as a worker was a failure; she went about the dingy house, in her
                     dingy dresses, with the air of an out-at-elbows duchess. She snubbed the
                     boarders, she boxed the juvenile Darrell's ears, she "sassed" the mistress of
                     the house.</p>
                  <p>"It speaks volumes for your amiability, Dithy," Charley remarked, "the intense
                     eagerness and delight, with which everybody in this establishment hails your
                     departure. Four dirty little Darrells run about the passages with their
                     war-whoop, 'Dithy's going—hooray! Now we'll have fun!' Your step-mother's sere
                     and yellow visage beams with bliss;<pb n="128-129" xml:id="VAC6448-00000064"/>
                     even the young gentlemen who are lodged and boarded, Greek-ed and Latin-ed
                     here, wear faces of suppressed relief, that tells its own tale to the student
                     of human nature. Your welfare must be unspeakably precious to them, Edie, when
                     they bear their approaching bereavement so well."</p>
                  <p>He paused. The speech was a lengthy one, and lengthy speeches mostly exhausted
                     Mr. Stuart. He lay back, watching his fair relative as she sat sewing near,
                     with lazy, half-closed eyes.</p>
                  <p>Her work dropped in her lap, a faint flush rose up over her dusk face.</p>
                  <p>"Charley," she responded, gravely, "I don't wonder you say this—it is true, and
                     nobody feels it more than I. I <emph>am</emph> a disagreeable creature, a
                     selfish nuisance, an idle, discontented kill-joy. I only wonder, you are not
                     afraid to take me with you at all."</p>
                  <p>Mr. Stuart sat up, rather surprised.</p>
                  <p>"My dearest coz, <emph>don't</emph> be so tremendously in earnest. If I had
                     thought you were going to take it seriously—"</p>
                  <p>"Let us be serious for once—we have all our lives left for quarrelling," said
                     Miss Darrell, as though quarrelling were a pleasant recreation. "I sit down and
                     try to think sometimes why I am so miserable—so wretched in my present life,
                     why I hail the prospect of a new one with such delight. I see other
                     girls—nicer, cleverer girls than I am every way, and their lives suffice for
                     them—the daily, domestic routine that is most horrible drudgery to me, pleases
                     and satisfies them. It must be that I have an incapacity for life; I daresay
                     when the novelty and gloss wear off, I shall tire equally of the life I am
                     going to. A new dress, a dance, a beau, and the hope of a prospective husband
                     suffices for the girls I speak of. For me—none of your sarcastic smiles,
                     sir—the thought of a future husband is—"</p>
                  <p>"Only vanity and vexation of spirit. But there <emph>is</emph> a future
                     husband. You are forced to admit that, Dithy. I wonder what he is to be like? A
                     modern Sir Launcelot, with the beauty of all the gods, the courage of a Cœur de
                     Lion, the bow of a Chesterfield, and the purse of Fortunatus. That's the photo,
                     isn't it?"</p>
                  <p>"No, sir—not a bit like it. The purse of a Fortunatus, if you like—I ask
                     nothing more. The Sir Launcelots of life, if they exist at all, are mostly poor
                     men, and I don't want anything to do with poor men. My marriage is to be a
                     purely business transaction—I settled <emph>that</emph> long ago. He may have
                     the form and face of a Satyr; he may have seventy years, so that he be worth a
                     million or so, I will drop my best courtesy when he asks, and say, 'Yes, and
                     thanky, sir.' If the Apollo himself, knelt before me, with an empty purse, I
                     should turn my back upon him in pity and disdain."</p>
                  <p>"Is that meant for me, Edie?" Mr. Stuart inquired, rising on his elbow, and
                     admiringly gazing at his own handsome face in the glass. "Because if it is,
                     don't excite yourself. Forewarned is forearmed—I'm not going to ask you."</p>
                  <p>"I never thought you were," Edith said, laughing. "I never aspired so high. As
                     well love some bright particular star, etcetera, etcetera, as the only son of
                     James Stuart, Esquire, lineal descendant of the Princes of Scotland, and banker
                     of Wall Street. No, Charley, I know what <emph>you</emph> will do. You'll drift
                     through life for the next three or four years, as you have drifted up to the
                     present, well looking, well dressed, well mannered, and then some day your
                     father will come to you and say gruffly, 'Charles!' (Edith grows dramatic as
                     she narrates—it is a husky masculine voice that speaks:) 'Here's Miss
                     Petroleum's father, with a million and a half—only child—order a suit of new
                     clothes and go and ask her to marry you!' And you will look at him with a
                     helpless sigh, and go. Your father will select your wife, sir, and you'll take
                     her, like a good boy, when you're told. I shouldn't wonder now, but that it is
                     to select a wife for you, and a husband for Trixy, he is taking this projected
                     trip to Europe."</p>
                  <p>"Shouldn't you? Neither should I. Never wonder. Against my principles," Charley
                     murmurs.</p>
                  <p>"There are plenty of titled aristocracy abroad—so I am told—ready to
                     silver-gild their coronets by a union with plutocracy. Plenty Lady Janes and
                     Lady Marys ready to sell themselves to the highest bidder."</p>
                  <p>"As Edith Darrell is?"</p>
                  <p>"As Edith Darrell is. It's all very fine talking of love<pb n="130-131"
                        xml:id="VAC6448-00000065"/> and devotion, and the emptiness of life without.
                     Believe me, if one has plenty of money one can dispense with love. I've read a
                     good many novels, but they haven't turned my head on <emph>that</emph> subject.
                     From all I've read, indeed, I should think it must be a very uncomfortable sort
                     of intermittent fever, indeed. Don't love anybody except yourself, and it is
                     out of the power of any human being to make you <emph>very</emph>
                     wretched."</p>
                  <p>"A sentiment whose truth is only equaled by its—selfishness."</p>
                  <p>"Yes, it is selfish; and it is your thoroughly selfish people, who get the best
                     of everything in this world. I am selfish and worldly—ambitious and heartless,
                     and all that is abominable. I may as well own it. You'll find it out for
                     yourself soon."</p>
                  <p>"A most unnecessary acknowledgment, my dear child—it is patent to the dullest
                     observer. But, now, Edith—look here—this is serious, mind!" He raises himself
                     again on his elbow, and looks, with a curious smile into her darkly-earnest,
                     cynical young face. "Suppose I am madly in love with you—'madly in love' is the
                     correct phrase, isn't it?—suppose I am at your feet, going through all the
                     phases of the potential mood, 'commanding, exhorting, entreating' you to marry
                     me—you wouldn't say no, would you, Edie? You like me—don't deny it. You know
                     you do—like me well enough to marry me to-morrow. Would you refuse me in spite
                     of my dependence on my father, and my empty purse?"</p>
                  <p>He took her hand, and held it tightly, despite her struggles.</p>
                  <p>"Would you, Edie?" he says, putting his arm around her waist. "I'm not a
                     sentimental fellow, but I believe in love. Come! you wouldn't—you couldn't bid
                     me go."</p>
                  <p>Her color had risen—that lovely rose-pink color, that lit her brunette face
                     into such beauty—but she resolutely freed herself, and met his half-tender,
                     half-merry glance, full.</p>
                  <p>"I would," she said, "if I—liked you so, that you filled my whole heart. Let me
                     go, sir, and no more of this non-sense. I know what I am talking about, and
                     what comes of marrying for love. There was my own mother, she left a rich and
                     luxurious home, wealthy suitors, all the comforts and elegances of life,
                     without which life isn't worth living, and ran away with papa. Then followed
                     long years of poverty, discomfort, illness, and miserable grubbing. She never
                     complained—perhaps she wasn't even very unhappy; her's wasn't the sort of love
                     that flies out of the window when poverty comes in at the door—she just faded
                     away and died. For myself I have been dissatisfied with <emph>my</emph> lot
                     ever since I can remember—pining for the glory and grandeur of this wicked
                     world. There is but one way in which they can ever be mine—by marriage. If
                     marriage will not bring them, then I will go to my grave Edith Darrell."</p>
                  <p>"Which I don't think you will," Mr. Stuart responded. "Young ladies like you,
                     who set out on the search-matrimonial with lots of common-sense, worldliness,
                     selfishness, and mercenary motives, generally reach the goal. It's a fair
                     enough exchange—so much youth and good looks for so many thousand dollars. I
                     wish you all success, Miss Darrell, in your laudable undertaking. It is well we
                     should understand each other, at once and forever, or even I some day might be
                     tempted to make a fool of myself. Your excellent counsels, my dearest cousin,
                     will be invaluable to me, should my lagging footsteps falter by the way. Edith!
                     where have you learned to be so hard, so worldly, so—if you will pardon me—so
                     unwomanly?"</p>
                  <p>"Is it unwomanly?" she repeated dreamily. "Well, perhaps it is. I am honest at
                     least—give me credit for that. My own hard life has taught me, books have
                     taught me, looking at my mother and listening to my step-mother have taught me.
                     I feel old at eighteen—old and tired. I am just one of those girls, I think,
                     who turn out very good or very bad women, as fate deals with them. It's not too
                     late yet to draw back, Charley. Your mother can easily get another young lady
                     to do the French and German business. You can tell her I don't suit, and leave
                     me at home."</p>
                  <p>"Not too late to draw back," he said, with his indolent smile. "Is there ever
                     such a thing as drawing back at all? What is done is done. I couldn't go
                     without you now, if I tried. O, don't look alarmed, I don't mean anything. You
                     amuse and interest me, that is all. You're something of a study—entirely
                     different from the genus young lady I'm accustomed<pb n="132-133"
                        xml:id="VAC6448-00000066"/> customed to. Only—keep your frankness for Cousin
                     Charley, he's harmless; don't display it to the rest of the world. It might
                     spoil your chances. Even senile millionnaires don't care to walk into the trap,
                     unless the springs are hidden in roses. Come, throw down that endless sewing,
                     and let's have a walk on the beach. Who knows when we may see the sun go down,
                     together again, over the classic waters of Sandypoint Bay."</p>
                  <p>Edith laughed, but she rose to obey.</p>
                  <p>"And I thought you were not sentimental, One would think it the Bay of Naples.
                     However, as we start to-morrow, I don't mind going down and bidding the old
                     rocks and sands good-by."</p>
                  <p>She put on her hat, and the two went wandering away together, to watch the sun
                     set over the sea. In the rosy light of the spring sunset, the fishing boats
                     drifted on the shining waters, and the fisherman's chant came borne to their
                     ears.</p>
                  <p>"It reminds me of that other April evening two years ago, Dithy, when we came
                     down here to say good-by. You cried then at parting—do you remember? But you
                     were only sixteen, poor child, and knew no better. You wouldn't cry now, would
                     you, for any man in the universe?"</p>
                  <p>"Not for Charley Stuart certainly—he needn't think it."</p>
                  <p>"He doesn't think it, my pet; he never looks for impossibilities. I wonder if
                     that night in the snow were to come again if you'd risk your life now, as you
                     did then?"</p>
                  <p>"Risk my life! What bosh! There was no risk; and bad as I am, and heartless as
                     I've grown, I don't think—I <emph>don't</emph> think I'd walk away, and leave
                     any poor wretch to die. Yes, Charley, if the night in the snow came over again,
                     I'd do now as I did then."</p>
                  <p>"I don't believe it was a kindness after all," Charley responds. "I have a
                     presentiment that a day will come, Dithy, when I'll hate you. I shouldn't have
                     suffered much if you had let me freeze to death. And I've a strong prescience
                     (is that the word) that I'll fall in love with you some day, and be jilted, and
                     undergo untold torture, and hate you with a perfect frenzy. It will be a very
                     fatiguing experience, but I feel in my bones that it is to be."</p>
                  <p>"Indeed! A Saul among the prophets. I shall not be surprised, however; it is my
                     usual fate to be hated. And now, as we seem to have drifted into disagreeable
                     and personal sort of talk, suppose we change the subject? There is a dory
                     yonder; if your indolent sultanship can bear the labor of steering, I'll give
                     you a last row across the bay."</p>
                  <p>They take the dory and glide away. Charley lies back, his hat pulled over his
                     eyes, smoking a cigar and steering. She has the oars, the red sunlight is on
                     her face. Edith defies tan and sunburn. She looks at lazy Charley, and sings as
                     she pulls, a saucy smile of defiance on her lips: <q>

                           <l>"It was on a Monday morning,</l>

                           <l>That Charley came to our town,</l>

                  </p>
                  <p>What Charley answers is not on record. Perhaps the aged millionnaire, who is to
                     be the future happy possessor of Miss Darrell's charms, would not care to hear
                     it. They drift on—they are together—they ask no more. The rosy after-glow of
                     the sunset fades out, the night comes white with stars, the faint spring wind
                     sighs over the bay, and both are silent. "And," says Charley's inner
                     consciousness, "if this be not falling in love, I wonder what is?"</p>
                  <p>They linger yet longer. It is the last night, and romantically enough, for so
                     worldly and cynical a pair, they watch the faint little April moon rise. Edith
                     looks over her left shoulder at it, and says something under her breath.</p>
                  <p>"What invocation are you murmuring there?" Charley asks, half asleep.</p>
                  <p>"I was wishing. I always wish when I see the new moon."</p>
                  <p>"For a rich husband of course, Edie!" He sits up suddenly. "There's the
                     baronet! Suppose you go for <emph>him</emph>."</p>
                  <p>"'Go for him!" What a horribly vulgar way you have of speaking. No. I'll leave
                     him for Trixy. Have you had enough of starlight and moonlight, Mr. Stuart, on
                     Sandypoint Bay, because I'm going to turn and row home. I've<pb n="134-135"
                        xml:id="VAC6448-00000067"/> had no supper, and I shall eat you if we stay
                     here fasting much longer."</p>
                  <p>She rows back, and arm in arm they ascend the rocky path, and linger one last
                     moment at the garden gate.</p>
                  <p>"So ends the old life," Edith says, softly. "It is my last night at home. I
                     ought to feel sad, I suppose, but I don't. I never felt so happy in my
                     life."</p>
                  <p>He is holding her hand. For two who are not lovers, and never mean to be, they
                     understand each other wonderfully well.</p>
                  <p>"And remember your promise," he answers. "Let the life that is coming bring
                     what it may, you are never to blame me."</p>
                  <p>Then Mrs. Darrell's tall, spare figure appears in the moonlight, summoning them
                     sharply to tea, and hands are unclasped, and in silence they follow her.</p>
                  <p>The first train from Sandypoint to Boston bears away Edith Darrell and Charley
                     Stuart. Not alone together, however—forbid it Mrs. Grundy! Mrs. Rogers, the
                     Sandypoint milliner, is going to New York for the summer fashions, and the
                     young lady travels under her protection. They reach Boston in time for the
                     train that connects with the Fall River boats. It has been a day of brightest
                     sunshine; it is a lovely spring night. They dine on board. Mrs. Rogers is
                     sleepy and tired and goes to bed (she and Edith share the same state-room),
                     with a last charge to Mr. Stuart not to keep Miss Darrell too long on deck in
                     the night air.</p>
                  <p>They float grandly up the bright river. Two wandering harpists and a violinist
                     play very sweetly near them, and they walk up and down, talking and feeling
                     uncommonly happy and free, until Charley's watch points to eleven, and the
                     music comes to a stop. They say good-night. She goes to Mrs. Rogers and the
                     upper berth, and Mr. Stuart meditatively turns to his own. He is thinking, that
                     all things considered, it is just as well this particularly fascinating
                     companionship, ends in a manner to-morrow.</p>
                  <p>To-morrow comes. It is Miss Beatrix Stuart's birthday. The great party is to be
                     to-night. They shake hands and part with Mrs. Rogers on the pier. Charley hails
                     a hack and assists his cousin in, and they are whirled off to the palatial
                     avenue up-town.</p>
                  <p>The house is a stately brown-stone front, of course, and on a sunny corner.
                     Edith leans back, quite silent, her heart beating as she looks. The whirl, the
                     crash, the rush of New York streets stun her, the stateliness of the Stuart
                     mansion awes her. She is very pale, her lips are set together. She turns to
                     Charley suddenly, and holds out her hands to him as a helpless child might.</p>
                  <p>"I feel lost already, and—and ever so little afraid. How big and grand it
                     looks. Don't desert me, Charley. I feel as though I were astray in a strange
                     land."</p>
                  <p>He squeezes the little hand, he whispers something reassuring, and life and
                     color come back to her face.</p>
                  <p>"Make your mind easy, Dithy," is what he says. "Like Mrs. Micawber, "I'll never
                     desert you.'"</p>
                  <p>He rings the door bell sharply, a smart-looking young woman admits them, and
                     Edith goes with him into a splendid and spacious apartment, where three people
                     sit at breakfast. Perhaps it is the garish sunshine, sparkling on so much cut
                     glass and silver, that dazzles Edith's eyes, but for a minute she can see
                     nothing. Then the mist clears away, the trio have risen—a pompous-looking old
                     gentleman in a shining bald head and expansive white vest, a pallid,
                     feeble-looking elderly lady in a lace cap, and a tall, stylish girl, with
                     Charley's eyes and hair, in violet ribbons and white cashmere. The bald
                     gentlemen shakes hands with her, and welcomes her in a husky baritone; the
                     faded, elderly lady, and stylish young lady kiss her, and say some very
                     pleasant and gracious words. As in a dream Edith sees and hears all—as in a
                     dream she is led off by Beatrix.</p>
                  <p>"I shall take you to your room myself. I only hope you may like it. The
                     furniture and arrangement are my taste, every bit. Oh you dear darling!" cries
                     Miss Stuart, stopping in the passage to give Edith a hug. "You don't know how
                     frightened I've been that you wouldn't come. I'm in love with you already! And
                     what a heroine you are—a real Grace—what's-her-name—saving Charley's life and
                     all that. And best of all, you're in time for the ball—which is a rhyme, though
                     I didn't mean it." She laughs and suddenly gives Edith another hug. "You pretty
                     creature!" she says; "I'd no idea you were half so good-looking. I asked<pb
                        n="136-137" xml:id="VAC6448-00000068"/> Charley, but you might as well ask a
                     lamp-post as Charley. Here is your room—how do you like it?"</p>
                  <p>She would have been difficult to please indeed, if she had not liked it. To
                     Edith's inexperienced eyes, it is a glowing nest of amber silk curtains,
                     yellowish Brussells carpet, tinted walls, pretty pictures, gilt frames,
                     mirrors, ornaments, and dainty French bed.</p>
                  <p>"Do you like it? But I see by your face you do. I'm so glad. This is my room
                     adjoining, and here's your bath. Now lay off your things and come down to
                     breakfast."</p>
                  <p>Still in a dream Edith obeys. She descends to breakfast in her gray travelling
                     suit, looking pale, and not at all brilliant. Miss Stuart, who has had her
                     doubts, that this country cousin may prove a rival, is reassured. She takes her
                     breakfast, and then Beatrix conducts her over the house—a wonder of splendor,
                     of velvet carpets, magnificent upholstering, lace drapings, gilding and ormolu.
                     But her face keeps its pale, grave look. Trixy wonders if she is not a stupid
                     little body after all. Last of all they reach the sacred privacy of Trixy's own
                     room, and there she displays her ball dress. She expiates on its make and its
                     merits, in professional language, and with a volubility that makes Edith's head
                     swim.</p>
                  <p>"It is made with a court train, trimmed with a deep flounce, waved in the lower
                     edge, and this flounce is trimmed with four narrow flounces, edged with narrow
                     point lace. The sides are <foreign xml:lang="FRA">en revers</foreign>, with
                     sashes tied in butterfly bow in the centre of the back, below the puffing of
                     the skirt near the waist. The front of the skirt is trimmed to correspond with
                     the train, the short apron, flounced and trimmed with point lace, gathered up
                     at the sides, under the <foreign xml:lang="FRA">revers</foreign> on the train.
                     The waist is high in the shoulders, V shaped in front and back, with small
                     flowing sleeves, finished with plaitings of white silk tulle. And now," cries
                     Trixy, breathless and triumphant, "if <emph>that</emph> doesn't fetch the
                     baronet, you may tell me what will! The pearls are superb—here they are. Pearls
                     are <foreign xml:lang="FRA">en regle</foreign> for weddings only, but how was
                     poor pa to know that? Arn't they lovely?"</p>
                  <p>They lie in their cloudy luster, necklet, earrings, bracelet.</p>
                  <p>"Lovely!" Edith repeats; "lovely indeed. Beatrix, what a fortunate girl you
                     are."</p>
                  <p>There is a touch of envy in her tone. Beatrix laughs, and gives her a third
                     hug.</p>
                  <p>"Why? Because I have pearls? Bless you! they're nothing. You'll have diamonds
                     beyond counting yourself, one of those days. You'll marry rich, of
                     course—brunettes are all the style now, and you're sure to look lovely by
                     gaslight. What are you going to wear to-night?"</p>
                  <p>"I'm like Flora McFlimsey," Edith laughs; "I have nothing to wear. There is a
                     white Swiss muslin in my trunk, but it will look wofully rustic and dowdy, I'm
                     afraid, in your gorgeous drawing-rooms."</p>
                  <p>"Nonsense! Plain Swiss is always in taste for girls of eighteen. I wore it
                     greatly my first season. Do you know I feel awfully old, Edith—twenty-one
                     to-night! I <emph>must</emph> do something toward settling before the year
                     ends. Let us see the white Swiss. Now there is a lovely amber tissue I have—it
                     isn't my color. I never wore it but once, and it would suit you exactly. Lucy,
                     my maid, is a perfect dress-maker, and could alter it to fit you easily
                     before—Now, Edith! you're not angry?"</p>
                  <p>For the color has risen suddenly all over Edith's proud, pale face.</p>
                  <p>"You have made a mistake, Miss Stuart, that is all—meant kindly, I am sure. If
                     my white muslin is admissible, I will wear it; if not, I can keep to my room.
                     But neither now, nor at any future time, can I accept—charity."</p>
                  <p>Trixy gives a little shriek at the word, and inflicts a fourth hug on Edith.
                     She is the soul of easy good-nature herself, and ready to take anything and
                     everything that is offered her, from a husband to a bouquet.</p>
                  <p>"Bless the child!" she exclaims. "Charity! As if any one ever thought of such a
                     thing. It's just like me, however, to make a mess of it. I mean well, but
                     somehow I always <emph>do</emph> make a mess of it. And my prophetic soul tells
                     me, the case of Sir Victor Catheron will be no exception to the rest."</p>
                  <p>The day wears on. Edith drives down town, shopping with Madame and Mademoiselle
                     Stuart; she returns, and dines in state with the family. The big, brown house
                     is lit up from basement to attic, and presently they all adjourn to their rooms
                     to dress.</p>
                  <pb n="138-139" xml:id="VAC6448-00000069"/>
                  <p>"Don't ask me to appear while you are receiving your guests," Edith says. "I'll
                     step in unobserved, when everybody has come."</p>
                  <p>She declines all offers of assistance, and dresses herself. It is a simple
                     toilet surely—the crisp white muslin, out of which the polished shoulders rise;
                     a little gold chain and cross, once her mother's; earrings and bracelet of gold
                     and coral, also once her mother's; and her rich, abundant, blackish-brown hair,
                     gathered back in a graceful way peculiar to herself. She looks very pretty, and
                     she knows it. Presently sails in Miss Stuart, resplendent in the pink silk and
                     pearls, the "court train" trailing two or three yards behind her, her light
                     hair "done up" in a pyramid wonderful to behold, and loaded with camelias.</p>
                  <p>"How do I look, Dithy? This strawberry-ice pink is awfully becoming to me,
                     isn't it? And you—why, you look lovely—lovely! I'd no idea you made up so
                     handsomely. Ah! we blondes have no chance by gaslight, against you
                     brunettes."</p>
                  <p>She sweeps downstairs in her rose-colored splendor, and Edith is alone. She
                     sits by the open window, and looks out at the night life of the great city.
                     Carriage after carriage roll up to the door, and somehow, in the midst of all
                     this life, and brightness, and bustle, a strange feeling of loneliness and
                     isolation comes over her. Is it the old chronic discontent cropping up again?
                     If it were only not improper for Charley to come up here and sit beside her,
                     and smoke, in the sweet spring dusk, and be sarcastic as usual, what a comfort
                     it would be just now! Somehow—"how it comes let doctors tell"—that restless
                     familiar of hers is laid when <emph>he</emph> is by her side—never lonely,
                     never discontented then. As she thinks this, innocently enough, despite all her
                     worldly wisdom, there is a tap at the door, and Lucy, the maid, comes smilingly
                     in, holding an exquisite bouquet, all pink and white roses, in her hand.</p>
                  <p>"Mr. Charles' compliments, please, miss, and he's waiting for you at the foot
                     of the stairs, when you're ready, miss, for the ball-room."</p>
                  <p>She starts and colors with pleasure.</p>
                  <p>"Thank you, Lucy!" she says, taking the bouquet. "Tell Mr. Stuart I will be
                     down in a moment."</p>
                  <p>The girl leaves the room.</p>
                  <p>With a smile on her face it is just as well "Mr. Charles" does not see, she
                     stands looking at her roses; then she buries her face, almost as bright, in
                     their dewy sweetness.</p>
                  <p>"Dear, thoughtful Charley!" she whispers gratefully. "What would ever have
                     become of me but for him?"</p>
                  <p>She selects one or two bits of scarlet blossom and green spray, and
                     artistically twists them in the rich waves of her hair. She takes one last
                     glance at her own pretty image in the mirror, sees that fan, lace-handkerchief,
                     and adornment generally, are in their places, and then trips away and goes
                     down.</p>
                  <p>In elegant evening costume, looking unutterably handsome and well-dressed, Mr.
                     Charles Stuart stands at the foot of the grand stairway, waiting. He looks at
                     her as she stands in the full glare of the gasaliers.</p>
                  <p>"White muslin, gold and coral, pink roses, and no chignon. My dear Miss
                     Darrell, taking you as a whole, I think I have seen worse-looking young women
                     in my life."</p>
                  <p>He draws her hand through his arm, with this enthusiastic remark, and Edith
                     finds herself in a blaze of light and a crowd of brilliantly dressed people.
                     Three long drawing-rooms are thrown open, <foreign xml:lang="FRA">en
                        suite</foreign>; beyond is the ball-room, with its waxed floors and
                     invisible musicians. Flowers, gaslight, jewels, handsome women, and gallant men
                     are everywhere; the band is crashing out a pulse-tingling waltz, and still
                     Edith hears and sees, and moves in a dream.</p>
                  <p>"Come," Charley says. His arm is around her waist, and they whirl away among
                     the waltzers. Edith waltzes well, so does Charley. She feels as though she were
                     floating on air, not on earth. Then it is over, and she is being introduced to
                     people, to resplendent young ladies and almost equally resplendent young
                     gentlemen. Charley resigns her to one of these latter, and she glides through a
                     mazurka. That too ends, and as it grows rather warm, her partner leads her away
                     to a cool music-room, whence proceed melodious sounds. It is Trixy at the
                     piano, informing a select audience in shrill soprano, and in the character of
                     the "Queen of the May," that "She had been wild and wayward, but she was not
                     wayward <emph>now</emph>." Edith's partner<pb n="140-141"
                        xml:id="VAC6448-00000070"/> finds her a seat and volunteers to go for an
                     ice. As she sits fanning herself, she sees Charley approaching with a young man
                     of about his own age, taller than he is—fairer, with a look altogether somehow
                     of a different nationality. He has large blue eyes, very fair hair, and the
                     blondest of complexions. Instinctively she knows who it is.</p>
                  <p>"Ah, Edith," Charley says, "here you are. I have been searching for you. Miss
                     Darrell, allow me to present to you Sir Victor Catheron."</p>
               </div>
               <div type="chapter">
                  <head>CHAPTER IV.</head>
                  <head type="sub">"UNDER THE GASLIGHT."</head>
                  <p>TWO darkly solemn eyes look up into Sir Victor Catheron's face. Both bow. Both
                     murmur the <foreign xml:lang="ITA">pianissimo</foreign> imbecility requisite on
                     such occasions, and Edith Darrell is acquainted with a baronet.</p>
                  <p>With a baronet! Only yesterday, as it were, she was darning hose, and ironing
                     linen at home, going about the dismal house slipshod and slatternly. Now she is
                     in the midst of a brilliant ball, diamonds sparkling around her, and an English
                     baronet of fabulous wealth and ancestry asking her for the favor of the next
                     waltz! Something ridiculous and absurd about it all, struck her; she felt an
                     idiotic desire to laugh aloud. It was all unreal, all a dream. She would awake
                     presently, to hear her step-mother's shrill call to come and help in the
                     kitchen, and the howls of the juvenile Darrells down the passage. A familiar
                     voice rouses her.</p>
                  <p>"You'll not forget, I hope, Edith," Charley is saying, "that next redowa is
                     mine. At present I am going to meander through the lancers with Mrs.
                     Featherbrain."</p>
                  <p>He takes her tablets, coolly writes his name, smiles, shows his white teeth,
                     says "Au revoir," and is gone. She and the baronet are alone.</p>
                  <p>What shall she say to him? She feels a whimsical sort of trepidation as she
                     flutters her fan. As yet the small-talk of society, is Sanscrit, to this young
                     lady from Sandypoint. Sir Victor leans lightly against the arm of her chair,
                     and looks down upon her as she sits, with flushed cheeks, half smiling lips,
                     and long black lashes drooping. He is thinking what a wonderfully bright and
                     charming face it is—for a brunette.</p>
                  <p>For Sir Victor Catheron does not fancy brunettes. He has his ideal, and sees in
                     her the future Lady Catheron. In far-off Cheshire there is a certain Lady
                     Gwendoline; she is an earl's daughter, the owner of two soft blue eyes, a
                     complexion of pink and snow, a soft, trained voice and feathery halo of amber
                     hair. Lady Gwendoline is his ideal of fair, sweet womanhood, turning coldly
                     from all the rest of the world to hold out her arms to one happy possessor. The
                     vision of Lady Gwendoline as he saw her last, the morning sunshine searching
                     her fair English face and finding no flaw in it, rises for a second before
                     him—why, he does not know. Then a triumphal burst of music crashes out, and he
                     is looking down once more upon Edith Darrell, in her white dress and coral
                     ornaments, her dark hair and pink roses.</p>
                  <p>"You seem quite like an old acquaintance, Miss Darrell," he says, in his slow,
                     pleasant, English accented voice; "our mutual friend, the prince, has told me
                     about his adventure in the snow, and your heroism."</p>
                  <p>"The prince?" she repeats, interrogatively, and Sir Victor laughs.</p>
                  <p>"Ah! you don't know. They call him the prince here—Prince Charlie. I don't know
                     why, I'm sure, unless it be that his name is Charles Edward Stuart, and that he
                     is the prince of good fellows. You have no idea how delighted I am that he—that
                     the whole family are going across with us in May. You accompany them, I
                     understand, Miss Darrell?"</p>
                  <p>"As companion and interpreter on the continent," Miss Darrell answers, looking
                     up at him very steadily. "Yes."</p>
                  <p>"And you will like the continent, I know," Sir Victor goes on. "You will like
                     Paris, of course. All Americans go to Paris. You will meet scores of your
                     countrymen in every continental city."</p>
                  <p>"I am not sure that <emph>that</emph> is an advantage," responds the young lady
                     coolly. "About my liking it, there can be no<pb n="142-143"
                        xml:id="VAC6448-00000071"/> question. It has been the dream of my life—a
                     dream I thought as likely to be realized a month ago, as that I should take a
                     trip to the moon. For you, Sir Victor, I suppose every nook and corner of
                     Europe, is as familiar to you, as your own native Cheshire?"</p>
                  <p>The brown brilliant eyes look up at him frankly. She is at her ease at last,
                     and Sir Victor thinks again, what beautiful eyes, brown eyes are. For a dark
                     young person, she is really the most attractive young person, he has ever
                     met.</p>
                  <p>"Cheshire," he repeats with a smile, "how well you know my birthplace. No, not
                     my birthplace exactly, for I was born in London. I'm a cockney, Miss Darrell.
                     Before you all go abroad, you are to come and spend a week or two down in my
                     sunny Cheshire; both my aunt and I insist upon it. You don't know how many
                     kindnesses—how many pleasant days and nights we owe to our friends, the
                     Stuarts. It shall be our endeavor when we reach England to repay them in kind.
                     May I ask, Miss Darrell, if you have met my aunt?"</p>
                  <p>"No," Edith replies, fluttering a little again. "I have not even seen Lady
                     Helena as yet."</p>
                  <p>"Then allow me the pleasure of making you acquainted. I think you will like
                     her. I am very sure she will like you."</p>
                  <p>The color deepens on Edith's dark cheek; she arises and takes his proffered
                     arm. How gracefully deferential and courteous he is. It is all custom, no
                     doubt, and means nothing, but it is wonderfully pleasant and flattering. For
                     the moment it seems as though he were conscious of no other young lady in the
                     scheme of creation than Miss Darrell—a flirting way a few young men
                     cultivate.</p>
                  <p>They walk slowly down the long brilliant rooms, and many eyes turn and look
                     after them. Every one knows the extremly blonde young baronet—the dark damsel
                     on his arm is as yet a stranger to most of them. "Dused pretty girl, you know,"
                     is the unanimous verdict of masculine New York; "who is she?" "Who
                        <emph>is</emph> that young lady in the dowdy white muslin and old fashioned
                     corals?" asks feminine New York, and both stare as they receive the same
                     whispered reply: "A poor relation—a country cousin, or something of the sort,
                     going to Europe with them as companion to Beatrix."</p>
                  <p>Edith sees the looks, and the color deepens to carnation in her face. Her brown
                     eyes gleam, she lifts her head with haughty grace, and flashes back almost
                     defiance at these insolent starers. She <emph>feels</emph> what it is they are
                     saying of her, and Sir Victor's high bred courtesy and deference, go to the
                     very depths of her heart by contrast. She likes him; he interests her already;
                     there is something in his face, she can hardly tell what,—a sort of sombre
                     shadow that underlies all his smiling society manner. In repose and solitude,
                     the prevailing expression of that face will be melancholy, and yet why? Surely
                     at three-and-twenty, life can have shown nothing but her sunshine and roses, to
                     this curled darling of fortune.</p>
                  <p>A stout, elderly lady, in gray moire and chantilly lace, sits on a sort of a
                     throne of honor, beside Mrs. Stuart, and a foreign gentleman, from Washington,
                     all ribbons and orders. To this stout, elderly lady, as Lady Helena Powyss, his
                     aunt, Sir Victor presents Miss Darrell.</p>
                  <p>The kindly eyes of the English lady turn upon the dark, handsome face of the
                     American girl; the pleasant voice says a few pleasant words. Miss Darrell bows
                     gracefully, lingers a few moments, is presented to the ribbon-and-starred
                     foreigner, and learns he is Russian Ambassador at Washington. Then the music of
                     their dance strikes up, both smilingly make their adieux, and hasten to the
                     ball-room.</p>
                  <p>Up and down the long waxed room, in and out with gorgeous young New York, in
                     all the hues of the rainbow, the air heavy with perfume, the matchless Gounod
                     waltz music crashing over all, on the arm of a baronet—worth, how much did
                     Trixy say? thirty or forty thousand a year?—around her slim white muslin waist.
                     Edith is in her dream still—she does not want to wake—Trixy whirls by, flushed
                     and breathless, and nods laughingly as she disappears. Charley, looking calm
                     and languid even in the dance, flits past, clasping gay little Mrs.
                     Featherbrain, and gives her a patronizing nod. And Edith's thought is—"If this
                     could only go on forever!" But the golden moments of life fly—the leaden ones
                     only lag—we all know that to our cost. The waltz ends.</p>
                  <p>"A most delicious waltz," says Sir Victor gayly. "I thought dancing bored me—I
                     find I like it. How well you waltz, Miss Darrell, like a Parisienne—but all
                     American young<pb n="144-145" xml:id="VAC6448-00000072"/> ladies are like
                     Frenchwomen. Take this seat, and let me fetch you a water ice."</p>
                  <p>He leads her to a chair and departs. As she sits there, half smiling and
                     fluttering her fan, looking very lovely, Charley saunters up with his late
                     partner. "If your royal highness will permit," cries Mrs. Featherbrain,
                     laughing and panting, "I will take a seat. How cool and comfortable you look,
                     Miss Darrell. May I ask what you have done with Sir Victor?"</p>
                  <p>"Sir Victor left me here, and told me he would go for a water ice. If I look
                     cool, it is more than I feel—the thermometer of this room must stand at a
                     hundred in the shade."</p>
                  <p>"A water ice," repeats Mrs. Featherbrain with a sigh; "just what I have been
                     longing for, this past half hour. Charley, I heard <emph>you</emph> say
                     something about bringing me one, some time ago, didn't I? But I know of old
                     what you're promises are worth. You know the adage, Miss Darrell—never more
                     true than in this instance, 'Put not your trust in princes.'"</p>
                  <p>Miss Darrell's dark, disdainful eyes look full at the frivolous young matron.
                     Mrs. Featherbrain and Mr. Stuart have been devoted to each other all the
                     evening.</p>
                  <p>"I know the adage," she answers cooly, "but I confess I don't see the
                     application."</p>
                  <p>"What! don't you know Charley's sobriquet of Prince Charley? Why he has been
                     the Prince ever since he was five years old, partly on account of his absurd
                     name, partly because of his absurd grand seigneur airs. I think it fits—don't
                     you?"</p>
                  <p>"And if I were Prince," Charley interposes, before Miss Darrell can answer, "my
                     first royal act would be to order Featherbrain to the deepest dungeon beneath
                     the castle moat, and make his charming relict Princess consort, as she has
                     long, alas! been queen of my affections!"</p>
                  <p>He lays his white-kidded hand on the region of his heart, and bows profoundly.
                     Mrs. Featherbrain's shrill, rather silly laugh, rings out—she hits him a blow
                     with her perfumed fan.</p>
                  <p>"You precocious little boy!" she says, "as if children of your age knew what
                     their affections meant. Miss Darrell, you'll not credit it I'm sure, but this
                     juvenile cousin of yours—Charley, you told me, Miss Darrell, was your
                     cousin—was my first love—actually—my first!"</p>
                  <p>"And she jilted me in cold blood for Featherbrain. Since then I've been a
                     blighted being—hiding, like the Spartan chap in the story, the fox that preys
                     on my vitals, and going through life with the hollow mockery of a smile on my
                     lips."</p>
                  <p>Again Mrs. Featherbrain's foolish little laugh peals out. She leans back,
                     almost against him, looks up, and half whispers something very daring in
                     French.</p>
                  <p>Edith turns away disgusted, gleams of disdainful scorn in her shining hazel
                     eyes. What a little painted giggling idiot the woman is—what fools most young
                     men are! What business have married women flirting, and how much more sensible
                     and agreeable Englishmen are than Americans.</p>
                  <p>"Miss Darrell looks sick of our frivolity," Mrs. Featherbrain gayly exclaims;
                     "the wickedness of New York and the falsity of mankind, are new to her as yet.
                     You saved Charley's life, didn't you, my love? Trixy told me all about it,—and
                     remained with him all night in the snow, at the risk of your own life. Quite a
                     romance, upon my word. Now why not end it, like all romances of the kind, in a
                     love match and a marriage?"</p>
                  <p>Her eyes glitter maliciously and jealously, even while she laughs. If it is in
                     the shallow heart of this prettily-painted, prettily-powdered woman, to care
                     for any human being, she has cared for Charley Stuart.</p>
                  <p>"Mrs. Featherbrain!" Edith exclaims, in haughty surprise, half rising.</p>
                  <p>"My dear, don't be angry—you <emph>might</emph> do worse, though how, it would
                     be difficult to say. I suggested it, because it is the usual ending of such
                     things in novels, and on the stage—that is all."</p>
                  <p>"And as if I <emph>could</emph> fall in love with any one now," Mr. Stuart
                     murmurs, plaintively. "Such a suggestion from you, Laura, is adding insult to
                     injury."</p>
                  <p>"Here comes our baronet," Mrs. Featherbrain exclaims, "bearing a water ice in
                     his own aristocratic hand. Rather handsome, isn't he?—only I detest very fair
                     men. What a<pb n="146-147" xml:id="VAC6448-00000073"/> pity, for the peace of
                     mind of our New York girls, he should be engaged in England."</p>
                  <p>"Ah! but he isn't engaged—I happen to know," said Charley; "so you see what
                     comes of marrying in haste, Mrs. Featherbrain. If you had only waited another
                     year now, instead of throwing me over for old Featherbrain, it might have been
                     for a baronet—for of course there isn't a girl in New York could stand the
                     ghost of a chance beside <emph>you</emph>."</p>
                  <p>"A most delicate compliment," Edith says, her scornful lip curling; "one hardly
                     knows which to admire most—the refined tact of Mr. Stuart's flatteries, or the
                     matronly dignity with which Mrs. Featherbrain repels them!"</p>
                  <p>She turns her white shoulder deliberately upon them both, and welcomes Sir
                     Victor with her brightest smile.</p>
                  <p>"And for a rustic lassie, fresh from the fields and the daisies, it isn't so
                     bad," is Mrs. Featherbrain's cool criticism.</p>
                  <p>"And I hope, despite Sir Victor's aristocratic attentions, Miss Darrell, you'll
                     not forget you're engaged to <emph>me</emph> for the redowa," Charley finds a
                     chance to murmur, <foreign xml:lang="ITA">sotto voce</foreign>, in her ear, as
                     he and his flirtee move on:</p>
                  <p>"You see the poor child's jealous, Charley," is the Featherbrain's last
                     remark—"a victim to the green-eyed monster in his most virulent form. You
                     really should be careful, my dear boy, how you use the charms a beneficent
                     Providence has showered upon you. As you are strong, be merciful, and all that
                     sort of thing."</p>
                  <p>The hours go on. Edith eats her water ice, and talks very animatedly to her
                     baronet. Balls (he has had a surfeit of them, poor fellow!) mostly bore
                     him—to-night he is really interested. The Americans are an interesting people,
                     he thinks that must be why. Then the redowa begins, and Charley returns and
                     carries her off. With him she is coldly silent, her eyes are averted, her words
                     are few. He smiles to himself, and asks her this pleasant question:</p>
                  <p>"If she <choice>
                        <sic>dosen't</sic>
                        <corr>doesn't</corr>
                     </choice> think Laura Featherbrain the prettiest and best-dressed lady in the
                     room?"</p>
                  <p>"I think Mrs. Featherbrain is well-named," Miss Darrell answers, her dark eyes
                     flashing. "I understand Mr. Featherbrain is lying sick at home. You introduced
                     me to her—while I live in this house, Mr. Stuart, you will be kind enough to
                     introduce me to no more—Mrs. Featherbrains!"</p>
                  <p>She brings out the obnoxious name with stinging scorn, and a look toward the
                     lady bearing it sharper than daggers. There is a curious smile in Charley's
                     eyes—his lips are grave.</p>
                  <p>"Are you angry, Edith? Do you know—of course you do, though—that it becomes you
                     to be angry? My charming cousin, I never knew until to-night how really
                     handsome you were."</p>
                  <p>She disengages herself with sudden abruptness from his clasp.</p>
                  <p>"I am tired of dancing," she says. "I detest redowas. And be kind enough to
                     keep your odious point-blank compliments for the 'prettiest and best-dressed
                     lady in the room.' <emph>I</emph> don't appreciate them!"</p>
                  <p>Is it jealousy? Charley wonders, complacently. He sits down beside her, and
                     tries to coax her into good humor, but she is not to be coaxed. In ten minutes
                     another partner comes up and claims her, and she goes. The pretty, dark girl in
                     white, is greatly admired, and has no lack of partners. For Mr. Stuart he
                     dances no more—he leans against a <choice>
                        <sic>piller</sic>
                        <corr>pillar</corr>
                     </choice>, pulls his mustache, and looks placid and handsome. He isn't devoted
                     to dancing, as a rule he objects to it on principle, as so much physical
                     exertion for very little result; he has only fatigued himself to-night as a
                     matter of abstract duty. He stands and watches Edith dance—this country girl
                     has the lithe, willowy grace of a Bayadere, and she is laughing now, and
                     looking very bright and animated. It dawns upon him, that she is by all odds
                     the prettiest girl in the house, and that slowly but surely, for the
                     hundred-and-fiftieth time in his life, he is falling in love.</p>
                  <p>"But I might have known it," Mr. Stuart thinks, gravely; "brown beauties always
                        <emph>did</emph> play the dickens with me. I thought that at five-and-twenty
                     I had outgrown all that sort of youthful rubbish, and here I am on the brink of
                     the pit again. Falling in love in the present, involves matrimony in the
                     future, and matrimony has been the horror of my life since I was four years
                     old. And then the governor wouldn't hear of it. I'm to be handed over to the
                     first 'daughter of<pb n="148-149" xml:id="VAC6448-00000074"/> a hundred earls'
                     across in England, who is willing to exchange a tarnished British coronet for a
                     Yankee million or two of dollars."</p>
                  <p>It is Trixy who is dancing with the baronet now—Trixy who descends to supper on
                     the baronet's arm. She dances with him once again after supper; then he returns
                     to Edith.</p>
                  <p>So the hours go on, and the April morning is growing gray. Once, Edith finds
                     herself seated beside genial Lady Helena, who talks to her in a motherly way,
                     that takes all her heart captive at once. Sir Victor leans over his aunt's
                     chair, listening with a smile, and not saying much himself. His aunt's eyes
                     follow him everywhere, her voice takes a deeper tenderness when she speaks to
                     him. It is easy to see she loves him with almost more than a mother's love.</p>
                  <p>A little longer and it is all over. Carriage after carriage rolls away—Sir
                     Victor and Lady Helena shake hands with this pretty, well-bred Miss Darrell,
                     and go too. She sees Charley linger to the last moment, by fascinating Mrs.
                     Featherbrain, whispering the usual inanity, in her pretty pink ear. He leads
                     her to her carriage, when it stops the way, and he and the millionnaire's wife
                     vanish in the outer darkness. <q>

                  <p>TWO waltzes," said Trix, counting on her fingers; "that's two; one cracovienne,
                     that's three; les lanciers, that's four; one galop, that's five; and one polka
                     quadrille, that's six. Six dances, round and square, with Sir Victor Catheron.
                     Edith," cried Miss Stuart, triumphantly, "<emph>do</emph> you hear that?"</p>
                  <p>"Yes, Trixy, I hear," said Edith, dreamily.</p>
                  <p>"You don't look as if you did, or if you do hear, you don't heed. Six
                     dances—two more I am certain, than he danced with any other girl in the house.
                     That looks promising, now doesn't it? Edith, the long and short of the matter
                     is this: I shall break my heart and die if he doesn't make me Lady
                     Catheron."</p>
                  <p>A faint, half-absent smile—no other reply from Miss Darrell. In the handsome
                     reception-room of the Stuart mansion, the two girls sat. It was half-past three
                     in the afternoon, of the day succeeding the ball. In the luxuriant depths of a
                     puffy arm-chair, reclined Edith Darrell, as much at home, as though puffy
                     chairs and luxuriant reclining, had ever been her normal state. The crimson
                     satin cushions, contrasted brilliantly with her dark eyes, hair and complexion.
                     Her black silk dress was new, and fitted well, and she had lit it up with a
                     knot of scarlet tangled in some white lace at the throat. Altogether she made a
                     very effective picture.</p>
                  <p>In another puffy rocking-chair near, sat Trixy, her chestnut hair <foreign
                        xml:lang="FRA">crêpe</foreign> to her eyebrows and falling in a crinkling
                     shower down to her waist. Her voluminous draperies balloon over the carpet for
                     the space of a couple of yards on either side, and she looked from top to toe
                     the "New Yorkiest of New York girls." They made a very nice contrast if you had
                     an eye for effect—blonde and brunette, dash and dignity, style and classic
                     simplicity, gorgeous furniture, and outside the gray, fast-drifting April
                     afternoon, the raw, easterly April wind.</p>
                  <p>"Of course," pursued Miss Stuart, going on with the web of rose-colored
                     knitting in her lap, "being the daughter of the house, and considering the
                     occasion, and everything, I suppose a few more dances than usual were expected
                     of him. Still, I <emph>don't</emph> believe he would have asked me six times
                     if—Edith! how often did he dance with you?"</p>
                  <p>"How often did—I beg your pardon, Beatrix; I didn't catch what you said."</p>
                  <p>"I see you didn't. You're half-asleep, arn't you? A penny for your thoughts,
                     Dithy."</p>
                  <p>"They're not worth a farthing," Edith answered, contemptuously. "I chanced just
                     then to be thinking of Mrs.<pb n="150-151" xml:id="VAC6448-00000075"/>
                     Featherbrain. What was it you asked—something about Sir Victor?"</p>
                  <p>"I asked how often Sir Victor danced with you last night."</p>
                  <p>"I really forget. Four times, I think—yes, four times. Why?"</p>
                  <p>"He danced six with me, and I'm sure he didn't dance more than half as often
                     with any one else. Mamma thinks he means something, and he took me to supper,
                     and told me about England. We had quite a long conversation; in fact, Edith, I
                     fairly grow crazy with delight at the thought of one day being 'My lady.'"</p>
                  <p>"Why think of it, then, since it sets you crazy?" Edith suggested, with cool
                     indifference. "I daresay you've heard the proverb, Trix, about counting your
                     chickens before they're hatched. However, in this case I don't really see why
                     you should despair. You're his equal in every way, and Sir Victor is his own
                     master, and can do as he likes."</p>
                  <p>"Ah, I don't know!" Trix answered with a despondent sigh, "he's a baronet, and
                     these English people go so much for birth and blood. Now you know we've
                     neither. It's all very well for pa to name Charley after a prince, and spell
                     Stuart, with a <hi rend="i"/>u instead of an <hi rend="i"/>ew, like everybody
                     else, and say he's descended from the royal family of Scotland—there's
                     something more wanted than <emph>that</emph>. He's sent to London, or
                     somewhere, for the family coat-of-arms. You may laugh, Edith, but he has, and
                     we're to seal our letters with a griffin <foreign xml:lang="FRA"
                        >rampant</foreign>, or a catamount <foreign xml:lang="FRA"
                        >couchant</foreign>, or some other beast of prey. Still the griffin rampant,
                     doesn't alter the fact, that pa began life sweeping out a grocery, or that he
                     was in the tallow business, until the breaking out of the rebellion. Lady
                     Helena and Sir Victor are everything that's nice, and civil, and courteous, but
                     when it comes to marrying, you know, that's quite another matter. Isn't he just
                     sweet, though, Edith?"</p>
                  <p>"Who? Sir Victor? Poor fellow, what has he ever said or done to you, Trix, to
                     deserve such an epithet as that? No, I am glad to say he didn't strike me as
                     being 'sweet'—contrariwise, I thought him particularly sensible and
                     pleasant."</p>
                  <p>"Well, can't a person be sweet and sensible too?" Trix answered, impatiently.
                     "Did you notice his eyes? Such an expression of weariness and sadness, and—now
                     what are you laughing at. I declare, you're as stupid as Charley. I can't
                     express a single opinion that he doesn't laugh at. Call me sentimental if you
                     like, but I say again he <emph>has</emph> the most melancholy expression I ever
                     looked at. Do you know, Dithy, I love melancholy men."</p>
                  <p>"Do you?" said Edith, still laughing. "My dear lackadaisical Trixy! I must
                     confess myself, I prefer 'jolly' people. Still you're not altogether wrong
                     about our youthful baronet, he <emph>does</emph> look a prey at times to green
                     and yellow melancholy. You don't suppose he has been crossed in love, do you?
                     Are baronets—rich baronets—ever crossed in love I wonder. His large, rather
                     light blue eyes, look at one sometimes as though to say: <q>

                  <p>Miss Darrell was an actress by nature—she repeated this lachrymose verse, in a
                     sepulchral tone of voice.</p>
                  <p>"That's it, you may depend, Trixy. The poor young gentleman's a prey to
                     unrequited affection. What are you shaking your head so vehemently at?"</p>
                  <p>"It isn't that," said Trix, looking solemn and mysterious, "it's worse!"</p>
                  <p>"Worse! Dear me. I didn't think anything could be worse. What is it then?"</p>
                  <p>"<emph>Murder!</emph>"</p>
                  <p>It was Trixy's turn to be sepulchral. Miss Darrell opened her big brown eyes.
                     Miss Stuart's charnel-house tone was really blood curdling.</p>
                  <p>"My dearest Trix! Murder! Good gracious, you can't mean to say we've been
                     dancing all night with a murderer? Who has he killed?"</p>
                  <p>"Edith, don't be an idiot! Did I say he killed any one? No, it isn't that—it's
                     a murder that was committed when he was a baby."</p>
                  <p>"When he was a baby!" Miss Darrell repeats, in dense bewilderment.</p>
                  <pb n="152-153" xml:id="VAC6448-00000076"/>
                  <p>"Yes, his mother was murdered, poor thing. It was a most shocking affair, and
                     as interesting as any novel you ever read," said Trixy, with the greatest
                     relish. "Murdered in cold blood as she slept, and they don't know to this day
                     who did it."</p>
                  <p>Edith's eyes were still very wide open.</p>
                  <p>"His mother—when he was a baby! Tell us about it, Trix. One naturally takes an
                     interest in the family murders of one's future second cousin-in-law."</p>
                  <p>"Well," began Miss Stuart, still with the utmost relish, "you see his
                     father—another Sir Victor—made a low marriage—married the daughter of a common
                     sort of person, in trade. Now there's a coincidence to begin with.
                        <emph>I'm</emph> the daughter of a common sort of person in trade—at least I
                     was!"</p>
                  <p>"It is to be hoped the coincidence will not be followed out after the nuptial
                     knot," answered Edith, gravely, "it would be unpleasant for you to be murdered,
                     Trix, and plunge us all into the depth of despair and bombazine. Proceed, as
                     they say on the stage, 'Your tale interests me.'"</p>
                  <p>"He was engaged—the other Sir Victor, I mean—to his cousin, a Miss Inez
                     Catheron—pretty name, isn't it?—and, it seems, was afraid of her. She was a
                     brunette, dark and fierce, with black eyes and a temper to match."</p>
                  <p>A bow of acknowledgment from Miss Darrell.</p>
                  <p>"As it turned out, he had good reason to be afraid of her. He was a year and a
                     half married, and the baby—this present Sir Victor—was two or three months old,
                     when the marriage was made public, and wife and child brought home. There must
                     have been an awful row, you know, at Catheron Royals, and one evening, about a
                     month after her arrival, they found the poor thing asleep in the nursery, and
                     stabbed to the heart."</p>
                  <p>"Was she asleep after she was stabbed or before?"</p>
                  <p>"Bother. There was an inquest, and it turned out that she and Miss Catheron had
                     had a tremendous quarrel, that very evening. Sir Victor was away when it
                     happened, and he just went stark, staring mad the first thing, when he heard
                     it. Miss Catheron was arrested on suspicion. Then it appeared that she had a
                     brother, and that this brother was an awful scamp, and that he claimed to have
                     been married to Lady Catheron before she married Sir Victor, and that
                        <emph>he</emph> had had a row with her, that same day too. It was a
                     dreadfully mixed up affair—all that seemed clear, was that Lady Catheron had
                     been murdered by somebody, and that Juan—yes, Juan Catheron—had run away, and
                     when wanted, was not to be found."</p>
                  <p>"It appears to have been a strictly family affair from first to last—that, at
                     least, was a consolation. What did they do to Miss Inez Catheron?"</p>
                  <p>"Put her in prison to stand her trial for murder. She never stood it,
                     however—she made her escape, and never was heard of, from that day to this.
                     Isn't it tragical, and isn't it dreadful for Sir Victor—his mother murdered,
                     his father crazy, or dead, ages ago for what I know, and his relations tried
                     for their lives?"</p>
                  <p>"Poor Sir Victor! Dreadful indeed. But where in the world, Trixy, did
                        <emph>you</emph> find all this out? Has he been pouring the family history
                     so soon into your sympathetic ear?"</p>
                  <p>"Of course not; that's the curious part of the story. You know Mrs.
                     Featherbrain?"</p>
                  <p>"I'm happy to say," retorted Miss Darrell, "I know very little about her, and
                     intend to know less."</p>
                  <p>"You do know her, however. Well, Mrs. Featherbrain has a father."</p>
                  <p>"Poor old gentleman!" says Miss Darrell, compassionately.</p>
                  <p>"Old Hampson—that's his name. Hampson is an Englishman, and from Cheshire, and
                     knew the present Sir Victor's grandfather. He gets the Cheshire papers ever
                     since he left, and, of course, took an interest in all this. He told Mrs.
                     Featherbrain—and what do you think?—Mrs. Featherbrain actually asked Lady
                     Helena."</p>
                  <p>"It is precisely the sort of thing Mrs. Featherbrain would be likely to do.
                     'Fools rush in where angels fear to tread.' How copious are my quotations this
                     afternoon. What did Lady Helena say?"</p>
                  <p>"Gave her a look—a lady who was present told me—such a look. She turned dead
                     white for a minute, then she spoke: 'I never discuss family matters with
                     perfect strangers.' Those were her words—'<emph>perfect strangers</emph>.' 'I
                     consider your question impertinent, madame, and decline to<pb n="154-155"
                        xml:id="VAC6448-00000077"/> answer it.' Then she turned her back upon Mrs.
                     Featherbrain; and shouldn't I like to have seen Mrs. Featherbrain's face. Since
                     then, she just bows frigidly to her, no more."</p>
                  <p>"Little imbecile! Trixy, I should like to see those papers."</p>
                  <p>"So you can—I have them. Charley got them from Laura Featherbrain. What could
                        <emph>not</emph> Charley get from Laura Featherbrain I wonder?" adds Trix,
                     sarcastically.</p>
                  <p>Edith's color rose, her eyes fell on the tatting between her fingers.</p>
                  <p>"Your brother and the lady are old lovers then? So I inferred from her
                     conversation last night."</p>
                  <p>"I don't know about their being lovers exactly. Charley has that ridiculous
                     flirting manner, young men think it their duty to cultivate, and it certainly
                        <emph>was</emph> a strong case of spoons—excuse the slang. Pa would never
                     have listened to it, though—<emph>he</emph> wants birth and blood too, and old
                     Hampson's a pork merchant. Then Phineas Featherbrain came along, sixty years of
                     age, and a petroleum prince. Of course, there was a gorgeous wedding—New York
                     rang with it. I don't see that the marriage makes much difference in Charley
                     and Laura's flirtation, though. Just wait a minute and I'll go and get the
                     papers—I haven't read it all myself."</p>
                  <p>Miss Stuart swept, stately and tall, from the room, returning in a few moments
                     with some half-dozen old, yellow newspapers.</p>
                  <p>"Here you are, sir," she cries, in shrill newsboy singsong; "the full, true and
                     particular account of the tragedy at Catheron Royals. Sounds like the title of
                     a sensation novel, doesn't it? Here's No. 1 for you—I've got on as far as No.
                     4."</p>
                  <p>Miss Darrell throws aside her work and becomes absorbed in the <title>Chesholm
                        Courier</title> of twenty-three years back. Silence fell—the moments wore
                     on—the girls become intensely interested, <emph>so</emph> interested that when
                     the door was thrown open and "Sir Victor Catheron" announced, both sprang to
                     their feet, conscience-stricken with all their guilt, red in their faces.</p>
                  <p>He advanced, hat in hand, a smile on his face. He was beside Trix first. She
                     stood, the paper still clutched in her hand, her cheeks redder than the crimson
                     velvet carpet. His astonished eyes fell upon it—he who ran might read—the
                        <title>Chesholm Courier</title> in big, black letters, and in staring
                     capitals, the "<choice>

                     </choice> OF CATHERON ROYALS."</p>
                  <p>The smile faded from Sir Victor Catheron's lips, the faint color, walking in
                     the chill wind had brought, died out of his face. He turned of that dead waxen
                     whiteness, fair people do turn—then he lifted his eyes and looked Miss Stuart
                     full in the face.</p>
                  <p>"May I ask where you got this paper?" he asked, very quietly.</p>
                  <p>"Oh, I'm <emph>so</emph> sorry!" burst out Trixy. "I'm awfully sorry, but I—I
                     didn't know—I mean, I didn't mean—oh, Sir Victor, forgive me if I have hurt
                     your feelings. I never meant <emph>you</emph> to see this."</p>
                  <p>"I am sure of that," he said, gently; "it is necessarily very painful to me.
                     Permit me to ask again, how you chanced to come by these papers?"</p>
                  <p>"They were lent us by—by a lady here; her father is from Cheshire, and always
                     gets the papers. Indeed I am very, very sorry. I wouldn't have had it happen
                     for worlds."</p>
                  <p>"There is no need to apologize—you are in no way to blame. I trust I find you
                     and Miss Darrell entirely recovered from the fatigue of last night. The most
                     charming party of the season—that is the unanimous verdict, and I for one
                     indorse it."</p>
                  <p>He took a seat, the color slowly returning to his face. As he spoke, two eyes
                     met his, dark, sweet, compassionate, but Edith Darrell did not speak a
                     word.</p>
                  <p>The obnoxious papers were swept out of sight—Miss Stuart made desperate efforts
                     at ease of manner, and morning call chit-chat, but every effort fell flat. The
                     spell of the <title>Chesholm Courier</title> was on them all, and was not to be
                     shaken off. It was a relief when the baronet rose to go.</p>
                  <p>"Lady Helena desires best regards to you both—she has fallen quite in love with
                        <emph>you</emph>, Miss Darrell. As it is a 'Nilsson night' at the academy, I
                     suppose we will have the pleasure of seeing you there?"</p>
                  <p>"You certainly will," answered Trix. "Edith has never<pb n="156-157"
                        xml:id="VAC6448-00000078"/> heard Nilsson yet, poor child. Remember us to
                     Lady Helena, Sir Victor. <emph>Good</emph> afternoon."</p>
                  <p>Then he was gone—and Miss Stuart looked at Miss Darrell, solemnly and long.</p>
                  <p>"There goes my last hope! Oh, why, why did I fetch down those wretched papers.
                     All my ambitious dreams of being a baro—nette are knocked in the head now.
                     He'll never be able to bear the sight of me again."</p>
                  <p>"I don't see that," Edith responded; "if a murder is committed, the world is
                     pretty sure to know of it—its something not to be ignored. How deeply he seems
                     to feel it too—in spite of his rank and wealth I pity him, Trixy."</p>
                  <p>"Pity him as much as you like, so that it is not the pity akin to love. I don't
                     want <emph>you</emph> for a rival, Edie—besides I have other views for
                     you."</p>
                  <p>"Indeed! The post of confidential maid when you are Lady Catheron?"</p>
                  <p>"Something better—the post of confidential sister. There! You needn't blush, I
                     saw how the land lay from the first, and Charley isn't a bad fellow in spite of
                     his laziness. The door bell again. Nothing but callers now until dark."</p>
                  <p>All Miss Stuart's masculine friends came dropping in successively, to institute
                     the necessary inquiries as to the state of her health, after eight hours'
                     steady dancing the preceding night. Edith's unsophisticated head ached with it
                     all, and her tongue grew paralyzed with the platitudes of society. The gas was
                     lit, and the dressing-bell ringing, before the last coattail disappeared.</p>
                  <p>As the young ladies, yawning drearily in each other's faces, turned to go up to
                     their rooms, a servant entered, bearing two pasteboard boxes.</p>
                  <p>"With Sir Victor Catheron's compliments, Miss Beatrix, and brought by his
                     man."</p>
                  <p>Each box was labelled with the owner's name. Trix opened hers with eager
                     fingers. A lovely bouquet of white roses, calla lilies, and jasmine, lay
                     within. Edith opened hers—another bouquet of white and scarlet camellias.</p>
                  <p>"For the opera," cried Trix, with sparkling eyes. "How good of him—how
                     generous—how forgiving! After the papers and all! Sir Victor's prince, or ought
                     to be."</p>
                  <p>"Don't gush, Trixy," Edith said, "it grows tiresome. Why did he send you all
                     white, I wonder? As emblematic of your spotless innocence and that sort of
                     thing? And do <emph>I</emph> bear any affinity to '<title>La Dame aux
                        Camellias?</title>' I think you may still hope, Trix—if there be truth in
                     the language of flowers."</p>
                  <p>Three hours later—fashionably late, of course—the Stuart party swept in state
                     into their box. Mrs. Stuart, Miss Stuart Mr. Stuart, junior, and Miss Darrell.
                     Miss Stuart dressed for some after "reception" in silvery blue silk, pearl
                     ornaments in her hair, and a virginal white bouquet in her hand. Miss Darrell
                     in the white muslin of last night, a scarlet opera cloak, and a bouquet of
                     white and scarlet camellias. Charley lounging in the background, looking as
                     usual, handsome of face, elegant of attire, and calmly and upliftedly
                     unconscious of both.</p>
                  <p>The sweet singer was on the stage. Edith Darrell leaned forward, forgetting
                     everything in a trance of delight. It seemed as though her very soul were
                     carried away in the spell of that enchanting voice. A score of "double barrels"
                     were turned to their box—Beatrix Stuart was an old story—but who was the dark
                     beauty? As she sat, leaning forward, breathless, trance-bound, the singer
                     vanished, the curtain fell.</p>
                  <p>"Oh!" it was a deep drawn sigh of pure delight. She drew back, lifted her
                     impassioned eyes, and met the smiling ones of Sir Victor Catheron.</p>
                  <p>"You did not know I was here," he said. "You were so enraptured I would not
                     speak. Once it would have enraptured me too, but I am afraid my rapturous days
                     are past."</p>
                  <p>"Sir Victor Catheron speaks as though he were an octogenarian. I have heard it
                     is 'good form' to outlive at twenty, every earthly emotion. Mr. Stuart yonder
                     prides himself on having accomplished the feat. I may be stupid, but I confess
                     being <foreign xml:lang="FRA">blasé</foreign>, doesn't strike me in the light
                     of an advantage?"</p>
                  <p>"But if <foreign xml:lang="FRA">blasé</foreign> be your normal state? I don't
                     think I ever tried to cultivate the <foreign xml:lang="LAT">vanitas
                        vanitatem</foreign> style of thing, but if it <emph>will</emph> come? Our
                     audience are enthusiastic enough—see! They have made her come back."</p>
                  <p>She came back, and held out both hands to the audience,<pb n="158-159"
                        xml:id="VAC6448-00000079"/> and the pretty gesture, and the charming smile,
                     redoubled the applause. Then silence fell, and softly and sweetly over that
                     silence, floated the tender, pathetic words of "Way down upon the Swanee
                     River." You might have heard a pin drop. Even Sir Victor looked moved. For
                     Edith, she sat scarcely breathing—quivering with ecstasy. As the last note was
                     sung, as the fair songster kissed hands and vanished, as the house arose from
                     its spell, and re-rang with enthusiasm, Edith turned again to the young
                     baronet, the brown eyes luminous with tears, the lips quivering. He bent above
                     her, saying something, he could hardly have told what, himself—carried away for
                     once in his life, by the witchery of two dark eyes.</p>
                  <p>Mr. Charles Stuart, standing in the background, beheld it all.</p>
                  <p>"Hard hit," he murmured to his mustache, but his face, as he gave his mother
                     his arm, and led her forth, told nothing.</p>
                  <p>An old adorer escorted Miss Stuart. Miss Darrell and her camellias, came last,
                     on the arm of the baronet.</p>
                  <p>That night, two brown eyes, haunted Sir Victor Catheron's slumbers—two brown
                     eyes sparkling through unshed tears—two red lips trembling like the lips of a
                     child.</p>
                  <p>For the owner of the eyes and lips, she put the camellias, carefully in water,
                     and far away in the small hours went to bed and to sleep. And sleeping she
                     dreamed, that all dressed in scarlet, and wearing a crown of scarlet camellias,
                     she was standing up to be married to Sir Victor Catheron with Mr. Charley
                     Stuart as officiating clergyman, when the door opened, and the murdered lady of
                     Trixy's story came stalking in, and whirled her screaming away in her ghostly
                     arms.</p>
                  <p>Two much excitement, champagne, and lobster salad had engendered the vision no
                     doubt, but it certainly spoiled Miss Darrell's beauty sleep <emph>that</emph>
                     night.</p>

                  <head>CHAPTER VI.</head>
                  <head type="sub">ONE MOONLIGHT NIGHT.</head>
                  <p>THE pleasant days went on—April went out—May came in. On the tenth of May, the
                     Stuart family, Sir Victor Catheron, and Lady Helena Powyss were to sail from
                     New York for Liverpool.</p>
                  <p>To Edith, fresh from the twilight of her country life, these days and nights
                     had been one bewildering round of excitement and delight. Opera, theatre,
                     dinner and evening parties, shopping, driving, calling, receiving—all that goes
                     to make the round of that sort of life, had been run. Her slender wardrobe had
                     been replenished, the white Swiss had been reinforced by half-a-dozen
                     glistening silks; the corals, by a set of rubies and fine gold. Mr. Stuart
                     might be pompous and pretentious, but he wasn't stingy, and he had insisted
                     upon it for his own credit. And half-a-dozen "spandy new" silks, fresh from
                     Stewart's counters, with the pristine glitter of their bloom yet upon them,
                     were very different from one half-worn amber tissue of Trixy's. Miss Darrell
                     took the dresses and the rubies, and looked uncommonly handsome in both.</p>
                  <p>On the last night but one, of their stay in New York, Mrs. Featherbrain gave a
                     last "At Home," a sort of "P. P. C." party, Trixy called it. Miss Darrell was
                     invited, and said nothing at the time, unless tossing the card of invitation
                     contemptuously out of the window can be called saying something; but at the
                     last moment she declined to go.</p>
                  <p>"My head is whirling now, from a surfeit of parties," she said to Miss Stuart.
                     "Aunt Chatty is going to stay at home, and so shall I. I don't like your Mrs.
                     Featherbrain—that's the truth—and I'm not fashionable enough yet to sham
                     friendship with women I hate. Besides, Trix dear, you know you were a
                     little—just a little—jealous of me, the other night at Roosevelt's. Sir Victor
                     danced with me once oftener than he did with you. Now, you dear old love, I'll
                     let you have a whole baronet to yourself, for this night, and who knows what
                     may happen before morning?"</p>
                  <p>Miss Edith Darrell was one of those young persons—<pb n="160-161"
                        xml:id="VAC6448-00000080"/> happily rare—who, when they take a strong
                     antipathy, are true to it, even at the sacrifice of their own pleasure. In her
                     secret soul, she was jealous of Mrs. Featherbrain. If she and Charley carried
                     on their imbecile flirtation, at least it would not be under <emph>her</emph>
                     disgusted eyes.</p>
                  <p>Miss Stuart departed—not the lilies of the field—not Solomon in all his
                     glory—not the Queen of Sheba herself, ever half so magnificent. Charley went
                     with her, a placid martyr to brotherly duty. And Edith went down to the family
                     sitting-room where Aunt Chatty (Aunt Chatty by request) sat dozing in her
                     after-dinner chair.</p>
                  <p>"We are going to have an 'At home' all to our two selves to-night, auntie,"
                     Edith said, kissing her thin cheek; "and I am going to sing you to sleep, by
                     way of beginning."</p>
                  <p>She was fond of Aunt Chatty—a meek soul, born to be tyrannized over,
                        <emph>and</emph> tyrannized over, from her very cradle. One of those large
                     women, who obey their small husbands in fear and trembling, who believe
                     everything they are told, who "bless the squire and his relations, and live
                     contented with their stations;" who are bullied by their friends, by their
                     children, by their servants, and who die meekly some day, and go to Heaven.</p>
                  <p>Edith opened the piano and began to play. She was looking very handsome
                     to-night, in green silk and black lace, one half-shattered rose in her hair.
                     She looked handsome—at least so the young man who entered unobserved, and stood
                     looking at her, evidently thought.</p>
                  <p>She had not heard him enter, but presently some mesmeric <foreign
                        xml:lang="FRA">rapport</foreign> between them, told her he was near. She
                     turned her head and saw him. Aunt Chatty caught sight of him, in her
                     semi-sleeping state, at the same moment.</p>
                  <p>"Dear me, Charley," his mother said, "<emph>you</emph> here? I thought you went
                     to Mrs. Featherbrain's?"</p>
                  <p>"So I did," replied Charley. "I went—I saw—I returned—and here I am, if you and
                     Dithy will have me for the rest of the evening."</p>
                  <p>"Edith and I were very well off without you. We had peace, and that is more
                     than we generally have when you and she come together. You shall be allowed to
                     stay only on one condition, and that is that you don't quarrel."</p>
                  <p>"<emph>I</emph> quarrel?" Charley said, lifting his eyebrows to the middle of
                     his forehead. "My dear mother, your mental blindness on many points, is really
                     deplorable. It's all Edith's fault—all; one of the few fixed principles of my
                     life, is never to quarrel with anybody. It upsets a man's digestion, and is
                     fatiguing in the extreme. Our first meeting," continued Mr. Stuart, stretching
                     himself out leisurely on a sofa, "at which, Edith fell in love with me at
                     sight, was a row. Well, if it wasn't a row, it was an unpleasantness of some
                     sort. You can't deny, Miss Darrell, there was a coolness between us. Didn't we
                     pass the night in a snow-drift? Since then, every other meeting has been a
                     succession of rows. In justice to myself, and the angelic sweetness of my own
                     disposition, I must repeat, the beginning, middle, and ending of each, lies
                     with her. She <emph>will</emph> bully, and I never could stand being bullied—I
                     always knock under. But I warn her—a day of retribution is at hand. In
                     self-defence I mean to marry her, and then, base miscreant, beware! The trodden
                     worm will turn, and plunge the iron into her own soul. May I ask what you are
                     laughing at, Miss Darrell?"</p>
                  <p>"A slight confusion of metaphor, Charley—nothing more. What have you done with
                     Trix?"</p>
                  <p>"Trix is all right in the matronly charge of Mrs. Featherbrain, and engaged ten
                     deep to the baronet. By the bye, the baronet was inquiring for you, with a
                     degree of warmth and solicitude, as unwelcome as it was uncalled for. A baronet
                     for a brother-in-law is all very well—a baronet for a rival is not well at all.
                     Now, my dear child, try to overcome the general nastiness of your cranky
                     disposition, for once, and make yourself agreeable. I knew you were pining on
                     the stem for me at home, and so I threw over the last crush of the season, made
                     Mrs. Featherbrain my enemy for life, and here I am. Sing us something."</p>
                  <p>Miss Darrell turned to the piano with a frown, but her eyes were smiling, and
                     in her secret heart she was well-content. Charley was beside her. Charley had
                     given up the ball and Mrs. Featherbrain for her. It was of no use denying it,
                     she was fond of Charley. Of late it had dawned<pb n="162-163"
                        xml:id="VAC6448-00000081"/> dimly and deliciously upon her that Sir Victor
                     Catheron was growing very attentive. If so wildly improbable a thing could
                     occur, as Sir Victor's falling in love with her, she was ready at any moment to
                     be his wife; but for the love which alone makes marriage sweet and holy, which
                     neither time, nor trouble, nor absence, can change—that love she felt for her
                     cousin Charley, and no other mortal man.</p>
                  <p>It was a very pleasant evening—<emph>how</emph> pleasant, Edith did not care to
                     own, even to herself. Aunt Chatty dozed sweetly in her arm-chair, she in her
                     place at the piano, and Charley taking comfort on his sofa, and calmly and
                     dispassionately finding fault with her music. That those two could spend an
                     evening, an hour, together, without disagreeing, was simply an utter
                     impossibility. Edith invariably lost her temper—nothing earthly ever disturbed
                     Charley's. Presently, in anger and disgust, Miss Darrell jumped up from the
                     piano-stool, and protested she would play no more.</p>
                  <p>"To be told I sing Kathleen Mavourneen flat, and that the way I hold my elbows
                     when I play Thalberg's 'Home,' is frightful to behold, I will <emph>not</emph>
                     stand! Like all critics, you find it easier to point out one's faults, than to
                     do better. It's the very last time, sir, I'll ever play a note for you!"</p>
                  <p>But, somehow, after a skirmish at euchre, at which she was ignobly beaten, and,
                     I must say, shamefully cheated, she was back at the piano, and it was the clock
                     striking twelve that made her start at last.</p>
                  <p>"Twelve! Goodness me. I didn't think it was half-past ten!" Mr. Stuart smiled,
                     and stroked his mustache with calm complacency. "Aunt Chatty, wake up! It's
                     midnight—time all good little women were in bed."</p>
                  <p>"<emph>You</emph> need not hurry yourself on that account, Dithy," Charley
                     suggests, "if the rule only applies to good little women."</p>
                  <p>Miss Darrell replies with a glance of scorn, and wakes up Mrs. Stuart.</p>
                  <p>"You were sleeping so nicely I thought it a pity to wake you sooner. Come,
                     auntie dear, we'll go upstairs together. You know we have a hard day's work
                     before us to-morrow. Good-night, Mr. Stuart."</p>
                  <p>"Good-night, my love," Mr. Stuart responded, making no attempt to stir. Edith
                     linked her strong, young arm in that of her sleepy aunt and led her upstairs.
                     He lay and watched the slim green figure, the beautiful bright face, as it
                     disappeared in a mellow flood of gaslight. The clear, sweet voice came floating
                     saucily back: <q>
                        <lg type="quotation">
                           <l>"And Charley he's my darling,</l>
                           <l rend="ti-1">My darling—my darling,</l>
                           <l>And Charley he's my darling,</l>

                        </lg>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>All that was sauciest, and most coquettish in the girl's nature, came out with
                     Charley. With Sir Victor, as Trixy explained it, she was "goody" and talked
                     sense.</p>
                  <p>Mr. Stuart went back to the ball, and, I regret to say, made himself obnoxious
                     to old Featherbrain, by the marked <foreign xml:lang="FRA"
                        >empressement</foreign> of his devotion to old Featherbrain's wife. Edith
                     listened to the narration next day from the lips of Trix with surprise and
                     disgust. Miss Stuart, on her own account, was full of triumph and happiness.
                     Sir Victor had been most devoted, "<emph>most devoted</emph>," said Trix, in
                     italics, "that is, for him. He danced with me very often, and he spoke several
                     times of <emph>you</emph>, Dithy, dear. He couldn't understand why you absented
                     yourself from the last party of the season—no more can I for that matter. A
                     person may hate a person like poison—I often do myself—and yet go to that
                     person's parties."</p>
                  <p>But this was a society maxim Miss Darrell could by no means be brought to
                     understand. Where she liked she liked, where she hated she hated—there were no
                     half measures for her.</p>
                  <p>The last day came. At noon, with a brilliant May sun shining, the ship fired
                     her farewell guns, and steamed away for Merrie England. Edith leaned over the
                     bulwark and watched the receding shore, with her heart in her eyes.</p>
                  <p>"Good-by to home," she said, "a smile on her lip, a tear in her eye." "Who
                     knows when and how I may see it again. Who knows whether I shall
                        <emph>ever</emph> see it?"</p>
                  <p>The luncheon bell rang; everybody—a wonderful crowd too—flocked merrily
                     downstairs to the saloon, where two long tables, bright with crystal and
                     flowers, were spread.<pb n="164-165" xml:id="VAC6448-00000082"/> What a
                     delightful thing was an ocean voyage, and sea-sickness—bah!—merely an illusion
                     of the senses.</p>
                  <p>After lunch, Charley selected the sunniest spot on deck for his resting-place,
                     and the prettiest girl on board, for his companion, spread out his railway rug
                     at her feet, spread out himself thereon, and prepared to be happy and be made
                     love to. Trix, on the arm of the baronet, paraded the deck. Mrs. Stuart and
                     Lady Helena buried themselves in the seclusion of the ladies' cabin, in
                     expectation of the wrath to come. Edith got a camp-stool and a book, and hid
                     herself behind the wheel-house for a little of private enjoyment. But she did
                     not read; it was delight enough to sit and watch the old ocean smiling, and
                     smiling like any other coquette, as though it could never be cruel.</p>
                  <p>The afternoon wore on; the sun dropped low, the wind arose—so did the sea. And
                     presently—staggering blindly on Sir Victor's arm, pale as death, with
                     speechless agony imprinted on every feature—Trixy made her appearance behind
                     the wheel house.</p>
                  <p>"O Edith, I feel awfully—awfully! I feel like death—I feel—"</p>
                  <p>She wrenched her arm from the baronet's, rushed wildly to the side, and—Edith's
                     dark, laughing eyes looked up into the blue ones, that no effort of Sir
                     Victor's could <emph>quite</emph> control. The next moment she was by Trixy's
                     side, leading that limp and pallid heroine to the regions below, whence, for
                     five mortal days, she emerged not, nor did the eye of man rest on Miss Beatrix
                     Stuart.</p>
                  <p>The weather was fine, but the wind and sea ran tolerably high, and of course
                     everybody mostly was tolerably sick. One day's ordeal sufficed for Edith's
                     tribute to old Neptune; after that, she never felt a qualm. A great deal of her
                     time was spent in waiting upon Aunt Chatty and Trix, both of whom were very far
                     gone indeed. In the case of Miss Stuart, the tortures of jealousy were added to
                     the tortures of seasickness. Did Sir Victor walk with the young ladies on deck?
                     Did he walk with <emph>her</emph>, Edith? Did he ever inquire for herself? Oh,
                     it was shameful—shameful that she should be kept prostrate here, unable to lift
                     her head! At this juncture, generally, in her excitement, Trixy did lift it,
                     and the consequence was—woe.</p>
                  <p>It was full moon before they reached mid-ocean. How Edith enjoyed it, no words
                     can tell. Perhaps it was out of merciful compassion to Trix, but she did not
                     tell her of the long, brisk twilight, mid-day, and moonlight walks she and the
                     baronet took on deck. How, leaning over the bulwarks, they watched the sun set,
                     round and red, into the sea, and the silver sickle May moon rise, like another
                     Aphrodite, out of the waves. She did not tell her, how they sat side by side at
                     dinner, how he lay at her feet, and read aloud for her, in sheltered sunny
                     nooks, how uncommonly friendly and confidential they became altogether, in
                     these first half-dozen days out. People grow intimate in two days at sea, as
                     they would not in two years on land. Was it <emph>all</emph> gentlemanly
                     courtesy and politeness on the baronet's side? the girl sometimes wondered. She
                     could analyze her own feelings pretty well. Of that fitful, feverish passion
                     called love, described by the country swain as feeling "hot and dry like—with a
                     pain in the side like," she felt no particle. There was one, Mr. Charles
                     Stuart, lying about in places, looking serene and sunburnt, who saw it all with
                     sleepy, half-closed eyes, and kept his conclusions to himself. "<foreign
                        xml:lang="TUR">Kismet!</foreign>" he thought; "the will of Allah be done.
                     What is written is written. Sea-sickness is bad enough, without the green-eyed
                     monster. Even Othello, if he had been crossing in a Cunard ship, would have put
                     off the pillow performance until they reached the other side."</p>
                  <p>One especial afternoon, Edith fell asleep after luncheon, on a sofa, in her own
                     and Trixy's cabin, and slept through dinner and dessert, and only woke with the
                     lighting of the lamps. Trix lay, pale and wretched, gazing out of the porthole,
                     at the glory of moonlight on the heaving sea, as one who sorrows without hope
                     of consolation.</p>
                  <p>"I hope you enjoyed your forty winks, Edith," she remarked; "what a Rip Van
                     Winkle you are! For my part, I've never slept at all since I came on board this
                     horrid ship! Now, where are you going?"</p>
                  <p>"To get something to eat from my friend the stewardess," Edith answered; "I see
                     I am too late for dinner."</p>
                  <p>Miss Darrell went, and got some tea and toast. Then wrapping herself in a
                     blanket shawl, and tying a coquettish red wool hood over her hair, she ascended
                     to the deck.</p>
                  <pb n="166-167" xml:id="VAC6448-00000083"/>
                  <p>It was pretty well deserted by the ladies—none the worse for that, Edith
                     thought. The full moon shone with untold splendor, over the vast expanse of
                     tossing sea, heaving with that majestic swell, that never quite lulls on the
                     mighty Atlantic. The gentlemen, filled the smoking-room, the "Tabak Parliament"
                     was at its height. She took a campstool, and made for her favorite sheltered
                     spot behind the wheel-house. How grand it was—the starry sky, the brilliant
                     white moon, the boundless ocean—that long trail of silvery radiance stretching
                     miles behind. An icy blast swept over the deep, but, wrapped in her big shawl,
                     Edith could defy even that. She forgot Sir Victor and the daring ambition of
                     her life. She sat absorbed in the beauty and splendor of that moonlight on the
                     sea. Very softly, very sweetly, half unconsciously, she began singing "The
                     Young May Moon," when a step behind made her turn her head. It was Sir Victor
                     Catheron. She awoke from her dream—came back to earth, and was of the world
                     worldly, once more. The smile that welcomed him was very bright. She would have
                     blushed if she could; but it is a disadvantage of pale brunettes that they
                     don't blush easily.</p>
                  <p>"I heard singing, sweet and faint, and I give you my word, Miss Darrell, I
                     thought it might be the Lurline, or a stray mermaid combing her sea-green
                     locks. It is all very beautiful, of course, but are you not afraid of taking
                     cold?"</p>
                  <p>"I never take cold," Miss Darrell answered; "influenza is an unknown disease.
                     Has the tobacco parliament broken up, that I behold you here?"</p>
                  <p>"It is half-past eleven—didn't you know it?—and all the lights are out."</p>
                  <p>"Good Heaven!" Edith cried, starting up aghast; "half-past eleven! What will
                     Trixy say? Really, moon-gazing must be absorbing work. I had no idea it was
                     after ten."</p>
                  <p>"Stay a moment, Miss Darrell," Sir Victor interposed, "there is something I
                     would like to say to you—something I have wished to speak of, since we came on
                     board."</p>
                  <p>Edith's heart gave one great jump—into her mouth it seemed. What could such a
                     preface as this portend, save one thing? The baronet spoke again, and Miss
                     Darrell's heart sunk down to the very soles of her buttoned boots.</p>
                  <p>"It is concerning those old papers, the <title>Chesholm Courier</title>. You
                     understand, and—and the lamentable tragedy they chronicle."</p>
                  <p>"Yes?" said Miss Darrell, shutting her lips tight.</p>
                  <p>"It is naturally a deeply painful subject to me. Twenty-three years have
                     passed; I was but an infant at the time, yet if it had occurred only a year
                     ago, I think I could hardly feel it more keenly than I do—hardly suffer more,
                     when I speak of it."</p>
                  <p>"Then <emph>why</emph> speak of it?" was the young lady's very sensible
                     question. "<emph>I</emph> have no claim to hear it, I am sure."</p>
                  <p>"No," the young man responded, and even in the moonlight she could see his
                     color rise, "perhaps not, and yet I wanted to speak to you of it ever since. I
                     don't know why, it is something I can scarcely bear to think of even, and yet I
                     feel a sort of relief in speaking of it to you. Perhaps there is 'rapport'
                     between us—that we are affinities—who knows?"</p>
                  <p>Who indeed! Miss Darrell's heart came up from her boots, to its proper place,
                     and stayed there.</p>
                  <p>"It was such a terrible thing," the young man went on, "such a mysterious
                     thing. To this day it is wrapped in darkness. She was so young, so fair, so
                     good—it seems too horrible for belief, that any human being could lift his hand
                     against so innocent a life. And yet it was done."</p>
                  <p>"A most terrible thing," Edith said; "but one has only to read the papers, to
                     learn such deeds of horror are done every day. Life is a terribly sensational
                     story. You say it is shrouded in darkness, but the <title>Chesholm
                        Courier</title> did not seem at all in the dark."</p>
                  <p>"You mean Inez Catheron. She was innocent."</p>
                  <p>"Indeed!"</p>
                  <p>"She was not guilty, except in this—she knew who <emph>was</emph> guilty, and
                     concealed it. Of that, I have reason to be sure."</p>
                  <p>"Her brother, of course—the Juan Catheron of the papers?"</p>
                  <p>"Who is to tell? Even that is not certain. No," in answer to her look of
                     surprise, "it is not certain. I am sure my aunt believes in his innocence."</p>
                  <p>"Then who—"</p>
                  <pb n="168-169" xml:id="VAC6448-00000084"/>
                  <p>"Ah—<emph>who?</emph>" the baronet said mournfully, "who was the murderer? It
                     may be that we will never know."</p>
                  <p>"You will know," Edith said decidedly. "I am sure of it. I am a firm believer
                     in the truism that 'murder will out.' Sooner or later you will know."</p>
                  <p>She spoke with the calm conviction of prophecy. She looked back to shudder at
                     her own words in the after-days.</p>
                  <p>"Three-and-twenty years is a tolerable time to forget even the bitterest
                     sorrow, but the thought of that tragedy is as bitter to my aunt to-day, as it
                     was when it was done. She cannot bear to speak of it—I believe she cannot bear
                     to <unclear>think</unclear> of it. What I know, therefore, concerning it, I
                     have <unclear>learned</unclear> from others. Until I was eighteen, I knew
                     absolutely nothing. Of my mother, of course I have no remembrance, and yet"—his
                     eyes and tone grew dreamy—"as far back as I can recall, there is in my mind the
                     memory of a woman, young and handsome, bending above my bed, kissing and crying
                     over me. My mother was fair, the face I recall is dark. You will think me
                     sentimental—you will laugh at me, perhaps," he said, smiling nervously; "you
                     will set me down as a dreamer of dreams, and yet it is there."</p>
                  <p>Her dark, earnest eyes looked up at him, full of womanly sympathy.</p>
                  <p>"Laugh at you! Think better of me, Sir Victor. In these days it is rare enough
                     to see men with either memory or veneration for their mother—whether dead or
                     alive."</p>
                  <p>He looked at her; words seemed struggling to his lips. Once he half spoke. Then
                     he checked himself suddenly. When he did speak it was with a total change of
                     tone.</p>
                  <p>"And I am keeping you selfishly here in the cold. Take my arm, Miss Darrell;
                     you must not stop another instant."</p>
                  <p>She obeyed at once. He led her to her cabin-door—hesitated—took her hand and
                     held it while he spoke:</p>
                  <p>"I don't know why, as I said before, I have talked of this; I could not have
                     done it with any one else. Let me thank you for your sympathy with all my
                     heart."</p>
                  <p>Then he was gone; and, very grave and thoughtful, Edith sought Trixy and the
                     upper berth. Miss Stuart lay calmly sleeping the sleep of the just and the
                     sea-sick, blissfully unconscious of the traitorous goings on about her. Edith
                     looked at her with a sort of twinge. Was it fair, after all? was it strictly
                     honorable? "Poor Trix," she said, kissing her softly, "I don't think it will be
                        <emph>you!</emph>"</p>
                  <p>Next morning, at breakfast, Miss Darrell noticed that Mr. Stuart, junior,
                     watched her as he sipped his coffee, with a portentous countenance that
                     foreboded something. What it foreboded came out presently. He led her on
                     deck—offered her his arm for a morning constitutional, and opened fire thus
                     wise:</p>
                  <p>"What were you and the baronet about on deck at abnormal hours of the night?
                     What was the matter with you both?"</p>
                  <p>"Now, now!" cried Edith, "how do you come to know anything about it? What
                     business have small boys like you, spying on the actions of their elders, when
                     they should be safely tucked up, and asleep in their little beds?"</p>
                  <p>"I wasn't spying; I was asleep. I have no restless conscience to keep me
                     prowling about at unholy hours."</p>
                  <p>"How do you come to know, then?</p>
                  <p>"A little bird told me."</p>
                  <p>"I'll twist your little bird's neck! Who was it, sir? I command you."</p>
                  <p>"How she queens it already! Don't excite yourself, you small Amazon. It was the
                     officer of the deck."</p>
                  <p>"The officer of the deck might be much better employed; and you may tell him
                     so, with my compliments."</p>
                  <p>"I will; but you don't deny it—you were there!"</p>
                  <p>"I never deny my actions," she says with royal disdain; "yes, I was there."</p>
                  <p>"With Sir Victor—alone?"</p>
                  <p>"With Sir Victor—alone!"</p>
                  <p>"What did you talk about, Miss Darrell?"</p>
                  <p>"More than I care to repeat for your edification, Mr. Stuart. Have you any more
                     questions to ask, pray?"</p>
                  <p>"One or two; did he ask you to marry him, Edith?"</p>
                  <p>"Ah, no!" Edith answers with a sigh that is genuine; "there is no such luck as
                        <emph>that</emph> in store for Dithy Darrell. A baronet's bride—Lady
                     Catheron! no, no—the cakes and ale of life are not for me."</p>
                  <p>"Would you marry him, if he did? Will you marry him when he does? for that is
                     what it comes to, after all."</p>
                  <pb n="170-171" xml:id="VAC6448-00000085"/>
                  <p>"Would I marry him?" She looks at him in real incredulous wonder. "Would I
                     marry Sir Victor Catheron—I? My dear Charley, when you ask rational questions,
                     I shall be happy to answer them, to the best of my ability, but not such
                     absurdity as that."</p>
                  <p>"Then, you <emph>will?</emph>"</p>
                  <p>"Charley, don't be a tease—what do young persons of your juvenile years know
                     about such things? I don't like the turn this conversation has taken; let us
                     change it, let us talk about the weather—that's always a safe subject. Isn't it
                     a splendid morning? Isn't it charming to have a perpetual fair wind? And how
                     are you going to account for it, that the wind is always fair going to England,
                     and always ahead coming out?</p>

                  <p>Charley is not going to be put off, however; he declines to talk of either wind
                     or weather.</p>
                  <p>"Answer my question, Edith, if you please. If Sir Victor Catheron asks you,

                  <p>She looks at him calmly, steadily, the man she loves, and answers:</p>

                  <p>TWO days later, and Fastnet Rock looms up against the blue sky; the iron-bound
                     Irish coast appears. At noon they will land in Queenstown.</p>
                  <p>"Come back to Erin, mavourneen, mavourneen," sings Charley's voice down the
                     passage, early in the morning.</p>
                  <p>Charley can sing a little still. He is to lose Edith. Sir Victor Catheron is to
                     win and wear; but as she is not Lady Catheron yet, Mr. Stuart postpones despair
                     and suicide until she <emph>is</emph>.</p>
                  <p>She sprang from her bed with a cry of delight. Ireland! One, at least, of the
                     lands of her dreams.</p>
                  <p>"Trixy!" she cries. "O Trixy, look out! 'The land of sweet Erin' at last!"</p>
                  <p>"I see it," Trixy said, rolling sleepily out of the under berth; "and I don't
                     think much of it. A lot of wicked-looking rocks, and not a bit greener than at
                     home. I thought the very sky was green over Ireland."</p>
                  <p>For the last two days Trixy's bitter trials had ended—her sea-sickness a dismal
                     dream of the past. She was able, in ravishing toilet, to appear at the
                     dinner-table, to pace the deck on the arm of Sir Victor. As one having the
                     right, she calmly resumed her sway where she had left it off. Since that
                     moonlight night of which she (Trixy) happily knew nothing, the bare civilities
                     of life alone had passed between Miss Darrell and the baronet. Sir Victor might
                     try, and did, but with the serene superiority of right and power Miss Stuart
                     countermanded every move. Hers she was determined he should be, and there was
                     all the lost time to be made up besides. So she redoubled her attentions, aided
                     and abetted by her pa—and how it came about the perplexed young Englishman
                     never could tell, but somehow he was constantly at Miss Stuart's side and
                     unable to get away. Edith saw it all and smiled to herself.</p>
                  <p>"To-day for me, to-morrow for thee," she hummed. "I have had my day; it is
                     Trixy's turn now. She manœuvres so well it would be a pity to interfere."</p>
                  <p>Charley was <emph>her</emph> cavalier those pleasant last days; both were
                     disposed to take the goods their gods provided, and not fret for to-morrow. It
                     would not last—life's fairy gifts never do, for to-day they would eat, drink,
                     and be merry together, and forget the evil to come.</p>
                  <p>They landed, spent an hour in Queenstown, then the train whirled them away "to
                     that beautiful city called Cork." There they remained two days, visited Blarney
                     Castle, of course, and would have kissed the Blarney Stone but for the<pb
                        n="172-173" xml:id="VAC6448-00000086"/> trouble of climbing up to it. Then
                     off, and away, to Killarney.</p>
                  <p>And still Sir Victor was Trixy's captive—still Edith and Charley maintained
                     their alliance. Lady Helena watched her nephew and the American heiress, and
                     her fine woman's instinct told her he was in no danger <emph>there</emph>.</p>
                  <p>"If it were the other one, now," she thought, glancing at Edith's dark, bright
                     face; "but it is quite clear how matters stand between her and her cousin. What
                     a handsome pair they will make."</p>
                  <p>Another of the elders—Mr. James Stuart—watched the progress of matters, through
                     very different spectacles. It was the one dream of his life, to marry his son
                     and daughter to British rank.</p>
                  <p>"Of wealth, sir, they have enough," said the Wall Street banker, pulling up his
                     collar pompously. "I will leave my children a cool million apiece. Their
                     descent is equal to the best—to the best, sir—the royal rank of Scotland is in
                     their veins. Fortune I don't look for—blood, sir—BLOOD, I do."</p>
                  <p>Over his daughter's progress after blood, he smiled complacently. Over his
                     son's conduct he frowned.</p>
                  <p>"Mind what <emph>you're</emph> at, young man," he said, on the day they left
                     Cork, gruffly to Charley. "I have my eye on you. Ordinary attention to Fred
                     Darrell's daughter I don't mind, but no fooling. You understand me, sir? No
                     fooling. By George, sir, if you don't marry to please me, I'll cut you off with
                     a shilling!"</p>
                  <p>Mr. Stuart, junior, looked tranquilly up at Mr. Stuart, senior, with an
                     expression of countenance the senior by no means understood.</p>
                  <p>"Don't lose your temper, governor," he answered calmly. "I won't marry Fred
                     Darrell's daughter, if that's what you mean by 'fooling.' She and I settled
                        <emph>that</emph> question two or three centuries ago."</p>
                  <p>At the village of Macroom, they quitted the comfortable railway carriage, and
                     mounted the conveyance known in Ireland, as a public car, a thing like an
                     overgrown jaunting-car, on which ten people can ride, sitting back to back,
                     isolated by the pile of luggage between. There was but one tourist for the
                     Lakes besides themselves, a large, military-looking looking young man, with
                     muttonchop whiskers and an eye-glass, a knapsack and knickerbockers.</p>
                  <p>"Hammond, by Jove!" exclaimed Sir Victor. "Hammond, of the Scotch Grays. My
                     dear fellow, delighted to see you. Captain Hammond, my friend, Mr. Stuart, of
                     New York."</p>
                  <p>Captain Hammond put up his eye-glass and bowed. Charley lifted his hat, to this
                     large military swell.</p>
                  <p>"I say, Sir Victor," the Captain of Scotch Grays began, "who'd have thought of
                     seeing you here, you know? They said—aw—you had gone exploring Canada, or the
                     United States, or some of those kind of places, you know. Who's your party?"
                        <foreign xml:lang="ITA">sotto voce</foreign>; "Americans—hey?"</p>
                  <p>"American friends, and my aunt, Lady Helena Powyss."</p>
                  <p>"Now, thin—look alive yer honors," cried the car-driver, and a scramble into
                     seats instantly began. In his own mind, Sir Victor had determined his seat
                     should be by Miss Darrell's side. But what is man's determination beside
                     woman's resolve?</p>
                  <p>"Oh, p-please, Sir Victor," cries Miss Stuart, in a piteous little voice,
                        "<emph>do</emph> help me up. It's so dreadfully high, and I
                        <emph>know</emph> I shall fall off. And oh, please, do sit here, and point
                     out the places as we go along—one enjoys places, so much more, when some one
                     points them out, and you've been along here before."</p>
                  <p>What could Sir Victor do? More particularly as Lady Helena good-humoredly
                     chimed in:</p>
                  <p>"Yes, Victor, come and point out the places. You shall sit bodkin, between Miss
                     Beatrix and me. Your friend in the Tweed suit, can sit next, and you, my dear
                     Mrs. Stuart—where will <emph>you</emph> sit?"</p>
                  <p>"As Charley and Edith will have all the other side to themselves," said meek
                     Mrs. Stuart, "I guess I'll sit beside Edith."</p>
                  <p>"Ay, ay," chimed in her spouse, "and I'll mount with cabby. All serene, there,
                     behind? Then away we go!"</p>
                  <p>Away they went, clattering over the road, with the whole tatterdemalion
                     population of Macroom after, shouting for "ha' pennies."</p>
                  <p>"Rags enough to set up a paper-mill," suggested Charley,<pb n="174-175"
                        xml:id="VAC6448-00000087"/> "and all the noses turn-ups! Edith, how do you
                     like this arrangement?"</p>
                  <p>"I think Trixy's cleverer than I ever gave her credit for," laughed Edith;
                     "it's a pity so much diplomacy should be 'love's labor lost.'"</p>
                  <p>"Poor Trixy! She means well too. Honor thy father, that thy days may be long in
                     the land. She's only trying to fulfil the command. And you think she has no
                     chance?"</p>
                  <p>"I know it," Edith answers, with the calm serenity of conviction.</p>
                  <p>"Sir Victor, who's your friend with the solemn face and the funny
                     knickerbockers?" whispers. Trixy, under her white parasol.</p>
                  <p>"He's the Honorable Angus Hammond, second son of Lord Glengary, and captain of
                     Scotch Grays," replies Sir Victor, and Miss Stuart opens her eyes, and looks
                     with newborn reverence, at the big, speechless young warrior, who sits sucking
                     the head of his umbrella, and who is an honorable and the son of a lord.</p>
                  <p>The day was delightful, the scenery exquisite, his companion vivacious in the
                     extreme, Lady Helena in her most genial mood. But Sir Victor Catheron sat very
                     silent and <foreign xml:lang="FRA">distrait</foreign> all the way. Rallied by
                     Miss Stuart on his gloom, he smiled faintly, and acknowledged he felt a trifle
                     out of sorts. As he made the confession he paused abruptly—clear and sweet,
                     rang out the girlish laugh of Edith Darrell.</p>
                  <p>"Our friends on the other side appear to be in excellent spirits at least,"
                     says Lady Helena, smiling in sympathy with that merry peal; "what a very
                     charming girl Miss Darrell is."</p>
                  <p>Trixy shoots one swift, sidelong glance at the baronet's face, and answers
                     demurely:</p>
                  <p>"Oh it's an understood thing that Dithy and Charley are never really happy,
                     except when together. I don't believe Charley would have taken the trouble to
                     come at all, if Edith, at his solicitation, had not been one of the party."</p>
                  <p>"A very old affair I suppose?" asks her ladyship, still smiling.</p>
                  <p>"A very old affair, indeed," Trix answers gayly. "Edith will make a charming
                     sister-in-law; don't you think so, Sir Victor?"</p>
                  <p>She looks up at him artlessly as she plunges her small dagger into a vital
                     place. He tries to smile, and say something agreeable in return—the smile is a
                     failure; the words a greater failure. After that, all Trixy's attention falls
                     harmless. He sits moodily listening to the gay voices on the other side of the
                     luggage, and finds out for sure and certain that he is dead in love with Miss
                     Darrell.</p>
                  <p>They reach Glengariff as the twilight shadows fall—lovely Glengariff, where
                     they are to dine and pass the night. At dinner, by some lucky chance, Edith is
                     beside him, and Captain Hammond falls into the clutches of Trix. And Miss
                     Darrell turns her graceful shoulder deliberately upon Charley, and bestows her
                     smiles, and glances, and absolute attention upon his rival.</p>
                  <p>After dinner they go for a sail by moonlight to an island, where there are the
                     remains of a martello tower. The elders, for whom "moonlight on the lake," long
                     ago lost its witchery, and falling dews and night airs retain their terrors,
                     stay at home and rest. Edith and Sir Victor, Trix and the Honorable Angus
                     Hammond, saunter down arm in arm to the boat. Charley and the two Irish boatmen
                     bring up the rear—Mr. Stuart smoking a consolatory cigar.</p>
                  <p>They all "pile in" together, and fill the little boat. The baronet follows up
                     his luck, and keeps close to Edith. How beautiful she is with the soft silver

                  <head>CHAPTER VIII.</head>
                  <head type="sub">IN TWO BOATS.</head>
                  <p>EARLY next morning our tourists remounted the car and jogged slowly over that
                     lovely stretch of country which lies between Glengariff and Killarney.</p>
                  <p>Their places were as on the day before—Sir Victor in the possession of Trix,
                     Charley with Edith. But the baronet's gloom was gone—hope filled his heart. She
                     did <emph>not</emph> love her cousin,—of that he had convinced himself,—and one
                     day he might call her wife.</p>
                  <p>Sir Victor Catheron was that <foreign xml:lang="LAT">rara avis</foreign>, a
                     modest young man. That this American girl, penniless and pedigreeless, was
                     beneath him, he never thought—of his own rank and wealth, as motives to
                     influence her, he never once dreamed. Nothing base or mercenary could find a
                     place in so fair a creature; so noble and beautiful a face must surely be
                     emblematic of a still more noble and beautiful soul. Alas! for the blindness of
                     people in love.</p>
                  <p>It was a day of delight, a day of cloudless skies, sparkling sunshine, fresh
                     mountain breezes, sublime scenery. Wild, bleak valleys, frowning Kerry rocks,
                     roaring torrents, barefooted, ragged children, pigs and people beneath the same
                     thatched roof, such squalor and utter poverty as in their dreams they had never
                     imagined.</p>
                  <p>"Good Heaven!" Edith said, with a shudder, "how can life be worth living in
                     such horrible poverty as this?"</p>
                  <p>"The bugbear of your life seems to be poverty, Edith," Charley answered. "I
                     dare say these people eat and sleep, fall in love, marry, and are happy even
                     here."</p>
                  <p>"My dear Mr. Stuart, what a sentimental speech, and sillier even than it is
                     sentimental. Marry and are happy! They marry no doubt, and the pig lives in the
                     corner, and every cabin swarms with children, but—<emph>happy!</emph> Charley,
                     I used to think you had one or two grains of common-sense, at least—now I begin
                     to doubt it."</p>
                  <p>"I begin to doubt it myself, since I have had the pleasure of knowing Edith
                     Darrell. I defy mortal man to keep common-sense, or uncommon-sense, long in her
                     company. Poverty and misery, in your lexicon, mean the same thing."</p>
                  <p>"The same thing. There is no earthly evil that can equal poverty."</p>
                  <p>They reached Killarney late in the evening, and drove to the "Victoria." The
                     perfect weather still continued, the moon that had lit their last night at sea,
                     on the wane now, lifted its silver light over the matchless Lakes of Killarney,
                     lying like sheets of crystal light beneath.</p>
                  <p>"Oh, how lovely!" Trix exclaimed. The rest stood silent. There is a beauty so
                     intense as to be beyond words of praise—so sweet, so solemn, as to hush the
                     very beating of our hearts. It was such beauty as this they looked upon
                     now.</p>
                  <p>They stood on the velvety sward—Sir Victor with Trixy on his arm, Charley and
                     Edith side by side. A glowing mass of soft, scarlet drapery wrapped Miss
                     Darrell, a coquettish hat, with a long, black ostrich plume, set off her
                     Spanish face and eyes. They had dined—and when is moonlight half so poetical as
                     after an excellent dinner?</p>
                  <p>"I see two or three boats," remarked Sir Victor. "I propose a row on the
                     lakes."</p>
                  <p>"Of all things," seconded Beatrix, "a sail on the Lakes of Killarney! Edith, do
                     you realize it? Let us go at once, Sir Victor."</p>
                  <p>"Will you come with me, Edith?" Charley asked, "or would you rather go with
                     them?"</p>
                  <p>She looked at him in surprise. How grave his face—how quiet his tone! He had
                     been like this all day, silent, preoccupied, grave.</p>
                  <p>"My very dear Charley, how polite we grow! how considerate of others' feelings!
                     Quite a new phase of your interesting character. I'll go with you,
                     certainly—Mr. Charles<pb n="178-179" xml:id="VAC6448-00000089"/> Stuart, in a
                     state of lamblike meekness, is a study worth contemplating."</p>
                  <p>He smiled slightly, and drew her hand within his arm.</p>
                  <p>"Come, then," he said, "let us have this last evening together; who knows when
                     we shall have another?"</p>
                  <p>Miss Darrell's brown eyes opened to their widest extent.</p>
                  <p>"'This last evening! Who knows when we shall have another!' Charley, if you're
                     meditating flight or suicide, say so at once—anything is better than suspense.
                     I once saw a picture of 'The Knight of the Woful Countenance'—the K. of the W.
                     C. looked exactly as you look now! If you're thinking of strychnine, say so—no
                     one shall oppose you. My only regret is, that I shall have to wear black, and
                     hideous is a mild word to describe Edith Darrell in black."</p>
                  <p>"Hideous!" Charley repeated, "you! I wonder if you could possibly look ugly in
                     anything? I wonder if you know how pretty you are to-night in that charming hat
                     and that scarlet drapery?"</p>
                  <p>"Certainly I know, and charming I undoubtedly must look to wring a word of
                     praise from you. It's the first time in all your life, sir, you ever paid me a
                     compliment. Hitherto you have done nothing but find fault with my looks and
                     everything else."</p>
                  <p>"There is a time for everything," he answers, a little sadly—sadly! and Charley
                     Stuart! "The time for all that is past. Here is our boat. You will steer,
                     Edith? Yes—then I'll row."</p>
                  <p>The baronet and Trix were already several yards off, out upon the shining
                     water. Another party—a large boat containing half-a-dozen, Captain Hammond
                     among them, was farther off still. In this boat sat a girl with a guitar; her
                     sweet voice as she sang came romantically over the lake, and the mountain
                     echoes, taking it up, sang the refrain enchantingly over and over again. Edith
                     lifted up her face to the starry sky, the moonlight bathing it in a glory.</p>
                  <p>"Oh, what a night!" she sighed. "What a bright, beautiful world it is, and how
                     perfectly happy one could be, if—"</p>
                  <p>"One had thirty thousand a year!" Charley suggested.</p>
                  <p>"Yes, exactly. Why can't life be all like this—moonlight, capital dinners, lots
                     of friends and new dresses, a nice boat, and—yes—I will say it—somebody one
                     likes very much for one's companion."</p>
                  <p>"Somebody one likes very much, Edith? I wonder sometimes if you like me at
                     all—if it is in you to like any one but yourself."</p>
                  <p>"Thanks! I like myself, certainly, and first best I will admit. After
                     that—"</p>
                  <p>"After that?" he repeats.</p>
                  <p>"I like <emph>you</emph>. No—keep quiet, Charley, please, you'll upset the
                     boat. Of course I like you—aren't you my cousin—haven't you been awfully
                     kind—don't I owe all this to you? Charley, I bless that night in the snow—it
                     has been the luckiest in my life."</p>
                  <p>"And the unluckiest of mine."</p>
                  <p>"Sir!"</p>
                  <p>"O Edith, let us speak for once—let us understand one another, and then part
                     forever, if we must. Only why need we part at all?"</p>
                  <p>She turns pale—she averts her face from him, and looks out over the radiant
                     water. Sooner or later she has known this must come—it has come to-night.</p>
                  <p>"Why need we part at all?" He is leaning on his oars, and they are floating
                     lightly with the stream. "I don't need to tell you how I love you; you know it
                     well enough; and I think—I hope—you care for me. Be true to yourself, Edith—you
                     belong to me—come to me; be my wife."</p>
                  <p>There is passion in his tone, in his eyes, but his voice is quiet, and he sits
                     with the oars in his hands. Even in this supreme moment of his life Mr. Stuart
                     is true to his "principles," and will make no scene.</p>
                  <p>"You know I love you," he repeats, "as the man in the Cork theatre said the
                     other night: 'I'll go down on my knees if you like, but I can love you just as
                     well standing up.' Edith, speak to me. How can you ever marry any one but
                     me—but me, whose life you saved, My darling, forget your cynicism—it is but
                     lip-deep—you don't really mean it—and say you will be my wife."</p>
                  <p>"Your wife!" She laughs, but her heart thrills as she says it. "Your wife! It
                     would be pleasant, Charley; but, like most of the pleasant things of life, it
                     can never be."</p>
                  <pb n="180-181" xml:id="VAC6448-00000090"/>
                  <p>"Edith!"</p>
                  <p>"Charley, all this is nonsense, and you know it. We are cousins—we are good
                     friends and stanch comrades, and always will be, I hope; but lovers—no, no,
                     no!"</p>
                  <p>"And why?" he asks.</p>
                  <p>"Have I not told you already—told you over and over again? If you don't despise
                     me, and think me heartless and base, the fault has not been my want of candor.
                     My cynicisms I mean, every word. If you had your father's wealth, the fortune
                     he means to leave you, I would marry you tomorrow, and be," her lips trembled a
                     little, "the happiest girl on earth."</p>
                  <p>"You don't care for me at all, then?" he calmly asks.</p>
                  <p>"Care for you! O Charley! can't you see? I am not <emph>all</emph> selfish. I
                     care for you so much that I would sooner die than marry you. For you a marriage
                     with me means ruin—nothing else."</p>
                  <p>"My father is fond of me. I am his only son. He would relent."</p>
                  <p>"He never would," she answered firmly, "and you know it. Charley, the day he
                     spoke to you in Cork, I was behind the window-curtains reading. I heard every
                     word. My first impulse was to come out and confront him—to throw back his
                     favors and patronage, and demand to be sent home. A horrid bad temper is
                     numbered among the list of my failings. But I did not. I heard your calm
                     reply—the 'soft answer that turneth away wrath,' and it fell like oil on my
                     troubled spirit.</p>
                  <p>"'Don't lose your temper,' you said; 'Fred Darrell's daughter and I, won't
                     marry, if that's what you mean.'</p>
                  <p>"I admire your prudence and truth. I took the lesson home, and—stayed behind
                     the curtains. And we will keep to that—you and Fred Darrell's daughter will
                     never marry."</p>
                  <p>"But, Edith, you know what I meant. Good Heavens! you don't for a second
                     suppose—"</p>
                  <p>"I don't for a second suppose anything but what is good and generous of you,
                     Charley. I know you would face your father like a—like a 'griffin rampant,' to
                     quote Trix, and brave all consequences, if I would let you. But I won't let
                     you. You can't afford to defy your father. I can't afford to marry a poor
                     man."</p>
                  <p>"I am young—I am strong—I can work. I have my hands and my head, a tolerable
                     education, and many friends. We would not starve."</p>
                  <p>"We would not starve—perhaps," Edith says, and laughs again, rather drearily.
                     "We would only grub along, wanting everything that makes life endurable, and be
                     miserable beyond all telling before the first year ended. We don't want to hate
                     each other—we don't want to marry. You couldn't work, Charley—you were never
                     born for drudgery. And I—I can't forget the training of my life even for
                     you."</p>
                  <p>"You can't, indeed—you do your training credit," he answered bitterly.</p>
                  <p>"And so," she goes on, her face drooping, "don't be angry; you'll thank me for
                     this some day. Let it be all over and done with to night, and never be spoken
                     of more. Oh, Charley, my brother, don't you see we could not be happy
                     together—don't you see it is better we should part?"</p>
                  <p>"It shall be exactly as you wish. I am but a poor special pleader, and your
                     worldly wisdom is so clear, the dullest intellect might comprehend it. You
                     throw me over without a pang, and you mean to marry the baronet. Only—as you
                     are not yet his exclusive property, bought with a price—answer me this: You
                     love me?"</p>
                  <p>Her head drooped lower, her eyes were full of passionate tears, her heart full
                     of passionate pain. Throw him over without a pang! In her heart of hearts Edith
                     Darrell knew what it cost her to be heartless to-night.</p>
                  <p>"Answer me!" he said imperiously, his eyes kindling. "Answer me! That much, at
                     least, I claim as my right. Do you love me or do you not?"</p>
                  <p>And the answer comes very humbly and low.</p>
                  <p>"Charley! what need to ask? You know only too well—I do."</p>
                  <p>And then silence falls. He takes up the oars again—their soft dip, and the
                     singing of the girl in the distant boat, the only sounds. White moonlight and
                     black shadows, islands overrun with arbutus, that "myrtle of Killarney," and
                     frowning mountains on every hand. The words of the girl's gay song come over
                     the water:<pb n="182-183" xml:id="VAC6448-00000091"/>

                  <p>"And folly's all they've taught me!" Charley says at length. "Come what may, it
                     is better that I should have spoken and you should have answered. Come what
                     may—though you marry Sir Victor to-morrow—I would not have the past changed if
                     I could."</p>
                  <p>"And you will not blame me too much—you will not quite despise me?" she pleads,
                     her voice broken, her face hidden in her hands. "I can't help it, Charley. I
                     would rather die than be poor."</p>
                  <p>He knows she is crying; her tears move him strangely. They are in the shadow of
                     Torc Mountain. He stops rowing for a moment, takes her hand, and lifts it to
                     his lips.</p>
                  <p>"I will love you all my life," is his answer.</p>
                  <milestone n="* * * * * * * * *" unit="typography"/>
                  <p>This is how two of the water-party were enjoying themselves. A quarter of a
                     mile farther off, another interesting little scene was going on in another
                     boat.</p>
                  <p>Trixy had been rattling on volubly. It was one of Trixy's fixed ideas that to
                     entertain and fascinate anybody her tongue must go like a windmill. Sir Victor
                     sat and listened rather absently, replied rather dreamily, and as if his mind
                     were a hundred miles away. Miss Stuart took no notice, but kept on all the
                     harder, endeavoring to be fascinating. But there is a limit even to the power
                     of a woman's tongue. That limit was reached; there came a lull and a pause.</p>
                  <p>"The time I've lost in wooing," began the English girl in the third boat. The
                     idea was suggestive; Trixy drew a deep breath, and made a fresh spurt—this time
                     on the subject of the late Thomas Moore and his melodies. But the young baronet
                     suddenly interposed.</p>
                  <p>"I beg your pardon, Miss Stuart," he began hastily, and in a somewhat nervous
                     voice; "but there is a subject very near to my heart on which I should like to
                     speak to you this evening."</p>
                  <p>Trix sat straight up in the stern of the boat, as if she had been galvanized.
                     Her heart gave one great ecstatic thump. "Oh," thought Miss Stuart, "he's going
                     to pop!" I grieve to relate it, but that was the identical way the young lady
                     thought it. "He's going to pop, as sure as I live!"</p>
                  <p>There was a pause—unspeakably painful to Miss Stuart. "Yes, Sir Victor," she
                     faltered in her most dulcet and encouraging accents.</p>
                  <p>"I had made up my mind not to speak of it at all," went on Sir Victor, looking
                     embarrassed and rather at a loss for words, "until we reached England. I don't
                     wish to be premature. I—I dread a refusal so unspeakably, that I almost fear to
                     speak at all."</p>
                  <p>What was Miss Stuart to say to this? What could any well-trained young lady
                     say?</p>
                  <p>"Good gracious me!" (this is what she thought,) "why don't he speak out, and
                     not go beating about the bush in this ridiculous manner! What's he afraid of?
                     Refusal, indeed! Stuff and nonsense!"</p>
                  <p>"It is only of late," pursued Sir Victor Catheron, "that I have quite realized
                     my own feelings, and then when I saw the attention paid by another, and
                     received with evident pleasure, it was my jealousy first taught me that I
                     loved."</p>
                  <p>"He means Captain Hammond," thought Trixy; "he's jealous of him, as sure as a
                     gun. How lucky we met him at Macroom."</p>
                  <p>"And yet," again resumed the baronet, with a faint smile, "I don't quite
                     despair. I am sure, Miss Stuart, I have no real cause."</p>
                  <p>"No-o-o, I think not," faltered Miss Stuart.</p>
                  <p>"And when I address myself to your father and mother—as I shall very soon—you
                     think, Miss Stuart, <emph>they</emph> will also favor my suit?"</p>
                  <p>"<emph>They</emph> favor his suit?" thought Trix, "good Heaven above! was ever
                     earthly modesty like this young man's?" But aloud, still in the trembling tones
                     befitting the occasion, "I—think so—I <emph>know</emph> so, Sir Victor. It will
                     be only too much honor, I'm sure."</p>
                  <pb n="184-185" xml:id="VAC6448-00000092"/>
                  <p>"And—oh, Miss Stuart—Beatrix—if you will allow me to call you so—you think that
                     when I speak—when I ask—I will be accepted?"</p>
                  <p>"He's a fool!" thought Beatrix, with an inward burst. "A bashful, ridiculous
                     fool! Why, in the name of all that's namby-pamby, doesn't he pop the question,
                     like a man, and have done with it? Bashfulness is all very well—nobody likes a
                     little of it better than I do; but there is no use running it into the
                     ground."</p>
                  <p>"You are silent," pursued Sir Victor. "Miss Stuart, it is not possible that I
                     am too late, that there is a previous engagement?"</p>
                  <p>Miss Stuart straightened herself up, lifted her head, and smiled. She smiled in
                     a way that would have driven a lover straight out of his senses.</p>
                  <p>"Call me Beatrix, Sir Victor; I like it best from my friends—from—from
                        <emph>you</emph>. No, there is no previous engagement, and" (archly, this)
                     "I am quite sure Sir Victor Catheron need never fear a refusal."</p>
                  <p>"Thanks." And precisely as another young gentleman was doing in the shadow of
                     the "Torc," Sir Victor did in the shadow of the "Eagle's Nest." He lifted his
                     fair companion's hand to his lips, and kissed it.</p>
                  <p>After that of course there was silence. Trixy's heart was full of joy—pure,
                     unadulterated joy, to bursting. Oh, to be out of this, and able to tell pa and
                     ma, and Charley, and Edith, and everybody! Lady Catheron! "Beatrix—Lady
                     Catheron!" No—I can't describe Trixy's feelings. There are some joys too
                     intense and too sacred for the Queen's English. She shut her eyes and drifted
                     along in that blessed little boat in a speechless, ecstatic trance.</p>
                  <p>An hour later, and, as the clocks of Killarney were striking ten, Sir Victor
                     Catheron helped Miss Stuart out of the boat, and had led her up—still
                     silently—to the hotel. At the entrance he paused, and said the only
                     disagreeable thing he had uttered to-night. "One last favor, Beatrix," taking
                     her hand and gazing at her tenderly, "I must ask. Let what has passed between
                     us remain between us for a few days longer. I had rather you did not speak of
                     it even to your parents. My aunt, who has been more than a mother to me, is
                     ignorant still of my feelings—it is her right that I inform her first. Only a
                     few days more, and then all the world may know."</p>
                  <p>"Very well, Sir Victor," Beatrix answered demurely; "as you please, of course.
                     I shan't speak to pa or ma. Goodnight, Sir Victor, good night!"</p>
                  <p>May I tell it, Miss Stuart actually gave the baronet's hand a little squeeze?
                     But were they not engaged lovers, or as good? and isn't it permitted engaged
                     lovers to squeeze each other's right hands? So they parted. Sir Victor strolled
                     away to smoke a cigar in the moonlight, and Miss Stuart, with a beatified face,
                     swept upstairs, her high-heeled New York gaiters click-clicking over the
                     ground. Lady Catheron, Lady Catheron! Oh, what would all Fifth Avenue say to
                     this?</p>
                  <p>Sleep was out of the question—it was open to debate whether she would
                        <emph>ever</emph> sleep again. She would go and see Edith. Yes, Edith and
                     Charley had got home before her—she would go and see Edith.</p>
                  <p>She opened the door and went in with a swish of silk and patchouli. The candles
                     were unlit. Miss Darrell, still wearing her hat and scarlet wrap, sat at the
                     window contemplating the heavenly bodies.</p>
                  <p>"All in the dark, Dithy, and thinking by the 'sweet silver light of the moon?'
                     O Edie! isn't it just the heavenliest night?"</p>
                  <p>"Is that what you came in to say, Miss Stuart?"</p>
                  <p>"Don't be impatient, there's a dear! I wanted to tell you how happy I am, and
                     what a delicious—de-li-ci-ous," said Trix, dragging out the sweet syllables,
                     "sail I've had. O Edie! <emph>how</emph> I've enjoyed myself! Did you?"</p>
                  <p>"Immensely!" Edith answered, with brief bitterness, and something in her tone
                     made Trixy look at her more closely.</p>
                  <p>"Why, Edith, I do believe you've been crying!"</p>
                  <p>"Crying! Bosh! I never cry. I'm stupid—I'm sleepy—my head aches. Excuse me,
                     Trix, but I'm going to bed."</p>
                  <p>"Wait just one moment. O Edith," with a great burst, "I <emph>can't</emph> keep
                     it! I'll die if I don't tell somebody. O Edith, Edith! wish me joy, Sir Victor
                     has proposed!"</p>
                  <p>"Trix!"</p>
                  <p>She could just say that one word—then she sat dumb.</p>
                  <p>"O yes, Edith—out in the boat to-night. O Edith!<pb n="186-187"
                        xml:id="VAC6448-00000093"/> I'm so happy—I want to jump—I want to dance—I
                     feel wild with delight! Just think of it—<emph>think</emph> of it! Trixy Stuart
                     will be My Lady Catheron!"</p>
                  <p>She turned of a dead white from brow to chin. She sat speechless with the
                     shock—looking at Trixy—unable to speak or move.</p>
                  <p>"He's most awfully and aggravatingly modest," pursued Beatrix. "Couldn't say
                     plump, like a man and brother, 'Trixy Stuart, will you marry me?' but beat
                     about the bush, and talked of being refused, and fearing a rival, and speaking
                     to ma and pa and Lady Helena when we got to England. But perhaps that's the way
                     the British aristocracy make love. He asked me if there was any previous
                     engagement, and any fear of a refusal, and that rubbish. I don't see,"
                     exclaimed Trixy, growing suddenly aggrieved, "<emph>why</emph> he couldn't
                     speak out like a hero, and be done with it? He's had encouragement enough,
                     goodness knows!"</p>
                  <p>Something ludicrous in the last words struck Edith—she burst out laughing. But
                     somehow the laugh sounded unnatural, and her lips felt stiff and strange.</p>
                  <p>"You're as hoarse as a raven and as pale as a ghost," said Trix. "That's what
                     comes of sitting in draughts, and looking at the moonshine. I'm awfully happy,
                     Edith; and when I'm Lady Catheron, you shall come and live with me
                     always—always, you dear old darling, just like a sister. And some day you'll be
                     my sister in reality, and Charley's wife."</p>
                  <p>She flung her arms around Edith neck, and gave her a rapturous hug. Edith
                     Darrell unclasped her arms and pushed her away.</p>
                  <p>"I'm tired, Trix; I'm cold." She shivered from head to foot. "I want to go to
                     bed."</p>
                  <p>"But won't you say something, Dithy? Won't you wish me joy?"</p>
                  <p>"I—wish—you joy."</p>
                  <p>Her lips kept that strange feeling of stiffness—her face had lost every trace
                     of color. Oh, to be alone and free from Trix!</p>
                  <p>"You say it as if you didn't mean it," said Trix indignantly, getting up and
                     moving to the door. "You look half-frozen, and as white as a sheet. I should
                     advise you to shut the window and go to bed."</p>
                  <p>She was gone. Edith drew a long breath—a long, tired, heavy sigh. So! that was
                     over—and it was Trix, after all.</p>
                  <p>Trix, after all! How strangely it sounded—it stunned her. Trix, after all and
                     she had made sure it was to be herself. He had looked at her, he had spoken to
                     her, as he had never looked or spoken to Trix. His color had risen like a
                     girl's at her coming—she had felt his heart bound as she leaned on his arm. And
                     it was Trix, after all!</p>
                  <p>She laid her arm upon the window-sill, and her face down upon it, feeling
                     sick—sick—that I should have to write it!—with anger and envy. She was Edith
                     Darrell, the poor relation, still—and Trix was to be Lady Catheron.</p>
                  <p>"A pretty heroine!" cries some "gentle reader," looking angrily up; "a nasty,
                     envious, selfish creature. Not the sort of a heroine <emph>we're</emph> used
                     to." Ah! I know that—none better; but then pure and perfect beings, who are
                     ready to resign their lovers and husbands to make other women happy, are to be
                     found in—books, and nowhere else. And thinking it over and putting yourself in
                     her place—honestly, now!—wouldn't you have been envious yourself?</p>

                     London, my dear Mrs. Stuart—not a day less."</p>
                  <p>Thus Lady Helena Powyss, eight days later, seated luxuriously in the
                     first-class carriage, and flying along by express train between Dublin and
                     Kingston, <foreign xml:lang="FRA">en route</foreign> for Cheshire.</p>
                  <p>They had "done" the south of Ireland, finished the Lakes, spent a pleasant
                     half-week in Dublin, and now, in the light of the May afternoon, were flying
                     along to meet the channel boat.</p>
                  <pb n="188-189" xml:id="VAC6448-00000094"/>
                  <p>Captain Hammond was of the party still, and included in the invitation to
                     Powyss Place. He sat between Lady Helena and Sir Victor now—Miss Stuart, in
                     charming travelling costume, in the sunny seat next the window. On the opposite
                     seat, at the other extreme end, sat Edith Darrell, her eyes riveted upon the
                     pages of a book.</p>
                  <p>Since that night in the boat Miss Stuart had quietly but resolutely taken
                     entire possession of Sir Victor. He was hers—she had the right. If a gentleman
                     is modest to a fault, mayn't a lady overstep, by an inch or two, the line that
                     Mrs. Grundy draws, and meet him half way? There is an adage about helping a
                     lame dog over a stile—that work of mercy is what Trixy was doing now.</p>
                  <p>Before she left her room on the ensuing morning following that
                     never-to-be-forgotten night, Edith had entered and taken Trix in her arms and
                     kissed her.</p>
                  <p>"I was stupid and out of sorts last night, Trixy," she had said. "If I seemed
                     churlish, I ask your pardon, dear, with all my heart. I was surprised—I don't
                     mind owning <emph>that</emph>—and perhaps a little, just a little, envious. But
                     all that is over now, and I <emph>do</emph> wish you joy and happiness from the
                     bottom of my heart. You're the best and dearest girl in the world, and deserve
                     your fairy fortune."</p>
                  <p>And she had meant it. Trix <emph>was</emph> one of the best and dearest girls
                     in the world, and if Sir Victor preferred her to herself, what right had she to
                     grudge her her luck. Against the baronet himself, she felt anger deep and
                     strong still. How dared he seek her out as he had done, select her for his
                     confidante, and look love in fifty different ways, when he meant to marry Trix?
                     What a fool she might have made of herself had she been a whit less proud than
                     she was. Since then she had avoided him; in no marked manner, perhaps, but she
                        <emph>had</emph> avoided him. He should pour no more family confidences into
                     her ear, that she resolved. He belonged to Trix—let him talk to Trix, then; she
                     wanted no other girl's lover. If he felt this avoidance, he showed no sign.
                     Perhaps he thought Miss Stuart had dropped some hint—girls, despite their
                     promises, have been known to do such things—and this change was becoming
                     maidenly reserve. Sir Victor liked maidenly reserve—none of your Desdemonas,
                     who meet their Othellos half way, for him. Trixy's unremitting attentions were
                     sisterly, of course. He felt grateful accordingly, and strove to repay her in
                     kind. One other thing he observed, too, and with great complacency—the
                     friendship between Miss Darrell and her Cousin Charley had come to an end. That
                     is to say, they rather kept aloof from each other—beyond the most ordinary
                     attention, Mr. Stuart seemed to have nothing whatever to say to his cousin.
                     This was as it should be; certainly Beatrix must have dropped that very
                     judicious hint. He was glad he had spoken to her.</p>
                  <p>They reached Kingston in the early twilight, and embarked. It was rough
                     crossing, of course. Trix was seized with agonies of <foreign xml:lang="FRA"
                        >mal de mer</foreign> once more. Edith waited upon her assiduously. Mrs.
                     Stuart and Lady Helena had a stewardess apiece. Happily, if severe, it was
                     short; before midnight they were at Holyhead, and on the train once more. Then
                     off—flying through Wales—whirling by mountains—illuminated glass stations—the
                     broad sea to their left, asleep under the stars, the spray at times almost in
                     their faces. Past villages, ruins, castles, and cottages, and at two in the
                     morning thundering into the big station at Chester.</p>
                  <p>Two carriages awaited them at the Chester station. Into one entered Mr. and
                     Mrs. Stuart, Sir Victor, and Beatrix; into the other, Lady Helena, Edith,
                     Charley, and Captain Hammond. They drove away through quiet, quaint Chester,
                     "rare old city of Chester," with its wonderful walls, its curious old
                     streets—looking like set scenes in a theatre to American eyes—glimpses of the
                     peaceful Dee, glimpses of Curson Park, with its stately villas; away for miles
                     over a country road, then Chesholm at three in the morning, silent and asleep.
                     Presently an endless stretch of ivied wall appears in view, inclosing a
                     primeval forest, it seems to Edith; and Lady Helena sits up and rubs her eyes,
                     and says it is Catheron Royals. The girl leans forward and strains her eyes,
                     but can make out nothing in the darkness save that long line of wall and waving
                     trees. This is to be Trixy's home, she thinks—happy Trixy! Half an hour more of
                     rapid driving, and they are at Powyss Place, and their journey is at an
                     end.</p>
                  <p>They emerge from the chill darkness of dawning day into<pb n="190-191"
                        xml:id="VAC6448-00000095"/> a blaze of light—into a vast and stately
                     entrance-hall. A long file of servants are drawn up to receive them. And
                     "Welcome to Powyss Place," Lady Helena says with kind courtesy. "I can only
                     wish your visit may be as pleasant to you as you made mine in New York."</p>
                  <p>Without changing their dresses, they are ushered into a lofty and handsome
                     dining-room. More brilliant lights, more silent, respectful servants, a round
                     table luxuriously spread. They sit down; forget they are tired and sleepy; eat,
                     drink, and are merry; and it is five, and quite day, before they were shown up
                     to their rooms. Then, hasty disrobing, hasty lying down, and all are at peace
                     in the land of dreams.</p>
                  <p>Next day, somewhere about noon, Miss Stuart, clicking along in her
                     narrow-soled, preposterously high-heeled boots, over a polished oaken corridor,
                     as black as ebony, and several degrees more slippery than ice, lost her
                     footing, as might be imagined, and came down, with an unearthly screech, on one
                     ankle. Of course the ankle was sprained; of course every one flew to the
                     rescue. Sir Victor was first on the field, and in Sir Victor's arms Miss Stuart
                     was lifted, and borne back to her room. Luckily it was near, or even Sir
                     Victor's chivalry and muscular development would not have been equal to it, for
                     Trix was a "fine woman." The ankle was bathed and bandaged, the invalid's
                     breakfast brought up—everything done for her comfort that it was possible to
                     do; and in the midst of their fussing, having cried a great deal, Miss Stuart
                     suddenly dropped off asleep. Edith came out of the room looking pale and tired.
                     In the slippery passage she encountered Sir Victor waiting.</p>
                  <p>"I have waylaid you on purpose, Miss Darrell," he said, smiling, "lest you
                     should meet with a mishap too. A carpet shall be placed here immediately. You
                     look pale—are you ill?"</p>
                  <p>There was a solicitude in his face, a tremulous, suppressed tenderness in the
                     commonplace question, a look in his eyes that had no business in the eyes of
                     another young lady's betrothed. But Edith felt too fagged and spiritless just
                     at present to notice.</p>
                  <p>"I feel well enough; nothing is ever the matter with me; but I <emph>am</emph>
                     rather stupid. Stupidity," she said, with her old laugh, "is fast becoming my
                     normal state."</p>
                  <p>"You will come with me for a walk, will you not?" he asked. "The park is very
                     well worth seeing. To-morrow, Miss Stuart's sprain permitting, we will all
                     visit Catheron Royals. Do come, Miss Darrell; it will do you a world of
                     good."</p>
                  <p>She hesitated a moment, then went. What difference did it make? Trix wouldn't
                     be jealous now. What difference did anything make, for that matter? She was
                     dull and low-spirited; she needed a walk in the fine fresh air. So they went on
                     that fateful walk, that walk that was to be like no other in all Edith
                     Darrell's life.</p>
                  <p>It was a perfect May day, an English May day; the grass, green beyond all
                     ordinary greenness, the fragrant hawthorn hedges scenting the air, the thrush
                     and the linnet singing in the trees, cowslips and daisies dotting the sward. A
                     fresh, cool breeze swept over the uplands, and brought a faint trace of life
                     and color into Edith's dark pale cheeks.</p>
                  <p>"This is the Lime Walk—the prettiest at Powyss Place, to my mind." This was the
                     young baronet's first commonplace remark. "If you will ascend the eminence
                     yonder, Miss Darrell, I think I can point out Catheron Royals; that is, if you
                     think it worth the trouble."</p>
                  <p>It was all the same to Edith—the Lime Walk, the eminence, or any other quarter
                     of the park. She took Sir Victor's arm, as he seemed to expect it, and went
                     with him slowly up the elevation. Pale, weary, listless, she might be, but how
                     charmingly pretty she looked in the sparkling sunshine, the soft wind blowing
                     back her loose brown hair, kindling into deeper light her velvety-brown eyes,
                     bringing a sea-shell pink into each creamy cheek. Beautiful beyond all ordinary
                     beauty of womanhood, it seemed to Sir Victor Catheron.</p>
                  <p>"It is a wonderfully pretty place," she said. "I should think you English
                     people, whose ancestors, time out of mind, have lived and died here, would grow
                     to love every ivy-clad stone, every brave old tree. If I were not Alexander I
                     would be Diogenes—if I were not an American girl, I would be an English
                     miss."</p>
                  <p>She laughed and looked up at him, her spirits rising in<pb n="192-193"
                        xml:id="VAC6448-00000096"/> the sunshine and the free, fresh air. His eyes
                     were fixed upon her face—passionate admiration, passionate love, written in
                     them far too plainly for any girl on earth not to read. And yet—he had proposed
                     to Trix.</p>
                  <p>"You would?" he eagerly exclaimed. "Miss Darrell, do I understand you to say
                     you could live in England all your life—give up America and your friends, and
                     pass your life here?"</p>
                  <p>She shrugged her shoulders.</p>
                  <p>"It would be no great sacrifice. Apart from my father, there isn't a soul in
                     all wide America I care a farthing for, and your English homes are very
                     charming."</p>
                  <p>The last barrier broke down. He had not meant to speak—he had meant to be very
                     prudent and formal—to tell Lady Helena first, to refer the matter to Mr. Stuart
                     next. Now all prudence and formality were swept away. Her hands were in his—he
                     was speaking with his whole heart in every word.</p>
                  <p>"Then stay and share an English home—share <emph>mine</emph> Edith, I love
                     you—I have loved you, I think, since I saw you first. Will you be my wife?"</p>
                  <p>Alas for Trix!—that was Edith's first thought. To burst out laughing—that was
                     Edith's first impulse. Not in triumph or exultation—just at this moment she
                     felt neither—but at the awful blunder Trix had made; for Trix had made a
                     blunder, that was clear as day, else Sir Victor Catheron had never said those
                     words.</p>
                  <p>"I meant to have spoken to Lady Helena and Mr. Stuart first," Sir Victor went
                     on; "but that is all over now. I can't wait longer; I must take my sentence
                     from your lips. I love you! What more can I say? You are the first my lips have
                     ever said it to—the first my heart has ever felt it for. Edith, tell me, may I
                     hope?"</p>
                  <p>She stood silent. They were on the summit of the hill. Away, far off, she could
                     see the waving trees and tall chimneys of a stately mansion—Catheron Royals, no
                     doubt. It looked a very grand and noble place; it might be her home for
                     life—she who, in one sense, was homeless. A baronet stood beside her, offering
                     her rank and wealth—she, penniless, pedigreeless Edith Darrell! All the dreams
                     of life were being realized, and in this hour she felt neither triumph nor
                     elation. She stood and listened, the sunlight on her gravely beautiful face,
                     with vague wonder at herself for her apathy.</p>
                  <p>"Edith!" he cried out, "don't tell me I am too late—that some one has been
                     before me and won your heart. I <emph>couldn't</emph> bear it! Your cousin
                     assured me that when I spoke the answer would be favorable. I spoke to her that
                     night in Killarney—I did not mention your name, but she understood me
                     immediately. I told her I meant to speak as soon as we reached England. I asked
                     her if she thought there was hope for me, and she—"</p>
                  <p>The passionate eagerness, the passionate love and fear within him checked his
                     words suddenly. He stopped for a moment, and turned away.</p>
                  <p>"O Trixy! Trixy!" was Edith's thought; and ridiculous and out of place as the
                     emotion was, her only desire still was an almost uncontrollable desire to laugh
                     outright. What a horrible—what an unheard-of blunder the child had made!</p>
                  <p>She stood tracing figures on the grass with the point of her parasol, feeling
                     strangely apathetic still. If her life had depended on it, she could hardly
                     have accepted Sir Victor then. By and by she might feel half wild with
                     exultation—not now.</p>
                  <p>He waited for the answer that did not come. Then he turned from her, pale with
                     despair.</p>
                  <p>"I see how it is," he said, trying, not quite successfully, to steady his
                     voice; "I am too late. You love your cousin, and are engaged to him. I feared
                     it all along."</p>
                  <p>The brown starry eyes, lifted slowly from the grass and looked at him.</p>
                  <p>"My cousin? You mistake, Sir Victor; I am engaged to no one. I"—she set her
                     lips suddenly and looked away at the trees and the turrets of Catheron Royals,
                     shining in the brilliant sun—"I love no one."</p>
                  <p>"No one, Edith! Not even me?"</p>
                  <p>"Not even you, Sir Victor. How could I? Why should I? I never dreamed of
                     this."</p>
                  <p>"Never dreamed of this!" he repeated, in amaze; "when you must have seen—must
                     have known—"</p>
                  <p>She interrupted him, a faint smile curling her lips.</p>
                  <pb n="194-195" xml:id="VAC6448-00000097"/>
                  <p>"I thought it was Trixy," she said.</p>
                  <p>"Miss Stuart! Then she has told you nothing of that night at Killarney—I really
                     imagined she had. Miss Stuart has been my kind friend, my one confidante and
                     sympathizer. No sister could be kinder in her encouragement and comfort than
                     she."</p>
                  <p>"O poor Trix—a sister!" Edith thought, and in spite of every effort, the laugh
                     she strove so hard to suppress dimpled the corners of her mouth.
                        "<emph>Won't</emph> there be a scene when you hear all this!"</p>
                  <p>"For pity's sake, Edith, speak to me!" the young man exclaimed. "I love you—my
                     life will be miserable without you. If you are free, why may I not hope? See! I
                     don't even ask you to love me now. I will wait; I will be patient. My love is
                     so great that it will win yours in return. O darling! say you will be my
                     wife."</p>
                  <p>Her hands were in his. The fervor, the passion within him almost frightened
                     her.</p>
                  <p>"Sir Victor, I—I hardly know what to say. I wonder that you care for me. I
                     wonder you want to marry me. I am not your equal; I have neither rank, nor
                     wealth, nor descent.</p>
                  <p>"You have the beauty and the grace of a goddess—the goodness of an angel; I ask
                     nothing more. You are the mate of a prince; and I love you. Everything is said
                     in that."</p>
                  <p>"Lady Helena will never consent."</p>
                  <p>"Lady Helena will consent to anything that will make me happy. The whole
                     happiness or misery of my life lies in your hands. <emph>Don't</emph> say no,
                     Edith—don't, for Heaven's sake. I could not bear it—I cannot lose you; I
                        <emph>will</emph> not!" he cried, almost fiercely.</p>
                  <p>She smiled faintly again, and that lovely rose-pink blush of hers deepened in
                     her checks. It was very nice indeed to be wooed in this fiery fashion.</p>
                  <p>"<foreign xml:lang="LAT">Fortes fortuna juvat</foreign>," she said, laughing.
                     "I learned enough Latin, you see, to know that fortune assists the brave.
                     People who won't have 'no' for an answer must have 'yes,' of course."</p>
                  <p>"And it is 'yes!' Edith—"</p>
                  <p>"Be quiet, Sir Victor; it is not 'yes' just yet, neither is it 'no.' You must
                     let me think all this over; my head is giddy with your vehemence. Give me—let
                     me see—until to-morrow. I can't answer now."</p>
                  <p>"But, Edith—"</p>
                  <p>"That much is due to me," she interposed, proudly; "remember, I have not
                     expected this. You have surprised me this morning more than I can say. I am
                     proud and grateful for your preference and the honor you have done me, but—I am
                     honest with you—I don't love you."</p>
                  <p>"But you love no one else. Tell me that again, Edith!"</p>
                  <p>She grew pale suddenly. Again she looked away from him over the sunlit slopes
                     before her.</p>
                  <p>"I am a very selfish and heartless sort of girl, I am afraid," she answered. "I
                     don't know that it is in me to love any one as I ought—certainly not as you
                     love me. If you take me, you shall take me at my true value. I am not an
                     angel—ah, no; the farthest in the world from it—the most selfish of the
                     selfish. I like you very much; it is not hard to do that. To be your wife would
                     be my highest honor, but still I must have time. Come to me to-morrow, Sir
                     Victor, any time, and you shall have your answer. Don't say one word more until
                     then. Now let us go back."</p>
                  <p>He bowed and offered his arm. She took it, and in profound silence they walked
                     back. The one topic that filled him, heart and soul, strength and mind, was
                     forbidden—it was simply impossible for him to speak of any other. For Edith,
                     she walked calmly beside him—her mind a serene blank.</p>
                  <p>They reached Powyss Place—they entered the drawing-room. All were there—Trixy
                     lying on a sofa, pale and interesting, Lady Helena beside her, Charley lounging
                     in the recess of a sunny window. All eyes turned upon the newcomers, Trix's
                     with suspicious jealousy. If Sir Victor were in love with herself, was not his
                     fitting place by her side in this trying hour, instead of meandering about with
                     Dithy? And what business had Dithy monopolizing another girl's lover?</p>
                  <p>"I think I shall ride over to Drexel Court between this and dinner," Sir Victor
                     said. "I promised Hampton—"</p>
                  <p>Lady Helena laughed and interrupted:</p>
                  <p>"And Lady Gwendoline is there—I understand. Go by<pb n="196-197"
                        xml:id="VAC6448-00000098"/> all means, Victor, and give Gwendoline my love.
                     We shall expect you back to dinner."</p>
                  <p>The young man colored like a girl. He glanced uneasily at Edith, but Miss
                     Darrell had taken up a photograph book of literary celebrities, and was
                     immersed therein.</p>
                  <p>Would she understand him, he wondered—would she know it was because he could
                     not endure the suspense at home? How should he drag through all the long, heavy
                     hours between this and to-morrow? And when to-morrow came, if her answer were
                        <emph>no?</emph> He set his teeth at the thought—it could not be no—it
                        <emph>should</emph> not! She loved no one else—she must learn to love
                     him.</p>
                  <p>Captain Hammond and Charley betook themselves to the billiard room. Trixy
                     turned her suspicious eyes upon her cousin.</p>
                  <p>"Where were you and Sir Victor all day, Edith?"</p>
                  <p>"I and Sir Victor have not been any where all day, Beatrix. During the last
                     hour we have been walking in the grounds."</p>
                  <p>"What were you talking about?"</p>
                  <p>"Many things," Miss Darrell responded, promptly. "The beauty of the
                     prospect—the comfort of English homes, and the weather, of course. If I
                     understood short-hand, and had been aware of your anxiety on the subject, I
                     might have taken notes of our conversation for your benefit."</p>
                  <p>"Did you talk of <emph>me?</emph>"</p>
                  <p>"I believe your name was mentioned."</p>
                  <p>"Dith!" in a whisper, and raising herself on her elbow, "did Sir Victor say any
                     thing about—about—you know what."</p>
                  <p>"He did not say one word about being in love with you, or marrying you, if that
                     is what you mean. Now please stop catechising, and let me look at the
                     pictures."</p>
                  <p>Twilight fell-dinner hour came; with it Sir Victor. He looked pale, anxious,
                     tired. He answered all his aunt's inquiries about the Drexel family in the
                     briefest possible manner. His over-fond aunt looked at him a little uneasily—he
                     was so unlike himself, and presently drew him aside, after dinner, and
                     spoke.</p>
                  <p>"Victor what is the matter? Are you ill?"</p>
                  <p>"Ill? No. My dear aunt," smiling, "don't wear that alarmed face—there is
                     nothing the matter with me."</p>
                  <p>"There is something the matter with you. You are pale, you are silent, you eat
                     nothing. Victor, what is it?"</p>
                  <p>"I will tell you to-morrow," he answered. "Spare me until then. I am anxious, I
                     admit, but not even to you can I tell why to-night. You shall know all about it
                     to-morrow."</p>
                  <p>No glimmer of the truth dawned upon her as she left him. She wondered what it
                     could be, but she would not press him further.</p>
                  <p>For Edith—she was in that mood of serene recklessness still. Of to-morrow she
                     neither cared to think, nor tried to think. The tide of her life was at its
                     flood; whither the stream might bear her after this night, just now, she
                     neither knew nor cared. For the present she was free, to-morrow she might be a
                     bondwoman. Her fetters would be of gold and roses; none the less though would
                     they be fetters.</p>
                  <p>She played chess with Sir Victor—<emph>his</emph> hand trembled—hers was
                     steady. Captain Hammond asked her for a Scotch song. She went to the piano and
                     sang, never more clearly and sweetly in her life.</p>
                  <p>"Sing 'Charley he's my darling,'" suggested Trix, maliciously; "it's one of
                     your favorites, I know."</p>
                  <p>Charley was reposing on a sofa near—the wax lights streaming over his handsome,
                     placid face.</p>
                  <p>"Yes, sing it, Dithy," he said; "it's ages since you sang it for me now."</p>
                  <p>"And I may never sing it for you again," she answered, with a careless laugh;
                     "one so soon grows tired of these old songs."</p>
                  <p>She sang it, her eyes alight, her cheeks flushing, thrilling spirit and life in
                     the merry words. Sir Victor stood beside her, drinking in until he was
                     intoxicated by the spell of her subtle witchery.</p>
                  <q>
                     <lg type="quotation">
                        <l>"And Charley he's my darling—</l>

                  </q>
                  <p>Edith's contralto tones rang out. She had never looked so really beautiful,
                     perhaps, before in her life—suppressed excitement lent her such sparkle and
                     color. She finished her song and arose. And presently the evening was over,<pb
                        n="198-199" xml:id="VAC6448-00000099"/> and it was half-past eleven, and one
                     by one they were taking their candles, and straggling off to bed.</p>
                  <p>Edith Darrell did not go to bed. She put the lights away on the toilet-table in
                     the dressing-room, wrapped something around her and sat down by the window to
                     think it out.</p>
                  <p>Should she marry Sir Victor Catheron, or should she not?</p>
                  <p>She cared nothing for him—nothing whatever—very likely she never would. She
                     loved Charley Stuart with all the power of her heart, and just at present it
                     seemed to her she always must. That was how the problem stood.</p>
                  <p>If she married Sir Victor, rank and wealth beyond all her dreams would be hers,
                     a life of luxury, all the joys and delights great wealth can bring. She liked
                     pleasure, luxury, beauty, rank. For love—well, Sir Victor loved her, and for a
                     woman it is always better, safer, to be loved than to love.</p>
                  <p>That was one phase of the case. Here was the other: She might go to Charley and
                     say. "Look here—I care for you so much, that life without you, isn't worth the
                     living. I will marry you, Charley, whenever you like." He would make her his
                     wife. Alone in darkness, her heart thrilled as she thought of it—and the
                     intensest joy of life would be hers for a while. For a while. They would be
                     poor—his father would cast him off—he must, for the first time in his life,
                     begin to work—the old story of pinching and poverty, of darning and mending,
                     would commence over again for her, poor food, poor clothes, all the untold
                     ugliness and misery of penury. Love is a very good and pleasant thing, but not
                     when bought at the price of all the glory and pleasure of the world.</p>
                  <p>She turned from the life she pictured with a shudder of abhorrence. And Charley
                     was not of the stuff the toilers of the earth are made. She would never spoil
                     his life for him as well as her own—not if her heart broke in giving him up.
                     But it would not break—who breaks her heart in these days? She would say "Yes"
                     to-morrow to Sir Victor Catheron.</p>
                  <p>Then for a moment the thread of thought broke, and she sat looking blankly out
                     at the soft spring night.</p>
                  <p>On the day she pledged herself to Sir Victor she must say good-by forever to
                     Charley—so it began again. One house must not contain them both; her word, her
                     plight must be kept bright and untarnished—Charley must go.</p>
                  <p>She tried to think what her life would be like without him. It seemed to her,
                     she could think of no time, in which he had not belonged to her; all the years
                     before that night in the snow were blank and void. And now, for all time, she
                     must give him up.</p>
                  <p>She rose, feeling cold and cramped—she undressed with stiffened fingers, and
                     went to bed. She would think no more, her head ached—she would sleep and
                     forget.</p>
                  <p>She did sleep, deeply, dreamlessly. The sunlight was pouring into her room,
                     flooding it with golden radiance, when she awoke.</p>
                  <p>She sprang up; her heart gave one bound of recollection and rapture. Sir Victor
                     Catheron had asked her to be his wife.</p>
                  <p>Doubt was at an end—hesitation was at an end.</p>

                  <p>Last night a hair might have turned the scale and made her say "No," reckless
                     of consequences—to-day a thousand Charleys would not have influenced her. She
                     would be Lady Catheron.</p>
                  <p>She sang as she dressed. Not the May sunshine itself was brighter than her
                     face. She left her room, she walked down the corridor, down the stairs, and out
                     upon the emerald green lawn.</p>
                  <p>A well-known figure, in a gray suit, stood a few yards off, pacing restlessly
                     about and smoking. He flung away his cigar and hurried up to her. One glance at
                     her smiling face, was enough, his own flushed deep with rapture.</p>
                  <p>"I have come for my answer," he cried. "O Edith, my darling, don't let it be
                     'No.'"</p>
                  <p>She laughed aloud at his vehemence—it was the sort of wooing she liked.</p>
                  <p>"I should like to please you, Sir Victor—what, then, shall it be?"</p>
                  <p>"Yes! a thousand times, yes! Edith, my love—my love—yes!"</p>
                  <p>She was smiling still—she looked him frankly in the eyes<pb n="200-201"

                     looked at the man she loved. She laid in his one slim, brown, ringless
                     hand.</p>
                  <p>"Since you wish it so much, Sir Victor, let it be as you please. Yes!"</p>

                  <head>CHAPTER X.</head>
                  <head type="sub">HOW TRIX TOOK IT.</head>
                  <p>IT was half-past twelve, by all the clocks and watches of Powyss Place. Miss
                     Stuart sat alone, in the pleasant boudoir or sitting-room, assigned her, her
                     foot on an ottoman, a novel in her hand, a frown on her brow, and most
                     beautifully dressed. In solitary state, at half-past ten, she had breakfasted,
                     waited upon by the trimmest of English handmaidens in smiles and lace cap. The
                     breakfast had been removed for over an hour, and still Miss Stuart sat
                     alone.</p>
                  <p>Her mamma had called to see her, so had Lady Helena, but <emph>they</emph> did
                     not count. She wanted somebody else, and that somebody did not come. Her novel
                     was interesting and new, but she could not read; her troubles were too many and
                     great.</p>
                  <p>First, there was her ankle that pained her, and Trixy did not like pain.
                     Secondly, it was quite impossible she could venture to stand upon it for the
                     next three days, and who was to watch Sir Victor during those three days?
                     Thirdly, next week Lady Helena gave a large party, and at that party it was
                     morally and physically impossible she could play any other part than that of
                     wall-flower; she who was one of the best waltzers, and loved waltzing better
                     than any other girl in New York. Is it any wonder, then, that an absorbing
                     novel failed to absorb her?</p>
                  <p>The door opened and Edith came in. At all times and in all array, Miss Darrell
                     must of necessity look handsome. This morning in crisp muslin and rose-colored
                     ribbons, a flush on her cheeks and a sparkle in her eyes, Miss Darrell was
                     something more than handsome—she was beautiful. Something, that was more the
                     memory of a smile, than a smile itself, lingered on her lips—she was so
                     brightly pretty, so fresh, so fair, that it was a pleasure only to look at
                     her.</p>
                  <p>"Good morning, Trixy," she said. "How is our poor dear ankle? It doesn't hurt
                     much, I hope?"</p>
                  <p>She came up behind Miss Stuart's chair, put her arms around her neck, stooped
                     down and kissed her forehead. The frown on Trixy's face deepened—it was the
                     last straw that broke the camel's back, to see Edith Darrell looking so
                     brightly handsome, privileged to go where she pleased, while she was chained to
                     this horrid chair.</p>
                  <p>"It <emph>does</emph> hurt," Trixy responded crossly. "I wish I had never had
                     an ankle, sooner than go spraining it this way. The idea of horrid floors, like
                     black looking-glasses, and slipperier than a skating-rink. Edith, how long is
                     it since you got up?"</p>
                  <p>"Now for it!" thought Edith, and the smile she strove to repress, dimpled her
                     sunny face. Luckily, standing behind Trix's chair, Trix did not see it.</p>
                  <p>"How long? Oh, since nine o'clock. You know I'm not a very early riser."</p>
                  <p>"Did you go straight down to breakfast?"</p>
                  <p>"The breakfast hour was ten. It doesn't take me all that time to dress."</p>
                  <p>"Where did you go then?"</p>
                  <p>"I walked in the grounds."</p>
                  <p>"Edith!" with sudden sharpness, "did you see Sir Victor?"</p>
                  <p>"Yes, I saw Sir Victor."</p>
                  <p>"Where? In the grounds too?"</p>
                  <p>"In the grounds too—smoking a cigar."</p>
                  <p>"Edith!" the sharpness changing to suspicion and alarm. "<emph>You</emph> were
                     with Sir Victor!"</p>
                  <p>"I was with Sir Victor. That is to say, Sir Victor was with
                     <emph>me</emph>."</p>
                  <p>"Bother! What did you talk about? Did he ask after me?"</p>
                  <p>"Ye-e-es," Edith answered doubtfully—the fact being Sir Victor had utterly
                     forgotten Miss Stuart's existence in the dizzy rapture of his acceptance—"he
                     asked for you, of course."</p>
                  <pb n="202-203" xml:id="VAC6448-00000101"/>
                  <p>"Was that all? <emph>He's</emph> a pretty attentive host, I don't think," cried
                     Trixy, with bitterness, "having a young lady laid up by the le—the ankle in his
                     house, and never so much as calling to see if she is dead or alive!"</p>
                  <p>"My dearest Trix," said Edith, struggling with a laugh, "gentlemen don't call
                     upon young ladies in their chambers at break of day, even though they have a
                     sprained ankle. It isn't <foreign xml:lang="FRA">de rigeur</foreign>."</p>
                  <p>"De rigger be blowed! It isn't my chamber; it's my private pallor; and
                     aristocratic as we have got lately, I don't think half-past twelve is the break
                     of day. Edith, upon your word, <emph>did</emph> he say anything about—about—you
                     know what?"</p>
                  <p>"Marrying you? No, Trixy, not a word."</p>
                  <p>She put her arms closer around poor Trixy's neck, and hid her face in Trixy's
                     chestnut hair.</p>
                  <p>"Trix, pet, don't you think there may have been a little—just a little,
                     misunderstanding that night at Killarney?"</p>
                  <p>"Misunderstanding! I don't understand <emph>you</emph>, Edith," Miss Stuart
                     exclaimed, in increasing alarm. "For goodness' sake come round where I can see
                     you, and don't stand there like a sort of 'Get thee behind me, Satan.' I like
                     to look people in the face when I talk to them."</p>
                  <p>"In one moment, dear; please don't be cross. I have something that is not
                     pleasant to say that <emph>you</emph> won't like. I am afraid to tell you.
                     Trix, there <emph>was</emph> a misunderstanding that night."</p>
                  <p>"I don't see how; I don't believe there was. Edith Darrell, what do you mean?
                     He asked me to marry him—at least he told me he was in love with me in a
                     stupid, roundabout way, and asked me if he might hope, and if there was any
                     danger of a refusal, or a rival, when he spoke out, and that balderdash. He
                     said he meant to speak to pa and ma, as plain as print. Now how could there be
                     a misunderstanding in all that?"</p>
                  <p>"It was, as you say, awfully stupid of him, but these Englishmen have such
                     different ways from what we are accustomed to. There was a misunderstanding, I
                     repeat. He means to speak to your father and mother to-day, but—not about
                     you."</p>
                  <p>"Edith!" Trix half sprung up, pale as death and with flashing eyes. "What do
                     you mean? Speak out, I tell you!"</p>
                  <p>"O Trix." She twined her arms still closer around her neck, and laid her cheek
                     coaxingly alongside of Miss Stuart's. "There has been a horrid mistake. All the
                     time in that boat on Killarney lake he was talking of—me!"</p>
                  <p>"Of—you!" The two words drop from Trixy 's ashen lips.</p>
                  <p>"Of me, dear, and he thinks at this moment that you understood him so.
                     Trixy—don't be angry with me—how could I help it—he proposed to me yesterday
                     afternoon."</p>
                  <p>"Proposed to you yesterday afternoon!" Trix repeats the words like one who has
                     been stunned by a blow, in a dazed sort of tone. "And you—refused him,
                     Edith?"</p>
                  <p>"Accepted him, Trixy. I said yes to Sir Victor Catheron this morning in the
                     grounds."</p>
                  <p>Then there was a pause. The ticking of the little Swiss clock, the joyous
                     warble of the thrushes, the soft rustle of the trees sounding preternaturally
                     loud. Beatrix Stuart sat white to the lips, with anger, mortification, amaze,
                     disappointment. Then she covered her face with her hands, and burst into a
                     vehement flood of tears.</p>
                  <p>"Trix! dear Trix!" Edith exclaimed, shocked and pained; "good Heaven, don't
                     cry! Trix, dearest, I never knew you were in love with him."</p>
                  <p>"In love with him!" cried Trix, looking up, her eyes flashing through her
                     tears, "the odious little wishy-washy, drawling coxcomb! No, I'm not in love
                     with him—not likely—but what business had he to go talking like that, and
                     hemming and hawing, and hinting, and—oh!" cried Trix, with a sort of vicious
                     screech, "I should like to tear his eyes out!"</p>
                  <p>"I dare say you would—the desire is both natural and proper," answered Edith,
                     smothering a second desire to laugh; "but, under the circumstances, not
                     admissible. It was a stupid proceeding, no doubt, his speaking to you at all,
                     but you see the poor fellow thinks you understood him, and meant it for the
                     best."</p>
                  <p>"Thought I understood him!" retorted Miss Stuart, with a vengeful glare. "Oh,
                        <emph>shouldn't</emph> I like to make him understand me! The way he went on
                     that night, kissing my<pb n="204-205" xml:id="VAC6448-00000102"/> hand, and
                     calling me Beatrix, and talking of speaking to pa, and meaning <emph>you</emph>
                     all the time, is enough—enough to drive a person stark, staring mad. All
                     Englishmen are fools—there!" exclaimed Miss Stuart, sparks of fire drying up
                     her tears, "and Sir Victor Catheron's the biggest fool of the lot!"</p>
                  <p>"What, Trix! for wanting to marry me?"</p>
                  <p>"Yes, for wanting to marry you. You, who don't care a bad cent for him!"</p>
                  <p>"How many bad cents did you care, Miss Stuart, when you were so willing to be
                     his wife?"</p>
                  <p>"More than you, Miss Darrell, for at least I was not in love with any one
                     else."</p>
                  <p>"And who may Miss Darrell be in love with, pray?"</p>
                  <p>"With Charley," answered Trix, her face still afire. "Deny it if you dare! In
                     love with Charley, and he with you."</p>
                  <p>She was looking up at her rival, her angry gray eyes so like Charley's as she
                     spoke, in everything but expression, that for an instant Edith was
                     disconcerted. She could not meet them. For once in her life her own eyes
                     fell.</p>
                  <p>"Are we going to quarrel, Trix? Is it worth while, for a man you have decided
                     we neither of us care for—we who have been like sisters so long?"</p>
                  <p>"Like sisters!" Trix repeated bitterly. "Edith, I wonder if you are not
                     scheming and deceitful!"</p>
                  <p>"Beatrix!"</p>
                  <p>"Oh, you needn't 'Beatrix' me! I mean it. I believe there has been double
                     dealing in this. He paid attention to me before you ever came to New York. I
                     believe if I hadn't been sea-sick he would have proposed to me on the ship. But
                     I <emph>was</emph> sea-sick,—it's always my luck to be everything that's
                     miserable,—and <emph>you</emph> were with him night and day."</p>
                  <p>"Night and day! Good gracious, Trixy, this is awful!"</p>
                  <p>"You know what I mean," pursued Trix loftily. "You got him in love with you.
                     Then, all the way to Killarney you flirted with Charley—poor Charley—and made
                     him jealous, and jealousy finished him. You're a very clever girl, Edith, and I
                     wish you a great deal of joy."</p>
                  <p>"Thank you; you say it as if you did. I don't take the trouble to deny your
                     charges; they're not worth it—they are false, and you know them to be so. I
                     never sought out Sir Victor Catheron, either in New York, on board ship, or
                     elsewhere. If he had been a prince, instead of a baronet, I would not have done
                     it. I have borne a great deal, but even you may go too far, Trixy. Sir Victor
                     has done me the honor of falling in love with me—for he does love me, and he
                     has asked me to be his wife. I have accepted him, of course; it was quite
                     impossible I could do otherwise. If, at Killarney, he was stupid, and you made
                     a blunder, am I to be held accountable? He does not dream for a moment of the
                     misunderstanding between you. He thinks he made his meaning as clear as day.
                     And now I will leave you; if I stay longer we may quarrel, and I—I don't want
                     to quarrel with you, Trixy."</p>
                  <p>Her voice broke suddenly. She turned to the door, and all the smallness of her
                     own conduct dawned upon Trix. Her generous heart—it <emph>was</emph> generous
                     in spite of all this—smote her with remorse.</p>
                  <p>"Oh, come back, Edith!" she said; "don't go. I won't quarrel with you. I'm a
                     wretch. It's dreadfully mean and contemptible of me, to make such a howling
                     about a man that does not care a straw for me. When I told you,
                        <emph>you</emph> wished me joy. Just come back and give me time to catch my
                     breath, and I'll wish you joy too. But it's so sudden, so unexpected. O Dithy,
                     I thought you liked Charley all this while!"</p>
                  <p>
                     <emph>How</emph> like Charley's the handsome dark gray eyes were! Edith Darrell
                     could not meet them; she turned and looked out of the window.</p>
                  <p>"I like him, certainly; I would be very ungrateful if I did not. He is like a
                     brother to me."</p>
                  <p>"A brother! Oh, bother," retorted Trix, with immeasurable scorn and dignity.
                     "Edith, honor bright! Haven't you and Charley been in love with each other
                     these two years?"</p>
                  <p>Edith laughed.</p>
                  <p>"A very leading question, and a very absurd one. I don't think it is in either
                     your brother or me to be very deeply in love. <emph>He</emph> would find it
                     feverish and fatiguing—you know how he objects to fatigue; and I—well, if love
                        be<pb n="206-207" xml:id="VAC6448-00000103"/> anything like what one reads
                     of in books, an all-absorbing, all consuming passion that won't let people eat
                     or sleep, I have never felt it, and I don't want to. I think that sort of love
                     went out of fashion with Amanda Fitzallen. You're a sentimental goose, Miss
                     Stuart, and have taken Byron and Miss Landon in too large doses."</p>
                  <p>"But you like him," persisted his sister, "don't you, Dithy?"</p>
                  <p>"Like him—<emph>like</emph> him!" Her whole face lit up for a second with a
                     light that made it lovely. "Well, yes, Trix, I don't mind owning that much—I do
                     like Charley—like him so well that I won't marry and ruin him. For it means
                     just that, Trixy—ruin. The day we become anything more than friends and cousins
                     your father would disinherit him, and your father isn't the heavy father of the
                     comedy, to rage through four acts, and come round in the fifth, with his
                     fortune and blessing. Charley and I have common-sense, and we have shaken hands
                     and agreed to be good friends and cousins, nothing more."</p>
                  <p>"What an admirable thing is common-sense! Does Sir Victor know about the
                     hand-shaking and the cousinly agreement?"</p>
                  <p>"Don't be sarcastic, Beatrix; it isn't your forte! I have nothing to confess to
                     Sir Victor when I am married to him; neither your brother nor any other man
                     will hold the place in my heart (such as it is) that he will. Be very sure of
                     that."</p>
                  <p>"Ah! such as it is," puts in Trix cynically; "and when is it to be, Dithy—the
                     wedding?"</p>
                  <p>"My dear Trix, I only said yes this morning. Gentlemen don't propose and fix
                     the wedding-day all in a breath. It will be ages from now, no doubt. Of course
                     Lady Helena will object."</p>
                  <p>"You don't mind that?"</p>
                  <p>"Not a whit. A grand-aunt is—a grand-aunt, nothing more. She is his only living
                     relative, he is of age, able to speak and act for himself. The true love of any
                     good man honors the woman who receives it. In that way Sir Victor Catheron
                     honors me, and in no other. I have neither wealth nor lineage; in all other
                     things, as God made us, I am his equal!"</p>
                  <p>She moved to the door, her dark eyes shining, her head erect, looking in her
                     beauty and her pride a mate for a king.</p>
                  <p>"There is to be a driving-party to Eastlake Abbey, after luncheon," she said;
                     "you are to be carried down to the barouche and ride with your father and
                     mother, and Lady Helena—Charley and Captain Hammond for your cavaliers."</p>
                  <p>"And you?"</p>
                  <p>"Sir Victor drives me."</p>
                  <p>"Alone, of course?" Trixy says, with a last little bitter sneer.</p>
                  <p>"Alone, of course," Edith answers coldly. Then she opens the door and
                     disappears.</p>

                  <head type="sub">HOW LADY HELENA TOOK IT.</head>
                  <p>BUT the driving-party did not come off. The ruins of Eastlake Abbey were
                     unvisited that day, at least. For while Edith and Trixy's somewhat unpleasant
                     interview was taking place in one part of the house, an equally unpleasant, and
                     much more mysterious, interview was taking place in another, and on the same
                     subject.</p>
                  <p>Lady Helena had left the guests for awhile and gone to her own rooms. The
                     morning post had come in, bringing her several letters. One in particular she
                     seized, and read with more eagerness than the others, dated London, beginning
                     "My Dear Aunt," and signed "Inez." While she sat absorbed over it, in deep and
                     painful thought evidently, there came a tap at the door; then it opened, and
                     her nephew came in.</p>
                  <p>She crumpled her letter hurriedly in her hand, and put it out of sight. She
                     looked up with a smile of welcome; he was the "apple of her eye," the darling
                     of her life, the Benjamin of her childless old age—the fair-haired,
                     pleasant-faced young baronet.</p>

                  <p>"Do I intrude?" he asked. "Are you busy? Are your letters <emph>very</emph>
                     important this morning? If so—"</p>
                  <p>"Not important at all. Come in, Victor. I have been wishing to speak to you of
                     the invitations for next week's ball. Is it concerning the driving-party this
                     afternoon you want to speak?"</p>
                  <p>"No, my dear aunt; something very much pleasanter than all the driving-parties
                     in the world; something much more important to me."</p>
                  <p>She looked at him more closely. His face was flushed, his eyes bright, a happy
                     smile was on his lips. He had the look of a man to whom some great good fortune
                     had suddenly come.</p>
                  <p>"Agreeably important, then, I am sure, judging by your looks. What a radiant
                     face the lad has!"</p>
                  <p>"I have reason to look radiant. Congratulate me, Aunt Helena; I am the happiest
                     man the wide earth holds."</p>
                  <p>"My dear Victor!"</p>
                  <p>"Cannot you guess?" he said, still smiling; "I always thought female relatives
                     were particularly sharp-sighted in these matters. Must I really tell you? Have
                     you no suspicions of my errand here?"</p>
                  <p>"I have not, indeed;" but she sat erect, and her fresh-colored, handsome old
                     face grew pale. "Victor, what is it? Pray speak out."</p>
                  <p>"Very well. Congratulate me once more; I am going to be married."</p>
                  <p>He stopped short, for with a low cry that was like a cry of fear, Lady Helena
                     rose up. If he had said "I am going to be hanged," the consternation of her
                     face could not have been greater. She put out her hand as though to ward off a
                     blow.</p>
                  <p>"No, no!" she said, in that frightened voice; "not married. For God's sake,
                     Victor, don't say that!"</p>
                  <p>"Lady Helena!"</p>
                  <p>He sat looking at her, utterly confounded.</p>
                  <p>"It can't be true," she panted. "You don't mean that. You don't want to be
                     married. You are too young—you are. I tell you I won't hear of it! What do boys
                     like you want of wives!—only three-and-twenty!"</p>
                  <p>He laughed good-humoredly.</p>
                  <p>"My dear aunt, boys of three-and-twenty are tolerably well-grown; it isn't a
                     bad age to marry. Why, according to Debrett, my father was only
                     three-and-twenty when he brought home a wife and son to Catheron Royals."</p>
                  <p>She sat down suddenly, her head against the back of a chair, her face quite
                     white.</p>
                  <p>"Aunt Helena," the young man said anxiously, approaching her, "I have startled
                     you; I have been too sudden with this. You look quite faint; what shall I get
                     you?"</p>
                  <p>He seized a carafe of water, but she waved it away.</p>
                  <p>"Wait," she said, with trembling lips; "wait. Give me time—let me think. It
                        <emph>was</emph> sudden; I will be better in a moment."</p>
                  <p>He sat down feeling uncommonly uncomfortable. He was a practical sort of young
                     man, with a man's strong dislike of scenes of all kinds, and this interview
                     didn't begin as promisingly as he had hoped.</p>
                  <p>She remained pale and silent for upward of five very long minutes; only once
                     her lips whispered, as if unconsciously:</p>
                  <p>"The time has come—the time has come."</p>
                  <p>It was Sir Victor himself who broke the embarrassing pause.</p>
                  <p>"Aunt Helena," he said pettishly, for he was not accustomed to have his
                     sovereign will disputed, "I don't understand this, and you will pardon me if I
                     say I don't like it. It must have entered your mind that sooner or later I
                     would fall in love and marry a wife, like other men. That time has come, as you
                     say yourself. There is nothing I can see to be shocked at."</p>
                  <p>"But not so soon," she answered brokenly. "O Victor, not so soon."</p>
                  <p>"I don't consider twenty-three years too soon. I am old-fashioned, very likely,
                     but I do believe in the almost obsolete doctrine of early marriage. I love her
                     with all my heart." His kindling eyes and softened voice betrayed it. "Thank
                     Heaven she has accepted me. Without her my life would not be worth the
                     having."</p>
                  <p>"Who is she?" she asked, without looking up. "Lady Gwendoline, of course."</p>
                  <p>"Lady Gwendoline?" He smiled and lifted his eyebrows.</p>
                  <pb n="210-211" xml:id="VAC6448-00000105"/>
                  <p>"No, my dear aunt; a very different person from Lady Gwendoline. Miss
                     Darrell."</p>
                  <p>She sat erect and gazed at him—stunned.</p>
                  <p>"Miss Darrell! Edith Darrell—the American girl, the—Victor, if this is a
                     jest—"</p>
                  <p>"Lady Helena, am I likely to jest on such a subject? It is the truth. This
                     morning Miss Darrell—Edith—has made me the happiest man in England by promising
                     to be my wife. Surely, aunt, you must have suspected—must have seen that I
                     loved her."</p>
                  <p>"I have seen nothing," she answered blankly, looking straight before
                     her—"nothing. I am only an old woman—I am growing blind and stupid, I suppose.
                     I have seen nothing."</p>
                  <p>There was a pause. At no time was Sir Victor Catheron a fluent or ready
                     speaker—just at present, perhaps, it was natural he should be rather at a loss
                     for words. And her ladyship's manner was the reverse of reassuring.</p>
                  <p>"I have loved her from the first," he said, breaking once more the
                     silence—"from the very first night of the party, without knowing it. In all the
                     world, she is the only one I can ever marry. With her my life will be supremely
                     happy, superbly blessed; without her—but no! I do not choose to think what my
                     life would be like without her. You, who have been as a mother to me all my
                     life, will not mar my perfect happiness on this day of days by saying you
                     object."</p>
                  <p>"But I do object!" Lady Helena exclaimed, with sudden energy and anger. "More—I
                     absolutely refuse. I say again, you are too young to want to marry at all. Why,
                     even your favorite Shakespeare says: 'A young man married, is a man that's
                     marred.' When you are thirty it will be quite time enough to talk of this. Go
                     abroad again—see the world—go to the East, as you have often talked of doing—to
                     Africa—anywhere! No man knows himself or his own heart at the ridiculous age of
                     twenty-three!"</p>
                  <p>Sir Victor Catheron smiled, a very quiet and terribly obstinate smile.</p>
                  <p>"My extreme youth, then, is your only objection?"</p>
                  <p>"No, it is not—I have a hundred objections—it is objectionable from every
                     point. I object to <emph>her</emph> most decidedly and absolutely. You shall
                     not marry this American girl without family or station, and of whom you know
                     absolutely nothing—with whom you have not been acquainted four weeks. Oh, it is
                     absurd—it is ridiculous—it is the most preposterous folly I ever heard of in my
                     life."</p>
                  <p>His smile left his face—a frown came instead. His lips set, he looked at her
                     with a face of invincible determination.</p>
                  <p>"Is <emph>this</emph> all?" he demanded. "I will answer your objections when I
                     have thoroughly heard them. I am my own master—but—that much is due to
                     you."</p>
                  <p>"I tell you she is beneath you—beneath you!" Lady Helena said vehemently. "The
                     Catherons have always married well—into ducal families. Your grandmother—my
                     sister—was, as I am, the daughter of a marquis."</p>
                  <p>"And <emph>my</emph> mother was the daughter of a soap-boiler," he said with
                     bitterness. "Don't let us forget <emph>that</emph>."</p>
                  <p>"Why do you speak to me of her? I can't bear it. You know I cannot. You do well
                     to taunt me with the plebeian blood in your veins—you, of all men alive. Oh!
                     why did you ever see this designing girl? Why did she ever come between
                     us?"</p>
                  <p>She was working herself up to a pitch of passionate excitement, quite
                     incomprehensible to her nephew, and as displeasing as it was
                     incomprehensible.</p>
                  <p>"When you call her designing, Lady Helena," he said, in slow, angry tones, "you
                     go a little too far. In no way has Miss Darrell tried to win me—'tis the one
                     drawback to my perfect happiness now that she does not love me as I love her.
                     She has told me so frankly and bravely. But it will come. I feel that such love
                     as mine must win a return. For the rest, I deny that she is beneath me; in all
                     things—beauty, intellect, goodness—she is my superior. She is the daughter of a
                     scholar and a gentleman; her affection would honor the best man on earth. I
                     deny that I am too young—I deny that she is my inferior—I deny even
                        <emph>your</emph> right, Lady Helena, to speak disparagingly of her. And, in
                     conclusion, I say, that it is my unalterable determination to marry Edith
                     Darrell at the earliest possible hour that I can prevail upon her to fix our
                     wedding-day."</p>
                  <p>She looked at him; the unalterable determination he spoke of was printed in
                     every line of his set face.</p>
                  <p>"I might have known it," she said, with suppressed bitterness<pb n="212-213"
                        xml:id="VAC6448-00000106"/> ness; "he is his father's son. The same
                     obstinacy—the same refusal to listen to all warning. Sooner or later I knew it
                     must come, but not so soon as this."</p>
                  <p>The tears coursed slowly over her cheeks, and moved him as nothing she ever
                     could have said would have done.</p>
                  <p>"For Heaven's sake, aunt, don't cry," he said hurriedly. "You distress me—you
                     make me feel like a brute, and I—really now, I don't think you ought to blame
                     me in this way. Miss Darrell is not a Lady Gwendoline, certainly—she has
                     neither rank nor wealth, but in my sight their absence is no objection
                     whatever. And I love her; everything is said in that."</p>
                  <p>"You love her," she repeated mournfully. "O my poor boy, my poor boy!"</p>
                  <p>"I don't think I deserve pity," Sir Victor said, smiling again. "I don't feel
                     as though I did. And now tell me the real reason of all this."</p>
                  <p>"The real reason?"</p>
                  <p>"Certainly; you don't suppose I do not see it is something besides those you
                     have given. There is something else under all this. Now let us hear it, and
                     have done with it."</p>
                  <p>He took both her hands in his and looked at her—a resolute smile on his fair
                     blonde face.</p>
                  <p>"Troubles are like certain wild animals," he said; "look them straight in the
                     eye and they turn and take to flight. Why should I not marry at twenty-three?
                     If I were marrying any one else—Lady Gwendoline for instance—would my extreme
                     juvenility still be an obstacle?"</p>
                  <p>"You had much better not marry at all."</p>
                  <p>"What! live a crusty old bachelor! Now, now, my good aunt, this is a little too
                     much, and not at all what I expected from a lady of your excellent
                     common-sense."</p>
                  <p>"There is nothing to make a jest of, Victor. It <emph>is</emph> better you
                     should not marry—better the name of Catheron should die out and be blotted from
                     the face of the earth."</p>
                  <p>"Lady Helena!"</p>
                  <p>"I know what I am saying, Victor. <emph>You</emph> would say it too, perhaps,
                     if you knew all."</p>
                  <p>"You will tell me all. Oh yes, you will, You have said too much or too little,
                     now. I must hear 'all,' then I shall judge for myself. I may be in love—still I
                     am amenable to reason. If you can show me any just cause or impediment to my
                     marriage—if you can convince me it will be wrong in the sight of Heaven or man,
                     then, dearly as I love her, I will give her up. But your proof must be strong
                     indeed."</p>
                  <p>She looked at him doubtfully—wistfully.</p>
                  <p>"Would you do this, Victor? Would you have strength to give up the girl you
                     love? My boy, my son, I don't want to be hard on you. I want to see you happy,
                     Heaven knows, and yet—"</p>
                  <p>"I will be happy—only tell me the truth and let me judge for myself."</p>
                  <p>He was smiling—he was incredulous. Lady Helena's mountain, seen by
                        <emph>his</emph> eyes, no doubt, would turn out the veriest molehill.</p>
                  <p>"I don't know what to do," she answered, in agitated tones. "I promised her to
                     tell you if this day ever came, and now it is here and I—oh!" she cried out
                     passionately, "I <emph>can't</emph> tell you!"</p>
                  <p>He grew pale himself, with fear of he knew not what.</p>
                  <p>"You can, you will—you <emph>must!</emph>" he said resolutely. "I am not a
                     child to be frightened of a bogy. What terrible secret is there hidden behind
                     all this?"</p>
                  <p>"Terrible secret—yes, that is it. Terrible secret—you have said it!"</p>
                  <p>"Do you, by any chance, refer to my mother's death? Is it that you knew all
                     these years her murderer and have kept it secret?"</p>
                  <p>There was no reply, She covered her face with her hands and turned away.</p>
                  <p>"Am I right?" he persisted.</p>
                  <p>She rose to her feet, goaded, it seemed, by his persistent questioning into a
                     sort of frenzy.</p>
                  <p>"Let me alone, Victor Catheron," she cried. "I have kept my secret for
                     twenty-three years—do you think you will wring it from me all in a moment now?
                     What right have you to question me—to say I shall tell, or shall not? If you
                     knew all you would know you have no rights whatever—none—no right to ask any
                     woman to share your life—no right, if it comes to that, even to the title you
                     bear!"</p>
                  <p>He rose up too—white to the lips. Was Lady Helena going mad? Had the
                     announcement of his marriage turned<pb n="214-215" xml:id="VAC6448-00000107"/>
                     her brain? In that pause, before either could speak again, a knock that had
                     been twice given unheard, was repeated a third time. It brought both back
                     instantly from the tragic, to the decorum of every-day life. Lady Helena sat
                     down; Sir Victor opened the door. It was a servant with a note on a salver.</p>
                  <p>"Well, sir," the baronet demanded abruptly. "What do you want?"</p>
                  <p>"It's her ladyship, Sir Victor. A lady to see your ladyship on very important
                     business."</p>
                  <p>"I can see no one this morning," Lady Helena responded; "tell her so."</p>
                  <p>"My lady, excuse me; this lady said your ladyship would be sure to see her, if
                     your ladyship would look at this note. It's the lady in mourning, my lady, who
                     has been here to see your ladyship before. Which this is the note, my
                     lady."</p>
                  <p>Lady Helena's face lit up eagerly now. She tore open the note at once.</p>
                  <p>"You may go, Nixon," she said. "Show the lady up immediately."</p>
                  <p>She ran over the few brief lines the note contained, with a look of unutterable
                     relief. Like the letter, it was signed "Inez."</p>
                  <p>"Victor," she said, turning to her nephew and holding out her hand, "forgive
                     me, if in my excitement and haste I have said what I should not. Give me a
                     little time, and everything will be explained. The coming of In—this lady—is
                     the most opportune thing in the world. You shall be told all soon."</p>
                  <p>"I am to understand then," Sir Victor said coldly, "that this stranger, this
                     mysterious lady, is in your confidence; that she is to be received into
                     mine—that she is to be consulted before you can tell me this secret which
                     involves the happiness of my life?"</p>
                  <p>"Precisely! You look angry and incredulous, but later you will understand. She
                     is one of our family—more at present I cannot say. Go, Victor; trust me,
                     believe me, neither your honor nor your love shall suffer at our hands.
                     Postpone the driving-party, or make my excuses; I shall not leave my rooms
                     to-day. To-morrow, if it be possible, the truth shall be yours as well as
                     mine."</p>
                  <p>He bowed coldly—annoyed, amazed, and went. What did all this mean? Up to the
                     present, his life had flowed peacefully, almost sluggishly, without family
                     secrets or mystifications of any kind. And now all at once here were secrets
                     and mysteries cropping up. <emph>What</emph> was this wonderful
                        secret—<emph>who</emph> was this mysterious lady? He must wait until
                     to-morrow, it appeared, for the answer to both.</p>
                  <p>"One thing is fixed as fate," he said to himself as he left the room, "I won't
                     give up Edith, for ten thousand family secrets—for all the mysterious ladies on
                     earth! Whatever others may have done, I at least have done nothing to forfeit
                     my darling's hand. The doctrine that would make us suffer for the sins of
                     others, is a mistaken doctrine. Let to-morrow bring forth what it may, Edith
                     Darrell shall be my wife."</p>

                  <p>AS he descended the stairs he encountered Nixon and a veiled lady in black
                     ascending. He looked at her keenly—she was tall and slender; beyond that,
                     through the heavy crape veil, he could make out nothing. "Mysterious,
                     certainly!" he thought. "I wonder who she is?" He bowed as he passed her; she
                     bent her head in return; then he hastened to seek out Edith, and tell her an
                     important visitor had arrived for Lady Helena, and that the excursion to
                     Eastlake Abbey would be postponed. He was but a poor dissembler, and the girl's
                     bright brown eyes were sharp. She smiled as she looked and listened.</p>
                  <p>"Did you know I could tell fortunes, Sir Victor? Hold out your hand and let me
                     tell you the past. You have been upstairs with Lady Helena; you have told her
                     that Edith Darrell has consented to be your wife. You have asked her sanction
                     to the union, and have been naturally, indignantly, and peremptorily
                     refused."</p>
                  <p>He smiled, but the conscious color rose.</p>
                  <p>"I always suspected you of being an enchantress—now I<pb n="216-217"
                        xml:id="VAC6448-00000108"/> know it. Can you tell me the future as
                     truthfully as the past?"</p>
                  <p>"In this instance I think so. 'You shall never marry a penniless nobody, sir.'
                     (And it is exactly Lady Helena's voice that speaks.) 'Your family is not to be
                     disgraced by a low marriage. This girl, who is but a sort of upper servant,
                     hired and paid, in the family of these common rich American people, is no mate
                     for a Catheron of Catheron. I refuse to listen to a word, sir—I insist upon
                     this preposterous affair being given up.' You expostulate—in vain. And as
                     constant dropping wears the most obstinate stone, so at last will her ladyship
                     conquer. You will come to me one day and say: 'Look here, Miss Darrell, I'm
                     awfully sorry, you know, but we've made a mistake—<emph>I've</emph> made a
                     mistake. I return you your freedom—will you kindly give me back mine? And Miss
                     Darrell will make Sir Victor Catheron her best curtsey and retire into the
                     outer darkness from whence she came."</p>
                  <p>He laughed. Her imitation of his own slow, accented manner of speaking was so
                     perfect. Only for an instant; then he was grave, almost reproachful.</p>
                  <p>"And you know me no better than this!" he said. "I take back my words; you are
                     no seeress. I love my aunt very dearly, but not all the aunts on earth could
                     part me from you. I would indeed be a dastard if a few words of objection would
                     make me resign the girl I love."</p>
                  <p>"I don't know," Miss Darrell answered coolly; "it might be better for both of
                     us. Oh, don't get angry, please—you know what I mean. I <emph>am</emph> a
                     nobody, as your somebodies go on this side. My Grandfather Stuart was a peddler
                     once, I believe; my Grandfather Darrell, a schoolmaster. Not a very
                     distinguished descent. My father by education and refinement is a gentleman,
                     but he keeps a boarding-house. And I am Miss Stuart's paid companion and poor
                     relation. Be wise, Sir Victor, while there is time; be warned before it is too
                     late. I promise not to be angry—to even admire your common-sense. Lady Helena
                     has been as a mother to you; it isn't worth while offending her for me—I'm not
                     worth it. There are dozens of girls in England, high-born, high-bred, and twice
                     as handsome as I am, who will love you and marry you to-morrow. Sir Victor
                     Catheron, let us shake hands and part."</p>
                  <p>She held it out to him with a smile, supremely careless and uplifted. He caught
                     it passionately, his blue eyes afire, and covered it with kisses.</p>
                  <p>"Not for ten thousand worlds! O Edith, how lightly you talk of parting, of
                     giving me up. Am I then so utterly indifferent to you? No; I will never resign
                     you; to call you wife is the one hope of my life. My darling, if you knew how I
                     love you, how empty and worthless the whole world seems without you! But one
                     day you will, you must—one day you will be able no more to live without me than
                     I without you. Don't talk like this any more, Edith; if you knew how it hurts
                     me you would be more merciful, I am sure. Life can hold nothing half so bitter
                     for me as the loss of you."</p>
                  <p>She listened in a sort of wonder at his impassioned earnestness, looking at him
                     shyly, wistfully.</p>
                  <p>"You love me like this?" she said.</p>
                  <p>"A hundred times more than this. I would die for you, Edith. How empty and
                     theatrical it sounds, but, Heaven knows, I would."</p>
                  <p>She passed her hand through his arm and clasped the other round it, her bright
                     smile back.</p>
                  <p>"Don't die," she said, with that smile, and her own rare, lovely blush; "do
                     better—live for me. Ah, Sir Victor, I don't think it will be such a
                        <emph>very</emph> hard thing to learn to—like you!"</p>
                  <p>"My darling! And you will talk no more of parting—no more of giving me up? You
                     don't really wish it, Edith, do you?"</p>
                  <p>"Most certainly not. Would I have accepted you, if I did? I'll never give you
                     up while you care for me like this. If we ever part, the parting shall be your
                     doing, not mine."</p>
                  <p>"<emph>My</emph> doing—<emph>mine?</emph>" he laughed aloud in his incredulity
                     and happiness. "The days of miracles are over, <foreign xml:lang="FRA">belle
                        amie</foreign>, but a summer breeze could more easily uproot these oaks than
                     that. And lest you should think yourself fetterless and free, I will bind you
                     at once." He drew from his pocket a tiny morocco box. "See this ring, Edith; it
                     has been worn by women of our house for the past two centuries—the betrothal
                     ring of the Catherons. Let me place it on your finger,<pb n="218-219"
                        xml:id="VAC6448-00000109"/> never to be taken off until I bind you with a
                     golden circlet stronger still."</p>
                  <p>Her dark eyes sparkled as she looked at it. It was a solitaire diamond of
                     wonderful size and brilliance, like a great drop of limpid water, set in dull
                     red gold.</p>
                  <p>"There is some queer old tradition extant about it," he said, "to the effect
                     that the bride of a Catheron who does not wear it will lead a most unhappy life
                     and die a most unhappy death. So, my dearest, you see how incumbent upon you it
                     is for your own sake to wear it religiously."</p>
                  <p>He laughed, but she lifted to his, two deep, thoughtful, dark eyes.</p>
                  <p>"Did your mother wear it, Sir Victor?"</p>
                  <p>He started, the smile died from his face, his color faded.</p>
                  <p>"My mother?" he answered; "<emph>no.</emph> My father married her secretly and
                     hastily after six weeks' courtship, and of course never thought of the ring.
                     'Lead an unhappy life, die an unhappy death,'" he said, repeating his own
                     words; "she did both, and, to the best of my belief, she never wore it."</p>
                  <p>"An odd coincidence, at least," said Edith, her eyes fixed on the diamond
                     blazing in the sunshine on her hand.</p>
                  <p>A priceless diamond on the hand of Edith Darrell, the brown hand that two
                     months ago had swept, and dusted, and worked unwillingly in the shabby old
                     house at home.</p>
                  <p>"Don't let us talk about my mother," Sir Victor said; "there is always
                     something so terrible to me in the memory of her death. Your life will be very
                     different from hers—my poor mother."</p>
                  <p>"I hope so," was the grave reply; "and in my case there will be no jealous
                     rival, will there? Sir Victor, do you know I should like to visit Catheron
                     Royals. If we have had love-making enough for one day, suppose we walk
                     over?"</p>
                  <p>"I shall never have love-making enough," he laughed. "I shall bore you awfully
                     sometimes, I have no doubt; but when the heart is full the lips must speak. And
                     as to walking—it is a long walk—do you think you can?"</p>
                  <p>"As I am to become a naturalized Englishwoman, the sooner I take to English
                     habits the better. I shall at least make the attempt."</p>
                  <p>"And we can drive back in time for dinner. I shall be delighted to show you the
                     old place—your future home, where we are to spend together so many happy
                     years."</p>
                  <p>They set off. It was a delightful walk, that sunny day, across fields, down
                     fragrant green lanes, where the hedges in bloom made the air odorous, and the
                     birds sang in the arching branches overhead. A long, lovely walk over that
                     quiet high-road, where three-and-twenty years ago, another Sir Victor Catheron
                     had ridden away forever from the wife he loved.</p>
                  <p>With the yellow splendor of the afternoon sunlight gilding it, its tall trees
                     waving, its gray turrets and towers piercing the amber air, its ivied walls,
                     and tall stacks of chimneys, Catheron Royals came in view at last. The fallow
                     deer browsed undisturbed, gaudy peacocks strutted in the sun, a fawn lifted its
                     shy wild eyes and fled away at their approach. Over all, solemn Sabbath
                     stillness.</p>
                  <p>"Welcome to Catheron Royals—welcome as its mistress, my bride, my love," Sir
                     Victor Catheron said.</p>
                  <p>She lifted her eyes—they were full of tears. How good he was—how tenderly he
                     loved her, and what a happy, grateful girl she had reason to be. They entered
                     the house, admitted by a very old woman, who bobbed a curtsey and looked at
                     them with curious eyes. Two or three old retainers took care of the place and
                     showed it to strangers.</p>
                  <p>Leaning on her lover's arm, Edith Darrell walked through scores of stately
                     rooms, immense, chill halls, picture-galleries, drawing-rooms, and chambers.
                     What a stupendous place it was—bigger and more imposing by far than Powyss
                     Place, and over twice as old. She looked at the polished suits of armor, at
                     battle-axes, antlers, pikes, halberds, until her eyes ached. She paced in awe
                     and wonder down the vast portrait-gallery, where half a hundred dead and gone
                     Catherons looked at her sombrely out of their heavy frames. And one day her
                     picture—hers—would hang in solemn state here. The women who looked at her from
                     these walls lay stark and stiff in the vaults beneath Chesholm Church, and
                     sooner or later they would lay <emph>her</emph> stark and stiff with them, and
                     put up a marble tablet recording her age and virtues. She shivered a little and
                     drew a long breath of relief as they emerged into the bright outer day and
                     fresh air once more.</p>
                  <pb n="220-221" xml:id="VAC6448-00000110"/>
                  <p>"It's a wonderful place," she said; "a place to dream, of—a place such as I
                     have only met before in English books. But there is one room among all these
                     rooms which you have not shown me, and which I have a morbid craving to see.
                     You will not be angry if I ask?"</p>
                  <p>"Angry with you?" Sir Victor lifted his eyebrows in laughing surprise. "Speak,
                     Edith, though it were half my kingdom."</p>
                  <p>"It is—" a pause—"to see the room where your mother—Ah!" as he shrank a little,
                     "I beg your pardon. I should not have asked."</p>
                  <p>"Yes, yes, you should. You shall visit at once. I am a coward about some
                     things, I confess—this among others. Come."</p>
                  <p>They went. He took from a huge bunch he carried the key of that long-locked
                     room. He flung it wide, and they stood together on the threshold.</p>
                  <p>It was all dark, the blinds closed, the curtains drawn, dark and deserted, as
                     it had been since that fatal night. Nothing had been changed, absolutely
                     nothing. There stood the baby bassinet, there the little table on which the
                     knife had lain, there beneath the open window the chair in which Ethel, Lady
                     Catheron, had slept her last long sleep. A hush that seemed like the hush of
                     death lay over all.</p>
                  <p>Edith stood silent and grave—not speaking. She motioned him hastily to come
                     away. He obeyed. Another moment, and they stood together under the blue bright
                     sky.</p>
                  <p>"Oh!" Edith said, under her breath, "who did it?"</p>
                  <p>"Who indeed? And yet Lady Helena knows."</p>
                  <p>His face and tone were sombre. How dare they let her lie in her unavenged
                     grave? A Catheron had done it beyond doubt, and to save the Catheron name and
                     honor the murderer had been let go.</p>
                  <p>"Lady Helena knows!" repeated Edith; "it <emph>was</emph> that wicked brother
                     and sister, then? How cruel—how cruel!"</p>
                  <p>"It was not the sister—I believe <emph>that</emph>. That it must have been the
                     brother no doubt can exist."</p>
                  <p>"Is he living or dead?"</p>
                  <p>"Living, I believe. By Heaven! I have half a mind yet to hunt him down, and
                     hand him over to the hangman for the deed he has done!"</p>
                  <p>"An ancient name and family honor are wonderful things on this side of the
                     Atlantic, a couple of million dollars on ours. They can save the murderer from
                     the gallows. We won't talk about it, Sir Victor—it makes you unhappy I see;
                     only if ever I—if ever I," laughing and blushing a little, "come to be mistress
                     of that big, romantic old house, I shall wall that room up. It will always be a
                     haunted chamber—a Bluebeard closet for me."</p>
                  <p>"If ever you are mistress," he repeated. "Edith, my dearest, when will you
                     be?"</p>
                  <p>"Who knows? Never, perhaps."</p>
                  <p>"Edith—again!"</p>
                  <p>"Well, who can tell. I may die—you may die—something may happen. I can't
                     realize that I ever will be. I can't think of myself as Lady Catheron."</p>
                  <p>"Edith, I command you! Name the day."</p>
                  <p>"Now, my dear Sir Victor—"</p>
                  <p>"Dear Victor, without the prefix; let all formality end between us. Why need we
                     wait? You are your own mistress, I my own master; I am desperately in love—I
                     want to be married. I <emph>will</emph> be married. There is nothing to wait
                     for—I <emph>won't</emph> wait. Edith shall it be—this is the last of May—shall
                     it be the first week of July?"</p>
                  <p>"No, sir; it shall not, nor the first week of August. We don't do things in
                     this desperate sort of hot haste."</p>
                  <p>"But why should we delay? What is there to delay for? I shall have a
                     brain-fever if I am compelled to wait longer than August. Be reasonable, Edith;
                     don't let it be later than August."</p>
                  <p>"Now, now, now, Sir Victor Catheron, August is not to be thought of. I shall
                     not marry you for ages to come—not until Lady Helena Powyss gives her full and
                     free consent."</p>
                  <p>"Lady Helena shall give her full and free consent in a week; she could not
                     refuse me anything longer if she tried. Little tyrant! if you cared for me one
                     straw, you would not object like this."</p>
                  <p>"Yes I would. Nobody marries in this impetuous fashion. I won't hear of August.
                     Besides, there is my engagement with Mrs. Stuart. I have promised to talk<pb
                        n="222-223" xml:id="VAC6448-00000111"/> French and German all through the
                     Continent for them this summer."</p>
                  <p>"I will furnish Mrs. Stuart a substitute with every European language at her
                     finger-ends. Seriously, Edith, you must consider that contract at an end—my
                     promised wife can be no one's paid companion. Pardon me, but you must see this,
                     Edith."</p>
                  <p>"I see it," she answered gravely. She had her own reasons for not wishing to
                     accompany the Stuart family now. And after all, why should she insist on
                     postponing the marriage?</p>
                  <p>"You are relenting—I see it in your face," he exclaimed imploringly. "Edith!
                     Edith! shall it be the first week of September?"</p>
                  <p>She smiled and looked at him as she had done early this eventful morning, when
                     she had said "Yes!"</p>
                  <p>"As brain-fever threatens if I refuse, I suppose you must have your way. But
                     talk of the wilfulness of women after this!"</p>
                  <p>"Then it shall be the first of September—St. Partridge Day?"</p>
                  <p>"It shall be St. Partridge Day."</p>

                  <head type="sub">HOW CHARLEY TOOK IT.</head>
                  <p>MEANTIME the long sunny hours, that passed so pleasantly for these plighted
                     lovers, lagged drearily enough for one young lady at Powyss Place—Miss Beatrix
                     Stuart.</p>
                  <p>She had sent for her mother and told her the news. Placid Aunt Chatty lifted
                     her meek eyebrows and opened her dim eyes as she listened.</p>
                  <p>"Sir Victor Catheron going to marry our Edith! Dear me! I am sure I thought it
                     was you, Trixy, all the time. And Edith will be a great lady after all. Dear
                     me!"</p>
                  <p>That was all Mrs. Stuart had to say about it. She went back to her tatting with
                     a serene quietude that exasperated her only daughter beyond bounds.</p>
                  <p>"I wonder if an earthquake would upset ma's equanimity!" thought Trix savagely.
                     "Well, wait until Charley comes! We'll see how he takes it."</p>
                  <p>Misery loves company. If she was to suffer the pangs of disappointment herself,
                     it would be some comfort to see Charley suffer also. And Trix was not a
                     bad-hearted girl either, mind—it was simply human nature.</p>
                  <p>Charley and the captain had gone off exploring the wonders and antiquities of
                     Chester. Edith and Sir Victor were nobody knew where. Lady Helena had a
                     visitor, and was shut up with her. Trix had nothing but her novel, and what
                     were all the novels in Mudie's library to her this bitter day?</p>
                  <p>The long, red spears of the sunset were piercing the green depths of fern and
                     brake, when the two young men rode home. A servant waylaid Mr. Stuart and
                     delivered his sister's message. She wanted to see him at once on important
                     business.</p>
                  <p>"Important business!" murmured Charley, opening his eyes.</p>
                  <p>But he went promptly without waiting to change his dress.</p>
                  <p>"How do, Trix?" he said, sauntering in. "Captain Hammond's compliments, and
                     how's the ankle?"</p>
                  <p>He threw himself—no, Charley never threw himself—he slowly extended his
                     five-feet-eleven of manhood on a sofa, and awaited his sister's reply.</p>
                  <p>"Oh, the ankle's just the same—getting better, I suppose," Trix answered,
                     rather crossly. "I didn't send for you to talk about my ankle. Much you, or
                     Captain Hammond, or any one else cares whether I have an ankle at all or
                     not."</p>
                  <p>"My dear Trix, a young lady's ankle is always a matter of profound interest and
                     admiration to every well-regulated masculine mind."</p>
                  <p>"Bah! Charley, you'll never guess what I have to tell!"</p>
                  <p>"My child, I don't intend to try. I have been sight-seeing all the afternoon,
                     interviewing cathedrals, and walls, and rows, and places, until I give you my
                     word you might knock<pb n="224-225" xml:id="VAC6448-00000112"/> me down with a
                     feather. If you have anything preying on your mind—and I see you have—out with
                     it. Suspense is painful."</p>
                  <p>He closed his eyes, and calmly awaited the news. It came—like a bolt from a
                     bow.</p>
                  <p>"Charley, Sir Victor Catheron has proposed to Edith, and Edith has accepted
                     him!"</p>
                  <p>Charley opened his eyes, and fixed them upon her—not the faintest trace of
                     surprise or any other earthly emotion upon his fatigued face.</p>
                  <p>"Ah—and <emph>that's</emph> your news! Poor child! After all your efforts, it's
                     rather hard upon you. But if you expect me to be surprised, you do your only
                     brother's penetration something less than justice. It has been an evident case
                     of spoons—apparent to the dullest intellect from the first. I have long
                     outlived the tender passion myself, but in others I always regard it with a
                     fatherly—nay—let me say, even grandfatherly interest. And so they are going to
                     'live and love together through many changing years,' as the poet says. Bless
                     you," said Charley, lifting his hand over an imaginary pair of lovers at his
                     feet—"bless you, my children, and be happy!"</p>
                  <p>And this was all! And she had thought he was in love with Edith himself! This
                     was all—closing his eyes again as though sinking sweetly to sleep. It was too
                     much for Trix.</p>
                  <p>"O Charley!" she burst forth, "you <emph>are</emph> such a fool!"</p>
                  <p>Mr. Stuart rose to his feet.</p>
                  <p>"Overpowered by the involuntary homage of this assembly, I rise to—"</p>
                  <p>"You're an idiot—there!" went on Trix; "a lazy, stupid idiot! You're in love
                     with Edith yourself, and you could have had her if you wished, for she likes
                     you better than Sir Victor, and then Sir Victor might have proposed to me. But
                     no—you must go dawdling about, prowling, and prancing, and let her slip through
                     your fingers!"</p>
                  <p>"Prowling and prancing! Good Heaven, Trix! I ask you soberly, as man to man,
                     did you ever see me prowl or prance in the whole course of my life?"</p>
                  <p>"Bah-h-h!" said Trix, with a perfect shake of scorn in the interjection. "I've
                     no patience with you! Get out of my room—do!"</p>
                  <p>Mr. Stuart, senior, was the only one who did <emph>not</emph> take it quietly.
                     His bile rose at once.</p>
                  <p>"Edith! Edith Darrell! Fred. Darrell's penniless daughter! Beatrix Stuart, have
                     you let this young baronet slip through your fingers in this ridiculous way
                     after all?"</p>
                  <p>"I never let him slip—he never was in my fingers," retorted Trix, nearly
                     crying. "It's just my usual luck. I don't want him—he's a stupid noodle—that's
                     what he is. Edith's better-looking than I am. Any one can see that with half an
                     eye, and when I was sick on that horrid ship, she had everything her own way. I
                     did my best—yes I did, pa—and I think it's a little too hard to be scolded in
                     this way, with my poor sprained ankle and everything!"</p>
                  <p>"Well, there, there, child!" exclaimed Mr. Stuart, testily, for he was fond of
                     Trix; "don't cry. There's as good fish in the sea as ever were caught. As to
                     being better-looking than you, I don't believe a word of it. I never liked your
                     dark complected women myself. You're the biggest and the best-looking young
                     woman of the two, by George!" (Mr. Stuart's grammar was hardly up to the
                     standard.) "There's this young fellow, Hammond—his father's a lord—rich, too,
                     if his grandfather <emph>did</emph> make it cotton-spinning. Now, why can't you
                     set your cap for <emph>him?</emph> When the old rooster dies, this young chap
                     will be a lord himself, and a lord's better than a baronet, by George! Come
                     downstairs, Trixy, and put on your stunningest gown, and see if you can't hook
                     the military swell."</p>
                  <p>Following these pious parental counsels, Miss Trix <emph>did</emph> assume her
                     "stunningest" gown, and with the aid of her brother and a crutch, managed to
                     reach the dining-room. There Lady Helena, pale and preoccupied, joined them. No
                     allusion was made at dinner to <emph>the</emph> topic—a visible restraint was
                     upon all.</p>
                  <p>"Old lady don't half like it," chuckled Stuart <foreign xml:lang="FRA"
                        >père</foreign>. "And no wonder, by George! If it was Charley I shouldn't
                     like it myself. I must speak to Charley after dinner—there's this Lady
                     Gwendoline. He's got to marry the upper-crust too. Lady Gwendoline Stuart
                     wouldn't sound bad, by George! I'm glad there's to be a baronet in the family,
                     even if it isn't Trixy. A cousin's daughter's better than nothing."</p>
                  <pb n="226-227" xml:id="VAC6448-00000113"/>
                  <p>So in the first opportunity after dinner Mr. Stuart presented his
                     congratulations as blandly as possible to the future Lady Catheron. In the next
                     opportunity he attacked his son on the subject of Lady Gwendoline.</p>
                  <p>"Take example by your Cousin Edith, my boy," said Mr. Stuart in a large voice,
                     standing with his hands under his coat-tails. "That girl's a credit to her
                     father and family, by George! Look at the match <emph>she's</emph> making
                     without a rap to bless herself with. Now you've a fortune in prospective, young
                     man, that would buy and sell half a dozen of these beggarly lordlings. You've
                     youth and good looks, and good manners, or if you haven't you ought to have,
                     and I say you shall marry a title, by George! There's this Lady Gwendoline—she
                     ain't rich, but she's an earl's daughter. Now what's to hinder your going for
                        <emph>her?</emph>"</p>
                  <p>Charley looked up meekly from the depths of his chair.</p>
                  <p>"As you like it, governor. In all matters matrimonial I simply consider myself
                     as non-existent. Only this, I <emph>will</emph> premise—I am ready to marry
                     her, but not to court her. As you truthfully observe, I have youth, good looks,
                     and good manners, but in all things appertaining to love and courtship, I'm as
                     ignorant as the child unborn. Matrimony is an ill no man can hope to
                     escape—love-making <emph>is</emph>. As a prince in my own right, I claim that
                     the wooing shall be done by deputy. There is her most gracious majesty, she
                     popped the question to the late lamented Prince Consort. Could Lady Gwendoline
                     have any more illustrious example to follow? You settle the preliminaries. Let
                     Lady Gwendoline do the proposing, and you may lead me any-day you please as a
                     lamb to the slaughter."</p>
                  <p>With this reply, Mr. Stuart, senior, was forced for the present to be content
                     and go on his way. Trix, overhearing, looked up with interest:</p>
                  <p>"<emph>Would</emph> you marry her, Charley?"</p>
                  <p>"Certainly, Beatrix; haven't I said so? If a man <emph>must</emph> marry, as
                     well a Lady Gwendoline as any one else. As Dundreary says, 'One woman is as
                     good as another, and a good deal better.'"</p>
                  <p>"But you've never seen her."</p>
                  <p>"What difference does that make? I suppose the Prince of Wales never saw
                     Alexandra until the matter was cut and dry. You see I love to quote lofty
                     examples. Hammond has described her, and I should say from his description she
                     is what Barry Cornwall would call 'a golden girl' in everything except fortune.
                     Hammond speaks of her as though she were made of precious metals and gems. She
                     has golden hair, alabaster brow, sapphire eyes, pearly teeth, and ruby nose.
                     Or, stay—perhaps it was ruby lips and chiselled nose. Chiselled, sounds as
                     though her olfactory organ was of marble or granite, doesn't it? And she's
                     three-and-thirty years of age. I found that out for myself from the Peerage.
                     It's rather an advantage, however, than otherwise, for a man's wife to be ten
                     or twelve years the elder. You see she combines all the qualities of wife and
                     mother in one."</p>
                  <p>And then Charley sauntered away to the whist-table to join his father and
                     mother and Lady Helena. He had as yet found no opportunity of speaking to
                     Edith, and at dinner she had studiously avoided meeting his eye. Captain
                     Hammond took his post beside Miss Stuart's invalid couch, and made himself
                     agreeable and entertaining to that young lady.</p>
                  <p>Trixy's eyes gradually brightened, and her color came back; she held him a
                     willing captive by her side all the evening through. Papa Stuart from his place
                     at the whist table beamed paternal approval down the long room.</p>
                  <p>A silken-hung arch separated this drawing-room from another smaller, where the
                     piano stood. Except for two waxlights on the piano, this second drawing-room
                     was in twilight. Edith sat at the piano, Sir Victor stood beside her. Her hands
                     wandered over the keys in soft, dreamy melodies; they talked in whispers when
                     they talked at all. The spell of a silence, more delicious than words, held the
                     young baronet; he was nearing the speechless phase of the <foreign
                        xml:lang="FRA">grande passion</foreign>. That there <emph>is</emph> a
                     speechless phase, I have been credibly assured again and again, by parties who
                     have had experience in the matter, and certainly ought to know.</p>
                  <p>At half-past ten Lady Helena, pleading headache, rose from the whist-table,
                     said good-night, and went away to her room. She looked ill and worn, and
                     strangely anxious. Her nephew, awaking from his trance of bliss, and seeing her
                     pale face, gave her his arm and assisted her up the long<pb n="228-229"
                        xml:id="VAC6448-00000114"/> stairway to her room. Mrs. Stuart, yawning very
                     much, followed her example. Mr. Stuart went out through the open French window
                     to smoke a last cigar. Captain Hammond and Trix were fathoms deep in their
                     conversation. Miss Darrell, in the inner room, stood alone, her elbow resting
                     on the low marble mantel, her eyes fixed thoughtfully on the wall before her.
                     The twinkle of the tapers lighted up the diamond on her hand, glowing like a
                     miniature sun.</p>
                  <p>"You have been so completely monopolized all evening, Dithy," said a familiar
                     voice beside her, "that there has been no such thing as speaking a word to you.
                     Better late than never, though, I hope."</p>
                  <p>She lifted her eyes to Charley's face, Charley looking as he ever looked to
                     her, "a man of men," handsome and gallant, as though he were indeed the prince
                     they called him. He took in his, the hand hanging so loosely by her side, the
                     hand that wore the ring.</p>
                  <p>"What a pretty hand you have, Edie, and how well diamonds become it. I think
                     you were born to wear diamonds, my handsome cousin, and walk in silk attire. A
                     magnificent ring, truly—an heirloom, no doubt, in the Catheron family. My dear
                     cousin, Trix has been telling me the news. Is it necessary to say I
                     congratulate you with all my heart?"</p>
                  <p>His face, his voice, his pleasant smile held no emotion whatever, save that of
                     kindly, cousinly regard. His bright gray eyes looked at her with brotherly
                     frankness, nothing more.</p>
                  <p>The color that came so seldom, and made her so lovely, rose deep to Edith's
                     cheeks—this time the flush of anger. Her dark eyes gleamed scornfully; she drew
                     her hand suddenly and contemptuously away.</p>
                  <p>"It is not necessary at all, Cousin Charley. Pray don't trouble yourself—I know
                     how you hate trouble—to turn fine phrases. I don't want congratulations; I am
                     too happy to need them."</p>
                  <p>"Yet being the correct thing to do, and knowing what a stickler you are for
                        <foreign xml:lang="FRA">les convenances,</foreign> Edith, you will still
                     permit me humbly to offer them. It is a most suitable match; I congratulate Sir
                     Victor on his excellent taste and judgment. He is the best fellow alive, and
                     you—I <emph>will</emph> say it, though you are my cousin—will be a bride even a
                     baronet may be proud of. I wish you both, all the happiness so suitable a match
                     deserves."</p>
                  <p>Was this sarcasm—was it real? She could not tell, well as she understood him.
                     His placid face, his serene eyes were as cloudless as a summer sky. Yes, he
                     meant it, and only the other day he had told her he loved her. She could have
                     laughed aloud—Charley Stuart's love!</p>
                  <p>On the instant Sir Victor returned. In his secret heart the baronet was
                     mortally jealous of Charley. The love that Edith could not give him, he felt
                     instinctively, had long ago been given to her handsome cousin. There was latent
                     jealousy in his face now, as he drew near.</p>
                  <p>"Am I premature, Sir Victor, in offering my congratulations?" Charley said,
                     with pleasant cordiality; "if so, the fact of Edith's being my cousin, almost
                     my sister, must excuse it. You are a fortunate man, baronet. It would be
                     superfluous to wish you joy—you have an overplus of that article already."</p>
                  <p>Sir Victor's brow cleared. Charley's frankness, Charley's perfect good-humor
                     staggered him. Had he then been mistaken after all? He stretched forth his hand
                     and grasped that of Edith's cousin.</p>
                  <p>She turned suddenly and walked away, a passion of anger within her, flashing as
                     she went a look of hatred—yes, absolute hatred—upon Charley. She had brought it
                     upon herself, she had deserved it all, but how dared he mock her with his
                     smiles, his good wishes, when he knew, he <emph>knew</emph> that her whole
                     heart was in his keeping?</p>
                  <p>"It shall not be in his keeping long," she said savagely, between her set
                     teeth. "Ingrate! More unstable than water! And I was fool enough to cry for him
                     and myself that night at Killarney."</p>
                  <p>It was half-past eleven when she went up to her room. She had studiously
                     avoided Charley all the remainder of the evening. She had demeaned herself to
                     her affianced with a smiling devotion that had nearly turned his brain. But the
                     smiles and the brightness all faded away as she said good-night. She toiled
                     wearily up the stairs, pale, tired, spiritless, half her youth and beauty gone.
                     Farther down the<pb n="230-231" xml:id="VAC6448-00000115"/> passage she could
                     hear Charley's mellow voice trolling carelessly a song: <q>
                        <lg type="quotation">
                           <l>"Did you ever have a cousin, Tom?</l>
                           <l rend="ti-1">And could that cousin sing?</l>
                           <l>Sisters we have by the dozen, Tom,</l>
                           <l rend="ti-1">But a cousin's a different thing."</l>
                        </lg>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Every one went to bed, and to sleep perhaps, but Sir Victor Catheron. He was
                     too happy to sleep. He lit a cigar and paced to and fro in the soft darkness,
                     thinking of the great bliss this day had brought him, thinking over her every
                     word and smile, thinking that the first of September would give him his darling
                     forever. He walked beneath her window of course. She caught a glimpse of him,
                     and with intolerant impatience extinguished her lights and shrouded herself and
                     her wicked rebellion in darkness. His eyes strayed from hers to his aunt's,
                     farther along the same side. Yes, in her room lights still burned. Lady Helena
                     usually kept early hours, as befitted her years and infirmities. What did she
                     mean by "burning the midnight oil" to-night. Was that black lady from London
                     with her still? and in what way was she mixed up with his aunt? What would they
                     tell him to-morrow? What secret did his aunt hold? They could tell him nothing
                     that could in the slightest influence his marriage with Edith, that he knew;
                     but still he wondered a little what it all could be. At one the lights were
                     still burning. He was surprised, but he would wait no longer. He waved his hand
                     towards Miss Darrell's room, this very far-gone young man. "Good-night, my
                     love, my own," he murmured Byronically, and went to bed to sleep and dream of
                     her. And no warning voice came in those dreams to tell Sir Victor Catheron it
                     was the last perfectly happy night he would ever know.</p>

                  <head type="sub">TO-MORROW.</head>
                  <p>TO-MORROW came, gray and overcast. The fine weather which had lasted almost
                     since their leaving New York showed signs of breaking up. Miss Stuart's ankle
                     was so much better that she was able to limp downstairs at eleven, A. M., to
                     breakfast, and resume her flirtation with Captain Hammond where it had broken
                     off last night. Miss Darrell had a headache and did not appear. And, in the
                     absence of his idol and day star, Sir Victor collapsed and ate his morning meal
                     in silence and sadness.</p>
                  <p>Breakfast over, he walked to one of the windows, looking out at the rain, which
                     was beginning to drift against the glass, and wondering, drearily, how he was
                     to drag through the long hours without Edith. He might go and play billiards
                     with the other fellows; but no, he was too restless even for that. What was he
                     to do to kill time? It was a relief when a servant came with a message from his
                     aunt.</p>
                  <p>"My lady's compliments, Sir Victor, and will you please step upstairs at
                     once."</p>
                  <p>"Now for the grand secret," he thought; "the skeleton in the family closet—the
                     discovery of the mysterious woman in black."</p>
                  <p>The woman in black was nowhere visible when he entered his aunt's apartments.
                     Lady Helena sat alone, her face pale, her eyes heavy and red as though with
                     weeping, but all the anger, all the excitement of yesterday gone.</p>
                  <p>"My dear aunt," the young man said, really concerned, "I am sorry to see you
                     looking so ill. And—surely you have not been crying?"</p>
                  <p>"Sit down," his aunt replied. "Yes, I have been crying. I have had good reason
                     to cry for many years past. I have sent for you, Victor, to tell you all—at
                     least all it is advisable to tell you at present. And, before I begin, let me
                     apologize if anything I may have said yesterday on the subject of your
                     engagement has wounded you."</p>
                  <p>"Dear Lady Helena, between you and me there can be<pb n="232-233"
                        xml:id="VAC6448-00000116"/> no talk of pardon. It was your right to object
                     if you saw cause, and no doubt it is natural that Edith's want of birth and
                     fortune would weigh with you. But they do not weigh with me, and I know the
                     happiness of my life to be very near your heart. I have only to say again that
                     that happiness lies entirely with her—that without her I should be the most
                     miserable fellow alive—to hear you withdraw every objection and take my darling
                     to your arms as your daughter."</p>
                  <p>She sighed heavily as she listened.</p>
                  <p>"A wilful man must have his way. You are, as you told me yesterday, your own
                     master, free to do as you please. To Miss Darrell personally I have no
                     objection; she is beautiful, well-bred, and, I believe, a noble girl. Her
                     poverty and obscure birth <emph>are</emph> drawbacks in my eyes, but, since
                     they are not so in yours, I will allude to them no more. The objections I made
                     yesterday to your marriage I would have made had your bride been a duke's
                     daughter. I had hoped—it was an absurd hope—that you would not think of
                     marriage for many years to come, perhaps not at all."</p>
                  <p>"But, Aunt Helena—"</p>
                  <p>"Do I not say it was an absurd hope? The fact is, Victor, I have been a
                     coward—a nervous, wretched coward from first to last. I shut my eyes to the
                     truth. I feared you might fall in love with this girl, but I put the fear away
                     from me. The time has come when the truth must be spoken, when my love for you
                     can shield you no longer. Before you marry you must know all. Do you remember,
                     in the heat of my excitement yesterday, telling you you had no right to the
                     title you bear? In one sense I spoke the truth. Your father—" she gasped and
                     paused.</p>
                  <p>"My father?" he breathlessly repeated.</p>
                  <p>"Your father is alive."</p>
                  <p>He sat and looked at her—stunned. What was she saying? His father alive, after
                     all those years! and he not Sir Victor Catheron! He half rose—ashen pale.</p>
                  <p>"Lady Helena, what is this? My father alive—my father, whom for twenty
                     years—since I could think at all—I have thought dead! What vile deception is
                     here?"</p>
                  <p>"Sit down, Victor; you shall hear all. There is no vile deception—the
                     deception, such as it is, has been by his own desire. Your father lives, but he
                     is hopelessly insane."</p>
                  <p>He sat looking at her, pale, stern, almost confounded.</p>
                  <p>"He—he never recovered from the shock of his wife's dreadful death," went on
                     her ladyship, her voice trembling. "Health returned after that terrible brain
                     fever, but not reason. We took him away—the best medical aid everywhere was
                     tried—all in vain. For years he was hopelessly, utterly insane, never violent,
                     but mind and memory a total blank. He was incurable—he would never reclaim his
                     title, but his bodily health was good, and he might live for many years. Why
                     then deprive you of your rights, since in no way you defrauded him? The world
                     was given to understand he was dead, and you, as you grew up, took his place as
                     though the grave had indeed closed over him. But legally, as you see for
                     yourself, you have no claim to it."</p>
                  <p>Still he sat gazing at her—still he sat silent, his lips compressed, waiting
                     for the end.</p>
                  <p>"Of late years, gleams of reason have returned, fitfully and at uncertain
                     times. On these rare occasions he has spoken of you, has expressed the desire
                     that you should still be kept in ignorance, that he shall ever be to the world
                     dead. You perceive, therefore, though it is my duty to tell you this, it need
                     in no way alarm you, as he will never interfere with your claims."</p>
                  <p>Still he sat silent—a strange, intent listening expression on his face.</p>
                  <p>"You recollect the lady who came here yesterday," she continued. "Victor,
                     looking far back into the past, have you no recollection of some one, fair and
                     young, who used to bend over you at night, hear you say your baby prayers, and
                     sing you to sleep? Try and think."</p>
                  <p>He bent his head in assent.</p>
                  <p>"I remember," he answered.</p>
                  <p>"Do you recall how she looked—has her face remained in your memory?"</p>
                  <p>"She had dark eyes and hair, and was handsome. I remember no more."</p>
                  <p>She looked at him wistfully.</p>
                  <p>"Victor, have you no idea who that woman was—none?"</p>
                  <p>"None," he replied coldly. "How could I, since she was not my mother. I never
                     heard her name. Who was she?"</p>
                  <pb n="234-235" xml:id="VAC6448-00000117"/>
                  <p>"She was the lady you saw yesterday."</p>
                  <p>"Who was the lady I saw yesterday?"</p>
                  <p>She paused a moment, then replied, still with that wistful glance on his
                     face:</p>
                  <p>"Inez Catheron."</p>
                  <p>"What?" Again he half-started to his feet. "The woman who was my mother's rival
                     and enemy, who made her life wretched, who was concerned in her murder! Whom
                        <emph>you</emph> aided to escape from Chesholm jail! The woman who, directly
                     or indirectly, is guilty of her death!"</p>
                  <p>"Sir Victor Catheron, how dare you!" Lady Helena also started to her feet, her
                     face flushing with haughty anger. "I tell you Inez Catheron has been a
                     martyr—not a murderess. She was your mother's rival, as she had a right to
                     be—was she not your father's plighted wife, long before he ever saw Ethel Dobb?
                     She was your mother's rival. It was her only fault, and her whole life has been
                     spent in expiating it. Was it not atonement sufficient, that for the crime of
                     another, she should be branded with life-long infamy, and banished forever from
                     home and friends?"</p>
                  <p>"If the guilt was not hers it was her brother's, and she was privy to it," the
                     young man retorted, with sullen coldness.</p>
                  <p>"Who are you, that you should say whether it was or not? The assassin is known
                     to Heaven, and Heaven has dealt with him. Accuse no one—neither Juan Catheron
                     nor his sister—all human judgment is liable to err. Of your mother's death Inez
                     Catheron is innocent—by it her whole life has been blighted. To your father,
                     that life has been consecrated. She has been his nurse, his companion, his more
                     than sister or mother all those years. <emph>I</emph> loved him, and I could
                     not have done what she has done. He used her brutally—brutally I say—and her
                     revenge has been life-long devotion and sacrifice. All those years she has
                     never left him. She will never leave him until he dies."</p>
                  <p>She sank back in her seat, trembling, exhausted. He listened in growing
                     wonder.</p>
                  <p>"You believe me?" she demanded imperiously.</p>
                  <p>"I believe you," he replied sadly. "My dear aunt, forgive me. I believe all you
                     have said. Can I not see her and thank her too?"</p>
                  <p>"You shall see her. It is for that she has remained. Stay here; I will send her
                     to you. She deserves your thanks, though all thanks are but empty and vain for
                     such a life-long martyrdom as hers."</p>
                  <p>She left him hastily. Profound silence fell. He turned and looked out at the
                     fast-falling rain, at the trees swaying in the fitful wind, at the dull, leaden
                     sky. Was he asleep and dreaming? His father alive! He sat half dazed, unable to
                     realize it.</p>
                  <p>"Victor!"</p>
                  <p>He had not heard the door open, he had not heard her approach, but she stood
                     beside him. All in black, soft, noiseless black, a face devoid of all color;
                     large, sad, soft eyes, and hair white as winter snow—that was the woman Sir
                     Victor Catheron saw as he turned round. The face, with all its settled sadness
                     and pallor, was still the face of a beautiful woman, and in weird contradiction
                     to its youth and beauty, were the smooth bands of abundant hair—white as the
                     hair of eighty. The deep, dusk eyes, once so full of pride and fire, looked at
                     him with the tender, saddened light, long, patient suffering had wrought; the
                     lips, once curved in haughtiest disdain, had taken the sweetness of years of
                     hopeless pain. And so, after three-and-twenty years, Victor Catheron saw the
                     woman, whose life his father's falsity and fickleness had wrecked.</p>
                  <p>"Victor!"</p>
                  <p>She held out her hand to him shyly, wistfully. The ban of murder had been upon
                     her all these years. Who was to tell that in his inmost heart he too might not
                     brand her as a murderess? But she need not have doubted. If any suspicion yet
                     lingered in his mind, it vanished as he looked at her.</p>
                  <p>"Miss Catheron!" He grasped her hand, and held it between both his own. "I have
                     but just heard all, for the first time, as you know. That my father lives—that
                     to him you have nobly consecrated your life. He has not deserved it at your
                     hands; let my father's son thank you with all his soul!"</p>
                  <p>"Ah, hush," she said softly. "I want no thanks. Your poor father! Aunt Helena
                     has told you how miserably<pb n="236-237" xml:id="VAC6448-00000118"/> bly all
                        <emph>his</emph> life has been wrecked—a life once so full of promise."</p>
                  <p>"She has told me all, Miss Catheron."</p>
                  <p>"Not Miss Catheron," she interposed, with a smile that lit her worn face into
                     youth and beauty; "not Miss Catheron, surely—Inez, Cousin Inez, if you will. It
                     is twenty-three years—do you know it?—since any one has called me Miss Catheron
                     before. You can't fancy how oddly it sounds."</p>
                  <p>He looked at her in surprise.</p>
                  <p>"You do not bear your own name? And yet I might have known it, lying as you
                     still do—"</p>
                  <p>"Under the ban of murder." She shuddered slightly as she said it. "Yes, when I
                     fled that dreadful night from Chesholm prison, and made my way to London, I
                     left my name behind me. I took at first the name of Miss Black. I lived in
                     dingy lodgings in that crowded part of London, Lambeth; and for the look of the
                     thing, took in sewing. It was of all those years the most dreary, the most
                     miserable and lonely time of my probation. I lived there four months; then came
                     the time of your father's complete restoration to bodily health, and
                     confirmation of the fear that his mind was entirely gone. What was to be done
                     with him? Lady Helena was at a loss to know. There were private asylums, but
                     she disliked the idea of shutting him up in one. He was perfectly gentle,
                     perfectly harmless, perfectly insane. Lady Helena came to see me, and I, pining
                     for the sight of a familiar face, sick and weary to death of the wretched
                     neighborhood in which I lived, proposed the plan that has ever since been the
                     plan of my life. Let Lady Helena take a house, retired enough to be safe,
                     sufficiently suburban to be healthy; let her place Victor there with me; let
                     Mrs. Marsh, my old friend and housekeeper at Catheron Royals, become my
                     housekeeper once more; let Hooper the butler take charge of us, and let us all
                     live together. I thought then, and I think still, it was the best thing for him
                     and for me that could have been suggested. Aunt Helena acted upon it at once;
                     she found a house, on the outskirts of St. John's Wood—a large house, set in
                     spacious grounds, and inclosed by a high wall, called 'Poplar Lodge.' It suited
                     us in every way; it combined bined all the advantages of town and country. She
                     leased it from the agent for a long term of years, for a 'Mr. and Mrs. Victor,'
                     Mr. Victor being in very poor health. Secretly and by night we removed your
                     father there, and since the night of his entrance he has never passed the
                     gates. From the first—in the days of my youth and my happiness—my life belonged
                     to him; it will belong to him to the end. Hooper and Marsh are with me still,
                     old and feeble now; and of late years I don't think I have been unhappy."</p>
                  <p>She sighed and looked out at the dull, rain-beaten day. The young man listened
                     in profound pity and admiration. Not unhappy! Branded with the deadliest crime
                     man can commit or the law punish—an exile, a recluse, the life-long companion
                     of an insane man and two old servants! No wonder that at forty her hair was
                     gray—no wonder all life and color had died out of that hopeless face years ago.
                     Perhaps his eyes told her what was passing in his mind; she smiled and answered
                     that look.</p>
                  <p>"I have not been unhappy, Victor; I want you to believe it. Your father was
                     always more to me than all the world beside—he is so still. He is but the wreck
                     of the Victor I loved, and yet I would rather spend my life by his side than
                     elsewhere on earth. And I was not quite forsaken. Aunt Helena often came and
                     brought you. It seems but yesterday since I had you in my arms rocking you
                     asleep, and now—and now they tell me you are going to be married."</p>
                  <p>The sensitive color rose over his face for a second, then faded, leaving him
                     very pale.</p>
                  <p>"I was going to be married," he answered slowly, "but she does not know this.
                     My father lives—the title and inheritance are his, not mine. Who is to tell
                     what she may say now?"</p>
                  <p>The dark, thoughtful eyes looked at him earnestly.</p>
                  <p>"Does she love you?" she asked; "this Miss Darrell? I need hardly inquire
                     whether <emph>you</emph> love her."</p>
                  <p>"I love her so dearly that if I lose her—" He paused and turned his face away
                     from her in the gray light. "I wish I had known this from the first; I ought to
                     have known. It may have been meant in kindness, but I<pb n="238-239"
                        xml:id="VAC6448-00000119"/> believe it was a mistake. Heaven knows how it
                     will end now."</p>
                  <p>"You mean to say, then, that in the hour you lose your title and inheritance
                     you also lose Miss Darrell? Is that it?"</p>
                  <p>"I have said nothing of the kind. Edith is one of the noblest, the truest of
                     women; but can't you see—it looks as though she had been deceived, imposed
                     upon. The loss of title and wealth would make a difference to any woman on
                     earth."</p>
                  <p>"Very little to a woman who loves, Victor. I hope—I hope—this young girl loves
                     you?"</p>
                  <p>Again the color rose over his face—again he turned impatiently away.</p>
                  <p>"She <emph>will</emph> love me," he answered; "she has promised it, and Edith
                     Darrell is a girl to keep her word."</p>
                  <p>"So," Miss Catheron said, softly and sadly, "it is the old French proverb over
                     again, 'There is always one who loves, and one who is loved.' She has owned to
                     you that she is not in love with you, then? Pardon me, Victor, but your
                     happiness is very near to me."</p>
                  <p>"She has owned it," he answered, "with the rare nobility and candor that
                     belongs to her. Such affection as mine will win its return—'love begets love,'
                     they say. It <emph>must</emph>."</p>
                  <p>"Not always, Victor—ah, not always, else what a happy woman <emph>I</emph> had
                     been! But surely she cares for no one else?"</p>
                  <p>"She cares for no one else," he answered, doggedly enough, but in his inmost
                     heart that never-dying jealousy of Charley Stuart rankled. "She cares for no
                     one else—she has told me so, and she is pride, and truth, and purity itself. If
                     I lose her through this, then this secret of insanity will have wrecked forever
                     still another life."</p>
                  <p>"If she is what you picture her," Inez said steadily, "no loss of rank or
                     fortune would ever make her give you up. But you are not to lose either—you
                     need not even tell her, if you choose."</p>
                  <p>"I can have no secrets from my plighted wife—Edith must know all. But the
                     secret will be as safe with her as with me."</p>
                  <p>"Very well," she said quietly; "you know what the result will be if by any
                     chance 'Mrs. Victor' and Inez Catheron are discovered to be one. But it shall
                     be exactly as you please. Your father is as dead to you, to all the world, as
                     though he lay in the vaults of Chesholm church, by your mother's side."</p>
                  <p>"My poor mother! my poor, murdered, unavenged mother! Inez Catheron, you are a
                     noble woman—a brave woman; was it well to aid your brother to escape?—was it
                     well, for the sake of saving the Catheron honor and the Catheron name, to
                     permit a most cruel and cowardly murder to go unavenged?"</p>
                  <p>What was it that looked up at him out of her eyes? Infinite pity, infinite
                     sorrow, infinite pain.</p>
                  <p>"My brother," she repeated softly, as if to herself; "poor Juan! he was the
                     scapegoat of the family always. Yes, Sir Victor, it was a cruel and cowardly
                     murder, and yet I believe in my soul we did right to screen the murderer from
                     the world. It is in the hands of the Almighty—there let it rest."</p>
                  <p>There was a pause—then:</p>
                  <p>"I shall return with you to London and see my father," he said, as one who
                     claims a right.</p>
                  <p>"No," she answered firmly; "it is impossible. Stay! Hear me out—it is your
                     father's own wish."</p>
                  <p>"My father's wish! But—"</p>
                  <p>"He cannot express a wish, you would say. Of late years, Victor, at wide
                     intervals, his reason has returned for a brief space—all the worse for
                     him."</p>
                  <p>"The worse for him!" The young man looked at her blankly. "Miss Catheron, do
                     you mean to say it is better for him to be mad?"</p>
                  <p>"Much better—such madness as his. He does not think—he does not suffer. Memory
                     to him is torture; he loved your mother, Victor—and he lost her—terribly lost
                     her. With memory returns the anguish and despair of that loss as though it were
                     but yesterday. If you saw him as I see him, you would pray as I do, that his
                     mind might be blotted out forever."</p>
                  <p>"Good Heaven! this is terrible."</p>
                  <p>"Life is full of terrible things—tragedies, secrets—this is<pb n="240-241"
                        xml:id="VAC6448-00000120"/> one of them. In these rare intervals of sanity
                     he speaks of you—it is he who directed, in case of your marriage, that you
                     should be told this much—that you are not to be brought to see him, until—"</p>
                  <p>She paused.</p>
                  <p>"Until—"</p>
                  <p>"Until he lies upon his death-bed. That day will be soon, Victor—soon, soon.
                     Those brief glimpses of reason and memory have shortened life. What he suffers
                     in these intervals no words of mine can tell. On his death-bed you are to see
                     him—not before; and then you shall be told the story of your mother's death.
                     No, Victor, spare me now—all I can tell you I have told. I return home by the
                     noonday train; and, before I go, I should like to see this girl who is to be
                     your wife. See, I will remain by this window, screened by the curtain. Can you
                     not fetch her by some pretence or other beneath it, that I may look and judge
                     for myself?"</p>
                  <p>"I can try," he said, turning to go. "I have your consent to tell her my father
                     is alive? I will tell her no more—it is not necessary she should know
                        <emph>you</emph> are his keeper."</p>
                  <p>"That much you may tell her—it is her right. When I have seen her, come to me
                     and say good-by."</p>
                  <p>"I shall not say good-by until I say it at Chester Station. Of course, I shall
                     see you off. Wait here; if Edith is able to come out you shall see her. She
                     kept her room this morning with headache."</p>
                  <p>He left her, half-dazed with what he had heard. He went to the drawing-room—the
                     Stuarts and Captain Hammond were there—not Edith.</p>
                  <p>"Has Edith come down?" he asked. "I wish to speak to her for a moment."</p>
                  <p>"Edith is prowling about in the rain, somewhere, like an uneasy ghost,"
                     answered Trixy; "no doubt wet feet, and discomfort, and dampness generally are
                     cures for headache; or, perhaps, she's looking for <emph>you</emph>."</p>
                  <p>He hardly waited to hear her out before he started in pursuit. As if favored by
                     fortune, he caught a glimpse of Edith's purple dress among the trees in the
                     distance. She had no umbrella, and was wandering about pale and listless in the
                     rain.</p>
                  <p>"Edith," Sir Victor exclaimed, "out in all this downpour without an umbrella?
                     You will get your death of cold."</p>
                  <p>"I never take cold," she answered indifferently. "I always liked to run out in
                     the rain ever since I was a child. I must be an amphibious sort of animal, I
                     think. Besides, the damp air helps my headache."</p>
                  <p>He drew her hand within his arm and led her slowly in the direction of the
                     window where the watcher stood.</p>
                  <p>"Edith," he began abruptly, "I have news for you. To call it bad news would
                     sound inhuman, and yet it has half-stunned me. It is this—my father is
                     alive."</p>
                  <p>"Sir Victor!"</p>
                  <p>"Alive, Edith—hopelessly insane, but alive. That is the news Lady Helena and
                     one other, have told me this morning It has stunned me; I repeat—is it any
                     wonder? All those years I have thought him dead, and to-day I discover that
                     from first to last I have been deceived."</p>
                  <p>She stood mute with surprise. His father alive—madness in the family. Truly it
                     would have been difficult for Sir Victor or any one else to call this good
                     news. They were directly beneath the window. He glanced up—yes, a pale face
                     gleamed from behind the curtain, gazing down at that other pale face by Sir
                     Victor's side. Very pale, very set just now.</p>
                  <p>"Then if your father is alive, <emph>he</emph> is Sir Victor and not you?"</p>
                  <p>Those were the first words she spoke; her tone cold, her glance
                     unsympathetic.</p>
                  <p>His heart contracted.</p>
                  <p>"He will never interfere with my claim—they assure me of that. Alive in
                     reality, he is dead to the world. Edith, would it make any difference—if I lost
                     title and estate, would I also lose <emph>you?</emph>"</p>
                  <p>The beseeching love in his eyes might have moved her, but just at present she
                     felt as though a stone lay in her bosom instead of a heart.</p>
                  <p>"I am not a sentimental sort of girl, Sir Victor," she answered steadily. "I am
                     almost too practical and worldly, perhaps. And I must own it would make a
                     difference. I have told you I am not in love with you—as yet—you have elected
                     to take me and wait for that. I tell you now truthfully<pb n="242-243"
                        xml:id="VAC6448-00000121"/> fully, if you were not Sir Victor Catheron, I
                     would not marry you. It is best I should be honest, best I should not deceive
                     you. You are a thousand times too good for so mercenary a creature as I am, and
                     if you leave me it will only be serving me right. I don't want to break my
                     promise, to draw back, but I feel in the mood for plain speaking this morning.
                     If you feel that you can't marry me on those terms—and I don't deserve that you
                     should—now is the time to speak. No one will be readier than I to own that it
                     serves me right."</p>
                  <p>He looked and listened, pale to the lips.</p>
                  <p>"Edith, in Heaven's name, do you <emph>wish</emph> me to give you up?"</p>
                  <p>"No, I wish nothing of the sort. I have promised to marry you, and I am ready
                     to keep that promise; but if you expect love or devotion from me, I tell you
                     frankly I have neither to give. If you are willing still to take me,
                     and"—smiling—"I see you are—I am still ready to be your wife—your true and
                     faithful wife from the first—your loving wife, I hope, in the end."</p>
                  <p>They said no more. He led her back to the house, then left her. He hastened to
                     Miss Catheron, more sombre even than when he had quitted her.</p>
                  <p>"Well," he said briefly, "you saw her?"</p>
                  <p>"I saw her. It is a beautiful face, a proud face, a truthful face, and
                     yet—"</p>
                  <p>"Go on," he said impatiently. "Don't try to spare me. I am growing accustomed
                     to unpleasant truths."</p>
                  <p>"I may be wrong, but something in her face tells me she does not love you,
                     and," under her breath, "never will."</p>
                  <p>"It will come in time. With or without love, she is willing to be my wife—that
                     is happiness enough for the present."</p>
                  <p>"You told her all?"</p>
                  <p>"I told her my father was alive and insane—no more. It will make no difference
                     in our plans—none. We are to be married the first of September. The secret is
                     safe with her."</p>
                  <p>The door opened, and Lady Helena came hastily in.</p>
                  <p>"If you wish to catch the 12.50 train, Inez," she said, "you must go at once.
                     It is a long drive from this to the station. The brougham is waiting—shall I
                     accompany you?"</p>
                  <p>"I will accompany her," said Sir Victor. "You had better return to our guests.
                     They will begin to feel themselves neglected."</p>
                  <p>Miss Catheron left the room. In five minutes she reappeared, closely veiled, as
                     when he had met her on the stairs. The adieux were hastily made. He gave her
                     his arm and led her down to the close brougham. As they passed before the
                     drawing-room windows, Miss Stuart uttered an exclamation:</p>
                  <p>"Oh! I say! where is Sir Victor going in the rain, and who is the
                     dismal-looking lady in black? Edith, who is it? <emph>You</emph> ought to
                     know."</p>
                  <p>"I don't know," Edith answered briefly, not looking up from her book.</p>
                  <p>"Hasn't Sir Victor told you?"</p>
                  <p>"I haven't asked Sir Victor."</p>
                  <p>"Oh, you haven't, and he hasn't told? Well, all I have to say is, that when
                        <emph>I'm</emph> engaged I hope the object of my affections will keep no
                     secrets from me."</p>
                  <p>"As if he could!" murmurs Captain Hammond.</p>
                  <p>"I declare, he is going off with her. Edith, do come and look. There! they are
                     driving away together, as fast as they can go."</p>
                  <p>But Edith never stirred. If she felt the slightest curiosity on the subject,
                     her face did not show it.</p>
                  <p>They drove rapidly through the rain, and barely caught the train at that. He
                     placed her hurriedly in an empty carriage, a moment before it started. As it
                     flew by he caught one last glimpse of a veiled face, and a hand waving
                     farewell. Then the train and the woman were out of sight.</p>
                  <p>Like a man who walks in his sleep, Sir Victor Catheron turned, re-entered the
                     brougham, and was driven home.</p>

                  <head type="sub">LADY HELENA'S BALL.</head>
                  <p>THREE days after, on Thursday, the fifth of June, Lady Helena Powyss gave a
                     very large dinner-party, followed by a ball in honor of her American guests.
                     When it is your good fortune to number half a county among your friends,
                     relatives, and acquaintances, it is possible to be at once numerous and select.
                     The crême de la crême of Cheshire assembled in Lady Helena's halls of dazzling
                     light, to do honor to Sir Victor Catheron's bride-elect.</p>
                  <p>For the engagement had been formally announced, and was the choice bit of
                     gossip, with which the shire regaled itself. Sir Victor Catheron was following
                     in the footsteps of his father, and was about to bring to Catheron Royals one
                     of the lower orders as its mistress. It was the Dobb blood no doubt cropping
                     up—these sort of mesalliances <emph>will</emph> tell. An American, too—a
                     governess, a poor relation of some common rich people from the States. The best
                     county families, with daughters to marry, shook their heads. It was very
                        sad—<emph>very</emph> sad, to see a good old name and a good old family
                     degenerate in this way. But there was always a taint of madness in the Catheron
                     blood—that accounted for a good deal. Poor Sir Victor—and poor Lady Helena!</p>
                  <p>But everybody came. They might be deeply shocked and sorry, but still Sir
                     Victor Catheron <emph>was</emph> Sir Victor Catheron, the richest baronet in
                     the county, and Catheron Royals always a pleasant house to visit—the reigning
                     Lady Catheron always a desirable acquaintance on one's visiting-list. Nobody
                     acknowledged, of course, they went from pure, downright curiosity, to see this
                     manœuvring American girl, who had taken Sir Victor Catheron captive under the
                     aristocratic noses of the best-born, best-bred, best-blooded young ladies in a
                     circuit of twenty miles.</p>
                  <p>The eventful night came—the night of Edith's ordeal. Even Trix was a little
                     nervous—only a little—is not perfect self-possession the normal state of
                     American young lady-dom? Lady Helena was quite pale in her anxiety. The girl
                     was handsome beyond dispute, thoroughbred as a young countess, despite her
                     birth and bringing up in a New England town and Yankee boarding-house, with
                     pride enough for a princess of forty quarterings, <emph>but</emph> how would
                     she come forth from the fiery furnace of all those pitiless eyes, sharpened to
                     points to watch for gaucheries and solecisms of good breeding—from the
                     merciless tongues that would hang, draw, and quarter her, the instant their
                     owners were out of the house.</p>
                  <p>"<emph>Don't</emph> you feel nervous, Dithy?" asked Trix, almost out of
                     patience at last with Edith's serene calm. "I do—horribly. And Lady Helena has
                     got a fit of the fidgets that will bring her gray hairs to an early grave, if
                     this day lasts much longer. Ain't you afraid—honor bright?"</p>
                  <p>Edith Darrell lifted her dark, disdainful eyes. She sat reading, while the
                     afternoon wore on, and Trixy fussed and fluttered about the room.</p>
                  <p>"Afraid of the people who are coming here to-night—is that what you mean? Not a
                     whit! I know as well as you do, they are coming to inspect and find fault with
                     Sir Victor Catheron's choice, to pity him, and call me an adventuress. I know
                     also that any one of these young ladies would have married him, and said 'Thank
                     you for asking,' if he had seen fit to choose them. I have my own pride and Sir
                     Victor's good taste to uphold to-night, and I will uphold them. I think"—she
                     lifted her haughty, dark head, and glanced, with a half-conscious smile, in the
                     pier-glass opposite—"I think I can bear comparison by lamplight with any of
                     these 'daughters of a hundred earls,' such as—Lady Gwendoline Drexel for
                     instance."</p>
                  <p>"By lamplight," Trix said, ignoring the rest of her speech. "Ah, yes, that's
                     the worst of it, Edith; you dark people always light up well. And Lady
                     Gwendoline Drexel—I wonder what Lady Gwendoline will wear to-night? I should
                     like to be the best-dressed young lady at the ball. Do you know, Dith,"
                     spitefully this, "I think Charley is quite struck with Lady Gwendoline. You
                     noticed, I suppose, the attention he paid her the evening we met, and then he
                     has been to Drexel Court by invitation. Pa is most anxious, I know. Money will
                     be no object, you know, with Charley, and really it would be nice to have a
                     titled sister-in-law. 'My sister, Lady Gwendoline Stuart,' will sound very well
                     in New<pb n="246-247" xml:id="VAC6448-00000123"/> York, won't it? It would be a
                     very suitable match for Charley."</p>
                  <p>"A most suitable match," Miss Darrell repeated; "age included. She is ten years
                     his senior if a day; but where true love exists, what does a trifle of years on
                     either side signify? He has money—she has rank. He has youth and good looks—she
                     has high birth and a handle to her name. As you say, Trixy, a most suitable
                     match!"</p>
                  <p>And then Miss Darrell went back to her book, but the slender, black brows were
                     meeting in a steady frown, that quite spoiled her beauty—no doubt at something
                     displeasing in the pages.</p>
                  <p>"But you mustn't sit here all day," broke in Trix again; "it's high time you
                     were up in your dressing-room. What are you going to wear, Dith?"</p>
                  <p>"I have not decided yet. I don't much care; it doesn't much matter. I have
                     decided to look my best in anything."</p>
                  <p>She arose and sauntered out of the room, and was seen no more, until the
                     waxlights blazed from end to end of the great mansion and the June dusk had
                     deepened into dewy night. Then, as the roll of carriages came without ceasing
                     along the drive, she descended, arrayed for battle, to find her impatient slave
                     and adorer awaiting her at the foot of the grand stairway. She smiled upon him
                     her brightest, most beaming smile, a smile that intoxicated him at sight.</p>
                  <p>"Will I do, Sir Victor?" she asked.</p>
                  <p>Would she do? He looked at her as a man may look half dazzled, at the sun. He
                     could not have told you what she wore, pink and white clouds it seemed to
                     him—he only knew two brown, luminous, laughing eyes were looking straight into
                     his, and turning his brain with their spell.</p>
                  <p>"You are sure I will do? You are sure you will not be ashamed of me to-night?"
                     her laughing voice asked again.</p>
                  <p>Ashamed of her—ashamed! He laughed aloud at the stupendous joke, as he drew her
                     arm within his, and led her into the thronged rooms, as some favored subject
                     may once in his life lead in a queen.</p>
                  <p>Perhaps there was excuse for him. "I shall look my best in anything," she had
                     said, in her disdain, and she had kept her word. She wore a dress that seemed
                     alternately composed posed of white tulle and blush-roses; she had roses in her
                     rich, dark hair, hair always beautifully worn; Sir Victor's diamond betrothal
                     ring shone on her finger; round her arching throat she wore a slender line of
                     yellow gold, a locket set with brilliants attached. The locket had been Lady
                     Helena's gift, and held Sir Victor's portrait. That was her ball array, and she
                     looked as though she were floating in her fleecy white draperies, her
                     perfumery, roses, and sparkling diamonds. The dark eyes outshone the diamonds,
                     a soft flush warmed either cheek. Yes, she was beautiful; so beautiful that
                     saner men than her accepted lover, might have been pardoned if for a moment
                     they lost their heads.</p>
                  <p>Lady Helena Powyss, in sweeping moire and jewels, receiving her guests, looked
                     at her and drew one long breath of great relief. She might have spared herself
                     all her anxious doubts and fears—low-born and penniless as she was, Sir Victor
                     Catheron's bride would do Sir Victor Catheron honor to-night.</p>
                  <p>Trix was there—Trix resplendent in pearl silk with a train half the length of
                     the room, pearl silk, point lace, white-camelias, and Neapolitan corals and
                     cameos, incrusted with diamonds—Trix, in all the finery six thousand dollars
                     can buy, drew a long breath of great and bitter envy.</p>
                  <p>"If one wore the Koh-i-noor and Coronation Robes," thought Miss Stuart sadly,
                     "she would shine one down. She is dazzling to-night. Captain Hammond," tapping
                     that young warrior with her point-lace fan, "<emph>don't</emph> you think Edith
                     is without exception the most beautiful and elegant girl in the rooms?"</p>
                  <p>And the gallant captain bows profoundly, and answers with a look that points
                     the speech:</p>
                  <p>"With <emph>one</emph> exception, Miss Beatrix, only one."</p>
                  <p>
                     <choice>
                        <sic>Charely</sic>
                        <corr>Charley</corr>
                     </choice> is there, and perhaps there can be no doubt about it, that Charley
                     is, without exception, far and away, the best looking man. Charley gazes at his
                     cousin for an instant on the arm of her proud and happy lover, radiant and
                     smiling, the centre of all that is best in the room. She lifts her dark,
                     laughing eyes as it chances, and brown and gray meet full. Then he turns away
                     to a tall, languid rather passive lady, who is talking slowly by his side.</p>
                  <p>"Is Miss Darrell really his cousin? Really? How extremely<pb n="248-249"
                        xml:id="VAC6448-00000124"/> tremely handsome she is, and how perfectly
                     infatuated Sir Victor seems. Poor Sir Victor! What a pity there is insanity in
                     the family—insanity is such a very shocking thing. How pretty Miss Stuart is
                     looking this evening. She has heard—is it true—can Mr. Stuart inform her—are
                        <emph>all</emph> American girls handsome?"</p>
                  <p>And Charley—as Captain Hammond has done—bows, and looks, and replies:</p>
                  <p>"I used to think so, Lady Gwendoline. I have seen English girls since, and
                     think differently."</p>
                  <p>Oh, the imbecile falsehoods of society! He is thinking, as he says it, how
                     pallid and faded poor Lady Gwendoline is looking, in her dingy green satin and
                     white Brussels lace overdress, her emeralds and bright golden hair—most
                     beautiful and most expensive shade to be had in London. He is thinking how the
                     Blanc de Perle and rouge vegetal is showing on her three-and-thirty-year-old
                     face, and what his life would be like if he listened to his father and married
                     her. He shudders inwardly and gives it up—"that way madness lies," and while
                     there is a pistol left, wherewith to blow his brains out, he can still hope to
                     escape a worse fate.</p>
                  <p>But Lady Gwendoline, freighted with eleven seasons' experience, and growing
                     seedy and desperate, clings to him as the drowning cling to straws. She is the
                     daughter of a peer, but there are five younger sisters, all plain and all
                     portionless. Her elder sister, who chaperones her to-night, is the wife of a
                     rich and retired manufacturer, Lady Portia Hampton. The rich and retired
                     manufacturer has purchased Drexel Court, and it is Lady Portia's painful duty
                     to try and marry her sisters off.</p>
                  <p>The ball is a great success for Miss Edith Darrell. The men rave about her; the
                     women may sneer, but they must do it covertly; her beauty and her grace, her
                     elegance and high breeding, not the most envious dare dispute. Music swells and
                     floats deliciously—scores are suitors for her hand in the dance. The flush
                     deepens on her dusk cheeks, the streaming light in her starry eyes—she is
                     dangerously brilliant to-night. Sir Victor follows in her train whenever his
                     duties allow him; when he dances with others his eyes follow his heart, and go
                     after her. There is but one in all those thronged rooms for him—one who is his
                     idol—his darling—the pride, the joy, the desire of his life.</p>
                  <p>"My dear, I am proud of you to-night," Lady Helena whispers once. "You surpass
                     yourself—you are lovely beyond compare. You do us all credit."</p>
                  <p>And Edith Darrell's haughty eyes look up for a moment and they are flashing
                     through-tears. She lifts the lady's hand with exquisite grace, and kisses it.
                     Then smiles chase the tears, and she is gone on the arm of some devoted
                     cavalier. Once—only once, she dances with Charley. She has striven to avoid
                     him—no, not that either—it is <emph>he</emph> who has avoided her. She has seen
                     him—let her be surrounded by scores, she has seen him whispering with Lady
                     Gwendoline, dancing with Lady Gwendoline, fanning Lady Gwendoline, flirting
                     with Lady Gwendoline. It is Lady Gwendoline he leads to supper, and it is after
                     supper, with the enchanting strains of a Strauss waltz filling the air, that he
                     comes up and asks her for that dance.</p>
                  <p>"I am sure I deserve it for my humility," he says plaintively. "I have stood in
                     the background, humbly and afar off, and given you up to my betters. Surely,
                     after all the bitter pills I have been swallowing, I deserve <emph>one</emph>
                     sugar-plum."</p>
                  <p>She laughs—glances at Sir Victor, making his way toward her, takes his arm
                     rather hurriedly, and moves off.</p>
                  <p>"Is Lady Gwendoline a pill, or a sugar-plum?" she asks. "You certainly seem to
                     have had an overdose of her."</p>
                  <p>"I owe Lady Gwendoline my deepest thanks," he answered gravely. "Her efforts to
                     keep me amused this evening, have been worthy of a better cause. If the deepest
                     gratitude of a too-trusting heart," says Charley, laying his hand on the left
                     side of his white waistcoat, "be any reward for such service, it is hers."</p>
                  <p>They float away. To Edith it is the one dance of the night. She hardly knows
                     whether she whirls in air or on the waxed floor; she only knows that it is like
                     heaven, that the music is celestial, and that it is Charley's arm that is
                     clasping her close. Will she ever waltz with him again she wonders, and she
                     feels, feels in her inmost heart, that she is sinning against her affianced
                     husband in waltzing with him now. But it is <emph>so</emph> delicious—what a
                     pity most of the delicious things<pb n="250-251" xml:id="VAC6448-00000125"/> of
                     earth should be wrong. If it could only last forever—forever! And while she
                     thinks it, it stops.</p>
                  <p>"O Charley! that <emph>was</emph> a waltz!" she says, leaning on him heavily,
                     and panting; "no one else has my step as you have it."</p>
                  <p>"Let us trust that Sir Victor will learn it," he responds coolly; "here he
                     comes now. It was a charming waltz, Dithy, but charming things must end. Your
                     lawful proprietor approaches; to your lawful proprietor I resign you."</p>
                  <p>He was perfectly unflushed, perfectly unexcited. He bows, smiles, yields her to
                     Sir Victor, and saunters away. Five seconds later he is bending over Lady
                     Gwendoline's chair, whispering in the pink, patrician ear resting against the
                     glistening, golden chignon. Edith looks once—in her heart she hates Lady
                     Gwendoline—looks once, and looks no more.</p>
                  <p>And as the serene June morning dawns, and larks and thrushes pipe in the trees,
                     Lady Helena's dear five hundred friends, sleepy and pallid, get into their
                     carriages and go home.</p>

                  <p>THE middle of the day is past before one by one they straggle down. Breakfast
                     awaits each newcomer, hot and tempting. Trix eats hers with a relish. Trix
                     possesses one of the chief elements of perpetual human happiness—an appetite
                     that never fails, a digestion that, in her own metaphorical American language,
                     "never goes back on her." But Edith looks fagged and spiritless. If people are
                     to be supernaturally brilliant and bright, dashing and fascinating all night
                     long, people must expect to pay the penalty next day, when lassitude and
                     reaction set in.</p>
                  <p>"My poor Edie!" Mr. Charles Stuart remarks, compassionately, glancing at the
                     wan cheeks and lustreless eyes, as he lights his after-breakfast cigar, "you do
                     look most awfully fully used up. What a pity for their peace of mind, some of
                     your frantic adorers of last night can't see you now. Let me recommend you to
                     go back to bed and try an S. and B."</p>
                  <p>"An 'S. and B.'?" Edith repeats vaguely.</p>
                  <p>"Soda and Brandy. It's the thing, depend upon it, for such a case as yours.
                     I've been seedy myself before now, and know what I'm talking about. I'll mix it
                     for you, if you like."</p>
                  <p>There is a copy of Tennyson, in blue and gold, beside Miss Darrell, and Miss
                     Darrell's reply is to fling it at Mr. Stuart's head. It is a last effort of
                     expiring nature; she sinks back exhausted among her cushions. Charley departs
                     to enjoy his Manila out under the waving trees, and Sir Victor, looking fresh
                     and recuperated, strolls in and bends over her.</p>
                  <p>"My dear Edith," he says, "how pale you are this morning—how tired you look. If
                     one ball is going to exhaust you like this, how will you stand the wear and
                     tear of London seasons in the blissful time to come?"</p>
                  <p>She does not blush—she turns a trifle impatiently away from him and looks out.
                     She can see Charley and Hammond smoking sociably together in the sunny
                     distance.</p>
                  <p>"I will grow used to it, I dare say. 'Sufficient unto the day is the evil
                     thereof.'"</p>
                  <p>"Have you had breakfast?"</p>
                  <p>"I made an effort and failed. I watched Trix eat hers, however, and that
                     refreshed me quite as well. It was invigorating only to look at her."</p>
                  <p>He smiles and bends lower, drawing one long brown silken tress of hair fondly
                     through his fingers, feeling as though he would like to stoop and kiss the
                     pale, weary face. But Trix is over yonder, pretending to read, and kissing is
                     not to be thought of.</p>
                  <p>"I am going over to Catheron Royals," he whispered; "suppose you come—the walk
                     will do you good. I am giving orders about the fitting up of the old place. Did
                     I tell you the workmen came yesterday?"</p>
                  <p>"Yes; you told me."</p>
                  <p>"Shall I ring for your hat and parasol? Do come, Edith."</p>
                  <p>"Excuse me, Sir Victor," Edith answers, with an impatient motion. "I feel too
                     tired—too lazy, which ever you<pb n="252-253" xml:id="VAC6448-00000126"/>
                     like—to stir. Some other day I will go with pleasure—just now I feel like lying
                     here and doing the <foreign xml:lang="ITA">dolce far niente</foreign>. Don't
                     let me detain you, however."</p>
                  <p>He turns to leave her with a disappointed face. Edith closes her eyes and takes
                     an easier position among the pillows. The door closes behind him; Trix flings
                     down her book and bursts forth:</p>
                  <p>"Of all the heartless, cold-blooded animals it has ever been my good fortune to
                     meet, commend me to Edith Darrell!"</p>
                  <p>The dark eyes unclose and look up at her.</p>
                  <p>"My dear Trix! what's the matter with you now? What new enormity have I
                     committed?"</p>
                  <p>"Oh, nothing new—nothing new at all," is Trixy's scornful response; "it is
                     quite in keeping with the rest of your conduct. To be purely and entirely
                     selfish is the normal state of the future Lady Catheron! Poor Sir Victor! who
                     has won you. Poor Charley! who has lost you. I hardly know which I pity
                     most."</p>
                  <p>"I don't see that you need waste your precious pity on either," answered Edith,
                     perfectly unmoved by Miss Stuart's vituperation; "keep it for me. I shall make
                     Sir Victor a very good wife as wives go, and for Charley—well, Lady Gwendoline
                     is left to console him."</p>
                  <p>"Yes, of course, there is Lady Gwendoline. O Edith! Edith! what are you made
                     of? Flesh and blood like other people, or waxwork, with a stone for a heart?
                     How can you sell yourself, as you are going to do? Sir Victor Catheron is no
                     more to you than his hall-porter, and yet you persist in marrying him. You love
                     my brother and yet you hand him over to Lady Gwendoline. Come, Edith, be honest
                     for once; you love Charley, don't you?"</p>
                  <p>"It is rather late in the day for such tender confessions as that," Edith
                     replies, with a reckless sort of laugh; "but yes—if the declaration does you
                     any good, Trix—I love Charley."</p>
                  <p>"And you give him up! Miss Darrell, I give you up as a conundrum I can't solve.
                     Rank and title are all very well—nobody thinks more of them than I do; but if
                        <emph>I</emph> loved a man," cried Trix, with kindling eyes and glowing
                     cheeks, "I'd marry him! Yes, I would, though he were a beggar."</p>
                  <p>Edith looked up at her kindly, with a smothered sigh.</p>
                  <p>"I believe you, Trix; but then you are different from me." She half-raised
                     herself, looking dreamily out on the sunlit prospect of lawn, and coppice, and
                     woodland. "Here it is: I love Charley, but I love myself better. O Trix, child,
                     don't let us talk about it; I am tired, and my head aches." She pushed back the
                     heavy, dark hair wearily off her temples with both hands. I am what you call
                     me, a selfish wretch—a heartless little brute—and I am going to marry Sir
                     Victor Catheron. Pity him, if you like, poor fellow! for he loves me with his
                     whole heart, and he is a brave and loyal gentleman. But don't pity your
                     brother, my dear; believe me, he doesn't need it. He's a good fellow, Charley,
                     and he likes me, but he won't break his heart or commit suicide while he has a
                     cigar left."</p>
                  <p>"Here he comes!" exclaimed Trix, "and I believe he has heard us."</p>
                  <p>"Let him come," Edith returns, lying listlessly back among her cushions once
                     more. "It doesn't matter if he has. It will be no news to
                     <emph>him</emph>."</p>
                  <p>"It is a pity you should miss each other, though," Trix says sarcastically, as
                     she turns to go; "such thorough philosophers both; I believe you were made for
                     each other, and, as far as easy-going selfishness is concerned, there is little
                     to choose between you. It's a thousand pities Sir Victor can't hear all
                     this."</p>
                  <p>"He might if he liked," is Edith's answer. "I shouldn't care. Charley!" as
                     Charley comes in and Trix goes out, "have you been eavesdropping? Don't deny
                     it, sir, if you have!"</p>
                  <p>Charley takes a position in an easy-chair some yards distant, and looks at her
                     lying there, languid and lovely.</p>
                  <p>"I have been eavesdropping—I never deny my small vices. Hammond left me to go
                     to the stables, and, strolling under the window, I overheard you and Trix. Open
                     confession is beneficial, no doubt; but, my dear cousin, you really shouldn't
                     make it in so audible a tone. It might have been Sir Victor instead of me."</p>
                  <p>She says nothing. The sombre look he has learned to know is in her dusk eyes,
                     on her dark, colorless face.</p>
                  <p>"Poor Sir Victor!" he goes on; "he loves you—not a<pb n="254-255"
                        xml:id="VAC6448-00000127"/> doubt of that, Dithy—to the depths of idiocy,
                     where you know so well how to cast your victims; but hard hit as he is, I
                     wonder <emph>what</emph> he would say if he heard all this!"</p>
                  <p>"You might tell him, Charley," Edith says. "I shouldn't mind much, and he
                        <emph>might</emph> jilt me—who can tell? I think it would do us both good.
                     You could say, 'Look here: don't marry Edith Darrell, Sir Victor; she isn't
                     worthy of you or any good man. She is full of pride, vanity, ambition,
                     selfishness, ill-temper, cynicism, and all uncharitableness. She is <foreign
                        xml:lang="FRA">blasé</foreign> at nineteen—think what she will be at
                     nine-and-twenty. She doesn't love you—I know her well enough to be sure she
                     never will, partly because a heart was left out in her hard anatomy, partly
                     because—because all the liking she ever had to give, went long ago to somebody
                     else.' Charley, I think he would give me up, and I'd respect him for it, if he
                     knew that. Tell him, if you have the courage, and when he casts me off, come to
                     me and make me marry you. You can do it, you know; and when the honeymoon is
                     over—when poverty stalks in at the door and love flies out of the window—when
                     we hate each other as only ill-assorted wives and husbands ever hate—let the
                     thought that we have done the 'All for love, and the world well lost' business,
                     to the bitter end, console us."</p>
                  <p>She laughs recklessly; she feels reckless enough to say anything, do anything,
                     this morning. Love, ambition, rank, wealth—what empty baubles they all look,
                     seen through tired eyes the day after a ball!</p>
                  <p>He sits silent, watching her thoughtfully.</p>
                  <p>"I don't understand you, Edith," he says. "I feel like asking you the same
                     question Trix did. <emph>Why</emph> do you marry Sir Victor?"</p>
                  <p>"Why do I marry him?" she repeated. "Well—a little because of his handsome face
                     and stately bearing, and the triumph of carrying off a prize, for which your
                     Lady Gwendoline and half a score more have battled. A little because he pleads
                     so eloquently, and loves me as no other mortal man did, or ever will; and oh!
                     Charley, a great deal because he is Sir Victor Catheron of Catheron Royals,
                     with a rent-roll of twenty thousand a year, and more, and a name that is older
                     than Magna Charta. If there be any virtue in truth, there—you have it, plain,
                     unvarnished. I like him—who could help it; but love him—no!" She clasped her
                     hands above her head, and gazed dreamily out at the sparkling sunlit scene. "I
                     shall be very fond of him, very proud of him, when I am his wife—that I know.
                     He will enter Parliament, and make speeches, and write political pamphlets, and
                     redress the wrongs of the people. He's the sort of man politicians are made
                     of—the sort of man a wife can be proud of. And on my-wedding day, or perhaps a
                     day or two before, you and I shall shake hands, sir, and see each other no
                     more."</p>
                  <p>"No more?" he repeats.</p>
                  <p>"Well, for a year or two at least, until all the folly of the past can be
                     remembered only as a thing to be laughed at. Or until there is a tall, handsome
                     Mrs. Stuart, or, more likely, a Lady Gwendoline Stuart. And Charley," speaking
                     hurriedly now, and not meeting the deep gray eyes she knows are fixed upon her,
                     "the locket with my picture and the letters—you won't want them
                        <emph>then</emph>—suppose you let me have them back."</p>
                  <p>"I won't want them then, certainly," Charley responds, "if by 'then' you mean
                     when I am the husband of the tall, fascinating Mrs. Stuart or Lady Gwendoline.
                     But as I have not that happiness yet, suppose you allow me to retain them until
                     I have. Sir Victor will never know, and he would not mind much if he did. We
                     are cousins, are we not? and what more natural than that cousins once removed
                     should keep each other's pictures? By the bye, I see you still wear that little
                     trumpery pearl and turquoise brooch I gave you, with my photo at the back. Give
                     it to me, Edie; turquoise does not become your brown skin, my dear, and I'll
                     give you a ruby pin with Sir Victor's instead. Perhaps, as turquois does become
                     her, Lady Gwendoline will accept this as love's first timid offering. The
                     rubies will do twice as well for you."</p>
                  <p>He stretched out his hand to unfasten it. She sprang back, her cheeks flushing
                     at his touch.</p>
                  <p>"You shall not have it! Neither Lady Gwendoline nor any one else shall wear it,
                     and, married or single, <emph>I</emph> shall keep it to my dying day if I
                     choose. Charley—what do you mean, sir! How dare you? Let me go!"</p>
                  <p>For he had risen suddenly and caught her in his arms,<pb n="256-257"
                        xml:id="VAC6448-00000128"/> looking steadily down into her dark eyes, with a
                     gaze she could not meet. Whilst he held her, whilst he looked at her, he was
                     her master, and he knew it.</p>
                  <p>"Charley, let me go!" she pleaded. "If any one came in; the servants, or—or—Sir
                     Victor."</p>
                  <p>He laughed contemptuously, and held her still.</p>
                  <p>"Yes, Edith; suppose Sir Victor came in and saw his bride-elect with a
                     sacrilegious arm about her waist? Suppose I told him the truth—that you are
                     mine, not his: mine by the love that alone makes marriage holy; his for his
                     title and his rent-roll—bought and sold. By Heaven! I half wish he would!"</p>
                  <p>Was this Charley—Charley Stuart?</p>
                  <p>She caught her breath—her pride and her insolence dropping from her—only a girl
                     in the grasp of the man she loves. In that moment, if he had willed it, he
                     could have made her forego her plight, and pledge herself to be his wholly, and
                     he knew it.</p>
                  <p>"Edith," he said, "as I stand and look at you, in your beauty and your
                     selfishness, I hardly know whether I love or despise you most. I could make you
                     marry me—<emph>make</emph> you, mind—but you are not worth it. Go!" He opened
                     his arms contemptuously and released her. "You'll not be a bad wife for Sir
                     Victor, I dare say, as fashionable wives go. You'll be that ornament of
                     society, a married flirt, but you'll never run away with his dearest friend,
                     and make a case for the D. C. 'All for love and the world well lost,' is no
                     motto of yours, my handsome cousin. A week ago I envied Sir Victor with all my
                     heart—to-day I pity him with all my soul!"</p>
                  <p>He turned to go, for once in his life, thoroughly aroused, passionate love,
                     passionate rage at war within him. She had sunk back upon the sofa, her face
                     hidden in her hands, humbled, as in all her proud life she had never been
                     humbled before. Her silence, her humility touched him. He heard a stifled sob,
                     and all his hot anger died out in pained remorse.</p>
                  <p>"Oh, forgive me, Edith!" he said, "forgive me. It may be cruel, but I had to
                     speak. It is the first, it will be the last time. I am selfish, too, or I would
                     never have pained you—better never hear the truth than that the hearing should
                     make you miserable. Don't cry, Edith; I can't bear it. Forgive me, my
                     cousin—they are the last tears I will ever make you shed."</p>
                  <p>The words he meant to soothe her, hurt more deeply than the words he meant to
                     wound. "They are the last tears I will ever make you shed!" An eternal farewell
                     was in the words. She heard the door open, heard it close, and knew that her
                     love and her life had parted in that instant forever.</p>

                  <head type="sub">"FOREVER AND EVER."</head>
                  <p>TWO weeks later, as June's golden days were drawing to a close, five of Lady
                     Helena's guests departed from Powyss Place. One remained behind. The Stuart
                     family, with the devoted Captain Hammond in Trixy's train, went up to London;
                     Miss Edith Darrell stayed behind.</p>
                  <p>Since the memorable day following the ball, the bride-elect of Sir Victor
                     Catheron had dwelt in a sort of earthly purgatory, had lived stretched on a
                     sort of daily rack. "How blessings brighten as they take their flight." She had
                     given up Charley—had cast him off, had bartered herself in cold blood—for a
                     title and an income. And now that he held her at her true value, that his love
                     had died a natural death in contempt and scorn, her whole heart, her whole soul
                     craved him with a sick longing that was like death. It was her daily torture
                     and penance to see him, to speak to him, and note the cold scorn of his gray,
                     tranquil eyes. Jealousy had been added to her other torments; he was ever by
                     Lady Gwendoline's side of late—ever at Drexel Court. His father had set his
                     heart upon the match; she was graceful and high-bred; it would end in a
                     marriage, no doubt. There were times when she woke from her jealous anger to
                     rage at herself.</p>
                  <p>"What a dog in the manager I grow," she said, with a bitter<pb n="258-259"
                        xml:id="VAC6448-00000129"/> ter laugh. "I won't have him myself, and I
                     cannot bear that any one else should have him. If he would only go away—if he
                     only would—I cannot endure this much longer."</p>
                  <p>Truly she could not. She was losing flesh and color, waxing wan as a shadow.
                     Sir Victor was full of concern, full of wonder and alarm. Lady Helena said
                     little, but (being a woman) her sharp old eyes saw all.</p>
                  <p>"The sooner my guests go, the better," she thought; "the sooner she sees the
                     last of this young man, the sooner health and strength will return."</p>
                  <p>Perhaps Charley saw too—the gray, tranquil eyes were very penetrating. It was
                     he, at all events, who urged the exodus to London.</p>
                  <p>"Let us see a little London life in the season, governor," he said. "Lady
                     Portia Hampton, and <emph>that</emph> lot, are going. They'll introduce us to
                     some nice people—so will Hammond. Rustic lanes and hawthorn ledges are all very
                     pretty, but there's a possibility of their palling on depraved New York minds.
                     I pine for stone and mortar, and the fog and smoke of London."</p>
                  <p>Whatever he may have felt, he bore it easily to all outward seeming, as the men
                     who feel deepest mostly do. He could not be said to actually avoid her, but
                     certainly since that afternoon in the drawing-room, they had never been for
                     five seconds alone.</p>
                  <p>Mr. Stuart, senior, had agreed, with almost feverish eagerness, to the proposed
                     change. Life had been very pleasant in Cheshire, with picnics, water-parties
                     down the Dee, drives to show-places, lawn billiards, and croquet, but a month
                     of it was enough. Sir Victor was immersed in his building projects and his
                     lady-love; Lady Helena, ever since the coming and going of the lady in black,
                     had not been the same. Powyss place was a pleasant house, but enough was
                     enough. They were ready to say good-by and be off to "fresh fields and pastures
                     new."</p>
                  <p>"And, my dear child," said Lady Helena to Edith, when the departure was fixed,
                     "I think you had much better remain behind."</p>
                  <p>There was an emphasis in her tone, a meaning glance in her eye, that brought
                     the conscious blood to the girl's cheek. Her eyes fell—her lips quivered for an
                     instant—she made no reply.</p>
                  <p>"Certainly Edith will remain," Sir Victor interposed impetuously. "As if we
                     could survive down here without her! And, of course, just at present it is
                     impossible for me to leave. They don't need her half as much as we do—Miss
                     Stuart has Hammond, Prince Charley has Gwendoline Drexel; Edith would only be
                     in the way!"</p>
                  <p>"It is settled, then?" said Lady Helena again, watching Edith with a curiously
                     intent look. "You remain?"</p>
                  <p>"I will remain," Edith answered, very lowly and without lifting her eyes.</p>
                  <p>"My own idea is," went on the young baronet confidentially, to his lady love,
                     "that they are glad to be gone. Something seems to be the matter with Stuart
                        <foreign xml:lang="FRA">père</foreign>—under a cloud, rather, just at
                     present. Has it struck you, Dithy?"</p>
                  <p>He had caught the way of calling her by the pet name Trix and Charley used. She
                     lifted her eyes abstractedly now, as he asked the question.</p>
                  <p>"Mr. Stuart? What did you say, Sir Victor? Oh—under a cloud. Well, yes, I have
                     noticed it. I think it is something connected with his business in New York. In
                     papa's last letter he alluded to it."</p>
                  <p>"In papa's last letter," Mr. Frederick Darrell had said this:</p>
                  <p>"One of their great financial crises, they tell me, is approaching in New York,
                     involving many failures and immense loss. One of the most deeply involved, it
                     is whispered, will be James Stuart. I <emph>have</emph> heard he is threatened
                     with ruin. Let us hope, however, this may be exaggerated. Once I fancied it
                     would be a fine thing, a brilliant match, if my Edith married James Stuart's
                     son. How much better Providence has arranged it! Once more, my dearest
                     daughter, I congratulate you on the brilliant vista opening before you. Your
                     step-mother, who desires her best love, never wearies of spreading the
                     wonderful news that our little Edie is so soon to be the bride of a great
                     English baronet."</p>
                  <p>Miss Darrell's straight black brows met in one frowning line as she perused
                     this parental and pious epistle. The next instant it was torn into minute
                     atoms, and scattered to the four winds of heaven.</p>
                  <pb n="260-261" xml:id="VAC6448-00000130"/>
                  <p>There seemed to be some foundation for the news. Letters without end kept
                     coming for Mr. Stuart; little boys bearing the ominous orange envelopes of the
                     telegraph company, came almost daily to Powyss Place. After these letters and
                     cable messages the gloom on Mr. Stuart's face deepened and darkened. He lost
                     sleep, he lost appetite; some great and secret fear seemed preying upon him.
                     What was it? His family noticed it, and inquired about his health. He rebuffed
                     them impatiently; he was quite well—he wanted to be let alone—why the
                     unmentionable-to-ears-polite need they badger him with questions? They held
                     their peace and let him alone. That it in any way concerned commercial failure
                     they never dreamed; to them the wealth of the husband and father was something
                     illimitable—a golden river flowing from a golden ocean. That ruin could
                     approach them never entered their wildest dreams.</p>
                  <p>He had gone to Edith one day and offered her a thousand-dollar check.</p>
                  <p>"For your trousseau, my dear," he had said. "It isn't what I expected to give
                     you—what I would give you, if—" He gulped and paused. "Things have changed with
                     me lately. You will accept this, Edie—it will at least buy your
                     wedding-dress."</p>
                  <p>She had shrunk back, and refused—not proudly, or angrily—very humbly, but very
                     firmly. From Charley's father she could never take a farthing now.</p>
                  <p>"No," she said, "I can't take it. Dear Mr. Stuart, I thank you all the same;
                     you have given me more already than I deserve or can ever repay. I cannot take
                     this. Sir Victor Catheron takes me as I am—poor, penniless. Lady Helena will
                     give me a white silk dress and veil to be married in. For the rest, after my
                     wedding-day, whatever my life may lack, it will not lack dresses."</p>
                  <p>He had replaced the check in his pocket-book, inwardly thankful, perhaps, that
                     it had not been accepted. The day was past when a thousand dollars would have
                     been but as a drop in the ocean to him.</p>
                  <p>The time of departure was fixed at length; and the moment it <emph>was</emph>
                     fixed, Trix flew upstairs, and into Edith's room, with the news.</p>
                  <p>"Oh, let us be joyful," sang Miss Stuart, waltzing in psalm time up and down
                     the room; "we're off at last, the day after to-morrow, Dithy; so go pack up at
                     once. It's been very jolly, and all that, down here, for the past four weeks,
                     and <emph>you've</emph> had a good time, I know; but I, for one, will be glad
                     to hear the bustle and din of city life once more. One grows tired doing the
                     pastoral and tooral-ooral—I mean truly rural—and craves for shops, and
                     gaslight, and glitter, and crowds of human beings once more. Our rooms are
                     taken at Langham's, Edie, and that blessed darling, Captain Hammond, goes with
                     us. Lady Portia, Lady Gwendoline, and Lady Laura are coming also, and I mean to
                     plunge headlong into the giddy whirl of dissipation, and mingle with the
                     bloated aristocracy. Why don't you laugh? What are you looking so sulky
                     about?"</p>
                  <p>"Am I looking sulky?" Edith said, with a faint smile. "I don't feel sulky. I
                     sincerely hope you may enjoy yourself even more than you anticipate."</p>
                  <p>"Oh—you do!" said Trix, opening her eyes; "and how about yourself—don't you
                     expect to enjoy yourself at all?"</p>
                  <p>"I would, no doubt, only—I am not going."</p>
                  <p>"Not going!" Thunderstruck, Trix repeats the words.</p>
                  <p>"No; it has been decided that I remain here. You won't miss me, Trix—you will
                     have Captain Hammond."</p>
                  <p>"Captain Hammond may go hang himself. I want <emph>you</emph>, and you I mean
                     to have. Let's sit down and reason this thing out. Now what new crotchet has
                     got into your head? May I ask what your ladyship-elect means to do?"</p>
                  <p>"To remain quietly here until—until—you know."</p>
                  <p>"Oh, I know!" with indescribable scorn; "until you are raised to the sublime
                     dignity of a baronet's wife. And you mean to mope away your existence down here
                     for the next two months listening to love-making you don't care
                        <emph>that</emph> about. Oh, no need to fire up; I know how much you care
                     about it. And I say you shan't. Why, you are fading away to a shadow now under
                     it. You shall come up to London with us and recuperate. Charley shall take you
                     everywhere."</p>
                  <p>She saw her wince—yes, that was where the vital place lay. Miss Stuart ran
                     on:</p>
                  <p>"The idea of living under the same roof for two mortal months with the young
                     man you are going to marry!<pb n="262-263" xml:id="VAC6448-00000131"/> You're a
                     great stickler for etiquette—I hope you don't call <emph>that</emph> etiquette?
                     Nobody ever heard of such a thing. I'm not sure but that it would be immoral.
                     Of course, there's Lady Helena to play propriety, and there's the improvements
                     at Catheron Royals to amuse you, and there's Sir Victor's endless 'lovering' to
                     edify you, but still I say you shall come. You started with us, and you shall
                     stay with us—you belong to us, not to him, until the nuptial knot is tied. I
                     wouldn't give a fig for London without you. I should die of the dismals in a
                     week."</p>
                  <p>"What, Trix—with Captain Hammond?"</p>
                  <p>"Bother Captain Hammond! I want <emph>you</emph>. O Edie, do come!"</p>
                  <p>"I can't, Trix." She turned away with an impatient sigh. "I have promised. Sir
                     Victor wishes it, Lady Helena wishes it. It is impossible."</p>
                  <p>"And Edith Darrell wishes it. Oh, say it out, Edith," Trix retorted bitterly.
                     "Your faults are many, but fear of the truth used not to be among them. You
                     have promised. Is it that they are afraid to trust you out of their sight?"</p>
                  <p>"Let me alone, Trix. I am tired and sick—I can't bear it."</p>
                  <p>She laid her face down upon her arm—tired, as she said—sick, soul and body.
                     Every fibre of her heart was longing to go with them—to be with
                        <emph>him</emph> while she might, treason or no to Sir Victor; but it could
                     not be.</p>
                  <p>Trix stood and looked at her, pale with anger.</p>
                  <p>"I will let you alone, Miss Darrell. More—I will let you alone for the
                     remainder of your life. All the past has been bad enough. Your deceit to me,
                     your heartlessness to Charley—this is the last drop in the cup. You throw us
                     over when we have served your turn for newer, grander friends—it is only the
                     way of the world, and what one might expect from Miss Edith Darrell. But I
                     didn't expect it—I didn't think ingratitude was one among your failings. I was
                     a fool!" cried Trix, with a burst. "I always was a fool and always will be. But
                     I'll be fooled by you no longer. Stay here, Miss Darrell, and when we say
                     good-by day after to-morrow, it shall be good-by forever."</p>
                  <p>And then Miss Stuart, very red in the face, very flashing in the eyes, bounced
                     out of the room, and Edith was left alone.</p>
                  <p>Only another friend lost forever. Well, she had Sir Victor Catheron left—he
                     must suffice for all now.</p>
                  <p>All that day and most of the next she kept her room. It was no falsehood to say
                     she was ill—she was. She lay upon her bed, her dark eyes open, her hands
                     clasped over her head, looking blankly before her. To-morrow they must part,
                     and after to-morrow—but her mind gave it up; she could not look beyond.</p>
                  <p>She came downstairs when to-morrow came to say farewell. The white wrapper she
                     wore was not whiter than her face. Mr. Stuart shook hands in a nervous, hurried
                     sort of way that had grown habitual to him of late. Mrs. Stuart kissed her
                     fondly, Miss Stuart just touched her lips formally to her cheek, and Mr.
                     Charles Stuart held her cold fingers for two seconds in his warm clasp, looked,
                     with his own easy, pleasant smile, straight into her eyes, and said good-by
                     precisely as he said it to Lady Helena. Then it was all over; they were gone;
                     the wheels that bore them away crashed over the gravel. Edith Darrell felt as
                     though they were crashing over her heart.</p>
                  <p>That night the Stuarts were established in elegant apartments at Langham's
                     Hotel.</p>
                  <p>But alas for the frailty of human hopes! "The splendid time" Trixy so
                     confidently looked forward to never came. The very morning after their arrival
                     came one of the boys in uniform with another sinister orange envelope for the
                     head of the family. The head of the family chanced to be alone in his
                     dressing-room. He took it with trembling hand and bloodshot eyes, and tore it
                     open. A moment after there was a horrible cry like nothing human, then a heavy
                     fall. Mrs. Stuart rushed in with a scream, and found her husband lying on the
                     floor, the message in his hand, in a fit.</p>
                  <milestone n="* * * * * * * * * *" unit="typography"/>
                  <p>Captain Hammond had made an appointment with Charley to dine at St. James
                     Street that evening. Calling upon old friends kept the gallant captain of
                     Scotch Grays occupied all day; and as the shades of evening began to gather
                     over the West End, he stood impatiently awaiting his arrival. Mr. Stuart was
                     ten minutes late, and if there was one thing<pb n="264-265"
                        xml:id="VAC6448-00000132"/> in this mortal life that upset the young
                     warrior's equanimity, it was being kept ten minutes waiting for his dinner.
                     Five minutes more! Confound the fellow—would he never come? As the impatient
                     adjuration passed the captain's lips, Charley came in. He was rather pale.
                     Except for that, there was no change in him. Death itself could hardly have
                     wrought much change in Charley. He had not come to apologize; he had not come
                     to dine. He had come to tell the captain some very bad news. There had been
                     terrible commercial disasters of late in New York; they had involved his
                     father. His father had embarked almost every dollar of his fortune in some
                     bubble speculations that had gone up like a rocket and come down like a stick.
                     He had been losing immensely for the past month. This morning he had received a
                     cable message, telling him the crash had come. He was irretrievably, past all
                     hope of redemption, ruined.</p>
                  <p>All this Charley told in his quietest voice, looking out through the great bay
                     window at the bustle and whirl of fashionable London life, at the hour of seven
                     in the evening. Captain Hammond, smoking a cigar, listened in gloomy silence,
                     feeling particularly uncomfortable, and not knowing in the least what to say.
                     He took out his cheroot and spoke at last.</p>
                  <p>"It's a deuced bad state of affairs, Charley. Have you thought of
                     anything?"</p>
                  <p>"I've thought of suicide," Charley answered, "and made all the preliminary
                     arrangements. I took out my razor-case, examined the edges, found the sharpest,
                     and—put it carefully away again. I loaded all the chambers of my revolver, and
                     locked it up. I sauntered by the classic banks of the Serpentine, sleeping
                     tranquilly in the rays of the sunset (that sounds like poetry, but I don't mean
                     poetry). Of the three I think I prefer it, and if the worst comes to the worst,
                     it's there still, and it's pleasant and cool."</p>
                  <p>"How do your mother and sister take it?" Captain Hammond gloomily asked.</p>
                  <p>"My mother is one of those happy-go-lucky, apathetic sort of people who never
                     break their hearts over anything. She said 'O dear me!' several times, I
                     believe, and cried a little. Trix hasn't time to 'take it' at all. She is
                     absorbed sorbed all day in attending her father. The fit turns out not to be
                     dangerous at present, but he lies in a sort of stupor, a lethargy from which
                     nothing can rouse him. Of course our first step will be to return to New York
                     immediately. Beggars—and I take it that's about what we are at present—have no
                     business at Langham's."</p>
                  <p>Captain Hammond opened his bearded lips as though to speak, thought better of
                     it, replaced his cigar again between them in moody silence, and stared hard at
                     nothing out of the window.</p>
                  <p>"I called this afternoon upon the London agent of the Cunard ships," resumed
                     Charley, "and found that one sails in four days. Providentially two cabins
                     remained untaken; I secured them at once. In four days, then, we sail.
                     Meantime, old fellow, if you'll drop in and speak a word to mother and Trix,
                     you will be doing a friendly deed. Poor souls! they are awfully cut up."</p>
                  <p>Captain Hammond started to his feet. He seized Charley's hand in a grip of
                     iron. "Old boy!" he began—he never got further. The torrent of eloquence dried
                     up suddenly, and a shake of the hand that made Charley wince finished the
                     sentence.</p>
                  <p>"I shall be fully occupied in the meantime," Charley said, taking his hat and
                     turning to go, "and they'll be a great deal alone. If I can find time I'll run
                     down to Cheshire, and tell my cousin. As we may not meet again, I should like
                     to say 'good-by.'" He departed.</p>
                  <p>There was no sleep that night in the Stuart apartments. Mr. Stuart was
                     pronounced out of danger and able to travel, but he still lay in that lethargic
                     trance—not speaking at all, and seemingly not suffering. Next day Charley
                     started for Cheshire.</p>
                  <p>"She doesn't deserve it," his sister said bitterly; "I wouldn't go if I were
                     you. She has her lover—her fortune. What are we or our misfortunes to her? She
                     has neither heart, nor gratitude, nor affection. She isn't worth a thought, and
                     never was—there!"</p>
                  <p>"I wouldn't be too hard upon her, Trix, if I were you," her brother answered
                     coolly. "You would have taken Sir Victor yourself, you know, if you could have
                     got him. I will go."</p>
                  <pb n="266-267" xml:id="VAC6448-00000133"/>
                  <p>He went. The long, bright summer day passed; at six he was in Chester. There
                     was some delay in procuring a conveyance to Powyss Place, and the drive was a
                     lengthy one. Twilight had entirely fallen, and lamps glimmered in the windows
                     of the old stone mansion as he alighted.</p>
                  <p>The servant stared, as he ushered him in, at his pale face and dusty
                     garments.</p>
                  <p>"You will tell Miss Darrell I wish to see her at once, and alone," he said,
                     slipping a shilling into the man's hand.</p>
                  <p>He took a seat in the familiar reception-room, and waited. Would she keep him
                     long, he wondered—would she come to him—<emph>would</emph> she come at all?
                     Yes, he knew she would, let him send for her, married or single, when and how
                     he might, he knew she would come.</p>
                  <p>She entered as the thought crossed his mind, hastily, with a soft silken
                     rustle, a waft of perfume. He rose up and looked at her; so for the space of
                     five seconds they stood silently, face to face.</p>
                  <p>To the last hour of his life Charley Stuart remembered her, as he saw her then,
                     and always with a sharp pang of the same pain.</p>
                  <p>She was dressed for a dinner party. She wore violet silk, trailing far behind
                     her, violet shot with red. Her graceful shoulders rose up exquisitely out of
                     the point lace trimmings, her arms sparkled in the lights. A necklace of
                     amethysts set in clusters, with diamonds between, shone upon her neck;
                     amethysts and diamonds were in her ears, and clasping the arms above the
                     elbows. Her waving, dark hair was drawn back off her face, and crowned with an
                     ivy wreath. The soft, abundant wax lights showered down upon her. So she stood,
                     resplendent as a queen, radiant as a goddess. There was a look on Charley
                     Stuart's face, a light in his gray eyes, very rare to see. He only bowed and
                     stood aloof.</p>
                  <p>"I have surprised you, I am sure—interrupted you, I greatly fear. You will
                     pardon both I know, when I tell you what has brought me here."</p>
                  <p>In very few words he told her—the great tragedies of life are always easily
                     told. They were ruined—he had engaged their passage by the next steamer—he had
                     merely, run down as they were never likely to meet again—for the sake of old
                     times, to say good-by.</p>
                  <p>Old times! Something rose in the girl's throat, and seemed to choke her. Oh, of
                     all the base, heartless, mercenary, ungrateful wretches on earth, was there
                     another so heartless, so ungrateful as she! Poor—Charley poor! For one
                     moment—one—the impulse came upon her to give up all—to go with him to beggary
                     if need be. Only for one moment—I will do Miss Darrell's excellent worldly
                     wisdom this justice—only one.</p>
                  <p>"I see you are dressed for a party—I will not detain you a second longer. I
                     could not depart comfortably, considering that you came over in our care,
                     without informing you why we leave so abruptly. You are safe. Your destiny is
                     happily settled. I can give to your father a good account of my stewardship.
                     You have my sincerest wishes for your health and happiness, and I am sure you
                     will never quite forget us. Good-by, Miss Darrell." He held out his hand. "My
                     congratulations are premature, but let me offer them now to the future Lady
                     Catheron."</p>
                  <p>"Miss Darrell!" When, in all the years that were gone, had he ever called her
                     that before? She arose and gave him her hand—proud, pale.</p>
                  <p>"I thank you," she said coldly. "I will send Lady Helena and Sir Victor to you
                     at once. They will wish to see you, of course. Good-by, Mr. Stuart. Let us hope
                     things may turn out better than you think. Give my dearest love to Trix, if she
                     will accept it. Once more, good-by."</p>
                  <p>She swept to the door in her brilliant dress, her perfumed laces, her shining
                     jewels—the glittering fripperies for which her womanhood was to be sold. He
                     stood quite still in the centre of the room, as she had left him, watching her.
                     So beautiful, so cold-blooded, he was thinking; were all her kind like this?
                     And poets sing and novelists rave of woman's love! A half smile came over his
                     lips as he thought of it. It was very pretty to read of in books; in real life
                     it was—like this!</p>
                  <p>She laid her hand on the silver handle of the door—then she paused—looked back,
                     all the womanliness, all the passion of her life stirred to its depths. It was
                        good-by<pb n="268-269" xml:id="VAC6448-00000134"/> forever to Charley. There
                     was a great sob, and pride bowed and fell. She rushed back—two impetuous arms
                     went round his neck; she drew his face down, and kissed him
                     passionately—once—twice.</p>
                  <p>"Good-by, Charley—my darling—forever and ever!"</p>
                  <p>She threw him from her almost violently, and rushed out of the room. Whether
                     she went to tell Lady Helena and Sir Victor of his presence he neither knew nor
                     cared. He was in little mood to meet either of them just then.</p>
                  <p>Five minutes later, and, under the blue silvery summer night, he was whirling
                     away back to Chester. When the midnight stars shone in the sky he was half way
                     up to London, with Edith's farewell words in his ears, Edith's first, last kiss
                     on his lips.</p>

                  <head type="sub">THE SUMMONS.</head>
                  <p>THE sun was just rising over the million roofs and spires of the great city, as
                     Charley's hansom dashed up to the door of Langham's hotel. He ran up to his
                     father's room, and on the threshold encountered Trix, pale and worn with her
                     night's watching, but wearing a peculiarly happy and contented little look
                     despite it all. Charley did not stop to notice the look, he asked after his
                     father.</p>
                  <p>"Pa's asleep," Trix replied, "so's ma. It's of no use your disturbing either of
                     them. Pa's pretty well; stupid as you left him; doesn't care to talk, but able
                     to eat and sleep. The doctor says there is nothing at all to hinder his
                     travelling to Liverpool to-day. And now, Charley," Trix concluded, looking
                     compassionately at her brother's pale, tired face, "as you look used up after
                     your day and night's travelling, suppose you go to bed; I'll wake you in time
                     for breakfast, and you needn't worry about anything. Captain Hammond has been
                     here," says Trix, blushing in the wan, morning light, "and he will attend to
                     everything."</p>
                  <p>Charley nodded and turned to go, but his sister detained him.</p>
                  <p>"You—you saw her, I suppose?" she said hesitatingly.</p>
                  <p>"Edith do you mean?" Charley looks at her full. "Yes, I saw her. As I went down
                     for the purpose, I was hardly likely to fail."</p>
                  <p>"And what has she to say for herself?" Trix asks bitterly.</p>
                  <p>"Very little; we were not together ten minutes in all. She was dressed for a
                     party of some kind, and I did not detain her."</p>
                  <p>"A party?" Trix repeats; "and we like this! Did she send no message at
                     all?"</p>
                  <p>"She sent you her dearest love."</p>
                  <p>"She may keep it—let her give it to Sir Victor Catheron. I don't want her love,
                     or anything else belonging to her!" Trix cries, explosively. "Of all the
                     heartless, ungrateful girls—"</p>
                  <p>Her brother stops her with a look. Those handsome gray eyes of Charley's can be
                     very stern eyes when he likes.</p>
                  <p>"As I said before, that will do, Trix. Edith is one of the wise virgins we read
                     of—she has chosen by long odds the better part. What could we do with her now?
                     take her back and return her to her father and step-mother, and the dull life
                     she hated? As for gratitude, I confess I don't see where the gratitude is to
                     come in. We engaged her at a fixed salary: so much cleverness, French, German,
                     and general usefulness on her part; on ours, so many hundred dollars per annum.
                     Let me say this, Trix, once and for good: as you don't seem able to say
                     anything pleasant of Edith, suppose you don't speak of her at all?"</p>
                  <p>And then Charley, with that resolute light in his eyes, that resolute
                     compression of his lips, turned and walked upstairs. It was an unusually
                     lengthy, and unusually grave speech for him, and his volatile sister was duly
                     impressed. She shrugged her shoulders, and went back to her pa's room.</p>
                  <p>"The amount of it is," she thought, "he is as fond of her as ever, and can't
                     bear, as he has lost her, to hear her<pb n="270-271" xml:id="VAC6448-00000135"
                     /> spoken of. The idea of his scampering down into Chester to see her once
                     more! Ridiculous! She <emph>is</emph> heartless, and I hate her!"</p>
                  <p>And then Trixy took out her lace pocket-handkerchief, and suddenly burst out
                     crying. O dear, it was bad enough to lose one's fortune, to have one's European
                     tour nipped in the bud, without losing Edith, just as Edith had wound her way
                     most closely round Trixy's warm little heart. There was but one drop of honey
                     in all the bitter cup—a drop six feet high and stout in proportion—Captain
                     Angus Hammond.</p>
                  <p>For Captain Angus Hammond, as though to prove that <emph>all</emph> the world
                     was not base and mercenary, had come nobly to the front, and proposed to Trixy.
                     And Trixy, surprised and grateful, and liking him very much, had hesitated, and
                     smiled, and dimpled, and blushed, and objected, and finally begun to cry, and
                     sobbed out "yes" through her tears.</p>
                  <p>Charley slept until twelve—they were to depart for Liverpool by the two o'clock
                     express. Then his sister, attired for travelling, awoke him, and they all
                     breakfasted together; Mr. Stuart, too, looking very limp and miserable, and
                     Captain Hammond, whose state would have been one of idiotic happiness, had not
                     the thought that the ocean to-morrow would roll between him and the object of
                     his young affections, thrown a damper upon him. He was going to Liverpool with
                     them, however; it would be a mournful consolation to see them off. They
                     travelled second-class. As Charley said, "they must let themselves down
                     easily—the sooner they began the better—and third-class to start with might be
                     coming it a little too strong. Let them have a few cushions and comforts
                     still."</p>
                  <p>Mr. Stuart kept close to his wife. He seemed to cling to her, and depend upon
                     her, like a child. It was wonderful, it was pitiful how utterly shattered he
                     had become. His son looked after him with a solicitous tenderness quite new in
                     all their experience of Charley. Captain Hammond and Trixy kept in a corner
                     together, and talked in saccharine undertones, looking foolish, and guilty, and
                     happy.</p>
                  <p>They reached Liverpool late in the evening, and drove to the Adelphi. At twelve
                     next day they were to get on board the tender, and be conveyed down the Mersey
                     to their ship.</p>
                  <p>Late that evening, after dinner, and over their cigars, Captain Hammond opened
                     his masculine heart, and, with vast hesitation and much embarrassment, poured
                     into Charley's ear the tale of his love.</p>
                  <p>"I ought to tell the governor, you know," the young officer said, "but he's so
                     deucedly cut up as it is, you know, that I couldn't think of it. And it's no
                     use fidgeting your mother—Trixy will tell her. I love your sister, Charley, and
                     I believe I've been in love with her ever since that day in Ireland. I ain't a
                     lady's man, and I never cared a fig for a girl before in my life; but, by
                     George! I'm awfully fond of Trixy. I ain't an elder son, and I ain't clever, I
                     know," cried the poor, young gentleman sadly; "but if Trix will consent, by
                     George! I'll go with her to church tomorrow. There's my pay—my habits ain't
                     expensive, like some fellows—we could get along on that for a while, and then I
                     have expectations from my grandmother. I've had expectations from my
                     grandmother for the last twelve years, sir, and every day of those twelve years
                     she's been dying; and, by George! she ain't dead yet, you know. It's
                     wonderful—I give you my word—it's wonderful, the way grandmothers and maiden
                     aunts with money do hold out. As Dundreary says, 'It's something no fellow can
                     understand.' But that ain't what I wanted to say—it's this: if you're willing,
                     and Trix is willing, I'll get leave of absence and come over by the next ship,
                     and we'll be married. I—I'll be the happiest fellow alive, Stuart, the day your
                     sister becomes my wife."</p>
                  <p>You are not to suppose that Captain Hammond made this speech fluently and
                     eloquently, as I have reported it. The words are his, but the long pauses, the
                     stammerings, the repetitions, the hesitations I have mercifully withheld. His
                     cigar was quite smoked out by the time he had finished, and with nervous haste
                     he set about lighting another. For Mr. Stuart, titled back in his chair, his
                     shining boots on the window-sill of the drawing-room, gazing out at the gas-lit
                     highways of Liverpool, he listened in abstracted silence. There was a long
                     pause after the captain concluded—then Charley opened his lips and spoke:</p>
                  <pb n="272-273" xml:id="VAC6448-00000136"/>
                  <p>"This is all nonsense, you know, Hammond," he said gravely, "folly—madness, on
                     your part. A week ago, when we thought Trixy an heiress, the case looked very
                     different, you see; then I would have shaken hands with you, and bestowed my
                     blessing upon your virtuous endeavors. But all that is changed now. As far as I
                     can see, we are beggars—literally beggars—without a dollar; and when we get to
                     New York nothing will remain for Trixy and me but to roll up our sleeves and go
                     to work. What we are to work at, Heaven knows; we have come up like the lilies
                     of the field, who toil not, neither do they spin. It is rather late in the day
                     to take lessons in spinning now, but you see there is no help for it. I don't
                     say much, Hammond, but I feel this. I hold a man to be something less than a
                     man who will go through life howling over a loss of this kind. There are worse
                     losses than that of fortune in the world." He paused a moment, and his dreamy
                     eyes looked far out over the crowded city street. "I always thought my father
                     was as rich as Crow—Cræ—the rich fellow, you know, they always quote in print.
                     It seemed an impossibility that we could ever be poor. But we are, and there is
                     an end of it. Your family are wealthy, your father has a title; do you think
                        <emph>he</emph> would listen to this for a moment?"</p>
                  <p>"My family may go—hang!" burst forth the captain. "What the deuce have they got
                     to do with it. If Trixy is willing—"</p>
                  <p>"Trixy will not be willing to enter any family on those terms," Trixy's brother
                     said, in that quiet way of his, which could yet be such an obstinate way; "and
                     what I mean to say is this: A marriage for the present is totally and
                     absolutely out of the question. You and she may make love to your heart's
                     content—write letters across the ocean by the bushel, be engaged as fast as you
                     please, and remain constant at long as you like. But marriage—no, no, no!"</p>
                  <p>That was the end of it. Charley was not to be moved—neither, indeed, on the
                     marriage question, was Trix. "Did Angus think her a wretch—a monster—to desert
                     her poor pa and ma, just now, when they wanted her most, and go off with him?
                     Not likely. He might take back his ring if he liked—she would not hold him to
                     his engagement—she was ready and willing to set him free—"<q>
                        <lg type="quotation">
                           <l>"So Jamie, an' ye dinna wait</l>
                           <l>Ye canna marry me,"</l>
                        </lg>
                     </q> sang Charley, as Trix broke down here and sobbed. Then with a half smile
                     on his face he went out of the room, and Trixy's tears were dried on Angus
                     Hammond's faithful breast.</p>
                  <p>Next day, a gray overcast, gloomy day, the ship sailed. Captain Hammond went
                     with them on board, returning in the tender. Trix, leaning on her father's arm,
                     crying behind her veil; Charley, by his mother's side, stood on deck while the
                     tender steamed back to the dock. And there under the gray sky, with the bleak
                     wind blowing, and the ship tossing on the ugly short chop of the river, they
                     took their parting look at the English shore, with but one friendly face to
                     watch them away, and that the ginger-whiskered face of Captain Hammond.</p>
                  <milestone n="* * * * * * * * *" unit="typography"/>
                  <p>Edith Darrell left Charley Stuart, and returned to the brilliantly-lit drawing
                     room, where her lover and Lady Helena and their friends sat waiting the
                     announcement of dinner. Sir Victor's watchful eyes saw her enter. Sir Victor's
                     loving glance saw the pallor, like the pallor of death, upon her face. She
                     walked steadily over to a chair in the curtained recess of a window, He was
                     held captive by Lady Portia Hampton, and could not join her. A second after
                     there was a sort of sobbing gasp—a heavy fall. Everybody started, and arose in
                     consternation. Miss Darrell had fallen from her chair, and lay on the floor in
                     a dead faint.</p>
                  <p>Her lover, as pale almost as herself, lifted her in his arms, the cold,
                     beautiful face lying, like death on his shoulder. But it was not death.</p>
                  <p>They carried her up to her room—restoratives were applied, and presently the
                     great dark eyes opened, and looked up into her lover's face.</p>
                  <p>She covered her own with her hands, and turned away from him, as though the
                     sight was distasteful to her. He bent above her, almost agonized that anything
                     should ail his idol.</p>
                  <p>"My darling," he said tremulously. "What was it? What can I do for you? Tell
                     me."</p>
                  <pb n="274-275" xml:id="VAC6448-00000137"/>
                  <p>"Go away," was the dull answer; "only that—go away everybody, and leave me
                     alone."</p>
                  <p>They strove to reason with her—some one sought to stay with her. Lady Helena,
                     Sir Victor—either would give up their place at dinner and remain at the
                     bedside.</p>
                  <p>"No, no, no!" was her answering cry, "they must not. She was better again—she
                     needed no one, she wanted nothing, <emph>only</emph> to be left alone."</p>
                  <p>They left her alone—she was trembling with nervous excitement, a little more
                     and hysterics would set in—they dared not disobey. They left her alone, with a
                     watchful attendant on the alert in the dressing-room.</p>
                  <p>She lay upon the dainty French bed, her dark hair, from which the flowers had
                     been taken, tossed over the white pillows, her hands clasped above her head,
                     her dark, large eyes fixed on the opposite wall. So she lay motionless,
                     neither, speaking nor stirring for hours, with a sort of dull, numb aching at
                     her heart. They stole in softly to her bedside many times through the night,
                     always to find her like that, lying with blank, wide-open eyes, never noticing
                     nor speaking to them. When morning broke she awoke from a dull sort of sleep,
                     her head burning, her lips parched, her eyes glittering with fever.</p>
                  <p>They sent for the doctor. He felt her pulse, looked at her tongue, asked
                     questions, and shook his head. Overwrought nerves the whole of it. Her mind
                     must have been over-excited for some time, and this was the result. No danger
                     was to be apprehended; careful nursing would restore her in a week or two,
                     combined with perfect quiet. Then a change of air and scene would be
                     beneficial—say a trip to Scarborough or Torquay now. They would give her this
                     saline draught just at present and not worry about her. The young lady would be
                     all right, on his word and honor, my dear Sir Victor, in a week or two.</p>
                  <p>Sir Victor listened very gloomily. He had heard from the hall porter of Mr.
                     Stuart's flying visit, and of his brief interview with Miss Darrell. It was
                     very strange—his hasty coming, his hasty going, without seeing any of them, his
                     interview with Edith, and her fainting-fit immediately after. Why had he come?
                     What had transpired at that interview? The green-eyed monster took the
                     baronet's heart between his finger and thumb, and gave it a most terrible
                     twinge.</p>
                  <p>He watched over her when they let him into that darkened chamber, as a mother
                     may over an only and darling child. If he lost her!</p>
                  <p>"O Heaven!" he cried passionately, rebelliously, "rather let me die than
                     that!"</p>
                  <p>He asked her no questions—he was afraid. His heart sank within him, she lay so
                     cold, so white, so utterly indifferent whether he came or went. He was nothing
                     to her—nothing. Would he ever be?</p>
                  <p>Lady Helena, less in love, and consequently less a coward, asked the question
                     her nephew dared not ask: "What had brought Mr. Charles Stuart to Powyss Place?
                     What had made her, Edith, faint?"</p>
                  <p>The dark sombre eyes turned from the twilight prospect, seen through the open
                     window, and met her ladyship's suspicious eyes steadily. "Mr. Stuart had come
                     down to tell her some very bad news. His father had failed—they were ruined.
                     They had to leave England in two days for home—he had only come to bid her a
                     last farewell."</p>
                  <p>Then the sombre brown eyes went back to the blue-gray sky, the crystal July
                     moon, the velvet, green grass, the dark murmuring trees, the birds twittering
                     in the leafy branches, and she was still again.</p>
                  <p>Lady Helena was shocked, surprised, grieved. But—why had Edith fainted?</p>
                  <p>"I don't know," Edith answered. "I never fainted before in my life. I think I
                     have not been very strong lately. I felt well enough when I returned to the
                     drawing-room—a minute after I grew giddy and fell. I remember no more."</p>
                  <p>"We will take you away, my dear," her ladyship said cheerfully. "We will take
                     you to Torquay. Changes of air and scene, as the doctor says, are the tonics
                     you need to brace your nerves. Ah! old or young, all we poor women are martyrs
                     to nerves."</p>
                  <p>They took her to Torquay in the second week of July. A pretty little villa near
                     Hesketh Crescent had been hired; four servants from Powyss Place preceded them;
                     Sir Victor escorted them, and saw them duly installed. He returned<pb
                        n="276-277" xml:id="VAC6448-00000138"/> again—partly because the work going
                     on at Catheron Royals needed his presence, partly because Lady Helena gravely
                     and earnestly urged it.</p>
                  <p>"My dear Victor," she said, "don't force too much of your society upon Edith. I
                     know girls. Even if she were in love with you"—the young man winced—"she would
                     grow tired of a lover who never left her sight. All women do. If you want her
                     to grow fond of you, go away, write to her every day—not <emph>too</emph>
                     lover-like love-letters; one may have a surfeit of sweets; just cheerful,
                     pleasant, sensible letters—as a young man in love <emph>can</emph> write. Come
                     down this day three weeks, and, if we are ready, take us home."</p>
                  <p>The young man made a wry face—much as he used to do when his good aunt urged
                     him to swallow a dose of nauseous medicine.</p>
                  <p>"In three weeks! My dear Lady Helena, what are you thinking of? We are to be
                     married the first week of September."</p>
                  <p>"October, Victor—October—not a day sooner. You must wait until Edith is
                     completely restored. There is no such desperate haste. You are not likely to
                     lose her."</p>
                  <p>"I am not so sure of that," he said, half sullenly under his breath; "and a
                     postponed marriage is the most unlucky thing in the world."</p>
                  <p>"I don't believe in luck; I do in common-sense," his aunt retorted, rather
                     sharply. "You are like a spoiled child, Victor, crying for the moon. It is
                     Edith's own request, if you will have it—this postponement. And Edith is right.
                     You don't want a limp, pallid, half-dying bride, I suppose. Give her time to
                     get strong—give her time to learn to like you—your patient waiting will go far
                     towards it. Take my word, it will be the wiser course."</p>
                  <p>There was nothing for it but obedience. He took his leave and went back to
                     Cheshire. It was his first parting from Edith. How he felt it, no words can
                     tell. But the fact remained—he went.</p>
                  <p>She drew a long, deep breath as she said good-by, and watched him away. Ah!
                     what a different farewell to that other only two short weeks ago. She tried not
                     to think of that—honestly and earnestly; she tried to forget the face that
                     haunted her, the voice that rang in her ears, the warm hand-clasp, the kisses
                     that sealed their parting. Her love, her duty, her allegiance, her thoughts—all
                     were due to Sir Victor now. In the quiet days that were to be there, she would
                     try to forget the love of her life—try to remember that of all men on earth Sir
                     Victor Catheron was the only man she had any right to think of.</p>
                  <p>And she succeeded partly. Wandering along the tawny sands, with the blue bright
                     sea spreading away before her, drinking in the soft salt air, Edith grew strong
                     in body and mind once more. Charley Stuart had passed forever out of her
                     life—driven hence by her own acts; she would be the most drivelling of idiots,
                     the basest of traitors, to pine for him now. Her step grew elastic, her eye
                     grew bright, her beauty and bloom returned. She met hosts of pleasant people,
                     and her laugh came sweetly to Lady Helena's ears. Since her nephew
                        <emph>must</emph> marry—since his heart was set on this girl—Lady Helena
                     wished to see her a healthy and happy wife.</p>
                  <p>Sir Victor's letters came daily; the girl smiled as she glanced carelessly over
                     them, tore them up, and answered—about half. Love him she did not; but she was
                     learning to think very kindly of him. It is quite in the scope of a woman's
                     complex nature to love one man passionately, and like another very much. It was
                     Edith's case—she liked Sir Victor; and when, at the end of three weeks, he came
                     to join them, she could approach and give him her hand with a frank, glad smile
                     of welcome. The three weeks had been as three centuries to this ardent young
                     lover. His delight to see his darling blooming, and well, and wholly restored,
                     almost repaid him. And three days after the triad returned together to Powyss
                     Place, to part, as he whispered, no more.</p>
                  <p>It was the middle of August now. In spite of Edith's protest, grand
                     preparations were being made for the wedding—a magnificent trousseau having
                     been ordered.</p>
                  <p>"Simplicity is all very well," Lady Helena answered Miss Darrell, "but Sir
                     Victor Catheron's bride must dress as becomes Sir Victor Catheron's station. In
                     three years from now, if you prefer white muslin and simplicity, prefer it by
                     all means. About the wedding-dress, you will kindly let me have my own
                     way."</p>
                  <pb n="278-279" xml:id="VAC6448-00000139"/>
                  <p>Edith desisted; she appealed no more; passive to all changes, she let herself
                     drift along. The third of October was to be the wedding-day; my ladies
                     Gwendoline and Laura Drexel, the two chief bridesmaids—then three others, all
                     daughters of old friends of Lady Helena. The pretty, picturesque town of
                     Carnarvon, in North Wales, was to be the nest of the turtledoves during the
                     honeymoon—then away to the Continent, then back for the Christmas festivities
                     at Catheron Royals.</p>
                  <p>Catheron Royals was fast becoming a palace for a princess—its grounds a sort of
                     enchanted fairy-land. Edith walked through its lefty, echoing halls, its long
                     suites of sumptuous drawing-rooms, libraries, billiard and ball rooms. The
                     suite fitted up for herself was gorgeous in purple and gold—velvet and bullion
                     fringe—in pictures that were wonders of loveliness—in mirror-lined walls, in
                     all that boundless wealth and love could lavish on its idol. Leaning on her
                     proud and happy bridegroom's arm, she walked through them all, half dazed with
                     all the wealth of color and splendor, and wondering if "I be I." Was it a fairy
                     tale, or was all this for Edith Darrell?—Edith Darrell, who such a brief while
                     gone, used to sweep and dust, sew and darn, in dull, unlovely Sandypoint, and
                     get a new merino dress twice a year? No, it could not be—such transformation
                     scenes never took place out of a Christmas pantomime or a burlesque Arabian
                     Night—it was all a dream—a fairy fortune that, like fairy gold, would change to
                     dull slate stones at light of day. She would never be Lady Catheron, never be
                     mistress of this glittering Aladdin's Palace. It grew upon her day after day,
                     this feeling of vagueness, of unreality. She was just adrift upon a shining
                     river, and one of these days she would go stranded ashore on hidden quicksands
                     and foul ground. Something would happen. The days went by like dreams—it was
                     the middle of September. In little more than a fortnight would come the third
                     of October and the wedding-day. But something would happen. As surely as she
                     lived and saw it all, she felt that something would happen.</p>
                  <p>Something did. On the eighteenth of September there came from London, late in
                     the evening, a telegram for Lady Helena. Sir Victor was with Edith at the piano
                     in the drawing-room. In hot haste his aunt sent for him; he went at once. He
                     found her pale, terrified, excited; she held out the telegram to him without a
                     word. He read it slowly: "Come at once. Fetch Victor. <emph>He</emph> is
                     dying.—INEZ."</p>
               </div>
               <div type="chapter">
                  <head>CHAPTER XIX.</head>
                  <head type="sub">AT POPLAR LODGE.</head>
                  <p>HALF an hour had passed and Sir Victor did not return. Edith still remained at
                     the piano, the gleam of the candies falling upon her thoughtful face, playing
                     the weird "Moonlight Sonata." She played so softly that the shrill whistling of
                     the wind around the gables, the heavy soughing of the trees, was plainly
                     audible above it. Ten minutes more, and her lover did not return. Wondering a
                     little what the telegram could contain, she arose and walked to the window,
                     drew the curtains and looked out. There was no moon, but the stars were
                     numberless, and lit dimly the park. As she stood watching the trees, writhing
                     in the autumnal gale, she heard a step behind her. She glanced over her
                     shoulder with a half smile—a smile that died on her lips as she saw the grave
                     pallor of Sir Victor's face.</p>
                  <p>"What has happened?" she asked quickly. "Lady Helena's dispatch contained bad
                     news? It is nothing"—she caught her breath—"nothing concerning the
                     Stuarts?"</p>
                  <p>"Nothing concerning the Stuarts. It is from London—from Inez Catheron. It
                     is—that my father is dying."</p>
                  <p>She said nothing. She stood looking at him, and waiting for more.</p>
                  <p>"It seems a strange thing to say," he went on, "that one does not know whether
                     to call one's father's death ill news or not. But considering the living death
                     he has led for twenty-three years, one can hardly call death and release a
                     misfortune. The strange thing, the alarming thing about it, is the way Lady
                     Helena takes it. One would think she might be prepared, that considering his
                     life and sufferings,<pb n="280-281" xml:id="VAC6448-00000140"/> she would
                     rather rejoice than grieve: but, I give you my word, the way in which she takes
                     it honestly frightens me."</p>
                  <p>Still Edith made no reply—still her thoughtful eyes were fixed upon his
                     face.</p>
                  <p>"She seems stunned, paralyzed—actually paralyzed with a sort of terror. And
                     that terror seems to be, not for him or herself, but for <emph>me</emph>. She
                     will explain nothing; she seems unable; all presence of mind seems to have left
                     her. No time is to be lost; there is a train in two hours: we go by that. By
                     daylight we will be in London; how long before we return I cannot say. I hate
                     the thought of a death casting its gloom over our marriage. I dread horribly
                     the thought of a second postponement—I hate the idea of leaving you here
                     alone."</p>
                  <p>
                     <emph>Something will happen</emph>. All along her heart had whispered it, and
                     here it was. And yet the long tense breath she drew was very like a breath of
                     relief.</p>
                  <p>"You are not to think of me," she said quietly, after a pause. "Your duty is to
                     the dying. Nothing will befall me in your absence—don't let the thought of me
                     in any way trouble you. I shall do very well with my books and music; and Lady
                     Gwendoline, I dare say, will drive over occasionally and see me. Of course
                        <emph>why</emph> you go to London is for the present a secret?"</p>
                  <p>"Of course. What horrible explanations and gossip the fact of his death at this
                     late date will involve. Every one has thought him dead for over twenty years. I
                     can't understand this secrecy, this mystery—the world should have been told the
                     truth from the first. If there was any motive I suppose they will tell me
                     to-night, and I confess I shrink from hearing any more than I have already
                     heard."</p>
                  <p>His face was very dark, very gloomy, as he gazed out at the starlit night. A
                     presentiment that something evil was in store for him weighed upon him,
                     engendered, perhaps, by the incomprehensible alarm of Lady Helena.</p>
                  <p>The preparations for the journey were hurried and few. Lady Helena descended to
                     the carriage, leaning on her maid's arm. She seemed to have forgotten Edith
                     completely, until Edith advanced to say good-by. Then in a constrained,
                     mechanical sort of way she gave her her hand, spoke a few brief words of
                     farewell, and drew back into a corner of the carriage, a darker shadow in the
                     gloom.</p>
                  <p>In the drawing-room, in travelling-cap and overcoat, Sir Victor held Edith's
                     hand, lingering strangely over the parting—strangely reluctant to say
                     farewell.</p>
                  <p>"Do you believe in presentiments, Edith?" he asked. "I have a presentiment that
                     we will never meet again like this—that something will have come between us
                     before we meet again. I cannot define it. I cannot explain it. I only know it
                     is there."</p>
                  <p>"I don't believe in presentiments," Edith answered cheerfully. "I never had one
                     in my life. I believe they are only another name for dyspepsia; and telegrams
                     and hurried night journeys are mostly conductive to gloom. When the sun shines
                     to-morrow morning, and you have had a strong cup of coffee, you will be ready
                     to laugh at your presentiments. Nothing is likely to come between us."</p>
                  <p>"Nothing shall—nothing, I swear it!" He caught her in his arms with a straining
                     clasp, and kissed her passionately for the first time. "Nothing in this lower
                     world shall ever separate us. I have no life now apart from you. And nothing,
                     not death itself, shall postpone our marriage. It was postponed once; I wish it
                     never had been. It shall never be postponed again."</p>
                  <p>"Go, go!" Edith cried; "some one is coming—you will be late."</p>
                  <p>There was not a minute to spare. He dashed down the stairs, down the portico
                     steps, and sprang into the carriage beside his aunt. The driver cracked his
                     whip, the horses started, the carriage rolled away into the gloom and the
                     night. Edith Darrell stood at the window until the last sound of the wheels
                     died away, and for long after. A strange silence seemed to have fallen upon the
                     great house with the going of its mistress. In the embrasure of the window, in
                     the dim blue starlight, the girl sat down to think. There was some mystery,
                     involving the murder of the late Lady Catheron, at work here, she felt. Grief
                     for the loss of his wife might have driven Sir Victor Catheron mad, but why
                     make such a profound secret of it? Why give out that he was dead? Why allow his
                     son to step into the title before his time? If Juan Catheron were the murderer,
                     Juan Catheron<pb n="282-283" xml:id="VAC6448-00000141"/> eron the outlaw and
                     Pariah of his family, why screen him as though he had been the idol and
                     treasure of all, and let the dead go unavenged? Why this strange terror of Lady
                     Helena's? why her insufferable aversion to her nephew marrying at all?</p>
                  <p>Yes, there was something hidden, something on the cards not yet brought to
                     light; and to the death-bed of Sir Victor Catheron the elder, Sir Victor
                     Catheron the younger had been summoned to hear the whole truth.</p>
                  <p>Would he tell it to her upon his return, she wondered. Well, if he did not, she
                     had no right to complain—she had <emph>her</emph> secret from him. There was
                     madness in the family—she shrank a little at the thought for the first time.
                     Who knew, whether latent and unsuspected, the taint might not be in the blood
                     and brains of the man to whom she was about to bind herself for life? Who was
                     to tell when it might break forth, in what horrible shape it might show itself?
                     To be the widowed wife of a madman—what wealth and title on earth could
                     compensate for that? She shivered as she sat, partly with the chill night air,
                     partly with the horror of the thought. In her youth, and health, and beauty,
                     her predecessor had been struck down, the bride of another Sir Victor. So long
                     she sat there that a clock up in the lofty turret struck, heavily and solemnly,
                     twelve. The house was still as the grave—all shut up except this room where she
                     sat, all retired except her maid and the butler. They yawned sleepily, and
                     waited for her to retire. Chilled and white, the girl arose at last, took her
                     night-light, and went slowly up to bed.</p>
                  <p>"Is the game worth the candle after all?" she thought. "Ah me! what a
                     miserable, vacillating creature I am. Whatever comes—the worst or the
                     best—there is nothing for it now but to go on to the end."</p>
                  <p>Meantime, through the warm, starry night, the train was speeding on to London,
                     bearing Sir Victor Catheron to the turning point of his life. He and his aunt
                     had their carriage all to themselves. Still in dead silence, still with that
                     pale, terrified look on her face, Lady Helena lay back in a corner among the
                     cushions. Once or twice her nephew spoke to her—the voice in which she answered
                     him hardly sounded like her own. He gave it up at last; there was nothing for
                     it but to wait and let the end come. He drew his cap over his eyes, lay back in
                     the opposite seat, and dozed and dreamed of Edith.</p>
                  <p>In the chill, gray light of an overcast morning they reached Easton station. A
                     sky like brown paper lay over the million roofs of the great Babylon; a dull,
                     dim fog, that stifled you, filled the air. The fog and raw cold were more like
                     November than the last month of summer. Blue and shivering in the chill light,
                     Sir Victor buttoned up his light overcoat, assisted his aunt into a cab, and
                     gave the order—"St. John's Wood. Drive for your life!"</p>
                  <p>Lady Helena knew Poplar Lodge, of course; once in the vicinity there would be
                     no trouble in finding it. Was he still alive, the young man wondered. How
                     strange seemed the thought that he was about to see his father at last. It was
                     like seeing the dead return. Was he sane, and would he know him when they
                     met?</p>
                  <p>The overcast morning threatened rain; it began to fall slowly and dismally as
                     they drove along. The London streets looked unutterably draggled and dreary,
                     seen at this early hour of the wet morning. The cab driver urged his horse to
                     its utmost speed, and presently the broad green expanse and tall trees of
                     Regent's Park came in view. Lady Helena gave the man his direction, and in ten
                     minutes they stopped before the tall, closed iron gates of a solitary villa. It
                     was Poplar Lodge.</p>
                  <p>The baronet paid the man's fare and dismissed him. He seized the gate-bell and
                     rang a peal that seemed to tinkle half a mile away. While he waited, holding an
                     umbrella over his aunt, he surveyed the premises.</p>
                  <p>It was a <choice>
                        <sic>greusome</sic>
                        <corr>gruesome</corr>
                     </choice>, prison-like place enough at this forlorn hour. The stone walls were
                     as high as his head, the view between the lofty iron gates was completely
                     obstructed by trees. Of the house itself, except the chimney-pots and the
                     curling smoke, not a glimpse was to be had. And for three-and-twenty years Inez
                     Catheron had buried herself alive here with a madman and two old servants! He
                     shuddered internally as he thought of it—surely, never devotion or atonement
                     equalled hers.</p>
                  <p>They waited nearly ten minutes in the rain; then a shambling footstep shambled
                     down the path, and an old<pb n="284-285" xml:id="VAC6448-00000142"/> face
                     peered out between the trellised iron work. "Who is it?" an old voice
                     asked.</p>
                  <p>"It is I, Hooper. Sir Victor and I. For pity's sake don't keep us standing here
                     in the rain."</p>
                  <p>"My lady! Praise be!" A key turned in the lock, the gate swung wide, and an
                     aged, white-haired man stood bowing before Lady Helena.</p>
                  <p>"Are we in time?" was her first breathless question. "Is your master
                     still—"</p>
                  <p>"Still alive, my lady—praise and thanks be! Just in time, and no more."</p>
                  <p>The dim old eyes of Hooper were fixed upon the young man's face.</p>
                  <p>"Like his father," the old lips said, and the old head shook ominously; "more's
                     the pity—like his father."</p>
                  <p>Lady Helena took her nephew's arm and hurried him, under the dripping trees, up
                     the avenue to the house. Five minutes brought them to it—a red brick villa, its
                     shutters all closed. The house-door stood ajar; without ceremony her ladyship
                     entered. As she did so, another door suddenly opened, and Inez Catheron came
                     out.</p>
                  <p>The fixedly pale face, could by no possibility grow paler—could by no
                     possibility change its marble calm. But the deep, dusk eyes looked at the young
                     man, it seemed to him, with an infinite compassion.</p>
                  <p>"We are in time?" his aunt spoke.</p>
                  <p>"You are in time. In one moment you will see him. There is not a second to
                     lose, and he knows it. He has begged you to be brought to him the moment you
                     arrive."</p>
                  <p>"He knows, then. Oh, thank God! Reason has returned at last."</p>
                  <p>"Reason has returned. Since yesterday he has been perfectly sane. His first
                     words were that his son should be sent for, that the truth should be told."</p>
                  <p>There was a half-suppressed sob. Lady Helena covered her face with both hands.
                     Her nephew looked at her, then back to Miss Catheron. The white face kept its
                     calm, the pitying eyes looked at him with a gentle compassion no words can
                     tell.</p>
                  <p>"Wait one moment," she said; "I must tell him you are here."</p>
                  <p>She hurried upstairs and disappeared. Neither of the two spoke. Lady Helena's
                     face was still hidden. He knew that she was crying—silent, miserable
                     tears—tears that were for <emph>him</emph>. He stood pale, composed,
                     expectant—waiting for the end.</p>
                  <p>"Come up," Miss Catheron's soft voice at the head of the stairs called. Once
                     more he gave his aunt his arm, once more in silence they went in together.</p>
                  <p>A breathless hush seemed to lie upon the house and all within it. Not a sound
                     was to be heard except the soft rustle of the trees, the soft, ceaseless patter
                     of the summer rain. In that silence they entered the chamber where the dying
                     man lay. To the hour of his own death, that moment and all he saw was
                     photographed indelibly upon Victor Catheron's mind. The dim gray light of the
                     room, the great white bed in the centre, and the awfully corpse-like face of
                     the man lying among the pillows, and gazing at him with hollow, spectral eyes.
                     His father—at last!</p>
                  <p>He advanced to the bedside as though under a spell. The spectral blue eyes were
                     fixed upon him steadfastly, the pallid lips slowly opened and spoke.</p>
                  <p>"Like me—as I was—like me. Ethel's son."</p>
                  <p>"My father!"</p>
                  <p>He was on his knees—a great awe upon him. It was the first time in his young
                     life he had ever been in the presence of death. And the dying was his father,
                     and his father whom he had never seen before.</p>
                  <p>"Like me," the faint lips repeated; "my face, my height, my name, my age. Like
                     me. O God! will his end be like mine?"</p>
                  <p>A thrill of horror ran through all his hearers. His son strove to take his
                     hand; it was withdrawn. A frown wrinkled the pallid brow.</p>
                  <p>"Wait," he said painfully; "don't touch me; don't speak to me. Wait. Sit down;
                     don't kneel there. You don't know what you are about to hear. Inez, tell him
                     now."</p>
                  <p>She closed the door—still with that changeless face—and locked it. It seemed as
                     though, having suffered so much, nothing had power to move her outwardly now.
                     She placed a chair for Lady Helena away from the bed—Lady Helena, who had stood
                     aloof and not spoken to the<pb n="286-287" xml:id="VAC6448-00000143"/> dying
                     man yet. She placed a chair for Sir Victor, and motioned him to seat himself,
                     then drew another close to the bedside, stooped, and kissed the dying man. Then
                     in a voice that never faltered, never failed, she began the story she had to
                     tell.</p>
                  <milestone n="* * * * * * *" unit="typography"/>
                  <p>Half an hour had passed. The story was told, and silence reigned in the
                     darkened room. Lady Helena still sat, with averted face, in her distant seat,
                     not moving, not looking up. The dying man still lay gazing weirdly upon his
                     son, death every second drawing nearer and more near. Inez sat holding his
                     hand, her pale, sad face, her dark, pitying eyes turned also upon his son.</p>
                  <p>That son had risen. He stood up in the centre of the room, with a white,
                     stunned face. What was this he had heard? Was he asleep and dreaming?—was it
                     all a horrible, ghastly delusion?—were they mocking him? or—O gracious God! was
                     it <emph>true?</emph>
                  </p>
                  <p>"Let me out!" They were his first words. "I can't breathe—I am choking in this
                     room! I shall go mad if you keep me here!"</p>
                  <p>He staggered forward, as a drunken man or a blind man might stagger, to the
                     door. He unlocked it, opened it, passed out into the passage, and down the
                     stairs. His aunt followed him, her eyes streaming, her hands outstretched.</p>
                  <p>"Victor—my boy—my son—my darling! Victor—for the love of Heaven, speak to
                     me!"</p>
                  <p>But he only made a gesture for her to stand back, and went on.</p>
                  <p>"Keep away from me!" he said, in a stifled voice; "let me think! Leave me
                     alone!—I can't speak to you yet!"</p>
                  <p>He went forward out into the wet daylight. His head was bare; his overcoat was
                     off; the rain beat unheeded upon him. What was this—what was this he had
                     heard?</p>
                  <p>He paced up and down under the trees. The moments passed. An hour went; he
                     neither knew nor cared. He was stunned—stunned body and soul—too stunned even
                     to think. His mind was in chaos, an awful horror had fallen upon him; he must
                     wait before thought would come. Whilst he still paced there, as a stricken
                     animal might, a great cry reached him. Then a woman's flying figure came down
                     the path. It was his aunt.</p>
                  <p>"Come—come—come!" she cried; "he is dying!"</p>
                  <p>She drew him with her by main force into the house—up the stairs—into the
                     chamber of death. But Death had been there before them. A dead man lay upon the
                     bed now, rigid and white. A second cry arose—a cry of almost more than woman's
                     woe. And with it Inez Catheron clasped the dead man in her arms, and covered
                     his face with her raining tears.</p>
                  <p>The son stood beside her like a figure of stone, gazing down at that marble
                     face. For the first time in his life he was Sir Victor Catheron.</p>

                  <head type="sub">HOW THE WEDDING-DAY BEGAN.</head>
                  <p>SIX days later, Sir Victor Catheron and his aunt came home. These six days had
                     passed very quietly, very pleasantly, to Edith. She was not in the least
                     lonely; the same sense of relief in her lover's absence was upon her as she had
                     felt at Torquay. It seemed to her she breathed freer when a few score miles lay
                     between them. She had her pet books and music, and she read and played a great
                     deal; she had her long, solitary rambles through the leafy lanes and quiet
                     roads, her long drives in the little pony phaeton her future husband had given
                     her. Sometimes Lady Gwendoline was her companion; oftener she was quite alone.
                     She was not at all unhappy now; she was just drifting passively on to the end.
                     She had chosen, and was quietly abiding by her choice; that was all. She caught
                     herself thinking, sometimes, that since she felt so much happier and freer in
                     Sir Victor's brief absences, how was she going to endure all the years that
                     must be passed at his side? No doubt she would grow used to him after a while,
                     as we grow used and reconciled to everything earthly.</p>
                  <p>One circumstance rather surprised her: during those six<pb n="288-289"
                        xml:id="VAC6448-00000144"/> days of absence she had received but one note
                     from her lover. She had counted at least upon the post fetching her one or two
                     per day, as when at Torquay, but this time he wrote her but once. An odd,
                     incoherent, hurried sort of note, too—very brief and unsatisfactory, if she had
                     had much curiosity on the subject of what was going on at St. John's Wood. But
                     she had not. Whether his father lived or died, so that he never interfered with
                     her claim to the title of Lady Catheron in the future, Miss Darrell cared very
                     little. This hurried note briefly told her his father had died on the day of
                     their arrival; that by his own <unclear>request</unclear> the burial place was
                     to be Kensal Green, not the <unclear>Cathedral vaults</unclear>; that the
                     secret of his life and death was still to <unclear>be kept</unclear> inviolate;
                     and that (in this part of the note he grew impassionedly earnest) their
                     marriage was not to be postponed. On the third of October, as all had been
                     arranged, it was still to take place. No other note followed. If Miss Darrell
                     had been in love with her future husband, this profound silence must have
                     wounded, surprised, grieved her. But she was not in love. He must be very much
                     occupied, she carelessly thought, since he could not find time to drop her a
                     daily bulletin—then dismissed the matter indifferently from her mind.</p>
                  <p>Late in the evening of the sixth day Sir Victor and Lady Helena returned
                     home.</p>
                  <p>Edith stood alone awaiting them, dressed in black silk, and with soft white
                     lace and ruby ornaments, and looking very handsome.</p>
                  <p>Her lover rushed in and caught her in his arms with a sort of rapturous,
                     breathless delight.</p>
                  <p>"My love! my life!" he cried, "every hour has been an age since I said
                     good-by!"</p>
                  <p>She drew herself from him. Sir Victor, in the calm, courteous character of a
                     perfectly undemonstrative suitor she tolerated. Sir Victor in the role of Romeo
                     was excessively distasteful to her. She drew herself out of his arms coldly and
                     decisively.</p>
                  <p>"I am glad to see you back, Sir Victor." But the stereotyped words of welcome
                     fell chill on his ear. "You are not looking well. I am afraid you have been
                     very much harassed since you left."</p>
                  <p>Surely he was not looking well. In those six days he had grown more than six
                     years older. He had lost flesh and color; there was an indescribable something
                     in his face and expression she had never seen before. More had happened than
                     the death of the father he had never known, to alter him like this. She looked
                     at him curiously. Would he tell her?</p>
                  <p>He did not. Not looking at her, with his eyes fixed moodily on the wood-fire
                     smoldering on the hearth, he repeated what his letter had already said. His
                     father had died the morning of their arrival in London; they had buried him
                     quietly and unobtrusively, by his own request, in Kensal Green Cemetery; no one
                     was to be told, and the wedding was not to be postponed. All this he said as a
                     man repeats a lesson learned by rote—his eyes never once meeting hers.</p>
                  <p>She stood silently by, looking at him, listening to him.</p>
                  <p>Something lay behind, then, that she was not to know. Well, it made them
                     quits—she didn't care for the Catheron family secrets; if it were something
                     unpleasant, as well <emph>not</emph> know. If Sir Victor told her, very well;
                     if not, very well also. She cared little either way.</p>
                  <p>"Miss Catheron remains at St. John's Wood, I suppose?" she inquired
                     indifferently, feeling in the pause that ensued she must say something.</p>
                  <p>"She remains—yes—with her two old servants for the present. I believe her
                     ultimate intention is to go abroad."</p>
                  <p>"She will not return to Cheshire?"</p>
                  <p>A spasm of pain crossed his face; there was a momentary contraction of the
                     muscles of his mouth.</p>
                  <p>"She will not return to Cheshire. All her life she will lie under the ban of
                     murder."</p>
                  <p>"And she is innocent?"</p>
                  <p>He looked up at her—a strange, hunted, tortured sort of look.</p>
                  <p>"She is innocent."</p>
                  <p>As he made the answer he turned abruptly away. Edith asked no more questions.
                     The secret of his mother's murder was a secret she was not to hear.</p>
                  <p>Lady Helena did not make her appearance at all in the lower rooms, that night.
                     Next day at luncheon she came down, and Edith was honestly shocked at the
                     change in her. From a hale, handsome, stately, upright, elderly lady, she<pb
                        n="290-291" xml:id="VAC6448-00000145"/> had become a feeble old woman in the
                     past week. Her step had grown uncertain; her hands trembled; deep lines of
                     trouble were scored on her pale face; her eyes rarely wandered long from her
                     nephew's face. Her voice took a softer, tenderer tone when she addressed
                     him—she had always loved him dearly, but never so dearly, it would seem, as
                     now.</p>
                  <p>The change in Sir Victor was more in manner than in look. A feverish impatience
                     and restlessness appeared to have taken possession of him; he wandered about
                     the house and in and out like some restless ghost. From Powyss Place to
                     Catheron Royals, from Catheron Royals to Powyss Place, he vibrated like a human
                     pendulum. It set Edith's nerves on edge only to watch him. At other periods a
                     moody gloom would fall upon him, then for hours he sat brooding, brooding, with
                     knitted brows and downcast eyes, lost in his own dark, secret thoughts. Anon
                     his spirits would rise to fever height, and he would laugh and talk in a wild,
                     excited way that fixed Edith's dark, wondering eyes solemnly on his flushed
                     face.</p>
                  <p>With it all, in whatever mood, he could not bear her out of his sight. He
                     haunted her like her shadow, until it grew almost intolerable. He sat for
                     hours, while she worked, or played, or read, not speaking, not stirring—his
                     eyes fixed upon her, and she, who had never been nervous, grew horribly nervous
                     under this ordeal. Was Sir Victor losing his wits? Now that his insane father
                     was dead and buried, did he feel it incumbent upon him to keep up the family
                     reputation and follow in that father's footsteps?</p>
                  <p>And the days wore on, and the first of October came.</p>
                  <p>The change in the young baronet grew more marked with each day. He lost the
                     power to eat or sleep; far into the night he walked his room, as though some
                     horrible Nemesis were pursuing him. He failed to the very shadow of himself,
                     yet when Lady Helena, in fear and trembling, laid her hand upon his arm, and
                     falteringly begged him to see a physician, he shook her off with an angry
                     irritability quite foreign to his usual gentle temper, and bade her,
                     imperiously, to leave him alone.</p>
                  <p>The second of October came; to-morrow would be the wedding-day.</p>
                  <p>The old feeling of vagueness and unreality had come back to Edith. Something
                     would happen—that was the burden of her thoughts. To-morrow was the
                     wedding-day, but the wedding would never take place. She walked through the
                     glowing, beautiful rooms of Catheron Royals, through the grounds and gardens,
                     bright with gay autumnal flowers—a home luxurious enough for a young
                     duchess—and still that feeling of unreality was there. A grand place, a noble
                     home, but she would never reign its mistress. The cottage at Carnarvon had been
                     weeks ago engaged, Sir Victor's confidential servant already established there,
                     awaiting the coming of the bridal pair; but she felt she would never see it.
                     Upstairs, in all their snowy, shining splendor, the bridal robe and veil lay;
                     when to-morrow came would she ever put them on, she vaguely wondered. And still
                     she was not unhappy. A sort of apathy had taken possession of her; she drifted
                     on calmly to the end. What was written, was written; what would be, would be.
                     Time enough to wake from her dream when the time of waking came.</p>
                  <p>The hour fixed for the ceremony was eleven o'clock; the place, Chesholm church.
                     The bridemaids would arrive at ten—the Earl of Wroatmore, the father of the
                     Ladies Gwendoline and Laura Drexel, was to give the bride away. They would
                     return to Powyss Place and eat the sumptuous breakfast—then off and away to the
                     pretty town in North Wales. That was the programme. "When to-morrow comes,"
                     Edith thinks, as she wanders about the house, "will it be carried out?"</p>
                  <p>It chanced that on the bridal eve Miss Darrell was attacked with headache and
                     sore throat. She had lingered heedlessly out in the rain the day before (one of
                     her old bad habits to escape from Sir Victor, if the truth must be told), and
                     paid the natural penalty next day. It would never do to be hoarse as a raven on
                     one's wedding-day, so Lady Helena insisted on a wet napkin round the throat, a
                     warm bath, gruel, and early bed. Willingly enough the girl obeyed—too glad to
                     have this last evening alone. Immediately after dinner she bade her adieux to
                     her bridegroom-elect, and went away to her own rooms.</p>
                  <p>The short October day had long ago darkened down, the curtains were drawn, a
                     fire burned, the candles were lit.<pb n="292-293" xml:id="VAC6448-00000146"/>
                     She took the bath, the gruel, the wet napkin, and let herself be tucked up in
                     bed.</p>
                  <p>"Romantic," she thought, with a laugh at herself, "for a bride."</p>
                  <p>Lady Helena—was it a presentiment of what was so near?—lingered by her side
                     long that evening, and, at parting, for the first time took her in her arms and
                     kissed her.</p>
                  <p>"Good night, my child," the tender, tremulous tones said. "I pray you make him
                     happy—I pray that he may make <emph>you</emph>."</p>
                  <p>She lingered yet a little longer—her heart seemed full, her eyes were shining
                     through tears. Words seemed trembling on her lips—words she had not courage to
                     say. For Edith, surprised and moved, she put her arms round the kind old neck,
                     and laid her face for a moment on the genial old bosom.</p>
                  <p>"I will try," she whispered, "dear, kind Lady Helena—indeed I will try to be a
                     good and faithful wife."</p>
                  <p>One last kiss, then they parted; the door closed behind her, and Edith was
                     alone.</p>
                  <p>She lay as usual, high up among the billowy pillows, her hands clasped above
                     her head, her dark, dreaming eyes fixed on the fire. She looked as though she
                     were thinking, but she was not. Her mind was simply a blank. She was vaguely
                     and idly watching the flickering shadows cast by the firelight on the wall, the
                     gleam of yellow moonlight shimmering through the curtains; listening to the
                     faint sighing of the night wind, the ticking of the little fanciful clock, to
                     the pretty plaintive tunes it played before it struck the hours. Nine, ten,
                     eleven—she heard them all, as she lay there, broad awake, neither thinking nor
                     stirring.</p>
                  <p>Her maid came in for her last orders; she bade the girl good-night, and told
                     her to go to bed—she wanted nothing more. Then again she was alone. But now a
                     restlessness, as little to be understood as her former listless apathy, took
                     hold of her. She could not lie there and sleep; she could not lie there awake.
                     As the clock chimed twelve, she started up in bed in a sudden panic. Twelve! A
                     new day—her wedding-day!</p>
                  <p>Impossible to lie there quiet any longer. She sprang up, locked her door, and
                     began, in her long, white night-robe, pacing up and down. So another hour
                     passed. One! One from the little Swiss musical clock; one, solemn and sombre,
                     from the big clock up in the tower. Then she stopped—stopped in thought; then
                     she walked to one of her boxes, and took out a writing-case, always kept
                     locked. With a key attached to her neck she opened it, seated herself before a
                     table, and drew forth a package of letters and a picture. The picture was the
                     handsome photographed face of Charley Stuart, the letters the letters he had
                     written her to Sandypoint.</p>
                  <p>She began with the first, and read it slowly through—then the next, and so on
                     to the end. There were over a dozen in all, and tolerably lengthy. As she
                     finished and folded up the last, she took up the picture and gazed at it long
                     and earnestly, with a strangely dark, intent look. How handsome he was! how
                     well he photographed! that was her thought. She had seen him so often, with
                     just this expression, looking at her. His pleasant, lazy, half-sarcastic voice
                     was in her ear, saying something coolly impertinent—his gray, half-smiling,
                     half-cynical eyes were looking life-like up at her. What was he doing now?
                     Sleeping calmly, no doubt—she forgotten as she deserved to be. When tomorrow
                     came, would he by any chance remember it was her wedding day, and would the
                     remembrance cost him a pang? She laughed at herself for the sentimental
                     question—Charley Stuart feel a pang for her, or any other earthly woman? No, he
                     was immersed in business, no doubt, head and ears, soul and body; absorbed in
                     dollars and cents, and retrieving in some way his fallen fortunes—Edith Darrell
                     dismissed contemptuously, as a cold-blooded jilt, from his memory. Well, so she
                     had willed it—she had no right to complain. With a steady hand she tied up the
                     letters and replaced them in the desk. The picture followed. "Good-by,
                     Charley," she said, with a sort of smile. She could no more have destroyed
                     those souvenirs of the past than she could have cut off her right hand. Wrong,
                     you say, and shake your head. Wrong, of course; but when has Edith Darrell done
                     right—when have I pictured her to you in any very favorable light? As long as
                     she lived, and was Sir Victor's wife, she would never look at them again, but
                     destroy them—no, she could not do that.</p>

                  <p>Six! As she closed and locked the writing-case the hour struck; a broad, bright
                     sunburst flashed in and filled the room with yellow glory. The sun had risen
                     cloudless and brilliant at last on her wedding-day.</p>

                  <p>SHE replaced the desk in the trunk, and, walking to the window, drew back the
                     curtain and looked out. Over emerald lawn and coppice, tall trees and brilliant
                     flowers, the October sun shone gloriously. No fairer day ever smiled upon old
                     earth. She stood for an instant—then turned slowly away and walked over to a
                     mirror—had her night's vigil made her look wan and sallow? she wondered. No—she
                     looked much as usual—a thought paler, perhaps, but it is appropriate for brides
                     to look pale. No use thinking of a morning nap under the circumstances—she
                     would sit down by the window and wait for them to come. She could hear the
                     household astir already—she could even see Sir Victor, away in the distance,
                     taking his morning walk. How singularly haggard and wan he looked, like
                     anything you please except a happy bridegroom about to marry the lady he loves
                     above all on earth. She watched him with a gravely thoughtful face, until at
                     last he disappeared from view among the trees.</p>
                  <p>Seven o'clock! Eight o'clock! Edith's respite was ended, her solitude invaded
                     at last. There was a tap at the door, and Lady Helena, followed by Miss
                     Darrell's maid, entered.</p>
                  <p>Had they all kept vigil? Her ladyship, in the pitiless, searching glare of the
                     morning sun, certainly looked much more like it than the quiet bride. She was
                     pale, nervous, agitated beyond anything the girl had ever seen.</p>
                  <p>"How had Edith slept? How was her cold? How did she feel?"</p>
                  <p>"Never better," Miss Darrell responded smilingly. "The sore throat and headache
                     are quite gone, and I am ready to do justice to the nice breakfast which I see
                     Emily has brought."</p>
                  <p>She sat down to it—chocolate, rolls, an omelette, and a savory little bird,
                     with excellent and unromantic appetite. Then the service was cleared away, and
                     the real business of the day began. She was under the hands of her maid, deep
                     in the mysteries of the wedding-toilette.</p>
                  <p>At ten came the bridemaids, a brilliant bevy, in sweeping trains, walking
                     visions of silk, tulle, laces, perfume, and flowers. At half-past ten Miss
                     Darrell, "queen rose of the rose-bud garden of girls," stood in their midst,
                     ready for the altar.</p>
                  <p>She looked beautiful. It is an understood thing that all brides, whatever their
                     appearance on the ordinary occasions of life, look beautiful on this day of
                     days. Edith Darrell had never looked so stately, so queenly, so handsome in her
                     life. Just a thought pale, but not unbecomingly so—the rich, glistening white
                     silk sweeping far behind her, set off well the fine figure, which it fitted
                     without flaw. The dark, proud face shone like a star from the misty folds of
                     the bridal veil; the legendary orange blossoms crowned the rich, dark hair; on
                     neck, ears, and arms glimmered a priceless parure of pearls, the gift, like the
                     dress and veil, of Lady Helena. A fragrant bouquet of spotless white had been
                     sent up by the bridegroom. At a quarter of eleven she entered the carriage and
                     was driven away to the church.</p>
                  <p>As she lay back, and looked dreamily out, the mellow October sunshine lighting
                     the scene, the joy-bells clashing, the listless apathy of the past few days
                     took her again. She took note of the trifles about her—her mind rejected all
                     else. How yellow were the fields of stubble, how picturesque, gilded in the
                     sunshine, the village of Chesholm looked. How glowing and rosy the faces of the
                     people who flocked out in their holiday best to gaze at the bridal pageant. Was
                     it health and happiness, or soap and water only? wondered the bride. These were
                     her wandering thoughts—these alone.</p>
                  <p>They reached the little church. All the way from the carriage to the stone
                     porch the charity children strewed her path with flowers, and sang (out of
                     tune) a bridal anthem. She smiled down upon their vulgar, admiring little faces
                        as<pb n="296-297" xml:id="VAC6448-00000148"/> she went by on the Earl of
                     Wroatmore's arm. The church was filled. Was seeing her married worth all this
                     trouble to these good people, she wondered, as she walked up the aisle, still
                     on the arm of the Right Honorable the Earl of Wroatmore.</p>
                  <p>There was, of course, a large throng of invited guests. Lady Helena was there
                     in pale, flowing silks, the bridemaids, a billowy crowd of white-plumaged
                     birds, and the bridegroom, with a face whiter than the white waistcoat,
                     standing waiting for his bride. And there, in surplice, book in hand, stood the
                     rector of Chesholm and his curate, ready to tie the untieable knot.</p>
                  <p>A low, hushed murmur ran through the church at sight of the silver-shining
                     figure of the bride. How handsome, how stately, how perfectly self-possessed
                     and calm. Truly, if beauty and high-bred repose of manner be any palliation of
                     low birth and obscurity, this American young lady had it.</p>
                  <p>An instant passes—she is kneeling by Sir Victor Catheron's side. "Who giveth
                     this woman to be married to this man?" say the urbane tones of the rector of
                     Chesholm, and the Right Honorable the Earl of Wroatmore comes forward on two
                     rickety old legs and gives her. "If any one here present knows any just cause
                     or impediment why this man should not be married to this woman, I charge him,"
                     etc., but no one knows. The solemn words go on. "Wilt thou take Edith Darrell
                     to be thy wedded wife?" "I will," Sir Victor Catheron responds, but in broken,
                     inarticulate tones. It is the bride's turn. "I will!" the clear, firm voice is
                     perfectly audible in the almost painfully intense stillness. The ring slips
                     over her finger; she watches it curiously. "I pronounce ye man and wife," says
                     the rector. "What God hath joined together, let no man put asunder."</p>
                  <p>It is all over; she is Lady Catheron, and nothing has happened.</p>
                  <p>They enter the vestry, they sign their names in the register, their friends
                     flock round to shake hands, and kiss, and congratulate. And Edith smiles
                     through it all, and Sir Victor keeps that white, haggard, unsmiling face. It is
                     a curious fancy, but, if it were not so utterly absurd, Edith would think he
                     looked at her as though he were afraid of her.</p>
                  <p>On her husband's arm—her husband's!—she walks down the aisle and out of the
                     church. They enter the carriages, and are driven back to Powyss Place. They sit
                     down to breakfast—every face looks happy and bright, except the face that
                     should look happiest and brightest of all—the bridegroom's. He seems to make a
                     great effort to be cheerful and at ease; it is a failure. He tries to return
                     thanks in a speech; it is a greater failure still. An awkward silence and
                     constraint creep over the party. What is the matter with Sir Victor? All eyes
                     are fixed curiously upon him. Surely not repenting his mesalliance so speedily.
                     It is a relief to everybody when the breakfast ends, and the bride goes
                     upstairs to change her dress.</p>
                  <p>The young baronet has engaged a special train to take them into Wales. The
                     new-made Lady Catheron changes her shining bridal robes for a charming
                     travelling costume of palest gray, with a gossamer veil of the same shade. She
                     looks as handsome in it as in the other, and her cool calm is a marvel to all
                     beholders. She shakes hands gayly with their friends and guests; a smile is on
                     her face as she takes her bridegroom's arm and enters the waiting carriage. Old
                     shoes in a shower are flung after them; ladies wave their handkerchiefs,
                     gentlemen call good-by. She leans forward and waves her gray-gloved hand in
                     return—the cloudless smile on the beautiful face to the last. So they see
                     her—as not one of all who stand there will ever see her on earth again.</p>
                  <p>The house, the wedding-guests are out of sight—the carriage rolls through the
                     gates of Powyss Place. She falls back and looks out. They are flying along
                     Chesholm high street; the tenantry shout lustily; the joy-bells still clash
                     forth. Now they are at the station—ten minutes more, and, as fast as steam can
                     convey them, they are whirling into Wales. And all this time bride and
                     bridegroom have not exchanged a word!</p>
                  <p>That curious fancy of Edith's has come back—surely Sir Victor is
                        <emph>afraid</emph> of her. How strangely he looks—how strangely he keeps
                     aloof—how strangely he is silent—how fixedly he gazes out of the railway
                     carriage window—anywhere but at her! <emph>Has</emph> his brain turned? she
                     wonders; <emph>is</emph> Sir Victor going mad?</p>
                  <p>She makes no attempt to arouse him; let him be silent<pb n="298-299"
                        xml:id="VAC6448-00000149"/> if he will; she rather prefers it, indeed. She
                     sits and looks sociably out of the opposite window at the bright, flying
                     landscape, steeped in the amber glitter of the October afternoon sun.</p>
                  <p>She looks across at the man she has married—did ever mortal man before on his
                     wedding-day wear such a stony face as that? And yet he has married her for
                     love—for love alone. Was ever another bridal journey performed like this—in
                     profound gravity and silence on both sides? she wonders, half-inclined to
                     laugh. She looks down at her shining wedding-ring—is it a circlet that means
                     nothing? How is her life to go on after this grewsome wedding-day?</p>
                  <p>They reach Wales. The sun is setting redly over mountains and sea. The carriage
                     is awaiting them; she enters, and lies back wearily with closed eyes. She is
                     dead tired and depressed; she is beginning to feel the want of last night's
                     sleep, and in a weary way is glad when the Carnarvon cottage is reached. Sir
                     Victor's man, my lady's maid, and two Welch servants came forth to meet them;
                     and on Sir Victor's arm she enters the house.</p>
                  <p>She goes at once to her dressing-room, to rest, to bathe her face, and remove
                     her wraps, performing those duties herself, and dismissing her maid. As she and
                     Sir Victor separate, he mutters some half-incoherent words—he will take a walk
                     and smoke a cigar before dinner, while she is resting. He is gone even while he
                     says it, and she is alone.</p>
                  <p>She removes her gloves, hat, and jacket, bathes her face, and descends to the
                     little cottage drawing-room. It is quite deserted—sleepy silence everywhere
                     reigns. She throws herself into an easy-chair beside the open window, and looks
                     listlessly out. Ruby, and purple, and golden, the sun is setting in a radiant
                     sky—the yellow sea creeps up on silver sands—old Carnarvon Castle gleams and
                     glows in the rainbow light like a fairy palace. It is unutterably beautiful,
                     unutterably drowsy and dull. And, while she thinks it, her heavy eyelids sway
                     and fall, her head sinks back, and Edith falls fast asleep.</p>
                  <p>Fast asleep; and a mile away, Sir Victor Catheron paces up and down a strip of
                     tawny sand, the sea lapping softly at his feet, the birds singing in the
                     branches, not a human soul far or near. He is not smoking that before-dinner
                     cigar—he is striding up and down more like an escaped Bedlamite than anything
                     else. His hat is drawn over his eyes, his brows are knit, his lips set tight,
                     his hands are clenched. Presently he pauses, leans against a tree, and looks,
                     with eyes full of some haggard, horrible despair, out over the red light on sea
                     and sky. And, as he looks, he falls down suddenly, as though some inspiration
                     had seized him, upon his knees, and lifts his clasped hands to that radiant
                     sky. A prayer, that seems frenzied in its agonized intensity, bursts from his
                     lips—the sleeping sea, the twittering birds, the rustling leaves, and He who
                     has made them, alone are to hear. Then he falls forward on his face, and lies
                     like a stone.</p>
                  <p>Is he mad? Surely no sane man ever acted, or looked, or spoke like this. He
                     lies so—prostrate, motionless—for upward of an hour, then slowly and heavily he
                     rises. His face is calmer now; it is the face of a man who has fought some
                     desperate fight, and gained some desperate victory—one of those victories more
                     cruel than death.</p>
                  <p>He turns and goes hence. He crashes through the tall, dewy grass, his white
                     face set in a look of iron resolution. He is ghastly beyond all telling; dead
                     and in his coffin he will hardly look more death-like. He reaches the cottage,
                     and the first sight upon which his eyes rest is his bride, peacefully asleep in
                     the chair by the still open window. She looks lovely in her slumber, and
                     peaceful as a little child—no very terrible sight surely. But as his eyes fall
                     upon her, he recoils in some great horror, as a man may who has received a
                     blinding blow.</p>
                  <p>"Asleep!" his pale lips whisper; "asleep—as <emph>she</emph> was!"</p>
                  <p>He stands spell-bound for a moment—then he breaks away headlong. He makes his
                     way to the dining-room. The table, all bright with damask, silver, crystal, and
                     cut flowers, stands spread for dinner. He takes from his pocket a note-book and
                     pencil, and, still standing, writes rapidly down one page. Without reading, he
                     folds and seals the sheet, and slowly and with dragging steps returns to the
                     room where Edith sleeps. On the threshold he lingers—he seems
                        afraid—<emph>afraid</emph> to approach. But he does approach at last. He
                     places the note he has written on a<pb n="300-301" xml:id="VAC6448-00000150"/>
                     table, he draws near his sleeping bride, he kneels down and kisses her hands,
                     her dress, her hair. His haggard eyes burn on her face, their mesmeric light
                     disturbs her. She murmurs and moves restlessly in her sleep. In an instant he
                     is on his feet; in another, he is out of the room and the house; in another,
                     the deepening twilight takes him, and he is gone.</p>
                  <p>A train an hour later passes through Carnarvon on its way to London. One
                     passenger alone awaits it at the station—one passenger who enters an empty
                     first-class compartment and disappears. Then it goes shrieking on its way,
                     bearing with it to London the bridegroom, Sir Victor Catheron.</p>

                  <p>THE last red ray of the sunset had faded, the silver stars were out, the yellow
                     moon shone serenely over land and sea, before Edith awoke—awoke with a smile on
                     her lips from a dream of Charley.</p>
                  <p>"Do go away—don't tease," she was murmuring half smilingly, half petulantly—the
                     words she had spoken to him a hundred times. She was back in Sandypoint, he
                     beside her, living over the old days, gone forever. She awoke to see the tawny
                     moonshine streaming in, to hear the soft whispers of the night wind, the soft,
                     sleepy lap of the sea on the sands, and to realize, with a thrill and a shock,
                     she was Sir Victor Catheron's wife.</p>
                  <p>His wife! This was her wedding-day. Even in dreams Charley must come to her no
                     more.</p>
                  <p>She rose up, slightly chilled from sleeping in the evening air, and shivering,
                     partly with that chill, partly with a feeling she did not care to define. The
                     dream of her life's ambition was realized in its fullest; she, Edith Darrell,
                     was "my lady—a baronet's bride;" the vista of her life spread before her in
                     glittering splendor; and yet her heart lay like lead in her bosom. In this hour
                     she was afraid of herself, afraid of him.</p>
                  <p>But where was he?</p>
                  <p>She looked round the room, half in shadow, half in brilliant moonlight. No, he
                     was not there. Had he returned from his stroll? She took out her watch. A
                     quarter of seven—of course he had. He was awaiting her, no doubt, impatient for
                     his dinner, in the dining-room. She would make some change in her dress and
                     join him there. She went up to her dressing room and lit the candles herself.
                     She smoothed her ruffled hair, added a ribbon and a jewel or two, and then went
                     back to the drawing-room. All unnoticed, in the shadows, the letter for her lay
                     on the table. She sat down and rang the bell. Jamison, the confidential
                     servant, appeared.</p>
                  <p>"Has Sir Victor returned from his walk, Jamison? Is he in the dining-room?"</p>
                  <p>Mr. Jamison's well-bred eyes looked in astonishment at the speaker, then around
                     the room. Mr. Jamison's wooden countenance looked stolid surprise.</p>
                  <p>"Sir Victor, my lady—I—thought Sir Victor was <emph>here</emph>, my lady."</p>
                  <p>"Sir Victor has not been here since half an hour after our arrival. He went out
                     for a walk, as you very well know. I ask you if he has returned."</p>
                  <p>"Sir Victor returned more than an hour ago, my lady. I saw him myself. You were
                     asleep, my lady, by the window as he came up. He went into the dining-room and
                     wrote a letter; I saw it in his hand. And then, my lady, he came in here."</p>
                  <p>The man paused, and again peered around the room. Edith listened in growing
                     surprise.</p>
                  <p>"I thought he was here still, my lady, so did Hemily, or we would have taken
                     the liberty of hentering and closing the window. We was sure he was here. He
                     suttingly hentered with the letter in his 'and. It's <emph>very</emph>
                     hodd."</p>
                  <p>Again there was a pause. Again Mr Jamison—</p>
                  <p>"If your ladyship will hallow, I will light the candles here, and then go and
                     hascertain whether Sir Victor is in hany of the hother rooms."</p>
                  <p>She made an affirmative gesture, and returned to the<pb n="302-303"
                        xml:id="VAC6448-00000151"/> window. The man lit the candles; a second after
                     an exclamation startled her.</p>
                  <p>"The note, my lady! Here it is."</p>
                  <p>It lay upon the table; she walked over and took it up. In Sir Victor's hand,
                     and addressed to herself! What did this mean? She stood looking at it a
                     moment—then she turned to Jamison.</p>
                  <p>"That will do," she said briefly; "if I want you I will ring."</p>
                  <p>The man bowed and left the room. She stood still, holding the unopened note,
                     strangely reluctant to break the seal. What did Sir Victor mean by absenting
                     himself and writing her a note? With an effort she aroused herself at last, and
                     tore it open. It was strangely scrawled, the writing half illegible; slowly and
                     with difficulty she made it out. This was what she read:</p>

                                 never loved you half so well as now, when I leave you forever. If I
                                 loved you less I might dare to stay. But I dare not. I can tell you
                                 no more—a promise to the living and the dead binds me. A dreadful
                                 secret of sin, and shame, and guilt, is involved. Go to Lady

                  <p>No more. So, in short, incoherent, disconnected sentences, this
                     incomprehensible letter began and ended. She stood stunned, bewildered, dazed,
                     holding it, gazing at it blankly. Was she asleep? Was this a dream? Was Sir
                     Victor playing some ghastly kind of practical joke, or—had Sir Victor all of a
                     sudden gone wholly and entirely mad?</p>
                  <p>She shrank from the last thought—but the dim possibility that it might be true
                     calmed her. She sat down, hardly knowing what she was doing, and read the
                     letter again. Yes, surely, surely she was right. Sir Victor had gone mad!
                     Madness was hereditary in his family—had it come to him on his wedding-day of
                     all days? On his wedding-day the last <choice>

                        <corr>remnant</corr>
                     </choice> of reason had deserted him, and he had deserted <emph>her</emph>. She
                     sat quite still,—the light of the candles falling upon her, upon the fatal
                     letter,—trying to steady herself, trying to think. She read it again and again;
                     surely no sane man ever wrote such a letter as this. "A dreadful secret of sin,
                     and shame, and guilt, is involved." Did that dreadful secret mean the secret of
                     his mother's death? But why should that cause him to leave her? She knew all
                     about it already. What frightful revelation had been made to him on his
                     father's dying bed? He had never been the same man since. An idea flashed
                     across her brain—dreadful and unnatural enough in all conscience—but why should
                     even <emph>that</emph>, supposing her suspicions to be true, cause him to leave
                     her? "If I loved you less, I might dare to stay with you." What rhodomontade
                     was this? Men prove their love by living with the women they marry, not by
                     deserting them. Oh, he was mad, mad, mad—not a doubt of that could remain.</p>
                  <p>Her thoughts went back over the past two weeks—to the change in him ever since
                     his father's death. There had been times when he had visibly shrunk from her,
                     when he had seemed absolutely afraid of her. She had doubted it then—she knew
                     it now. It was the dawning of his insanity—the family taint breaking forth. His
                     father's delusion had been to shut himself up, to give out that he was dead—the
                     son's was to desert his bride on their bridal day forever. Forever! the letter
                     said so. Again, and still again, she read it. Very strangely she looked, the
                     waxlights flickering on her pale, rigid young face, her compressed lips set in
                     one tight line—on her soft pearl gray silk, with its point lace collar and
                     diamond star. A bride, alone, forsaken, on her wedding-day!</p>
                  <p>How strange it all was! The thought came to her: was it retributive justice
                     pursuing her for having bartered herself for rank? And yet girls as good and
                     better than she, did it every day. She rose and began pacing up and down the
                     floor. What should she do? "Go back to Lady Helena," said the letter. Go back!
                     cast off, deserted—she, who only at noon to-day had left them a radiant bride!
                     As she<pb n="304-305" xml:id="VAC6448-00000152"/> thought it, a feeling of
                     absolute hatred for the man she had married came into her heart. Sane or mad
                     she would hate him now, all the rest of her life.</p>
                  <p>The hours were creeping on—two had passed since she had sent Jamison out of her
                     room. What were they thinking of her, these keen-sighted, gossiping servants?
                     what would they think and say when she told them Sir Victor would return no
                     more?—that she was going back to Cheshire alone to-morrow morning? There was no
                     help for it. There was resolute blood in the girl's veins; she walked over to
                     the bell, rang it, her head erect, her eyes bright, only her lips still set in
                     that tight, unpleasant line.</p>
                  <p>Mr. Jamison, grave and respectful, his burning curiosity diplomatically hidden,
                     answered.</p>
                  <p>"Jamison," the young lady said, her tones clear and calm, looking the man
                     straight in the eyes, "your master has been obliged to leave Wales suddenly,
                     and will not return. You may spend the night in packing up. To-morrow, by the
                     earliest train, I return to Cheshire."</p>
                  <p>"Yes, me lady."</p>
                  <p>Not a muscle of Jamison's face moved—not a vestige of surprise or any other
                     earthly emotion was visible in his smooth-shaven face. If she had said,
                     "To-morrow by the earliest train I shall take a trip to the moon," Mr. Jamison
                     would have bowed and said, "Yes, me lady," in precisely the same tone.</p>
                  <p>"Is dinner served?" his young mistress asked, looking at her watch. "If not,
                     serve immediately. I shall be there in two minutes."</p>
                  <p>She kept her word. With that light in her eyes, that pale composure on her
                     face, she swept into the dining-room, and took her place at the glittering
                     table. Jamison waited upon her—watching her, of course, as a cat a mouse.</p>
                  <p>"She took her soup and fish, her slice of pheasant and her jelly, I do assure
                     you, just the same as hever, Hemily," he related afterward to the lady's maid;
                     "but her face was whiter than the tablecloth, and her eyes had a look in them
                     I'd rather master would face than me. She's one of the 'igh-stepping sort,
                     depend upon it, and quiet as she takes it now, there'll be the deuce and all to
                     pay one of these days."</p>
                  <p>She rose at last and went back to the drawing-room. How brilliantly the moon
                     shone on the sleeping sea; how fantastic the town and castle looked in the
                     romantic light. She stood by the window long, looking out. No thought of
                     sympathy for him—of trying to find him out on the morrow—entered her mind. He
                     had deserted her; sane or mad, that was enough for the present to know.</p>
                  <p>She took out a purse, that fairies and gold dollars alone might have entered,
                     and looked at its contents. By sheer good luck and chance, it contained three
                     or four sovereigns—more than sufficient for the return journey. To-morrow
                     morning she would go back to Powyss Place and tell Lady Helena; after that—</p>
                  <p>Her thoughts broke—to-night she could not look beyond. The misery, the shame,
                     the horrible scandal, the loneliness, the whole wreck of life that was to come,
                     she could not feel as yet. She knew what she would do to-morrow—after that all
                     was a blank.</p>
                  <p>What a lovely night it was! What were they doing at home? What was Trixy about
                     just now? What was—Charley? She had made up her mind never to think of Charley
                     more. His face rose vividly before her now in the moonrays, pale, stern,
                     contemptuous. "Oh!" she passionately thought, "how he must scorn, how he must
                     despise me!" "Whatever comes," he had said to her that rainy morning at
                     Sandypoint; "whatever the new life brings, you are never to blame
                        <emph>me!</emph>" How long ago that rainy morning seemed now. What an
                     eternity since that other night in the snow. If she had only died beside him
                     that night—the clear, white, painless death—unspotted from the world! If she
                     had only died that night!</p>
                  <p>Her arms were on the window-sill—her face fell upon them. One hour, two, three
                     passed; she never moved. She was not crying, she was suffering, but dully, with
                     a numb, torpid, miserable sense of pain. All her life since that rainy spring
                     day, when Charley Stuart had come to Sandypoint with his mother's letter,
                     returned to her. She had striven and coquetted to bring about the result she
                     wanted—it had seemed such a dazzling thing to be a baronet's wife, with an
                     income that would flow in to her like a ceaseless golden river. She had jilted
                     the man she loved in cold blood, and accepted the man to whom her heart was<pb
                        n="306-307" xml:id="VAC6448-00000153"/> as stone. In the hour when fortune
                     was deserting her best friends, she had deserted them too. And the end
                        was—<emph>this</emph>.</p>
                  <p>It was close upon twelve when Emily, the maid, sleepy and cross, tapped at the
                     door. She had to tap many times before her mistress heard her. When she did
                     hear and open, and the girl came in, she recoiled from the ghastly pallor of
                     her lady's face.</p>
                  <p>"I shall not want you to-night," Edith said briefly. "You may go to bed."</p>
                  <p>"But you are ill, my lady. If you only saw yourself! Can't I fetch you
                     something? A glass of wine from the dining-room?"</p>
                  <p>"Nothing, Emily, thank you. I have sat up too long in the night air—that is
                     all. Go to bed; I shall do very well."</p>
                  <p>The girl went, full of pity and wonder, shaking her head. "Only this morning I
                     thought what a fine thing it was to be the bride of so fine a gentleman, and
                     look at her now."</p>
                  <p>Left alone, she closed and fastened the window herself. An unsupportable sense
                     of pain and weariness oppressed her. She did not undress. She loosened her
                     clothes, wrapped a heavy, soft railway rug about her, and lay down upon the
                     bed. In five minutes the tired eyes had closed. There is no surer narcotic than
                     trouble sometimes; hers was forgotten—deeply, dreamlessly, she slept until
                     morning.</p>
                  <p>The sun was high in the sky when she awoke. She raised herself upon her elbow
                     and looked around, bewildered. In a second yesterday flashed upon her, and her
                     journey of today. She arose, made her morning toilet, and rang for her maid.
                     Breakfast was waiting—it was past nine o'clock, and she could leave Carnarvon
                     in three quarters of an hour. She made an effort to eat and drink; but it was
                     little better than an effort. She gave Jamison his parting instructions—he was
                     to remain here until to-morrow; by that time orders would come from Powyss
                     Place. Then, in the dress she had travelled in yesterday, she entered the
                     railway carriage and started upon her return journey.</p>
                  <p>How speedily her honeymoon had ended! A curious sort of smile passed over her
                     face as she thought it. She had not anticipated Elysium—quite—but she certainly
                     had anticipated something very different from this.</p>
                  <p>She kept back thought resolutely—she would <emph>not</emph> think— she sat and
                     looked at the genial October landscape flitting by. Sooner or later the
                     floodgates would open, but not yet.</p>
                  <p>It was about three in the afternoon when the fly from the railway drove up to
                     the stately portico entrance of Powyss Place. She paid and dismissed the man,
                     and knocked unthinkingly. The servant who opened the door fell back, staring at
                     her, as though she had been a ghost.</p>
                  <p>"Is Lady Helena at home?"</p>
                  <p>Lady Helena was at home—and still the man stared blankly as he made the reply.
                     She swept past him, and made her way, unannounced, to her ladyship's private
                     rooms. She tapped at the door.</p>
                  <p>"Come in," said the familiar voice, and she obeyed. Then a startled cry rang
                     out. Lady Helena arose and stood spellbound, gazing in mute consternation at
                     the pale girl before her.</p>
                  <p>"Edith!" she could but just gasp. "What is this? Where is Victor?"</p>
                  <p>Edith came in, closed the door, and quietly faced her ladyship.</p>
                  <p>"I have not the faintest idea where Sir Victor Catheron may be at this present
                     moment. Wherever he is, it is to be hoped he is able to take care of himself. I
                     know I have not seen him since four o'clock yesterday afternoon."</p>
                  <p>The lips of Lady Helena moved, but no sound came from them. Some great and
                     nameless terror seemed to have fallen upon her.</p>
                  <p>"It was rather an unusual thing to do," the clear, steady tones of the bride
                     went on, "but being very tired after the journey, I fell asleep in the cottage
                     parlor at Carnarvon, half an hour after our arrival. Sir Victor had left me to
                     take a walk and a smoke, he said. It was nearly seven when I awoke. I was still
                     alone. Your nephew had come and gone."</p>
                  <p>"Gone!"</p>
                  <p>"Gone—and left this for me. Read it, Lady Helena, and you will see that in
                     returning here, I am only obeying my lord and master's command."</p>
                  <p>She took the note from her pocket, and presented it. Her ladyship took it, read
                     it, her face growing a dreadful ashen gray.</p>
                  <pb n="308-309" xml:id="VAC6448-00000154"/>
                  <p>"So soon!" she said, in a sort of whisper; "that it should have fallen upon him
                     so soon! Oh! I feared it! I feared it! I feared it!"</p>
                  <p>"You feared it!" Edith repeated, watching her intently. "Does that mean your
                     ladyship understands this letter?"</p>
                  <p>"Heaven help me! I am afraid I do."</p>
                  <p>"It means, then, what I have thought it meant: that when I married Sir Victor
                     yesterday I married a madman!"</p>
                  <p>There was a sort of moan from Lady Helena—no other reply.</p>
                  <p>"Insanity is in the Catheron blood—I knew that from the first. His father lived
                     and died a maniac. The father's fate is the son's. It has lain dormant for
                     three-and-twenty years, to break out on his wedding-day. Lady Helena, am I
                     right?"</p>
                  <p>But Lady Helena was sobbing convulsively now. Her sobs were her only reply.</p>
                  <p>"It is hard on <emph>you</emph>," Edith said, with a dreary sort of pity. "You
                     loved him."</p>
                  <p>"And you did not," the elder woman retorted, looking up. "You loved your
                     cousin, and you married my poor, unhappy boy for his title and his wealth. It
                     would have been better for him he had died than ever set eyes on your
                     face."</p>
                  <p>"Much better," Edith answered steadily. "Better for him—better for me. You are
                     right, Lady Helena Powyss, I loved my cousin, and I married your nephew for his
                     title and his wealth. I deserve all you can say of me. The worst will not be
                     half bad enough."</p>
                  <p>Her ladyship's face drooped again; her suppressed sobbing was the only sound to
                     be heard.</p>
                  <p>"I have come to you," Edith went on, "to tell you the truth. I don't ask what
                     his secret is he speaks of; I don't wish to know. I think he should be looked
                     after. If he is insane he should not be allowed to go at large."</p>
                  <p>"If he is insane!" Lady Helena cried, looking up again angrily. "You do well to
                     say <emph>if</emph>. He is no more insane than you are!"</p>
                  <p>Edith stood still looking at her. The last trace of color faded from her
                     face.</p>
                  <p>"<emph>Not</emph> insane," she whispered, as if to herself; "<emph>not</emph>
                     insane, and—he deserts me!"</p>
                  <p>"Oh, what have I said!" Lady Helena cried; "forgive me, Edith—I don't know what
                     I am saying—I don't know what to think. Leave me alone, and let me try to
                     understand it, if I can. Your old rooms are ready for you. You have come to
                     remain with me, of course."</p>
                  <p>"For the present—yes. Of the future I have not yet thought. I will leave you
                     alone, Lady Helena, as you desire. I will not trouble you again until
                     to-morrow."</p>
                  <p>She was quitting the room. Lady Helena arose and took her in her arms, her face
                     all blotted with a rain of tears.</p>
                  <p>"My child! my child!" she said, "it is hard on you—so young, so pretty, and
                     only married yesterday! Edith, you frighten me! What are you made of? You look
                     like a stone!"</p>
                  <p>The girl sighed—a long, weary, heart-sick sigh.</p>
                  <p>"I feel like a stone. I can't cry. I think I have no heart, no soul, no
                     feeling, no conscience—that I am scarcely a human being. I am a hardened,
                     callous wretch, for whom any fate is too good. Don't pity me, dear Lady Helena;
                     don't waste one tear on me. I am not worth it."</p>
                  <p>She touched her lips to the wet cheek, and went slowly on her way. No heart—no
                     soul! if she had, both felt benumbed, dead. She seemed to herself a century
                     old, as she toiled on to her familiar rooms. They met no more that day—each
                     kept to her own apartments.</p>
                  <p>The afternoon set in wet and wild; the rain fell ceaselessly and dismally; an
                     evening to depress the happiest-closed down.</p>
                  <p>It was long after dark when there came a ring at the bell, and the footman,
                     opening the door, saw the figure of a man muffled and disguised in slouch hat
                     and great-coat. He held an umbrella over his head, and a scarf was twisted
                     about the lower part of his face. In a husky voice, stifled in his scarf, he
                     asked for Lady Helena.</p>
                  <p>"Her ladyship's at home," the footman answered, rather superciliously, "but she
                     don't see strangers at this hour."</p>
                  <p>"Give her this," the stranger said; "she will see <emph>me</emph>."</p>
                  <p>In spite of hat, scarf, and umbrella, there was something familiar in the air
                     of the visitor, something familiar in his tone. The man took the note
                     suspiciously and passed it to another, who passed it to her ladyship's maid.
                     The maid<pb n="310-311" xml:id="VAC6448-00000155"/> passed it to her ladyship,
                     and her ladyship read it with a suppressed cry.</p>
                  <p>"Show him into the library at once. I will go down."</p>
                  <p>The muffled man was shown in, still wearing hat and scarf. The library was but
                     dimly lit. He stood like a dark shadow amid the other shadows. An instant later
                     the door opened and Lady Helena, pale and wild, appeared on the threshold.</p>
                  <p>"It is," she faltered. "it is—you!"</p>
                  <p>She approached slowly, her terrified eyes riveted on the hidden face.</p>
                  <p>"It is I. Lock the door."</p>
                  <p>She obeyed, she came nearer. He drew away the scarf, lifted the hat, and showed
                     her the face of Sir Victor Catheron.</p>

                  <head>CHAPTER XXIII.</head>
                  <head type="sub">THE SECOND ENDING OF THE TRAGEDY.</head>
                  <p>THE morning dawned over Powyss Place—dawned in wild wind and driving rain
                     still—dawned upon Edith, deserted more strangely than surely bride was ever
                     deserted before.</p>
                  <p>She had darkened her chamber; she had forced herself resolutely to sleep. But
                     the small hours had come before she had succeeded, and it was close upon ten
                     when the dark eyes opened from dreamland to life. Strange mockery! it was ever
                     of Charley and the days that were forever gone she dreamed now.</p>
                  <p>For hours and hours she had paced her room the evening and night before, all
                     the desolation, all the emptiness and loss of her life spread out before her.
                     She had sold herself deliberately and with her eyes open, and this was her
                     reward. Deserted in the hour of her triumph—humiliated as never bride was
                     humiliated before—the talk, the ridicule of the country, an object of
                     contemptuous pity to the whole world. And Charley and Trixy, what would
                        <emph>they</emph> say when they heard of her downfall? She was very proud—no
                     young princess had ever haughtier blood coursing through her royal veins than
                     this portionless American girl. For wealth and rank she had bartered life and
                     love, and verily she had her reward.</p>
                  <p>She suffered horribly. As she paced up and down, her whole face was distorted
                     with the torture within. She flung herself into a seat and tried to still the
                     ceaseless, gnawing, maddening pain. In vain! She could neither sit still, nor
                     think, nor deaden her torment. And when at last she threw herself face downward
                     on her bed it was only to sleep the spent sleep of utter exhaustion. But she
                     was "pluck" to the backbone. Next day, when she had bathed and made her toilet,
                     and descended to the breakfast-room, the closest observer could have read
                     nothing of last night in the fixed calm of her face. The worst that could ever
                     happen had happened; she was ready now to live and die game.</p>
                  <p>Lady Helena, very pale, very tremulous, very frightened and helpless-looking,
                     awaited her. A large, red fire burned on the hearth. Her ladyship was wrapped
                     in a fluffy white shawl, but she shivered in spite of both. The lips that
                     touched Edith's cheek were almost as cold as that cold check itself. Tears
                     started to her eyes as she spoke to her.</p>
                  <p>"My child," she said, "how white you are; how cold and ill you look. I am
                     afraid you did not sleep at all."</p>
                  <p>"Yes, I slept," answered Edith; "for a few hours, at least. The weather has
                     something to do with it, perhaps; I always fall a prey to horrors in wet and
                     windy weather."</p>
                  <p>Then they sat down to the fragrant and tempting breakfast, and ate with what
                     appetite they might. For Edith, she hardly made a pretence of eating—she drank
                     a large cup of strong coffee, and arose.</p>
                  <p>"Lady Helena," she began abruptly, "as I came out of my room, two of the
                     servants were whispering in the corridor. I merely caught a word or two in
                     passing. They stopped immediately upon seeing me. But from that word or two, I
                     infer this—Sir Victor Catheron was here to see you last night."</p>
                  <p>Lady Helena was trifling nervously with her spoon—it fell with a clash now into
                     her cup, and her terrified eyes looked piteously at her companion.</p>
                  <p>"If you desire to keep this a secret too," Edith said, her<pb n="312-313"
                        xml:id="VAC6448-00000156"/> lips curling scornfully, "of course you are at
                     liberty to do so—of course I presume to ask no questions. But if not, I would
                     like to know—it may in some measure influence my own movements."</p>
                  <p>"What do you intend to do?" her ladyship brokenly asked.</p>
                  <p>"That you shall hear presently. Just now the question is: Was your nephew here
                     last night or not?"</p>
                  <p>"He was."</p>
                  <p>She said it with a sort of sob, hiding her face in her hands. "May Heaven help
                     me," she cried; "it is growing more than I can bear. O my child, what can I say
                     to you? how can I comfort you in this great trouble that has come upon
                     you?"</p>
                  <p>"You are very good, but I <unclear>cannot</unclear> not be comforted. I have
                     been utterly <unclear/> from first to last—a wretch who has richly <unclear/>
                     Whatever has befallen me I deserve. I <unclear/> nephew without one spark of
                     affection for <unclear/> no more to me than any laborer on his estate—I doubt
                     whether he ever could have been. I meant to try—who knows how it would have
                     ended? I married Sir Victor Catheron for his rank and riches, his title and
                     rent-roll—I married the baronet, not the man. And it has ended thus. I am
                     widowed on my wedding-day, cast off, forsaken. Have I not earned my fate?"</p>
                  <p>She laughed drearily—a short, mirthless, bitter laugh.</p>
                  <p>"I don't venture to ask too many questions—I don't battle with my fate; I throw
                     up my arms and yield at once. But this I would like to know. Madness is
                     hereditary in his family. Unworthy of all love as I am, I think—I think Sir
                     Victor loved me, and, unless he be mad, I can't understand <emph>why</emph> he
                     deserted me. Lady Helena, answer me this, as you will one day answer to your
                     Marker—Is Sir Victor Catheron sane or mad?"</p>
                  <p>There was a pause as she asked the dreadful question—a pause in which the
                     beating of the autumnal rain upon the glass, the soughing of the autumnal gale
                     sounded preternaturally loud. Then, brokenly, in trembling tones, and not
                     looking up, came Lady Helena's answer:</p>
                  <p>"God pity him and you—he is not mad."</p>
                  <p>Then there was silence again. The elder woman, her face buried in her hands and
                     resting on the table, was crying silently and miserably. At the window, the
                     tall, slim figure of the girl stood motionless, her hands clasped loosely
                     before her, her deep bright eyes looking out at the slanting rain, the
                     low-lying, lead colored sky, the black trees blown aslant in the high October
                     gale.</p>
                  <p>"Not mad?" she repeated, after that long pause; "you are quite certain of this,
                     my lady? Not mad—and he has left me?"</p>
                  <p>"He has left you. O my child! if I dared only tell you all—if I dared only tell
                     you how it is <emph>because</emph> of his great and passionate love for you, he
                     leaves you. If ever there was a martyr on this earth, it is my poor boy. If you
                     had seen him as I saw him last night—worn to a shadow in one day, suffering for
                     the loss of you until death would be a relief—even <emph>you</emph> would have
                     pitied him."</p>
                  <p>"Would I? Well, perhaps so, though my heart is rather a hard one. Of course I
                     don't understand a word of all this—of course, as he said in his letter, some
                     secret of guilt and shame lies behind it all. And yet, perhaps, I could come
                     nearer to the 'Secret' than either you or he think."</p>
                  <p>Lady Helena looked suddenly up, that terrified, hunted look in her eyes.</p>
                  <p>"What do you mean?" she gasped.</p>
                  <p>"This," the firm, cold voice of Edith said, as Edith's bright, dark eyes fixed
                     themselves pitilessly upon her, "this, Lady Helena Powyss: That the secret
                     which takes him from me is the secret of his mother's murder—the secret which
                     he learned at his father's deathbed. Shall I tell you who committed that
                     murder?"</p>
                  <p>Her ladyship's lips moved, but no sound came; she sat spellbound, watching that
                     pale, fixed face before her.</p>
                  <p>"Not Inez Catheron, who was imprisoned for it; not Juan Catheron, who was
                     suspected of it. I am a Yankee, Lady Helena, and consequently clever at
                     guessing. I believe that Sir Victor Catheron, in cold blood, murdered his own
                     wife!"</p>
                  <p>There was a sobbing cry—whether at the shock of the terrible words, or at their
                     truth, who was to tell?</p>
                  <p>"I believe the late Sir Victor Catheron to have been a<pb n="314-315"
                        xml:id="VAC6448-00000157"/> deliberate and cowardly murderer," Edith went
                     on; "so cowardly that his weak brain turned when he saw what he had done and
                     thought of the consequences; and that he paid the penalty of his crime in a
                     life of insanity. The motive I don't pretend to fathom—jealousy of Juan
                     Catheron perhaps; and on his dying bed he confessed all to his son."</p>
                  <p>With face blanched and eyes still full of terror, her ladyship looked at the
                     dark, contemptuous, resolute speaker.</p>
                  <p>"And if this be true—your horrible surmise; mind, I don't admit that it
                     is—would <emph>that</emph> be any excuse for Victor's conduct in leaving
                     you?"</p>
                  <p>"No!" Edith answered, her eyes flashing, "none! Having married me, not ten
                     thousand family secrets should be strong enough to make him desert me. If he
                     had come to me, if he had told me, as he was bound to do before our
                     wedding-day, I would have pitied him with all my soul; if anything could ever
                     have made me care for him as a wife should care for a husband, it would have
                     been that pity. But if he came to me now, and knelt before me, imploring me to
                     return, I would not. I would die sooner!"</p>
                  <p>She was walking up and down now, gleams of passionate scorn and rage in her
                     dark eyes.</p>
                  <p>"It is all folly and balderdash, this talk of his love for me making him leave
                     me. Don't let us have any more of it. No secret on earth should make a
                     bridegroom quit his bride—no power on earth could ever convince me of it!"</p>
                  <p>"And yet," the sad, patient voice of poor Lady Helena sighed, "it is true."</p>
                  <p>Edith stopped in her walk, and looked at her incredulously.</p>
                  <p>"Lady Helena," she said, "you are my kind friend—you know the world—you are a
                     woman of sense, not likely to have your brain turned with vapors. Answer me
                     this—Do you think that, acting as he has done, Sir Victor Catheron has done
                     right?"</p>
                  <p>Lady Helena's sad eyes met hers full. Lady Helena's voice was full of pathos
                     and earnestness, as she replied:</p>
                  <p>"Edith, I am your friend; I am in my sober senses, and, I believe in my soul
                     Victor has done right."</p>
                  <p>"Well," Edith said after a long pause, during which she resumed her walk, "I
                     give it up! I don't understand, and I never shall. I am hopelessly in the dark.
                     I can conceive no motive—none strong enough to make his conduct right. I
                     thought him mad; you say he is sane. I thought he did me a shameful,
                     irreparable wrong; you say he has done right. I will think no more about it,
                     since, if I thought to my dying day, I could come no nearer the truth."</p>
                  <p>"You will know one day," answered Lady Helena; "on his death-bed; and, poor
                     fellow, the sooner that day comes the better for him."</p>
                  <p>Edith made an impatient gesture.</p>
                  <p>"Let us talk about it no more. What is done is done. Whether Sir Victor
                     Catheron lives or dies can in no way concern me now. I think, with your
                     permission, I will go back to my room and try to sleep away this dismal
                     day."</p>
                  <p>"Wait one moment, Edith. It was on your account Victor came here last night to
                     talk over the arrangements he was making for your future."</p>
                  <p>A curious smile came over Edith's lips. She was once more back at the window,
                     looking out at the rain-beaten day.</p>
                  <p>"My future!" she slowly repeated; "in what possible way can my future concern
                     Sir Victor Catheron?"</p>
                  <p>"My child, what a question! In every way. You are honest enough to confess that
                     you married him—poor boy, poor boy—for his rank and rent-roll.
                        <emph>There</emph>, at least, you need not be disappointed. The settlements
                     made upon you before your marriage were, as you know, liberal in the extreme.
                     In addition to that, every farthing that it is in his power to dispose of he
                     intends settling upon you besides. His grandmother's fortune, which descends to
                     him, is to be yours. You may spend money like water if it pleases you—the title
                     and the wealth for which you wedded are still yours. For himself, he intends to
                     go abroad—to the East, I believe. He retains nothing but what will supply his
                     travelling expenses. He cannot meet you—if he did, he might never be able to
                     leave you. O Edith, you blame him, you hate him; but if you had only seen him,
                     only heard him last night, only knew how inevitable it is, how he suffered, how
                     bitterer than death this parting is to him, you would pity, you would forgive
                     him."</p>
                  <p>"You think so," the girl said, with a wistful, weary sigh. "Ah, well, perhaps
                     so. I don't know. Just now I can<pb n="316-317" xml:id="VAC6448-00000158"/>
                     realize nothing except that I am a lost, forsaken wretch; that I
                        <emph>do</emph> hate him; that if I were dying, or that if he were dying, I
                     could not say 'I forgive you.' As to his liberality, I never doubted that; I
                     have owned that I married him for his wealth and station. I own it still; but
                     there are some things not the wealth of a king could compensate for. To desert
                     a bride on her wedding-day is one of them. I repeat, Lady Helena, with your
                     permission, I will go to my room; we won't talk of my future plans and
                     prospects just now. To-morrow you shall know my decision."</p>
                  <p>She turned to go. The elder woman looked after her with yearning, sorrowful
                     eyes.</p>
                  <p>"If I knew what to do—if I knew what to say," she murmured helplessly. "Edith,
                     I loved him more dearly than any son. I think my heart is breaking. O child,
                     don't judge him—be merciful to him who loves you while he leaves you—be
                     merciful to me whose life has been so full of trouble."</p>
                  <p>Her voice broke down in a passion of tears. Edith turned from the door, put her
                     arms around her neck and kissed her.</p>
                  <p>"Dear friend," she said; "dear Lady Helena, I pity <emph>you</emph> from the
                     bottom of my heart. I wish—I wish I could only comfort you."</p>
                  <p>"You can," was the eager answer. "Stay with me, Edith; don't leave me alone. Be
                     a daughter to me; take the place of the son I have lost."</p>
                  <p>But Edith's pale, resolute face did not soften.</p>
                  <p>"To-morrow we will settle all this," was her reply. "Wait until to-morrow."</p>
                  <p>Then she was gone—shut up and locked in her own room. She did not descend to
                     either luncheon or dinner—one of the housemaids served her in her
                     dressing-room. And Lady Helena, alone and miserable, wandered uneasily about
                     the lower rooms, and wondered how she spent that long rainy day.</p>
                  <p>She spent it busily enough. The plain black box she had brought from New York,
                     containing all her earthly belongings, she drew out and packed. It was not hard
                     to do, since nothing went into it but what had belonged to her then. All the
                     dresses, all the jewels, all the costly gifts that had been given her by the
                     man she had married, and his friends, she left as they were. She kept nothing,
                     not even her wedding-ring: she placed it among the rest, in the jewel casket,
                     closed and locked it. Then she wrote a letter to Lady Helena, and placed the
                     key inside. This is what she said:</p>

                              <p>"DEAR FRIEND: When you open this I shall have left Powyss Place
                                 forever. It will be quite useless to follow or endeavor to bring me
                                 back. My mind is made up. I recognize no authority—nothing will
                                 induce me to revoke my decision. I go out into the world to make my
                                 own way. With youth, and health, and ordinary intelligence, it
                                 ought not to be impossible. The things belonging to me when I first
                                 came here I have packed in the black box; in a week you will have
                                 the kindness to forward it to the Euston station. The rest I leave
                                 behind—retaining one or two books as souvenirs of <emph>you</emph>.
                                 I take nothing of Sir Victor Catheron's—not even his name. You must
                                 see that it is utterly impossible; that I must lose the last shred
                                 of pride and self-respect before I could assume his name or take a
                                 penny belonging to him. Dear, kind Lady Helena, good-by. If we
                                 never meet again in the world, remember there is no thought in my
                                 heart of you that is not one of affection and gratitude.</p>

                  </q>
                  <p>Her hand never trembled as she wrote this letter. She placed the key in it,
                     folded, sealed, and addressed it. It was dark by this time. As she knelt to
                     cord and lock her trunk, she espied the writing-case within it. She hesitated a
                     moment, then took it out, opened it, and drew forth the packet of Charley
                     Stuart's letters. She took out the photograph and looked at it with a
                     half-tender, half-sad smile.</p>
                  <p>"I never thought to look at you again," she said softly. "You are all I have
                     left now."</p>
                  <p>She put the picture in her bosom, replaced the rest, and locked the trunk, and
                     put the key in her purse. She sat down and counted her money. She was the
                     possessor of twelve sovereigns—left over from Mr. Stuart, senior's, bounty. It
                     was her whole stock of wealth with which to face and begin the world. Then she
                     sat down resolutely to<pb n="318-319" xml:id="VAC6448-00000159"/> think it out.
                     And the question rose grim before her, "What am I to do?"</p>
                  <p>"Go out into the world and work for your daily bread. Face the poverty you have
                     feared so much, through fear of which, two days ago, you sold yourself. Go to
                     London—it is the centre of the world; lose yourself, hide from all who ever
                     knew you. Go to London. Work of some kind can surely be had by the willing in
                     that mighty city. Go to London."</p>
                  <p>That was the answer that came clearly. She shrank for a moment—the thought of
                     facing life single-handed, poor and alone in that great, terrible, pitiless
                     city, was overwhelming. But she did not flinch from her resolve; her mind was
                     made up. Come woe, come weal, she would go to London.</p>
                  <p>An "A. B. C" railway guide lay on the table—she consulted it. A train left
                     Chester for London at eight o'clock, A. M. Neither Lady Helena nor any of her
                     household was stirring at that hour. She could walk to Chesholm in the early
                     morning, get a fly there and drive to the Chester station in time. By four in
                     the afternoon she would be in London.</p>
                  <p>No thought of returning home ever recurred to her. Home! What home had she? Her
                     step-mother was master and mistress in her father's house, and to return, to go
                     back to Sandypoint, and the life she had left, was as utter an impossibility
                     almost as though she should take a rope and hang herself. She had not the means
                     to go if she had desired, but that made no difference. She could never go back,
                     never see her father, or Charley, or Trixy more. Alone she must live, alone she
                     must die.</p>
                  <p>The flood-gates were opened; she suffered this last night as women of her
                     strong, self-contained temperament only suffer.</p>
                  <p>"Save me, O God! for the waters are come into my soul!" That was the wild,
                     wordless prayer of her heart. Her life was wrecked; her heart was desolate; she
                     must go forth a beggar and an outcast, and fight the bitter battle of life
                     alone. And love, and home, and Charley might have been hers. "It might have
                     been!" Is there any anguish in this world of anguish like that we work with our
                     own hands?—any sorrow like that which we bring upon ourselves? In the darkness
                     she sank down upon her knees, her face covered with her hands, tears, that were
                     as dreadful as tears of blood, falling from her eyes. Lost—lost! all that made
                     life worth having. To live and die alone, that was her fate!</p>
                  <p>So the black, wild night passed, hiding her, as miserable a woman as the wide
                     earth held.</p>
                  <p>The gray dawn of the dull October morning was creeping over the far-off Welsh
                     hills as Edith in shawl and hat, closely veiled, and carrying a hand-bag, came
                     softly down the stairs, and out of a side door, chiefly used by the servants.
                     She met no one. Noiselessly she drew the bolt, opened the door, and looked
                     out.</p>
                  <p>It was raw and cold, a dreary wind still blowing, but it had ceased to rain. As
                     she stood there, seven struck from the turret clock. "One long, last, lingering
                     look behind"—one last upward glance at Lady Helena's windows.</p>
                  <p>"Good-by!" the pale lips whispered; then she passed resolutely out into the
                     melancholy autumn morning and was gone.</p>

                  <p>HALF-PAST four of a delightful June afternoon, and two young ladies sit at two
                     large, lace-draped windows, overlooking a fashionable Mayfair street,
                     alternately glancing over the books they hold, and listlessly watching the
                     passers-by. The house was one of those big black West-End houses, whose outward
                     darkness and dismalness is in direct ratio to their inward brilliance and
                     splendor. This particular room is lofty and long, luxurious with softest
                     carpet, satin upholstery, pictures, flowers, and lace draperies. The two young
                     ladies are, with the exception of their bonnets, in elegant carriage
                     costume.</p>
                  <p>
                     <emph>Young</emph> ladies, I have said; and being unmarried, they are young
                     ladies, of course. One of them, however, is three-and-thirty, counting by
                     actual years—the peerage gives it in cold blood. It is the Lady Gwendoline
                     Drexel. Her companion is the Honorable Mary Howard, just nineteen, and just
                     "out."</p>
                  <p>Lady Gwendoline yawns drearily over her book—Algernon <choice>
                        <sic>Swineburne's</sic>
                        <corr>Swinburne's</corr>
                     </choice> latest—and pulls out her watch impatiently every few minutes.</p>
                  <p>"What can keep Portia?" she exclaims, with irritation. "We should have been
                     gone the last half-hour."</p>
                  <p>The Honorable Mary looks up from her Parisian fashion-book, and glances from
                     the window with a smile.</p>
                  <p>"Restrain your impatience, Gwendoline," she answers. "Here comes Lady Portia
                     now."</p>
                  <p>A minute later the door is flung wide by a tall gentleman in plush, and Lady
                     Portia Hampton sweeps in. She is a tall, slender lady, very like her sister:
                     the same dully fair complexion, the same coiffure of copper-gold, the same
                     light, inane blue eyes. The dull complexion wears at this moment an absolute
                     flush; the light, lack-lustre eyes an absolute sparkle. There is something in
                     her look as she sails forward, that makes them both look up expectantly from
                     their books.</p>
                  <p>"Well?" Lady Gwendoline says.</p>
                  <p>"Gwen!" her sister exclaims—absolutely exclaims—"<emph>whom</emph> do you
                     suppose I have met?"</p>
                  <p>"The Czarina of all the Russias, Pio Nino, Her Majesty back from Osborne, or
                     the Man in the Moon, perhaps," retorts Lady Gwendoline.</p>
                  <p>"Neither," laughs Lady Portia. "Somebody a great deal more mysterious and
                     interesting than any of them. You never will guess whom."</p>
                  <p>"Being five o'clock of a sultry summer day, I don't intend to try. Tell us at
                     once, Portia, and let us go."</p>
                  <p>"Then—prepare to be surprised! Sir Victor Catheron!"</p>
                  <p>"Portia!"</p>
                  <p>"Ah! I thought the name would interest you. Sir Victor Catheron, my dear, alive
                     and in the flesh, though, upon my word, at first sight I almost took him to be
                     his own ghost. Look at her, Mary," laughs her sister derisively. "I have
                     managed to interest her after all, have I not?"</p>
                  <p>For Lady Gwendoline sat erect, her turquoise eyes open to their widest extent,
                     a look akin to excitement in her apathetic face.</p>
                  <p>"But, Portia—Sir Victor! I thought it was an understood thing he did
                        <emph>not</emph> come to England?"</p>
                  <p>"He does, it appears. I certainly had the honor and happiness of shaking hands
                     with him not fifteen minutes ago. I was driving up St. James Street, and caught
                     a glimpse of him on the steps of Fenton's Hotel. At first sight I could not
                     credit my eyes. I had to look again to see whether it were a wraith or a mortal
                     man. Such a pallid shadow of his former self. You used to think him rather
                     handsome, Gwen—you should see him now! He has grown ten years older in as many
                     months—his hair is absolutely streaked with gray, his eyes are sunken, his
                     cheeks are hollow. He<pb n="322-323" xml:id="VAC6448-00000161"/> looks
                     miserably, wretchedly out of health. If men ever do break their hearts," said
                     Lady Portia, going over to a large mirror and surveying herself, "then that
                     misguided young man broke his on his wedding-day."</p>
                  <p>"It serves him right," said Lady Gwendoline, her pale eyes kindling. "I am
                     almost glad to hear it."</p>
                  <p>Her faded face wore a strangely sombre and vindictive look. Lady Portia, with
                     her head on one side, set her bonnet-strings geometrically straight, and smiled
                     maliciously.</p>
                  <p>"Ah, no doubt—perfectly natural, all things considered. And yet, even you might
                     pity the poor fellow to-day, Gwendoline, if you saw him. Mary, dear, is all
                     this Greek and Hebrew to you? You were in your Parisian pensionnat, I remember,
                     when it all happened. <emph>You</emph> don't know the romantic and mysterious
                     story of Sir Victor Catheron, Bart."</p>
                  <p>"I never head the name before, that I recall," answered Miss Howard.</p>
                  <p>"Then pine in ignorance no longer. This young hero, Sir Victor Catheron of
                     Catheron Royals, Cheshire, is our next-door neighbor, down at home, and one
                     year ago the handsome, happy, honored representative of one of the oldest
                     families in the county. His income was large, his estates unincumbered, his
                     manners charming, his morals unexceptionable, and half the young ladies in
                     Cheshire"—with another malicious glance at her sister—"at daggers-drawn for
                     him. There was the slight drawback of insanity in the family—his father died
                     insane, and in his infancy his mother was murdered. But these were only
                     trifling spots on the sun, not worth a second thought. Our young sultan had but
                     to throw the handkerchief, and his obedient Circassians would have flown on the
                     wings of love and joy to pick it up. I grow quite eloquent, don't I? In an evil
                     hour, however, poor young Sir Victor—he was but twenty-three—went over to
                     America. There, in New York, he fell in with a family named Stuart, common rich
                     people, of course, as they all are over there. In the Stuart family there was a
                     young person, a sort of cousin, a Miss Edith Darrell, very poor, kept by them
                     out of charity; and, lamentable to relate, with this young person poor Sir
                     Victor fell in love. Fell in love, my dear, in the most approved old-fashioned
                     style—absurdly and insanely in love—brought the whole family over to Cheshire
                     shire, proposed to little missy, and, as a matter of course, was eagerly
                     accepted. She was an extremely pretty girl, that I will say for her"—with a
                     third sidelong glance of malice at her <foreign xml:lang="FRA">passée</foreign>
                     sister—"and her manners, considering her station, or, rather, her entire lack
                     of station, her poverty, and her nationality, were something quite
                     extraordinary. I declare to you, she positively held her own with the best of
                     us—except for a certain <foreign xml:lang="FRA">brusquerie</foreign> and
                     outspoken way about her, you might have thought her an English girl of our own
                     class. He <emph>would</emph> marry her, and the wedding-day was fixed, and
                     Gwendoline named as chief of the bridemaids."</p>
                  <p>"It is fifteen minutes past five, Portia," the cold voice of Gwendoline broke
                     in. "If we are to drive at all today—"</p>
                  <p>"Patience, Gwen! patience one moment longer! Mary must hear the whole story
                     now. In the Stuart family, I forgot to mention, there was a young man, a cousin
                     of the bride-elect, with whom—it was patent to the dullest apprehension—this
                     young person was in love. She accepted Sir Victor, you understand, while this
                     Mr. Stuart was her lover; a common case enough, and not worthy of mention
                     except for what came after. His manners were rarely perfect too. He was, I
                     think, without exception, the very handsomest and most fascinating man I ever
                     met. You would never dream—never!—that he was an American. Gwendoline will tell
                     you the same. The sister was thoroughly trans-Atlantic, talked slang, said 'I
                     guess,' spoke with an accent, and looked you through and through with an
                     American girl's broad stare. The father and mother were common, to a degree;
                     but the son—well, Gwen and I both came very near losing our hearts to
                     him—didn't we, dear?"</p>
                  <p>"Speak for yourself," was Gwen's ungracious answer. "And, oh! for pity's sake,
                     Portia, cut it short!"</p>
                  <p>"Pray go on, Lady Portia!" said Miss Howard, looking interested.</p>
                  <p>"I am going on," said Lady Portia. "The nice part is to come. The Stuart
                     family, a month or more before the wedding, left Cheshire and came up to
                     London—why, we can only surmise—to keep the lovers apart. Immediately after
                     their departure, the bride-elect was taken ill, and had to be carried off to
                     Torquay for change of air and all that.<pb n="324-325"
                        xml:id="VAC6448-00000162"/> The wedding-day was postponed until some time in
                     October; but at last it came. She looked very beautiful, I must say, that
                     morning, and perfectly self-possessed; but poor Sir Victor! He was ghastly.
                     Whether even then he suspected something I do not know; he looked a picture of
                     abject misery at the altar and the breakfast. Something was wrong; we all saw
                     that; but no explanation took place there. The happy pair started on their
                     wedding-journey down into Wales, and that was the last we ever saw of them.
                     What followed, we know; but until to-day I have never set eyes on the
                     bridegroom. The bride, I suppose, none of us will ever set eyes on more."</p>
                  <p>"Why?" the Honorable Mary asked.</p>
                  <p>"This, my dear: An hour after their arrival in Carnarvon, Sir Victor deserted
                     his bride forever! What passed between them, what scene ensued, nobody knows,
                     only this—he positively left her forever. That the handsome and fascinating
                     American cousin had something to do with it, there can be no doubt. Sir Victor
                     took the next train from Wales to London; she remained overnight. Next day she
                     had the audacity to return to Powyss Place and present herself to his aunt,
                     Lady Helena Powyss. She remained there one day and two nights. On the first
                     night, muffled and disguised, Sir Victor came down from town, had an interview
                     with his aunt, no doubt told her all, and departed again without seeing the
                     girl he had married. The bride next day had an interview with Lady Helena—her
                     last—and next morning, before any one was stirring, stole out of the house like
                     the guilty creature she was, and never was heard of more. The story, though
                     they tried to hush it up, got in all the papers—'Romance in High Life,' they
                     called it. Everybody talked of it—it was the nine-days' wonder of town and
                     country. The actors in it, one by one, disappeared. Lady Helena shut up Powyss
                     Place and went abroad; Sir Victor vanished from the world's ken; the heroine of
                     the piece no doubt went back to her native land. That, in brief, is the story,
                     my dear, of the interesting spectre I met to-day on the steps of Fenton's. Now,
                     young ladies, put on your bonnets and come. I wish to call at Madame
                     Mirebeau's, Oxford Street, before going to the park, and personally inspect my
                     dress for the duchess' ball to-night."</p>
                  <p>Ten minutes later and the elegant barouche of Lady Portia Hampton was bowling
                     along to Oxford Street.</p>
                  <p>"What did you say to Sir Victor, Portia?" her sister deigned to ask. "What did
                     he say to you?"</p>
                  <p>"He said very little to me—the answers he gave were the most vague. I naturally
                     inquired concerning his health first, he really looked so wretchedly broken
                     down; and he said there was nothing the matter that he had been a little out of
                     sorts lately, that was all. My conviction is," said Lady Portia, who, like the
                     rest of her sex, and the world, put the worst possible construction on
                     everything, "that he has become dissipated. Purple circles and hollow eyes
                     always tell of late hours and hard drinking. I asked him next where he had been
                     all those ages, and he answered briefly and gloomily, in one word, 'Abroad.' I
                     asked him thirdly, where, and how was Lady Helena; he replied that Lady Helena
                     was tolerably well, and at present in London. 'In London!' I exclaimed, in a
                     shocked tone, 'my dear Sir Victor, and <emph>I</emph> not know it!' He
                     explained that his aunt was living in the closest retirement, at the house of a
                     friend in the neighborhood of St. John's Wood, and went nowhere. Then he lifted
                     his hat, smiled horribly a ghastly smile, turned his back upon me, and walked
                     away. Never asked for you, Gwendoline, or Colonel Hampton, or my health, or
                     anything."</p>
                  <p>Lady Gwendoline did not reply. They had just entered Oxford Street, and amid
                     the moving throng of well-dressed people on the pavement, her eye had singled
                     out one figure—the figure of a tall, slender, fair-haired man.</p>
                  <p>"Portia!" she exclaimed, in a suppressed voice, "look there! Is not that Sir
                     Victor Catheron now?"</p>
                  <p>"Where? Oh, I see. Positively it is, and—yes—he sees us. Tell John to draw up,
                     Gwendoline. Now, Mary, you shall see a live hero of romance for once in your
                     life. He shall take a seat, whether he likes it or not—My <emph>dear</emph> Sir
                     Victor, what a happy second rencontré, and Gwendoline dying to see you. Pray
                     let us take you up—oh, we will have no refusal. We have an unoccupied seat
                     here, you see, and we all insist upon your occupying it. Miss Howard, let me
                     present our nearest neighbor at home, and particular friend<pb n="326-327"
                        xml:id="VAC6448-00000163"/> everywhere, Sir Victor Catheron. The Honorable
                     Miss Howard, Sir Victor."</p>
                  <p>They had drawn up close to the curbstone. The gentleman had doffed his hat, and
                     would have passed on, had he not been taken possession of in this summary
                     manner. Lady Gwendoline's primrose-kidded hand was extended to him, Lady
                     Gwendoline's smiling face beamed upon him from the most exquisite of Parisian
                     bonnets. Miss Howard bowed and scanned him curiously. Lady Portia was not to be
                     refused—he knew that of old. Of two bores, it was the lesser bore to yield than
                     resist. Another instant, and the barouche was rolling away to Madame
                     Mirebeau's, and Sir Victor Catheron was within it. He sat by Lady Gwendoline's
                     side, and under the shadow of her rose-silk and point-lace parasol she could
                     see for herself how shockingly he was changed. Her sister had not exaggerated.
                     He was worn to a shadow; his fair hair was streaked with gray; his lips were
                     set in a tense expression of suffering—either physical or mental—perhaps both.
                     His blue eyes looked sunken and lustreless. It was scarcely to be believed that
                     ten short months could have wrought such wreck. He talked little—his responses
                     to their questions were monosyllabic. His eyes constantly wandered away from
                     their faces to the passers-by. He had the look of a man ever on the alert, ever
                     on the watch—waiting and watching for some one he could not see. Miss Howard
                     had never seen him before, but from the depths of her heart she pitied him.
                     Sorrow, such as rarely falls to the lot of man, had fallen to this man, she
                     knew.</p>
                  <p>He was discouragingly absent and <foreign xml:lang="FRA">distrait</foreign>. It
                     came out by chance that the chief part of the past ten months had been spent by
                     him in America.</p>
                  <p>In America! The sisters exchanged glances. <emph>She</emph> was there, no
                     doubt. Had they met? was the thought of both. They reached the fashionable
                     modiste's.</p>
                  <p>"You will come in with us, Sir Victor," Lady Portia commanded gayly. "We all
                     have business here, but we will only detain you a moment."</p>
                  <p>He gave her his arm to the shop. It was large and elegant, and three or four
                     deferential shop-women came forward to wait upon them and place seats. The
                     victimized baronet, still listless and bored, sat down to wait and escort them
                     back to the carriage before taking his departure. To be exhibited in the park
                     was the farthest possible from his intention.</p>
                  <p>Lady Portia's dress was displayed—a rose velvet, with point-lace trimmings—and
                     found fault with, of course. Lady Gwendoline and the Hon. Mary transacted their
                     affairs at a little distance. For her elder ladyship the train did not suit
                     her, the bodice did not please her; she gave her orders for altering sharply
                     and concisely. The deferential shopgirl listened and wrote the directions down
                     on a card. When her patroness had finished she carried robe and card down the
                     long room and called:</p>
                  <p>"Miss Stuart!"</p>
                  <p>A voice answered—only one word, "Yes," softly spoken, but Sir Victor Catheron
                     started as if he had been shot. The long show-room lay in semi-twilight—the gas
                     not yet lit. In this twilight another girl advanced, took the rose-velvet robe
                     and written card. The light flashed upon her figure and hair for one
                     instant—then she disappeared.</p>
                  <p>And Sir Victor?</p>
                  <p>He sat like a man suddenly aroused from a deep, long sleep. He had not seen the
                     face; he had caught but a glimpse of the figure and head; he had heard the
                     voice speak but one little word, "Yes;" <emph>but</emph>—</p>
                  <p>Was he asleep or awake? Was it only a delusion, as so many other fancied
                     resemblances had been, or was it after all—after all—</p>
                  <p>He rose to his feet, that dazed look of a sleep-walker, suddenly aroused, on
                     his face.</p>
                  <p>"Now, then, Sir Victor," the sharp, clear voice of Lady Portia said, at his
                     side, "your martyrdom is ended. We are ready to go."</p>
                  <p>He led her to the carriage, assisted her and the young ladies in. How he
                     excused himself—what incoherent words he said—he never knew. He was only
                     conscious after a minute that the carriage had rolled away, and that he was
                     still standing, hat in hand, on the sidewalk in front of Madame Mirebeau's;
                     that the passers-by were staring at him and that he was alone.</p>
                  <p>"Mad!" Lady Portia said, shrugging her shoulders and touching her forehead.
                     "Mad as a March hare!"</p>
                  <pb n="328-329" xml:id="VAC6448-00000164"/>
                  <p>"Mad?" Miss Howard repeated softly. "No, I don't think so. Not mad, only
                     very—very miserable."</p>
                  <p>He replaced his hat and walked back to the shop-door. There reason, memory
                     returned. What was he going in for? What should he say? He stood still
                     suddenly, as though gazing at the wax women in elegant ball costume, swinging
                     slowly and smirkingly round and round. He had heard a voice—he had seen a
                     shapely head crowned with dark, silken hair—a tall, slender girl's figure—that
                     was all. He had seen and heard such a hundred times since that fatal wedding
                     evening, and when he had hunted them down, the illusion had vanished, and his
                     lost love was as lost as ever. His lost Edith—his bride, his darling, the wife
                     he had loved and left—for whom all those weary, endless months he had been
                     searching and searching in vain. Was she living or dead? Was she in London—in
                        England—<emph>where?</emph> He did not know—no one knew. Since that dark,
                     cold autumn morning when she had fled from Powyss Place she had never been seen
                     or heard of. She had kept her word—she had taken nothing that was his—not a
                     farthing. Wherever she was, she might be starving to-day. He clenched his hands
                     and teeth as he thought of it.</p>
                  <p>"Oh!" his passionate, despairing heart cried, "let me find her—let me save her,
                     and—let me die!"</p>
                  <p>He had searched for her everywhere, by night and by day. Money flowed like
                     water—all in vain. He went to New York—he found the people there he had once
                     known, but none of them could tell him anything of her or the Stuarts. The
                     Stuarts had failed, were utterly ruined—it was understood that Mr. Stuart was
                     dead—of the others they knew nothing. He went to Sandypoint in search of her
                     father. Mr. Darrell and his family had months ago sold out and gone West. He
                     could fine none of them; he gave it up at length and returned to England. Ten
                     months had passed; many resemblances had beguiled him, but to-day Edith was as
                     far off, as lost as ever.</p>
                  <p>The voice he had heard, the likeness he had seen, would they prove false and
                     empty too, and leave his heart more bitter than ever? What he would do
                        <emph>when</emph> he found her he did not consider. He only wanted to find
                     her. His whole heart, and life, and soul were bound up in that.</p>
                  <p>He paced up and down in front of the shop; the day's work would be over
                     presently and the work-women would come forth. Then he would see again this
                     particular workwoman who had set his heart beating with a hope that turned him
                     dizzy and sick. Six o'clock! seven o'clock! Would they never come? Yes; even as
                     he thought it, half mad with impatience, the door opened, and nearly a dozen
                     girls filed forth. He drew his hat over his eyes, he kept a little in the
                     shadow and watched them one by one with wildly eager eyes as they appeared.
                     Four, five, six, seven—she came at last, the eighth. The tall, slender figure,
                     the waving, dark hair, he knew them at once. The gaslight fell full upon her as
                     she drew her veil over her face and walked rapidly away. Not before he ad seen
                     it, not before he had recognized it—no shadow, no myth, no illusion this time.
                     His wife—Edith.</p>
                  <p>He caught the wall for support. For a moment the pavement beneath his feet
                     heaved, the starry sky spun round. Then he started up, steadied himself by a
                     mighty effort, and hurried in pursuit.</p>
                  <p>She had gained upon him over thirty yards. She was always a rapid walker, and
                     he was ailing and weak. His heart throbbed now, so thick and fast, that every
                     breath was a pain. He did not gain upon her, he only kept her in sight. He
                     would have known that quick, decided walk, the poise of the head and shoulders,
                     anywhere. He followed her as fast as his strength and the throng of passers-by
                     would let him, yet doing no more than keeping her well in sight.</p>
                  <p>Where Oxford Street nears Tottenham Court Road she suddenly diverged and
                     crossed over, turning into the latter crowded thoroughfare. Still he followed.
                     The throng was even more dense here than in Oxford Street, to keep her in sight
                     more difficult. For nearly ten minutes he did it, then suddenly all strength
                     left him. For a minute or two he felt as though he must fall. There was a spasm
                     of the heart that was like a knife-thrust. He caught at a lamp-post. He
                     beckoned a passing hansom by a sort of expiring effort. The cab whirled up
                     beside him; he got in somehow, and fell back, blinded and dizzy, in the
                     seat.</p>
                  <p>"Where to, sir?" Cabby called twice before he received<pb n="330-331"
                        xml:id="VAC6448-00000165"/> an answer; then "Fenton's Hotel" came faintly to
                     him from his ghostly looking fare. The little aperture at the top was slammed
                     down, and the hansom rattled off.</p>
                  <p>"Blessed if I don't think the young swell's drunk, or 'aving a fit," thought
                     the Cad, as he speeded his horse down Tottenham Court Road.</p>
                  <p>To look for her further in his present state, Sir Victor felt would be useless.
                     He must get to his lodgings, get some brandy, and half-an-hour's time to think
                     what to do next. He had found her; she was alive, she was well, thank Heaven!
                     thank Heaven for that! To-morrow would find her again at Madame Mirebeau's at
                     work with the rest.</p>
                  <p>At work—her daily toil! He covered his wasted face with his wasted hands, and
                     tears that were like a woman's fell from him. He had been weak and worn out for
                     a long time—he gave way utterly, body and mind, now.</p>
                  <p>"My darling," he sobbed; "my darling whom I would die to make happy—whose life
                     I have so utterly ruined. To think that while I spend wealth like water,
                        <emph>you</emph> should toil for a crust of bread—alone, poor, friendless,
                     in this great city. How will I answer to God and man for what I have done?"</p>

                  <head>CHAPTER II.</head>
                  <head type="sub">EDITH.</head>
                  <p>THE last night of the July day had faded out, and a hot, murky night settled
                     down over London. The air was stifling in the city; out in the suburbs you
                     still caught a breath, fresh and sweet scented, from the fragrant fields</p>
                  <p>At Poplar Lodge, St. John's Wood, this murky, summer night all the windows
                     stood wide. In the drawing-room two women sat together. The elder reading
                     aloud, the younger busy over some feminine handicraft. A cluster of waxlights
                     burned above them, shining full on two pale, worn faces—the faces of women to
                     whom suffering and sorrow have long been household words. Both wore deepest
                     mourning—the elder a widow's weeds, the hair of the younger thickly streaked
                     with gray. Now and then both raised their eyes from a book and needlework, and
                     glanced expectantly at the clock on the mantel. Evidently they waited for some
                     one who did not come. They were Lady Helena Powyss and Inez Catheron, of
                     course.</p>
                  <p>"Eight," the elder woman said, laying down her book with a sigh as the clock
                     struck. "If he were coming to-night he would be here before now."</p>
                  <p>"I don't give him up even yet," Inez answered cheerfully. "Young men are not to
                     be depended on, and he has often come out much later than this. We are but dull
                     company for him, poor boy—all the world are but dull company for him at
                     present, since <emph>she</emph> is not of them. Poor boy! poor Victor! it is
                     very hard on him."</p>
                  <p>"I begin to think Edith will never be found," said Lady Helena with a sigh.</p>
                  <p>"My dear aunt, I don't. No one is ever lost, utterly, in these days. She will
                     be found, believe me, unless—"</p>
                  <p>"Well?"</p>
                  <p>"Unless she is dead."</p>
                  <p>"She is not dead," affirmed Lady Helena; "of that I am sure. You didn't know
                     her, Inez, or you wouldn't think it; the most superb specimen of youth and
                     strength and handsome health I ever saw in my life. She told me once she never
                     remembered a sick day since she was born—you had but to look into her bright
                     eyes and clear complexion to be sure of it. She is not dead, in the natural
                     course of things, and she isn't one of the kind that ever take their lives in
                     their own hands. She had too much courage and too much common-sense."</p>
                  <p>"Perhaps so, and yet suffering tells—look at poor Victor."</p>
                  <p>"Ah, poor Victor indeed! But the case is different—it was only her pride, not
                     her heart, that bled. He loved her—he loves her with a blind, unreasoning
                     passion that it is a misfortune for any human creature to feel for another. And
                     she never cared for him—not as much as you do for the sewing in your hand. That
                     is what breaks my heart—to see him dying before my eyes for love of a girl who
                     has no feeling for him but hatred and contempt."</p>
                  <pb n="332-333" xml:id="VAC6448-00000166"/>
                  <p>Inez sighed.</p>
                  <p>"It is natural," she said. "Think how she was left—in her very bridal hour,
                     without one word of explanation. Who could forgive it?"</p>
                  <p>"No one, perhaps; it is not for that I feel indignant with her. It is for her
                     ever accepting him at all. She loved her cousin—he would have married her; and
                     for title and wealth she threw him over and accepted Victor. In that way she
                     deserved her fate. She acted heartlessly; and yet, one can't help pitying her
                     too. I believe she would have done her best to make him a good wife, after all.
                     I wish—I wish he could find her."</p>
                  <p>"She might be found readily enough," Inez answered, "if Victor would but employ
                     the usual means—I allude, of course, to the detective police. But he won't set
                     a detective on her track if she is never found—he persists in looking for her
                     himself. He is wearing his life out in the search. If ever I saw death pictured
                     on any face, I saw it in his when he was here last. If he would but consult
                     that German doctor who is now in London, and who is so skilful in all diseases
                     of the heart—hark!" she broke off suddenly, "here he is at last."</p>
                  <p>Far off a gate had opened and shut—no one had a key to that ever-locked outer
                     gate but Sir Victor, and the next moment the roll of his night-cab up the drive
                     was heard. The house-door opened, his familiar step ascended the stairs, not
                     heavy and dragging as usual, but swift and light, almost as it used to be.
                     Something had happened! They saw it in his face at the first glance. There was
                     but one thing that <emph>could</emph> happen. Lady Helena dropped her book,
                     Inez started to her feet; neither spoke, both waited breathless.</p>
                  <p>"Aunt! cousin!" the young man cried, breathless and hoarse, "she is found!"</p>
                  <p>There was a cry from his aunt. As he spoke he dropped, panting and exhausted
                     with his speed, into a chair and laid his hand upon his breast to still its
                     heavy, suffocating throbs.</p>
                  <p>"Found!" exclaimed Lady Helena; "where—when—how?"</p>
                  <p>"Wait, aunt," the voice of Inez said gently; "give him time. Don't you see he
                     can scarcely pant? Not a word yet Victor—let me fetch you a glass of wine."</p>
                  <p>She brought it and he drank it. His face was quite ghastly, livid, bluish rings
                     encircling his mouth and eyes. He certainly looked desperately ill, and more
                     fitted for a sick-bed than a breathless night ride from St. James Street to St.
                     John's Wood. He lay back in his chair, closed his eyes, struggled with his
                     panting breath. They sat and waited in silence, far more concerned for him than
                     for the news he bore.</p>
                  <p>He told them at last, slowly, painfully, of his chance meeting with Lady Portia
                     Hampton, of his enforced visit to the Oxford Street dress-maker—of his glimpse
                     of the tall girl with the dark hair—of his waiting, of his seeing, and
                     recognizing Edith, his following her, and of his sudden giddy faintness that
                     obliged him to give up the chase.</p>
                  <p>"You'll think me an awful muff," he said; "I haven't an idea how I came to be
                     such a mollicoddle, but I give you my word I fainted dead away like a
                     school-girl when I got to my room. I suppose it was partly this confounded
                     palpitation of the heart, and partly the shock of the great surprise and joy.
                     Jamison brought me all right somehow, after awhile, and then I came here. I had
                     to do something, or I believe I should have gone clear out of my senses."</p>
                  <p>Then there was a pause. The two women looked at each other, then at him, his
                     eager eyes, his excited, wild-looking, haggard face.</p>
                  <p>"Well," he cried impatiently, "have you nothing to say? Is it nothing to you
                     that after all these months—months—great Heavens! it seems centuries. But I
                     have found her at last—toiling for her living, while we—oh! I can't think of
                     it—I dare not; it drives me mad!"</p>
                  <p>He sprang up and began pacing to and fro, looking quite as much like a madman
                     as a sane one.</p>
                  <p>"Be quiet, Victor," his aunt said. "It is madness indeed for you to excite
                     yourself in this way. Of course we rejoice in all that makes you happy. She is
                     found—Heaven be praised for it!—she is alive and well—thank Heaven also for
                     that. And now—what next?"</p>
                  <p>"What next?" He paused and looked at her in astonishment. "You ask what next?
                     What next can there be, except to go the first thing to-morrow morning and take
                     her away."</p>
                  <pb n="334-335" xml:id="VAC6448-00000167"/>
                  <p>"Take her away!". Lady Helena repeated, setting her lips; "take her
                        <emph>where</emph>, Victor? To you?"</p>
                  <p>His ghastly face turned a shade ghastlier. He caught his breath and grasped the
                     back of the chair as though a spasm of unendurable agony had pierced his heart.
                     In an instant his aunt's arms were about him, tears streaming down her cheeks,
                     her imploring eyes lifted to his:</p>
                  <p>"Forgive me, Victor, forgive me! I ought not to have asked you that. But I did
                     not mean—I know <emph>that</emph> can never be, my poor boy. I will do whatever
                     you say. I will go to her, of course—I will fetch her here if she will
                     come."</p>
                  <p>"If she will come!" he repeated hoarsely, disengaging himself from her; "what
                     do you mean by <emph>if</emph>? There can be no 'if' in the matter. She is my
                     wife—she is Lady Catheron—do you think she is to be left penniless and alone
                     drudging for the bread she eats? I tell you, you <emph>must</emph> bring her;
                     she <emph>must</emph> come!"</p>
                  <p>His passionate, suppressed excitement terrified her. In pain and fear and
                     helplessness she looked at her niece. Inez, with that steady self-possession
                     that is born of long and great endurance, came to the rescue at once.</p>
                  <p>"Sit down, Victor!" her full, firm tones said, "and don't work yourself up to
                     this pitch of nervous excitement. It's folly—useless folly, and its end will be
                     prostration and a sick-bed. About your wife, Aunt Helena will do what she can,
                     but—what can she do? You have no authority over her now; in leaving her you
                     resigned it. It is unutterably painful to speak of this, but under the
                     circumstances we must. She refused with scorn everything you offered her
                     before; unless these ten past months have greatly altered her, she will refuse
                     again. She seems to have been a very proud, high-spirited girl, but her hard
                     struggle with the world may have beaten down that—and—"</p>
                  <p>"Don't!" he cried passionately; "I can't bear it. O my God! to think what I
                     have done—what I have been forced to do! what I have made her suffer—what she
                     must think of me—and that I live to bear it! To think I have endured it all,
                     when a pistol-ball would have ended my torments any day!"</p>
                  <p>"When you talk such wicked folly as that," said Inez Catheron, her strong,
                     steady eyes fixed upon his face, "I have no more to say. You did your duty
                     once: you acted like a hero, like a martyr—it seems a pity to spoil it all by
                     such cowardly rant as this."</p>
                  <p>"My duty!" he exclaimed, huskily. "Was it my duty? Sometimes I doubt it;
                     sometimes I think if I had never left her, all might have been well. Was it my
                     duty to make my life a hell on earth, to tear my heart from my bosom, as I did
                     in the hour I left her, to spoil her life for her, to bring shame, reproach,
                     and poverty upon her? If I had not left her, could the worst that might have
                     happened been any worse than that?"</p>
                  <p>"Much worse—infinitely worse. You are the sufferer, believe me, not she. What
                     is all she has undergone in comparison with what <emph>you</emph> have endured?
                     And one day she will know all, and love and honor you as you deserve."</p>
                  <p>He did his face in his hands, and turned away from the light.</p>
                  <p>"One day," they heard him murmur; "one day—the day of my death. Pray Heaven it
                     may be soon."</p>
                  <p>"I think," Inez said after a pause, "you had better let <emph>me</emph> go and
                     speak instead of Aunt Helena. She has undergone so much—she isn't able, believe
                     me, Victor, to undergo more. Let me go to your wife; all Aunt Helena can say,
                     all she can urge, I will. If it be in human power to bring her back, I will
                     bring her. All I dare tell her, I will tell. But, after all, it is so little,
                     and she is so proud. Don't hope too much."</p>
                  <p>"It is so little," he murmured again, his face still hidden; "so little, and
                     there is so much to tell. Oh!" he broke forth, with a passionate cry, "I can't
                     bear this much longer. If she will come for nothing else, she will come for the
                     truth, and the truth shall be told. What are a thousand promises to the living
                     or the dead to the knowledge that she hates and scorns me!"</p>
                  <p>They said nothing to him—they knew it was useless—they knew his paroxysm would
                     pass, as so many others had passed, and that by to-morrow he would be the last
                     to wish to tell.</p>
                  <p>"You will surely not think of returning to St. James Street<pb n="336-337"
                        xml:id="VAC6448-00000168"/> to-night?" said Inez by way of diversion. "You
                     will remain here, and at the earliest possible hour to-morrow you will drive me
                     to Oxford Street. I will do all I can—you believe that, my cousin, I know. And
                        if—<emph>if</emph> I am successful, will"—she paused and looked at him—"will
                     you meet her, Victor?"</p>
                  <p>"I don't know yet; my head is in a whirl. To-night I feel as though I could do
                     anything, brave anything—to-morrow I suppose I will feel differently. Don't ask
                     me what I will do to-morrow until to-morrow comes. I will remain all night, and
                     I will go to my room at once; I feel dazed and half sick. Good-night."</p>
                  <p>He left them abruptly. They heard him toil wearily up to his room and lock the
                     door. Long after, the two women sat together talking with pale, apprehensive
                     faces.</p>
                  <p>"She won't come—I am as sure of it as that I sit here," were Lady Helena's
                     parting words as they separated for the night. "I know her better than he does,
                     and I am not carried away by his wild hopes. She will not come."</p>
                  <p>Sir Victor descended to breakfast, looking unutterably pallid and haggard in
                     the morning light. Well he might; he had not slept for one moment.</p>
                  <p>But he was more composed, calm, and quiet, and there was almost as little hope
                     in his heart as in Lady Helena's. Immediately after breakfast, Miss Catheron,
                     closely veiled, entered the cab with him, and was driven to Oxford Street. It
                     was a very silent drive; she was glad when it was over, and he set her down
                     near the shop of Madame Mirebeau.</p>
                  <p>"I will wait here," he said. "If she will come with you, you will take a cab
                     and drive back to Poplar Lodge. If she does not—" he had to pause a
                     moment—"then return to me, and I will take you home."</p>
                  <p>She bent her head in assent, and entered the shop. Her own heart was beating at
                     the thought of the coming interview and its probable ending. She advanced to
                     the counter, and, without raising her veil, inquired if Miss Stuart were
                     come.</p>
                  <p>The girl looked inquisitively at the hidden face, and answered:</p>
                  <p>"Yes, Miss Stuart had come."</p>
                  <p>"I wish to see her particularly, and in private, for a few moments. Can you
                     manage it for me?"</p>
                  <p>She slipped a sovereign into the shopwoman's hand. There was a second curious
                     look at the tall, veiled lady, but the sovereign was accepted. A side door
                     opened, and she was shown into an empty room.</p>
                  <p>"You can wait here, ma'am," the girl said. "I'll send her to you."</p>
                  <p>Miss Catheron walked over to the window; that nervous heart beat quicker than
                     ever. When had she been nervous before? The window overlooked busy, bright
                     Oxford Street, and in the distance she saw the waiting cab and her cousin's
                     solitary figure. The sight gave her courage. For his sake, poor fellow, she
                     would do all human power could do.</p>
                  <p>"You wish to see me, madame?"</p>
                  <p>A clear, soft voice spoke. The door had quietly opened and a young girl
                     entered.</p>
                  <p>Inez Catheron turned round, and for the second time in her life looked in the
                     face of her cousin's wife.</p>
                  <p>Yes, it was his wife. The face she had seen under the trees of Powyss Place she
                     saw again to-day in the London milliner's parlor. The same darkly handsome,
                     quietly resolute young face, the same gravely beautiful eyes, the same slender,
                     graceful figure, the same silky waves of blackish-brown hair. To her eyes there
                     was no change; she had grown neither thinner nor paler; she had lost none of
                     the beauty and grace that had won away Sir Victor Catheron's heart. She was
                     very plainly dressed in dark gray of some cheap material, but fitting
                     perfectly; linen bands at neck and throat, and a knot of cherry ribbon. And the
                     slim finger wore no wedding-ring. She took it all in, in three seconds; then
                     she advanced.</p>
                  <p>"I wished to see you. We are not likely to be disturbed?"</p>
                  <p>"We are likely to be disturbed at any moment. It is the room where Madame
                     Mirebeau tries on the dresses of her customers; and my time is very
                     limited."</p>
                  <p>The dark, grave eyes were fixed upon the close veil expectantly. Inez Catheron
                     threw it back.</p>
                  <p>"Edith!" she said—and at the sound of her name the<pb n="338-339"
                        xml:id="VAC6448-00000169"/> girl recoiled—"you don't know me, but I think
                     you will know my name. I am Inez Catheron."</p>
                  <p>She recoiled a step farther, her dark face paling and growing set—her large
                     eyes seeming to darken and dilate—her lips setting themselves in a tense line.
                        "<emph>Well?</emph>" was all she said.</p>
                  <p>Inez stretched out her hands with an imploring gesture, drawing near as the
                     other retreated.</p>
                  <p>"Oh, Edith, you know why I have come! you know who has sent me. You know
                        <emph>what</emph> I have come for."</p>
                  <p>The dark, deep eyes met hers, full, cold, hard, and bright as diamonds.</p>
                  <p>"I don't in the least know what you have come for. I haven't an idea who can
                     have sent you. I know who you are. You are Sir Victor Catheron's cousin."</p>
                  <p>Without falter or flinch she spoke his name—with a face of stone she waited for
                     the answer. If any hope had lingered in the breast of Inez it died out as she
                     looked at her now.</p>
                  <p>"Yes," she said sadly; "I am Victor Catheron's cousin, and there could be but
                     one to send me here—Victor Catheron himself."</p>
                  <p>"And why has Sir Victor Catheron given you that trouble?"</p>
                  <p>"Oh, Edith!" again that imploring gesture, "let me call you so—need you ask?
                     All these months he has been searching for you, losing health and rest in the
                     fruitless quest—wearing himself to a very shadow looking for you. He has been
                     to New York, he has hunted London—it has brought him almost to the verge of
                     death, this long, vain, miserable search."</p>
                  <p>Her perfect lips curled scornfully, her eyes shot forth gleams of contempt, but
                     her voice was very quiet.</p>
                  <p>"And again I ask why—why has Sir Victor Catheron given himself all this
                     unnecessary trouble?"</p>
                  <p>"Unnecessary! You call it that! A husband's search for a lost wife."</p>
                  <p>"Stop, Miss Catheron!" she lifted her hand, and her eyes flashed. "You make a
                     mistake. Sir Victor Catheron's wife I am not—never will be. The ceremony we
                     went through, ten months ago, down in Cheshire, means nothing, since a
                     bridegroom who deserts his bride on her wedding-day, resigns all right to the
                     name and authority of husband. Mind, I don't regret it now; I would not have it
                     otherwise if I could. And this is not bravado, Miss Catheron; I mean it. In the
                     hour I married your cousin he was no more to me than one of his own footmen—I
                     say it to my own shame and lasting dishonor; and I thank Heaven most sincerely
                     now, that whether he were mad or sane, that he deserted me as he did. At last I
                     am free—not bound for life to a man that by this time I might have grown to
                     loathe. For I think my indifference then would have grown to hate. Now I simply
                     scorn him in a degree less than I scorn myself. I never wish to hear his
                     name—but I also would not go an inch out of my way to avoid him. He is simply
                     nothing to me—nothing. If I were dead and in my grave, I could not be one whit
                     more lost to him than I am. Why he has presumed to search for me is beyond my
                     comprehension. How he has had the audacity to hunt me down, and send you here,
                     surpasses belief. I wonder you came, Miss Catheron! As you have come, let me
                     give you this word of advice: make your first visit your last. Don't come again
                     to see me—don't let Sir Victor Catheron dog my steps or in any way interfere
                     with me. I never was a very good or patient sort of person—I have not become
                     more so of late. I am only a girl, alone and poor, but," her eyes flashed
                     fire—literally fire—and her hands clenched, "I warn him—it will not be
                     safe!"</p>
                  <p>Inez drew back. What she had expected she hardly knew—certainly not this.</p>
                  <p>"As I said before," Edith went on, "my time is limited. Madame does not allow
                     her working-girls to receive visitors in working hours. Miss Catheron, I have
                     the honor to wish you good-morning."</p>
                  <p>"Stay!" Inez cried, "for the love of Heaven. Oh, what shall I say, how shall I
                     soften her? Edith, you don't understand. I wish—I wish I dared tell you the
                     secret that took Victor from your side that day! He loves you—no, that is too
                     poor a word to express what he feels; his life is paying the penalty of his
                     loss. He is dying, Edith, dying of heart disease, brought on by what he has
                     suffered in losing you. In his dying hour he will tell you all; and<pb
                        n="340-341" xml:id="VAC6448-00000170"/> his one prayer is for death, that he
                     may tell you, that you may cease to wrong and hate him as you do. O Edith,
                     listen to me—pity me—pity him who is dying for you! Don't be so hard. See, I
                     kneel to you!—as you hope for mercy in your own dying hour, Edith Catheron,
                     have mercy on him!"</p>
                  <p>She flung herself on her knees, tears pouring over her face, and held up her
                     clasped hands.</p>
                  <p>"For pity's sake, Edith—for your own sake. Don't harden your heart; try and
                     believe, though you may not understand. I tell you he loves you—that he is a
                     dying man. We are all sinners; as you hope for pity and mercy, have pity and
                     mercy on him now." With her hand on the door, with Inez Catheron clinging to
                     her dress, she paused, moved, distressed, softened in spite of herself.</p>
                  <p>"Get up, Miss Catheron," she said, "you must not kneel to me. What is it you
                     want? what is it you ask me to do?"</p>
                  <p>"I ask you to give up this life of toil—to come home with me. Lady Helena
                     awaits you. Make your home with her and with me—take the name and wealth that
                     are yours, and wait—try to wait patiently to the end. For Victor—poor,
                     heart-broken boy!—you will not have long to wait."</p>
                  <p>Her voice broke—her sobs filled the room. The distressed look was still on
                     Edith's face, but it was as resolute as ever.</p>
                  <p>"What you ask is impossible," she said; "utterly and absolutely impossible.
                     What you say about your cousin may be true. I don't understand—I never could
                     read riddles—but it does not alter my determination in the least. What! live on
                     the bounty of a man who deserts me on my wedding-day—who makes me an outcast—an
                     object of scorn and disgrace! I would die first! I would face starvation and
                     death in this great city. I know what I am saying. I would sweep a crossing
                     like that beggar in rags yonder; I would lie down and die in a ditch sooner.
                     Let me go, Miss Catheron, I beg of you; you only distress me unnecessarily. If
                     you pleaded forever it could not avail. Give my love to Lady Helena; but I will
                     never go back—I will never accept a farthing from Sir Victor Catheron. Don't
                     come here more—don't let <emph>him</emph> come." Again her eyes gleamed. "There
                     is neither sorrow nor pity for him in my heart. It is like a stone where he is
                     concerned, and always will be—always, though he lay dying before me. Now,
                     farewell."</p>
                  <p>Then the door opened and closed, and she was gone.</p>

                  <head type="sub">HOW THEY MET.</head>
                  <p>MISS STUART went back to the workroom, and to the dozen or more young women
                     there assembled. If she was a shade paler than her wont they were not likely to
                     notice it—if she was more silent even than usual, why silence was always Miss
                     Stuart's forte. Only the young person to whom Miss Catheron had given the
                     sovereign looked at her curiously, and said point blank:</p>
                  <p>"I say, Miss Stuart, who was that? what did she want?" And the dark, haughty
                     eyes of Miss Stuart had lifted from the peach satin on which she worked, and
                     fixed themselves icily upon her interrogator:</p>
                  <p>"It was a lady I never saw before," she answered frigidly. "What she wanted is
                     certainly no business of yours, Miss Hatton."</p>
                  <p>Miss Hatton flounced off with a muttered reply; but there was that about Edith
                     that saved her from open insult—a dignity and distance they none of them could
                     overreach. Besides, she was a favorite with madame and the forewoman. So
                     silently industrious, so tastefully neat, so perfectly trustworthy in her work.
                     Her companions disliked and distrusted her; she held herself aloof from them
                     all; she had something on her mind—there was an air of mystery about her; they
                     doubted her being an English girl at all. She would have none of their
                     companionship; if she had a secret she kept it well; in their noisy, busy midst
                     she was as much alone as though she were on Robinson Crusoe's desert island.
                     Outwardly those ten months had<pb n="342-343" xml:id="VAC6448-00000171"/>
                     changed her little—her brilliant, dusk beauty was scarcely dimmed—inwardly it
                     had changed her greatly, and hardly for the better.</p>
                  <p>There had been a long and bitter struggle before she found herself in this safe
                     haven. For months she had drifted about without rudder, or compass, or pilot,
                     on the dark, turbid sea of London. She had come to the great city friendless
                     and alone, with very little money, and very little knowledge of city life. She
                     had found lodgings easily enough, cheap and clean, and had at once set about
                     searching for work. On the way up she had decided what she must do—she would
                     become a nursery governess or companion to some elderly lady, or she would
                     teach music. But it was one thing to resolve, another to do. There were dozens
                     of nursery governesses and companions to old ladies wanting in the columns of
                     the <title>Times</title>, but they were not for her. "Where are your
                     references?" was the terrible question that met her at every turn. She had no
                     references, and the doors of the genteel second and third-rate houses shut
                     quietly in her face.</p>
                  <p>Young and pretty, without references, money or friends, how was she ever to
                     succeed? If she had been thirty and pock-marked she might have triumphed even
                     over the reference business: as it was, her case seemed hopeless. It was long,
                     however, before her indomitable spirit would yield. Her money ran low, she
                     pawned several articles of jewelry and dress to pay for food and lodging. She
                     grew wan and hollow-eyed in this terrible time—all her life long she could
                     never recall it without a shudder.</p>
                  <p>Five months passed; despair, black and awful, filled her soul at last. The
                     choice seemed to lie between going out as an ordinary servant and starving.
                     Even as a housemaid she would want this not-to-be-got-over reference. In this
                     darkest-hour before the dawn she saw Madame Mirebeau's advertisement for sewing
                     girls, and in sheer despair applied. Tall, handsome girls of good address, were
                     just what madame required, and somehow—it was the mercy of the good God no
                     doubt—she was taken. For weeks after she was kept under close surveillance, she
                     was so very unlike the young women who filled such situations—then the
                     conviction became certainty that Miss Stuart had no sinister designs on the
                     ruby velvets, the snowy satins, and priceless laces of her aristocratic
                     customers—that she really wanted work and was thoroughly capable of doing it.
                     Nature had made Edith an artist in dressmaking; her taste was excellent; madame
                     became convinced she had found a treasure. Only one thing Miss Stuart
                     steadfastly refused to do—that was to wait in the shop. "I have reasons of my
                     own for keeping perfectly quiet," she said, looking madame unflinchingly in the
                     eyes. "If I stay in the shop I may—though it is not likely—be recognized; and
                     then I should be under the necessity of leaving you immediately."</p>
                  <p>Madame had no wish to lose her very best seamstress, so Miss Stuart had her
                     way. The sentimental Frenchwoman's own idea was that Miss Stuart was a young
                     person of rank and position, who owing to some ill-starred love affair had been
                     obliged to run away and hide herself from her friends. However as her hopeless
                     passion in no way interfered with her dressmaking ability, madame kept her
                     suspicions to herself and retained her in the workroom.</p>
                  <p>And so after weary months of pain, and shame, and despair, Edith had come
                     safely to land at last. For the past five months her life had flowed along
                     smoothly, dully, uneventfully—going to her work in the morning, returning to
                     her lodgings at night—sometimes indulging in a short walk in the summer
                     twilight after her tea; at other times too wearied out in body and mind to do
                     other than lie down on the little hard bed, and sleep the spent sleep of
                     exhaustion. That was her outer life; of her inner life what shall I say? She
                     could hardly have told in the after days herself. Somehow strength is given us
                     to bear all things and live on. Of the man she had married she could not, dare
                     not think—her heart and soul filled with such dark and deadly hatred. She
                     abhorred him,—it is not too much to say that. The packet of treasured letters
                     written in New York so long—oh, so long ago! it seemed—became the one spot of
                     sunshine in her sunless life. She read them until the words lost all
                     meaning—until she knew every one by heart. She looked at the picture until the
                     half-smiling eyes and lips seemed to mock her as she gazed. The little
                     turquoise broach with the likeness, she wore in her bosom night and<pb
                        n="344-345" xml:id="VAC6448-00000172"/> day—the first thing to be kissed in
                     the morning, the last at night. Wrong, wrong, wrong, you say; but the girl was
                     desperate and reckless—she did not care. Right and wrong were all confounded in
                     her warped mind; only this was clear—she loved Charley as she had never loved
                     him before she became Sir Victor Catheron's bride. He scorned and despised her;
                     she would never look upon his face again—it did not matter; she would go to her
                     grave loving him, his pictured face over her heart, his name the last upon her
                     lips.</p>
                  <p>Sometimes, sitting alone in the dingy London twilight, there rose before her a
                     vision of what might have been: Charley, poor as he was now, and she Charley's
                     wife, he working for her, somewhere and somehow, as she knew he gladly would,
                     she keeping their two or three tiny rooms in order, and waiting, with her best
                     dress on, as evening came, to hear his step at the door. She would think until
                     thought became torture, until thought became actual physical pain. His words,
                     spoken to her that last night she had ever spent at Sandypoint, came back to
                     her full of bitter meaning now: "Whatever the future brings, don't blame
                        <emph>me</emph>." The future had brought loneliness, and poverty, and
                     despair—all her own fault—her own fault. That was the bitterest sting of all—it
                     was her own work from first to last. She had dreaded poverty, she had bartered
                     her heart, her life, and him in her dread of it, and lo! such poverty as she
                     had never dreamed of had come upon her. If she had only been true to herself
                     and her own heart, what a happy creature she night have been to-day.</p>
                  <p>But these times of torture were mercifully rare. Her heart seemed numb—she
                     worked too hard to think much—at night she was too dead tired to spend the
                     hours in fruitless anguish and tears. Her life went on in a sort of treadmill
                     existence; and until the coming of Inez Catheron nothing had occurred to
                     disturb it.</p>
                  <p>Her heart was full of bitter tumult and revolt as she went back to her work.
                     The dastard! how dared he! He was dying, Inez Catheron had said, and for love
                     of her. Bah! she could have laughed in her bitter scorn,—what a mockery it was!
                     If it were true, why let him die! The sooner the better—then indeed she would
                     be free. Perhaps Edith had lost something—heart, conscience—in the pain and
                     shame of the past. All that was soft and forgiving in her nature seemed wholly
                     to have died out. He had wronged her beyond all reparation—the only reparation
                     he could make was to die and leave her free.</p>
                  <p>Madame's young women were detained half an hour later than usual that evening.
                     A great Belgravian ball came off next night, and there was a glut of work. They
                     got away at last, half fagged to death, only to find a dull drizzling rain
                     falling, and the murky darkness of early night settling down over the gas-lit
                     highways of London. Miss Stuart bade her companions a brief good-night, raised
                     her umbrella, and hurried on her way. She did not observe the waiting figure,
                     muffled from the rain and hidden by an umbrella, that had been watching for
                     her, and who instantly followed her steps. She hurried on rapidly and came at
                     last to a part of the street where it was necessary she should cross. She
                     paused an instant on the curbstone irresolute. Cabs, omnibuses and hansoms were
                     tearing by in numbers innumerable. It was a perilous passage. She waited two or
                     three minutes, but there was no lull in the rush. Then growing quite desperate
                     in her impatience she started to cross. The crossing was slippery and wet.</p>
                  <p>"I say! look out there, will you!" half a dozen shrill cabbies called, before
                     and behind.</p>
                  <p>She grew bewildered—her presence of mind deserted her—she dropped her umbrella
                     and held up her hands instinctively to keep them off. As she did so, two arms
                     grasped her, she felt herself absolutely lifted off her feet, and carried over.
                     But just as the curbstone was reached, something—a carriage pole it
                     appeared—struck her rescuer on the head, and felled him to the ground. As he
                     fell, Edith sprang lightly out of his arms, and stood on the pavement,
                     unhurt.</p>
                  <p>The man had fallen. It was all the driver of the hansom could do to keep his
                     horse from going over him. There was shouting and yelling and an uproar
                     directly. A crowd <choice>
                        <sic>surounded</sic>
                        <corr>surrounded</corr>

                        <corr/>
                     </choice> came up with his baton and authority. For Edith, she stood stunned
                     and bewildered still. She saw the man lifted and carried into a chemist's near
                     by. Instinctively she followed—it was in<pb n="346-347"
                        xml:id="VAC6448-00000173"/> saving <emph>her</emph> he had come to grief.
                     She saw him placed in a chair, the mire and blood washed off his face, and
                     then—was she stunned and stupefied still—or was it, <emph>was</emph> it the
                     face of Sir Victor Catheron?</p>
                  <p>It was—awfully bloodless, awfully corpse-like, awfully like the face of a dead
                     man; but the face of the man whose bride she had been ten months ago—the face
                     of Sir Victor Catheron.</p>
                  <p>She leaned heavily against the counter, feeling giddy and sick—the place
                     swimming around her. Was he dead? Had he met his death trying to save her?
                     "Blessed if I don't think he's dead and done for," said the chemist. "It aint,
                     such a bad cut neither. I say! does anybody know who he is?"</p>
                  <p>Nobody knew. Then the keen eyes of X 2001 fell upon Edith, pale and
                     wild-looking, with evident terror and recognition in her face.</p>
                  <p>"I say, miss, <emph>you</emph> know, don't you?" Bobby suggested politely. "It
                     was reskying you he got it, you know. You know this 'ere gent, don't you, miss!
                     Who is he?"</p>
                  <p>"He is Sir Victor Catheron."</p>
                  <p>"Oh," said Bobby. "Sir Wictor Catheron, is he? I thought he was a heavy swell."
                     And then his eyes took in Edith's very handsome face, and very plain dress, and
                     evident station, and he formed his own surmise. "Perhaps now, miss, you knows
                     too, where he ought to be took?"</p>
                  <p>"No," she answered mechanically; "I don't know. If you search his pockets, you
                     will most likely find his address. You—you, don't really think he is dead?"</p>
                  <p>She came a step nearer as she asked the question—her very lips colorless. An
                     hour ago it seemed to her she had almost wished for his death—now it seemed too
                     horrible. And to meet it saving her too,—after all her thoughts of him. She
                     felt as though she could never bear that.</p>
                  <p>"Well, no, miss, I don't think he is dead," the chemist answered, "though I
                     must say he looks uncommon like it. There's something more the matter with him
                     than this rap on the 'ead. Here's his card-case—now let's see: 'Sir Victor
                     Catheron, Bart. Fenton's 'Otel.' Fenton's 'Otel. Bobby, I say, let's horder a
                     cab and 'ave him driven there."</p>
                  <p>"Somebody ought to go with him," said X 2001. "I can't go—<emph>you</emph>
                     can't go. I don't suppose now, miss," looking very doubtfully at Edith,
                        "<emph>you</emph> could go nuther?"</p>
                  <p>"Is it necessary?" Edith asked, with very visible reluctance.</p>
                  <p>"Well, you see, miss, he looks uncommonly like a stiff 'un this minute, and if
                     he was to die by the way or hany-think, and him halone—"</p>
                  <p>"I will go," interposed Edith, turning away with a sick shudder. "Call the cab
                     at once."</p>
                  <p>A four-wheeler was summoned—the insensible young baronet was carried out and
                     laid, as comfortably as might be, on the back seat. Edith followed, unutterably
                     against her will, but how was she to help it? He was her worst enemy, but even
                     to one's worst enemy common humanity at times must be shown. It would be brutal
                     to let him go alone.</p>
                  <p>"Don't you be afraid, miss," the chemist said cheerfully; "he ain't dead
                        <emph>yet</emph>. He's only stunned like, and will come round all right
                     directly."</p>
                  <p>"Fenton's, Bill," and the cab rattled off.</p>

                  <head type="sub">HOW THEY PARTED.</head>
                  <p>THAT ride—all her life it came back to her like a bad nightmare. She kept her
                     eyes turned away as much as she could from that rigid form and ghastly face
                     opposite, but in spite of herself they would wander back. What Miss Catheron
                     had said was true then—he was dying—death was pictured in his face. What if,
                     after all, there was some secret strong enough to make his conduct in leaving
                     her right? She had thought it over and wondered and wondered, until her brain
                     was dazed, but could never hit on any solution. She could not now—it was
                        <emph>not</emph> right. Whatever the secret was, he had known it before he
                     married her—why had he not left her then—why in leaving her after had he not
                        explained?<pb n="348-349" xml:id="VAC6448-00000174"/> There was no excuse
                     for him, none, and in spite of the white, worn face that pleaded for him, her
                     heart hardened once more—hardened until she felt neither pity nor pain.</p>
                  <p>They reached the hotel. Jamison, the valet, came down, and recoiled at sight of
                     his master's long lost wife.</p>
                  <p>"My lady!" he faltered, staring as though he had seen a ghost.</p>
                  <p>"Your master has met with an accident, Jamison," Edith said calmly, ignoring
                     the title. How oddly it sounded to her. "You had better have him conveyed to
                     his room and send for a surgeon. And, if Lady Helena is in town—"</p>
                  <p>"Lady Helena is in town, my lady. Will—" Jamison hesitated, "will you not come
                     in, my lady, and wait until her ladyship comes?"</p>
                  <p>Again for a moment Edith hesitated and thought. It would be necessary for some
                     one to explain—she could not go away either without knowing whether the injury
                     he had received were fatal or not, since that injury was received in her
                     service. She set her lips and alighted.</p>
                  <p>"I will remain until Lady Helena arrives. Pray lose no time in sending for
                     her."</p>
                  <p>"I will send immediately, my lady," answered Jamison respectfully. "Thompson,"
                     to a waiter, "show this lady to a parlor at once."</p>
                  <p>And then Edith found herself following a gentlemanly sort of man in black, down
                     a long hall, up a great staircase, along a carpeted corridor, and into an
                     elegant private parlor. The man lit the gas and went, and then she was
                     alone.</p>
                  <p>She sat down to think. What a strange adventure it had been. She had wished for
                     her freedom—it seemed as though it were near at hand. She shuddered and shrank
                     from herself.</p>
                  <p>"What a wretch I am," she thought; "what a vile creature I must be. If he dies,
                     I shall feel as though I murdered him."</p>
                  <p>How long the hours and half hours, told off on the clock, seemed—eight, nine,
                     ten,—would Lady Helena never come? It was a long way to St. John's Wood, but
                     she might surely be here by this time. It was half past ten, and tired out
                     thinking, tired out with her day's work, she had fallen into a sort of uneasy
                     sleep and fitful dream in her chair when she suddenly became half conscious of
                     some one near her. She had been dreaming of Sandypoint, of quarrelling with her
                     cousin. "Don't Charley!" she said petulantly, aloud, and the sound of her own
                     voice awoke her fully. She started up, bewildered for a second, and found
                     herself face to face with Lady Helena. With Lady Helena, looking very pale and
                     sorrowful, with tear-wet eyes and cheeks.</p>
                  <p>She had been watching Edith for the past five minutes silently and sadly. The
                     girl's dream was pleasant, a half smile parted her lips. Then she had moved
                     restlessly. "Don't Charley?" she said distinctly and awoke.</p>
                  <p>It was of him then she was dreaming—thoughts of him had brought to her lips
                     that happy smile. The heart of the elder woman contracted with a sharp sense of
                     pain.</p>
                  <p>"Lady Helena!"</p>
                  <p>"Edith!"</p>
                  <p>She took the girl's hand in both her own and looked kindly at her. She had
                     liked her very much in the days gone by, though she had never wished her nephew
                     to marry her. And she could hardly blame her very greatly under the
                     circumstances, if her dreams were of the man she loved, not of the bridegroom
                     who had left her.</p>
                  <p>"I—I think I fell asleep," Edith said confusedly; "I was very tired, and it all
                     seemed so quiet and tedious here. How is <emph>he?</emph>"</p>
                  <p>"Better and asleep—they gave him an opiate. He knows nothing of your being
                     here. It was very good of you to come, my child."</p>
                  <p>"It was nothing more than a duty of common humanity. It was impossible to avoid
                     coming," Edith answered, and then briefly and rather coldly she narrated how
                     the accident had taken place.</p>
                  <p>"My poor boy!" was all Lady Helena said, but there was a heart sob in every
                     word; "he would die gladly to save you a moment's pain, and yet it has been his
                     bitter lot to inflict the worst pain of your life. My poor child, you can't
                     understand, and we can't explain—it must seem very hard and incomprehensible to
                     you, but one day you will know all, and you will do him justice at last. Ah,
                     Edith! if you had not refused Inez—if only you were not so proud, if you would
                     take what is your right and your due, he <emph>might</emph>
                     <pb n="350-351" xml:id="VAC6448-00000175"/> bear this separation until Heaven's
                     good time. As it is, it is killing him."</p>
                  <p>"He looks very ill," Edith said; "what is the matter with him?"</p>
                  <p>"Heart disease—brought on by mental suffering. No words can tell what he has
                     undergone since his most miserable wedding-day. It is known only to Heaven and
                     himself, but it has taken his life. As surely as ever human heart broke, his
                     broke on the day he left you. And you, my poor child—<emph>you</emph> have
                     suffered too."</p>
                  <p>"Of that we will not speak," the girl answered proudly; "what is done, is done,
                     For me, I hope the worst is over—I am safe and well, and in good health as you
                     see. I am glad Sir Victor Catheron has not met his death in my service. I have
                     only one wish regarding him, and that is that he will keep away from me. And
                     now, Lady Helena, before it grows any later, I will go home."</p>
                  <p>"Go home! At this hour? Most certainly you will not. You will remain here all
                     night. Oh, Edith, you must indeed. A room has been prepared for you, adjoining
                     mine. Inez and Jamison will remain with Victor until morning, and—you ought to
                     see him before you go."</p>
                  <p>She shrank in a sort of horror.</p>
                  <p>"No, no, no! <emph>that</emph> I cannot! As it is so late I will remain, but
                     see him—no, no! Not even for your sake, Lady Helena, can I do that."</p>
                  <p>"We will wait until to-morrow comes," was Lady Helena's response; "now you
                     shall go to your room at once."</p>
                  <p>She rang the bell, a chambermaid came. Lady Helena kissed the girl's pale cheek
                     affectionately, and Edith was led away to the room she was to occupy for that
                     night.</p>
                  <p>It was certainly a contrast in its size and luxurious appointments to that she
                     had used for the last ten months. She smiled a little as she glanced around.
                     And she was to spend the night under the same roof with Sir Victor Catheron. If
                     anyone had predicted it this morning, how scornfully she would have refused to
                     believe.</p>
                  <p>"Who can tell what a day may bring forth!" was Edith's last thought as she laid
                     her head on her pillow. "I am glad—very glad, that the accident will not prove
                     fatal. I don't want him or anyone else to come to his death through me."</p>
                  <p>She slept well and soundly, and awoke late. She sprang out of bed almost
                     instantly and dressed. She could but illy afford to lose a day. Before her
                     toilet was quite completed there was a tap at the door. She opened it and saw
                     Miss Catheron.</p>
                  <p>"I fancied you would be up early, and ordered breakfast accordingly. Aunt
                     Helena awaits you down stairs. How did you sleep?"</p>
                  <p>"Very well. And you—you were up all night I suppose?"</p>
                  <p>"Yes. I don't mind it at all, though—I am quite used to night watching. And I
                     have the reward of knowing Victor is much better—entirely out of danger indeed.
                     Edith," she laid her hands on the girl's shoulders and looked down into her
                     eyes, "he knows you are here. Will you be merciful to a dying man and see
                     him?"</p>
                  <p>She changed color and shrank a little, but she answered proudly and coldly:</p>
                  <p>"No good can come of it. It will be much better not, but for my own part I care
                     little. If he wishes to urge what you came to urge, I warn you, I will not
                     listen to a word; I will leave at once."</p>
                  <p>"He will not urge it. He knows how obdurate you are, how fruitless it would be.
                     Ah, Edith! you are a terribly haughty, self-willed girl. He will not detain you
                     a moment—he wishes to make but one parting request."</p>
                  <p>"I can grant nothing—nothing," Edith said with agitation.</p>
                  <p>"You will grant this, I think," the other answered sadly. "Come, dear child,
                     let us go down; Lady Helena waits."</p>
                  <p>They descended to breakfast; Edith ate little. In spite of herself, in spite of
                     her pride and self command, it shook her a little—the thought of speaking to
                        <emph>him</emph>.</p>
                  <p>But how was she to refuse? She rose at last, very pale, very stern and resolute
                     looking—the sooner it was over and she was gone, the better.</p>
                  <p>"Now," she said, "if you insist—"</p>
                  <p>"I do insist," answered Inez steadily. "Come."</p>
                  <p>She led her to a door down the corridor and rapped. How horribly thick and fast
                     Edith's heart beat; she hated herself for it. The door opened, and the grave,
                     professional face of Mr. Jamison looked out.</p>
                  <pb n="352-353" xml:id="VAC6448-00000176"/>
                  <p>"Tell Sir Victor, Lady Catheron is here, and will see him."</p>
                  <p>The man bowed and departed. Another instant and he was again before them:</p>
                  <p>"Sir Victor begs my lady to enter at once."</p>
                  <p>Then Inez Catheron took her in her arms and kissed her. It was her farewell.
                     She pointed forward and hurried away.</p>
                  <p>Edith went on. A door and curtain separated her from the inner room. She opened
                     one, lifted the other, and husband and wife were face to face.</p>
                  <p>He lay upon a low sofa—the room was partially darkened, but even in that
                     semi-darkness she could see that he looked quite as ghastly and bloodless this
                     morning as he had last night.</p>
                  <p>She paused about half way down the room and spoke: "You wished to see me, Sir
                     Victor Catheron?"</p>
                  <p>Cold and calm the formal words fell.</p>
                  <p>"Edith!"</p>
                  <p>His answer was a cry—a cry wrung from a soul full of love and anguish untold.
                     It struck home, even to <emph>her</emph> heart, steeled against him and all
                     feeling of pity.</p>
                  <p>"I am sorry to see you so ill. I am glad your accident is no worse." Again she
                     spoke, stiff, formal, commonplace words, that sounded horribly out of place,
                     even to herself.</p>
                  <p>"Edith," he repeated, and again no words can tell the pathos, the despair of
                     that cry, "forgive me—have pity on me. You hate me, and I deserve your hate,
                     but oh! if you knew, even you would have mercy and relent!"</p>
                  <p>He touched her in spite of herself. Even a heart of stone might have softened
                     at the sound of that despairing, heart-wrung voice—at sight of that death-like,
                     tortured face. And Edith's, whatever she might say or think, was not a heart of
                     stone.</p>
                  <p>"I do pity you," she said very gently; "I never thought to—but from my soul I
                     do. But, forgive you! No, Sir Victor Catheron; I am only mortal. I have been
                     wronged and humiliated as no girl was ever wronged and humiliated before. I
                     can't do that."</p>
                  <p>He covered his face with his hands—she could hear the dry sobbing sound of his
                     wordless misery.</p>
                  <p>"It would have been better if I had not come here," she said still gently. "You
                     are ill, and this excitement will make you worse. But they insisted upon
                     it—they said you had a request to make. I think you had better not make it—I
                     can grant nothing—nothing."</p>
                  <p>"You will grant this," he answered, lifting his face and using the words Inez
                     had used; "it is only that when I am dying, and send for you on my death-bed,
                     you will come to me. Before I die I must tell you all—the terrible secret; I
                     dare not tell you in life; and then, oh surely, surely you will pity and
                     forgive! Edith, my love, my darling, leave me this one hope, give me this one
                     promise before you go?"</p>
                  <p>"I promise to come," was her answer; "I promise to listen—I can promise no
                     more. A week ago I thought I would have died sooner than pledge myself to that
                     much—sooner than look in your face, or speak to you one word. And now, Sir
                     Victor Catheron, farewell."</p>
                  <p>She turned to go without waiting for his reply. As she opened the door, she
                     heard a wailing cry that struck chill with pity and terror to her inmost
                     heart.</p>
                  <p>"Oh, my love! my bride! my wife!"—then the door closed behind her—she heard and
                     saw no more.</p>
                  <p>So they had met and parted, and only death could bring them together again.</p>
                  <p>She passed out into the sunshine and splendor of the summer morning, dazed and
                     cold, her whole soul full of untold compassion for the man she had left.</p>

                  <head type="sub">THE TELLING OF THE SECRET.</head>
                  <p>EDITH went back to the work-room in Oxford Street, to the old treadmill life of
                     ceaseless sewing, and once more a lull came into her disturbed existence—the
                     lull preceding the last-ending of this strange mystery that had wrecked two
                     lives. It seemed to her as she sat down among madame's troop of noisy,
                     chattering girls, as though last night and its events were a long way off and a
                     figment of some strange dream. That she<pb n="354-355"
                        xml:id="VAC6448-00000177"/> had stood face to face with Sir Victor Catheron,
                     spent a night under the same roof, actually spoken to him, actually felt sorry
                     for him, was too unreal to be true. They had said rightly when they told her
                     death was pictured on his face. Whatever this secret of his might be, it was a
                     secret that had cost him his life. A hundred times a day that pallid, tortured
                     face, rose before her, that last agonized cry of a strong heart in strong agony
                     rang in her ears. All her hatred, all her revengeful thoughts of him were
                     gone—she understood no better than before, but she pitied him from the depths
                     of her heart.</p>
                  <p>They disturbed her no more, neither by letters nor visits. Only as the weeks
                     went by she noticed <emph>this</emph>—that as surely as evening came, a shadowy
                     figure hovering aloof, followed her home. She knew who it was—at first she felt
                     inclined to resent it, but as he never came near, never spoke, only followed
                     her from that safe distance, she grew reconciled and accustomed to it at last.
                     She understood his motive—to shield her—to protect her from danger and insult,
                     thinking himself unobserved.</p>
                  <p>Once or twice she caught a fleeting glimpse of his face on these occasions.</p>
                  <p>What a corpse-like face it was—how utterly weak and worn-out he seemed—more
                     fitted for a sick-bed than the role of protector. "Poor fellow," Edith thought
                     often, her heart growing very gentle with pity and wonder, "how he loves me,
                     how faithful he is after all. Oh, I wonder—I wonder, <emph>what</emph> this
                     secret is that took him from me a year ago. Will his mountain turn into a
                     mole-hill when I hear it, if I ever do, or will it justify him? Is he sane or
                     mad? And yet Lady Helena, who is in her right mind, surely, holds him justified
                     in what he has done."</p>
                  <p>July—August passed—the middle of September came. All this time, whatever the
                     weather, she never once missed her "shadow" from his post. As we grow
                     accustomed to all things, she grew accustomed to this watchful care, grew to
                     look for him when the day's work was done. But in the middle of September she
                     missed him. Evening after evening came, and she returned home unfollowed and
                     alone. Something had happened.</p>
                  <p>Yes, something had happened. He had never really held up his head after that
                     second parting with Edith. For days he had lain prostrate, so near to death
                     that they thought death surely must come. But by the end of a week he was
                     better—as much better at least as he ever would be in this world.</p>
                  <p>"Victor," his aunt would cry out, "I wish—I <emph>wish</emph> you would consult
                     a physician about this affection of the heart. I am frightened for you—it is
                     not like anything else. There is this famous German—do go to see him to please
                     me."</p>
                  <p>"To please you, my dear aunt—my good, patient nurse—I would do much," her
                     nephew was wont to answer with a smile. "Believe me your fears are groundless,
                     however. Death takes the hopeful and happy, and passes by such wretches as I
                     am. It all comes of weakness of body and depression of mind; there's nothing
                     serious the matter. If I get worse, you may depend upon it, I'll go and consult
                     Herr Von Werter."</p>
                  <p>Then it was that he began his nightly duty—the one joy left in his joyless
                     life. Lady Helena and Inez returned to St. John's Wood. And Sir Victor, from
                     his lodgings in Fenton's Hotel, followed his wife home every evening. It was
                     his first thought when he arose in the morning, the one hope that upheld him
                     all the long, weary, aimless day—the one wild delight that was like a spasm,
                     half pain, half joy—when the dusk fell to see her slender figure come forth, to
                     follow his darling, himself unseen, as he fancied, to her humble home. To watch
                     near it, to look up at her lighted windows with eyes full of such love and
                     longing as no words can ever picture, and then, shivering in the rising night
                     wind, to hail a hansom and go home—to live only in the thought of another
                     meeting on the morrow.</p>
                  <p>Whatever the weather, it has been said, he went. On many occasions he returned
                     drenched through, with chattering teeth and livid lips. Then would follow long,
                     fever-tossed, sleepless nights, and a morning of utter prostration, mental and
                     physical.</p>
                  <p>But come what might, while he was able to stand, he must return to his post—to
                     his wife.</p>
                  <p>But Nature, defied long, claimed her penalty at last. There came a day when Sir
                     Victor could rise from his bed no more, when the heart spasms, in their
                     anguish, grew<pb n="356-357" xml:id="VAC6448-00000178"/> even more than his
                     resolute will could bear. A day when in dire alarm Lady Helena and Inez were
                     once more summoned by faithful Jamison, and when at last—at last the infallible
                     German doctor was sent for.</p>
                  <p>The interview between physician and patient was long and strictly private. When
                     Herr Von Werter went away at last his phlegmatic Teuton face was set with an
                     unwonted expression of pity and pain. After an interval of almost unendurable
                     suspense, Lady Helena was sent for by her nephew, to be told the result. He lay
                     upon a low sofa, wheeled near the window. The last light of the September day
                     streamed in and fell full upon his face—perhaps that was what glorified it and
                     gave it such a radiant look. A faint smile lingered on his lips, his eyes had a
                     far-off, dreamy look, and were fixed on the rosy evening sky. A strange,
                     unearthly, exalted look altogether, that made his aunt's heart sink like
                     stone.</p>
                  <p>"Well?" She said it in a tense sort of whisper, longing for, yet dreading, the
                     reply. He turned to her, that smile still on his lips, still in his eyes. He
                     had not looked so well for months. He took her hand.</p>
                  <p>"Aunt," he said, "you have heard of doomed men sentenced to death receiving
                     their reprieve at the last hour? I think I know to-day how those men must feel.
                     My reprieve has come."</p>
                  <p>"Victor!" It was a gasp. "Dr. Von Werter says you will recover!"</p>
                  <p>His eyes turned from her to that radiant brightness in the September sky.</p>
                  <p>"It is aneurism of the heart. Dr. Von Werter says I won't live three
                     weeks."</p>
                  <milestone n="* * * * * * *" unit="typography"/>
                  <p>They were down in Cheshire. They had taken him home while there was yet time,
                     by slow and easy stages. They took him to Catheron Royals—it was his wish, and
                     they lived but to gratify his wishes now.</p>
                  <p>The grand old house was as it had been left a year ago—fitted up resplendently
                     for a bride—a bride who had never come. There was one particular room to which
                     he desired to be taken, a spacious and sumptuous chamber, all purple and
                     gilding, and there they laid him upon the bed, from which he would never
                     rise.</p>
                  <p>It was the close of September now, the days golden and mellow, beautiful with
                     the rich beauty of early autumn, before decay has come. He had grown rapidly
                     worse since that memorable interview with the German doctor, and paralysis,
                     that "death in life" was preceding the fatal footsteps of aneurism of the
                     heart. His lower limbs were paralyzed. The end was very near now. On the last
                     day of September Herr Von Werter paid his last visit.</p>
                  <p>"It's of no use, madame," he said to Lady Helena; "I can do nothing—nothing
                     whatever. He won't last the week out."</p>
                  <p>The young baronet turned his serene eyes, serene at last with the awful
                     serenity that precedes the end. He had heard the fiat not intended for his
                     ears.</p>
                  <p>"You are sure of this, doctor? <emph>Sure</emph>, mind! I won't last the week
                     out?"</p>
                  <p>"It is impossible, Sir Victor. I always tell my patients the truth. Your
                     disease is beyond the reach of all earthly skill. The end may come at any
                     moment—in no case can you survive the week."</p>
                  <p>His serene face did not change. He turned to his aunt with a smile that was
                     often on his lips now:</p>
                  <p>"At last," he said softly; "at last my darling may come to me—at last I may
                     tell her all. Thank God for this hour of release. Aunt Helena, send for Edith
                     at once."</p>
                  <p>By the night train, a few hours later, Inez Catheron went up to London. As
                     Madame Mirebeau's young women assembled next morning, she was there before
                     them, waiting to see Miss Stuart.</p>
                  <p>Edith came—a foreknowledge of the truth in her mind. The interview was brief.
                     She left at once in company with Miss Catheron, and Madame Mirebeau's
                     establishment was to know her no more.</p>
                  <p>As the short, autumnal day closed in, they were in Cheshire.</p>
                  <p>It was the evening of the second of October—the anniversary of the bridal eve.
                     And thus at last the bride was coming home. She looked out with eyes that saw
                     nothing of the familiar landscape as it flitted by—the places she had<pb
                        n="358-359" xml:id="VAC6448-00000179"/> never thought to see more. She was
                     going to Catheron Royals, to the man she had married a year ago. A year ago!
                     what a strange, terrible year it had been—like a bad dream. She shuddered as
                     she recalled it. All was to be told at last, and death was to set all things
                     even. The bride was returning to the bridegroom like this.</p>
                  <p>All the way from the station to the great house she never spoke a word. Her
                     heart beat with a dull, heavy pain—pity for him—dread of what she was to hear.
                     It was quite dark when they rolled through the lofty gates, up the broad,
                     tree-shaded drive, to the grand portico entrance of the house.</p>
                  <p>"He is very low this evening, miss," Jamison whispered as he admitted them;
                     "feverish and longing for her ladyship's coming. He begs that as soon as my
                     lady is rested and has had some refreshment she will come to him at once."</p>
                  <p>Lady Helena met them at the head of the stairs, and took the pale, tired girl
                     in her arms for a moment. Then Edith was in a firelit, waxlit room, lying back
                     for a minute's rest in the downy depths of a great chair. Then coffee and a
                     dainty repast was brought her. She bathed her face and hands, and tried to eat
                     and drink. But the food seemed to choke her. She drank the strong, black coffee
                     eagerly, and was ready to go.</p>
                  <p>Lady Helena led her to the room where he lay—that purple and gold chamber, with
                     all its dainty and luxurious appointments. She shrank a little as she
                     entered—she remembered it was to have been <emph>their</emph> room when they
                     returned from their bridal tour. Lady Helena just opened the door to admit her,
                     closed it again, and was gone.</p>
                  <p>She was alone with the dying man. By the dim light of two wax tapers she beheld
                     him propped up with pillows, his white, eager face turned toward her, the love,
                     that not death itself could for a moment vanquish, shining upon her from his
                     eyes. She was over kneeling by the bedside, holding his hands in hers—how, she
                     could never have told.</p>
                  <p>"I am sorry—I am sorry!" It was all she could say. In that hour, in the
                     presence of death, she forgot everything, her wrongs, her humiliation. She only
                     knew that he was dying, and that he loved her as she would never be loved again
                     in this world.</p>
                  <p>"It is better as it is," she heard him saying, when she could hear at all, for
                     the dull, rushing sound in her ears; "far better—far better. My life was
                     torture—could never have been anything else, though I lived fifty years. I was
                     so young—life looked so long, that there were times, yes, Edith, times when for
                     hours I sat debating within myself a suicide's cowardly end. But Heaven has
                     saved me from that. Death has mercifully come of itself to set all things
                     straight, and oh, my darling! to bring <emph>you</emph>."</p>
                  <p>She laid her face upon his wasted hand, nearer loving him in his death than she
                     had ever been in his life.</p>
                  <p>"You have suffered," he said tenderly, looking at her. "I thought to shield you
                     from every care, to make your life one long dream of pleasure and happiness,
                     and see how I have done it! You have hated me—scorned me, and with justice; how
                     could it be otherwise? Even when you hear all, you may not be able to forgive
                     me, and yet, Heaven knows, I did it all for the best. If it were all to come
                     over again, I could not act otherwise than as I have acted. But, my darling, it
                     was very hard on you."</p>
                  <p>In death as in life his thoughts were not of himself and his own sufferings,
                     but of her. As she looked at him, as she recalled what he had been only a year
                     ago, in the flush and vigor and prime of manhood—it seemed almost too much to
                     bear.</p>
                  <p>"Oh, Victor! hush," she cried, hiding her face again, "you break my heart!"</p>
                  <p>His feeble fingers closed over hers with all their dying strength—that faint,
                     happy smile came over his lips.</p>
                  <p>"I don't want to distress you," he said very gently; "you have suffered enough
                     without that. Edith, I feel wonderfully happy to-night—it seems to me I have no
                     wish left—as though I were sure of your forgiveness beforehand. It is joy
                     enough to see you here—to feel your hand in mine once more, to know I am at
                     liberty to tell you the truth at last. I have longed for this hour with a
                     longing I can never describe. Only to be forgiven and die—I wanted no more. For
                     what would life have been without you? My dearest, I wonder if in the dark days
                     that are gone, whatever you may have doubted, my honor, my sanity, if you ever
                     doubted my love for you?"</p>
                  <pb n="360-361" xml:id="VAC6448-00000180"/>
                  <p>"I don't know," she answered, in a stifled voice. "My thoughts have been very
                     dark—very desperate. There were times when there seemed no light on earth, no
                     hope in Heaven. I dare not tell you—I dare not think—how wicked and reckless my
                     heart has been."</p>
                  <p>"Poor child!" he said, with a touch of infinite compassion. "You were so
                     young—it was all so sudden, so terrible, so incomprehensible. Draw up that
                     hassock, Edith, and sit here by my side, and listen. No, you must let go my
                     hand. How can I tell whether you will not shrink from it and me with horror
                     when you know all."</p>
                  <p>Without a word, she drew the low seat close to the bed, and shading her face
                     with her hand, listened, motionless as a statue, to the brief story of the
                     secret that had held them apart so long.</p>
                  <p>"It all begins," Sir Victor's faint, low voice said, "with the night of my
                     father's death, three weeks before our wedding-day. That night I learned the
                     secret of my mother's murder, and learned to pity my unhappy father as I had
                     never pitied him before. Do you remember, Edith, the words you spoke to Lady
                     Helena the day before you ran away from Powyss Place? You said Inez Catheron
                     was not the murderer, though she had been accused of it, nor Juan Catheron,
                     though he had been suspected of it—that you believed Sir Victor Catheron had
                     killed his own wife. Edith, you were right. Sir Victor Catheron murdered his
                     own wife!</p>
                  <p>"I learned it that fatal night. Lady Helena and Inez had known it all along.
                     Juan Catheron more than suspected it. Bad as he was, he kept that secret. My
                     mother was stabbed by my father's hand.</p>
                  <p>"Why did he do it? you ask. I answer, because he was mad—mad for weeks before.
                     And he knew it, though no one else did. With the cunning of insanity he kept
                     his secret, not even his wife suspected that his reason was unsound. He was a
                     monomaniac. Insanity, as you have heard, is hereditary in our family, in
                     different phases; the phase it took with him was homicidal mania. On all other
                     points he was sane—on this, almost from the first, he had been insane—<emph>the
                        desire to take his wife's life</emph>.</p>
                  <p>"It is horrible, is it not—almost incredibly horrible? It is true,
                     nevertheless. Before the honeymoon was ended, his homicidal mania developed
                     itself—an almost insurmountable desire, whenever he was alone in her presence,
                     to take her life. Out of the very depth and intensity of his passion for her
                     his madness arose. He loved her with the whole strength of his heart and being,
                     and the mad longing was with him always, to end her life while she was all his
                     own—in short, to kill her.</p>
                  <p>"He could not help it; he knew his madness—he shrank in horror from it—he
                     battled with it—he prayed for help—and for over a year he controlled himself.
                     But it was always there—always. How long it might have lain dormant—how long he
                     would have been able to withstand his mad desire, no one can tell. But Juan
                     Catheron came and claimed her as his wife, and jealousy finished what a
                     dreadful hereditary insanity had begun.</p>
                  <p>"On that fatal evening he had seen them together somewhere in the grounds, and
                     though he hid what he felt, the sight had goaded him almost to frenzy. Then
                     came the summons from Lady Helena to go to Powyss Place. He set out, but before
                     he had gone half-way, the demon of jealously whispered in his ear, 'Your wife
                     is with Juan Catheron now—go back and surprise them.' He turned and went back—a
                     madman—the last glimpse of reason and self-control gone. He saw his wife, not
                     with Juan Catheron, but peacefully and innocently asleep by the open window of
                     the room where he had left her. The dagger, used as a paper knife, lay on the
                     table near. I say he was utterly mad for the time. In a moment the knife was up
                     to the hilt in her heart, dealing death with that one strong blow! He drew it
                     out and—she lay dead before him.</p>
                  <p>"Then a great, an awful horror, fell upon him. Not of the consequence of his
                     crime; only of that which lay so still and white before him. He turned like the
                     madman he was and fled. By some strange chance he met no one. In passing
                     through the gates he flung the dagger among the fern, leaped on his horse, and
                     was gone.</p>
                  <p>"He rode straight to Powyss Place. Before he reached it some of insanity's
                     cunning returned to him. He must not let people know <emph>he</emph> had done
                     it; they would find out he was mad; they would shut him up in a madhouse;
                        they<pb n="362-363" xml:id="VAC6448-00000181"/> would shrink from him in
                     loathing and horror. How he managed it, he told me with his dying breath, he
                     never knew—he did somehow. No one suspected him, only Inez Catheron, returning
                     to the nursery, had seen all-had seen the deadly blow struck, had seen his
                     instant flight, and stood spell-bound, speechless and motionless as a stone. He
                     remembered no more—the dark night of oblivion and total insanity closed about
                     him only to open at briefest intervals from that to the hour of his death.</p>
                  <p>"That, Edith, was the awful story I was told that night—the story that has
                     ruined and wrecked my whole life and yours. I listened to it all as you sit and
                     listen now, still as a stone, frozen with a horror too intense for words. I can
                     recall as clearly now as the moment I heard them the last words he ever spoke
                     to me:</p>
                  <p>"'I tell you this partly because I am dying, and I think you ought to know,
                     partly because I want to warn you. They tell me you are about to be married.
                     Victor, beware what you do. The dreadful taint is in your blood as it was in
                     mine—you love her as I loved the wife I murdered. Again I say take care—take
                     care! Be warned by me; my fate may be yours, your mother's fate hers. It is my
                     wish, I would say command, if I dared, that you never marry; that you let the
                     name and the curse die out; that no more sons may be born to hear the ghastly
                     story I have told you.'</p>
                  <p>"I could listen to no more, I rushed from the room, from the house, out into
                     the darkness and the rain, as if the curse he spoke of had already come upon
                     me—as though I were already going mad. How long I remained, what I did, I don't
                     know. Soul and body seemed in a whirl. The next thing I knew was my aunt
                     summoning me into the house. My most miserable father was dead.</p>
                  <p>"Then came the funeral. I would not, <emph>could not</emph> think. I drove the
                     last warning he had spoken out of my mind. I clenched my teeth—I swore that I
                     would <emph>not</emph> give you up. Not for the raving of a thousand madmen,
                     not for the warning of a thousand dying fathers. From that hour I was a changed
                     man—from that hour my doom was sealed.</p>
                  <p>"I returned to Powyss Place, but not as I had left. I was a haunted man. By day
                     and night—all night long, all day through, the awful warning pursued me. 'My
                     fate may be yours—your mother's fate <emph>hers!</emph>' It was my destiny,
                     there was no escape; my mother's doom would be yours; on our wedding-day I was
                     fated to kill you! It was written. Nothing could avert it.</p>
                  <p>"I don't know whether the family taint was always latent within me, or that it
                     was continual brooding on what I had heard, but the fate certainly befell me.
                     My father's homicidal mania became mine. Edith, I felt it, felt the dreadful
                     whisper in my ear, the awful desire stirring in my heart, to lift my hand and
                     take your life! Often and often have I fled from your presence when I felt the
                     temptation growing stronger than I could withstand.</p>
                  <p>"And yet I would not give you up; that is where I can never forgive myself. I
                     could not tell you; I could not draw back then. I hoped against hope; it seemed
                     like tearing body and soul asunder, the thought of losing you. 'Come what may,'
                     I cried, in my anguish, 'she shall be my wife!'</p>
                  <p>"Our wedding-day came; the day that should have been the most blessed of my
                     life, that was the most miserable. All the night before, all that morning, the
                     demon within me had been battling for the victory. I could not exorcise it; it
                     stood between us at the altar. Then came our silent, strange wedding-journey. I
                     wonder sometimes, as I looked at you, so still, so pale, so beautiful, what you
                     must think. I dare not look at you often, I dare not speak to you, dare not
                     think of you. I felt if I did I should lose all control of myself, and slay you
                     there and then.</p>
                  <p>"I wonder, as you sit and listen there, my love, my bride, whether it is pity
                     or loathing that fills your heart. And yet I deserved pity; what I suffered no
                     tongue can ever tell. I knew myself mad, knew that sooner or later my madness
                     would be stronger than myself, and then it came upon me so forcibly when we
                     reached Carnarvon, that I fled from you again and went wandering away by
                     myself, where, I knew not. 'Sooner or later you will kill her;' that thought
                     alone filled me; 'it is as certain as that you live and stand here. You will
                     kill this girl who trusts you and who has married you, who does not dream she
                     has married a demon athirst for her blood.'</p>
                  <p>"I went wild then. I fell down on my knees in the wet grass, and held up my
                     hands to the sky. 'O God!' I<pb n="364-365" xml:id="VAC6448-00000182"/> cried
                     out in despair, 'show me what to do. Don't let me kill my darling. Strike me
                     dead where I kneel sooner than that!' And with the words the bitterness of
                     death seemed to pass, and great calm fell. In that calm a voice spoke clearly,
                     and said:</p>
                  <p>"Leave her! Leave your bride while there is yet time. It is the only way. Leave
                     her! She does not love you—she will not care. Better that you should break your
                     heart and die, than that you should harm a hair of her head.'</p>
                  <p>"I heard it as plainly, Edith, as I hear my own voice speaking now. I rose—my
                     resolution taken—a great, unutterable peace filling my heart. In my exalted
                     state it seemed so easy—I alone would be the sufferer, not you—I would go.</p>
                  <p>"I went back. The first sight I saw was you, my darling, sitting by the open
                     window, fast asleep. Fast asleep, as my mother had been that dreadful night. If
                     anything had been wanting to confirm my resolution, that would have done it. I
                     wrote the note of farewell; I came in and kissed your dear hands, and went away
                     from you forever. O love! it seemed easy then, but my heart broke in that hour.
                     I could not live without you; thank Heaven! the sacrifice is not asked. I have
                     told you all—it lay between two things—I must leave you, or in my madness kill
                     you. Edith, it would have happened. You have heard my story—you know all—the
                     dreadful secret that has held us asunder. It is for you to say whether I can be
                     forgiven or not."</p>
                  <p>She had all the time been sitting, her face hidden in her hands, never stirring
                     or speaking. Now she arose and fell once more on her knees beside him, tears
                     pouring from her eyes. She drew his head into her arms, she stooped down, and,
                     for the first time in her life, kissed again and again the lips of the man she
                     had married.</p>
                  <p>"Forgive you!" she said. "O my husband, my martyr! It is I who must be
                     forgiven! <emph>You</emph> are an angel, not a man!"</p>

                  <head type="sub">THE LAST ENDING OF THE TRAGEDY.</head>
                  <p>AN hour later, when Lady Helena softly opened the door and came in, she found
                     them still so, his weak head resting in her arms as she knelt, her bowed face
                     hidden, her falling tears hardly yet dried. One look into his radiant eyes,
                     into the unspeakable joy and peace of his face, told her the story. All had
                     been revealed, all had been forgiven. On the anniversary of their most
                     melancholy wedding-day husband and wife were reunited at last.</p>
                  <p>There was no need of words. She stooped over and silently kissed both.</p>
                  <p>"It is growing late, Edith," she said gently, "and you must be tired after your
                     journey. You will go up to your room now. I will watch with Victor
                     to-night."</p>
                  <p>But Edith only drew him closer, and looked up with dark, imploring eyes.</p>
                  <p>"No," she said, "no, no! I will never leave him again. I am not in the least
                     tired, Lady Helena; I will stay and share your watch."</p>
                  <p>"But, my dear—"</p>
                  <p>"O Lady Helena—aunt—don't you see—I must do something—make reparation in some
                     way. What a wretch—what a wretch I have been. Oh, why did I not know all
                     sooner? Victor, why did I not know <emph>you?</emph> To remember what my
                     thoughts of you have been, and all the time—all the time—it was for me. If you
                     die I shall feel as though I were your murderess."</p>
                  <p>Her voice choked in a tearless sob. She had hated him—loathed him—almost
                     wished, in her wickedness, for his death, and all the time he was yielding up
                     his life in his love for her.</p>
                  <p>"You will let me stay with you, Victor?" she pleaded almost passionately;
                     "don't ask me to go. We have been parted long enough; let me be with you
                     until—" again her voice choked and died away.</p>
                  <p>With a great effort he lifted one of her hands to his lips—that radiant smile
                     of great joy on his face.</p>
                  <pb n="366-367" xml:id="VAC6448-00000183"/>
                  <p>"She talks <emph>almost</emph> as if she loved me," he said.</p>
                  <p>"Love you! O Victor!—husband—if I had only known, if I had only known!"</p>
                  <p>"If you had known," he repeated, looking at her with wistful eyes. "Edith, if
                     you really had known—if I had dared to tell you all I have told you to-night,
                     would you not have shrunk from me in fear and horror, as a monster who
                     pretended to love you and yet longed for your life? Sane on all other
                     points—how would you have comprehended my strange madness on that? It is gone
                     now—thank God—in my weakness and dying hour, and there is nothing but the love
                     left. But my own, if I had told you, if you had known, would you not have
                     feared and left me?"</p>
                  <p>She looked at him with brave, steadfast, shining eyes.</p>
                  <p>"If I had known," she answered, "how your father killed your mother, how his
                     madness was yours, I would have pitied you with all my heart, and out of that
                     pity I would have loved you. I would never have left you—never. I could never
                     have feared you, Victor; and this I know—what you dreaded never would have come
                     to pass. I am as sure of it as that I kneel here. You would never have lifted
                     your hand against my life."</p>
                  <p>"You think so?" Still with that wistful, earnest gaze.</p>
                  <p>"I <emph>know</emph> so—I feel it—I am sure of it. You could not have done it—I
                     should never have been afraid of it, and in time your delusion would have worn
                     entirely away. You are naturally superstitious and excitable—morbid, even; the
                     dreadful excitement of your father's story and warning, were too much for you
                     to bear alone. That is all. If you could have told me—if I could have laughed
                     at your hypochrondical terrors, your cure would have been half effected. No,
                     Victor, I say it again—I would never have left you, and you would never have
                     harmed a hair of my head."</p>
                  <p>Her tone of resolute conviction seemed to bring conviction even to him. The
                     sad, wistful light deepened in his blue eyes.</p>
                  <p>"Then it has all been in vain," he said very sadly; "the suffering and the
                     sacrifice—all these miserable months of separation and pain."</p>
                  <p>Again Lady Helena advanced and interposed, this time with authority.</p>
                  <p>"It won't do," she said; "Edith you <emph>must</emph> go. All this talking and
                     excitement may end fatally. If you won't leave him he won't sleep a wink
                     to-night; and if he passes a sleepless night who is to answer for the
                     consequences? For his sake you must go. Victor tell her to go—she will obey
                     you."</p>
                  <p>She looked at him beseechingly, but he saw that Lady Helena was right, and that
                     Edith herself needed rest. It was easy to make one more sacrifice now, and send
                     her away.</p>
                  <p>"I am afraid Aunt Helena is right," he said faintly. "I must confess to feeling
                     exhausted, and I know you need a night's sleep, so that I may have you with me
                     all day to-morrow. For a few hours, dear love, let me send you away."</p>
                  <p>She rose at once with a parting caress, and made him comfortable among his
                     pillows.</p>
                  <p>"Good-night," she whispered. "Try to sleep, and be strong to talk to me
                     to-morrow. Oh!" she breathed as she turned away, "if the elixir of life were
                     only not a fable—if the days of miracles were not past, if he only might be
                     restored to us, how happy we all could be!"</p>
                  <p>Lady Helena heard her, and shook her head.</p>
                  <p>"It is too late for that," she said; "when suffering is prolonged beyond a
                     certain point there is but one remedy—death. If your miracle could take place
                     and he be restored, he has undergone too much ever to live on and be happy and
                     forget. There can only be one ending to such a year as he has passed, and that
                     ending is very near."</p>
                  <p>Edith went to her room—one of the exquisite suite that had been prepared for
                     her a year before. She was occupying it at last, but how differently from what
                     she had ever thought. She remembered this night twelve months so well, the
                     strange vigil in which she had spent in taking her farewell of those letters
                     and that picture, and waiting for her wedding-day to dawn.</p>
                  <p>To-night she slept, deeply and soundly, and awoke to find the October sun
                     shining brightly in. Was he still alive? It was her first thought. Death might
                     have come at any moment. She arose—slipped on a dressing gown, and rang the
                     bell.</p>
                  <pb n="368-369" xml:id="VAC6448-00000184"/>
                  <p>It was Inez who answered in person.</p>
                  <p>"I heard your bell," she said as she kissed her good-morning, "and I knew what
                     you wanted. Yes, he is still alive, but very weak and helpless this morning.
                     The excitement and joy of last night were almost too much for him. And he
                     remembers what anniversary this is."</p>
                  <p>Edith turned away—some of the bitterness, some of the pain of loss she knew he
                     was enduring filling her own heart.</p>
                  <p>"If I had only known! if I had only known!" was again her cry.</p>
                  <p>"If you had—if he had told—I believe with you all would have been well. But it
                     is too late to think of that—<emph>he</emph> believed differently. The terrible
                     secret of the father has wrought its terrible retribution upon the son. If he
                     had told you when he returned from Poplar Lodge, you would have been happy
                     together to-day. You are so strong—your mind so healthful—some of your strength
                     and courage would have been imparted to him. But it is too late now—all is
                     over—we have only to make him happy while he is left with us."</p>
                  <p>"Too late! too late!" Edith's heart echoed desolately. In those hours of his
                     death she was nearer loving her husband than perhaps she could ever have been
                     had he lived.</p>
                  <p>"I will send breakfast up here," said Inez, turning to go; "when you have
                     breakfasted, go to him at once. He is awake and waiting for you."</p>
                  <p>Edith made her toilet. Breakfast came; and, despite remorse and grief, when one
                     is nineteen one can eat. Then she hurried away to the sick-room.</p>
                  <p>He was lying much as she had left him, propped up among the pillows—his face
                     whiter than the linen and lace, whiter than snow. By daylight she saw fully the
                     ghastly change in him—saw that his fair hair was thickly strewn with gray, that
                     the awful, <choice>
                        <sic>indiscribable</sic>
                        <corr>indescribable</corr>
                     </choice> change that goes before was already on his face. His breathing was
                     labored and panting—he had suffered intensely with spasms of the heart all
                     night, sleeping none at all. This morning the paroxysms of pain had passed, but
                     he lay utterly worn and exhausted, the cold damp of infinite misery on his
                     brow, the chill of death already on hands and limbs. He lay before her, the
                     total wreck of the gallant, hopeful, handsome gentleman, whom only one year ago
                     she had married.</p>
                  <p>But the familiar smile she knew so well was on his lips and in his eyes as he
                     saw her. She could not speak for a moment as she looked at him—in silence she
                     took her place close by his side.</p>
                  <p>He was the first to break the silence, in a voice so faint as hardly to be more
                     than a whisper. "How had she slept—how did she feel? She looked pale, he
                     thought—surely she was not ill?"</p>
                  <p>"I?" she said bitterly. "O, no—I am never ill-nothing ever seems to hurt hard,
                     heartless people like me. It is the good and the generous who suffer. I have
                     the happy knack of making all who love me miserable, but my own health never
                     fails. I don't dare to ask you what sort of night you have had—I see it in your
                     face. My coming brings, as it always does, more ill than good."</p>
                  <p>"No," he said, almost with energy; "a hundred times no! Ah, love! your coming
                     has made me the happiest man on earth. I seem to have nothing left to wish for
                     now. As to the night—the spasms <emph>did</emph> trouble me, but I feel
                     deliciously easy and at rest this morning, and uncommonly happy. Edith, I
                     talked so much last evening I gave <emph>you</emph> no chance. I want you to
                     tell me now all about the year that has gone—all about yourself."</p>
                  <p>"There is so little to tell," she responded; "it was really humdrum and
                     uneventful. Nothing much happened to me; I looked for work and got it. Oh,
                     don't be distressed! it was easy, pleasant work enough, and I was much better
                     busy. I begin to believe plenty of hard work is a real blessing to
                     dissatisfied, restless people—you can't be very miserable when you are very
                     busy—you haven't time for luxuries. I got along very well, and never was ill an
                     hour."</p>
                  <p>"But, tell me," he persisted; "you don't know how I long to hear. Tell me all
                     about your life after—after—"</p>
                  <p>"Hush!" she interposed, holding his hands tight. "You were the sufferer, not I.
                     O my poor boy! I never was half worthy such a heart as yours. I am only
                     beginning to realize how selfish, and cruel and hard I have been. But, with
                     Heaven's help, I will try and be different from this day."</p>
                  <p>She told him the story of her life, from the time of her flight from Powyss
                     Place to the present, glossing over all<pb n="370-371"
                        xml:id="VAC6448-00000185"/> that was dark, making the most of all that was
                     bright. But he understood her—he knew how her pride had suffered and bled.</p>
                  <p>"I never thought of your going away," he said sadly. "I might have known you
                     better, but I did not—I was so sure you would have stayed, if not with Lady
                     Helena, then in some safe shelter; that you would have taken what was justly
                     yours. I was stunned when I first heard of your flight. I searched for you
                     everywhere—in America and all. Did you know I went to America, Edith?"</p>
                  <p>"Inez told me," she answered faintly.</p>
                  <p>"I could not find your father—I could not find the Stuarts. I must have been
                     very stupid somehow—I could find no one. Then arrived that day when I saw you
                     in the Oxford Street shop, when I tried to follow you home and could not. What
                     an evening it was! Then came my last desperate hope when I sent Inez to you and
                     failed. It seemed almost hardest to bear of all."</p>
                  <p>"If I had only known—if I had only known!" was still her cry.</p>
                  <p>"Yes, the trouble lay there. With your pride you could not act otherwise than
                     as you did. For you are very proud, my darling," with a smile. "Do you know
                     it?"</p>
                  <p>"Very proud—very heartless—very selfish," she answered brokenly. "Oh, no need
                     to tell me how base I have been!"</p>
                  <p>"Yet, I think I like you the better for your pride; and I foresee—yes, I
                     foresee, that one day you will be a happy woman, with as noble, and loving, and
                     generous a heart as ever beat. I understand you, it seems to me now, better
                     than you understand yourself. One day—it may be years from now—the happiness of
                     your life will come to you. Don't let pride stand between you and it then,
                     Edith. I hope that day may come—I pray for it. Lying in my grave, love, I think
                     I shall rest easier if I know <emph>you</emph> are happy on earth."</p>
                  <p>"Don't! don't!" she said; "I cannot bear it! Your goodness breaks my
                     heart."</p>
                  <p>"There is one thing I must ask, Edith," he resumed after a pause; "a last
                     favor. You will grant it, will you not?"</p>
                  <p>"Victor! is there anything I would <emph>not</emph> grant?"</p>
                  <p>"It is this, then—that when I am gone, you will take what is your right and
                     your due. This you must promise me; no more false pride—the widow of Sir Victor
                     Catheron must take what is hers. Juan Catheron is married to a Creole lady, and
                     living in the island of Martinique, a reformed man. He inherits the title and
                     Catheron Royals, with its income, as heir-at-law. For the rest you have your
                     jointure as my widow; and my grandmother's large fortune, which descended to
                     me, I have bequeathed to you in my will. So that when I leave you, my dearest,
                     I leave you safe from all pecuniary troubles. It is my last wish—nay, my last
                     command, that you take all without hesitation. You promise me this, Edith?"</p>
                  <p>"I promise," she answered lowly. She could not look at him—it seemed like the
                     Scriptural words, "heaping coals of fire on her head."</p>
                  <p>Then for a long time there was silence. He lay back among the pillows with
                     closed eyes, utterly exhausted, but looking very happy. The bitterness of death
                     was passed—a great peace had come. With the wife he loved beside him, her hand
                     clasped in his, he could go forth in peace, knowing that in her heart there was
                     nothing but affection and forgiveness—that one day, in the future, she would be
                     happy. In his death as in his life he was thoroughly unselfish. It brought no
                     pang to him now to feel that years after the grass grew over his grave she
                     would be the happy wife of a happier man. He talked little more; he dozed at
                     intervals during the day. Edith never left him for a moment. His aunt and
                     cousin shared her watch off and on all day. They could all see that the last
                     great change was near. Pain had left him—he was entirely at rest.</p>
                  <p>"Read to me, Edith," he said once as the day wore on. She took up a volume of
                     sermons that Lady Helena was fond of. She opened it, haphazard, and read. And
                     presently she came to this, reading of the crosses and trials and sorrows of
                     life: "And God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes, and there shall be no
                     more death; neither sorrow nor crying; neither shall there be any more
                     pain."</p>
                  <p>His eyes were fixed upon her with so radiant a light, so infinite a
                     thankfulness, that she could read no more. Her voice choked—she laid the book
                     down. Later, as the sunset<pb n="372-373" xml:id="VAC6448-00000186"/> set came
                     streaming in, he awoke from a long slumber, and looked at the glittering bars
                     of light lying on the carpet.</p>
                  <p>"Open the window, Edith," he said; "I want to see the sun set once more."</p>
                  <p>She obeyed. All flushed with rose light, and gold and amythist splendor, the
                     evening sky glowed like the very gates of paradise.</p>
                  <p>"It is beautiful," Edith said, but its untold beauty brought to her somehow a
                     sharp pang of pain.</p>
                  <p>"Beautiful!" he repeated in an ecstatic whisper. "O love! if earth is so
                     beautiful, what must Heaven be!"</p>
                  <p>Then she heard him softly repeat to himself the words she had read: "And God
                     shall wipe away all tears from their eyes, and there shall be no more death;
                     neither sorrow nor crying; neither shall there be any more pain." He drew a
                     long, long breath, like one who is very weary and sees rest near.</p>
                  <p>"Darling," he said, "how pale you are—white as a spirit. Go out for a little
                     into the air—don't mind leaving me. I feel sleepy again."</p>
                  <p>She kissed him and went. All her after life she was glad to remember their last
                     parting had been with a caress on her part, a happy smile on his. She descended
                     the steps leading from the window with unquestioning obedience, and passed out
                     into the rose and gold light of the sunset. She remained perhaps fifteen
                     minutes—certainly not more. The red light of the October sky was fast paling to
                     cold gray—the white October moon was rising. She went back. He still lay as she
                     had left him—his eyes were closed—she thought he was asleep. She bent over him,
                     close—closer—growing white almost as himself. And then she knew what it
                     was.</p>
                  <p>"And there shall be no more death; neither sorrow nor crying; neither shall
                     there be any more pain."</p>
                  <p>A cry rang through the room, the long, wailing cry of widowhood. She fell on
                     her knees by the bed. An hour after, the passing bell tolled sombrely through
                     the darkness from the steeple of Chesholm Church, telling all whom it might
                     concern that Sir Victor Catheron had gone home.</p>

                  <head>CHAPTER VII.</head>
                  <head type="sub">TWO YEARS AFTER.</head>
                  <p>ONE brilliant, August noonday a Cunard ship steamed gallantly down the Mersey
                     and out into the open sea.</p>
                  <p>There were a great number of passengers on board—every cabin, every berth, was
                     filled. Every country under Heaven, it seemed, was represented. After the first
                     two or three days out, after the first three or four times assembling around
                     the dinner-table and congregating on the sunny decks, people began to know all
                     about one another, to learn each other's names and histories.</p>
                  <p>There was one lady passenger who from the first excited a great deal of talk
                     and curiosity. A darkly handsome young lady in widow's weeds, who rather held
                     herself aloof from everybody, and who seemed all sufficient unto herself. A
                     young lady, pitifully young to wear that sombre dress and widow's cap,
                     remarkable anywhere for her beauty, and dignity, and grace. Who was she? as
                     with one voice all the gentlemen on board cried out that question the moment
                     they saw her first.</p>
                  <p>She was a lady of rank and title, an English lady, travelling with her two
                     servants—otherwise quite alone—the name on the passenger list was Lady
                     Catheron.</p>
                  <p>For the first two days that was all that could be ascertained—just enough to
                     whet curiosity to burning-point. Then in the solitude and seclusion of the
                     ladies' cabin the maid servant became confidential with one of the
                     stewardesses, and narrated, after the manner of maids, her mistress's history
                     as far as she knew it. The stewardess retailed it to the lady passengers, and
                     the lady passengers gave it at third hand to the gentlemen. This is what it
                     was:</p>
                  <p>Lady Catheron, young as she looked and was, had nevertheless been a widow for
                     two years. Her husband had been Sir Victor Catheron, of Cheshire, who had died
                     after the first year of married felicity, leaving an immensely rich widow.
                     Miserable Sir Victor! thought all the gentlemen.<pb n="374-375"
                        xml:id="VAC6448-00000187"/> She—Sarah Betts, the maid—had not known her
                     ladyship during the year of her married life, she had been engaged in London,
                     some months after my lady's bereavement, to travel with her on the continent.
                     My lady had travelled in company with her aunt, the Lady Helena Powyss, and her
                     cousin, a "Mrs. Victor." They had spent the best part of two years wandering
                     leisurely through every country in Europe, and now my lady was finishing her
                     tour of the world by coming to America—why, Betts did not know. Not many ladies
                     of rank came to America alone, Betts thought, but she had heard my lady was
                     American by birth. Everywhere my lady went she had been greatly
                     admired—gentlemen always raved about her, but she seemed as cold as marble,
                     very high and haughty, utterly indifferent to them all. She did not go into
                     society—she had been awfully fond of her late husband, and quite broken-hearted
                     at losing him so soon. That was Miss Betts' story, and like Sam Weller's
                     immortal valentine, was just enough to make them wish there was more.</p>
                  <p>For the man servant and <foreign xml:lang="FRA">avant courier</foreign> of my
                     lady, he was a genteel, dignified, taciturn gentleman, like an elderly duke in
                     difficulties, with whom it was impossible to take liberties or ask questions—a
                     sort of human oyster: who kept himself and his knowledge hermetically sealed
                     up. He told nothing, and they had to be contented with Betts' version.</p>
                  <p>So Lady Catheron became <emph>the</emph> lady of interest on board. Everybody
                     saw her on deck, her railway rug spread in the sunshine, her low wicker-work
                     chair placed upon it, a large umbrella unfurled over her head, reading or
                     gazing over the sea toward the land they were nearing. She made no
                     acquaintances, she was perfectly civil to everybody who spoke to her, friendly
                     to a degree with the children, and her smile was bright and sweet as the
                     sunshine itself. Her reticence could hardly be set down to pride. Before the
                     voyage was over she was many times forward among the steerage passengers,
                     leaving largesses behind her, and always followed by thanks and blessings when
                     she came away. Not pride, surely—the great dark fathomless eyes were wondrously
                     sweet and soft; the lips, that might once have been haughty and hard, tender
                     and gentle now, and yet there was a vague, intangible something about her, that
                     held all at arm's length, that let no one come one inch nearer than it was her
                     will they should come. Lady Catheron had been their interest from the first—she
                     was their <choice>

                        <corr>mystery</corr>
                     </choice> to the end.</p>
                  <p>Yes, it was Edith—Edith going home—home! well hardly that, perhaps; she was
                     going to see her father, at his urgent request. He had returned once more to
                     Sandypoint, he had been ailing lately, and he yearned to see his darling. His
                     letter reached her in Paris, and Edith crossed over at once, and came.</p>
                  <p>Was there in her heart any hope of seeing, as well, other friends? Hardly—and
                     yet, as America drew near and nearer, her heart beat with a hope and a
                     restlessness she could no more explain than I can. In Naples, six months ago,
                     she had met a party of Americans, and among them Mrs. Featherbrain, of
                     light-headed memory. Mrs. Featherbrain had recognized an old acquaintance in
                     Lady Catheron, and hailed her with effusion.</p>
                  <p>For Edith, she shrank away with the old feeling of dislike and repulsion, and
                     yet she listened to her chatter, too.</p>
                  <p>"How sad it was," said gay Mrs. Featherbrain, "about the poor, dear Stuarts.
                     That delightful Charley, too! ah! it was very sad. Did Lady Catheron correspond
                     with them? But of course she did, being a relative and everything."</p>
                  <p>"No," Edith answered, her pale face a shade paler than usual; "she had entirely
                     lost sight of them lately. She would be very glad to hear of them, though. Did
                     Mrs. Featherbrain know—"</p>
                  <p>"Oh, dear, no!" Mrs. Featherbrain answered; "I have lost sight of them
                     too—every one has. When people become poor and drop out of the world, as it
                     were, it is impossible to follow them up. She <emph>had</emph> heard, just
                     before their party started, that Trixy was about to be married, and that
                     Charley—poor Charley! was going to California to seek his fortune. But she knew
                     nothing positively, only that they were certainly not to be seen in New
                     York—that the places and people who had known them once, knew them no more."
                     That was all.</p>
                  <p>It could not be, then, that the hope of meeting them was in Edith's mind, and
                     yet, her whole soul yearned to meet them—to ask their forgiveness, if no more.
                     To clasp Trixy's hand once again,—honest, loving, impulsive, warm-hearted<pb
                        n="376-377" xml:id="VAC6448-00000188"/> Trixy,—to feel her arms about her as
                     of old, it seemed to Edith Catheron, she could have given half her life. Of any
                     other, she would not let herself think. He had passed out of her life forever
                     and ever—nothing could alter that.</p>
                  <p>"Everywhere she went, she was admired," her servants had said, "but to all she
                     was cold as marble." Yes, and it would always be so while life remained. There
                     had been but one man in all the world for her from the first—she had given him
                     up of her own free will; she must abide by her decision; but there never would
                     be any other. One loveless marriage she had made; she never would make another.
                     Charley Stuart might—would, beyond doubt—forget her and marry, but she would go
                     to her grave, her whole heart his.</p>
                  <p>They reached New York; and there were many kindly partings and cordial
                     farewells. Lady Catheron and her two servants drove away to an up-town hotel,
                     where rooms had been engaged, and all the papers duly chronicled the
                     distinguished arrival. One day to rest—then down to Sandypoint, leaving
                     gossiping Betts and the silent elderly gentle man behind her. And in the
                     twilight of an August day she entered Sandypoint, and walked slowly through the
                     little town, home. Only three years since she had left, a happy, hopeful girl
                     of eighteen—returning now a saddened, lonely woman of twenty-one. How strangely
                     altered the old landmarks, and yet how familiar. Here were the stores to which
                     she used to walk, sulky and discontented, through the rain, to do the family
                     marketing. Here spread the wide sea, smiling and placid, whereon she and
                     Charley used to sail. Yonder lay the marsh where, that winter night, she had
                     saved his life. Would it have been as well, she thought with weary wonder, if
                     they had both died that night? Here was the nook where he had come upon her
                     that wet, dark morning with his mother's letter, when her life seemed to
                     begin—here the gate where they had stood when he gave her his warning:
                     "Whatever that future brings, Edith, don't blame me." No, she blamed nobody but
                     herself; the happiness of her life had lain within her grasp, and she had
                     stretched forth her hand and pushed it away. There was the open window where he
                     used to sit, in the days of his convalesence, and amuse himself setting her
                     inflammable temper alight. It was all associated with him. Then the house door
                     opens, a tall, elderly man comes out, there is a great cry, father and daughter
                     meet, and for an hour or so, she can forget even Charley.</p>
                  <p>She remains a week—how oddly familiar and yet strange it all seems. The
                     children noisier and ruder than ever, her father grown grayer and more
                     wrinkled, her stepmother, shrill of tongue and acid of temper as of yore, but
                     fawningly obsequious to her.</p>
                  <p>The people who used to know her, and who flock to see her, the young men who
                     used to be in love with her, and who stare at her speechlessly and afar off
                     now. It amuses her for a while, then she tires of it, she tires of everything
                     of late, her old fever of restlessness comes back. This dull Sandypoint, with
                     its inquisitive gapers and questioners, is not to be endured, even for her
                     father's sake. She will return to New York.</p>
                  <p>In the bustling life there—the restless, ceaseless flow o humanity, she alone
                     finds solitude and rest now. She goes, but she leaves behind her that which
                     renders keeping boarders or teaching classics forever unnecessary to Frederick
                     Darrell.</p>
                  <p>She goes back. What her plans are for the future she does not know. She has no
                     plans, she cannot tell how long she may remain, or where she will eventually
                     take up her abode. It seems to her she will be a sort of feminine Wandering Jew
                     all her life. That life lacks something that renders her restless—she does not
                     care to think what. She may stay all winter—she may pack up and start any day
                     for England.</p>
                  <p>September passes, and she has not gone. A few of the acquaintances she made
                     when here before with the Stuarts call upon her, but they can tell her nothing
                     of them. If the Stuarts were all dead and buried they could not more completely
                     have dropped out of the lives of their summer-time friends. It must be true,
                     she thinks, what Mrs. Featherbrain told her. Trixy is married and settled
                     somewhere with her mother, and Charley is thousands of miles away, "seeking his
                     fortune."</p>
                  <p>Then, all at once, she resolves to go back to England. Her handsome jointure
                     house awaits her, Lady Helena and Inez long for her, love her—she will go back
                     to them—try<pb n="378-379" xml:id="VAC6448-00000189"/> to be at peace like
                     other women, try to live her life out and forget. She has some purchases to
                     make before she departs. She goes into a Broadway store one day, advances to a
                     counter, and says:</p>
                  <p>"I wish to see some black Lyons velvet." Then she pauses, and looks at some
                     black kid gloves lying before her.</p>
                  <p>"What is the number?" she asks, lifting a pair.</p>
                  <p>The young man behind the counter makes no reply.</p>
                  <p>She raises her eyes to his face for the first time, and sees—Charley
                     Stuart!</p>

                  <p>CHARLEY STUART! The original of the pictured face that lies over her heart by
                     night and day. Charley—unchanged, calm, handsome, eminently self-possessed as
                     ever, looking at her with grave gray eyes.</p>
                  <p>She turns giddy, with the utter shock of the great surprise—she leans for a
                     second heavily against the counter, and looks at him with eyes that cannot
                     believe what they see.</p>
                  <p>"Charley!"</p>
                  <p>"Edith!"</p>
                  <p>Yes, it is his voice, his smile, and he stretches his hand across the counter
                     and takes hers. Then she sinks into a seat, and for a moment the store, and the
                     faces, swim about her in a hot mist. But her heart has given one great glad
                     leap, and she knows she has found what all unconsciously she has been longing
                     for, seeking for—Charley!</p>
                  <p>He is the first to recover himself—if indeed he has lost himself for an
                     instant—and speaks:</p>
                  <p>"This is a staggerer," he says; "and yet I don't know why it should be either,
                     since everybody, high and low, who visits New York drops in here for the
                     necessaries of life, sooner or later. I began to think, however, that you must
                     have gone away again."</p>
                  <p>She looks at him. He is in no way changed that she can see—the very same
                     Charley of three years before. "You knew I was here!" she asks.</p>
                  <p>"Certainly, Lady Catheron. I read the morning papers, and <emph>always</emph>
                     look out for distinguished arrivals. Like the scent of the roses, my
                     aristocratic tastes cling to me still. I thought you would hardly endure a
                     month of Sandypoint—delightful, no doubt, as that thriving township is. I don't
                     need to ask you how you have been—I can see for myself you never looked
                     better."</p>
                  <p>He meets her steady, reproachful gaze with perfect <foreign xml:lang="FRA"
                        >sang-froid</foreign>. "You knew I was here, and you would not come to see
                     me," those dark luminous eyes say. His perfectly careless, indifferent manner
                     stings her to the quick.</p>
                  <p>"Trixy knew I was here too, of course!" she says in a very low voice.</p>
                  <p>"No," Charley answers; "I don't think she did. <emph>I</emph> didn't tell her,
                     and I am pretty sure if she had found it out for herself, her family circle
                     would have heard of it. I greatly doubt even whether she would not have taken
                     the liberty of calling upon you."</p>
                  <p>She lifts her eyes again, with a reproach her lips will not speak.</p>
                  <p>"I have deserved it," that dark, sad glance says, "but you might spare me."</p>

                     resumes gravely. "Hammond told us; he writes occasionally. Heart disease,
                     wasn't it?—poor fellow! I hope Lady Helena Powyss is quite well?"</p>
                  <p>"She is quite well."</p>
                  <p>Then there is a pause—her heart is full, and he stands here so utterly unmoved,
                     talking common-places, and looking as though even the memory of the past were
                     dead and buried. As no doubt indeed it is. She handles the gloves she still
                     holds nervously, for once in her life at a loss.</p>
                  <p>"Your mother and Trix are well?" she says after that pause.</p>
                  <p>"Quite well."</p>
                  <p>She looks up desperately:</p>
                  <p>"Charley," she exclaims; "<emph>mayn't</emph> I see them? I have wanted to see
                     them so much—to—" No, her voice breaks, she cannot finish the sentence.</p>
                  <pb n="380-381" xml:id="VAC6448-00000190"/>
                  <p>"Certainly you can see them," Mr. Stuart answers promptly; "they will be
                     delighted, I am sure. They might not feel at liberty to call upon you, Lady
                     Catheron, of course, but all the same they will only be too happy if Lady
                     Catheron will so far honor <emph>them</emph>."</p>
                  <p>He says this in the old lazy, pleasant voice, but it is quite evident he does
                     not mean to spare her—his half-sarcastic accent makes her wince as though in
                     actual bodily pain.</p>
                  <p>"I'll give you the address if you like," he goes on; "it's not the most
                     aristocratic neighborhood in the world, but it's perfectly quiet and safe." He
                     scribbles something in pencil. "Here it is—due east you see. Trix won't be home
                     until seven; she's at work in a fancy shop in Sixth avenue, you know—no, you
                     don't know of course, but she is, and I generally call round for her at
                     closing-up time. But you're safe to find her at home any evening you may name,
                     Lady Catheron, after seven P. M."</p>
                  <p>She takes the slip of paper very humbly—very unlike the Edith he used to
                     know—her lips quivering, as he can see.</p>
                  <p>"May I go at once?" she asks in that humble little voice; "I can't wait. I want
                     to see your mother, and I will stay until Trixy comes."</p>
                  <p>"My mother will be there, and charmed to see you. Of course you can go at
                     once—why should you hesitate—it's very kind of you and all that. I would escort
                     you there if I could, but unhappily I'm on duty. You'll have no trouble at all
                     finding it."</p>
                  <p>He is perfectly cordial—perfectly indifferent. He looks at her as he might look
                     at Mrs. Featherbrain herself. Yes, Edith, it is all over for you!</p>
                  <p>"I thought you were in California," she says as she rises to go; "and that
                     Trixy was married."</p>
                  <p>"No, I have never left New York, and Trix is pining in single blessedness
                     still. We are going to alter all that shortly though—for further particulars,
                     apply to Trix. Are you going? good-by, for the present, Lady Catheron."</p>
                  <p>She is out in the bright sunshine, feeling as though she were in a dream.</p>
                  <p>She summons a hack, and is driven away eastward to the address he has given
                     her. She finds it—a tall tenement house in a close street, smelling of
                     breweries, and she ascends cends a long flight of carpetless stairs, and knocks
                     at a door on the upper landing. It is opened, and the well-remembered face of
                     Aunt Chatty looks out.</p>
                  <p>"Mrs. Stuart!"</p>
                  <p>A darkly, beautiful face is before her, two black gloved hands are
                     outstretched, two brown brilliant eyes shine upon her through tears. And Mrs.
                     Stuart recoils with a gasp.</p>
                  <p>"Oh, dear me!" she says, "it <emph>is</emph> Edith!"</p>
                  <p>Yes, it is Edith, with tears large and thick in her eyes, who kisses the
                     familiar face, and who is sitting beside her, how, Mrs. Stuart never knows in
                     her amaze and bewilderment, in the humble little front room.</p>
                  <p>How changed it all is from the splendor of that other house in Fifth Avenue.
                     How different this dingy black alpaca dress and rusty widow's cap from the
                     heavy silks and French millinery of other days. But Aunt Chatty's good, easy,
                     kindly face is the same.</p>
                  <p>A hundred questions are asked and answered. Edith tells her how long she has
                     been in New York, of how only an hour ago she chanced upon Charley, and found
                     out their whereabouts. And now, if Aunt Chatty pleases, she is going to take
                     off her bonnet and wait until Beatrix comes home.</p>
                  <p>"Of course you will wait! take off your things right away. Dear me! and it is
                     really our Edith; won't Trix be surprised and glad. It isn't much of a place
                     this," says poor Mrs. Stuart, glancing about her ruefully; "not what you're
                     used to, my dear, but such as it is—"</p>
                  <p>An impetuous kiss from Edith closes her lips.</p>
                  <p>"Ah hush!" she says; "<emph>you</emph> are in it—and glad to see me. I ask no
                     more."</p>
                  <p>"And you are a widow too, dear child," Mrs. Stuart sighs, touching her black
                     dress compassionately; "it is very hard—so young, and only one short year his
                     wife. Captain Hammond told us—he writes to Trixy, you know. Poor Sir Victor! so
                     nice as he was, and that good pleasant Lady Helena. We were all so sorry. And
                     you, my dear—how have you been?"</p>
                  <p>"Perfectly well," Edith answers, but she will not talk of herself. Aunt Chatty
                     must tell her all about their trouble. Aunt Chatty tells plaintively, only too
                     glad to pour her sorrows into sympathizing ears.</p>
                  <pb n="382-383" xml:id="VAC6448-00000191"/>
                  <p>"It was very hard at first—dreadfully hard. Poor Mr. Stuart died—it was too
                     much for him. Everything was sold—everything—we were left beggars. Work was
                     difficult to get—then I fell ill. Charley was in despair almost—he grew thin
                     and hollow-eyed, the very ghost of himself. All our old friends seemed to drop
                     off, and only Providence sent Nellie Seton along, we might all have died or
                     gone to the almshouse."</p>
                  <p>"Nellie Seton?" Edith inquired; "who is she? what did she do?"</p>
                  <p>"She was a school friend of Trixy's, in reduced circumstances like ourselves,
                     who came to our succor like an angel in human form. She got Trix a situation in
                     a fancy store, she nursed me, and kept me alive on wine and jellies when I
                     could touch nothing else. She cheered up Charley and kept him from dying of
                     despair. To Nellie Seton, under Heaven, we owe it that we are alive at
                     all."</p>
                  <p>"She is a young lady—this good Miss Seton?" Edith asks, with a sharp
                     contraction of the heart.</p>
                  <p>"Yes; about Trixy's age, and wonderfully clever. She writes poetry and gets
                     paid for it, and the prettiest stories for the magazines, and is quite rich.
                     She is one of the family now almost,—very likely she will be home presently
                     with Charley and Trix—they're always together. And now, if you will excuse me,
                     Edith, I'll go and get tea."</p>
                  <p>She bustles away, and Edith sits in the little parlor alone. And she feels,
                     with a heart like a stone, that what she has lost forever, this brave, good
                     Nellie Seton has won. Well! she deserves it; she will try to like her, Edith
                     thinks; but somehow even at the thought, her heart revolts. The old feeling for
                     Mrs. Featherbrain, for Lady Gwendoline, tries to come back, in spite of her,
                     for this unseen Miss Seton. She is an altered woman—a better woman, a more
                     unselfish woman, but the old leaven of iniquity is not dead yet.</p>
                  <p>The moments drag on—it is drawing near seven. How will Trixy receive her, she
                     wonders. Will she be generous, and forget the past, or will she make her feel
                     it, as her brother has done? Seven. Mrs. Stuart has set the table. How odd it
                     seems to see Aunt Chatty working. The tea is sending its fragrance through the
                     little rooms, the buttered toast is made, the cake is cut, the pink ham is
                     sliced, everything thing looks nice and inviting. Suddenly there is the sound
                     of footsteps on the stairs, of girls' gay tones and sweet laughter—then the
                     kitchen door flies open, and Trixy's well-remembered voice is animatedly
                     exclaiming:</p>
                  <p>"Ma! is tea ready? I am famished and so is Nell. What! the table set in the
                     parlor in state. Goodness!"</p>
                  <p>Edith rises, white as the dainty Marie Stuart widow's cap she wears—still and
                     beautiful she stands. She sees Trixy's tall figure, a smaller, slighter young
                     lady beside her, and Charley standing behind both. Half a minute later Trix
                     sweeps in, sees the motionless figure, and recoils with a shriek.</p>
                  <p>"Trix!" Edith advances with the word that is almost a sob. And Trixy's face
                     grows radiant.</p>
                  <p>"It is! it <emph>is</emph>! it IS!"</p>
                  <p>She screams, and rushes forward, and catches Edith in a perfect bear's hug,
                     laughing, crying, and kissing, all in a breath.</p>

                  <p>NO coldness about the welcome here, no ungracious remembrances of the past, no
                     need ever to doubt Trixy's warm heart, and generous, forgiving, impulsive
                     nature.</p>
                  <p>All Edith's shortcomings were long ago forgotten and forgiven—it is in Edith's
                     way to inspire ardent love. Trixy loves her as dearly, as warmly as she had
                     ever done—she hugs, she kisses, she exclaims at sight of her, in a perfect
                     rapture of joy:</p>
                  <p>"O darling!" she cries, "<emph>how</emph> good it is to see you again! what a
                     surprise is this! Charley, where are you? look here! Don't you know Edith?"</p>
                  <p>"Most undoubtedly I know Edith," Charley answers, advancing; "old age may have
                     impaired my faculties, but still I recognize a familiar face when I see it. I
                     told her I thought<pb n="384-385" xml:id="VAC6448-00000192"/> you would be glad
                     to see her, but I didn't tell her you intended to eat her alive."</p>
                  <p>"You told her! Where? when?"</p>
                  <p>"In the store—this afternoon. She came in 'promiscuous' for black Lyon's
                     velvet, wasn't it, Lady Catheron? You didn't get it, by the way. Permit me to
                     inform you, in my professional capacity, that we have a very chaste and elegant
                     assortment of the article always in stock. Trix, where's your manners? Here's
                     Nellie hovering aloof in the background, waiting to be introduced. Allow
                        <emph>me</emph> to be master of the ceremonies—Lady Catheron, Miss Nellie
                     Seton."</p>
                  <p>Both young ladies bowed—both looked each other full in the face—genuine
                     admiration in Miss Seton's—keen, jealous scrutiny in Lady Catheron's. She saw a
                     girl of two or three and twenty, under-sized and rather plump, with a face
                     which in point of beauty would not for one instant compare with her own or
                     Trixy's either. But it was such a thoroughly <emph>good</emph> face. And the
                     blue, beaming eyes, the soft-cut smiling mouth, gentle, and strong, and sweet,
                     were surely made to win all hearts at sight. Not a beauty—something infinitely
                     better, and as a rival, something infinitely more dangerous.</p>
                  <p>"Lady Catheron's name is familiar to me as a household word," Miss Seton said,
                     with a frank little laugh, that subdued Edith at once. "Trix wakes with your
                     name on her lips, I believe, and goes to sleep murmuring it at night. Lady
                     Catheron doesn't know how madly jealous I have been of her before now."</p>
                  <p>Edith turns once more to Trix—faithful, friendly, loyal Trix—and stretches
                     forth both hands, with a swift, graceful impulse, tears standing, large and
                     bright, in her eyes.</p>
                  <p>"My own dear Trix!" is what she says.</p>
                  <p>"And now I'll run away," Miss Seton exclaims brightly; "auntie will expect me,
                     and I know Trix has ten thousand things to tell and to hear. No, Trixy, not a
                     word. Charley, what are you doing with your hat? put it down instantly—I don't
                     want you. I would very much rather go home alone."</p>
                  <p>"Yes, its so likely I'll let you. There's no earthly reason why you shouldn't
                     stay; but if, with your usual obstinacy and strong-mindedness, you insist upon
                     going—"</p>
                  <p>"I do insist upon going, and without an escort. You know you are rather a
                     nuisance—in the way than otherwise—oh, I mean it. I get home twice as fast when
                     I go by myself."</p>
                  <p>He looks at her—Edith turns sick—sick, as she sees the look. He says something
                     in too low a tone for the rest to hear. Miss Seton laughs, but her color rises
                     and she objects no more. Edith sees it all. A gray-kidded hand is extended to
                     her.</p>
                  <p>"Good-night, Lady Catheron," Miss Seton's bright, pleasant voice says, and Lady
                     Catheron takes it, feeling in her heart that for once she cannot dislike a
                     rival. This girl who will be Charley's wife—O blissful fate!—is worthy of him.
                     They go out together, laughing as they go.</p>
                  <p>"Isn't she just the dearest darling!" cries Trix in her gushing way; "and O
                     Edith! whatever would have become of us all without her, I shudder to think. In
                     the dark days of our life, when friends were few and far between, she was our
                     friend—our savior. She nursed mamma from the very jaws of death, she got me my
                     place in the fancy-store, and I believe—she won't own it—but I do believe she
                     saved Charley's life."</p>
                  <p>"Saved his life?" Edith falters.</p>
                  <p>"It was such an awful time," Trix says in sombre tones, "we were starving,
                     Edith, literally starving. All our old friends had forsaken us; work we could
                     not get, 'to beg we were ashamed.' If you had seen Charley in those days,
                     gaunt, hollow-eyed, haggard, wretched. He looks and feels all right now," goes
                     on Trix, brightening up a bit, "but <emph>then!</emph> it used to break my
                     heart to look at him. He tried for work, from morning until night, and day
                     after day he came home, footsore, weary, despairing. He could not leave mother
                     and me, and go elsewhere—she was sick, father was dead—poor pa!—and I was just
                     crazy, or near it. And one dark, dreadful night he went out, and down to the
                     river, and—Nellie followed, and found him there. Ah! Edith, he wasn't so much
                     to blame; I suppose he was mad that night. She came up to him, and put her arms
                     around him, as he stood in the darkness and the rain, and—I don't know what she
                     said or did—but she brought him back to us. And Providence sent him work next
                     day—the situation in the store he has now. I don't know about his merits<pb
                        n="386-387" xml:id="VAC6448-00000193"/> as a salesman," says Trix, laughing,
                     with her eyes full of tears "but he is immensely popular with the ladies.
                     Nellie says it isn't his eloquence—where the other clerks expatiate fluently on
                     the merits of ribbons, and gloves, and laces, shades and textures, Charley
                     stands silent and lets them talk, and smiles and looks handsome. I suppose it
                     answers, for they seem to like him. So now you see we get on splendidly, and
                     I've almost forgotten that we were ever rich, and wore purple and fine linen,
                     and feasted sumptuously every day."</p>
                  <p>"You are happy?" Edith asks, with wonder and envy in her eyes.</p>
                  <p>"Perfectly happy," Trix replies cheerily; "I haven't a wish unsatisfied—oh
                     well! now that you've come. I did want you, Dithy; it seems such ages and ages
                     since we met, and I was troubled about you. I heard of <emph>him</emph>, you
                     know, poor fellow."</p>
                  <p>She touches timidly Edith's widow's weeds. There is no answer—Edith's tears are
                     falling. She is contrasting her own cowardice with Trixy's courage; her own
                     hardness with Trixy's generosity.</p>
                  <p>"How do you know?" she asks at length.</p>
                  <p>"Captain Hammond. You remember Angus Hammond, I suppose?" Trix says, blushing
                     and hesitating; "he wrote us about it, and"—a pause.</p>
                  <p>"Go on; what else did he write?"</p>
                  <p>"That there was trouble of some sort, a separation, I think—that you had parted
                     on your very wedding-day. Of course we couldn't believe that."</p>
                  <p>"It is quite true," was the low reply.</p>
                  <p>Trixy's eyes opened.</p>
                  <p>"True! O Dithy! On your wedding-day!"</p>
                  <p>"On our wedding-day," Edith answered steadily; "to meet no more until we met at
                     his death-bed. Some day, Trix, dear, I will tell you how it was—not now. Two
                     years have passed, but even yet I don't care to think of it. Only
                        this—<emph>he</emph> was not to blame—he was the bravest, the noblest, the
                     best of men, ten thousand times too good for me. I was a mercenary, ambitious
                     wretch, and I received my just reward. We parted at the last friends, thank
                     God! but I can never forgive myself—never!"</p>
                  <p>There was a pause—an uncomfortable one for Trix.</p>
                  <p>"How long since you came to New York?" she asked at length.</p>
                  <p>Edith told her—told her how she had been wandering over the world since her
                     husband's death—how she had come to America to see her father—how she had tried
                     to find them here in New York—how signally she had failed—and how to-day, by
                     purest accident, she had come upon Charley in the Broadway store.</p>
                  <p>"How astonished he must have been," his sister said; "I think I see him,
                     lifting his eyebrows to the middle of his forehead. Did he take you for a
                     ghost?"</p>
                  <p>"By no means, and he was not in the least surprised. He knew I was here, from
                     the first."</p>
                  <p>"Edith!"</p>
                  <p>"He told me so. He saw my arrival in the paper when I first landed."</p>
                  <p>"And he never told <emph>me</emph>, and he never went to see you! The wretch!"
                     cried Trix.</p>
                  <p>"I don't know that he is to blame," Edith responded quietly. "I deserved no
                     better; and ah! Trixy, not many in this world are as generous as
                        <emph>you</emph>. So you are perfectly happy, darling? I wonder if Captain
                     Hammond, now, has anything to do with it?"</p>
                  <p>"Well, yes," Trix admits blushingly again; "I may as well tell you. We are to
                     be married at Christmas."</p>
                  <p>"Trix! Married!"</p>
                  <p>"Married at last. We were engaged before I left England, three years ago. He
                     wanted to marry me then, foolish fellow!" says Trix with shining eyes, "but of
                     course, we none of us would listen to so preposterous a thing. He had only his
                     pay and his debts, and his expectations from a fairy godmother or grandmother,
                     who <emph>wouldn't</emph> die. But she died last mail—I mean last mail brought
                     a black bordered letter, saying she was gone to glory, and had left Angus
                     everything. He is going to sell out of the army, and will be here by Christmas,
                     and—and the wedding is to take place the very week he arrives. And, oh! Edith,
                     he's just the dearest fellow, the best fellow, and I'm the happiest girl in all
                     New York!"</p>
                  <p>Edith says nothing. She takes Trix, who is crying, suddenly in her arms, and
                     kisses her. Angus Hammond has<pb n="388-389" xml:id="VAC6448-00000194"/> been
                     faithful in the hour when she deserted them—that is her thought. Her
                     self-reproach never ceases—never for one hour.</p>
                  <p>"We go to Scotland of course," said Trix, wiping her eyes; "and ma—also, of
                     course, stays with Charley. Nellie will be here to fill my place—don't you
                     think she will make a charming sister?"</p>
                  <p>She laughs as she asks the question—it is the one little revenge she takes.
                     Before Edith can reply she runs on:</p>
                  <p>"Nellie's rich—rich, I mean, as compared with us, and she has made it all
                     herself. She's awfully clever, and writes for magazines, and papers, and
                     things, and earns oceans of money. <emph>Oceans</emph>," says Trix, opening her
                     eyes to the size of saucers; "and I don't know really which of us ma likes
                     best, Nellie or me. That's my one comfort in going. Here comes Charley
                     now—let's have tea at once. I forgot all about it, but nobody has the faintest
                     idea of the pangs of hunger I am enduring."</p>
                  <p>Charley sauntered in, looking fresh and handsome, from the night air.</p>
                  <p>It was quite dark now. Trix lit the lamp and bustled about helping to get
                     supper. "You told Nellie?" she asked her brother in a low tone, but Edith
                     caught the words.</p>
                  <p>"Yes," Charley answered gravely, "I told her."</p>
                  <p>"What did she say?"</p>
                  <p>"Everything that was like Nellie—everything that was bright, and brave, and
                     good. She will be here in the morning to say good-by. Now, Mrs. Stuart, if you
                     have any compassion on a famished only son, hurry up, and let's have
                     supper."</p>
                  <p>They sat down around the little table where the lamp shone brightly—Edith
                     feeling cold and strange and out of place. Trixy and Aunt Chatty might, and
                     did, forgive the past, but she herself could not, and between her and Charley
                     lay a gulf, to be spanned over on earth no more. And yet—how beautiful and
                     stately she looked in her little white widow's cap, her sombre dress, and the
                     frill of sheer white crape at her throat.</p>
                  <p>"Edith!" Trix said involuntarily, "how handsome you have grown! You were always
                     pretty, but now—I don't mean to flatter—but you are splendid! It can't be that
                     black becomes you, and yet—Charley, don't you see it? hasn't Edith grown
                     lovely?"</p>
                  <p>"Trix!" Edith cried, and over her pale cheeks there rose a flush, and into her
                     dark, brilliant eyes there came a light, that made her for the moment all Trixy
                     said.</p>
                  <p>Charley looked at her across the table—the cool, clear, gray eyes, perfectly
                     undazzled.</p>
                  <p>"I used to think it impossible for Edith to improve; I find out my mistake
                     to-day, as I find out many others. As it is not permitted one to say what one
                     thinks on these subjects, one had better say nothing at all."</p>
                  <p>The flush that has risen to Edith's cheeks remains there, and deepens. After
                     tea, at Trixy's urgent request, she sits down at the little hired piano, and
                     sings some of the old songs.</p>
                  <p>"Your very voice has improved," Trix says admiringly. "Edith, sing
                        <emph>Charley he's my darling</emph>, for Charley. It used to be a favorite
                     of his."</p>
                  <p>She gives him a malicious sidelong glance. Charley, lying back in his mother's
                     comfortable, cushioned rocking-chair, takes it calmly.</p>
                  <p>"It used to be, but it has ceased to be," he answers coolly. "Trix, go out like
                     a good child, and get me the evening paper. Among my other staid, middle-aged
                     habits, Lady Catheron, is that of reading the <title>Post</title> every evening
                     religiously, after tea."</p>
                  <p>Never Edith any more—always Lady Catheron—never the girl he loved three years
                     ago—whom he had said he would love all his life, but the richly dowered widow
                     of Sir Victor Catheron. He will not generously forget, even for an instant,
                     that he is an impecunious dry goods clerk, she a lady of rank and riches.</p>
                  <p>She rises to go—it is growing almost more than she can bear. Trix presses her
                     to stay longer, but in vain; <emph>he</emph> never utters a word.</p>
                  <p>"Shall Charley call a carriage, or will you prefer to walk?" Trix asks
                     doubtfully.</p>
                  <p>"She will walk," says Charley, suddenly looking up and interfering; "the night
                     is fine, and I will see her home."</p>
                  <p>For one instant, at the tone of his voice, at the look of his eyes, her heart
                     bounds.</p>
                  <pb n="390-391" xml:id="VAC6448-00000195"/>
                  <p>Her bonnet and mantle are brought—she kisses Trix and Aunt Chatty
                     good-night—they have promised to dine with her to-morrow—and goes forth into
                     the soft October night with Charley.</p>
                  <p>He draws her hand within his arm—the night is star-lit, lovely. The old time
                     comes back, the old feeling of rest and content, the old comfortable feeling
                     that it is Charley's arm upon which she leans, and that she asks no more of
                     fate. To-morrow he may be Nellie Seton's—just now, he belongs to her.</p>
                  <p>"Oh!" she exclaims, with a long-drawn breath, "how familiar it all is! these
                     gas-lit New York streets, the homelike look of the men and women, and—you. It
                     seems as though I had left Sandypoint only yesterday, and you were showing me
                     again the wonders of New York for the first time."</p>
                  <p>He looks down at the dusk, warm, lovely face, so near his own.</p>
                  <p>"Sandypoint," he repeats; "Edith, do you recall what I said to you there? Have
                     you ever wished once, in those three years that are gone, that I had never come
                     to Sandypoint to take you away?"</p>
                  <p>"I have never wished it," she answers truly; "never once. I have never blamed
                     you, never blamed anyone but myself—how could I? The evil of my life I wrought
                     with my own hand, and—if it were all to come over again—I would still go! I
                     have suffered, but at least—I have lived."</p>
                  <p>"I am glad to hear that," he says after a little pause; "it has troubled me
                     again and again. You see, Hammond wrote us all he ever knew of you, and though
                     it was rather incomprehensible in part, it was clear enough your life was not
                     entirely a bed of roses. All that, I hope, is over and done with—there can be
                     no reason why all the rest of your life should not be entirely happy. This is
                     partly why I wished to walk home with you to-night, that I might know from your
                     own lips whether you held me blameless or not. And partly, also—" a second
                     brief pause;—"to bid you good-by."</p>
                  <p>"Good-by!" In the starlight she turns deathly white.</p>
                  <p>"Yes," he responded cheerily; "good-by; and as our lives lie so widely apart in
                     all probability, this time forever. I shall certainly return here at Christmas,
                     but you may have gone before that. To-morrow morning I start for St. Louis,
                     where a branch of our house is established, and where I am permanently to
                     remain. It is an excellent opening for me—my salary has been largely advanced,
                     and I am happy to say the firm think me competent and trustworthy. I return, as
                     I said, at Christmas; after that it becomes my permanent home. You know, of
                     course," he says with a laugh, "why I return—Trix has told you?"</p>
                  <p>So completely has she forgotten Trix, so wholly have her thoughts been of him,
                     that she absolutely does not remember to what he alludes.</p>
                  <p>"Trix has told me nothing," she manages to answer, and she wonders at herself
                     to find how steady is her own voice.</p>
                  <p>"No?" Charley says, elevating his eyebrows; "and they say the age of wonders is
                     over! Trix in the new roll of keeping her own secrets! Well, I very naturally
                     return for <emph>the</emph> wedding—<emph>our</emph> wedding. It's
                     extraordinary that Trix hasn't told you, but she will. Then—my Western home
                     will be ready by that time, and we go back immediately. My mother goes with me,
                     I need hardly say."</p>
                  <p>Still so absolutely wrapped up in her thoughts of <emph>him</emph>, so utterly
                     forgetful of Trix, that she does not understand. <emph>Our</emph> wedding—he
                     means his own and Nellie Seton's of course. His Western home, the home where
                     she will reign as his wife. In the days that have gone, Edith thinks she has
                     suffered—she feels to-night that she has never suffered until now! She deserves
                     it, but if he had only spared her,—only left it for some one else to tell. It
                     is a minute before she can reply—then, despite every effort, her voice is
                     husky:</p>
                  <p>"I wish you joy, Charley—with all my heart."</p>
                  <p>She cannot say one word more. Something in the words, in her manner of saying
                     them, makes him look at her in surprise.</p>
                  <p>"Well, yes," he answers coolly; "a wedding in a family is, I believe, a general
                     subject of congratulation. And I must say she has shown herself a trump—the
                     bravest, best girl alive. And you"—they are drawing near a hotel—"may I venture
                     to ask your plans, Lady Catheron? how long do you think of remaining in New
                     York?"</p>
                  <p>"I shall leave at once—at once," she replied in the same husky tone. To stay
                     and meet Nellie Seton after to-night<pb n="392-393" xml:id="VAC6448-00000196"/>
                     is more than she is able to do. They are close to the hotel now.
                     Involuntarily—unconsciously, she clings to his arm, as the drowning may cling
                     to a straw. She feels in a dull, agonized sort of way that in five minutes the
                     waters will have closed over her head, and the story of her life have come to
                     an end.</p>
                  <p>"Here we are," his frank, cheery voice says—his voice, that has yet a deeper,
                     more earnest tone than of old. "You don't know, Edith, how glad I am of this
                     meeting—how glad to hear you never in any way blamed <emph>me</emph>."</p>
                  <p>"I blame you! oh, Charley!" she says with a passionate little cry.</p>
                  <p>"I rejoice to hear, that with all its drawbacks, you don't regret the past. I
                     rejoice in the knowledge that you are rich and happy, and that a long, bright
                     life lies before you. Edith," he takes both her hands in his strong, cordial
                     clasp, "if we never meet again, God bless you, and good-by."</p>
                  <p>She lifts her eyes to his, full of dumb, speechless agony. In that instant he
                     knows the truth—knows that Edith loves him—that the heart he would once have
                     laid down his life almost to win, is his wholly at last!</p>
                  <p>The revelation comes upon him like a flash—like a blow. He stands holding her
                     hands, looking at her, at the mute, infinite misery in her eyes. Someone
                     jostles them in passing, and turns and stares. It dawns upon him that they are
                     in the public street, and making a scene.</p>
                  <p>"Good-by," he says hastily once more, and drops the hands, and turns and
                     goes.</p>
                  <p>She stands like a statue where he has left her—he turns a corner, the last
                     sound of his footsteps dies away, and Edith feels that he has gone out of her
                     life—out of the whole world.</p>

                  <p>MISS NELLIE SETON came early next morning to see her friend, Mr. Charley
                     Stuart, off. He is looking rather pale as he bids them good-by—the vision of
                     Edith's eyes upturned to his, full of mute, impassionate appeal, have haunted
                     him all night long. They haunt him now, long after the last good-by had been
                     said, and the train is sweeping away Westward. Edith loves him at last. At
                     last? there has never been a time when he doubted it, but now he knows he has
                     but to say the word, and she will lay her hand in his, and toil, and parting,
                     and separation will end between them forever. But he will never say that
                     word—what Edith Darrell in her ambition once refused, all Lady Catheron's
                     wealth and beauty cannot win. He feels he could as easily leap from the car
                     window and end it all, as ask Sir Victor Catheron's richly dowered widow to be
                     his wife. She made her choice three years ago—she must abide by that choice her
                     life long.</p>
                  <p>"And then," he thinks rather doggedly, "this fancy of mine may be only fancy.
                     The leopard cannot change his spots, and an <choice>
                        <sic>ambitous</sic>
                        <corr>ambitious</corr>
                     </choice>, mercenary woman cannot change her nature. And, as a rule, ladies of
                     wealth and title <emph>don't</emph> throw themselves away on impecunious dry
                     goods clerks. No! I made an egregious ass of myself once, and once is quite
                     enough. We have turned over a new leaf, and are not going back at this late day
                     to the old ones. With her youth, her fortune, and her beauty, Edith can return
                     to England and make a brilliant second marriage."</p>
                  <p>And then Mr. Stuart sets his lips behind his brown mustache, and unfolds the
                     morning paper, smelling damp and nasty of printer's ink, and immerses himself,
                     fathoms deep, in mercantile news and the doings of the Stock Exchange.</p>
                  <p>He reaches St. Louis in safety, and resumes the labor of his life. He has no
                     time to think—no time to be sentimental, if he wished to be, which he
                     doesn't.</p>
                  <p>"Love is of man's life a thing apart," sings a poet, who<pb n="394-395"
                        xml:id="VAC6448-00000197"/> knew what he was talking about. His heart is not
                     in the least broken, nor likely to be; there is no time in his busy, mercantile
                     life, for that sort of thing, I repeat. He goes to work with a will, and
                     astonishes even himself by his energy and brisk business capacity. If he thinks
                     of Edith at all, amid his dry-as-dust ledgers and blotters, his buying and
                     selling, it is that she is probably on the ocean by this time—having bidden her
                     native land, like <title>Childe Harold</title>, "One long, one last,
                     good-night." And then, in the midst of it all, Trixy's first letter
                     arrives.</p>
                  <p>It is all Edith, from beginning to end. Edith has not gone, she is still in New
                     York, but her passage is taken, and she will leave next week. "And Charley,"
                     says Trix, "don't be angry now, but do you know, though Edith Darrell always
                     liked you, I fancy Lady Catheron likes you even better. Not that she ever says
                     anything; bless you! she is as proud as ever; but we women can tell. And last
                     night she told ma and me the story of her past, of her married life—or rather
                     her <emph>un</emph>-married life—of her separation from Sir Victor on their
                     wedding-day—think of it, Charley! <emph>on their wedding-day</emph>. If ever
                     anyone in this world was to be pitied, it was he—poor fellow! And she was not
                     to blame—neither could have acted other than they did, that I can see. Poor
                     Edith! poor Sir Victor! I will tell you all when we meet. She leaves next
                     Tuesday, and it half breaks my heart to see her go. Oh, Charley! Charley!
                        <emph>why</emph> need she go at all?"</p>
                  <p>He reads this letter as he smokes his cigar—very gravely, very thoughtfully,
                     wondering a great deal, but not in the least moved from his steadfast purpose.
                     Parted on their wedding-day! he has heard that before, but hardly credited it.
                     It is true then—odd that; and neither to be blamed—odder still. She has only
                     been Sir Victor's wife in name, then, after all. But it makes no difference to
                     him—nothing does—all that is past and done—she flung him off once—he will never
                     go back now. Their paths lie apart—hers over the hills of life, his in the
                     dingy valleys—they have said good-by, and it means forever.</p>
                  <p>He goes back to his ledgers and his counting-room, and four more days pass. On
                     the evening of the fourth day, as he leaves the store for the night, a small
                     boy from the telegraph office waylays him, and hands him one of the well-known
                     buff envelopes. He breaks it open where he stands, and read this:</p>

                  <p>He reads, and the truth does not come to him—he reads it again. <emph>Edith is
                        dying</emph>. And then a grayish pallor comes over his face, from brow to
                     chin, and he stands for a moment, staring vacantly at the paper he holds,
                     seeing nothing—hearing nothing but these words: "Edith is dying." In that
                     moment he knows that all his imaginary hardness and indifference have been
                     hollow and false—a wall of pride that crumbles at a touch, and the old love,
                     stronger than life, stronger than death, fills his heart still. He has left
                     her, and—Edith is dying! He looks at his watch. There is an Eastward-bound
                     train in half an hour—there will be barely time to catch it. He does not return
                     to his boarding house—he calls a passing hack, and is driven to the depot just
                     in time. He makes no pause from that hour—he travels night and day. What is
                     business; what the prospects of all his future life; what is the whole world
                     now? Edith is dying.</p>
                  <p>He reaches New York at last. It seems like a century since that telegram came,
                     and haggard and worn, in the twilight of the autumn day, he stands at last in
                     his mother's home.</p>
                  <p>Trix is there—they expect him to-night, and she has waited to receive him. She
                     looks in his face once, then turns away and covers her own, and bursts into a
                     woman's tempest of tears.</p>
                  <p>"I—I am too late," he says in a hoarse sort of whisper.</p>
                  <p>"No," Trix answers, looking up; "not too late. She is alive still—I can say no
                     more."</p>
                  <p>"What is it?" he asks.</p>
                  <p>"It is almost impossible to say. Typhoid fever, one doctor says, and <foreign
                        xml:lang="LAT">cerebro spinal meningitis</foreign> says the other. It
                     doesn't much matter what it is, since both agree in this—that she is
                     dying."</p>
                  <pb n="396-397" xml:id="VAC6448-00000198"/>
                  <p>Her sobs breaks forth again. He sits and gazes at her like a stone.</p>
                  <p>"There is no hope?"</p>
                  <p>"While there is life there is hope." But it is in a very dreary voice that Trix
                     repeats this aphorism: "and—the worst of it is, she doesn't seem to care.
                     Charley, I believe she wants to die, is glad to die. She seems to have nothing
                     to care for—nothing to live for. 'My life has been all a mistake,' she said to
                     me the other day. 'I have gone wrong from first to last, led astray by my
                     vanity, and selfishness, and ambition. It is much better that I should die, and
                     make an end of it all.' She has made her will, Charley—she made it in the first
                     days of her illness, and—she has left almost everything to you."</p>
                  <p>He makes no reply. He sits motionless in the twilit window, looking down at the
                     noisy, bustling street.</p>
                  <p>"She has remembered me most generously," Trix goes softly on; "poor, darling
                     Edith! but she has left almost all to you. 'It would have been an insult to
                     offer anything in my lifetime,' she said to me; 'but the wishes of the dead are
                     sacred,—he will not be able to refuse it <emph>then</emph>. And tell him not to
                     grieve for me, Trixy—I never made him anything but trouble, and disappointment,
                     and wretchedness. I am sorry—sorry now, and my last wish and prayer will be for
                     the happiness of his life.' When she is delirious, and she mostly is as night
                     draws on, she calls for you incessantly—asking you to come back—begging you to
                     forgive her. That is why I sent."</p>
                  <p>"Does she know you sent?" he asks.</p>
                  <p>"No—it was her desire you should not be told until—until all was over," Trix
                     answered with another burst of tears; "but I <emph>couldn't</emph> do that. She
                     says we are to bury her at Sandypoint, beside her mother—not send her body to
                     England. She told me, when she was dead, to tell you the story of her
                     separation from Sir Victor. Shall I tell it to you now, Charley?"</p>
                  <p>He makes a motion of assent; and Trix begins, in a broken voice, and tells him
                     the sad, strange story of the two Sir Victors, father and son, and of Edith's
                     life from her wedding-day. The twilight deepens into darkness, the room is
                     wrapped in <unclear>shadows</unclear> long before she has finished. He never
                     stirs, he never speaks, he sits and listens to the end. Then there is a pause,
                     and out of the gloom he speaks at last:</p>
                  <p>"May I see her, and when?"</p>
                  <p>"As soon as you come, the doctors say; they refuse her nothing now, and they
                     think your presence may do her good,—if anything can do it. Mother is with her
                     and Nellie; Nellie has been her best friend and nurse; Nellie has never left
                     her, and Charley," hesitatingly, for something in his manner awes Trix, "I
                     believe she thinks you and Nellie are engaged."</p>
                  <p>"Stop!" he says imperiously, and Trixy rises with a sigh and puts on her hat
                     and shawl. Five minutes later they are in the street, on their way to Lady
                     Catheron's hotel.</p>
                  <p>One of the medical men is in the sick-room when Miss Stuart enters it, and she
                     tells him in a whisper that her brother has come, and is waiting without.</p>
                  <p>His patient lies very low to-night—delirious at times, and sinking, it seems to
                     him, fast. She is in a restless, fevered sleep at present, and he stands
                     looking at her with a very sombre look on his professional face. In spite of
                     his skill, and he is very skilful, this case baffles him. The patient's own
                     utter indifference, as to whether she lives or dies, being one of the hardest
                     things he has to combat. If she only longed for life, and strove to recruit—if,
                     like Mrs. Dombey, she would, "only make an effort." But she will not, and the
                     flame flickers, and flickers, and very soon will go out altogether.</p>
                  <p>"Let him come in," the doctor says. "He can do no harm—he may possibly do some
                     good."</p>
                  <p>"Will she know him when she awakes?" Trix whispers.</p>
                  <p>He nods and turns away to where Miss Seton stands in the distance, and Trix
                     goes and fetches her brother in. He advances slowly, almost reluctantly it
                     would seem, and looks down at the wan, drawn, thin face that rests there,
                     whiter than the pillows. Great Heaven! and this—<emph>this</emph> is Edith! He
                     sinks into a chair by the bedside, and takes her wan, transparent hand in both
                     his own, with a sort of groan. The light touch awakes her, the faint eyelids
                     quiver, the large, dark eyes open and fix on his face. The lips flutter
                     breathlessly apart. "<emph>Charley!</emph>" they whisper in glad surprise,
                        and<pb n="398-399" xml:id="VAC6448-00000199"/> over the death-like face
                     there flashes for a second an electric light of great amaze and joy.</p>
                  <p>"Humph!" says the doctor, with a surprised grunt; "I thought it would do her no
                     harm. If we leave them alone for a few minutes, my dear young ladies, it will
                     do <emph>us</emph> no harm either. Mind, my young gentleman," he taps Charley
                     on the shoulder, "my patient is not to excite herself talking."</p>
                  <p>They softly go out. It would appear the doctor need not have warned him; they
                     don't seem inclined to talk. She lies and looks at him, delight in her eyes,
                     and draws a long, long breath of great content. For him, he holds her wasted
                     hand a little tighter, and lays his face down on the pillow, and does not speak
                     a word.</p>
                  <p>So the minutes pass.</p>
                  <p>"Charley," she says at last, in a faint, little whisper, "what a surprise this
                     is. They did not tell me you were coming. Who sent for you? When did you
                     come?"</p>
                  <p>"You're not to talk, Edith," he answers, lifting his haggard face for a
                     moment—poor Charley! "Trix sent for me." Then he lays it down again.</p>
                  <p>"Foolish boy!" Edith says with shining eyes; "I do believe you are crying. You
                     don't hate me, then, after all, Charley?"</p>
                  <p>"Hate you!" he can but just repeat.</p>
                  <p>"You once said you did, you know; and I deserved it. But I have not been happy,
                     Charley—I have been punished as I merited. Now it is all over, and it is better
                     so—I never was of any use in the world, and never would be. You will let me
                     atone a little for the past in the only way I can. Trix will tell you. And, by
                     and by, when you are quite happy, and she is your wife—"</p>
                  <p>The faint voice breaks, and she turns her face away. Even in death it is
                     bitterer than death to give him up.</p>
                  <p>He lifts his head, and looks at her.</p>
                  <p>"When she is my wife? when <emph>who</emph> is my wife?" he asks.</p>
                  <p>"Nellie—you know," she whispers; "she is worthy of you, Charley—indeed she is,
                     and I never was. And she loves you, and will make you hap—"</p>
                  <p>"Stop!" he says suddenly; "you are making some strange mistake, Edith. Nellie
                     cares for me, as Trix does, and Trix is not more a sister to me than Nellie.
                     For the rest—do you remember what I said to you that night at Killarney?"</p>
                  <p>Her lips tremble—her eyes watch him, her weak fingers close tightly over his.
                     Remember! does she <emph>not?</emph>
                  </p>
                  <p>"I said—'I will love you all my life!' I have kept my word, and mean to keep
                     it. If I may not call you wife, I will never call, by that name, any other
                     woman. No one in this world can ever be to me again, what you were and
                     are."</p>
                  <p>There is another pause, but the dark, uplifted eyes are radiant now.</p>
                  <p>"At last! at last!" she breathes; "when it is too late. Oh, Charley! If the
                     past might only come over again, how different it all would be. I think"—she
                     says this with a weak little laugh, that reminds him of the Edith of old—"I
                     think I could sleep more happily even in my grave—if 'Edith Stuart' were carved
                     on my tombstone!"</p>
                  <p>His eyes never leave her face—they light up in their dreary sadness now at
                     these words.</p>
                  <p>"Do you mean that, Edith?" he says bending over her; "living or dying, would it
                     make you any happier to be my wife?"</p>
                  <p>Her eyes, her face, answer him. "But it is too late," the pale lips sigh.</p>
                  <p>"It is never too late," he says quietly; "we will be married to-night."</p>
                  <p>"<emph>Charley?</emph>"</p>
                  <p>"You are not to talk," he tells her, kissing her softly and for the first time;
                     "I will arrange it all. I will go for a clergyman I know, and explain
                     everything. Oh, darling! you should have been my wife long ago—you shall be my
                     wife at last, in spite of death itself."</p>
                  <p>Then he leaves her, and goes out. And Edith closes her eyes, and lies still,
                     and knows that never in all the years that are gone has such perfect bliss been
                     hers before. In death, at least, if not life, she will be Charley's wife.</p>
                  <p>He tells them very quietly, very resolutely—her father who is there from
                     Sandypoint, his mother, sister, Nellie, the doctor.</p>
                  <pb n="400-401" xml:id="VAC6448-00000200"/>
                  <p>They listen in wordless wonder; but what can they say?</p>
                  <p>"The excitement will finish her—mark my words," is the doctor's verdict; "I
                     will never countenance any such melodramatic proceeding."</p>
                  <p>But his countenance does not matter it seems. The laws of the Medes were not
                     more fixed than this marriage. The clergyman comes, a very old friend of the
                     family, and Charley explains all to him. He listens with quiet gravity—in his
                     experience a death-bed marriage is not at all an unprecedented occurrence. The
                     hour fixed is ten, and Trixy and Nellie go in to make the few possible
                     preparations.</p>
                  <p>The sick girl lifts two wistful eyes to the gentle face of Nellie Seton. It is
                     very pale, but she stoops and kisses her with her own sweet smile.</p>
                  <p>"You will live now for <emph>his</emph> sake," she whispers in that kiss.</p>
                  <p>They decorate the room and the bed with flowers, they brush away the dark soft
                     hair, they array her in a dainty embroidered night-robe, and prop her up with
                     pillows. There is the fever fire on her wan cheeks, the fever fire in her
                     shining eyes. But she is unutterably happy—you have but to look into her face
                     to see that. Death is forgotten in her new bliss.</p>
                  <p>The bridegroom comes in, pale and unsmiling—worn and haggard beyond the power
                     of words to tell. Trix, weeping incessantly, stands near, her mother and Mr.
                     Darrell are at one side of the bed. Nellie is bridesmaid. What a strange, sad,
                     solemn wedding it is! The clergyman takes out his book and begins—bride and
                     bridegroom clasp hands, her radiant eyes never leave his face. Her faint
                     replies flutter on her lips—there is an indescribable sadness in his. The ring
                     is on her finger—at last she is what she should have been from the
                     first—Charley's wife.</p>
                  <p>He bends forward and takes her in his arms. With all her dying strength she
                     lifts herself to his embrace. It is a last expiring effort—her weak clasp
                     relaxes, there is one faint gasp. Her head falls heavily upon his breast—there
                     is a despairing cry from the women, cold and lifeless, Charley Stuart lays his
                     bride of a moment back among the pillows—whether dead or in a dead swoon no one
                     there can tell.</p>

                  <head>CHAPTER XI.</head>
                  <head type="sub">THE NIGHT.</head>
                  <p>AT first they thought her dead—but it was not death. She awoke from that long,
                     death-like swoon as morning broke—so near unto death that it seemed the turning
                     of a hair might weigh down the scale. And so for days after it was—for weary
                     miserable days and nights. The great reaction after the great excitement had
                     come, all consciousness left her, she lay white and still, scarcely moving,
                     scarcely breathing. The one beloved voice fell as powerless on her dulled ears
                     now as all others, the dim, almost lifeless eyes, that opened at rare
                     intervals, were blank to the whole world. She lay in a species of stupor, or
                     coma, from which it was something more than doubtful if she ever would awake.
                     The few spoonfuls of beef-tea and brandy and water she took they forced between
                     her clenched teeth, and in that darkened room of the great hotel, strangely,
                     solemnly quiet, Life and Death fought their sharp battle over her unconscious
                     head.</p>
                  <p>And for those who loved her, her father, her friends, and one other, nearer and
                     dearer than father or friend, how went those darkest days for
                        <emph>them?</emph> They could hardly have told—all their after life they
                     looked back, with a sick shudder, to that week.</p>
                  <p>For Charley Stuart he never wants to look back—never to the last day of his
                     life will he be able to recall, to realize the agony of those six days—days
                     that changed his whole nature—his whole life.</p>
                  <p>They watched with her unceasingly—death might come at any moment. There were
                     times when they bent above her, holding their own breath, sure that the faint
                     thread had already snapped—times when they held a mirror to her lips to be sure
                     she breathed at all. For her new-made husband, he never left her except when
                     nature succumbed to the exhaustion of ceaseless vigil, and they forced him
                     away. He forgot to eat or sleep, he sat tearless and still as stone by the
                     bedside, almost as bloodless, almost as wan and hollow-eyed<pb n="402-403"
                        xml:id="VAC6448-00000201"/> as the dying bride herself. The doctors stood
                     gloomily silent, their skill falling powerless here.</p>
                  <p>"She needed only the excitement of this most preposterous marriage to finish
                     her," one of them growled; "I said so at the time—I say so now. She had one
                     chance for life—perfect quiet—and that destroyed it."</p>
                  <p>On the fourth day, a letter from England, in a woman's hand, and deeply
                     bordered with black, arrived. Edith, in the first days of her illness, had told
                     Trix to open all her letters. She would have passed the power over to her
                     brother now, but he waved it away impatiently. What did it matter whom it was
                     from—what it contained—what did anything matter now?</p>
                  <p>His haggard eyes went silently back to the marble face lying among its pillows,
                     so awfully still.</p>
                  <p>Trixy opened and read it. It was from Inez Catheron, and announced the death of
                     her aunt, the Lady Helena Powyss.</p>
                  <p>"Her end was perfect peace," said the letter; "and in her will, she has left
                     her large fortune divided equally between you and me. If possible it would be
                     well for you to return to England as speedily as may be. If wealth can make you
                     happy—and I hope at least it will aid—my dearest Edith, you will have it. For
                     me, I join a charitable Sisterhood here in London, and will try to devote the
                     remainder of my life to the relief of my suffering and poor fellow-creatures.
                     As to the rest, if you care at all to know, my brother reigns at Catheron
                     Royals now! He is, in all respects, a changed man, and will not, I think, be an
                     unworthy successor of him who is gone. His wife and children are all that can
                     be desired.</p>
                  <p>"Farewell, my dear cousin. When you return to London come to the enclosed
                     address, and see me. No one will welcome you more gladly than</p>
                  <p>"INEZ CATHERON."</p>
                  <p>So another large fortune had been left Edith—she was rich now beyond her
                     wildest dreams. Rich! And yonder she lay, and all the gold of earth, powerless
                     to add a second to her life. What a satire it seemed. Youth, beauty, and
                     boundless wealth were hers, and all were vain—vain!</p>
                  <p>The seventh night brought the crisis.</p>
                  <p>"This can hold out no longer," the physician said; "before morning we will know
                     the end, whether it is to be life or death."</p>
                  <p>"Then—there is hope yet?" Trix breathed, with clasped hands.</p>
                  <p>He looked at her gloomily and turned away, the meaningless formula on his
                     lips:</p>
                  <p>"While there is life there is hope."</p>
                  <p>"It will be little less than a miracle if she lives, though," the other added;
                     "and the days of miracles are over. Hope if you like—but—"</p>
                  <p>"You had better not let <emph>him</emph> sit up to-night," said the first
                     physician, looking compassionately at Charley; "he won't be able to stand it.
                     He is worn out now, poor fellow, and looks fit for a sick-bed himself."</p>
                  <p>"He knows it is the crisis," Trixy answered; "he won't go."</p>
                  <p>"He has watched the last two nights," Miss Seton, interposed: "he
                        <emph>must</emph> go, doctor; leave me an opiate—I will administer it. If—if
                     the worst comes, it will be but a moment's work to arouse him."</p>
                  <p>The doctor obeyed.</p>
                  <p>"I will return at day dawn," he said, "if she be still alive. If not—send me
                     word."</p>
                  <p>The twilight was falling. Solemn and shadowy it crept into the sombre, silent
                     room. They went back to the bedside, pale and tearless; they had wept, it
                     seemed, until they could weep no more. This last night the two girls were to
                     watch alone.</p>
                  <p>She lay before them. Dead and in her shroud she would never look more awfully
                     death-like than now. He sat beside her—ah, poor Charley! in a sort of dull
                     stupor of misery, utterly worn out. The sharp pain seemed over—the long, dark
                     watches, when his passionate prayers had ascended for that dear life, wild and
                     rebellious it may be, when he had wrestled with an agony more bitter than
                     death, had left their impress on his life forever. He could not let her go—he
                     could not! "O God!" was the ceaseless cry of his soul, "have mercy—spare!"</p>
                  <p>Nellie Seton's cool, soft hands fell lightly on his head—Nellie's soft, gentle
                     voice spoke:</p>
                  <pb n="404-405" xml:id="VAC6448-00000202"/>
                  <p>"Charley, you are to leave us for a little, and lie down. You must have some
                     rest, be it ever so short; and you have had nothing to eat, I believe all day;
                     you will let me prepare something, and take it, and go to your room."</p>
                  <p>She spoke to him coaxingly, almost as she might to a child. He lifted his eyes,
                     full of dull, infinite misery, to hers.</p>
                  <p>"To-night?" he answered: "the last night! I will not go."</p>
                  <p>"Only for an hour then," she pleaded; "there will be no change. For
                        <emph>my</emph> sake, Charley!"</p>
                  <p>All her goodness, all her patience, came back to him. He pressed her hand in
                     his own gratefully, and arose.</p>
                  <p>"For your sake, Nellie, then—for no other. But you promise to call me if there
                     is the slightest change?"</p>
                  <p>"I promise. Drink this and go."</p>
                  <p>She gave him a glass of mulled wine, containing the opiate. He drank it and
                     left the room. They listened breathlessly until they heard his door, further
                     down the passage, open and shut—then both drew a deep breath.</p>
                  <p>"Thank Heaven," Trix said; "I couldn't bear to see him here to-night. Nellie,
                     if she dies it will kill him—just that."</p>
                  <p>The girl's lips quivered. What Charley had been to her—how wholly her great,
                     generous, loving heart had gone out to him, not even Trix ever knew. The dream
                     of her life's best bliss was at an end forever. Whether Edith Stuart lived or
                     died, no other woman would ever take her place in his heart.</p>
                  <p>The hours of the night wore on. Oh! those solemn night watches by the dying bed
                     of those we love. The faint lamp flickers, deepest stillness reigns, and on his
                     bed, dressed as he was, Charley lies deeply, dreamlessly asleep.</p>
                  <p>It was broad day when he awoke—the dawn of a cloudless November day. He sat up
                     in bed suddenly, for a moment, bewildered, and stared before him. Only for a
                     moment—then he remembered all. The night had passed, the morning come. They had
                     let him sleep—it seemed he <emph>could</emph> sleep while she lay dying so
                     near. Dying! Who was to tell him that in yonder distant room Edith was not
                     lying dead. He rose up, reeling like a drunken man, and made for the door. He
                     opened it, and went out, down the passage sage. It was entirely deserted, the
                     great household were not yet astir. Profound stillness reigned. Through the
                     windows he could see the bright morning sky, all flushed, red and golden with
                     the first radiance of the rising sun. And in that room there what lay—death or
                     life?</p>
                  <p>He stood suddenly still, and looked at the closed door. He stood there
                     motionless, his eyes fixed upon it, unable to advance another step.</p>
                  <p>It opened abruptly—quickly but noiselessly, and Nellie Seton's pale, tired face
                     looked out. At sight of him she came forward—he asked no questions—his eyes
                     looked at her full of a dumb agony of questioning she never forgot.</p>
                  <p>"Charley!" she exclaimed, coming nearer.</p>
                  <p>The first ray of the rising sun streaming through the windows fell full upon
                     her pale face, and it was as the face of an angel.</p>
                  <p>"Charley!" she repeated, with a great tearless sob, holding out both hands;
                     "Oh, bless God! the doctor says we may—<emph>hope!</emph>"</p>
                  <p>He had braced himself to hear the worst—not this. He made one step forward and
                     fell at her feet like a stone.</p>

                  <head type="sub">THE MORNING.</head>
                  <p>THEY might hope? The night had passed, the morning had come, and she still
                     lived.</p>
                  <p>You would hardly have thought so to look at her as she lay, deathly white,
                     deathly still. But as the day broke she had awakened from a long sleep, the
                     most natural and refreshing she had known for weeks, and looked up into the
                     pale anxious face of Trix with the faint shadow of a smile. Then the eyelids
                     swayed and closed in sleep once more, but she had recognized Trix for the first
                     time in days—the crisis was over and hope had come.</p>
                  <p>They would not let her see him. Only while she slept<pb n="406-407"
                        xml:id="VAC6448-00000203"/> would they allow him now to enter her room. But
                     it was easily borne—Edith was not to die, and Heaven and his own grateful happy
                     heart only knew how infinitely blessed he was in that knowledge. After the long
                     bitter night—after the darkness and the pain, light and morning had come. Edith
                     would live—all was said in that.</p>
                  <p>"There are some remedies that are either kill or cure in their action," the old
                     doctor said, giving Charley a facetious poke. "Your marriage was one of them,
                     young man. <emph>I</emph> thought it was Kill—it turns out it was Cure."</p>
                  <p>For many days no memory of the past returned to her, her existence was as the
                     existence of a new-born babe, spent alternately in taking food and sleep. Food
                     she took with eager avidity after her long starvation, and then sank back again
                     into profound, refreshing slumber.</p>
                  <p>"Let her sleep," said the doctor, with a complacent nod; "the more the better.
                     It's Nature's way of repairing damages."</p>
                  <p>There came a day at last when thought and recollection began to struggle
                     back—when she had strength to lie awake and think. More than once Trix caught
                     the dark eyes fixed in silent wistfulness upon her—a question in them her lips
                     would not ask. But Miss Stuart guessed it, and one day spoke:</p>
                  <p>"What is it, Dithy?" she said; "you look as if you wanted to say something, you
                     know."</p>
                  <p>"How—how long have I been sick?" was Edith's question.</p>
                  <p>"Nearly five weeks, and an awful life you've led us, I can tell you! Look at
                     me—worn to skin and bone. What do you suppose you will have to say for yourself
                     when Angus comes?"</p>
                  <p>Edith smiled faintly, but her eyes still kept their wistful look.</p>
                  <p>"I suppose I was delirious part of the time, Trixy?"</p>
                  <p>"Stark, staring crazy—raving like a lunatic at full moon! But you needn't look
                     so concerned about it—we've changed all that. You'll do now."</p>
                  <p>"Yes," she said it with a sigh; "you have all been very kind. I suppose it's
                     only a fancy of the fever after all."</p>
                  <p>"What?"</p>
                  <p>"I—Trixy! don't laugh at me, but I thought Charley was here."</p>
                  <p>"Did you?" responded Trix; "the most natural thing in life. He <emph>is</emph>
                     here."</p>
                  <p>Her eyes lighted—her lips parted—a question trembled upon them, but she
                     hesitated.</p>
                  <p>"Go on," said Miss Stuart, enjoying it all; "there's something else on your
                     mind. Speak up, Edie! don't be ashamed of yourself."</p>
                  <p>"I am afraid you <emph>will</emph> laugh this time, Trixy—I know it is only a
                     dream, but I thought Charley and I were—"</p>
                  <p>"Yes," said Trixy; "were—what?"</p>
                  <p>"Married, then!" with a faint little laugh. "Don't tell him, please, but it
                     seems—it seems so real, I had to tell you."</p>
                  <p>She turned her face away. And Trixy, with suspicious dimness in her eyes,
                     stooped down and kissed that thin, wan face.</p>
                  <p>"You poor little Dithy!" she said; "you <emph>do</emph> like Charley, don't
                     you? no, it's not a dream—you were married nearly a fortnight ago. The hope of
                     my life is realized—you are my sister, and Charley's wife!"</p>
                  <p>There was a little panting cry—then she covered her face with her hands and lay
                     still.</p>
                  <p>"He is outside," went on Trix; "you don't know what a good boy he has been—so
                     patient—and all that. He deserves some reward. I think if you had died he would
                     have died too—Lord Lovel and Lady Nancy, over again. Not that I much believe in
                     broken hearts where men are concerned, either," pursued Trix, growing cynical;
                     "but this seems an exceptional case. He's awfully fond of you, Dithy; 'pon my
                     word he is. I only hope Angus may go off in a dead faint the first time I'm
                     sick and get better, as he did the other day. We haven't let him in much
                     lately, for fear of agitating you, but I think," says Trixy, with twinkling
                     eyes, "you could stand it now—couldn't you, Mrs. Stuart?"</p>
                  <p>She did not wait for a reply—she went out and hunted up Charley. He was smoking
                     downstairs, and trying to read the morning paper.</p>
                  <p>"Your wife wants you," said Miss Stuart brusquely; "go!<pb n="408-409"
                        xml:id="VAC6448-00000204"/> only mind this—don't stay too long, and don't
                     talk too much."</p>
                  <p>He started to his feet—away went <title>Tribune</title> and cigar, and up the
                     stairs sprang Charley—half a dozen at a time.</p>
                  <p>And then Miss Stuart sits down, throws her handkerchief over her face, and for
                     the next five minutes indulges in the exclusively feminine luxury of a real
                     good cry.</p>
                  <milestone n="* * * * * * * * *" unit="typography"/>
                  <p>After that Mrs. Charles Stuart's recovery was perfectly magical in its
                     rapidity. Youth and splendid vitality, no doubt, had something to do with it,
                     but I think the fact that she <emph>was</emph> Mrs. Charles Stuart had more to
                     do still.</p>
                  <p>There came a day, when propped up with pillows, she could sit erect, and talk,
                     and be talked to as much as she chose, when blinds were pulled up, and sunshine
                     poured in; and no sunshine that ever shone was half so bright as her happy
                     face. There came still another day, when robed in a pretty pink morning-dress,
                     Charley lifted her in his arms and carried her to the arm-chair by the window,
                     whence she could look down on the bright, busy city street, whilst he sat at
                     her feet and talked. Talked! who is to tell of what? "Two souls with but a
                     single thought—two hearts that beat as one," generally find enough to say for
                     themselves, I notice, and require the aid of no outsiders.</p>
                  <p>And there came still another day—a fortnight after, when looking pale and
                     sweet, in a dark-gray travelling suit and hat, Mrs. Charles Stuart, leaning on
                     her husband's arm, said good-by to her friends, and started on her bridal tour.
                     They were to spend the next three weeks South, and then return for Trixy's
                     wedding at Christmas.</p>
                  <p>Christmas came; merry Christmas, sparkling with snow and sunshine, as Christmas
                     ever should sparkle, and bringing that gallant ex-officer of Scotch Grays,
                     Captain Angus Hammond—captain no longer—plain Mr. Hammond, done with drilling
                     and duty, and getting the route forever, going in for quiet, country life in
                     bonnie Scotland, with Miss Beatrix Stuart for aider and abettor.</p>
                  <p>Charley and his wife came to New York for the wedding. They had told Mr.
                     Hammond how ill Edith had been, but the young Scotchman, as he pulled his
                     ginger whiskers and stared in her radiant, blooming face, found it difficult
                     indeed to realize. She had been a pretty girl—a handsome woman—happiness had
                     made her more—she was lovely now. For Charley—outwardly all his easy
                     insouciance had returned—he submitted to be idolized and made much of by his
                     wife, after the calm fashion of lordly man. But you had only to see him look
                     once into her beautiful, laughing face, to knew how passionately she was
                     beloved.</p>
                  <p>Mr. and Mrs. Angus Hammond had a splendid wedding; and to say our Trixy looked
                     charming would be doing her no sort of justice. And again Miss Seton was first
                     bridesmaid, and Mrs. Stuart, in lavender silk, sniffed behind a fifty dollar
                     pocket handkerchief, as in duty bound. They departed immediately after the
                     ceremony for Scotland and a Continental tour—that very tour which, as you know,
                     Trixy was cheated so cruelly out of three years before.</p>
                  <p>Mr. and Mrs. Stuart went back South to finish the winter and the honeymoon
                     among the glades of Florida, and "do," as Charley said, "Love among the Roses."
                     Mr. Darrell returned to Sandypoint. Mrs. Stuart, senior, took up her abode with
                     Nellie Seton, pending such time as her children should get over the first
                     delirium of matrimonial bliss and settle quietly down to housekeeping. After
                     that it was fixed that she was to divide her time equally between them, six
                     months with each. Charley and his wife would make England their home; Edith's
                     ample fortune lay there, and both loved the fair old land.</p>
                  <p>In May they sailed for England. They would spend the whole of the summer in
                     Continental travelling—the pleasant rambling life suited them well. But they
                     went down to Cheshire first; and one soft May afternoon stood side by side in
                     the old Gothic church where the Catherons for generations had been buried. The
                     mellow light came softly through the painted windows—up in the organ loft, a
                     young girl sat playing to herself soft, sweet, solemn melodies. And both hearts
                     bowed down in tender sadness as they stood before <emph>one</emph> tomb, the
                     last erected within those walls, that of Sir Victor Catheron. Edith pulled her
                     veil over her face—the only tears that had filled her eyes since her second
                     wedding-day falling quietly now.</p>
                  <p>There were many remembrances of the dead man. A beautiful memorial window, a
                     sombre hatchment, and a monument<pb n="410-411 (Advertisement) "
                        xml:id="VAC6448-00000205"/> ument of snow-white marble. It was very
                     simple—it represented only a broken shaft, and beneath in gold letters this
                     inscription: <q>

            <head>CHARLES DICKENS' WORKS.</head>
            <head type="sub">A New Edition.</head>
            <p>Among the numerous editions of the works of this greatest of English Novelists, there
               has not been until now <emph>one</emph> that entirely satisfies the public demand. .
               . . . Without exception, they each have some strong distinctive objection, . . .
               either the shape and dimensions of the volumes are unhandy—or, the type is small and
               indistinct or, the paper is thin and poor—or, the illustrations [if they have any]
               are unsatisfactory—or, the binding is bad—or, the price is too high.</p>
            <p>A new edition is <emph>now</emph>, however, published by G. W. Carleton &amp; Co. of
               New York, which, it is believed, will, in every respect, completely satisfy the
               popular demand. . . . It is known as <hi rend="i"/>"Carleton's New Illustrated
               Edition."</p>
            <p>The size and form is most convenient for holding, . . the type is entirely new, and
               of a clear and open character that has received the approval of the reading community
               in other popular works.</p>
            <p>The illustrations are by the original artists chosen by Charles Dickens himself . . .
               and the paper, printing, and binding are of the most attractive and substantial
               character.</p>
            <p>The publication of this beautiful new edition was commenced in April, 1873, and will
               be completed in 20 volumes—one novel each month—at the extremely reasonable price of
               $1.50 per volume, as follows:— <list>

               <p>"Mrs. Holmes' stories are universally read. Her admirers are numberless. She is in
                  many respects without a rival in the world of fiction. Her characters are always
                  life-like, and she makes them talk and act like human beings, subject to the same
                  emotions, swayed by the same passions, and actuated by the same motives which are
                  common among men and women of every day existence. Mrs. Holmes is very happy in
                  portraying domestic life. Old and young peruse her stories with great delight, for
                  she writes in a style that all can comprehend."—<title>New York Weekly.</title>
               </p>
               <p>"Mrs. Holmes' stories are all of a domestic character, and their interest,
                  therefore, is not so intense as if they were more highly seasoned with
                  sensationalism, but it is of a healthy and abiding character. Almost any new book
                  which her publisher might choose to announce from her pen would get an immediate
                  and general reading. The interest in her tales begins at once, and is maintained
                  to the close. Her sentiments are so sound, her sympathies so warm and ready, and
                  her knowledge of manners, character, and the varied incidents of ordinary life is
                  so thorough, that she would find it difficult to write any other than an excellent
                  tale if she were to try it."—<title>Boston Banner.</title>
               </p>
               <p>"Mrs. Holmes is very amusing; has a quick and true sense of humor, a sympathetic
                  tone, a perception of character, and a familiar, attractive style, pleasantly
                  adapted to the comprehension and the taste of that large class of American readers
