               <p>IT was Autumn. The leaves were strewn over the Common. Those noble trees, which in summer time cast such a grateful shade, were nearly bare of their sapless foliage. October is a funereal month; it speaks so earnestly of death; it points to the dried-up leaf blown here and there and everywhere by the exulting breeze, and whispers to our ears the sad and sober lesson of nature's annual decay. Yet October is ever welcomed by those who love an honest, faithful teacher, and a friend that will not flatter. If it saddens, this is well; for sadness cometh as a joy to the heart that is not satisfied with what this life can offer for its love. And who of all created mind-after youth's novelties are past, and the truth is realized of what we are and may become through the elements of sin, unfolded by circumstance-will cry content, and claim that they are happy? Let us pass from the Common into a fine, well-swept avenue, which is lined with some of the most costly and tastefully-constructed edifices in the city. Wealth has centered here; there is an air of superiority in the locality striking to all beholders; envy is challenged, and what, oh, what would not the multitude give who pass and re-pass the streets which surround<pb n="6-7" xml:id="VAC6064-00000004"/> our beautiful Common, to live within its view,-to be of the aristocracy! They would be so happy then. They toil hard for a <emph>bare</emph> support; how much harder would they work if their labors would only insure them an elegant residence upon these aristocratic grounds. Having acquired such a position, they would be so, so happy. Indeed! Look yonder, where lies, at the foot of a flight of stone steps, a poor old man, who has just been kicked from the door by the irritable proprietor, a person in years, with the coloring matter of his hair quite gone. He had been asked for alms. The poor old beggar had sought bread, and received a stone. He might or he might not have deserved assistance; his feeble step, however, should have shielded him from a blow. Think you that retired merchant, with all his dollars, with all his aristocratic style, was happy? We think not; we think were he a happy man there would have been something better at his door than a kick for old age,-something more worthy a prominent citizen in a prominent place. No, he was not happy. He was proud, disdainful; he had grown old in administering to the passions of a mind which had never been softened by any actual faith in Christianity. It is true he was a patron of the ministry; he paid a certain sum for its support; but his affections were upon the things of this world, and not upon the glories of the next. There are many men who are pleased with the formality of public worship. The Sabbath is a day on which they cannot move in the business of the counting-house; so they resort to the house of prayer. The pew is a matter of custom with them, and having the pulpit supplied with a good-natured and mayhap eloquent divine, it is pleasant to hear in terms of classic beauty the Scriptural plan of salvation propounded, and the many noble texts of the Bible discoursed of, though it may be regarded all the while as an ingenious fable, by an attentive and prayer-bending congregation This is pleasant; it kills time, it consumes a day which otherwise would pass heavily; and above all it gains one the reputation of <emph>godliness.</emph> Our man of wealth loves reputation, and doubtless he would give handsome sums for notorious objects, that his name might waken a deep respect among those with whom it was his ambition to associate; that his person might command the deference of the educated as well as the vulgar. But he was not, he could not be happy, and of the two, the beggar and Dives, we are of the opinion that the poverty of the one, with its kicks even, was a greater blessing than the riches of the other, with all the consequence that style and large bank accounts could insure. It is not essential that a man should be rich, but it is essential that he should have a clear conscience, and be in fellowship with Deity through its personification in the flesh by Jesus Christ, who on Calvary looked down, through sweat, blood and tears, at men by whom an ignominious death was deemed a fit award for the guilt of love. Pope Adrian IV says, in his Philosophical Trifles, "I know no person more unhappy than the sovereign pontiff. Labor alone, were that his only evil, would destroy him in a short time. His seat is full of thorns, his robes stuck with points, and of an overwhelming weight. His crown and tiara shine, but it is with a fire that will consume him. I have risen by degrees," adds he, "from the lowest to the highest dignity in this world, and have never found that any of these elevations made the least addition to my happiness. On the contrary, I feel it impossible to bear the load with which I am charged." Petrarch, in writing to a friend, says, "I now experience the truth of what was told me, that to learn to live well is the most difficult of all arts. I would not exchange my repose for your labors and cares, my poverty for your riches. It is not that I despise your fortune; but if I were offered the same rank, nothing would persuade me to accept it." Happiness, then, is not glory, if these two great men are any authority, whose names are as imperishable as the human mind. A fashionable street, from whose superb residences aged beggars may be kicked with impunity, is in point of fact no more respectable than localities where, if the poor receive not alms, there is too honorable a sentiment to permit of abuse; and those who perchance may envy the rich and gaudy aristocrat should remember, happiness is not glory, but to be truly<pb n="8-9" xml:id="VAC6064-00000005"/> happy is to be really humble. "If the situation of man" says a sweet poet, <q>
                     <lg type="quotation"> 
                        <l>"Whose own genius gave the fatal blow,</l> 
                        <l>And help'd to plant the wound that laid it low,-</l> 
                     </lg>
                  </q> if man's situation in the present life be considered in all its relations and dependencies, a striking inconsistency will be apparent to a very cursory observer. We have sure warrant for believing that our abode here is to form a comparatively insignificant part of our existence, and that on our conduct in this life will depend the happiness in the life to come; yet our actions daily contradict the proposition, in as much as we commonly act like men who have no thought but for the present scene, and to whom the grave is the boundary of anticipation."</p> 
               <p>But to return to the poor old beggar, whom we left at the bottom of a flight of steps, from which just now he had been heartlessly kicked by a purse-proud, unmannerly fellow. He did not weep, that poor old beggar, for the experience of time had taught him that tears were of no avail. There was a low muttering, and that was all, as he walked feebly away.</p> 
               <p>An urchin was near by, whose appearance indicated a good deal of character. He had a firm step and a bright eye. He saw the inhumanity of wealth practised on helpless poverty. "Did he hurt you, sir, that bad man," said he, walking up to the beggar, with a marked anxiety in his countenance.</p> 
               <p>"No, good little boy," replied the old man, a tear coursing down his shriveled, bloodless cheeks; "himself he injured more."</p> 
               <p>"O, yes, he did so," returned the boy; "God will punish him for all he did to you. I am so sorry, sir, you should be obliged to beg; so old, so poor."</p> 
               <p>"Good boy, sweet boy," replied the beggar, unable to restrain the emotions of his heart; and taking the little fellow by the hand, he requested that he would walk with him.</p> 
               <p>They had proceeded only a short distance when they were met by a little girl, driving a press-hoop, who, perceiving ceiving an acquaintance in the urchin, stopped, and asked him, with a tender and somewhat embarrassed accent and manner, where he was going.</p> 
               <p>"This poor old man has been abused for asking charity," replied the boy, indignantly; "I wish I could help him."</p> 
               <p>"Good boy, blessed boy," muttered the beggar, in tones almost inaudible.</p> 
               <p>"I have some cents in my pocket, mother gave me to buy cake," said the little girl, "but you, good sir, shall have them, if you are poor." Then, swinging her hoop from her right hand to the left, she put her clean, delicate fingers into her pocket, and drew forth some coppers. "There, sir, take them; they are yours."</p> 
               <p>"No, no, my dear child," said the beggar, overcome by the girl's generosity; "please yourself with the money; buy cake, buy cake, as your mother told you."</p> 
               <p>"We are rich, sir," returned the girl. "I can get plenty more cents. Do, do take them, it will make me happy."</p> 
               <p>"Yes, take them, sir," spoke the boy. "Her father is real rich. He lives in--Square, sir, where the wealthiest people live. Do take the money, poor old man."</p> 
               <p>The eyes of the beggar, which till now had remained dull and passionless, began to brighten; and as the little girl pulled open his pocket, and dropped into it the coppers, they warmed with his better nature. He drew the children to his lips and kissed them fervently; then passed on, muttering a benediction on their heads.</p> 
               <p>"O, do not go sir, without us," said the children.</p> 
               <p>The old man halted. His face, which hard fortune had begrimmed with sorrow and stamped with despair, relaxed its wonted gloom, and the tint of joy was there.</p> 
               <p>"I want, sir, to know where your home is," said the boy, "so that I can go and see you when you are in want. My father is not a wealthy man, like this little girl's, but he is always good to the poor, and says I must be good to them too."</p> 
               <p>"Come, then, my dear little fellow," rejoined the beggar; "and may God Almighty bless your blood."</p> 
               <pb n="10-11" xml:id="VAC6064-00000006"/> 
               <p>The children and the old man walked off together. They had not gone far, when they were approached by an individual with a shuffling gait, a slight stoop, gray hair, and a countenance as hard as was his petrified conscience. He had grown rich, as most wealthy men do, by grinding the face of the poor, and running hard bargains with all those who happen to have any dealings with them. His manners were affable, but his soul was the concentration of meanness and pride. He could keep his carriage, but could not keep a clerk to collect his rents, and attend to the details of his affairs. His property was large, and the collection of his rents a business in itself. But doubtless he was himself a knave, and suspected knavery in all about him. This, reader, was the tender doting father of the good little girl who had given all her coppers in behalf of a distressed old man.</p> 
               <p>His eye no sooner detected his daughter in company with a beggar, and a boy whose appearance, though respectable, was not altogether satisfactory to the mind of Dives, than he seized her nervously by the hand, and hurried her from their company. "Never let me see you with a beggar or a vulgar boy again," sternly counseled our man of wealth. "Go home to your mother, at once."</p> 
               <p>"O, father, the old man is very poor and feeble. Give him a little change, won't you, father?"</p> 
               <p>"Hush!" <emph>returned this good Samaritan;</emph> "go home! I forbid your ever again being seen with a beggar. What boy was that?"</p> 
               <p>"Little Billy Andrews, father."</p> 
               <p>"Andrews, Andrews," returned the old rascal, somewhat disturbed. "What, his father must be Andrews the musician!"</p> 
               <p>"Yes," replied the girl, "his father is a musician, and Billy wants me to go to his house to hear the rehearsals."</p> 
               <p>"Don't you dare to go among such vulgar people," harshly replied the father. "If I ever find you in that company again, I'll punish you severely. Now, mind me. How many times I have cautioned you about street acquaintances."</p> 
                
               <p>"Billy is a good boy," sobbed the girl. "I wish I were as good."</p> 
               <p>"Hush crying," rejoined the father. "Run right home to your mother. Beggars and musicians' boys, indeed! I'll have you kept in the house altogether, if you've no more pride than to mingle with such company."</p> 
               <p>The little girl's heart seemed broken; she sobbed pitifully, as by her father's directions she took the street for home. He, with his face flushed with anger, and his head bent down, glided off to an opposite point. The beggar and the boy, in the mean time, had gone on their way, and we now find them at the door of a dilapidated wooden dwelling situated on a street at the west end of the city, which runs towards Charles River. They enter, and passing up a rickety stairway, dark and dirty, with a rotten, broken baluster, they are, in a moment, in the beggar's lodgings. The place was so strange, unnatural, so different from any the little boy had seen before, that a sense of insecurity came over him, as the old man shut the green, paint-worn door. He burst into tears, and begged that he might go; but the old man having succeeded in quieting his fears, he was content to set himself upon a stool, and listen to what the beggar might have to say. The room was small; it had an air of neatness; was well swept, and free from offensive odor; but it was entirely without furniture, save a pine chair and table, together with a tin plate, knife and fork, and a cot-bedstead. On the mantlepiece was a Bible which looked as though it had been well thumbed. Against the wall was tacked a print of the Crucifixion, and the head of John the Baptist delivered in a charger.</p> 
               <p>The beggar sat himself in the chair, apparently somewhat fatigued, and gazing steadfastly at the child, muttered, "Good boy, good boy; God bless you." Then, raising his voice, he inquired the age and name of his little friend.</p> 
               <p>"I am eight years old, sir, and my name is William Andrews, son of Richard Andrews, musician."</p> 
               <p>"God bless you, boy," said the old man, the tears streaming from his eyes; "you speak with manly promise. William Andrews, son of Richard Andrews, musician<pb n="12-13" xml:id="VAC6064-00000007"/> cian, eh? He has a treasure; yes, yes, a treasure! I know your father, little lad; he has bought books of me."</p> 
               <p>"O, you once kept a book-store, did you, sir?" said Billy, his eyes sparkling with delight at the thought that the old man had not always been so poor.</p> 
               <p>"No, not a book-store; I did not keep a book-store; no; but I peddled such literature as I could sell from door to door. I remember one day I was being rudely driven from the steps of a house in L--Street, by the servant, when a man of noble presence, from within bade her desist. He asked me into the house, pitied my hard fortune, and purchased of me a Life of Garrick. I thought him a good, kind man, and did not fail to look for his name upon the door. It was Richard Andrews. Then, befriended by the father; now, by the son;" and the old man, as he said this, was deeply moved.</p> 
               <p>"Don't cry, sir; we shall always be good to you," rejoined the boy, rising from the stool, and passing to the side of the beggar. "Don't cry. God is always careful of those who put their trust in him."</p> 
               <p>"So he is, my boy; so he is," returned the old man, trembling. "You must always love him. Had I been blessed with a good father, and kind, tender mother, my grey hairs would not require the protection they do. I should have been the equal, perhaps, of the proud man who kicked me from his door."</p> 
               <p>"Were your parents naughty people, poor old man?" earnestly inquired the boy, affectionately resting his hand on Throckmorton's shoulder, and gazing steadfastly in his face.</p> 
               <p>"Yes, dear child, they were very naughty," responded the beggar. "They cast me unprotected on the world, without religion or knowledge. I grew up a bad, reckless, thoughtless boy; and when I became a man I was qualified for no employment of honorable usefulness whatever. I was bad, very bad; grew to be criminal, and was put in prison. But God has been good to me, my child, in many ways, and I hope for pardon and acceptance through the blessed Jesus."</p> 
               <p>"Yes," returned Billy, "God will surely forgive you, if penitent; for in the Bible it is written, 'though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow.' He will forgive you, sir, if you love and fear him, and sin no more."</p> 
               <p>"Good boy!" exclaimed Throckmorton; "Heaven bless you."</p> 
               <p>"Tell me, poor old man, what most you need," said Billy, "and I will tell father all about it. He won't let you suffer."</p> 
               <p>"I want but little, child. Something to eat and drink," rejoined the beggar, "and clothes to keep my body warm is all I ask. Soon this little I shall not require."</p> 
               <p>"Won't you?" said Billy, with an expression of surprise. "How can you live without it?"</p> 
               <p>"I am very old, dear child," rejoined the beggar, "and soon must die. When dead, the things I now require will be no longer necessary."</p> 
               <p>"I wish you were young, like me," returned the boy; "I am so happy."</p> 
               <p>"The young have no <emph>past,</emph>" rejoined the beggar; "no <emph>past;</emph> but the aged, alas! have in that a frightful reality;" and as he said this a deep, long-drawn sigh bespoke the sorrow of his soul.</p> 
               <p>Some further conversation transpired, when the boy, having promised to visit the beggar often, left the lodging.</p> 
               <p>The beggar sat for some moments in his chair, with his eyes closed, apparently in profound abstraction. There was a nervous tremulousness of the lips, and an occasional twiching of the muscles of the face. The boy, as stated, had left the room. The tears began now to stream from the old man's eyes, as he muttered, "Good boy, good girl; God bless them. Would I were a boy again. The past, the past! oh, how it stings me! William Andrews, son of Richard Andrews, and Nelly Penniman, sweet little girl; those names the good angels have recorded. That I should come to this;-the care of children!"</p> 
               <p>The thought evidently was a painful one; for he sighed most pitifully. Old age is a period of life that has severe<pb n="14-15" xml:id="VAC6064-00000008"/> vere emotions, even to one who can look back upon life's voyage with least self-reproach, remorse, and condemnation. Before us is the judgment, the revelation of every secret which has escaped the vigilance of man; behind us that vast array of motives which make up the sum-total of our existence, in obedience to which we have acted, and sought out either noble and disinterested results, or selfish and irreligious ones.</p> 
               <p>Throckmorton was often melancholy. For days he would not leave his apartment; but with Bible in hand he pored over its inspired truth. He feared to die; miserable as was his condition in this life, he would cling to it rather than resign himself to what he suspected might be his punishment beyond the portals of the grave. He looked upon a life of eighty years, whose fruit was nettles; he felt that he had passed this weary waste of time to no end worthy of a Christian or a man; he knew unto whom little had been given but little would be required; yet there was an ever-wakeful consciousness he had buried that little, instead of improving it. Would such disobedience to his Saviour's commands be forgiven him? was an inquiry ever on the lips of his affrightened and grief-smitten conscience. There were times when his fears so clouded his mental scope that hope vanished, and darkness closed in upon eternity. He groaned for hours, and sweat profusely, in his agony, while this night of moral blight hung o'er him. He could feel its suffocating pressure; its cold, cold, icicled dews formed about his convulsed and furrowed brow. He looked at the world; it kicked and shunned him. He sought his Maker, but stumbled in the search. Into such a state of mind he had now fallen, and strangely too, on parting with good little Willie Andrews. The boy's innocence, contrasted with his own fell sins, had thrown him into a train of reflection which brought this fit of melancholy on. He was wretched, that poor old man, as he sat with his head bent down, the tears rolling from his cheeks. There is something profoundly sacred in all sorrow, but to see an old man mourn over a life misspent is among the deepest of human pains.</p> 
               <p>Besides Throckmorton, there were two or three other occupants of this dilapidated dwelling;-an Irish, a Scotch, and an English woman, whose means of obtaining support might be honest, for aught we know, but we should be slow to believe them on oath, if the face can be relied on for a judgment of character. More sensual, hard, reckless-featured women it would be difficult either for a poet-painter to imagine, or nature to devise. They were in a room under Throckmorton's, and were seated around a table where on was a jug of whiskey. Each had a pipe, and all were under the excitement of the liquor. To understand with any nicety of connection their broad Scotch and Irish brogue was utterly impossible; and the little English that was spoken was too coarse for repetition. We will, however, present a part of their conversation, that the reader's curiosity may not go entirely unappeased.</p> 
               <p>"To h-I wid ye," said the Irish woman, who had a dirty bandage over her left eye, as she wrested from the grasp of the English wench the jug of whiskey; "to h-I wid ye! and is it all the trate ye would be after putting into yar own dirty throat, yar ugly-faced thing, yar."</p> 
               <p>"You've had two swigs to my one, you greedy-gut," retorted the English woman, "and drunk enough ye are."</p> 
               <p>"It's yarself that's drunk, yar bloated daughter of the divil. To h-I wid ye, yar graduate of Bridewell."</p> 
               <p>"Come, I tell you what it is, my honey," returned the other, "I'll smash your mug for you, if you don't make less splutter." Thereupon she took from her mouth a clay pipe, and threw it with a good deal of force at the head of her assailant. She dodged; it struck the wall, and broke into several fragments. The Irish woman, conceiving herself much abused, seized, in a fit of violent rage, the whiskey-jug, which she was about to send at the head of her companion, when the Scotch woman, a fat, rubicund-nosed individual, caught her arm, and stayed the charge. "I canna," vociferated she, "let ye waste our grog! There's mair virtue, I trow, in guid whiskey than in both ye skins. Guidness! Wha<pb n="16-17" xml:id="VAC6064-00000009"/> could hae thought the like o' this? Na, na: I've twa drinks only; and I'll gae my life afore ye shall gae all to her."</p> 
               <p>The Scotch woman ran on with a lengthy remonstrance against throwing the whiskey at the English woman's head; not that she would save that piece of property from injury; for little cared she how soon, or in what manner it might be smashed. She had interposed in behalf of the liquor, which she finally succeeded in securing.</p> 
               <p>The quarreling was kept up briskly, and after a good deal of speculation about the boy Willie's visit to Throckmorton's room, they were startled by a heavy fall of something on the floor overhead. As it was an unusual noise, their attention, though in liquor as they were, was peremptorily challenged.</p> 
               <p>The English woman, by far the most sober and rational of the three, rose from her seat, and proceeded up stairs, to the old man's room. On opening the door, she found him stretched upon the floor. He had fallen in a fit. She grasped him by the arms, and lifted him rudely to the bed, with a terrible oath, and a fiendish indifference. This done, she dashed a mug of water in his face, and rejoined her companions below.</p> 
               <p>Throckmorton's situation did not appear to give the women the least uneasiness. They talked it over in a rude and vulgar way, seeming to think the beggar had lived long enough, and that it would be a lucky day's work for him to die. No one proposed to get a physician, or to administer the least relief to their suffering neighbor. He had fallen in a fit several times before, and recovered without ado. "So," said they, "he may come out of this in the same way."</p> 
               <p>It is a painful scene,-that of coarse ignorance, of heartless vulgarity; and those of us who have been blessed with kind, anxious parents, who shielded our early years from the rough treatment of strangers, and gave to us the advantages of a thorough intellectual training, by means of which the chance was ours to be useful in honorable positions, cannot be too willing to enter into the strifes of good men for the moral and social elevation of every being that bears an immortal soul, or too grateful that their lot is, instead of ignorance, penury, and crime, knowledge, influence, and plenty. In the great drama of life in which each one has a part assigned, the marked disparity of these parts, also that of the moral and intellectual players, is owing, perhaps, less to innate virtue and mental force, than to the aids of education and adventitious circumstances. If this be so, the vile, base-born, and thankless, should not be regarded with too stern a brow, or too unforgiving a temper, since their experience of life, together with their passions, may have prostituted them no more than would have been debased citizens "in purple and fine linen who fare sumptuously every day," had they been bred to the vices of poverty instead of riches. <q>

               <p>The kick of arrogant <hi rend="i"/>Dives and the sweet humanity of the boy Andrews are in striking contrast. We love the one; we pity the other. It is indeed a custom not to be encouraged, street begging; yet the really benevolent will never abuse beggars, however little disposed to befriend them. They are among us, and are God's creatures. Doubtless many of them have been vicious; perhaps all; hence their poverty; yet who will presume to say that the circumstances which may have controlled their lives did not absolutely prevent any other condition than that of poverty and crime. It should be the aim of every community organized on the principles of civil and religious liberty to institute such a system of relief for indigence as would clear our streets of beggary<pb n="18-19" xml:id="VAC6064-00000010"/> gary. Every community is bound by all honorable and moral principle, to assume the guardianship of those poor unfortunates whom circumstances have disgraced and rendered wretched. Work should be provided, and where they are too old and infirm to labor, a comfortable home should be in all cases assigned them.</p>

               <p>LET us return to Throckmorton, the old beggar, whom we left in a fit, upon his cot-bedstead, where he had been rudely placed by the drunken English wench who found him on the floor. By chance, early in the evening, and soon after the old man's fit came on, his trusty dog <hi rend="i"/>Bone, who had been absent for many weeks, and was supposed lost, came unexpectedly home. He ran as if mad to the bed of his master, whereon he jumped, and, stretching himself beside the lean, bloodless, and almost lifeless body of the beggar, began to lap his time-beaten face. The presence of the dog was as an angel's visit. Throckmorton, with the tears streaming from his dark-blue, sunken eyes, put his long arms around the shaggy neck of the animal, and kissed him with parental fondness. He had believed, as be fore stated, that the dog was lost, and that he would never more return. Now, that he had him by his side, his spirits revived, and he felt new life within him; for the old man had but one love on this earth, and that was his good, faithful friend and servant, Bone.</p> 
               <p>Bone was a knowing animal, possessing something more than instinct,-something even of the godlike reason of man. "It may be asserted," says Goldsmith, in his "Animated Nature," "that the dog is the only animal whose fidelity is unshaken; the only one who knows his master and the friends of the family; the only one who instantly distinguishes a stranger; the only one who knows his name, and answers to the domestic<pb n="20-21" xml:id="VAC6064-00000011"/> mestic call; the only one who seems to understand the nature of subordination, and seeks assistance; the only one who, when he misses his master, testifies his loss by his complaints; the only one who, carried to a distant place, can find the way home; the only one whose natural talents are evident, whose education is always successful."</p> 
               <p>Bone no sooner discovered, by his keen scent (which is to be attributed to the fact of the diffusion of the olfactory nerves upon a very extensive membrane within the skull), that his master was ill, than his joy was converted into grief, and he began to moan pitifully. His master did all he could to soothe him, but in vain. Presently, Bone leaped from the bed, and made his way to the street; then off he bounded to the office of the city physician, who had attended Throckmorton on several occasions. The dog remembered he had been with his master to the doctor's office, and by an association of relative ideas, he was able to act, in the present emergency, with all the directness and dispatch of human intellect.</p> 
               <p>Arriving at the physician's office, the dog began to howl and scratch lustily at the door. The doctor's notice was challenged; he no sooner perceived Bone, whom he knew very well, than he suspected, from his strange action, that something was the matter with his master. The dog crouched at his feet imploringly; seized the doctor by the clothes, pulling him towards the door; then, running into the street, in the direction of the beggar's lodgings, would stop to ascertain if the physician followed. The man of physic did not wait for any further demonstrations of the dog's wishes, for he understood well enough that Bone would lead him to some place where his services would be required. So he put on his hat and followed him.</p> 
               <p>On arriving at the bed-side of Throckmorton, he found him to be dying. It was doubtful if he lived through the night. Bone sat upon his hind-legs, with his eyes fixed on the physician's countenance, as if to learn from it something of his master's fate; but that face had long been rendered impassable by the practice of a profession sion which requires that it should be educated to the greatest possible immobility.</p> 
               <p>In the room below the beggar's, the drunken wenches still kept up a boisterous mirthfulness, totally indifferent to the old man's condition; whether he lived or died was quite the same thing to them; so that we have in a dumb animal more real affection and nobility of nature than in those stamped with the image of their Maker; having the promise, under the Christian dispensation, of an immortality of glory, if they will have faith in salvation, and do "unto others as they would be done by."</p> 
               <p>Throckmorton passed a sleepless night. His breath, with every respiration, growing weaker and weaker. His only watcher was Bone.</p> 
               <p>In the morning, early, came William Andrews, in company with a bright-looking miss, the daughter of a highly respectable tradesman, who lived not far from the residence of the Andrews. Willie had told her of the old man's poverty and distress, and she, having a ready sympathy, begged of Willie to let her accompany him to Throckmorton's apartment. The boy at once consented; for he loved so well a noble nature that he was ever willing to grant its requests.</p> 
               <p>The boy and the girl stood by the emaciated form of Throckmorton. He was happy to look upon their young, sweet, and open faces; yet he could give only a slight expression to his emotions, for he was nearly dead. Extending his long, bony hand from the bed, he placed it on the head of Willie, and invoked God's blessing on him and his young companion. Then, taking the boy by the hand, he clasped it in his own, and said, in a feeble and almost indistinguishable voice, "I am dying."</p> 
               <p>The dog still rested on his haunches, his dark, sombre eyes fixed upon his master's form. The children began to weep at the beggar's hopeless condition, which Bone perceiving removed himself to a corner of the room, and placing his head close in the angle began to cry pitifully.</p> 
               <p>"That dog," muttered Throckmorton, gasping for breath, "is a noble animal; and it is fit he should have<pb n="22-23" xml:id="VAC6064-00000012"/> a noble master. I give Bone to you-to you-to you-my sweet little friend, whose future years are full of honors." Willie was in tears. He spoke not. "Don't cry, my boy; don't cry," continued the sick man. "I am glad to go; and so-so-so will you-you-when time-time, does its wonted work. Yes-yes-you too-will-will be glad-to-die."</p> 
               <p>"Have you no fears?" timidly inquired the girl.</p> 
               <p>"Yes," replied the old man, promptly, and with all the energy of which he was capable, "many, many fears, but-but-in Jesus I have-oh!-I-I-have-hope."</p> 
               <p>The beggar now closed his eyes, and his breathing was so faint that Willie thought him dead. The little fellow was entirely unprepared for such a scene. It was a new position to him, and he was, in consequence, much agitated; but he bore himself like a man. He smothered, as much as it was possible in one of his extreme sensibilities, the sympathy the old man's poverty and forsaken condition naturally excited. He could not, however, repress his tears; for his emotions were those of genius: and if the reader would know what that is, we would say, not alone <emph>common sense, intent upon new ideas,</emph> as Madam de Stael has it, but something more, as expressed in immortal verse, by an English poet of the close of the last century,-the son of a <emph>butcher;</emph> which in the minds of many Modern Athenian snobs, no doubt is incredible,-that a poet could originate from so vulgar a source!</p> 
               <p>Thus the sweet and noble poet sings,-noble not in title, but in soul! <q>

               <p>Willie was a boy of the keenest sensibilities, and such a scene as was now before him could not fail to touch his warm and tender heart. It moved to deep sadness, likewise, the little girl, who stood silently beside the cot. The beggar looked at both the boy and girl, for a moment or two, with a most unnatural stare; then closing his eyes appeared to be in prayer, his breath growing fainter and fainter with each instant. At length he broke the silence: "My dear young friends, I am dying fast-fast. Take an old man's blessing,-a beggar's prayers, that-that you may both-both-be-be happy. Love one another, and remem-mem-ber, <emph>virtue</emph> is all worth stri-stri-ving for in life; and"-His strength was so reduced that he could not complete the sentence, but he made motions with his hands towards heaven, indicating that his thoughts were of that nature. He lay perfectly calm, his grey hair being gently pushed from his bloodless brow by the soft hand of Willie. Bone the while had sat quite motionless, watching alternately the countenance of his master and Willie, and, strange as some of our readers may think it, there were tears in that faithful dog's eyes. He seemed to know that the poor old beggar was going into another state of being; he seemed to anticipate and to feel profoundly his loss. A brute in tears! ay, reader, and they were tears more burdened with sorrow than half of human kind, and none the less acceptable because flowing from a brain in which were no deceit and no affectation. Bone was a treasure, and it was fortunate for Willie that his keeping had been confided to him. There is a rare pleasure in the possession of faithful servants, whether in the shape of brutes or humanity.</p> 
               <p>Bone, for the first time since Willie entered the room, removed himself from his fixed position, which at once attracted the notice of the children. Giving a most distressing howl, the poor disconsolate dog darted from the room.</p> 
               <p>Willie, turning to Throckmorton, found him dead! He had expired without a struggle or the least sign of pain. The boy fell upon his bosom and wept copiously. The little girl withdrew from the cot, and seated herself in an old cane-bottom chair, which had seen no slight service, and was altogether the worse for wear. Some little time elapsed before Willie fully recovered from the sad emotions which the death of the beggar excited, when, turning to his fair companion, he took her hand, and bade her follow him. "What," said she, "you would not leave the poor old man alone?"</p> 
               <p>"I must go and tell father that he is dead," rejoined Willie, "and that there is no one to bury him."</p> 
               <p>"And will your father <emph>bury</emph> him?" inquired the girl, with a sweet, innocent expression of girlish interest.</p> 
               <p>"Oh yes," returned Willie; "my father loves the poor, and helps them whenever he can. This old man I'm sure he 'll bury, as he has no friends."</p> 
               <p>He and the little girl now left the apartment. As they passed to the street, there sat at the window of a small wooden house opposite a beautiful girl, whose gaze was fixed intently on Willie. "Who is that?" in quired his friend.</p> 
               <pb n="26-27" xml:id="VAC6064-00000014"/> 
               <p>"They call her Agnes,"returned Willie. "Is she not beautiful?"</p> 
               <p>"She is, indeed;" replied the girl. "Ah, Willie, I am so sad." As she said this, she cast a look of marked dissatisfaction towards Agnes.</p> 
               <p>Just at this moment, Bone came running up, and soon made his presence known to his new young master. Willie escorted his fair friend to the door of her residence, and then directed his steps to that of his own. He informed his father of the beggar's death and destitution, and begged that he would see him well bestowed.</p> 
               <p>Mr. Andrews was a man of large benevolence, and, for one of his limited means, somewhat too liberal. His son's story affected him sensibly. He became at once interested in the beggar's cause, and decided to be at the expense of his burial. A neat coffin was ordered, a grave in one of the cemeteries adjoining the city was purchased, wherein the remains of the poor old beggar were deposited, under this inscription:</p>

               <p>LET us now turn to the Pennimans-the immaculate Pennimans, the incomparable, adorable, exclusive, indefinite, religiously inclined, and irreligiously inclined, God-defying, and church-going, out-spoken and in-spoken, clean and unclean-in fact <emph>the</emph> Pennimans of the great, the flourishing, the pretentious, and charming metropolis of New England, where sense and no sense, goodness and wickedness, Christianity and Paganism, are delicately and indelicately blended together-and where, above all things, hypocrisy and cant bear away the palm of popularity!-to their residence, grand and truly comfortable, built not with a view to <emph>catchpennies</emph>-no, no, it was no such an affair, but a good substantial piece of property. Look! on the steps is a little girl: it is Nelly-sweet little Nelly! the playmate of Willie Andrews, who with his youthful sweetheart, had had many a tumble in the grass on the Common, and many a race with hoop, and many a play at ball, and would softly say, "Nelly, dear, when we grow up, we'll be friends still-won't we; it is so mean to quarrel. I never will quarrel with you puss, no never! as I hope to die." There she is, this charming little one, with her eyelids swollen, and grief upon her countenance. Her father, it will be remembered, had treated her harshly for being seen in the company of a beggar and a strange<pb n="28-29" xml:id="VAC6064-00000015"/> boy, and had sent her straight-way home. Let us enter with the girl that costly mansion, much in contrast, to be sure, with the beggar's home we have just left; still none the less an honest home, for that. We shall not find the coarseness of the whiskey-women here, but something even worse: a pride and fashionable heartlessness, which make up a sum of sin the more unpardonable because they who make a merit of ungodliness have well-paid ministers who teach them that it is wrong.</p> 
               <p>Little Nelly had no sooner gone up stairs than she was met by her mother, a coarse-featured woman, with little to boast of personal attractions, unless it was her big nose and mouth. "You have been crying, Nelly. What's the matter? Come, I want to know what's the matter;" and as she spoke she took hold of the child, and drew her nervously to her side.</p> 
               <p>Nelly burst into tears, and said her father had been scolding her.</p> 
               <p>"What naughty thing have you done? Come, tell me instantly," commanded Mrs. Penniman, in a tone excessively imperious.</p> 
               <p>"He-he-he scolded me, because-be-cause-I-I-was with Willie Andrews and a beggar," whimpered the girl.</p> 
               <p>"Willie Andrews and a beggar!" returned the haughty and heartless mother. "My daughter in such company! Scold you; I'm only surprised he did not give you a good whipping, on the spot. Willie Andrews! And what family is this, pray? I know no such people. Beggars! What had you to do with beggars?"</p> 
               <p>"I met Willie with a poor old beggar-man, who had been kicked from a rich man's door," replied Nelly, snivelling. "He was very poor."</p> 
               <p>"Well, suppose he was," returned the mother, sharply; "what of that?"</p> 
               <p>"Why, I have heard our minister say," replied the child, still grieving, "that he who giveth to the poor, lendeth to the Lord; so I gave the old man all the cents I had to buy cake with-"</p> 
               <p>"You did?" interrupted the mother, her face flushed with dissatisfaction; "you ought to be ashamed of your folly. Well, if that's the use you make of your pocket-change, you 'll get no more until you acquire better sense. Who ever heard of such doings? I forbid you, miss, ever after this, either speaking or looking at beggars, or boys whose parents are not on visiting terms with me."</p> 
               <p>"Well, then I must not notice any more Lucinda McAlpine," rejoined the girl; and she began to cry heartily.</p> 
               <p>"O yes, notice Lucinda," returned Mrs. Penniman; "you may continue Lucinda's aquaintance. Don't cry, my dear; don't cry."</p> 
               <p>"You don't visit her, mother," returned Nelly, with her half-closed hand placed against her eye.</p> 
               <p>"No, but I should have no objections to," rejoined Mrs. Penniman. "They are very wealthy, and Mr. McAlpine is one of our first lawyers."</p> 
               <p>"Would they visit you, mama!" asked Nelly, with a sweetly innocent tone.</p> 
               <p>"You are too inquisitive, my child; much too curious," replied the mother, evidently not relishing a question which reminded her of fruitless endeavors to be on visiting terms with the Mc Alpines, who were people of substantial worth,-well-born, and well-bred. Mr. McAlpine and Mr. Penniman were distinct and opposite men; the one was a scholar, a gentleman, and a thorough business man; the other a sordid usurer, with a conscience as tough as an ox-hide, who had first acquired money by the tricks of trade, in goods denominated dry; then by loans on heavy interest, and every species of niggardly economy which a soul with narrow-limited views of morals and of happiness could devise. Such was Mr. McAlpine and Mr. Penniman; nor was the contrast of their better-halves any more creditable to snobbery. Mrs. McAlpine was a thorough-bred lady. Her mind was judiciously cultivated, and her heart was God's. Mrs. Penniman was a thorough-bred nobody-in-particular, with a mind stuffed with flummery, and a heart deeded to the world. Yet Mrs. Penniman longed to visit the McAlpines; while at the same time she would reprove her daughter for an acquaintance with the noble little<pb n="30-31" xml:id="VAC6064-00000016"/> Willie Andrews, and for charity to the poor old beggar. Indeed there is a pitiful absurdity in the action of every mind which has no just conceptions of its relations either to this state of being or that to follow; and the more prominent they are placed in a community, through a faculty for money-getting and money-changing, the more unfortunate it is for themselves and the interest of society. Such persons were the Pennimans. Little Nelly was a good, sweet child; but in the charge of foppery as she was, there could be little to hope in favor of her womanhood. It was necessary that she should be corrupted, in order to adapt her to the heartlessness of that life to which she was to be educated,-a life of self-laudation, idleness, and vanity. She was told to associate with none of her schoolmates whose parents were not on visiting terms with hers; and whenever little Nelly had a party, not one of this class was invited, notwithstanding they were all the children of highly respectable trades-people, and, as the world goes, quite honest enough. Their children were at the same school with Nelly, for an education, and her superiors in intelligence; yet they had forbade all <emph>friendship.</emph> This could not possibly be, because it was entirely out of the question to place the daughter of a dealer in dry-goods, real estate, and notes at usurious interest, upon a par with a dealer in calf-skins and ready-made boots and shoes. This was an equality which could not for a moment be tolerated, notwithstanding we are a democratic people, and striving after the perfection of social and political science;-notwithstanding we are prone to believe that all are born free and equal; that there should be no other distinction, no other cast but actual talent and usefulness; and it will be conceded that in the social scale there must be gradations, as there ever will be, on the basis of virtue, intellect, education, and industry.</p> 
               <p>Pretension, in its self-conceit and impertinence, admits of nor recognizes no superiors, but trains its sons and daughters, early in life, to an insolent bearing and to moral obliquity, in order to make sure of perpetuating its kind. So little Nelly was invariably checked in all the manifestations of her natural and noble impulses; taught, by a cold, meanly-calculating, inhuman mother, that her heart and conscience were no guides for her; but that she must be ambitious, and look with favor upon none below her plane, but hang to the skirts of all above.</p> 
               <p>Mrs. Penniman was, in the common acceptation of the term, "a very smart woman." She could push her way in the world with comparative ease, in whatever direction she might choose. With little or no sensibility, the shafts of ridicule were shot at her in vain. She had wealth "to go on," and with it she determined to out-face everybody. Nothing moved her; nothing disturbed her serene complacency. She had several daughters, but chance had given her no sons. These daughters were showy women; dressed expensively, and had a vast deal of their mother's worldly air. They had, through the manuverings of a fashion-struck mama, been all married off, save little Nelly;-one to a Mr. Artemas Bottlefly; another to Mr. Edward Roundhead (who, by the way, was a "devilish clever fellow"); and another to Jerry Donothing, who flourished on his "shape and talents," and the name of his honored father. They were all what are technically termed "young men of the highest standing,"-that is, they had rich fathers, and had received the education of gentlemen; but in all the essential qualities of <emph>men</emph> they were sadly deficient. They were fond of fast horses and fast women, and the et ceteras of a lazy, idle life.</p> 
               <p>These were the individuals whom Mrs. Penniman had selected for her daughters. She deemed such fellows all sufficient to insure their happiness; and who should know better than she what was, and what was not, to their advantage? The various members of her family, in the direct and collateral line, when gathered together on any occasion, made quite a glitter of snobbery; but they were profoundly unconscious of this, their true character. Everybody with rational views of life, and just conceptions of duty, laughed heartily at these people, in a quiet way, whilst they little suspected the "jokes cracked" at their pretension, and the immoderate<pb n="32-33" xml:id="VAC6064-00000017"/> rate mirth even of those with whom they were the most intimate.</p> 
               <p>Little Nelly was a great pet of the entire family, and, in fact, of all who visited the house; and as she was regarded by her ambitious ma as an attractive, smart girl, a "great match" was anticipated. No one with less pretensions than the son of a statesman would be at all acceptable. Mama was on the constant look out, and the late bad company in which her daughter had been found only tended to sharpen her vigilance over the girl. Mr. Penniman was a sort of Dolly, a character drawn most admirably in London Assurance, by Dion Bourcicault;-a kind of pack-horse, to do and to go just as Xantippe should decide. She had married for money a man much older than herself; and rule him she would. Old Penniman had no advantages of education, in early life. He was of humble parentage, and became so impressed, when a boy, of the value of money, that he apprenticed himself to a trader, and very soon was initiated into all the mysteries of traffic. Being of an industrious, plodding turn, he gradually "worked his way" into a credit, and set up for himself. By carefully saving all the pennies, he gradually accumulated a capital, and by lucky investments in real estate, at exceedingly low figures, together with a good paying trade, he grew to be a man of great wealth. As, however, he had devoted his entire energies to money-getting, he was utterly without taste for any pursuits of a more humanizing character. To talk to him of art, of the sciences, of philosophy, or of a subject not immediately connected with dollars and cents, was placing him at such a disadvantage as would mortify any person who might realize the meanness of their ignorance. But Penniman realized nothing of the kind. He was rich, paid heavy taxes; and this, with him, was a consideration paramount to all others.</p> 
               <p>Such, in brief, were the Pennimans, and such is the would-be somebodies of our "Modern Athens,"-the snobs. Nelly, sweet little Nelly, deserved a better fate than to be born to the care and training of these people. In other and more virtuous hands much might be expected pected of benevolence and genuine usefulness from her womanhood. How justly has Cowper in his Progress of Error written on this point: <q>

               <p>Having little to boast of on the score of ancestry, Mrs. Penniman was most desirous to ally herself to the McAlpines, through a marriage of her daughter Nelly with young James McAlpine, then in College at Cambridge. He was a good-looking genteel student, but by no means of more than average ability, and gave himself rather to the pleasures of society than to his studies. Still he was the son of Rolf McAlpine, M. C., and a lawyer of high standing. This was quite enough for mama, who instantly set her wits to work to devise a way to bring about an acquaintance and intimacy between the families.</p> 
               <p>Never at a loss for expedients to assist her own plans, Mrs. Penniman determined that her husband should in future give all his law business-which, by the way, was not inconsiderable-to the Hon. Col. McAlpine, instead of Peter Fletcher, who was a bachelor, and a highly moral one besides, a fact though not uncommon, is, nevertheless, we fear none too common. In this way she finally succeeded in establishing social relations with the McAlpines; for Penniman's business affairs being very extensive he had frequently to avail of counsel.</p> 
               <p>McAlpine found in the snob a good-natured and generous client, who never disputed the correctness of his fees. This Mrs. Penniman had most positively enjoined. So valuable a client the colonel was disposed to treat with a good deal of consideration; and perceiving from the social chat he often had with Penniman that it would be quite agreeable to his wife to visit Mrs. McAlpine, he gave Penniman to understand that he should be happy to have social relations to exist between the families.</p> 
               <pb n="34-35" xml:id="VAC6064-00000018"/> 
               <p>He had now made his point. His wife no sooner learned that she would be well received than she determined at once to call on Mrs. McAlpine, and thus open the game she had in mind to play for the young man whom she had selected for her daughter.</p> 
               <p>Nelly had conceived a strong attachment for Willie Andrews. They had often met on the Common, and were fellow-playmates. He had delighted her for hours with his wild, boyish glee. Especially was she pleased with his trig little man-of-war, which she frequently assisted him in sailing upon the pond. They played hoop and rolled in the grass together. Sweet was the innocence of their childhood.</p> 
               <p>Of this intimacy and affection, however, Mrs. Penniman was ignorant; and Nelly, knowing as she did her mother's contempt for the Andrews,-the father "being only a musician,"-was careful to conceal her attachment, and "to leave her mother entirely in the dark" as to the nature of their acquaintance and friendship.</p> 
               <p>As time wore on, the Cambridge student, James McAlpine, through the adroit management of Mrs. Penniman, came often to see Nelly, and was indeed quite charmed with her attractions. Nelly, under the instructions of her ambitious, unscrupulous parent, received his attentions with an apparent satisfaction, though she refused to love him, much to the chagrin and rage of mama. But Mrs. Penniman had determined that her daughter should marry McAlpine whether there was any love in the affair or not; and as often as James was repulsed in his addresses, the mother would the more encourage him to persevere. Willie possessed Nelly's heart, and no one, she thought, could please her so much as he. Never a day passed without their meeting or seeing each other. If the weather was too unpleasant to go into the street Willie would pass and repass the Pennimans' house until Nelly appeared at the window, from which she always slipped him a billet-doux, when it could be done with safety.</p> 
               <p>This intimacy was managed with so much skill that no one suspected the parties of any commerce whatever, after Mrs. Penniman had forbidden Nelly the acquaintance of Willie, as a "vulgar boy, and altogether beneath the notice of gentle-folks,-persons of quality."</p> 
               <p>The youth had inherited from his father a decided talent for music, and from his mother who was a woman of excellent education, and an artist of no mean pretensions, a genius for poetry and painting. Nelly was delighted with the boy's talent, and every chance that offered she was at Willie's house, to hear him play upon the piano-forte and to see him paint. He often wrote her poetry she was only too willing to receive.</p> 
               <p>All went well for a long time, until McAlpine happened one day to be passing by the residence of the Andrews, at the same time that Nelly in company with Willie, were coming from the house; but as the lovers were intent upon each other McAlpine escaped observation. He had heard of this Andrews family through Mrs. Penniman, and by "putting this and that together" he at once concluded he had discovered the reason why Nelly would not consent to betroth herself to him. "She was in love with this fellow" in whose company he had just seen her, and whom he rightly supposed to be the boy whose acquaintance she had been prohibited by her mother.</p> 
               <p>Here was a grand opportunity for an explosion. He had only, perhaps, to inform the haughty Mrs. Penniman of what he had seen, to bring matters into such a train as he would have them. Mrs. Penniman listened with amazement to James' disclosures, and made such a violent attack on Nelly's "shameful conduct," as she termed it, that from that time her intimacy with Willie ceased. It was a desperate struggle between love and pride. Willie was very dear to Nelly; but all her acquaintances were constantly laughing at her for having been the associate of "low people," and her parents declared they would disown her "if she ever spoke or looked at the vulgar boy again."</p> 
               <p>With no one to sustain her in her preference for Willie, and a cold, distant manner on his part, when he found she grew less willing to do as he wished, the girl, pressed by the attentions of the handsome dashing<pb n="36-37" xml:id="VAC6064-00000019"/> McAlpine, relaxed in her first love, and began to be taken up with a second.</p> 
               <p>Willie was a proud-spirited boy; and when he understood from his father the foolish notions of the Pennimans, and the contempt in which they held everybody who were in humble circumstances, he instantaneously resolved, though he loved Nelly dearly, to associate with her no longer, unless as an equal. This, however, could not be, and hence the coolness and final discontinuance of their friendship and love. Nelly had been corrupted under the combined influence of pretension. She was another creature, now that she had overcome her passion for Willie. Her simplicity and genuine warm-heartedness had given way to the flippancy and ostentation of fashion.</p> 
               <p>McAlpine was a gay, proud, college student, imbued with all the absurd, false views of life, which are quite inseparable from the early years of even the most rational soul. He, too, felt a degree of contempt for persons whose means are insufficient for display. Nelly having promised herself to him in marriage, he succeeded, without much difficulty, in establishing in her mind all that was false and puerile in his own. He would talk to her of the combined wealth and influence of their respective families, and the necessity they were under of supporting handsomely the advantage they derived from being of the aristocracy. They must assume the dignity and exclusiveness of the circle to which they belonged; they must exist not for any useful end, but simply for the gratification of those ridiculous feelings, which are so well pleased with the liberty of trifling away a life time in fancied superiority over that absolute intellect, in its several degrees, which makes no pretensions, but toils on, as the only means of happiness and the chief among earthly duties.</p> 
               <p>Young McAlpine, after the completion of his college course, had determined to study the <emph>law,</emph> little knowing of, or indeed caring about, the labor involved in the mastery of jurisprudence. It was necessary for a gentleman to be of the "learned professions;" so he chose the law.</p> 
                
               <p>It was an unfortunate ambition in him to desire the membership of the Bar; for he had neither the talent nor industry to rise above the pettifogger; and of this class of mean lawyers Heaven knows we have full enough throughout the country,-"limbs of the law" much better lopped off than retained on the noble, hale old tree of jurisprudence. Law, to the most comprehensive and patient mind, is of most difficult grasp. What, then, must it be to a brain incapable of acute analysis and strict method. Such understandings never can rise above the simple routine of practice; and doomed to live in the ever-present consciousness of their want of intellectual power, they are too apt to become the worst of citizens, and ready at all times to foment disputes among their fellow-men. It is this class of practitioners that led Jeremy Bentham to say of the legal profession, in his second Letter to the Court of Torento,-"If there is a class of men whose personal interests are in constant, necessary, and direct opposition to the public interest, it is the class of lawyers. The glorious uncertainty of the law;-that is the source whence they draw all the profits of their profession; this is the treasury which supplies them with delays, money, and reputation. <emph>The more difficult justice is to be got the dearer it will sell.</emph> It appears, at the first glance, that the necessary influence of the trade which these men exercise is to inspire them with a profound indifference as between justice and injustice, right and wrong, since it is their business to hire themselves out to defend one or the other by turns. But when we come to look at the matter more closely, it is wrong which pays them best, because the success of that depends more upon their good offices than the successful right, and of course the side of injustice is that which they prefer. The Neapolitan assassin sells his arm and his dagger, receives his pay, and risks his life. The advocate at the bar sells his words, receives his money, and risks nothing. Nay, more, a perverse and senseless multitude follow him with shouts, as they would a conqueror, and applauses shower on his head in <emph>proportion to the mischief that he does.</emph> If there is a profession which trains its members<pb n="38-39" xml:id="VAC6064-00000020"/> to do evil and to avoid the punishment of it, it is this. If there is a profession which by the habits of gain acquired by sustaining indifferently truth and falsehood, effaces from the soul all sincerity, <emph>all love of truth, it is this!!</emph> If there is a profession which teaches a man, by the constant practice of his life, to sell his faculties to the highest bidder to say anything and everything, to accuse everybody and to defend everybody for hire, to let himself out body and soul to the employer who pays best, and consequently to be always ready to sacrifice for the slightest profit the interest of the greatest number, it is <emph>the trade of the lawyer.</emph>" A sad estimate of law is this of <emph>Jeremy Bentham;</emph> yet who will presume to gainsay its correctness. Jurisprudence in the abstract, or ideal, is one thing; in the practice it becomes quite another. The student feels this deeply, and, if he has an honest mind, heartily laments that there is not a better, more reliable medium between man and man, by which his action shall be guided and governed.</p> 
               <p>Mrs. Penniman having secured McAlpine, her next step would be to hurry on the marriage, as no one knew better than that shrewd, politic mother, the many slips there have been between the cup and lip. The wedding was to be a magnificent affair. Every one who had the good fortune of Mrs. Penniman's acquaintance was to be invited; so, too, were all the literary lions and men of genius with whom the Mc Alpines had a general intimacy. It was to be a very recherch affair. There was to be present none save persons of the <emph>highest quality.</emph> The proud Mrs. Penniman despised most heartily the <emph>villainous canaille;</emph> which included, to her mind, all with whom she considered it would be beneath her dignity to associate. The wedding was to be a grand affair. Nelly longed to be a bride, and James thought it would be such a pretty thing to marry; to have a wife and family; to be a father! and Nelly, too, was so anxious to be a mother! If she could only have a little boy of her own she should be so delighted.</p> 
               <p>This passion for babies is certainly very innocent, and it is not to be wondered at the young and sanguine look forward to a great deal of pleasure with these little ones; but we fear time brings, too often, a grief attendant on the death or moral depravity of these creations which calls up deep regret that such frail possessions have been desired or obtained. We are not over cynical, but we would avoid all possible sorrow, and keep the heart as cheerful as human wisdom will permit; for cheerfulness is the greatest of blessings;-it is meat, and drink, and clothing. One can live upon it; it is a substitute for everything else. With it the possessor has all that he wants; and without it he is a miserable beggar; for he has nothing that he desires. It is money in bank to a man; for though he has ever so little money, he has all he wants, because he can do very well without more. It is a thermometer by which the temperature of the feelings is regulated. One is cold, the other is hot, because one is cheerful, the other is not. A cheerful temper has the great advantage of always seeing the bright side of every object. It is a friend of the virtues, and a sworn enemy to vice. David Hume pronounced a cheerful temper to be worth a thousand pounds a year. The easiest way to be rich, therefore, is to have such a temper. Cheerfulness being so valuable a possession, it is indeed strange that so few comparatively are in the enjoyment of its blessings, especially when it may be had on most reasonable terms. The Pennimans,-and by this expression we mean all the daughters and sons in law,-notwithstanding their riches, were far from cheerful. They were too proud and dignified to be ever in right good cheer. If one would be light-hearted and happy he must not be immoderately selfish, or insufferably haughty.</p> 
               <p>Scarcely anything was talked of, now, by Nelly's family and acquaintance, but the marriage and splendid wedding party. Presents of the richest and most costly character were expected, and all was to go merry as the marriage bell.</p>

                        <l>"Its richest, rarest fruits of bliss,</l> 
                        <l>Are plucked on danger's precipice,"</l> 
                     </lg>
                  </q> we are told, by a noble poet of Ireland. Rauch, in his "Psychology and Anthropology," says, it is the devotion of one person to another: the surrendering of the independence of our existence, and desire to become self-conscious, not in ourselves only, but especially in the consciousness of another. In such we seek ourselves; we desire to be acknowledged and received with it. The consciousness of such we desire to penetrate, to fill with our person all their will and knowledge, all desires and wishes. Then they live in us, as we live in them. Thus both are identical, and each lays his whole soul into this identity. Love is therefore ennobling; for loving, we do not belong to ourselves, but to those whom we love, as they belong to us. Whatever cannot be drawn within this circle of our love, leaves us indifferent. Especially in female characters is love most beautiful; for with them this devotion, this surrender, is the highest point, as they centre their intellectual and real life upon this feeling of love, in it find their only hold on life; and if misfortune touches it, they disappear like a light which is extinguished by the first rough breath.</p> 
               <p>This subjective tenderness of feeling is not found in the classic art of Greece, where it appears only as a subordinate ordinate element for representation, or only in reference to sensual enjoyments. In Homer, either no great weight is placed upon it, or love appears in its most worthy form, as marriage in the domestic circle,-as, for instance, in the person of Penelope, or as the solicitude of a wife and mother in Andromache, or in other moral relations. The tie, on the other hand, which attaches Paris to Helen, is acknowledged as immoral, and is the cause of the terrors and misfortunes of the Trojan war; while the love of Achilles to Briseis has little depth of feeling; for Brisies is a slave, and at the disposal of his will. In the odes of Sappho the language of love is raised to lyric inspiration; yet it is more the lingering, consuming fire of the blood that is expressed, than the warmth of feeling and the emotions of the heart. In another respect, love, as expressed in the delightful little songs of Anacreon, is a cheerful, general enjoyment, which, without suffering, without struggles, and without the resignation of an oppressed and longing heart, joyfully seizes the immediate pleasure, not regarding it as necessary to possess this object of affection, and no other. Neither does the noble tragedy of the ancients know the inclination of love in its romantic significance. Especially with chylus and Sophocles, it does not claim any particular interest; for though Antigone is destined to be the wife of Hmon,-though Hmon defends her before his father, and even kills himself because he cannot save her,-he speaks before Creon only of objective relations, and not of the power of subjective passion, which in fact he did not feel, in the sense of a modern, passionate lover. Euripides makes use of love as an essential pathos, in his Phedra; yet there it is represented as a criminal aberration of blood,-as a passion of sense,-as instigated by Venus, who desires the destruction of Hippolytus, because he will not bring sacrifices to her. So we have, in the Venus de Medici, a beautiful image of love; and nothing can be said against its neatness and plastic execution; but the expression of internal warmth and life, as modern art demands it, is wholly wanting. The same is the case in the Roman poetry, when, after<pb n="42-43" xml:id="VAC6064-00000022"/> the dissolution of the Republic, and of the regidity of moral life, love degenerated more or less into sexual enjoyments.</p> 
               <p>Petrarch, on the other hand, though he wrote his sonnets for amusement, gained his immortal reputation by the fancies of his love, which, under the warm Italian sky, connected itself, in the depths of his heart, with religion. Dante's exaltation also proceeded from his love of Beatrice, which, rendered sublime in him, became a religious love; while his boldness and bravery were transformed into a religious institution of art, in which-what no one else would venture-he made himself the judge of all men, and consigned them to hell, to purgatory, and to heaven. As a contrast to this exaltation Bocaccio represents love partly in vehemence as a passion, partly as stripped of all morality, making, in his various novels, the morals of his age and country pass in review before our eyes. In the German <foreign xml:lang="DEU">minne-song,</foreign> love is full of piety,-tender, without richness of imagination; playful, melancholy, monotonous. With the Spaniards it is full of imagination in its expression, knightly, subtle in seeing and defending its rights and duties, as a matter of honor, and fanatical in the time of its highest splendor. With the French, especially in latter times, it becomes gallant, inclining to vanity,-a forced feeling, created by sophistry,-a kind of sensual enjoyment, without passion, or passion without enjoyment,-a feeling and sentimentality full of reflections.</p> 
               <p>Sexual love is founded on a tendency of nature, which, divided between two of different sexes, draws them irresistibly yet mysteriously towards each other, and makes each other feel that it cannot find its completion in itself, and must seek for it in another. This love is pure and noble when it is called forth by love. The purest love is the effect of the most perfect external beauty in its union with an equally perfect internal beauty of the heart. It calls forth noble and delightful feelings in ourselves, silences every desire, and renders us happy by its presence. It is a perfect union of the most beautiful in us with the most beautiful out of us. Its removal leaves a void in the heart; we are drawn after it. This is the case with all lovers. Every one considers his love the fairest, most beautiful, most virtuous of all that ever lived. If personal beauty is wanting, other charms will compensate for it, or make the lover overlook the deficiency. Sexual love is the bloom of our intellectual and bodily life; and as the flower reveals by its color and fragrance the life of the plant, so love will render manifest the ideal of beauty and loveliness, and the kind of life which a person conceals within himself. Again, love is the intellectual and physical development of youth; for it is the joint product of imagination and fancy, and of bodily vigor, and freshnes of nerves and muscles, all of which have arrived at the stage of maturity. If love induces us to seek for all that is noble and beautiful, in order to adorn with it the object of love; if we desire to seek for honor and every virtue, to lay it at the feet of the beloved one; if we long for nothing more than the entire union of soul with soul,-then our love is noble, and the being of whom it is the blossom must be so likewise. Such love excites us to virtuous and magnanimous actions; and many a youth of amiable qualities, but who was exposed to dangers, has been rescued by love, and raised by it into the sphere of beauty and nobleness, from that of sensual enjoyments. In sexual love, now, if it is to be pure, <emph>love</emph> must be the only object desired; not <emph>money,</emph>-not mere external beauty. Such love will desire its preservation, and this it can obtain only by a permanent union, which is marriage. Marriage is the external representation of the internal union produced by love between man and woman, and sanctioned by the usual ceremony. Husband and wife are truly one. The interests and wishes of the one are also those of the other. They enter so wholly and entirely into each others feelings, views, and desires that they seem to have but one thinking power. Genuine marriage cannot, therefore, be produced by a mere ceremony, but must have its possible existence in love. <emph>Yet what is once joined together, let no man put asunder, and hence the choice is short, and the regret is long.</emph>
               </p> 
               <p>It follows, therefore, that true love renders monogamy<pb n="44-45" xml:id="VAC6064-00000023"/> indispensable, as that polyandry or polygamy are wholly unnatural. We can exchange our <emph>self</emph> but once, and receive but one <emph>self</emph> in exchange for it. And here is the point, too, on which it must appear possible that love may become a passion. For as we cannot love every one, but must naturally be limited in our choice, the idea may take hold of our mind, after we think we have found the person, that he or she, and no other in the world, is the one whom we can love. Centering our affections upon such, it seems wholly impossible to us that we should be able to love any other. If, now, impediments are thrown in our way,-if we fear the loss of one love, and know that no reparation can be made to us,-our love will be changed into a transient or permanent passion.</p> 
               <p>These impediments in the way of love are either external, or they are contained in one of the lovers, and may be termed internal. The external proceed from the world around us,-from its manners and views,-from the family spirit, its interests,-from laws and prejudices, and the prose of life. The lovers think of nothing but their love; they are satisfied with it. Yet man is not to live to his feelings only; he has duties to perform, and to honor the many relations in which he finds himself. Thus a collision between his love and his duties may easily take place. Among these possible collisions none is more frequent than that of <emph>honor.</emph> This may demand the resignation of love, merely because the two are not of equal rank. This opposition will only strengthen the power of love; and instead of yielding to the suggestions of honor, it becomes so irresistible as rather to sacrifice life than to yield to any obstacles. Again, the will of parents, family duties, duties towards the country, or faithfulness to a vow, may interfere with love; and here again it will become passion. Now, it may be that this passion overcomes all difficulties, and effects its final union, or that the person acknowledges the power of these objective rights and duties, and struggles silently with himself and the power of his own passions. On the latter passion the play of the Maid of Orleans, by Schiller, rests. Very often, as said already, it is the prose of life,-intrigue, prejudices, and the like, that oppose love, determined to destroy the fairest prospects. In this case, also, love becomes a passion, and we ask every sacrifice to conquer difficulties. If the difficulties will not yield, if all daily grows darker, love may be driven to <emph>suicide, or terminate in insanity.</emph> The internal impediments are always to be sought for in the lovers themselves. Here it may be that love on the part of one has never fully developed itself. When, now, the other demands the exclusive possession of the love of the first, and when he feels that this is not fully given,-that perhaps a third receives as much attention as himself,-he will become passionate, and his passion will be jealousy. When love is pure on both sides, all fear is banished. It is often a feeling of weakness,-a feeling that we do not deserve the possession of the love of the other, that causes this fear. So Othello is certain of Desdemona's love, he fears nothing. Iago cannot succeed, at first, in filling his heart with suspicion, until he mentions his age, his dark color, &amp;c. From that moment suspicion is ripe in Othello's breast.</p> 
               <p>Love may become a transient passion, when the greatness of the new feeling, the darkness of the relations that are yet indistinct, the late youthful pride which is now to surrender, to confess itself conquered, embarrassed. Love would not betray itself, and betrays itself by this very wish for concealment. It desires to meet the beloved, and trembles or flees when he or she approaches. It seeks solitude to give free course to its tears, and keeps secret from others what moves the heart. It does not venture to pronounce the name, but it finds circuitous routs to hear from its beloved object. So love may become a transient passion in a moment, when, after we have secretly anticipated a kind reception from the person in whom we are interested, we receive a distinct and marked sign of it, one that can no longer be misinterpreted. The passion of love is one of the most painful. The object appears to him who is under its influence as the only possible one he could choose; a certain fatality, a necessity against which he strives in<pb n="46-47" xml:id="VAC6064-00000024"/> vain, chains him to this one, which is in his eyes most perfect. Without him or her the passionate lover does not expect to enjoy life, or to become happy in any way. Hence the most bitter feeling of an irreparable loss constantly agitates the breast, and presents nothing but misery. Love, as alluded to, may mitigate and even expel other passions, but when once a passion, it cannot itself be rendered less strong by any other inclination. It is too certain of its loss; it feels that no reparation can be made,-that it must carry its grief with it forever. Dante writes, in the Inferno: <q>

               <p>"It is to Laura," said the great Italian, Petrarch, "<emph>I owe what I am.</emph> Never should I have obtained my present reputation and glory if the sentiments with which she inspired me had not raised those seeds of virtue which nature had planted in my soul. She drew me out of those snares and precipices into which the ardor of youth had plunged me. In fine, she pointed out my road to heaven, and served me as a guide to pursue it."</p> 
               <p>The influence of Laura over Petrarch, through the instrumentality of love, is among the noblest records of the human heart. This truly delightful sentiment, when properly considered,-we mean the sentiment of love,-is more or less active with all mankind; and whatever relates to it, in prose or verse, in truth or fiction, hath a universal interest, more or less marked in individuals viduals as their experiences of life, habits of thought and action, have tended either to refine and elevate their moral faculties, or to sensualize and debase them.</p> 
               <p>Willie Andrews, like most youth of his warm, impulsive nature, had no sooner parted with one sweetheart than he availed of another. Nelly Penniman, whose heart he once possessed, could never again interest him. She had forsaken him for another; she had, at the instigation of her friends and haughty lover, ceased to notice him; in a word, she had come to think the Andrews family <emph>plebeians,</emph> and to regard all <emph>such</emph> people with contempt. Acquaintances, to be acceptable to Miss Nelly, must have a certain air, and live in marked style. They must derive their incomes from rent-oppressed tenants, or through the higher professions, such as preaching the gospel to the rich, on a heavy salary; vending law, on fat retainers; physic in the same ratio, and merchandizing on an extensive scale of profits, derived through salesmen skilled in deception and falsehood. These were the individuals, these the families with whom the Pennimans might be willing to associate; still, this was not all which constituted complete eligibility to the society of these people. There must be <emph>ancestry</emph> also,-<emph>family;</emph> yes, reader, the Pennimans were republicans, but in making acquaintances their respect was fully challenged only where there was <emph>family.</emph> Yet, perhaps, on the score of a truly honorable pedigree, there was no name throughout the city, with any pretensions to respect, that had less to do with heraldry. Yet the Pennimans had their <emph>coat of arms,</emph> and talked much of their genealogical tree, which through force of imagination had come to be regarded by them as an important historical fact. Their genealogical tree was, from root to branch, an ordinary species of vegetation, such as might be looked for from the most rotten seed of the old English villinage. As to their coat of arms, it was a distinction which any one may assume whose name, or similarity of name, is to be found in heraldry.</p> 
               <p>We have no objection to either of these honorable associations of the past being held in the highest regard, by those who have a clear title to them. Indeed, republicanism<pb n="48-49" xml:id="VAC6064-00000025"/> licanism, and no other <emph>ism,</emph> should be a barrier to family pride based upon an illustrious ancestry, or one simply honorable; and if it is asked what is intended by simply honorable, we reply respectability and skill in all industrial professions, requiring more than an average amount of mind for success. There is something truly ennobling in a rational attachment to the past, and a love for the memory of those by whom we are connected with it; and a coat of arms when not mere pretence, a genealogical tree when not a base fiction, should have a value to those by whom they are represented above all price; because they are the insignia of <emph>character,</emph> which is <emph>priceless.</emph>
               </p> 
               <p>Mrs. Penniman "had married off her daughters," as the phrase is, "to please herself," to gratify her ambition; she had given them to individuals whose only recommendation was rich and honored fathers. Thrown upon their own resources, without the adventitious aids of wealth the fruit of others labors, they would have found their level far below the condition of the humblest orders of society, which, in their fancied superiority, were looked upon with ineffable contempt. Yet these were the individuals Mrs. Penniman had manuvered and worked lustily to secure for her fashionable, proud, and not any too intelligent daughters;-these were the "sprigs of aristocracy" to whom such noble and manly natures as Willie Andrews were to give way.</p> 
               <p>The ambition in every one to improve his or her condition, either by intellectual training or the aids of marriage alliances, is commendable; and all honorable, dignified means are justifiable to promote the end; but where we see unprincipled women, wedded to men for no motive but ostentation, deeding away their children to incompetent characters, from false notions of respectability, we cannot but pity the weakness of such parents, and lament the fate of their children. A "highly respectable family," whatever its wealth, whatever the heroic deeds of its ancestry, can confer, simply by these considerations, no merit upon a son or daughter, nor add one particle to their influence in the social scale, if they lack the virtues by which their family name was won, namely, industry, talents, or genius, courage and perseverance. Persons whose importance rests almost entirely on "style," and the parade of wealth generally, not feeling at all satisfied with their genealogical tree, seek to make up this deficiency, and thus to establish a harmonious whole. Thus Mrs. Penniman came to encourage the attentions of young men to her daughters who were, in her estimation, calculated to improve the Penniman breed; but before our tale shall be ended, we shall see how false are such ideas, and ruinous to the peace and happiness of those who are their victims.</p> 
               <p>With women of Mrs. Penniman's cast of mind, <emph>love</emph> is a fable; ambition and a desire of ostentation lay waste their hearts; there is nothing in life which interests them but clap-trap, ceremony, humbug, and pretension. They do not know what power a noble nature has to attach to it its species,-even the humblest of servants to its interest. Devoid of all generous impulse themselves, they think mankind without a heart, without a conscience, and without a God!</p>

               <p>THE Pennimans were preparing for a grand ball, to be given in honor of their daughter's nuptials, previous to her departure for Europe, in company with her liege lord, McAlpine. They were about to be tied together at one of the fashionable churches, where the pulpit is gagged by the pride of wealth suspended over it <foreign xml:lang="LAT">in terrorem.</foreign> A person was stationed at the door to keep out all those who were not of the "F. F. V.,"-a hard visaged, brawny hackman, who had been long employed to wheel about these "sumptuous bodies." It was to be a very exclusive, private, aristocratic affair,-a tempest-in-a-tea-pot sort of a doing, at which all sensible people laughed, and the angels wept.</p> 
               <p>There were a number gathered about the church, awaiting the arrival of the bride and groom, since having been denied the privilege of entrance within, they were determined to have a "good look" without. The two popinjays who were stationed in the entry of the splendid church, now and then pulled open the door, impatient at the long delay of the lovely twain that were to be made one flesh. Casting a contemptuous stare at the persons in waiting without, they shut the door with an angry air, that the <emph>mob,</emph> the <foreign xml:lang="FRA">canaille,</foreign> should manifest any interest whatever in their matters. After the patience of nearly every body had been exhausted, not excepting the meek-looking, clean-shaved minister, a private carriage was driven up to the church, freighted with the anxiously expected couple. The crowd pressed around it, only the more desirous to see what apparently was so precious; and when McAlpine and his lady alighted there was quite a titter among some of the bystanders, who were pretty keen witted, that a boy and a girl, with nothing to boast of but gayly decked persons, should draw together such an audience. McAlpine was a sap, and his betrothed was only too well suited to his caliber.</p> 
               <p>Willie Andrews had many friends and acquaintances, all of whom were aware of the circumstance of his dismissal, and many of whom had come to the church, through curiosity to see the "gay gallant," who had found so much favor with this child and daughter of mammon; but neither Willie nor Ida were there. It was an affair which had no interest for them, and therefore they gave it no thought.</p> 
               <p>As Nelly stepped from the carriage, supported by the gloved hand of her lover, there was an evident embarrassment, and the lively red of her cheeks gave place to a striking pallor. McAlpine was by no means as self-possessed as the occasion required. It was evident they were not prepared for such a demonstration of curiosity, on the part of those "<emph>vile creatures,</emph>" whom they were only too well pleased to term the rabble.</p> 
               <p>The dress of the bride was an expensive white satin, over which was a skirt of superb thread-lace. In passing from the carriage, the garment was caught by the door, on observing which a fellow with hands soiled with lampblack, perhaps with a good motive, at once seized the dress and disengaged it from the carriage, leaving the imprint of his dirty member on the magnificent rig out, much to the horror of the bride, whose emotions were too intense for concealment. She looked at him with the most ineffable disgust, in which she was joined by the groom and the two popinjays to whom we have referred, who were acting in the capacity of grooms-men, and had made their appearance from the church just a moment too late to save the bride this unspeakable mortification. But the scene was not yet quite finished;<pb n="52-53" xml:id="VAC6064-00000027"/> for as she passed from the side-walk, resting on the arm of her adored Apollo, a Mercury stood by, commissioned from the gods, to whisper in her ear that in this marriage she should be damned! That Mercury was a young man, with a dark, flashing eye, and an impetuous spirit, a friend of Willie Andrews. He had no sooner startled Nelly with her fate, than he darted from the crowd, and was seen no more. The bride's heart had been pierced with a poisoned arrow, and she walked to the altar as though going to the guillotine.</p> 
               <p>There are many such marriages in this sublunary sphere, and will continue to be, we presume, to the end of time, if such an event is supposable. We have a sincere pity for all those poor unfortunates who are united to each other in the holy bonds of wedlock, without a right understanding of life, or the obligations of marriage; and we heartily wish there might exist among parents, a better judgment than to make matches from motives of pride, that must entail a train of evils upon their offspring, to end either in insanity or suicide. It is natural for those who are wealthy, to desire that their children should be so disposed of as to make sure of a continuance of their positions, which a handsome income seems to command. But, however natural this feeling may be, it unquestionably is fruitful of great and irreparable error. But little can be known, with any degree of certainty, however well educated and wellborn a young man may be, of his fitness for the discharge of the duties of married life before he is twenty-seven and thirty; and most imperfect are a woman's views of such responsibilities until she is twenty-two and three; yet how anxious very many mothers are, and sensible ones too, to marry off their daughters,-to see them "nicely settled in life," before they are in any respect able to form an intelligent opinion as to whether it is for their happiness to marry or not! And how eager are very many young men to engage the affections of young ladies, without for a moment realizing the never-ceasing responsibilities they assume, which, as time passes, and those on whom they have depended drop off into the grave, only increase in weight and appall pall by their fully disclosed magnitude. Early marriages, when not based on the most decided and unequivocal merit, are much to be deplored. It was very well that the Pennimans' pride and vanity should be gratified by marrying their daughter into the McAlpine family; but much better would it be for that daughter if, instead of this shallow-pated McAlpine, she had been encouraged to unite with some one who had a reliable wit, even though not of a "first family." Nothing is more absurd, reprehensible, and criminal, for which divine justice always has a severe punishment, than those "marriages in high life" which are brought about by a shameless, heartless pride, with no other motive and for no other reason than to sustain a certain luxurious mode of living, which is deemed indispensable to <foreign xml:lang="FRA">haut ton,</foreign>-"first respectability." These ideas are a sheer delusion, and they who are duped by them in the morning of life, alas! weep through the noon and evening of their days to little purpose. McAlpine and Nelly were joined together by the clergyman, and the twain that had been made one flesh retraced their steps to the carriage. As Nelly passed from the church, she was observed to be in tears, and the dark imprint of the lamp-black hand seemed darker than ever. So a day of promised joy was turned into one of sorrow, and all, instead of going merry as a marriage bell, went doleful as a funeral dirge. Mrs. Penniman "looked wrath itself," and as she passed from the church, her head tossed high, through the crowd, into her carriage, old Penniman trotting after, with his meager, base-spirited phiz bent downward, there was in the countenances of the persons around a marked satisfaction, that snobbery was so much annoyed. When persons go into public places, and carry with them their absurdities, they must expect little favor from the matter of fact and common sense characters of every day life; and especially when it is sought to apply the rule of exclusiveness to a marriage in a place of public worship!</p> 
               <p>We have said the Pennimans were preparing for a ball, to be given in honor of the newly-married pair. As is customary with those who can afford it, McAlpine<pb n="54-55" xml:id="VAC6064-00000028"/> and his bride had left the city for a brief journey, and the ball was to take place immediately on their return.</p> 
               <p>Mrs. Penniman and her daughters, were seated together in the basement of their mansion, one rainy day, talking over this grand affair, and were making up a list of those "persons whom it would be proper to invite;" for it was a matter of great importance that the company should not be at all "<emph>mixed.</emph>" Mrs. Penniman had the most profound disgust, and so too had her daughters, for all individuals not quite up to their level.</p> 
               <p>The Pennimans, in common with all persons who would appear to be more than what they really are, had a library of well-assorted and handsomely bound books, the contents of which, however, were imperfectly, or not known at all to any of them. This is quite usual among snobs. They do everything for effect. How admirably has Juvenal hit off this contemptible class of pretenders: <q>
                     <lg type="quotation"> 
                        <l>"Devoid of knowledge, as of worth, they thrust,</l> 
                        <l>In every nook, some philosophic bust;</l> 
                        <l>For he among them counts himself most wise</l> 
                        <l>Who most old sages of the sculptor buys;</l> 
                        <l>Sets most true Zenos' or Cleanthes' heads,</l> 
                        <l>To guard the volumes which he never reads,"</l> 
                     </lg>
                  </q>
               </p> 
               <p>These vain and foolish women continued discussing the merits of their acquaintances, throwing out such as were no longer desirable, until the list of the company was completed. This was no easy task; but by the united energies of the Pennimans and a rainy day it was carried through with no inconsiderable despatch. Then came the writing of the invitations, or rather the filling out of the blanks (for they were neatly printed), and addressing the same to the various guests, which done, the invitations were placed in a neat basket, and given to the servant-man to distribute.</p> 
               <p>"The Pennimans are to give a ball," was the salutation of those idle women who were thought worthy to be entered on the list, as they met each other in the saloons of fashion, or upon the street, the following day. A ball among this class is quite an item, and the speculations lations as to the manner in which it will be conducted, and the good cheer and good fortune which may result from it, are as wild as they are various and exciting. A marriageable lady scarcely ever prepares for a select ball or party without in a measure preparing for a husband; and she continues in society, with this object in view, until crowded out by the fresher and superior charms of the youthful maiden. Our streets are filled with these hopeless creatures, who, through their prime entertained such haughty and absurd notions of life, that men who could at all endure celibacy were unwilling to take upon themselves the care of worthless and inconsiderate women, bloated with pride, and crammed with a class of notions which are as foreign to sterling common sense as atheism is to Christianity!</p> 
               <p>This world of ours is an exceedingly practical one, in which a good sound education, with correct views of life, is of the greatest possible advantage, and without which there is little or no chance of encountering "the ills which flesh is heir to" with any degree of fortitude or endurance. Thus it is that women who have set their hopes on securing a husband, aud have given their lives to this one idea, failing to realize their expectations, become down-hearted, imbittered, and at war with themselves and mankind. Thus it is that they become those "detestable old maids" whom everybody avoids, at all times, and in all places.</p> 
               <p>The Pennimans' ball! It was to be a grand affair, in which snobbery, genuine worth, and eminent learning were to be huddled together;-it was to be a hotchpotch affair, after all, notwithstanding Madame Penniman and her butterfly daughters were at the head of it They did not intend to have a "mixed company," and yet it would be impossible to conceive of a greater disparity of intelligence than was gathered together. For instance, there were the learned professors of Harvard, beside the rag-dealers of Milk and Kilby Streets, with their full-feathered wives and daughters, "dressed to kill," and set off with an air of marked quality. Then, there were dealers in hard-ware, with vulgar looking wives in spectacles, boring the Hon. So-and-so, M. C., with his<pb n="56-57" xml:id="VAC6064-00000029"/> family, full of legal lore and classical attainments. And there, also, were men on the wharves (who contract for clipper craft), and their families, hedged in with poetical genius, that regards such persons and their sordid pursuits with the most unspeakable disgust. Then, too, there were lawyers, in close proximity to tradesmen whom they had pleaded successfully against, for which they were soundly hated. And doctors, too, were there, who had lost patients through stupidity, as was believed by their relatives, near to whom "these ignorant doctors" were now standing. Such a medley of discordant elements of social life it would be impossible to describe fully and graphically, without more pains and labor than we are willing to invest in this chapter. Suffice it to say that "Tom, Dick, and the Devil" were there, and that fashion was rampant. This one's reputation for learning was only subject for spleen and spite, with those who lacked lore; this one's youthful bloom and beauty was only an unbearable reflection on that one's musty maidenhood and faded cheek. These contrasts were felt most keenly and bitterly; the passions were let loose, and back-biting began in good earnest. The wits, with his or her fund of good sense, were not slow to detect the brainless upstarts who came in their way, and in a quiet manner cracked their jokes and laughed at snobbery, at the head of which were the Pennimans.</p> 
               <p>It was an expensive affair, this ball, being in all respects a model one. The dancing was continued until twelve o'clock, when supper was announced, to which the company marched in single file, to exquisite music. All appeared blessed with excellent appetites, and soon made way with a most sumptuous supper. Young ladies ate as though they had been fasting for a twelve-month, and mothers and fathers "fairly shovelled into their corporosities" the good things set before them. Gluttony seemed to have seized on all, and the struggle appeared to be which of the company could devour the most food in a given time. With such an ambition animating all of these fashionable cormorants, it is not a matter of surprise that the table was in a short time cleared of all edibles; nor is it a matter of surprise either that some of the company, who were more partial to wine than a strict regard to decency would allow, got into a condition which rendered a carriage and home necessary.</p>

               <p>WILLIE ANDREWS had loved, we have said, Nelly Penniman; but it was not a perfect love; for "here on earth," says the German philosopher, Muller, brother of the celebrated Greek scholar and archologist, "here on earth love can never have an unchangeable home in our hearts, but only sometimes come to us as a transient visitor. These are only inspired moments, when our soul is all devotion, and self-denial, and self-sacrifice; when we are ready to live for our neighbors, even if they, with coldness and enmity, turn away from us. Simple beams of heavenly light are they which fall into the dusk of our earthly life, exulting, quickening, strengthening. But we are still too weak, too earthly, to hold them fast in their entire purity and clearness. There is something ever within us that strives against them; and from without, the want of love,-the injustice and hatred of other men,-ever anew awaken selfish impulses in our soul. Our love is not yet perfect; and so there ever remains in our heart the remnants of selfish fear and sorrow."</p> 
               <p>Willie, perhaps, was too young to have conceived a true passion for Miss Penniman; but whatever the feeling may have been, it was now changed for that of contempt. She had abandoned him; Willie's pride was touched; he would not overlook, forgive the insult. He had many schemes of vengeance; first, he resolved on attacking McAlpine in the street, and inflicting corporal punishment; then he thought he would shoot him; then, that as the Pennimans were most to blame they ought to be punished likewise. He would concoct a satire on the family, and give it to the press. His head was full of plans of revenge, and his heart was eager for their execution. His father, however, was a man of great gravity; he had studied life with care, and learned many lessons in wisdom. He advised his son to prudence, and succeeded finally in persuading him to let the insult pass unnoticed, as coming from those whose pretensions were disgusting, and whose respectability was mere assumption. "Let your life, my noble boy," said his father,-let your life, your goodness, and virtue, be your revenge. Go on with a thorough intellectual training, aspire to become a man of influence; and when you have won for yourself a position, let the world see, and the Pennimans in particular, that the insult offered to your youth has been wiped away by the glory of your manhood. Make them to feel you were never their inferior, and that the name of Andrews, as borne by you, hath a respect paid it which neither the name nor the gold of the whole race of Pennimans could confer. Be this the object of your life; struggle manfully to obtain it, and a vengeance is yours more galling to these proud, God-defying people, than aught you could possibly do by street attack or satire."</p> 
               <p>The boy loved his father, and held in high respect his counsels. He accepted his advice on this occasion; he resolved to leave to the future and the out-working of his character, the measure of revenge. The place which Nelly Penniman had filled in his bosom was now occupied by the tender love of the sweet girl who was with him at the death-bed of Throckmorton. She was, as we have said in a previous chapter, the daughter of a tradesman of considerable means and of liberal culture, and was being well educated. She was a beautiful and graceful girl, with a mind somewhat partial to knowledge, and a most correct taste for art, which she had inherited from her father. She had no genius, but simply taste. Willie admired her as a critic, and she loved him as a power. Her name was Ida Robertson. There were no points of resemblance between Ida and Nelly Penniman, save in their beauty and grace; yet the beauty and grace of each were of a different character. Nelly was a<pb n="60-61" xml:id="VAC6064-00000031"/> blond; Ida was a brunette. Nelly's figure was full and rounded; Ida's was spare and sharp. Their temperaments were quite opposite. Nelly was all impulse; Ida was all thought and deliberation. One was nervous-sanguine; the other was bilious and phlegmatic. But if Ida was an icicle by nature, as that nature appeared to society, she was warm in the expression of her passion for young Andrews. Apparently they had realized that strange, mysterious impression, one of the other, which in early life too often hurries us on to responsibilities and duties for which we are totally unfitted. Love thus proves a delusion and a snare, instead of a source of peace, of comfort, and of joy.</p> 
               <p>These two young and hopeful beings were at a period of life when thoughts are bright and glowing-when little can be known of what the future may reveal of character. In their dreams they seemed to be under the spell of a perfect bliss, without a disturbing thought. Thus Willie and Ida loved;-yet, as he was an earnest student, and a deep thinker, his mind was far less embarrassed with the "dread realities of life" than was his companion's. His fancy was active, and his reason sound.</p> 
               <p>Ida was still at school; soon, however, to terminate these irksome years. Willie was earning a salary of five hundred dollars per year, as bookkeeper in a large wholesale dry-goods establishment, employing all his leisure time in the study of the fine arts. He was a clever musician, painted well, wrote very taking poetry, and was not without a skilful hand at sculpture. His head was of classic form; his eye of a deep, searching blue; his hair well off the forehead, which was prominent and full; his complexion was clear, and "sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought." There was an earnestness in the play of his features, coupled with great nervous irritability, which distinguished him as one of an eccentric nature. He rarely conversed with freedom; but when in the company of artists, or their patrons who were disposed to be a little bending, his mind gave out its thoughts, unchecked by any of that caution and reserve which it practised in the society of those to whom art was a blank, and artists persons of inconsiderable consequence. With Ida he was at times most sociable, but often days passed without more than the common courtesies of life being exchanged. It was at such times that his soul was busy with its dreams of fame. What they might be Ida could as yet only conjecture; for Willie never permitted himself, even to her, to speak of the high hopes within him. He was ambitious, and this he endeavored not to conceal; but that which he meditated in the future was a secret between his God and himself.</p> 
               <p>It was evening. Ida and Willie sat alone in the library of her father's house, which was located in the neighborhood, as we have before said, of the Andrews. The girl was embroidering a handkerchief; the youth was seated at the table, by her side, playing with her hair.</p> 
               <p>"A sad duty indeed it is to speak anything that pains so sweet and gentle a friend," remarked Willie; "yet it is proper we should understand each other perfectly; and that there may be no misapprehension of my meaning, I will be plain. I have said I cannot love you as I ought. Now, a man's love for a woman whom he may intend to make his wife should be so potent as to seize upon his mind, and keep it in continual subjection to this passion. This is not so with my love for you That is, I do not regard you and your society as all-sufficient for my happiness. There is that within me which I must develop,-powers the bare possession of which do make a volcano of my soul. My mind centers on itself, and all without are but as means to its advancement. You do not appear to feel with or to comprehend me. I cannot say your love makes me happy, because my happiness is in nature, and in the unfolding of my faculties. You are sensual, and would have me so too. You point to riches, and bid me waste a precious life in growing rich. Now, money to me hath no value beyond what it can purchase to satisfy reasonable wants,-no value whatever. I hate wealth wherever I see it, when I reflect that it may have been acquired by downright knavery.</p> 
               <pb n="62-63" xml:id="VAC6064-00000032"/> 
               <p>"You are always reflecting," rejoined Ida. "I never saw such a peculiar being. And what pains me deeply is, your reflections are not always just. You do not know how sad I sometimes am, and this too when you think me happy. Oh, my dear friend, why are you so strange-so metaphysical, so unkind, so forever different to what I would have you. Do be more practical, more like other people. Your mind seems wayward, indeed, to me; if you ever loved me, you would love me still. A true and deep affection is not so easily turned from its course. You certainly have made many protestations of your attachment, and I have thought you sincere. Ah, how foolish was I. You say I am sensual, and would have you become so likewise, because I would direct your ambition to mercantile pursuits. If to be sensual is to desire the position wealth commands,-to desire that power which enables one to do so much good,-to dispense so many blessings among the poor, then I confess I am obnoxious to the charge of sensuality, not else. Money I never did esteem for vanity's sake,-for mere display. No, no, God knows my heart; he knows I speak truly."</p> 
               <p>"She is cunning, very cunning," mentally said Willie. "She may love money for charity's sake, but she loves it much better for her own. You don't understand, you never will understand me," continued he aloud; "it is not wealth I declaim against; it is the getting of it, the vile influences of the Exchange, upon which I make war. Suppose I should act on your suggestion, and apply myself to money-making, and successfully, let us presume; think you I could escape the moral degradation of so base a pursuit? Think you as a merchant I should not sink into a trickster? Would my energies once fairly given over to traffic be checked in their operation by any too tender a conscience? Should I not degenerate into the cold-blooded, heartless Jew, insisting on the pound of flesh? The noblest natures have fallen thus, and why not I? Think of the firm with whom I am acting as confidential clerk. There is none in this city of higher standing. Their credit is unlimited; they are believed to be high-minded, truthful men; yet I, who know them better than the world, would not believe them on oath, where their own interest was involved; no, not upon their oath. This seems to amaze you. Astonishing as it may appear, I tell you none who compose this generally respected firm, in the enjoyment of great credit, are, strictly speaking, honest men; and as for their hearts, they have no feeling for anybody's interest save their own."</p> 
               <p>"I am indeed surprised," rejoined Ida, looking intently at Willie.</p> 
               <p>"That you may be," rejoined the young man, "and with good reason. Honesty is rarely found among trades-people, and when it is-seldom <emph>riches.</emph> To get rich is to become demoralized, devilish, as a rule, to which the exceptions are too, too few. Is not the Bible uncompromising in its condemnation of riches?"</p> 
               <p>"Indeed, Willie, you maintain your position with a good deal of skill," returned Ida. "I had not supposed the getting of a fortune was so opposed to virtue, necessarily."</p> 
               <p>"You speak now as one informed," rejoined Willie; "as one who sees somewhat of the <emph>truth.</emph> Now, since you understand that it is not the <emph>possession</emph> of wealth I decry, but the mean practices of the Exchange in its acquirement, you will better appreciate my love of study,-my passion for the beautiful and true, as embodied in the fine arts."</p> 
               <p>"I do, I do," rejoined Ida; "I begin to understand you better; I begin to see by a clearer light. Forgive me, Willie, that I should so disturb you."</p> 
               <p>"Of course, of course. Would, oh, would that I could feel you understood me fully!" returned Andrews, pausing. "In time, in time you may."</p> 
               <p>"In time, love, I <emph>shall,</emph>" rejoined Ida, throwing much tenderness into her voice, apparently intent upon her sewing. "<emph>You</emph> shall be my <emph>study;</emph> I will yet be worthy of your confidence."</p> 
               <p>"Whoever you marry should be a man adapted to your necessities. Am I that man? I fear not." As he concluded, he looked at her, with a somber brow.</p> 
               <p>"Explain, I beg of you," returned Ida. "Why may I<pb n="64-65" xml:id="VAC6064-00000033"/> not be happy in your love? Why are you not adapted to my heart?"</p> 
               <p>"Your heart needs a heart all devotion!" replied the youth; "it dallies with your mind. Mine, on the contrary, is absorbed by thought, fixing itself on the universe. I have no time for these endearments; indeed no inclination which one of your nature would expect in a husband. To you I should seem cold and neglectful, because your existence would be absorbed in that of all beauty and perfection. I should not be drawn to you any more than I would to any other combination of loveliness in nature. This might imbitter your life. You would feel, perhaps, you had not that empire or ascendency over my being which a fond wife claims. Now, be candid; would not this be as I have stated?"</p> 
               <p>"In truth, sir, could I but know I am all you desire in woman as a <emph>wife,</emph> I should never feel or complain of neglect," returned Ida, tenderly; "and what to others might seem like indifference would be to me explained by the all-engrossing habits of your mind."</p> 
               <p>"Well spoken, well spoken," rejoined Willie. "As to my love for you, Ida, I cannot doubt of its durability; but that you are all I might desire in a wife is past my power at present to determine. Let us, therefore, wait the decision of time, living and loving each other as friends."</p> 
               <p>Just at this moment Mr. Andrews entered the room. He was, as we have already stated, a musician. He played on several instruments, with equal and consummate skill. His education was most thorough, having been graduated at Oxford, England. There was a slight resemblance to him in the <foreign xml:lang="FRA">personne</foreign> of his son, who had the same erect bearing and dauntless brow,-the same clear, full voice, the same keen, sparkling eye of his father. Mr. Andrews was one of the merriest of men, delighting in all manner of amusement. He was always ready for a good joke and a hearty laugh. Of Ida he made a great pet, and nothing pleased him more than her amiable and instructive society.</p> 
               <p>After an interchange of some pleasantry, Mr. Andrews took up his flute, and seating himself in a corner of the room, began a favorite air, at her particular request. Willie had arranged the chess-board, and, placing the men in battle array, threw down the glove to Ida, which she accepted, nothing daunted by the many defeats she had sustained through the superior skill of her subtle antagonist.</p> 
               <p>The game of chess is unquestionably the noblest of all games, as it is the most ancient. "Its original," says Franklin, "is beyond the memory of history, and it has, for numberless ages, been the amusement of all the civilized nations of Asia, the Persians, the Indians, and the Chinese. Europe has had it above a thousand years. The Spaniards have spread it over their part of America, and it begins to make its appearance in these States. It is so interesting in itself as not to need the view of gain to induce engaging in it; and thence it is never played for money. Those, therefore, who have leisure for such diversions cannot find one that is more innocent. The game of chess is not merely an idle amusement. Several very valuable qualities of the mind, useful in the course of human life, are to be acquired or strengthened by it, so as to become habits ready on all occasions. For life is a kind of chess, in which we have points to gain, and competitors or adversaries to contend with, and in which there is a vast variety of good and ill events that are in some degree the effects of prudence, or the want of it."</p> 
               <p>Willie and Ida were intent upon their moves, and could have felt no greater interest though the discovery of a new world were involved in the issue, as happened at the Court of Spain. The story runs in this wise: Ferdinand, at play with an old Spanish grandee, whose skill tested the powers of the monarch severely, was accosted by Isabella on behalf of "poor Columbus," whom the matter of fact and phlegmatic king regarded as a mere adventurer and silly enthusiast. The queen's interruption so distracted the king that he lost his principal piece. Absorbed as he was in a hard-fought game with the old noble, the application of his consort in favor of an importunate sailor drew from him a burst of indignation quite startling. The game seemed<pb n="66-67" xml:id="VAC6064-00000034"/> to him lost. Isabella, however, was unmoved. The king looked at her for a moment, then said, "Win this game for me, and your <foreign xml:lang="FRA">portege</foreign> shall be successful;" to accomplish which he deemed impossible. The queen had no knowledge of the game, save what she had acquired by watching her husband and the nobles; but as her sympathies were deeply engaged with the splendid visions of Columbus, she bent all her great energies on the board. The contest had been long, uncommonly so. The courtiers gathered around the table, amused at the excitement of the king, and the quiet satisfaction of his antagonist. And so the game went on which was to decide whether a new world should be sought for and discovered, or remain veiled by the darkness of ignorance, when Isabella, her eyes wild with the passions of her soul, leaned forward and whispered to her husband's ear, "You can check-mate him in four moves." The king, astonished at his wife's declaration, looked closely into his game, and achieved a victory where he thought defeat was certain. Columbus and his mighty cause, with the result of that game of chess, was triumphant. He was made "admiral of the fleets," and sailed westward to glory</p> 
               <p>Willie and Ida were good friends, if not good lovers; and as they sat at chess, near to the amiable and accomplished father of the young man, they presented a picture worthy of a painter's eye.</p>

               <p>YOUNG Andrews, a riddle to himself and others, had thought much and seriously of Ida, whose love, she had declared, was for him alone. He, however, did not place much confidence in Ida's heroism, the devotion of her passion! He had always found her an agreeable companion, but his partiality was nothing more than a bit of romance,-a pleasing fancy. He would not unite himself to any one in the bonds of wedlock without being first assured that the happiness of both parties depended on the union,-that a deep, intelligent, and mutual love existed. Young Andrews' tastes and desires were of a different cast from those of Ida's, and as he advanced in age and experience he began to distrust his capacity to enjoy more than her friendship. Indeed, it seemed to him as though the world did not contain a being precisely suited to his needs,-one answering to his beau ideal; or, if it did, that the pattern was so rare the chance was exceedingly small of ever finding it.</p> 
               <p>The young man's favorite poet was Byron, whose works he had read and re-read, until the text was quite familiar to him. One stanza in particular, from the "Childe," having reference to astrology, appeared to delight him; and often when alone and musing he would give utterance to it. For beauty and delicacy of thought<pb n="68-69" xml:id="VAC6064-00000035"/> there is nothing in language to surpass it. Here it is: <q>

               <p>It is not at all surprising that Willie became enamored of the genius of this gifted bard, for whom many lovers of brilliant writing have entertained a like sentiment; but in our humble judgment Byron's works have been and continue to be a moral scourge, effecting an incalculable amount of injury, where the mind of the reader is at all predisposed to misanthrophy, egotism, lust, and pride.</p> 
               <p>"It is related," says the <title>American Messenger,</title> "of one of the most beautiful and fanciful of American poets, who died recently, that though he was seldom seen in the streets of the city where he lived, and no one gained admission into the rooms he occupied, yet he was a poet, chemist, musician, botanist, astronomer, linguist, and geologist; and so thoroughly accomplished in each of these departments of knowledge that his acquirements would have made most men eminent. But with powers that fitted him for taking a front rank among the world's benefactors, he withdrew himself from sympathy and companionship with men, wrapping himself up in gloomy and selfish misanthropy, and leading the morbid life 'of an indigent recluse.' Mr. S. G. Goodrich (Peter Parley), in his 'Recollections of a Life Time,' charges upon Byron's works the unhappy career of this man, who was no less a personage than Perceval.</p> 
               <p>William Andrews' occupation, we have stated, was that of a clerk. Catchpenny &amp; Co. were his employers. The Catchpennys had two comely-looking daughters, one of whom, the youngest, had conceived quite an interest in William Andrews; but the mother was not altogether pleased with the prospect of a match, as the Andrews family did not at all suit her; although without any claims whatever to distinguished parentage, she being the daughter of a tallowchandler, and Mr. Catchpenny the son of a ropemaker; yet it was not pleasant for her to be associated with musicians, and it would be "death to her pride" to have any marriage relations with such "low people." She therefore cautioned her daughter not to fall in love with Mr. Andrews, but to treat him with more reserve, without appearing too cool; as it was for the interest, that is, the business interest of the family, to be on the most friendly terms with this gentleman, so valuable a person was he to the house of Catchpenny &amp; Co. The young man perfectly understood Mrs. Catchpenny and her daughters; indeed quite as well as he did Mr. Catchpenny, who was one of the most illiterate and vulgar of men, dressing like and assuming all the airs of a gentleman. He knew that the Catchpennys were vain, and as the associates of the Pennimans, could not be unlike them in their ideas of respectability. He knew, of course, if he was objectionable on the score of his family to the Pennimans, he should also be objectionable to the Catchpennys. But Andrews was a genius, and so far from experiencing any displeasure, or being at all mortified at the estimation in which his family were held by these "rag pickers," as he termed them; instead of being sorrowed or angered by these vulgar people, he only laughed at them, and their pretensions heartily. He thought it a capital joke that because he was the son of a musician, who was of the best blood of the grade esquire in England, that he should be deemed the less worthy of marriage relations with families of the most doubtful genealogies, notwithstanding they made a display of borrowed arms on their carriages. This, however, is no uncommon practice, in this land of humbug and parvenues.</p> 
               <p>Andrews, we have said, was a genius, and like all of this mental construction, could not be reached by any small notions of small wits among whom he might be thrown. He saw into and thoroughly comprehended human life and the human heart. He had been an<pb n="70-71" xml:id="VAC6064-00000036"/> earnest student of the Bible, and from that magnificent fountain of wisdom and truth had drank of the living waters of life, which had rendered his genius invulnerable to the ills which, in some form or other, constantly assail mankind. He was prepared for all the indignities which the insolence of our "first families," and, in fact, "Young America" in the aggregate, could heap upon him. Conscious of being well born, and of having inherited a virtuous soul from a virtuous ancestry, he required no marriage relations with either the Pennimans, the Catchpennys, or with the numerous other families who have sprung into notice in the Pilgrim City, on the shoulders of wealth, to make him any the more secure in these possessions. No, no: William Andrews was not to be improved by any such connections, nor, in fact, did he desire to marry into any family who fancied they conferred a favor on him by the alliance. Mrs. Catchpenny and her daughters were always delighted to have Mr. Andrews either dine or sup with them, for he was an exceedingly entertaining man and a well-bred gentleman. Yes, they were most happy to be amused; so that whilst they entertained a supreme contempt for musicians and artists, generally, they could not but admire the manners and soul of their confidential clerk, who was from this order of talent. Andrews poked a great deal of fun, in a sly kind of way, at these people, as wits always do, whenever associated with superficial dullness; but the Catchpennys never suspected even his roguery, although once in a while something would strike them as a "little odd," when they would exclaim, "Why, Mr. Andrews, how droll you are!" It was at such times that our genius had flashed his wit a little heavier than was his wont; for though these thick-headed nobodies in feathers were incapable of being made to understand that they were ridiculous, in the manner of their lives, in the choice of their ideas, and in the sum total of their hopes, yet they could discover something "odd" in the society of genius when amusing itself at their vulgarisms.</p> 
               <p>It was a very pleasant evening in June. Many of both sexes were passing around the Common, in the mall and on the sidewalk. Among the number were the Catchpennys pennys, and the "confidential clerk." As they came up to each other, the young ladies, who appeared to be in excellent spirits, suddenly stopped, and boldly confronted the young man. "Ah, Mr. Andrews! well, if you don't look as sober as a judge I wouldn't say so," remarked Laura, the youngest of the sisters.</p> 
               <p>"Hush, Laura," exclaimed Fanny; "people will think you very bold."</p> 
               <p>"Well, I don't care if they do," returned Laura; "it 's a free country, and a pretty hard case if the best in it can't do as they please. Besides, who has a better right than our family to free speech."</p> 
               <p>These young ladies were altogether of the modern school of manners, and as their father was a wealthy merchant, and their mother had "worked in" among what are termed "the old aristocratic families," the daughters carried themselves with an air of great composure and self-complacency. Their regard for Andrews was mingled somewhat with contempt, in consequence of his father's being an artist; for art and artists, in common with the shallow-pated of their coterie, they had a supreme disgust, of which young Andrews was not unobservant; thought they were always careful, when in his company, to conceal these sentiments as much as possible. But our hero was a keen observer, and of a most searching, penetrating wit; the most indirect hint of character would give him such an insight into it as was truly surprising, and almost miraculous. He knew the Catch-pennys thoroughly; he knew that they were ambitious, proud, and contemptuous of all those whom they regarded as beneath them. But he nevertheless humored these people; played with their weakness instead of rebuking it. Indeed, it was perhaps policy for him to do so, although so far as his situation with Mr. Catchpenny was concerned, we are of opinion that he was quite as necessary to that gentleman's interest as that gentleman was necessary to his. Still, there might be, after all, some policy in young Andrews being as gracious as possible towards the absurdities of Mrs. Catchpenny and her girls.</p> 
               <p>"So you are bound to have free speech, Miss Laura,"<pb n="72-73" xml:id="VAC6064-00000037"/> said he. "Well, I hope you won't abuse the privilege, as is too common now-a-days."</p> 
               <p>"Abuse it; ha! ha! there 's no danger of that, Mr. Andrews," replied Laura. "I should like to know what can be said too abusive of anybody or anything."</p> 
               <p>"There, there you go," rejoined William, smoothing down the dress of the young lady, which the wind had well nigh lifted over her head, exposing full to view the white and handsomely figured dimity.</p> 
               <p>"Bless me," exclaimed Fanny, "this wind is terrible. I can hardly keep on my feet."</p> 
               <p>"Verymodest, to be sure," replied Laura. "Come let's go home, and get out of this thundering bluster. Hallo, there's Mr. and Mrs. Blowhard just passed, feeling quite well, as you can observe. They are very proud people, very proud people. Their grandfather happened to do a good deal in the way of charities; so it sets them up. Say, Andrews, what do you think of this family? Come, go home with us and take tea, and answer my question as we go along."</p> 
               <p>"Well, to be frank with you," replied he, "I think the Blowhards, as the world goes, are not so bad. The truth is they are well-born people, and if they are without any special intellectual gifts, why the fault is not theirs. People, you know, having wealth and well-born, <emph>will</emph> carry themselves pretty stiff, the world over."</p> 
               <p>"Yes," exclaimed Laura, "all persons have their weak points, and some, methinks, have nothing else. Here comes the Yellowbodies. What an enormous woman she is. How insignificant her husband appears beside her."</p> 
               <p>"Mrs. Yellowbody" said Fanny, "is a pretty clever sort of a woman, but mother, though on excellent terms with her, thinks she's dreadful coarse and vulgar in her appearance. Indeed that family-the sisters are just so. The fact is, they have an immense deal of assurance, and this feeling, added to their naturally bold and animal <foreign xml:lang="FRA">personne,</foreign> renders them thus immodest and disgusting."</p> 
               <p>"You are rather severe upon your friends, are you not, Miss Fanny?" interrogated young Andrews, with an air of drollery.</p> 
               <p>"O no, not at all," returned the girl. "It comes just as natural to our family to speak of the <emph>failings,</emph> as well as the <emph>virtues</emph> of our friends. Besides, what are friends. after all?"</p> 
               <p>"Everything, where they are true and reliable," rejoined William.</p> 
               <p>"Where they are true and reliable," reiterated Fanny; "and I should like to know when they are reliable?"</p> 
               <p>"Not often; but sometimes, Miss Fanny, it happens so," replied young Andrews, observing the girl narrowly, as he spoke. "It happens so, sometimes."</p> 
               <p>"I don't believe it!" exclaimed Laura; "no, I don't believe it. How many times I've heard mother say she placed no faith in any one!"</p> 
               <p>"That is a safe rule," replied William; "but I should be most unhappy if I thought all to be false; for to me there is real delight in an honest friendship, and I am convinced there are many such in our midst."</p> 
               <p>"There are very few;-I doubt if there are any sincere attachments in <emph>our set;</emph>" rejoined Laura. "The truth is, each one thinks too much of him or herself to think much of anybody else."</p> 
               <p>"What is the use of one's being too friendly?" remarked Fanny. "I know friendships are thought very sweet and beautiful, where there is sentiment; but then 't is so unfashionable,-so countryfied,-so simplehearted. Among persons of quality it's never tolerated."</p> 
               <p>"Well, Miss Fanny, I hope one of these days there may be, among persons of quality, a change in this respect," rejoined Andrews, evidently enjoying the remark; "and that they may find it for their interest, and consequently happiness, to love their neighbor as themselves."</p> 
               <p>"Oh, this is utterly impossible,-positively shocking, sir," replied Laura.</p> 
               <p>"Yes, but it's scriptural," rejoined William;" and what better authority can you desire than that?"</p> 
               <pb n="74-75" xml:id="VAC6064-00000038"/> 
               <p>"Oh, now you are coming with your authorities," returned Laura; "but fortunately we are at our door, and may give your authorities the slip. But seriously, you don't suppose it is possible for any of us to love our neighbor as ourself?"</p> 
               <p>"Some other time, Miss Laura, we will talk this matter over, and come to some conclusion," rejoined William, "I think it is possible for <emph>Christians</emph> to love one another as themselves, but of course only under the direct influence of the Holy Spirit, which must sanctify all friendships, or they are ropes of sand. I will now leave you."</p> 
               <p>"Oh no, come in, do, and take tea with us," said Fanny, at the same time catching hold of the young man's coat. "Mother will be so disappointed not to see you!"</p> 
               <p>"Yes, now do come in, Mr. Andrews,"earnestly spoke Laura, taking him by the arm. "We will not excuse you. Come in, and cheer up mother's spirits; now do!"</p> 
               <p>Our hero was fairly in possession of the Misses Catchpenny. One was on each side, and it was an utter impossibility for him to escape; so after some little resistance, the young man confessed himself a prisoner, and was led into the fashionable residence of these exceedingly fashionable ladies. But it was no new scene to William. He had often been present at their tea-table, and had as often been amused at the many gross absurdities which characterized the mother and daughters. It was an amusement to the confidential clerk to listen to their conversation; and though he seldom sought to check them by any sallies of ridicule, still he could not resist, at times, dropping a remark charged slightly with reprobation.</p> 
               <p>In a short time tea was announced as ready, and the company soon made their appearance, consisting of Mrs. Catchpenny, her daughters, and Mrs. Touchmenot and her daughter, Miss Julia, soon to be married to an exquisite, born somewhere near the Northern Lakes. He was considered one of the handsomest men in the city, and at the same time one of the biggest fools. It was generally thought a very foolish match.</p> 
               <p>With this set of petticoats, as shallow-pated and ridiculous as an idle, luxurious life could make them, our hero, William Andrews, was condemned to drink tea, and to enter into all their absurd views of matters in general. But Andrews was a gentleman, and although he chafed under the infliction, he gave no sign or token of his dissatisfaction, but bore patiently the nonsense of these women with apparent delight.</p> 
               <p>There is no self-control so difficult as that of appearing pleased with fashionable twaddle, when at every word our indignant sense of truth and harmony is struggling for expression. Especially is this so where there is <emph>genius,</emph> which is ever impetuous and authoritative. But the young man listened with a marked degree of composure and seeming interest to all that was said, and made quite a favorable impression on Miss Julia, whom he now met for the first time; and she declared were she unengaged, and if Mr. Andrews was only better born, she should certainly set her cap for him; but of course she had good breeding enough to make this remark in so low a tone as to be heard only by her mamma, who sat with all the dignity of a dowager between her daughter and Mrs. Catchpenny.</p> 
               <p>We have been especially amused at the pretensions of these Touchmenots, who are among the leading members of the <emph>pseudo-Aristocracy</emph> of our city, and have afforded the wits as much amusement, in times past and present, as any two of the most ridiculous families to be named. The reader will have an opportunity of an introduction to these persons, who present such a conspicuous appearance at this tea-party.</p> 
               <p>"Really, Mrs. Catchpenny, your tea is very nice!" exclaimed Miss Julia; "but it's so hot! I abominate anything so <emph>very</emph> hot."</p> 
               <p>"Patience, my dear child,-patience,"returned Mrs. Catchpenny; "it will soon cool."</p> 
               <p>"Yes, have patience, my dear,"remarked Mrs. Touchmenot; "the world was n't made in a minute."</p> 
               <p>"I should n't think it was," spoke up Fanny; "there is so much in it of elaborate ornament."</p> 
               <p>"Why, what do you mean by that?" interrogated Laura, who sat by the side of Andrews.</p> 
               <pb n="76-77" xml:id="VAC6064-00000039"/> 
               <p>"No matter, no matter what she means!" exclaimed the hostess; "she always requires to be explained."</p> 
               <p>"Ha! ha! ha! ha! ha! ha! "roared Julia; "that puts me in mind of something. Why, Mr. Andrews, how sober you are!"</p> 
               <p>"Deference, deference, Miss Touchmenot," returned the young man, almost unable to preserve a serious countenance. "I listen, generally, when in so select a company, with a good deal of gravity."</p> 
               <p>This remark was highly pleasing to Mrs. Touchmenot, who threw back her shoulders, and seemed quite satisfied that he had confessed himself in the presence of persons of quality; for this lady never could be too often reminded of her pretensions.</p> 
               <p>"Well, as I was going to say," continued Julia, "I am reminded of something. Ha! ha! ha! what a queer girl you are, Laura. Whenever I undertake to say anything that's good, and catch your eye, I am sure to laugh; you are so very quizical!"</p> 
               <p>"Laugh! you should never laugh, my dear, when you are telling a story," spoke Mrs. Touchmenot, with an air of imperative command. "Let others laugh, my dear, if they choose, but never laugh yourself-<emph>never!</emph> You know, when we were at Newport, last summer, how ridiculous it appeared in those people from the South; and we remarked it at the time, did we not?"</p> 
               <p>"Those people from the South were fools," returned the daughter, testily.</p> 
               <p>"You remember that family, do you not, Laura, who were incessantly cracking jokes, and laughing at their own absurdities?" inquired Mrs. Touchmenot.</p> 
               <p>"That I do," returned Laura. "I was so mad with the one who passed for a belle that I could have given her a good shaking."</p> 
               <p>"Really, Miss Laura, you are more pugnacious than I ever thought you," said William Andrews.</p> 
               <p>"Why, Mr. Andrews, she can be, when she has a mind to a perfect Zantiffede!" exclaimed Mrs. Catchpenny, putting a slice of buttered toast on Mrs. Touchmenot's plate, who was so ceremonious and dignified that she would not help herself.</p> 
                
               <p>"Why, mother!" exclaimed Fanny, putting down the cup of tea which she had raised to her mouth, "there 's no such person as Zantiffede."</p> 
               <p>"Hush, child," returned Mrs. Catchpenny, the blood crimsoning her face; "there <emph>was</emph> such a person. It's an historical character. You 'll have to review history again, I see plainly."</p> 
               <p>"I tell you, mother, I am right," replied Fanny. "There is, nor never was, such a person as Zantiffede; and I will leave it to Mrs. Touchmenot."</p> 
               <p>"Why, my dear child," returned that important personage, "your mother is of course right. It is some time since I studied the classics, but I am quite sure your mother is right. This Zantiffede was a sort of amphibious creature, if I mistake not, that dwelt in and about the shores of Greece, in its golden age."</p> 
               <p>"Yes, and was an object of dread to the sailors," continued Julia, "who found, whenever they landed near where this creature was, some of their number were sure to go mad. This creature was neither a man nor a woman, but an hermaphrodite. Ha! ha! ha! just think of such a creature"</p> 
               <p>"You are not right yet," exclaimed Fanny. "I should like to know out of what history you got any such account of the wife of Socrates."</p> 
               <p>"Wife of Socrates!" vociferated Julia, swallowing a sip of tea; "that vulgar ancient never had a wife. Nobody would have him, and he died in consequence."</p> 
               <p>"I tell you it's no such thing," replied Fanny.</p> 
               <p>"Hush, hush!" exclaimed Mrs. Catchpenny.</p> 
               <p>"Let us first know who is right, and who is wrong," said Laura. "My opinion is that Fanny's correction is <emph>history;</emph> but to put it beyond further question, I propose that Mr. Andrews decide Will you all abide by Mr. Andrews' decision?"</p> 
               <p>"I'm quite willing," said Fanny. "Mr. Andrews is well read; that everybody knows."</p> 
               <p>"Well, Mr. Andrews, come, give us your opinion," remarked Mrs. Catchpenny. "Are we not right?"</p> 
               <p>"I am sorry, madam; but if you would have me truthful. I must confirm Miss Fanny's statement. It is Xanthippee<pb n="78-79" xml:id="VAC6064-00000040"/> thippee, and not Zantiffede, who was the scolding wife of Socrates."</p> 
               <p>"It can't be so, it can't be so, Mr. Andrews!" exclaimed Julia, looking most seriously at him. "You are mistaken; oh, you are mistaken, sir; but never mind, never mind. Laura, who was that fine looking, gentlemany fellow I saw gallanting you to-day? He looks so much like my brother, now in Italy. He could not bear this country; he thinks Americans are dreadful vulgar. Ha! ha! ha! he 's a queer fellow; but really I think he 's right about Americans."</p> 
               <p>"Well, I do think you are just one of the coolest persons I ever knew," said Fanny, looking at Miss Touchmenot with an air of astonishment.</p> 
               <p>"Hush, hush, hush, child; that matter is all settled," exclaimed Mrs. Catchpenny.</p> 
               <p>"Fanny does remind me so much of Lucy Atlay," remarked Mrs. Touchmenot. "You know that family, Mrs. Catchpenny?"</p> 
               <p>"O yes-<emph>of</emph> them-I know <emph>of</emph> them: but we don't visit," replied the hostess. "The truth is Mrs. Atlay is not quite up to my mark."</p> 
               <p>"No, nor mine," returned Mrs. Touchmenot, with an air of great disdain. "I don't consider her at all on our level. Her set is quite common,-quite so."</p> 
               <p>"Why, yes," rejoined Julia," as common as common can be. There are people in her set I 'm sure <emph>I</emph> should not want to know, on <emph>any</emph> account. For instance, there are those Bigbugs-just mere nobodies-mushrooms. I heartily despise those people."</p> 
               <p>"Mrs. Bigbug was the daughter of a tavern-keeper," ejaculated Mrs. Touchmenot, contemptuously:" a tavern-keeper! Really, it is amusing to observe what airs such people give themselves, especially when accidentally or otherwise thrown among their superiors."</p> 
               <p>"The girls are truly laughable," remarked Laura, with a giggle. "Whenever they appear on the street they are always in full dress: and with <emph>such</emph> manners! They are not at all sure of their position; this is quite evident; so assume in their bearing what the best society, being certain of, are always easy about, and have no occasion to adopt the custom among ordinary people of appearing ostentatious in order to induce the idea that they <emph>are</emph> somebody."</p> 
               <p>"Very well expressed, my dear," said Mrs. Catchpenny, who, in conjunction with Mrs. Touchmenot and Mrs. Penniman, and the Yellowbodies, was the very extreme of presumption and pretension; "very well expressed indeed."</p> 
               <p>"I believe, Mr. Andrews, you do not altogether sympathize with us in our views," remarked Mrs. Touchmenot, with excessive dignity; "I believe you are a Democrat."</p> 
               <p>"Fudge!" exclaimed Laura, casting an eye of mirth at the young man; "he 's no more a Democrat than Iam."</p> 
               <p>"I hope not," remarked Fanny; "for I <emph>do</emph> think democracy the most vulgar of all ideas ever heard of."</p> 
               <p>"Whenever you want to find a vulgar person," said Mrs. Catchpenny, giving her head a toss, "just look up a Democrat, and you have one. I am disgusted with this class of persons-low-born and low-bred. Whenever <emph>I am</emph> at Newport or Nahant, and observe an uncouth family, upon inquiry as. to their politics, I am sure to learn that they are Democrats. Mr. Andrews, I hope, I sincerely hope, you are no such person."</p> 
               <p>"Well, really, ladies, you hold in such contempt the democracy," rejoined the young man, "that I am almost disposed to belie myself, and join with you in denunciation of this party."</p> 
               <p>"But are you really a Democrat, Mr. Andrews?" interrogated Julia; "that is what I would like to know."</p> 
               <p>"Of course he is," remarked Fanny; "he 's what his father is; it's <emph>very</emph> natural."</p> 
               <p>"Thank you, Miss Fanny," responded William, "for aiding me in my embarrassment. A man is certainly not to blame for inheriting his father's politics."</p> 
               <p>"Then you <emph>are</emph> a Democrat, Mr. Andrews!" exclaimed Miss Touchmenot, with affected astonishment; for she well knew the young man's father was a leading Democrat, and that in all probability the son was like unto the father. Indeed, both she and her mother regarded<pb n="80-81" xml:id="VAC6064-00000041"/> garded the Andrews, family as quite plebeian, and her inquiries as to William's politics were from a desire to annoy him more than to inform herself.</p> 
               <p>"Yes, Miss Touchmenot, I am a Democrat <emph>out and out,</emph>" said William; "which acknowledgment, since I have Miss Fanny as my friend, I do not hesitate or fear to make."</p> 
               <p>"O, but you've not me for your friend, Mr. Andrews!" exclaimed Fanny; "for I think just as Julia does,-that the democracy is a vulgar rabble: and I am sorry, very sorry, Mr. Andrews, that you belong to it."</p> 
               <p>"And so am I!" exclaimed Laura.</p> 
               <p>"So are we all," said Mrs. Catchpenny, passing the cake to Mrs. Touchmenot; "but it is very difficult for one to <emph>rise above the notions of their family.</emph>"</p> 
               <p>"O, very,-very indeed," returned Mrs. Touchmenot. "I have seen this illustrated so many, many times-so <emph>many</emph> times!"</p> 
               <p>"But, Mr. Andrews, you don't really mean to live and die a Democrat,-one of the <foreign xml:lang="FRA">canielle?</foreign>" interrogated Julia. "I hope not, sir."</p> 
               <p>"I shall probably, Miss Touchmenot, live and die in the political and religious faith of my fathers," returned William, in a firm and earnest tone. "We are in a direct line from the Regicides, who sent Charles I. to the block-Puritans and king-killers."</p> 
               <p>"Line!-have you a line, Mr. Andrews?" interrogated Mrs. Touchmenot, with astonishment.</p> 
               <p>"Yes, madam, an unbroken one, as far back as the reign of King John, in the twelfth century, whom the Barons, at Runnymede, forced to sign the Magna Charta, the first important step towards the limitation of monarchy, and the foundation of the liberties of the English nation. My ancestor was an <emph>Esquire</emph> in the service of William, Earl of Arundel, whose honored name is attached to that most august and remarkable document."</p> 
               <p>"Really, Mr. Andrews, we had no idea <emph>your</emph> genealogical tree was so well defined," remarked the hostess, evidently surprised at the statement. "We, too, feel a deep interest in the past."</p> 
                
               <p>"So do we," said Madam Touchmenot. "The past! how delightful it is to revert to it, and run over the heroic deeds of one's ancestry!" and as she said this, there was an evident satisfaction in the idea.</p> 
               <p>"I presume there are no Democrats, madam, in your line?" remarked Andrews, with all the seriousness he could command.</p> 
               <p>"None that we are aware of, sir. It is possible there may be one here and there, in the line," returned Mrs. Touchmenot with a most dignified movement of the head; "although we are not disposed to make the admission."</p> 
               <p>"Then your pedigree is not as clear and well understood as you would be glad to have it?" interrogated the young man, laughing in his sleeve all the while; for he well knew these people were of humble extraction.</p> 
               <p>"Not so, not so, sir," returned Mrs. Touchmenot. "We go back to William the Conqueror, and are perfectly well informed as to every link in the chain."</p> 
               <p>"Excuse me, madam, excuse me for any apparent contrary impression," rejoined Andrews, scarcely able to contain his jocular emotions.</p> 
               <p>"Have another cup of tea, Julia, won't you?-now, do," said the hostess, evidently desirous of changing the subject; for she well knew on the score of pedigree, she, nor the Touchmenots, could present honestly any such claims as had young Andrews, whom they regarded of inferior extraction to themselves, <emph>because the son of a musician!</emph>
               </p> 
               <p>"If this is not <emph>peculiar,</emph>" thought young Andrews, "what can possibly be?"</p> 
               <p>"O, Mr. Andrews,"spoke up Fanny, "do tell us if the report is true that you are engaged to Ida Robertson. Everybody says you are."</p> 
               <p>"Well, you know, Miss Fanny," replied William, "that what everybody says is believed, as a rule, to be true; so were I to deny the report, I suppose everybody's assertion would still be credited."</p> 
               <p>"A very sensible response, very, sir," remarked Mrs. Touchmenot. "In a country where the majority is law, what <emph>everybody</emph> says certainly must be true."</p> 
               <pb n="82-83" xml:id="VAC6064-00000042"/> 
               <p>"I don't believe it, though!"Z exclaimed Fanny, casting an inquiring glance at the clerk.</p> 
               <p>"I 'm sure I don't," exclaimed Laura, helping herself to a piece of pie. "I don't believe one word of it. Such a strange man as you are, Mr. Andrews, will find it very hard to get married to a woman of any wit. The fact is you are so difficult to understand."</p> 
               <p>"I certainly see nothing so incomprehensible," remarked Mrs. Touchmenot, energetically; and at my time of life I ought to know what's what."</p> 
               <p>"I'm sure I see nothing mysterious in Mr. Andrews," remarked Madam Catchpenny;"but girls now-a-days are always in advance of their mothers."</p> 
               <p>"That's just as it should be," returned Fanny, smiling. "Young America has and ought to have a universal application;-the cart before the horse, always."</p> 
               <p>"So, Miss Laura, I 'm a riddle, am I?" interrogated William, in the utmost good nature.</p> 
               <p>"You are, indeed; as complete and puzzling a riddle, too, as ever walked on two legs," returned Laura, earnestly.</p> 
               <p>"Legs, my dear,-legs!" exclaimed Mrs. Catchpenny. "For Heaven's sake be a little more refined! Say <emph>limbs,</emph> my dear,-<emph>limbs.</emph> What <emph>is</emph> the present generation of girls coming to?"</p> 
               <p>"Ha! ha! ha!" roared Julia; "I don't think, Mrs. Catchpenny, your correction likely to be much respected. Legs!-why, bless your soul, legs are more in use now than ever before, since both sexes have taken to public bathing in the sea, and wear the breeches. Nobody thinks of talking about <emph>limbs.</emph> It 's legs, my dear Mrs. Catchpenny, all the world over; and some beautiful specimens there are on exhibition, during the summer season, along the Atlantic shore, floating on the wave. It is a delightful custom, this bathing with the gentlemen, I do assure you."</p> 
               <p>"So it is, so it is," exclaimed Fanny. "Let me read you the correspondence from Newport, in the <title>Transcript</title> of this evening. The writer is a darling,-there's no doubt of that.</p> 
                
               <q>
                  <p>"'Surf-bathing, on the great beach at Newport, in the height of the season, and for the first time in one's life, is a curious experience. So I thought, when, one fine day, a short time ago, I found myself, upon the payment of twenty-five cents, the temporary lessee of a bathing-dress and one of the hundred and fifty little houses that are ranged along the sands at high-water mark. The costume which is furnished you on such an occasion is remarkable for its severe simplicity. It consists of a woollen jacket or shirt, and a pair of flimsy cotton trousers; and you sally forth from your box with a noble disregard of appearances, your head without a covering, and your bare feet making tracks in the sand, after the manner of Robinson Crusoe's man Friday. As there is a crowd of spectators assembled, some waiting for their turn as occupants of the little houses aforesaid, and some who have taken the beach for their morning drive, whatever native modesty is latent in one's composition, is sure to develop itself. The custodion of the garments which are furnished at the beach seems to be of a humorous turn of mind, and inclined to mild practical jokes in the matter of his dispensations; for to such as are portly he gives the smallest dresses in his wardrobe, while gentlemen of moderate stature find themselves arrayed in habiliments of most superfluous dimensions. I made my debut in a ragged red shirt which afforded thorough ventilation, and a pair of untractable trousers which appeared to have been made for the American Giant.</p>
                  <p>"'But whatever may be the infelicities of your apparel, you put a bold face on the matter, and march into the water as if you had done it every day for a twelvemonth, Sundays not excepted. Despite your embarrassing self-consciousness, you are startled at the aspect of certain of your fellow-creatures, who, having disported themselves sufficiently in the salt sea waves, are returning to assume their usual costume. And what a picture they present, as, with their scanty garments dripping with brine and clinging close to their persons, with some erratic style of dilapidated straw bound round their heads, and with their hair enveloped in oil-cloth, these feminine curiosities (for they are indeed of womankind) splash through the shallow water. Are these the modern mermaids? Is it in this guise that Beauty dares array herself? As you pass them, you seem to recognize the party that sat opposite you yesterday, at the hotel table. Can it be? You almost stand aghast at this thorough metamorphosis. Yonder lank figure, from which just now proceeded the sound of subdued laughter,-can it be she who, in all the glory of her splendid attire, met your admiring gaze at dinner, yester-afternoon, and when the feast was over, sailed so majestically from the hall? And her companions-the portly lady in black, the two elderly persons, and the pleasing young lady in pink, whom you looked at in a brown study during dessert-can these indeed be thus transformed? Yes! it is even so. A new light dawns upon you. You magnify the mission of the dressmaker, and the other artists who contribute toward the embellishment of the feminine form; you feel ashamed of the criticisms which in times past you have bestowed upon bonnets both large and small; you repent of your weak sarcasms upon hoops, and you become suddenly<pb n="84-85" xml:id="VAC6064-00000043"/> denly reconciled to all manner of feminine costumes, except the one before you. "Take any shape but that," you exclaim to the sex generally.</p>
                  <p>"'While you have been thus improving the shining moments, you have got to where the surf is rolling in from the ocean, and breaking over the forms of the bathers. You join one of the merry groups who are meeting each foam-crested wave, and essay to rise like them when the swell reaches you. But this time the surf is higher than usual, and over you go, with your mouth full of salt water, and a fearful uncertainty as to where you will finally turn up. Your footing is at last regained; and when, after much gasping and coughing, you are able to look around you, you conclude that you have had surf enough for to-day, and think you will go. But you try to believe, nevertheless, that it is excellent fun, besides being healthful and bracing.</p>
                  <p>"'And now comes another embarrassing situation. The gauntlet of curious spectators is yet to be run;-the formidable array of ladies in their carriages, who gaze languidly at the bathers through their eye-glasses, is to be passed before your dressing-room is reached. If your covering seemed scanty and insufficient before entering the water, it is still more so now that, wet as a sop, it clings to you with more persistency than grace. You rather dread to encounter the playful remarks of the fair critics in the carriages, and you stand for a time in a dreadful state of indecision. Suddenly you find that you have forgotten the number of your bathing house. You remember looking at the sign on the door, as you came out, but whether it was forty-six, or sixty-four, or fifty-eight, or eighty-five, you cannot for the life of you tell. The number went out of your head when the salt water came into it so suddenly, under the surf. You imagine all sorts of possible adventures arising from your bursting into the wrong hut, and surprising a lady or gentleman in a partial toilet. Perhaps you will be taken for a thief; perhaps for something worse. But what is to be done? To stay in the water all day is not entirely practicable, and growing desperate you rush for house number forty-six, which fortunately proves to be the right one. Your progress up the beach and past the carriages is extremely trying. But you endeavor to appear as if you thought nobody was looking at you, and right glad are you when all is over, and you are yourself again.</p>
                  <p>"'This, Mr. Transcript, is the style in which people bathe during the season, on the town beach, here in Newport. The gathering is, on the whole, about as democratic a one in appearance as I have seen this many a day. Old and young, men, women, and children, splashing and capering about in their strange costume, form an amusing if not an impressive picture. Certain dresses there are, here and there, in the crowd, which faintly suggest the tasteful and becoming; but for the most part they are nearer the frightful in their appearance. The angel of the dining-hall and the drawing-room is often transformed into a scarecrow when she has made ready for the bath; and in this locality you cannot help being reminded of the fact that some persons are fearfully and wonderfully made.</p>
                  <p>"'I sat, after my bath was over, on the long bench at the end of the beach. A red-haired man next me was facetious, sarcastic, and communicative. "'Taint no use," quoth he, "for them women to think they can humbug people when they go in here a-bathing. They have to leave their toggery behind 'em, and then we know wot's wot." I listened in respectful silence. "But I can tell," continued he, with a knowing air, "whether they'll look well in the water, jest as soon as I put my eye on 'em." Just then a remarkably stout lady rolled through the water like a porpoise, and walked as majestically as possible up the beach. "I declare!" exclaimed my neighbor, "there 's a woman at our house who feels bad 'bout bathing here, because she 's so fat. I'll go home and tell her she need n't be afraid, after that ere two hundred and fifty pounder has showed herself." And on this benevolent errand the red-haired man departed.'</p>

               <p>"Now, 'there 's a letter what is a letter,'" continued Fanny; "sea-bathing in full."</p> 
               <p>"Yes, I should think so," remarked Mrs. Catchpenny, with an air of modesty which ill suited her character and low-dressed bosom.</p> 
               <p>"Ha, ha!" rejoined Fanny; "many a frolick I have had with the beaux in bath, and I think I rather prefer them at this time than any other."</p> 
               <p>"I do, I 'm sure," spoke up Laura; "it is such glorious fun to roll with them in the surf. One feels so safe in the arms of a gallant swimmer."</p> 
               <p>"Why, are n't you ashamed of yourself, Laura," exclaimed her mother, "to run on in this sort of way? Do be a little more circumspect."</p> 
               <p>"Why, mother, where's the harm?" returned Laura. "You know the French saying, '<foreign xml:lang="FRA">honi soit que mal y pense.</foreign>'"</p> 
               <p>"I know all about your French sayings," replied Mrs. Catchpenny, warmly; "I tell you no good can come of these salt water intimacies."</p> 
               <p>"Ha! ha! ha! ha! ha! ha!" roared Julia; "why, bless you, Mrs. Catchpenny, it is so delightful! Remember, you were young once, and full of hot blood."</p> 
               <p>"Well, I don't approve of such intimacies, I tell you," returned the hostess, earnestly.</p> 
               <p>"I think such conduct highly indecorous," remarked Mrs. Touchmenot, passionately and proudly; "but my daughter is so headstrong that she <emph>will</emph> have her own way in all things."</p> 
               <pb n="86-87" xml:id="VAC6064-00000044"/> 
               <p>"And what is the use, I should like to know, in having one's way," said Laura, "unless one can exercise it?"</p> 
               <p>"That's just what I should like to know," spoke up Fanny. "No girls, now-a-days, who are at all fashionable, play the prude."</p> 
               <p>"I agree with you, ladies, entirely," said the young man, smiling; "prudish people are not at all fashionable; but I think, perhaps, it would be well if they were a little so,-I do, most positively."</p> 
               <p>"Well, I don't," spoke Laura, rather sharply. "There, I always said you were a strange man. Here you are talking just contrary to what you said only a day or two since."</p> 
               <p>"Why, you don't expect, I hope, anybody to be of the same mind at all times," returned William; "to remember <emph>all</emph> their small talk from day to day, and never contradict themselves."</p> 
               <p>"Why, they ought to, I'm sure," replied Laura, "if they have any regard to the good opinion of their friends."</p> 
               <p>"By the way, Mrs. Touchmenot," said Andrews, "I have something I wish to say to you, which has been long on my mind; but an opportunity has never before offered."</p> 
               <p>"What is it, sir? I shall be pleased to hear you," returned the lady, in a most dignified manner.</p> 
               <p>"Some time since," rejoined Andrews, "there was sent to my house a piece of poetry subscribed with the initials of my name, and addressed to you, Miss Julia. The poetry had been read, evidently by you, as the seal was broken; and, bearing my initials, it was returned to me, I presume, as the author. At the time, I was not at home. It was received by the servant, and placed behind the looking-glass, where it remained for six months, before coming under my notice. I was on the point of returning it to you, but deemed it too trifling a matter to pursue, thinking perhaps I should some time or other have an opportunity of explaining the matter to you in person."</p> 
                
               <p>"Then you did not write it, Mr. Andrews?" interrogated Mrs. Touchmenot, with a look of surprise.</p> 
               <p>"Madam, whenever I write <emph>poetry</emph> to a lady," replied the young man, with an air of unusual dignity, "I always, in the first place, assure myself it will be well received and appreciated; in the second place, I always avoid doggerel; in the third place, I faithfully observe the rules of grammar. Now, this verse to which I allude as returned to me, is deficient in all of these three respects. Therefore I cannot, madam, be the author. Indeed, your daughter, Mrs. Touchmenot, is the last person in the world who would be likely to invoke my muse."</p> 
               <p>This was a most unexpected announcement, and the aristocratic lady was in quite a flutter. She scarcely knew what to say. The blood mounted to her face, by which a candle might almost have been lighted. Young Andrews saw her embarrassment, yet made no attempt whatever to relieve her from it, enjoying heartily the snob's discomforture. Julia also was keenly sensible of the clerk's intention in the remark he had made; but she discovered much less emotion than her conceited, ignorant mamma.</p> 
               <p>Laura, who instantly perceived the mischief done, cast a sly look at Andrews, and exclaimed, "Oh, your muse, then, is no Democrat; for according to your own showing it won't respond to every beauty's charms. I wonder if <emph>I</emph> could get a couplet from it."</p> 
               <p>"No, Miss Laura, you could not; and I will tell you why," responded Andrews. "With me, <emph>poetry</emph> is a sacred thought, and should be written only where there is the taste and disposition to cherish it;" and as he pronounced these words his countenance glowed with great fervor. After a moment's pause he continued. "The beautiful and true have but little interest to the worldling,-to those whose habits are in direct opposition to their own consciences and the laws of God."</p> 
               <p>"Rather severe, Mr. Andrews; rather severe, sir, are you not?" inquired Mrs. Catchpenny, quite mortified and embarrassed at the turn conversation had taken.</p> 
               <pb n="88-89" xml:id="VAC6064-00000045"/> 
               <p>"There, I knew I was right," said Laura, "when I gave it as <emph>my</emph> opinion that Mr. Andrews is a riddle hard to be understood."</p> 
               <p>"Really-upon my word," remarked Julia, "I begin to think you are right."</p> 
               <p>"Mr. Andrews, excuse me, sir, but is there not insanity in your family?" inquired Mrs. Touchmenot, bursting with spleen. "Has there not been, somewhere along your <emph>illustrious</emph> line, a crack-brain?"</p> 
               <p>"Ay, madam, several," responded our hero, quite cool, and apparently unconscious of the sarcasm; "but they have always had wit enough to conceal their lunacy, and to pass for honest, upright, influential men. I suppose, madam, about three-fifths of-human kind are more or less unsound in the reasoning powers; so you may judge what your chance and your daughter's is of exemption."</p> 
               <p>"Why, Mr. Andrews! I am-I am-surprised!" exclaimed Mrs. Catchpenny, with great earnestness, "that-you-should-"</p> 
               <p>"Now, I beg of you, madam, don't turn a little badinage into an affront to anybody," interrupted the young man, quite self-possessed. "You know how impossible it is to be talkative, with any degree of wit, without being somewhat open to the charge of rudeness. You understand, Mrs. Touchmenot, how this is, of course. A lady who has been in so much excellent society-"</p> 
               <p>"The <emph>first</emph> society!" interrupted the indignant lady, "both in this country and in Europe, sir."</p> 
               <p>"Certainly, madam; the first, of course," rejoined our hero, not at all discomposed; "that was the idea I intended to convey by excellent."</p> 
               <p>The Touchmenots, highly incensed at what they regarded as plebeian insolence, rose instantly from the table, and withdrew from the room, after stating as a reason that it was so hot and uncomfortable they could not remain longer. Mrs. Catchpenny urged them to be seated again; so, likewise, did Laura and Fanny; but all solicitation was in vain; Mrs. Touchmenot and daughter were in a high state of indignant fever, which never would break so long as they continued in the presence of young Andrews; for they heartily despised him, and he in return regarded them, as he did weakness in general, as marks for ridicule, jest, and every manifestation of corrective wit. Julia seemed to him to be an especial subject for the satirist; as a more brainless, and at the same time pretensious <emph>lady,</emph> was not to be found in any of the mixed or unmixed sets of "Modern Society."</p> 
               <p>As she and her mother left the tea-table, they cast on the "audacious clerk" a look of what they deemed, doubtless, withering scorn, but which to young Andrews appeared more like the impotency of a shallow wit.</p> 
               <p>No sooner had this mock dignity vanished from the room, than Mrs. Catchpenny exclaimed, "Well, Mr. Andrews, you have been most unfortunate, sir,-most unfortunate!" and as she said this, she resumed her seat at the table.</p> 
               <p>"And pray, madam, in what respect?" responded the young man, affecting amazement.</p> 
               <p>"You have subjected us to the charge of entertaining at our table persons of no breeding. This, <emph>this,</emph> sir, is what the Touchmenots will say of us in society, which is very embarrassing,-very embarrassing indeed, sir."</p> 
               <p>"Then they are really offended?" said our hero, seriously. "Upon my word, how difficult to be entertaining, and at the same time harmless."</p> 
               <p>"But you were rude, positively rude, Mr. Andrews," replied the hostess. "I have never met with a person claiming to be a gentleman that was more so. The Touchmenots left the house in a great passion, and declared they would never darken my doors again. Now, here are people, whose acquaintance we were at no little trouble to make, absolutely driven from the house by your facetiousness."</p> 
               <p>"Well, upon my word, I am very sorry," rejoined Andrews; "and never will I be found again, so long as I live, with persons of Mrs. Touchmenot's dignity. I do assure you it is most painful to me to have given so much offence."</p> 
               <p>"A little more discretion, Mr. Andrews,-a little<pb n="90-91" xml:id="VAC6064-00000046"/> more discretion," rejoined the hostess, "and you would do very well; but you do so lack judgment."</p> 
               <p>"I know that is a great weakness," returned he; "but of one thing you may be assured: this is much more manifest to you than to your husband, who frequently has complimented me for my "good, sound common sense in all business matters."</p> 
               <p>"Business matters!" reiterated Mrs. Catchpenny; "I should like to know what business matters have to do with refined society."</p> 
               <p>"But, my dear madam, first tell me what refined society is; then it is possible I may be able to demonstrate to you that true refinement and business habits and matters are more intimately connected than you are willing to allow."</p> 
               <p>"God save us from democratic notions!" exclaimed Mrs. Catchpenny. "I wish I had been born anywhere but in this disgusting country, where the rabble rule, and no one is in their proper place,-where all are crowding and kicking one another, in their race for popularity and power."</p> 
               <p>"It is a rule with me to be satisfied with what I have and am," rejoined young Andrews. "As to democracy, I can see no objection to the principle, provided it is not abused."</p> 
               <p>"I despise the doctrine of equality!" exclaimed Mrs. Catchpenny, "and hope to mercy there will be a revolution, before a great while, to explode the idea. Where everybody are equal, I should like to know what sort of social harmony or order can be expected; that's what <emph>I</emph> should like to know."</p> 
               <p>William, observing the irritated condition of Mrs. Catchpenny's mind, deemed it most prudent, as he had finished his supper, to bid the company good evening, and withdraw. He perceived the mischief he had done was a sore wound to Mrs. Catchpenny, and by no means over relished by the daughters; and he thought it was altogether useless to remain with them longer, for the purpose of counteracting the passions which had been aroused; so, excusing himself as well as he could, the confidential clerk left the tea-table, and made his way to the street.</p> 
               <p>The Catchpennys were now alone. They did not remain long at the tea-table, after our hero had departed, but withdrew to the parlors, which were superbly furnished and brilliantly lighted. We will not undertake to describe the arrangement of the dwelling, nor the elegance of the furniture. Suffice it to say, wealth had been lavished with a liberal hand, to make acceptable to this class in general, and to the Catchpennys in particular, their residence and its appointments. Nothing was wanting in luxury or convenience; it was a model fashionable establishment,-one of the head-quarters of presumption.</p> 
               <p>Mrs. Catchpenny had thrown herself on the sofa, still greatly disturbed by what had passed at the tea-table. She was not a woman easily subdued, when once her mind was thoroughly excited by either anger or disappointment. Laura seated herself at the piano, and commenced a pretty air from Sonambula, whilst Fanny amused herself with Longfellow's "Hiawatha," one of the most beautifully descriptive poems in the English language.</p> 
               <p>Presently the door-bell rung, and a young gentleman was ushered into the parlor. He wore a moustache that stretched itself out some distance from the lip, and gave him more the appearance of a wildcat than a man. His name was James Simpleton. His visits were more to Miss Laura than to Fanny, although the latter was quite a favorite.</p> 
               <p>"It's a fine evening, Laura," observed the youth, after the usual greetings; "a very fine evening. By the way, have you been out to-day-ah?"</p> 
               <p>"Yes, Fanny and I were on Washington-street, this afternoon, where we walked for some little time, then went round the Common."</p> 
               <p>"Ah-well, who did you see?" interrogated the beau, twirling his moustache with his fingers.</p> 
               <p>"Oh, lots of fools," said Fanny, turning over a leaf of Hiawatha.</p> 
               <p>"Be still, Fanny, be still," exclaimed Mrs. Catchpenny<pb n="92-93" xml:id="VAC6064-00000047"/> penny, "if you can't be a little more refined in your expressions."</p> 
               <p>"I'll tell you who we saw," returned Laura; "those Inconceivables, who have struggled for so many years to be somebodies."</p> 
               <p>"Ha! ha! ha!" roared the youth; "you are rather severe on the Inconceivables, are you not-ah?"</p> 
               <p>"No she isn't, not a bit," exclaimed Mrs. Catchpenny. "Those people have worked harder than anybody I know of to get into <emph>our</emph> set."</p> 
               <p>"Well, they've succeeded, haven't they?" queried Mr. Simpleton. "That's more than a good many others have done-ah."</p> 
               <p>"Yes, but you know how they are laughed at," said Fanny; "old Mrs. Inconceivable in particular."</p> 
               <p>"Mechanics! I must say I don't altogether like the idea of associating with mechanics," spoke up Mrs. Catchpenny, "however public spirited and virtuous they may be; and if I mistake not, Mr. Simpleton, this is about your feeling, as it must be the feeling of all our 'best families.'"</p> 
               <p>"Ah-well, Mrs. Catchpenny, to be frank with you, I must say I was born and bred an aristocrat," replied the youth; "but nevertheless, I have no little respect for and sympathy with hard-working people. As to these Inconceivables, I am disposed to tolerate them, on the principle that there is no such thing as keeping any set or circle, in this country, truly <emph>select;</emph> so I say if this family and others want to rise, and struggle hard to do so, why let them. We've all, probably, been down, in the persons of our ancestry, at some time or other. So let us not be too hard on others-ah."</p> 
               <p>"You are very just, indeed, Mr. Simpleton," exclaimed Laura; "and it seems to me that all who can rise ought to; only don't let them put on airs, that's all;-don't let them try to put down their betters, so soon as they are permitted intercourse with them."</p> 
               <p>"Oh, I am very much amused," said Fanny, "at many persons who are struggling to get into <emph>our</emph> set. For instance, there are the Paddingtons; they are about on a par with the Inconceivables, and certainly have as much claim to preferment; but some how or other they don't rise."</p> 
               <p>"Well, I'll tell you how it is," exclaimed Mrs. Catchpenny; "that Mrs. Paddington is so proud she will not take the usual steps of working in with us, but expects us, I suppose, in admiration of her personal attractions and stylish mode of living, to <emph>beg</emph> her to join 'our set'; and this, too, when she is dying for the want of the privilege. Was there ever such stupidity heard of. Just as though <emph>we</emph> or any of 'our set' are going to <emph>her!</emph> No! she must come to <emph>us;</emph> and she'll find this out, too, in time, I'll warrant you."</p> 
               <p>As Mrs. Catchpenny concluded, her voice assumed a good deal of passion. She was evidently provoked at the idea of any person's supposing she would put <emph>herself</emph> out to gain even the most pretending over to her society. As she had stooped, and stooped very low, too, to ingratiate herself into the "best society," she was determined this should be the condition on which all others should enter. Mrs. Catchpenny was a curious woman, but not unlike the majority of those who composed her exclusive set. She was heartless and worldly, and so were they all.</p> 
               <p>Laura and Fanny continued in conversation with the young man, laughing at and ridiculing many, both in and out of their set. Laura was an exceedingly envious young lady, and delighted in back-biting. This was her chief amusement. Fanny, evidently of this disposition; was not so much inclined to indulge it as her sister; for she knew less of the world, and had met with no disappointments. Mr. Simpleton was just such a person as Laura was pleased to talk with, because he appeared to enter into her feelings, and laughed at her railery.</p> 
               <p>We will not detail the conversation which passed between the young man and the Catchpennys, but will declare it, in general terms, to have been, on the part of the ladies, full of envy, malice, and all uncharitableness. Mrs. Catchpenny vowed vengeance on Andrews, whom we are to meet again in the next chapter.</p>

               <p>PASSING from this abode of sensuality and impotent pomposity, we will ask the reader to follow us in pursuit of young Andrews, who, upon gaining the street, directed his steps towards the Public Garden, into which he entered, and passed on to the seats then located near the Mill Dam. Upon one of these he threw himself, and burst into immoderate laughter. "The Catchpennys," he remarked to himself, so soon as he was able to give expression to his thoughts, "have had enough of me for this year, at least; and I am quite sure the Touchmenots will not be anxious for my company the balance of their lives. Tea, to be sure! So I must be dragged in to tea, only to be kicked out after. Poor creatures I how ignorant they are, in all their crinoline and splendor! They ride in their carriage, and assume to be <emph>first,</emph> while their coachman could school them in good sound sense and practical wisdom. Poor creatures! what delusion marks their lives, and the lives, in fact, of all who exist solely for the gratification of their pride."</p> 
               <p>Andrews had but just concluded, when the moon broke through a heavy cloud, which for some time had shut it out from view; and so struck was he with its clearness, its soft, mellow brightness, that he stretched himself on the bench, and fell into a profound revery. The moon! who has not come under its influence?-who has not yielded to its magnetism, and lost themselves selves in the contemplation of its fascinating power, in conjunction with those lesser lights that twinkle in their far distant spheres? <q>

               <p>Our hero lay motionless, gazing on these glorious mysteries, when suddenly escaped his lips the following quotation from Don Juan: <q>
                     <lg type="quotation"> 
                        <l>"'Oh, good society!-'t is but a game,</l>

                  </q> "Poor Mrs. Touchmenot and her daughter Julia!" continued he; "would they could know how ridiculous they and their set appear to sensible, thorough-bred people!-would they could look upon this gorgeous sky, and learn humility from its imposing grandeur! But no, their leaden thoughts do not rise above the latest fashion and the sayings and doings of its voteries. What to them is nature, through which God speaks, to those who seek him, with a visible, tangible presence,-an ever-living reality! What to them is goodness, love? Mere airy nothings, without a local habitation or a name."</p> 
               <p>A footstep, coupled with a sigh, now startled him, when, raising his head from the bench, he beheld a female form standing near, habited in black, and screened by a dark, heavy veil. He gazed at her for a moment, then politely invited her to be seated. She seemed reluctant to rest herself, and moved off, with a slow step, towards the Mill Dam, without having spoken a word. Her bearing was that of a lady, and her figure of classic <unclear>mould</unclear>.</p> 
               <p>The young man's first impulse was to follow her, but<pb n="96-97" xml:id="VAC6064-00000049"/> the sober, second thought prevailed, and he remained on the bench, exceedingly curious to know something of the personage that had just passed on. It was between eight and nine of the clock, and there appeared to be no one in the garden save this woman and himself, if we except an individual who was reclining under the young trees at some distance. A mystery seemed to attach itself to her, which young Andrews was very desirous to solve; and, indeed, her presence had so excited him,-so filled him with a certain indiscribable perturbation, that he rose from his seat, and followed directly in her steps.</p> 
               <p>As he came up, she suddenly turned about, and, in a resolute, clear voice, said, "What do you want, sir?"</p> 
               <p>Our hero was somewhat startled at her manner, and for a moment lost his self-possession; on regaining which he thus replied, "I am not surprised, good lady, that you are so severe. I have approached you unrequested, and deserve no better reception. But pardon me if I ask what, at this hour of the evening, brings you, unattended, to this lonely spot?"</p> 
               <p>The woman turned away, and, uttering no word, walked on, but not without having discovered something of her features, which were dimly to be seen through the veil, by the light of the moonbeams. They were well formed, and appeared to him chaste and beautiful. Now, more than ever, he was resolved to discover, if possible, who this mysterious being might be, and again put himself in pursuit.</p> 
               <p>As he approached, she slackened her pace, and when he drew near, she boldly confronted him, saying, "Follow me, sir, another step, and you are-"</p> 
               <p>"Oh, be not angry, lady," interrupted Andrews, not at all embarrassed by the harsh manner of the female; "be not angry. Do you suppose there is any power on earth can deter me from executing my firm resolve to know who and what you are? Follow you I will, and fifty lives, had I them to give, would be freely offered for some knowledge of so strange a being."</p> 
               <p>"Ah, you seek to know me," returned the woman, warily: "but wherefore? I am not thy equal, perchance chance. What wouldst thou with a knowledge of me?"</p> 
               <p>"Your figure, your bearing, have aroused my imagination," replied the young man. "I must, I <emph>will</emph> know you!"</p> 
               <p>"You call me a lady," returned the woman; "how know you that?" and as she spoke, she turned and walked away.</p> 
               <p>The young man hesitated a moment, and was about relinquishing his purpose, when there was an interior, audible command, in these words,-"Follow her." Again he was in pursuit, and upon overtaking the woman, she received him with less displeasure, of which he was not slow to avail.</p> 
               <p>"So, you do not love the world," remarked the woman, in a deep, sad tone. "Has it not used you well?"</p> 
               <p>"Yes, much better than I deserve, doubtless," returned our hero. "I love it not, because it is so prone to evil."</p> 
               <p>"Ah, that is it," rejoined the woman; "then you would have men and things more perfect,-you would be, perhaps, a reformer. Well, God knows there is need of reform in every department and phase of life."</p> 
               <p>"Yes, yes; but come," rejoined the young man, "tell me something of yourself, won't you?"</p> 
               <p>"Why need you care for me?" replied the female, carelessly. "We never met before; we may never meet again."</p> 
               <p>"But we shall meet again!" exclaimed the young man, in a resolute tone; "and, if I mistake not, we <emph>have</emph> met before."</p> 
               <p>"Where, oh, where?" interrogated the woman, with evident surprise.</p> 
               <p>"Did you ever hear or know of an old beggar man, by the name of Throckmorton?" inquired Andrews, earnestly.</p> 
               <p>"Yes, yes," replied the woman, nervously, "very well. He had a pretty dog, called 'Bone,' who loved me very much, and was often at my room."</p> 
               <pb n="98-99" xml:id="VAC6064-00000050"/> 
               <p>"Then you resided in the neighborhood of this beggar?" interrogated Andrews.</p> 
               <p>"Yes, with my mother, in a small house opposite," returned the female. "There was a family by the name of Andrews, who was very kind to old Throckmorton, particularly the little boy, of whom mother used to say he was the handsomest and most manly child she ever saw."</p> 
               <p>"You lived opposite, you say?" interrogated young Andrews.</p> 
               <p>"Yes, directly opposite," returned his companion.</p> 
               <p>"I remember you quite well," rejoined our hero; "and what is still more strange, I dreamed last night, I should see you. Know that I was that little boy,-the beggar's friend."</p> 
               <p>"What, you,-are you Willie Andrews," interrogated the female, unable to conceal her surprise, "whom we used to think of and speak of so often,-whom, indeed, everybody in our neighborhood loved so well?"</p> 
               <p>"And are you Agnes Farriday, who sang so sweetly to the guitar, and lived in a small house just opposite?" again inquired the young man. "You moved away, a short time after the beggar's death, and I lost all traces of you. But your face I remember well, for it is the only face I ever truly loved! Unveil fully, will you not?"</p> 
               <p>"Yes," returned the female, "to <emph>you,</emph> yes!"</p> 
               <p>She threw aside her veil, and by the mellow moonlight he beheld the supremely beautiful face of Agnes Farriday. When he last looked upon it, as she sat by the window of her humble home, playing the guitar, she was but a girl. She is now a well-developed and handsome woman, with much of the youthful freshness and feature still remaining to her mature years. As Andrews gazed upon her, he almost fancied she was yet the child of his early remembrance. He had never forgotten that sweet face, that graceful form; for his eye was that of an artist, which is retentive of all beautiful impressions. It seemed to him like a dream to meet again, and under <emph>such</emph> circumstances, the only being on earth who was associated in his mind with all that was lovely and desirable sirable in woman. He felt a rapture which words cannot faithfully express, and much of his delight was transmitted to his beautiful companion; for she believed herself an object of no common interest to this young man, who had sought and made her acquaintance through opposition, led on, as it were, by the spirit. He had dreamed that he should meet her on that day, to which he gave no heed until observing the mysterious figure in the garden, when his dream immediately occurred to him, and he resolved to pursue her; and, when about to relinquish his purpose, audible was the whisper, or spiritual impression, to "follow her." He obeyed, and ample he deemed his reward; for he had found in this mysterious being a woman to love.</p> 
               <p>"Tell me, Mr. Andrews," said Agnes, "tell me what has become of Bone. Is he dead, or alive?"</p> 
               <p>"Bone? why he is alive, and in finer spirits than ever," returned our hero.</p> 
               <p>"I should like to own that noble dog," rejoined Agnes, "very much,-yes, very much; he has such a musical ear."</p> 
               <p>"He is mine to give, and he shall be yours, if you will accept him," tenderly rejoined Andrews; "but I set a great deal by Bone, and must indeed honor her to whom I would give him."</p> 
               <p>"You are married, are you not?" queried Agnes, coyly.</p> 
               <p>"No," responded Andrews. "Why do you ask?"</p> 
               <p>"I knew of a Miss Ida Robertson," rejoined Agnes, "whom report said you were much attached to. I thought perhaps this attachment might have continued."</p> 
               <p>"No, no," replied Andrews, earnestly; "she can never be my wife. Wherever I place my affections, and consequently stake my happiness, I should expect a true heart, a just and noble character."</p> 
               <p>"That is well," replied Agnes, as she took his arm, and walked towards the Common. "I am now going to my humble home, which consists of a small house, in the north part of the city. Will you accompany me?"</p> 
               <p>"Certainly, with pleasure," replied Andrews, offering her his arm, of which she readily availed.</p> 
               <pb n="100-101" xml:id="VAC6064-00000051"/> 
               <p>They walked together up Beacon-street. At some distance behind them was a tall individual, muffled in a dark cloak, dogging them, whom we noticed in the garden, by the trees. But as they were close in conversation, and did not observe particularly even the passers by, less likely would they be to discover a person afar off in their rear.</p> 
               <p>Andrews was truly happy to have met again the being he had never ceased to think of,-the only being whose sweet features had touched, and ineffaceably, his emotional soul. To unite <emph>her</emph> fate with <emph>his,</emph> was the future, and one of the most cherished purposes of his life! As they walked on through Tremont, Court, and Hanover Streets, so much engaged were they with the happy sentiments of their sympathetic natures, that they were altogether unobservant of the man in the dark cloak, who had the air of a gentleman, and by whom they were, at some little distance, watchfully pursued!</p> 
               <p>D-n him, d-n him," muttered the stranger, "he stands in my path, and out of it he must get, or, by my soul, he dies! and speedily. As he said this his eyes flashed in the gas light, with the intensity of desperation.</p>

               <p>YOUNG ANDREWS, happy in a degree, never before experienced, at having again met Agnes Farriday, after so long a period since he first beheld her charming face, accompanied her to the dwelling which she occupied at the north part of the city, followed closely by the tall man in a dark cloak, who passed and repassed them several times, and in such close proximity, as to jostle the impetuous and high spirited Andrews. She was the first to note that they were pursued by this mysterious personage, who kept his face so well concealed by his cloak as to defy detection. Of late she had been very much annoyed, by a man who had daily passed and repassed her house, and who had addressed her the most passionate protestations of love, which she had invariably returned to the source from whence they came. His name was Rolston; a lawyer of some standing, and of "one of our first families." Agnes believed the personage in the dark cloak to be him. She, therefore, cautioned Andrews to be on his guard, as it was well known that Mr. Rolston was a person of violent, indeed, desperate passions, and that he had been much incenced at the failure of his endeavors to win her friendship. Agnes did not doubt the sincerity of his sentiments, but she could not respect his habits, which were those of a fashionable man, fond of his wine, the gaming table, and a good time, generally. He wished to marry her, and he frankly told her, that it was her beauty which he loved. If there was a being on earth for whom Miss Farriday had a loathing,-and whose society she would carefully avoid,-it was the sensualist, and though Rolston combined many attractions for most any woman, he lacked that one more essential than all the rest in the estimation of Agnes-virtue! And, for this reason, and this alone, she denied him her acquaintance. This refusal<pb n="102-103" xml:id="VAC6064-00000052"/> sal embittered his heart, and plunged him deeper into error than ever. He gambled with greater recklessness, and treated his business friends in such a loose, indifferent manner, that his practice fell off to a degree, that only added to his hate of the world, which he was in the habit of calling, since his unreturned passion for Agnes, "a d--n nest of wasps!" Rolston prided himself greatly on his family, which he averred was descended from the peerage of England; and that <emph>he</emph> should be denied the acquaintance of an obscure, though lovely woman, whom he was willing to marry, outraged his vanity and lascerated his heart! He watched her narrowly; and as we have seen, was in the garden on the evening when she met Andrews, whither he had, unobserved, pursued her. He had resolved to know as much of her habits and friendships as a daring and vigilant <foreign xml:lang="FRA">espionage</foreign> would permit. In the heat of his passion he had sworn, no man should marry her but him! Towards Andrews, whom he well knew, he entertained a fierce and bitter hatred; into whose heart he could have plunged a dagger, as he saw his lips pressed against those of Farriday's, on parting with her at the door of her neat though humble dwelling.</p> 
               <p>As the young man passed by the place where Rolston had concealed himself, that he might, unobserved, note the movements of both parties, he was joined by the lawyer, who, in a subdued tone of passion enquired, "How long he had known Miss Farriday?"</p> 
               <p>"Who are you, sir, that I should be catechised thus?" interrogated Andrews, somewhat startled by the manner of the lawyer.</p> 
               <p>"My name is William Andrews; now, for yours," continued our hero. "I must know, my dear sir, who and what you are."</p> 
               <p>Rolston drew closer about his face his dark cloak, and pulling over his eyes more carefully than ever his felt hat, said:</p> 
               <p>"I, sir, am a <emph>man,</emph> fully your peer, if not your superior; in the welfare of this woman I have a brother's, father's, ay, lover's interest and care. I demand to be informed how long you have known her, and what may be your intentions."</p> 
                
               <p>"If, sir," rejoined Andrews, "you are the man I suspect you to be, and of whom she has warned me, I tell you now, in the presence of yon bright moon, that I defy and despise you. If your name is <emph>Rolston,</emph> you are a scoundrel for pursuing one who forbids your addresses, and loathes your character; a fellow, sir, with whom I wish no commerce, and for whom I have no respect."</p> 
               <p>"These, sir, are bold words," returned Rolston, "to one too, of whose passions you know naught; what if I should slay you on the spot?"</p> 
               <p>"You would but kill one who does not fear to die;" replied Andrews, proudly; "and whom no words of yours, or mortal man, can intimidate."</p> 
               <p>"I like your pluck, fellow," returned Rolston, "and I would you stood not in my way."</p> 
               <p>"I, sir, am only too happy to be thus posted," replied Andrews. "If you are Rolston, as I believe you to be, I would be placed not otherwise, since you pursue a woman, who never can, and <emph>never shall be yours!</emph>"</p> 
               <p>"Ay, my fine fellow, you are flippant; did your mother never whip you for your twaddle?" sarcastically returned Rolston.</p> 
               <p>"It matters not who, nor what I am; whether Rolston, or Pontius Pilate: I love Agnes, and hate all those who oppose my passion. Beware, beware, young man, how you provoke me; for I am desperate in this cause, and will die a thousand deaths to defeat my foes. From the moment I first beheld the divine face and form of Farriday, I was inspired to attempt her conquest, and eternally damned be those who aim to disappoint my hopes. Death, or Agnes, is my motto; death to her, to me, and all who intermeddle!"</p> 
               <p>"Be it so, then, thou concealed braggart," replied Andrews; "who, ashamed of open converse, belch forth brave sounds from beneath a mask impenetrable. I tell you here and now, that Agnes is mine; nor can you, nor all hell combined dispossess me of this treasure. It was my boyhood's first delight; it is my manhood's glory!"</p> 
               <p>"Ah, I am on fire with hate. This determined dog must die; die, and now; ay, now," muttered Rolston, unheard. Then continued he, aloud, "Sir, I love brave men, and by your speech I so esteem you; and were it not that you are my foe, I would embrace you as a brother!"</p> 
               <pb n="104-105" xml:id="VAC6064-00000053"/> 
               <p>"I have freely given you my name," returned Andrews; "and yet yours is still withheld. I can hold no further conversation with one whom I do not know. Concealment is no way of mine."</p> 
               <p>"He is indeed an adversary I well may dread, and by my soul, he dies this night. He shall not escape me. My dagger, my dagger," muttered Rolston, inaudibly. Then continued he, aloud: "Mr. Andrews, your hand, before we part. You are a worthy, brave fellow, and I honor you. The gem we both do covet shall be thine, and thus I leave it with thee,-eternity!" At these words he sheathed his dagger in the bosom of our hero, and fled, while Andrews fell heavily to the ground.</p> 
               <p>Agnes, apprehensive that a difficulty might occur, armed herself with a revolver, and followed Andrews with the intention of placing it in his possession. Observing him in conversation with the man who had dogged them, and whom she supposed to be Rolston, she concealed herself at some little distance where she could observe their movements. Impatient at their parley, she was about to return home, when she saw Andrews fall, and Rolston fleeing directly towards the point, at which she stood. The cries of Andrews determined her to confront the assassin with her pistol, and to destroy him unless he submitted to arrest. Her bold, determined manner, brought Rolston to a stand. Her loud cries of murder aroused the watch and the neighborhood, who, surrounding the murderer, attempted his capture; but he was a powerful man, and used his weapon so skillfully, that no one dared arrest him. With a desperate rush he broke through the crowd, but was soon again surrounded and taken. Agnes Farriday had gone to the assistance of Andrews. She found with him a physician, who said his wound was mortal. She directed that he should be borne to her house, that he might die beneath the roof of one who loved him tenderly. Rolston, in a moment of desperation at learning that Andrews was dying, and in fear of the testimony of Agnes, plunged his dagger into his own breast, exclaiming, "Thus do I anticipate the law!" He begged that Agnes might be brought to him, as there was something he would say to her. The excited crowd made way as Agnes approached, who, standing near the prostrate form of Rolston, with his head supported by a watchman, listened with a marble countenance to this desperado's words.</p> 
               <p>"Agnes Farriday," said he, in a voice clear, though weak, "on thy head be my blood and that of Andrews. My love despised, was an ever wakeful sorrow, which now, hath end. I say not that I am guilty of his murder, but I'm pleased that it is so. You will now have learned the force of passion; and when again some ardent, reckless soul may love thy beauty, and desire thy heart, thou wilt perhaps remember to avoid his wrath; for where one's love is deep, woman! there look when love is outraged for a deeper hate!"</p> 
               <p>"Rolston, much as you have wronged me in the murder of one dearer to me than life itself, I can and do forgive your crime," returned Agnes, in a voice of rare sweetness, which moved the crowd to tears; "and I pray," she continued, "that God may have mercy on your soul." "Thy hand, sweet one," said he, in the faintest whisper, and as he took the small delicate hand of Agnes in his own, he breathed his last.</p> 
               <p>Agnes pushed from his noble massive brow, the dark wavy hair, and looking full in his determined intellectual face, said, "May God forgive you as I do, thou misguided man!" The crowd again made way, as Agnes passed on to her dwelling, whither Andrews had been borne by the physician. As they looked upon her majestic countenance lit by a dark, deep, and courageous eye, many were the suppressed exclamations, in laudation of her chaste beauty which were all unheeded by her, however, whose soul was wrapped in the gloom of sorrow, such as she had never before experienced. No sooner had she entered the room where Andrews lay bleeding from his wound, than she approached his couch, and bending tenderly over him, kissed his cold, damp brow, passionately, while his full deep blue eyes were riveted upon her.</p> 
               <p>"Agnes," said he, in a low tone, "when I am gone, do not forget to take good care of 'Bone;' he was a beggar's gift, 'tis true; yet, this animal was an early love I'd have thee cherish."</p> 
               <p>"Trust my fidelity to all <emph>thou</emph> ever loved," replied Agnes; "I will live in <emph>thee.</emph>"</p>

               <p>IN the lives of most persons who are left unprotected in the world, there is more or less of hardship and romance; especially is this true of women! In the metropolis of New England, instances of female suffering and intrigue, are innumerable. Too proud to remain in their country homes, dependent upon a father's or brother's support, they crowd into the city, with the hope, that something will offer whereby they can provide themselves with the necessaries of life. But as very many of them are unskilled in such employment as they seek, and are of too great pride to offer themselves as house women, they fall into the hands of perveyors, and soon become known as "women of the town." In this way are our brothels filled to repletion, and our principle streets made a parade ground of licentiousness. All are to be pitied whose necessities oblige them to a shameful means of support. We should, however, be slow to admit, that one's necessities need drive them to such means of relief as aiding, or practising prostitution, if they will but make their condition known and exert themselves to keep in the path of virtue. The sons-in-law of the Penniman's we have said were fond of fast women, and we are now about to introduce the reader to the Mistress of Donothing, whom Agnes Farriday was endeavoring to reform.</p> 
               <p>In a room in a neat small brick house on N . . . p Street, (some three weeks previous to the meeting of Agnes and Andrews,) sat a beautiful young woman, partly reclining on the sofa; she was fashionably dressed, and had the appearance of a lady; she was in tears:

               </p> 
               <p>Such is and such must ever be the shame of all women who rank among this class.</p> 
               <p>As we have said, Irene Caruthers (for such was the name of Donothing's mistress) was a most beautiful woman, and deserved a better fate than that of a courtezan. She was the daughter of a clergyman of New Hampshire, of high standing in his profession; her mother was a superior woman. Irene, unhappy in her home, left in company with a gentleman for New York, who had promised to marry her on their arrival there. A wild and<pb n="108-109" xml:id="VAC6064-00000055"/> romantic girl, such an adventure had many charms for her. She thought it would be so "nice a triumph over parental authority," which had been so great a restraint upon her foolish desires, that she had come to regard these, her best friends, with suspicion, and as her worse and most cruel enemies! Sad was her heart, when she came to learn the true character of the man with whom she had eloped. A desperate and unprincipled libertine, he espoused the romantic and too trustful girl one month, only to desert her the next! This broke her parents' hearts, who died partly in consequence of their daughter's conduct, whom they had labored earnestly to direct in the path of usefulness, happiness, and honor. She had now no home to return to; she was left destitute in the world.</p> 
               <p>For a time she labored to support herself with the needle; but her health, which never was robust, failed from close confinement to work, when she was forced to accept the friendship of a man who had become interested in her. With him she lived until his death, which was caused by an affection of the heart. She then came to Boston, where chance directed her to Mrs. Penniman for assistance. This worldly woman, proud and heartless, told her to go to work at anything rather than beg! It was at this time that she first saw Donothing. He was charmed with her beauty; and determined to pursue her. The Pennimans' money, therefore, supported her to whom they had denied all charity. Could Mrs. Penniman have known this fact, she would have expired, in all probability, in a fit of rage! and the much injured wife, too, her haughty daughter, how she would have wept, to know another unlawfully shared with her the love and purse of Donothing. But this gay Lothario was a consummate rogue, and so managed his amours, that none even suspected his infidelity; his "loving, doating wife" was perhaps the last person who would have insinuated even aught against her "hubby." Donothing was generous towards his mistress; anything she might desire he procured; presents of the most costly kind he lavished upon her, yet he was at times exceedingly harsh, and abused her as he oftentimes abused his wife. As she sat dejected ed on the sofa, Donothing entered the room just from a dinner party; he was somewhat over merry. The agitated soul of Irene, so visible in her delicate and beautiful features, which were wont to wear a gay and joyous expression, at once arrested his attention; her eye was loaded with <emph>melancholy,</emph> and her face was as a beautiful, though darkly shaded picture. The young man seated himself beside her, placed his arm around her waste, and was about kissing her, when she pushed him aside, repeating this reproof as often as he attempted to caress her. Wearied by his efforts to overcome her strange and unnatural mood, being heated with wine, his patience soon gave way, when he exclaimed:</p> 
               <p>"Since you are so sulky, I'll have nothing more to say to you! Why do you not speak; why not tell me what's the matter?"</p> 
               <p>"My sins, Oh, my sins-weigh heavy on my soul!" replied the girl, sobbing aloud.</p> 
               <p>"A fit of righteousness!" rejoined the lover. "Oh, that's it. Well, I am glad to know it's nothing worse. Perhaps you are not aware of it, but I'm partially drunk, and your melancholy is infernal annoying; yes, infernal annoying! Why in the name of Csar, when I most need your best face are you so d-n glum? I came here this evening expecting to find you 'in fine feather,' instead of which, you are about as stupid as it is possible to be. I'll quit you altogether, if this sort of work is to go on. You'll get no more money from me, Chick, unless you change your tactics."</p> 
               <p>"Money!" ejaculated Irene, "and what do you suppose I care about money? If I can save my soul in Christ, 'tis all I ask;" and as she spoke, she drew a long deep sigh.</p> 
               <p>"Nonsense, nonsense, Irene," returned her lover! with a hiccough, "you're a fool,-so all this fuss is about your soul; indeed, indeed? Mark my advice; look out for your body! and let the soul take care of itself: if you had as good a dinner, and as much choice wine under your ribs, as I have under mine, you'd be as jolly as a jack tar just in from a voyage round the world. Gods! how jolly I am; I only wish you felt half as well;" and<pb n="110-111" xml:id="VAC6064-00000056"/> as he said this, he chucked the conscience-stricken girl under the chin, and proceeded to put his arm about her body in order to draw her into his lap, but she resisted his advances with even more determination than before. He was now in a furious passion; his self-love, ardent and unbounded, as is always the case with weak persons, who pride themselves on family connections, was wounded; he had been a warm friend of Irene's, having furnished her with a good deal of money, and to find her now so cold, touched his vanity, and disappointed his heart. In "women of pleasure" he had no confidence whatever, and he attributed Irene's conduct to the "tricks of the wanton," and not to any desire to reform her course of life. What her object could be in these tears-these feigned signs of sorrow-he was at a loss to conjecture; though he was quite sure she was playing a deep, deep game. Vesta hath claimed her for her fires; the groves of Daphn she hath forever fled; she would be chaste! This in the estimation of Donothing was an idea too absurd for a moment's regard; he did not believe, nor did he conceive it possible, for a courtezan to become a respectable woman, any more than it is in the power of the Ethiopian to change his skin, or the leopard his spots. But Donothing was a licentious reprobate, to whom the Bible was a fable, and Heaven a dream! He knew not of that <emph>inner life,</emph> which through love of God, and reverence for holy things, is preserved to those who exhibit little or no sign of piety in the manner of their living; still, "the voice of conscience" is not stifled, that <emph>inner life</emph> is yet preserved, and with it the spirit of prayer! which St. Augustine says, is the evidence to every one that God's mercy had not forsaken us.</p> 
               <p>Irene's sobs grew louder as she perceived Donothing to be entirely ignorant of the great change which was working in her, through the power of the Holy Ghost! She grieved that he should be so hardened a sinner, and so blind to the beauty of repentance.</p> 
               <p>"I don't want," said he, "anything to do with a woman, who conducts herself in this manner."</p> 
               <p>"I sincerely wish you would leave me," rejoined Irene, in heart broken tones; sighing deeply. "You will never again find me what I have been. I do not want your money; I do not want any man's money as the wages of sin! No, no, God knows my heart; I would be wholly his!"</p> 
               <p>"Nonsense!" ejaculated Donothing; "who has been stuffing so much piety into your head all at once; ha! ha! ha! I've heard women talk in this way before, but it was only to get up a greater interest in their behalf. I understand, oh, I understand, perfectly; you can't fool me; I've crossed the line; I'm up to snuff, depend on't."</p> 
               <p>Irene wept copiously, and appeared greatly convulsed with grief, at this inhuman language. Donothing seemed to her, in her contrition, like an incarnate fiend. And so in truth he was, as far as any regard for her repentant sorrow is to be considered. Doubting the sincerity of her tears he cared little for the expression of her sufferings. Gazing at her with an eye, intense with indignant scorn, he muttered:</p> 
               <p>"Strumpet!" he paused a moment, then continued: "Oh, I can't stand this-I'm off, you must look yourself up some other friend."</p> 
               <p>Irene for the first time raised her head, and fixing her large, grief-stricken eyes directly upon Donothing, said, mournfully:</p> 
               <p>"Oh, sir, you know not how painful to me is your inconsiderate language; yet it does not surprise me; I perhaps deserve it all. I am a woman, whose misconduct justly attaches suspicion to my sincerity. I know you will not believe, I am resolved on a pious future; no one, perhaps, will believe it, until time shall be witness to my truth! I do not ask any one to credit me; I know that I am fallen low; and am despised by those who have not been so unfortunate. Yet Christ, oh, Christ is with me, whose all sufficient support I have. I do not ask your friendship more in sin; but if you will strive to understand the inner life which connects us with religion and God, I shall then be only too happy to number you among my friends."</p> 
               <p>"What a pow-wow, to be sure," exclaimed Donothing, "about what no sensible people think of, until they get<pb n="112-113" xml:id="VAC6064-00000057"/> so far advanced in years as not to be able to think of anythink else-religion and an inner life! Fudge, who has been working you into this crack-brained state. Agnes Farriday, I'll bet my life."</p> 
               <p>Irene made no reply, but with her face buried in her 'kerchief, motioned him away.</p> 
               <p>"Oh, you want me to go, do you?" continued Donothing with a hiccough. "Well, then, give me a kiss, and I'll leave you to yourself, to work off this little bit of lunacy; you are evidently in a d-n bad way; that's all I've got to say about it: with your inner life and reformatory doctrines. Havn't you got wit enough to know, that it's no use for a woman 'on the town,' to try to support herself off of it. There is a brand of shame on you, that the waters of the two hemispheres will never wipe out; the world will never forgive or forget your sins; make up your mind to that; and don't make a bigger fool of yourself, by trying to fight your way back again to decency; you can't do it; and it's no use to try. You ought to know by this time what delight those experience who are up in the scale of virtue, in kicking and keeping others down."</p> 
               <p>Poor Irene wept as though her heart would break at the rough and unfeeling discourse of Donothing, particularly as she recognized in his remarks no little truth. Still her faith in God's love was undiminished, and she felt a confidence in the Scriptural plan of salvation, which could not be shaken. She was resolved to respect the voice of conscience, and seek peace of mind in <emph>virtue;</emph> which Plato says, "is not a thing to be taught, nor derived from nature, but exists by a divine allotment to those who possess it." We do not altogether agree with that great philosopher, though we quote him with much reverence. We think virtue maybe taught, and it also may be derived from nature; that it is likewise of divine allotment is most true.</p> 
               <p>"Since you are so out of sorts," remarked Donothing, "so inconsolable, so ridiculous, I will betake myself to the theatre to see the 'Road to Ruin.' Only just give me a kiss, and I am off. I never, upon my word, found you so stupid before. If this is what is called 'getting religion,' deliver me from it." As he concluded, he drew Irene's hand from her face, and kissed her several times, but she received his caresses in a perfectly passive, and apparently abstracted manner; without manifesting pleasure at his familiarity. As he was about to leave the room, she tenderly said:</p> 
               <p>"You have a wife, sir; respect your vows to her. Do not, oh, do not continue to deceive the lawful partner of your bosom."</p> 
               <p>Donothing, irritated to find this unfortunate young woman in such an unhappy state of mind, did not choose to remain long in her company. He was an incorrigible rake, and experienced no pleasure in the presence of melancholy and tears. Of that school of philosophy which places the chief good of life in low sensual enjoyment-the body and not the soul was his principal care. As he opened the door and was passing into the entry, he turned to Irene and said:</p> 
               <p>"What in the devil's name ails you, is more than I know-(hiccough); but d-n me, unless you behave better in future, you'll get no more money out of me." And thereupon he closed the door with great violence and left the house.</p> 
               <p>Irene was pleased at his departure, but could not repress the fresh flood of tears, his parting words had occasioned; he seemed so brutal; yet he was the same that he had always been; the change was not in <emph>him,</emph> but in <emph>her.</emph> She had entered into a spiritual sphere of contrition, repentance, and trust in Jesus, which he did not nor could not understand, and whither he was unable to follow her. He was no longer a companion, therefore, for Irene. She would, however, have been most happy to have carried him with her into this new and Christian life, if she had felt the least encouragement to make the attempt. She knew Donothing too well, to have any present hope of his reformation; there did not appear to be the least spark of godliness in his soul; he was emphatically "dead in sin." This hopeful relative of the Pennimans had not been gone many minutes, when Agnes entered. A low sad sob was all the greeting she received.</p> 
               <p>Agnes, touched at the doleful sight, advanced and seated herself on the sofa by the side of Irene, and kissed her tenderly.</p> 
               <pb n="114-115" xml:id="VAC6064-00000058"/> 
               <p>"Don't cry, Irene," said Agnes, "what has happened?"</p> 
               <p>It was some moments before the grief-stricken girl could reply; at length she sighed:</p> 
               <p>"Oh, nothing-nothing. I have been, Agnes, a very wicked woman. It is the vivid consciousness of my guilt that overpowers me."</p> 
               <p>"Then promise me you will sin no more," rejoined Agnes. "You know how often I have begged you to fly this life of debauchery, and be <emph>honest;</emph> you know how I have condemned this Mr. Donothing and his intimates. If you will reform, all that is in my power to do for you will be done cheerfully."</p> 
               <p>"Thank you, oh, thank you, Agnes," returned Irene; "you are too good, too good." And as she concluded, she wept vehemently.</p> 
               <p>"Oh, do not weep, my friend. I do nothing in all this but my bounden duty. Think how kind was Christ to the woman of Samaria, whom he met at the well, far deeper in sin than yourself. His words of love reformed her, and love alone! So would I strengthen you by my affection."</p> 
               <p>"A thousand thanks! Oh, I never thought there was such kindness in my sex," said Irene, still weeping. "But what to do I know not," continued she.</p> 
               <p>"Prepare yourself for a teacher of the young," earnestly counselled Agnes. "Here is a most honorable field for you."</p> 
               <p>"It is," returned Irene; "but-but, ah, think of what I am. Can this shame which is upon me ever be effaced or forgotten? No, no!" And with these words she moaned most pitifully.</p> 
               <p>"Be calm and hopeful, Irene," replied Agnes, in a sympathetic voice, "and respect yourself. If you are determined to reform, you will have every encouragement from the good, and will be welcomed back to places of usefulness and honor. Have faith in Jesus! His especial call was to sinners, and the broken hearted."</p> 
               <p>"So it was, so it was," returned Irene, lifting her pale and agitated countenance from between her hands, and looking lovingly, and hopefully, into the sympathetic face of Farriday. "Oh, my friend,"-and as she said this she took the hand of Agnes tremblingly in her own,-"my best and only friend, if I thought my blessed Lord and Master, Jesus of Nazereth! would over-look my past transactions, I should be so happy, so happy. In this trust I would not falter in an honorable cause, however meanly society might regard my determination."</p> 
               <p>"Be that trust then thine!" exclaimed Agnes, "for in the Epistle general of John, it is written: 'If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.' No, my dear Irene, if you are indeed repentant, and the Holy Ghost is upon you, and you feel accepted of God, be assured your sins are washed away; 'for though they be as scarlet,' saith the Lord in Isaiah, 'they shall be as white as snow, though they be red like crimson, they shall be as wool.' Repentance and remission of sins makes us new creatures; we are born again; and our past, however wicked, is as though it had never belonged to us. We should not therefore feel any reluctance in going forward to any honorable post, which we can creditably fill because we have been in the service of Satan; seeing that 'there is more joy in Heaven over one sinner that repenteth, than over ninety and nine who need no repentance.' Besides, we should reflect, that some of the most abandoned sinners have been after repentance and remission of sins the most valuable and successful servants of God."</p> 
               <p>Irene, still holding the hand of Agnes in her own, now pressed it fervently, saying:</p> 
               <p>"Thanks, many thanks for your kind words; they nerve me greatly. I <emph>will</emph> learn to be a teacher. I will make amends for my past unholy career!"</p> 
               <p>"So do, so do," replied Agnes, tenderly pressing the feverish hand of the girl, "and I will be your firm friend. Until you are in a situation to make your duties of teacher support you, I will supply your necessaries-gladly, gladly supply them."</p> 
               <p>Irene, inspired by the friendship of Miss Farriday, threw herself about her neck and kissed her passionately.</p> 
               <p>"It is to you, Agnes," she said, "I owe this most happy change in my desires. Your Christian, counsel-at which I have sported in your presence, and appeared untouched<pb n="116-117" xml:id="VAC6064-00000059"/> touched by-has been with me in my hours of solitude and reflection; and has gradually brought me, by the aid of that good book, the <title>Bible,</title> to the feet of Jesus, to the realization and confession of my manifold sins and wickedness. I feel that a new life is opening to me, 'whose ways are ways of pleasantness, and whose paths are paths of peace.' You, <emph>you,</emph> dear Agnes, are my benefactress-accept my warmest love." She pressed Miss Farriday earnestly to her bosom, and the tears rolled in continuous streams down her pale sad cheeks.</p> 
               <p>They were united, these women, heart and soul! Agnes felt a keen and inexpressible joy, that the bread she had cast upon the waters, after many days had returned to her again. She had struggled hard to draw Irene from the quagmire of prostitution, by every possible means her fertile imagination could devise; and, finally, success had crowned her unyielding interest in a lovely and beautiful woman, who had fallen through idleness and pride. How her heart beat with rapture at her triumph; for she knew how well her Lord and Master loved to see return the lost sheep of his fold. She remembered his forbearance towards fallen woman, whose love for him was great, and who washed his feet with her tears, and wiped them with the hairs of her head; she remembered, too, that in his genealogy there was <hi rend="i"/>Thamar, who was by her father-in-law debauched; there was <hi rend="i"/>Rahab, a harlot; <hi rend="i"/>Ruth, a heathen woman, despised by the Jews; <hi rend="i"/>Bathsheba, the wife of Uriah, an <emph>adulteress!</emph> previous to her marriage with <hi rend="i"/>David. Thus may we see, thought Miss Farriday, how God has set forth, as it were, a looking-glass for sinners; that they may know that he would be born of the posterity of sinners; that the chief of sinners might trust in him, and flee to him for refuge. Alas! how many are there of this class of females, drifting about on life's dark and pitiless tide, for whom there is no haven but the cheerless grave, beyond which they have no hope-all is uncertainty, mystery and night! How many such would hail an Agnes Farriday as an angel of light to bless her with their holy tears. We believe there is an art in love. The only way of rightly influencing other minds, is to put ourselves in sympathy with them. We must use means for this; we must in some degree feel <emph>with</emph> them as well as <emph>for</emph> them. Their perceived or imagined state must act on our own emotions, so as to excite an appropriate expression in our features, our action, our utterance. To withdraw them from unholy passion, or disastrous pursuit, we must enter into their feelings so far as to show that we can sympathize with them in intensity of purpose, while superior to them in the direction of our wishes and the disposal of our means. We must fall into the same key, but only to utter emotion and intelligence of a higher order, guided by a will under spiritual control; thus counteracting the evil influence, not by vehement resistance, but as sunshine quenches fire, by the gentle force of a purer warmth, and light unextinguishable, because it flows from Heaven.</p> 
               <p>Those who have never been instrumental in turning the vicious from their evil ways, can but imperfectly understand the gratification which Agnes experienced, when pressed to the bosom of Irene, to be wet by her holy tears. There is a sublime bliss in thus leading the reckless, the depraved, to a knowledge of that <emph>inner life,</emph> which conducts them to the consciousness of their responsibilities as a self-existent creature, having a free will, to the Son and Father of all, for the manner in which His <emph>gift of life</emph> shall have been <emph>used.</emph> Whoever saves a soul is more of a hero than any temporal prince at whose presence a nation bows.</p> 
               <p>The two young women remained some time together in the intimacy of the most hallowed friendship. The clock had struck nine before Agnes rose to depart. They bade each other good night, and Irene again was alone. She went to her chamber, threw herself in a rocking-chair, and fell into a reverie profound. <q>

               <p>THE city was in great excitement on the day following the eventful night of Rolston's attack on Andrews, and suicide. Agnes Farriday was an obscure person, who was known to be poor and proud, and to frequent the houses where lived the women of the town; and the enemies, as well as many of the friends of Andrews, said, "he had no business with such a woman," who was not of his circle, and whom society of any pretensions knew nothing about. It was true nothing could be charged against her of a dishonest character; still, she was known as an excentric and unsocial person, and this in the opinion of many should condemn her as "an unfit associate for a young man like Andrews." The Catchpennys and the Touchmenots were delighted at our hero's misadventure; and while the Touchmenots hoped he would not survive his wounds, Mr. Catchpenny had determined to dismiss him from his employ. Both his father and mother were overwhelmed with grief, but Ida Robertson, who had professed such a strong attachment, received the intelligence of his turn of fortune with the heartless remark, "The fool, to have had so little thought of me, thus to disgrace himself. I must look me up some other love, for with all his genius I could not wed him after such conduct. Agnes Farriday, indeed! Some abandoned wretch, I doubt not." Ida's love was not equal to the test which it had encountered. She never even went to his couch to offer him the services of friendship, saying, he had no business at such a woman's house as Agnes Farriday, of whom no one knew any good, but suspected much evil.</p> 
               <p>Fortunately through the skill of the physician, and the affectionate care of Agnes, the wound that threatened the death of Andrews did not prove mortal, which was a grievous circumstance to his enemies, especially the Touchmenots, who, to use their own words, "fairly loathed the sight of him." He had been removed from the house of Miss Farriday to that of his father, where he received every attention which the love of doating parents could bestow, coupled with the warm affection of Agnes, who was ever by his side. Nothing annoyed him; not even the note from Catchpenny, who informed him that the firm had no further need of his services. He knew he had the love of Agnes; and with that he felt confident he should triumph over all his enemies, and beat down every ill.</p> 
               <p>Ida was one of those women who constitute a very large number in every community, whose love is most tender where there is a prospect of being comfortably and honorably settled in life, but who are without the least ambition for martyrdom. Andrews was a dreamy, idealistic man, who had no affinity whatever for such grossness; but craved for a bosom companion and friend in God, a soul fashioned like his own. He wanted a woman who would live for <emph>him,</emph> not for the <emph>world;</emph> who possessed the courage and magnaminity to trust <emph>all</emph> to <emph>love</emph> and <emph>Heaven.</emph> There was such a strange fascination in the manner and mind of Agnes Farriday, that he experienced a degree and kind of pleasure in contemplating her character, which never had been excited before. He felt the deep, deep emotion of a deathless love-so sweet, invigoring, elevating, and sublime. It was the consciousness that he had at length met with a being who could and would understand him; who would love and through all trials fondly cherish him, that gave him the strength to bear with perfect indifference the treatment of Messrs. Catchpenny &amp; Co. If he had lost his reputation he had gained a higher life in God, through the mild exquisite influence of a noble woman's genius and affection. What cared he for the opinion of men since he was conscious of no wrong, and had found a treasure, which has so often baffled the eager search of wealth and fame, in every age among every people.</p> 
               <p>Agnes Farriday was to William Andrews a beautiful<pb n="120-121" xml:id="VAC6064-00000061"/> reality, for which he had been looking since Nelly Penniman, the playmate of his boyhood, by her perfidy, had taught him the value of a noble, sincere, and unselfish nature. He had expected to meet with his mate, but when, where, and how, he could not divine. It was noon; the rain was pouring down in torrents, and the wind blew fearfully. William sat alone in his study which joined his bed-room, writing in his journal. The entry was as follows: "By the blessing of God I yet live to protect my beloved Agnes; she who has been so devoted to me, and of whose tender love I am so unworthy. Rolston has paid the penalty of his perfidy and ungoverned passion; and <hi rend="i"/>Ida has been tested, and proved untrue. Thank God for the revealment, so opportune." He closed his journal, and putting it aside took up a portrait of Ida which lay upon the table. He looked at it for a moment, then muttering, "Out of my sight, wanton!" he threw it on the floor and broke it into pieces with his boot-heel. "So perish!" he exclaimed, "the heartless through the world! Sweet, sweet Farriday," he continued, after a moment's pause, "thou art to this false creature as the lily to the thistle! How my soul exults in thy perfections, scorned by those superficial worldlings who cannot understand the depth of thy noble nature, nor comprehend the grandeur of thy pure affections. But unto me-to me, oh, excellent, unselfish being, thou art as sunlight! The world has said," continued Andrews, "I am ambitious; and so perhaps I am." <q>

               <p>At this moment a tall portly lady entered the room habited in a cloak, and apparently about forty-five years of age, having a handsome, striking face, deeply marked with sorrow. She advanced to Andrews and placing her hand on his light curly hair, bent her stately form and kissed him:</p> 
                
               <p>"Oh, my son," said she, "how have you fallen! Do you realize it?"</p> 
               <p>"Sit down, good mother," replied the young man tenderly, drawing a chair beside his own; "do sit down; I wish to have a long talk with you. Do I realize my misfortune? Yes, indeed; but I have only one regret-it is <emph>your sorrow,</emph> so plainly written on your countenance."</p> 
               <p>"Yes, my dear boy, I feel keenly for you. You know how great is my love. And should I not grieve when I know the community in which you were once honored, now contemn you as unworthy of trust. <emph>I</emph> know how unjust this is, but others prefer to think you a knave."</p> 
               <p>"The slanderer ever loves a shining mark," responded the son. "Be assured, good mother, I care not what the world think of me, so long as I have a clear conscience, and an equally clear head. The Touchmenots and the Pennimans,-'tis they who have undone me. But I should be as a man who understands the power of his own soul, and is continually exerting that power for the promotion of <emph>good;</emph> who cherishes a deep and solemn sense of the sacredness of duty, and never hesitates to discharge that duty, be the consequences ever so injurious to his interests; who in matters of <emph>religion</emph> lends naught save a deaf ear to the loud voice of <emph>sects,</emph> but scans the works of <emph>nature,</emph> the revelations in Scripture, the deep reasonings of the human soul, who gives all truth a welcome, how much soever it may conflict with his pride; who rebukes all <emph>evil,</emph> whose sympathies are always with the downtrod, injured, and depressed."</p> 
               <p>"How fortunate, my dear boy, had you never seen Agnes," remarked Mrs. Andrews in tears.</p> 
               <p>"Yes, yes," rejoined the son; "yet, I never was so happy as now."</p> 
               <p>"What!" exclaimed Mrs. Andrews, much agitated; "Happy!"</p> 
               <p>"Ay, good mother," replied the son; "her love and friendship is worth a world to me. Life without her would be tame and tasteless. The Catchpennys, and all other pennies may be hanged for aught I care,-with Agnes' bosom for my pillow."</p> 
               <pb n="122-123" xml:id="VAC6064-00000062"/> 
               <p>"How strange you talk," rejoined Mrs. Andrews; "I am amazed, provoked with you for thus trifling with my feelings. You but jest."</p> 
               <p>"Indeed, I was never more in earnest in all my life," returned the young man. "I love Agnes with a devotion, such a soul can alone inspire,-she is the very being I have looked for in the <emph>ideal,</emph> never supposing I should meet with the <emph>reality.</emph> I have been truly wretched, but she, oh, she has made me so happy, so happy!"</p> 
               <p>"You are certainly demented, mad, my dear son," returned Mrs. Andrews, much agitated. "Agnes can never purge herself of suspicion. Cease to think of her for my sake."</p> 
               <p>"Not think of Agnes, my dearest mother?" exclaimed the son, bending forward in his chair. "Impossible! you might as well ask me to forget my God."</p> 
               <p>"You are lost entirely if you do not avoid that woman," rejoined Mrs. Andrews, with tearful eyes. "Oh, my son, how you have disappointed me."</p> 
               <p>"Don't weep, dear mother," returned he affectionately; "I beg of you do not weep,-I'm so pained by your tears. I did not seek Agnes, she came to me. And, oh, if such a sweet creature can mislead man, then the world has no loveliness and beauty that is not poison. Believe me she is a good spirit, and Heaven has sent her to me for a noble end."</p> 
               <p>"Why will you be so imaginative," rejoined Mrs. Andrews; "it is this force which seems to have obtained such mastery over your reason, as really alarms me. One may <emph>imagine</emph> anything, but how important to be <emph>rational.</emph>"</p> 
               <p>"I see, I see," returned the son, nervously. "You think I am too romantic. Ah, dear mother, would you knew your son."</p> 
               <p>"And do I not?" interrogated Mrs. Andrews with surprise.</p> 
               <p>"Of my <emph>inner life,</emph> my longings, my spirituality, I am sure you know very little," replied the young man. "You have never appeared thoroughly to understand my desires-my ambition."</p> 
               <p>"No? then 'tis because you have never sought to acquaint me;" rejoined the mother, looking steadfastly at her son.</p> 
                
               <p>"I never seek to acquaint any one with my interior life." returned our hero, in a low solemn tone. "Where I perceive, however, the desire on the part of any congenial mind to know me, I reveal myself. You think me strange, but have never tried to understand why it is I am so."</p> 
               <p>"I have not aimed to pry into your thoughts, 'tis true," replied Mrs. Andrews, "because I was unwilling to desire what your love for me was not deep enough to offer."</p> 
               <p>"Ah, dear mother," returned the son, pressing her hand, which he still retained in his, "you mistake my love to doubt its strength. I know that I love you truly, I know there is none upon this earth in whose fidelity and sincerity I can place more implicit faith than in yours. Still, you do not comprehend me. O, would you did. A true artist, dear mother, whose soul is constantly fixed on sublime themes, cannot be what material men of active life term <emph>practical,</emph> which is what you would have me to be." He paused for a moment, then continued. "True artists are God's especial ministers in the interpretation of <emph>nature,</emph> and will ever appear strange to those who do not comprehend them, and understand their mission. My mind, dear mother, is a world of thought, the least beauty of which is worth more to me than 'golden opinions' from <emph>all sorts of people.</emph>"</p> 
               <p>"I am most unhappy to know you love so truly a woman, who, after all, is but an adventuress! She may or may not be worthy of you," rejoined Mrs. Andrews.</p> 
               <p>"Is she not a lady?" interrogated the son somewhat sharply. "Have you not found her, in her intercourse with you, during the time she was under your roof in attendance on me, a woman of brilliant mind and powerful character? Did you not feel her to be in every sense your equal?"</p> 
               <p>"My dear boy, I have no fault to find with Agnes more than this," rejoined Mrs. Andrews; "she is mysterious, and may or may not be all she seems. But I'll say no more. If she is the only woman you can love, do that which is for your happiness."</p> 
               <p>Mrs. Andrews kissed her son's pale brow, and then withdrew.</p> 
               <p>William sat for some time motionless in his chair and<pb n="124-125" xml:id="VAC6064-00000063"/> then suddenly starting up, muttered: "That voice again! Ah, it tells me ever to be true to Agnes, and so by my soul, I will obey its just commands. "The young man believed in the power of spirits to impress his mind; and this voice he so often heard, he thought to be his guardian angel's. Undoubtedly spirits do communicate with mortals, and have done so in every age of the world. The Bible is full of spiritualism from beginning to end. Most ancient history reveals the fact that angels came to the inhabitants of this planet on errands of love and mercy. Traditions existing in the Roman Catholic Church-also traditions of Indians, who received visions of their beautiful spirit-land, with crystal streams meandering among the hills and leaping o'er the crimson onyx stone; towering forests filled with warriors brave, and orators sublime in their eloquence; beautiful beasts, and birds with celestial voices singing around bowers of love,-these with more modern facts, present a glimpse of that chain whose links of Scriptural influences connects past generations to the present, and elevate all in the great scale of progression. Numerous are the facts of past ages evincing the influence of unseen spirits. No true poet ever wrote who did not confess a high and holy inspiration poured into his soul from an influence far above the material world.</p> 
               <p>Of what especial benefit, however, this present indiscriminate consultation of the dead can be to humanity, is to our comprehension not so clear. It is as much calculated to mislead as to direct aright; and in very many cases we should say, its evils may be incalculable. If mankind are willing to submit themselves to the doctrines of Christianity, to believe in the Scriptural plan of salvation, to reverence and love Christ,-that was the word with God before the world was,-we can see no reason why they should seek or desire intercourse with the departed, whom they cannot be certain are their friends, however conclusive, apparently, may be the evidence; for as to the means of deception which these intelligences may make use of, we are and must ever remain entirely ignorant. We think when persons come calmly to consider of spiritual intercouse, to reflect on the absurdity of giving themselves up to the guidance of unknown powers, they will return to the quiet habits of mind, which an humble trust in the divine promises of Jesus insure to the faithful. In this life, while in this material and troublesome body, we are shut off from the spirit world, and any attempt on our part to commune with its intelligences, and to know of the hereafter, more than we may learn by an earnest, close study of the Scripture, is altogether idle and dangerous to our peace of mind. It is enough for us to know, if we perform our duties faithfully in this life, as sincere Christian men and women, that with the Father in Heaven, we shall enjoy a condition which will be happiness. In seeking communion with departed friends, there is an irresistible impulse hard to overcome; but, when it is remembered, the gratification of this desire can result in no positive assurance, that it is indeed with our friends that we have held communion; when it is realized that the grossest deceptions may be practised upon us, by those mysterious agents; when it is dispassionately considered that our minds may be enfeebled and even deranged by such exciting causes, we are of opinion that most of us, acting as rational creatures, will refrain from seeking knowledge, or consolation, or love, through such irresponsible and unknown sources.</p> 
               <p>It is true that in this life there is so much materiality, so much in the practical concerns of society in direct opposition to, and, we may say, at war with our better natures, which the poetic sentiment embraces, so much to disgust and dishearten us in the discharge of the gross duties of the world, we feel it to be a great privilege to be able to call up the spirits of friends whom we have loved, to enjoy again their society. We fancy a purity attaching itself to them which may be communicated to us, and thus it is that very many turn to spiritualism as a refuge from the grossness and moral deformity of earthly cares, aims, and customs. But it is much better for us all to stand our ground, and face sin with a bold front, bearing up under its calamity as soldiers of the <emph>cross,</emph> seeking spiritual aid and comfort from God above, whose tangible form is in Jesus!</p> 
               <p>There is all the spiritual support in the Bible which any man or woman really needs. "Be thou faithful unto<pb n="126-127" xml:id="VAC6064-00000064"/> the end, and I will give thee a crown of glory," are words that should be written on the heart of every human being who lacks firmness in his hopes of a hereafter. It seems to us, that so long as we are in this world, we should be engaged in the affairs of the world, suppressing as much as possible our curiosity as to the next; we should endeavor to be faithful unto the end of this life, knowing that we shall be glorified in the next. Now, being faithful is to live in accordance with the divine will as expressed in the Bible, which is to love our neighbors as ourselves, and to do unto others as we would that they should do unto us. We have only to obey this will, and the necessity we feel for the spiritual aid from immortal intelligences will not longer exist; we shall find in our fellow men a friendship and esteem, a love even, as soothing and sustaining as that is found to be of "ministering angels." Instead of striving while we are in the body for communion with the unseen and unknown powers, let us do what we can through the doctrine and spirit of Jesus, which is not unknown! to improve the minds and hearts of men by practising His virtues and explaining his doctrine.</p> 
               <p>We have work enough to do, all of us, both old and young, to evangelize the world. If departed spirits insist on aiding us in this labor, it would be ungenerous and selfish to disregard them; but at the same time, we do not hesitate to affirm, that the <title>Bible</title> is all powerful for this object; and mankind are fully competent under its influence, of spiritualizing themselves without the assistance of unseen forces, of whom we know nothing <emph>accurately.</emph>
               </p> 
               <p>William Andrews was one of those highly imaginative and excitable beings, who delighted to feel himself in the care of departed spirits; he felt a peculiar charm in their society, a pride in believing himself chosen by them in consequence of the purity of his aspirations, which were those of a refined genius. He was ambitious to do something that would mark him as a man of <emph>thought and power;</emph> but what that something should be he had not yet determined. At one time he concluded to go upon the stage; then he thought he would be a dramatic author; he fancied he was quite equal to writing the best plays, and that in this way he might greatly benefit his fellow men, by combining in his productions, instructions as well as amusements. Yes, he would certainly be an author; but when he came calmly to consider of the miseries of dramatic authorship, when he remembered the peculiarities of actors, who most always contrive to dodge, or embarrass new pieces they are called to perform; when he reflected upon the envy, malice, the hatred which small critics, (who have never been able to do anything praise-worthy for the stage,) entertain towards successful authorship, he abandoned the ambition at once, and laughed at himself for aspiring to fame through the medium of the stage. It appeared to him, in a cool dispassionate state of mind, supremely absurd to look to such a thorny path for happiness. Yet something he must be above the ordinary masses, as he felt the power within him, and <emph>out</emph> it should come. He would be a poet-painter. He was sure in this field of a triumph which would satisfy him. Sometimes the wish was uppermost to return to mercantile life; as, however, he would come under such disadvantages in consequence of his dismissal from Messrs. Catchpenny &amp; Co.'s, he decided not to re-enter that field. He would identify himself with the domain of art; with <emph>art</emph> and Agnes he deemed he could be happy. Money was no particular consideration with him, nor with Agnes. They did not desire to live in <emph>style;</emph> but simply comfortable. To be a poet-painter, and to wear the laurels of an art hero, was to be the future ambition of his life.</p> 
               <p>Having drawn himself close to the table whereon were his books and writing materials, he dropped his head upon his bosom, and sat in deep thought. Suddenly starting up, he began to walk the room with his hands in his pantaloon pockets, whilst tears trickled from his cheeks. He paced the room many times, occasionally drawing a long, deep sigh, followed by a convulsive movement of the body. Now and then he would mutter:</p> 
               <p>"Oh, if she will be but true to me, what may I not accomplish, with hope, patience, and perseverance; but, oh, if she should prove false-let me not think on't. No, no, I do but wrong her-sweet, sweet creature!" The young man was greatly agitated; he seemed convulsed<pb n="128-129" xml:id="VAC6064-00000065"/> in every limb. It was the working of a soul on fire in contemplation of its destiny. He was overcharged as it were, with thought of Agnes, the centre of his life, the pillar of his strength, the substance of his happiness. Thus engaged we now leave him to advert to other scenes.</p>

               <p>THE Atlays were the only family to whom young Andrews was personally known, who took any apparent interest in his welfare. Both Charles Atlay and his father were particularly kind, and offered to do anything in their power to befriend him. Lucy, touched deeply by the injustice of the Catchpennys, sent the aggrieved young man the following lines from "Legends of the Isles": <q>
                     <lg type="quotation"> 
                        <l>"If thou would'st win a lasting fame,</l> 
                        <l>If thou the immortal wreath would claim,</l> 
                        <l>And make the future bless thy name,</l> 
                        <l>Begin thy perilous career;</l> 
                        <l>Keep high thy heart, thy conscience clear,</l> 
                        <l>And walk thy way without a fear."</l> 
                     </lg>
                  </q>
               </p> 
               <p>These lines were very appropriate, and were most gratefully received. Lucy had always had a high regard for young Andrews, and was suspected by her family of being partially, if not deeply in love with him. So at all events the Misses Catchpennys thought and even reported. These people affected to regard the Atlays with contempt, whom "<emph>they</emph> would not visit on any account." Our hero was abused by all the Penniman set, as persistently as he was praised by the Atlays.</p> 
               <p>He had a sad experience of the passion which prompts calumny, but bore with the greatest patience the affliction it had brought upon him. He had endeared himself to Lucy by his gracious manners and his genial wit; both she and her family discredited entirely the charges against him, and were confident he had been foully wronged. One day as she sat alone in her chamber, her mother suddenly entered, and observing her daughter pale, dejected,<pb n="130-131" xml:id="VAC6064-00000066"/> and wiping a tear from her cheek, she affectionately pressed her hand and inquired the cause of her sorrow.</p> 
               <p>"I am so sad to think," said Lucy, "that one so good, so noble, so much above his fellows as William Andrews, should meet with such injustice, such inhumanity from those he so long and faithfully served."</p> 
               <p>"Well, my dear, what else can we expect from the Catchpennys and their set;" returned Mrs. Atlay. "You know from such low people nothing high minded can be expected."</p> 
               <p>"Very true," rejoined Lucy, "very true; I am surprised that he should have gone to service with <emph>them.</emph>"</p> 
               <p>"Oh, but you don't understand, my dear, about this," replied Mrs. Atlay, hurriedly. "When young men are in want of situations, and can't afford to be particular, they have to accept of such as may offer, without much regard as to who and what their employers are, whether Jew or Gentile, Infidel or Christian. So wags the world, my dear-so wags the world."</p> 
               <p>"A sad world it is," rejoined Lucy, drawing a low sigh.</p> 
               <p>"Do not be so sad," returned the mother. "I fear your thoughts are too much of Andrews. He is not a man to marry a girl simply because she is interested in him; no, no."</p> 
               <p>"Not until of late have I found myself seriously engaged with thoughts of him," returned Lucy; "since all the world seemed against him I have deeply pitied his lot, and may add, loved the rare virtue of his manhood."</p> 
               <p>"You appear to think he is unloved, uncared for," rejoined Mrs. Atlay. "Now, my dear Lucy, this is a great mistake. Agnes Farriday, so report goes, is his bosom friend, whom he loves devotedly, and intends to marry."</p> 
               <p>"Marry!" interrupted Lucy; "no, no, that cannot be; he-he, would not marry her! The report cannot be true; I'll not believe one word of it." She spoke with a good deal of warmth, and for the moment seemed alive with indignation.</p> 
               <p>"The report originated with the Catchpennys," replied Mrs. Atlay; "they ought to know."</p> 
                
               <p>"They!" ejaculated Lucy. "The Catchpennys? Why, they are his <emph>bitter</emph> foes; now, I am sure 'tis false."</p> 
               <p>"Don't be too certain; we are all liable to mistakes," rejoined Mrs. Atlay.</p> 
               <p>"We shall see," replied Lucy, distrustfully. "We shall see. Time will reveal all things, and I predict in this instance I shall be proved right."</p> 
               <p>The tea-bell at this moment rang sharply, when Lucy and her mother, affectionately locked in each other's arms, proceeded down stairs to join Mr. Atlay and Charles at supper.</p> 
               <p>Lucy was at that period in the life of every true woman, when moral and intellectual growth seems for the time to cease.</p> 
               <p>The vacant heart seeks for an occupant, a more intimate companionship with the masculine mind, to start it upon its second period of development. At this period Lucy has arrived. She craved the society and love of one in whom she could place entire confidence. In Andrews she believed was such a man. She could not calmly bear the reflection, that he might marry another. He had often conversed with her; he had often laughed and walked with this lovely lady, whose soft blue eyes were speaking pictures of innocent dreams, whose lips and cheeks were redolent with beauty.</p> 
               <p>As she sat at the tea-table, with her father, mother and brother Charles, she accidently brushed from the table a china dish, which broke into many pieces. Stooping down she picked up a fragment, and looking earnestly at her father, said:</p> 
               <p>"Oh, father, you have indeed a careless daughter, who fears, in time, even as this dish, she will be a fragment only of herself."</p> 
               <p>"Nonsense, daughter, nonsense," returned Mr. Atlay. "You've only to take in about a yard of those flowing sleeves, and you'll last to a good old age. Let poetry alone or you will go mad. I tell you, love, you read too much of matter which has no practical bearing on life; and if you continue in this course you will bring upon yourself much unhappiness, Do you not remember how poor Chatterton, in the height of his misery, and on<pb n="132-133" xml:id="VAC6064-00000067"/> the eve of his sad death, wrote to a friend, in which letter he 'damned the muses,' and declared them to be the nurse of poverty and insanity. He certainly is good authority.'</p> 
               <p>"That unfortunate youth," returned Lucy, "had refference to the <emph>writing</emph> of poetry, and not the reading or study of it."</p> 
               <p>"It is all the same thing my love," exclaimed Mr. Atlay. "It is deadly poison, and whether one is engaged in its manufacture or use, their fate is the same. I appeal to your mother and brother to sustain me."</p> 
               <p>"I have no hesitation in declaring it as my opinion that no true poet, nor <emph>enthusiastic reader of poetry,</emph> is a sane person," said Charles, as he passed his cup to be replenished with tea.</p> 
               <p>"That is precisely what I think," remarked Mrs. Atlay; "and I have always regretted that Lucy passed so much time with these imaginative authors."</p> 
               <p>"There, you see, Lucy, the majority is against you," spoke Mr. Atlay, with the utmost good nature.</p> 
               <p>"Ay, sir," replied the daughter; "but you know majorities are not always <emph>just.</emph> I love the poets because they carry me into the pure and exalted realms of fancy. I know that while here, I am dead, as it were, to the world of sense. Yet is it not, dear father, well, sometimes, to escape from earth and bask for a while in the light of Heaven-this light is <emph>true</emph> poetry!"</p> 
               <p>"My dear girl," rejoined Mr. Atlay, "you are an enthusiast in this fascinating art-you have been charmed by it into a state of mind, against which I solemnly caution you. Fly these weird authors; mix fully with cheerful society; and in time you will re-acquire a relish for the dance, hot suppers, and all et ceteras, of what is termed 'high life.' Don't continue to be a blue, I beg of you. I should be so happy to see you once more as you were just after leaving school-sprightly and gay. Now, dear, can you not gratify me?"</p> 
               <p>"Why, my dear father, how unreasonable you are," returned Lucy. "You might as well ask the leopard to change his spots, as to ask me to re-enter the saloons of fashion. I left them in disgust and forever! Do not think I will consent to return! Ask of me anything else, and though it were to die for you, I would freely respond, my dearest father- <q>

               </p> 
               <p>This was an apt and very beautiful quotation, which at once silenced Mr. Atlay. In all their disputations with Lucy, she usually succeeded in maintaining her positions, as she did on this present occasion. Never violent, she was always firm and dignified, so that neither her parents, nor brother, ever had cause to complain of a wound.</p> 
               <p>"By the way, my love, I saw your friend, Hamilton, to-day," remarked Mr. Atlay, to his fair and accomplished daughter; "he and Andrews seem inseparable."</p> 
               <p>"I know not why it is, but of late Augustus has somewhat avoided me," rejoined Lucy. "Think how long it is since his last visit. He is one of the most agreeable of fellows, and writes the most exquisite sonnets. Petrarch's are no better."</p> 
               <p>"Fudge," exclaimed Charles, "he's a mere lady's plaything-a handsome beau. Such fellows are entirely incompetent as husbands."</p> 
               <p>"Excellent! my dear fellow," exclaimed Mr. Atlay; "You speak the truth. These milk-sops who are about in society, with little or no real worth, elbowing their betters, and with the most insufferable airs, should be put in petticoats and made to do the work of house-maids, being totally unfit for the employment of men!"</p> 
               <p>"But Augustus Hamilton, my dear father, is no such person," replied Lucy.</p> 
               <p>"Take my advice," spoke the brother, "'and give him a wide birth,' as the sailors say. He writes poetry, and that is enough to condemn any man; for it is generally believed that such fellows are never up to their work unless drunk-inspiration comes only with their cups. As for Andrews, he is about half deranged. I never saw a<pb n="134-135" xml:id="VAC6064-00000068"/> person of such a changeable mood. At times I meet him and he is full of good nature, quite communicative; at other times, taciturn and morose."</p> 
               <p>"Morose!" exclaimed Lucy; "William Andrews-morose? No, no, it is not in his nature. Would you were something of an artist, Charles. You would not then call the melancholy of Andrews moroseness; he is a thinker, a deep one, too!"</p> 
               <p>"This deep thinking," said Mrs. Atlay, sarcastically, "may account for his religious views-and those of Hamilton. You certainly cannot excuse their skepticism. How often have we heard both of these young men defend Theodore Parker's doctrine; and while denouncing him as an abolitionist, applauding him as a deist! This Mr. Parker I regard as one of the most dangerous teachers we have ever had in our midst, because, while he rejects the Bible as a standard of faith and the means of salvation, he goes to its moral precepts to form the text and the garnishing of his performances; thereby stealing 'the livery of Heaven to serve the devil in.' Nothing can be more narrow and diabolical than his doctrine. 'Emancipation from the Bible and the church,' is his battle cry; 'down with the eclesiastical authority,' says he; 'let men be set loose from the old theological den.' Love of <emph>self</emph> is his grand central point; and as evidence of it, he preaches not love in general, but only hatred of what is not in conformity with his own notions of social and individual requirement."</p> 
               <p>"You misunderstand this man;" returned Lucy, resolutely.</p> 
               <p>"Why, my dear, I am astonished that you should defend Mr. Parker. Nothing can be plainer than the statement of his doctrine. He is an unqualified disbeliever in all revealed religion. Nature and reason is his Bible-his only guide!" replied Mrs. Atlay.</p> 
               <p>"I tell you again, Theodore Parker is not understood <emph>fully,</emph>" rejoined Lucy, with much earnestness. "That he does not believe in the Scriptural plan of salvation, I allow. He thinks this whole scheme the work of priestcraft, and not the plan of God. He thinks, too, that man may be his own Saviour, by the study and practice of virtue tue. The doctrine he teaches is the doctrine he lives out! Both Andrews and Hamilton regard Mr. Parker as a man of profound genius, and they are pleased to hear him teach. They do not, however, sympathize with all his views, nor with his total rejection of the Bible as the revealed word of God. They are <emph>eclectics,</emph> and believe good may be gathered from all shades of religion. Both of these young men I know to be <emph>honest</emph> Christians."</p> 
               <p>"Honest!" reiterated Charles. "Well, it is refreshing to hear any one speak of <emph>honest</emph> Christians; it is, indeed."</p> 
               <p>"Why, Charles!" exclaimed Mrs. Atlay. "Lucy, let us not dispute this point any more-we shall never agree, I fear. Tell me why it is, Hamilton has so neglected you of late. He has always been so regular in his visits."</p> 
               <p>"He is queer," responded the daughter; "and pray, did you ever see a man of parts who was otherwise? The truth is, where there are any intellectual endowments, there is always a good deal of singularity. Think what a strange being Shakspeare has made of Hamlet. This character undoubtedly was the most profound creation of that wonderful poet's teeming fancy."</p> 
               <p>"No, no!" exclaimed Charles. "Macbeth, Macbeth!"</p> 
               <p>"Why, brother!" remarked Lucy, with astonishment. "How coarse your taste!"</p> 
               <p>"Why he should have failed as an actor, I cannot understand;" spoke Mrs. Atlay, as she helped herself to a piece of cake.</p> 
               <p>"'Tis evident," said Charles, "he had no taste for the sock and buskin, whereas he had a powerful genius for authorship, but with all his genius, there were few plays he wrote which exceed the scope of other men of his time."</p> 
               <p>"He was too great a poet for action," said Lucy. "His strength was without the world of reality, and he attained his lofty elevation only because he did not employ his powers in bearing the burdens of earth."</p> 
               <p>"In what particular, my dear, do you conceive Shakspeare to have surpassed other play-writers?" interrogated Mr. Atlay.</p> 
               <p>"Undoubtedly, by his power of the most accurate observation," responded Lucy, "coupled with the profoundest<pb n="136-137" xml:id="VAC6064-00000069"/> foundest ability. Superior to all by his reason, he was accessible to all by sympathy. Who has sketched human nature as he? Is it not strange that the drama, encouraged in its early rise in Greece, as it was, by the noblest intellects, and in all subsequent time, numbering among its supporters the most gifted of mankind, should meet with so much opposition from the clergy, when this very class of men in the Middle Ages, made use of the stage for the mysteries and moralities, by which the people were instructed in the leading facts of sacred history?"</p> 
               <p>"If they could control it now, as then," said Charles, "they would cry up, instead of crying down, dramatic genius."</p> 
               <p>"They will never again, I apprehend, possess that power, and they never should," returned Lucy. "The drama is founded in mankind's love of the beautiful and true; it must not be cramped by mere religionists-by fanatical priests! It must be free! It expresses fully the <emph>ideal</emph> of man! His wide sweeping love of the beautiful and true, which is the very basis of all religion, and cannot be destroyed, for it is eternal! Since, then, the drama cannot be silenced, but with the destruction of the human soul, it should be made as ennobling as possible, by receiving the support of the most cultivated minds. Make the drama a purely classic power, and all connected with it become elevated and noble; but very many people cannot comprehend the true mission of the stage and art, in general. Talk of making <emph>art</emph> respectable, and they smile incredulously; denounce the proposition an <emph>absurdity.</emph> They seem to entertain the idea that God has created the poet, the painter, the sculptor, as tools for the devil's use, rather than His own glory. When will such absurd notions give place to more just conceptions of the subject?"</p> 
               <p>"Not until the love of art shall have gained a <emph>complete hold</emph> of our people," said Mrs. Atlay. "Then will the artist be loved and honored."</p> 
               <p>We do not deem it necessary to detain the reader longer with the Atlays. It was a model family, of which there are many in "Modern Athens." Blessed with a competence, and warm hearted, talented children, Mr. and Mrs. Atlay were the personification of a "happy couple." "Sure of their position," they envied not the position of others, and while courteous to all, toadied to none. Mrs. Atlay was a woman of fine presence, and had been thoroughly educated. She treated with perfect indifference the pretensions of the Pennimans, the Touchmenots, the Catchpennys, and their pompous sets, which she termed "Bostonians at large," as they were everywhere that <emph>money</emph> could carry them; now in Europe, then at home; then in the South, East, North and West, by turns. Mrs. Atlay was facetious, but never vulgar; there was always the Attic salt to all her humor, even when pressed by the most active passion. She had the greatest possible aversion to busybodies, lying, gad-abouts, who, unqualified for any useful pursuit, and quite incapable of attending to their own affairs, undertake to arrange and to <emph>manage</emph> the affairs of others.</p> 
               <p>The Atlays had been so beset by such plagues, that their patience, fortitude, and forbearance had been sorely tried; but believing with Antisthenes the cynic, an adherent of the doctrine of Socrates, that the greatest good was the avoidance of evil, they kept out of the way of mischief-makers as much as possible; who are cowardly, reckless, unscrupulous, and the embodiment of that active principle of the human soul, vulgarly called the Devil; carrying strife and ruin wherever they go; sundering friendships, corrupting love, poisoning the spring of domestic happiness; rooting out all confidence between husband and wife; arraying children against their parents; darkening even the sun with the foul exhalations from their corrupt, plutonian bodies; confusing the good order of society; arraying man against his God; bringing religion into contempt; plucking up the roses and planting thorns; nursing hate wherever it may be hatched, with tenderest care and solicitude; exulting over the tribulation of the good; making merry where there is a heavy fall from influence and power; and, finally, doing all and everything but the commandments of God. Such, my readers, you will find as a rule the detestable character of the <foreign xml:lang="LAT">quid-nunc,</foreign> or busybody. Shun these wretches as you would the plague.</p>

               <p>THE Pennimans had just received letters from their daughter, Mrs McAlpin, who was at Rome. This young couple had spent some time in England and France, enjoying the hospitality of those to whom they had letters of introduction. They were now in Italy, dear Italy, the land of Poets, Painters, and Scholars, to which so many perform a pilgrimage, who are familiar with the glorious past. Young McAlpin, in a measure, was qualified to understand and appreciate the classic renown of Italia; he had read the most approved authors, with more or less pleasure; but his mind was shallow, and consequently there could be but little depth to his acquirements. He was like many other young men who go abroad for travel, much better off at home; and for the reason, that travel, instead of improving, <emph>spoils</emph> them, engendering a self-conceit and self-sufficiency, rendering them extremely ridiculous. Nelly's letters were very amusing; Mrs. Penniman thought them <emph>model</emph> ones, and read them to all her friends. Mrs. Penniman said, that whatever pleased <emph>her,</emph> must likewise be acceptable to all others; she never stopped to say, "by your leave," but took it for granted that "the King can do no wrong." Here are the letters.</p>

                           <p>MY DEAR MAMMA:-Well, here we are at last in the eternal city; both James and myself. My last was at Venice, and the one before the last, was at <emph>Genoa.</emph> As from <emph>you,</emph> I've nothing since I left, with dear James, la belle France!! Oh, what a country France is; my heavens! who would be an American, with a Europe on the Globe. Paris, my goodness, what a city!! We had a jolly time in Paris, I tell you; but dear James troubled me a good deal; he <emph>will</emph> drink, notwithstanding all I say to him; and once or twice he has come home to our pleasant apartments on the Ru Honor, very drunk, indeed!!! I do the best I can for him; bathe his head in cold water, perfumed with <emph>violet,</emph> and give him an emetic; in the morning, 'hock and soda water,' which he likes, because <emph>Byronic.</emph> I tell you what, Mamma, I have got 'a mighty hard case,' for a husband, thanks to <emph>your</emph> management!!! I think, with all due deference to your opinion, that this idea of marrying into 'blooded families,' aint what it's cracked up to be; and although I made a lucky escape from Andrews, being now disgraced, <emph>hopelessly,</emph> as you write me, still, I am afraid I married in too much of a hurry, and what is a great pity, I am 'in a family way,' and expect to be confined in the Holy Land, somewhere near Jerusalem. I hope, of course, for a boy, and a prodigy. I pray that he may be a genius, for I <emph>do</emph> want a <emph>genius</emph> so much. Is there not something charming even in the <emph>word</emph> itself. But, you don't know how I fear the child will inherit his father's love of <emph>rum</emph>-his unfortunate thirst, which God forbid! We received a great deal of attention whilst at <emph>Paris</emph> from the Fairlillies and Dashmedowns of New Orleans, and the Bagpipes of <emph>Boston.</emph> You know the family are mere <emph>upstarts;</emph> but, as they were kind to <emph>us,</emph> you must do what you can for <emph>them,</emph> at home-advance them in society <emph>all they will bear.</emph> They are <emph>very</emph> ambitious, and <emph>pushing!</emph> Of the Greenbriars, I must say a word. <emph>Mr.</emph> Greenbriar looks like a <emph>monkey.</emph> You know his wife; she is from Boston. It is amusing to note their <emph>airs.</emph> They are laughed at a good deal, and called 'Northern folks with Southern principles,' and brilliant snobs! Most everybody from the States gets more or less fun poked at them, by the wits. These wits are a nuisance. You never saw such a place for gossip. People have nothing else to do but talk scandal, and go about sight seeing, to eat frogs and 'get tight.' Just think of it, dear mother,-I ate frogs' legs for breakfast! and have imagined ever since, that they were trying to kick my sides out; but this is a notion, I am informed, peculiar<pb n="140-141" xml:id="VAC6064-00000071"/> to my <emph>delicate situation.</emph> Oh, mother, how I wish you was with us; how you would have enjoyed our passage of the Alps! and descent into the fertile plains of Lombardy. James was so much 'carried away' by a classic furor at realizing himself to be on the 'battle ground of centuries,' that for some time I was fearful he would have fits; for he had a bottle of champagne under his ribs, which was fuel to the 'hot fire of his fancy.' It is with the greatest difficulty that I manage to keep him 'out of quarrels,' with those towards whom he conceives a dislike. He is so pugnacious, and fearless-he says, <emph>it's in his family;</emph> that his father and <emph>all his line!</emph> were fighting men; but I sincerely hope he'll not 'get into any row,' and make a widow of me; although my chance would be <emph>first-rate</emph> for another husband, almost anywhere in Europe. (This portion of the letter Mrs. Penniman, like a prudent woman, was careful to skip.) 'Rome that sits on her seven hills, and from her throne of beauty rules the world,' is a great city, truly; and St. Peter's! Oh, St. Peter's! Angelo's master-work, which is the Pantheon raised in Air! just think of it! what a genius he was! It is so grand! that to see <emph>it</emph> alone, is worth <emph>a trip to Europe.</emph> James has just stepped up to my elbow with Childe Harold's Pilgrimage open at Canto 48th, and I cannot resist the temptation to quote some lines on Italy, which are so justly esteemed beautiful:- <q>

                           <p>Oh, you ought to see Santa Croce, where Angelo, Alfieri, and Galileo, who so alarmed the priestcraft with his theory of the heavens, all lay entombed together, with great Machiavelli, as he is called by the enthusiastic Italians. Here is a squad of great men about as intimately associated as persons ever get to be. You do not know how perfectly furious husband was, to think that the remains mains of Dante, Petrarch, and Boccaccio were not in company with this most illustrious dust! He raved like a madman, and said the Italians were a set of scoundrels, to tolerate this neglect. I am sorry to say, however, James is always passionate over classic memories when anything strikes him as wrong, particularly when he is 'tight!'</p> 
                           <p>At Argua we saw the tomb of Petrarch, whose love for Laura is so much a matter of admiration, and deemed so beautiful; but to my mind Petrarch was not so much in love, after all. The fact is, I don't believe such men, who are forever with a pen in their hand, know anything about <emph>real, genuine love.</emph> It is true, they write of it very well; but that's their business, in which they ought to be perfect. Ferrara! My gracious, you ought to see Ferrara; it was here that Tasso was confined by that scapegrace Alfonso. And Ravenna, too, this is a place worth seeing, famous for the tomb of Dante. At Pansillipo we stood by the tomb of Virgil. You never saw a fellow so carried away as was James, whilst at this classic spot; he swelled with all the emotions of a scholar. It is a most romantic place, and many are the laurel-wreaths that pilgrim hands, from every clime, have strewed o'er the hallowed shrine of Mantua's bard. Some worthless people have despoiled the urn of its ashes. It rests in a rude building sheltered by a rough rock, covered with mosses.</p> 
                           <p>At Venice we stood upon the Bridge of Sighs, with the ducal palace at one end, and dungeons at the other. Many a poor creature has passed from one to the other, forsaken and broken-hearted, to <emph>death.</emph> This Bridge of Sighs is a covered gallery, some distance above the water. The prisoners were kept in places called "pozzi," wells sunk in the thick walls of the palace, from whence they were taken, and led across the gallery to the other side, and strangled!! Just think of that, dear mother, what brutality! But it's just what one might expect from Italians; they look, one and all, like a set of cut-throats.</p> 
                           <p>All through Italy each district has its hero. As to cascades, my gracious! what can equal the "Cascarta del Marmoro," of Terni. Switzerland, with all its torrents, is nothing to this. The Carpo de Bove! I wish you<pb n="142-143" xml:id="VAC6064-00000072"/> could see the Carpo de Bove; 'tis in the Appian Way, and is the tomb of <hi rend="i"/>Cecilia Metella, the wife of one of the wealthiest of Romans-'tis magnificent! there is nothing like it at home. Trajan's Column, one of the best of Roman princes, is a noble shaft; 'tis surmounted by St. Peter; the column to Aurelius, by St. Paul. The Pantheon is a fine structure; we spent some time here thinking over its renown. The Latian Jupiter, on Alban Hill, has been succeeded by a Convent!! James says, this is shameful. The view from the top is grand, embracing the Mediterranean. We spent a very pleasant hour here.</p> 
                           <p>We have had a fine time in Italy, especially in Rome. I am, however, disgusted with the Italians, degenerate Romans are they, indeed, else would they throw off the bondage of foreign rule. So James declares, who swears if he was an Italian, he would give the country no rest until it was either free, or hopelessly enslaved. There are some few Bostonians here; nobody, however, that <emph>we</emph> care to be <emph>intimate</emph> with; they are not persons of <emph>our</emph> rank. There are many New Yorkers here, and some <emph>Southerners,</emph> whom we much prefer to these "<emph>Boston nobodies.</emph>"</p> 
                           <p>I am making this a very long letter, but the truth is, I have a great deal to say. I will write soon again; adieu. James sends his love. You don't know how sorry I am that he takes so much to brandy; but one thing is to his praise, he will drink nothing but the <emph>best.</emph> He sends his love. We are rather short of funds, and hope in a day or so to receive remittances.</p>

               <p>We will not detain the reader by giving any more of the correspondence of Mrs. McAlpin. Mrs. Penniman had received several letters from her daughter, since her departure,-one from London, and two or three from France; but none of them, as a whole, were more worthy to be laid before the reader, than this one from Rome, which we have presented. They were all, however, read by Mrs. Penniman to her friends, with an equal degree of satisfaction. Indeed, she thought them quite worthy to be classed with the Correspondence of <hi rend="i"/>Lady Montagu; the letter from Rome she said was "the highest point of excellence." "Her daughter," was ever on her lips; she was so beautiful, so accomplished, so well formed, had such a pretty foot, such a sparkling eye, such a lofty spirit, so sweet a voice, so happy a wit, so charming a smile, and such a genteel laugh-in fact was so perfect at all points, that the modest and virtuous mother would often say to herself, "well, I declare, I never thought Mr. P. and I would be so favored." Of course such an idea, "so shocking," (as she would say-to hear it spoken,) never passed her lips; nor did many other beautiful samples of her lucubrations ever find their way to the light of day. She was a person who thought not only twice, but four times twice, before she spoke, and whenever she did speak, she gave mankind to understand-'<emph>twas Mrs. Penniman.</emph>
               </p> 
               <p>"She had a certain way with her," which she declared was expressive of her quality; and whenever she was thrown into the company of those, who did not appear to endorse her pretensions, she would say "how uncomfortable to be among those whose inferiority is so palpable. It is my misfortune once in a while, as it is all people of rank to fall among dirt and ignorance, and so, too, it is their especial happiness to get away from it as soon as possible." There were many capital stories told of this extensive lady, none of which are more humorous than this to follow. She was out shopping one pleasant day with her daughters, and among the numerous places, where her expensive carriage was to be seen standing, while her ladyship was absent in the store, was the shop of a Jeweller-a very clever, though sometimes testy foreigner, who had frequently been honored with the presence of Mrs. Penniman, and though never a dollar had she dropped into his till, yet she had consumed much of his time and put him to great inconvenience.</p> 
               <p>On this occasion she had fancied a handsome clock, but she did not exactly know how it would appear on her mantlepiece, and wished the Jeweller to send it at <emph>once</emph> to her residence, on <emph>trial.</emph> The shopman looked at her somewhat attentively, and then remarked:</p> 
               <pb n="144-145" xml:id="VAC6064-00000073"/> 
               <p>"Marm, I should tink you could see, now, here, how dis splended clock would look on vone mantlepiece; it must of course looks vell."</p> 
               <p>"I want at once this clock sent to my house, sir, and if I like it I will keep it;" returned the lady.</p> 
               <p>"Vell, how long vill you keep it <emph>widout pay.</emph> I vant my pay ven I let my tings go from store."</p> 
               <p>"Sir, I am Mrs. Penniman, and pay for all I purchase;" responded the lady, in a very dignified manner.</p> 
               <p>"Yes, you pay for vat you purchase;" returned the Jeweller, "dat is vell. But if you take my clock and keep it vone month, and no buy, dat I should not like; because oters might like to buy in all dat time, vile you are looking at it on your vantelpiece."</p> 
               <p>"Sir," said the lady, indignantly, "I wish you to remember I am Mrs. Penniman of Penniman Square, and will not be insulted in this manner. Everybody who knows me, sir, is glad of my patronage, and want it on any terms."</p> 
               <p>"Vell," said the shopman, his face crimsoned with passion, "I-I-dont vant it at all. I don't care vone damn, if you <emph>are</emph> Mrs. Venniman; or Mrs. Tennyman, or vat de devil you are, you no cannot have my clock for your vantelpiece over vone day."</p> 
               <p>"Sir," exclaimed Mrs. Penniman in a rage, "you are a brute!" and with this" she and her girls" walked out of the store, as the Jeweller remarked: "I don't care vone damn-you can go to h-ll, Mrs. Venniman. You come to my store many times; you no spend vone cent. I no care vone damn, Mrs. Venniman!"</p> 
               <p>At these words the enraged trader ran his fingers through his uncombed hair, and muttering to himself some horrid oaths resumed his seat at the marble slab where he was at work. Mrs. Penniman had often been snubbed, but she had never received before so wholesome a check, as this of the Jeweller's. With whomsoever, and whatsoever she came in contact she wished to master; she desired all things and everybody to yield to her views; if they did not they were denounced and despised.</p> 
               <p>Many there were knowing to her weakness as respects the estimation in which she held her children, especially Nelly, whom she so much preferred, because she had won the affections of the son of so popular a man as the Hon. Mr. McAlpin,-because, too, she had administered to her highest ambition, which was to ally herself with "one of the oldest and best blooded families of genius in the city."</p> 
               <p>Nelly had realized all this for her mamma, and her mamma thought her a perfect treasure. Of the many letters which she had written to her daughter, since her absence, we can in no better way entertain the reader for a few moments, than to give the one in answer to that from Nelly, which has been presented.</p>

                           <p>Your letters come to me like <emph>rain</emph> from heaven to dusty streets. I am ever <emph>thursty,</emph> dry, in thought of you, dear. (The reader will note the grammar in particular.) And to think that you are to be <emph>cunfined,</emph> and I away from you, 'tis a pity and a shame, mind and keep up your spirits, and dont for God sake, get cold when the child is born. Keep warm-wrap up in flannels-or your after pains, will be pains indeed, they will be killing pains. I don't want to frighten you, but as it is your first child, you must be careful. I had a terrible time with my first, which as I have often told you did not live, and could not live-it had so much to <emph>incounter.</emph> Now, be you <emph>cortious,</emph> and do just as your doctor tells you, provided he does not tell you to do anything <emph>immodest.</emph> Some of these wretches are exceedingly, <hi rend="i"/>aut fat, (I believe that is the french of what I would say,) that is, they are clever at suggesting much to be done, of which there is not the least necessity. You know how it often times is with some dentists; mind, I say <emph>some</emph> only, who when they get a pritty woman in <emph>ether,</emph> they <emph>do just what they please.</emph> But I think there are very few in Boston who are not safe.</p> 
                           <p>If you should happen to have a boy, how glad I shall be-girls are not so desirable. You can do with a boy, what you can't with a girl-and girls, too, you know are always liable to <emph>misgoes</emph>-to get in love when they ought not to, and often times to get into a peck of trouble out of, as well as <emph>in,</emph> wedlock. If you have a boy, I shall<pb n="146-147" xml:id="VAC6064-00000074"/> deem it a God-send-and the day of his birth will be the happiest of my life-it will, indeed. And if he proves a genius-worthy of our blood, and that of the McAlpins, I shall fairly leap with joy. But, my dear, be careful, be careful, and keep your bed, until 'all is <emph>well</emph> over'-for if you get a <emph>cold,</emph> I shall never expect to set eyes on you again. Everybody is enquiring about you; and want to know when you will return, but I tell them what I please. They think you write equal to Lady Montagu, <emph>and look for a book of your travels.</emph> Do my dear have letters prepared for the press. Your father, I shall <emph>command,</emph> to furnish you with whatever money you want 'to go through the press;' or through anything else, that will make you <emph>famous.</emph> I am determined your parts <emph>shall</emph> shine. What is the use in a woman's having <emph>parts,</emph> unless she makes them known. The letters which have of late been published are mere <emph>trash.</emph> The foolish women who have edited them, I don't believe ever saw Europe; and compared to <emph>your</emph> genius, they are as dirt to calf-foot jelly. I made this <hi rend="i"/>semmeli the other day to Mrs. Touchmenot, and with her usual ridiculous air of pride, she said 'beautiful, it is really fine.'</p> 
                           <p>"You don't know how I despise all these people; still, they have <emph>position,</emph> my darling, and I must appear to respect them. I don't know any one whom I love better than myself, unless it is <emph>you.</emph> All the persons whom you mention in your letter are mere <emph>upstarts;</emph> they have contrived to get position by their <emph>money,</emph> but good Heavens! what <emph>is</emph> money without education, and refinement by <emph>nature!</emph> If nature don't make people <emph>gentle,</emph> what I wish to learn, <emph>can.</emph>

                           <p>"Andrews, and his <emph>lady love</emph> as they call her, (one Agnes Farriday, a common thing; they say a night-walker,) is just now the 'town talk.' She is thought to be as bad as any of the women she pretends to reform. Its all humbug-the idea of <emph>such</emph> a creature reforming any one. Andrews is lost, and hopelessly. What a lucky escape you made; thank Heaven for all such favors. My dear you must say your prayers once in a while. I know the gay life in which you are, does not dispose to this; but you must never forget your God, no, never: <emph>He is my chief support:</emph> since I put no confidence in any one but <emph>your father's pocket;</emph> and if God forsakes us <emph>here,</emph> we are forsaken, <emph>indeed.</emph> My dear, I find every day of my life, <emph>money</emph> to be more, and more of an itim; and to tell you the truth, I don't think there is anything under the sun, so great a <emph>specific</emph> for diseases in general as plenty to eat and drink and attentions from those, who are one's <emph>equals and superiors.</emph>
                           </p> 
                           <p>"People are buzzing about me, making my acquaintance, and actually truckling to me in every way, for <emph>favors;</emph> they know we have <emph>wealth,</emph> you see; and <emph>I</emph> know, they will not get <emph>one cent of it</emph> further than I can get <emph>two out of them.</emph> That is the way to do it, my dear. It is well enough to be pleasant with those whose acquaintance is <emph>desirable,</emph> but take care, they don't as your father says, 'get a snap judgment' on you, or, in no manner, <emph>ahead of you.</emph> You see, as <emph>dollars</emph> constitute <emph>real sound respectability,</emph> we must be careful to make them all <emph>tell.</emph> And whenever we find any one trying to <emph>spunge</emph> us, no matter how <emph>well connected,</emph> or <emph>pretentious they are,</emph> that instant we must mark them for inspection and inquiry. This is the only way for one to <emph>keep up in life,</emph> and so we have had to manage all along.</p> 
                           <p>"I'll give you <emph>all</emph> my experience in time, so that you shall flourish upon it-I trust with God's good grace, forever! I have no time to write you a longer letter; besides my finger-my pen finger I mean, is so sore, I could not-if I had the time even write any more. Take good care of James, and keep him from <emph>drink,</emph> for Heaven's sake! why, this is disgraceful. I wish I was with you, I'd break every bottle I got hold of, or put into them <hi rend="i"/>tartar emetic, or some other kind of <emph>compound</emph> that should <emph>straighten</emph> him out or up, one or the other. I suppose if he should die, you could easily get married as well. I don't for a moment doubt this; because you have to go upon, the <emph>prastige</emph> of the McAlpin <emph>name!</emph> and that is tremendous! much <emph>is</emph> in a name! I don't care what to the contrary the devilish poets say; among whom is that wretch of a Hamilton, the <hi rend="i"/>fact totum of Andrews, who insulted you by predicting damnation for you at your wedding. I think if the wretch was a woman, he'd have no objection to as much of such damnation as yours, as he could procure.</p>

               <p>Such was <hi rend="i"/>Madam Penniman, and such was "her style,"-and reader is it not a charming style, and is she not a charming creature, "standing as she does at the head of society." What a head, to be sure; what a bosom, heart, and <emph>soul;</emph> who does not envy all this loveliness, and who, O, who would not be a Penniman! To be bowed obsequiously to, to be flattered, and feasted, courted and in every manner to be informed, that one stands first! Ay, first! at the very top of the ladder of good things; plenty to eat, and plenty to drink, and plenty to <emph>dare</emph> with, even to the very point of shamelessnes; yet, your position is safe. You have <emph>money,</emph> you have impudence, you have a certain quantity of brain, which enables you to think yourself of the highest consequence, <emph>whether you are so or not.</emph> You can eat three good meals a day, you can enjoy fully all physical delights, and <emph>some</emph> mental ones, which are twins to the <foreign xml:lang="FRA">physique;</foreign> you can talk loud and large; you can backbite with a relish; you can misapply good actions, and scandalize worthy merit; you can eat hot pies, without suffering any ill effects; you can be all things unto all men; piously Scriptural in this, if nothing else; you can be witty with a laugh loud and long, at your own felicity; you can go to the theatre, and be instructed and amused by incomparable genius, the especial ministers of God! you can then go home, and abuse the stage, and denounce all connected with it as "cattle;" a most elegant, and <emph>natural</emph> expression in the mouths of the Pennimans. You can "cut an acquaintance" in misfortune; and you can do a thousand other as meritorious acts, at your august will and pleasure, and yet no one will especially complain, since you are "certain of your position," and in good credit with the Bar.</p>

Who would when they take the hand of a fellow being, feel that it is indeed the hand of friendship-that there is between man and man a tie of sympathy, which must last for aye, however disregarded and forgotten it may be? Not the "Penniman set," nor any other set, who arrogate to themselves any special grace, because that they are <emph>rich</emph>-because that they can have <emph>peas</emph> when they first come to market, and "fruit of the highest cost,"-because that they can control the banks and shave the notes of needy men, with money from these banks unfairly gained-because they can wear kid gloves, French boots, and pay for "an enormous wash"-because that they can insult the law, and employ able counsel to do the <foreign xml:lang="FRA">amende honorable</foreign>-because they can make game of "industrious habits," and scoff at the sturdy arm of toil-because that they can cry up their own stupidity, and pass it among themselves as current coin:-Grace, indeed, is theirs,-<emph>because they can do all this, and much more, too tedious to mention</emph>-because they are incompetent to be either truly <emph>men or women,</emph> but only the counterfeit of them-monstrosities of nature! who daily falsify humanity, and mock at those moral laws of Deity, which He has written in every heart, and upon every window of the soul:-thus, they can look and perceive in no direction without these holy lessons of love and truth, to guide them on to happiness and perfect harmony, with that resplendent sun of the spiritual world, in the midst of which the Creator dwells, and from which is dispersed His influence and his laws!</p>

                     <p>"ANGELS do not always appear under a visible or sensible form, nor in a figure uniformly the same, but they give proof of their presence by an infinity of different ways-by inspirations, by voices, by prodigies, by miraculous effects, by predictions of the future, and other things hidden and impenetrable to the human mind. The angel who might have killed Balaam's ass was not at first perceived by the prophet. Daniel was the only one who beheld the angel Gabriel. When the evils to fall on the family of the high Priest Eli were told to Samuel, the young prophet saw no visible form; he only heard a voice."</p>

               <p>MR. ANDREWS had doted on his son, and had high expectations of his prospects in life, since he went into the service of Messrs. Catchpenny &amp; Co. It was with no little difficulty that he succeeded in securing for him a situation with this firm, as there was a number of applicants, all of whom were young men of good ability and prepossessing appearance.</p> 
               <p>Mr. Andrews had not been unobservant of the great power of wealth, and the especial regard which was paid to the representatives of it in "New England." He had counselled his son by all honorable means to acquire it, and when he placed him with Catchpenny, he believed that he had put him on the road to fortune; he was happy in the thought; for Mr. Andrews was a very "high spirited man," and would have his son possessed of that power, the want of which he had been so much in need of himself, to command the consideration of our best society. The loss of his situation with Catchpenny was a great disappointment to the father, whose health, for some time declining, now began rapidly to fail.</p> 
               <p>It was on a day about six weeks after young Andrews' encounter with Rolston, in a room of the second story of his father's dwelling, lay bolstered up in bed a man with stern, though handsome features, and emaciated form, whose breathing was exceedingly short and difficult, and whose eye was dark and brilliant with soul. His hair was partially grey; his beard and moustache almost wholly so</p> 
                
               <p>Beside him sat a young man and woman, in whose countenances were the deep marks of sorrow, and with whom the old gentleman was in conversation. It was midnight, and a terrible storm raged without; the lightning was never more vivid, nor the thunder more terrible; it shook the house from "turret to foundation stone." The group of three whom we have mentioned were Agnes Farriday, young Andrews, and his father. Mrs. Andrews, exhausted by the care of her husband, had retired to bed in a room adjoining. It was at the request of Mr. Andrews that Agnes Farriday was present. The old gentleman was dying! and would not probably survive the night; but neither the son nor Agnes suspected his end to be so near. After remaining some time silent, he took the hand of William, and pressing it warmly in his own, thus spoke:</p> 
               <p>"My noble boy, in <emph>you</emph> I have had many hopes." At these words he motioned his son to draw near the bedside. He now placed his hand upon his head, and twining around his fore-finger a lock of the young man's light glossy hair, he thus continued:</p> 
               <p>"They were, however, all of this world selfish and unchristian; I was ambitious that you should be in the material world, a <emph>giant;</emph> that you should be a <emph>rich</emph> man, ay, Willie, <emph>rich!</emph> and live in as much style as those heartless capitalists who make style their God; but now that I know in this my last sickness, from a vivid perception and realization of spiritual truth, the utter worthlessness of worldly possessions, and the danger there is to the soul if oppressed with too many material cares, I would say to you let <emph>love</emph> be the governing principle of your life; and seek rather to be <emph>good</emph> than to be <emph>great.</emph> Be <emph>true</emph> to <emph>Agnes,</emph> as she will be most true to <emph>you.</emph> She is one of the noblest of women."</p> 
               <p>"Ah, sir, I have long been sensible of the worth of sweet Agnes," rejoined the son; "and she knows it too."</p> 
               <p>"Yes, yes, that I do," returned Agnes.</p> 
               <p>"Methinks, I see Throckmorton;" said the father. "Yes, here he is, beside my bed; he smiles and shines with a most peculiar light; he takes my hand, and now he kisses me; tells me of his happiness, and says I soon shall be able to go with him."</p> 
               <pb n="152-153" xml:id="VAC6064-00000077"/> 
               <p>"Your sight must be most clear, sir, to see the poor old beggar," remarked the young man, not a little surprised at his father's speech.</p> 
               <p>"My sight is wondrous clear," rejoined the old gentleman. "I can see through an immensity of space; there are many spirits in the distance; but Throckmorton alone is by me. He says, tell Willie, I love him as myself, and that the poor old beggar whom he watched on earth, does not forget him in his spirit sphere. Tell him, too, that in <emph>Agnes</emph> he has found a treasure, in comparison to which Nelly Penniman and Ida Robertson have little or no value. Tell him, too, that he has genius, and one to <emph>love</emph> him, capable of appreciating it. Tell him, <emph>I am happy,</emph> and so will he be, when he shall see <emph>Christ,</emph> and awake to the reality of his power."</p> 
               <p>"Oh, sir, this is indeed a great privilege, to see so clear," said William. "I have always entertained the hope of attaining to <emph>this.</emph>"</p> 
               <p>"You will, my son," rejoined Mr. Andrews, "as your mind more and more develops. Throckmorton thinks so too."</p> 
               <p>"You know," said Agnes, "I have always thought you would come to this state."</p> 
               <p>As she concluded, she remarked a strange appearance in the face of Mr. Andrews, whom she thought dead. She seized his hand; it was icy cold.</p> 
               <p>The son raised his father's head, who, perceiving their agitation, thus spoke:</p> 
               <p>"I am very weak, my children, and cannot long remain connected with the body. I shall leave you on my way to a country where sorrow is not, nor unsatisfied desires,-where all is <emph>harmony!</emph>"</p> 
               <p>"Would we, too, might travel with you," rejoined the son, in a soft, sweet tone.</p> 
               <p>"Be content to go when your appointed time arrives," replied Mr. Andrews; "be not <emph>impatient.</emph>"</p> 
               <p>"What is death, sir,-can you explain the process?" interrogated Agnes.</p> 
               <p>"Yes, my love, oh, yes," replied the dying man. "The philosophy of death is the philosophy of <emph>change;</emph> not of change in the constitution or personality of the individual, but a change in the <emph>situation</emph> of the human spiritual principle; which, instead of being situated in an earthly body, is placed in a spiritual organization; and, instead of living among the objects and personalities of the planet upon which the individual spirit was born, its situation is so altered as to fit it to live amidst more beauteous forms, and in higher societies. Death causes no more alteration in the condition of the individual, than the bursting of a rose bud causes in the situation and condition of the flower.</p> 
               <p>"Every thing is being incessantly 'born again,' or changed from one state of being to another; and this change is accompanied, accomplished, and confirmed, by transitional movements, or processes, which mankind term <emph>death.</emph> In the last moments of outer life, the spiritual perceptions are greatly expanded and illuminated, and the spirit is thus rendered competent to behold the immense possession of its second habitation."</p> 
               <p>Here the old gentleman suddenly stopped, and seemed quite exhausted; he locked his hands in each other, and placed them on his bosom, as if in prayer. William felt of his pulse, and found an alarming degree of weakness. He spoke to his father, but received no answer; again and again he spoke; no answer. He saw there was yet life in his parent, so slight, however, he scarcely expected him to continue more than an hour.</p> 
               <p>"Had you not better wake your mother?" interrogated Agnes.</p> 
               <p>"No, no!" said Mr. Andrews, "by no means, let her sleep; she needs it, and besides I know her to be perfectly reconciled to my departure. I wish to be silent a few moments, when I will resume my discourse on death."</p> 
               <p>Some ten minutes elapsed, when, in a voice almost inaudible, he continued his converse, during which time Agnes and her lover were motionless, gazing with sad countenances into the pallid and expressive face of Mr. Andrews, who spoke as follows:-</p> 
               <p>"The process of death is in this wise:-First the head of the body becomes suddenly enveloped in a fine, soft, mellow, luminous atmosphere; and, as instantly the cerebrum and the cerebellum expand their most interior<pb n="154-155" xml:id="VAC6064-00000078"/> portions; they discontinue their appropriate galvanic functions; and then they become highly charged with the vital electricity, and vital magnetism, which permeate subordinate systems and structures; that is to say, the brain, as a whole, suddenly declared itself to be tenfold more positive over the lesser portions of the body than it ever was during the period of health. <emph>This phenomenon invariably precedes physical dissolution.</emph> Now, the process of dying, or of the spirit's departure from the body, fully commences. The brain begins to attract the elements of electricity, of magnetism, of motion, of life, and of sensation, into its various and numerous departments. The head becomes intensely brilliant; and just in the same proportions the extremities of the organism grow dark and cold, the brain appears <emph>light and glowing!</emph> Then, in the mellow spiritual atmosphere, which emanates from and encircles the head, the indistinct outlines of the formation of <emph>another head</emph> may be seen! These super-sensuous processes are not visible to any one except the spiritual perceptions be unfolded; for material eyes can only behold <emph>material</emph> things, and spiritual eyes can only behold <emph>spiritual</emph> things. This new head unfolds more and more distinctly, and so indescribably compact, and intensely brilliant does it become, that it is neither to be seen through, nor gazed on, steadily, as one might desire; while this spiritual head is being eliminated and organized from out of and above the material head, the surrounding aromal atmosphere, emanating from the material head, is in great commotion; but as the new head becomes more distinct and perfect, this brilliant atmosphere gradually disappears. This teaches us that those aromal elements, which were in the beginning of the metamorphoses attracted from the system into the brain, and thence liminated in the form of an atmosphere, were indissolubly united in accordance with the <emph>divine</emph> principle of affinity in the universe, which pervades and destinates every particle of matter, and <emph>develops the spiritual head</emph> of which I have spoken. In the identical manner in which the spiritual head was unchangeably organized, is unfolded, in their natural progressive order, the harmonious development of the neck, the shoulders, the breast, and the entire spiritual organization. Whilst this spiritual formation goes on visible to the spiritual perceptions, alone, the material body manifests often times <emph>to the outer visions of observers,</emph> many symptoms of uneasiness and pain; but these indications are totally deceptive; they are wholly caused by the departure of the vital, or spiritual forces, from the extremities and viscera, into the brain, and thence into the ascending organism.</p> 
               <p>"The spirit arises at right angels over the head, or brain of the deserted body. But immediately previous to the final dissolution of the relationship which subsists between the spiritual and material bodies, there is playing energetically between the feet of the elevated spiritual body, and the head of the prostrate physical body, a bright stream or current of vital electricity.</p> 
               <p>"The birth of a child into this world, and the birth of the spirit from the material body, into a higher world, is absolute and complete!-even to the <emph>umbilical cord!</emph> which is represented by the thread of vital electricity, which for a few minutes subsists between and connects the two organisms together. It sometimes happens that immediately subsequent to the separation of the umbilical thread, a portion of the vital electrical element passes back into the earthly organism, and diffusing itself through the entire structure, thus prevents <emph>immediate</emph> decomposition. It is not proper, therefore, that a body be deposited in the earth, until <emph>after decomposition has positively commenced;</emph> for, should there be no positive evidences of such structural change, even though life seems <emph>surely</emph> to have <emph>departed,</emph> it is not right to consign the body to the grave.</p> 
               <p>"The umbilical life cord is sometimes not severed; but is drawn out into the finest possible medium of sympathetic connection between the body and spirit. This is invariably the case when individuals apparently die, and, after being absent a few days, or hours, return as from a peaceful journey, to relate their spiritual experiences; such phenomena are modernly termed, trances, catalepsy, somnambulism and spiritual ecstases. There are many different stages, or divisions of these states.<pb n="156-157" xml:id="VAC6064-00000079"/> But when the spirit is <emph>arrested</emph> in its flight from the body, and when it is held in a transitional, or mediatorial state, for only a few hours, or minutes, then the mind seldom retains a recollection of its experience-this state of forgetfulness seems to a superficial observer, like annihilation; and this occasional suspension of consciousness, or memory, is frequently made the foundation of many an argument against the soul's immortal existence.</p> 
               <p>"It is when the spirit entirely leaves the body-only retaining proprietorship over it through the medium of the unsevered umbilical thread, or electric wire, as it might be called that the soul is enabled to abandon its earthly tenement and interests, for many hours or days, and afterward to return to the earth, ladened with bright and happy memories!</p> 
               <p>"As soon as the spirit is wholly disengaged from the tenacious physical body, it begins to breathe the most interior, or spiritual portions of the surrounding terrestrial atmosphere, and is perfectly identical in every possible particular-improved and beautified-<emph>with those proportions which characterized its earthly organization.</emph> That is to say, it possesses a heart, a stomach, a liver, lungs, &amp;c., &amp;c., just as the natural body did, previous to its death. This, my dear children, should be to you a wondrous and consoling truth!"</p> 
               <p>"It is, my dear father, I assure you," returned the son; "I have never heard anything more pleasing from mortal lips."</p> 
               <p>"I shall always be near you. Farewell. Be true to Agnes, and she will be a great joy to you."</p> 
               <p>Mr. Andrews never spoke again; but after a few moments of struggle for breath, left the body, and joining Throckmorton, passed on to his spirit home.</p> 
               <p>Agnes and William instinctively turned to each other and embraced, with mingled affection and sorrow; both felt they had met with an irreparable loss, and could not control their feelings.</p> 
               <p>Mr. Andrews was one of the best natured and most gentlemanly of men, and although "only an artist," was a prince in all that pertains to manhood.</p> 
               <p>His death was sincerely and deeply mourned, not only by his family, but by all who in any manner had experienced the warmth of his sympathies, and the just sentiments he entertained towards all men. As his son gazed upon his calm features, forever cast in the shade of physical death, he drew a deep sigh, and after a moment of silence, placing his arm about the waist of Agnes, said, in most tender tones:</p> 
               <p>"Agnes, you see before you the lifeless body of one, who loved me tenderly; who taught me truth as he had reaped it from the <title>Bible,</title> construed according to his own apprehensions of the character of God, assisted by the precious works of <hi rend="i"/>Swedenborg. Now that his lips are sealed in death, I feel more than I can express, of veneration for the beauty of his life. Agnes, it was so pure, that e'en the running brook, wherein the pebbles at its bed are seen, as though no water covered them, might wish to be as free from stain. I have often asked myself how could this be; and once I said to him, 'Dear father, I envy <emph>you.</emph>' And why my son?' said he. 'Ah, sir,' I replied. 'Because I see in <emph>you,</emph> a resignation to the will of God-to the natural laws, <emph>I</emph> may not hope to <emph>ever</emph> make my own.'</p> 
               <p>"He, thereupon, turned to me, and taking me warmly by the hand, remarked: 'My dear son, I have come to the possession of this temper after many years of struggle-fearful struggle with my will, to which was subjected my understanding; and this struggle began long ere you was born, and ended not until you had grown far into boyhood. I ever thought of God, and wished to love him, and know his laws, but could not, no Willie, I could not-until, ah, bless Him for that hour, I studied faithfully the writings of <hi rend="i"/>Swedenborg. Here, oh, here I found my peace. I found all that you so much envy. When you go to him, your soul will be as <emph>mine,</emph>-resigned to God and to his just and beautiful laws.' "Now, that he has gone, and has died in the full belief of all that he has spoken of death, I am awake to the <emph>truth;</emph> and, henceforth, I will enter into those studies, which have made him so happy." As he concluded, a tear rolled from his eye-and turning he met the gaze of his beautiful Agnes. Her countenance beamed with the intellectuality of her brain. She pressed<pb n="158-159" xml:id="VAC6064-00000080"/> the young man to her bosom, and placing her head somewhat downward, and gazing steadfastly at him, said mildly, "My love, to-day you have found God! and that tear which I note upon your cheek, should be one of <emph>joy,</emph> not of <emph>sadness.</emph> Who could witness such a death as this, and doubt of Heaven. Ah, my best and noblest friend-well mayst thou be proud of <emph>such</emph> a father. Even as <emph>he,</emph> I found no peace, until I came to that fountain of lucid teaching, which gleams resplendent in every page of Swedenborg. How sublime is his interpretations of God's love, and who, oh who, can realize the grandeur of his mission, without tears, ay, copious, gushing tears, of thankfulness for this refutation of error-error, that for ages had filled the world with darkness, savageness and woe."</p> 
               <p>"Yes, my sweet one, clearly have I seen this error, and profoundly have I felt its degradation, its bitterness, and hates," rejoined Andrews, "and I have wondered why all this should be; why there was not a spiritual Christianity, that should unite all hearts, and in the eternal principle of love, make mankind as <emph>one.</emph>"</p> 
               <p>"In Swedenborg this Christianity is given," rejoined Agnes; "and any one who will earnestly strive to <emph>know</emph> his doctrines will be made one with God, and be perfectly happy. He makes Christ such a reality to man, and proves him to be very God, of very God, indeed so conclusively from the Scriptures, that he compels our love to Him, and puts us in perfect concord with <emph>all</emph> his works."</p> 
               <p>Young Andrews affectionately kissed Agnes and thanked her for her sentiments; they were, he said, in unison with his own; then stooping down he kissed his father's bloodless lips, saying, "Well done, thou good and faithful servant, enter thou into the joys of thy Lord." Mrs. Andrews, now entered the room, and beholding the corpse of her husband, she raised her hands in prayer, and in a low tone said: "Lord, not mine, but <emph>thy</emph> will be done."</p> 
               <p>Agnes at once went to her, and related the manner of the old gentleman's death, so full of hope and peace. Mrs. Andrews expressed herself as entirely resigned, and hoped in the providence of God, she might soon follow one with whom she had lived for so many years, in uninterrupted interrupted happiness. In due time Mr. Andrews was buried, after the forms of the "new church," and laid to rest among his kindred. On the marble slab which bore his name and age and date of death, his son had caused to be placed the following sentiment: <q>

               <epigraph> 
                  <q>
                     <l>"Oh, for sweet nature's face!"</l>
                  </q> 
               </epigraph> 
               <p>MRS. Andrews had but a small property, and for economy's sake she determined to move into the country, now, that she was deprived of Mr. Andrew's support, especially, too, as she was passionately fond of nature, and loved its study; besides, her son needed all she could save for <emph>him.</emph> She rented a small house in Lexington, and with no more delay than was absolutely necessary she took possession, together with her son and Agnes, whom she had become quite attached to, and time and time again had said how much "she regretted ever having entertained the least doubt of her honor and purposes." The cottage which they occupied was surrounded by very pretty grounds, and near and about the premises were fine trees, and a well ordered garden. Agnes was familiar with Bacon's instructions on gardening, and as she honored to a degree of uncommon respect the great philosopher, who revolutionized the ancient systems of Aristotle, and gave to science that objectivity, from which has sprung in a very great measure our present advanced civilization, she determined to persuade Mrs. Andrews to let her <emph>Baconize</emph> the entire estate, which the good lady was only too ready to do, since she thought "her Agnes one of the most fascinating women in the world," and often would say to her son-"Willie, if you had not have clung to Agnes, I would have boxed your ears, and that too, soundly, had I ever come to a knowledge of her, as I now have." "Yes, I knew that very well," the son would reply, and therefore I determined to please you. I was assured that when Agnes and you came to be well acquainted, there would be no two persons in life more inseparable." And so in truth, it was. Mrs. Andrews could not bear to have Agnes spend even one day away from her, but wherever Agnes went, she, too, must follow: happily the young woman was always pleased to humor the mother, for she dearly loved the son, and for <emph>his</emph> sake, if not from any other consideration, she delighted to gratify in all matters the one who had borne in her body, a soul so noble as his, with whom her fate was to be forever cast. Passionately fond of flowers, she cultivated them with great care. Her taste and skill in the art of gardening was proverbial; the neighbors all about were ever more pleased to have a bouquet from Agnes' garden than from any other; and many were the persons residing in the city who were furnished with these cheerful offsprings of nature, from her teeming flower beds, and by her own small soft hand.</p> 
               <p>While her lover was all absorbed in the study of Law, she was (besides interesting herself in his pursuits and materially assisting him thereby) equally engaged with the mysteries of gardening and agriculture. Both of them were poetical, and were ardent worshippers at the shrine of <emph>art;</emph> but she did all she could to restrain our hero in this attachment; for, she would say, "if, my dear friend, your ambition is to achieve <emph>power,</emph> your entire energies should be bent on politics and Jurisprudence-you should let <emph>art</emph> alone, as a study, or a practice; for you know, how impossible it is for a man of genius to turn his attention to <emph>art,</emph> and not weaken his powers for active employment. And then, too, what are artists? 'God's own, you will say.' "Yes, I admit it, but those who would escape the impositions of mere sensual life, will never make <emph>art</emph> a profession; nor will they incur the risk of this, by a too close and exclusive study of it." Thus would Agnes spur her lover on in the path to fame which he had chosen.</p> 
               <p>As he was seated one afternoon in the month of leafy June, with Agnes by his side, in a room which looked towards the west, where slowly declined the genial sun, soon to disappear behind the distant hills, Agnes, placing her arms about his neck, kissed him tenderly, saying:</p> 
               <p>"Shut up your book, love, you have studied enough to-day. Here is Juvenal, the prince of Satirists and good-fellows; read now a little of him."</p> 
               <pb n="162-163" xml:id="VAC6064-00000082"/> 
               <p>"Pardon me, my sweet one," replied Andrews; "let us talk a while."</p> 
               <p>"Oh, yes," returned Miss Farriday; "your will is mine. You know we sometimes agree;" and as she said this, she looked affectionately at the young man and smiled; then continued, "Would you could afford to be as bold as <emph>Juvenal.</emph>"</p> 
               <p>"Ah, love, I would I could!" exclaimed Andrews. "But I must be <emph>politic;</emph> I must make friends. I have little or nothing to depend on but the profession I am preparing to enter, with you and mother to support. I must make friends; but when I have made my mark, and am independent in a measure of policy, I will hurl at meanness and hypocrisy a thunderbolt that shall dash them to pieces!" He paused a moment, then continued, "That is really a beautiful letter you have received from Irene Caruthers to-day, who, through <emph>your</emph> influence, was induced to abandon a life of crime for one of purity; do read it to me again."</p> 
               <p>"Certainly," rejoined Agnes, as she laid down her work, and thrusting her hand into the reticule, pulled forth the letter, which read as follows:-</p>

                           <p>MY DEAR, DEAR FRIEND:-It is some time since I had the pleasure of a friendly word from you; but I am sure you have not forgotten me, and this will be proof positive that I have not forgotten you. Oh, how could I forget so pure and sweet a being. Ah, my dear friend, how little the world knows of the beauty of <emph>your</emph> character; but <emph>I</emph> know of it, and so does God! who has a reward laid up for you in Heaven. I am a successful teacher now, and all my scholars love me very much; and what you will be surprised to hear, I am going to be married to a talented lawyer, with whom I am sure I shall be most happy; and for this happiness I am indebted to <emph>you,</emph> dearest and best of friends. May God bless and prosper you. I am glad that your plague, Mr. Rolston, is dead. Mr. Andrews and yourself may now live in peace. I have been successful in reforming several girls, who had abandoned themselves, even as I abandoned myself, to crime, 
                              <emph>for the means of a support;</emph> they are <emph>now</emph> happy in well doing, and love me for my kindness to them, even as I love you, dearest Agnes, for your goodness to me. When I think how much wretchedness there is in Boston, in consequence of prostitution; of the generous-hearted and well-informed women who are hurried into it, from necessity, as they deem, my heart aches and my blood freezes, that <emph>it should be so;</emph> and I am almost resolved to devote myself to their service. This I would do willingly, if there were <emph>suitable</emph> homes for them in, or near Boston, to to which I could influence them to go, and where they could be rendered comfortable, and be provided with the means of <emph>honest</emph> support. I am sure such institutions would be most effectual in redeeming many a poor, forsaken, and suffering soul from a life of unspeakable misery. It is a very easy matter to say to the courtezan, come out of your evil habits; but they who indeed desire their reformation, will place the means fully in their power. Give them homes! homes! where they will find a comfortable bed, wholesome food, and friendly counsel. Certainly this is not expecting too much of our humanity, when it is borne in mind how much our blessed Saviour sacrificed of personal dignity, in dying upon the cross to symbolize his love for mankind. When, oh when, shall we come to believe that in doing <emph>good, we serve directly</emph> our Lord. I am sure, if persons who claim to be Christians, were in reality <emph>such</emph> they would do all in their power to aid the women who are leading a life of prostitution, to purge themselves of their sins, and return to a godly existence. How many, ah, how many, long for some friendly hand to grasp, that by <emph>it</emph> they may be drawn out of the pollution, into which a hard struggle with the world has <emph>forced</emph> them. I know, my dear, dear Agnes, <emph>you</emph> will do all in your power for this unfortunate class of beings, and so will dear Mr. Andrews. I know he has a noble soul, and needs but the <emph>opportunity</emph> to do, to accomplish <emph>much,</emph> in behalf of the poor and fallen. I, oh I, who have been raised up from degradation by your sweet mind, and generous heart, feel, and oh, how deeply! the greatness of the blessing conferred; and this makes me only the more desirous that others, who would be<pb n="164-165" xml:id="VAC6064-00000083"/> glad to live honestly, may have the opportunity offered <emph>them.</emph> Think, oh think, how many of God's children are waiting for human aid to reform, and live as Christians in a Christian land. I have often thought with what heart-felt understanding the poor harlot, weary of her ways, might repeat that touching stanza of Goldsmith's, which runs as follows:<q>

Oh, my dear Agnes, you do not know how much Mr. Frazar prizes you. I am to be married soon, when we shall go to Boston, and perhaps as far as Philadelphia.

               <p>"A worthy woman," said Andrews, as Agnes concluded the letter.</p> 
                
               <p>"Was there ever a more grateful creature than Irene," returned Agnes; "it is an unspeakable pleasure, I do assure you, this letter. Indeed they all love me very much, whom I befriended, and persuaded from a vicious life. I have experienced no ingratitude from them, whatever."</p> 
               <p>"You will be encouraged then to do further for this class of wretched women?" rejoined the lover.</p> 
               <p>"Indeed, I shall," replied Agnes; "for I know of no greater happiness than being instrumental, under God, of redeeming the fallen; and woman, too! whose lot is so hard. <q>
                     <l>'Loving again, to be again undone.'</l>
                  </q> This, my dear friend, is the fate of more women, than those who pay little or no attention to the well-being of society have the least idea of. The ranks of prostitution are filled with many a Julia, who loved not wisely, but too well."</p> 
               <p>"I doubt it not," returned Andrews, earnestly. "If God spares my life, and I obtain among men any influence, it shall be used in defence of these poor forsaken creatures, who meet with so little sympathy from the world in general. I will not rest satisfied until I have secured for them a home, based upon true and generous principles, where they may find friendly counsel, and the means of being virtuous and comparatively happy. If I can effect this much good for them, I shall feel that my life has not been altogether an idle one."</p> 
               <p>"I pray heartily for your success," rejoined Agnes.</p> 
               <p>At this moment the lovers were interrupted by the entrance of Mrs. McAlpin, who had just returned from Europe in company with her husband, whose dissipated habits had grown upon him to a fearful extent.</p>

                     <p>"HAVE you ever observed." said Lord Byron to Lady Blessington, "the extreme dread that <foreign xml:lang="FRA">parvenus</foreign> have, of saying aught that approaches the vulgar. In manners, letters, conversations, nay even in <emph>literature,</emph> they are always <emph>superfine;</emph> and a man of birth would use unconsciously a thousand dubious phrases sooner than a parvenu would risk the probability of being <emph>suspected</emph> of one."</p>

               <p>YOUNG Andrews for an instant lost his self-possession, but recovering himself almost immediately, he received his former playmate, Nelly Penniman, with the dignity which became him under the circumstances. Nelly saw at once he had not forgotten her conduct, which she had many times regretted, since her marriage to McAlpin; but she was a woman of the world, and therefore was not at all embarrassed at his distant manner. She was seated near to Agnes, to whom she had just been introduced, and soon fell into conversation with her, in the course of which she related many pleasant incidents of her travels, and rather prepossessed Miss Farriday in her favor. William listened, but said very little; no more than he was obliged to, in common courtesy.</p> 
               <p>"I really believe," said Nelly, twisting herself in her chair. "I really believe I have annoyed you both nearly to death with my chit-chat; but you know when one has been <emph>all over</emph> Europe, and seen and heard so much, it is quite impossible to resist the temptation to talk, even though it amounts to nothing, in a business point of view, as Mr. Andrews might think, perhaps."</p> 
               <p>"Never mind me, my ladyship," returned Andrews. "You know I was never anybody."</p> 
               <p>"Ah, Mr. Andrews, you have not forgotten, I see, the art of saying smart things," rejoined Mrs. McAlpin. "You should travel in Europe, if you would be polished in this particular."</p> 
               <p>"Indeed," returned William, "that being the case, I wish I had some of the wealth in the name of some of our city nobs. Faith, I believe for the sake of a little European lustre, I would turn sycophant, and <emph>toady</emph> awhile, if I thought this would enable me to carry my point."</p> 
               <p>"Toady!" reiterated the lady, evidently chagrined. "Why, do <emph>gentlemen</emph> toady?"</p> 
               <p>"Ay!" replied Andrews, firmly. "Were I to count up the number of toadies in what is termed fashionable life,' to each 'live head,' there would be at least ten 'dead heads.'"</p> 
               <p>"What am I to understand by dead head?" interrogated Mrs. McAlpin, with considerable dignity.</p> 
               <p>"Why, 'dead heads' are persons who assume to be somebodies, when in fact they are <emph>nobodies,</emph>" replied Andrews, his eye fixed on Nelly; "but pass in society and the world in general, on others merit. Your husband, for instance, is a 'dead head,'"</p> 
               <p>"What, Mr. Andrews!" exclaimed Nelly, quite excited. "I thought <emph>you</emph> a gentleman, sir. I find I am mistaken. You would not dare say this to Mr. McAlpin's face."</p> 
               <p>"You scarcely can conceive what I dare do, Madam," rejoined Andrews. "If I am not a <emph>gentleman,</emph> it is because I have been foully wronged. Perhaps you may guess my meaning."</p> 
               <p>"Guess!" reiterated Mrs. McAlpin. "That is a Yankeeism I have ceased to know anything about, sir; and 'tis a pity you are not more refined. Mother always said 'you were of a vulgar cast.'"</p> 
               <p>"And pray what else did your mother say?" rejoined the young man, petulantly. "I always believed her to be an oracle, and have ever been most interested in her sayings."</p> 
               <p>"Well, sir, she told me not to go near you," exclaimed Nelly. "And I am only sorry I did not observe her advice."</p> 
               <p>"Oh, do not get excited; the day is warm, you had much better keep cool as possible," returned Andrews.</p> 
               <p>"She told me not to go near you," continued Mrs. McAlpin. "But I was so sorry to know you were in a distressed condition, that I could not refrain from calling to<pb n="168-169" xml:id="VAC6064-00000085"/> see you, for the purpose of doing the offices of friendship. I am satisfied, however, you are all unworthy any such attention."</p> 
               <p>"You have been quick to ascertain so much," rejoined the young man. "Are you not mistaken, though. Come now, be just; do you not owe me every thing in charity?" "You have not treated me well. I came out to see you in kindness. You have received me spitefully."</p> 
               <p>Nelly paused for a moment, then resumed: "You do not appear to have forgiven a girlish folly."</p> 
               <p>"Oh, yes, I have. I forgive all those who play the fool, even though I am thereby a heavy loser," rejoined Andrews. "Certainly, I forgive you, Mrs. McAlpin; but I must confess you have brought with you from Europe, a certain enlargement of self-esteem, which I do not at all relish. For we are plain people in this cottage. My mother, Miss Farriday, and myself, like to be impressed by the manner of all who visit us, with the idea that we are at least <emph>their equals.</emph> The fact is, Mrs. McAlpin, we do not owe a dollar in the world; we are not so poor as you think us. <emph>We can take care of ourselves;</emph> and, though it was very kind in you to call upon us in the spirit of charity, with alms ready to bestow, yet, be assured we should not, under any circumstances, place ourselves under obligations to any one whom we could not love, <emph>and feel a pleasure in acknowledging their friendship.</emph>"</p> 
               <p>"Ah, well, this is just what one gets for being officiously kind," rejoined Nelly. "As to my manners, sir, they will continue the same, and I shall be very careful in future, not to put myself in the way of people whom they offend, e'en though for charity's sake."</p> 
               <p>"'Tis best, madam, that you should not," said Agnes, who had patiently listened to what was passing. "Much better, as the circle which you adorn hath but little in common with the great interests of humanity, and whenever it attempts to be generous, only appears ridiculous. Now I say this to you in all friendship, because humble as I am, I may yet give even to as elegant a lady as yourself some useful hints."</p> 
               <p>"Oh, certainly," rejoined Mrs. McAlpin, apparently not perceiving the force of Agnes's words. "Yet you have no idea how much one picks up of sensible things in a tour through Europe. I wish <emph>you</emph> could afford to go."</p> 
               <p>"It must be expensive, then, I should judge," returned Agnes, laughing the while in her sleeve.</p> 
               <p>"Oh, very," replied Mrs. McAlpin. "You have no idea of the expense. Why, it has cost us no less than between six and seven thousand dollars just for the time we were absent."</p> 
               <p>"That sum would have clothed and fed a great many poor," rejoined Agnes.</p> 
               <p>"Yes, that is true," returned Mrs. McAlpin. "But if one is ever to be thinking of the poor, whom it seems to me are 'unnecessarily numerous,' there would be little real enjoyment for those who have the industry to make money. It would be give, give, give-the whole time, indeed, there would be 'no end of giving.' But I have no more time to spend with you. I came here for a good object, and instead of being treated with the deference my position deserves, I have been used most shamefully. But Mr. McAlpin shall learn of it, be assured of that, Mr. Andrews."</p> 
               <p>As she concluded, she rose from her seat, and in the most dignified manner walked out of the house. At the door was a splendid carriage, in which a lady was seated, dressed in black. Nelly entered the carriage, and ordered the coachman to drive away.</p> 
               <p>She had no sooner left the house, than Andrews burst into a hearty laugh, in which Agnes joined.</p> 
               <p>"What an absurd specimen of a travelled lady," remarked he. "Upon my word, I never saw so much flummery packed in and on a person in all my life. Who do you suppose the lady to be, who remained in the carriage?"</p> 
               <p>"I am sure I can't imagine; some late arrival, no doubt;" returned Agnes.</p> 
               <p>"I'll tell you," rejoined Mr. Andrews. "That was Miss Touchmenot, who is soon to marry a man-monkey by the name of Sampson, which she insists is such a vulgar name, that it shall be Frenchified, and pronounced Sampsone."</p> 
               <p>"Oh, dear!" exclaimed Agnes, as she laughed most heartily. "What a perfect fool."</p> 
               <pb n="170-171" xml:id="VAC6064-00000086"/> 
               <p>"Of course, love; but then she came honestly by her nonsense," rejoined Andrews. "Her mother is one of the most absurd of women, and as to the father, he cannot write the English language, nor any other language with propriety."</p> 
               <p>"And yet they set themselves up for somebodies," returned Agnes. "Style themselves the <foreign xml:lang="FRA">elite,</foreign> do they not?"</p> 
               <p>"Well, they are the <foreign xml:lang="FRA">elite</foreign> of nonsense," rejoined the lover. "This is generally conceded. You do not know how much pleasure it would give me, when I commence the practice of law, to bring an action against these Touchmenots, Pennimans, or any of their set. I would give the books such a sifting as they never had before to strengthen my action, be sure of that."</p> 
               <p>"So, your old flame called to offer you alms," returned Agnes, playfully.</p> 
               <p>"Yes, and a capital joke it is," rejoined the lover. "I hardly think she will come on such a mission again."</p> 
               <p>"No, never; you may rely upon it," returned Agnes. "You have schooled her well."</p> 
               <p>"Ha! ha! ha! poor thing," replied William, throwing his head back on his chair. "How much there is still for her to learn."</p> 
               <p>"What think you would become of her, if old Penniman and the McAlpins should happen to fail some day, as the most prudent often do?" interrogated Agnes thoughtfully.</p> 
               <p>"Become of her?" responded William. "Why, she might find herself in the situation that Irene Caruthers was once in; and instead of offering charity, she might be glad of a bit from <emph>us.</emph> These things <emph>have</emph> been, my dear; ay, have been-and may be again. I don't think she would incline to do much <emph>honest</emph> work. It would be too hard for the <emph>pay,</emph> even if she knew <emph>how.</emph>"</p> 
               <p>"No doubt she would scheme to live as easy as possible, and they who do this slide readily into prostitution," rejoined Agnes. "I have seen it in so many instances, that it is a rule almost without <emph>an exception.</emph>"</p> 
               <p>"I should be sorry, very sorry to see her thus," returned Andrews. "Though it would please me well to have her lose a little of that absurd pride which makes her so offensive. Agnes, I have still to see that heartless woman humbled before me, in a manner as will surpass all fiction. She does not see her fate; but in my mission's glory I see it all. Yet, oh yet, will that deluded woman supplicate <emph>my</emph> friendship. Then will my hours of triumph come. But I do not, shall not rejoice, only as truth and justice shall be vindicated!"</p> 
               <p>"These are noble sentiments," responded Agnes. "They are my own. Ah, dear, when your talents shall have been acknowledged and rewarded, then shall I be happy indeed."</p> 
               <p>At this moment the sun sank below the distant hills, tinging the surrounding clouds with deepest crimson. Agnes, taking the hand of the young man in her own, pressed it passionately to her bosom.</p> 
               <p>"If your sun, my noble hearted, did not rise as refulgent as that just declined, I have faith in your hopes, and know that you will ere long entwine your name with the triumphs of genius! I feel it here, here;" and as she said this, she placed her hand alternately on her breast and head. "My bosom and brain both assure me-they have never, never <emph>deceived.</emph>"</p> 
               <p>Andrews, with a tear glistening in his eye, drew Miss Farriday closely to his side and kissed her warm impassioned lips, beautifully expressive of firmness and a chaste, chivalrous pride. At this moment a sweet little bird which had been skipping from limb to limb of a tree which shaded the window, flew into the room and alighted upon the shoulder of Agnes. She gently took it in her hand, and holding it near her lover's view, said:</p> 
               <p>"This little bird, my dear friend, has learned to love me and has cast away all fear. I can remember when it would not come within several yards of the window to eat the crumbs I furnished it; now, it takes them from my hand. Would you know of what this is typical?"</p> 
               <p>"Yes, my sweet one," replied Andrews.</p> 
               <p>"Of confidence!" responded Agnes. "Of that holy trust and love which I have in <emph>you!</emph>"</p> 
               <p>"Heaven is my witness, that I prize it as an influence second only to my religion," replied Andrews. "And my ambition shall ever be to prove by the results of my<pb n="172-173" xml:id="VAC6064-00000087"/> labors, the marked power which a <emph>true</emph> woman's love and friendship has to sustain the hopes of man, and to crown his efforts with success!"</p> 
               <p>And here we will, for the present leave them; happy in a sympathy and perfect understanding of each other's character and aspirations, which only a fervent and unselfish devotion can insure.</p>

               <p>THE arrival from Europe of Mr. and Mrs. James McAlpin, was quite an event among the "more exclusive sets." Everybody of this class was bent on calling to see "the travelled pair," who had taken expensive apartments at the Tremont House. They had been to Rome and kissed the Pope's toe,-to the holy land and stood upon the Mount of Olives, that overlooks Jerusalem. They had seen most everything of interest in Europe, and now were at home, to astonish their friends with the extent of their information. Nelly was quite animated in her discourses, concerning the attention she had received from the <emph>most illustrious persons,</emph> in all the countries she had visited; and her pride and self-importance was evidently a good deal strengthened by such <emph>high</emph> consideration. Her manners were regally dignified, and her conversation somewhat affected. She was in mourning for her child-a daughter, born at Athens, and buried at Smyrna.</p> 
               <p>The weather was excessively warm, it being August, when all persons who can conveniently leave the city for the sea shore, or inland, avail themselves of the privilege. Mr. and Mrs. McAlpin were making ready for a famous watering place, where, for many years, it has been the habit of city folks, who can afford the luxury, to pass the summer season. And many also from the South have located here for a few weeks, at the hotel, which is situated at the extreme point of a peninsular, and close to the storm-beaten rocks, that look towards the broad and heaving ocean-<pb n="174-175" xml:id="VAC6064-00000088"/>

                  </q>
               </p> 
               <p>This was just the place for Mrs. McAlpin, and her circle; who looked upon the villagers with contempt. Indeed, unless persons could afford to be gay and expensive, neither she, nor her mother, could "<emph>tolerate them;</emph>" they were "decidedly vulgar." At the hotel, Mrs. McAlpin attracted a great deal of attention, and made, as the phrase is, "a great dash." She was the observed of all observers; and being a beautiful and well formed woman, drew around her many beaux. Miss Julia Touchmenot was her confidential friend; and two more ridiculous women never were yoked together in amity. Julia would laugh at Nelly's nonsense, and Nelly would laugh and take part in Miss Touchmenot's folly. The boarders generally were disgusted with them; but were all smiles and pleasantry when in intercourse. There were a number of what are termed "handsome men" at the hotel; there for the purpose of getting up their health, (although looking far from sickly,) <emph>and securing rich wives.</emph> These men were particularly attracted by Nelly, and with rather more than a respectful zeal, they paid court to her. She, however, encouraged their attentions, notwithstanding the earnest remonstrance of Mr. McAlpin, who, though "generally tight" pretty much all the time, was at moments sober enough to perceive the improprieties of his wife, and to check them. Julia was so pursued by Mr. Sampsne, to whom she was engaged, that it was impossible for her to partake of that exciting species of enjoyment, into which Mrs. McAlpin entered so heartily. Sampsne was a perfect <foreign xml:lang="FRA">petit-maitre,</foreign> but by no means a fool. He knew full well if he permitted Julia free intercourse with the agreeable gentlemen boarders at the hotel, that he might find himself supplanted in her affections, and "cut out" of a fortune, the anticipation of spending which was most cheering to him, for he <emph>was without money and short of friends.</emph> We think we have never seen a man walk so gingerly, so mincingly; it really appeared as though he trod on something he feared. But Sampsne, although a sap, was a pretty clever sap, and certainly he was a very handsome one; with whom all sappy women were in love; in which number was no less an illustrious personage, than <hi rend="i"/>Nelly McAlpin; but their kissing and hugging had been so quietly done and with such caution, that Julia had not the least suspicion. Indeed, this young woman was none too quick-witted; although from the fact of her being a Touchmenot, she considered herself the equal of any; indeed, <emph>without a superior.</emph>
               </p> 
               <p>It may surprise some of our readers to learn that "so fine a lady as Mrs. McAlpin," would permit even so exquisite a gentleman as Mr. Sampsne, with his curly dark hair, and pretty black eyes, to pull her into his lap, and press her to his bosom; but these astonished individuals are unsophisticated and <emph>untravelled,</emph> generally speaking; quite ignorant, at all events, of the sly doings of fashionable life, <emph>at watering places!</emph> Nelly, so far from objecting to this familiarity, in common with other taking and well made ladies, was highly pleased at these unmistakable marks of appreciation, and made it convenient to be with "handsome and spirited beaux," at all times of the day, particularly in the evening, among the rocks, or some secluded spot,- <q>

               </p> 
               <p>Mrs. McAlpin was not only fond of sitting in the laps of handsome cavaliers, in lonely retired places, but she delighted in playing with their hairy lips, and smacking them heartily, now and then; more than all, she enjoyed the <emph>sea bath</emph> with a beau who was a good swimmer and <emph>affectionate</emph> withal; "she loved <emph>warm hearted</emph> gentlemen, excessively." This in fact was the case with all the young ladies at the hotel; and it was a matter of no little mortification to some of them, who were not remarkably prepossessing, that the <foreign xml:lang="FRA">beaux</foreign> were exceedingly shy of their company; whilst they were anxious for that of Mrs. McAlpin. It followed, naturally, that Mrs. McAlpin soon came under the animadversion of these "neglected boarders," who said many bitter things concerning her freedom with the beaux, and caused a good deal of commotion in the hotel. But Nelly was not "to be talked out of her fun," neither were the other ladies, who were fond of sitting in gentlemen's laps and playing with their well combed and perfumed whiskers. So the more the envious and disappointed females clamored, the more the successful ones carried on their "game of goose and gander." Mr. McAlpin frequently had serious conversations with his wife, in which he begged of her to be more discreet and guarded; told her of the reports in circulation, and pointed out to her the unpleasant position in which it placed him. Nelly listened attentively to all he had to say, and appeared willing to moderate her gayety, but she had been in Europe and had seen so much of this kind of free and easy life, she had lost all relish for any other. Then, too, she was well aware her husband was far from immaculate, and only required the excitement of wine to put him in the best possible humour for pleasing the ladies. Mr. McAlpin was not slow at the business of gallantry, and could handle a lady with the greatest delicacy, and at the same time <emph>familiarity</emph>-an art by no means easy of acquisition. Among the beaux at the hotel was a Mr. Gaseous, a vain and pompous man, a pushing and brazen-faced character, with bluff sailor manners, and as "brim full of self-conceit" as possible. He fancied, as most saps do, that the ladies were all in love with him; but when he came to test the matter he found himself mistaken, for no one whom he considered any match for him would smile upon his suit. It was his habit to walk before a glass and adjust his figure in a certain manner, adapting his gait thereto, at the same time admiring himself as the "handsomest man in town. He was quite an imtimate friend of the Touch<pb n="178-179" xml:id="VAC6064-00000090"/> menots, and for some time it was thought Julia would decide to Gaseous the Touchmenot's blood; and doubtless this would have happened, if the elegant "fop and fool," Mr. Sampsne, had not suddenly made his appearance, and won the adorable Julia "at first sight." She had always said she would love, if at all, at first sight, and sure enough she was true to her word. Gaseous was one of those men, whom to judge of from personal appearance, would lead one to conclude to be a courageous individual who would cuff anybody's ears, who should come between him and his expectations; but he was, however, a mere "bag of wind," and could pocket a disappointment or an insult in the coolest and pleasantest manner conceivable. A mere beau, like beaux in general, he was highly pleased with himself, and thought it very bad taste in others not to be pleased with him also. He was a pleasant talker of mere common places, had a good deal of anecdote, and a pretty fair knowledge of human nature; upon this capital, notwithstanding the drawback of his birth, he managed to push himself into "the most desirable company." But he was far from being a gentleman, which we thus define.</p> 
               <p>Such a one is not merely a person acquainted with certain forms, and conventionalities of life, easy and selfpossessed in society, able to speak and act, and move in the world without awkwardness, and free from habits vulgar and in bad taste-a <emph>gentleman</emph> is something much beyond this. At the base of all his ease and refinement, and tact and power of pleasing, is the same spirit which lies at the root of every Christian virtue. It is the thoughtful desire of doing in every instance to others as he would that others should do unto him. He is constantly thinking not indeed how he may give pleasure to others, for the mere sense of pleasing, but how he can show them respect, how he may avoid hurting their feelings. When he is in society, he scrupulously ascertains the position of every one with whom he is brought into contact, that he may give to each his due honor. He studies how he may avoid touching upon any subject which may needlessly hurt their feelings; how he may abstain from any allusion which may call up a disagreeable able or offensive association. A gentleman never alludes to, never appears conscious of any personal defect, bodily deformity, inferiority of talent, of rank, of reputation, in the persons in whose society he is placed. He never assumes any superiority, never ridicules, never boasts, never makes a display of his own powers, or rank, or advantages; never indulges in habits which may be offensive to others. We think, not only Gaseous would be more acceptable to society in general, if he would model his manners after the above pattern, but a large number of others, also, who figure in what are termed "fashionable circles."</p> 
               <p>We are not disposed to particularize the beaux who were in the habit of frequenting the sea-shore in the summer season, and playing "Kiss me quick," with the ladies. Nor are we inclined to enter into an analysis of their characters, and descant on the various parts, and their defects. We will content ourselves by including them under a general term, which is that of <emph>snob-fortune hunters,</emph>-men of large pretensions, but of empty heads. Many of them were the friends of Gaseous, and were about on a par with him; birds of a feather always flocking together. McAlpin, although associating with those sweet-scented individuals, drinking, gambling, fishing, and playing billiards with them, secretly despised the entire company; particularly a young <emph>Southerner,</emph> who had been quite marked in his attentions to Mrs. McAlpin, and was reported as having been altogether too intimate with her. Mr. McAlpin, although of an excellent temper, of the best humor possible, when <emph>in</emph> his cups! was quite the contrary when <emph>out</emph> of them. In these moments the foul and slanderous reports respecting his wife, nettled him exceedingly. He had every confidence in Nelly; and would not believe her capable of infidelity, though all the world should condemn her. Towards the young Southerner, he felt a degree of hostility which tempted him, at times, to desperate violence. He contented himself, however, for the present, with warning the gentleman not to pursue his wife any further; that, if he disregarded his wishes, he would do so at his peril. Nelly laughed at the bravado, as she deemed it, of her husband, when the<pb n="180-181" xml:id="VAC6064-00000091"/> young Southerner informed her what had passed; and this encouraged him the more to proceed with his gallantry. One pleasant, moonlit evening, the twain were discovered at a late hour, by McAlpin, on the off-side of the billiard room, seated cooingly together, on the grass:- <q>

               </p> 
               <p>As the lips of Nelly and the chivalrous Southron in the delicate language of the poet, "drew near and clung into a kiss," the "injured husband" happened to be near and a witness to the comedy. He did not laugh as some men might have done, but quietly "pocketing the fun," walked towards the hotel, where he procured a cow-hide; then seated himself on the piazza in company with Gaseous, and two or three other personages, well known in fashionable life.</p> 
               <p>Soon, Mrs. Nelly McAlpin and her gay Lothario came skipping along, laughing and apparently the happiest of the happy. The clock struck eleven just as the twain walked on to the balcony, where Mr. McAlpin bursting with rage and quite "in his cups," awaited impatiently their coming. As Mr. Artt, the Southerner, approached him he seized him by the collar, and then vigorously applied the cow-hide, exclaiming, "I'll teach you, sir, to<pb n="184-185" xml:id="VAC6064-00000093"/> let married women alone." Nelly alarmed at the rage of her husband, retreated into the hotel. Artot, having escaped from the grasp of the excited husband, drew the sword from his cane, and was on the point of running McAlpin through the body, when his arm was seized by the by-standers, and the weapon wrested from his hold. Being surrounded by his friends he was led away to his apartments, whilst McAlpin remained on the balcony in conversation with the adorable Gaseous! who thought "the d-n Southerner got just what he deserved." More than any one else he sustained McAlpin boldly, which was not a little strange to those who knew his chaiacter, thoroughly; it being a well-established fact, that he never permitted any opportunity to go unimproved for a love affair with taking and voluptuous <emph>married ladies.</emph> He was always "bobbing around." As may be supposed, this "assault and battery" on the gallant Southron caused a great excitement. Each had their respective friends, who were disposed to discuss the matter warmly. Gaseous talked so loud and seemed so valliant, that a witty Scotchman determined to "take him down." He knew perfectly well "his man," having studied him narrowly for some time-being by profession an author, whose especial business it is to be posted on every phase of character. The "adorable" had not escaped him in any particulars. Turning to Gaseous with a very stern countenance, and much solemnity of manner, he said:</p> 
               <p>"Sir, you are so loud in the cause of Mr. McAlpin, that I presume you intend to take a part in the duel. Mr. McAlpin, or some one else, sir, acting for him, will be called upon to meet Mr. Artt in the field, in satisfaction of his honor."</p> 
               <p>"Fight-fight-No!" replied Gaseous, brustling himself. "Who said anything about fight. No, sir, I'm not a fighting man. Good God! can't a man speak for a friend, without being expected to fight for him, I should like to know."</p> 
               <p>"Well, sir, let me tell you," returned the Scotchman, sternly, "Mr. Artt <emph>is</emph> a fighting man, and will look for you on the field, either as principal, or second;" then strode away.</p> 
                
               <p>Gaseous fell to zero, and gave others a chance to raise their voices in defence of an "injured husband."</p> 
               <p>The Southerner was a hot-headed fellow, and wanted to shoot somebody very much-upon a duel he was resolved. His friends, however, finding that his cause was a weak one, persuaded him to let the matter drop, and withdraw quietly from the hotel, which excellent advice, he concluded to accept. Mr. and Mrs. McAlpin also left immediately and proceeded to a quiet retreat in the interior of New York. At first they purposed to visit Virginia Springs; but as McAlpin had cow-hided a Southern man, he thought it more prudent to keep this side of Mason's and Dixon's line. We think he decided wisely. We have rarely heard an affair so generally and passionately discussed, as this attack of Mr. McAlpin upon Mr. Artt.</p> 
               <p>Julia Touchmenot declared herself to be quite disgusted with Mr. McAlpin's conduct; and could not understand why a married lady had not a right to flirt with any gentleman who might give her the opportunity. So thought the Yellowbodies, and a number of others, who were at the hotel, belonging to that "set," for which so much is claimed on the score of decency, refinement, superior intelligence!</p> 
               <p>The Blowhards were loud in their support of Julia, and so were the Catchpennys; and indeed, pretty much all that clique. Mr. Sampsne, however, thought such familiarity with married ladies, as Mr. Artt was known to take with Mrs. McAlpin, positively shocking, most disgraceful. As he was to be married soon, he deemed it wise to enter this earnest protest against flirting, so that his wife might not put him to the necessity of limbering a cow-hide over some insinuating gallant's back, which he declared he "felt sure he should do, if he discovered any man hugging and kissing his lady privately or publicly." Sampsne was not a very muscular person, apparently, though having a determined, brigand appearance: and we feel quite sure, if not able to use the cow-hide energetically himself, he would have drawn on his father-in-law, who was to be, for an amount sufficient to meet the expense of employing a drayman to do the work. We hardly think Mr. Sampsne had energy enough to whip any<pb n="186-187" xml:id="VAC6064-00000094"/> body, soundly; and that he regarded his day's work done, when he had shaved, eaten breakfast, visited the club, read the papers, dined, taken a siesta, a drive into the country, and conversed upon polite learning; then followed bed reluctantly and "balmy sleep," with an occasional loud snore, which much annoyed his next door neighbor.</p> 
               <p>Sampsne was what is understood by "a pretty man"-a fellow who "enjoys himself" at anybody's expense, save his own. Old Touchmenot was by no means pleased at the prospect of his having to support such a burden, as "a handsome shiftless dandy," who had the coolness to tell him one morning, that "he never should want for a dollar, while he had a cent in his pocket."</p> 
               <p>"Sir," said old Touchmenot, with his hard and leather-looking countenance, partially concealed by the downward posture of his uncombed head,-"Sir, do <emph>you</emph> use <emph>coppers?</emph>
               </p> 
               <p>"Not when I can get gold;" returned the exquisite.</p> 
               <p>And so it was with this individual always. "He did the best he could." He engaged himself to this old man's daughter for a comfortable home and income; and because the girl was much loved by her father, he was most forbearing towards "her choice," against which he had strenuously contended. When the affair which had created so much excitement, in which the McAlpins and Mr. Artt were particularly concerned, was related to him, he raised his right foot, and then violently placed it on the floor, saying:</p> 
               <p>"Fashionable schools and fashionable watering places are hells upon earth; there is nothing but fashionable prostitution in both. And I swear if these things don't mend a little, I'll lobby for a law that shall <emph>make</emph> them mend! Such doings-by Heavens! 'tis disgraceful."</p> 
               <p>This seemed to be the opinion among the "old fogies," pretty generally-those out of whom the "sap of lively youth had gone!" but they were only laughed at for their conservatism, and ridiculed for their want of good taste, and the power of enjoying a flirtation! "Young America," it seems, is irrepressible; and however indiscreet it may be, (even to lewdness!) yet it flourishes in all the fulness of triumph! Morals are nothing, common sense is nothing, but energy, snap, is all in all! do only something <emph>smart,</emph> O, Young America! and you shall be applauded to the echo, no matter how many virgins weep, or orphans are defrauded. Be smart indeed, inventive, incomprehensible; justice call a joke, and Heaven a dream; religion an experiment which does not and cannot succeed,-and you shall, if successful in your <foreign xml:lang="FRA">abandon,</foreign> your pleasing recklessness, be considered "the salt of the earth," and shall be praised exceedingly!</p>

               <p>THE McAlpins and Pennimans were in a high state of perturbation. Mrs. Penniman would not believe one word of the infamous reports, as she termed them, about her daughter. She thought it was most scandalous to say such vile things of Nelly, and only wished she could fix these slanders upon somebody. She was quite sure those "envious and abominable Atlays," were the instigators of the abuse of her daughter; but to her great discomfiture she was totally without proof. The Atlays boarded in the village, and were in the habit of visiting their friends at the hotel and attending the hops. Between the Pennimans and this family there was no intercourse whatever, although Mrs. Penniman and Mrs. Atlay had been school mates, and often played together. But as Mrs. Penniman did not deem Mrs. Atlay to be her equal, she slighted her acquaintance by "noticing her only when <emph>convenient.</emph>" Mrs. Atlay on perceiving the estimation in which she was held by the Pennimans dropped their acquaintance altogether, although without the least ill-will or disposition in any manner to injure them. For Mrs. Atlay was a high-toned lady born and bred, who would not stoop to a meanness of any kind however great the provocation. She was a woman not unlike Madam Parisan in the vigor, independence, and moral tone of her mind; and while conscious of her own respectability and position, was not at all affected by the pretensions and airs of others. She courted no one's society, but was affable and entertaining to all those who were of her acquaintances. She made no <emph>dash;</emph> she was a perfect lady, and a companion for the noblest of earth. Madam Parisan was her friend, and so likewise were many of the most solid, substantial women of the city. Yet, Mrs. Atlay was deemed no fit person for the circle of the Pennimans; and indeed she was not, for she was a woman of too much good sense to find any pleasure in pretension, or the follies of foppish conventionalisms. She loved sincerity, and she delighted in visiting, and entertaining in return kind hearts and generous minds; in common with Mrs. Parisan, she had a great respect for <emph>genius;</emph> and did all in her power to aid persons who were ambitious of fame. She and her daughter, as we before said, were the particular friends of Andrews, and did much to sustain him under his severe trials. Mrs. Parisan sympathized likewise with him; she was of the number of his most cherished friends.</p> 
               <p>The Pennimans, now that they suspected the Atlays of this spiteful treatment, these slanderous reports, were furious against them, and denounced them in most bitter terms. Mr. Atlay was highly indignant at this denunciation, and decided that he would bring an action against them for defamation of character; but he was dissuaded from this by his family, who declared the Pennimans "<emph>beneath their notice.</emph>"</p> 
               <p>Some days subsequent to the late affair of gallantry, Mrs. Atlay with her daughter, was seated in a confectionary store on Washington Street, when the Pennimans entered. They cast a look of contempt towards the Atlays, and with an air of great dignity, seated themselves in an opposite part of the saloon. The Atlays, perfectly self-possessed, appeared not to be aware of their manner, nor the insult intended, but ate their ice cream, cake and jelly, in perfect good nature. This non-chalance was any thing but satisfactory to Mrs. Penniman, who fired with spite, and the suspicion of wrong, was as a <emph>tigress!</emph> Had she dared, she would have assailed Mrs. Atlay on the spot, and would have soundly beaten her with her tongue and fists. She had never hated a woman as she hated this Mrs. Atlay, and vengeance she would have, sooner or later. Indeed, so excited was she, that it was impossible for her to remain in the room long enough to eat the ice<pb n="190-191" xml:id="VAC6064-00000096"/> cream and cake, which had been ordered. She arose abruptly, followed by her daughter, Mrs. Donothing, and walked defiantly out of the apartment, her face energetic with hate! Something she muttered to herself, which Mrs. Atlay thought to be, an oath of vengeance.</p> 
               <p>This was really the first mortification that the Pennimans had experienced-this cow-hiding affair, and it had nearly distracted them; in such a manner, too, that it was feared by the family physician, Mrs. Penniman would have to be removed to the asylum for the insane. But Mrs. Penniman, and in fact all the Pennimans, had so much self-esteem, assurance, and such a decided contempt for persons in general, that before many days they had reasoned themselves out of their mortification; and only wondered that they could possibly have fallen into that state of "vulgar and plebeian dejection."</p> 
               <p>As they passed from the store on to the street, they meet in full dress, and smiling as ever, the gay and dashing Julia Touchmenot, in whose company they continued walking towards the Common, which they crossed in the direction of the Mill-dam, talking quite earnestly and loud as they went along, with their elegant dresses sweeping the ground! Julia had just returned from Newport, to make some expensive purchases for the grand fancy ball, soon to take place. She was sure it would be the most successful of any which had as yet been announced; and she intended, she said, to do her full share towards "its complete triumph." She thought fancy balls were "such nice things," that all who could contribute to their success, ought to do so, as much, and even more, than to the cause of Christianity! for Christianity, she declared, was oftentimes misused, but balls, never! And she was so fond of dancing, too. She so delighted to feel herself affectionately pressed by her partner in the "imperial waltz." <q>
                     <lg type="quotation"> 
                        <l>"Muse of the many twinkling feet! whose charms</l> 
                        <l>Are now extended up from legs to arms!"</l> 
                     </lg>
                  </q>
               </p> 
               <p>Yes, Julia was fond of balls, of being twirled about, and tightly hugged; so, indeed, were all the young women of "her set;" they loved exercise; not that they cared anything about the beaux; oh, no, but only the excitement ment of the motions-the "healthy exercise" obtained, in the kindly arms of "dear darling beaux."</p> 
               <p>None of these ever missed a ball; they had rather miss their prayers a thousand times than Newport once, in its gayest season. For here, and then, they "put on their best," and here, and then, they sometimes made their market, sold themselves to some "good-looking gentleman," who could afford to keep them well dressed and well stuffed, and who would pay their bills. They danced to some purpose, when they happened to dance into the keeping of men, who, for their taking forms, and full round bosoms, and well-filled purses oftentimes, engaged to attend to all their wants, eternally! A courageous promise, which too many but imperfectly fulfill. Yet, they are in demand, and that maiden whose charms are on such bestowed, is of all others deemed most fortunate. How envious are they, who cannot match at Newport, or some other market, where trade is brisk.</p> 
               <p>Reader, do you talk of prostitution among the low? behold it in all its sad criminality among the high!-Watch that young woman; see her arts; see how she baits her hook; how she contrives; and say, oh, say, if <emph>this</emph> is not the precise management of the courtezan! Is she not debauched in mind, and does she not traffick in her charms? Why is that bosom dressed so low? why is that form made up so sensually? why that neck so bare? why those arms so much exposed? why those eyes so fascinatingly contrived, and why those cheeks so trained to blush, those lips so ready to express their hopes? And why, alas! that tongue so musical with passion, poetry, and all the clap-trap of seduction-O, why? for a husband, of course-a keeper-a friend-a somebody to <emph>love.</emph> Ah, yes! to love, indeed! would it were so; for then there would be some palliation for all this harlotry; but these do not marry to love, but to <emph>live,</emph> and frequently more loosely than ever! Oh, ye, who have not the advantage of these market-places by the sea, wherein to sell yourselves for better or worse to some letcherous, well-dressed, soft-spoken man, who never thinks of woman, other than his toy, be not envious, be not sorrowful, be not discontent, for your hearts, your hopes, your happiness<pb n="192-193" xml:id="VAC6064-00000097"/> ness, not being thus imperilled, you have much to console you, and much at which to rejoice. The entire system is one of immorality, and whoever lays up their hopes in <emph>it,</emph> may look for disappointment and despair.</p> 
               <p>As Mrs. Penniman walked by the side of Julia, she asked her concerning the company at Newport, whether it was quite select, or otherwise, to which Miss Touchmenot replied:</p> 
               <p>"Oh, quite distinguished! Though there are some vulgar people there, as always will happen. People with <emph>money,</emph> you know, go any where; and the less they are noticed, the more obtrusive, I really believe, they become. Some of the New Yorkers are <emph>mere trash;</emph> and some from the <emph>West</emph> are <emph>hoggish</emph> enough, I do declare."</p> 
               <p>"Well, what else can you expect, my dear girl, of people who are bred among swine," rejoined Mrs. Penniman. "If one associates with, and gets their living through and by cattle and hogs, how <emph>can</emph> they be refined? One never knows much about characters from New York, the South or West! There is nothing like our New England stock-this we know <emph>is</emph> good."</p> 
               <p>"You may say what you please against New York and the West," returned Julia; "but you shall not speak unkindly of Southerners. I like them <emph>so</emph> much; <emph>I do,</emph> indeed! They are such capital fellows to flirt with, such perfect ladies' men."</p> 
               <p>"They are well enough," returned Mrs. Penniman, "when one knows who they are. For my part I like to know all about people-who, and what they are. It is not safe, you will find, to make the acquaintance of individuals simply because they are <emph>agreeable.</emph> The devil himself is one of the most agreeable persons; yet I am sure you would not <emph>knowingly</emph> be of <emph>his</emph> company."</p> 
               <p>"I might if he was pretty and could say pretty things, in a 'taking way,'" replied Julia. "Then, if he could dance well, sing well and <emph>swim</emph> well, I am sure I should cultivate his acquaintance."</p> 
               <p>"Oh, you do but jest," returned Mrs. Penniman. "Who are these persons coming up the street?"</p> 
               <p>"There? why they are the Catchpennys," replied Julia. "How those girls do want to get engaged."</p> 
                
               <p>"Yes, and how their mother manuvers for them," replied Mrs. Penniman. "Deliver me from manuvring mothers, above all things. The gentleman with them, I think, is Dr. Ricado-poor Dr.-it's a pitty he can't get some one to have him. He is a real standing dish, and so too is Dr. Whiskers."</p> 
               <p>"Do you know that I detest that Dr. Whiskers," rejoined Julia. "I heartily despise him."</p> 
               <p>"Do you, really! well, I am surprised at that," returned Mrs. Penniman.</p> 
               <p>"I am sick of men who call themselves doctors, and whom I would not trust to take care of a sick toe;" rejoined Miss Touchmenot.</p> 
               <p>"Yes, but then they are very pleasant beaux," returned Mrs. Penniman, "and in cases where they are well connected, and have the means to support themselves handsomely, I cannot see the objection to them.</p> 
               <p>"Well, I don't know as there is really any objection to them," returned Julia, "but then this Dr. Whiskers is such a queer fellow; why, he seems to me more like a saint than a man. Ha! ha! ha!</p> 
               <p>"He does, upon my word, and that he may be for aught I know," returned Mrs. Penniman, smiling at the idea; "there are a great many persons styling themselves men, who ought to be saints or in petticoats-'tis bearly possible he may be one. Ha, ha, ha."</p> 
               <p>'Tis shameful for women to wear the breeches, but, as you say, they will sometimes," returned Miss Touchmenot.</p> 
               <p>"A fine show shop this world," rejoined Mrs. Penniman; "at least I should think so, by the extravagance of the Catchpenny's dresses; but then toys must be pretty, to command a sale."</p> 
               <p>"And you know," rejoined Miss Julia, "it does not matter much who the purchasers are, so that they have plenty of money; they are in that case accounted great cards, and the girls like to play them, if they are a little soiled. No sensible girl expects to get a man of any sort of attractions, with his virtue in any other condition than a most ragged one."</p> 
               <p>"A lamentable state of affairs to be sure," rejoined Mrs. Penniman.</p> 
               <pb n="194-195" xml:id="VAC6064-00000098"/> 
               <p>"Did you notice where the Catchpennys went?" interrogated Miss Touchmenot.</p> 
               <p>"There they go across the common," replied Mrs. Penniman; "seeing us they appeared to go in that direction for the express purpose of avoidance."</p> 
               <p>"Do you really think so?" returned Julia. "I've really thought the Catchpennys very much attached to us."</p> 
               <p>"That may be," rejoined Mrs. Penniman; "but there's little or no sympathy between us, and she knows it, and that makes her shy."</p> 
               <p>"Who was that couple just past,-wasn't that young Andrews?" interrupted Julia.</p> 
               <p>"Yes," returned Mrs. Penniman, "young Andrews and his lady-Agnes Farriday."</p> 
               <p>"You don't say," rejoined Miss Touchmenot; "what a splendid couple. She is one of the handsomest women I ever saw, and he is the very handsomest man. What eyes they both have. My gracious! they are full of fire and pride."</p> 
               <p>"She-you know what she is?" rejoined Mrs. Penniman.</p> 
               <p>"A common creature, I have understood," replied Julia," but I don't believe a word of it. The fact is, every woman is common, in the opinion of <emph>some</emph> people, who may have independence enough to do as she pleases."</p> 
               <p>"But I tell you, she is not chaste," replied Mrs. Penniman. "My sons know all about her. Oh, here are those hateful Atlays. Come, let's go in."</p> 
               <p>Both Mrs. Penniman, her daughter, and Julia, who were by the door-steps of the latter's residence, disappeared into the house at once in order to avoid the Atlays, whom they detested. They were to leave in a few days for Newport, to be at the grand fancy ball.</p>

               <p>WHEN William Andrews was forsaken by Nelly Penniman and McAlpin taken in his stead, he was deeply moved and bent on some means of revenge; but his father, who was a cool, collected man, stayed his passion and said:-</p> 
               <p>"Let your life, my noble boy-your goodness and virtue be your revenge. Go on with a thorough intellectual training, aspire to become a man of influence, and when you have won for yourself a position, let the world see, and the Pennimans in particular, that the insult offered to your youth has been wiped away by the glory of your manhood." These words were indelibly impressed on the mind,-the memory of young Andrews; and he determined to accept this as the purpose of his life, and to triumph over those who had so grossly ill-treated him. He had secured the love of a noble woman and was now a practising and promising lawyer.</p> 
               <p>Strange to relate, among his first cases was a suit against Mr. Penniman, brought in favor of a master-mechanic for extra work done on some building belonging to Penniman. To the great joy of Andrews he obtained his case, and thus took his step on the first round of that ladder, which was to raise him in triumph over those who had insulted and spurned him.</p> 
               <p>Penniman, as we have said, was a close-fisted rascal; and to have been beaten in this matter by a young man, whom he had deemed so inferior to himself, was a circumstance, from the effect of which he did not soon recover. It threw him into a violent fever, and enraged his wife, also, to an alarming degree; she, however, was always ready for an excitement whenever the family interest was directly or indirectly assailed.</p> 
               <pb n="196-197" xml:id="VAC6064-00000099"/> 
               <p>Andrews for the first time in his life had made himself <emph>felt</emph> by these people, whilst McAlpin was amusing himself with cow-hiding his friend for too great an intimacy with his wife, and drinking himself merry, daily. Certainly the contrast was marked; and now, that young Andrews was pronounced one of the most talented and promising members of the bar, everybody exclaimed, "How much the superior of McAlpin!" It had taken them some time to find this out; but they were quite sure they had made no mistake. He had met and vanquished the Pennimans in court, and this, too, in a most masterly manner; nothing could have delighted him more, or put him in better humour with himself. He was in the course of a week to be married to Agnes Farriday; many persons from the city intended to be present at the ceremony, which was to take place at Lexington.</p> 
               <p>Agnes had her wedding-dress all in readiness, and was one of the happiest women in the anticipation of being so soon united to the man whom she so dearly loved. Ida Robertson, whom the reader will remember, as the lady who succeeded Nelly in the regard of Mr. Andrews, was quite affected at the news, that he was indeed to be married to such an "abandoned woman." Because, she had always hoped he would marry <emph>her,</emph> eventually; notwithstanding, she was constantly striving "to catch" every desirable man, with whom she became acquainted, and had treated him neglectfully in his troubles. She thought he would not be likely to meet with just such a woman as he hoped for; and that in case she failed to make her market elsewhere, she should have him "to fall back upon." Andrews, however, understood her perfectly, and had determined to remain single all his life, rather than to be wedded to Ida. "Modern Athens" is overrun with just such young women as she; and the task would not be an easy one to write out all their characters with the peculiarities belonging to each. Were we willing to incur this labor, they would be easily recognized by those familiar with "good society" in this growing metropolis. We have been amused, greatly so, at the game for a husband, that is played among the more cultivated grades of society, as well as the lower strata. The pen of the satirist has been earnestly employed in every age, to regulate the manners of this class of genteel idlers; but, it is useless to attempt to redicule, or to shame them into decency.

               <p>We are not among those who expect of women impossibilities; we know they are human, and are subject to all the evil passions of humanity. Boccaccio in his "Decameron" has told us of what they were capable of doing in his day, and we fear they are not much more reliable in our own. It is only by knowing what society has been, that we may be put on our guard against what it may become again. Indeed, the Julias, the Mrs. McAlpins, and the Catchpennys of life, are always to be feared; and if<pb n="198-199" xml:id="VAC6064-00000100"/> we would learn their real characters, and proclivities, we have only to turn to the Decameron of Boccaccio and kindred works.

               <p>THE Summer had passed, and all those who had resorted to the sea-shore, or to the country for pleasure, had returned. It was a Sunday; the wind was cold and boisterous, but the sky was clear, and the beams of the sun most grateful. Ida Robertson sat alone in her chamber, a pleasant room in the third story of a house located in T e Street. She had of late lost her father and mother, and was at present residing with a widow aunt, to whom she was much attached from girlhood.</p> 
               <p>She was a very beautiful woman, with a countenance open, and much the more interesting, by the tinge of sorrow with which it was sweetly marked. She had loved Andrews, as she believed; but she never realized the depth of that sentiment, until she had mingled much with society, and had learned the superior worth of his character over all others with whom she became acquainted. She had been successively addressed by a number of fast young gentlemen, worthless for all practical pursuits. They had flattered her exceedingly, and endeavored to win her affections, or rather her <emph>money.</emph> Her father was known to be a man well off, but it appeared at his death that he had been considerably overrated; still, Ida was left a handsome property, which she shared liberally with the worthy poor, who were in the habit of relying on her for assistance.</p> 
               <p>Through the Christian kindness of this lady, some dozen families were handsomely aided and protected from want; indeed, she never refused aid to any beggars, who inspired her with a belief in their distress; so much in contrast with that act of brutality which old Throck-morton experienced at the door of a wealthy man, which<pb n="200-201" xml:id="VAC6064-00000101"/> we detailed in an early chapter. Ida, though generous-hearted, was calculating and shrewd, and although she had been pressed by many fascinating men to marriage she had escaped them all, in hopes to win her first and only love, William Andrews. Since his intimacy with Agnes Farriday had become public, and it was understood generally that he was to marry her, Ida had fallen into a state of misery, not easily described.</p> 
               <p>She had uniformly refused to see anybody, and rarely went upon the street, unless in the evening, when she could walk unobserved. She had repeatedly endeavored to have an interview with Mr. Andrews at her room, since his acquaintance with Agnes, but he had always studiously avoided a meeting, and for the reason, he knew it would be a painful one; it could not be otherwise. He had written in reply to her letters, invariably with courtesy and kindness, but always with firmness in the resistance of her claims to his affection. She wished him to cast off Miss Farriday, and take her to his bosom. This was not in his power to do, as Agnes had bound him to her by a spell of sympathy, he could not, if he would, remove.</p> 
               <p>When Ida fairly realized that Andrews was fully lost to her, and forever,-that all the long cherished hopes which she had entertained of being joined to him in the holy bonds of wedlock were a delusion, she was nearly frantic from disappointment and despair. But Ida was not so weak of mind as to destroy herself at once, though self-destruction was often present to her soul; and at times there was a peculiar delight in meditating the step; for beyond this world she thought there might be happiness, and she had given up all expectation of joy, or e'en peace of mind in this. Yet, until young Andrews should marry, which would unalterably fix her fate, she felt it would be the extreme of rashness to take her own life; but now that Agnes had been lawfully taken to his bed and board, she was resolved to leave a world which was all sin and darkness to her.</p> 
               <p>She had written a touching note to Andrews, begging him to call at her rooms, which he replied to, granting her request; and she was now momentarily expecting him. As she sat beside a table reading, the door slowly opened, and young Andrews gravely entered.</p> 
                
               <p>On beholding him Ida fainted: he advanced towards her with a tumbler of iced water and dashed it in her face, at the same time unloosening her dress, and applying friction to her body. He finally succeeded in restoring entire consciousness, when, perceiving the state of her mind, he imprinted an affectionate kiss on her pale lips and implored her to be cheerful and happy, at the same time seating himself in a chair beside her.</p> 
               <p>"Happy! ah, sir; Agnes Farriday has made that <emph>impossible.</emph> How could you have wronged me so?"</p> 
               <p>"Ida, look me in the eye," returned the young man, in a soft, but firm tone, "and say, if I have not been all to you I ever <emph>promised.</emph>"</p> 
               <p>"Promised!" reiterated Ida, 'her eyes pleading' softly for her. "You have never <emph>promised</emph> anything, but you have known how much I loved you, and how entirely my happiness depended on being wedded to you."</p> 
               <p>"Yes, this is true," rejoined Andrews, solemnly, "but I warned you against this state of feeling, which I have never encouraged either by word or deed,-the fault is entirely yours if my love for Agnes Farriday gives you pain."</p> 
               <p>"I could not control my feelings," rejoined Ida, weeping; "God knows I could not. I have endeavored in every possible way to do so, by various means; by endeavoring to become interested in others; by mixing in the gayeties of life, and even in its most childish follies; but all that I have done, all that I can do, will never, never displace from my mind <emph>your</emph> virtues, I so much adore."</p> 
               <p>"Oh, how wrong, how very wrong, Ida, to permit yourself to love an earthly object so passionately, to whom you are entirely unsuited, and who is now wedded to another. Be rational-do be rational," replied he.</p> 
               <p>"I know I do <emph>very</emph> wrong in thus loving <emph>you,</emph> sir, but I cannot help it, no, I cannot, indeed. You are so virtuous and so noble!" responded Ida, in tears.</p> 
               <p>"Perhaps more so in your imagination than in reality," returned William. "Be assured the world contains many a better man than I, and you have only to seek them out to find them."</p> 
               <pb n="202-203" xml:id="VAC6064-00000102"/> 
               <p>"Well, it may be so," rejoined Ida, "yet I cannot go back to youth again and form the interest in any one, I take in <emph>you;</emph> this is impossible. I love you devotedly; other men, however meritorious they may be, I can but respect."</p> 
               <p>"I am sorry to be the cause of so much pain to you, I am, indeed," rejoined Andrews. "The bitterest cup I have yet had in life to drain, is this ill-starred affection you entertain for me. Why, oh, why was I born to make you thus miserable." As he concluded, the tears ran copiously down his cheeks.</p> 
               <p>"Do not weep, sir;" replied Ida, tenderly. "I will try and overcome my misery; for <emph>your</emph> sake, yes, love, for <emph>your</emph> dear sake;" and as she said this, she placed her arms about the young man's neck and kissed him fervently.</p> 
               <p>"You know, Ida, how wrong it would have been for me, not finding in you the being my soul craved, to have taken you to wife;" returned Andrews, fixing his most expressive eyes on the lady. "What could have compensated for this want of harmony, to be transmitted to our children!! Who can calculate the infelicity attending the want of perfect adaptation of one to the other in <emph>connubial</emph> love. Think, oh think of it, Ida, and be satisfied with matters as they now stand."</p> 
               <p>"I am sure time would have assimilated us completely;" rejoined Ida. "My love was and is capable of moulding me into any form pleasurable to <emph>you.</emph>"</p> 
               <p>"I doubt it not;" returned Andrews, "but your love could not have supplied what was entirely <emph>foreign</emph> to your <emph>scope;</emph> now do you understand me."</p> 
               <p>"I think I do;" returned Ida, wofully dejected; "I think I do; but, I cannot understand what more is within the scope of Miss Farriday, than there is in <emph>mine.</emph>"</p> 
               <p>"She has a hardier nature than yours, and is much better fitted for the stern life I have marked out for myself than you are;" here, he paused for a moment, and observing Ida considering his words thoughtfully, thus proceeded; "Agnes is thoroughly adapted to my requirements-my necessities. <emph>You</emph> should marry a man whose path in life is not a stormy one, because <emph>such</emph> a man you could 
                  <emph>sustain,</emph> and with <emph>such</emph> a man you would be <emph>happy;</emph> but with <emph>me</emph> you would never be happy. You would feel yourself a <emph>burden</emph> to me, not a support; and you certainly would not be able to find <emph>joy</emph> where you were aware of <emph>incompetence.</emph> This, Ida, is a too, too practical life; we must not trifle with its necessities. Those only should marry who are <emph>thoroughly qualified to assist each other</emph> to the best advantage."</p> 
               <p>"I admit you speak sensibly," returned Ida; "you never speak else; but I cannot forgive Agnes for thus cutting short my hopes."</p> 
               <p>"Blame her not," returned he earnestly; "many times has she said, 'I am so sorry for Ida. Willingly would I give place to her, with <emph>your</emph> permission:'-no, no, blame not Agnes-blame me-<emph>me.</emph>"</p> 
               <p>For some moments both were silent; Ida's head reclining on William's shoulder; the eyes of both were tearful, and each sighed deeply.</p> 
               <p>"'Tis hard to think, I shall never in this life share your confidence, as Agnes does;" remarked Ida, mournfully; "yes, very hard. She does not, she cannot love you more than <emph>I.</emph>"</p> 
               <p>"I question not your affection," returned Andrews, "no, no; I know you believe yourself devotedly attached to me, and I will reward you to the extent of the most sincere and spiritual <emph>friendship;</emph> beyond that, however, I am not at liberty to go."</p> 
               <p>"Oh, that Agnes Farriday!" exclaimed Ida, rising from her chair, and with a wild look confronting Andrews. "I feel my brain on fire! What to do I know not, for relief. I feel 'tis threatened madness-madness-madness; oh, God, what a heat oppresses my poor brain!"</p> 
               <p>As she concluded she fell heavily into a chair and buried her head in her hands, weeping pitifully. Our hero was much disturbed, as he plainly saw the mind of the lady was much unsettled, clearly indicated by the fiery and dilated eye. He went to her and bending over her body, pushed the ringlets from her cheeks, and kissing her fervently, said:</p> 
               <p>"Do not sorrow thus; you know so long as you shall live, my friendship will endure, and that you will never<pb n="204-205" xml:id="VAC6064-00000103"/> be in want of a kind, sincere protector, whilst <emph>I</emph> shall live."</p> 
               <p>"That cursed woman!" exclaimed Ida, "God will Judge her. Away, away, sir; you are hers-not <emph>mine.</emph>"</p> 
               <p>As she spoke these words she rose from the chair, and pushing Andrews violently from her walked towards the door, which she locked and put the key in her pocket. Then turning towards the young man, she cried with an air of triumph, and with a maniac gaze,-"Oh, I have you at last; would I had that Farriday here, that I might despatch you both at once."</p> 
               <p>The young man was greatly alarmed at the lady's manner, and feared she in reality meditated some violence to his person, for it was evident she was quite irresponsible. He, therefore, watched her closely, and whenever he could do so to advantage, he caressed her with kisses. She abused him, however, shamefully; she slapped and also spit in his face, several times.</p> 
               <p>"You are a wretch!" she exclaimed; "you have grossly deceived me; and as for Agnes Farriday, God will yet punish her in the manner she deserves."</p> 
               <p>"Do not talk so loud, Ida, for Heaven's sake," counselled the young man, "or persons on the street will collect about the house, suspicious of some one being murdered."</p> 
               <p>"And let them collect!" shouted Ida, her countenance indicating a mind greatly disturbed, "I <emph>will</emph> speak, whoever hears me. You are a villain, sir-a most hateful <emph>villain,</emph> to prefer a wanton to me; such treatment has driven me mad-mad-mad!"</p> 
               <p>At these wild words, she opened the door and dashed out of the room.</p> 
               <p>"Oh, God!" exclaimed young Andrews, "how incomprehensible thy decrees. Restore, I beseech thee, this unfortunate woman to peace and happiness again-for my sake, for her sake, and for the sake of thy dear Son, Christ, our Lord and Master, who died that we thy wayward creatures might have eternal life!"</p> 
               <p>As he concluded this supplication to Heaven, his whole body trembled with grief, and with an eye of profound sorrow and a cheek blanched with, emotion, he strode slowly from the room, muttering-</p> 
               <p>"What a pang is pride-when humbled."</p>

               <p>ANDREWS rapidly rose at the bar, and Agnes was of great assistance to him, even in the severe, trying duties of his profession. She was a woman of uncommon mental power, with an intellect remarkably subtle and keen, which she delighted to exercise in the vagaries and thin distinctions of law. Her husband had just made another triumph, in a most important civil action, which involved the sum of $100,000. Agnes was overjoyed at his success, as she had aided him in preparing the case.</p> 
               <p>Our hero, though greatly pleased to have won, was altogether unmoved by his success. Indeed, he was never elated at any time; but always calm and of a subdued manner. His remarkable powers as an orator and shrewd lawyer were now generally admitted, and his acquaintance was sought by the first men of the city. He had become a marked man, and was pointed at by those who knew him, as a triumphant genius.</p> 
               <p>One day he chanced to be standing on the corner of a great thoroughfare, where he was engaged in talking with Mr. McAlpin senior, on some law business. Old Penniman happened at that time to pass by, and not observing Mr. Andrews, stopped to shake hands with Mr. McAlpin. The moment his eye caught that of Andrews, his countenance turned pale, and his frame seemed to tremble with passion. The young man met his emotions with a smile, and remarked pleasantly,-</p> 
               <p>"You scarcely ever believed Mr. Penniman, that the musician's son would beat you thus in law,-the son of a fiddler! did you, sir?-Oh, no."</p> 
               <p>"I-I-I-I am not-,"returned Penniman, choking<pb n="206-207" xml:id="VAC6064-00000104"/> with rage. "I have <emph>money</emph> enough, sir, to buy up a dozen such fellows as <emph>you.</emph>"</p> 
               <p>"No, sir, you are mistaken; you have not money enough to buy a finger of me," responded Andrews. "The business of my life, sir, is, not to be bought by, but to serve whenever an opportunity offers, <emph>against</emph> you. You have felt me once-you may feel me <emph>again.</emph> You have yet to learn, sir, that there is something in this world, even <emph>above</emph> wealth."</p> 
               <p>His keen, penetrating, brilliant large eyes, were fixed on old Penniman, as he spoke in his slow marked manner. The old man was quite uneasy, under their glance, and looked in every direction, but into the young man's face. He growled something to the effect, that he did not care a d-n, and passed on towards State Street. But he did care much more than he was willing to concede, for he felt in Andrews he had a <emph>foe,</emph> whom any man might fear; and he knew, too, that he was a foe who would give him no quarter, since he had treated him in a manner calculated to embitter his feelings, and to excite the most determined spirit of revenge.</p> 
               <p>Here was a <foreign xml:lang="FRA">parvenu</foreign> of the first water trembling before the <emph>genius</emph> of a soul he had presumed to cast aside, as too plebeian for his daughter; whilst McAlpin, whom he was only too well pleased to receive as a son-in-law, was a <emph>sot,</emph> a <emph>libertine,</emph> and from whom his wife had threatened to separate. Successful genius on the one hand, calm and confident in its own powers; arrogant worthlessness on the other, with habits formed to the requirements of wine and women.</p> 
               <p>These Pennimans had married, as they thought, their daughter <emph>well,</emph> because the McAlpins were a truly aristocratic family, whilst the Andrews were only mere artists; as though the soul of an artist may not be in every respect as respectable, and as near and dear to the Father of all, as that of a <emph>lawyer</emph> or a <emph>merchant.</emph> But there are hose ever making such mistakes, forgetting that "though many are in high places, and of renown, yet <emph>mysteries</emph> are revealed unto the meek." And again, "extol not thyself in the counsel of thine own heart; that thy soul be not torn in pieces, as a bull straying alone. Thou shalt eat up thy leaves, and lose thy fruit, and leave thyself as a dry tree."</p> 
               <p>Agnes, whom the Pennimans had so much abused, had been received into the society of some of the very best and oldest families, and had been justly admired for her brilliant wit, her gorgeous beauty, and the romance of her life. She was <emph>beloved</emph> as well as <emph>admired.</emph> The reports which had been circulated to her disparagement were no longer credited by those whose privilege it was to meet her in society, and to enjoy her fascinating conversation. Her noble presence-her sweet face in particular-in themselves were a refutation of the base calumnies current. <emph>She</emph> needed no other defenders. It was a question often asked, to what family Agnes Farriday, now Mrs. Andrews, belonged; by no means an uncommon curiosity when one comes prominently before the public.</p> 
               <p>Agnes, as we have said, resided with her mother in a small house opposite to that wherein lodged the beggar, Throckmorton; and it was <emph>here</emph> that Andrews first saw her; nor did he ever forget that intelligent and lovely face. Agnes was the daughter of a Captain Farriday, of <emph>Calcutta,</emph> and of a Mrs. Jane E. Bowman, of <emph>London.</emph> The captain had been wealthy, and was one of the most prominent and respectable families in Calcutta, his father having filled a high post in the English army. Mrs. Bowman was highly connected in London, and had the best blood of England in her veins. Her maiden name was Jane Howard; she married a Mr. Bowman, a wealthy merchant of Calcutta, who died from grief and mortification in consequence of bankruptcy. By him she had three children. Captain Farriday, in the employ of Bowman, fell in love with the widow, and Agnes was the issue of their marriage. After the death of Captain Farriday, his widow with Agnes left Calcutta for London, and was wrecked off the Cape of Good Hope. After several days of suffering, they were picked up floating on a plank, by an American vessel bound for Boston, where they were landed in safety, and in consequence of small means were obliged to live in an humble manner.</p> 
               <p>Agnes, at the age of seventeen lost her mother, just as she was about to go to England. Since when, the daughter<pb n="208-209" xml:id="VAC6064-00000105"/> had been actively engaged up to the period of her acquaintance with Andrews, in administering to the wants of the worthy poor, and in befriending those unfortunate women who had fallen into the vice of prostitution, and tought deliverance from their wretchedness. She labored earnestly in the name of Christ, and her work had been blessed. Many and many a one had reason to love Agnes for the kindness she had shown them. This is in brief the history of the wife of William Andrews, in comparison to which a Nelly Penniman, Julia Touchmenot, (now Mrs. Sampsne, travelling in Europe,) and all such pretensions sink into utter insignificance.</p> 
               <p>On one or two occasions Mr. and Mrs. Andrews had met in society Mrs. Nelly McAlpin, but no recognition passed. The Pennimans were always shy of Andrews at all times, and in all places, and they shrunk from a comparison of that splendid couple, with the sot McAlpin and his haggard wife. Nelly, although she did not permit Mr. Andrews to catch her eye, frequently looked at him most tenderly, for she loved him dearly, and ever had an affection for him,-she felt not for any other man.</p> 
               <p>Agnes with her quick eye and penetrating intellect, detected this interest on the part of Mrs. McAlpin for her husband; but she was not jealous; the feeling was rather one of <emph>pity</emph> than of jealousy. Nelly hated Agnes as she loved her noble husband, with whom every one was charmed, for his manners were so frank, and his smile so soft and sweet, he conquered even the malignity of his enemies. Even Mrs. Penniman was compelled to admit the elegance of his address; so too were all others who had been his traducers. He stood a monarch among them, and <emph>compelled</emph> respect; he had at last o'ertopp'd snobbery, and borne it down like a reed, having literally fulfilled the charge of his father, "to let his virtues be his revenge."</p>

               <p>THE Pennimans, who for a long time had held their heads excessively, and we may add, insufferably high, were moderating their proud and offensive spirit most materially; and certainly if a family ever had cause to feel abashed, it was the Pennimans, with their worthless sons-in-law, whom they had been to a great deal of pains to secure, three of whom were <emph>bar-room sots,</emph> and horse jockeys, without the least influence among reputable citizens. Such were the sons-in-law of Mrs. Penniman, who had been to so much trouble to marry her daughters into the first families-none but the <emph>very first young men would</emph> satisfy <emph>her</emph> ambition. Whereas, William Andrews, with his fine prospects for fame, and his already enviable reputation as a lawyer, together with the attention he received on all sides, was a pattern of virtue! All his relations with life were honorable and successful. Nothing so illaffected Mrs. Penniman as <emph>this.</emph> And to see, too, "a common woman," as she termed Agnes, rise into favor, so far beyond any consideration <emph>her</emph> daughters had enjoyed, was an additional sorrow which so preyed upon her mind, that the hairs of her head were fast turning gray, and her features hard and hateful. It was customary for Mrs. Penniman to put on a great many airs, and when in company to assume a peculiarity of manner which is intended to convey the idea of <emph>aristocracy;</emph> but Mrs. Penniman had strangely altered in this regard, and her mind seemed occupied with something else less pleasing than one's consequence-something that was most bitter, and dashed her spirits. She felt she had not attained what she had struggled with all her energies to acquire, viz., high position<pb n="210-211" xml:id="VAC6064-00000106"/> tion for her children. She had married them, it is true, to the "<emph>first young men,</emph>" but it unfortunately turned out that they were first in the opinion of no person whose opinion was worth having; and now alas! she had been made sensible of this when <emph>too late</emph> to remedy the error, and the evil.</p> 
               <p>It was evening;-the drawing-room of the Pennimans was brilliantly lighted. Mrs. McAlpin sat at the piano, playing that exquisite piece, "The heart bowed down by weight of woe," when Mrs. Donothing entered, looking very much disconcerted and extremely pale. She immediately burst into tears.</p> 
               <p>"Why, Susy, what is the matter; what is the matter with you!" exclaimed Nelly. "Another nervous attack? One would think you had lost all your friends."</p> 
               <p>"And so I have," bawled Mrs. Donothing. "I don't think I've one true friend in the world."</p> 
               <p>"Why, how foolish," returned Nelly, "you certainly have a friend in your husband, if in no one else."</p> 
               <p>"He a friend," exclaimed Mrs. Donothing,-"a pretty friend, to be sure; I've just been obliged to leave the house in consequence of his abuse. He is most all the time under the excitement of wine, and I get from him more ill-nature than I can stand."</p> 
               <p>"Oh, you are green; I see where the trouble is," responded Nelly. "He is no worse a case than McAlpin, yet I manage to get along with him in peace, though I must say he is a great trial-at times it is just about as much as I can do to keep the track. My rule is never to reprove him when he is 'out of sorts,' but to put it on early in the morning, when he first awakes; that's the time for a wife to make herself felt-to be of any influence over a gay and headstrong husband. Mark me, Susy, I tell you I am right."</p> 
               <p>"Well, I suppose you are," rejoined Mrs. Donothing, weeping pitifully; "but I am so nervous and completely broken down by that man's dissipation, I dont know half the time what I am about. I shall never be a healthy woman again.</p> 
               <p>"Never mind, Sue, never mind, make the best of it," rejoined Nelly. "You don't have a much harder time with Jerry than I do with Jim. The fact is, high life is in the McAlpin family; his uncle died of too much liquor. James has worn me down to a mere shadow; my dresses once too small for me are now too loose; this you see is evidence that I have lost flesh."</p> 
               <p>"Who would not lose flesh with two such trials," said Mrs. Donothing. "If <emph>I</emph> have not suffered enough in this world, I should like to know who has. And yet people <emph>envy</emph> us."</p> 
               <p>"Oh, yes, there are plenty of girls who would be perfectly willing to take our hard husbands with our houses," replied Nelly, bitterly. "I tell you we are thought to be most favored by fortune, tough as we may think our lot."</p> 
               <p>"I am sure I don't know who there can be so <emph>base</emph> as to envy <emph>us,</emph> knowing what we have to endure from our husbands," replied Mrs. Donothing.</p> 
               <p>"Oh, but you see, they don't exactly know," rejoined Nelly, "and if they did, I am not sure it would make any difference with them; they think so much of style, the fools! How different everything has turned out from what we expected. There's Andrews, how he has come up; and Agnes Farriday, only think of <emph>such</emph> a woman, receiving the attention that she does from our <emph>very best families.</emph> Persons who would never have thought of noticing them two years ago, now can't do half enough for them. There are the Yellowbodies, for instance, and the Inconceivables, the Blowhards, and numbers of others, both of and not of our set, who think there is nobody so charming as Mr. Andrews, and Agnes his wife."</p> 
               <p>"It is the way the world goes, I find," replied Mrs. Donothing, "which I suppose we must go along with whether we will or no."</p> 
               <p>"For my part," returned Nelly, "I'll be hanged if I don't keep up with the times. James is in a consumption, and can't live a great while longer; if ever I get caught by a fast young man again, I will give you and all others leave to laugh at me as much as you please."</p> 
               <p>"The probability is you will be laughed at without leave," rejoined Mrs. Donothing, "but there is husband at home, tight as he can be, and what to do I know not. The servants won't do a thing for him; and he is so mad with me, I am afraid to go near him."</p> 
               <pb n="212-213" xml:id="VAC6064-00000107"/> 
               <p>"Come, I will go with you," returned Mrs. McAlpin; "I was waiting here for mother, who is calling on one of the neighbors. I want to see her very much; but I will go home with you and then return, or, if it should be too late, I can come around to-morrow.</p> 
               <p>"Do come with me, Nelly; I am so nervous, I dare not return alone. You don't know how nervous I am, my brain is tremulous, and my ideas are in a state of confusion."</p> 
               <p>"Certainly I will go with you. I think both of us can manage him. Oh! headstrong husbands,-what a perfect bore they are."</p> 
               <p>Nelly put on her bonnet and shawl and hastened with her sister, Mrs. Donothing, to her home. They had been gone only a few minutes when Mr. and Mrs. Penniman came into the house. They had changed materially in their appearance since we first presented them to the reader. Old Penniman had grown thinner and his face was even more repulsive than formerly; it was as hard as a stone, and sour as vinegar. There was not a ray of humanity in it; had Mrs. Penniman likewise had a visage, which gave the impression of a soul destitute of all the nobler sentiments. Penniman had lost a great deal of money lately in various ways, and this, together with the conduct of his sons-in-law, who spent large sums of money without earning a dollar, kept his mind in a state of constant worriment. And then, too, he could not divest it of the notion that he would die <emph>poor.</emph> This was ever present to him, when he awoke and when he laid down to sleep. His wife did all she could to dispossess him of such an idea, but in vain; he harped the more on it, the more she endeavored to calm his mind.</p> 
               <p>The truth is, this old Shylock as well as his wife and children, had been living without God in the world, and they were, therefore, without the consolation the Bible affords those who believe in and make it a <emph>rule</emph> of action. "That peace of mind which passeth all understanding," they knew nothing of; indeed, they had no conception of such happiness.</p> 
               <p>"Well, dear," said Mrs. Penniman, who had seated herself in a rocking chair, "I can't help it, if you will keep up this incessant talk about our coming to poverty, to poverty I suppose we must go; but really, it is a disease, my dear, you ought to strive to overcome it. Only think how you would be laughed at by all our friends, if they knew of your talk."</p> 
               <p>"Friends? eh! we've got no friends," muttered old Penniman, from between his teeth;"no-no friends! And as to our sons-in-law, whom you were so anxious to secure for our girls, why, they are our worst enemies! d-n them! they've disgraced themselves and us. Think-only think, what a match Nelly and Andrews would have been; why that young man will go to Congress yet; he will be one of the first statesmen in the country."</p> 
               <p>"Well, my dear, it was impossible for me to have foreseen what he would come to," rejoined Mrs. Penniman; "who ever thought of his being a successful lawyer-whoever thought of such a thing; you know how plebeian his family, in comparison to McAlpin's."</p> 
               <p>"D-n all such notions! I am getting tired of them," exclaimed Mr. Penniman. "It is <emph>my</emph> opinion that a smart young man is always of the highest respectability. You knew very well that Andrews was unusually smart, for I have heard you say so."</p> 
               <p>"That is all very true," replied Mrs. Penniman; "I can't, however, endure plebeians, no matter how smart they may be. I want none but the best born people connected with <emph>me.</emph>"</p> 
               <p>"Well, I have only to say such are devilish expensive people," replied the husband; "and much more fond of squandering away time, than being honestly and profitably employed."</p> 
               <p>"And how long since you found that out, pray?" interrogated Mrs. Penniman sarcastically. "You have come down a good deal in your tone of late." "It will be well for us, if we have a house over our heads in six months," rejoined the husband, sharply.</p> 
               <p>"Nonsense! what a fool you are," returned the wife, evidently disturbed at the remark. "You are the greatest fool I know of. If we had all the wealth of the Rothschilds, you would forever be talking about coming to want. Don't-don't, for Godsake, be so blue, continually;<pb n="214-215" xml:id="VAC6064-00000108"/> I shall get to be as bad as yourself, if you persist in this gloomy mood. Come, get up, and go off to the club. Here, take your hat, and go either there, or to the theatre-go somewhere for a laugh, if it's at a dance-house on the hill. Do, when you come home, bring with you a smile."</p> 
               <p>Old Penniman took his hat, and giving the vinegar visage of his wife a brush with his hand playfully, passed out into the street, and thence made his way to the clubroom, where he seated himself at whist with a party who were as wealthy and miserable as himself. Mrs. Penniman was about to retire to her bed-chamber, when the door-bell rang, and a party consisting of Mrs. Catchpenny, Mrs. Touchmenot, and the Blowhards, entered the house. The Catchpennys and Touchmenots, though for a time estranged by young Andrews' wit, had come again to terms of amity. Mrs. Penniman was not a little vexed at their visit, as she was in no very pleasant frame of mind.</p> 
               <p>"Really, Mrs. Penniman, I was charmed last night at the opera," said Mrs. Touchmenot, with a toss of the head; "quite charmed; wasn't you, Mrs. Penniman?"</p> 
               <p>"No, I can't say that I was;" replied Mrs. Penniman, "for my head felt the whole time as though it would burst."</p> 
               <p>"Oh, I regret that exceedingly, my dear Mrs. Penniman," said Mrs. Catchpenny. "You do not this evening appear at all well. I suppose the losses of your husband distresses you."</p> 
               <p>"The losses of my husband!" reiterated Mrs. Penniman. "Why what do you mean?"</p> 
               <p>"We met Mr. Gaseous as we came along, and he informed us that some one informed him that your husband had lost heavily, and that his credit would suffer seriously at the Banks, and in fact, <emph>everywhere.</emph>"</p> 
               <p>"Well," replied Mrs. Penniman, "I am quite reconciled to God's will in all things-at least I try to be. But of this I know nothing at all-our vile enemies are at work-it is all lies-lies-lies-and who is not lied about of any pretensions whatever-above the rabble, the dirty rabble!"</p> 
               <p>"That's just <emph>my</emph> feeling, precisely," said Mrs. Touchmenot menot; "The rabble, the rabble-how I despise it! nasty, dirty, filthy beasts."</p> 
               <p>Mrs. Touchmenot was a coarse, vulgar woman, whose daughter Julia, as we have already related, was in Europe with her husband, having a "delightful time," as she informed her mother in her letters. Mrs. Touchmenot had now in Europe three children, of whom she was constantly talking. These children had gone abroad under the impression that they were uncommon characters, and so, indeed, they were-of uncommon weakness. Unfortunately for the reputation of the U. S., there are altogether too many of these characters in Europe, on money they do not know the value of, and could not <emph>earn,</emph> however great their opportunities!</p> 
               <p>"Have you heard lately from your daughter, Mrs. Touchmenot?" inquired Mrs. Penniman.</p> 
               <p>"Oh, yes-why yes," responded Mrs. Touchmenot, "Why bless your soul, we get letters quite often. Julia writes in fine spirits; she says her husband is called the handsomest American in Italy. Some celebrated painter at Rome has requested him to sit for his portrait-for <emph>half</emph> the price he would charge <emph>all others.</emph> We think this a great compliment, a very great honor, indeed, Mrs. Penniman; for you must know, at Rome, a great artist does a great thing, when he works for <emph>half</emph> price. Sampsne is to be painted in full, in his dressing gown and slippers, with his neck bare, that the head may appear to the best advantage. I have a place already selected in my house to put it."</p> 
               <p>"I hope when it is sent home," remarked Miss Fanny Catchpenny, "some one will pack it who knows his business, so that it may not arrive in the plight of Mr. Quiddle's statuary-entirely ruined! in consequence of his having thought it not worth while to be at the expense of a pack-man."</p> 
               <p>"Mr. Quiddle is one of your penny wise and pound foolish gentlemen," returned Mrs. Touchmenot, with a good deal of affected dignity, "after whom <emph>my</emph> son <emph>will not pattern;</emph> you may be assured of that. My son, Miss Fanny, is a thorough going <emph>business</emph> man, and knows what is what, if he does lay abed late in the morning."</p> 
               <pb n="216-217" xml:id="VAC6064-00000109"/> 
               <p>"Oh, we know that, Mrs. Touchmenot," replied Mrs. Catchpenny,-"We know that perfectly well. Mr. Sampsne could not possibly make any such mistake as Mr. Quiddle committed. Did you ever hear any one say that Mr. Andrews resembled your son?"</p> 
               <p>"What, that brute resemble my son?" exclaimed Mrs. Touchmenot, her eyes dilating and her whole appearance indicating great indignation. "I'd burn him alive if I thought so. I have not forgotten his infamous conduct-the brute."</p> 
               <p>"Don't, I beg of you, take offence Mrs. Touchmenot," said Mrs. Catchpenny, "at my words. I assure you Mr. Andrews is thought a splendid looking man by <emph>everybody.</emph> And you know how much attention he receives from our first people-how much admired his wife is who speaks three languages, and is one of the most fascinating women in society that we have had for many a day."</p> 
               <p>"Well, all this don't raise them in <emph>my</emph> estimation a peg," returned Mrs. Touchmenot. "They are the same <emph>dirt</emph> to me <emph>now,</emph> as ever."</p> 
               <p>"So they are to <emph>me,</emph>" said Mrs. Penniman, with evident satisfaction.</p> 
               <p>Both Mrs. Touchmenot and Mrs. Penniman were a good deal excited, which Mrs. Catchpenny observing, endeavored to turn the conversation; and after some good management succeeded in restoring a quiet state of temper. From one subject they passed to another, abusing soundly the Atlays, and a number of others not of their set. In particular did the Atlays receive from the Catchpennys a severe broadside, in consequence of Lucy's success in fascinating Augustus Hamilton, for whom Miss Fanny Catchpenny, in common with a number of other young ladies, had "set their caps."</p> 
               <p>Lucy Atlay was bitterly envied by the Catchpennys, and, indeed, by very many others, who had predicted her destiny to be that of old maidenhood; <emph>she</emph> would never get a husband, they thought-"a conceited blue-stocking!" The Inconceivables disliked her particularly because she spoke French; and thought any man who would marry her, a fool! The Catchpennys were quite mistaken, as numerous others of their character have been mistaken, in their calculations, as to the chances of marriage of those women, who, instead of putting themselves in the <emph>way</emph> of beaux, rather shrink from such boldness, never forgetting that <emph>true</emph> men-men who are worth being wedded to, prefer to be at some trouble to find a modest and unpresuming lady, than to have ready at hand a forward and wanton one.</p> 
               <p>Miss Laura Catchpenny had a great deal to say about Mr. James McAlpin, "handsome Jimmy." She went even so far as to declare that he was a great favorite of hers, and had offered himself to her previous to proposing to Miss Penniman. This was a cutting statement to the ears of Mrs. Penniman, nor would she allow herself to believe one word of it; indeed, her pride was so much shocked, at her daughter taking up with a fellow whom the Catchpennys had declined, that she said to Miss Catchpenny, evidently much excited, that her story could not be true; that there must be some mistake. Miss Catchpenny declared that there was no mistake, and was surprised at Mrs. Penniman's incivility. Mrs. Catchpenny likewise, said, that she had never in all her life before received such treatment; as she considered any insult offered her daughter as personal to herself. Words, and hot words flew fast from one to the other, until things came to such a pass, that the Catchpennys left the house in a violent passion, declaring their acquaintance with the Pennimans, whom they always regarded as vulgar people, was now and <emph>forever</emph> at an end.</p> 
               <p>As the Catchpennys were no particular favorites of the company who remained, they now readily sympathized with Mrs. Penniman, and gave it as their opinion that Nelly was James' first and only love. This tended greatly to soothe the feelings of Mrs. Penniman, who had not for a great length of time been so much disturbed, as on this present occasion. There were few terms she could think of strong enough to express her contempt for these "vulgar Catchpennys,"whom, she said, were envious of everybody who appeared to enjoy life more than themselves. Indeed, she ran on at a rapid and fearful rate against this family, whose acquaintance she said she always regretted having made, because she knew them to be of<pb n="218-219" xml:id="VAC6064-00000110"/> "bad breed." The company joined her in all she said; indeed, Mrs. Blowhard was unsparing of her condemnation.</p> 
               <p>While matters were in this state of fusion, in walked Gaseous, very much like a dancing-master, and quite as though he trod on hot irons. At the sight of this "adorable" sweet sir, the company seemed well pleased, for he was somewhat of a favorite, having continued to make himself agreeable with his sailor yarns, and his any quantity of gas. He was unquestionably one of the most <emph>gaseous</emph> upstarts of the city, and perhaps no man walked the streets with an air so impudent, and a head so crammed with self-esteem. The truth is, he had been spoiled by a class of persons who took him up by force of his assurance, and feasted him until he fairly grew weary of attention, and wondered what these "fools wanted of him."</p> 
               <p>He was not slow to join Mrs. Penniman against the Catchpennys, whom he denounced as excessively coarse people. He had of late heard it rumored, that Mr. Penniman had met with great losses in railroad stock, bank stock, and in merchandise; but the general opinion seemed to be, that he was solvent, though by no means a wealthy man. Mrs. Penniman had been informed of some of these rumors, and although she knew her husband had made heavy losses, she considered herself quite able to keep, and to ride in her carriage; and this privilege she intended to enjoy as long as possible. Gaseous was one of those men who talk at random, and consequently, much of the time, talked ridiculously; but "his set," generally speaking, were pleased with his gabble, and thought him an exceedingly entertaining person. In fact this fellow believed himself to be an Apollo! and availed of all that art could do to make him acceptable to the fair sex. Much, however, as he was admired, a great deal of fun was poked at him in a sly way, of which he was not aware. There were sensible and witty women now and then with whom he would come in contact, who, seeing at once into his absurdities, laughed heartily in their sleeves.</p> 
               <p>Mrs. Penniman and her friends having exhausted all they had to say uncomplimentary of the Catchpennys, and of several other families, whom they believed had little or no respect for them, partook of some cake and wine, when Mrs. Touchmenot was informed her carriage was at the door. She had had rather an exciting evening, and the blood had so freely flowed to the head, that her face was red as a coal. Gaseous waited upon the ladies to the carriage, and having played the footman to perfection, returned to the drawing room of Mrs. Penniman, whom he found reclining on the sofa, complaining of a severe headache. He bound her head with a napkin wet with ice water, and putting his arm about her waist pressed her tenderly, with a sigh for her beating temples. We do not think she had had such a pressure for a long time. By his gracious manner he came into great favor with all classes of women, and was thought to be an exceedingly clever man. On the evening of which we write, he had Mrs. Penniman most tenderly by the hand, and appeared to be fondling her very much in the manner of a husband. The drawing room doors were shut, the curtains were down, and the opportunity for a <emph>love scrape</emph> was exceedingly fine. Mrs. Penniman, notwithstanding her indisposition, notwithstanding her quarrel with Mrs. Catchpenny, was in prime condition for anything that might happen. She kissed Gaseous with a degree of fervor, hardly equalled by youth's hot blood, and seemed to enjoy his presence exceedingly, as much, if not more than she ever did her husband's. Whilst, however, they were in this most interesting situation, who should pop his head into the room, but old Penniman. He had entered the house in his usual soft manner, and going up stairs with his light tread, had made the most surprising discovery of his long life-his wife with her lips close pressed to those of Gaseous!</p> 
               <p>Old Penniman had been for some time in a most unhappy state of mind in consequence of his losses, and the worthless character of his sons-in-law; and now that he had detected his wife in such familiarity with a libertine, (for Gaseous was generally regarded as such) he was overwhelmed with sadness, and at once passed down stairs and out of the house, determined never to live with his wife again, muttering:</p> 
               <pb n="220-221" xml:id="VAC6064-00000111"/> 
               <p>"Frailty, thy name is woman. Go to the theatre, eh, anywhere for a laugh-come home with a smile; oh, the wretch!"</p> 
               <p>Mrs. Penniman and Gaseous stood amazed-their hands trembling as they clasped each other.</p>

               <p>IDA ROBERTSON with whom Andrews was closeted, and who rushed wildly from his presence, he found as he passed into the entry below, reclining on a sofa apparently unconscious. He fell upon his knee beside her, and removing from her tear-washed cheeks the hair which veiled them, he drew from his pocket a snowy white handkerchief and wiped her face. He then spoke softly to her, and kissed her firmly set lips. In a few moments she turned, took his hand and pressed it closely to her wan lips, at the same time making an effort to speak; after some little delay she said, in the most inaudible manner:</p> 
               <p>"Oh, sir, would I could ever hold your hand in mine-it is so warm, and firm."</p> 
               <p>Overpowered by this declaration, coupled with the stricken form of Miss Robertson, which never appeared to him so lovely as now, as it lay stretched upon the sofa, the young man lamented that he had ever been born. He laid his head upon her bosom and wept vehemently.</p> 
               <p>"Oh, God!" he exclaimed, after recovering somewhat from his sorrow, "how mysterious are thy ways. Thus to suffer as I do is worse than a thousand deaths, but thanks, oh thanks kind father, gracious God, that it is written, 'despise not the chastening of the Lord, neither faint when thou art rebuked of him; for whom the Lord loveth he chasteneth, and scourgeth every son whom he receiveth; for our light afflictions, which are but for a moment, work out for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory.' Ida-Ida this is the saddest hour of my life."</p> 
               <pb n="222-223" xml:id="VAC6064-00000112"/> 
               <p>He gazed at her; she spoke not a word; but the tears ran down her cheeks, and told of a heart stricken by the power of disappointed pride, and wounded vanity. Our hero, although entirely unconscious of any blame which could possibly attach to him in the matter of Ida's unfortunate situation, nevertheless grieved as much as though he were the sole cause of all her sufferings, the lamentable condition to which she was now reduced. It was a pitiful picture, that of Ida stretched upon the sofa, with the hand of death upon her, and the manly form of Andrews bent over her faintly beating bosom, whose hopes in him were so much greater than he had ever supposed, or encouraged it to cherish. On the contrary, he had persistently discouraged all expectation of his heart and hand, and early explained to the lady the precise state of his feelings. He supposed then that there was an end to all hope, especially after her neglect consequent on his dismissal from the firm of Catchpenny &amp; Co.-and indeed there was. She appeared to regard the matter in this light; and always met him as she would any other particular and valued friend. She mingled constantly in society, and was quite attractive, receiving a good deal of attention from the gentlemen: she was twice engaged, but dismissed her suitors, when she saw the genius of Andrews developing so strikingly. Her thoughts began now to be of him, more than of all other men. No one could understand her conduct; as she was far too proud to let the world know how well she loved a man who could not become interested in her. From Andrews in particular, she took especial pains to conceal her intense desires, and was so successful, that he never for a moment thought she had more than a sisterly regard for him. But no sooner had he promised marriage to another, than this pent up passion she had nursed so long, with its hopes and, fears, burst its imprisonment, and beset young. Andrews with all the fury of despair. He could not, nor he would not yield to it; for he had found a woman adapted to his plans and character, whom to discard would be to tear himself apart; and blast a future in which he had many hopes laid up, not the least of which was his triumph over assumption. With Ida he might not be able to advance, with Agnes he <emph>would carry all before him.</emph> Which of the two to choose it was not difficult for him to determine; and although it sorrowed his heart to disappoint Ida, still it seemed to be an imperative duty he owed himself, to work out his own destiny in the most direct manner, and by the most approved and certain means. He appreciated Ida's feelings; but he had resolved adverse to her love-it could not support him; besides it was sensual! and in marked contrast with the pure spirituality of Agnes. There are very many who cannot distinguish between a sensual and spiritual love; and laugh immoderately at "those fools" who make a distinction. To love with many is merely to feel a desire to cohabit with each other, to share in each other's joys and sorrows, and to be true until death them does part; but there is a grossness to this sentiment from which a purely spiritual love is free. It was not so much the desire to cohabit together on the part of Andrews and Agnes, as it was the wish to interlock their minds, and to be of one spirit, strong in mutuality of interest, of aims, and hopes, and developing their faculties to the utmost bounds of their stretch, in view of eternal progression.</p> 
               <p>The young man, as we have said, bent over the bosom of Ida, oppressed with a grief he had never until now experienced; the grief of beholding one prostrate from an excess of passion by him excited, and which she could not control. His hand was clasped in hers, and his head yet rested on Ida's bosom, which was broad and full.</p> 
               <p>"Ah, sir, you little know the pangs here, here," and thereupon she raised her disengaged hand to place it at her breast, but only partially succeeded. "My life," she continued, "has been most sad and dreary; with many bright and cheerful hopes, I may say that I have not realized <emph>one.</emph> When I think of those happy days of our youth, when we conversed so freely together, and believed we yet might wed, I am overwhelmed with grief."</p> 
               <p>"Then do not think of the past," rejoined Andrews pitifully. "Blot it from your memory; think only of the future, and yet hope to be happy."</p> 
               <p>"Of the future-yes," responded Ida. "'Tis much I think of it-of that home beyond the grave, where soon I shall be installed."</p> 
               <pb n="224-225" xml:id="VAC6064-00000113"/> 
               <p>"Oh, do not be so hopeless of life," rejoined Andrews. "You will recover from this attack, and many years of enviable felicity may yet be yours."</p> 
               <p>"Enviable!" reiterated Ida, as she raised her eyes to those of Andrews. "Enviable; ah, sir," and with these words the tears rolled copiously down her cheeks. "Who envies me, in aught I may have of joy on this earth, with <emph>you</emph> wedded to <emph>another,</emph> must be indeed bankrupt of every pleasure. No, I do not wish to live; I feel I <emph>cannot;</emph> and I am content to die. When I am beneath the sod, sometimes you may think of me; and sometimes you may remember, although I had my faults, I ever wished <emph>you</emph> well."</p> 
               <p>She seemed at this moment to be greatly exhausted; her eyes were loosely closed, and her breathing short and difficult.</p> 
               <p>"Air, air," she faintly whispered. "I am dying-air-air."</p> 
               <p>The young man threw up the window, and unloosed about her bosom and waist the dress she had arranged upon her person with so much taste. Relief was at once afforded, and she revived so as to resume conversation.</p> 
               <p>"Ah, sir, why could you not have overlooked in me a girlish folly; why could you not have forgiven a slight?"</p> 
               <p>"I forgave it all-willingly, freely forgave," replied Andrews. "But I did not, could not <emph>forget.</emph>"</p> 
               <p>"Why, oh, why did you, of all women on earth, make choice of such a creature as Agnes Farriday?" returned Ida. "A woman about whom so many prejudicial reports are rife. Forget, ah, who will ever forget such taste as yours. If you cannot forget <emph>my</emph> faults, neither can I forget <emph>your</emph> infatuation!"</p> 
               <p>"Ah," replied the young man. "You decieve yourself-you know not what you say-she whom you despise, was sent to me by Heaven."</p> 
               <p>"Infatuated man!" rejoined Ida. "Time may yet cure you of your folly. <emph>I</emph> shall not live to see it, but that hour may come when you will wish to <emph>undo</emph> much that you have <emph>done.</emph> I would it were possible for me to live, to witness these scales fall from your eyes, and your delivery from this fatal delusion accomplished. I would it might be my mission to rescue you from this condition; then you would, perhaps, think better of me, and forget as well as forgive my errors. That I am faulty I know; and what woman is not? Who of all their number in any of their rank, can say, towards man they are always, <emph>at all times,</emph> 
                  <emph>and under all circumstances,</emph> perfectly candid and sincere? Not one! if she has wit and contrivance, if she plays the game of life to win, as it is taught by the sophisticated and refined."</p> 
               <p>"I cannot dispute the correctness of your remarks, in general, but in some particulars I know you are wrong," rejoined Andrews, as he gazed tenderly at the pallid features of Ida.</p> 
               <p>"You would except Agnes, of course," responded Ida. "O, how I wish you could see her as <emph>I</emph> do."</p> 
               <p>"If I saw her as <emph>you</emph> do, I am sure she would not seem lovely," returned the young man. "For with eyes that see deformity in all they may not, or do not wish to cherish, but little oftentimes is pleasing."</p> 
               <p>"Infatuated man! farewell," responded Ida. "If Agnes Farriday is indeed your <emph>idol,</emph> your sole and <emph>only</emph> love, I pray you may be happy with her; and when I am dead, as soon I shall be, think of me as one who would have you enjoy all the world can bestow of peace and pleasure. Ah, who knows my heart, but God! Oh, oh,-I am so faint, so weak-so-ah. I think this must be death, yes, yes; it is-it is; hold fast my hand, and now that I press it to my bosom-know that I am <emph>poisoned;</emph> that I die, alone for <emph>you.</emph> When in my laughing girlhood, careless and happy as then I was, I secretly vowed never to outlive your wedding day, if it made <emph>us</emph> not <emph>one</emph>-true to that vow, I have taken that within, which no drug can antidote. Andrews, I must die-and you, ah-you-you-you-the cause! Oh-ah-it works so slow-but sure-<emph>sure.</emph> Agnes Farri-here-away-away woman. Ah, sweet sir, she is your love-yes-yes-<emph>your</emph> love-not mine, no, no, not mine, not <emph>mine.</emph>" Her frame was much convulsed, as she continued: "Oh, think of me <emph>sometimes,</emph> sweet sir, and bury me-near-where you-you-shall lie."</p> 
               <p>With these words the death rattle followed, and she ceased to breathe.</p> 
               <pb n="226-227" xml:id="VAC6064-00000114"/> 
               <p>"Dead," murmured Andrews. "And I-I-the cause. Oh God-oh God! But no, I'll not give way to sorrow, for all is well. Thy decrees, kind Heaven, I <emph>will</emph> believe, are <emph>just!</emph>"</p> 
               <p>He kissed the cold brow and bloodless lips of Ida, and then folding his hands in prayer, addressed himself to God in these words: "Father, thy will be done. It is not for man to say what that will shall be, but to accept it thankfully, and submissively, taking to his bosom thy mysterious providences as blessings in disguise. Wilt thou receive into thy charge this woman, who has fallen a victim to the ungoverned passions of her nature, and who has laid violent hands on her own life. O forgive me,-the innocent cause of her sad end! Thou knowest, of Father, all hearts, judge Thou mine."</p> 
               <p>He remained for a few moments spell-bound by the side of Ida, gazing at her pulseless brow, and apparently in deep abstraction-repeatedly saying in tones nearly inaudible,-"I-the cause-poison-poison." Ida was, as we have said, generally known in society, and there were many who entertained for her a sincere respect. She was connected with a number of <emph>charities,</emph> and many has been the time when her purse has furnished the worthy beggar with raiment, food, and fire. The news of her death was received with pain, and at her burial two days subsequent to her demise, many persons of mark were in attendance. Young Andrews, faithful to her request, had her body deposited in the grounds where he would be entombed, and a neat marble monument was placed to her memory, thus inscribed: <q>

               <p>OUR hero had never been touched before so harshly by the hand of sorrow, as he was by the death of Ida; for he could not but know it was her mortification and disappointment which his ardent love for Agnes Farriday had occasioned, which induced her to take her own life. He did not believe she destroyed herself, because of her "unrequited love," for Ida was not a woman to love so deeply, but her vanity was in the extreme. She had schooled herself to think, notwithstanding the young man's cautious intercourse with her, that she was indispensable to his happiness, and that eventually they would be joined together in the holy bonds of wedlock, provided <emph>she</emph> continued to regard such a consummation as <emph>desirable.</emph> When, therefore, Agnes Farriday interposed to dash all this bright and cherished future away, she was agitated in a degree never before experienced. "A courtezan," she would constantly mutter to herself, "a vile, shameless woman, thus to be preferred to me! <emph>I</emph> who have known him from boyhood, who have so often kissed him, and mended his garments when torn-to desert me, at a time of life, too, when marriage is so much more a matter of interest than in our earlier years-Oh, it is shameful!" And this was the burden of her thoughts, from the young man's engagement to the moment of her death.</p> 
               <p>The Catchpennys alone, of all the Penniman set, indeed, of all the circle in which Ida was known, were pleased to say of this misguided woman, that if she had had more brains she would have had more self-control: to kill herself for such an upstart as this William Andrews was certainly one of her weakest points. They laughed and joked over the circumstance as though but<pb n="228-229" xml:id="VAC6064-00000115"/> an incident of a play, and they thought she might have made her death much more tragic, by using a dagger instead of <emph>poison.</emph> But the Catchpenneys had failed; they were mortified and reckless. They had been "dropped" by nearly all of those with whom they had been on terms of intimacy, when reputed "to be persons of wealth." Mrs. Touchmenot was particularly cool towards them, for she had never forgotten that it was "at the tea-table of these mushroons, that she had witnessed the greatest exhibition of vulgarity she had ever seen either on or off of the stage." She abused them at every opportunity which offered, declaring, that whoever was either directly or indirectly concerned, whether intentionally or not, in <emph>her</emph> discomforture, she hated and despised.</p> 
               <p>Her daughter Julia was equally hostile to the Catch-pennys, and only wondered how she ever came to find any pleasure, whatever, in the society of <emph>such</emph> people. She thought the metaphysicians had yet much to explain, to make clear why it is, persons who are really <emph>worthless,</emph> should at <emph>any</emph> time, and under <emph>any</emph> circumstances, appear otherwise, passing themselves off for metal which has the real ring, when they are nothing but pewter. And there was much else she could not understand, but she was exceedingly careful to say nothing about it. She had married, not for love, but for pleasure and convenience, Mr. Sampsne,-not plain Anglo-Saxon Sampson, because such a pronunciation of that word would be in <emph>common</emph> usage, and as the Touchmenots would be thought persons of <emph>thorough</emph> quality, they deemed it indispensable that they should give a foreign air both to the name and manners of their "exquisitely formed son-in-law." So they sent him to Europe with his "dashing wife," with not a cent in his pocket which he had ever earned, or could earn. He travelled on his whiskers, his splendid form, his unblushing impudence, and the purse of old Touchmenot, whose face was as hard, as the hoofs of his elegant pair of horses, which dragged around the city, and through the adjacent country, the incomparable flesh of his bloated and high-tempered, illiterate, savage-countenanced spouse-who waddled up and down her high <unclear>stone</unclear> steps, as though the effort was too much for her.</p> 
                
               <p>The letters came thick and fast from Mrs. Sampsne, unto her "dear darling mother," who "quite lost her usually good spirits, when Julia omitted to write her from every point of Europe which she visited." She watched the progress of her children from city to city, from town to town, from lake to lake, and declared to her acquaintances she had never in all her life before, taken so closely to the darling map of <emph>Europe</emph>-she thought Europe was "perfectly splendid," and only wondered why the "fair haired Germans, did not at a much earlier period, cut their way to its Southern, delightfully sunny shores." This was a quotation from one of the letters she had lately received from Julia, who was at its date at Salamanca, in Spain; but Mrs. Touchmenot used the language and ideas as her own; for she considered, she had done <emph>so much</emph> for her children, that they could <emph>never</emph> do too much for <emph>her.</emph> As a specimen of Mrs., or rather <foreign xml:lang="FRA">Madame</foreign> Sampsne's style of letter writing, we present the following, which was picked up on one of the thoroughfares of the city, it having dropped, as is supposed, from old Penniman's pocket, as he was constantly jerking from it a dirty bandana handkerchief, with which he wiped his ungainly looking, though active nose. Of all the men in the metropolis, for a <emph>rich</emph> one, he was, without exception, the most contemptible, vulgar looking individual, to be at any time observed on the streets. He walked with the air of a <emph>miser,</emph> and his head and neck, which were always pitched forward, projected quite noticeably from the line of his stomach, that never, at any time, appeared to be any too well supplied with the necessaries of life. It was said he was always talking to his wife about the shameful and enormous appetites of those composing his household. Towards the cook, especially, he bore a strong aversion; for, as he declared, "he never passed through the kitchen when that <emph>gluttonous</emph> thing was not feeding herself and the butler and maids with dainties." He had frequently given Mrs. Touchmenot orders "to dismiss the wretch," but she respectfully declined, saying, "that if <emph>Bessy,</emph> who had lived with them so long, and whose cooking they liked so well, and who was so neat and clean, was sent away,<pb n="230-231" xml:id="VAC6064-00000116"/> she would likewise leave the house." This was always a "dead shot" at Mr. Touchmenot; for whenever his wife threatened to leave the house, he became instantly docile and resigned to whatever evils he had raised his harsh discordant voice against. The old man had lived so many years with his wife, that though their matrimonial life begun not from the well-spring of the purest affection, they having married from <emph>policy,</emph> still, he had grown to be very dependent upon her for his domestic happiness, and on no account would he consent to live apart from her; and so, too, she towards him entertained a like sentiment of attachment and dependence; but her cunning was such, that she concealed her true feelings, and contrived to give to her husband the impression, that at any moment, for <emph>cause,</emph> she was ready and willing to desert him. This impression held him in fear, and by this fear she exercised over him a government, of which he was at times most impatient, yet he submitted, lest something more unendurable should come upon him.</p> 
               <p>The Catchpennys, we have said, had failed! From pride and plenty, they had slipped to humility and scarcity; but they still carried on their game of presumption, as far as circumstances would allow. They talked as loud, and as consequential, in some particulars, as ever. They declared that the wisest and best of mankind had been, and still were poor; that poverty was no disgrace, though exceedingly inconvenient on market days; that Socrates and most of the ancient philosophers were unblessed with money, and lived in tubs; and that so enviable their lot was deemed to be, that the greatest potentate of the age, Alexander, declared that if he were not a prince, he would be a philosopher, and content himself with a tub; and, finally, they would cite the history of the Saviour, who had not where to lay his head, and then triumphantly ask, what disgrace can there possibly be in poverty-'tis inconvenient, that is all, and so are many other matters inconvenient, particularly toady friends, who are always the accompaniments of riches. Thus the Catchpennys consoled themselves in their misfortunes, and amused themselves by laughing at and <emph>ridiculing</emph> those who had dropped their acquaintance ance, because they were now no longer in silks and a fine house, on a fashionable street. They particularly enjoyed all the ludicrous statements which were made, of the <emph>peculiarities</emph> of the Touchmenot family, whom every one <emph>admired,</emph> for the fund of amusement which their imbecility and airs afforded to society at large; and so heartily never did they laugh, not even in their palmiest days, when their spirits were most buoyant, as at these people, now especially since the letter to which we have referred exposed them to public view in a most lamentable plight of the humorous. But lest we should omit this choice bit of correspondence, and thereby deprive the reader of a "good thing," which we should deeply regret, since towards you, whether one of the set to which we have the honor and felicity to belong, or one of the opposite, for whom we entertain no sentiment not Christian-for <emph>you,</emph> we have not any other wish than that you should be "highly entertained," and why should you not be, who give your time, your attention, and your money, to our tale. Here is the letter; if you have the blues, they will not, I am sure, survive this hour. The grammer in particular you will admire.</p>

                              <dateline>"SPAIN, OH SPAIN. Jan'y 18.</dateline>
                           </opener> 
                           <p>Well, mamma, what do you think of me? Aint I on a high <emph>hoarse</emph> here in Spain? The way 'hubby and I,' with his small hands and feet and smashing whiskers, have put things through, is a caution to young cubs. Money makes the mare go, and so we go it-like the very devil.</p> 
                           <p>I am constantly meeting folks from home, but I can't take any pleasure in their society-disgusting creatures-they look and act as though they had just barely pennies enough to take them out and home, at the cheapest rate-and besides, too, what do you think! the devilish mongrels eat with their knives-whenever I see a knife being shoved into their mouths freighted with stuff enough at one pop, to feed a dozen young ones, I always wish the food might choke them, and the knife cut their vulgar throats. <emph>Such</emph> people going abroad! do you wonder that<pb n="232-233" xml:id="VAC6064-00000117"/> most all Europeans think the Yankee nation a pack of <emph>trafficking hogs</emph>-and that they say all manner of uncomplimentary things of us. Sampsne and myself they take to be anything but Yankees, and if 'I and hubby' could only speak the French well, we might pass for <foreign xml:lang="FRA">Parisennes,</foreign> which is my highest ambition next to that of maternity, which I shall, with hubby's consent, realize by and by, but he is so dreadful tender footed and tender hearted on this subject-that I sometimes am quite discouraged. There's no go ahead to him at all.</p> 
                           <p>He says he married me for his convenience, isn't this cool enough and shameful enough and ought he not be made to suffer for such conduct; but he is such a dear handsome fellow, and has such splendid eyes, dark as night, and such soft sensual-spiritual whiskers, of which I dearly love to feel, that I can for his sweet sake forgive him most anything. Marry me for his convenience! well, that is a hard pill for me to swallow, but I have down with it, and doesn't hurt me one bit-it nauseates a little, that is all. And what more do you think he says-why, that he has no idea of being overrun by a pack of brats through any instrumentality of <emph>his.</emph> Well, <emph>there</emph> now, I <emph>do</emph> think, <emph>that</emph> is <emph>too</emph> bad-one of my chief hopes of pleasure smashed, through his political economy, or whatever you please to call it. I call it, to give it its right name, infernal ingratitude and stubbornness-with plenty of <emph>money,</emph> and everything else to go ahead upon, and yet the stupid holds back. When I tell him to have back-bone; that we have got money enough-in fact are made up of it, and to do his duty, he says: 'No man knoweth what a day may bring forth.' Your daddy may die, and I am no money scrub as he is; when he goes, the stream is dried up which supplies our pond, and if a hard time should come in the course of affairs we might find our pond, no pond at all. So, say nothing more to me about raising a family, for I foresee, as soon as I begin this unprofitable game, I shall be a heavy loser and thereby raise the devil. No, no, leave me to prudence, you torment, to toast and eggs for breakfast, the best for dinner, and <emph>ease</emph> all the way through life. Plenty of wine, good soup, pretty women, mountain scenery, and picturesque landscapes, and I am all right-O.K., with nothing shall I find fault, but say in all sincerity that God spoke truly when he said all that he had made was good-this, under circumstances of my own selection, I should endorse without the least hesitation.</p> 
                           <p>Now, this is the way this fellow talks-and yet people like him-you have no idea how many friends he has, and women too, are always casting longing eyes at him. Don't you think one Spanish wench was so <foreign xml:lang="FRA">complaisant</foreign> with him, that I was obliged to tell her to desist-that I could not allow any woman 'to tread upon my toes'-and that if she didn't mind what she was about, dot her <hi rend="i"/>i's and cross her <hi rend="i"/>t's, I would report her to such parties in law as would bind her over to keep the peace.</p> 
                           <p>
                              <hi rend="i"/>Spunk, oh, spunk, mama, is a great thing. You never saw a creature so essentially <emph>cowed</emph>-so used up. She left the house <emph>at once,</emph> and went, I hope to the devil-for I think it is there she is 'native and to the manner born'-Shakspeare, I believe, a very respectable authority among poets and noodles, but of no account whatever in business circles. All that this genius! as they call him ever said, or for aught I know to the contrary, ever did, could not buy <emph>one</emph> such a dress as I would wish to wear.</p> 
                           <p>Poets-genius-good Heavens-a pack of lazy curses, who, whenever they marry, always contrive to make their wives as miserable as miserable can be. All the drudgery thrown on to the wives,-a <emph>plaguy</emph> set of fools, I say, for putting up with the nonsense of these pumkin heads, who can do nothing under the sun, but talk about inspiration, and write the most infernal trash, that persons who read their stuff may become as incompetent and shameless as themselves.</p> 
                           <p>A Spaniard of <hi rend="i"/>Cadiz, who had been in Boston, and took considerable interest in us on that account, (and who by the way was a very learned somebody, and so eccentric! nothing about him was like anything I had ever seen before. I took him at first to be a madman, or a fool, so singular his appearance). Well, this fellow undertook to tell us all concerning the literary genius of Spain, about Calderron, De Vega, Cervantes, and I don't remember who else; but he ran on as though mad-particularly<pb n="234-235" xml:id="VAC6064-00000118"/> ticularly when discousring of the genius of <hi rend="i"/>De Vega-whom he said was by all odds the greatest of dramatists, the world had ever known. Shakspeare he thought a dwarf to him. <emph>I</emph> stood up for Shakspeare, and so did 'hubby.'-I told him Hamlet and Macbeth, and King Lear, and Richard 3d, Othello, and Julius Csar, no man could transcend, and I said it in such a way too, as was evident I meant it.</p> 
                           <p>When this Spanish chap saw that <emph>I</emph> could talk as well as 'hubby,' though hubby is rather tame on emergencies, he gave way, and began to 'haul in his horns,'-and finally, he became quite calm, and appeared once more like a rational human being. Oh, these scholars, these fellows who know so much, one has only to spunk up to them-to appear to know something as well as they, to talk confidently, and they flatten out at once-cave, as Gaseous used to say, when he would be felicitous. I want you to write me all about this fellow. Did you ever in all your life know such a fool-a fellow with so much impudence and so little to brag of. Just think of a man, with so little real worth to recommend him, dashing around among the '<emph>best</emph> circles' with all the bombast and blushing insolence of a <emph>Mogul.</emph> Ought he not to be stuffed like an alegator when he dies, and be put in the museum, as a rare biped-for he is amphibious you know, now on land, then at sea. I have been surprised at the patience with which most persons in society have borne his presumption and undue familiarities. He may be a 'clever man,' but I swear he is the most self-complacent one I ever knew, and swings himself about like the jib boom or spanker of a vessel in light airs and a rolling sea. But enough of him. Like all the rest of us, he must sooner or later die, and when he stinks in the ground he will need more than at present, his lavender. (Mrs. Touchmenot was sorry to find such a bitter allusion to <emph>Gaseous,</emph> because she rather liked this man, as she had in early life been intimate with his father, who was of a good family, and somewhat attached to her.)</p> 
                           <p>With all that I have seen I may say that I am quite pleased. I like things in general very well. I have an eye for nature, at times, but I am no artist I suppose, for these people have their eye on nature the whole time and on <emph>nothing else,</emph> except patrons. They have a clear vision, and wonderful scent for <emph>pap,</emph> and it matters not who spoons it out to them so that they get it. They are the most ridiculous set of beings, as a rule with whom we meet. I can tell one of these fools as far as I can see-they always have a peculiar way with them-a certain something plainly tells one-'<emph>I</emph> am an artist; unless you feel for and can appreciate <emph>genius,</emph> and will spoon <emph>me</emph> some <emph>pap</emph> don't you presume on my time or attention-for I am at home only to those, who admire genius, and can afford to patronize it.' Such a pack of impracticable asses as are these, ought to be ridden on rails, and dumped into the horse ponds of the several countries, which they inhabit, for they are of no account in any matters of first-rate importance. They are never contented or in any measure happy, but growling, grumbling the whole time, and abusing not only each other personally, but their works. I don't think I ever heard one artist say of another, in the same line of business, that his brother's works were well executed, without adding such qualifications as made faint praise go but little ways. And this is called genius! these are the favored children of God! If they are, they ought to be whipped and sent to bed, for their treatment not only of each other, but of those not of their brotherhood, to whom they always are willing to <emph>toady,</emph> when there is anything to be <emph>gained.</emph> I know these fellows, <emph>well</emph> and the reason why I have never received any particular attention from them is, because I have always made merry over the idea of genius, and the absurd claims set up for it, among what is termed 'the learned world'-learned <emph>boobies</emph>-why, I have seen some of this class, whom it took so long to collect their thoughts on any given subject, that one might make a tolerable long journey, and then still find time to spare, before our scholar fairly got his mouth open; but, I must confess, when it <emph>is</emph> opened, it sometimes requires a long period before it can again be shut. I dread the opening I assure you; and as a rule I avoid people, who are what is called 'well stored with information,' for every one in two proves to be an unendurable <emph>bore.</emph> They always want to convince<pb n="236-237" xml:id="VAC6064-00000119"/> vince one of something, about which they have formed very comfortable and satisfactory opinions, and don't care to be disturbed in them.</p> 
                           <p>They are <emph>progressives</emph>-they are a pack of noisy hounds, who are ever scenting out what <emph>they</emph> call <emph>error,</emph> and barking at it-<emph>reform!</emph> These apostles of reform, 'hubby' says, (and I think his judgment is pretty good upon such matters,) are the most dangerous of mankind-and he thinks such characters at home-that is throughout the Northern States, will before many years destroy the <emph>Union</emph>-and he furthermore thinks, they will plunge the entire country in fratricidal war.</p> 
                           <p>I never heard 'hubby' so eloquent before, save when he told me how he loved me, and how he should die of a broken heart, if I did not marry him. But he <emph>lied</emph> there-there is not the least doubt of that, for I am satisfied he is brittle in no part but his stomach-a disappointment there might result fatally, but as to his heart, why it is as tough as an old piece of leather, or a bull's horn, you have no idea how tough it is. But I'll mellow him and it in time-if I don't, then I shall certainly become pious, go into a nunnery and veil my charms-and spit at all breeches ever after. Well, isn't this a thundering long letter-You know when I set out to do anything I <emph>do</emph> it. I set out to <emph>tire</emph> you 'right good,' as the Southerners say, whom I have met, (and they are fellows I like, I must say,) although there is considerable <emph>oats</emph> to them-that is, they feel pretty well; that is, they are sensible of their oats-a <emph>horse</emph> phrase, but a <emph>natural</emph> one, nevertheless; those who are fond of <emph>nature</emph> cannot in <emph>conscience</emph> object. Well, I meant to <emph>tire</emph> you, and I guess I have succeeded. I felt a sort of spite when I commenced this letter, and as there was no one at hand on whom I could vent it, I just set down to open the phial on <emph>you.</emph> If you cant take liberties with your parents and friends, who can you be free with; that's the question. 'Hubby' strokes his elegant black beard, which falls in artistic grace down upon his full projecting bosom, and says to me, I do perfectly right-no one is more fitting than a parent to receive back their own. Now, just think of such an idea as <emph>that,</emph> encouraging me in such ways; but he is a darling, and I overlook in him much that I could not in a <emph>booby.</emph> More in my next of 'Americans abroad.'</p> 
                           <p>There are some rich specimens of gentility from Boston-persons who not merely eat with their knives, but blow their noses on the <emph>napkins,</emph> presuming that they are put by their plate for that purpose. Beside this dirty trick, they squirt tobacco juice around, so that one is in great danger at times and in certain places of being thoroughly steeped in the <emph>weed.</emph> I wish the devilish men would, if they call themselves civilized give <emph>some</emph> proof of it, at least. Can you imagine anything more barbarous than the chewing of tobacco,-I certainly cannot. Hubby says it is with reluctance that <emph>he</emph> smokes-but this is another of his lies-for I am satisfied he could not do without his cigar, any more than he could do without <emph>me;</emph> but he is a dear good fellow, (and notwithstanding he lies when he pleases, and who don't?) I love him dearly, and I shall always love him, provided he keeps his health and his darling whiskers which I do so admire, and am so well pleased to play with in the morning when I awake; and I do so love to comb them, too; for then it is that 'hubby' takes me so Frenchy in his lap, and kisses me so sweetly-you have no idea what an <emph>art</emph> he makes of all this, and the delightful sensation produced. I <emph>do</emph> declare there is something after all in a gentleman's ways-one thoroughly so to the <emph>back-bone,</emph> which is irresistible; and it is no use to think of enjoying <emph>love</emph> with any other-for love is a myth, if not professed by one who has a fine taste, and is alive to all its delicate shades. One who has never experienced it, has no conception of the many exquisite sensations a skilful lover may excite in a woman, in every twenty-four hours. I tell you such a man is worth the getting at any rate-a half a dozen fortunes is none too large a price for <emph>him.</emph> I consider that I have made a great haul-next to that I made in the 'Northern Light'-a yacht which for so long time was the gem of the waters of Boston Bay, if I except the saucy dashing little <emph>Raven,</emph> whose wonderful speed has so often astonished me, when I have been sailing off Nahant.</p> 
                           <p>I once said to a friend who sat at my side at the <foreign xml:lang="FRA">table d'hote</foreign> of one of the most agreeable houses for travellers<pb n="238-239" xml:id="VAC6064-00000120"/> in the city of Madrid, and whom I had met at Newport and Nahant, and who was perfectly familiar with all the boats and their commanders at both places-'Sir,' said I, 'why is it the Raven is such a superior craft? she beats everything of her size, and much over." 'Oh,' said he, smiling, 'there is no mystery here; the gentleman who built that boat, I know very well; I have known him from a boy; his love of boat-sailing was a very early one-and 'speed' has always been his motto. He is one of the sort who booms ahead; he gets things right, first, then he goes in and wins: upon <emph>such</emph> a principle as <emph>this,</emph> he modelled the <emph>Raven</emph>-she has never failed to do all she was expected to do; she's a trump card; and whenever played she takes a trick. Like her owner, she thinks quick, talks quick, and moves quick; in a word she is a beauty!"</p> 
                           <p>'She is,' I replied at once 'I endorse all you have said.' Now, mama, have I not run on at a great rate, about boats and artists, and vicious women and vicious men, and I don't know what,-so numerous are the themes. I wish you would tell me all the news-you are so short always. I shall begin to believe you are getting old and ugly, if you do not pay me more attention, I shall, indeed. I wish I knew Latin enough to wind up with-so much for being only <emph>half</emph> educated. You have no idea how meanly I have felt, (although I have allowed no one to perceive it,) when thrown into the society of learned people, because I could not comprehend much of the conversation, so interlarded was it with Latin quotations. I at first thought this was all affectation, but I am satisfied that those who are perfectly conversant with the Latin language, make these quotations from habits, perfectly natural to them; and so I wish to God I had been thoroughly <emph>educated,</emph> but its too late now to cry over spilt milk, and I am not one to be a fool, on all occasions-and at every chance. I know what society thinks of me, but by and by I'll show them who and what I am. Some of them in laughing at me, may laugh too long.</p> 
                           <p>Adieu, old lady, and believe me yours with a sigh,</p>

               <p>We trust, dear reader, that you are not uncomfortably fatigued, by this long-winded effort of Mrs. Sampsne, late Miss Julia Touchmenot. We could have condensed it; but we thought it would be more satisfactory to you to have the whole, and so we yielded to what we believed your good will and pleasure.</p> 
               <p>The Misses Catchpennys, as we have said, made considerable sport over this production which they happened to hear read by persons who were privy to its contents. It was another severe mortification that Mrs. Touchmenot had experienced, "that her letters from her daughter should meet the vulgar eye;" and when Julia learned of the mishap, she wrote to her father a letter full of wrath. Old Touchmenot had never in the whole course of his existence received such a "dressing down," to use Mrs. Sampsne's words, as she gave him for being so careless with her correspondence. It was to speak in her father's phraseology, "savage and unnatural." He had had a number of hard kicks within his family circle, but the hardest one he had yet received was that of being called "a childish old fool-a superannuated nightmare."</p>

               <p>THE Catchpennys we have said had failed, and a bad failure it was. The girls had given up all hope of being married to their mind, and so they would not marry at all; they despised men as a vain set of coxcombs, who were "bobbing around" in society as beasts of prey! they gave to such no quarter. They had worked hard for husbands, and had merely their labor for their pains. The fish they thought secure, slipped through their too open nets. The prospect of <emph>old maidenship</emph> was before them; they were utterly discouraged with all their newly acquired philosophy. Mrs. Catchpenny could not but perceive the "awful change" in the world towards them-those who had been most forward and seemed the most friendly were those who particularly avoided her, now that <emph>she was poor.</emph> She took her experience near to heart and hugged it closely there. It was hard to accept and harder still to cherish and to make her bed fellow, yet she gradually warmed towards it, and since she knew it to be <emph>truth</emph> she made it forever her own. Her hair which until recently was sprinkled only slightly with grey, was now completely blanched; about which her daughters would now and then speak <emph>jestingly.</emph> They had no respect for their mother, still less of love; and rarely gave her a kind or even respectful word. They said their mother had brought them up in indolent habits, and now as they had nothing to be grateful for she must accept from them such usage as her training might inspire. Mr.Catchpenny was very much broken in health, and he never expected again to be able to recover his position. He had lost a large property, and his mind was shattered by the catastrophe. There was none to pity him; he had made no <emph>real</emph> true friends; this was not in his nature. All his transactions had been based upon the closest rules of business, from which he never swerved-to accommodate any one; and he was now being paid in his own coin; he was left to the operation of those close rules of business to which he always with so much pertinacity adhered. Yet there was one being in the world, and one alone, who looked upon his situation with compassion, and who had determined to be his friend. This was William Andrews, whom he had dismissed from his employ, and to whom he had not spoken from that day to the present time. The chagrin of Old Penniman, the disappearance of McAlpin to parts unknown, the death of Ida Robertson, together with the failure of the Catchpennys, had caused no slight commotion in fashionable circles, wherein is discussed the exciting, exhilarating topics of the day, and where persons not unfrequently draw upon their imagination for facts at pleasure. Many were the conjectures as to the whereabouts of Mr. James McAlpin, but nobody could throw any light upon the subject-all was mystery and night!</p> 
               <p>Nelly thought he had gone to Texas, Mrs. Penniman was sure he had not left the State. Mrs. Donothing felt quite confident he had gone to Canada; her husband would bet the best bottle of brandy to be had in the city, that he had left for the Rocky Mountains, where he intended to adopt the life of the <emph>savage.</emph> Mrs. Touchmenot thought he had gone to Europe; "her mind was so much upon the <emph>continent</emph>" just at that time, she thought everybody's else must be also, and whenever she heard of a person's disappearance, she invariably concluded they must have gone to Europe.</p> 
               <p>"McAlpin's game," for such it was called, was a nine day's wonder, and then nothing more was said out of the family, and but little in. They were in fact glad to get rid of him; and "as to that Donothing," they would be glad of his absence at any time; since he had grown to be an incorrigible sot, drinking and squandering away his time to no purpose, worthy of a Christian or a man. In billiard saloons, at race courses, at bar rooms and houses of ill-fame, he was <emph>well</emph> known, and an <emph>especial</emph> favorite. The women flattered him for his money, and the company of billiard and bar saloons, for his companionship, which was well suited to their quality.</p> 
               <pb n="242-243" xml:id="VAC6064-00000122"/> 
               <p>The "Albion," then in charge of Major Barton, one of the most affable and forbearing of men, was noted for its excellent liquors, which Donothing and his friends frequently imbibed, both morning, noon, and night; few of the major's customers of that day are still in the places which knew them then. They are scattered far and far. A jollier crowd than met together at times around those marble slabs, whereon mint juleps, cock-tails, stone-walls, and brandy-smashers were arranged, is rarely to be seen: and a more unaffected and gracious smile, which ever played about the handsome features of mine host, the landlord, good Major Barton, is equally as rare-so mild, attentive, obliging, and self-possessed; so truly the gentleman in all things-who can remember but with regret that those slabs, those nice drinks, and all those associations, alas, have passed away; but not the major, still he lives, as cheerful, as cordial, as kind as ever; and long may he live, as a hale old tree, with a heart unseared, and a spirit free.</p>

               <p>OUR hero, William Andrews, having devoted his entire energies to his professional pursuits, succeeded in procuring a most lucrative practice; and as envy and malice and all uncharitableness follow in the path of success and honor, he had them, of course, barking at his heels. Some thought him very unscrupulous and mean; others thought him arrogant, too confident, and uncompromising; others did not think him flexible enough; and others again condemned his scholarship. "He might know a great deal about the dodges of law-its fictions and its follies, but it was very evident he was deficient in very much of that reading which, as Bacon says, makes a full man." He was full of legal quibbles, they were ready to admit; could make a very clever special plea, and do all the work of the Bar, creditably and even with more than usual skill; yet he was no such remarkable man as his friends and admirers claimed-he was an expert lawyer, but nothing more.</p> 
               <p>Andrews was perfectly well acquainted with the various opinions current as to his merits as a lawyer, citizen, and scholar. He was well satisfied to have persons estimate him according to their own rules. So long as he commanded the best business at the Bar, and enjoyed the confidence and esteem of its most honored members, and also the respect of the best men of all professions, he had no cause of dissatisfaction or complaint. He was <emph>content,</emph> and in Agnes' sweet love he was most happy. She had deeply interested herself in her husband's pursuits, and she understood perfectly the principles of the current Law. She had attentively read Blackstone and Coke-she had closely studied the civil in connection with the<pb n="244-245" xml:id="VAC6064-00000123"/> common law, and this vast subject of Jurisprudence, if not in its details, certainly in its generalities, was distinctly marked in her enquiring mind. She passionately loved her husband-she also loved everything with which his fame and fortune was intertwined. To him and to his ambition she gave herself up wholly, and lived in those hopes which inspired him in his labors. Towards the Catchpennys in their distress she entertained the commiseration of a true Christian, and it was by her influence that her husband was enabled to wipe from his mind the remembrance of the wrongs he had suffered at their hands-to forgive and forget their unkindness. He had risen to a position, "in the good Providence of God," in which he could afford to be magnanimous-his brilliant advance into favor with the public and the wealth he was rapidly accumulating, was in the vision of the Pennimans a hateful sight-they could not endure to look upon <emph>his</emph> prosperity. Now, far above all those who had been his traducers, he looked about him with the calm consciousness of power, and with intense scorn surveyed the impotence of his enemies. He had illustrated to society in general, and to the Pennimans in particular, that he though the son of a musician was ever a King, and at all times, immeasurably the superior of those who had sneered at his origin.</p> 
               <p>From Lexington they had moved into the city, and occupied a spacious mansion which Mr. Andrews had purchased at a great bargain. It was well located upon a pleasant and fashionable street, and at their door might daily be seen standing the private carriages of those persons who honor wealth and genius. With Agnes Farriday they were charmed; her natural manner, her warm impulses; her fine conversational powers, her beamy, eloquent, deep, dark eyes, all combined, threw around her an indescribable fascination which must be experienced to be truly known. The poor came to her without fear or trembling, for they knew in "dear Mrs. Andrews they would always find a sympathizing and active friend;" they worshipped her virtues, with unfeigned gratitude and affection. She was so kind, always having a smile for them, and a word of sweet encouragement.

               <p>Her efforts in behalf of the prostitute were unceasing, and many a noble-hearted and intelligent woman, owed to her magnanimity and sense of Christian duty the happiness of being reformed from the arts of the wanton, to the ennobling habits of honorable service, in the smiling and fragrant fields of virtue. She went to them as she had gone to Irene Caruthers, not with censure, not with an overbearing consciousness of superior worth, but with the earnestness of humility, and with the sincerity of truth-nor did she make this labor of love a <emph>pastime,</emph> but a solemn <emph>duty</emph> enjoined by the life and teachings of Jesus. She spoke in the sweet and winning tones, of charity and of unfeigned sympathy, and those who heard her voice, capable of appreciating her nature, could not resist the assurance which it gave them that good deeds, and worthy thoughts and emotions, were a blessing to all those who practised them. And thus she effected the reform of many a misdirected sister, who needed but the right method of friendship exerted in their behalf, to become united once more to a happy and honorable career. In the reformation of this particular quality of vice, there is required the exercise of no little <emph>art.</emph> Each individual case not unfrequently requires an especial treatment, in the same manner as disease of the body; for vice is but a distemper of the moral nature; and those whom we would cure or relieve, we must patiently attend and study. Something more is needed than to pack them together in <emph>homes.</emph> They require to feel that there are those who <emph>love</emph> them <emph>truly,</emph> and whose <emph>happiness</emph> depend upon the full and permanent reform of their habits, and complete restitution to the esteem of such society, as they are mentally qualified to <emph>enjoy.</emph> Inspire them with the consciousness that they are <emph>loved,</emph> as are the most virtuous of the fair children of God! and if they are not utterly lost in crime, they will respond to the true unmistakable sympathies<pb n="246-247" xml:id="VAC6064-00000124"/> of the Christian heart and mind. We know in this city, ay, in every city of our favored land, there are hundreds and thousands of capable minds, appreciative of noble qualities in mankind, who are engaged in the walks of prostitution, because they have no confidence whatever in the human heart; they believe, life in all its departments, is one of crime, and they think it is impossible for <emph>them</emph> to get their living unassisted by <emph>falsehood.</emph> They are women of keen perceptions, and see matters as they really are. Would you go to such persons with the invitation of <emph>reform,</emph> and invite them to leave comfortable lodgings and cheerful company, for the daily toil of the needle or the wash-tub, so seldom <emph>fairly</emph> paid, and so still more rarely remunerated? They would not heed you, they would laugh you to scorn, and in a moment of indignation might thurst you from their door, for in all this they see but the <emph>sentiment</emph> of piety, which <emph>they</emph> can entertain as well as <emph>you,</emph> and many of them <emph>do</emph> from the force of that sentiment, when the "regular unexceptionably moral church-goer, prayful citizen," merely whines and prates of misery. They <emph>do</emph> good deeds, with ill-gotten gains, it is true; but in the sight of Heaven their offering must be more prized, certainly as much so, as that which virtue gives ofttimes so grudingly. Would you reform these women, reform yourselves! Let them see that there is indeed more happiness, more justice, more peace, more honor, more love, more enduring sympathy, in <emph>your</emph> hearts and minds, than in <emph>theirs,</emph> and you may be assured they will speedily fly to habits which offer so superior advantages. But don't ask them to go from ease, from pleasant friendships, though irregular, to fret themselves in homes where the pride of domineering self-sufficient virtue is disgusting and pitiful to behold. Because they will not heed you, nor would it be human nature, nor Christ's nature, if they should. He scorned the self-righteous Pharisee, and so do all smart women of the town those charities, which, in their operation humiliates, instead of ennobling and strengthening them in a confidence of the human heart's sincerity, and impartial love.</p> 
               <p>In Agnes, they believed; they saw she professed no more interest in their happiness than she was ready and willing to <emph>demonstrate:</emph> they saw when she asked a woman to lead a moral life, she took the precaution to ascertain <emph>first,</emph> that that life could be made more attractive than the one to which "the fallen" was addicted. She inspired such with <emph>self-respect,</emph> and placed them amid associations agreeable to their feelings; and few were the women whom she fascinated into honorable pursuits, who did not devotedly adhere to them for "her dear sake." And this, and this alone, is the spirit which must be aroused in those we would reform, if we would make the change <emph>permanent</emph>-for another's sake, and not so much for their own, must they live and adhere to the habits, staid as they are, of chastity and reform. In this sympathy they are safe and strong; without it they are ever in peril.</p>

               <p>WE have said, Mrs. Andrews, towards the dejected and hopelessly broken down Catchpennys, bore a kindly feeling, and urged the same upon her husband.</p> 
               <p>One afternoon towards the close of a pleasant autumn day, when the trees had fully assumed their dress of many golden and purple hues, and when the ground was covered by the fallen leaves, approaching a low, dingy looking house on the road to one of the neighboring thriving towns, was seen a handsome carriage and a lively span of horses, driven by our hero William Andrews, with Agnes by his side. The house was the residence of the Catchpennys, whose present poverty was in marked contrast with the elegance in which they lived, when Andrews was discharged from their service. As they drove up to the door, Mr. Catchpenny came out to meet them, and with a degree of condescension he could not have submitted to in years gone by, took charge of Mr. Andrews' horses, and thereupon made the most obsequious compliments. He had lost his haughty manners, and in the place of a severe imperious frown, all now was smiles, and compromise. Misfortune had been of service to him; it had improved his way of thinking, essentially, and there <emph>were</emph> those in whom he could recognize, <emph>now,</emph> the essentials of manhood as well as in himself. His head was not tossed on high, as in former days, but modestly hung about his shoulders. He felt assured he was not the only one worthy of pantheonic honors. He bowed to persons graciously, and even went out of his way to. speak to those, who, in the past, he deemed as carrion. "Mrs. Catchpenny and her girls," were equally well instructed in very different and more agreeable manners than those they had been in the habit of while of "our very best society." They "found it hard" to be on terms of association "with those to whose society alone they at this time had access, yet they had determined" to make the best of the world-of whoever and whatever they meet with in it.</p> 
               <p>As Agnes and her husband entered the house, they were met at the door by "Mrs. Catchpenny and her girls," as they were called by the Penniman set; and such a hospitable welcome, as they received, was a happy comment upon the <foreign xml:lang="FRA">prestige</foreign> of success and power. Mr. Catchpenny, with all the aptitude of a lackey, had driven the horses into the town not far distant, that he might procure the services of a blacksmith, to replace a shoe which had been knocked from the fore-hoof of one of the animals. This shoe had been preserved by Mr. Andrews, who had been at an extra expense to have his horses shod in the best possible manner. He told Catchpenny to be sure and have the shoe <emph>replaced,</emph> as no other would suit <emph>him;</emph> and thereupon he placed a check for $10,000 in his hand with this note:</p>

               <p>Mrs. Catchpenny, although she had abused the "confidential clerk," admired in an inexpressible degree the handsome and talented lawyer. She took both his and Agnes'<pb n="250-251" xml:id="VAC6064-00000126"/> nes' hand, and warmly pressed them to her bosom. Agnes had of late made her several visits; but her husband had never been in her society, since the memorable evening of Mrs. Touchmenot's discomfiture, although he had often met her on the street, and likewise her daughters.</p> 
               <p>"Ah, Mr. Andrews, the wheel of fortune makes sad work sometimes," remarked Mrs. Catchpenny. "If I naven't had my full taste of the dirt of poverty, then never a woman had; and these girls of mine are perfect nettles in my sides."</p> 
               <p>"You shouldn't have any sides," exclaimed Fanny, as she sat at the window with her needle making a dress for Laura, her sister. "What business have people, I should like to know, with sides, who have got no bottom. You know what they say of a horse, if he's got no bottom, knock him on the head. Just so the world, (which is no more nor less than a heartless slave-driver, both North and South,) thinks and too often says of <emph>women.</emph> She's not only expected to bear children, actually institute society and keep it alive, but in addition, she is called upon to provide for all its wants. I don't really see in the majority of instances what men were sent into the world for unless to loaf, marry, and 'talk big.' They are always talking 'big things,' but doing nothing, save filling silly women's heads full of nonsense, and getting them into trouble."</p> 
               <p>"Well, they never got you into any trouble, did they?" exclaimed Mrs. Catchpenny. "You are always running the men. It's a pity they hadn't put you in a good humor by just making the attempt."</p> 
               <p>"Now, Mrs. Andrews, you can see just what from day to day I have to endure," ejaculated Fanny; "if any other person had said that much to me, I would have knocked the creature down; but a parent is <emph>privileged!</emph> God save me from ever being a parent."</p> 
               <p>"Bah!" muttered Mrs. Catchpenny, her eye darting fire."</p> 
               <p>"Why, why, Miss Fanny," said Mr. Andrews, "you are not near as good-natured as you used to be. You ought not to let a little trouble set so ill at ease upon you."</p> 
               <p>"Oh, you 've gone up!" exclaimed Fanny. "It's very well for you to talk. I've talked once myself, and I know what a luxury it is."</p> 
               <p>"Yes," exclaimed Laura, "and so do I-to be able to tell people how they ought to be resigned to calicoes and baked beans, while one feasts on the best the market affords and plenty of it, and splurges around in silks and satins, and their 'private carriage.' Oh,-ah-it's all very fine-to advise under <emph>such</emph> circumstances. I've done the very same thing myself, and I know how pleasant it is-but all I've to do now is to listen, and to be appreciative of all the good advice and sympathy which drops along the current of meddlesome and officious humanity."</p> 
               <p>"Well, now, my dear, you must stop such conversasion," vociferated Mrs. Catchpenny. "What <emph>will</emph> Mr. and Mrs. Andrews think of us; they certainly will conclude, we have become perfectly uncivilized through misfortune. Mrs. Andrews, I beg you will excuse anything which may appear odd in my daughters-they are old enough to know better, and <emph>do</emph> know better, but I am sorry to say a change of fortune has made them bitter and reckless:" and as she said this she wiped a tear from her eye.</p> 
               <p>"Bitter and reckless:" muttered both Laura and Fanny. "Mrs. Andrews don't you believe a word of it," continued Fanny. "Mother is always misrepresenting us-finding fault-fault-the whole time."</p> 
               <p>"Good heavens!" exclaimed Laura. "There are few daughters who would not have been driven from her presence long ago."</p> 
               <p>"Well, go!" exclaimed Mrs. Catchpenny. "You ungrateful creatures, go-go! get out of my sight.-I am sure I want no one by me who wishes to be <emph>elsewhere.</emph>"</p> 
               <p>"There-there, that's just the way it is-Mrs. Andrews-we never can speak our mind, without she flies into a passion;" and as Fanny concluded she looked at her mother frowningly.</p> 
               <p>"Don't you dare-don't you dare browbeat me," exclaimed Mrs. Catchpenny, "or faith,-you <emph>shall go</emph> I'll be as earnest as you. After <emph>all</emph> the trouble I have had in bringing you into the world-in educating you"-</p> 
               <pb n="252-253" xml:id="VAC6064-00000127"/> 
               <p>"There-there, there," interrupted Laura. "Do hold on-do hold on, I pray you."</p> 
               <p>"Then behave yourselves!" exclaimed Mrs. Catchpenny. "I'll have you to know I am your <emph>mother</emph> still, and by my soul, you <emph>shall</emph> respect me; or I'll drive you from my presence."</p> 
               <p>"She's under high pressure just now," whispered Fanny to Laura; "let her alone-let her alone, or she'll burst."</p> 
               <p>"Such girls-such doings-such talk is abominable," continued Mrs. Catchpenny; "and I-I-do hope Mr. and Mrs. Andrews, that you will not report us to your friends; for they will indeed think us degraded to the very lowest round of fortune's ladder."</p> 
               <p>"Oh, be not concerned about this," replied our hero.</p> 
               <p>"No, no," said Agnes. "Our visit to you is one of mercy and love; we are no news-mongers-no informers; we know life, my dear madam, quite well, we know the inconvenience of <emph>poverty,</emph> its deprivations, the sorrow of a fall from rank."</p> 
               <p>"Yes, ladies all, we feel for, we sympathize with your hardships," remarked our <emph>hero.</emph> "And we profess to be, and shall <emph>prove</emph> to be, your firm devoted friends. Think not that I cherish one unkind memory of the <emph>past;</emph> all is <emph>wiped away.</emph> We profess to believe in the life of Christ-we mean to do, as near as we may, by all our fellow creatures, as his doctrines enjoin. Believe us then-have confidence in us-and hope through us, for better days."</p> 
               <p>"Isn't <emph>that</emph> Andrews to a dot?" whispered Fanny to Laura. "He's noble, there's no doubt of that-whoever calls him <emph>poor</emph> stock, <emph>lies!</emph>"</p> 
               <p>Mrs. Catchpenny, who had nearly recovered from her angry mood, expressed herself most grateful for the kind professions of her visitors, nor did she doubt of their sincerity; but secretly she felt deeply grieved that her situation was such as to oblige her to accept of the good offices of William Andrews and his lady. She could not, however, afford to decline the friendly aid of any one, least of all that of those who had risen so rapidly into fame and power. Fanny and Laura did not so much regard the means of relief, so that they procured again some sort of assistance, which would place them in society they could once more enjoy. They felt as outcasts, now, from those whose respect they most desired, and which in their palmy days, they uninterruptedly seemed to command.</p> 
               <p>"Oh, Mr. Andrews," said Laura, "we never thought to need <emph>your</emph> sympathies, under <emph>just such circumstances.</emph>"</p> 
               <p>"No, indeed," muttered Fanny.</p> 
               <p>"But we are most thankful for them;" remarked the mother with a strong emphasis; "we are always grateful even for the smallest favors."</p> 
               <p>"Just hear her run on," whispered Fanny to Laura; "she knows perfectly well it goes against her grain mightily to accept of any favors from <emph>them.</emph>"</p> 
               <p>"Well, no matter," returned Laura in a whisper; "if she can <emph>use</emph> them, I hope to mercy she will do so-for we <emph>do</emph> want assistance, Heaven knows, bad enough-and assistance we must have soon, or to the poor-house we must march, in double quick."</p> 
               <p>"Well Fanny," said Agnes, "what are you plotting, with your head so close to <emph>Laura?</emph>" nothing against the liberties of your country I hope, or-"</p> 
               <p>"Oh, no," interrupted Fanny, "against no one's rights would I conspire. I want my own-that's all."</p> 
               <p>"Well, those you should have," responded Agnes; "and as I am a pretty good lawyer, I promise you, you <emph>shall</emph> have them."</p> 
               <p>"Thank you, thank you," returned Fanny; "how <emph>well</emph> she feels to be sure," continued she in a whisper to Laura; "she's got a smart husband, and so she thinks she can caracol; she'll break her precious neck, if she doesn't mind, and then-"</p> 
               <p>"She'll prance no more," interrupted Laura.</p> 
               <p>"And I should be glad," returned Fanny, "for then I'd have another chance at him; and he should not escape me, I promise you."</p> 
               <p>"What are your heads so much together for," remarked Mrs. Catchpenny; "I should think women as old as you are would pay more respect to conventional rules."</p> 
               <p>"I don't object, Mrs. Catchpenny, to a suspension of these rules," remarked Mr. Andrews; "on the contrary, I always am pleased to have persons perfectly natural; it<pb n="254-255" xml:id="VAC6064-00000128"/> seems to me this, among friends, is the only true law of society."</p> 
               <p>"I certainly think so," said Mrs. Andrews.</p> 
               <p>"There," whispered Fanny to Laura, "you see <emph>she</emph> thinks just as <emph>he</emph> does, of course." Then turning to Mr. Andrews, she continued, "Mr. Andrews, what a pity it is, we cannot foresee events; I never should have let you slipped through my fingers into Agnes' bosom if I had only <emph>suspected</emph> even, you <emph>promised</emph> so well."</p> 
               <p>"Ha, ha, ha! Fanny," said Agnes; "you are not the first woman who has slighted her opportunities; who has not seen the gold amid the sand."</p> 
               <p>"No, I believe you," returned Fanny.</p> 
               <p>"Well, Fanny," remarked our hero, "you are what we should call in court, a very embarrassing witness; you speak so freely your mind."</p> 
               <p>"Where, oh, where's the use of a mind, unless one can make it speak? answer me that question, if you please," rejoined Fanny, sharply.</p> 
               <p>"Well, you know," returned the lawyer, "some of us don't deem it always <emph>best</emph> to say precisely what we think, at all times and in all places; because it happens often that much is said by imprudent lips which would gladly be recalled."</p> 
               <p>"You've got it now, Fanny, plump in the eye," whispered Laura; "you had better not tackle the lawyers, but keep shady."</p> 
               <p>"Oh," remarked Agnes, "we women must have our say, and all must peaceably submit to that right."</p> 
               <p>"You see," whispered Fanny to Laura, "she is talking now for kindness' sake; she doesn't believe one word of it. She would not have any woman to say 'bo, bo, bo,' but herself, if she could prevent it; and as to Andrews, he may say what he pleases, but any one can see from his face that he is an out-and-out <emph>aristocrat.</emph> Just look at that eye, will you, and then tell me, he doesn't feel <emph>well,</emph> if you can-he is just as <emph>oaty</emph> as he can be."</p> 
               <p>"That's so," returned Laura.</p> 
               <p>"Whispering again!" exclaimed Mrs. Catchpenny; "if you don't stop that work, I'll withdraw Mr. and Mrs. Andrews from the room. I have brought you up both to know that it is most impolite when equals and superiors are present, to whisper or to giggle, and I am determined to have no more of it. Now stop such doings at once. I don't care if you are of age, you shall respect the education <emph>I</emph> have given you, so long as we continue under one roof. If you go elsewhere I've nothing to say, but if you stay with me, you must and shall be ladies."</p> 
               <p>"Well, that is smart," whispered Laura.</p> 
               <p>"Yes," returned Fanny, "she's full of steam to-day, and blow it off she will."</p> 
               <p>"Why, mother," exclaimed Fanny, "you are so violent you fairly shake my nerves; and I am sure both Mr. and Mrs. Andrews are suffering from spasms. Do be a little more passive."</p> 
               <p>"You are enough, both of you, to wear away the patience of the most gentle. Mr. and Mrs. Andrews I hope you will excuse us all; we are in misfortune's train, and cannot seem otherwise than objects to be pitied," replied the mother; and at these words she burst into tears.</p> 
               <p>"Such daughters! oh, such daughters!" she exclaimed, "and such an inactive, fear-stricken husband, no woman ever yet had to endure."</p> 
               <p>"Ah, madam," replied our hero, "calm your excited mind; your husband has labored under great embarrassments, with no <emph>friends;</emph> can you wonder he is impassive and timid-who would not be, <emph>knowing the world,</emph> as he knows it, as <emph>I</emph> know it, as <emph>you</emph> must know it-remember when the wind is fair and the sea smooth, and the sky unclouded, our bark of life glides lightly o'er the wave, and all delight to bid, God-speed; but when amid the breakers, oh, then, how changed the scene! Have charity for your husband; he will yet support you well. <emph>I</emph> have willed it!"</p> 
               <p>"Ay, sir!" exclaimed Mr. Catchpenny, as he walked into the room, a tear in his eye and a smile on his lip; "you have commanded, and I will obey-cheerfully. Ah, my dear, dear Andrews, give me your hand, and come here close to my heart. Till now, I have not believed in human nature, nor had any trust in God. I have seen but policy and self-interest-distrust in all. I have looked upon existence as an accident-upon the grave, as the end of ends!<pb n="256-257" xml:id="VAC6064-00000129"/> But with this day's experience I awake to a new life, for in your bounty I recognize in <emph>man</emph> that only which can come from God!-forgiveness of insult, injustice, abuse of power! ay, and even friendship for <emph>him,</emph> who meted out evil to <emph>you.</emph> Wife, children, behold in these two beings the appointed of heaven to conduct us to prosperity and self-respect again-from hell they have taken us, and opened to us fairer realms. I hold within my hand a check for $10,000, the property of Mr. Andrews, loaned to me for business purposes, with the promise of as much more as I may profitably use. Thus, through his success in life, which we would have denied him, I am a man again!. Is not the hand of God in this? From no other human being could I hope for such confidence and esteem and liberality; bless him all of you, for he is your saviour! your dearest friend!"</p> 
               <p>Mrs. Catchpenny had swooned in her chair from excess of rapture, and Fanny and Laura, exhilarated with the hope of once again shining in society, rushed at Mr. and Mrs. Andrews, and overwhelmed them with caresses.</p> 
               <p>Mr. Catchpenny gave his personal attention to his wife, who soon recovered her normal condition. Rising from her chair she passed to where Mr. and Mrs. Andrews were standing, and affectionately taking their hands, said, in tones of deep feeling, "My dear friends, I thank you, may God bless you for this noble, unselfish deed. May your lives flow on in happiness, and your deaths be as the dropping of the leaves."</p> 
               <p>"Why, did you ever hear mother so musical before?" whispered Fanny to Laura, "this is true poetry, and you know how she has always hated it."</p> 
               <p>"Yes," returned Laura; "but such a character as that of <emph>Andrews</emph> is enough to fill all life with song. Suppose every one was like him, would not this earth be heaven? who would, or could suffer."</p> 
               <p>"Oh, sir," continued Mrs. Catchpenny, "let never the <emph>past</emph> intrude upon our friendship of the <emph>future;</emph> let us have true faith in each other, and firm trust in God."</p> 
               <p>"It is, my dear Mrs. Catchpenny," remarked Agnes, "my wish to have all as you desire."</p> 
               <p>"And so, too, 'tis mine," said Andrews; "I would have the future of us all, a lesson worthy of ourselves; I would have truth our guiding star, and death no sting."</p> 
               <p>"It <emph>shall</emph> be so," remarked Mr. Catchpenny. "You will behold in <emph>us all</emph> the practice of those noble virtues, you have taught us is the heritage of man. Shall it not be so, my children-wife-speak."</p> 
               <p>"For myself, I most emphatically answer, yes," responded Fanny.</p> 
               <p>"And I the same," replied Laura.</p> 
               <p>"No words can speak my gratitude and joy," responded Mrs. Catchpenny; "you may safely depend on me."</p> 
               <p>Laura, then casting an enquiring eye at the lawyer, exclaimed, "Well, I always told you, you never sounded Mr. Andrew's depths, and I don't think you have reached bottom yet."</p> 
               <p>Fanny, then taking him by the arm, and still laughing at Laura's no soundings, exclaimed, "Turn around to the light where I can see you, and find out whether you are in right good earnest or not; you know an old <foreign xml:lang="FRA">belle</foreign> may take liberties with an old <foreign xml:lang="FRA">beau;</foreign>" and as she concluded these words, she kissed him, looking slyly at Agnes.</p> 
               <p>"Oh, I don't object," remarked Mrs. Andrews, "not in the least. In serving you as <emph>friends,</emph> we would have you frank and <emph>free.</emph>"</p> 
               <p>This was a happy day and still happier hour for the Catchpennys; they went from freezing point to summer heat, and acquired speedily the blithesomeness of larks. Mr. Catchpenny had already got his head up in its former position, and Mrs. Catchpenny's hair seemed turning black again. Their admiration for our hero and his lady was unbounded, and their caresses were warm and sincere. As they left the house for the city, the blessing of God was freely invoked by all the family.</p> 
               <p>Andrews turning to Fanny and Laura, who were standing close to the carriage step laughing at the felicitious wit of Agnes, patted both of them under the chin, saying jocosely, "Don't you ever dare to turn up your noses at me again." With this he cracked the whip and away dashed the handsome couple, as the dust rolled up from beneath the square tread of the highly-metaled span. Whenever<pb n="258-259" xml:id="VAC6064-00000130"/> the eye of any one passing on the road met those of Agnes and her husband, instinctively they stopped, and gazed in admiration and surprise. "What a splendid couple," was the exclamation of all.</p>

               <p>THE Catchpennys had learned by <emph>experience;</emph> and Mrs. Catchpenny said, "Pride must have a fall; we must be proud no more; only of character-of noble deeds;" to which all the others said "Amen." They were quite willing to leave the "city of notions"-they had had enough of <emph>east winds,</emph> and heartless conventionalisms-they were unanimously of the opinion that of all places on the face of the earth, Boston was the last for persons to build up any hopes in, of recovering their position <emph>when once it had been lost.</emph> The more worthy of encouragement they might be, the more they would be neglected and despised. So thought the Catchpennys-they could not bear the sight of those in whose "sets" they had once been "so much esteemed and <emph>petted.</emph>" They heartily wished themselves <emph>out</emph> of the State of Massachusetts and Yankee land, generally: "they <emph>did</emph> think of all the mean, stinking trash, (in the eastern hemisphere, at least,) <emph>Yankees</emph> and Bostonians <foreign xml:lang="FRA">par excellence,</foreign> out stripped any and everything they had ever heard or seen."</p> 
               <p>"Any place," said Laura, "where its city government will take advantage of a <emph>legal quibble</emph> to avoid the payment of a just debt, to a worthy officer for capturing at the peril of his life, a great criminal for whose apprehension and delivery into the custody of this city government, a handsome reward was offered-any man or corporation who will be guilty of such indefensible meanness, niggerism as <emph>this</emph>-I want to escape from as soon as possible. So, father, let us pack up our effects and go West or South-anywhere out of puritanical Yankeedom! Did not Andrews say well in advising this? He's got<pb n="260-261" xml:id="VAC6064-00000131"/> a long head, and knows all I have just said is true to the letter. Think, only think of those Yellowbodies, Inconceiveables-those haughty, insufferable haughty, come-of-nothing Pennimans!" whose father and grandfather swept the dung from stables-and those Touchmenots, those progenitors it is believed were convicts, and those Cheekersprings, who are absolutely mere dirt, but whom a clever, hard-working, and truly noble man, has by his genius given the means on which they now so heartlessly splurge in hoops, in feathers, and bright buttons-toadying to foreigners, and kissing the soft hands of nobility-such trash-oh, that such trash should have it in <emph>their</emph> power to tread on <emph>us</emph>-as they have done, since father's failure."</p> 
               <p>"Oh, never mind," replied Catchpenny, "never mind my dear, the cat will mew, and the dog <emph>will</emph> have his day."</p> 
               <p>"Yes, and a long day they are having of it," returned Fanny. "Never mind!-yes, but I will mind, though-to be cut and hammered as I have been by these wretches since I came out in calicoes, is something <emph>to</emph> mind, methinks; and now that we've got Andrews for a backer, they shall feel me, I warrant you. When in my silks again, I'll let them see they can't <emph>slight</emph> Fanny. No, no, I'll let them see my <emph>blood!</emph> They'll want to be sociable again, but they shall feel <emph>my scorn.</emph>"</p> 
               <p>Laura applauded the sentiments of her sister, and said, "Just so soon as her father got agoing again, and could furnish her with the means to play the lady, she, too, would let these Boston upstarts, wherever she might meet them, know that they could not become her associates again-she would let them know a thing or two, <emph>that</emph> she would."</p> 
               <p>Mrs. Catchpenny entertained towards Boston and its fashion very much the same spirit as her children; but she was too profoundly impressed with their good fortune to make it immediately the subject of hope of thus being the instrument of their passions-and Mr. Catchpenny, though he in a tenfold manner felt all the indignities which his misfortune had subjected himself and family to, yet he appeared perfectly unmoved by them; but simply said, he would <emph>endeavor</emph> to make them all comfortable again, and to place within their use the means to sustain themselves in such circles as they moved in formerly, and from which they had so unexpectedly fallen. He was bent on making a large fortune, and with this end in view he determined to settle in <emph>St. Louis,</emph> and establish himself in a Produce and Commission business, with a branch of his house at New Orleans, Cincinnati, and New York. His plan was an extensive one, and he was confident he could carry it out, as he intended to associate with him one of the smartest young men in the country, who was familiar with all points of business in the South and West, and fully posted in the fluctuations of its markets. Secretly he proposed to marry him to one of his daughters, because he was persuaded the blood of the Catchpennys, mingled with that of <emph>such</emph> an energetic and knowing man, must yield a staple of bone, flesh, and intellect, of which he could not be otherwise than <emph>proud.</emph> He wished to live his life over again in his grand-children as he had done in his children, and above all, he wanted to improve the <emph>breed</emph> by every possible calculation. He was a man of figures and of facts; and in the whole course of his busy life had never read attentively through the works of even <emph>one</emph> poet. He denounced the <emph>art,</emph> and declared no man <emph>safe</emph> who was in search of fame through any such an absurd medium. He said if all poets were <emph>hung,</emph> as from time to time they made their appearance, there would be a better state of morals, and a healthier condition of mind. As to Longfellow's beauties, they were no beauties at all; and none but silly women, incompetent men, and romantic girls and boys, would waste their time in reading his poetical effusions. In the judgment of Mr. Catchpenny, who regarded the laws of Political Economy as the most important to society, this "charming master of song," was esteemed as an egotistical, self-admiring, polished literary sot, who could do nothing but teach, and write sentimental nonsense, perfume, and talk in signs which few sensible people had time to qualify themselves to understand.</p>

                  <emph>Polmesly,</emph> the great and immortal <emph>Polmesly!</emph> the <foreign xml:lang="LAT">multum in parvo</foreign> of all scientific data, <emph>the</emph> man of men-the Napoleon of wit, and what shall we say of song!-the<pb n="262-263" xml:id="VAC6064-00000132"/> good fellow-the <emph>handsome</emph> fellow, the fellow who has always something to say-first in all things, and last in nothing, except at tea-the undaunted! the genius that knows no law, he may not be able to expound-the explanation of explanations! the man who does not believe in phrenology, as we are informed, because phrenology doesn't believe in him-the pet of the petticoats, who gives his songs and his sons to his admiring and wounded country! the literary contriver, who is so well pleased with his reputation as a person "of <emph>decided</emph> parts," that he consents to follow in the track of his illustrious tribe of quill-men, and thus comes to the illustration of himself in <emph>vignet,</emph> in those books of which his inexhaustible genius has been felicitously and without pains, delivered-handsome fellow, charming fellow, the Adonis of prose as well as poetry-the Hector of <emph>success;</emph> that <emph>mean</emph> word-that domineering, sneering, uneasy, breezy, easy, cheesy, acrimonious, euphonious, ominous, delightful, spiteful, agglutinous, pious, outrageous, captious, truckling, piddling, apprehensive, extensive, (and so on through the entire dictionary), word-that <emph>idea</emph> of <emph>ideas!</emph>-to which all men bow, who bow at all-for in <emph>success,</emph> where ever it may chance to happen, and it often happens in strange places, and frequently from still stranger workings of <emph>small</emph> things to <emph>big</emph> ends-wherever this hero <emph>success</emph> is found whether on two legs or four, whether clean or unclean, whether fat and oily, or dry and spare, whether honest or dishonest, whether lovely or unlovely, gentle or severe, or whatever its condition, it is a thing of <emph>substance</emph>-it may be <emph>chewed,</emph> it may be <emph>nibbled</emph>-it may sometimes be <emph>fleeced,</emph> it is sweet to smell of, still more delicious to avail of, and so be it Painter, Poet, Trader or Scavenger, it has always the best of friends, and the most persistent of <emph>toadies</emph>-now, reader, for such an august personage-having power, having <emph>really,</emph> a genuine wit and humor, about which there is no mistake, for so declare the "mutual admirers," whose head is at Cambridge, and whose tail has never yet been found, as hidden as the outlets of the north pole, which has been <emph>Kaned</emph> severely enough, heaven knows, to disgorge its secrets, yet still is dumb,-that such a being, who, in anceint days! would have been crowned with <emph>bays,</emph> and set upon a high hill, as an extraordinary projection of nature-that <emph>he,</emph> the privileged! the inimitable Athenian, humorist, poet, and sage! who gives the <emph>cue</emph> to mirth, and is an indispensable adjunct to all gatherings of wisdom, common sense and taste-the one whose <emph>laws</emph> of beauty and <foreign xml:lang="LAT">et ceteras,</foreign> should regulate one's laughter and attemper one's wits-that <emph>he</emph> should be called, even by so commercial and practical a money-monger as Mr. Catchpenny, "a facetious cow-boy," is lamentable to record.</p> 
               <p>No greater <emph>abuse</emph> of "free speech," no more infamous abrogation of civilized modes of thought and judgment, was ever before <emph>even dreamed</emph> of, in the imagination of the most crazy-headed romancer of ancient, middle, or <emph>modern</emph> ages. Yet, such was Mr. Catchpenny's opinion, such was the opinion of his wife and daughters. They had met this "famous character" in society-"they could not bear his presence." It always appeared to them "as though he was taking notes of human life, and smelt a bad smell; nothing ever appeared to give to his countenance the fresh tinge of fragrance or beamy rays of love," and as <emph>Laura</emph> would view his portrait in <emph>vignet,</emph> she used always to say, "If this man only knew himself, he'd keep more shady." Miss Fanny had a tart saying for most every one, particularly those who set themselves up as geniuses! in which she did not much believe-not being able to understand how it could be, that "all being deceitful and desperately wicked," as the Bible declared, in which she <emph>did,</emph> at times, <emph>believe</emph>-how if this be so, <emph>genius</emph> was entitled to any more "cake and tea" than anybody else, was what she could not, and <emph>would</emph> not comprehend. In fact, she regarded all "unusually gifted persons," as unusually <emph>disgusting</emph> ones, and often would declare, rather than to be married to a pair of breeches, made up of a love of self and fame, she would much prefer to live an old maid, and husband her virginity in comparative peace and neglect; for she thought after all, since she had a taste of it, that to be neglected was not so harsh a pill, when taken with a little philosophy. She could stand it very well she thought-"much better <emph>far,</emph> than she could endure <emph>any</emph> man,<pb n="264-265" xml:id="VAC6064-00000133"/> who could have the <emph>heart</emph> to place an ungrateful, backbiting, captious, frivolous, grudgingly approving, hypercritical, fretful, intriguing <emph>public,</emph> in his affections before <emph>her! She</emph> must be <emph>served</emph> and honored <emph>first,</emph> and the public <emph>afterwards,</emph> or she would never consent to live with <emph>any sort of a genius</emph>-to be played with and upon as <emph>his second fiddle!</emph> Not <emph>she.</emph>"</p> 
               <p>Mr. and Mrs. Catchpenny, quite well pleased "with her spunk," sincerely hoped she would "adhere to her principles, so high-spirited and delightful;" they wanted neither poets, nor dreamers of any sort about them, but <emph>men</emph> in every sense of the term, who could do business and make money <emph>rapidly</emph>-who could get families and attend to, and take care of them-who were practical enough to know, that eating, good eating and drinking as well, are absolute <emph>necessities,</emph> and that life is dependent thereon. Men who sing only when they've nothing better to do, and who never talk love, for talk's sake-men, who go to bed late and get up early, with a clear head, and a tolerably <emph>clear conscience</emph>-who let other men's wives alone, and never seek by force of <emph>winning</emph> ways, and pleasing <emph>fancy,</emph> to overcome <emph>unlawfully</emph> any of the fair sex-married or unmarried, fascinating or unfascinating, fair or foul, in health or out of health, willing or unwilling, "but inspired with an awful sense of virtue, '<emph>stick close</emph>' to wife and children, and home."</p> 
               <p>These were men in which Mr. and Mrs. Catchpenny <emph>believed,</emph> and were hopeful of for their much loved, though abusive, and oftentimes rebellious daughters. In the course of a couple of weeks they expected to emigrate, "and when that happy day shall arrive," exclaimed both Fanny and Laura, "I shall have taken another lease of life, and purer and happier will be my hopes than ever! Yes, to me there is something criminal and infectious in this very air of <emph>Boston</emph> and its vicinity, breathed by those venomous Pennimans and Touchmenots, Yellowbodies and Inconceivables, which is destructive to my morals and cankering to my mind. Haste, oh, haste daddy, and waft us away to fairer climes, more genial humanity." And with these words she slapped her smiling father on the back, then putting her arms around his neck, kissed him: a manifestation of interest and tenderness she had for some time previous omitted altogether.</p> 
               <p>"Do I owe this," inquired he pleasantly, "to my worth, or that of Andrews?"</p> 
               <p>"Daddy," replied Fanny smiling, "you must not be too inquisitive. You know inquiring too closely into the mysteries of the kitchen, is <emph>apt</emph> to paralyze the <emph>appetite.</emph> So mind what you are about. If Andrews has given you health, wealth, and spirits, think me a <emph>darling,</emph> and <emph>I am</emph> so. There's nothing either good or bad but thinking makes it so, you know. So go ahead and get as soon as possible out of Yankeedom and bears. Pork and molasses, and small beer, I have had more than enough of-so move, whenever you please, to St. Louis, or the devil, and I will go along contentedly with you-anywhere but here within the smell of <emph>Boston.</emph>"</p> 
               <p>And as she concluded, she chucked her father under the chin, then seizing hold of her sister, twirled her around to the step of the polka, she had many times taken with Andrews. The Misses Catchpenny danced well, and when they were of the <foreign xml:lang="FRA">elite,</foreign> the arm of many a beaux, "particular as to their partners," had known the measure of their waists, and lovers' cheeks had felt the beating of these full and rounded bosoms, which mortification, neglect, and grief, had somewhat modified, in these days of their sojourn in the wilderness. But with Andrews' professions and <emph>doings,</emph> they were fast recovering their former light-heartedness, and soon would become as talkative, saucy, and plump as ever.</p> 
               <p>"Oh, Andrews, Andrews!" exclaimed Fanny; "what a delightful Andrews! I feel you in every limb, in every fibre of my grief-ridden body-you are enshrined in my heart, and so will ever be, throughout all eternity. Yes, my dear fellow, I <emph>am</emph> yours, and if it should ever happen, that I am made a mother of, through love or <emph>something like it,</emph> my first, oh, my first! shall be christened, <emph>William Andrews Catchpenny,</emph> and in <emph>him</emph> shall I have <emph>all</emph> the hopes which <emph>Agnes</emph> has in <emph>you.</emph> If he proves not a genius under the inspiration of <emph>your</emph> fair name, I am certain he won't prove either a knave or a fool. You, oh you, Sir<pb n="266-267" xml:id="VAC6064-00000134"/> Andrews, are the gis of our family, of our honor, of our everything; you-oh, <emph>you</emph> are a perfect brick-this let none dare gainsay."</p> 
               <p>As she said this she ceased her motions, and fell into the lap of her mother, who, slapping her on the back, exclaimed, "get off of me; I have <emph>borne</emph> you long enough, now bear yourself."</p> 
               <p>"That's clever," ejaculated Fanny, rising to her feet, and looking playfully at her parent; "very clever. Whenever you get your wit in play, I know your spirits are coming up-well, let them come-we have had small beer enough. Hurrah for the musician's son! one of the <emph>plebs!</emph> What would I not give to be the owner of just such a <emph>jewel</emph> as that? worlds, worlds, an, worlds! Mud, eh! it is <emph>that</emph> kind of <emph>mud</emph> of which <emph>men</emph> are made-and spare me any other."</p> 
               <p>So Fanny run on, and Laura after her, with Mr. and Mrs. Catchpenny in the background, catching from their children the warming fires of hope, fancy, and resolution-for the girls had determined to make their mark yet, though fully up to that age when virginity begins to wilt and look bilious, yet there was paint and there was chalk, and soaps of many kinds; and by the handmaid art of humbug, they intended yet to fascinate "worthy men." And with these hopes, buoyant as balloons-with these fancies plumed for a far distant flight, to conquer and secure what all desire, but few can command-respect, competence, a clear conscience, ease and honor-with these golden dreams, and the still more golden memories of their true friend and benefactor, Andrews, we now leave them to pursue their journey West to new homes and new associates-where the air of Boston goes not only in small quantities, and where the ever-moving, swiftly gliding currents of human life purge society of much of its stiffness, censoriousness, and <foreign xml:lang="FRA">hauteur.</foreign>

               <p>OUR hero, William Andrews, with every succeeding day grew more popular both as a citizen and a lawyer, and his services had been solicited repeatedly by committies as lecturer on Laws and other subjects of vital interest to the community. He had been offered a seat in the Senate, but as his practice of Law was so extensive, he declined the public honors which had been so freely and pressingly tendered him. He did not as yet ardently aspire to the duties of a statesman, but he reserved for future years the realization of these hopes; the burthen of these severe responsibilities. It was towards the middle of a day in December, one of those "still cold days" when men gather about their ears the collars of their coats, and keep their hands well clad with heavy gloves, when the snow glistens in crystal particles, and creaks at the tread of man, or the passage of runners heavily freighted with merchandise; when noses grow numb, and a <emph>hot punch may be taken as a medicine,</emph>-when anything that has <emph>heat</emph> is coveted with an especial affection for its superior advantages;-on such a day, in an office near the court-house located in a building appropriated to the Knights of the Bar, was seated in an easy chair beside a table covered with a handsome green cloth, on which lay loosely arranged a number of books and papers, a man of a marked and massive countenance, and an eye so blue and piercing, the stoutest nerves were tremulous under its activity and power. His wavy hair lay about his prominent brow which was deeply indented with the lines of profound thought and study. He was alone. From the walls of his office hung several portraits of famous jurists, among which were Webster, Clay, Choate, Calhoun, and Benton. As he raised his head from<pb n="268-269" xml:id="VAC6064-00000135"/> its downward, thoughtful position, his eye rested upon <hi rend="i"/>Webster, now in the meridian of his fame, and raising his hand to his brow, as though to recover some chain of thought, he said in a slow, solemn tone, "had I <emph>his</emph> brain, I would attain to his glory. Truly is he a man to <emph>command;</emph> reminding one of those ancient demi-gods and heroes, whom men delighted to <emph>obey.</emph> An ardent patriot, a warm friend, an acute lawyer, a dignified and rational orator, both his mind and heart were tempered by an unwavering faith in Christianity, and a perfect trust in God. Webster, thy merits will never be fully rewarded by man, but thy duties will ever be faithfully performed! And Choate, the <hi rend="i"/>Erskine of our Bar, how worthy to be the friend of so pure a statist, so conscientious a scholar; thy genius points to that career which will be glorious; but since thou wilt not stoop to flatter the people, and those who more immediately control them, thou wilt fail of that complete success, which a less unbending integrity would secure. And <hi rend="i"/>Clay, how my heart beats with pleasure in contemplating thy manhood-thy gallant soul. Too true to thy convictions of justice and truth, the honors which thy labors and transcendent moral and intellectual worth should insure, will fall to meaner men; but yet will the best and purest hearts ever linger around thy grave, to catch the inspirations of thy kingly truth! And Calhoun, much as I respect thy power, I fear thy metaphysics; I fear that subtle logic which would prove this, the noble charter of our liberties, but a rope of sand! if thou hadst but Webster's unbiassed and practical judgment, thou would never peril the existence of this Constitution, by doctrines which, however plausible in the abstract, are inexpedient and dangerous as <emph>Law.</emph> The seed which thou art so busily scattering on the political soil of your country, may yet fructify into such error as to deluge the land in blood! and when you are in your grave it shall be said by the pilgrim who wanders there, as a tear rolls down his cheek, "here lies the mighty soul whose eccentricities of logic, and illusory metaphysics, caused the ruin of his country! Alas, Calhoun, that <emph>thou,</emph> so gifted and sincere, should have thought so unfairly of the law, it was thy duty rightly and rationally to construe. When thy God shall ask thee for the fruits of those splendid talents he reposed in thy keeping, how blackened and bloody they will be. Thus will after ages speak thy name. But not so <hi rend="i"/>Benton. Here is a mind deep as is the well of <hi rend="i"/>Artois, casting forth from its clear and bubbling springs, life, new life, to the Republic. His noble form, his wonderful energy, his indomitable perseverance, his fearless spirit, has earned for him, and justly too, the admiration of his countrymen; he is indeed 'Old Bullion'-sound and solid." With these words he for a moment ceased, and passing his hand repeatedly over his brow, at the same time pushing the light, wavy, and glossy hair from his face, he continued with an abstracted air to express in low, though audible tones, his thoughts. "These were men of genius all, who loved Justice and devoted their lives to ceaseless toil to compass its administration. They worked for power, from a sense of duty to mankind, and to themselves-that their outward lives might be in harmony with their interior forms; they acquired fame, but none reached the goal to which their labors and their hopes were pointed. Ah! what is Justice, Law, and what, oh, what is Fame! Justice is love of God! whoever loves his Maker, loves to be in all things <emph>just</emph>-for this and this alone is <emph>happiness!</emph> Law, though from the spring of Justice drawn, is changed by <emph>art</emph> to <emph>policy</emph>-and men will argue, but for <emph>rights</emph> which it is expedient and profitable to acquire. And thus the lawyer, honest though he be, will fall far short of justice, however large the fee. For Justice is the handmaid of the Law, and not its <emph>master,</emph> and often lays abed from fear of insult, and oft from lack of strength to rise; she grieves continually, and thus her health from sadness and unceasing watchfulness comes to be impaired. When first I thought in solemn earnestness of <emph>power!</emph> I flew to <emph>Law.</emph> 'Twas then my heart beat high, for said I to myself, I will so store my mind with principles as shall make judgment easy, and thus the right and thus the wrong I'll have at all my fingers ends, to guide my fellow man. Well, well, it was a folly this; I know it <emph>now,</emph> but I did not suspect it <emph>then.</emph> Unused to sophistry, I little realized its sway. I little dreamed how <emph>art</emph> could cozen <emph>nature,</emph> and from the noblest soul sworn<pb n="270-271" xml:id="VAC6064-00000136"/> to be most <emph>just</emph> and <emph>true,</emph> unwittingly <emph>extort</emph> a judgment false-if not extort, <emph>obtain</emph>-and for this piece of <emph>ingenuity,</emph> wit brings even <emph>virtue,</emph> the least untouched by human indiscretions, and easy humor, to bend the knee to it-to beg <emph>its</emph> likeness, or its hair, or anything by which, when it no more its brilliant parts may spread, it shall be yet identified, though in the ground its graceful form may mingle with the earth of which 'twas fashioned. 'Tis not justice, nor the law, which pleases, but the advocate <emph>alone!</emph> and if he has received an intellect which has scope to grasp the infinite threads of argument which make for and against all points of controversy, impatient of restraint, he straightway strangles or drives with fearful fright mild justice off, while he pulls lustily for <emph>policy</emph> and <emph>fame.</emph> It matters not <emph>who</emph> comes to him for succour, if his case is with <emph>one</emph> single feature of <emph>precedent,</emph> and seasoned with a handsome fee, it <emph>shall</emph> appear that right and justice make for <emph>it,</emph> though tears and broken hearts go howling from her temple, and the scales are seen by unprofessional eyes to kick the beam from lightness of humanity to those who ask for truth in vain! and why? because of all things in this world, least had by <emph>merest asking,</emph> is that which God through <emph>conscience</emph> declareth <emph>free to all.</emph> For Law and Justice men must <emph>pay,</emph> and dearly too, since on these elements of human life, have been entailed so large a load of learning, that to understand the crooked ways through which it forces study, the noblest minds which can endure unceasing toil must set themselves apart, and that, too, early, while yet the soul may be inured to reticence, and in her secret chambers turn o'er and o'er their accumulated stores without fatigue, proving the task a <emph>pleasure.</emph> Such and such alone should seek to know the mysteries of that web of nicest spinning, termed the 'meshes of the law'-for weaker minds can never hope to comprehend the structure, but lost in varied indistinctivenesses, <emph>fall to a painful void,</emph> in which the soul seems so <emph>meaningless,</emph> that the veriest thing that moves upon the earth seems more endowed with sense and God! No rules there are without exceptions so airy and impalpable, that in grasping these one oft is apt to lose the rule, and thus from all this reasoning, comes a sickening blank; and so throughout the <emph>common law,</emph> prevails this common indistinctness. So varied are the circumstances which are involved in all disputes, that seldom one case, can determine others-an ingenious mind will split a hair, and do away with all that has been done. And this, though strange as it may seem to say, is from that source of perfect right which makes the common law so dear-'tis termed its flexibility-from whence sweet Justice gets her mellowest fruit and in abundance most-from whence come those delays which laymen swear so hard about, and all that trying labor which a lawyer oft sends early to his grave, or so perplexes with <emph>uncertainty,</emph> as to shake his nerves with <emph>fears.</emph> No single mind can know this <emph>precious</emph> law, the boast of merry England; but why she should take pride in that, so much obscured-so difficult to unravel-and which compel, whoever may venture at the skein, to live as hermits, and as horses work, is passed my wit to fathom-for nature tells me, and did ever so inform, that <emph>truth</emph> is <emph>Justice,</emph> and that no system can be <emph>true</emph> to man, which contradicts what all men <emph>feel</emph> the same, <emph>that God is love</emph>-and Law is God! Now, if I do perceive a wrong on earth it is in <emph>Governments</emph>-since they exist to please and pamper <emph>pride,</emph> and <emph>cunning,</emph> and foster fell <emph>suspicion.</emph> Those in its palings-the favored few, lifted to the seats of <emph>power,</emph> forget how much they owe of courtesy and kindest will to those upon whose <emph>backs they ride,</emph> and in their self-conceit and self-sufficiency they make the law, (so it but carry them in ease along,) of painful interest to those <emph>not of their clan.</emph> This is as I behold this boasted arm of right; and yet so frail and lacking much in wisdom are near all mankind, <emph>I</emph> should not dare to promise any better way of regulating power. But yet methinks it might be done if men could only realize how little <emph>justice</emph> they obtain, when largely they are taxed, so that <emph>right</emph> may be had at any time when wanted. All courts are so perplexed with learning that they do not comprehend what justice is, and though "<emph>most honorable,</emph>" are most uninformed of what mankind are most in need-which is <emph>some little certainty to law.</emph> If this, from ignorance nor from learning can be had, why what a <emph>farce is life!</emph> and who may not<pb n="272-273" xml:id="VAC6064-00000137"/> be pardoned, when in the bitterness of despair he doubts of God! When after years of toil at the bench and bar, the jurist with his soul tattered by the conflict of opinion, and his face as a sunless sea rocked by the winds of sorrow, tearfully exclaims, 'What, oh, what is truth,-for in my studies, and long, long life, I've found it not.'</p> 
               <p>At this instant the door opened and a young man entered from an adjoining room,-he was a student at Law in the office of Mr. Andrews, and the room from which he had emerged, was set apart for study and the students. He appeared considerably perplexed; and his countenance indicated the most marked disgust. His eyes were fortified by a pair of steel bow-spring spectacles, which snugly fitted to the base of the nose; his hair was a dingy brown color, and had the appearance of utter neglect. We do not think a comb had entered its parts for many a day; it was said the young man sought to look as much like <hi rend="i"/>Choate as possible; and for this reason he received the <foreign xml:lang="FRA">soubrequet</foreign> from many of the younger members of the Bar, of "rather <hi rend="i"/>Choaty." It vexed him exceedingly to be thus characterised, although he was at a good deal of pains to invite the derision- for derision it was, and nothing else. He was a youth that was passionately fired with a zeal to know the right and the wrong-he was willing to work if he could only see any end to his journey. The more he studied, the farther off he appeared from the object of his ambition-which was to <emph>know the law.</emph>
               </p> 
               <p>"Mr. Andrews," he said, as he held a digest of the law of real property in his hand, "I'm going to give it up-<emph>it's no use</emph>-the more I read the more puzzled I am. There doesn't appear to me a case in this digest, not open to <emph>uncertainty,</emph> and how to advise a person on any points herein discussed, I dont know, and damn me I cannot find out."</p> 
               <p>"Well, your position is not at all peculiar, my young friend," replied Mr. Andrews; "and if you expect to get at much, <emph>so</emph> clear, as to be able to go into courts with it, <emph>unapprehensive of dis</emph>appointment and defeat, you had better at once understand your expectations <emph>never will be realised;</emph> and if you are not contented to buffit with <emph>all</emph>
                   
                  <emph>sorts of fiction,</emph> and every possible <emph>ingenuity</emph> of argument, however sophistical and irrational it may appear, take my advice, and quit legal pursuits this very hour! ay, this very <emph>minute,</emph> whilst you can do so without <emph>mortification</emph> and <emph>embarrassment.</emph>"</p> 
               <p>"Your advise I shall follow," rejoined the young man. "I have seen enough in law books to satisfy me that a more inharmonious gathering of odds and ends have not an existence out of hell. Excuse me, Mr. Andrews, I mean no offense to you-you are a <emph>man</emph> in <emph>every</emph> sense of that word-I love and honor you-but as for the common law, I am heartily sick of it. What no man can understand, however gifted, is a poor machine, and <emph>I</emph> want nothing to do with it, sir; I shall go at something else this <emph>very</emph> day."</p> 
               <p>"Well, Mr. Templeton, what do you propose?"</p> 
               <p>"I know not," he replied, "but something that's plain sailing and <emph>honest</emph> withall."</p> 
               <p>The door again opened, and in walked a tall snaky looking fellow with green spectacles, and clipper-built face, deep dark eyes, and long black hair. Casting a peculiar squint at Templeton, he said,-</p> 
               <p>"Mr. Andrews, I've got that brief in order-when shall you want to use it?"</p> 
               <p>"Can I trust you to make the pleadings?" inquired Andrews--sharply eying the young man, who had just been admitted to practice in all the courts of the Commonwealth.</p> 
               <p>"I think you can, sir," replied the new fledged lawyer. "You have had me under your eye some time as a <emph>student</emph>-you <emph>ought</emph> to know of what I am capable."</p> 
               <p>"So I had-so I had," returned Andrews, hurriedly. "Well, I'll put you on the case, and we'll see what you'll do with it."</p> 
               <p>"He'll <emph>do</emph> with it," muttered Templeton, aside. "What that chap can't get through <emph>his</emph> pate, won't pass <emph>anywhere.</emph> I've seen <emph>him</emph> work, and I know he's got things so packed in his head, that's its just as easy for him to say one thing as another. Damn such fellows-it is <emph>they</emph> who disgrace the <emph>profession,</emph> and burthen the practice of Jurisprudence with infinite uncertainty and <emph>disgust.</emph>"</p>

               <p>"Templeten," remarked the snaky looking fellow, "what's the matter with <emph>you</emph>-you don't appear <emph>well</emph> today?"</p> 
               <p>"No, I'm not," curtly responded the student.</p> 
               <p>"I'm sick of darkening counsel."</p> 
               <p>"Ha! ha! ha!" returned the new-fledged lawyer. "<emph>You should not investigate.</emph> You know, my dear fellow, there isn't more than one in a thousand who have any business to learn, or to see <emph>beyond their nose!</emph>-it always makes them unhappy and morose to <emph>think.</emph>"</p> 
               <p>"Well, I don't know about <emph>that,</emph>" returned Templeton. "But I <emph>do</emph> know this-that it is better to be ignorant, than so legalized as never to apprehend the <emph>truth,</emph> only as it may <emph>pay.</emph> I've had enough of <emph>Law</emph>-I'm done with it-but <emph>you,</emph> 
                  <emph>you</emph> will succeed, sir. A man who can look a dozen ways at once, and twist his reason in every imaginable form, with a face so impassive that it appears a blank-<emph>must</emph> succeed."</p> 
               <p>At these words he took, from the table of Mr. Andrews, a pile of papers and disappeared into the room from which he had emerged, muttering:</p> 
               <p>"That fellow is just unscrupulous enough to draw practice-and I predict he'll have enough of it-more scoundrels knocking at his office door than he'll have time to attend to."</p> 
               <p>At this moment a female entered, in whose countenance were the traces of grief. The snaky looking individual observing at once that she was on business, slipped out of the room, mentally saying,-</p> 
               <p>"A case of divorce, or seduction-by hell! I'll have a hand in this woman's pocket, too."</p> 
               <p>"Well, Madam," remarked Andrews, as the man in green spectacles left the office.</p> 
               <p>"There's nothing <emph>well</emph> about it, sir. Oh, Mr. Andrews, protect me if you <emph>can</emph> from a brute of a husband. He is so mean and so abusive, and so suspicious, that I cannot any longer live with him!" exclaimed the female, who was no less a person than Mrs. Inconceivable. "And what is more I <emph>won't</emph> live with him!"</p> 
               <p>"We'll see about that, madam," replied Mr. Andrews, mildly. "We'll see about <emph>that.</emph> He provides you with the necessaries of life, and all things suitable to your rank-does he not?"</p> 
               <p>"Yes," responded the lady, "I suppose he does in one sense comply with the requirements of the law-but,"-</p> 
               <p>"That is enough, madam, if he complies with the requirements of the law, in any sense, you must do the same-I cannot divorce you-you must continue to live with and to bear with him."</p> 
               <p>"Why, Mr. Andrews, I am shocked at your cruelty!" vociferated Mrs. Inconceivable. "And is this the evidence of your great genius-your 'cute method-to meet a woman in distress with such counsel as <emph>this!</emph> Not <emph>one</emph> cent do I intend to pay for it-not <emph>one</emph> cent."</p> 
               <p>Andrews looked at the woman without the least emotion, and smilingly said,-</p> 
               <p>"I have no charge to make, my good lady, more than this-keep your temper, and make the best of him whom you have sworn to <emph>honor, love,</emph> and <emph>obey!</emph>"</p> 
               <p>"Out upon such insolence!" exclaimed Mrs. Inconceivable, rising imperiously from her chair. "You would have society believe you have a <emph>conscience.</emph> Bah! You see I know <emph>better</emph>-genius, indeed!"</p> 
               <p>With these words she strode to the door, and as she passed through to the entry, muttered in somewhat audible tones,-</p> 
               <p>"Parvenu! Bah!"</p> 
               <p>Andrews was altogether unmoved, and was just upon the point of taking up some evidence to examine, with the remark, "a fascinating creature," when the door again opened, and Mrs. Yellowbody, flushed with excitement, walked deliberately in, and taking a seat near the lawyer, said.</p> 
               <p>"Sir, I come to <emph>you,</emph> as a leading member of the bar, for <emph>justice;</emph> Mrs. Touchmenot and Mrs. Blowhard, and Mrs. Penniman, <emph>all three,</emph> have uttered falsehoods about me, sir, and I want them at once indicted, ay, sir, at once!"-</p> 
               <p>"Well, madam, what have they said, and what can you prove?" interrogated the lawyer, in his usually bland manner.</p> 
               <p>"Prove!" reiterated the lady. "I don't know as I<pb n="276-277" xml:id="VAC6064-00000139"/> can <emph>prove</emph> anything, but I know very well what they have said."</p> 
               <p>"Well, what have they said?" interrogated the man of law, sharply.</p> 
               <p>"Just read these anonymous letters," replied Mrs. Yellowbody. "They contain the whole story."</p> 
               <p>"Ah, madam, excuse me," returned Mr. Andrews, "but <emph>this</emph> is no <emph>evidence.</emph>"</p> 
               <p>"No evidence!" reiterated Mrs. Yellowbody. "No evidence, sir; then what in heaven's name, and the name of law and common sense, <emph>is</emph> evidence. These women have abused me-and here is the written documentary statement of the <emph>fact</emph>-for God's sake, sir, what more <emph>do</emph> you want."</p> 
               <p>Mrs. Yellowbody at this point rose from her chair, and looking boldly at the lawyer, continued,-</p> 
               <p>"I must go to some one who will comprehend my case a little better than <emph>this</emph>-who can enter into <emph>my</emph> feelings, and who will earnestly take <emph>my</emph> part."</p> 
               <p>"Well, madam, I certainly cannot object," responded Andrews. "I can only say I cannot institute any action for <emph>slander,</emph> upon <emph>any</emph> such evidence as <emph>this.</emph>"</p> 
               <p>"Well, sir, then I cannot be of any service to <emph>you,</emph>" rejoined the female, (for a lady in truth, she was not;) 'You are a timid man-that is plain to be seen. You've got a reputation, and you are not willing to take any risk of impairing it, even in the service of an old acquaintance and friend."</p> 
               <p>"Well, madam, allow me to say that I was not aware you had ever been at <emph>any</emph> time truly a friend to <emph>me,</emph>" responded our hero; "for I know who all my friends are, but as such, I regret to say I do not know <emph>you.</emph> You remember some years since, when you gave a brilliant party, and my name was proposed for acceptance, you indignantly exclaimed, I want no fellow in <emph>my</emph> house who has not the <foreign xml:lang="FRA">entr</foreign> at the residences of all our first people!"</p> 
               <p>"Well, suppose I <emph>did,</emph>" rejoined the female pettishly. "You know very well you were of little or no account at <emph>that</emph> time, whereas of <emph>late,</emph> you have done <emph>something</emph> for yourself; but if you can't make this case of mine out, <emph>pure clear slander,</emph> I begin to be <emph>distrustful</emph> of you-I begin to think you've climbed up much higher than you have any <emph>right to be</emph>-and it would not surprise me, to see you settle down, <emph>to about where you belong.</emph> I must see <emph>other</emph> counsel, for these slanderous women, I am <emph>resolved</emph> to bring to <emph>justice</emph>-that I am, sir!"</p> 
               <p>She now bade the lawyer good-day, and brushed out of his office, as he, eying her with an air of abstraction, muttered,-</p> 
               <p>"Justice, indeed! Dash my wig, but of all the bores I have known these twelve months, these two insolent women are the most preminent. If a man's reputation as <emph>counsel</emph> was dependent on <emph>them,</emph> he'd soon go to seed."</p> 
               <p>Again the door opened, and in stepped Mrs. McAlpin, formerly <hi rend="i"/>Nelly Penniman. She was pale and haggard, and nervous to a degree almost of disease. Her eye was indicative of a very excited state of mind, and her pulse beat high, as she took the hand of Andrews, who rose from his chair and cordially bade her welcome.</p> 
               <p>"Oh, sir, you will excuse, I hope, all that I or my family have ever done or said, prejudicial to your interest or dishonorable to your name," remarked Nelly, with an air of painful earnestness, and in tones of touching sorrow.</p> 
               <p>"Be seated, madam," rejoined the lawyer, with a glance, comprehending the condition of her mind. "Calm yourself, and remember the office of wisdom is to be happy."</p> 
               <p>"Happy!" reiterated Mrs. McAlpin. "Ah, sir, do not mock me-you know what my trials have been and are-and yet you counsel me to be happy-I <emph>had</emph> been so, if I had followed the suggestions of my girlhood's first delights, and not a heartless mother's pride!" And at these words she wept bitterly.</p> 
               <p>"You are so pale," rejoined Andrews, tenderly, "and you tremble-you cannot be well. Let me send for a carriage, and have you removed from my office to your home."</p> 
               <p>"Home!" reiterated Nelly. "I have no home. I am friendless and forsaken!" Her sobs were frequent, and the lawyer's sensibilities were moved in a manner he had not experienced since the death of Ida.</p> 
               <p>"No home," responded he. "Do you not reside with your mother?"</p> 
               <pb n="278-279" xml:id="VAC6064-00000140"/> 
               <p>"No, no, no," replied the grief-stricken female. "We have parted, and forever! She wearied of my complaints-and because that I spoke the anguish of my heart, she struck and cursed me! and my sister, Mrs. Donothing-she has been treated in the same manner; she, too, has left her, and <emph>forever.</emph> Ma is not at all resigned to her obscure life, and admits no one to the house but Mr. Gaseous, whose intimacy with her is shameful-and I have told her so. My father takes no notice of any of us, but lives like a hermit-in hatred of <emph>all</emph> mankind. His oaths are most fearful against you. He says <emph>you</emph> were the <emph>cause</emph> of his ruin, employing the meanest expedients and rascalities of the law to rob him of his property. Oh, Mr. Andrews, can this be so?"</p> 
               <p>"Madam, I was employed against your father, it is true," responded the lawyer; "but I first gave him the <emph>opportunity</emph> of retaining me, of which he did not <emph>see fit to avail.</emph> If he lost his property to such an amount as to <emph>fail</emph> him through <emph>my</emph> professional skill, he has <emph>himself</emph> and no one else to blame."</p> 
               <p>"He has, he has!" exclaimed Mrs. McAlpin. "Not only has his contempt of you impoverished us all, but <emph>I</emph> have doubly suffered. With <emph>you,</emph> oh, with <emph>you,</emph> how happy I should have been!"</p> 
               <p>"Dwell not upon your errors, madam," returned the lawyer. "They have done their painful work-they <emph>cannot</emph> be recalled. Had our early love been permitted an uninterrupted growth, you would not, perhaps, be now in tears, but Nelly (for such I still will call you), give not way to <emph>them.</emph> You are a <emph>woman</emph>-you have much that is noble in your nature-resolve to give it <emph>play.</emph> You have many years before you-make them <emph>useful</emph> to mankind."</p> 
               <p>"Useful-useful-to <emph>mankind?</emph>" sobbed Nelly. "How can the broken-hearted fulfil such a happy mission. Think of me-how sad my fate! abandoned by my husband, who has gone no one knows where, cursed by my mother, and unnoticed by my father-neglected by the McAlpins, and all with whom I have been on terms of friendship-how can I breast an experience like this!"</p> 
               <p>"Through trust in God!" exclaimed Andrews. "He has delivered me from beneath the feet of my foes, he will raise you yet to influence and honor, if to Him you turn-a broken and a <emph>contrite</emph> heart, O Lord! thou wilt not despise."</p> 
               <p>The features of Andrews seemed for the moment inspired with the very soul of Deity, and as Mrs. McAlpin raised her eyes to them, she appeared to forget all her grief, and with a hopeful smile she said, taking the hand of Andrews,-</p> 
               <p>"Willie (for such I still must call you), you have shamed me back to womanhood!-Who should give way to sorrow, who remembers God is <emph>just.</emph> Oh, my dear friend, how you have triumphed over me. Had it been said when I last met you at your home in Lexington, flushed as I was with pride,-of the many attentions I had received from heartless flatterers in Europe, that I should at any future time bow thus to you, I should have repelled the prediction with scorn! but as it is, I exult in your friendship, and I revere those splendid talents which have so nobly vindicated your pretensions to gentle blood. One hair of your head has more of manhood, and of <emph>true</emph> respectability, than the entire bodies of a dozen James McAlpins!"</p> 
               <p>"Ah, Nelly," rejoined our hero. "Your-"</p> 
               <p>"No, I'm not too lavish of my praise," interrupted Mrs. McAlpin, her whole countenance being animated by the presence and charming manners of her early love. "I have <emph>lived</emph> with him, and know him <emph>thoroughly. Experience</emph> may be <emph>trusted.</emph>"</p> 
               <p>"It <emph>may,</emph>" returned Andrews. "It is the lamp by which all should ever be guided. You must get up your health-you do not look at all <emph>well.</emph>"</p> 
               <p>"Sorrow and a hopeless future, have nearly destroyed me. What think you I had resolved to do?"</p> 
               <p>"I cannot divine," replied the lawyer. "Reckless women sometimes do desperate deeds."</p> 
               <p>"In hatred of all things, myself and sister had determined to enter a convent and to take the veil," rejoined Nelly, with an air of marked determination.</p> 
               <p>"Monstrous!" exclaimed our hero, "Monstrous! the saddest hour of your life would have been your passage to such a tomb-a living death, indeed."</p> 
               <pb n="280-281" xml:id="VAC6064-00000141"/> 
               <p>"Ay!" exclaimed Mrs. McAlpin. "I see it <emph>now,</emph> I see it <emph>now.</emph> No, I will not like a craven sneak away from the battle-field of life, into such a romantic den of tame and impassive excellence, but struggling for new vigor, I will die with harness on, and court the opposition of mankind. Andrews, what shall I do?"</p> 
               <p>"Go among the heathen and carry to them the religion of Christ!" replied Andrews, as his eye gleamed with emotion.</p> 
               <p>"Thank Heaven, at length, my mission has been named!" exclaimed Mrs. McAlpin. "A thousand thanks for opening the way to me, of usefulness and joy," and as she uttered these words she grasped convulsively his hand and pressed it closely to her bosom. "My sister and myself will to this work at once, and those who have heretofore known us only as 'flippant fools,' shall <emph>hereafter</emph> honor us as the heroines of truth-as earnest, contrite faithful <emph>women,</emph> and followers of that cross which inspirited the apostles to superhuman labors, and an Ignatius Loyola, to achieve a name in history, that is among the most wonderful in <emph>activity</emph> of genius."</p> 
               <p>"In whatever way I may promote the object of your life-this noble charity! I shall be only too happy to serve," rejoined our hero. "May God bless your labors. To all who have not the knowledge of the Gospel, no more lovely and necessary toil can be endured than carrying it to them; for the degradations of superstitions are fearful to behold."</p> 
               <p>"To this cause shall our lives exclusively be devoted," returned Mrs. McAlpin-her eyes sparkling with hope. "The future lies before me as an extensive field, richly packed with its waving golden grain, all ready for the reapers-and soon we shall have our places; and if in parting with you, my noble friend, we never meet again, even as you were first in my early love, so shall you be last among the memories of my dying hour."</p> 
               <p>A tear filled the eyes both of Nelly and Mr. Andrews, who, moved by the singularly marked change in her character, drew her by the hand to his side, and kissed her pallid brow.</p> 
               <p>"Thus," said he, "do I affix the seal of love to our renewed newed bond of friendship and confidence; and so long as I shall live, in whatever quarter of the world you are, know that I shall ever bear within this beating bosom a brother's interest in your welfare, and shall ever be ready to perform a brother's obligations."</p> 
               <p>Nelly was so much agitated by the happiness of this hour, that she could not speak, but grasping the hand of our hero, she placed it to her quivering lips, and as the tears ran freely from her eyes, she covered it with kisses. Recovering somewhat from her excitement, she raised her deep, blue, penetrating, large, serious eyes, to the placid, handsome, spiritually severe, countenance of our hero, and said,-</p> 
               <p>"No one but <emph>God</emph> can know the hope and joy that's <emph>here,</emph>" and as she spoke, she placed her small and graceful hand upon her bosom. "The prospect which I <emph>now</emph> have, so new to me, of redeeming years of folly; by serving justice, humanity, and love, fills me with rapture, which makes musical my soul. It seems as though I could fly on the wings of that ecstasy that regulates and ennobles my thoughts, and guides my understanding."</p> 
               <p>At this moment a burly, red-faced man, about forty years of age, cautiously entered the office, and respectfully bowing to Mr. Andrews, seated himself on a chair by the window, with his keen gray eyes riveted on the slender, graceful form of Mrs. McAlpin, who at once moved towards the door followed by our hero:-as he parted with her in the entry, he said,-</p> 
               <p>"Swerve not from thy purpose; forgive thy mother, and peace will be forever the anchor of thy soul!"</p> 
               <p>Goodness was the mainspring of all the lawyer's actions-and he was, perhaps, as much admired for his conscientiousness as for his wit. Retaking his position by the table, he turned to the person by the window, and fixing his eye pointedly on him, said pleasantly,-</p> 
               <p>"Can I serve you, sir?"</p> 
               <p>"I don't know but you can," responded the keen, grayeyed man. "I've got into hot water,-"</p> 
               <p>"You want some one to pull you out, of course," interrupted the lawyer.</p> 
               <p>"Well, I <emph>do,</emph> right bad," rejoined the visitor. "I want<pb n="282-283" xml:id="VAC6064-00000142"/> to be carried clean through this scrape as though nothing had happened. I can <emph>pay</emph> for this privilege, and I've been told, you are just the man to serve me."</p> 
               <p>"Well, sir, I must <emph>first</emph> know something about the facts or circumstances of your case, before I can hint even an opinion," rejoined Andrews, in measured speech, and with a serious air. "You speak of a scrape-now, sir, this is not exactly <emph>my</emph> line of practice-to get men out of scrapes, <emph>unless</emph> the evidence they may furnish of their innocence, is <emph>conclusive!</emph> and free from <emph>all</emph> suspicion of being manufactured for the case. I will not lend my mind or my voice to any such proceedings. I am a minister of <emph>Justice</emph>-a sworn officer of our courts. I am ready to serve you, if you are innocent of any and all crime, and can arm me with witnesses and testimony to <emph>prove</emph> the fact, but I will not undertake to wrest you from the penalty of the law, if you have <emph>wittingly</emph> incurred it."</p> 
               <p>The burly red-haired man scratched his head, and looking at the lawyer with amazement, exclaimed,-</p> 
               <p>"My dear sir, I don't want to run through anything which is <emph>unusual.</emph> I have some evidence, which, <emph>properly</emph> managed, will do me good service, and I am willing to <emph>pay,</emph> and that too, devilish well, any man who will treat my case in a <emph>lawyer-like manner.</emph> I don't say that I have not <emph>wittingly</emph> run against the <emph>law,</emph> but <emph>I do</emph> say that I have offended in <emph>no</emph> manner more criminal than hundreds and hundreds do daily, who are passed harmlessly through the courts!"</p> 
               <p>"Let me be the judge of that, sir, at least, if you please," returned Andrews, sharply. "I am quite conversant with the business of the courts, and I cannot consent to accept of such a statement as <emph>true</emph> until <emph>I know</emph> the fact. State your case, and then I shall be able to form some view of it,-some <emph>opinion.</emph>"</p> 
               <p>"It's no use, sir, I see you are no <emph>criminal</emph> lawyer," returned the man near the window. "You have no <emph>nerve</emph> for such evidence as I shall have to offer. Why, sir, if all the bar should accept of none but the <emph>best</emph> business, to which <emph>you</emph> appear to aspire-they'd soon be in 'tight places,' and would be employing each other to work up a fiction for them, a damn sight more atrocious than any <emph>I</emph>
                   should require of you. You've got a reputation, haven't you, for <emph>honesty,</emph> and you want to <emph>keep</emph> it-don't you?-Good boy-you can go up in your class, for <emph>nobody</emph> wants the place."</p> 
               <p>As the burly man said this, he was standing by the entry door, with the deep flashing eye of the acute, and conscientious lawyer full upon him-he felt and feared its power!</p> 
               <p>"D-n the law!" he muttered, as he now passed from the office, with a scowl upon his face, and fearful passion in his eye and lips.</p> 
               <p>"Poor fellow," remarked Andrews, as his visitor left his presence. "Poor fellow! I <emph>feel</emph> for him. I know he has a hard case, or he would not treat me in this manner. But I cannot, <emph>will</emph> not, engage to defend those, who have not such evidence as I can conscientiously present to a court and jury. I will not <emph>knowingly</emph> cheat the law of its just demands. If men get into <emph>scrapes</emph> by criminal acts-<emph>I</emph> shall never interpose to shield them from the consequences of their <emph>own deliberate</emph> determinations-they <emph>must</emph> be punished-the law <emph>must</emph> be a verity-it is <emph>my</emph> mission to see that it <emph>is;</emph> and by the Olympean Jupiter! I <emph>will</emph> not be recreant to my duty-which first to God I owe, and next to <emph>man!</emph> There is no happiness in labor which demoralizes alike those who perform it, and those who are recipients of its benefits. The indiscriminate defence of right and wrong is doing <emph>violence</emph> to nature! and she will not be outraged <emph>persistently,</emph> without terrible judgments upon those who dare this ceaseless abuse. There <emph>is a right,</emph> there <emph>is a wrong</emph> to <emph>every</emph> question! and however confused these grand departments of thought may be by <emph>authorities</emph>-they are ever well defined, and are ever earnest in their operations in the hearts of all mankind-who believe in a God, in virtue, and a happy hereafter.</p> 
               <p>"Years, ah, sad and laborious years! have I devotedly studied the wisdom of men in the various walks of meditation, which have for so many ages been open to the studious and <emph>profound.</emph> But in them <emph>all</emph> I find no thought so beautiful as <emph>conscience!</emph> and no study so sublime! and this I <emph>know,</emph> that <emph>it,</emph> and it alone, can <emph>perfect</emph> laws, and<pb n="284-285" xml:id="VAC6064-00000143"/> merge this life in that of Heaven! Learning, however pleasant to man's pride, is, when accumulated in too vast a store, unfriendly to his happiness and the full operation of that delicate sense of justice which is so curtly and yet so acceptably expressed as the corner-stone of Christian ethics-' Do unto others as you would be done by!' Upon this simple, though God-given principle, properly are based, the stupendous fabric of that thought, which governs, through human tribunals, the intercourse of mankind. Perish, O perish, those base natures, who, from such a pure and sparkling spring of <emph>right,</emph> would artificially construct those dark and damning streams of <emph>injustice</emph> and wrong! whose bitter waters no inhabitant of earth is not sooner or later in the course of life's toilsome pilgrimage, <emph>compelled to taste.</emph>
               </p> 
               <p>"Law is not <emph>necessarily</emph> a bottomless pit-a dark and insoluble problem; but only as it is made so by the vanity and infamous caprice of man! The sun shines ever the same-its genial warmth, its friendly rays, will uplift the heart depressed by care and sorrow, from its dark depths of seriousness and despair; so might law diffuse universal hope and joy, would men who engage in its <emph>practice</emph> recognize <emph>some</emph> system of mental philosophy as <emph>just and true!</emph> until which happy time neither <emph>laws,</emph> nor <emph>morals,</emph> nor <emph>natural religion</emph> can rest upon a <emph>scientific</emph> foundation! and give thereby to education, political economy, and legislation, both stability and precision! No one who has peered into the lower stratas of human thought, and so upward made his way, has failed to be impressed with the equivocal nature of knowledge and the profound mystery which hangs over the essences of things-from whence proceeds the fearful confusion of which injustice is born! In the vast objects of nature, we may perceive most wonderful phenomena, and the relations subsisting between them, but as a matter of <emph>direct</emph> perception, here, alas! our vision ends.</p> 
               <p>"And in the moral world, when we ignore the life and ethics of Jesus, we see nothing but contradictions, weakness, and woe!"</p> 
               <p>At this moment the door again opened, and a man with a sallow, dark, and intelligent countenance, said hurriedly,-</p> 
                
               <p>"The court is waiting for you, sir; they are ready for your argument."</p> 
               <p>Andrews, taking his hat in his hand, and putting a file of papers in his coat pocket, walked, unaffected by the haste of his junior, from his office to the court-house, where he made one of the most brilliant arguments in a case that had long been on trial, where a mother had sued for the custody of an only child. His eloquence was irresistible, and there was not a tearless eye in that room, crowded with an interested and excited audience, as he sketched a mother's love for, and hopes in, that which had been nurtured into life by her blood, and had lain in her bosom. Here, surrounded by the ablest jurists in the State, and in the full expression of his genius, which all acknowledged and respected, we leave our hero for the study of those who have no friends to lift them to honors, but their own virtues and unconquerable will. Do as <emph>he</emph> has done, and proudly, though respectfully, wear the wreath of Fame.</p>

                     <p>She reformed not in vain!</p>
                  </q> 
               </epigraph> 
               <p>IRENE CARUTHERS (to whom we last referred in chapter fifteenth, where the reader will remember a letter is recorded from her to Agnes Farriday), continued to live happily with her husband, Mr. Frazar, in a beautiful, quiet residence just out of Philadelphia, where Mr. Frazar was engaged in lucrative business, and where she had ample leisure to devote to the object nearest her heart, viz., the charity of <emph>love</emph> towards those women, who, having become profligate, desire <emph>sincerely</emph> to reform!</p> 
               <p>With Mrs. Andrews she was in almost daily correspondence, and she sought by every means in her power to assure her noble friend of her unceasing gratitude; frequently she sent her valuable presents, and they visited each other often.</p> 
               <p>As Mrs. Andrews had been and continued to be the friend of the harlot, so Mrs. Frazar would rival her goodness in this noble charity.</p> 
               <p>She left no stone unturned to discover and to bring under her sweet influence those women who (even as she had once been lost) were now passing away their lives wretchedly, in practices disgraceful and most disgusting, but prayerful to Heaven for some effectual means of deliverance!</p> 
               <p>To such, Mrs. Frazar soon found her way, and the gentle influences of her ardent sympathies and unaffected benevolence met in nearly every instance with a hearty response from these miserable, sin-broken and sin-disgusted women!</p> 
               <p>They poured into her ears the sorrows of bosoms whereon were heads too frequently laid, whose hearts were swept of every pure intention, and whose minds and bodies were foul with passion and disease. To such, the crime-wearied harlot could speak only lasciviously, for they associated women with no other sentiment, and sought her companionship for base pleasures and excesses alone! But from these debauched and sensual and God-defying men, the love and protection of Mrs. Frazar was a safe refuge indeed, and never was it sought in vain! If woman is worthy to be loved, she is worthy, when overwhelmed by errors, to be taken kindly and earnestly by the hand, and assisted out of her sorrow and her shame; and if the Bible has one lesson more beautiful than another, it is that inculcated by Christ himself-"Woman, neither do I condemn thee; go, and sin no more." There are those who are ever ready to throw stones at you, whether virtuous or otherwise. You cannot escape calumny, however meritorious may be your life; but utterly impossible is it for you, when abandoned to the arts of prostitution, to reclaim <emph>yourselves</emph> from its unspeakable horrors (so meanly does the scorn of a heartless society meet you at every step), without the ministrations of such offices as an Agnes Farriday and Irene Caruthers, inspired with a divine sense of your needs, can bestow, understandingly, upon you. The hand of such women you may grasp with confidence; for, however honored you may feel by <emph>their</emph> love, be assured you are no more honored by it than they are honored by your trust in <emph>them!</emph> They know your weaknesses; they fully appreciate the temptations which have led you astray; they know that your willingness to reform your habits of <emph>crime</emph> is the result of the workings of a spirit far above your condition-and to that spirit they cling; and if it shall cling to them, the result cannot be otherwise than honorable to human nature and most pleasing to God; for there is more joy in heaven over one sinner that repenteth, than over ninety and nine who need no repentance; and that mind and heart which can bring an erring one back to God and virtue, and that mind and heart which is willing to be so led, is a fact in our daily life, which cannot but impress the thoughtful profoundly! While earth contains even but few such, there is hope for <emph>man.</emph>
               </p> 
               <p>
                  <emph>There are enough ever ready to sneer at all manner of reforms.</emph> Devoid of nearly all trust in human nature, they conceive that a person <emph>once</emph> abandoned to criminal practices, if reformed by the kindly influences of <emph>charity,</emph> will gravitate towards those practices in the majority of cases, and become more abandoned than at first; and so believing from<pb n="288-289" xml:id="VAC6064-00000145"/> the hardness and wickedness of their own hearts, they treat with contempt reformers of every name and nature, and speak of the "Harlot's Friend" with derision and disgust! But it is a pleasant reflection that His mighty providences do not rest with <emph>these,</emph> but are bound up in those impassioned bosoms, wherein "one touch of nature makes the whole world kin!"</p> 
               <p>Irene Caruthers, now Mrs. Frazar, as we have learned in a previous chapter, impulsive and thoughtless, betrothed herself, against the wishes of her parents, to a gay, handsome, and reckless fellow from New York, who had promised to marry her on their arrival there from her home in New Hampshire, where she was tenderly cared for and dearly loved, and which she foolishly abandoned for <emph>his</emph> protection, thinking to be more free and happy in <emph>his</emph> care and <emph>affections</emph> than in that of her doting parents. Besides, such an adventure had many charms for <emph>her;</emph> it was a <emph>new</emph> life, full of new hopes, and pleasant imaginings.</p> 
               <p>But he in whom her trust was reposed married her, and then deserted her! A desperate and unprincipled libertine, he regarded woman in no other light than as an object of mere sense, to be courted, ruined, and then cast aside! Irene, left destitute by this deceiver (one of a class of men whom women are too well pleased to flatter in instances by far too numerous), knew not what to do. She was too proud to return to her abandoned home; she felt she had wronged the best of parents, and she felt unworthy of their forgiveness, and unwilling to stoop to ask it. In this sad position, and plunged in all the bitterness of woe by these desperate feelings, she accepted the friendship and keeping of a man who pitied her sorrows, but who would not espouse her; preferring to use her as a mistress, to be cast off whenever it might suit his fancy to engage with another.</p> 
               <p>She was destitute, with the education and the feelings of a lady, without the health or the skill for <emph>industry!</emph> She begged of the man who offered her the position of a <emph>mistress,</emph> to raise her to an equality with him, by making her his wife; but he ridiculed the idea, remarking that, "social position being supported by wealth, no woman could enter with him its golden circles upon any <emph>mere consideration of her love, or her beauty, or any other natural charms;</emph> she must have <emph>money,</emph>-the only solid advantage in American life!" And to such a man as <emph>this</emph> did circumstances compel Irene Caruthers to prostitute her honor with her body, for protection and bread! It was not a marriage, but it was at least as reputable a transaction as too many of the fashionable marriages of the present day! And <emph>such</emph> characters, my readers, are termed <emph>men!</emph> Look at life, and you will see them strutting about with a consequential step, an air of command, and <emph>an indifference to public opinion,</emph> that will make your blood (if your spirit is one of truth) leap with indignation through your veins.</p> 
               <p>Selfish, heartless, Christless, having no aspirations beyond this life, sensual and animal, without the consciousness of any other than a physical organization, with no visions of God and eternity, of judgment, and rebuke, and condemnation, neither having any conception of those duties which arise from such realities impressed upon the soul,-they live and vegetate, and wallow in their lust, and drag down to their base sphere the noble impulses and generous aspirations of high-hearted woman; doubtless, too often happy in their attachment to such lovers, and too willing to cast their lot and lives with them, but, to the honor of the sex be it said, more frequently declining, <emph>even their acquaintance,</emph> and rather than accept a support from their evil passions, bravely and desperately essay to support themselves honorably as <emph>teachers,</emph> as artists, as needle-women, nurses, and at almost anything which will give them <emph>honest bread!</emph> God bless such women! While the earth shall receive them from honorable wombs, the cause of Christ is not and cannot be lost to mankind!</p> 
               <p>The beautiful and true are with <emph>them!</emph> All that is chaste, eloquent, Godlike, and sublime, nature has placed within the precious casket of their beings; and, when they are wooed and won these virtues are transmitted in all their freshness and glory to succeeding times. They realize their mission-they are true to it; for they live in the spirit of God; while the base and the sensual world moves on, with no thoughts beyond its carnal appetites, and no hopes beyond its five animal senses of seeing, hearing, tasting, feeling, and smelling. <emph>Money</emph> and its power of gratifying these senses is the great idea of "animal existence," and<pb n="290-291" xml:id="VAC6064-00000146"/> to the getting of it, they "devote their entire energies." By fair means, if possible, but by foul, if necessary, <emph>money must be had.</emph> And to this idea woman must bend at the bidding of these "ale-guzzling, beef-eating" masters, if she would <emph>enjoy their protection and their love!</emph> O, Jesu! "name it not in Gath, tell it not in Ascalon."These are your" hearty men of <emph>active life!</emph>"-the men who <emph>rule!</emph> Heaven defend us from their reign! for too often prostitution, seduction, and every evil known to the law, attend upon their brutal and unbridled passions, from which no woman can escape, who <emph>has once submitted,</emph> unless some "good angel," even as an Agnes Farriday, extend the hand of love (as in the case of Irene Caruthers), in the noble and truly womanly mission of "the Harlot's Friend!"</p> 
               <p>Thus redeemed, she may again hold up her head in the honest pride of truth and power! and, even as Irene, become the savior and refuge of others lost in error and in crime!</p>

               <p>THUS far in his career William Andrews had had but one bosom friend among his fellow men-and he was <hi rend="i"/>Hamilton, whom the Pennimans so much despised for the part which he had played at the famous wedding. But Andrews loved him-and of this <emph>assured,</emph> Hamilton cared not who disliked his character. Lucy Atlay had always been a friend of more than ordinary interest to our hero, and as his engagement and marriage to Agnes had fixed his matrimonial state for years, perhaps, to come, he was anxious that so noble a heart and accomplished an intellect as Lucy's should be united to a man capable of appreciating them, and altogether worthy of her confidence. To Hamilton, therefore, he assigned the happiness of her love, and that he might succeed in winning it, our hero used all the powers of his rhetoric to inspire her with a trust in, and preference for, his friend-nor did he endeavor in vain, as she had some time since engaged herself to Hamilton, with the consent of her parents, who <emph>now</emph> loved and honored him as much as they had once feared and suspected him. He had studied <emph>medicine</emph> and surgery under the fascinating spell of Lucy's affection and care, and had succeeded in establishing himself in a lucrative practice in one of the neighboring towns. He was soon to marry her, and they were to live here in a beautiful house, not large, but elegant in all its arrangements, presented to them by the lady's father.</p> 
               <p>Agnes and Lucy were the best of friends, and equalled in their admiration for and attachment to each other, the loves and fidelity of Hamilton and Andrews. Lucy would freely express those preferences which she had entertained for Andrews, and did not hesitate to tell Agnes, "she thought<pb n="292-293" xml:id="VAC6064-00000147"/> she had the most perfect man for a husband in the wide, wide world;" and she would add, "if I were not a Christian, I should give you no peace, from my envy and jealousy of your great good fortune."</p> 
               <p>Agnes would laugh heartily at her friend, and say in a sprightly manner,-</p> 
               <p>"If you had only my charms, my eyes, my everything, you might have been in <emph>my</emph> shoes, but <emph>do</emph> you think you would have worn them without <emph>pain.</emph> Ah, no, no, love; to be the confident and companion (as has been decreed to me) of such a nature as is my husband's, is no <emph>unbroken</emph> joy, for there are times when one's suspicions of their incompetency, comes rolling in fearful surges on the soul, and a sense of weariness <emph>oppresses.</emph> The intimacy of <emph>love</emph>-of "two hearts which beat as <emph>one</emph>"-has indeed its <emph>perils,</emph> and she who mates with <emph>genius,</emph> trembles ofttimes in the vivid reality of what perchance <emph>may</emph> come,-how she shall bear herself from day to day-so mingle with his mind, and blunt the sharpness of his cares, as yet to <emph>please,</emph> and never to distract, <emph>annoy.</emph> To <emph>do this</emph>-and do it <emph>well</emph>-is no <emph>slight</emph> duty; and were it not that I so much admire and truly love your <emph>sympathetic</emph> nature, I might in punishment of your envious state, consign you for a twelve month to <emph>my</emph> station; and, though o'ermuch your love for him whose talents could place you here, your heart at times <emph>would</emph> feel <emph>unrest,</emph> impatient of its burthen-for love, say what you will, <emph>is</emph> burthensome, and where most we women feel our loves to be, <emph>therefrom we draw much pain.</emph> Ah, this is life, and <emph>this</emph> it is we seek so <emph>ardently.</emph>" Thus would these beauties talk, for they <emph>were</emph> beauties, not formed by <emph>art,</emph> but moulded by the hand of <emph>nature!</emph>
               </p> 
               <p>The Pennimans, the Blowhards and the Yellowbodies, and many others, who, "for various reasons, disliked the Atlays," were unceasing in their ill-natured remarks upon her engagement, to so handsome and promising a young man as Hamilton, whose family was one of the most favorably known in the country for genius and renown! The Catchpennys had been unsparing of abuse; but since the favors, which had been so liberally bestowed upon them by our hero, they had repented of their misdoings and missayings sayings, and had lavished upon the Atlays, as the esteemed friends of Mr. Andrews, every conceivable praise; and that they might appear the more deeply to regret having spoken at any time unkindly of this family, they sent them a note expressive of their humiliation at having given way to mean passions, and for having under <emph>their</emph> dictation used most unfair and shameful language, as respects their characters and position. This was quite satisfactory to the Atlays, who willingly bore no ill-will towards any of the great <emph>brotherhood of man.</emph> They even assured the Catchpennys of their sincere sorrow, that there should have been at any time a variance, or an unkind feeling between them; and that in future they should esteem them as worthy friends.</p> 
               <p>Now, that it was generally known that "some noble spirit" had placed in the hands of Mr. Catchpenny the means of restablishing himself in business, the Atlays seized at once upon the occasion to express their deep sense of pleasure at their charming fortune, and sincerely hoped that they would not be again put to the <emph>inconveniences</emph> of poverty! Who this noble spirit was, nobody appeared to know, since Andrews had exacted from the Catchpennys the solemn promise <emph>never</emph> to mention his name in connection with their renewed prosperity-and faithful to their pledge of secrecy, they kept all to themselves.</p> 
               <p>Lucy Atlay in a few days was to be <emph>married,</emph> and she was busily engaged in getting ready for that solemn and fascinating undertaking; for marriage <emph>is</emph> an undertaking, say what those who make light of it, may. It is a tie, a gordian knot, which is most difficult to be cut-its beginning, though easily found, (and in this, unlike that of Gordius,) yet its ending is not so easy to be known. Still, it has its <emph>charms,</emph> and there will ever be those, who, for the sake of enjoying the sweet bondage of matrimony, will court its golden chains. We say, God speed them!-they take a risk, but it is a <emph>lawful</emph> risk, it is an exciting risk, a daring risk if you will, and surely if disaster come therefrom, who are more worthy of martyrdom than those inviting peril. We believe in marriage-we heartily recommend it to all those who have the <emph>nerve</emph> for it-who have the <emph>taste</emph> for it-the sense, the skill, the adaptation,<pb n="294-295" xml:id="VAC6064-00000148"/> the patience, and that host of other requisites so indispensable in the safe conduct of such a life-long partnership-such an engrossing fact! It is an institution founded upon the noblest confidence of the human breast; it is a theory of surpassing beauty and captivating romance; nor would it <emph>ever fail</emph> of the benevolent ends which called it into being, if only those should come within its charge, whom God and nature (not a sordid, brutal, worldly policy) had prompted to combine. Ah, here is a truth more precious than <emph>all</emph> truth save that of <emph>Revelation,</emph> yet 'tis hissed and scorned and throttled by even those who seek most earnestly, and pay most liberally for the gem of happiness.</p> 
               <p>And who will say that man is not at least in <emph>this</emph> a fool, when he wilfully builds with falsehood, though truth lies ready at his hand! The brute led by instinct only, makes no vice of love, while men endowed with apprehension so like a God! confound it with things <emph>unreal;</emph> and of that sentiment so holy, and so freighted with the destinies of life, make endless wretchedness, irreligion, wrong. When <emph>love</emph> on earth shall do its office, uncontrolled by avarice, pride, hypocrisy, and cunning, then will <emph>marriage</emph> be a covenant of peace, improvement, <emph>real and lasting pleasure!</emph> and then will children <emph>honor and obey,</emph> and then will Justice rise from out the filth of policy, and purified, regain its throne. Haste, oh haste, ye coming days-and remove this foul social leprosy-whose hateful spots so painfully disfigure virtue and truth, even in the womb!</p> 
               <p>As we have intimated, Lucy Atlay was preparing for the trials and the joys of married life. She loved and was <emph>beloved;</emph> she felt, <emph>with</emph> Hamilton, she should be more happy than <emph>alone.</emph> And now as she walks by his side, (her arm in his, her head slightly bent towards his shoulder) up the broad aisle of the church, at whose baptismal font she was christened, and at whose altar she had been confirmed, and had first partaken of that bread of life, which is so beautifully typified in the commemoration of the Lord's Supper, she seemed conscious of <emph>no</emph> fear, and apprehensive of <emph>no</emph> sorrow.</p> 
               <p>Within her light brown hair was placed a rose, as white as the gorgeous vail which dropped from the back of her head over her shoulders, mingling with the folds of a white laced dress, beneath which was a costly satin. Upon her bosom, that heaved with the hopes and delights of her mind was spread the most delicate silk gauze. Her eye was clear and brilliant and musical with power, which, as she passed along through the church, crowded with the most reputable of citizens, was modestly cast downward to avoid the general gaze. Many were the expressions of admiration, and many the envious jest that escaped the lips of those persons whose vision was dazzled by a sight so artistic and yet at all points so true to nature. The marriage consummated, the clergyman shook cordially by the hand the bride and the bridegroom, and after a few words of friendly greeting, withdrew from the altar, while Hamilton and Lucy repast the aisle, and disappeared from the gaze of the crowd which had assembled to witness the ceremony. There were many of that number who gladly, if they could, would put "asunder what God had joined together;" and whilst they could not suppress their belief that "a finer looking couple had never been united at that altar," they would seize the first opportunity of dashing from their lips the cup of happiness which this day's act had placed there, attended with none of the exclusiveness of McAlpin's wedding, nor none of its mortification; no lamp-black hand was there, no tongue, ominously to whisper "damnation to come." Both Hamilton and Lucy thought, if Christ could go among the money-changers of the temple, and into the high-ways and by-ways-<emph>they</emph> need have no dread of the strong breath of the multitude-but should meet them face to face at the altar of the Father and God of all.</p> 
               <p>They recognized no especial virtue in rank as <emph>rank,</emph> but believed the noble impulse and the heaven aspiring spirit dwelt <emph>indiscriminately</emph> in <emph>all.</emph> They would not carry into the house of God that disgusting foppery which thanks Him "it is not as other men," and affects displeasure at the near proximity of ignorance and physical toil-they would not, because it was in their power, <emph>taboo</emph> that sacred temple to which all are invited to come, and which in apostolic times was the fountain head of confidence, magnanimity and love! The families of Hamilton and<pb n="296-297" xml:id="VAC6064-00000149"/> Andrews continued in the closest intimacy, and rarely a day passed without the meeting of Agnes and Lucy. The utmost trust-and the fairest courtesy characterized all their intercourse-they were true to their professions, and their friendship consequently <emph>endured.</emph>

               <p>OUR hero, William Andrews, had been true to himself, and he had triumphed in his purposes. The position which he <emph>now</emph> held in the estimation of the community, was far above that of the Pennimans at the height of their prosperity and pride, which was at the date of their alliance with the <emph>McAlpins.</emph> That connection had been for some time broken-and there was now no intercourse between the families. The last that was heard of Nelly's husband, were merely vague reports of his having taken up his abode with the Indians of the West, assuming their habits and costume; his wife and her sister, Mrs. Donothing, had embarked for the Sandwich Islands on their mission to the heathen, and from thence intended to pass to China and India. Mr. Donothing, broken down by dissipation, had become enfeebled in mind, and was placed in the charge of an Insane Asylum.</p> 
               <p>Mrs. Penniman, disgusted with society, was living with Gaseous in a near neighboring village, whom she had as a boarder. Persons generally laughed at the idea, and whispered strange things about this connection-they said it was scandalous-and what they did not say, derogatory to the character of Mrs. Penniman, whom nobody respected, or appeared to respect, since her downfall, was of no value on the score of detraction. She was of all women, most heartily despised. Her husband lived the life of a hermit, never having noticed her since he discovered her in the embrace of Gaseous. Recently he had taken to strange humors, and so peculiar was his manner at times, that persons competent to judge, thought him partially demented.</p> 
               <p>One dark and stormy night, when the rain poured in torrents from the low hanging clouds, and the wind blew<pb n="298-299" xml:id="VAC6064-00000150"/> fearfully, old Penniman wandered away from his room, and passing along the wharves, slipped into the water and was drowned. So terminated the miserable life of a pitiful wretch, who once rode in his carriage and damned his cook for eating dainties-who sneered at genius because it was poor, and gave his daughter to "a young man of the first respectability," who left her for the habits and manners of savages,-who can weep for him-who does not tremble at the thought of <emph>his</emph> hereafter. Artemas Bottlefly, and Edward Roundhead, who, it will be remembered, married into the Penniman family, were such "nice fellows," that they were completely hen-pecked, and having little or no capacity for business, they occupied their time with the fine arts, and in the duties of the nursery. Since the failure of old Penniman, they had moved into the country, where they lived together in a small house, and provided themselves with the necessaries of life through a small income, which Bottlefly derived from an estate in fee left him by his mother, his father having been a gay man, who ran through a large fortune. The Inconceivables, the Blowhards, and the Touchmenots, still continued in fashionable life, passing their cutting remarks on all those with whom they happened not to agree. Mrs. Inconceivable had become reconciled to her husband. Of Mrs. Penniman they said much that was excessively severe, and Gaseous they treated as "a dangerous man." The life to which Nelly and her sister, Mrs. Donothing, had devoted themselves, they declared only fit for broken down respectability, and thought a residence among the heathen just the place for <emph>them.</emph> "Bone," was still the pet of Agnes, who had taught him to be very useful in various ways-and she rarely rode into the country without taking him along with her.</p> 
               <p>Mrs. Andrews continued in excellent health and spirits, and was "as happy as happy could be," under the roof and in the love of her children; and of her grand-son, Arthur Hamilton Andrews, a handsome sprightly boy of promise, she was most proud. He was the image of his father,-a high spirited, obedient, affectionate child. Agnes cherished his virtues with all the fondness such an ardent soul as hers was capable of; and she looked forward ward confidently to the period when he would take his position among men, and speedily make his mark.</p> 
               <p>With patience, perseverance, self-reliance, and courage, Agnes and Andrews had lived down their enemies, and had made them their warmest friends. All who had once abused them, delighted now to honor, except the <emph>Touchmenots,</emph> who "would have nothing to say to the Parvenues." Mr. Catchpenny had profited by his experience, and in the good Providence of God, had succeeded in establishing a very paying business in St. Louis, where his daughters had married, and were mothers of several little Catchpennys, who were "spoiled and petted to death." They entertained a "supreme contempt for every thing Bostonfied,"-and "loved nothing with any Yankee to it, but Mr. and Mrs. Andrews, and that belonging to <emph>them.</emph>"</p> 
               <p>Irene Caruthers, who had been reclaimed by Agnes, was now the mother of two fine boys, and the wife of a man highly honored in the business circles of Philadelphia: she had never ceased her efforts in behalf of prostitution, and through her acts many a noble-hearted, misdirected woman, had been rescued from that degree in vice, from whence so few are reclaimed. She frequently wrote Agnes; who had made her several visits, and who was truly loved by her, in whose behalf she had labored so faithfully. Even as Agnes received from year to year many a reclaimed harlot's blessing, so they would bless Irene, and putting their arms about her neck, kiss her affectionately, thanking God, that in some women he had planted souls, to taste of whose fruits is to hope, to smile, to live again!</p> 
               <p>Mr. and Mrs. Sampsne still continued in Europe, and the <emph>genius</emph> she expected to furnish the world proved but a sorry specimen of humanity-having but two fingers on each hand, a hair-lip, a cross-eye, and a scrofulous humor, apparent throughout his body. Hamilton and his wife continued most happy in their love-and were ever true to Andrews. And so the world wagged, in the times of these personages and events.</p> 
               <p>As Andrews surveyed the past, and saw how, step by step, he had ascended the steep of fame, where the highest<pb n="300-301" xml:id="VAC6064-00000151"/> honors to which an American citizen can aspire, had been tendered him, he would often recur to the memory of his beloved father, and to his noble charge, when he sought his counsel, at a time when his youthful haughty spirit had been bruised by the rough treatment of the Pennimans, on whom he had determined to be avenged. "Let your life, my noble boy," said he, "your goodness and virtue, be your revenge! Go on with a thorough intellectual training, aspire to become a man of influence, and when you have won for yourself a <emph>position,</emph> let the world see, and the Pennimans in particular, that the insult offered to your youth, has been wiped away by the glory of your manhood! Make them to feel you were never their inferior, and that the name of Andrews, as borne by <emph>you,</emph> hath a respect paid it, which neither the name nor the gold of the whole race of <emph>Pennimans</emph> could confer. Be this the object of your life; struggle manfully to attain it, and a vengeance is yours, more galling to these proud God-defying people, than aught you could possibly do, by street attack or satire."</p> 
               <p>He often thought of these words of his honored parent, and great was his satisfaction to know, that he had fully realized his command. It was the purpose of his life to achieve such honors as should at once humilitate his enemies and vindicate his name from the charge of mediocrity. By day and by night he nursed this noble ambition-this firm, unconquerable resolve: and many a time had he, starting from his sleep, exclaimed, "I have them beneath my feet-they-the wretches, who spurned me as plebeian! They shall feel and fear my power, they shall know true worth when trod upon, can will and can dare success-and win a lasting fame."</p> 
               <p>Here, was indeed a triumph, of marked merit over imbecility and pretension. Would that such a triumph could be recorded <emph>daily,</emph> that those who "put on airs," and set themselves up as "patterns of propriety, models of good taste," and "gentle blood," (looking with scorn at all those with whom they do not happen to associate), might have this lesson deeply impressed on their minds, viz., that there are many <hi rend="i"/>Willie Andrews and <hi rend="i"/>Agnes Farridays in the world, who <emph>will</emph>
                   rise under any and every pressure of sneering foppery! and that to be honored in "modern Athens," is not necessarily to be inhuman, exclusive, and highly polished with that impudence which delights in pushing its way to positions where its follies are so much the more glaring, and its meannesses are so much the more base!</p> 
               <p>Nor to be honored in "modern Athens," or elsewhere upon the face of God's green earth, by the noble and the true, is it in any manner necessary, or expected, that the <emph>fallen woman</emph> should be left to her shame-naked and broken-hearted, hopeless and self-condemned to the sneers and malignity of her enemies. And if, in presenting to the public a view in part of her life, her sorrows, contrition, and repentance, we have caused even <emph>one</emph> poor, forsaken, and misguided woman to pause in her career of crime, and to hope for another and a better state of being even in this world, we shall not have written in vain; and many there may be to honor the hero and bless the heroine of this tale-Agnes Farriday, the Harlot's Friend! <q>
