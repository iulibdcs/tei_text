KIND READER: You may think that I have chosen a singular? name for the collection which I now give you in book form; but is it not good to seek to glorify common things? And though  The Mayweed is a bitter herb, A humble whyside flower, With neither form nor fragrance To grace a regal bower; A comnmon, vulgar, wayside weed, That few would ever pause to heed; Yet deep within its heart of gold The sunbeams love to play, And from its petals purely white Comes the unbroken ray Which gives the colors all in one, Reflecting all, retaining none.

WHEN the sunlight bursts forth in its bright- ness, or the rainbow arches the clouds, my soul leaps with gladness, and I think, "Who so happy as I? Who so much cause for rejoicing? But when the clouds return after the rain, and the chilling winds cause my sensitive spirit to shrink within itself, I feel like exclaiming, " O, ye that pass by, turn and see if there is any sorrow like unto my sorrow!" It was upon such' a time as this that I wandered forth and sat me down upon a friendly log, by the side of which grew the homely Mayweed.  "Just like my en- tire life,"'said I, as I looked upon its familiar face; "unattractive without and bitter within; no sweetness, no beauty, covered with dust, and trampled under foot' in the highway." But as I thus pondered, a busy bee paused in its onward flight to salute the humble weed, "   &#xD;<pb n="12-13" xml:id="VAC8168-00000007"/> q2    ilIAY WEED BLOSSOMS.  while a voice, that seemed to issue therefrom, said,  W\lere there no sweetness the bee would not tarry in its flight, and as fo the beauty, wait." Surprise changed  the current of :my thoughts, and forgetting my sorrow,   i I listened intently for more, and lo! I wa taken back t, the very morning of m1y childtcmea The simple weed seed d possessed of clairvoyance, for it told me of the timne when I had pressed its kindred beneath my little feet, as I made my way for the first time to the portico of a-b-c-dom, and there was no sorrow in the recollection. Ah, the very spirit of May- weed! I could fancy it to have stepped forth from the form, and to be leading my spirit over the pathw y of that life of whichh I had spoken so bitterly. Back and forth we went over the devious windings of that sumimer at school. "ee here," said my guide; do you remen- ber this creek, by the side of which you used to play, brineging moss from the woods to arpet the sand; the floor of the play-hoiuse, and to make a bed for dolly, decking the whole-with the scarlet berries that grew beneath the pines?" Just here came the thought of the day I played in that sanme creek till' the teacher had to wrap me in her shawl while she dried my clothes. Well, I suppose it was not quite so pleasant in the tihme of it, but I question if the delight of paddling in the liquid crystal did not fully compensate for the annoy- ance of the' wise sayings of, 9 See what little girls get by being naughty," etc., etc. If not, I am sure thtt the laughs 1. have had-since, in reference thereto, have more than maide up the deficiency. No, there was no sorrowin te recllectio of those yers. What cared I for poverty? The trees and the flowers were as beau-    ,'     .fUl A' TRlA T  WJWIED SAID. . 1 13 tiful to me as to the richest; the broad earth was as green, and the blue heavens as bright; and then, in my grandfather's home, where I was privileged to .stay through that, my four-year-old su&amp;ner, -a very un- pretending lwelling by the way, but to me wonderful, -within was comfort, and without the glorious old pear trees, the big sweet apple tree that alhnst tossed its fruit into our bedroom window, with the plums, and the cherries, the walnuts that grew in the fields, and the chestnuts in the woods. What a world of treasure stored away in the chambers of Memory, to be enjoyed even yet! "Is it not so?" said Mayweed; and my spirit could but reply in the affirmative; and yet, with a kind of perversity which is perhaps peculiar to me, I look some two1 years ahead to a scene in that same home, where I find myself In tears. Tears for what? Why, you see, "Little girls must be industrious," and I was leaining to knit; but the glad shouts of uncles not much older than myself, and of cousins also, have tempted me from my task, and here I am in the midst of them, my hair streaming in the wind, and as merry  as the merriest; but a voice that I dare not disobey summons me back to my little chair and my knitting- needles with, "Ain't you ashamed to be out there with  the boys?" and so I weep, but not much; for that only brings additional reproof to the eldest granddaughter, of whom they are somewh!at proud, and would like to manufacture into ,the article known as "Lady." A little thorn this, but I cannot forget the pain quite so quickly as I did the other, for it was a real robbery of my rights, and my heart goes out in sympathy to the thousands who have been robbed in like manner.  &#xD;<pb n="14-15" xml:id="VAC8168-00000008"/> Y BLOSSOMS.          '  Mayweed, however, is again at hand, and she gently leads me back to the school-room. t Do you recollect, she says, " when you read of the lazy sheep* who ate grass, and daisies wlfte,' how you wondered what the white daisy was? There was a golden-colored, buttery- leafed flower, which you had named'yellow daisy, but nothing that had ever fallen under your eye that filled your idea of what a white daisy should be; and yet you might be mistaken, and, wandering in a by-path by your- self, when recess came, you gathered some of the fairest of the Mayweeds among my ancestors, a;ld tried to make yourself believe that they were the flowers intended." While Mayweed was thus remindin r me of the an- cient examination, I plucked, and began, unconsciously, to examine :a blossom from the one before me; when a voice by my side - a real human voice said, You think that is homely, auntie; but just look through this, and then see; " presenting me, at the same. time, a magnifying glass of moderate power. "Well, Charley, this does change the appearance somewhat," said I; ; but it is not very beautiful yet." He regarded me a moment with an amused look, and then handed me one of much higher power, I adjusted it to the humble weed, and what a transformation! Glorious beyond all I had ever imagined, the very dust upon its leaves sparkling like diamondsk. "'Beautiful! beautiful "I exclaimed, in rapt astonishment, when there came a soft whisper, "No beauty, no sweetness. Is thy life like the Mayweed's?" "Would to God it might be!" was the full response of my heart. The lens of thy spirit is the glass through which thou must look upon. it," came in sweet reply. " 4 it expands     thou wilt find the bitter bringing sweetness - the unat- tractive changing to attractive - then beautiful, then dazzlingly glorious - brighter and still brighter, as the jewels polished by the rough hand of Time reflect the blaze of Eternity." I listened till the voice ceased, and then went forth content.  FAINT NOT. FAINT not, soul, beneath thy sorrow; Lopg the night that brings no morrow; Woo thou Hope, and she will sing, While she folds her' fluttering wing, Soothing strains, tq cheer thy way, Till night brings the new-born day. Courage, courage, struggle on: If a cloud obscures thy sun, Dream not' that thy joys are past; Of thy faith 'tis but a test: Courage, and it. soon shall be A crowning gem in victory.  &#xD;<pb n="16-17" xml:id="VAC8168-00000009"/> 16       IMAIYWEED BLOSSOMS.

THE burning sun of noon was o'er me; A long journey lay before me; I looked around on all the plain or shelter, but I sought in vain. Just then I saw, far down the way, A flower of colors bright and gay: I ran in haste to gather it, Unmindful of the noontide heat. And then another and another Drew me still further on and further,- Ah, yes, they even drew me on Until my journey was quite done; Then, as I turned to seek for rest, Thinking how much I had been blest, 'Twas thus I mused, What should we do But for life's flowers, as we pass through?"   &#xD;<pb n="20-21" xml:id="VAC8168-00000011"/> 20    * -IMAYWEED BLOSSOdMS.; !f  ' , HEARTI LEAVES.

As the lights and shades-the' rough and smooth places, and all that, taken separately, would look like unmeaning distortions - are needed to make the work of the artist perfect, to make a picture that shall pro- claim a master's hand, so is each leaf in that wondrous book called "The Heart" needed to form a perfect vol- ume. But here there are no stereotyped editions - no ten thousands struck from the same type. No; each book is a new work, complete in itself- original and distinct from all others.

His daughter had her bed for flowers, andof course I must have one, so I selected a spots and filled it with the choicest seeds and roots that I could obtain. Two years passed. They grew and flourished, yielding their share of beauty to gladden our hearts, and then we changed our residence. The following spring 1 visited  my friend, and with her the spot which had once been my home.  -low changed! The house ws full of ma- chinery instead of happy children. The garden fence was thrown down, and what had once been so carefully tended was exposed to the invasion of anything- that close to enter. I surveyed the scene in silence, but passing round the house, a vision of beauty met my eye which chased away my sadnesss. There were some of my flowers in full bloom, bending their heads gracefully to the morning breeze in spite of the surrounding ruin.- And can we not. thus plant flowers in the moral, as well as in the natural world, such as will bloom in the midst of desolation?

"T is very pretty, but I don't know as it is of much use to soul or body either."  The above remark was made in my earing, not long since, by a lady who has lived more th n sixty years in this beautiful world, upon being show a nice piece of worsted embroidery. "It is very pr tty, but I don't know as it is of much use to soul or body either." And what is your idea of use? thought I, as I lo6ked into her time-worn face. Is it that a thing is of no value, unless it will bring money or its equivalent? God must have made a strange mistake in preparing a  home for man, if money is the sine qua non of all that is desirable; if a beautiful thing is of no use be- cause we can neither eat, wear, or sell it, which latter we cpuld never do if there were none to appreciate it. If, then, it is of no use because it cannot be appreciated in any of'these ways, why did God send forth the spirit of beauty to pervade, like the breath of life, all created thingls ? Beautiful, and yet of no use! O, woman, thy gray hairs should mnake thee venerable; but has the lapse of years so shrivelled up'thy soul that thou canst feel no joy in looking upon that which is lovely? Does the song of birds, the delicately tinted flower, the stately tree,  "With quivering bliss of thousand leaves, Kissed bly the wooing summer breeze," the gorgeous sunset clouds, the shining stars, or blush  6         '   &#xD;<pb n="28-29" xml:id="VAC8168-00000015"/> 28       i2MA YW-EED BLOSSOMAS. of early morn, never awaken emotions of gladness, and cause thy spirit to thrill with unutterable bliss? Canst thou see nought in fields of wuaving ,rain, flocks of bleating sheep, droves of lowing kine, but the shiningT dollar? Canst thou look upon the abundance of luscious fruit, or listen to the hum of bees, and think of nothing but the gratification of the palate? Then, indeed, art thou miserably poor. Though thy posses- sions should reach from the rising of the sun to the set- ting th   thereof, the veriest begar, whose heart is open to the charms of nature, is richer than thou, and may say, in the language of the poet, Cleon hath his million acres, Not a penny I, Yet the poorer of the twain Is Cleon, and not I." If that mother has spent all the years of her life thus, if she has brought up her ten children to see no value in aught but money, the world could well. have spared her for all the good she has ever done it. She may be called an energetic woman ; but of what use has that energy been, if it has only moulded the hearts of, her children into stone, by making them inset- sible to all the softer influences of life, thus crushing out the better part of their natures? If, under her in- fluence, her' sons and daughrters barter .their best affec- tions for gold or position, what is gained by such/ ener- gy?  Are families made happy, is society better, does the blessing of the poor follow in its footsteps?

Suppose those children yield themselves to such an influence, become moulded and fashioned with one ab- sorbing idea, money, what happiness can their compan- ions or children find in their society? And even if their love of possession should be restrained sufficiently to keep their hands off the property of another, what benefit will they ever be to neighbors or friends? But suppose, when they coime to act for themselves, that they should break aw1ay from the unnatural restraints of their childhood, and seelk in the gratification of their appetites or passions, compensation for the higher and nobler enjoyments of which they have been deprived, what then? Why, we shall have the drunkard, the glut- ton, or the heartless libertine. O, mother, what a sad mistake you made when you thought that the love of the beautiful was of no use to soul or body either! This love is implanted in the heart  of all, it is a want of our' nature, and throughout the works of Nature we find provision made to meet tlis want; but if this provision is left unappropriated, this part of ourselves uncultivated, the restless longings of our souls will find vent somewnhere, and streams turned from their course are apt to do mischief. If parents only felt, and taught their children to feel, th:at "-a thing of beauty is a joy forever," what different looking homes s!hould we see all over the land! Neat- ness would take the , ace of filth, and beauty of deform- ity. We should not see pigsties and barnyards in such iclose proximity to otir dwellings, neither would those il ,1   &#xD;<pb n="30-31" xml:id="VAC8168-00000016"/> 30       MA YWEED BLOSSOMS. dwellings be exposed to the scorching rays of the sum- mer sun or the driving blasts of winter because each cooling, protecting shade hitd been destroyed; and their walls would not be lined, as they now often are, with store advertisements, or other coarse pictures. How my heart ached to see rooms that were daily frequented by bright-eyed, beauty-loving cherubs, dis-  figured by the portrait of some public dancer, dressed in almost any conceivable style but a modest one; or perhaps a rude sketch of some bloody battle, placed in a conspicuous view. Do such parents ever stop to think of the power of association, or do they not care? Do they not know that our characters are, in a great measure, formed by what is continually presented for our admiration? andif. they admire such things enough to give them a place in  that sacred spot called home, will, not their clildren think  them valuable, and the scenes they represent wortfhy of  being imitated? Very young children will, if properly taught, soon see the difference between the beautiful and the comical or ludicrous. I was once spending a few months ih a family where this part of the soul was well cultivated. One day Charley brought in a comic p)icture that lhe had found somewhere, and gave it to his little sister, but little more than three years old. She looked at it a moment, then commenced laughing heartily. IIs it pretty, Fanny?" said her mother. "It's funny," she replied. It was not pretty, but funny; it excited her mirth, but :not her admiration. Very correctly an- swered; but how had this young child learned so soon to select the proper language for expressing the differ.  O            9 lt   THtE USE' OF THE BEAUTIFUL.     31 ence? Go to the play-room where she spent hours each day with her brothers and sisters. Look at the papers and magazines that were appropriated to their use, and from which every beautiful picture was carefully selected and arranged, while:the funny ones were laughed at and thrown' aside, and you will have an answer. Children love pictures, but this love is liable to be perverted. If we take no pains to place before them images of the beautiful and true, the image of that which is deformed and untrue will form its counterpart in their minds, and go to help make up their characters. But it is not only children that love pictures- the pas- sion is universal, or so nearly so, that of him who does not, it may be said, as of- him who has no music in his soul, he "Is fit for treason, stratagems, and death." Then why should' this part of our souls be so neglected? "Better be earning something to support herself, than spending her time making pictures,'" said a stern back- woodsman of his sister, who was gratifying her love of nature by tryilg to imitate its beauties. But who support themselves best? Let those who know them both answer. Ald go ask that sister if she regrets the time thus spent because it has brought her no golden returns, and she will tell you that money could never purchase such pure pleasure as she has derived from thence.            , No; believe me reader, let your walls he adorned by pictures of your own make, or the works of others, that you have learned to appreciate by discipline in that direction, and their presence will create a charm from  &#xD;<pb n="32-33" xml:id="VAC8168-00000017"/> 32      MAYWEED BLOSSOMS. which you would not willingly break away; a something without which your life would seem incomplete. How many young men, who now frequent the saloon or gambler's hell, would never have been seen there if pains had been taken to make their homes attractive, by gratifying this innate part of their nature. And why should those who have taken it upon them to lure souls to, ruin, understand this so much better than they to whom God has intrusted the business of training thetm aright? t O," says the poor man, "I have to work to get a living for my family. I have no time to whitewash, paint, plant trees, or train vines. I have no money to buy pictures, or to pay out to have my children taught to make them." But you may find time to have an ach- ing heart when they flee from your comfortless home, to seek at Destruction's mouth the gratification of those tastes for which you have neglected to provide.

I would have her see that these are kept in the best of order, but I would have her taught so to arrange them, as not to make a drudge of herself; and I would have her husband, brothers, and sons remember that she needs relaxation as well as they; and I would have them all feel that whatever tends to increase their happiness, whatever adds to the attractions of home, and makes the thought of it a pleasant thing, is good for soul and body both.

DEAR sister, I'm thinking, to-night, of the place Where, sporting in childhood's bright day, With hearts on which sorrow had left not a trace, We carolled the glad hours away. I think of the spring, and the streamlet which ran In its gay laughing beauty along, Of the flowers that bent o'er it, their beauty to scan, Or list to its murmuring song. The banks where the hazel and June-berry grew, The log which we lised as a bridge For crossing the stream, which smiled from below, Or struggled in impotent rage. I think of the aspen, jso ready to tell When the soft summer zephyr flew by, The oak in the corner, whose acorn-cups fell From boughs that seemed up in the sky. I think of the vine, whose tendrils alone Supported its clustering weight - The hoary old rock, whose particles shone Like jewels reflecting the light. I think how we hastened with eager delight To greet the old pasture-field slide, When Winter came down with his garments of white, The bosom of Nature to hide. I   THE OLD PASTURE FIELD.       35 But years, as I think, keep coming between, With lessons of wisdom and truth; As things that recede, in the distance are seen, So now are the days of our youth. The river of Time, as onward it rolls, Forbids us our steps to retrace, While change after change sweeps over our souls, As if all the past to efface. But change, though it often comes christened in tears, Is proving itself but a friend;  Each tint in life's picture the plainer appears, The nearer we come to life's end. We know that the beautiful blossoms of spring Must fade ere the fruit we can taste; And life's many changes were given to bring Earth's weary ones home to their rest. "OVE.

I know that it is, but I can give you no better; and I , am not sure that it is so poor after all. What could I say that would be more to the purpose? You don't know? Neither do I; if I did, I would say it. Of what use is 'it for you to keep struggling, do you aik? Of what use will it be for you to stop? Tell me that? Why, you can die, at least. I deny it: you cannot die. You may pass out from your present habitation, but you cannot die; and if you pass thence before the work that has been assigned you is accomplished, what then? God knows, and the future will reveal it; I cannot. It is easy to talk, say you, but to what does it amount? I know it is, my friend, and if talking would dispel clouds, would scatter gloom, what a bright world we should have how quickly the slightest mist of sorrow would vanish!

ONCE upon a time there stood, upon the banks of a marshy stream, a young and thrifty vine. The time had come when she could no longer sustain the accu- mulated weight of her own growth, and the question arose as to vllere she should seek for the needed sup- port. Upon the left, close upon the borders of the marsh, was an Labundance of shrubs and weeds, some of but a; year's growth, and some of longer standin-; on the right, and but a few rods distant, stood a stately oak. The oak looked kindly down upon the youthful vine, and said, "Come to me; your graceful foliage shall be a wreath of beauty about my rugged trunk, while I lift you high above thd earth, into heaven's broad sunlight; you shall rest securely upon my branches, and together will we listen to the notes of the aerial songsters that come to rfefresh themselves 'from your pendent clusters." But the inhabitants of the marsh said, "Nay, why, should you leave your friends for a stranger? Some of us rejoiced at your birthl and others have since come to admire your beauty; we all love you, apd why should we be separated? To be sure, we are small as yet, but, like you, we are in the mdrning of life, and while the oak, that has seen so many years, is going to decay., we shall be flourishing in the vigor of our -prime. , Come, then, let us grow together, and cement the friendship so happily begun.

But then, to unite myself with those  jlow bushes would be quite too bad.. I ought not to. think of it for a moment, and yet they are really grow- ing very fast. Who knows but they may become as  high as the oak in the time it would take me to crawl thither and climb to its -branches, and by continuing  with them, I shall thus' save myself all this humiliation and toil."     e     '  Delighted with this pleasing conclusion, the vine  reached forth her tendrils, and clasping them around her, professed friends, agreed to cast in her lot with theirs. Time passed oni; the broad-leaved luxuriance of the thrifty vine nearly hid her supporters from siglit; only here and there a sprout, more vigorous than the rest, or requiring less room, found its way upward. Autumn came, and the heavy clusters bowed the frail  reeds nearly to the earth. Mutual recriminations took place. The vine complained that, instead of being sus-  tained, as she had a rioght to expect, her fruits were  constantly ill danger of being destroyed by the four-  (, footed beasts that went that way. And the bushes said,  "It is all your own fault; you hide from us the light of heaven, leaving us to pine for its vivifying influence, and then load us with a'burden intolerable to be borne."' But their murmurings were of short duration; for a thirsty herd of lowing kine came thither in search of  water, and together they were trampled into the mire,   THE MS TAKEN VINE.       43 the beautiful clusters being crushed beneath the broad hoofs. In the mean time the son of the thrifty farmer com- plained that they had not land enough, and wished his father to purchase more. "But whyshould we do this," replied the thoughtful sire, "when much that we now have remains uncultivated? The bed of yonder stream can be straightened and deepened, thus making acres that are now useless not only tillable, but of a superior, quality?" The marsh was accordingly, cleared; its shrubs and brakes, together with the vine, gathered into heaps and burned. But while they were exterminated, the roots of the vine remained, and life was strong within. Again she sent forth her branches, and again she bent beneath her own weight; but having learned that "humility is before promotion," and "a haughty spirit before a fall," she bowed herself ihumbly to the earth, and, regardless of the invitations of others, made her way towards the oak; patiently she ascended 'the rugged trunk, till at last she sat like a "Crowh of Glory," a Diadem of Beauty," upon the topmost boughs.

Yes, he was my God, my heaven, and my all. I had started to my day's labor, looking within upon my own sad thoughts, instead of without where the sun- light lay, like the smile of love over all the force of nature; but the words that I had heard touched a new  chord in my heart, and it thrilled to the hidden har, monies within - harmonies which gushed forth to neet the spirit of gladness thait was abroad in the earthL  I now felt that I could walk and not be weary, could 'run and riot faint, in the patlh that was marked out for me; yea, as though I could mount up as on the wings of eagles, to meet that God who was "my God, my heaven, my all," and not only mine, but of every suf- fering son and daughter of earth. 4  &#xD;<pb n="50-51" xml:id="VAC8168-00000026"/> 50       MA  EED BLOSSOMS.

SOMEBODY says that "all women, whatever their at- tainments, have a yearning desire to love and be loved again; that the head cannot be educated at thd expense of the heart, and that if they cannot obtain such as they can most venerate and respect, they unite themselves to such as tender them the love they have the need of: they dream of happiness, and awake to disappointment."  . .Not alone are women of genius thus unhappy; \  men suffer too, from ill-assorted marriages." "Men suffer, too!"Well, why shouldn't they? Are they so'complete in themselves that they can do without love? Are they a whole, and we only a part, that must be attached to them, ere we can survive? Have they no hearts, no longings for affection?

But must it always be thus? Is there no remedy for the ill-assorted selections, the wretched mistakqs that are made here? Is there nothing to satisfy the longing for companionship, that is a characteristic of the race? Believe it not. "In that world they neither marry nor I are given in marriage," is the language of the Nazarene; but shall there be no union of congenial natures com- patible with this declaration? Is not the soul, so to speak,:separated into, two, each incomplete without the other? and if divided lhere, will they not, when freed from th body, be drawn together by mutual attraction, and clasping in an eternal embrace, be henceforth essen- tially ani inseparably one? If to be perfect and com- plete is necessary to unmingled happiness, why may not this union be an ingredient in the cup of heavenly bliss, and the ylant of it add to the sorrows of tlose who have not, as yet, entered into the fruition of lifee? Tell mne, ye who have felt this unsatisfied longing, if the prospect of bearing,it about with you forever would not, of itself, be sufficient to insure misery? But rejoice, ye that trust in the wisdom of the In- finite; ye that believe he will meet the wants of your entire being. He created you as you are, and will not i  annihilate what he has created. If pIerverted, He may cleanse, as it were, by fire; but your wants shall be met, and your longings for compan- ionship abundantly satisfied, for in Him is fulness of joy, and at His right hand are pleasures forevermore. i,   SPIRIT UNION.        53 SPIRIT UNION.

Is   SA NCfTIFIC4 TION.      55 i           i SANCTIFICATION. ISOME people seem to have imbibed the idea that chil- dren and young folks have but few serious thoughts. This I consider a great mistake. I do not believe that I am so different from others; but in looking back upon my early years, I sometimes , and sometimes feel indignant, as the retrospection brings to mind the world of anxiety, the absolute mental torture that a false theol- ogy inflicted upon me. When I was some four and a half ye'ars of age, a minister told me of Jesus who died on a tree for little children like myself, and said I ought to love him. "I do love him," I replied, in the sim- plicity of my 'heart, for the story of his goodness won me at once. The following summer, if I remember rightly, I learned ;to read in the Testament, And there it said that Jesus died on the cross. Now here was a puzzler. The preacher said a tree, the, book said the cross; how to reconcile the two I knew not, for I had not the most distant idea that it was possible for big folks or books to be mistaken, or tell stories; only 1  ctareless, bad girls, like myself, could be guilty of either. W1 hat did it mean? I dared- not ask, for I never heard these tlings spoken of only by the preacher, and the book, both so commanding my reverence that I feared to question; and how my little brain used to ache in trying to solve the problem! From this time forth I was in constant trouble. The wonderful stories told in I[  tthe book mn:de a vivid impression upon my 'ssceptible mind, and what the preacher Baid of the certainty of ,;/ l            .'  &#xD;<pb n="56-57" xml:id="VAC8168-00000029"/> 56      MAA YWEED BLOS,SOMS. death for all, and of hell for those who did not love and serve God, drove me nearly wild at times. But it is only the old story, only what thousands have  experienced, and I will not dwell upon it; suffice it; to i' say that when a little past fourteen, I fell in with a pro- tracted meeting, and was counted with the converts,  I Yes, I thought I had got religion; but my mind being progressive, I had no idea of standing still; I must go ahead. The command, "Be ye holy, for I am holy,"  arid the like, were they not in the Bible? and being  there, were God's word; and, as he would not command what we could not obey, it was plainly mly duty to make the above practical. In a word, sanctification was pos-  sible; it was for me, and I must obtain it, or fall short of my duty as a Christian. Honest conclusion; but how should [ reach the desired ultimate? To be con- sistent, or not to be; that was tHe' question. Some three fourths of a mile away from my home lay Lake Erie, to be reached by crossin\r meadow after meadow belonging to the rich man on whose farm we were but poor tenants; and close along tfie bank of the rock- bound shore grew a few blueberry bushes.  One day, as I went in search of this, my favorite ' fruit, my mind was particularly exercised on this same  subject, sanctification. Several months had passed since  I had professed religion. I had become weary of the  sinning and'repenting, and my heart longed for rest; if   I could only get the blessing I sought, of course all would be peace. At length, after a strange process of ,  reasoning, resolving, and faith, I psychologized myself  into the belief that I had actually obtained it. True, I !li did not feel the rapture I had expected, but I had done . i1   TIlE HEAliTt AND TIlE HEART.?    57 what I could - I had given up all, and as His promises were "yea, and amen," it were sin to doubt, and so there was peace, and I tried to exult in that peace, but it was only trying. Blueberries, were scarce, so I made up my mind that I must take them all home, and that it would be wrong for me to eat even one; but after a while I found my hand going to my mouth with a very large one between my fingers. I checked myself in time, hqwever; soon the process was repeated, again, and yet again, till finally the tempting berry slipped down my throat, and away went my sanctification.  'From'that day fo this I have never been able to find it again; but sometimes my mind goes back to that long strip of meadow, to the 'blue waves beating against forty feet of perpendicular rock, and to the struggle between sanctification and the big blueberry, in which the latter came bff triumphant.

CHILDREN NEVER PAY FOR TH'EIR RAISING. 59 \ \ CHLDREN NEVER PAXY FOR THEIR BRINGING   UP. AH i! and whose fault is it, if they do not? Did they thrust themselves upon you, thus forcing you to provide for them against your wills? Has their coming been a dreaded, instead of a looked and longed for event? Be this last as it may, it is certain that they have only come at your call; and if you have called froni the lower instead of the higher plane of your natures, then God pity you, and them also, for the suffering that is thus brought'upon you both. "Children do not pay for their bringing up." And what recompense are you seeking, poor earth-bound mortal? Must you be paid in dollars and cents for bearing the burden of God's greatest blessing? Have your hearts become so stultified that the trusting confi- dence of their loving natures is of no value to you? Why, children are our guardian angels! To how much of good have they stimulated us, and from how much of evil have they kept us back? Some of us are so selfish in our very natures, that I sometimes think we should dry up and blow away were it not for the de- mnands children make upon us. But here comes another, who says, "Wlien our chil- dren are small, they lie heavy on our arms; but when they are large, they lie heavy on our hearts." Alas, that this should ever be true!

Long, long ago, -before we made our: home on the shore of Lake Erie, away back in my childhood years, -my parents lived on what was called the East Hill, in a certai 'county of the old Empire State. On the  hill, but not at the top; for after going across the big meradow, across the pasture field, and full half the way acrss the bush lot, and all the way up hill, we came at length to where the blueberry bushes grew. O, the    i delicious fruit with which they were loaded in summer  and so abundant! It was before I was troubled with  tlhe question of Sanctification; but even in that case, they were so plenteous, that I could have eaten my fill  without injuring m1y Deace of mind.

Before we had been there long the clouds began to look black and threatening, and a few drops of rain foretold the cominig shower. I did not like the idea of going home empty basketed, but what should I do? go without accomplishing the object for which I came, or stay and get a shower bath? I finally concluded that I would do neither. I would break branches from the surrounding shrubbery, form a temporary shelter, gather all the well-filled blueberry bushes we could find han- dily, take them under this shelter, and pick the fruit from them at our leisure. Sister acquiesced, for she never thought of question--, ing my supertior wisdom, and so we went to work with a will. The shelter was prepared, the bushes broken off and brought thither for pickinc; and none too soon, for the few drops that had cone, and then held off, as if on purpose for us to escape, were now increased to a gentle shower. However, we huddled together in our house of refuge, and began to fill our baskets; I boast- ing, meanwhile, to pny silent auditor, who, while she tried to smile,. kept turning her blue eyes towards the intruding drops, for our shelter was rather leaky,-I boasting, however, that we were not going to be scared out; not we. But the rain fell tlicker and faster; courage waned, and water increased in'our little domicile, till finally courage took to her heels, and with little sister close behind, broke into a full run for home, Right through ' \ thehardest of the shower, down through the bush lot, i  down through the pasture field; but by the time we  reached the meadow it, had spent its force, and retiring I'  in haste, left the liquid pearls it had flung so profisely   TRUTIJ, LOVE, AND LIBERTy.      79 over field and forest to sparkle like diamonds in the sunlight.

You see I have never forgotten it; and I often wonder if there are not reformers who some- tiles brave public opinion as recklessly, provide for themselves as poor a defence, and retreat from the con- test as ingloriously as I did from my fortification in the blueberry field.

"Pardon me, Mrs. Hanson; but I could not help smiling to hear you plead for practical utility, and com- plain of the dryness of business details, in the same breath. I agree with you as to the importance of selecting such reading as shall best fit us for the duties we owe to ourselves and each other. That there is much written in the form of stories which is injurious, I acknowledge; but in this, as well as in other things, we can select the good and leave the bad. A truth illustrated by scenes from real life is certainly more powerful for g-good than the same .truth without the illustration; and there are facts enough upon which to base stories, and make them more interesting, more intensely thrilling, than any of fiction can be." "Then I have known but little of real life, for I have neverv seen much that could compare with the stories that are to be found in almost eveiy newspaper or periodical one takes up. As to the one of which you were speaking, I heard sister Mary read it, and I own it is well written; and had I ot felt, as ' always do when listening to such things, O O, it is all made ups; there is no truth in it,' it might have had some effect  upon me."  "I see no reason why it may not be true; Wd if not, is it not a good illustrations? Is there not a truth embodied therein which may thus find access to some  heart, which could be approached in no other way?" "I think truth potent enough to do her own work without questionable aid. Do you not detract from her authority, when you represent her as seeking such means of success?"  "Certainly not. As well might we think it detracted i 'A,   APPLES OF COLD,'        83 from the wisdom of the Creator because he often uses the most simple things to accommodate himself to our understandings. But to return to Miss Irving's story. You will be surprised to hear, that it recalls most vividly some scenes in my own life." "In your life! Is it possible?" "It is not only possible, but actual. You have known me only in prosperity; and when you tell me how happy I always am, you little dream of the struggles through which I Ihave passed, - struggles so severe, that it makes me shudder even yet to think of them;, but they are over, and I have gained by the conflict." WiMy dear MArs. Cleves, you astonish me; but if it is not too painful a subject, will you be kind enourgh to give nce some account of the strutgles of which you speak?"  "Certainly. The pleasure of gratifying you will more than compensalte for any painful emotions that may be awakened, thereby. And, indeed, I think it does me good to live again, at times, in the past. Poverty is associated with nmy earliest recollections. We never went cold, nor 'hungry; but our father had to strain every nerve to keep us firom becoming so, for he had nothing but what his hands earned from day to day, and our mother's health was such that she could do nothing to assist hiln. "Often have we staid at home from church for want of proper clothing; for much as we desired to attend, we could not go dressed so badly as to attract attention. I involuntarily looked upon those who could dress well, and live ia good houses, as better than those who could not; yet my heart rebelled that it should be so. t          a, 1         I  &#xD;<pb n="84-85" xml:id="VAC8168-00000043"/> 84      MAY WEED BLOSSOMS.

I thought that if I could accomplish these objects, I should be as good as the best of them. "Never shall I forget the pride, with which I put on my new hat and cloak the fall before I was thirteen. I I had, with the help of the younger children, gleaned  wheat for the first. To procure the means of purchas-  ing the latter, I went three miles through the hot sun to gather blueberries; then took them about as far the  other way to sell them ; added a little by selling grapes gathered with an equal amount of labor; knit socks and braided corn-husk mats for the remainder, the cloak  costing the entire sum of five dollars.

"Deceived, hearthroken, I walndered from place to place, supporting myself by hard labor a few weeks here and a few months there. I might have taught school, but I had lost all confidence in myself.

' "Well, after a winter of severe labor, that left me unable to do housework, I resolved to visit a while. I had but little ioney, but hoped to add to it from time to time with my needle. After spending a few months among my relatives, I resolved to visit an old friend who was attending school at Woodville. After spend- ing a few days here, I intended to visit the home of my childhood, but I was so charmed with the spirit of the place,' that I knew not how to leave it; it soothed my " wounded spirit like healing balm. I had never before seen such quiet happiness and such earnest effort. "I thought I should like to stay there forever; but what should I do? Why, I could study; but for what? O, to pass away time. Life had become a burden to me, and the lighter I could make that burden the better. I liked study, and I might as well do that as anything. "It was something new, to say the least; so I obtained a situation in a small family, did the work at 'small wages, and took half studies. I joined the Ladies' Literary Society, which, with my other duties, kept mie quite busy, and I was comparatively happy. Still I had no idea of using the knowledge thus obtained; as a person on the cars takes up a book, so did I take upl mine.  "The lady with whoml I staid seemed to understand  me better even than I understood mnyself; little by little  she drew my history from me, and strove to awaken    ,:i hope.

"Reimlarks like these awoke my benumbed aspirations, and I thought that perhaps after a while I would try and do something; yet I was sure to put it off as far as possible; I w6uld stay and prepare myself for a long time. But my old feelings would often return, and I could give veint to my anguish only in floods of tears. In this manner I spent the fall and winter; but in the spring took full studies, and sewed for mly board, while the fhmily hired a good str nng girl, and boarded several students.

"She was a feeble women, and'needed some ore on whom she could rely, and I never dreamed of' a refusal. Judge then of my surprise, when she quietly but firmly said, 'No, there are enough who can do my work, who can do nothing else. You can teach, and you are needed in that capacity. 'Tis true I know not wao to get, but I shall find some one, and I shall not let you do it.' "This proof of disinterested friendship touched me  deeply; it gave me courage to make the effort which proved the foundation of all the success that has since  i ' t   APPLES OF GOLD.         87 been mine. Those who, with feeble health, have to depend so much upon their kitchen help for the comfort of themselves and families, can best realize the scfice made for my benefit, in thus exchangin a certainty  an uncertainty; for I can say, without boasting, that I was responsible help. "To some this might seem a matter of but little im- portance, but it was the hinge upon which great things have turned; at least for me; and surely the happiness of even one heart is no small matter. And how many others might be led from darkness to light, if those who i have the power to do, would show that they care for the interests of others as well as for their own. This lady was so circumstanced that she could not have rendered pecuniary aid, had she so desired; but she gave what was of greater value-the encourage- ment which enabled me to use my own resources. It is better to teachll one to walk than to carry them, though at the sinking point; as Miss Irving says, something may be needed besides words. Yet if there is a heart to do, an empty purse cannot prevent the accomplish- ment of much that is good in the way of blessing others. "That 'words fitly spoken are like apples of gold in pictures of silver,' is as true now as when it was first written; and could I speak to'eyvery suffering, strug- gling soul upon earth, I would say, 'Take fast hold of hope; let her not go, for she is thy life.

The sun has retired behind the distant mountains, and the shades of night are gathering slowly around, when a traveller from the land of the children of Ileth, weary and foot-sore with his journeyings, comes slowly up a rocky gorge sepaiating the adjacent hills, and looks  anxiopsly around for some place of shelter. But no friendly habitation appears in sight; no dwelling reared by the hand of man, for he is the first of all his race who has penetrated these solitudes. But a grassy plot and a friendly stone soon furnish him with bed and pillow, and speedily he sinks into the repose of innocent tranquillity; meanwhile, a band of angels have issued from the gates of Paradise, and are hastening to their accustomed' trysting place on earth. As they descend, they behold, on the very spot their feet have so often pressed, a being in form like unto themselves, but clothed in garments of a different texture. This won- derful stranger is sleeping with one hand beneath his head, and the other lying where it had fallen after brushing from his forehead the locks that are now spark, ling with the dews of the night. For a while they gaze in rapt astonishment, and then hasten to tell the wondrous tale to their companions in light.

I WAS walking along the streets of a great city one pleasant afternoon, in one of those dreamy states of abstraction in which one almost forgets their own exist- ence, when the wV;rds "Mother, look at the baby!" fell on my ear, and arrested mry attention. I turned, and saw a boy of some ten summers leading the wee, toddling one by the hand, while the mother looked up from her work to bestow upon them that smile of love which none but a mother can give. "Mother, baby," I kept repeating to myself, as .1   passed on my way, trying to ascertain which gave forth the sweetest sound. It was an idle task, for both were so beautifully tender, - so united by mutual dependen- cdies that one could not exist without the other. The poet lhas said that "A babe in the house is a well- spring of pleasure."' If this be so, then, the -mother must be a fountain; yea, a fountain of the deepest joy that Heaven c'eri gave to earth. It was for this that she was created, and this she will become if inherited conditions and present surroundings are riht. A foun- tain of life, of love so deep, so wide, and so high, thlat there is nothing in the universe but the love of the Infinite God which has ever yet been given as a measure for it. A fountain whose streams of unfail- ing tenderness possess such an inherent energy that neither time, nor distance, nor change can interrupt or turn them from their course, and* whose Well-springs, if developed in wisdom, shall become the beautiful embodiment of our brightest ideals; yea, shall enlarge those ideals as the germs of still higher embodiments.' But, alas! tlese fountains hIve too often sent forth only the waters of bitterness. Their healing virtues have been neutralized, yea, poisoned by the hand of ignorance. Deformity has taken the place of beauty, hatred of love, and contention of harmony ; and all be- cause man has attempted to divorce the natural from the spiritual, the law of nature from the law of God. Crowned witlh the semblance of wisdom, and taking superstition as her willing hand-maiden of her wishes, ignorance Ihas reigned supreme in this garden of our God, miaking it but too often a Gethsemane of the bitterest -agony to those of high and holy aspiration. 7 &#xD;<pb n="98-99" xml:id="VAC8168-00000050"/> 98            MA YWEED BLOSSOMS.

THE FAIRY      HOST. WEARY with a day of toiling, On my couch I am reclining, While my thoughts are Through the open window flying, To the forest; where the sighing Of the breezes Tells me that the day is dying; To the forest wooing darkness, And the clouds,of pitchy blackness Hanging o'er it, To the clear blue sky between, Like another window, Opening from the landscape Of my window's bounded vision, To some scene perhaps elysian, Some fairy scene. What is this so brightly flashing? What tle rattling, roaring, rushing That I hear?  THE FAIRY HOST.   'Tis a mighty host of fairies, Through that open windows Coming from afar! Of their eyes I see the glancing; 'Tis their many steeds a-prancing, And their many feet a-dancing, That I hear. Prancing o'er the tallest tree tops, Dancing on the greenest leaflets, Nearer, nearer, they are coming; Of their voices," Even now I hear the humming. Hark! there is a footstep On the roof above me  Now another, and another! Thicker, faster, they are falling. 'Tis the fairies! hear themn calling To each other! Now there is a sudden silence, Followed by the rolling drum. Tells it of still greater numbers? Yes, in myriads,  With resistless force they come! Now again the dance commences: Hopping, skipping, here and there, Lightly tripping everywhere About my dwelling, While the tales that they are telling Banish care; And the heavy pealing  ; Of their deep-toned organ Fills the air.  &#xD;<pb n="100-101" xml:id="VAC8168-00000051"/> 100      MA YWEED BLOSSOMS.

HOW I LEARNED IT.       11. HOW  I LEARNED   IT. "'LEARNED what?"  Why, that I could run away. "And how did you learn it?" Mother told me. You look as if you thought I didn't know what I was saying; but I db, and I mean it too. Mother told me that ]I could run away, and from her. It was like this: 1] wanted to go up to uncle's, and play with my little cousins; but mother said, "No." I teased till I found it would do no good; and then, to console myself for my disappointment, I went out, and made my way to what was called "The Gulf." It was just acioss one of uncle's fields, to the left, ahd a place of great interest to me.  There was a very steep bank on one side, a very steep bank on the other side, and a very small stream at the bottom, which came out of the ground in the meadow just above. This little'stream was a very modest one, and as it was not permritted to run under ground any longer, it. seemed determined to get as nearly out of sight as possible; and with the rocks that jutted over it, and the bushes that bathed their feet therein, it was so nearly hidden that one had barely an occasional chance to say to it"'Peek-a-boo." Well, as I have said, it was a place of great interest to me, and if I did not always find, I was sure to be looking for something wonderful whenever I went there. My first astonish- ment in this catalogue'of wonders was a bush of beau- tiful wild honeysuckle, the first I had ever seen; andl there, too, were spikenard berries, hazlenuts, grapes,  &#xD;<pb n="102-103" xml:id="VAC8168-00000052"/> 102      MA YWEED BLOSSOMS. and chestnuts, in the season for them; and sassafras bushes, upon which I so often spent all the strength I could suimmon in pulling up by the roots, that I milght  have the bark as an article of luxury; and cunningc little birds' nests, equally cunning whether filled with eggs or young. Indeed, there was no end to the attrac- ltions. of the Gulf; so you see it was just the place fqr a disappointed child to go and forget trouble. When I had sufficiently recovered my equanimity, I returned to the house, and mother asked me where I had been. I told her. She looked at me sharply for a moment, and then said, "If I do find that you have been up to your uncle's,.you'll catch it." What a reve- lation was here I had never dreamed it possible t'hat I could golwhere mother said I mustn't; but I could, and mother knew it, for she was threatening me with punishment to prevent my doing so. And that was how I learned that I could run away. STAR VOICES.

As they flash and scintillate.   STAR VOICES.        103 X "We are shrinking from the glory, From the grandeur of the glory Flaming from the myriad altars Of poor human hearts in pain: Pained through hopes so slowly dying; Pained by fires those hopes consuming, Till the ashes, falling backward, So bedim the spirit's vision, That the glory which we shrink from Is buthlackness unto themn" "O, these ash6s! dead, white ashes I Let no tear-drops fall upon them, Lest their! alkaline corroding Should so eat into your soul-life That your strength be naught but weakness, And your crown be thus too heavy, With its glory so transcendent, All too heavy, when it comes."

Cease, then, cease this,constant praying; Quench the hidden fire in motion, Still the pulse of aspiration, Fossilize both heart and soul. If you ask, then you must suffer; You must grow to what you pray for, And the pangs of transformation Come before the glory conmes."

BALL'S Jane has left her; she says Jane's- mother tells her that it is always so ; she never will stay longr at a time." "Jane's mother! Why, when she first came to Mrs. Ball's, the story was that her mother always took her away as soon as she got clothed up a little. When did she go?" "On Tuesday." "Tuesday! That was the day she was here to bor- row the churn; the day before the picnic. She wanted to go very nmuch, but had no money to pay her fare on the cars."                                     . "Wouldn't Mrs. Ball let her have it?" "No. Jane said she had asked Mrs. Ball, and she told her that she should give her no twenty cents. She wanted me to let her have it, but I had no change by me; then she wanted me to ask you for it, but I thought she had better ask you herself." 8   &#xD;<pb n="114-115" xml:id="VAC8168-00000058"/> "4      AIAYIWEED BLOSSOMS., "She did not come to me, or she should have had it. I think Mrs. Ball might have let her have that trifle." "She said something about trying to get it of her aunt. That was what she went for then; she asked to go and see her aunt, and Mrs. Ball told her that she might, after, the churning was done, iflhe would be back in time to get the dinner; but she did not come at all." "Have they not seen her since?" "Mr. Ball saw her the next day, and she said she wanted to come back; but he toldl her that his wife said she wouldn't have her any more; she had gone, and she might stay." "What reason did she give for not coming back at the time specified? "I don't know as any. Mrs. Ball thinks that she staid longer than she intended, and then was afraid to come lest she should get punished. She says Jane had been quite a good girl for the last two weeks; had been learning to sew, and succeeded well for a beginner; that she would have been quite a help to her in time, had she staid." The foregoing remarks were made in my hearing not long since; and now let us examine the matter fairly, and see who was most to blame, Jane or her mistress. Jane's mother was a worthless woman; only a curse to those she should have protected; and poor Jane, though but a child, was left to care for herself; to find a home wherever she could; and Mrs. Ball had taken her from the street, one cold day the winter before, just at night, and thinly clad. The woman with whom she had been staying hid turned her out, for some cause,    TWO SIDES TO THE PICTURE.      115 and the child was crying bitterly, not knowing where to find shelter for the night.     WMrs. Ball was lame, and could not, on that account, get around very well to do her work, and her husband's income was, too small to warrant their hiring it done. She had hitlerto depended upon a sister, who made her home with them; but this sister was soon to be mar- ried, thus leaving her entirely alone. Jane was large enolugh to wash dishes, set tables, run of errands, and the like; consequently just such help as the circum- stances demanded.  The lady talked loudly of the wrongs the poor child had endured, how she had been neglected, &amp;c., and said that if Jane would stay with her, and trylto be a good girl, she should not want for a home, but should be clothed up, and made comfortable. "To be sure, she must have faults; " that was to be expected; she had been so neglected, it could not be otherwise; but some one must care for the child, and why not her as well as another? So Jane was duly installed in her new home, and Mrs. Ball just as duly congratulated herself upon the good she was doing. Months passed. The blush of spring began to fade before the brighter hues of summer. The time of pic- nics had come. Circle after circle of happy children had gone forth from the city's dusty walls to revel a while in the garden's nature. The class with whom Jane was connected was soon to take their turn. She could not go to school, but the teacher had kindly agreed to let her go to the picnic, if she would furnish her share of the finds necessary to pay the expenses. But where was she to get the money? '!.      * 1  &#xD;<pb n="116-117" xml:id="VAC8168-00000059"/> "6      3Ar YWEED BLOSSOMS. O, she would be very good, and perhaps Mrs. Ball would let her have it. This, doubtless, was the secret of her behaving so much better than usual the last two weeks of her stay. '0, how her heart had throbbed between hope and fear; how she had tried, by every art in her power, to win the good will of her mistress; how she had calculated the chances of success, and shrank from the thought of failure. She wouldn't miss going for anything! They were going a good many miles on the cars; were to have speeches and music! It would be a new era in her existence. But the time draws near; there is but one day left; she timidly asks for the twenty cents, and is refused. She turns away with a sinking heart, but will not give it up so; she may get it of some one yet. She gets permission to go out, with the understanding that she is to return in time to get the dinner. This she readily  promises, and intends to perform; but, in her anxiety to accomplish her object, she forgets the flight of time, and, ere she is aware, the hour for her return has passed, and then she dares not go. Poor child! dis- appointed all around, and all for the paltry sum of twenty cents.  Mrs. Ball could well afford to keep her for a waiter; let her eat at the side table, and make over old clothes for her to wear;' but she could not afford to pay out money for her. Not she! But, had any one dared to tell her that she was not doing well by the child, the charge would have been indignantly repelled. Why, she had taken her from the street! had given her a home! How much would they have her do? Stop a moment, my good woman. Let us look at \   '        \ 1   TWO SIDES TO TIlE PICTURE.     117 this thing a little.

But they have always rejoiced in a father's care, and a fond mother's love, and would not need it half as much as did this poor neglected one. Could you not spare twenty cents to purchase a ray of sunshine to illumine her darkened path? And " you wished to make her a good girl,"you said. Well, what better way could you have taken, than to have shown her that you appreciated her efforts to please you, by saying, "Yes, Jane, I guess I must let you go; you have been a pretty good girl of late, and you deserve a holiday. Go and enjoy yourself; but be careful to do what is rilght and proper, and when you return, I shall expect you to keep doing better all the time. I know it is hard breaking up bad habits, but you will conquer if you persevere." Suppose you had taken such a course, instead of the one you did, would you not have been repaid in more ways than one? You may think you did just right; but while you are exclaiming against the ingratitude of other people's children in general, and of this one in particular, others may form a very different opinion.  &#xD;<pb n="118-119" xml:id="VAC8168-00000060"/> "8     IMAYWEED BLOSSOMS.

It is ever prompting us to seek some place to which we can turn and be at rest; that place to be dearer to us than all the world beside. The asso- ciat ons of home tend to strengthen the noblest feelings of tie soul; it is one of the loves which elevate and refine. But will it endure? Will it pass with us into the future?  I believe it will, for does God create only that he may destroy? nourish all the days of our mortal life that which cannot pass with us through the gates of deatnh Aii who does not k., w that the love of home is stronger at three score than at fifteen? And Ic, says one, is the love of life. Yes, thank God; and we shall take life, the life of immortality with us, as we shall the love of home. This cannot die, for it is a part of our-  selves, and being such, shall be gratified in accordance with the divinest wisdom. Yes, we shall have a home in heaven. *We often hear people speaking of heaven as a home; but to how few has the idea come of a home in heaven, a specific dwelling-place appointed unto us, a mansion where we can collect and arrange our treasures accord- ing to our individual tastes? Heaven our home! What would some poor earth wanderer say, if you should attempt to comfort him by telling him that the world  was his home?

Alas! of how many may it be said, "the world is their home," "the foxes have holes, and the birds of the air have nests, but the Son of mnan hath not where to lay his head??" The world is my home." It is rather an expression of desolation than of rest; and would it be less so if it were true of the world to come? Is heaven so much less cap)acious than earth? or do we expect that our spirits will become so enlarged, upon leaving the body, that we can fill and appropriate its boundless realms? Believe it not. We shall have a home in heaven-an actual residence, fitted up in accordance with our individual characteristics; a liv- ing expression of-our inner selves. "Lay up for yourselves .leasures ln near-r, i r injunctinr otf true wisdom, and, as is[ our obedience ilereto, so will be the beauty and richness of that home. How many, who look upon it as a great misfor- tune to be poor here, forget the possibility of compara- tive poverty there. They busy themselves in collecting this world's goods, not one particle of which they can carry with them; but are exceedingly moderate in their aspirations for a future life. If they can only be ad- mitted inside of heaven's gate, they deem it sufficient. But it seems to me that it will not be so pleasant a thing, after all, to be saved, as by fire, while the treas- ures I have accumulated are burned up, because we have not selected those of a durable stamp. Such people show that they have no true idea of what heaven is. To them it is no living reality; a something to be wrought out for themselves. The command, to   A HfOME IN lHEA' VEN.     121 work out their own 'salvation, has no meaning which they can enter into and understand; but they seem to expect that it will be given to them, something as one receives a piece of property by bequest. They have no realizing sense that our heaven is, and ever must be, in accordance with our receptivity; that it must flow into, and be elaborated through us into garments of beauty, precious jewels, and glorious marisions, and that only so far as they are thus elaborated can they be ours. Those who sow to the flesh shall, of the flesh, reap  corruption, and those who sow to the spirit shall, of the spirit, reap life everlasting," while ' those who sow sparingly, shall reap sparingly," in one case as well as in the other; and thus shall our home there be just what we please to make it, or rather, a true representa- tion of what we please to make ourselves. The insignia of our moral rank, be it liigh or low, will be stamped upon all that pertains to us, and wherever we go we shall -be known for just what we are. But there is one advantage that those homes will have over the homes of earth. Our mansions will never become old or weather- beaten, nor our furniture covered with dust and cob- webs, if not subject to constant supervision; our fruits will not mildew, nor our flowers wither, because of a worm at the root.

"ONG years ago, when I was but a child,'- Yes, they were long, those years; they did not flit As now, so swiftly by, but paused to gaze On childhood's sunny brow. I sported then, One balmy day, without the cottage door That was my father's home. The western sky Bespoke the waning day's departing hour, When my sweet sister, pausing in her play, Exclaimed, "Papa has come!"My toys were dropped, And springing forward, thought to catch his hand'; But there was something in his look so sad It checked the joyous beating of iay heart; 'Twas so unwont I lnew not what it meant;  No kiss he'gave, nor scarce a single smile, As on with lingering tread he passed to where Our mother watched our baby brother's cot. I paused through fear, of what I did not know, One moment at the door but the desire Which so predominates, and ever has, Within the human breast, whate'er lies hid To learn, impelled me on, and I saw what I ne'er remember to have seen before-   A LEAF FROM MEMORY.      '123 The tears slow trickling down my mother's cheeks. They fell upon my heart like drops of ice.  I stole me to her side; she cla-sped me close, As if she feared some one would tear me thence. What could it be that grieved my parents thus? They spake of death. I studied o'er and o'er To see what that could mean: I could not tell; But now I know. Alas! I know too well; For I have seen him lay his hand upon That mothe's form, till, shrinking from his touch, She hid herself within the silent grave. They spake of death, a lake, and a frail bark Upon its bosom rocked, too roughly rocked, E'en till its inmates grappled with the deep. I tried, but tried in vain, to comprehend )'t   IThe fearful tale their looks and words expressed; In after years, oft told, I learned it all. Assist me, mournful muse, while I attempt, i In language worthy of the scene, to paint    5 lWhat is inscribed so deeply on my heart. Within the bosom of a lovely scene, Itself the centre, stands a little lake:- - Go thou, upon some quiet summer day, And looking down into its placid depths, Say if thou see'st ought to waken fear,  'Tis so serenely fair? But trust it not, For when old Boreas rises from his seat, i    'Tis shaken like the heart by passion swayed.

Unto the beach they came, and gating on The other shore, they feared to cross thereto, For lo! the winds spake threateningly, and waves, With sullen aspect, said, "Tempt not our rage." They heard, and feared; but, led by stiong desire, They ventured forth upon the treacherous deep. Treacherous! Ah, no, for they were fairly warned! Too soon they learned, that those who take desire Instead of reason for their guide, shall find Their footsteps following in the devious path Which leads away from hope's bright goal of peace. Swayed to and fro, like some tall slender tree  When the fierce blast comes sweeping through the vale, Their little bark, unable to withstand, Or buffet with the waves, was soon a wreck.

And, father, when I. remember in those years that lhe was with us, and after , she had flitted to brighter climes, when I remember the continuous toil, the coarse fare, and poor attire that was thine, in order that thy children might have bread, and that, while others agrew richer for thy toil, - when I think of all this, mly soul cries out, "Where is Justice, and where the habitation of her throne?"

Presently the big meadow was covered with yellow blossoms,- -daisies, I called them, - then strawherries blossomed and ripened, and blueberries did the same.

NIot my mother,for she had gone to the land of the hereafter; not my father, my brother, and my sisters, for they were scattered and far away.  I had purposely prevented the friend to whose house I was going from coming for me, because it was " so little wqy across" that I could walk it- as welJ as not; but when the hour for starting arrived, aunt was very much afraid that my satchel was too heavy for me; she would (o and help me carry it.

I was just dn the point of giving up in despair, when she concluded that if I wert very slowly, perhaps it might not hurt me. With a great deal of alacrity, I assured her that I shohld go very slowly indeed, and hurried out, in order to get away before she should change her mind. How familiar everything looked, and y,et how strange! The freshness that I had carried in my heart all these years,was not reflected back upon me from tree, bush, nor hillside; and even the pebbles in the pathway stared, at me as if I was a stranger. And I was! I went aw sy a child; I had come back a woman: and how could they be expected to recognize me? I felt, but did not stop to analyze the why of all this, as I hurried on, wooing the warmth that did not come. Surely, when I reached the meadow, the orchard, the spring, and the rock, I should be at home then. Alas! -even here they had known only the child. A stranger still; I sat me down and wept. Here, right here, stood the log cot, that was to me "a cottage fair." It was gone; lht not the surround- ings, -the hills were the same; the fields and forests nearly so, - but sleeping away in the autumn sunlight, nor waking once to welcome me. Here was the grassy spot where once I laid me down, and tried to count the stars. Here it was still, and as green as ever, but somehow its beauty for me was gone. Yonder stood the old log barn, where I used to go to pray to the God they told me of, who didn't like bad girls; but lie didn't seem inclined to answer my prayers by making mc good, for, judging by the -standard of those about me, -I grew no better all the time. It, too, was gone! all   f  '     T}IWENTY YEARS AFTERWARD.     15 gone, together with the fence, beside which I used to 'hunt for the hens that stole their own nests - strange stealing that; if every one came as honestly by what they have as did those hens by their nests, .we should be a very honest people. The meadow was there, the same as in the past, but I didn't feel a bit like going around it on the top of the rail fence, as I had done twenty years before; and the ? hoary old rock" loomed up into sight just across the creek, but I was too sad even to go to it. O, dear! O, dear!   Well, I had carried this land- scape in my heart for twenty years - carried it there hidden from sight, as one of the precious things of' earth; and now, as I brought it forth, it crumbled -- crumbled to dust, leaving me but the ashes of the dead past with which to enrich the living present. Yes, it had gone - gone from me as my childhood had. They belonged together, and what God had joined I could not separate. The first pang of disappointment softened., and I began to question. Is it not well, I ask, thai; this is so? If the sunshine, the. freshness of the past; dould remain to us, should we not lose very much of the present, and of the future also, from the too frequent; turning of our eyes backward?  Ay, we should; and it is well that we are not per- mitted to overload ourselves with that which blooms in our pathway, Gone from the external life, both ouri childhood and its surroundings ; but, upon the walls of memory's crystal palace, they are stamped in colors of imperishable brightness, and knowing this, we are content. &#xD;<pb n="152-153" xml:id="VAC8168-00000077"/> THE RESURRECTION OF THE FAIRIES.

True; but it was large enough to contain the rich and the poor, the oppressor and the oppressed, the  virtuous and the vicious, the time-server, and those who sacrifice all for the RIGHT. One of this latter class had just finished a day of toil, and was preparing for the evening walk, that, when cir- cumstances permitted, she always took at the close- of a day's confinement- to the long rows of figures in the merchant's ledger, for even then-twenty-five years  Rago -this woman was fearless enough to fill what was  called a man's position, and through the favor of one who knew her worth, and what she had sacrificed fo t principle, she held the place and received the wages of an account:ant in a store. Ten years before, Marion Tracy, then but eighteen years of age, and the petted child of wealth, became the  bride of Lorain Reid, head clerk in her father's store. Her parents opposed their union; he was poor, and what was worse, had imbibed the "pernicious doctrines"   C. 2tARITY.       199 of the Garrisonian school. In short, he was an aboli- tionist; he believed the black man had rights as well as the white man; that slavery was not a d'vine institution. This heresy so incensed Mr. Tracy, tlat, but for the efficiency of young Reid, he would have dismissed him from his employ at once. The daughter, however, did not feel as did the father. Marion listened to the eloquent words of her lover, as he painted the wrongs of the black man, till her soul Iecame fired with the desire to do something towards breaking their chains, and when, in opposition to her. father's wishes,-yea, commands, -she married the ".young fanatic," as he was called, and was banished from her paternal roof, she went forth courageously, ,believing that the right would triumph.  The young couple found a home in the south part of the State, went to work hopefully, cheerfully. In due time two lovely children, two bright-eyed girls, were born unto them. But the black man still groaned in chains, or fled at fig-ht through the land of boasting,  towards the land of freedom, and Mr.- Reid's home became an underground railroad depot, and himself one of the principal conductors, till at length he so exposed his health, in making extra exertions to save a company of fugitives from the human bloodhounds that were close upon their track, that he sickened and died. Their property was not wholly clear from in- cumbrance, and the vampires of the law swooped down upon it, used it in litigation, while the widow and the fatherless were left destitute.

"Because I am a man, and the charitable ones have got it into their heads that they are not what they should be."                / Marion looked at the merchant with a curious smile. "No, it is not that, Mrs. Reid. I am not a coward; but it injures them.

If I possess the power you attribute I  .        ,1  &#xD;<pb n="204-205" xml:id="VAC8168-00000103"/> to me, might I not possibly be a benefit to them, even if guilty? Might I not, by showing that all hearts are not shut against them, lead them back to the path of virtue? Surely the mother and sister of 'sucl a one as you have described the lame one to be cannot bo wholly depraved. If they are innocent, they deserve friends, and if guilty, need them; and I shall most certainly make their acquaintance." "But how will you manage it? Judging frotn their appearance, I should not think theln very approachatle; and the proud reserve they manifest is one thing that leads me to believe them innocenl."

"Well, well, don't laugh at me, and 1 will leave the case wholly in your hands." "Not till you have told' me where to find them." "O, I forgot that. They live in the pretty white cottage on C-- Street, No. ---, I think it is; you will know it by its standing back from the road all alone, and by the elm in front."     '  l "What I that little bird's nest? I have often noticed it. Just the place for innocence to nestle in. I should as soon think of associating heaven and hell, as guilt with that place, but how came Simpson to build such a residence for a tenant house? It doesn't seem a bit like him." "He did not.' It belonged to a poor widow who was unfortunate enough to become indebted to him, and report says that he took it from her unfairly.. The poor woman grieved so at having to give up her home    that she did not live long afterwards, and. report further says that since her death she has haunted the house. It is certain that those Who went there did not stay long, till at length no one would live there. Simpson had not been able to find a tenant for nearly a year, before these people came, and he has' tried in vain to sell it; so, if he did come by it unjustly, it seems to be doing him but little good." "Glad of it; I wish every one who obtains property unjustly might get as little good of it." "But you do not believe in the superstitious notion of haunted houses, Mrs. Reid?" "Why not?

ONE Sunday morning in December, 1835, the fol- lowing notice was read from the desk, occupied by the Rev Mr. Schoolc raft:    S  "The members of this church are requested to meet in the xest          are requeste( to meet in the vestry on Tuesday evening next, in order to devise some mhearns by which religiou re dig  be crca..] [ated through every portion of the city."

Think of the importance of the work to be performed--nothina less than to furnish religious reading to this great and growing city. While the enemy of souls is going about seeking whom he may devour - while his emissaries are actively engaged, in leading souls astray - while the theatre draws its victips -while the gambler watches for his prey - while y- low-covered novels, filled with corruption, find the;r way into the hands of our young people- while t c rumseller sends his customer staggering home to his innocent wife and babes-and while the wiles of her whose 'steps take hold on hell'are constantly leading our young men into the path of destruction-while these, all these things are being done under our veocy eyes, what are we doing to stein the tide of corruption? Nothing, comparatively nothing. To be sure, we pray, and profess our faith in the saving efficacy of the precious blood ol Christ, but what are prayers and faith without works I And of what avail will our professions be, if we do not practice! I tell you, friends, that there is something more at stake in this thing than merely the interests of others; momentous as these may be, they are not all, for our own eternal safety is involved therein. Not that I would teach reliance upon works; far be it from me; I know that salvation comes through faith in Christ; but, friends, it must be a living faith. We must have the spirit that was in Christ, the love divine that constraincth us to labor for others. And   besides, look at the exceeding great reward! He that converteth a soul from the error of his ways, hideth a multitude of sins.' Poor miserable sinners that we all are, who is there that does not need such a covering! What are a few, paltry dollars, and a little time spent in this cause, if even one soul can be saved? I propose, brethren, to take up a collection for this purpose just now, while the subject is fresh in our minds. Brother Wilkins and Brother Smith, please go through the con- gregation, and receive what the friends are willing to bestow in so worthy a cause. Remember, it is to fur- nish religious food to send into the highways and i hedges - not the food that perisheth, but that which gives eternal life; not that which is to sustain these vile, bodies, but that which feeds the immortal soul; and remember also, that' there is he that scattereth and yet, increaseth, and he that withholdeth more than is meet, and tendeth to poverty. The liberal soul shall be made fat.' The choir will sing while the collection is being taken, and then I will address you from these words, found in First Corinthians, xiii. 13: 'And now abideth faith, hope, charity, these three; but the greatest of these is charity.' And may the God of all grace help us to practise the charitywe preach." Many were the comments made, during that and the two following days, upon the piety and zeal of the ,new pastor. "Suriely the cause would prosper in such hands." The collection was good, and the meeting on Tuesday evening well attended. After due deliberation, it was decided that the city should be divided into dis- tricts, and the sisters, going two by two, should, as far as possible, visit every house and every family, and   &#xD;<pb n="210-211" xml:id="VAC8168-00000106"/> 210      MAYWEED BLOSSOMS. leave such religious tracts as appearances indicated were needed. Another meeting was agreed upon for the sis- ters to arrange their committees, and appoint their fields of labor. In the mean time, the brothers were tp fur- nish funds, purchase tracts, and give such information as they thought beneficial in advancing the cause. The minister was in earnest. Naturally of an active temperament, with warm, strong feels, and being religiously educated, those feelings of course found vent in that direction. He was full of zeal, and, like the prophet of old, could not hold his peace; he thus be- came a focus, a sort of central sun for the tiinds he came into more immediate contact with, sending forth his warm, magnetic life into theirs, quickening them to action, till soon the church was all aglow with life. The city, even to the very outskirts, was canvassed, pages containing words of counsel, warning, or entreaty were left with every family, reports were brought in, and the time set for another general visit of the same nature, Mr. Schooleraft counselling in the mean time a series of prayer meetings. "We have sown the seed," said he, "but God only can give the increase; let us meet and pray for 'Showers of grace divine,' that our labors may not be in vain." And sco tri-weekly prayer meetings were appointed, the circle of magnetic life deepened and broadened till the rooms overflowed with anxious inquirers, even till scores were added to the church, and amongst the num- ber Eloise Merrill, the cripple, and sister of the beau- tiful Helen we have before spoken of. f-   2" The child  for she was but a child as yet-had 8                 t CIARITY. cy been induced to go t first by a neighbor's daughter and becoming interested, the mother or Helen some- times accompanied her. But while Eloise was always greeted with kindness and warmth, there was somethin in the atmosphere that so chilled Mrs. Taylor and Helen that they soon ceased entirely to attend; though loath to deny their darling aughtthat could add to h lah iness, they still permitted Eloise to go, till in time she was baptized, and became an accepted member of the society. Sweet Eloise, innocent as an angel, she dreamed not, as yet, of the dark suspicions that hung arpund her mother and sister, and wondered why they did not love to attend church as well as she did. The time set for another exploration of the city had expired, and again the tract distributors brought in their reports. Some brought in goodly accounts of success, and some said there were giant evils in the place that could not be overcome. Some were hopeful, and some were desponding; but we have principally to do with the minister',s mother, M rs. Schoolcraft, who resided at the parsonage, her son being nma ied and a maiden k  married, and a  maiden lady of some forty summers by the name of Prudence Crowell.                  u These ladies had labored together, and, after giin , in their testimony on other loints, Mrs. Schoolcraft said, "Now, ladies, I have something very sad to tell you," while Miss Prudence put her handkerchief to her eyes as if to hide the tears she wished to shed. The ladies looked up inquiringly, and Mrs. Schooecraft con- tinued              .

Merrill, and the dark suspicions that hang about the conduct of her mother and sister. It is one of the mys- teries that such a lamb should dwell in the very den' of the wolf; still no one can look upon her pure, spiritual face Without feeling that she is one of Grod's elect, and he will doubtless take care of her. But perhaps you have not generally known why we believe this wonman and her eldest daughter vile; and, lest you 'may think us mistaken, or lacking in charity, I will tell yoXu: Spending, much of my time, as you know, among the sick, last October I learned that ,a, poor woman was occupying an uncomfortable room on B --  Street, with a sick child, and, further, that she was a stranger in the city; therefore I felt it my duty to call on her. I there found this same Mrs. Taylor, with scarcely the comforts of life about her, and our Eloise quite sick. I made some inquiries into her circumstances, asked if I could be of any assistance to her, &amp;c., &amp;c., all of which she received quite coolly, thanked me for my kindness with a manner as proud as a queen, but thought shi He could get along without aid at present. I then turned to the little one, and she looked so sick that I really thought she could not live, and I began ,to talk to her of Jesus, when the mother interrupted me by saying that the childlwas weak, and she did not wish her to lbe disturbed or to have her mind excited on any subject. 'But, madam,' said I, 'this child may die, and without -the salvation that Jesus gives she is lost; she is not too young to understanLdthe story of the cross in its sim- plest form, and if you will not yourself accept the pearl of great price, do not withhold it from your child.' And what do you suppose was her reply?"   i}  C.1HARIT Y.                 213 Here Miss Prudence gave a sob, and Mrs. School- craft after pausing a moment to mark the effect of her words, continued:- "It was this : I hope I have found the pearl of com- mon sense, and I tell you I will not have my child dis.- turbed.' I have no words, ladies;, to paint my feelings as I looked upon that apparently dying child and upon that heartless mother.' I left the house, praying that God would have mercy upon them all." j And it seems that God heard you in behalf of the child at least," said Mrs. Deacon Barnes. Surely we 'should take courage when we remember her providen-. tial restoration to a state of health that would admit of her coming where she could hear the works of salva-. tion. "That we should," replied Mrs. Schoolcraft; "but tct go on with my story: In December, when we were. first appointed for the blessed work in which we are now' engaged, where do you suppose we found this woman? In a pretty cottage nowned by Stanford, onfe of the most noted libertines in the city, and it was well furnished with all that was needed to make one comfortable, and ' Stanford himself had just left the house. Now, my  sisters, what could we infer from this change? For my part there was but one conclusion that I could come to, and I t1ell you it made my heart ache; but I felt that I must do my duty, so, nerving myself for the task, I uttered such words of warning againstD sin as I could command at the moment; told them that God's love and mercy extended to each and all; that no sin was so great but, if repented of, would find forgiveness. But I might just as well have talked to stones, for all the  &#xD;<pb n="214-215" xml:id="VAC8168-00000108"/> 214     M1AYWEED BLOSSOMS. impression, I could make; and were it not for the story of Mary Magdalene, and the words of Jesus in refer- ence to the woman taken in adultery, I should think that there was no hope for such creatures. But I have not told all yet: I left some tracts upon the table, and as we passed through the gate I heard Mrs. Taylor say, 'Don't do that, Helen.' Sister Crowell here, lodked, back. The door was standing open, and she saw Helen putting the tracts into the stove; sh you see that the daughter is even more hardened that the mother."  "It seems to me," said Miss Prudence, " that I could  put a stop to such doings had I the law-making power. Why, I would shut up every woman that wouldn't be-  have herself; they should be kept in close-confinement,  and not permitted to lead our sons and brothers ast:ray. It's a burning shame in a Christian land." "And 'that brings me to another point," said Mrrs. Schoolcraft;, "and no doubt it is the thought of what I amr now about to relate that drew the last remark from  sister Crowell. It seems that by some means the only'  son of one of our most respectable citizens, though not a member of this church, became acquainted with this  Helen Merrill, and .ws actually so infatuated with her that he attempted to take her into company in spite  of her reputation.

Miss Crowell picked it up, calling after her at the same instant to inform her of her loss. She turned just as we glanced at the direction. It was Helen Merrill, and the letter was directed to William Holden, New' York city. lWe were too astonished to act promptly, and, ere we had time to think, she had reached her hand and taken it. No one was to blanie, it was all so sudden; but that letter should have been kept and handed to his father." "I felt so shocked," said Miss Prudence, "at the tlought of the disgrace of being seen speaking to such a creature on the street, that I forgot what duty was; and all we can do now is to inform Mr. Holden of what we have discovered. I don't know as it is Christian- like, but if it was my brother that she was trying her deceitful arts upon, I really believe I should feel like taking her life." "God help us to leave vengeance in his hands," re- sponded Mrs. Barnes; "but it is indeed a hard duty to keep up a feeling of Christian meekness and resignation under all circumstances. Still we must not be disheart- ened; the work goes bravely on.  Our church was never in so prosperous a condition as now. Let us continue to pray in faith, and who knows but God may convert even these wretched women."        , Here a little meek-faced woman, who had not hitherto spoken, said that she could not understand why it was t      "'  &#xD;<pb n="216-217" xml:id="VAC8168-00000109"/> 216      MA YWRVEED DBLOSSOMS. that so much indignation should be expressed against outcast women, and so little against the men who make them so. "We talk of the outcast leading our sons astray, and forget that [somebody's sons first led her astray. Now, ladies, I think that the virtuous women of society are as much to blame for this state of things as any one. You may think it a strange assertion, but I believe it to be true,"  "Pray explain yourself, Mrs. Blackman," said Mrs. Schdolcraft, with dignity. "I am not aware of encourp aging vice il any form, and as to yourself, why you ought to kinow as to that; the world is full of wickedness."  "5 es, and self-deception too," said the little woman, with more spirit than usual, "and it becomes us to pull the beam ,out of our own eyes, that we may see clearly to pull the mote out of the eye of another. Now what I mean is just this: we all of us look upbn a man who is guilty of sin in this respect with more leniency than upon a woman.

What had become of their horror of, vice? "Thlese people were not Christians, Mrs. Blackman; and I hardly think it fair to cite them ,as evidence of our being at fault," said Mrs. Barnes. "But the question is, do we not act upon the same principle? Do we not shrink from these poor creatures  i  as from contamination, while we have scarcely a frown for their companions in vice? Which of us would refuse, suppose you, to treat Henry Stanwood with common politeness?" "Common politeness is due to every one, Mrs. Black-. man." "But do we accord it to the outcast, Mrs. School- craft?"  "While we are in the world we cannot wholly ignore its customs," was that lady's reply ; and then, to put a stop to further remark of the kind, added, " we wish nothing introduced here to disturb the harmony of feel- il1 ing Which should prevail in order to successful effort, and I think such discussions unprofitable. Will the 1  secretary please'read the minutes of the last mecting?" This, of course, prevented further conversation, except the whispered asides; but Miss Betsy Jones was heard   to sai, as she glanced towards Mrs. Blackman, "Poor thing! slce is no doubt thinking of her sister; no wonder she feels badly. It was a sad case. -Susan Smith was a pretty girl, and we all thought a good one; no one i supposed that she would turn out as she did."  What, Mrs. Blackman's sister?"

She was promised in marriage to one of the first young men in the country, whern a gentleman from the East somewhere, I forget where, came into the place, and, attracted by Susan's beauty, paid her particular attention. This caused trouble between her and Winslow, she taking part with the new lover. The stranger bringing forged references, as it was afterwards ascertained, deceived her into a false marriage, lived with her a few weeks, and then deserted 'her. The ]poor girl became reckless, left her friends, and, they say, is now a woman of the town." "Well, she- should have been true to her vows. What right had she to be flirting with another? I should have considered myself as much bound as though I-had been married; for my part I see no -necessity for such mistakes, nor do I believe there is any." "Neither do I," said Miss Betsy;  but somehow I always felt sorry for Susan." The business of the meeting was soon' finished;' the laborers chosen, and their field of oDerationsj for the month assigned them, anl! each returned to lhel respec- tive home.  Meanwhile let us look in upon another scene: It is the Sabbath. Mrs. Reid has so far won upon Mrs. Taylor's. confidence as to draw from her a promise of her' history; "but not now," said she; "I cannot tell you all in the presence of Eloisc. I cannot ' burden her young mind with the knowledge of what her mother and sister have ben accused of. I should have left this place before now,/ and gone among friends, but she has been too delicate to bear the fatigue of the journey; the least excite nent would prove fatal to her.

If you will come next Sunday I can talk with you, for Eloise will be at church, and after church sile stays for Sabbath school. Poor child! she is not really strong enough to go, but she enjoys it so much that I cannot deny her." And so, on Sunday, the very one after the meeting of the tract distributors last referred to, we find Mrs. Reid at the house of Mrs. Taylor instead of at church. Very wicked, no doubt, to forsake the sanctuary for the society of one whom the World has rejected; but so it was. Let us look in upon that home for a moment. j   Helen is weeping; and Mrs. Taylor can hardly keep back the'tears that her proud spirit will not permit  to flow. We will reserve the history for another chapter, only giving here some of the conversation that followed it. "I think, Mrs. Taylor, I may speak plainly to you; you will not be offended?" said Mrs. Reid. "Certainly not. I feel that you are a friend; no Pharisaical idea of superiority, no feeling that it iwas your mission to seek and convert the sinner, lias led you here time after time. You have shown none of this, but only that genuine sympathy which one can accept from another without a sense of degradation." "I honor you, Mrs. Taylor, for your self-respect; but still we must adapt ourselves to conditions, to things as we find them ; and do you not think if you had been a little more yielding, not quite so proudly reserved in reference to your own affairs, that it would have been better?" "Perhaps it might; but what right had they to intrude I!  &#xD;<pb n="220-221" xml:id="VAC8168-00000111"/> 220     MAYWEED BLOSSOAIS. themselves upon me in the way that they did ? It was not the faict of their calling, but their manner that offended me. Their every look and movement said as plainly as words could have said it, 'You are a poor, needy creature; that we, out of the abundance ?f our goodness, have come to assist, and you should recognize this fact, and be particularly grateful to us, and sub- servient to our superior wisdom.' Bah ! I understand such Christianity as that. Surrender all you have into its keeping, - give up your own judgment, self-rdspect, and all, and then they will make you the objects of their peculiar care, because, doing so, ministers to their self- righteousness; but dare' to be yourself- to keep your own counsel, use your own judgment instead of theirs, -and you might as well be in a den of tigers." "What you say has too much truth in it;, but it only confirms me in my position, Mrs. Taylor. If you really were in a den of tigers, you certainly would not let them rend you and yours if you could prevent it by studying and adapting yourself to their natures. Now it seems to me that if you could have so far conquered your pride--for I must call it pride -'as to have made, some explanation of your circumstances to those peo- ple, it seems to me that you would have had their sym- pathy and protection." "Yes,, every shepherd watches over his own ~sheep,p and every merchant over 'his own goods; and had I per- mitted themn to own me, they woull doubtless have cared for me. No, I will be a free woman, and suffer the consequences." "And I," said Helen, "will sustain my mother and suffer with her. I should scorn to see her receiving the  CHARITYI         221 sympathy of people who have insulted her as they did the second time they called on us. Why, had she been the keeper of a brothel, they could not have been more rude to her; and then the tracts they left - those written for the vilest of sinners. I felt like putting them out of doors, and I did put their tracts into the stove as soon as they left." "Do, you know the names of those who visited you?" asked Mrs. Reid. "I have since learned that one of them is the minis- ter's mother, and the other a Miss, somebody - an old maid, one of the prudish, sanctimonious ones; I shouldI think from !her appearance that a man was her especial horror."  " Don't reflect on old maids, Helen," said Mrs. Reid, laughing; "you may be one yourself yet.:" "And if I am I will not crXy 'sour grapes,'" was the quick retort. "But in reference to those tract distributors," coni. tinued Mrs. Reid, "they are not all the church; neither are all like them. There are good people there - those wvho would gladly be your friends if they knew how to reach you. But the way has been hedged up; appear- ances are against you ; their minds have been poisoned, and it was a duty you owed to yourself to explain the unfortunate circumstances which have caused you to be suspicioned. You have not done this; you have not done yourself justice, and still you blamhe bothers for injustice. Are you consistent?" "Perhaps not; I have never looked upon the subject in that light," was the reply. "I know I am proud, but I am not haughty or insulting ^;and I cannot accept such &#xD;<pb n="222-223" xml:id="VAC8168-00000112"/> 222      M YWEED BLOSSOMS. treatment from others in a spirit of meekness, I assure you." "Eloise finds firi inds and kind treatment." "I know she d es, Mrs. Reid; but a demon right from hell could not do otherwise than treat her kindly. If there is an angel anywhere in the universe, she is one; but I see her coming, and we must say nothing further on this subject now. I feel that I shall not keep her long, and I must protect her from sorrow as far as possible." Eloise came wearily up the walk. Helen met her at the door, and took her in her arms. "Are you tired, darling?" "A little, Nellie, sister; but we had such Ai good time, I wish that you could have been there. The minister told us of Jesus taking children in his arms and blessing them, and saying, 'Of such is the kingdom of heaven;' and while he was talking, little Mary Gray, who, died before we left Rochester, came to me. She did, mother. I saw her plainly, and she was so beautiful; I saw her but a moment, but it made me so happy, and I have felt ever since as if God and angels were all about rne." Helen and her m6ther exchanged glances, and the mother said, "It must have been beautiful, dItrlingt.  But here is Mrs. Reid; you have not spoken to her yet." O, Mrs. Reid, I am so glad to see you; but what do you suppose it means?" "It means that God loves you, dear; but you are weary now; would you not like to be quiet, and let me i\  ' soothe you to sleep?" "Yes, I should like it so much; your hands are so soft, and they make my head feel so good."   -  CHARI'Y.  '     223 "Well, lie down here and close your eyes then, for I must go soon." The child was soon fast to sleep under the magnetic touch of her friend's fingers, and then Mrs. Reid took her leave. But few words were spoken, for a holy awe seemed to have fallen upon each, even as if they were in the presence of the angels that Eloise had spoken of. Yes, they parted, and to meet very soon under circumstances that they little dreamned of, while those who remained pondered upon the words the child had uttered, and she that left doing the same.  CHAPTER III. MRS. TAYOR'S STORY. "I WAS the youngest child of rich parents. There were five of us, three sons and two daughters. My father owned one of the largest farms in County, in the old Empire State, besides some city property. I was the pet and darling of the household, and my days passed like a summer dream. At twenty I married' the i man of my choice, for some years a clerk, and -after- ,l  wards partner in the store of my mother's brothers in the city of New Yorik. ? I  " aWe went to housekeeping in a pleasant cottage, that has since been torn down to make way for the advan.. cing tide of business, and a splendid block of stores now  &#xD;<pb n="224-225" xml:id="VAC8168-00000113"/> 224      MA YWEED BLOSSOMS. stands in its place. In about fifteen months my Helen, here, was born. She grew finely; and I doubt it there were many happier homes anywhere than ours was. But, alas our sunshine did not last. True,. the, clouds at first were not dark enough to obscure our heart ha)p- piness, still they were clouds, and heavy ones. "George had gone largely into business, depending upon father to help him if he should get into a close ti place. Indeed, father had encourag(ed him to do this;  but just as he was about to avail himself of the offer,  word came tlat through some unfortunate speculations, together with a heavy indorsement for a friend who had  f filed, and left the debt for hiln to pay, my filther hadt  lost his splendid property, and had become a poor man. One of my brothers came forward and saved a small remnant of what had been so ample, but the other two were still at home, and what little they had saved went in the general wreck. The shock was too great for one   who had Aever known aulght of poverty, and poor fatther  sank unde it. Mother went to reside with the brother before spoken of, but she tarried not long. The loss  of property, I believe, she could have borne, for she  was a wom n of great fortitude, but of a deep, strong, affectional ature; and when father left, and soon after ' brother Henry was accidentally killed, under circum- stances that were particularly painful, she sank underl  the accumu ation of grief. It was more than her fralle, already weakened by disease and years, could bear.  "Ithought I should go wild with grief; but I saw that something troubled George, and I strove to be as ,f cheerful as possible on his account. Finally he came  to me one day and said, 'Amy, darlilg, I might as  . i i1 ii r1   CHARITY.         225 well tell you all. I must bring my business to a close. I can go on no longer. I may possibly save a few hundreds, but that will be all, and we shall have to leave here with comparatively nothing, go into some new place, and start anew.' 'I can bear it,' said I; 'anything, if you and the children are left me.' Eloise was then about six months old; Helen five years. George had struggled on two years after father's death, and he could struggle no longer. I said that the clouds at first were not dark enough to obscure our hearts' happiness. They were light compared with what fol.. lowed. I loved my parents, I loved my brother; but the love I felt for themn was as nothing compared to that; I bore my husband; and looking back, all clouds seem light compared witth e one that overshadowed my life when he was taken from me; 'but I anticipate. e' Mr. Merrill made a statement of his business to his crieditors, and told them that if they would leave things in his hands, so that he could dispose of them without sa* rifice, they should lose nothing, or next to nothing; but if not, there would be loss, and he could not prevent it. "They trusted to his honor, and left him to dispose of his goods at the best advantage he could. Every creditor was satisfied, every debt was paid, and we saved just one thousand dollars. With this money we moced to Rochester, bought us a little home, alld my husband Went to clerking again; and I tell you, Mrs. Reid, I never was prouder of him in my life than then; for had he not been honorable? - had he not come forth like gold tried in the fire, with not only name but conscience untarnished? "We were happy in our new home, for I cared not 15  &#xD;<pb n="226-227" xml:id="VAC8168-00000114"/> 226      MAYWEED   LO for wealth, so that my husband and clildren were with me; so you see that the clouds had not even yet Obscured the sunlight of our hearts. A  y ear sped away -a a year of blissful content, and thenthe thunderbolt fell, and the lightning reached my heart. My husband sickened and died, and the light went out of my life. I would have gone too, but my children held me - my childrel: his children, and for his sake I must live and care for tem. T here werno debts, a nd George, when he bought our little home, had it deeded to me; consequently there was no court or law to step in and interfere with me. It was mine, and no one could take it from me. (t So you see I had a home, but what should I do for aliving'? flow should I support myself and children? Pwould ooner have died than part with e.  ha no resources but my own hands 'and brain, and I set to work. I commenced taking boarders.  I had some nice thins that we' brought from New York, which I nihjgos that we  pold, ancd bought plains substantial ones to put in their ,old , andwhought plat o  , seelry, and places.  sold my gold watch, my best jewelry and two of myi best dresses, and also Mr. Merrill's clothes, for I kirnew that if he could see me and know what wa -doing, nthing could please him better than to have all that belonged to him used for the benefit of his family   ith the money thus obtained, together with a ,hundre( and twenty-five dollars that was due to him from hi employer, I put up an addition to my house, giving m more rooms, and soon I was in a condition to take te boarders, and make them comfortable. Helen was in her seventh year, and Eloise abo two years old, and with the help of a small girl to waV the dishes, and a woman to wash and do what else s   CHARITY         227 could one day in a week, I did the work for ten boarders  for six months. Then, finding that I should break ::r ldown if I did not, and that I could afford it, I hired a ( ood strong girl to take my place, and toqk care of the children, and did my sewing myself. And this I kept ip six years. I then married Mr. Taylor, the father of my little -Mary. I had been acquainted with him :: about a year, he boarding with me a part of the time. f He was not willing that I should continue to toil as I had done, so I'gave up my boarders for a while, and he -"I  supported us with labor. I say labdr, for he had no 1  nmeans, only his salary as head clerk. Having been out of health a great portion of his life, he had never malrried, and never accumulated property. W" e lived very happily together for about three years. He was very inld, and his love and sympathy were far better than living alone; but my trials were not ended. At the end of that time his old disease, - that with which he had suffered so many years, and had finally believed cured, - came back upon him with redoubled force. He was taken with bleeding at the lungs, and after six months of suffering he went hence, and I was again a widow. V:  "I went back to my old business of taking boarders, and kept it up till aome seven months since, and then, I . as some of my old neighbors were going to Cincinnati , to make themselves a home, I sold my placd and started to go with them. I came as far as Cleveland, when 'Eloise was taken sick, the journey proving too much for her. I stored my things in a warehouse, renting a !. single room for a month, and, taking such things as Ii would make her comfortable, moved into it, intending y   ..

But she became very sick; and when she was at the worst, and so weak that I knew the least excite- ment might carry her off, these tract distributors came to see me. -' They were not distri luting tracts then; but some one had told them of my child's sickness, and they came, seeming fully impressed that I was an object of charity, and would be thankful for whatever crumbs they chose to offer. "I was full of anxiety for my darling ;i my heart was sore with grief lest I should lose her; and their manner was so patronizing, it seemed to me insulting, so I don't suppose that I was very gracious; and besides, I never did believe in their hell-fire religion, my parents being Universalists. They took it for granted that I was a hardened wretch, who rejected God's mercy, and seeing  the condition Eloise was in, seemed to think it their duty to save her if they could do nothing for me, so the  began to talk to her about dying, asking her about Jesus, and other things of the kind, and I had absolutely to forbid them saying anything to her, to tell them I would ' not have it, ere they would desist; and then they left,  filling my ears with warnings of the wrath to come.  Eloise became so excited from the scene that I feared for her life; but by giving her as strong an opiate as I dared to, I at length got her quiet l "And this was my first experie ce with those who are now distributing religious readi lg through your city, and they have been the bane of my ife since."  How so?" asked Mrs. Reid. " do not see why they should wilfully injure you." "Well, wilfully or not, they h ve injured me by ,                    -  '   229 I0       \ CIHARITYE         229 their mean, suspicious, and slanderous tongues, till I feel sometimes that I cannot forgive them, even if God does." "Forgive us, as we forgive those that trespass against us."  '"True; but oneecannot always feel that. I am not like you, Mrs. Reid -I wish I was, You are the only womlan that has treated me as a Christian should since I have been in the city. Do you .believe in' their three Gods, their election, and their hell-fire?"  I cannot say that I do; at least, not as these things. are generally understood." ;"  "I thought not." "I know many good people who do." "Perhaps so," said Mrs. Taylor; while Helen asked, "Do you not think that such a belief has a tendency to make people hard and unfeeling towards those who differ from them?". "It may," said Mrs. Reid. "I never have thought much upon that point; and still it must be so, for how else can I account for the cruelty of this professedly H Christian nation towards the black race?"  What else could you expect from those who believe that God from all eternity elected some to salvation and \  left others for damnation? TWhat else could you expect but cruelty, not only to the black race, but to all who t- t  do not come within the pale of their sanctified circle? Uit{ But to continue my story. Eloise gained but slowly, and I saw that she was not going to be able for some time to stand a journey of three hundred niles by the slow process of canal travel, so I rented a cottage on Street, took my things from the warehouse, and ilb !]i!  &#xD;<pb n="230-231" xml:id="VAC8168-00000116"/> i230 230      JIAYWEED hLoSSOMS. concluded to make myself as comfortable v;s I could there. "I had been there about six weeks, when those women came again, and this time they were distributing tracts. Stanford, the owner of the house, hac just been there, and his manner had been such that we were' exceedingly annoyed thereby, so much so tha: I resolved to leave as soon as the month was up. They seemed surprised to find me there, and, feeling bitter, no doubt, as they remembered myi want of submission to them on their previous call, came immediately to the very worst conclusion they coull possibly airive at. "You seem much improved in your condition since we last met,' said the elder lady, glancing about the room. "' My child is some better,' I replied. "'Glad to hear it'; but I was not thinkinig of that particularly. You seemed to be needy before, and that was what induced us to call; we think it a Christian duty to see that the poor do not suffer, especially when sick. Now, however, you are well situated, with all the comforts of life about you. To what shall. we attribute the change?' "'To what you please,' said I, for I was vexed at their impudence. Their manner said more than their 'words; still I did not dream of what they were insinua- ting. I had passed through much, but my character had remained untouched, and I never once imagined that aught could be brought up against me in that direction. "'To what we please!' she repeated. 'We should be verysorry to think anything wrong.' They had already told their business, and seemed to be selecting   6YHABSy.      ,   231 such tracts as they thought would suit my case. 'We should be sorry to think anything, wrong, but circum- stances are against you.' 'What do you mean?' I exclaimed. "'It is plain enough what we mean. Your beautiful daughter, and your changed circumstances, changed from that poor, scantily furnished room to this beautiful, well-furnished cottage, belonging to one of the worst libertines in the city, and he leaving here just as we came in, and with the air of one who belonged here.' "I was dumb with astonishment. I do not believe I couldl have spoken to save my life." "And yet, a few words of explanation right here would have saved you much trouble," said Mrs. Reid. "'We need to be wise as serpents, as well as harmless as doves. Had you quietly told them of the mistake they had made - that you had just learned the character of your landlord and wished to find another house, askino them to assist you in the matter, you would have tuined the tide in your favor. Ah, Mrs. Taylor, with all your independence of character, I find you do not understand human nature." "Not the 'nature of wolves in sheep's clothing, I con- fess, Mrs; Reid, and I do think that these extra religious ones are the most impudent people upon earth; and as to doing what you speak of, I could as easily havt died as to stop to make explanations, and ask the assistance of those who had so grossly insulted me. As I was saying, I was struck dumb with astonishment. T They took my silence as evidence of guilt, and proceeded to' warn me of the terrible consequences of sin, and to tell of the mercy of God that would be extended to those  &#xD;<pb n="232-233" xml:id="VAC8168-00000117"/> 232      A , .

I don't know what I should have,done if they had not." "They didn't f4rget to leave their tracts, though; but I made short worlk of them," said Helen. Yes, Helen p t them into the fire before the women were fairly out of the house.. I tried to check her, but she was too excited to listen. I should like to have looked at them, just for the sake of knowing what selec- tions the Pharisaical hypocrites had made." "Ah, Mrs. Taylor," said Mrs. Reid, with a smile, "you will never be happy so long as you entertain such, feelings. Bitternesp of spirit is incompatible with true peace of mind. Why not pity their weakness and self- conceit, and let them go at that?" "That; we may do, Mrs. Reid, when not affc6ted thereby; but when we are so situated that they can sting us to the soul, it is vquite a different thing. I know that there are not many like you, but' I doubt if even you could have borne it with perfect equanimity." "Perhaps not. I have borne much, however, in my time." t "Let me see: this was on Monday," continued Mrs. Taylor; "and the next evening a young man by the name of Holden came and invited Helen to go to a party with him the following night. She went, and was trealted in such a manner that he was obliged to bring her home again." X" rWhere did Helen become acquainted with this young man?" asked Mrs. Reid. "O, he was one of Eloise's friends; she always attracts   t.[:t ,      CHARITY.        233 every one t9'her. He had been to Albany on business, ijl and "came in the packet with us firom R ochester to Buffilo, and there we took the same steamer for Cleve- land Well, the attraction between him and Eloise was mutual; she thought there was no one like him, and when taken sick she could not bear to, have him out of her sight for a moment. I expected to go, to Cincin- I   nati, as I told you; and still inthnded to go on when we parted with Mr. Holden at the landing. I thought the cllild would be better off on the lake; but she grew worse instead, and I was obliged to remain. Soon after we moved into Stanford's house, Eloise, having so fir re- covered that she could go out a little, the girls met their, or rather her, old friend - for Helen had barely spoken to hin on the boat - on the street, and Eloise was so de- light d that, child-like, nothing would do but that he must go and see where we lived; thus the acquaintance was renewed. We found that we were near neighbors. The young man brought his sister to see us, p6romised J I that l-is mother would call, and things were going on very pleasantly till those women came around. From that time everything was chatnged. The young man went to New York city soon after, and with the excep- tion of an occasional letter to Helen, the acquaintance was entirely broken off." "Yes, mother," said Helen, "and the last letter I wrote him, telling him that I was not willing to keep up a correspondence, with his family feeling as they do -it was last week, you know- well, I had it in my hand, with two or three other letters, on my way to the office, when I dropped it. I should not have known it, only some one who was walking behind me saw it fall,  &#xD;<pb n="234-235" xml:id="VAC8168-00000118"/> '234     MA1 YWEED BLOSSOMS. and called to me. Upon turning about, I found myself face to face with these very women." "Did they read the address, think you?" asked Mrs. Taylor. "I think they did ; indeed, I am certain they did; and had they known who it was that dropped it, .I don't think they would have called to me at all. I believe, from their looks, they would have kept it as it was, had they had time to think before I took it." "Iwish they had kept it, and given it to William's father, for then they would have known that you are not seeking to entrap their son. Yes, I wish they had; it would have been much better than now, for those' saints will be sure to inform the Holdens, and it will make trouble; you sec if it don't, now." "You say," said Mrs. Reid, " that from the day these women called at your house last, the pleasant relations between your family and the Holdenis ceased. What reason have you for thinking that they had anything to do with it? You have been complaining of them for drawing conclusions without a proper understanding of the facts in the case. Are you sure that you are not running into the same error?" "Helen, my daughter, are you willing that Mrs. Reid should see the first letter Mr. Holden wrote you after he left the city?" "Certainly, mother; I will go and get it." The letter was brought, and put into Mrs. Reid's hands. There was nothing in it but what one friend might write to another; but the portion that most par- ticularly interests us was as follows - I can never forgive myself for subjecting you to the   I          q   insult you received on that never-to-be-forgotten even- ing. Strong in my consciousness of your innocence, I thought I could protect you, and make others see as I did; but you see how miserably I failed., But I am most vexed when I think how the, reports against your fair fame originated. I always did hate those long- faced, sanctimonious people, who are always talking of man's depravity and God's mercy and goodness. As for the mercy and goodness, I can't see it, if their doc- trines are true. As I was saying, I always did hate that class of people, for if you fail to accord to them the certain degree of deference that they demand of you in virtue of their saintship, they are as cruel and vindictive as they represent God to be to the finally impenitent. Well, my folks seemed well pleased with you till these tract distributors came around and filled mother's ears with a long story of charitable conclusions drawn from certain facts, put together to suit themselves, to wit: that Stanford- the old sinner- had boasted of his pretty bird,' and that they had found you in a miser- able room, with scarcely any furniture, the first time they saw you, and the next time you were in that nice cot- tage, with everything comfortable about you, and Stan- ford just leaving the house. Now mother does not pretend to be a Christian; but she always accords those who do a certain amount of respect that keeps her in favor with them, and she is particularly sensitive in regard to the honor of her family; so when I came home she began to upbraid me with keeping such company, and above all for taking my innocent sister there. This ituade me angry, for I had seen enough of the world to know that you were as innocent as beautiful. Would    &#xD;<pb n="236-237" xml:id="VAC8168-00000119"/> 236      MA YWEED BLOSSOMiS. to Heaven you were less beautiful, for then you wouild not excite the envy of cross old maids and ministers' mothers! perhaps it is not just according to etiquetite - for me to tell you this, and I would not did I not know that you an-d your good mother have been cruelly wronged, and I believe the most of it has been caused because you would not kiss the Pope's great toe, in the form of modern Protestantism. 'Yes, I became angry, and in a spirit of defiance invited you to that party; but Heaven knows that I would sooner hayp cut my right hand off thar. to have taken you there had I supposed it possible that you could be so cruelly insulted. One thing is sure, however: I shall never see a tract dis- tributor without hating him." This was all that had any bearing upon the subject in hand, so I make no further quotation. Mrs. Reid handed back the letter without a word of comment, while a look of triumph from Mrs. Taylor said as plainly as words could.*have spoken it, "You see that I have evidence in the case." After a moment's silence, Mrs. Taylor resumed: "I thought my poor girl's heart was broken. She wept incessantly for two days; but she had not borne enough yet. On Saturday of the same week Stanford came back. - This time he did not stop at hints, but came out boldly with his infamous proposition; offered a price for my child; and when rejected, with indigna- tion, said that her character was gone now, arid she might as well be his in deed'as in name; and when peremptorily ordered from the house, left vowing ven- geance. This was on Saturday evening, and on Mon.. day morning, just tats I was preparing to go out to    look for another house, a gentleman called and asked to look at the place, saying le understood it was for sale. He looked over the house and yard, talked with Eloise of the book she was reading, asked what books she liked, and managed in one way and another to pro- long his stay, till I began to be impatient for him to leave; still he was so gentlemanly and respectful that I could find no excuse for dismissing him. I noticed, however, that he was one of that class of persons who have their eyes open; keeping boarders -so long made me-somewhat observant, and I saw that he was studying us without seeming to do so. I saw also that he had not made known the real object of his call. At length he said to me, Madam, I hope you will not consider me intruding, but do you know the character of the man to whom this house belongs?' "I have recently become aware of it,' I replied. How? ' 'In a manner that leavbs no possible room for doubt.' "Pardon me,' said he; 'I should not have asked you that question, but if you will permit me to be frank with you, I will acknowledge that mny excuse for calling here this morninog was a feigned one. I am bad enough, Heaven knows, but I have never yet been guilty of betraying innocence; and my advice to you is to leave this house as-*soon as possible. Reports are in -circula- tion prejudicial to you; but they don't deceive Ben Wil- son. I have seen enough of the world to be a good judge of character, and I know that you do not deserve the name they give you. I called for the purpose of learning for myself whether these things were so. .

He is not only a libertine, but a malicious, vengeful one. Ile seems to have an especial spite towards those he takes a fancy to, if they hold out against him. I have known of more than one poor girl who lhas been nmade desper- ate, and at last fallen into his power, through reports that'he first set in circulation against her. I tell you he will stop at nothing; therefore I advise yout to leave this house assquickly and as quietly as possible.'  "^ Thank you, sir,' said I, 'for your advice, but it is uncalled for. . Iwas just preparing to go out on that very errand.' I-"He seemed confused&amp; at the promptness and quiet- ness of my reply, but rallying therefrom said, 'Madaml, I know I amn a villain for intruding myself upon you, and especially as I acknowledge the motive was not a good one; but when I learned mny mistake, I desired to make all the recompense in my power for ever daring to think ill of you; and now I most humbly ask your par- don, and hope, for the sake of that sweet child, --turning to Eloise, who had been absent during the latter part of the conversation, and now re-entered the roon, - I hope, for the sake of this child, that you will permit me to be your friend, for I feel that I can learn lessons of virtue from her innocent face.' "'The past is forgotten,' I replied, t"uchel by the earnestness of his manner, 'and the future depends upon yourself.' rThanks, a thousand thanks, madam ; I will see tliat you have no cause of complaint,' said he, bowing hitm- self out. I then started on my tour of house hunting,   I44   and succeeded in finding this little cottage, where I have since lived in peace. "It being near the church, Eloise can go to Sabbath school, and sometimes to church once a day. Helen and I do not go, for, as I was saying, the minister's mother is one of those who made me so much trouble, though they say lhe is a good man. As warm weather comes on, Eloise seems better, and I hope after a little to be able to leave the place. Warm weather always seemed to agree with her better than cold, and that is one reason why I left Rochester last autumn. I knew that the climate was milder in Cincinnati than there; but, poor child, she was not strong enoughl to go through, and so I was obliged to remain here. Could I have known how it would be, I should have staid where I was." "Do you ever hear anything from the gentleman you last spoke of, - the one who advised you to leave Stan- ford's house?" asked Mrs. Reid. "He calls occasionally, and brings Eloise books to read. He seems kind-hearted and respectful; but I do not encourage him, and so he comes but seldomn. I should not permit him to come at all but for her sake. But the child is lonely; she has not been used to so retired a life, and she hails his visits with delight./ Then he always brings her something fo read, and his selec- tions are excellent."  And here comes in the conversation related in the last chapter, when the return of Eloise puts a stop thereto, and Mrs. Reid, after having soothed her to sleep, returns home.  &#xD;<pb n="240-241" xml:id="VAC8168-00000121"/> CHAPTER IV. FURTHER DEVELOPMENTS OF CHARITY. MRS. REID had been trying to induce Helen and her mother to go to church with her, and at length succeeded in obtaining a promise that they would go on the Wed- nesday evening following the Sunday that she had spent at their house. Eloise was so much better thahn usual that for the first time she was permitted to go out at night, and together they entered the well-filled church and listened to a fine discourse from  the Rev. MAr. Schoolcraft, given especially to the young, and more particularly to the young converts who had, recently been gathered into the fold.  He painted in glowing colors the snares that beset the feet of the young, and especially the young men of our large cities. "Daughters," said he, "are more particu- la'ly under the eye of the mother; but our young men go forth to oreast the storms of life, and the seductions of vice meet them  on- every side; bright eyes and sparkling wine, and all the allurements that aIppeal to the senses; and while all need the grace of God, surely our young men need it in an especial manner, if they would. keep their feet from falling and their souls from sin." William tIolden's mother and sister were there, but they-brushed by our little company in haughty silence; and Mrs. Reid noticed that whenever the minister spoke   of the temptations that beset young men, scores of eyes were directed towards where they sat. "I never realized," said she, to Mr. Whitney, the next day, " what it was to be under the ban before. It made me sick and faint. I do not wonder that the out- cast is seldom, if ever, reclaimed; the manner in which society meets them is enough to sink them to the lowest hell of degradation. Why, I would not go through another such ordeal as that of last night for anything; that is, nothing but a sense of duty or the hope of doing good could induce me thereto. It is worse than work- ing for the slave." "You believe them innocent, do you not?" he asked. Z"I do." "And you yourself was acting under a sense of lduty, or rather a desire to do good ? ' " Most certainly-4 was." "Then you have not half estimated the difficulties under which the outcast lies; for instead of conscious innocence and a noble purpose to sustain them, they have the added load of guilt to bear." "Yes; and God help them, for man will not." "Rather say, woman will not; for if ever so innocent, and thdy get the reputation of being otherwise, the niore a man tries to do for them the more it injures them."' " But woman does not pull them down; she only puts her foot on them after they are down, or are supposed to be," replied Mrs. Reld, with some spirit. ' Woman is sometimes man's most efficient aid in dragging woman down, Mrs. Reid," answered Mr. Whitney.

I know that woman is cowardly, and sometimes cruel to her own sex; but her reputation is her all, and she knows it. Were she treated as leniently as man is, even by your sex, it would be different; but with the man is power; he controls the whole machinery of society; can do about as he pleases, consequently can afford to be generous. When your sex pleads superiority over us in that respect, it makes me think of the generosity of the southern chivalry, compared to that of the northern laborer. One is called whole-souled and generous, be- cause another earns his money for llin, :anl he hardly knows how he gets it; the other, close and small in his dealings, because having every dollar to earn by the sweat of his own brow, he knows just how it comes. Reputation, virtue, as the world styles virtue, is cheap to you, but to us it is not. The old adage expresses it correctly; I remember reading it in* the old-fashioned spelling-book, so long ago as when I first learned to read: 'Man tarnishes his; character and brightens it again, but if woman chance to swerve from the strict- est rules of virtue, "Ruin ensues,; eproach and endless shame; One false step forever blasts her fame; In vain the loss she may deplore, In vain look back to what she was before, She sets like stars that fall to rise no more."' With this state of things to contend with, I think it hardly fair for man to boast of his lenity, when com- pared with that of woman. Why, the highest men in the nation, many of them, are guilty of that which, had a woman been guilty of the same, she would have been sent to Five Points instead of Congress." e    4   Hold, hold, Mrs. Reid, and I will give up beat!" said Mr. Whitney, laughing. "Your arguments are just, and I only wish there were thousands like you, to advocate the cause of your sex." When Mrs. Reid returned home at night, she found the minister's mother, Mrs. Schoolcraft, waiting for her ; ahd after the usual salutations were over, the lady began:-- "I called, Mrs. Reid, to see what your idea was in coming to church last night with those women?" "What my idea was?  Why, I supposed you held your meetings on purpose for people to attend; and I think it the duty of a Christian woman to ask her neigh- bors to go with her to the house of God." "And so it is our duty to encourage the humble peni.- tent, wherever found; but there is a limit to all things..  There comes a time, the Bible says, when even the Spirit, God's Holy Spirit, ceases to strive with the rebellious." "Have we a tight, Mrs. Schooleraft, even if this ,be true, to decide when it has taken place?" "Perhaps not; still we have our reason, and must judge something from appearances; and these women seem perfectly hardened; their conduct is shameless, and it is a disgrace for any decent woman to be seen in their conmpany." "Had you seen them weep, as I have, you would hardly call them haridened; and what have they done, Mrs. Schooleraft, to merit the appellation of shame-. less?

"How did you learn that?" "Mrs. Holden told me last evening. Stanford told her husband so yesterday." "And how did he happen to learn where they were at last?"             /   Why, ;you see, Holden's folks have' a son, who is perfectly infatuated with this girl; she has made him believe that she is purity itself; she evidently designed to entrap him into mirriage.

"Well, you see, sister Crowell "and myself were out distributing, tracts last week, and we saw a lady just ahead of us drop a letter. We called to her, to let her know of her loss; picking up the letter at the same moment, we found that it was addressed to William Holden, and as the person turned to take it, we saw that it was this very Hel n Merrill. It seemed provi- dential, for now Holden's people will be on their guard." "And so you told Uolden's!people?" "Certainly; I thought it my duty." "Would it not have been more providential had you     kept the letter and given it to them? Theywould then ha1ve known just what thd girl was writing."

"If you mean such men as Stanford, I say yes.

"What do you mean, Mrs. Reid?   Do you :intend that as a reflection on me?" "I mean just what I say. I am astonished at hear- ing a Christian woman repeat the slurs of so vile a , wretch in evidence against one of her own sex, and as for Mrs. Taylor and her daughter, I believe them pure, so far as what they are accused of is concernedl, not- withstanding all that has been said against them.'" "Why, Mrs. Reid!"  "I do, Mrs. Schoolcraft, and am prepared to give my reasons; but first let me give you a little of my own experience as to the maliciousness of xunprincipled men. You know that I am rather independent in my nature, advocate what I think is right, whether others think so or not." "I know that you have suffered and sacrificed much in the cause of the poor slave, and I honor you for it.

Stopping to canvass a little village in the central part of the State, I boarded a few days at the public house, and one nighl; at the table the anti-slavery question was introduced, I, of course, defending the abolitionist. - The landlord also kept a store in a small way, and it so happened that the man whose business it was to furnish the country mer-. chants with ready-made men's wear, from a wholesale clothing establishment in the city, was there that night., He was very warm in his opposition to me, and became somewhat excited when some of his argumentswere too readily answered to suit him. Some three months after.. wards lihe chanced to come to another village where ] was stopping, and learning that I wgs there, he took occasion to have his petty revenge.

' "And were you really strong enough to face such an accusation and defend yourself?" asked the minister's mother, in astonishment. "To be sure I was. Why slould I not defend my- self as well as another? I should stand by another to the last, if I thought them wronged; and for my child's sake, if not for my own, it was my duty to do nimyself justice. Besides, it taught tlat man and that commu- nity a lesson, and should another woman go there, intent upon her own honest business, they will be a little more careful how they listen to or circulate reports against her. So you see that I not only defended my- self, but left my footprints there, - 'Footprints, that, perhaps another, Sailing o'er life's solemn nmain, A forlorn and shipwrecked sister, Seeing, shall take heart again.' "'I know till about that Mrs. Reid I wish to.' These were the words the man used, and the community paays him just the compliment he wishes them to, to wit; that he is a sensual man, and therefore the only inter- pretation that can be put upon such an expression is that the person alluded to is vile. I have no dotubt that many a vile man can say of a virtuous woman that lie knows all about her he wishes to, simply because of her being virtuous, and consequently bf no use to hin." Mrs, Reid, you ought to have been a preacher."   "Perhaps so; and yet it would be contrary to Paul's instructions." "Well, a lawyer, then." "I think the day will come when women will preach and plead law too; but let me give you a little more of my experience. I went to ohe -place where people seemed quite shy of me at first, but after a while I gained their confidence, antLthings worked so pleas- antly that I staid several weeks. One day my land- lady said to me, 'Mrs. Reid, were you acquainted with a family of Johnsons when you came here?' "In this place, do you mean?' I asked. Yes.' "'No, ma'am; I know no one here but Mr. Peircy. I met himl at his brother's, in Monktown, and it was through his influence that I came; but I have met a Johnson somewhere in this place, and I cannot recollect where. O, I know now; it was at Mr. Warner's, the other evening.' "'That is not the one I mean,' she replied; 'he is Mr. Warner's brotlher-in-law, and a very fine man; but there is a family of Johnsons living opposite to where the old tavern was kept. They are very low people, the woman especially; and when you first came here it was reported that you met him on the corner near ' Burke's store, and talked with him half an hour, and the conclusion was that you were old acquaintances; but as I have seen nothing tq find fault with in you, I condluded it must be a mistake.' And now, Mrs. Schoolcraft, what do you suppose that story was started from?" "I am sure I cannot tell.

The directions were given me where to go, but I got a little confused, turned the wrong corner, and stopped at the place the lady named, that is, by Burke's store, and inquired the way of some one who stood there. He stepped just around the cor- ner, and pointed out the place I sought. I did not then know, and perhaps never should have known who he was, had not the landlady's question, and the story she  'told me in reference to it, led me to make some inquiries, and I learned that that man was the Johnson referred to. 1 \might tell you several more incidents, Mrs. Schooleraft, tolillustrate the question in'point, 'to wit, the unreliabilit of these flying reports; but these will be sufficient, and such experiences have taught me a valuable lesson; consequently I never judge till I have heard both sides of the story -particularly where a woman's reputation ;s concerned. What would you  think, madam, of a judge who should listen to the evidence again'st a prisoner, and then remand him for punishment without hearing the defence?" "I should call him a very unjust judge, Mrs,. Reid; but I see what you are aiming at, and I think it hardly fair for you to make me condemn myself. You think I have judged Mrs. Taylor and her daugflter without hear- ing the other side of the question." "Well, have you not?" "Perhaps I have; but I have not intendedl to be   CHARlITY   .      251 unjust, and where was I to go for evidence? A woman as vile as circumstances compel me to believe that she is, would hardly stop at a falsehood when necessary." "Suppose we dissect some of those circumstances, and then see if you will feel compelled to believe as you have done. In the first place, you found her with a sick child, inl a poorly furnished room, and you concluded froml that circumstance that she was very destitute." "Who told you this?  "Sle,told me herself."  "How did she learn what my inferences were?" "From a letter that William Holden wrote Helen." "Did y. i read the letter?" "I did ; and he accuses you of being the first one 'to make trouble between his family and them."  "Me'!" "Yes; he says that you and Miss Crowell camne and poisoned the minds of his parents and sister b. the in- ferences that yom drew from circumstances, and he feelds very bitter towardsi you for it." " "Better feel bitter towards me than to be drawn into a snare to take a step that he would always regret." "Well, as I was saying, you inferred from,what you saw that she was poor, and she tells me that she sold  her house in Rocle,ster for fifteen hundred dollars, besides some money that she got for extra furniture, such as she did not wish to bring with her. She started to go to Cincinnati, but the sickness of Eloise prevented her going on with her friends, but as she hoped to proceed in a few days, she did not wish to bring all of her thngs from the warehouse.

The fact of her leasing a house of a bad man was simply her misfortune, not her fault."  "And do you believe the story she tells?"  "Why not?"  "It may be true, Mrs. ,Reid-I hope it is. I am sorry to believe evil of any one; but people think that she has told this to cover her conduct." "I know it to be true so far as the furniture .is con-  cerned, for I have been to the warehouse, examined the  books, and find names and dates just as she told me;  find that she did leave her things there for a tile, and  'that she took them away just when she told me she did." -"Well, you are a wonderful woman,- I must say. Who but you would have thought of taking such a  course?

"But why did she not tell us this when we called? We would have leen glad to assist her, but she re- pelled us."  Mrs. Taylor is a proud woman, naturally reserved,  and dops not give her confidence readily; and the very  fact of your believing her destitute made your offers of assistance offensive, in that your manner touched her pride."

I know we are all miserable sinners before God, and so much the more need that we should be humble; for my part, I can't see why our offers of assistance should offend the woman." "It ought not to have done so, but it did; some peo- ple are very sensitive on this point, and nothing touches ,them quicker than being considered objects of charity. I presume we all have our weak points. Besides, her child was very sick, and her anxiety - a mother's anxiety - might well be pardoned for forgetting to be as social as at another time." "Yes,' the child was very sicl, poor lamb! I feared she would never be any better; but God has willed it otherwise; but whlen I attempted to talk to her of Jesus and heaven, the mother peremptorily forbade it; and how could I believe her other than a wicked woman?" "She did this because she feared that if the child was excited it would make her worse; and besides, she has been brought up a Universalist, and does not see these things as you do. She had no fears for the child's future, and did not wish her disturbed." "Yes, and that is enough to condemn her; a person who believes in no future punishment, thinks that the sinner goes to heaven as well as the saint-- how can we expect such to be good?  For my part, I think those who teach such doctrines should be indicted as destroyers of the public morals, and kept in confinement."

"Why, you don't believe such teachings right, Mrs. Reid?"

"She does not; neither does she know that I went to the :warehouse and ascertained the facts in reference to that; but I intend next Sabbath to have these letters read in church, as an especial piece of good news, and I haye no doubt that you will all hasten to undo the wrong that has been unwittingly done to this family."

CHAPTER V. THE FINALE. ELOISE had never seemed better since they left Roches- ter. Mrs. Taylor and Helen -were joyful in their antici- pation of soon leaving the place that had been to them the scene of such bitter experiences. The month was up the following Monday, and then they would start for the city of their original destination. 'Twas thus they talked and planned on that very even- ing in which the conversation above related had occurred f at the house of Mrs. Reid. 'Twas thus they talked and planned, but they saw not the storm that was approach- ing. They had lived so quietly, minded their o;n business so thoroughly, that their immediate neighbors scarcely knew of their existence. Good Mr. Whitney had accidentally learned their place of abode, after leav- ing Stanford's cottage, but had said nothing further than what we liave already related of his conversation with  &#xD;<pb n="256-257" xml:id="VAC8168-00000129"/> ,  i 256     IMAY WEED BLOSSOMS. Mrs. Reid, and had' it not been for those women with their tracts, they could have left the city in peace. These charitable souls, however, were so filled with righteous indignation that they could not restrain their tongues from utterance, and so they horrified the good people of the place with the information that they had a vile woman, or ratherl two of them, in their midst.        i   I The story of young Holden was repeated with varia- tions, till every mother looked upon her son as devoted to certain ruin if these creatures remained in the plhce. Husbands and sons laughed at their fears, but this only exasperated them the mo'e.- Groups were seen conversing here and there, anxiously asking what' should be done. They supposed there were such women down in the heart; of the city, but that they should come into the suburbs, and settle down ampng decent people, was altogether too riuch to be borne. Stanford, who had panted for revenge ever since he was so summarily dismissed froti their presence, fient one of his female friends up- into the neighborhood, in order to spy out and report. On returning to him with an account of the excitement people were in, he hired her to go back and represent herself as a great sufferer on account of Mrs. Taylor and her daughter; they hav- a ing decoyed both her husband and son by their snares. And this woman, once virtuous and good, but who had fallen a victim to Stanford's too well-laid plans, and, losing all self-respect, had since become the agent of his will, actually performed the part assigned her so well, that a company of quiet, well-to-do wives and mothers were raised to that pitch of excitement that they a   went to Mrs. Taylor's house and pelted it with stones and rotten eggs. And while "the inmates were trembling with fear, Eloise having fainted from terror, the police descended upon them and took the whole family to the station- house, to answer to the charge of disturbing the peace. It was too late that night to investigate the matter, con- sequently they must remain in custody till morniilg. "This is the work of those Christian women who lhave followed us with' their persecutions ever since we came to the city; and may God reward them accord- ingly," said Mrs. Taylor, in the bitterness of her spiril;. Helen was silent, and the wretched mother continued: Yes, may God reward them accordingly; they are murderers! they have killed my child. Eloise will never recover from this." "O, mother, don't say that," fairly shrieked Helen, while sobs shook her entire frame. "Don't cry, sister," murmured Eloise, faintly; "I shall soon -be better." Every sign of emotion was suppressed almost in- stantly. They could do anything for her dear sake. They had believed her unconscious, and finding that she was not, they grew calm in a moment, while LHelen, stooping and kissing her, replied, with a smile, "Yes, darling, you will soon be better." ' Thank you, sister; now don't cry any more; God and the angels will make it all right. Kiss me, mother; I am tired and want to sleep;" and with her head pil- lowed upon her, mother's breast, she sank away into a Condition of unconciousness, that seemed more like death than sleep. Little Mary lay in one corner of the 17  &#xD;<pb n="258-259" xml:id="VAC8168-00000130"/> 258    A. AYEED BLOSSOMS. room on a temporary bed that had been prepared for her. She had cried bitterly at first because she could not have her own bed; but childhood soon forgets, and now she was sleeping soundly. But there was no sleep for Helen or her mother. All niught long they watched over the pale sufferer, and when morning dawned, the mother knew that it would soon be over. The mother knew this, but Helen could not, would not admit the terrible truth; she could not give up her darling sister. When the hour arrived for the keepers of the peace to look into the cause of the previous night's disturb- ance, not an accuser was there; but Stanford was on hand, and with a hypocritical smile, stepped forward and offered to go security for the ladies, and pa4 all costs if they could be set at liberty. "I have no doubt," said he, with an insulting look towards them, "that they have their friends; b t I have. never found them inclined to make trouble, and I think the excitement of last night was wholly uncalleL for." "Hold, wretch!" exclaimed Mrs. Taylor, wi:h flash- ing eyes; "wretch! hypocrite! You lhave caused this, and you know it; and you think by this means to accomplish what you have failed to do otherwise. I will not accept your offer. I. would rather rot in prison than to fall into your power." "Come, come, now.!" he replied, with the same smooth smile, "it isn't worth while to hold anger; per- haps I have neglected yoti, but I amn willing to make all right, anad I can't bear to see yot here." "Great Heaven, murmured the wretched woman, "will no one protect me from these insults?"   "Here comes one who will protect you, no doubt," said Stanford, with a sneer, as Ben Wilson appeared on the scene. "Yes, I will protect them with my life if necessary," he replied. "Sir," he continuted, turning to the officer in charge, I demand the instant release of this family; there are not two better, purer ladies in the whole city." "Very devoted lover," sneered Stanford. "Silence, or I will wring your worthless neck for you," thundered Wilson; then, turning to the justice, he added, "Ben Wilson is bad enough, God knows;, but he has never been guilty of circulating false report s of a woman, out of revenge, because she resisted him, as that miserable puppy has done in this case." "You must be careful how you conduct yourself, Mr., Wilson, or we shall have to commit you for contemptl; of court," said the justice. "Will you permit me to be, sworn?" was that gentle.. man's prompt'reply. "Certainly." The oath was taken. "Now, sir, I shall recollect; that I am under oath, and must speak nothing but the truth." "Nothirg but the truth," responded the justice. "Well, then, gentlemen, some four months ago I be-.. came acquainted with these ladies. Through the insinu.- ations thrown out by Stanford', and from remarks that were made by a couple of women whose business it was to go through the city and find out what they could of' other people's business,--pardon me, sir, I did not intend to say ,that, - whose business it was to go through the city and find out the religious condition   &#xD;<pb n="260-261" xml:id="VAC8168-00000131"/> thereof, and to. distribute tracts to both saint and sinner; through these two sources I inferred these ladies .to be of a very different character from what I found them to be. I made an excuse to call on them; motives none of the best, it is true; but, your honor, I found such an atmosphere of purity there that I could just as soon have approached an angel right out of heaven with anything like disrespectful familiarity. They never en- couraged my visits; still, I have called occasionally, for I felt a better man in their presence: and particu- larly was I attracted to that sweet child who lies there so still and pale, so much like the angel that she is, that one forgets even the thoughts of sin in her presence." The sound of his voice had aroused Eloise, and when he said this, she fixed her eyes upon him with a bright smile, and said, "I shall be with the angels sdon." Tears rushed to the strong man's eyes, as she said this, and bowing hastily, with "I am done, sir," he left the stand. Two other parties now appeared upon the scene in the persons of Mrs. Reid'and Mr. Whitney. After press- ing the hand of Helen and her mother, and kissing the lips of Eloise and little Mary, Mrs. Reid requested permission to say a few words. She then gave a short history of her acquaintance with the family, and of the circumstances which had prejudiced people against them; stating further what she had done to remove these sus- picions and the result. When she spbke of going to the warehouse books to confirm that part of Mrs. Tay- lor's story, the stony look of despair which had settled upon the poor woman's face began to give way, and when Mrs. Reid referred to the letters she had received   from Rochester, and at the same time producing them, both mother and daughter wept such tears as are a relief to the overcharged heart. Wilson listened with a countenance expressive of-so much joy that one, expected momentarily to hear him burst out with "Hail Columbia," or "Hallelujah; but Stanford slunk away like a whipped cur. A carriage was provided, and the wronged family were taken back to their home; but it was evident that its most loved member would soon be beyond the reach of earthly troubles. Indeed, she seemed beyond them already, so calm and happy was her frame of mind. Her perfect trust in the Infinite was beautiful to be- hold. "God and the angels will make it all right," was her only reply to all' that had occurred. "They were with nie last night, mother, the beautiful angels, and they made the prison a palace." Towards evening she asked to see the minister, and he quickly responded, his mother coming with him. Mrs. Schoolcraft had thought much since her conversa- tion with Mrs. Reid on the previous evening, and as much as she desired to justify herself in the part she had acted towards Mrs. Taylor, when she compared her course with that taken by Mrs. Reid, she could not fail to see the difference. But what she felt most keenly was the fact that she was the minister's mother, and, as such, should have been first in defending the innocent, instead of being found amonng the maligners. What would people say when they learned the facts in the case? She found herself in an awkward position, and was glad to lay hold of anything that would help her   &#xD;<pb n="262-263" xml:id="VAC8168-00000132"/> CHARIT'Y.        263 taking it, but the eyes of her child were upon her, and she could not refuse. A satisfied smile played over the features of the dy- ing: The whole company were in tears. "O, Miss Eloise," sobbed Wilson, "when you get to heaven, tell my sister Mary that her brother Ben will try to meet her in peace." Eloise cast her blue orbs, radiant with the light of that heaven he was spctking of, full upon him. "O, yes, you must come; we could not do without you." Then, turning to her minister, she said: "I wanted to thank you for all the beautiful things you have taught me, but the angels are coming and I must go. Mother, sisters, friends, they have come for me. I shall wait for you all. Good by." And without a struggle the beautiful eyes were closed forever. The funeral was held in the little church where Eloise was in the habit of attending. Mrs. Taylor at first objected; but Mr. Schooleraft said, "We ask it as a favor, madam.  You and yours have been cruelly wronged, and do not deny us the privilege of making all the reparation in our power, by thus publicly testi- fying our respect," and so she consented that it should be as they desired. The tide that had so long set against this unfortunate family had .now turned, and it rose as high in the oppo- site direction., The church was filled to the overflow- ing, and again the minister spoke from the words, "And now abideth faith, hope, and charity, but the greatest of these three is charity; " and this time the seed fell not among thorns, for the fallow' ground had been conm- pletely broken up. There was not a dry eye in the   &#xD;<pb n="264-265" xml:id="VAC8168-00000133"/> house, and Mr. Schoolcraft, in parting with Mrs. Taylor, said,- "Madam:, what you have suffered here -the wrongs that you have been called upon to bear- has made a deeper impression upon the minds of this people, will be productive of more lasting good, than all of my preaching for a year past." The body of Eloisewas not laid in the Cleveland cemetery, but in an air-tight coffin, and. packed in ice, and on the following morning, instead of starting for Cincinnati, as she had hoped, the bereaved mother went with the beloved dead and her remaining loved ones on board a steamer on her way back to Rochester, where \ the dear remains were deposited beside those already resting there: and now we will bid them farewell.     &#xD;</p>
