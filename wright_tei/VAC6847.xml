THE PLACE VANDEAU AND ITS PROPRIETOR.   ---  Of wealth he lacks not, But he dwells alone, like to a miser- Or a hermit-and his guests. or friends, % Are few, and of a doubtful mien."   EAR the corner of the basement story of a mag- nificent private hotel in Paris, in a very insignifi- cant apartment, there sat, one eve- ning, many years ago, a strong and E healthy old man, I whom none could B have supposed, from his appear- ance, was subject   to any bodily disease; and whose round face and compactly built frame indicated present health, and a long life in prospect.,  He was "easy " in his circumstances-if the possession of a princely fortune could make a man easy-and he seemed to enjoy his own mode of living, hongh it was sufficently peculiar   and eccentric. The apartment he now occupied was, as we have stated, in the basement of an elegant dwelling-but it was very plainly fur- nished, and he lived there, altogether-and alone! The hotel above him was his own-and a splendid establishment it was, too; from en- trance to attic, it was lavishy furnished and appointed; but it was always closed; he enter- tained no company, gave no parties, indulged in no extravagances, -lived on in quiet, in his sin- gle room, and asked nor answered only the ne- cessary questions which his slight apparent in- tercourse with the world demanded he should. Notwithstandiig all this, the proprietor of the Place Vandean, as his elegant house was called, was a millionaire. His fortune was immense! But ho continued to draw his interest ffom his stocks, collect his rents, and hoard up his accum- ulated and still accumulating riches, without parting with a tithe of his generous income. Twice a week, the beautiful dining-room of the Place Vandeau was opened-and twice a week, to wit, on Wednesdays and Sundays-a modest but richly appointed vehicle halted be-    <pb n="8-9" xml:id="VAC6847-00000003"/> fore the high portal of the otherwise deserted hotel. From this carriage a female alighted- the same person, on each and every occasion- though she came differently attired. She was a graceful woman, about five-and-thirty years old, but no one knew whence she came, or what was her business with the rich proprietor of the house. Dinner was served for the lady and the old gentleman already described, on these occasions, and the rarest viands and luxuries of the season always found their way to the table of the ec- centric, from a neighboring fashionable cafe. The servants who attended this couple were lit- erally "dumb waiters." They were well paid, they understood their duties, they asked no questions, and ascertained nothing-except that the lady came, dined, chatted with her friend, and departed in her carriage, at her pleasure. Every day, Monsieur Bouvais left his little private apartment (on the ground floor) at eleven o'clock, and at five he returned again. He was often seen at the Bourse-the great exchange of Paris-and his name was well known and highly accredited at the broker's board. On the first and fifteenth of each month, another guest waited upon him, as regularly as'those days came round. To this personage we will devote a separate paragraph. He was a fair-haired youth of only fourtecn- years, and his face was as frank and open as his heart. He was handsome, active, high-spirited, and generous in his disposition, to the last de- gree. He came to visit Monsieur Bouvais, be- cause the old gentleman so directed; and Elmir Fonblanc was his nephew-then at school near by Paris; whence he had permission to visit his uncle twice in each month. He dined and sup- ped with monsieur on these occasions, privately and quietly, in the little low room, in the base- ment of the hotel. When the boy got ready to depart, after these friendly calls, monsieur would present his hand to him, in excellent good nature, and say: "Garcon-I am rich. I have no family ties btfjyou. You shall be my heir." Then he would slip a golden louis into the youth's palm, and bid him good night. A golden louis was not much money, but the boy valued it as a great sum; and he found it very accepta- ble, twice in every month. The boy pursued his studies attentively, and saved his semi monthly pittance; for his need of money, beyond the ample provision made for   his comfort and education, was not very great. He went and came, as was his custom, his uncle always greeted him in the kindest possible man- ner, and time passed by very pleasantly with him, for three years. In the meantime, the well- dressed lady came to the Place Vandeau and departed after dinner, twice a week. Elmir got to be over seventeen, and proved a very good scholar. His father had died when he was very young, and he eould scarcely re- member the countenance of his mother, who was taken away from him at an early age, too. She was the sister of monsieur, and when the boy became an orphan, the old uncle adopted him, and took a fatherly interest in him. "You shall certainly be my heir," he repeated, often; and Elmir believed it, but cared very little about it. The boy came from school again on the first day of the month, as usual; and on reaching the little room at the corner of the great hotel, where he had always found his good old uncle in wait- ing to receive him-he was surprised to find the -. door fast; and, in response to his touch of the bell-pull, a servant appeared at the threshold. "Whom would you see?" asked the attendat,  solemnly. "My uncle, Monsieur Bouvais." "He is not here." "No? I always find him here." "He is above stairs.-to the right." Elmir slowly ascended the broad marble steps which led to the main entrance of the hotel, and as he halted a moment at the top of the flight, a graceful woman opened the doors and said: "Are you not monsieur's nephew?" "Yes, madame, I am Elmir Fonblanc." "It is well," was the reply. "Come in." The boy entered, slowly, and the lady instantly conducted him into one of the grand parlors. "You seek monsieur-do you not?" "You are correct, madame," said Elmir. "There he is!" said the woman, pointing to a bier at the end of the apartment. Monsieur Bouvais had been dead two days, and his body was now prepared for burial! "What does this mean i" exclaimed the youth, alarmed and agitated at this very unexpected sight. "We know nothing more than yourself," re- plied the laly, with stoical calmness. "Except that what wjdo know we learned a few hours earlier than you did." "Was he ill long?" "No.   "It is very distressing." "Is it?" "So it seems to me, madame," responded El- mir, who could not comprehend the disaster at all, and to whose youthful mind the sceni he was witnessing was very frightful. "It is so sudden-so singular," he added. "Yes-it is somewhat strange," continued the woman; "but accidents, sudden and startling, are of frequent occurrence in Paris." "True. But have you no explanation-no apparent cause for his death?" "None, whatever.  Yesterday morning, he was found dead in his room, by the servant from the cafe, who came with his breakfast. His body was removed to this apartment, the local authori- ties have been notifiedof the circumstance, and they have not thought it necessary to summon a jury of inquest. He might have died from apoplexy. Monsieur was old, and has been a bon-vivant, as you are aware. The boy was astounded at this brief narrative; but he was far more astonished at the apparent ,coolness of the narrator. He stooped over the prostrate form of his late protector, and as he lay there, seemingly asleep, only-so perfect were his features, and so unchanged was his appearance-a tear fell from the youth's eyelids upon the marble-cold cheek of his late friend and benefactor! But Elmir was only seventeen years old. His affection for monsieur was not very deeply rooted, it was true nevertheless, he   ' felt that now he was comparatively alone in the world. He was not penniless, however. He re- called his uncle's assurance-"I will make you my heir!" and he turned to the lady again, who had been watching him attentively. "Does my uncle leave any letters behind hin'?" he asked. None, that I am aware of." "No will, madame?" "Yes. Here it is," said the lady. "It is duly registered. Read it, if you will." This document purported to be the last will and testament of Monsieur Bouvais, prepared in presence of a well-known Parisian notary, only three weeks before monsieur's decease-and in which he gave and bequeathed to Marie Denoir his whole fortune, with a single reservation, which read as follows: "To my nephew, Elmir Fonblanc, I lean my old Bible, a relic in the family, received from his mother, at her decease, in 173-, and my best good wishes for his success and prosperity in life." Elmir was disappointed, but he had a strong heart; and so he said: "My uncle was rich, was he not?" "He is thought to be." "And who is this Marie Denoir?" "I answer for her," said the strange lady, promptly. Such was the fact; .and this was the personage who had visited monsieur so regularly on Sun- day and Wednesday, at the Place Vandeau!    <pb n="10-11" xml:id="VAC6847-00000004"/> CHAFFER II, nLMR'S CONFERENCE AFTER HS UNCLE'S DOECASe.   Tim acquaintance of monsieur ith Mario Denoir had been of no recent date; we have introduced the parties at a period when their  intimacy had been of long standing-for the  proprietor of the Place Vandean had known this lady several years. But Elmir had never chanced to meet the woman before he saw her beside the death-bief of his friend and patron. When he had finished reading the will, the boy heard from her own lips that the legatee of his uncle's immense fortune was this very lady who now conferred with him! He was perplexed at this; and the more so because she evinced no sort of grief at monsieur's death! On the con- trary, be began to surmise that she was rather rejoiced that the old gentleman had departed- that she might enjoy the great legacy bequeathed to her, without hindrance or impediment! Poor Elmir-he was a child in years, and knew little of the ways of the world. I The old family Bible was left to him, how- ever, and he wopld take it-back to school with him; and, haply, he would find some records that, at least, would entertain or enlighten him further in regard to her early years, than he had otherwise had the means of becoming informed about. "1 You are at school, near the capital, yet '" asked the lady, of Elmir, at last, "are you not "' "Yes, madame." "Who is accountable for your education, and expenses!"   "My uncle has been, I suppose." It is well, then. Rctrn to your studies, and I will continue to provide the means to defray your current charges, for the present." "You are very kind, madame." "Undoubtedly monsieur would have desired this, had his death been otherwise than very sud- den. I will assume the responsibility, therefore. Apply yourself, earnestly, and you will be taken care of in the future." "Many thanks,-madame. Eat my poor uncle -when will he be buried i" "At once; to-night." ; I will remain, then, and- "No. That is not necessay. I will bear wit- ness to your good intontion--but monsicur always desired that when his death occurred, no unnecessary display should take plaqe in a funeral service. He will be interrd, at evening, quietly-in the family vault; and you may re- turn at once to your studies." Elmir was a boy; and though he could not comprehend this strangely peremptory manage- ment, still he submitted; for he felt that he was now without friends-alone, almost, in an un- charitable world-and it were well not to offend the only person who seemed inclined to aid him. The present was with him an unexpected and threatening emergency; and so, he took his old Bible, kissed the strange lady's fair hand, and 1' departed!   As soon as the door closed upon Elmir, the h lady advanced to the bier, drew up the shroud d carefully over the face of the deceased, and left h the apartment.               a Upon reaching the splendid room which had M been her own private boudoir, durirg monsieur's a life-time, she sat down, read the will over again,m  and said to herself:            d "All is right, now-and just as I would have d it. The document is authentic, the notary is a  cunning rogue, and his scheme is admirable! a Three millions of francs is a comfortable' sum, a truly! So long as he is discreet, I am content. Monsieur sleeps with his fathers. Dead men can- v not tell tales! I may now enjoy life without t stint-and I will do so. Isacrified position-he f had wealth, indeed!:' " The remains of the eccentric gentleman were f deposited the same evening in the family vault, I as had been previously proposed. It is no un- s common occurrence for people to die in Paris f (as elsewhere). and especially when they reach an advanced age; they often died, suddenly- f everybody acqviesced-and the fact of monsieur's  sudden demise was forgotten as quickly as was t any similar event of the period. But people n asked questions-impertinent queries they were considered, in certain quarters!-rcegrding the I large property he had left behind him. Who was the fortunate legatee? asked every  one as soon as the body had disappeared. And, when the name of Marie Denoir was given as the sole successor of monsieur's fortune-ample and generous as it was-the same parties thought it strange! In the meantime Elmir reached his school again, and had re-commenced his studies. Ho applied himself with closer assiduity than ever. He reflected as he studied, and commenced to store his mind with knowledge that would be useful to him, in case he were doserted by his newly found friend. Boy though he was, he realized that he had no shadow of claim upon the lady who had of- fered to assist him. How long her friendship might last, too, was a questionable matter; he resolved, therefore, to mako the mort of his op- portunity, and improve the chance now within his grasp to inform his mind. We will leave Elmir at his studies, and turn to other charac- ters of import and consequence, whose history and positions must be defined for the explana- tion of our present story. Andrcas Martini was an Italian by birth, and   his residence in France had been for less than a dozen years. He was now past forty, though as hearty and as active, to all outward appearance, as at twenty-five. He was of spare form, but wiry and stoat in limb and muscle-and, with all who had ever had occasion to do business with him, he had proved himself shrewd and diplomatic to the very last degree; though he did not pretend to pride himself upon eitherhis wit or his skill in business affairs. Martini was a notary-and his rooms were well appointed, and located in the Rue Franklfort. Three days after the burial of Monsieur Bou- vais, the notary sat in his inner room-the Gsnc- tum of his business apartments-alone and be- fore him, upon his desk, lay a small envelope, which had been scaled with an exquisitely taste- ful design, and from which he had just taken a letter (written in a beautiful female hand) that seemed to intcrest him deeply. He road it care- fully, and then murmured to himself: - It is well! Madame does not know a/, I fancy. The will was made in form, it has been authenticated duly, and was seasonably regis- tered. It leaves her all his prope-ty-three millions of francs-without a single proviso! That is very well-very well! Madame is a fortunate woman, and she is happy! Well she may be. She thanks me for my care-ne, who prepared the document. And she trusts that we may continue to be friends-for she may havm further commands for me, professionally. That is well. But, if madame could see this paper, she would not feel so contented and eay, haply!" and the notary drew forth, a sealed document of a more recent date, which had a very important bearing upon the case in hand. This instrument was a codicil to the will of the late Monsieur Bouvais, signed, sealed and delivered in pre s ence of two competent wi'nnessc, a wek before the ecccntric's death! The notary chuckled at his cunning and his power, at that moment. "Madame is a brilliant woman," he said, to himself, " and I would pos- sess bu t her and the fortune of my late ' friend!' It can be done-weightier things than this I have accom-plihed. And I promise myself the hap- piness and the good fortune to msago both. If sheccfase, I have the codicil; if she accepts, I  am provided for, for life. It is worth the ven- ture-I &amp;m resolved." Thus he argued. The codicil was good against the original will, as it dated some weeks after the I first; if he succeeded in his scheme, this docu- &amp;    <pb n="12-13" xml:id="VAC6847-00000005"/> ment would never see the light; if the lady was not to be managed, he would make the most of the secret, in another way. And having thus determined, he secured the precious instrument in his strong box, and resolved to call upon Madame Denoir, in person to congratulate her, and to acknowledge the receipt of her note. The lady had examined all the deeds, and the books of monsieur showed a very handsome balance of ready money, on deposit, also, at his death. She was satisfied, and forthwith she commenced to arrange for the future enjoyment of the princely means so suddenly left to her unconditional disposal. There was no apparent drawhack to her anticipated pleasure, and she did not hesitate. The interior of the Place Vandeau was forth- with renovated, newly furnished, and splendidly appointed throughout. The superb mansion of the late Monsieur Bouvais was transformed from the quiet, unimproved residence of the wealthy bachelor, into a fashionable, well kept, magnifi- cent retreat, for a coterie of friends whom the lady Denoir drew about her, by means of her newly acquired wealth and her brilliant accom- plishments. Before six months had elapsed, after she came into possession of monsieur's es- tate, the former isolated mansion had become notorious for the magnificent hospitality and lavish generosity of its fair mistress-Madame Denoir-and the choice dinners, brilliant balls, and pleasant soirees given by the lady, were the conversation of the town. Monsieur's hard- e..ned money had come to a very good market! At the end of the first twelvemonth after mon- sienr's death, the lady had contrived to get rid of sixty thousand francs. This was a good deal of money, in Paris-but Madame Denoir con- sidered that she had been very economical. "Sixty thousand francs, in six months!" she would say-"Pooh! You shall see,- anon! Re- spect to the memory of monsieur prevents me from indulging in anything like extravagance, as yet. Another year, I intend to enjoy my fortune." The notary heard this remark, and he said to   himself, "it will not do. This sort of thing will never answer, for me. She knows nothing of the value of money, and 'easy come, easy go,' is her motto. We must stop this, or there will be nothing left worth contending for, shortly!" He was a constant guest at madame's parties, and twice he had found it convenient to hint, in set terms, that he loved her better than he ever loved any one else; which, by the way, was a fair con ression, but a very safe one. The notary never loved anybody! Madame laughed at her suitor, on, the first occasion-and when he repeated his declaration, she pouted. This was far from being a pleasant result-in Martini's esteem-for he was not a bad looking man, and he was not very much her senior in years. He had hoped for a different reply, and was disappointed. Madame Denoir continued to give herfetes, however, and Martini awiaways a guest. He kept a watchful eye upoh her course, and at the end of a twelvemonth from the death of Mon- sieur Bouvais, an importaut event occurred, which changed his present plans, materially. The boy Elmir had applied himself closely, and at the expiration of the term mentioned, he very unexpectedly received a summons from Madame Denoir to wait upon her, at Paris! He did not hesitate to respond to his invitation, and madame received him in a friendly manner. Elmir was now eighteen years old-tall, well formed, and of vry becoming address. The im- pression he seemed to make was most favorable; and madame informed him that she had designed a grand levee, for a certain evening, at which she desired him to be present. When the notary learned (as '! o did soon after his arrival from schooD that the young nephew of Bouvais had returned, he called at the man- sion and paid his respects to him, as the friend of his late uncle and patron. He was critical in his observation of the youth's manners and ap- parent character-and seemed very well satisfied with Elmir's appearance. Had the notary any designs in connection with this boy We shall see, anon.   CHAPTER H. TIES XfT'FRTAIMMET AT AT MADAME DZIT)S3'S MANSION.   aWnS- the evening arrived for the grand en- fo tertainment given by Madame Denoir, a crowd a of Paris fashionables congregated at the Place t Vandean, the late mansion of Bouvais-for the  lady's acquaintance was extensive, and Che gave  magnificent sappers! Elmir had been but lit- tle in society, as yet, and his address needed the  polish " of city experience to render him easy in the drawing-room. He was among the guests, however-and so was Martini, the notary. Scarcely had Elmir entered the great saloon of Madame Denoir's elegant house, when his attention was attracted by the figure of a young girl near him, in a manner totally unaccountable to him! He had met with young ladies before, often-he had seen and admired them, as young gentlemen of his age and attainments ordina- rily do; but he had never seen, never dieamed of anything so lovely and innocent as this being appeared to his vison. le gazed upon her, and watched her movements for an hour-and de- clared to himself that she was the loveliest girl he had ever encountered! Bow there was nothing very remazkable in this conclusion of Elmir's, for two good reasons. In the first place, the young lady was very -beauti- ful; secondly, the youth's experience was lim ited, and his nature was very impulsive. But ha continued to gaze upon the charmus of the   fair crature who had thus suldenly ares3ted his attention, until he was startled from his reverie, by a gentle hand which was placed within his armI. iHe turned, and encountered the form of Mada-me D-nsnir at his side. "You are in crested, I see," she said, in a pleasrant tone. c"Ma dame," responded Elmir, gracefully, "I beg your pardon for my inadvertence in not find- ing you an hour ago. I came hither in search of you, directly upon my announcement; but-" "You chanmced upon metal more attractive, I perceive." "Lady, your pardon, again; may I ask who is the young 'dcmoisoll beyond is "  "Yes. You think her pretty V" "Charming, lady! A very sylph-" "Come, then; sit down here, and I will tell you all about her." Madame Denoir approached a recess, which was overhung with a rich heavy curtain, and drew her young friend gently on until they reached the divan which was shadowed by the sfalling damask. Here she pointed him to a aseat, where they would be comparatively unob- - served-and thus continued: "I am glad you ae pleased with the young t lady, Elair-for she has seen you before to-night, e and desires to make your acquaintance."    <pb n="14-15" xml:id="VAC6847-00000006"/> 4"Is it poesible!" exciamed. thc youth, y s to- ished--" when a d whreo hav-o v c met?'

Elim- war saz-pr.'cd at this unexpected visit   from monsieur; but, when ho informed him thai' he called upon business of interest to himself, particularly, and also that he came from Madame Denoir, in his bohalf--tho youth became, at 'once, a most attentive listener. He had not for- gotten that madamo had enjoined it upon him to observe the counsel of monsieur; and he heard his proposals with deep concern. "You have now attained that period in life," said the notary, cunningly, " when it becomes necessary that you should do something for yourself. I think you are past eighteen, are you not?" "You arc right, monsieur." (So I havo been informed. i At your ago, Elmir, I Lhd craned, and laid by, a thousand francs. I have conferred with llMadamo Denoir, and sho has deputed me to wait upon you, and in as delicate a manner as possible to inform you that she is no longer able to assist you."  "Is not madame rich, monsieur!" "Not so rich as she has been supposed to bo, by a great deal." "M(y ruclc's whole estate fell to her; did it not!" "And whabt of that ', Your uncle was thought to be wealthy. For a bachelor, so he was. But you know I have long been conversant with his affairs, and when the estate is, finally settled, 1 assure you there will not be much to boast of Besides, madame has lived too fast; and she now finds herself embarrassed, pecuniarily. You surely, can feel no disposition to aid in continu ing this embarrassment ."   "No, monsieur!  You are correct. I wil! wait upon madame, forthwith, and relieve her, in that respect," responded the boy, at once. "No, Elmir-that is unnecessary. Madame is exceedingly sensitive, and an interview of this sort would pain her. She has therefore entrusted her proposal with me, to be offered to you, in order to avoid the scene which must of necessity follow a personal explanation on her part."' ( "Madame Denoir has been very kind to me, monsieur-" "( So she has; and I doubt not you appreciate her good will towards you." "Indeed, monsieur, you are correct." "She has aided to give you a good education ; you aro now qualified to commence the world upon your own account, far better than are the average of young men, and she bids me to sug- gest a course for your future, which I trust will please you." "I submit, monsieur, to her pleasure, what- ever it may be;" said Elmir, frankly, and evi- dently grateful for the past favor he had enjoyed. This was the first part of Martini's plan. The whole story he had thus far rehearsed was a pure fabrication of his owl Ho had laid his plan cautiously, and he oi ly desired to get his youth- ful victim into a proper frame of mind to receive his advice-and his present object would be ac- * complished. r  Having obtained the assent of Elmir to the lady's supposed proposal, in advance, he con- - trivcd to -mould his mind to his plan.    <pb n="16-17" xml:id="VAC6847-00000007"/> CHAPTER IV. THE NOTARY'8 DE31GNS UPON ELMR.   THE young man who now sat an attentive listener to tk e proposition about to be made to him by the notary, had no idea that the latter was a knave. He believed what he had said, and he looked upon the offer as only a continu- ance of madame's favor; which he felt bound to accept and respect, from one who had thus far done so much for him in his present peculiar emergency. "You have already learned, young man," said Martini, "that madame confides in me. I have been her confidential adviser for a long term of years, and she knows me." "Yes, \nonsieur, Madame Denoir has spoken to me of yourself, in very flattering terms." "Ah! I had not expected that," said the no- tary, shrewdly. "So much the better. You will not distrust me, then." "No, monsieur. With the exception of ma- dame, I have no friend of influence to whom I can appeal for assistance; and I shall respect her advice, accordingly." "You are wise in your decision; and, in ad- vance, I must commend your sagacity," added Martini, in a flattering tone. "So, we will proceed at once to business. Madame Denoir finds herself extremely cramped for ready means, as I have already informed you; and she is thus compelled to. curtail all outside expenditures.   She does not feel disposed to incur the further responsibility of keeping you at school, here- and commissioned me, some weeks since, to look about for some opportunity whereby you might, if you chose to do so, be enabled to begin the world advantageously to yourself, and thus relieve her." "Madame is very considerate, and I am grate- ful for her efforts, and yours, monsieur." "It is well. Have you ever thought of any profession, for the future?" "No, monsieur-not as yet." "Would you not like to travel?" "In what way, monsieur?" "I thought you might feel disposed to see the world-to visit foreign countries; in short, I chanced upon an old friend of my own, and also of your lamented uncle, a little time since, who is master of a fine brig, and who has been in the Spanish trade for many years. He began life a mere cabin boy, without means or friends, and with little education; he had a stout heart, though, and, by his own exertions, he worked his way up to a captaincy in the merchant ser- vice, in seven years." "In seven years!" said Elmir. "Yes. That is not long, for the accomplish- ment of such a business, and for the establishing of such a position, surely."   "On the contrary, monsieur, I deem snch sue-' b cess remarkable."  "It is not a strange result, in the French merchant service, Elmir, under good auspices. h The captain I speak of, is now well off, too. He has continued to prosper, and has long been ii beyond the reach of peverty. By continued ap- plication he has become a man of moderate wealth. If you will, you may do better than he has done." "I embrace your offer, most gratefully, mon- sieur," continued Elmir, in an enthusiastic tone.  "I shall be happy to avail myself of such an op- portunity, and consider myself fortunate, pccu- ( liarly, under the circumstances."     d "The captain is now about ready to sail for Lisbon."                  b "Can I not join him, at once "  "Are you disposed to commence at the bot- tom of the ladder, Elmir "  "Yes, monsieur-and at once."  ' If you do not join him, directly," continued Martini, deceitfully, "this opportunity will have passed away; and I consider it a good one. I was not aware that ho was ready for sea, until yesterday; and he but awaits a commlunication from me, to proceed upon his voyage. I was desirous to get this opportunity, and to secure it, for you (if the proposal pleased you), and it is an agreeable one to madame, I find-with whom I have already conferred upon the subject." "Do not suffer it to escape, monsieur, I pray you," continued Elmir, anxiously. "'I can get in readiness, forthwith; and I am sure I shall be delighted with it." "I will write to the captain, then, at once. In the meantime, you can prepare to leave Paris, immediately, Elmir; for no time must be lest." "I will wait upon madame, then," said ERlmir, hastily,' "and thank her for her kindness-" "No-I think you had better not do this. Her temperamhent is nervous, and she is too sensitive to speak of a matter which must call up a remembrance of your late uncle, whom she esteemed so highly; and whose affairs were found in such a state as has finally compelled her to this course, in regard to yourself. No- Elmir, you had better not call upon madame, I think. I will represent you, to her, and will say more than you could say." Elmir thought a moment of Flora-the sweet, innocent, captivating beauty of Toulon--and he said, thoughtfully: "There is mademoiselle, too-Flora. I should   be glad to pay my parting respects to her, mon- sieur." A thought suddenly struck hoe notary, and he replied: "Yes, I remember. A very pretty miss, she is.- But she is gone." "Gone? Whither?" "She has left Paris, for Toulon." "So soon!" "Yesterday I learned that she was just ready -to leave, when I called upon madame, in refer- ence to this matter." "It is well, then, monsieur. I shall be gov- erned by your suggestions and convenience; and will prepare at once for my departure." "Very well. I will wait on you, again, three hours hence," said Martini. And he left the youth, forthwith. Now, it is scarcely necessary to assert that the whole of this undertaking was but the seheme of the notary, alone, to further his own personal interest! Not one word of communication had he ever had upon' this subject with Madame Denoir-not a shade of supicion existed in her mind that any such plot had been begun-not a thought had she indulged that Elmir was not still a dependent upon her-not a single wish had ever entered her brain in accordance with this cunningly devised plan of Martini, to put the young man out of his path, for the present! Nevertheless, his arrangements were com plete, and well contrived, throughout. He had found a man, the master of a small brig, then ready to sail, from Havre, and he had made him his tool to carry out the proposition just made to Elmir Fonblanc. The boy stood in his way. The codicil to Monsieur Bouvais's will gave a large property to other parties than Madame Denoir. This document was in the possession of the notary, and he would use it, or not; as his own profit demanded-and in his own chosen time. The lady was entirely ignorant of the cxistepce of this instrument, and she felt independent of the favor or the frowns of the notary-v-ho had the power to crush her, notwithstanding, if she eventually discarded him and resisted his ap-  proaches. Thus stood the case, when Elmir met Martini so unexpectedly, and when the wily knave pro- posed to him, as we have seen. Flora had not left Paris, at all! She came up for a long visit, e at the summons of Madame Denoir, herself, who had taken this means of introducing her to El- a mir's especial notice, in the hope that a union    <pb n="18-19" xml:id="VAC6847-00000008"/> might take place between the young lady and I  the nephew of her late friend-at the proper 1 time. But she was destined to disappointment  and deep chagrin, as we shall soon see. Madame Denoir and Flora sat together on the evening of the day of the interview just described, and both were locking for lilmir, whom they  expected to call at the mansion. But the hours I passed away, and the youth did not make his  appearance. "I am surprised at this," said madame, "for he has been very attentive, when he has been in Paris, before." ' I should have been gratified to meet him," responded F lora, quietly. But Elmir did not come. On the following day, Madame Denoir had ordered her carriage, and Flora had already prepared to join her for a morning ride. The vehicle was before the door, and just before leav- ing, madame said to an attendant: "If Monsieur Fonblanc shall present himself, invite him to tarry until our return. I am de-  sirous of seeing him, and shall be absent but an hour." The elegant vehicle rolled slowly away, and a few moments afterwards, as it approached the Boulevards, the crowd of carriages beyond oc- casioned a temporary halt. A cabriolet came hurrying down from the opposite direction, in which were seated two individuals. The ladies instantly recognized the nearest person, and a hasty exchange of compliments pasocd, as the cab darted by them. It was Ellmir Fonblanc who raised his hat respectfully as he passed; and Flora smiled, and bowed-sweetly, pleas- antly, kindly-as ho left her, bound on a long and doubtful journey. - By his side, sat the no- tary. Bit he had contrived to muffle himself to the ears in his cloak, and the ladies did not sus- pect him. He continued on, and madame and her guest returned soon afterwards to the Place Vandeau. At evening, Martini waited upon madame, for a friendly call. He was calm, and subtle, and agreeable, as was his custom-but no shadow of suspicion, could have attached to him, touch- ing the departure of Elmir from Paris. The boy had gone, however; and he now called upon the ladies to inform them (in his own way) of this anticipated circumstance. "We were just saying, monsieur," remarked madame, as the notary entered the reception- room, " that it was our young friend Elmir ap-   preaching. I marvel that iie dosa not show himself. For three days, we have neither seen nor heard from him. Is it not sIngular, mon- sieur?" "No, madame-I think not." ' You forget," remarked Flora. "We met him, this morning, near the Boulevards." "Yes, yes. In a cab, hurrying away over the pavement." "Then my inforoiation is correct." "Information'?" "Yes, madame. I learned, an hour since, that he had absconded." "What, monsieur!" exclaimed Madame De' noai, excitedly. "Perhaps I should have used a milder term, madame-but the boy has run away, unques tionably." "Whither-and for what purpose?" I cannot answer that, lady.- I only know that for several months, whenever we have met, I have observed that a desire seemed to be grow- ing within the young man to go abroad. He has appeared .to be inclined to a roving life, and much of his leisure, when in Paris, has been passed upon the quays. ie talked of ships and boats and the joyous waves, almost constantly, when we were together; and declared to me, long since, that if he could, he would become a sailor." "Is it possible?" exclaimed madamne, to whom this penchant on Elmir's part, was, until this moment, utterly unknown. "It is just as I tell you, maidame. And, since he has been here, now, he has been in frequent communication with a Havro shipmaster, who I noted latterly conceived a great fancy for the boy. His vessel is now, or rather has been, ready for sea, for several day-. Ho has induced Elmir to join him, and I have no doubt that the boy is now far away, from Paris." 'But, monsieur!" exclaimed madame, start- ing to her feet, " this will never do. Hc may be recovered-he may be detaincd-returned-I am his guardian; I would not, for worlds, that he should be taken away, and thus perillel Quick, monsieur! I pray yeo, haste!" "Whither, madame?" '"Despatch a courier to Havre, instanter. If the vessel has not sailed, he may be induced to forego this propensity. I charge you, haste- and bring him back." "Do, monsieur;" added Flora, deeply inter- ested in the matter.   I will obey your injtructions, madame, to the letter," said Martini, in an apparently de- voted tone. "No efforts shall bo spared to dlnd him, I assure you. I did not irma-in, for one moment, that you felt so deep an interest in the young man's movements n I will ts1 :o it, at once!" "Do so, I pray you, --.nonji-ar. Let no ex- pense interrupt or hinder you. Seek him out- detain him-counsel him to return-arrest him, if necessary! But, do not suffer him to leave the country. Haste!" The notary departed, as if with carnet intent to execute the lady's commands. Hle hurried oat of sight, chuckled as he hastened along, and   ivte i   ii3-utes aftoCzard, he &amp;at downm in his own private apartment, to smile at the progress of  his plans! "Ah, my lady!" he said, mentally, " if you knew what Martini knows, this night, you would lower that imperative tone--you would not pur- cue the fugitive, I think!' Elmir reached Havre in safety-- he brig had been under sailing orders for twenty-four hours -and, through the notary's mo agcment, every- thing worked admirably. The boy found that he had nothing to do but to go on board. His wardrobe had been got ready in advance-the captain greeted him kindly--and the vessol put out to sea, at once!    <pb n="20-21" xml:id="VAC6847-00000009"/> CHAPTER V. TIE RESULT OF BAtRTINIS SEALRCH   Go with ine, dear reader, to Toulon-one of the lIve]iest towns in all France-with its clealy stieets, it numerous fountains, its many hand some residences, and its happypeopl'. It in ot a very long journey from Paris-but six months had prased away, since Elmir fled fror the nr- tropoliei; no tidings. had been obtained of blij, except by such inuendos as Martini chcso to drop, and Madame Dcnoir had left town for .: visit in the more quiet precincts of Toulon. When young lonlblanc parsed madame's c ar riage, near the Boulevards, ho turned to thc no} tary bee him, and said: ' I understood you that NMa'amoirellc I'lora  had left the city, monsieur." "She was- to have left, on yesterday." We have just passed her, in madame's car- riage," said Elmir quietly. This was an unfortunate cccident, but Mar tini was alwayn ready for such an exigency. "Then she will go to day, I precume"' replied the notary. "Women are uncertain in their plans, you know" And the conversation here ceased. Search for the frtugfc proved unavailiac f The name of the captain, or ofthe vessel in which he would return-all was mystery. The notary assured Madame Decoir that he had as siduously seouht him, without effect; and in a   few wccks after the lad's departure, the cunning 4ntri e-rr had costrivcd to convince the lady thai the boy waR an ingrate, and that he had run away, to escape from her further control. Madame wes deeply mo-vcd by this untoward occurrence. There was but a single being in the world she sincerely loved-and that was Flora De lmont. She esteemed the youth, and would havc had him inclined to wed the "heir- ess." at a future day. if such a matter could have been consummnated. Her kopes in this respect had been thwarted, and she left Paris in anything but a happy mood of mind! The quiet and repose she sErhllt, at Toulon, however, was destined to be of but short dura- tion. She had been domiciled in a beautiful residence at this place scarcely three weeks, when, as Ohe sat one evnir? conversing with Flora, the servant annonnced a gentleman in the drawing-room, below, who would confer with her, if she awa; at leisure. At the same time, the scrvant presented the vieitor's card,upCn which minada me read the name [ of ' Martini, Notary--Paris." MDi I dr m inquired cagerly if any intelligence had yet' been received of the youth's where- bouts, and the notary ornl shock his head. "What has happened, momnieur " she then demandc nl quickly. 4    "I know nothing, lady, only what you may also know, from this paragraph," said Martini; and he took from his pocket a Paris journal, and directed the lady's attention to an item of news it contained, and which read as follows: "A WRECK.-The Dolphin, at Havre, from the Mediterranean, yesterday, reports the total loss of the brig "Pasquelle," which sailed from this port some months since, for Lisbon and the Straits-and which was on the return passage, with a valuable cargo, after a remarkably suc- cessful trip. We regret being called upon to announce the destruction of the vessel, in the late gale, and to add that the whole of the crew were in all probability, lost! as no tidings have been had of them, and the wreck must have oc- curred some weeks ago, at sea." "Tell me, monsieur," said madame, instantly, "what has this to do with him?" "Peradventure, nothing, madame. But, as nearly as I can ascertain, that is the name of the brig in which Elmir sailed from Havre, when he absconded, some months since." The news fell like a thunderbolt upon the senses of both madame and Flora Delmont. At the worst, they fancied that Elmir would be ab- sent from Paris but a few months, and they re- solved upon meeting him, once more, to dissuade him directly from pursuing so precarious a mode of life, if possible. But, for the present, this was not to be. The "Pasquelle" was lost, beyond a doubt. Whether any of her crew were fortunate enough to escape a watery grave, remained to be devel- oped in the future. In tlte meantime, the notary applied himself to the consummation of his plans and designs upon both madame and Elmir, hoping and calculating that, at any rate, he would be able to accomplish his purposes, before any new feature or disclosure should transpire. He deemed that the field for another trial with madame was now open to him; and he chose to appeal to her, again, peremptorily, and to show his cards, if she declined his proffer, at last. The time had come when he thought he could with safety act upon the offensive. Ma- dame was despairing of the probable success of her scheme with Flora and the boy, and he would step in, and win her over to himself ere she should have leisure for serious reflection on the subject. And thus resolved, he waited upon the lady at length, and found her-as he desired to do-alone. She received him cordially, and he commenced at once to enlighten her. "My dear Madame Denoir," began the no- 2 f   tary, in the most obsequious manner, "I trust that you have now had leisure to consider the proposition I have so repeatedly had the honor to submit to you, of late-" "Of what do you speak, monsieur?" "I have asked you to believe, madame, that my esteem and respect for you, is not of an or- dinary character. I love you, and would make you my wife!" "Surely, monsieur, you are not serious," ex- claimed the lady, a good deal surprised at the manner of the notary. "Upon my honor, madame, I mean what I say." "Then monsieur, I have only to reply that I am astounded at your temerity and assurance 1" ' In other words, you have already expressed these sentiments before, madame," said Martini, drily, "and I assure you, now, that your own interest is involved in this affair, more deeply than you at present seem to realize." The lady smiled at the knave, and then re- sponded: "I fancy, monsieur, after your long acquaintance with Maria Denoir, that you have no idea that anything like a threat can affect her 1" "No, madame-I will not stoop to any such unnecessary artifice, I assure you. But, when you shall have been made acquainted - with a certain secret, of which I am now alone pos- sessed, I am inclined to imagine that you will think more seriously and more kindly both of me and my notions. This secret I came here, to-night, to reveal to you, if you are inclined to share it with me." "If I were naturally a curious woman-as readily excited by the marvellous as my sex is too often inclined to be, I might seek to know what this secret is. But,. I assure, you, mon- sieur, I have no fancy for meddling with the affairs of other people, and shall willingly suffer you to retain your treasure-so 'far as I am con- cerned." "I commend your courage, lady-but I am fully prepared to cause you to change your mind." "Come, monsieur," said madame, rising, "I beg you to excuse me, to-night. At some other time, I may hear you-" "No, madame, be seated and listen tome, now. After I have disclosed this little matter to you, I shall feel relieved, myself, and I am sure you will feel differently towards me; for I think I understand your character," insisted Martini.    <pb n="22-23" xml:id="VAC6847-00000010"/> "Monsieur, your secret can have no interest for me, I am satisfied. I am the possessor of a handsome fortune, the sole legatee of the prop- erty of Monsieur Bouvais. I am independent of you and of the world. I seek no favor, and can- not brook this importunity longer." "It is of this very fortune that I would now speak, madame." "Well then, go on, monsieur, go on." "First, then, madame-though you think so, and have thus far had good reason so to be- lieve-yet, let me tell you, you are not the sole legatee of monsieur's estates!" Had the walls of the building in which they sat, fallen into the apartment at that moment, Madame Denoir could not have been more shocked than she was at this extraordinary an- nouncement! For a moment, she stood bolt upright, gazing intently upon the notary, as if she would read every impulse in his wicked brain. Then she staggered forward to a chair- and asked, in a plainly terrified tone-" what does monsieur mean ." "What he says, madame. There are those   who may largely share this fortune with you, if Antonio Martini but wills it!" "I do not-comprehend," replied madame, in the deepest concern. "I am unadvised of any change-I am at a loss to conceive what has transpired to wrest from me my :ights." "No change has occurred, since monsieur's decease, madame-but there are such things as codicils to wills, you know." "But monsieur left no such document.!"m certain." "And I am as certain that he did, madame," continued the notary. "It was cautiously drawn up, some days before his death, and was duly executed, in my presence, madame." "Go on-go on, monsieur; I will listen," said the lady, desperately. "Proceed with your cursed scheme. I will believe nothing, here- f after-trust no one-confide in no one. Go on I Tell me, am I disinherited?" "No, madame; not so bad as that." t Well, then, tell me the worst! I am pre- pared for anything, now." a  The notary drew up his chair at the lady's side, and continued his explanation.   CHlAPTER VI. HOW THE THNG WAS DONE.   AN excited flush had overspread the hand-' some features of the woman, for a moment, but it quickly vanished, as the notary went on. "It might have been, madame," he continued, "that you should be now penniless-but Istood in the way of that. I am your friend, to-day, as I was, and have been, for years past; and, when the documents were being prepared, I took care that your interest should be guarded. Am I not entitled to a measure of thanks for such a course ." "Why have I been kept so long in utter ig- norance of the existence of this pretended codi- cil ." demanded Madame Denoir, peremptorily. "You shall learn details, madame, as we pro- ceed," responded the notary, shrewdly. "To what extent, is my fortune thus impaired, monsieur!" "One half-" "One halfl" "Hear me, madame. One half the personal, and the whole of the real estate." "What!" screamed madame, frantically- "what do you say?" "I am correct, madame; thus reads the codi. cil, I am certain." "I am a pauper, then 1" "O, no-madame. The personal effects of my late lamented friend are of no mean value, surely; they could not fail to amount to-"   "The whole of the real estate," murmured the lady, despondingly-and then, a moment after- ward, she asked, 'who is thelegatee, monsieur ." "There are two of them, madame-Elmir, the runaway boy, and Flora Delmont." "Is it possible?" "It is as I have stated. But the boy's fortune will be very much the largest share." "That is well-" "Yes. But I control it." "You, monsieur?" "Yes, madame-by your leave." "I am his guardian," said madame, firmly. "I beg your pardon, lady-I think you are too fast; I did not leave anything to chance, or doubt, you perceive. The legal gentlemen make some pretensions to business qualifications; and, when the codicil was prepared, I suggested to my late friend that the future heir to so large an amount as he proposed to leave him, might be a minor when monsieur died. I said to my friend, 'would it not be well to be cautious, and secure this to the boy so that he will be benefit- ed by it, through the care and control of some one competent to manage it, in such an event V' And monsieur answered--' yes, yes, Martini, you are correct. Fix it right, and strong; do it ; in your own way, Martini; I confide in your superior judgment.' This, madam, 'was very    <pb n="24-25" xml:id="VAC6847-00000011"/> kind in my friend, and flattering to my humble self. I followed his suggestion, and did so pre- pare the codicil. When it was ready, he signed it-and said, ' Martini, I have known you a long time; you will carry out my views;' the seal was affixed to his signature, the documents were placed in my safe, and the secret remains with me-and yourself, madame." A pause followed this carefully worded and significant statement; but, brief as it was, it had its effect upon the notary's listener, and he saw it, readily. "What do you propose, monsieur?" continued Madame Denoir, at length. "You have heard my avowal, lady; you have learned the state of your own case, and I shall be happy to hear from your lips, whether a com- promise cannot be entered into." "In what way, then'?" "As I have already told you, the boy has ab- sconded, and may never return to France. At any rate, his secret is in my hands. I can con- trol him, and his legacy, as you perceive. He may never know of his good fortune, madame, if you but will it!" "Ah!" exclaimed the woman, cunningly, in a moment, "then you propose to destroy this evidence of his having been named in the codi- cil, and-and-" "No, I don't; you are too fast again, madame. I should not do that, assuredly. But, if you agree, we may keep the secret, jointly; and en- joy the income of the property." "And the condition?" "Must be your hand, madame. You must become my wife!" said the notary, coldly. "Sooner than do which," retorted the woman, severely, "I would give up all, and starve upon the steps of the portal of my late protector and friend!" "Do you carry ft so proudly, madame?" said the notary, in nowise abashed " then let me caution you to be wary. At my will, the boy will return to France. If he comes back, you may be sure I shall so arrange my affair with him that your interests will suffer." "O, monsieur!" exclaimed Madame Denoir, desperately, at last, "can you be serious in this matter i" "I assure you, madame, I never was more so. Andto convince you of the truth of all that I have now said, I took care to bring with me, hither, the documents to which I have alluded, that you might see, for yourself, upon what a   brittle foundation your self-esteemed fortunes are at this moment based." And with this as- surance, which was delivered in a less arrogant, and far more persuasive tone, Martini drew forth from his breast pocket a parchment, and then another, which he handed to the lady to examine. Madame Denoir was an even match for the villain Martini, under the same circumstances I But, as we shall see, the notary had the advan- tage of her in the present contest. She grasped the papers earnestly, and read the codicil-in which she found the bestowal of what she had deemed her fortune, to others. .Then she perused the indenture of guardianship-and then she examined both, again, with the utmost scrutiny. "I see it, monsieur," she said, "you have told me truly. But this is very unexpected." "I do not doubt that you are surprised, ma- dame. But is not my statement accurate '" "It is, monsieur." And is not my power ample '"  "Yes. That is, if these papers are authentic." "All the details can readily be substantiated," continued the notary, with a self-satisfaction which did not escape the lady's notice. "And these instruments are in your hand- writing, I think," added madame. "Exactly. As I told you, they were drawn up with my own hands." "They have not been registered i" "Not as yet." "These, then, are all the evidence that exists of the folly of monsieur, in thus alienating his effects 1" "Those are all-and, save to yourself and him who now addresses you, the subject is a secret." "Without these documents, then," continued Madame Denoir, deeply excited, "there is no proof, no clue to the shameful transaction?" "No, madame-but they are duly signed, and attested, as you will see; and that is sufficient, when I choose to promulgate the facts, should such a course become necessary." "Enough, monsieur;" cried the woman, start- ing wildly to her feet-" enough, scoundrel that you are! Your selfish proposal I spurn with contempt. And, for the evidence you have so long gloated over in secret-these precious docu- ments you have so cautiously and so villanously concealed, to further your own foul schemes- thus, and thus, and thus, I scatter their frag- ments, and disarm you, knave that you have proved-forever "And, as she thus exclaimed, the enraged woman tore the instruments into a   thousand shreds, and dashed the ruins at the notary's feet! As the proud Madame Denoir strode across  the apartment, after this rather melo-dramatic performance, her passion was suddenly cooled, and she was astounded at hearing a low, excited, singular chuckle-a sort of demoniacal laugh-- which the notary was indulging, plainly at her expense! "Leave me, monsieur!" she said, violently. "Leave this house, on the instant. I had not suspected you to be a wolf. But your fangs are extracted-you are harmless, and Marie Denoir is safe!" "Calm yourself, lady," replied Martini, in a soothing and triumphant manner. "You are rash and inexperienced, I perceive. Were this a professional visit, I should feel myself justi- fied in charging you roundly for my advice; as it is, the suggestions I am about to make shall be given gratis." "Gratuitous, you should have said, monsieur. I seek no further advice, at your hands. I shall take counsel elsewhere, in the future; and hence- forth, let us be strangers." "No, madame-that cannot be." "It must be, monsieur!" "You are too fast, I repeat it. I would be your friend; I would advise-you for your best interests; I would have you continue in the en- joyment of this splendid fortune; and I would share it with you. This is my aim-and this I will accomplish! If you drive me from your confidence, I shall not be answerable for conse- quences. But the power is in my hands, ma- dame, and I shall use it to my own advantage." "You are powerless, monsieur-and Marie Denoir is not to be intimidated. By your own admission, the evidence you prated of, is anni- hilated;" and she pointed the notary to the fragments of the codicil upon the carpet. "Think you, Madame Denoir," responded   Martini, in a bitterly sarcastic tone, " think you I should have come hither on the errand of a fool . Could you, for one moment, suspect that I should place myself in your power, thus, after five-and-twenty years' experience with all sorts of people, in every grade of life, under all phases of circumstances? Do you not know me better than to imagine I should be so remiss as to trust the originals of such precious instruments as these in the hands of any one, save myself ' No, no-madame! You have destroyed them, you have shown me your true character, and I am now doubly armed. Those documents were merely copies of the originals!" "What!" murmured the lady, confounded at this reply. "What do you mean, monsieur?" "I mean what I have said, lady. The real instruments are safely deposited, and I can place my hand upon them whenever occasion calls for their production; these are merely trans- cripts." But the now thoroughly alarmed victim of the notary could no longer withstand this sort of contest; and staggering back, confused, morAi- fied, crushed by the villain's duplicity and cun- ning-she fell upon a couch, and her pent up passions found relief in a flood of bitter tears. Martini halted a moment, and beheld the first effects of his wicked scheme. Then rising, he took his leave, for the night, "Madame," he said, "I regret that you should find yourself thus excited, and I will retire. You will believe me to be in earnest, I fancy, after what has transpired, here, to-night; and you may rest assured that your own weal, in the future, is within your control. This secret is still ours; it may so remain-if you desire it; if not, NOT! Bon nuit, madame. I shalF wait upon you, again, to-morrow." With this assurance, Martini departed; leav- ing Madame Denoir still in tears, and a prey to a thousand bitter and fearful reflections.    <pb n="26-27" xml:id="VAC6847-00000012"/> CHAPTER VII. THE HEIRE8 OF TOULON.   IN another apartment of the beautiful dwell- ing where this scene had transpired, there was seated a lovely girl, who had become noted in the town as one of the most fascinating and charming ornaments known to the gay circle of society she had moved in. This sweet girl was Flora Delmont-who had been carefully educa- ted in the best schools of Toulon, and whose real history was in fact very little understood. In general terms it was given out, by those who had had charge of her education, that she was of good origin, and was the prospective heir to a large fortune. But to all this, Flora was most indifferent, apparently! She rarely alluded to, or thought of, her future prospects. With her books, her harp, her embroideries, and her amusements, she was happy, light-hearted, and content with her position; and for her sweetness of disposi- tion and her rare good nature and kindliness, she was universally beloved. There was more than one person who felt a deep interest in her fate, however; she was known and believed to belong to a wealthy family, and when she was spoken of by the fortune-hunters, she was char- acterized as the "heiress of Toulon "-a desig- nation which we shall ascertain by-and-by how much of a claim she was actually entitled to. We have said there was more than one being   who was deeply concerned in Flora's fate; but, of one particular friend we must speak, espe- cially; this person was Madame Denoir, of the French metropolis. As far back as at the age of five years, Flora had been known to have been intimately con- nected, in some way, with Madame Denoir. At that time, this lady came to Toulon; and hav- ing found a family she appeared to be pleased with, she made all her arrangements, and subse- quently presented herself in company with a little girl, for whom she engaged board, and other ordinary accommodations. Regularly, at the expiration of every month, madame made her appearance, with a full purse of gold, and promptly discharged the bill for the child's care and schooling. Nearly a dozen years thus passed away-but, for the last twelvemonth, madame had taken particular pains with her protege; and as soon as she came out into society, fairly, she purchased the fine mansion where we now meet her, in Toulon, and here the beautiful Flora found a comfortable and luxurious home, under the guardianship and charge of madame-who had been so kind and so lavish in her favor previously. There was a deal of romance in these facts- and the gossips said that it was a strange at- tachment. Flora only knew the lady as her   constant and ever watchful friend; and she t called her, invariably, as she had been taught to I do, simply, " madame." The fair young girl was  just now budding into womanhood-and she entertained no cares, she dreamed of nought but contentment and pleasure, and her life had, thus  far, been all sunshine and poetry. Was the 1 storm approaching, and was the prose of her  existence about to be made apparent to her 7 We shall see-anon. Upon recovering from the shock which the notary's recital had occasioned her, Madame Denoir found that he had retired. She had not lost his final words, as he departed, and she felt that they were full of import. "The villain!" she murmured, to herself; "can it be possible that he has entangled me thus in his clutches? Why should I be his victim. Marry him!" she continued, fiercely, "marry him . Sooner would I sacrifice every iota of the wealth which is involved in this plot -sooner would I submit to beggary. No-Marie Denoir has erred, and she may be crushed, at last; but Martini shall not vanquish her, at any rate! A little diplomacy-a little delay-a ruse or two, perhaps-and I may be the victor. We shall see, monsieur-" she continued, seemingly relieved, after her reflections-" we shall see!" Flora had left the apartment very soon after the notary's arrival; and, during the interview between madame and Martini, she had perused the fearful paragraph in the newspaper he had brought with him, which contained the brief ac- count of the loss of the "Pasquelle." For the first time in her life, Flora had now experienced unhappy reflections. Why it was, she could scarcely determine-but certain it was, that young Fonblanc had made a very favorable impression upon her mind; and, through the encouragement given by Madame Denoir (to whose counsel she always listened with respect and regard), she had been led to believe that they would meet again, and often, after their first happy interview in Paris. But the scene suddenly changed-Elmir had fled from the society of the friends who were anxious to serve and favor him-and the result of that false step (as she and madame believed it to be) was now before them I Elmir had been lost at sea I At first, madame was distressed, and deeply sorrowed for this untimely occurrence. The plan of her life was now frustrated. But she had had hardly time to give this a moment's thought, before Martini commenced to disclose   the secret that had been committed to his care by the boy's uncle-and in which, at least for the passing moment, she was more deeply interested. After the notary had gone, therefore, she en- deavored to look calmly at the whole case, and she finally felt more resigned to whatever might be in store for her. If the boy were lost-if El- mir were dead-then would Flora become heir to the disputed estate, without question, in ma- dame's mind. But, if the report should prove exaggerated, and Elmir should return, safely (which it was probable he might do), then he could assume and maintain his existing rights. But-on the other hand-if Elmir should come back, according to Martini's account, the boy was utterly ignorant of the fact that the co- dicil existed, and through the machinations of such a villain as she now felt the notary to be, the chances were that the cunning rogue would take measures with him to destroy the property which would naturally accrue to him, at his ma- jority, anid thus cut off all hope of compromise. This might readily be accomplished by Martini, should he meet with the boy first, on his arrival, which he would most naturally do-under the circumstances. "Yet, after all, the report in reference to the loss of the brig might be incorrect. It might even have been coined-by Martini himself!- and the whole story might prove a fabrication, on the part of the notary, for the furtherance of his own selfish purposes. Madame believed that the villain was fully equal to this, or any ether scheme, to enhance his own prospects or interests; and she did not judge him prema- turely or unjustly. Her eyes had now suddenly been opened. She turned over in her mind every circumstance that she could collect, having any bearing upon the case; she called up all that the notary had divulged, and conned it over, again and again; ; she 'discredited Martini's assurances and his asseverations ; she doubted all things, and hoped for the best, in the future. Resolved, at length, 3 to give the scoundrel battle, if she were forced 3 into an attitude of self-defence, through his treachery, she summoned all her self-possession, and having calmed herself sufficiently, she de- termined upon her course, and rang for her attendant. 9 "Has Mademoiselle Flora retired " she asked, as the servant entered. "No, madame," was the reply. "I have but  just left her, and she desires to see you." .    <pb n="28-29 (Illustration) " xml:id="VAC6847-00000013"/> "It is well; send her to me." Flora entered the apartment shortly after- wards, and greeted madame cordially. There was the slightest show of disturbance, only, upon the countenance of madame, and Flora, miscon- struing her emotion, archly said: "Dear madame, pardon me-but do you think this terrible news can be true. Is he probably lost ." This query seemed a fortunate one, under the circumstances; and madame quickly availed herself of a reply, to explain without effort her visible uneasiness. "I trust, Flora, that this is a false rumor. In- deed I have cause to suspect that we may have been misinformed, and that the disaster thus briefly recounted, is a mistake-or that it may have no reference whatever to Elmir Fonblanc.' "Do you think so, madame ." exclaimed the young lady, with undisguised pleasure; "do you really think so That would indeed be joyful." "Such may be the case, Flora. Nevertheless, it is possible that the record may be true, and we may have lost our hope Still, I shall not rest satisfied with the existing state of things, and I have sent for you now to say that I shall take a place in the diligence at daybreak, to- morrow, and shall proceed at once to Havre to inquire into this and other matters of import- ance to you and myself, in connection with this affair." "And may I not join you, madame?" asked Flora, at once.            "No, not this time. I must leave you to en- tertain monsieur the notary, to-morrow." "Martini?" "Yes; he will call to see me, he said, on the morrow." "Madame, I do not fancy Martini." "And whynot, pray i" "Is he your friend, truly, madame!" queried Flora, indisposed to give offence to her whom   she so deeply loved-but not a little suspicious, still. "INo, Flora!" said madame, quickly, "I do not deem him my friend. Notwithstanding this, however, he has left me, to-night, with the assur- ance that he will come again to-morrow; and I have no desire to see him. I shall proceed. immediately to Havre, and will communicate with you, by post, constantly-that you may know what is my purpose and what is my success." "I shall be very lonely, madame, now." "Not at all, Flora. You have the same pleas- ures and enjoyments to pursue that you ever had; and I shall not be absent a great many days, at farthest. When monsieur calls, say that I am gone to Paris-for I shall proceed to the capital, before my return-and treat him as you have ever had occasion to, heretofore. For the present, it must be so; and for the future, I will explain to you my course and my intentions, as circumstances may warrant." "I submit to your directions, dear madame and will observe your instructions." "Do so, Flora-and now, good night." The gentle girl kissed her friend, and retired As the door closed behind her retreating form, a tear fell from the eyelids of Madame Denoir- who, be she what she might-deeply loved that tender girl, whom she had fostered and protected from her birth! The order had been given in the proper quar- ters, and at daybreak, Madame Denoir, unat- tended, took a seat in the diligence for the north. She was a proud woman, and her resolution once taken, was not easily thwarted. Sheddetermined to head off the scheme of the notary, if he had deceived her-and she did not doubt that he had undertaken to coerce her, without the power to carry out his plans. At all events, she would satisfy herself, beyond doubt or question-and trust to further devel- opments for the result, be it what it might.   THE HEIRESS OF TOULON.  Elmir Fonblance Introduction to Flora Delmont, the Heiress of Toulon..-See Chap IT, .p 1t4.    <pb n="30-31" xml:id="VAC6847-00000014"/> CHAPTER VIII. ELMR FONBLANC'S ADVENTURES AS A SAILOR.   A GLORIOUS morning sun was shining on the' coast of Portugal, a few days subsequently to the events just narrated, and the ancient hill- tops and fine old castellated buildings of Lisbon were gilded with the brilliant rays of the day- god, as he rose high in the heavens. The bay in front of the city was dotted with every description of craft, from the tiny dory of the impoverished fisherman, to the magnificent ship from foreign climes. At the principal quay lay numerous small vessels, loading with fruits and wines, or discharging their assorted cargoes, brought from other lands; and strolling about might be seen the indolent lazzaroni of the vi- cinity, in their tattered dress and careless aban- donment, all unconcerned for the future, and seemingly content that the sun shone upon them, or that they had a being! A short distance below the spot where the bustle appeared to be the greatest, there was moored a small brig, from the peak of which there hung a French flag, and which was ready loaded and about to sail-as soon as the breeze freshened. Her crew had been shipped some days previously, but a young man, apparently twenty years old, made his appearance near the gang-plank, and addressing the first officer, who leaned against the rail-he asked: "Is the captain aboard, monsieur '?   The mate looked at the interrogator, and an- swered, " yes-what will you have " "I would like to see him. Shall I come on board i" "You're a sailor, are you not?" "Yes, monsieur; and I would like to join your crew, if I may." "Our complement of men is made up, and we have no need of further assistance." "Can I see the captain?" "It will be useless-but you can try him. Go below," he continued. "The master is in the cabin." The young man quickly followed this advice, and found the master of the vessel, as he had been directed. "Bon jour, monsieur!" said the youth, pleas- antly, and respectfully, upon reaching the table at which the captain was engaged in writing some letters. The person thus addressed, turned about and said, " good day, young man; what can I do for you?" He was a fine looking man of past fifty, and the address of the youthful stranger pleased him. He looked at the boy a moment, and saw that his face was intelligent, and that he was one evidently above the ordinary character of seamen. "You are ready to sail, and I would join you in your voyage. The French ensign floating from    <pb n="32-33" xml:id="VAC6847-00000015"/> your peak, attracted me, for it is the flag of my country, and I would return home in a French r bottom, if possible, monsieur."      p "We are bound to London, young man, with  the first fair wind, and from thence we shall re- I turn to Marseilles. But whence do you now c come" ." "I have been in Lisbon only two days, mon c sieur, and am destitute. I am anxious to get a back to France. I shipped on board the "Pas- quelle," from Havre, some months ago, and after a prosperous outward voyage, were on our re- turn, and were wrecked near the Spanish coast, two weeks since. I was fortunate enough to s escape with my life, and have found my way  hither, after some pretty rough treatment on sea and land! I am something of a sailor, mon- sieur, and will join you for small pay-since I may thus return home again, in company with my countrymen." "We are well provided-" "So your first officer informed me." "But we are not going to Havre." "It doesn't matter, captain. I will serve you to the best of my ability, and you may leave me on your arrival in the Thames, with such an amount of remuneration as your own generosity may dictate." The captain agreed to this, finally, and our young friend, Fonblanc (who had thus escaped death, and who had found his way to this port), was accordingly registered among the crew of the good brig "Belle," Captain Stanville, bound to London. Elmir had a berth assigned him at once, in the forecastle, and he very quickly showed himself to be a good sailor, for his age, both to his messmates and the officers of the brig. When the vessel got under way, the youngster (as the old tars called him) was the first man in the rigging, the tautest on a pull, the smartest at a reefing, the quickest at obeying any given order, and the merriest among the mess, when below. His superiors watched him with a good deal of interest, and, as he thus came in the way of some show of favoritism, though he aimed to avoid it, the men soon became jealous of him; and he found that in spite of his best efforts to the contrary, he was to be made as uncomforta- ble as possible. Notwithstanding this, however, he submitted with the best grace he could to the constant annoyances he met with, and con- soled himself that the voyage would fortunately be a brief one.   The crew of the brig were a dubious set of rascals, and a good deal of trouble had been ex- perienced with them, already. Two of them, who were Portuguese, and a third a Spaniard, had given evidence of discontent and mischiev- ous inclinations, from the day they shipped- but the officers were on the qui vive, and no open demonstrations were offered, of a serious char- acter, until the week prior to the arrival of the "Belle," off the Thames river. For three or four days, the trio had often been observed to be together, conversing in broken French and Spanish, and evidently arranging some plan for an assault upon the officers! The captain could not be convinced of it, however, until at the last moment. The watch had been changed, so that but one of them could be on deck at a time-but still they found means to confer together; and a plot was finally discov- ered, that they. had arranged, to seize upon the vessel and cargo! On the last day but one before reaching the mouth of the Thames, the captain sent for El- mir, and upon sounding him, found that he could be relied on. Four others of the crew were also questioned, closely; and the officers having thoroughly armed themselves, an order was sud- denly given to summon " all hands on deck!" Seven of the crew, including the three despera- does alluded to, remained sullenly below-re- fusing to respond! The captain returned has- tily to his cabin, and placing a cutlass in the hands of Elmir and those whom he had pre- viously tried, ordered them up to aid in defend- ing the brig from the mutiny which was now too apparent to be longer trifled with. By this time, the scoundrels who had hatched up the plot to take the vessel, found that what- rever they had to do was now to be done-or it would very quickly be too late, Rushing with t a wild hurrah of defiance up the forecastle hatch- way, the desperate knaves dashed aft, with up- lifted knives and whirling handspikes; and their I attack was so furious and so sudden, with an equal number of men only to oppose them, that their onslaught was well nigh successful! Three of the well disposed portion of the crew o had been felled to the deck, when a pistol shot w- was heard, and the Spaniard staggered forward r, and sunk in his tracks, fearfully wounded. The o captain and mate rushed into the melee with the 1. stoutest determination, and Elmir, backed by y two heavy sailors, met the two Portuguese and a third man, just as they mounted the quarter-   deck. The contest was brief, however. The firearms in the hands of the defenders of the brig executed sad havoc, and the chances were too unequal! A third and fourth man among the assailants fell beneath the steady stroke of young Elmir, who was foremost in his duty, and the rascals were vanquished. The wind was blowing fresh from the west- ward, and the helmsman had become alarmed and left his post, for a moment. The brig broached to, and before she could be brought up, her sails were all aback, and the utmost consterT nation succeeded. Elmir was hurt-and though the blood flowed freely from a deep cut upon the side of his head, he sprang to the wheel, and soon threw off the brig's head to the wind, again. The officers managed to secure the villains who had been disabled in the conflict, and the rest skulked to the forecastle, whence they were subsequently taken, placed in irons, and were thus carried prisoners into London-where the brig arrived, on the third day following the mutiny. The wound received by Elmir proved a serious one, and when the "Belle" came to anchor in the stream, our hero was insensible to what was transpiring about him. A delirious fever set in   two days before, and he was in a very precarious condition when the vessel came to her anchorage. The master of the brig proceeded to the authori- ties, immediately, the mutineers were taken Ashore, the Spaniard had died from his wounds, and had been buried, and young Elmir was placed upon a litter and conveyed to the London Hospital, utterly unconscious of what was going on, or what would be his future fate. His case was duly represented by the captain of the "Belle," and every care was bestowed upon the poor wounded sailor, by those who took him in charge. He had conducted himself most val- iantly, but his chances for recovery were found to be exceedingly questionable. In the meantime, Madame Denoir-resolved upon learning all the facts in relation to the co- dicil to Monsieur Bouvais's will-and deter- mined to satisfy herself of the whereabouts of Elmir (if he were still alive), reached Havre in safety, and went about the prosecution of her design right earnestly. How she succeeded, and what were the results of the notary's plans, we shall explain in our fu- ture chapters. Martini was busy, too-and his  scheme was well arranged, as we shall see hereafter.    <pb n="34-35" xml:id="VAC6847-00000016"/> CHAPTER IX. MADAME DENOIR IN HAVRE.   Ix a quiet and retired street in Havre, which was frequented but little by the citizens, on ac- count of its difficulty of approacl from the prin- cipal thoroughfares of the town,'there was loca- ted a man who had but lately reached the place, and whose business was apparently very insig- nificant He was a lawyer by profession-but, judging from the time he occupied in the little apartment which he dignified by the name of "his office," his practice was but small! Monsieur Lemoine-for such was the name he was known by-was a singular looking and a more singular acting personage. But he inter- fered with the business of no one, he contracted no accounts, his acquaintances were very few, and he lived, seemingly, without a thought for any body or any particular object, in the future. He had occupied his little office some weeks- off and on-and customers were few and far be- tween, thus far, in his experience Upon her arrival in Havre, Madame Denoir desired to consult with an attorney upon the course she should pursue; and she looked about for a legal counsellor. She chanced to be pass- ing through the Rue de la Plate, when she dis- covered a modest sign, upon a very modest dwelling, which read-"Lemoine, Attorney and Counsellor." On her return to her hotel, she met with a card bearing the same address, at   "La Rue de la Platte, No. 54." It was a strange affair, but the servant left this card with her, among others, in reply to her wish to learn the address of two or three gentlemen of the law. An hour afterwards, she ordered a cab, and was set down at the attorney's door. On beingsshown into the little room, she saw a decrepit man of most uncommon appearance and demeanor, who rose to greet her, and who bowed very low, as she entered. He was over fifty, hunch-backed, and nervous in his move- ments-and his whole contour was very forbid- ding. His complexion was dingy, his eyes were screened with a huge pair of green goggles, and a very high plaited white neckerchief enveloped his throat, over which he seemed to peep at his visitor, in a most curious and disagreeable man- ner. His voice was squeaking and woman-like, his dress was of the most marked and eccentric fashion; and, altogether, he seemed a living caricature, rather than a respectable human be- ing. But madame had been attracted to his office out of curiosity, and she thought that in spite of his queer exterior, he might be of service to her; and so she resolved to try him. "I have called for professional advice, mon- sieur," she said. "I am a stranger in Havre, and I desire that our interview may be confi- dential."   Without replying, Lemoine directed his at- tendant to retire-and thus said: "You might have called upon a more noted attorney, madame, but you could not have hon- ored any one who would more willingly and earnestly serve you. What is your Business?"  "Some months ago, a relative of mine died, leaving me his estate--" "A large one, madame?" squeaked the attor- ney, stooping over his desk, and commencing a memoranda of the statement. "Yes, monsieur. That is, sufficiently large to be worth the retaining." "And there arise doubts as to the titles, ma- dame, I suppose?" "No, monsieur Listen to me, please, and I will explain." "I beg your pardon-proceed, madame." "The estate so left, monsieur, I have now en- joyed for a year, and more-and a codicil to the will has just been found." "A codicil!" "Yes. By this instrument, I am cut off from two-thirds of the property." "Is the codicil registered?" "No, monsieur." "Where is the document?" "In the possession of a scoundrel, who is de- termined to make use of it to my detriment." "Then you wish to retain possession of the whole, and-" "I wish to retain my rights, whatever they may be," said madame, quickly. "Then you must get possession of that codi- cil, before it shall have been placed on record, madame." "I cannot do this." "Then you have no case, madame-that is very clear. The codicil will take precedence of your claim, by all means. If the possessor of the writing can be induced-" "That is it, monsieur-that is just what I de- sire to effect; I would get possession of the in- strument, and will pay roundly to do so." "It is not so easy, that! Who holds this co- dicil now, madame?" "Ah, monsieur! It is in the hands of a des- perate man, whom it is difficult to deal with." "Yet he may be managed," said the attorney, as if confident of his own skill. "I say he may be-but you will find it necessary to deal with your counsel in detail, madame, if you would succeed-and be frank in your instructions and assertions."   "Such are my intentions, monsieur." "Who is the possessor of this codicil, then?" "Martini, the notary." "Martini, of Paris '" exclaimed the attorney, starting. "The same, monsieur." "I know him, madame. He is shrewd and cautious, to a fault." "Could not money-a liberal outlay-induce him to yield, think you!" "That depends entirely upon what his object may be; that is to say-if mere pecuniary gain is his aim, we could contrive to manage him. But, if Martini has any object else, which he haq set his mind on, and chances to have the power in his own hands-he is a man to use that power, be sure of it, madame!" There was a strange earnestness in the lawyer's manner, which left a singular impression upon the heart of the lady who now appealed to him- and she feared that his words would prove too true! She rallied, however, and added: "Monsieur, I have ready means at my com- mand, and I am amply able to reward you if you accomplish the object I have now spoken of. Everything is at stake with me in this mat- ter; and I would get possession of that codicil, seasonably. If you can succeed in this-I will pay you fifty thousand francs for the document, when you shall place it in my hands, provided it has not been previously registered." "Fifty thousand francs is a large sum, ma- dame 1" "It is nothing to the value of that codicil to me, when once cancelled, monsieur. Will you undertake it i" "I will, madame." "When- " "Forthwith." "It is well. You say you know Martini l" "Yes-by reputation. He is one of the fore- most in the profession, in France. I will com- municate with him, directly. Who are the other parties to this will?" "It matters nothing," said the lady, "since they are minors. Once the codicil is in my pos- session, I will provide for them." "And if you do not succeed in obtaining the instrument, what is the result, madame?" "I must obtain it!" "So you shall, if I can aid you to do so, assur- edly Fifty thousand francs, you said, I think," continued the attorney, assuming a deep interest in this extravagant offer.    <pb n="36-37" xml:id="VAC6847-00000017"/> "Yes," responded the lady. "I will pay you that sum for your own services, and I authorize you to pay Martini his price-be it what it may -in addition to this amount, if he will deliver into your hands that paper." "The proposal is a liberal one, truly." "I am aware of that-and I will satisfy you that I am able to perform my part of the con- tract." "I do not doubt you, madame. How came the notary in possession of this codicil?" queried the attorney, at last, evidently desirous to begin his job with a clear understanding of all its bear- ings. "He says it was placed in his keeping by the donor, just before his decease. But Martini is a villain, monsieur; and villains are easily man- aged." "Not always, madame. He is cunning and well advised, and in a matter of this kind, would be difficult to deal with. Still I fancy he may be induced to compromise, unless he has insu- perable objections to interfere with our proposals. Has any offer ever been male him, as yet?" "No, monsieur;" said the lady. And then she added, "that is-I have made him none." "Has he been applied to?" "Yes-yes-and his terms are-"   "Then he has proposed terms!" exclaimed the attorney, evidently surprised at this turn of the affair. "You are correct, monsieur. He has offered to take the property to himself-and with it, the person of your humble servant! For this, he will destroy the codicil." "Oho! This is the state of the case, eh!" "You now know all, monsieur." ) "And you decline to wed him?" "Most determinately, monsieur." "Perhaps not-perhaps not, madame ;" con- tinued the attorney, wish a grin. "I would sooner be made a beggar, and starve -monsieur! I despise him, and would gladly pay liberally to get rid of him." "Well, madame-I comprehend your object; and will give you my best efforts to arrange the affair. I will wait on you, in ten days-and report." Madame thanked the attorney, left her ad- dress, deposited a heavy purse of gold with him, as a retaining fee, and departed in excellent spirits. As she went out, a fendish smile lighted up the attorney's ape-like countenance, and he said to himself: "I shall succeed, even yet!"   CHAPTER X. A NEW PHASE IN OUR PLOT.   THREE days after this interview, Martini might have been seen alone in his private room in the city of Paris-at evening-with a pile or letters before him. Through his management, the entire correspondence between Flora Del- mont and Madame Denoir had been turned from its intended destination, and he had possessed himself of all that had passed between them-or which should have done so-from the day that madame left Toulon! He read the hearthurnings and the disappoint- ments which had been occasioned to both from the fact that neither had heard from the other, from the day they separated-be learned some secrets which he was desirous to be convinced of, through the same sources-and he also as- certained how much he was himself esteemed by these two ladies! But all this moved him not a jot. He had determined upon his course, and he felt certain that the reins were in his own hands. Possiblj Martini was mistaken. On the evening mentioned, there was a letter reached him, addressed to Madame Denoir, the superscription of which attracted his especial notice-for he suspected the handwriting! He glanced at it, turned to the seal, and securing the door of his apartment, broke open the enve- lope, and with profound astonishment, read as follows:   Hospital, Lonon, - , 18-. MY DEAR MADAME DENOIR:-What I have  suffered, since I was induced to leave my native land, I cannot describe to you. Sickness, toil, shipwreck-everything but starvation, has been the lot of him whom you once so kindly cared for, and. who would never have thus ventured forth into the world, but at your solicitation. Bearing in mind ydur kindness, however, I had labored so to comport myself that you might hear a good account of your humble protege- but a succession of misfortunes followed me, and I am now penniless, in a London hospital- though well nigh recovered from the effects of the wounds which brought me here. I have ventured to address you, therefore, to ask your advice as to my future course, and to assure you, at the same time, of my continued regard for one who has done so much for me, in times past. I left Havre in the vessel selected by your friend-our friend, I should say-Mon- sieur Martini, the notary; on our homeward passage, we were wrecked. I obtained a berth subsequently in Lisbon-a mutiny occurred on board, in which, while aiding to defend the offi- cers, I was severely wounded, and arriving in London, was placed in this hospital, where I am 3 still an invalid. I would return to France, madame-at least,    <pb n="38-39" xml:id="VAC6847-00000018"/> temporarily. I would return, in order that I may have the opportunity to thank you, in per- son, for your goodness to me, and I would very gladly meet you again, after our unhappy sepa- ration. My inclinations are unaltered, and, under your advice, I should continue to follow the sea as a business, in the future. But I am without means, in a strange land, in ill condition, at present, to buffet the hardships of such a life, and I throw myself upon your lenity, in my painful extremity. May I not add that it would afford me un- qualified pleasure, also, to meet with Ma'amoi- selle Flora, again? Her image has been present with me, constantly, in my journeyings, and I have looked forward with a joyous anticipation to the hour when I should, haply, see her again. I will not trouble you with a longer letter on this occasion, but will simply express the hope that you will find it agreeable and convenient to reply to this, at your early leisure. In the meantime, I would ask that you present my regards to her, as well as to monsieur, the notary; and accept, for yourself, my warmest good feeling. I remain, truly, Your friend and servant, ELMR FONBLANC. Martini read this letter, over and over again! It was the first authentic account he had re- ceived from the boy, since he villanously caused him to leave France! Fortunate, indeed, was it that the letter had fallen into his hands, instead of reaching madame, as it should have done. But he had been known in Paris as her attorney and adviser, for years, and he found it no diffi- cult matter to intercept this, as he had other letters. He placed this important document carefully in his breast pocket, and soon after left his office, again. Madame Denoir got to be very anxious, dur- ing the ten days which elapsed between her sin- gularly contrived interview with Monsieur Le- moine; and her leisure during that period was occupied in reflection upon her position, the chances in store for her, and addressing a letter or two to'her protege, Flora Delmont. She could ascertain nothing new or satisfactory, fur- ther, in regard to Elmir-and her anxiety to meet the insignificant looking attorney had be- come serious-when the day for his coming at last arrived. Monsieur Lemoine was prompt to his engage-   ment. At early evening, on the tenth day after she first met him, a cab halted at her hotel door, and the deformed attorney presented his card, and quickly followed that to the lady's parlor. Without ceremony he entered, and commenced his business, at once. "I have looked over the subject matter you were kind enough to entrust me with, madame," he said, in his squeaking tone of voice, "and since I had the honor of serving you, I have communicated with monsieur, le notary." "With what success did you meet?" queried madame, somewhat earnestly; "and what can I hope for?" "I find the case an exceedingly complicated affair, madame," said Lemoine, shrewdly, " and Martini is in possession of information, I found, that bears unfavorably against you." "Has he turned traitor, as well as knave?" demanded madame, severely, but proudly. "(I cannot answer that, madame, but I have ascertained that he is in possession, actually, of the codicil you have described, and thus has the ability to deprive you of a very large proportion of your supposed property-whenever it pleases him to register the instrument." "May it not be a forgery, monsieur?" ex- claimed madame, in the faint hope that even such a defence might be set up in regard to the document in question. "That were but a frail supposition, madame, and would be exceedingly difficult of proof, you perceive. No-I do not imagine monsieur is so shallow as that; the codicil is undoubtedly genuine." "And what follows, monsieur-supposing that, the notary sets up this claim?" "The result is very plain. An unconditional reversal of the bulk of the estate, real and per- sonal, to the heir therein named, and a well- founded claim upon your remaining portion, for the amounts appropriated by you, since you came into possession, over and above what actually belongs to you.!" "What, monsieur!" said the lady, alarmed at this information. , I am serious, madame. Such is clearly the present position of this business; which I have examined, critically, with a view to your possi- ) ble benefit and your real interests." "Then am I ruined, monsieur!" "I confess to you that the prospect is exceed- ingly dubious, madame. The claim of the notary in favor of the heir, for the income upon that   portion of this large estate, which monsieur alleges you have squandered-" How, monsieur!" "I only repeat his words, madame. He as- serts that this amount is such, that to liquidate it, your whole interest will scarcely be sufficient." "And he would rob and ruin me!" "I think not, madame." "Such is his plan-such would be the result of his course." "So it would be, madame, provided he carried- out so inconsiderate a scheme as you suspect him weak enough to perform." "What else can be done ." "There is an alternative, I learn, madame." "Name it, monsieur, I pray you." "It is simple-but-" "Stop!" cried the lady, quickly; "I know what you will add. The scoundrel demands my hand!" "You are right, madame." "And this is his proposed compromise?" "You are right again, madame," said the at- torney, in the coolest possible manner. "Then he may produce his codicil, take the property, beggar me-if he will-I will never listen, for a moment, to his protestations." "He loves you, I think, madame." "Love  Martini capable of loving! Ah,   monsieur; you do not know the notary so well as I do-I fancy." "Perhaps I do," responded the attorney, con- fidently. "Be it so, then. I swear to you, I will part with life, property, anything-everything-but I will tot wed him." "You may relent, madame." "Never-monsieur!" "If such be your determinate resolve," con- tinued the attorney, rising, "I am at a loss, just now, to give you farther advice. I will turn the matter over in my mind, however; and within a day or two, will communicate with you, if you desire it again. In the meantime, something may turn up, for your advantage." "I shall be happy to see you, monsieur; but shall leave Havre in a very few days. If you find it convenient to wait upon me, say within three days-should you deem it worth your while-you will find me here." "I shall undoubtedly call," replied monsieur -and the door closed immediately upon his exit. Madame Denoir was perplexed. She" sus- pected that the' attorney had been influenced by the notary, in some way; and she reflected long and deeply upon the circumstances which had transpired within the past fortnightS!    <pb n="40-41" xml:id="VAC6847-00000019"/> CHAPTER XI. A LETTEB FROM AN OLD ACQUAINTANCE   As madame sat in earnest thought, deeply distressed with the prospect before her (for, al- though she felt aware that the property she en- joyed would but pass into the possession of young Elmir and Flora, yet she knew of, and feared, the guardianship to which it was en- trusted), her reverie was interrupted by a rap at her parlor door. "Come in!" she said, at once. The servant entered, bearing upon a small salver a letter, addressed to madame. She glanced at the superscription, turned the missive over, and observing that the seal was broken, demanded: "Whence comes this ." "Is it not for madame?" "Yes-yes. Where did you get it?" "In the hall, outside the door, madame. I was passing, andtpicked it up near the head of the staircase. I noticed that the seal was broken, and I supposed, from the address, that you might have dropped it." "You may retire," said madame-and turning to the signature, her joy may be imagined, when she read the name of Elmir Fonblanc! She a turned to the date, however, and read, "Hospi- f tal, London," and her emotions were instantly  changed to those of astonishment, sorrow, and s pain. But she read the letter through-every s   ly syllable-that letter which brought her such 1- gladdening and yet such sorrowful news from a- him in whom she felt so deep an interest! And )f she learned, now, for the first time, much that d she had never conceived of before! F- rom this epistle, she learned that Elmir had tt left Paris, at her suggestion! and she instantly traced this deceit to Martini. She re-read the letter, and saw how the poor boy had been duped, 1 and she charged it to the same agency. She d dwelt upon his sufferings, the hardships and pri- e vations he had been subjected to, so maliciously , and so villanously, through the deceit and cun- ning of the notary, and her heart sank within her, as she reflected upon that wretch's duplicity. Elmir Fonblanc, the youth for whom she had cherished the brightest hopes, was now a suffer- ing invalid in the London hospital! This fact stared her in the face, and she resolved to de- part, instanter, to his relief. She would not de- lay an hour. With her own eyes, she would behold him-with her own hands, bear to him the aid he needed. But this letter-whence came it t This was a mystery, indeed! Into whose hands had it fallen Who had dared to break the seal? Might it not be a forgery! She suspected this- she believed that it might be a part of the foul scheme of Martini to crush her-and she turned   again to the superscription. It was duly post- marked "London," and was addressed to her at Paris. How came the letter in Havre-at the very door of her lodging-room! No one had visited her, there, except Lemoine, the attorney. Could he have dropped it? How came he in * possession of it? A most inexplicable mystery enveloped this singular affair, and the lady's queries and suspicions, as yet, were all unan- swered-in her own mind. In spite of the importance which seemed to attach to her immediate response to this letter, she felt an uncontrollable desire to speak with Lemoine before she departed for London. He had appointed to confer with her again within three days. She could not endure such a delay, under the circumstances; ard so she determined to send for him in the morning, inform him of the singular discovery she had made, and con- sult with him regarding the future. She wrote him a brief note, next day, inform- ing him in a few words of the finding of the let ter, and stating to him her resolve to visit Lon- don immediately. Her messenger returned with the reply that monsieur would call upon her during the day. Noon passed away-evening set in-but Lemoine did not come. This was strange, thought madame, but she tarried and still looked for the attorney, but without success; he did not make his appearance! Meantime, the steamer had left Havre for England, and in due time arrived in the Thames. A stranger, from Paris, repaired from this ves- sel, in hot haste, and inquired his way directly ' to the London hospital. Upon reaching that institution, he made himself known to the direc- tors, and asked for one Elmir Fonblanc, who had been conveyed thither some time previously from a mutinous vessel. He was quickly intro- duced, and the boy soon had the satisfaction of grasping the hand of his oldfriend-Martini, the notary! The cunning villain informed Elmir that he came, post haste, direct from his old benefactor, Madame Denoir, who had received his letter- but who. was too ill to reply to it, and too deeply embarrassed to offer him much aid; she had empowered him, however, to see Elmir and supply such present help as he needed; and he came to know the details of his position, and aid him, if it were in his power. The boy was overjoyed to meet monsieur, and did not hesitate to express his sorrow at the un- * fortunate position in which monsieur had left   madame. He inquired, then, for Flora Delmont; and learned from the notary that the beautiful girl he had so fondly remembered had retired to a convent-when the pecuniary trouble of ma- dame Denoir had been exposed to her I At least, 'so monsieur had heard, though he seemed to know but very little about the fact, and to care less. All this was most unwelcome intelligence to the poor youth, who had suffered much, in body and mind, since he left the two friends spoken of-but Martini observed his emotion, and gave him no time for reflection. "I am glad to note," said he, shrewdly, " that your condition is much more favorable than I had been led to believe. You are quite well, Elmir-eh?" "No, monsieur-not entirely well; but still I am gaining rapidly, and shall soon recover, I trust." "Very well-you need not remain here any longer." "Thank you, monsieur. If it be your wish, I shall gladly exchange my quarters, here, for a less public location; and think I shall improve, proportionately, if I could leave." "It is madame's wish, Elmir, that you be re- moved from the hospital,\at once; and in accord- ance with her suggestion, I have prepared quar- ters for you, at the house of an old friend of mine, near the Thames, where you will get better air, and who will attend to your wants, carefully and kindly, until you shall be ready to resume your profession again." This last hint rather grated upon Elmir's ears, for he had become somewhat prejudiced against a seafaring life, and had hoped that he might be able to quit it, after the hazards and ill luck he had thus far met with. But it was not to be thus! He could not oppose the wishes of Madame Denoir, and he submitted with the best grace he could assume. Within another hour, a permit for his discharge had been obtained; and, in company with the notary, he left the hospital for his new lodgings, at a distance, upon the banks of the Thames. Madame waited at her hotel in vain for the coming of Monsieur Lemoine, and on the morn- ing of the second day after she wrote him, she took steamer, and left, abruptly, for London. She arrived in due course of time, and applied to the authorities for permission to visit the hospital. Considerable delay was occasioned, but at last her carriage stood before the entrance.    <pb n="42-43" xml:id="VAC6847-00000020"/> She was shown into the premises, and encoun- tered a burly man, in a heavy bob-wig and very tight knee-breeches, who was superintendent of the institution. "You have a patient under your care-" "Yes, mum," returned the old fellow, gruffly; "we've a good many patients under our care!" "I was about to say that you have a patient by the name of Fonblanc, whom I wished to see," responded the lady, not a little surprised at the rudeness of the man in authority. "Ah, Fonblanc, Fonblanc," repeated the burly functionary, "Fonblanc? I don't remem- ber no such name. Never mind-where'd he come from? Stop, I'll see. Look at the rec- ords. Fonblanc? How do you spell it? What is is fust name? You're his mother, eh? Sis- ter, perhaps. No matter, never mind-it's all the same. What's his trade?" "He came here from on ship-board. Wound- ed in a scuffle, or mutiny, or something of the kind." "O, yes, dare say. A fight, got his head cracked, served him right, no doubt-how old  is he!"  "About twenty, sir."  "Ah, Fonblanc-I have it. Been here several i weeks-good boy-saved captain's life-mutiny on board-behaved well-here it is, on the books f -discharged, yesterday!"  "Discharged! He hasn't left the hospital "I "You say he hasn't, I say he has; who knows E best, mum ".  "I beg your pardon, sir-but-"      e "No consequence-all right-he's gone. Time s is precious-very sorry, mum, but-rules of the f institution," continued the keeper, handing the b lady a card; from which she learned that the v hospital was closed to visitors, promptly, at five b P. M., and the clock had just struck that hour. o "You couldn't inform me whither the young p man is gone?" said Madame Denoir, respect- k fully.                  p "  You say I can't, and you're right, mum-I dunno."                 h As the lady was about to turn away, she be- to thought her of one more query, and asked: S "Did he go alone, sir i"        vs "Go alone? O, yes, mum; his legs was quite n strong, a week ago."           in "I mean, sir, had he any companion?" ta "Yes-that is, I dunno. I'll see-look at the le books, to obleege you; but it's past the time, C you see, pn' you mustn't stop-here it is, Mar- s. ;   n- tin; a man from Paris, his guardeen, called him- ry self so-guess it's right-" of  "Martini, did you say?" almost shrieked the lady, " did you say Martini?" "No, mum, I didn't. I said Martin." ";  "May you not be mistaken in the name?" !"  "What, mum? 'Ere's the book, an' it says it Martin; that's right, too-rll be bound. French- o man-parly-voo-said he come a' purpus to get d him; went away together in a hack, and that's all we know, mum." e  Madame Denoir bowed, and re-entered her L- carriage. She .was certain that Martini had e preceded her; she saw that the scoundrel was - resolved to secure and control Elmir, as a part t of his plan to vanquish her; and in a deeply - distressed condition, she returned again to her 1 hotel. Once more had the notary triumphed- once more had madame been defeated. Monsieur, the notary, suddenly missed the letter he had intercepted, and which it will be recollected found its way so mysteriously into the hands of Madame Denoir. He learned im- mediately afterwards that madame intended to visit London, and he knew what business called her there! He lost no time, therefore, in forestalling her arrival. The stranger who preceded her, in the steamer from Havre to London (already alluded to), was none other than Martini himself. He found Elmir, coined the story he had related to him, and finally induced him to leave the hospital, under his protection and guidance. Having established the youth as he had intimated he should do, he returned, forthwith, to France- for a brief period-having assured Elmir that he should see him again in a short time, and would provide him with another voyage, The boy was grateful-for he was totally ignorant of the deceit and chicanery which was being practised on him. He thanked Martini for his kindness, and promised to get well as fast as possible, in order to be ready once more to sail. The lady who would so gladly have served him, in his emergency, and who was so desirous to remove him at once from the trouble and snares with which he was surrounded, sought in vain for Elmir, in London! She could obtain no clue to his whereabouts, she could hear noth- ing farther regarding the movements of the no- tary, and, disappointed and chagrined, she at length took passage in the return steamer to Calais, and departed, but little wiser than when she arrived!   CHAPTER XII. ELMR FONBLANO AT SEA, AGAIN.   A MONTH elapsed after the events narrated in our last chapters, and Madame Denoir had reached Havre, Paris-and had proceeded on to Toulon. Not a line had she received from Flora, up to her return from London; and, though she had been actively engaged in other matters of importance to her, she had not overlooked the extraordinary fact that the mails brought her no intelligence from her favorite ward-who was usually so scrupulously attentive. Qn her arri- val in Toulon, her surprise was heightened, and her doubts-so far as Flora's continued love was concerned-were at once dispelled, when the sweet girl informed her that she had never heard a word from madame, from the hour she de- parted on her journey! It was plain that vil- lany had been at work with their correspond- ence-and the whole of their manifold letters had been intercepted. The agency madame did not doubt; but she was prudent-for the time being-indisposed as she was, just now, to bur- then the youthful heart of Flora with unneces- sary troubles. During the lapse of .this month mentioned, the notary had been unusually busy. He re- turned from Paris to London very soon after Madame Denoir reached France-for he kept himself constantly apprized of her movements and whereabouts-and having previously ma-   tured his present plans for Elmir's conduct and disposal, he waited upon him at once, and as- sured him that he found it very difficult to de- vote so much time to his case. "I have been to confer with Madame Denoir," he said, " since I saw you last; but she is in no better condition to aid you than when you wrote to her. She thinks that you had far better fol- low up the profession you have begun, than to attempt anything new at your age." "I reverence her opinion, monsieur, and con- sider her advice of the first importance. I am content-and will be a sailor, for her sake:" said Elmir, promptly. "I am glad of this, young man; I rejoice that you are disposed to accept of her counsel. In view of this-for, I confess that I supposed you would fall in with madame's suggestion-I have been looking about, among my numerous ac- quaintances, for a suitable opportunity for you: and have found a chance open, on board a trad- ing brig, where you may be installed at once, if you are so disposed, as second mate." "Thanks, thanks-my dear monsieur!" said Elmir, gratefully. "I accept it, with gratitude, I assure you." And, forthwith, the boy was placed on board a fine fruit brig, bound to the Mediterranean. The facts in connection with the discovery    <pb n="44-45" xml:id="VAC6847-00000021"/> of Elmir's letter to madame-which she came in possession of so mysteriously, at Havre-had been explained in brief terms, by the lady to Flora, and the letter itself had been shown her. But how that letter came to reach her lodgings, there, madame could not divine, by any mental ingenuity of her own. She guessed that Martini might possibly have handed it to the Harve attorney, temporarily, for some purpose-when they conferred together in reference to her case, which they evidently had done, she believed-and the latter persoBage might have taken it away with him, after their interview, for some object to her unknown. Having about his person, at the time he called upon madame at her lodgings in Havre, he might have dropped it, unintentionally, where it had been found by the servant. Still all this was but speculation-all, as yet, was mystery. The notary's agency and his treachery, in this affair, too, was pretty clear. He alone must have intercepted the letter, originally, at any rate; for it was forwarded by post to Paris, accord- ing to its address-and no one living, escept Martini (who had been so long known as her agent and friend, there), could have dared to re- ceive it-to say nothing of breaking its seal, and detaining it from its rightful owner. Of this then, both madame and Flora were satisfied The subsequent course of Martini, in repairing to the London hospital-for she knew well it was he who had abducted the boy from that place-was proof that he must be guilty of the other act. And, besides this, the very Contents of the let. ter itself showed clearly what the beginning of the intent of Martini was. He had deceived Elmir, and induced him to leave France under the villanously false supposition that Madame Denoir desired it! And, at the very moment that she had hoped to baffle the scoundrel's machinations, and at the same time undeceive poor Elmir, in regard to her actual feelings and hopes, the knave had succeeded in reaching London, and forestalling her there, too; had again drawn the innocent youth out of the reach of her protection, and away from the means she had instituted for explanation. The cruelty and r heartlessness of the cunning rogue was too appa- a rent to both ladies-and yet, at present, there i seemed to be but little chance to bring him to account! In the meantime, Elmir had sailed n again, from 'London. The brig on board of which Elmir found him- .   e self, proved a heavy sailer, and his duties, as d second officer of the vessel, he ascertained were o excessively arduous. But his natural good  courage did not desert him, and he strove to face !, his hard lot with that energy and determination 1 which had been a characteristic of his career thus far in life. e  The master of the brig was an old salt, and r the chief mate was rude, boisterous and illiterate. i He showed his men no mercy; and finding, very I soon after they sailed, that young Fonblane was his superior in talent, address, and seamanship- albeit he had never had half the experience of his senior officer-he became jealous of him; for the captain was sufficiently keen-witted and fully indolent enough, to avail himself of Elmir's good qualities-which he turned to his own ad- vancement and ease, whenever the opportunity presented ; which, by the way, as they proceeded 'upon their voyage, proved by no means seldom. With the exceptions, that naturally followed upon such a state of things, everything went well for some days after they left the coast of Great Britain. The Straits of Dover were quietly threaded, the brig crossed the English Channel, to the southward, under easy sail, and Point Penmach-the extreme westerly headland of France-was left far away to leeward, as the brig entered the bay of Biscay, and proceeded to the southward again upon her course towards the Mediterranean. Two days subsequently, a violent gale set in, from the northwest, and the brig drifted to the eastward and southward, rapidly, in spite of the best efforts of the officers to keep her away. On the third morning, land was in sight, over their lee, most unexpectedly, and the gale they had encountered three days before had not abated a jot in its ferocity. They had shortened sail forty- eight hours previously; and upon consulting their charts, they found themselves entirely off their course, still drifting to leeward, while a frightful shore of rocky land presented itself be- yond them-far as the eye could reach. The nearest point in view stretched quite out into the sea; and it proved to be the Cape de Penas, above Gijon-a fearful place to the expe- rienced mariner, on the deck even of a manage- able vessel! The brig was the reverse of this- in bad weather-and the heavy chopped sea, which fretted and roared beyond the high reefs, rendered their position most alarming, indeed. They managed to keep the vessel off shore, however, during the day-but night came on,   "n'1 wi'h ri ti, , l.'Ps : rn in,: f:.a e of the huri- arne, ",)d driv y (rp,o:, for iih ualuiky and At niij' h,.

Cu "Yet we do not know that he has again de- parted, madame."             m  "No-but it is more than likely. Monsieur hks not consummated his plans, yet-and God f grant that he never may! but he is busy, con- of tinually; and Elmir would be in the way. I do not doubt that he has found means to send him  away, again-for I cannot learn a word in Lon- ri don regarding him, save what we have ascer- sal tained through the cab-man who took them from the hospital. He avers that they were left at a ri sailor's boarding-house near the river; and thence so he has been shipped off, I do not doubt." ce "I trust he may prosper, and yet return to w us, madame," said Flora, archly, but earnestly. w "We may hope all things, Flora; bat the vi- c cissitudes of the sea are threatening, and unnum w bered! I would much like to know his where- 1 abouts, this night." "You tell me, madame, that you have known Elmir Fonblanc, almost from his birth i" s "Yes, Flora-and I have often thought I would tell you his history."       r "Pray tell it to me now, madame, if it please t you; I shall be very happy to hear it. You  know I am interested in all that concerns you,  and I know, as well, that you are deeply con-  cerned as to Elmir's fate." "And are there no other reasons, Flora, that induce this curiosity on your part?" asked ma- dame, with a perceivable smile. "I confess to you, madame-if I must-that from the hour when we first met, I have expe- rienced a deep concern in Elmir'sfate. You cannot have overlooked this fact, I am aware; and your knowledge of human nature, I feel confident, has many a time detected my secret- which can surely be no secret to you 1" "Secret!" exclaimed madame, pleasantly; "and has my charming Flora a secret, too-at sixteen years of age!" "No, madame-I answer no! For you have long since possessed yourself of it." "Of what, pray V" "A truce to banter, madame-and let me know the history of Elmir Fonblanc-whom yo blow I love, almost as well as I do yourself, said Flora, frankly. "Excellent! Upon my word, excellent- sweet one!" responded Madame Denoir, press- ing Flora to her breast. "I am rejoiced at your confession, though you are right in believing   that I already felt sure of your affection for him. But-listen, and you shall learn his story, briefly. "The portrait yonder, Flora," said madame, more earnestly, as she pointed to the picture of a handsome man upon the parlor panel, "is a faint resemblance of Monsieur Bouvais, of Paris, of whom you have often heard me speak." ".I remember, distinctly, madame. He was your friend, whom you visited for so long a pe- riod, at Paris; and who used to send me, you said, so many bon-bons, years ago." "Yes-yes. Well, he had a sister, who mar- ried an officer in the French army, and who some fifteen years ago, or more, suddenly de- ceased in Paris. Monsieur loved this lady, ) warmly, and her husband dying soon after she was taken away, he at once took charge of and - commenced to educate their only child-who  was thus left an orphan at a very tender age. This boy was Elmir-the family name was Fonblanc." n  "He was fortunate, madame, in thus finding so good a friend." I  "You speak truly, Flora-for Monsieur proved really a true friend to him. He provided for all ie his wants, placed him at the best school near u Paris, where he obtained an excellent education, u, and would have brought him into position in n- life, at an early age, had he lived to carry out his intentions; but monsieur died, as you are at aware, and I became the nominal guardian for La- Elmir."  "Yot, madame?" "at "I mean by this, that I assumed the care of )e- Elmir's fortune, for the time being; proposing, at ou the proper time, to choose a profession for him, re; and place him in a position to carve his own eel way to fortune. But a scoundrel interfered-in -  whom, up to that time, I had confided, as Mon- sieur Bouvais also had confided-and, who-for ly; purposes of his own, which I will one day ex- -at plain to you-induced the boy to leave France; thus overturning all my plans, and frustrating ave at the same time the hopes and prospects of Elmir himself. He holds a clue to the property of the youth-so he now avers-and he is aim- me ing to control it, permanently. This it is, that you has shown him the villain we have proved him lf," to be-for you must be aware to whom I allude." "Martini, madame!" it-  "Yes, Flora. He it is who has crossed our ress- path, and he it is who has made us all the trou- your ble we have yet experienced." ving  "But why not avoid him, madame '"   "  Ah, whj? You must know the rest, Flora, at a future time. But not now, love. Suffice S it-Martini declres that a codicil exists to mon- i sieur's will, in favor of this boy, and that he claims (under the uncle's legal appointment be- 1 fore he died) to be his guardian proper. Thus t he keeps the boy away from me, fearing that I 1 shall attempt to control him in the disposal of N that property (of which I now hold nominal possession-the estate being left to me, subject to this codiciD, and thus displace his author- ity." "But is there no means of compromise?" "No!" said madame, sharply; "no, Flora- none, that I will accede to. While Martini can keep Elmir away from me, he can threaten me; and, it may. be, finding himself baffled in the consummation of another scheme which he has undertaken, he will so arrange matters with Elmir (the boy consenting, in his innocence), that he will continue to control his estate, dupe him, as he would me, and eventually possess the extended means which of right belong to Elmir, but of which he is now entirely ignorant."   "And what is this alternative of which you speak, madame  This existing compromise that may be ." "Not now, Flora-some other time you shall know all that I know; for the present, be con- tent with what I have explained to you. It is my desire that you continue to esteem the youth we have now spoken of. He may return to us; we may meet him, before it is too late. If I can confer with him ere he shall have agreed to any proposition from Martini-who is cunning enough to place Elmir in a position, at his ma- jority, from which he never could retreat-I shall be fortunate, and you will be made happy. But who oan say what is in store for us in the future ." The conversation ended-the two ladies sat in deep thought-and at last they separated for the night. The shipwrecked mariners toiled on, over the locky waste before them-but aid was, at length, at hand I    <pb n="48-49" xml:id="VAC6847-00000023"/> ImTtr,.niIIsIl This man was Andreac M.. uni, thea Parisian nnotarv  He cultivated his friiendship, an intimacy grew  between them  (for men-it-ur tever kncw his rival, as you are aware), and timeo    <pb n="50-51" xml:id="VAC6847-00000024"/> passed on, again. The notary knew his secret, however, and the secret of Marie Dencir; but his hour for avenging himself had not yet come! When monsieur had made him his confidante, at last, he availed himself of the opportunity to make a beginning; and finally, the will of the. old man was made, and after this, a codicil- Martini was created his legal attorney and agent, and the future guardian to his legatees. He died. This wealthy Bouvais died, soon after executing these important documents, and his last will and testament showed that Marie Denoir was his only legatee. So far-well! Shall I repeat to you, Marie, what followed?" "Tell me, monsieur, I entreat you, what is the price of your continued silence, and your eternal absence from my roof, henceforth!" "Shall I repeat to you, Marie, that you never loved monsieur? That you married his wealth, not him? That you have expended his fortune most recklessly? That your besetting sin is a love of display and extravagant luxury? That your early associations were the fatal cause of this disposition, and that you have no standard of value for money? Shall I remind you how the once indigent Martini appealed to you, after monsieur's decease, and prayed for your hand, again? Or how you again scouted his appeal, and scorned to smile upon his suit? Shall I tell you, Marie Denoir," continued the notary, as his very soul seemed to be leaping out of his- sparkling black eye, amid his excitement, " shall   I tell you now,for the last time, that it is not too late, that you may yet redeem yourself from the false step you would so madly take, that I love you, yet-and that the price of my favor is but the bestowal of your hand in marriage? "Shall I assure you here, once more, as I now do at your very feet (and the knave sunk upon his knee, at madame's side), that but one being on earth ever yet commanded my affections, and that being is Marie Denoir! That I would, and will be, silent-with this, and this only-" "No more, no more, monsieur!" screamed madame, starting wildly to her feet, aid spurn- ing the miscreant as she moved. "U p, and de- part! My resolution is taken-up, I say,' and leave me!" "Madame!" "Never, monsieur, will I listen to such a pro- posal." "Reflect, Marie!" "I have-I am resolved. My fortune may be within your power, but my hand is my own. Go, then-do your worst! I defy you. You cannot conquer the will of Marie Denoir! Y(  may persecute her, bruise her, crush her-but you cannot vanquish her pride of spirit. Go! Complete your cursed work-do what you will- I will never be your wife, so help me God!" As madame strode from the room, amid her frenzy, the attorney arose, and with the words "You will repent, Marie Denoir!" departed at once from the mansion!   CHAPTER XV. THE NOTARY MEEES FONBLANC, AND ONCE MORE DECEIVES HM.   WHEN monsieur, the notary, reached home, he repaired at once to his private room, in Paris, t where the first thing that attracted his notice r was a "private" letter, which he discovered  lying upon his desk. It was posted at Havre; and he quickly opened it, to read as follows: "MONSIEUR :-Agreeably with your request to be watchful, we have omitted the employment of no means to discover the whereabouts of your young friend Fonblanc, in whose late you have taken so deep an interest; and we now have the pleasure to inform you that he called, to-day, upon the owners of the brig in which he sailed from France, on his first voyage-which vessel, you will remember, was lost. "The young man arrived at Havre early this morning, and contemplated leaving town, di- rectly, for Paris; but, at your suggestion, after communicating with him-as we did an hour ago--we have prevailed upon him to tarry here, a day or two, since we find that you enjoined it upon P-- to detain him here (should he first make his appearance in this place) until we should hear from you. "Have you seen him, since his return? Shall we adopt any further steps in the premises? Or, will you write us-at once-how we may other- wise serve you? Your reply will be promptly attended to.  Faithfully yours, S. &amp; W."   This document was marked " post haste," and the notary smiled, again and again, as he hur- riedly disposed of the letter, and darted out of his office. In half an hour he sat in a vehicle drawn by two slashing roadsters, and was en route for Havre! He saw, at once, the necessity of his immediate appearance, in person, at Havre; and he lost no time in making his way there. Elmir Fonblanc, after sundry mishaps and delays, had found a vessel bound to France, in which he gladly embarked; and, as had been stated by the spies of Martini, he reached Havre finally in safety-but so worn out with sickness, wounds, and hardships, that a very material change was evident in his personal appearance. However, his health was good. Though he had really grown a good deal older since he left home, and though his skin was deeply embrowned by the exposure to which he had been subjected, he nevertheless was a manly and stout looking fel- low-as courageous and as energetic as ever. A few weeks of comfort and leisure would re- cuperate his system, entirely; and he longed to see madame, and Flora, and tell over the story of his experience and his troubles.  / The parties he met at Havre, however, had been advised of the probable course the young man would pursue, on arriving there, and his plans were all forestalled by the cunning and manoeuvring of Martini-who kx6w the conse ',A    <pb n="52-53" xml:id="VAC6847-00000025"/>
               <pb n="54-55" xml:id="VAC6847-00000026"/> CHAPTER XVI. THE CONFERENCE BETWEEN ELM!R AND 'IIn CRIPPLE.   As soon as they were seated in the little ar art- ment which we must remember as th3 room Li which Madame Denoir had once conli ,rt d with the same queer individual who now c atertained Elmir Fonbianc, the eccentric cripple immedi- ately undertook to explain himself. "( You may think it singular," squ 3aked I e- mnoine, "that I should have presumed to al' .i l to, or meddle, perhaps, in an aflair which so intimately concerns only yourself, Monsieur lonblanc. But we gentlemen of the green bE g sometimes come into the possession of the sc- c:ets of others, by means of our business trans- aztions with third parties, and we thus make ont s3lves acquainted occasionally with detail- ot iuterest to persons whom we might not othcr- w lse ever think about. Your case is like ths ; and our present interview follows upon circa n- stances which have transpired in the cours3 of my experience, similar to those to which I have now alluded. You tell me you are acquainted with Ma'amoisello Flora?" "I have met her, monsieur." "Your pardon, then. Havo you any fancy for her?" "That is a queer question!" said Elmir, slowly. "I know it is! Many queerer things than the asking of, or the answering that question, may occur to you, in life, monsieur."   "Very likely," said Elmir. "But do you not expect, before you get your reply, that you must first tell me why-or by what authouiiy-you thus query me?" "No, monsieur! Professionally, I put the in- terrogation, if you please. Will that do?" "No-no." "You must be candid, monsieur Fonblanc, or all that I know and purposed to communicate to you must be withheld. I therefore assume, to gratify you-that you do entertain a passion for the lady in question." "Very well, monsieur. Grant it-what fol- lows?" "Good, good-young man. She is rich, you know." "So I have heard." "She is called the 'heiress of Toulon,' de- servedly. I know, monsieur, that she has in her own right, a very large property." "And what of that?" "Nothing, monsieur; if you do not value such a matter but, under ordinary circumstan- ces, such a consideration is by no means an in- different affair to most people situated as I find  you are in relation to ma'amoiselle." "Proceed, monsieur. Upon my word, you are getting interesting in your account!" "I should think so, Monsieur Fonblanc. She   is. young, and beautiful, and good, and rich- rich, monsieur." "So you have said." "And you may wed her!" "Me I Come, monsieur, this is all very fine talk. You say I may have this paragon of beauty and goodness. What right have you to dispose of her, thus, I pray?" "I say you may wed her-if you will." "Indted! Are there no conditions i" "O yes, monsieur." "So I thought. What are they t" "Very simple, as you shall see. Now, what do you say to sharing with the party who shall cause her to marry you, one half of your for- tune?" "This is modest, to be sure!" "You comprehend me, of course?" "O, yes; you want half the lady's estate." "No, I don't. So you perceive that you are by far too sharp, and you do not understand me, at all!" "What then, monsieur?" "Listen, and I will explain," said the attorney, righting himself in his low chair. And then, as if a thought had just struck him, he added: "But first, tell me if you agree to the proposal I just now mentioned, namely; will you make over, by bond, to the person who shall bring about your union with the lady in question, one half your fortune?" "Mq/ fortune?" "Your own estate." "Yes, monsieur-the whole of it, for that mat- ter! Parbleu  I have not a louis d'or in the world! Ha, ha!" "That is neither here nor there. Will you sign a bond to this effect?" said the attorney; and he quickly scrawled a document, as follows, which he handed to Elmir to peruse: "I, Elnir Fonblanc, of Paris, Department of thd Seine, &amp;c., &amp;c., in consideration of the love I bear to -- -- , and for other good and valuable considerations, which I do hereby ac- knowledge, &amp;c., &amp;c., do, by these presents, give, grant, bargain, assign, and forever transfer to the-said -  -  all and singular, my right, title, and interest, of whatsoever name or na- ture, which I now possess, or which by right belongs to, or which may hereafter accrue to me, by virtue of any deed, will, conveyance, or in- strument whatever, now existing, in this, my native land-to his use and behoof, and the use   and behoof of his heirs, assigns, or administra- tors, &amp;c., &amp;c., from this time forth, &amp;c., &amp;c." "Will you," repeated the attorney, " sign such a document as that 1" Elmir looked at this paper, and, much to the evident surprise of the attorney, he said: "No, monsieur, I will not!" and, as he pro- nounced these words in a firm tone, a pallor crossed his features, as if he had received a death stroke! "What is the matter, Elmir-Fonblanc- monsieur, I should have said?" stammered the attorney, not a little alarmed at the young man's appearance. "Nothing-nothing. Go on-a thought, only -the room is warm," continued Elmir, growing still paler as he spoke; " some water, monsieur! Open the door-quick!" and, reeling from his chair, the poor sailor fell heavily to the floor, upon his face  All this had not been counted upon by the eccentric attorney, and he sprang forward in- stantly to his relief. In his fall his head was bruised, and the blood flowed freely from his mouth. The attorney quickly obtained some water, dashed it into his face, bathed his temples, chafed his wrists-but all to no purpose! He could not restore him! The boy sunk to the floor, the blood ceased to flow, and no sign of pulsation was apparent. What was to be done? - Here was a dilemma! Was he dead? He was-at least in Lemoine's opinion; and he was there alone with him! Again he essayed to resuscitate him; .but all his efforts were unavailing, What had caused this mysterious accident! How could he ex- plain it He would be discovered there, with him, and he would be arrested as his murderer! "Elmir-Fonblanc! Elnir!" he shrieked, in his fear and agony-but no answer came. "M on Dieu " he cried, "what shall I do with the body?"Then, turning to his desk, he un- locked it quickly, drew forth a small travelling case, and taking therefrom a lancet, he applied the blade to the sufferer's arm. Almost immediately the youth began to re- vive; and, a moment afterwards, the cripple raised him up, and placedhim in his chair again. In the midst of this exciting scene, the attor- ney's hat had fallen off, and he had removed his goggle from his eyes, unwittingly, in his terror. When Elmir' opened his eyes, he found the hitherto cripple, who had supported himself with a crutch, and who had been bent almost to the    <pb n="56-57" xml:id="VAC6847-00000027"/>
               <pb n="58-59" xml:id="VAC6847-00000028"/> vigoyusly; and his eye was fiequently tnaed towards his desk, where the little box still stood -his small travelling case-from which he had hastily taken his lancet, a few moments before, and which interested him very deeply. But Elmir would not release him-and finally ob- serving his anxiety, he traned his own eye to- wards the desk, suspiciously. The lid of the case was open, and Elmir ob- served a packet of letters tied up there. While he still held the villain at bay, he moved toward the box, raised the parcel-notwithstanding the desperate efforts of Martini to free himself from his grasp-and raising the package, he found a part of them addressed to Madame Marie De- noir-and others to Mademoiselle Flora Del- mont! How came those letters there? thought El- mir, instantly. What was the correspondence of madame and Flora doing in Martini's pos- session? It at once occurred to him that here was more foul play! "What are these, monsieur?" he asked, im- peratively. "No-no-nothing. Release me! Elmir- don't you-touch--touch my property. You're a robber, a robber, mind! if you do. I'll call the guard-I'll put you in prison--you shan't. Hold! I say, and release me!" shrieked the lato cripple; and with a violent wrench, he disen- gaged himself from Elmir's clutch, and sprang wildly, madly forward, to close the box. By this time, however, Elmir had become thoroughly suspicious, and he determined in his own mind that he would know the worst of this business. He rushed to the desk, therefore, at the same moment that Martini escaped, and before the rascal could prevent it, he possessed himself of the bundle of letters. The fury and rage of the notary was now un- bounded! He saw that his crime would thus be discovered; he saw that the great scheme of his life would be frustrated; he saw that if he did not recover those papersAill was lost and he sprang upon Elmir with the fury of a tiger. "Give them back!" he shouted; "robber, in- grate, thief! Give me back my property. What, ho! Guard, guard! Help, help, help!" he continued screaming, at the top of his lungs. His cries quickly brought relief. The police of that arrondizement were always awake! And a moment afterwards, a loud knocking was heard at the outer door. "Open, open-in the name of the king!" said   a rough voice, without. And following this de- mand (as the door was locked on the inside), a loud crash was heard--and immediately after- wards two policomen rushed in. All this was the work of but a moment; and Martini, aware of the consequence of his move- ments and appcarance, under the circumstances, at once resumed his disguise! When the two officers entered, therefore, they foun d a poor cripple there, who squeaked out his complaint, in miserable accents, and who informed the offi- cials, apparently as well as he was able to do after the abuse that he had experienced, that he was a victim-that the young man was nnknown to him-that he came slily in at his door, and while he was in the act of opening his little box, had pounced upon him, seized a package of sup- posed value, and would have undoubtedly mur- dered him, but for their providential interference! This looked probable enough, and 'Elmir was instantly seized upon by the two guardsmen, and quickly manacled. No explanation was necessary, none would be entertained; and Elmir was quickly borne out of the apartment, and thence to the nearest station-house-in spite of his declarations that the complainant was an impostor and a villain. The doors closed again, Monsieur Lemoine (as he was known, in Havre) engaged to appear against the culprit in the morning, and Elmir Fonblane was that night the inmate of a prison-room, despite his protes- tations of innocence, and his repeated assertions that he was Martini's victim. "I always said," remarked the knave, quietly, as the prisoner departed in custody of the guard, t "I always said that boy was too fast; we shall I EQe!"The officcrs had taken possession of the p parcel of letters which the attorney (as he was called) charged him with endeavoring to pur- loin, to be used in the case, when Elmir was to 3 be examined. Martini did not reflect upon the s consequences which would follow this move- I ment. He concluded that as the youth had no a friends, was unknown, and had been caught seemingly in the very act, it would he no difficult - matter for Lemoine, the attorney of the Rue de ;, la Platte, to convict him of attempted robbery. e A residence for a while in La Force, or the Bastile, Martini thought would correct the no- e tions of the boy, perhaps, in regard to some mat- d ters which he dcsired to have done in his own d way I Elmir did not offer any resistance. He saw d that he was in a dilemma, unfortunately, and   now entirely at the mercy of Martini-who, if he were bad enough to steal those letters (of which fact Fonblanc entertained not the slightest doubt), if he were wicked enough to disguise himself, and steal, and cheat and lie as he had seen him do-he was bad enough to commit any act for the furtherance of his objects-what- ever they might be. Elmir had, as yet, no possible idea why all these things had occurred; nor could he by any   means divine the cause of Martini's treatment and dissembling. But he was a prisoner-his assertions were of no avail-his testimony could not be received, in his own favor-and he was confined for the night, to undergo an examina- tion before the commissary next day. In the meantime, Martin prepared his com- plaint, fully, and was otherwise busy, as we shal very soon discover I   CHAPTER XVIII. MADAME AND FLORA AT TOULON.   MADAMS DEsZOIE returned to Toulon-as we have already stated-disappointed, chagrined at her ill success, and with deep regret that she had been unable to find her young friend. Months had now passed away since she last saw Martini, too, and she queried what could he the cause of his long continued silence. He had threatened her, at their last interview, and he had awaited upon her, at her own residence "for the last time!"But she awaited, patiently, the opening of the next scene in the drama of her life. Flora Delmont was advancing to womanhood. In this fair being were impersonated all the graces and the virtues which adorn and render the sex worthy of being beloved. She knew little of madame's troubles, for the latter had considerately kept her ignorant either of their cause, or the effect they produced upon her, in any way. They continued to live on, at their ease, amid splendor and affluence-and the only drawhack to the happiness of either, was the uncertainty which had attended the fate of Elmir Fonblanc, whom they were both-from very dif ferent motives-so desirous once more to meet. In the interim, the boy had passed through mis- ery of which they had no conception, and he now  lay in prison, at Havre, awaiting his trial for assault and attempted robbery! I As soon as the disguised Martini-who was  now utterly reckless of consequences-had had I leisure to reflect a little upon the course he ought i to adopt, under present circumstances, he fully ( prepared himself to proceed against Elmir, and c determined to preserve his incognita, at Havre, g   s for the purpose of convicting him. This would d give him time to mature his original scheme, if e it were possible to complete it, at all-and he I. resolved to be known only as Lemoine, the V attorney. 3  Resuming his dress and crutch, and affected I decrepitude, therefore, he sallied forth, and ap- e peared against the youth, before. the primary , court; as may be supposed, the prisoner not , being allowed to speak in his own defence, and f having no witnesses to sustain his explanations, even could he have made them, he was very quickly disposed of, upon the evidence of his accuser-who charged him with having broken into his office, and committed an assault upon him with the implied intent of robbery or mur- der, or both Elmir was sent to prison, for the time being, and the following account of the affair appeared in the journals, next day: " BOLD FEAT.-One Elmir Fonblanc, a citi- zen of Paris, formerly, and just now a returned sailor to this port, broke into the office of M. Lemoine, attorney, 54 Rue do la Platte, night before last, and while monsieur was in the act of arranging some papers and letters in a little travelling case he uses, the burglar sprang upon him, undoubtedly in the hope of obtaining money or valuables, and a sharp rencontre succeeded. Monsieur called the guard, the thief was secured, and monsieur appeared at the office of the com- missaire, yesterday, to identify and prosecute him. The prisoner looked like anything but a malicious or evil-disposed person--but the proof is clear against him, and he has been sent into confinement to await his trial. The penalty for this class of offence is severe; and, for the sake of the youth himself, who really appeared to very good advantage, notwithstanding the serious    <pb n="60-61" xml:id="VAC6847-00000029"/>   "iA11APERi XIX., TYA "GUARDImUl" 0r! ELM R PONISLA.110.   FOILED in his bold bat ill-advised attempt to secure an influence over Elmir, by means of the offer made the youth of Flora's hand in marriage -the notary now turned to other resources to carry out his object. He had never yet promul- gated his authority as gueardian, at least to Elmir: for he had got along without this; and the young man had no idea of the relation in which Martini' actually stood towards him. The time had now arrived, when he was to be enlightened. He had been in prison two days, when, for the first time since his incarceration, his attendant spoke, and informed him that a friend was in waiting below, to confer with him; a proposition . he very quickly and gladly entertained. Who  it might be, he had no idea; but his doubts and speculations were very soon dispelled, as the door opened, and closed again, behind the form of Martini, the notary, from Paris!  As if nothing at all had transpired, monsieur advanced, and stretched forth his hand to the prisoner-calm, friendly, stoical, cool, as was his usual wont! There was the same cold gray  eye, the same well made form, theidentical dress of Martini-such as he had met him in, before-. and no shade of emotion of guilt, on his part, . evinced itself to the astounded gaze of Elmir Fonblanc l Elmir began to think he had dreamed some 5   I horrible dream-that he had committed somai singularly fearful error-that he was the victim of some terrible illusion, or other-or that hi bj rain had been turned; and he was at a loss for words, for a time. "I hope you are very well, Elmir," said the knave, slowly and kindly. It was the voice that Elmir had heard a hun. dred times before-the same form stood before ' him-the same face now confronted him! There was no decrepitude, no goggles, no stooping, no crutch, no squeaking tone of speech-no Lemoine there;, it was Martini, the notary; and Elmir ; could not fathom this. "I hope you are well, Elmir," repeated the ' villain; "and I am sorry to hear that you are in trouble, aid grieved to find you here" "Am I not Elmir Fonblanc, monsieur V1 asked the prisoner, almost mad with his emotions. , "I think you are; but I shame to meet you in this place." t . "Are you not Martini, the notary t" Yessyes--" "And Lemoine, the attorney 1" "What!" exclaimed the scoundrel, " what did you say, Elmir n" "You are Lemoine, I say! You are the knave who stole the letters, who induced me to fly from France, who falsely accused me of at- tempting your life-"    <pb n="62-63" xml:id="VAC6847-00000030"/> "-'siL! Zmir;- you must not get excited Villain, monster, tell me why am I thus par- j eued and persecuted?" "You must be calm and respectful, Elmir, or my visit hither must quickly terminate. I come tc you from your friends, Madame Denoir and Flora--" "Liar! Monstrous liar that you are!" shouted Elmir, unable to control his feelings, longer;! '- you can have no claim, no mission from purity, and virtue, and innocence. You have deceived tioem, you have duped me I Your cursed crime is being exposed! The letters found in your possession will prove my innocence, and convict you of theft, of malfeasance, and of trespass. I have sent to Paris-to Toulon-for Madame Ienoir! You have lied and imposed upon me, and your turn will soon come, be sure of it!" ' Elmir--are you mad?"' 'Yes, monsieur!  Mad-distressed beyond endurance-well nigh crushed into thi earth-- destroyed-through your infernal machinations and trickery! And for what? Tell us, mon- sieur, if you cean, for what am I thus crippled and maltreated?" "I do not comprehend you, Elmir,' responded I Martini, rising from the bench upon which he i had been seated. "You seem determined to go to destruction, and all my earnest efforts to aid  and save you, I see, are of no avail.': "You, and you alone, have brought me to this degradation, monsieur; but my revenge is cer .' tain, in the future." "You may even now escape. unharmed, El-.  nit.--through my influence. Lesnoine, the at-' tormey, is my friend-I know him well," con- i tinned the wretch, in a lower tone; "and I will! influence him not to appear against you, if vou I  will quit France immnediately on year liberation I from prison."               1 "Leave me-monsieur!" cried Elmir, starting  UtI wildly, and menacing his visitor with per- d sonal violence: " leave me, ere I dash out your brains!" "4Elmir-Elmir! What,--"  "Leave me, I insist! I accept nothing at I i your bands, I desire to have nothing more to do i with so miserable and vile a wretch. Do your i u worst-but quit this cell; and quickly, if you  desire to do so alive! '         , Martini did not hesitate longer. He was I passed out by the turnkey, and with a brief re- t unate that the prisoner was evidertly insane. and i    idangerous, he departed. His first movernM ; ; subsequently, was to prevent Madame DI-sr from meeting Elmir. He learned that the young man had cmpa7,iys, a messenger (with what means he happen-si 'o be possessed of) to proceed to Paris; and, , -. ing to find madame there, to go on to Touikla, and inform her of his peril and distress--in the hope that she would send him  aid; and., ae least, if able, that she would appear to claim ?it letters. He had had an opportunity to see ,thaun -since his arrest-upon his own representarivni. finally; and he saw that they must have b*,.O intercepted-from their contentents-.whichha 1h! examined. Martir:i saw how matters had tnr: :., and he knew the importaance of preventintg .:. ' dame's arrival at Havre, if possible; for he jai. from the first, represented himself as her Pa ibLsra agent. The mrsescncer reached  Paris-proccl - -s thence to Toulon-but missed madame in ,x/ places; she having left the latter pl ce for f:ra nnorth, on the day prior to his axrnvaL. H s r.:r was of no avail, therefore, exrcept to disposo 'r every franc that poor Elmir Fonblace posses3-sd -and he ret:rined to his sta:ting place, with.*i.. having seen or communicated with maflam',:: ar-y way! Nevertheless. :ho cnrly friend of Elai-, . company with Flora, pnshcd forwara T to the s'.- tal; and having taken tesmpnrary i cn:fings, s.. spatched her servant to seek mrsieur, th t.,i- tary-with whom 'she now desired a Ti immadic-Va interview.

Martini scarcely knew what course, exCs:t':i' to adopt. rnder the circumstances. If ha li1l not respond to the invitation, suspicion of his double dealing might be strengthenod ; if he Eid, he would have the opportunity to push his '3- vorite scheme, with madame, once more-  on the whole, he deemed it a fortunate tima =, do so, and to bring the matter to a final issue, .:. some way. He therefore determined to tv-a:; upon madame, without further delay. The public allusion to certain letters founI ;.;%: Martini's private travelling case, was not .i s sight of by madame; who directly .suspost, i that they belonged to her and to Flora, aai were without doubt their intercepted ccrrespo alSt   ence. She therefore had a long account to ad- just with monsieur; and, much as she dreaded the meeting, she resolved upon a full exposition with the knave who had so annoyed her, and who was now, in a degree, in her power, she believed. Martini entertained no fears, however, pro- vided he could detain madame from seeing the prisoner. The trial would soon come off, and the boy would be placed out of reach of aid,   -4 within a week, unless he effected the consumma- tion of his original plan! Such was his deter- mination at any rate, when he started forth from his office, to wait upon Madame Denoir. In our succeeding chapters, we shall give the result of this important interview, and unravel the chain of mystery which envelopes our plot. The scene which followed-between madame and the notary-will explain much that has thus far appeared intricate and extraordinary.   CHAPTER XX     .  MAiBtTtINZI I cONsrLENSCu Ewuss massI OvCa sCstORa. ssxR FERx PTrOItv CO2DUCcr.   ONLY a practised villain-one who was well versed in the subtleness and trickery of genuine diplomacy and intrigue-could have appeared as Monsieur Martini did,.when he was ushered I into the presence of his intended victim, on the i evening alluded to in our last chapter. He had prepared himself for what he had supposed was to come,'and he' believed himself " armed at all points " against the attacks or the resist- ance of Madame Denoir. On the present occasion, he was dressed in faultless style, and he appeared to very good advantage-for him. He entered the drawing- room (where were seated madame and Flora) ,with a firm step and unchanging countenance, and as he withdrew his tightly fitting glove from his small white hand, he bade the ladies good evening in the coolest and most plausible manner possible-in the same friendly tone, and with that same assumed superiority of character and address which had ever marked his inter- course with madame and her protege. He was received by the ladies with a cold and formal politeness--which, though he did not seem to observe, he could not avoid noticing. "Since we met, madame," observed Martipi, at once, "I trust you have been well, and that your ward, Ma'amoiselle ,ora, has also enjoyed good health." Madame merely bowed to this empty expres- sion of compliment, and said, immediately, "I sent for yoo, monsieur; this evening. upon press- ing business."   "I shall be proud to serve Madame Denoir to the extreme of my abilities," said the knave, politely. "The service I have to crave at your hands to night is trivial, monsieur; but I desire, if you shall deem it proper to answer me at all, that you will tell me the truth-if you can." This was a sharp and sudden reproof, which the notary did not exactly anticipate-but he was well fortified, and he did not appear to no- tice the insinuation contained in this remark, but answered, calmly: "Will madame command me?" "Tell me, monsieur--where is Elmir You- blanc?' This query, so suddenly propounded, and in a manner so peculiarly expressive-for madamne possessed the power to be "pointed in speech," when she so desired-emphatically staggered , the notary; and he sard, at once: "I do not know, madame. That is--" "Do not equivocate, monsieur," responded the lady, warmly. "If I am not mistaken, you do know, and yon have had an agency, in some  way, in his present trouble I' I' Trodi, madame! What trouble V " Answer me, first, upon your honor-if there b he left in your composition any spark of that commodity, which may now well be questioned --answer me, honestly, do you not know where is Elmir Fonblanc?" "Upon my honor, then- madame, I know nothing but what I have just now casuallyheart,    <pb n="64-65" xml:id="VAC6847-00000031"/> and of which, you yourself, I thiak, must be advised." "Elmir Fonblanc is in a filthy dungeon, mon- gieur-in Havre!" said madame, with chilling emphasis. "I learned that he was in prison, but a few hours since," continued Martini, "and I but await your orders, madame, to do all in my power for his relief-and at once." "You will be spared any further trouble in ref- erence to Elmir's fate, monsieur," said the lady, "and I sent for you, only, to ask if you were acquainted with one Lemoine, attorney-at ,.avre "  "Yes, madame-I have the honor of that -genfieman's acquaintance; and it was through him that I just now learned of the young man's position. It seems that the boy returned from se, a few days since, and being probably desti- tute of friends, and reckless perhaps, of conse- quences, he forced himself into Lemoine's office and attempted to rob his premises-" "I don't believe it!"' exclaimed Flora, loudly, at this juncture. "Nor I, monsieur," added the lady. "Neither do yiz believe it," chimed in the  young lady, nervously, turning again to Martini. "You do not believe so foul an accusation, ,urely!' "We cannot tell, ladies. It is a long way  lhnce to Havrc, and who knows but Elmir may  have been tempted, or driven perhaps, to this painful shift, in his emergency i" "I am on my way from Toulon, monsieur,"  said Madame Denoir, "to Havre.  In a few hours, all will be explained to mny satisfaction, I am sure. I trust that you will be fortunate ,enough to be as well pleased with the result of  this affdir, as we shall be." "What, madame!" exclaimed the notary, not a little alarmed at this precipitancy, " that is- I mean-when do you go to Havre?" "To-night, monsieur-this very night. I am now awaiting the arrival of a post-coach, ordered at nine this evening. We shall proceed with  all possible despatch to Havre; and to-morrow, if we are alive, we will know from Elmir's own lips the real state of this most extraordinary case. In the meantime," continued the lady, triumphantly, turning to a table near her, and presenting to the notary a large old-fashioned Bible, which was open at a particular place in the "Family Record," and to which she pointed rnostly--" read that, monsieur, and that, and   , that!" and she tossed upon the ancient and well-worn page before him a sheet of parchment, and then another, to the very great astonishmeut and discomfiture of Monsieur Martini, notary, of Paris! He hastily scanned the contents of the two documents, and then his eye ran quickly over the " records" in the old Bible. And then the wily notary-who had hitherto been unmanaged and unmanageable-asked: "What is this? What are these, madame ." "Do not the records and the parchments ex- plain themselves, monsieur?" queried the lady, coolly and triumphantly. "Is not monsieur sufficiently acquainted with such matters to comprehend the import of such precious missives as these?" "But-madame-" "Surely, monsieur the notary is lawyer enough to appreciate those papers! And may not Marie Dcnoir, and her child, now stand firmly upon their legal rights? Read again, monsieur, and answer me!" "They are forgeries! Base, damnable cheats  I will arrest-I will force you to the proof-" "You may do so, monsieur-and if you dar' to attempt it, try it! Mark me, Martini-you have deceived us, harassed us, persecuted me and mine-long enough; and there is a terrible account for you to adjust, when I have the leis- ure to call you to do so! Prepare for the trial, then, and fortify yourself a; best you may-for, as you now live, so surely must you answer for the guilt and trickery you have imposed upon us during the few past years of your wicked life.' Madame-you are personal." "So do I mean it. The diligence is at the portal. I am summoned away, for the time being, and I leave you to reflect upon the past, and to prepare for the future. Believe me, mon- sieur, I do not jest. You have most villanously abused your station and your power, and the hour of retribution is at hand!" "Hear me, Marie Denoir!" "Not a word further, monsieur, at present. I shall return to Paris, in one week from to-day. Till then, adieu!" And with these final words, the lady secured the two parchments and the Bible, and retired from the apartment without further ceremony. Martini, astounded and chagrined-astounded at the information he had so suddenly and so unexpectedly obtained, and chagrined at the rprospect of being utterly and irredeemably van-   quished, by the woman he had so long believed to be completely in his power-staggered out of the robm, through the great hall, into the street -almost before he was aware of his own move- ments 1 In a few minutes afterward, Madame Denoir, with Flora Delmont at her side, took a seat in the carriage which awaited them, and theywere quickly driven away to the north; while mon- sieur hurried to fis office to reflect upon the di- lemma he found himself placed in, and to at- tempt a counter movement for his defence.   "He is guilty," said Flora; " plainly, a guilty man." "There can be no doubt of it, dear Flora," responded madame, "and we shall soon know how much our poor Elmir has suffered through his chicanery." The vehicle rolled rapidly along-monsieur had ensconced himself in his favorite room, in deep distress and alarm; and we will now ex- plain the character of the evidence which had so suddenly turned up against that accomplished rogue.    <pb n="66-67" xml:id="VAC6847-00000032"/> CHAPTER XXI. THE OLD BIBLE, WTICH SLMR INTENDED TO CONSULT, B[T WHCH HE NEOLEC TSED   WHEN Elmir Fonblanc retired from the man- sion of Monsieur Bouvais, at the time he first learned of his demise, it will be recollected that he took with him simply the old Bible spoken of as his portion of his deceased uncle's fortune. Such was the declaration in monsieur's will- and he returned to school, under the advice and promised protection of Madame Denoir-who assumed to take the place of monsieur, in El- mir's behalf, for the time being. The boy was content, under the circumstances; and he promised himself the pleasure, in the future, of consulting the good book thus left him-at his leisure. But, immediately after his  return, it will also be remembered that his atten- tion was taken up with other matters, and his good resolution was neglected. He laid the volume aside, and never examined it. When he left France upon his first voyage, he forwarded the Bible with some other trifles (as he deemed them) to madame's care; and, up to within the week previos to the interview just described, all had remained undisturbed in madame's pos- session. ' When the account reached Toulon that Elmir was imprisoned, the lady for the first time since the youth's absence thought proper to examine the effects he had deposited with her. It might have been from mere womanish curiosity, or   other causes .might have prompted her to open the little box which contained the articles Elmir had forwarded to her care; but the result of her examination vras far more than merely satisfac- tory-it was triumphant, indeed! Upon opening the ancient Bible, she discov- ered a curiously made pocket in the cover, in- serted below the edge of the volume, with its mouth towards the back of the book. And when she raised the side of this compartment, she found therein two small pieces of parchment, addressed to "Elmir Fonblanc, Paris," in the handwriting of Monsieur Bouvais, the former proprietor of the "Place Vandean." The discovery of these papers was the more unexpected because madame had never heard Elmir speak of having any such documents in his possession; but she was not aware that the youth had laid away his Bible, upon his return to school (after monsieur's decease), or the fact, that, in consequence of this neglect, the boy had never seen those missives, or even suspected that they were in existence I This circumstance did not affect their importance, however-as we shall shortly see. And Madame Denoir resolved to make the most of this orunate and singu- larly well-timed discovery. Very greatly to the surprise and joy of both madame and Flora, therefore-and as greatly to   tic zstonisiment and chagrin of the scoundrel Mier i-these papers proved to be, first, an un-  ceoditional power of attorney to Marie Denoir, for the management of the interest during El- mire minority, and secondly, a brief codicil to his original will (bearing date but three days before his death), bequeathing to Elmir Fon- blanc and Flora Delmont his whole vast estate! These cut off the authority of the notary, of coure, and placed the property and its manage- sint in their rightful places. Ba: why was this done? And why did mon- sieur adopt so singular a course, after empow- ering Martini to act for him, as he did These w6re questiens asked both by madame and the notary; but there was no one to answer them! Mcasie ur Bouvais was ecccntric; fluctuating in his purposes and none knew the why and the wherefore of his many singular acts, while liv- ing. His signature was tiere, however, duly wimtesed--ad he changed his mind, it ap- ,peaead, at the last moment-fortunately for ma- -dame and her two young friends. Bra, who were Elmir Foublanc, and Flora Dolant.--and why did Bouvais take this ex- traordinary interest in their welfare? We will now Psswer these two queries, which we presume the xc&amp;der is anxious to be satisfied about. The family record already alluded to, showed a verT accurate account upon its pages of the iawfal marriage of Monsieur Bouvais, of Paris, to Marie Denoir, of Versailles. For reasons al- ready hinted at, in our previous chapters, Marie's ,amiily connections, though poor, were too proud to actnowledge this union--as the lady had in her reins a stream of " noble blood." Monsieur was F commoner, but possessed an ample for- tmne. He won the proud woman, wedded her secretly, and she visited him, at Paris (as we have teen), for years, until his death. The fruit of this union was but a single child -a ft r and lovely daughter. This child was removed to the south, soon after its birth, and Madame Denoir only professed to be its guardian, among the strangers to whose charge her educa- ion and weal was committed. The lady provided 4or her in princely style, however-for the means of the father were ample-and having located and caused her to be reared amid luxury and display in the beautiful town of Toulon-she did not omit to give out, at every fitting oppor- muity, that the growing beauty would eventa- ally Lteome the possessor of immense wealth. At fcrteen, then, this child--Flora Delmont,   as she was called-was known in the best cir, cles of the place in which she had residedl s long, as the "; ires of Tolom." The mother of Elmir Foablanc was the sec- ond wife of Monsieur Bouvais's own brother. The parents of Elmir died during his extreme youth, and his uncle had taken it upon himself to protect and educate the orphan. When El mir visited him at Paris, as it will be recollected he did twice in each month, for some years- the odd old gentleman often hinted to him that "he should be his heir." Elmir was too young 'to appreciate this repeated promise; and when his protector died, a train of circum stances at once occurred which prevented him from lea ning those details which subsequentl(y proved of so deep an importance to him. Madame Denoir conceived an affection for Elmir, at the outset; and she determined to place the youth in contact with Flora, with a view of bringing about a union between them., if possible, and thereby retaining the property of monsieur directly " in the family!' But, at the very commencement of her plan to effect this, the cunning Martini stepped in, with the determinae tion to frustrate her, and to benefit himself at the same time. Matters proceeded, as we have already observed, thenceforward. The tact adi cunning of the notary had been the cause for his success, thus far, but-at last-he found himself in close quarters, at the mercy of the trio whom he had so long endeavored to control, or vaa- quish, and he began to fear for the denouemntut which soon must follow. Elmir Fonblan' was still in prison, at Havr. Martini was busy with conjecture, and plot, anl contrivance-endeavoring to adkopt or hatch-up some new scheme to head off the designs and purposes of madame; while that lady, in cor pny with her daughter Flora (now no longer her wald, only), was steadily approaching Havre, with the intention of applying such remedy tI this desperate seeming case as future circum- stances would warrant or permit. It was a long and weary season-a period which had been attended with much of toil and hardship and peril-since young Elmir left France, and the friends he esteemed, behind him -and went forth a sailor-boy, to " seek his for- tune! The months that had intervenedhad been dreary ones to madame, too-but she now hoped to effect the boy's liberation, at once; and she promised herself a vast degree of happiness in the future, when she should find him innoeoa t    <pb n="68-69" xml:id="VAC6847-00000033"/> of the vile charge against him, which both her- self and Flora believed to be without the slight- est foundation in truth. Without being able to substantiate the im- pressions, still they felt inclined to believe that in some way or other, the cunning notary had some hand in the matter, despite the fact that only Lemoine ostensibly was the prosecutor. For this, however, they had only the shadow of a belief. But, in the meantime, as the carriage which contained madame and her daughter approached Havre, the disappointed, but still determined and reckless Martini, was most earnestly at work. His fortune, his reputation, his liberty, all were now at stake I He very well knew, if' the realfacts in the cause between him and Elmir were brought out, that he must be a heavy loser in the battle He knew that his next throw was to bd a final one-and, if he were beaten, a fatal one He therefore applied himself ner- vously and strenuously to the task, for the result of this desperate game was life or death to him I Already had Madame Denoir explained to the lovely Flora the secret of her birth. All that the kindest and most indulgent of mothers could do to make a daughter happy, had been done by our heroine's parent and when she learned that this deeply loved friend who had watched over her from her infancy, and whom she had looked up to as her guardian, only, was her own mother- her joy was great indeed. The policy which had actuated madame in her course towards her daughter, was fully explained by the former, and the latter was content to know the fact, without claiming any detail of reasons for euch a course.   It was sufficient for Flora to know that madame had proved herself to be her constant and f-ith- ful protector; and she was satisfied with her po- sition and prospect. The carriage which bore the two ladies to- wards Havre still rolled on, and finally reached its destination in safety. It was early afternoon when the vehicle arrived, and as soon as madame could arrange for temporary lodgings for herself and Flora, she sent a messenger to the office of Monsieur Lemoine, attorney, with a request that he would wait upon her, at once, at her hotel. As may readily be conjectured, that gentleman was not to be found. His office was closed, and no one knew when he would return. Madame desired to hear, from his own lips, an account of the attempted robbery which had been charged upon Elmir, and she had hoped, if there should appear the slightest real founda- tion for the alleged assault, that she should be able-through her ample pecuniary means-to induce the reputed aggrieved attorney to forego the further pursuit of the prosecution; and, by causing the absence from Havre of so important a witness against her young friend, to effect his discharge, for lack of evidence, when the day of trial should come round. But in this good intention she was thwarted Lemoine was absent from town, and she saw that some other course must be adopted-as she believed that he would of course return in season to appear against Elmir-in which event the chances were decidedly against her. Martini, meantime, had concluded the fiale to his plot-the details of which we will record in another chapter.   CHAFFER XXI. MARTINI ' FINAL PLARB. THE PROBPBCT BEGINS TO DAUBEN.   TEm notary's first determination was to pro- ceed forthwith to Havre, put a bold face upon the matter, re-assume his disguise as Lemoine, the crippled attorney, and appear against Elmir, at the trial. But, on a little farther reflection, his resolution was changed. "If," argued the wily scoundrel to himself, while he sat in his own private room, at Paris, preparing for the future, " if there be any truth in appearances, and if the indications in the boy's countenance and manner be anything, it were no easy task to confiont him in a court of justice I He is a bold fellow-that same young Fonblanc-and I shall not risk it. Nevertheless, my authority-my guardianship-but, I forget, again! All this is broken, superseded by those panprs found in the old man's Bible! If I could but reach Elmir ere madame can confer with him-I would once more try his mettle. If I cannot induce him to aid me in my affair with Marie Denoir, I can at least leave Havre per- emptorily-and save myself!" Such were the villain's thoughts. His two great objects in life-the acquirement of wealth, and the gratification of his desire for revenge on Madame Denoir-were perilled, and the pros- pect of his final success was now materially darkened. He thought of the documents which had been exhibited to him, and he queried (in   his desperation) for a moment, why he did not seiza upon them, at madame's lodgings, when she presented them, and tear them in atoms; but then he remembered that Flora Delmont was present, and he knew that such a course would have caused his certain ruin. Martini was ambitious, shrewd as ever, proud and determined-and he always hoped for event- ual success; though his sky was darkened, for the time being, still he did not despair; and having turned ,the whole matter carefully over in his mind, he took post-horses at midnight, and followed in the wake of the two ladies, reaching Havre a few hours after their arrival; where he sat himself quietly down, to watch for coming events, satisfied in his own mind, that he was yet equal to the rather unpromising di- lemma in which he so suddenly found himself precipitated. As soon as madame ascertained that Lemeine was away from home, she ordered a carriage, to wait upon the commissary of the arrondziment, in which Elmir had been arrested; and having ascertained all that it was possible to learn in regard to his case, she repaired in company with Flora to that functionary's office, in the hope of affording relief to Elmir, through his influence, as soon as she could make known her business, and explain her friendly intentions.    <pb n="70-71" xml:id="VAC6847-00000034"/> The complaint, madame," said the officer, as *cn as the lady had explained the object of her visit, "is a serious one. It was lodged against the young man by a legal gentleman of character and probity-" "Lemoine ." asked the lady. Yes, madame. He is not an old resident among us, but he enjoys the confidence of some of our best citizens; and he is a correspondent oi. Monsieur Martini, notary at Paris-a gentle- man whom we have occasion to esteem very highly here." "You are acquainted with Martini, theon ." a-ned the lady, doubtfully. Yes.. madame-by repute." '"He is well thought of, in Havre?" "Very well, madame." ' Then am I surprised." ' And why, pray?' 'kMartini is a villain, monsieur!" ' How, madame!" exclaimed the official, per- m=rptorily, starting from his seat; "Martini, the r Itary! Why, no man in France stands better  ir our esteem than Monsieur Martini."' "No man in France, then, is less of a man, La d none deserves the community's contempt! nd :scorn more thoroughly, than this same Mar- -ji,'" said the lady, firmly. This announcement evidently took the corn- mLssary by surprise. He thought he knew Mar- tia,. the notary, and he now questioned in his ( Tn mind whether the accuser before him were! nct insane! Yet, when he looked into her face I ce more, and read the proud determination evinced in her handsome and intelligent coun- tenance. when he glanced upon the youthful and imlnocent appearing Flora, who sat beside her, mute but equally firm and independent in her deportment, he concluded that there might be case for this wholesale, though unexpected ac- cusation. : I am at a loss, madame," continued the cEcer, "to comprehend your charge against this mm--but I assure you that the information you thave vouchsafed shall be entertained." You may rely on my words, monsieur," re- rurnded madame, " and I have now to ask if you ill permit me to communicate with a prisoner r-rder your control, named Fonblanc, of Paris?" "Fonblanc?" ' Yes, monsieur-Elmir Fonblanc; who is saccmeed of having attempted a robbery of the ;remises of one Lemoine, the attorney, of la 1ie* de ta Platte."   "Ah, I remambe.-y s. A  .i/ao maan, 'a9i- dently of talent and acquirements, and one who should have comported himself differently, evn under his adverse circumstances." "He is innocent, monsieur!" said madama, warmly. "I a-m sure he is innocent of the foab charge made-against him." "Can you prove this, too, madamal '." "H-hope to be able-that is, monsieur, I am his friend-we are his friends," added th% lady, pointing to Flora; ": and if we might be allowed to see him, I am certain that such ax planations may be made to the authorities as j shall entirely exonerate him from suspieioe.." "It is not our custom--" "I am aware, monsieur, that yao do not or. dinarily permit a conference with your prisonera, but I am Marki. Deno'ir. Among the letters that have been made a part of this case, are several of my own, which 1 suspect, with good reason, fell into the hands of the attorney through Foal I means-as I will endeavor to make it appear- and if this prove to be so, I am confident that I other circumstances will transpire, arid be made clear. in reference to Fonbianc's arrest, which will show that he is the victim of a most an- righteous conspiracy. May I see Fonblanc, monsieur?' "You shall, madame.'" "When, monsieur!" 'At once, if you will." "Thanks, monsieur," said both of she Ladii s, rising; and the comniissary rang his bell, di rectly. The subordinate who entered was in- structed to proceed as once to the prison, and inform the keeper that permission had been granted to the strangers to communicate wish Elmir Fonblanc; and within the next hour, the carriage of Madame Denoir stood before toi door of their friend's wretched quarters, During the period which had elapsed since the return of Elmir's messenger to him, with the unwelcome intelligence that his old friends could not be found either in Paris or Toulon, the unfortunate prisoner had suffered great men-. tal pain and mortification. He knew how an 'founded were the gross charges against him, and he felt a consciousness of innocence which hal buoyed him up, in the early days of his incarcoe t ration; but when the courier returned to him, with the information that Madame Denoir could not be seen, he despaired of his liberty. All the circumstances were against him.! If the scoun- dral lawyer should appear against him, ina onrt,   he curld not reply to him-and his fate seemed o be sealed, for the present 1 In the midst of Elmir's fears, his hopes, and his reflections--the turnkey, who had thus far been exceedingly kind to him, since his impria-, onment, called at his window to say that a stranger wished to see him. Elmir suspected nothing, and forthwith desired that he might be admitted. His astonishment was profound, when, a moment afterward, he arose to receive his visitor, and saw before him the person' of: Martini, the notary, of Paris! Before Fonblanc had time to recover from the shock occasioned by the unwelcome presence of this intruder, the attendant cried "fifteen minutes, monsieur!" and departed; when Elmir found himself alone with the first, and last, and sole cause of all his troubles and mishaps, thus far in life! "I trust you are well, Elmir," said the villain, with provoking calmness. "What brings you here, monsieur ." demand- ed Elmir, coldly. "Is it not enough that you should have occasioned my incar eration-is it not suflicient that you have caused me to be placed in this dungeon-or, must I be forced again to confer with a wretch who has forfeited all claim to forbearance, and whose presence I loathe :' "No more hard words, Elmir. We may speak in quiet, if you will; and, should I find you dis posed to listen to good advice, you may profit Largely from this interview," said Martini, " not- withstanding the foolish and perverse course of conduct vyn have pursued towards me." "I desire no-favor at your hands, monsieur- be sure of it 1" said Elmir, firmly. "You harvs   accnsed me, villanoly--you have traduced and ensnared me, for your own personal ends- I am in peril, I know-but I will patiently abides the result of the investigation yet to come." "But you may escape-" "Not through yomr influence, surely." "I tell you it is in fyj power to release yoa, * Elmir." "So is may be, to help yru-selj, monsieur ; buat 'I will no longer be your dupe." "Madame Denoir has beard of your arrest--" "Has se!"r' exclaimed Elmir, half mad with joy at this news, though Martini did not under.. j stand why he was so quickly elated. "Has madame heard of it ' Then am I sarfe What ho! 'Guard-guard   Guard!" shoute-i the youth, fiercely, through his grating. "Grari, I say!" "5Hold.! Elmir," said Martini, seizing ths  youth by the arm; i what would you do ." "Guard!" still shouted Elmir, stoutly; and the guard soon made his appearance, to learn  what was the cause of the disturbance. "Remove this man, forthwith," continued El- mir, addressing the turnkey. "H He is my ene- my 1 He it is who has driven me to this dun-  geon!

UIEXPECTED ARRIVAL O FRPIBNDB AT THE PRBSON.   WHLLS yet Martini had hardly left the square, the carriage of Madame Denoir halted Before the prison. It was a part of the notary's plan to inform Tlmir that Madame Denoir had learned of his arrest, and had commissioned him to visit the young man and propose to him once more to quit Havre, in quiet if he had agreed to this -the trial of Elmir would have been quashed, "Lemoine" would not have made his appear- ance, and subsequently-by agreement-the no- tary would again have met him, sent him out of France, and then followed madame up, at his leisure Such was the plan; but, as we have seen, Elmir would not hear to the notary, in any way whatever. When the rusty old hinges grated upon the retreat of Martini, as the door closed behind him, how little did the poor prisoner anticipate what was in store for him, in a few brief mo- ments! He was wild with excitement--with contempt and rage at the audacity and duplicity of the notary-with joy and hope at the an- nouncement that Madame Denoir had learned of his trouble. "Ah  She will not persecute me," he con-   , tended, mentally " she is my friend. She wil D come to me-she will relieve me-she win res- : cue me from this dreadful peril And Flora, too, I shall hear of her-sweet, innocent, charm- ; ing Flora Delmont! They will not believe me guilty of this terrible charge; they will assist me to punish the fiend who has so long annoyed us all-they will defend me-" "Leave me, I say!" continued Elmir, harshy -turning around, at this moment, as the turn- key approached his window, and informed him that some one would confer with him. "Bid him leave me-I will not see him. He is a knave-a thief-a slanderer-a vile, heartless wretch-" "Who, monsieur rn "Martini, the notary!" "He is gone and two other strangers are in waiting to see you, by permission from monsieur le commissaire." "Two-others. Two, did you say?" asked Elmir, as his heart leaped into his throat U Yes, monsieur; two ladies. And very nice seeming persons are they, to be sure." ' Yes-yes-show them up, in-that is to say,   monsieur-are you oertain that they ask for me?" "They bring a permit to confer with Elmir Fonblanc." "It is right-they are my friends 1" "Here they be, monsieur," added the turn- key; and as the door opened, the poor prisoner saw before him his best loved friends-Madame Denoir and Flora Delmontl  He staggered back, overcome with his emotions; and his vis- itors entering, the door was closed, and the three friends were alone together, inElmir's cell! The scene which followed, we cannot faith- fully depict, and w .ave the reader to conceive the joy which filled the hitherto troubled breast of the poor sailor, who had so long been separ- ated from those he so dearly loved, and who had been so faithful to him, in his adversity-as he now grasped the hand of each, and hastily re- peated in their presence, though briefly, the story' of his wrongs and sufferings.- Those who have accompanied us thus far in our narration, can imagine how happy was the prisoner to meet with those friends, and to know  from the lips of both madame and Flora, that they sympathized with him in the midst of his perscuntion, and believed him' innocent of the crime laid to his charge. While his beautiful visitors listened, then, Elmir recounted his perils and the wrongs he  had suffered; but when he spoke of Lemoino and Martini as one and the same person, the color fled from madame's cheeks, and she was astounded beyond conception! She called to mind a score of circumstances which had trans- pired during her previous visit to Havre, and she very quickly came to the conclusion that there was no mistake in Elmir's recital She had entrusted to Martini, disguised as Lemoiu,  the very plans she originally entertained to thwart that wily villain; she had conferred con- fidentially with Martini himself, when she thought she was speaking with Lemoine! - The presence of the letter found at her door some months before, which he had intercepted, and  which had been inadvertently dropped in her hotel by this supposed Lemoine, was lost there by Martini-when the so-styled Havre attorney left her, on the evening of her consultation with him, at her room I All these things were now apparent-and madame realized their full force, as Elmir proceeded. Butt e details of the scene at the attorney's   ' office, when Elmir discovered the intercepted package of letters, and when he also first ascer- tained that this attorney and Martini was the same individual, engaged the especial notice of madame-who repeatedly interrupted Elmir to learn the exact particulars of that occurrence. Fonblanc did not hesitate to acknowledge that he throttled the knave, and that in the midst of the fray he was seized upon by the police. He explained every minutia of the quarrel, how- ever, to the entire satisfaction of his frienls; and, after the most cordial assurances on their part that he should shortly be released-madame i and Flora left him once more to himself. Faithful to her promise, madame lost no time in again communicating with the commissary, I who, after hearing her account of the interview with Elmir, referred her with an especial letter of recommendation, to the Procuretr du Roi. iThe letters which had been put into the care of )the government, and which Martini relied on to prove the alleged attempt at robbery (against Elmir), were very readily recognized by madame and Flora, who did not hesitate to affirm were their letters, sent to Elmir, and evidently inter- copted by Martini, en route! This fact, coupled with the charge that Lemoine and Martini was the same person, led to saspicions of a grave character; and an order was instantly issued for the notary's arrest and imprisonment. While this was going on, the office of Lemoine was again opened, and the crippled occupant re-appeared there, with his gray wig, his staff and his huge green goggles. He resorted to his incognita once more as a final rtse. He deter- mined to meet madame (unaware as he was that she had as yet seen Fonblanc), and by some coup de main which he imagined himself capable of to coerce her into his plans, or finally to com- promise the whole matter as best he might. While he sat in his easy chair, mentally con- cocting the details of this final grand scheme to effect his wicked designs, the door opened softly, and Madame Denoir herself entered his apart- ment! The cunning attorney did not blanch, and his I ready tongue served him bravely for the crisis. He did not expect his visitor, by any means- but he knew the value of a diplomatic course, in this unsolicited emergency. "Ah, madame!" he said, quickly rising, and assuming the squeaking tone of voice in which he had addressed her upon previous occasions; "I was looking for a summons to wait upon    <pb n="74-75" xml:id="VAC6847-00000036"/> you, for I learned an hour (*u o. th4 you were on your way to Havre! Madame Denoir looked directly minto the de- civer's eye, and sat down before him, without a word of reply. "You come from Paris, madame?' "I come from the prison of Elmir Ponblanc, monsieur," said the lady, bitterly. 4 Ah, yes. I know it all-I have heard from my friend, Martini-" Elmir Fonblanc is now in a miserable dun- geon, upon complaint of one Lemoine, the attor ney-who charges him with having attempted a robbery, on the latter's premises." "Such is the fact, madame, I admit-and for your sake, who I learned but recently claim to be his friend-I regret his misfortune' -"Do you kaow me, monsieur T "Yes-yes. You are-" "Marie Denoir I You have fauie&amp; thut you knew me, and you have pursued me and mine wit a malice unheard of, unlimited, inexcusa- bi. monrLieur' Long sih(e, warned you hut   you did not heed me. The hour for retnibusion is at length arrived!" "I do not comprehend you, madame r "No? Then I will be explicit-though I shall also be brief. The career of intrigue and deceit you have so long practised, is over. I tell you I have just come from the prison-house of ' Elmir Fonblanc, who lies there at your instiga- tion, falsely accused-and you know it I The order for his release, however, will be quickly promulgated-while the order for your arrest, Andreas Martini, has already gone forth, from the Procureur du Roi 1" "What!" shrieked the now thoroughly alarm- ed notary, forgetting his assumed tone of voice and his disguise, entirely-" what, madame 1"-- "I ave spoken truly, monsieur ;" added the lady rising; "you are known; your guilt can be p oved; your duplicity and your knavery will ; serve you no longer 1 You have been your own enemy-and your intended victims have tri- , umphed. Adieu!" Thus speaking, madame quickly retired   CHVAPT!'F XXI V.- rTET: Y('TaRY If4 TaOnIRUOIILT -&amp;EXiEtD.   As tLe doo dclesed upoer the retreating foot- steps of his visitor, Matini sprang desperately to his feet, "What now '," he asked himself, wildly., "What is to follow this I Am I to be beaten, vanquished, annihilated, without a final strug. gle .AMveir t"Bat his thoughts soon became connected, and he saw the opportunity before him for escape. He dared not tarry to ascertain whether madame had really spoken the truth, for delay was fatal to him, if she had. He would quit France, escape to England, and leave to future chance his hope of overcoming his op-' ponents. Hurrying to his closet, therefore, he instantly threw aside his staff and disguise, and thrust himself hastily into his notarys dress. He se- cured his money, notes and valuables, and was just aboat to leave his office, when a loud rap- a most unearthly and unwelcome summons at that moment, to his ears-was heard upon his office-door! He started-halted-gasped for breath-but could not reply I "What, ho   Within  there! Monsieur-   open  In the name of'the King!" said a rough voice from without. For an instant there was no reply. The sum- mons was again repeated, but still no answer came; and he overheard the genad'armes out- side, as they spoke of his arrest. "He's not far away," said one. "Le us wait, then ;" was the answer. "He will soon return. Do you know himl " "Yes," said the other.  "As Martini!" Yes, or Lemoine, either." "Ha, ha! Cest bien. He is in a nice fix, to be sure 1 He will soon be better acquainted wish the interior of the Bastile-the villain " "The Bastile "' "Yes-if convicted ; he will not be detained in Havre, surely, for we have enough of his spe- cies here already ;'and he belongs in Paris, you see. i"What was that .' asked the second speaker, a moment afterward, addressing his companion- "I heard nothing-did you?' said the other. Yesa" was his answer. as he turned his head    <pb n="76-77" xml:id="VAC6847-00000037"/> towards the door, and listened as he thought to some movement with i  "Lemoine's" office. Bat he learned nothing further, and so they tar- ried in quiet for an hour-two, three hours longer-but still their intended victim did not make his appearance. Martini, for a considerable time after the arri- val of the guard who came to seek him, remained in a sort of miserable stupor. His wonted non- chalnce, his customary cunning and assurance forsook him, almost instantaneously, when he heard the object which the soldiers had in view, as he learned it from their conversation outside of the door-from which, had he had five min- utes longer time to prepare for it, he would have escaped with certainty, and perhaps finally. As it was, he saw that the moment he should show himself, he would fall into the hands of the guard, who were no " respecters of persons." In this emergency, then, for the first time in his chequered, but wicked life, he was staggered! The fearful final words of Madame Denoir still rung in his ears-and he was desperate, for he saw that the ' day of retribution" which that injured wome n had predicted, was now all too close at hand for his present or prospective weal! What was to be done! If he attempteto depart, the hounds of jus- tice would seize upon him at the very threshold of his office; if he remained out of sight, saspi- cions would be increased, and a search would be made of his piemises-when he would of course be discovered; if he moved, to cause the slight- est noise, his door would instantly be forced- for he knew the character and recklessness of those who now sought him! What, then, must be done! He had been baffled by a woman! The dar- ling scheme of his life was overturned. Elmir Fonblanc would prove a fearful and crushing witness against him, should he sugffer himself to meet him on a trial. He was vanquished, beaten at-every point, and was at that moment at the mercy of the guard, who watched with the veriest lynx-eyes for their anticipated prey! Under   these frightful circumstances-with certain dis- grace and imprisonment before him-with the galleys-or the Bastile in prospect, if he were caught as he was in the very snare he had set for others-what remained for Andreas Martini, the notary? "Death t" said the desperate man, "before such disgrace and such chagrin as must follow an expose like this! There is now no tie to bind me to earth-I am alone in the world, the vic- tim, unluckily, of the very deceit which I have imposed upon others. But I will not submit to be dragged through the streets to prison-and then to suffer-what! No-no-no ?" Quiet reigned in the Rue de la Plaite; and the two soldiers had waited several hours for the at- torney's return; when, for the second time, they overheard a slight movement:within the office. "Some one is there," said the first man. "So I think," replied his companion. "It must be he, then ." "Shall we force the door i" "Yes-let us be satisfied if we have been watching here three or four long hours for noth- ing," responded his mate; and with these words. they threw themselves against the door, which quickly gave way before the assault; and, to their utter surprise, they found monsieur sitting calmly at his desk, as if nothing unusual had transpired in his vicinity! "Sound asleep, Jose," exclaimed the foremost soldier, "as I'm a Frenchman! I've a mind to waken him, without ceremony, for thus detain- ing us in the cold, for nought." "Look again, Torriorre!" said his companion. in a whisper; "look again!" and the paling cheek of the last speaker alarmed Torrierre. "Is he not asleep, Jose?" queried the other. "He is dead, Torrierre!' was the ieply-and so it proved. He had taken poison; and though he now sat bolt upright in his chair, before the desk, the fatal empty phial which lay at his feet was quickly discovered, and it was found that Martini, the notary-who had seen and commit. ted so many sins-had gone to his final account    CHAPTER XXV. A BRIGIIT&amp;R riCTUEI. A IIAPPY SCENE. THE IFINALi,   F:oM the dreary and sombre picture just now presented, let us turn to a bright and glowing scene in another place, where joy, and pleasure, and revelry ruled the passing hours! Come with me, reader, once more-to the beautiful city of Toulon, in Southern France. The clouds which had so long lowered over the fortunes of the sailor-boy are dispersed; and a twelve-month has passed away since the sudden and terrible death of Martini, the notary. The documents which secured to Elmir Fonblanc a handsome fortune, are upon record, in due form; he has attained his majority, and is now in pos- session of his ample means-bequeathed to him by his uncle, Monsieur Bonvais, of Paris. It was the eighteenth birth-night of Flora Del- mont; and to the superbly appointed residence of Madame Denoir, in Toulon, we will now in- vite the company of our readers. This mansion was located in the most fashionable quarter of the town, and for several months it had been the "centre of attraction" for the fashion and elite of the neighborhood. During the year just now passed by, our three friends had made the tour of the continent, to- gether. Immediately upon the fact having been made known to the authorities of Havre that Martini had committed suicide, an order was 5*   'issued by the commissary-at tho insti i Lm c Madame Denoir-for the further examrs:i.;io oe' Elmir Fonblanc, who was then in prison upon v, charge of assault and attempted robb,-ry H wws forthwith brought up, therefore, but no oun appeared against him-and he was very 0oor. afterwards released entirely from custody. He returned to Paris, in triumph, accompa. nied by madame and Flora Delmont-the latte' personage constantly improving (in Elmir's est,- mation), as they became better acquainted, and proceeded forward. Fonblanc entered into v, detailed account of all the scenes he had passed through, from the hour that he first left Paris- and his explanations were not only entirely sat- isfactory, but his narrative served to show moret conclusively than they had yet had reason to suspect, how correct was the opinion which the, ladies had entertained of the cunning and do ceitful notary. In the twelvemonth just terminated, ample opportunity had been afforded for all these exphlt nations; and though Elmir had improved then to inform his two friends of all that he had suf- fered during the period of his absence-at the same time he had not omitted to aim to ingra- tiate himself in the good esteem of Flora De'- mont.    <pb n="78-79" xml:id="VAC6847-00000038"/> In this effort he had been eminently success- ful, as may well be conceived! Madame Denoir had lost no time, meanwhile, in pushing for- ward the object of her own hopes-for she de- sired that Elmir and Flora should be united to- gether, and she had long since resolved to bring it about (if it could be plausibly effected) at the appropriate time. That time arrived, at last. Madame had watched the growing friendbip and filial affection which existed between h-r proteges, and having entered into a full explana- tion of the origin of Flora, and also cleared up the cause of her secret marriage with Monsieur Bouvais-as well as the reasons or her subse quent course of conduct-she formally presented to Elmir her daughter, Flora, and promised him her hand in marriage. Come then, reader, to Toulon-and let us witness the gay scene that is passing within the beautiful mansion to which we have alluded, the residence of Madame Denoir-the property of Flora Delmont. The " heiress of Toulon " was eighteen years old, on this very night; and a glorious assem- blage of the beauty, the nobility, the aristocracy of the town were congregated within the mas sive walls of that fine estete, to witness the mar- riage of Elmir Fonblanc and the fair Flora Del- mont. There were gay equipages, and lordly guests. fair dames and nobles of renk in attendance- and the sound of laughter, and music, and joy rang through the gaily appointed saloons. Never did Flora look so beautiful as when she enteied the drawing-room, at last, leaning gracefully upon the arm of the handsome and nobly formed Elmir, who was followed by half a score of   groomsmen and bridesmaids-preparatory to the nuptials. The act which joined " two fond and willing hearts " was at length concluded-and the object of Madame Denoir was thus consummated. The priest pronounced his fervent blessing on the union, and Flora Delmont (hitherto so termed) and Elmir Fonblanc were one! It remains for us to speak of this happy ter- mination of our story, but briefly. After the varied and threatening troubles of Elmir's early life, he found himself a happy man,-in posses- sion of an ample fortune in his own individual right, and the husband of her he loved, from first to last, most devotedly; while the property of Flora, bequeathed to her by Monsieur Bon- N vais, was also very large-of itself, c ufficient to satisfy the most ambitious votary of wealth. In company with madame, the newly wedded pair immediately started for the north again- and having viited Paris, they repaired to Havre, and took the steamer thence for Dover. At length they found themselves in London, at the height of' the season" in that wealthy metrop- olis. A joyful honey-moon succeeded the mar- riage, aid rich the happiness which was in pros- pect before them in the future. And there we will leave them-amid th eir rounds of pleasure and the enjoyments ef their household felicities. We have brought the wan- dering sailor-boy home, we have seen the fdte of the wicked and the wayward, we have chronicled the triumph of virtue and integrity over vice and duplicity-and we have done with the his- tory of TII HEIRESs OF TOULON.   THE END.   [FROM GLEASON'S PICTORIAL DRAWING-ROOM COMPANION.] ER   I LLA:  BY MRS. SARAH M. HOWE.   IG:HLT, calm and beautifal, was again fold- J in her azure wings over that fair isle of. the sea, the beautiful but oppressed Cuba. The bright stars came out one by one in the cloud- less heavens, and the moon shone among them like a qu3en, fair and beautiful. All was still in Havana, the Cuban capital, save tho measured tread pf the sentinel, or an order given by come Spanish soldier, which was quickly executed, when all was still again. Occasionally a passer- by wculd attract the notice of the sentinels, and after r3eceving toh usual challenge, was allowed to pass on his way unmolested. Wearily pursuing his toilsome way through the now silcnt city, was an infirm and brolkn- dqwn old man, who walked slowly along, his eyes bent upon the ground and apparently deep- ly absorbed in his own thoughts. He was oc- casionally challenged by the sentinels, and even then he did not raise his eyes from the ground, but answering them in the trembling tone of old age, again passed slowly on. His dress was worn and tattored, presenting the appearance of extreme poverty; but, froni beneath his worn vest protruded the hilt of a splendid dagger, richly set with diamonds, but which the folds of his dark cloak concealed from observation. In- deed, the person himself appeared as if ho would willingly escape notice, for he passed cautiously   along in the dark shadow of the houses, and was seldom noticed by the sentinels. "That fellow is n't quite as poor and good- for-nothing as he pretends to be, sergeant," said a Spanish guard, addressing a tall, bearded man, who stood near, gazing out upon the ocean as if endeoavoring to descry some incoming vessel. "What did you say, Marco ." said-e, turn- ing to the first speaker; " did you say anything respecting that old man, yonder!" "Yes, I did, sergeant," answered the other, quickly; "1 don't think he's just what he pro- tends to be." "Why, what does hqopretend to be, Marco V" asked the sergeant, laughing slightly at his com- panion's earnestness. "Well-well, I don't know exactly," replied the other, looking a little foolish; "but I mead, he knows more about some things than he would choose to have us know."- "Why, what dost thou think he knows so much about " asked a sharp-eyed Creole, who F stood near, and who had heard his conversation with the sergeant. "Don Garcia .'Alesta, for instance," replied F the Spaniard, his da:k eyes glittering as he * spoke: "Ha, dost thou think so, Marco ." exclaimed , the sergeant, quickly; " dost thou think he can tell us of Don Garcia d'Alesta "    <pb n="80-81" xml:id="VAC6847-00000039"/> "I shouldn't wonder at all if he could," re- plied the soldier; "for see, he is going in the villa d'Alesta, and it is very likely Don Garcia would wish to send some intelligence to his fair sister, of his whereabouts, by this time, and that old fellow yonder would be just such an one as be would choose to send it by, as suspicion would not be very likely to attach to such an old, ragged, poverty-stricken fellow." "By the cross of the virgin, I believe you are half right, Marco," exclaimed the sergeant; " we ought to have questioned the old man. If you think he will tell anything, you had best follow him and question him respecting his errand." "I think, sergeant, that the best way would be to follow him and conceal yourself in some manner; and, if he has any such intelligence, listen while he delivers it, and then you would be :ore that he spoke the truth," broke in he sharp-eyed Creole. "But he may have a letter from Don Garcia; and in that case, you wouldn't be able to hear much from him, it's my opinion," said Marco, quickiy. ' I think," said the sergeant, after meditating upon the matter for a few moments, " that Cor- lano's way will be the best. If he has intelli- gence from Don Garcia, you can probably con- ceal yourself so as to hear it; and if he has a letter for the Donna Ervilla, and you suspect it is from her brother or any of his friends, I think you will be able to take it from her, either by threatening or force." 'We can never take it from her by threats, I well know; for the Donna Ervilla is too brave and resolute for that," said Marco, decidedly. "Well, then, you will be obliged to use force," said the sergeant; "you, Marco and Corlano, will go and endeavor to ascertain something re- specting the present concealment of Don Garcia d'Alesta. Go quick, for the old fellow has near- Iy reached the villa." During the conversation, the object of their suspicions had nearly reached the beautiful sub- than estate known as the villa d'Alesta. It looked almost like a'fairy palace, with its snow- white walls, rising from out the rich foliage of of the tall, waving trees, and glittering in the  clear moonlight. A flight of marble steps led  up to the main entrance, and in front of the handsome mansion were two long rows of beau- tiful orange trees, their fresh green leaves and snow-white blossoms forming a rich contrast. i Etanding beneath one of these trees and gazing  \                      e.   - anxiously at the old man as he approached, was a young and surpassingly beautiful lady. She could not have seen more than eighteen sum- rmers; yet her form was full and rounded, and t her dark, sparkling, expressive eyes told that she was of Spanish blood. Around her sym- metrical neck and shoulders fell rich clusters of shining raven curls, with here and therp a re nestling among them, half concealed, ye s ing amid the rich dark ringlets. An exr  half of hope, half of fear, rested upon the s\ bright lips, as the stranger advanced towards her. "We are alone," said she, as he gazed inquir- ingly around as if to ascertain if any one was near. Scarcely had she spoken the words, when the old man's form suddenly straightened up; he threw aside the mask, which in the shadowy moonlight had been mistaken for his face, divest- ed himself bf the tattered garments, and stood before the surprised and astonished maiden, a handsome young officer, clad, from head to foot, in a splendid military costume! "Dear Garcia!" cried she, throwing herself into his outstretched arms) "you have indeed surprised me!" "And pleased you too, I hope, Ervilla," said Don Garcia d'Alesta, pressing his fair sister closer to his bosom. "Yes, dear brother," answered the young Cu- ban maiden; "but why have you thus exposed your life and freedom as to come now, when the Spanish are on your track?" ("If you could not penetrate my disguise, dear Ervilla, no other could," answered the young 1soldier, kissing the fair forehead of his sister. "But, dear brother, should you be once taken by the Spanish soldiers, your head would be the forfeit of the noble part you have taken in the cause of liberty for oppressed Cuba!" exclaimed the young girl, in a startling voice. "But I fear not death, dear sister, if I am doomed to it in consequence of my republican sentiments and actions; for 't is noble to die in the cause of freedom," answered Don Garcia, soothingly. "We must trust to Heaven, Garcia," said the beautiful Cuban; and raising her head, she smiled hopefully. "But how prospers our cause?" "Well, dear Ervilla, as we could dare to hope. Within three days, General Lopez expects a re- inforcement of Cubans from the mountains, and a large number of troops from the United States,   when we intend to bring the Spanish army to an engagement; and there is no doubt but we shall vanquish them, if the troops prove but half as brave and well trained as they are repre sented to be." "God grant that your hopes may be realized!"' exclaimed the maiden, fervently, and raising her eyes supplicatingly to heaven. "O thou all-seeing One!" she cried, raising her clasped hands and bare white arms, " grant, in thine infi- nite mercy, that our beloved isle may yet -be free!" "Your prayer will be answered, dearest sis- ter!" exclaimed Don Garcia, in a thrilling, earn- est tone, "and Cuba will yet be free! Free from the oppressive tyranny of Spain, and will yet enjoy that best gift of Heaven, true liberty!" "I believe you, brother!" said the patriotic maiden. "Narciso Lopez has awakened a spirit in Cuba that will not die until our homes and country are lastingly free!" "I trust so, dear sister. There are many in our own island that feel like us, but dare not follow the standard of rebellion-for their fear of Queen Isabella's minions overcomes their love for liberty. "But what has attracted your attention t" The young girl's countenance had become of a marble paleness. Her eyes were riveted in one direction, and their wild, startled expression told that something unusual had been seen by them. "We have been seen and overheard!" she whispered, startlingly. "Good Heavens! then we are both doomed!" exclaimed Don Garcia, in a half whisper, grasp- ing the arm of his sister. "I plainly saw the cap of a Spaniard, who is concealed behind the cluster of orange trees, and, the next instant, I saw a sword flash bright- ly in the moonbeams. I could not be mistaken, and I fear that we have been both seen and overheard!" "I fear so! Let us pass quietly into the man- sion, as if we had not discovered them, and then, we can find a safe place of congealment." "You are right, brother. We may yet escape. Walk slowly, and if there is a footstep behind, I shall hear it, be it ever so gentle." Slowly and silently they entered the, hand- some mansion, each feeling that upon the action of the present moment depended life or death. Just as they closed the massive door, Ervilla gave one glance back to ascertain if no one had   followed them. Two men had at that instant emerged from the group of orange trees, and were coming, at a rapid rate, up the path which led to the mansion. Ervilla quickly closed the door. "You are discovered, Garcia! They are ap- Iproaching the mansion! Fly to my boudoir. and conceal yourself in the secret closet, which. you well know! It is the only alternative to save your life! Quick, as you love your life and me!" cried the young girl, pleadingly. "But you, Ervilla!' "They will not harm me! They dare not! It is you whose life they seek, and you alone whom they will harm. Quick  I hear them ascending the steps! If you love me, fly!" The young officer could no longer withstand the pleading words and tones of his noble sister, and, just as the two without had reached the door of the mansion, he darted silently from the room. Ervilla sprang through a door opposite to that taken by Don Garcia, and entered a richly furnished parlor, and taking up a book, seated herself as if she knew nought of the pro- cee4ings without. After a moment's consultation without the door, the two Spaniards entered, and approach- ed the door of the room where sat Donna Er- villa. She looked up as they entered, but be- trayed no sign of fear or displeasure, but was evidently much surprised. Both gazed upon the beautiful maiden for a moment without speaking; then, in a somewhat deferential tone, Marco spoke: "Fair Donna Ervilla, can you tell us of the present concealment of Don Garcia d'Alesta t' "What dost thou wish of Don Garcia d'Ales- ta?" inquired the fair Cuban, evading the Span- iard's question. "We have reason to believe that he is at this moment concealed in this mansion, and it is the order of the captain-general that he be arrested wherever he can be found, for taking part in and favoring the present invasion." "And it. is to arrest him that you now en- deavor to gain from his sister the knowledge of his place of concealment, is it not " calmly asked the young girl, fixing her piercing je: black eyes upon the countenance of Marco. "It is, fair Lady Ervilla," answered the Span- iard, his eyes falling under the piercing gaze of the noble maiden. "Then," exclaimed she, rising, and her eyes flashed still brighter, " not while I live will you gain the desired information!"    <pb n="82-83" xml:id="VAC6847-00000040"/> "Then we must find him some other way, Corlano," said Marco, somewhat awed by the proud, resolute manner of Ervilla. "Will yon allow us to search the mansion, Donna Ervilla?" "Willingly," answered the lady, for she feared not that they would discover the concealment of her brother, if no one informed them of the secret closet. They turned and left the room, but Ervilla's anxiety for her brother's safety would not allow her to remain behind. They searched the mansion thoroughly, and at last stood in the boudoir of Donna Ervilla, with countenances expressive of their anger and dis- appointment. In front of a large full length family portrait stood the young Cuban maiden, gazing intently at the features delineated upon the canvas. "Lady Ervilla," said Marco, firmly, " if Don Garcia d'Alesta is not immediately found, and by your informing us of his place of conceal ment, your own life shall atone for it!' The noble girl neither moved nor uttered a word. "Donna Ervilla, will you give as the desired information?" said Marco, approaching and lay- ing his hand upon her shoulder. "Never P" proudly replied the spirited Ervilla, turning and fizing her eyes, flashing with indig- nant firmness, upon Mareo. "Then die for it!' cried the Spaniard, draw- ing a dagger from his bosom. "Hold!" exclaimed a deep, commanding voice, as the largo portrait swung forward, dis- closing a secret passage, from which stepped forth Don Garcia d'Alesta. "Back "' cried he, in a voic3 of thruder, 1"touch her nct, on peril of your lives!" And as he spoke, he drew from his bosom tho glittering dagger. Marco stepped back amazed, then applying to his lips a small silver whistle which hung by his side, he blew a shrill call. The next instant cix Spanish soldiers, armed to the teeth, entered the room! "Arrest that traitor 1" cried Marco, pointing to Don Garcia, who stood petrified with amaze- ment. The soldiers sprang towards him, but it was some moments before they were able to capture him, so brave was his defenco of him- self. But the Spaniards conquered, and Don Garcia d'Alesta was borne from his home a prisoner! Twilight had again settled down upon the earth, and again wrapped the proud city of Ha- vana in a shadowy gloom. Clouds sailod darkly   over the azure sky, obscuring the twinkling stars, which ever and anon sparkled out from the edges of the dark clouds. -The wind sighed mournfully among the waving trees, and lifted the drooping plumes of the Spanish officers, as they hurried through the almost deserted streets. The clock had struck the hour of ten, when the large door of the villa d'Alesta opened, and a female form stepped out into the darkness She was clad in an ample cloak, but she was evidently young, for her step was light and agile as that of a young fawn. Sho closed the door of the mansion, and tripping lightly down the steps, took the direction of the city. It was Donna Ervilla d'Alesta, the sister of the patriot captive. She walked lightly along through the silent streets, looking cautiously around her at every slight noise that attracted her attention. But few noticed her, and those that did, merely won- dered why a female was passing the streets at that time of night, and then dismissed her from their minds. At length she reached a small building in one of the less frequented streets, and tapped lightly at the door for admittance. It was opened by an exceedingly handsome young man, who seemed much surprised at see- ing a lady at that late hour. "Ah, Victor," said Ervilla, throwing back the cloak that had concealed her features, " you are surprised at my boldness in thus seeking you at night." "You, Donna Ervilla!" cried the young man, in a tone of the most extreme surprise. "Can it be that this is the Donna d'Alesta " "It is no other, .Victor," said the beautiful Cuban maiden; " but can you serve me to-night, Victor?" "Yes, Donna Ervila, my poor life is at your service," sarid the young man, devotedly; "but please enter, for the night wid .is too chilly for thee." Ervilla entered the neat, well lighted room, and the young man closed the door. "Victor," said the maiden, " my b other is in prison i" "What, Don Garcia!" "Yes, my only brother." '. Can it be possible that the accursed Span- iards have at last arrested him?" "They have. Last night he came to visit me and inform me of the prospects of the liberating army, but so disguised that even I could not recognize him. They mast have uespected him,   for while we were conversing beneath the orange trees in front of the mansion, two soldiers were watching us, and, by accident, I saw the glitter of one of their swords in the moonbeams. I im- mediately informed Garcia, and we entered the mansion, and my brother concealed himself just as the soldiers entered. They searched the house, but could not discover him, and then be- gan to threaten me to draw from me the infor- mation they wished, when Garcia stepped from his place of concealment to protect me, and wa taken." "And is now in prison!" He is." "He shall be liberated!" cried the young Cu- ban, with a firm voice and flashing eye, " if I die in the attempt!" "Do not expose your own life, Victor!" cried the young girl, earnestly, and laying her hand unconsciously upon the arm of her companion. "Is my life of any value to you, Ervilla?" asked the young Cuban, tenderly, and gazing into the depths of the beautiful maiden's soul- speaking eyes. She blushed deeply, and drop- ped her eyes upon the floor, for she felt that her earnest words and manner had betrayed the cherished secret of her -heart. The young man'b expressive countenance beamed with joy. He felt that his long silent love for Ervilla d'Alesta was now returned, and his heart beat wildly with its load of happiness. He bent his head until his clusterirg locks mingled with the raven curls of the beautiful maiden, and whispered: "If I save your brother, dearest Ervilla, will you not condescend to smile upon my long si- lent, but deep, undying love?" The only reply of Ervilla was to raise her speaking eyes confidingly to the face of her companion, and place her small white hand in his. It was enough. He pressed the noble girl to his bosom, ^l her head rested upon his shoulder. "But we must not speak of love now, dear Victor!" said the blushing girl, disengaging her- self from his arms, " for my dear brother is yet in prison, and must be liberated." "He shall be!" said Victor, firmly. "Listen a few moments, Victor," continued Donna Ervilla, " to-day I have ascertained that an American vessel now lies at Havana, which will sail for New Orleans to-morrow. If Garcia could but be liberated to-night or early in the morning, we could take passage in the Ameri. can vessel, and when once in New Orleans we shall be safe."   "That is true, Ervilla And if it is in the power of mortal man to do it, your brother shall be safe ere another sun sets over our fair island. How to rescue him, I have not yet de- termined; but with courage, resolution and cau- tion, I feel sure that I can liberate him. If I succeed, can I hope to claim the noble Donna Ervilla for my bride?" "If you succeed," said the young girl, looking up confidingly into the face of her lover, "I promise to become your bride. My heart has long been yours, but the secret ias locked up in my own breast, for I thought that you loved me not." "I have long loved you, dearest Ervilla," said the handsome young Cuban, kissing the fore- head of the sweetgirl beside him, "I have loved you deeply, tenderly and truly. Death alone shall now part us, for our hearts are pledged for- ever." "I must go now, dear Victor," said Ervilla, releasing herself from his encircling arms, " and may Heaven bless and protect thee until we meet again I'? "I will accompany you to the villa d'Alesta, dear Ervilla; for it is not a fitting hour for one so fair and young as thee to return alone.'5 They parted at the door of the mansion, after standing for several moments beneath the orange tries, conversing of Don Garcia. Ervilla trip- ped lightly up the steps, her heart beating high in her bosom, and Victor returned to his home, happier than he had been for many days. In his dark, cold prison, sat I)on Garcia d'AI- esta, brooding over his sad and dreadful fate. The rose hue of morn had brightened up the sky, but he knew it not; for no sunlight ever dared to cheer up that gloomy cell, or a ray of the morn's bright radianee to light the dark, cheerless walls. He was thinking of his sister -the beautiful Ervilla; in protecting whom, he had been captured. Yes, the heart of the patriot captive was sad and sorrowful, as he thought of his noble sister, who he knew must sadly mourn over her brother's fate. The tread of the jailor aroused him from his reverie, and, a moment after, he heard the bars and bolts removed from the door of his cell The jailor entered, followed by a young man' whom Garcia recognized as Victor Bertran. He sprang to his feet, and warmly grasped the hand of his old friend, as he said, in a mournful tone: "You have come to bid me farewell, Victor, ere I die, which will be soon." *     <pb n="84-85" xml:id="VAC6847-00000041"/> "I come to bring a message from your sister, Don Garcia"        t "From Ervilla? Is she ye at the mansion?" At this moment the jailor turned to close the dooi of the cell, and springing forward, Victor gave him a blow upon the head, which laid him senseless at the young man's feet. Then turn- ing to the astonished Don Garcia, he said: "I have formed a plan for your escape, Don Garcia! Throw this jailor's cloak over your shoulders, and place his cap upon your head, and follow me! With caution and courage, you may yet be free!"            - Don Garcia. after a moment's hesitation from surprise, threw the jailor's cloak around him, and placed the gay cap over his own curling locks. Had not his face been seen, no one would have suspected that he was not the Span- ish jailor. "Now follow me," said Victor, "and let none suspect that you are not the jailer, as that would ruin the whole plan if you should. Be surprised at nothing you see or hear, and say as little as possible." "I will obey you, my noble 'and faithful friend," gratefully said Don Garcia, as they stepped over the prostrate body of the fallen jailor. They passed the sentinels without speaking a word; for all knew the cap and cloak of the jailor, and, sunpecting nothing. they were allowed to pass unmolested. "May Heaven bless you, my noble friend!"   exclaimed Don Garcia, when they had passed all the prison guards; " you have saved melfrom a dreadful death." "You must thank the Donna Ervilla in part for your rescue, Garcia," said Victor, quickly. "The Donna Ervilla!" "Yes, your sister. She came to my house last night, and informed me of your capture. I promised to effect your escape. This morning, I went to the prison, and stated that I desired much to see you, and had a message from your sister. At first they seemed disinclined to grant my request, but I urged that I must see you, and at length they consented. I had the promise of Donna Ervilla that she would be my bride if I succeeded, and love nerved me to accomplish the task." "You are worthy of her, Victor Bertran! I have long known that my sister loved you, by her blushes and confusion when I spoke of you, and I knew that you alone could make her happy." Ere it was discovered that Don Garcia d'Al- esta had escaped, himself, his sister and Victor Bertran were on board the American vessel, and nearly out of sight on the free blue ocean. They arrived safely in New Orleans, no traces having been found of them by their foes in Havana. The beautiful and noble Donna Ervilla was united to Victor Bertran, and their happiness was marred only by the cloud that hung over their'native home, the fair island of Cuba.   [FROM GLEASON'S PICTORIAL DRAWING ROOM COMPANION.] FIRST IMPRESSIONS. BY MRS. S. P. DOUGHTY.   Ci (TTALL you be at Mrs. Lahgdon's this evening, Eliza?" inquired Caroline Westfield, as she oveitook her young friend, Eliza Percival, and arm in arm proceeded with her through the crowded streets of the busy city "It will be the gayest party ot the season." "I shalj probably be there," was the reply. "Mrs. Langdon gives this party in honor of her son's return from Europe. He has been absent sexes al years, and now that he has returned to his native land, she wishes to introduce him to her npmerous friends, particularly to the fair maidens who will grace her rooms this evening." Caroline smiled almost contemptuously, as she replied: "I have already been introduced to Mr. Langdon, but I must confess that he does not equal my expectations. I have heard him spoken of as a very fine young man, but to me he sepns tame and spiritless; wanting in that fire and energy, which is so pleasing in young men." "You prefer a more military chara-'er," re- marked Fliza, in playful allusion to onr f Car- oline's most attentive suitors. "Not at all; but I dislike these remarkably quiet modest -youths, who look as if they had not life enough to raise an alarm if the house was on fire. Depend upon it, Charles Langdon 6  ,   is no valuable acquisition to our circle of ac- quaintance. I shall have as little to say to him as possible." "You may change your opinion, Caroline. You have met him only once." "There is little fear of my changing. I have great faith in first impressions." "They are ofren erroneous, nevertheless," re turnd her friend, "frequently reculting from tlifling prejudices." "I regard them differently, Eliza. I believe that they are given to us by our guardian angels, to warn us of the characters of those with whom we are about to associate." "This may be true in some cnscE, Caroline, but not in all. I am very willing to admit that first impressions may be given to warn us of im- pending danger, but frequently we'imhbibe hasty and unfounded prejudices, which are the result of cur own. false opinions of what constitutes merit, and not the whisperings of attendant spirts," "How do you disti ngush between these two classes of filst i7mpressions,?-for as rcu seem to have thought deeply upon the subject, I am willing to profit by your suggestions," remarked Caroline, smiling. "I fear that I seldom think deelIy," returned her friend; but my mother has always endeavor-    <pb n="86-87" xml:id="VAC6847-00000042"/> ed to prevent me from imbibing prejudices; and it is the lessons which she has taught me which I am now rehearsing for your benefit. The first impressions in which we may confide are those which have no relation to external circum- stances, but without any thought or act on our own part, forcibly present themselves to our mind, even perhaps in contradiction to existing appearances. Let us examine your dislike to Mr. Langdon, and see if it be of this class. In the first place, please tell me what you expected would be his personal appearance, for I presume you have sometimes thought of him, and formed some idea of how he appeared." "I imagined him to be somewhat like his mother," was the prompt reply, " tall and com- manding in his figure, with dark hair and eyes, a noble forehead, Roman nose, and, in short, evelything which constitutes a fine looking man; lively and animated in his conversation, with abundance of good sense, and flashes of wit-the very reverse of what I found him." "I am told that he resembles his father, who died when he was very young," returned Eliza "I am not surprised, Caroline, after hearing your description of the picture you had drawn, that you were disappointed to find a fair and almost effeminate looking youth, with manners as gen tie and unpretending as those of a modest maid- en; but you will a lmit that the disappointment produced your dislike to him. It was not a simple impression received without effort on your part, and must, therefore, be termed preju- dice. If the gentleman in question had realized your expectations, and yet when presented to him, you had conceived instantaneous and deep rooted dislike, I should have classed the impres- sion with those which we are to receive as warn- ings; but in the present case, 1 advise you to hold your judgment suspended " "Your lesson is well repeated, dear Eliza," replied her friend, playfully, "but you might as well tell the wind not to blow, as to advise me to hold my judgment suspended. I like or dis- like at first bight; and have seldom found cause to change." "You are incorrigible, Caroline; and since you despise my warnings, I must leave you to the stern teacher, experience. The day will ,come when you will willingly acknowledge the fallacy of first impressions." Not in regard to Charles Langdon," returned Caroline, as she bade Eliza good morning on the steps of her own home, and the friends parted.   A brilliant assemblage of the beautiful and gay thronged Mrs. Langdon's rooms that eve- ning; but among all the fair young maidens there was none so strikingly lovely as Caroline Westfield. Charles recognized Miss Westnell with pleas- ure as she entered, and his heart warmly re- sponded to the whispered eulogium which his mother pronounced upon her, for Caroline was a general favorite, and Mrs. Langdon had been particularly pleased with her. Having from close attention to his studies, and subsequently, from the hature of the busi- ness in which he was engaged, been almost en- tirely secluded from the society of ladies, the natural reserve and timidity of young Langdon's character was heightened to an almost painful degree, and'it was not without effort that he ventured to approach Caroline, and taking ad- vantage of their former introduction, solicit her hand for the next dance. The haughty coldness of her refusal surprised and pained him. It was evident that he was re- garded with dislike-but wherefore . Surely he had given her no cause for displeasure. Making another effort, he endeavored to draw her into conversation; but finding that his advances were repulsed, he soon. ceased to pay her any atten. tions. ," Why are you not dancing, Caroline '" ex- claimed Miss Percival, as she made her way to the side of her friend. "It is not possible that you were not asked; for, to tell you the truth, even the ladies allow that you are the belle of the evening" "It is provoking to be obliged to sit still," re- plied Caroline, in a low voice, "but I prefer it, to dancing with Mr. Langdon. Unfortunately, he was the first to ask me." "And why not dance with him? Even if I you do not like him, you certainly know noth- ing against his character; and regard for his mother's feelings should induce you to treat him with politeness" "You are right, Eliza," was Caroline's frank reply. "I felt annoyed by his attentions, and repulsed him coldly. I regretted it immediately.- Perhaps I may have another opportunity for doing better." "The gentleman appears almost too reserved to press his attentions where they are not well received; but as you are a favorite of his moth- er's, he may not be so easily repulsed. But there is my partner coming in search of me. I owe him an apology for my long absence."   The evening passed gaily on, and Caroline was too much engrossed with the admiring cir- cle which gathered around her, to feel more than a passing regret for the coldness with which she had received Charles Langdon; and indeed her prejudice against him was increased by the apparent indifference with which he regarded her; for discouraged by the result of his first effort, the young man shrunk from a second trial, although his mother more than once re- monstrated with him, and urged the propriety of his paying particular attention to one who was justly regarded as the particular star of the evening. "She does not need my attentions, mother," was his reply. "Look at the admirers who are already gathered around her. As your son, it is incumbent upon me to see that none are ne glected; therefore, I shall seek out the humble little violets who are scattered about the room. There is one of them," he continued, directing her attention tO a pleasing looking young lady, who remained quiet and apparently unnoticed in the recess of one of the windows. "Come and introduce me to her, mother. She will be more grateful for my efforts to please." "She is a good girl, but not comparable with my friend Caroline; and indeed she can hardly be said to move in the same circle; but I always invite her, for I esteem her parents highly. I will itroduce you, if you wish it, Charles. Her name is Meredith." "Eliza," whispered Caroline to Miss Percival, as she again stood by her friend in the latter part of the evening, "do you notice how very attentive Mr. Langdon is to Susan Meredith? He really looks quite animated. Probably be finds her a very genial companion, for Hhave always thought her remarkably insipid in con-  versation."  "You would not think so if you were better  acquainted with her, Caroline. She is a very  modest, sensible girl, but not quite enough of a  fine lady to attract the butterflies who have been hovering around us all the evening; and for this reason, I presume Mr Langdon singles her a out as the object of his attentions. But see, he g has left her Low and is talking with the English gentleman to whom Mrs. Langdon introduced t us. Mrs. Langdon herself is standing there, and s two or three other elderly ladies. Let us jrin t them for a little while. It will be a relief to i: hear a few, words of sense."       o "If Mr. Langdon is the speaker, I doubt   whether we derive much benefit from  the change," returfed Caroline; bnt she suffered her friend to draw her arm within her own, and gradually they moved nearer to the little group, which had attracted their observation. Charles Langdon did not observe their ap- proach. He was speaking animatedly and with strong good sense of the superiority of a repub- lican government; and endeavoring to convince his English friend how greatly it added to the happiness and welfare of the people. Caroline could enter warmly into his feelings, and she listened with much interest to the lively pictures which he drew of the different effects of Euro- pean and American governments; but with his consciousness of the presence of the two young ladies his usual constrained manner returned, and dropping the conversation which had at- tracted them, he made a few commonplace re- marks upon the common topics of the-day, and soon retreated to another part of the room. Enough, however, had- been said to raise doubts in Caroline's mind as to the justness of the opinion she had formed of him; and in reply to her friend's playful remark that "Mr. Lang- don appeared to consider young ladies as un- worthy listeners to common sense," she involun- tarily expressed a wish that she could have heard more, and did not defend herself very warmly when Eliza accused her of having al- ready abandoned her first impressions. Another hour passed and the gay scene was over, and the weary guests sought their homes. "I have come to- ask you to walk with me, Eliza," said Caroline Westfield, as she entered her friend's apartment several weeks after Mrs. Langdon's party. "You are most welcome, Caroline. My moth- er was just recommending exercise as the best remedy for a slight headache which has troubl,.d me to-day, and I pleaded the want of a com- panion. Now I have no excuse, and in two minutes I will be in readiness " *"Spring is lovely, even in the city," remarked Caroline, as they paused to observe with pleas- are some early flowers in Mr. Percival's little garden. "It is indeed," returned her friend. "(I some. times think that trees and flowers are more itrikingly beautiful in the city, than in the coun- ;ry; they form such a contrast to the surround. ing objects. But which way shall we walk, Car- oline? Not in the busy streets, I hope!" "I fear you will not enjoy the part of the    <pb n="88-89" xml:id="VAC6847-00000043"/> city into which I shall lead you, Eliza; but the pleasure of my company will reconcile you to a disagreeable walk. I am in search of a poor woman whom we have accidentally heard is much in need of assistance. Mother is not well to-day, and has sent me as her representative on this charitable mission." "As the object is a good one, we will endeavor -to enjoy even these dark and miserable looking streets," replied Eliza, as they turned into one of those dismal alleys where the more wretched poor are found congregated together. "There is a great deal done for the poor," said Caroline thoughtfully, as they gazed around on the groups of half naked, squalid looking children who were amusing themselves in front of their miserable dwellings; "but did it ever occur to you, Eliza, that there is little done to raise them above their present condition. I have sometimes thought that if the many small sums which are given by individuals for the im- mediate relief of those who are in want, were appropriated with united effort to enabling them to rise permanently above their present position, it would -not only be far better for them, but would really benefit all classes of society." "There is much truth in what you say, Caro- line; and it is somewhat remarkable that I heard the same sentiments expressed by Mr. Langdon, yesterday. He is exceedingly interested in both public and private charities." "I am glad that ho is interested in anything," returned Caroline, smiling. "With the exception of that one brilliant sally which our presence so abruptly ended on the evening of the party, I have never discovered that he could think or converse on any subject. My first impressions concerning him have been fully confirmed." "And my belief that you are mistaken has been fully confirmed, also, Caroline. My brother is intimate with Charles Langdon, and I have therefore had many opportunities of observing hi-n. I am convinced that, although he may be deficient in some qualities which attract our ad- miration, he has more real good sense and in- trinsic worth of character, than most of our more showy acquaintance. %Vere not my own heart and Sand already pledged, I do not think I should thus exert myself to gain your good opinion for him." "Perhaps not," answered Caroline, laughing- ly; " but even if you were free, I would willingly promise not to interfere with you. I must wed some one to whom I can look up as to a being superior to myself."   "You aspire to a union with one possessed of rare talents, Caroline. But real goodness is more to be reverenced; and that I believe Mr. Langdon to possess. But do look at that little girl on the opposite side. What a singularly lovely countenance." The child's appearance was indeed sufficiently striking to attract the attention of the most care- less observer. Her dress, although it bespoke extreme poverty, was perfectly clean and well arranged, forming a strong contrast to that of the group who surrounded her; Her face pos- sessed almost unearthly beauty; and few at a first glance would have suspected that those deep blue eyes reflected no image to the souli but it was even thus-she was blind. It was plain, also, that she was in very feeble health; for one of the elder girls around her supported her while she exchanged her seat for one more sheltered from the sun; and even the trifling exertion of moving this short distance, appeared exhausting. As Caroline and her friend drew near, they heard her say in a voice of touching sadness: "I am growing weaker, Ellen; and I know that I shall soon leave this world. I am not afraid to die. My Heavenly Father loves me, and I love to go to him. But O, it is hard to die in this close confined place, where the very air we breathe is impure and oppressive. If I could but draw my last breath in the country, where I could hear the music of the birds, and smell the sweet wild flowers, I should have noth- ing more to ask. Perhaps you think it is all alike to me, as I cannot see what is around me; but O, the country is very dear to me!l The sound of -that little brook that leaps so gaily through the meadow near where we used to live, or the breath of those sweet violets which mother used to gather for me, would make me forget all my pain." "The blind .girl must be the daughter of the woman I am in search of," whispered Caroline. "I was told that she had a sick child ;" and ad- vancing a few steps, she inquired if Mrs. Lewis lived there. "She does, ma'am, but she has stepped out," was the reply. "Mother will be in very soon," said the blind girl, turning her face in the direction from which Caroline's voice proceeded. "Will the lady please to walk in and wait for her?" and assisted by Ellen she led the way into a small, scantily i fuaished, but perfectly neat room, and request-   ing the ladies to be seated, repeated her assur- ance that her mother would soon be in. Some kind friend had provided a comfortable easy chair for the invalid, and it was pleasing to watch the changes of her speaking countenance as she reclined her head against a pillow, and answered the various questions which were asked by her young visitors. Her simple tale was soon told. She had al- ways been blind. Her father was an honest la- boring man, and had done everything for her comfort and happiness until his death, which took place nearly two years before. Until then they lived in the country, where, to use her own expression, she could listen to the singing-birds, and talk to the sweet flowers, which seemed to her like dearly loved friends; but after his death, her mother found it impossible to gain a support in the neighborhood where she lived, and they therefore removed to the city, where there seem- ed a better prospect of employment. Things had gone against them, however, and within a few months her health had failed rapidly. During all the time that she was speaking, Caroline observed that the child held fast clasped in her hand a small pocket testament, and taking it gently from her, she said: "You cannot see to read this book, my dear little girl; why then do you hold it so tightly in your hand?" "It is the Book of Life, ma'am; and it is a comfort to me to feel it near me. The good young gentleman who reads it to me, saw how happy it made me to have it in my hand; and so he kindly'gave it to me for my own. Every night I pray to the Lord to bless him." "As she spoke, Caroline had opened the little volume, and as her eye accidentally rested on the blank leaf, she saw the name of Charles Langdon. With a deep blush, she handed the book to Eliza, saying in a voice trembling with emotion, "This discovery would certainly seem to confirm your good opinion of him, for there are indeed few of our fashionable young men who would be found reading the Word of the Lord, to the poor and blind." A reply was prevented by the entrance of Mrs. Lewis, who, after respectfully greeting her visitors, affectionately kissed her daughter, in- quiring how she had felt daring her absence. "Better than yesterday, dear mother. I have been telling these kind ladies all about dear father, and our pleaset country home."   "The dear child loves the country," said the good woman, wiping a tear from her eye; then turning again to her daughter, she said: I have good news to tell you, dear Mary, if you will promise to be very calm and quiet when you hear what it is." "I will try, mother. Tell me now, for these good ladies will love to hear it too." "The kind gentleman, Mr. Langdon, who has been to see you so often lately, has found a pleasant place in the country where they will take us to board; and he has promised to see that we want for nothing. To-morrow, if the doctor thinks you are strong enough, we shall remove to our new home." The blind girl remembered her promise to be calm, but the extreme joy depicted in her coun- tenance, the earnest manner in which she clasped her hands, told her feelings more than the words which burst from her lips. "O, mother, mother! can it be true that I am to leave this dreary place, and feel the pure fresh air fan my cheek once more? I have prayed so earnestly that I might die among the birds and flowers, and God has heard my prayer?' Much affected by this simple scene, the young ladies rose to depart, feeling that the mother and daughter would prefer being alone; and with a few words of sympathy, both in her sor- row and in her joy, Caroline placed a sum in Mrs. Lewis's hands, which would enable her to obtain many little luxuries for the invalid, and promising to see them in their new home- which was not many miles distant from the city -bade them farewell. As the friends passed hastily through the nar- row streets, anxious to reach a more desirable part of the 6ity, and conversing with much in- terest of the lovely blind girl,they were startled by a loud alarm of fire in the direction in which they were walking; and as they turned * corner they saw the flames burst from a house at a short distance, which was apparently occupied by sev- eral families, who were endeavoring to rescue their little property from the devouring element. The first thought was to avoid the noise and confusion attendant upon such a scene; but as they turned away, their attention was irresistibly attracted by a wild shriek of despair from a woman who had just joined the crowd: "My child! my child I I left her in the third story of the building! Must she perish in the flames?" and breaking from those who would have held her, she was about to rush into the    <pb n="90-91" xml:id="VAC6847-00000044"/> house which it had already become too danger- ous to approach, when a young man sprung to- wards. her, and forcing her back, exclaimed: "I will rescue your child if she still lives;" and in an instant was hid from view in the burning building. "He will perish!" exclaimed Eliza, as trans- fixed to the spot, she gazed earnestly at the place where the young man had disappeared. "In a vain attempt to save the life of another, he will lose hiown!" The silencedo her companion surprised her  and turning around, she beheld Caroline white as marble, with-her eyes also fixed eagerly upon the clouds of smoke and sheets of flame which were now all that was visible. "It was Charles Langdon," she said in a low husky voice, as her friend seized her arm and demanded the cause of her strange emotion. "His poor mother. Her whole life seems cen- tered in him." A few moments only elapsed-but they seem- ed like hours-and the brave young man rushed from the flames, with the child in his arms. Hastily retreating from the thanks of the mother, and the applause of the crowd, he en- countered the two young ladies who had been so anxiously observing him. A momentary glance was sufficient to con- vince him that they were aware of the danger he had encountered, and had been excited and alarmed by the scene; and with kind politeness he begged leave to accompany them home, as they might be somewhat annoyed by the rude mob which thronged the narrow street. "You have caused us great alarm, Mr. Lang- don," remarked Miss Percival, as they slowly made their way through the crowd. "It was a brave act. But was it quite right to risk your own life for the child of a stranger?" "My feelings would not allow me to do oth- erwise, Miss Percival. How could I think of myself, when an innocent child was in danger of so horrible a death?" "But the remembrance of your mother. Had not that power to restrain you i" "She has ever inculcated upon me the duty of serving my fellow-creatures to the utmost of my ability. We must not shrink from duty, but, trusting in an overruling Providence, go boldly forward." As the young man spoke, he caught the ex- pression of Caroline's countenance, and he felt that she approved of his sentiments and warmly   sympathized with his feelings; and he also felt that the indifference and almost contempt with which she had appeared to regard him had dis- appeared. Little conversation passed between them, how- ever; and at Mr. Percival's door he bade them farewell, as Caroline was to pass the evening with her friend. Months passed away, and the time fixed for the marriage of Eliza Percival to one who had long possessed her affections, drew near. "And you are to be my bridesmaid, dear Car- oline," she said, after a long consultation with her friend upon certain necessary arrangements preliminary to the important event. "I cannot refuse you, dear Eliza," replied Car- oline; " but I had almost hoped that your mar- riage would be deferred a little longer, that I might request a similar favor of you." Why, Caroline l" was the astonished excla- mation of her friend. "Why have you never told me this before? Who is the happy man? Not Charles Laugdon, surely " she added, as she watched the expression of Caroline's blush- ing countenance. 'And why not Charles Langdon? I thought he was a favorite of yours, Eliza?" "So he is. But have you forgotten your' first impressions,' Caroline? Is it possible that you intend to marry that 'tame, spiritless young man "' "Spare me your jests, Eliza. I have long since been convinced of my folly. From the moment I saw his name in that little testament which I drew from the hand of the blind girl, I have felt his superiority, and wondered at my own blindness." "By the way, Caroline," asked Eliza, sudden- ly, " what became of that blind girl?" "She died some months ago," returned her friend. "You were in the country at the time, or I should have recollected to have told you. I visited her once, with Mr. Langdon; and it was beautiful to witness the gratitude and joy which she seemed to feel that she was permitted to end her drays in the country" "She was a lovely creature," remarked Eliza. ' And now, dear Caroline, receive my warmest congratulations. I am convinced that you have chosen wisely; for he to whom you have given your affections, possesses those qualities which can alpue ensure happiness-strong good sense, earnest piety and an unceasing desire to minister to the happiness of his fellow-beings."   [FROM GLEASON'S PICTORIAL DRAWING-ROOM COMPANION.] TIM TILBURY'S VISION: BY GEO CAN NI A ANG HLL. BY GEO. CANNING HLL.   N a dark and dingy counting-room, on one of the lower streets of the metropolis, near the water, there was a little, dapper-looking man, standing before a desk. His head was partially bald, and over his ear rested a quill pen; a huge ledger lay outspread upon the desk, and leaning upon his palms, he was busily engaged in poring over its contents. His face was of a small cast decidedly, and his eyes bore a becoming proportion to the size of his features. They were small, piercing and gray. They were made to move with great ac- tivity and great precision; neither was there often a moment when they were at rest upon any particular object. Even at the time when. we introduce him to the reader's attention, al though he appeared absorbed in reflection, they were restlessly moving from the top to the bot- tom of the page, and sometimes shooting off in a tangent towards the window or the stove. He wore a long-tailed blue dress coat, orna- mented with plain brass buttons. His bosom was very neat and prim, looking as if it were never suffered to wrinkle, or even to know what such conduct was. About his neck he wore a pretty high white cravat, that supported a dickey of very much more than ordinary pretensions. Its points ever threatened to pierce through his nose, and to meet beneath his eyes. But some-   how they did not, and he kept up the wearing of them with great regularity and precision. Suddenly he looked up from the page on which his eye had been rolling and revelling so long, and eyeing a young man who stood on the wall side of the desk-it was a double one-and in the farther corner, he quickly spoke to him: "James, you can go to your dinner now; but be back early, I want you here soon again." "Yes sir," replied the young man addressed. He must have been about nineteen or twenty years old, and it was not difficult even for a very near-sighted person to see that he was,in one respect, a sort bof second edition of his master. That is to say, he wore, or tried to get into, an old broadcloth coat, that had once belonged to Mr. Timothy Tilbury-brass buttons and all- and upon which that little gentleman still felt that he had a strong lien in law. His vest was 'likewise a cast off of that individual, which he had seemingly shed for the special encasement of his youthful book-keeper and confidential clerk. He bad the general appearance of one very much in want of the little, easy at-the elbow comforts of life, and yet his countenance was marked with an expression of singular intelli- gence, if not of beauty. He looked as if he bore all his servitude merely because he was obliged to. There be very many more just like him,    <pb n="92-93" xml:id="VAC6847-00000045"/> They are in work shops, and hidden away in dingy garrets, as well as in damp, and,forbid- ding, and gloomy counting-rooms. As soon. s young James Mason-for that was the name of the clerk-had heard these very ac- oeptable words, he shut up the "blotter," upon which he happened to be engaged, and taking his hat-an old one of Mr. Tim Tilbury's-from the adjacent peg, started for the door. He had scarcely gone frotn the room, when his merchant master turned the key in the lock, and threw himself down in one of the huge, leathern- seated chairs, that stood so invitingly on either side of the stove. Placing the tips of the fingers of each hand in juxtaposition, he looked through them, as through a screen, at the glowing coals, and began to calculate. ' Now there's his salary," said he,-"I mean James's salary; now he's a good boy, and always has been, particularly when he doesn't make mistakes; but I don't think he ought to have his salary raised, this year. And what's still more (may the recording angel drop a tear on bhis sta emcnt of Mr. Tilbury), I aint able to raise his salary. It's all pay out-pay out, now; but It does n't seem to me as if there was any pay in -no pay is! No, no; it wont do for me. The boy mustn't be allowed to think of it. He has quite enough for his own good, now. More might do him a serious injury, and undoubtedly would. He must stay content with what he has for another year. If somebody has been putting this idea of a rise of salary into his head, why- he must get somebody to take it out again ;" and with these words still lingering on his lips,-he settled himself into a more deeply comfortable attitude, and fell into a train of reflection whereof we are totally unable to glean, or to presume, a single iota. The gradation from silence to slumber, when he was in the proper attitude, as in this instance, was always short and sudden with Mr Tim Til- bury; and in a few minutes his head had fallen over upon the back of his chair, and his hitherto upraised hands hung motionless from the ends of its arms. Active as his waking 6rain usually was upon such things as dollars and trade, there was no magician to wave his wand over it while he slept, and crowd it with visions of glittering coins, promptly-paid notes, big drafts in his own favor, or the hurry of trade. His own will was obliv- ious of its venal powers, and other influences- winged and inexplicable influences-set in mys- teriously upon him.   He dreamed of being led along by some un] seen companion, whose presence he could con- tinually feel, through long and devious streets in which thronged hundreds and even thousands of human beings, through dusky alleys, scarce frequented at all, down long lanes, across which high, old gabled houses seemed trying to strike ea,:h others' heads, and along winding quays, over which the cold winds of winter swept with- out let or hindrance. At times he felt as if he would stop short and take a more deliberate sur vey of what was about him; but the unseen companion pulled the harder on his hand, and whispered to him in a gentle Voice, but still in a tone that made him all obedience-"'Come!" On and on he travelled, now grown almost regardless of where he was, or whither his jour- ney tended. He tripped frequently over the pavements, and would have stumbled to the ground but for the always ready assistance of his friendly companion. Once or twice he essayed to speak to him or her, whichever it might be, but he suddenly felt a finger placed firmly upon his lips, and the injunction was not allowed to pass unheeded by him. He kept on his walk in silence. By and by he came to a very narrow and very dirty street-it might much more consistently have been called a lane-whose four and five story houses looked as if they could none of them have stood alone, and whose exteriors were excessively dingy and faded. It was evidently a place for the residence of poorer people, where they herded as a separate society, unable and unwilling to stand by the side of their more for- tunate fellows. In the basements of some of the buildings there were low rooms that were used for shops, for retailing such small and scanty second hand wares as could be bought and sold again for a trifling sum. Decaying oranges and lean bits of broken candy adorned the windows, be- fore which graceless and noisy urchins paused to contemplate the temptations, and then heartily wish them theirs. It was just at nightfall, and the street looked dismal indeed. There were no sights within it that reminded one either of life or activity. An incubus sat upon the spirits of Mr. Tilbury, and he thought that he pressed his hand upon his left breast, and breathed long and heavily. "Come " agaih whispered the voice of the unseen person. He went into a low and narrow door, stooping   and stepping down in order to do so, and at once found himself alone in a dreary entry. A sud- den gust of wind flirted itself in after him, and stung his nose and cheeks until he laid his hand protectingly upon them. Ha pushed on straight to a door he observed at the farther end of the entry, and opened it. There was a room before him, and people were in it; but they heeded not his entrance; they did not even observe him. The room was but poorly, though studiously furnished, having no carpet upon the floor, and a bed in its farther corner. There wasa plain pine table placed in the middle of it, before the very small stove, and supper spread thereon A woman, not yet arrived at the middle age, stood over the table, arranging in her mind the most appropriate positions for the different plates, little enough as each one of them held upon it. ., From the table she looked at the stove, from which issued thin steams that might have been very savory had there been material suffi- cient to produce decided savors, and then she looked over towards the bed in the corner. Fi- nally she laid down the knife and fork she held in her hand, and approached the bedside. "Do you feel hungry, Tommy?" asked she of the invalid, bending over him, and speaking in a low and musical voice. "Yes, mother," returned the child-he was a mere boy of nine or ten years-"I am hungry, but I can do without till in the evening. I do not need to eat as much as brother James and you do, for I do not have to work; I only have to lay here, day after day." "But you ought to eat something, Tommy," said the mother, while a tear struggled to her eye. "No, no, mother; do not worry so for me. What are you crying now for, mother?" "To think that I have nothing in the house to eat, that will make you strong again i" and the tears came thicker and faster, until they coursed down her cheeks like rain. "Do not cry so, mother! I beg you, do not cry for thinking of me!" protested little Tom- my, his own eyes moistening with salt tears, wrung from his very heart. "But I have nothing to buy you anything with, either, Tommy. I have no money myself, and James does n't know when he can get any more. All we've got to eat in the house is what's on the table, yonder; and here it is the last of December, and Christmas close at hand! Poor-poor Tommy!" "Yet I can bear it all quite as well as you,    :e mother," repeated the manly little fellow, who I- had lain in bed so long-a mere cripple. "l an d bear it all, for I may not have long to live, you d know; but James and you will be obliged to It 'work hard. Shall I not be less trouble to you, e mother, when I am dead!' e   "Child! child!" exclaimed she, in deep an- t guish, throwing her arms about his wasted form and pressing her hot lips to his white forehead, V "child of mine! do not talk so! You grieve 1 your mother'sheart beyond endurance! Come, I be calm again. Do not talk or think of such a thing as your leaving us. What should we do without little Tommy? Who would be our lit- , tie boy for us to talk with, when Jamie comes home at night, and he and I sit by the stove in t th3 middle of the room!" '- But I should n't be such a care for you then," , persisted the boy. "Care! you are anything but a care, my son; you are a delight to me. When my heart would murmur at its lot, and repine that everything is not as it might be, your sweet face meets me and I at once grow contented and happy. I see you enduring, in Ferfect silence, so much more than the pains of mere poverty, that I feel rebuked at my own dissatisfied feelings, and try to grow better-more like you, child. No indeed; I could not endure the thought of your leaving us. O, you can never know the bonds by which we are bound to you, my child!-no, never!" The little invalid at this point threw up his arms, and his mother leaned down for his em- brace. It was truly affectionate, and the tears of the parent fell upon the cheek of the child, and mingled with his own. "Look there, man of gold!" whispered the mysterious voice in the ear of the nearly over come Mr. Tilbury. Just at that moment the door of the apart ment opened again, and a person entered. It was a young man, dressed in an obsolete, if not a downright grotesque style, and he appeared fatigued with rapid walking. Laying his hat in a chair, he advanced to the bedside of the child and inquired most affection- ately for his health, endeavoring to invigorate his spirits with a few half playful words. But the mother stood by his side, and said to the young man: "Ha says he is hungry, and I have nothing that he can eat in the house." "Poor Tommy!" exclaimed the young man, fetching a deep sigh, and brushing back the    <pb n="94-95" xml:id="VAC6847-00000046"/> straggling locks from the marble-white forehead of the boy. "What shall I do?" asked the woman, look- ing very earnestly in the young man's eyes. "I don't know, mother," replied he, mourn- fully. "I'm sure I don't know. I only wish I did-but I don't!" Mother and son then walked towards the middle of the room, and the latter sat down to the spread table. The former began to peal some half dozen shrunken little potatoes, while he began with a carving knife to scrape and hew off from a couple of large bones meat enough to fill two mouths at once; but he nearly despaired of doing even that much towards creating a din- ner out of nothing. "Never mind me! never mind me!" said the mother; "I can make a dinner off this potato and a little bread. Do you eat the meat; you need it. You have to work, and walk a great ways, and stand up all day, too. You need meat; it makes you strong; it helps you to do your work the better for your master. Eat it-eat it all, Jamie," said she, drawing away her plate just as he would thrust all upon it. "But I don't see as we can do any better for ourselves, another year, mother," said he, look ing up at her with a most mournful expression. ': Why not, son?" inquired she. "Have you heard anything yet? Has Mr. Tilbury said any- thing yet about it, James?" "Look there, and listen!' whispered the voice, fearfully, in his ears. Tim Tilbury felt that he was trembling, at the moment, from very excitement and fear. "Yes, mother," said James, "he has said some- thing about it." "And what was that?" asked she. "He thought he was n't able to raise my sal- ary any, for another year." The woman fetched a deep sigh, but no sylla- ble escaped her lips. "I'm sure, continued James, "I should try to make myself worth as much more to Mr. Tilbury as I could; and I hope he doesn't think the mop-  c gives me now, to be altogether thrown away." "That's what I hope you do! ,I hope you do try to be faithful, Jamie; and how can I believe that you are not? Only keep right on your side; I have no doubt that even Mr. Tilbury will, at some day, do you ample justice" "Do you hear that, Tim Tilbury?" whispered the voice. The sound was so close to his ear oor man fancied he felt the warm   breath from his mysterious companion's lips upon his cheek. "Yes, mother, I try to be honest, and I en- deavor to give no cause of complaint to him. Sometimes I think he is very hard with me; and then at once I think of what you have often told me-that I may be too impatient myself; and then I think it is all right, and so I try to school myself. But all that makes me so anx- ious is, the fear that poor little Tommy may not be as well another year; you know he wants a great many more things each year, and he needs more comforts than he has now. That is all that saddens my heart. I believe that we could live as we do decently enough, and never re- pine; but poor Tommy is an invalid-a cripple, bedridden and feeble. He needs all that we can save for him; and if I cannot earn enough to lay away a single dollar through the whole year, how is he to fare any better? Why mst n't he suffer, mother?" "I think so myself, James, and I am greatly perplexed. Yet it will not do for us to be dis- contented or fretful.. Therel are those who suf- fer far more than we do." "But I must hurry back," interrupted the young man; and he rose hastily from his seat, crossed the room, imprinted a kiss on the fore- head of little Tommy, and in another moment was gone. "Do you see all this? do you hear it all, Tim Tilbury?" came that fearful voice again in his ears. There was a thundering upon the door of the cotinting-room of the dapper little merchant, and he suddenly awoke. "Ho!" said he, aloud; "I've been asleep, haven't I?" and he sprang to the door to turn the key back again. James Mason, his clerk, entered. "Here, James," said the little merchant, "I have concluded to increase your wages a hun- dred dollars the coming year; and here, I will till you a check for the first quarter of it in r adv ince." The young man's eyes opened wide with as- tonishment; but he took the proffered check with many thanks, and folding it away carefully in his vest pocket, went about the remainder of e his day's work with a vigilance and alacrity he had never felt inclined to before. t  Tim Tilbury's heart had grown larger. From that day he was an altered man; and he never i lived to regret the generous advance he had r made upon the salary of his faithful young book a' keeper.   [FROM GLEASON'S PICTORIAL DRAWING-ROOM COMPANION.] OAKLAWN HGH SCHOOL. BY MRS. E. C. LOVERING.   7HE advantages of education were hardly appreciated by the honest inhabitants of Oaklawn. These good people thought that if their children obtained some slight knowledge of the rudiments of grammar, that would enable them to write intelligible letters, and a sufficient insight into arithmetic to make them ready reckoners of dollars and cents, no farther ac- quirements were desirable, in the business of buying and selling, laboring and obtaining the wages of toil, which, in the popular mind, should constitute the main occupation of life. Consequently Mr. Luther Livingston com- mitted a great error, when he established the ' Oaklawn High School," on the supposition that he would meet with vi, "-ous support. It is true, some half dozen in-uential men had promised him their patronage, for there were a few wealthy inhabitants, who desired that their daughters should be accomplished, and their sons become members of liberal professions; but the high hopes encouraged by the promises of these men, were altogether unfounded. Luther Livingston was a young man of fine talents, and a thorough education. In disposi- tion he was mild and thoughtful, and he pos sessed a perfect command over his passions. In personal appearance he was interesting, even prepossessing, without having the least preten-   sions to beauty. He was a spare man, a little bent, with a brow wrinkled at thirty, large eyes, which had been injured by intense application to books, and a pale, intellectual face, which was the true index of as pure and' noble a mind as ever lost itself from the world, on classic ground. The great fault in Mr. Livingston's character was too great fondness for: quiet and study, and too little enterprise and ambition. Luther had married, some two or three years previous to the date of my story, a worthy girl, of excellent family, contrary to the wir is of her parents. But she had chosen him ana poverty, in preference to a more brilliant match; and although her determination had deprived her of the affections of her friends, in devoting herself to the happiness of him she loved, she did not iegret her choice. No misfortunes-nothing save a separation-could have occasioned this couple much unhappiness, so great was their love, and such perfect bliss did they enjoy in each other's society. Lizzie, who had received an excellent educa- tion, was anxious to assist her husband, and it was with her warmest approbation that he un- dertook the Oaklawn school.  His principal patron, who owned a house that had been vacant more than a year, generously offered to fit it up to answer the double purpose of a dwelling and    <pb n="96-97" xml:id="VAC6847-00000047"/> school house, and rent it at a reasonable rate The Livingstons moved into it, in the month of August, and the school was advertised to com- mence on the first of September. Such a commencement! Although it was a high school, Oaklawn actually looked down upon it! The modest announcement, that Mr. L would be happy to teach young gentlemen Latin. Greek, and mathematics, and prepare them for college; and that Mrs. L. proposed to finish young ladies in music, French, drawing, and ether polite branches, raised the cry of humbug. If, in addition to this, Mr. Livingston had hap yened to be an Unitarian, Universalist, or any thing but Presbyterian, he would assuredly have been mobbed! As it was, he was only pitied and laughed at. Ils enterprise was the subject of many a bad joke; and even serious deacons drily insinuated that there was danger of Billings's creek being burnt up by the energy of the schoolmaster! The Livingstons were too much absorbed by their honest endeavors to do good, and obtain a livelihood, to feel greatly disturbed by the ex- pressed opinions of Oaklawn. They commenced their school. Luther found himself with five young gentlemen under his care. Lizzie had two young ladies-seven pupils, it appeared, were all Oaklawn could afford. But the hopes of the Livingstons were not yet destroyed. "A fair commencement, a fair commencement, after all," -said Luther, dn the evening of the first day, as he sat down by Lizzie's side, in their cozy little parlor. '"Our establishment is yet in its infancy. As soon as it becomes known be- yond the narrow limits of Oaklawn, we shall have something besides day pupils. I think we may safely count upon twenty boarders; and with about twenty other pupils, who will come in from Oaklawn, as soon as they see how affairs progress, we shall make a good thing of it. But everything cannot be done at once; and patience is a great virtue" The first quarter, however, did not witness so much improvement. True, several young men, disgusted with the stupidity of the man, who taught reading, writing, and arithmetic in the district school, went to study the common branches under Mr. Livingston, and Lizzie re- ceived a reinforcement, from a similar cause, of three girls-but Luther was addicted to the weakness-in a worldly point of view- of doing other people favors, without considering his   own interests; and in this silly way he lost sev- eral pupils. There was a youth of superior tal- ent in Oaklawn, who worked at a farm-house for his board, arid ardently desired to go to Mr. Livingston's school, although he had not a dol- lar in the world. With his customary gener- osity, Luther received him, gratuitously He became the first scholar in his class; unfortu- nately, perhaps; for envy and jealousy ensued, and certain young men, indignant at being sur- passed by a " charity boy," as James Willett was named, withdrew from the school. Thus "affairs progressed" discouragingly, until the latter part of December. The Livings- tons were at that time exceedingly poor. As yet, they had -no boarders, and they lived in the most snug manner. One day, when the ground was frozen and barren of snow, a middle-aged gentleman, plainly dressed, was riding through Oaklawn, in a chaise, when a number of young barbarians, from the district school, maliciously conspired to frighten his horse, and succeeded so well, that the vehicle was broken against the fence, and the rider thrown out, while the terrified animal escaped and ran furiously past the building oc- cupied by the Oaklawn high-school. Fortunately the traveller was not seriously injured. Rising from the ruins of his chaise, he set out to follow his horse, even over the frozen ground. At this time, James Willett, the "charity boy," who, on his way to the afternoon school, had made a vain attempt to arrest the progress of the frightened horse, hurried to Mr. Livingston, with intelligence of what had taken place. "Is the man hurt?" cried the warm-hearted schoolmaster, looking for his hat. "Not badly, I should say," replied the youth. "He is on his feet, and coming this way. He was only thrown from 'his carriage-' excussus cur-ru.  "Good!" exclaimed Mr. Livingston, highly pleased with the boy's apt quotation. "I see you read Virgil, to remember him. You must pursue the noble course you have chosen, my boy, in spite of adverse fortune. But let us now see what we can do for the broken chaise." By the time Mr. Livingston had found his hat, and reached the road, the traveller's horse had been caught, and the traveller himself was surrounded by half the male inhabitants of Oak- lawn! Curiosity was alive, and grown men and school boys were enjoying the highway tragedy.   "There must be a hotel near?" said the trav- eller, addressing the crowd. "There's one just opposite my shop," replied the village blacksmith, who, of course, expected the job of mending the chaise. "But 'twont be of no use to go there," added the man. "It's been shut up since the liquor law passed. A temperance house wouldn't pay." "Then there is no public house kept in this place?" said the traveller, with an irritated and perplexed air. "No-not now!" "How far is it to one?" "Beout six miles." The traveller's brows gathered, and he looked savagely for the boys, who had frightened his horse. After a pause, he demanded of the smith: "And how long will it take you to mend my -chaise?" "Get it done some time to-morrow, I should think." "This hotel business is unfortunate," muttered the traveller, recovering his equanimity. "Can any of the gentlemen inform me where I can obtain food and shelter for myself and horse?" The schoolmaster was on the point of answer ing; but the thought of the poor accommoda- tions his house afforded deterred him. Besides, he thought that either Deacon Wolcott, or 'Squire Holmes, who were present, would be forward in proffering the hospitality of their spacious dwellings. No one spoke, h'wever- and Luther, knowing the stranger's perplexity, hesitated no longer. "I have nothing sumptuous to offer you," said he, "but my house is near by; and if you can be satisfied with what I have, you shall be welcome." "Sir," replied the stranger, pressing his hand, "anything offered by kindness will be gratefully received. I prize a little humanity more highly than the greatest luxuries!" The schoolmaster, having spoken to 'Squire Holmes aside, said: "This gentleman will make room for your horse in his stable. James Willett will lead him over." The traveller thanked Lather for his kindness, and having made arrangements with the smith, for mending his chaise, accompanied Mr. Liv- ingston home. "You must not expect to find my house pro- vided with the comforts of an inn," said Luther, on the way. "I have been trying to get along    here, tea-hing the classics and mathematics, but I have not made a very promising beginning, and have not been able to furnish my house as I could desire." The traveller's eyes sparkled. "You teach the classics!" Luther acknowledged his calling. "Give me your hand again!" exclaimed the stranger. "I honor your profession I feel myself fortunate in having met you, at this time!" "You are then a scholar, I presume?" The traveller replied with the scholar's coun- tersign-a Greek quotation; and from that mo- ment, he and Mr. Livingston were on terms of friendship. They conversed about the writers of antiquity; and at length the time for the afternoon school to commence, being already past, Luther went into his school-room, whilst his new acquaintance went to pay a visit-to his horse, in his new quarters. In a little while the traveller returned, and passed more than an hour in the school-room, appearing to take great interest in Luther's method of teaching, which he highly commended. Afterwards, choosing a worn copy of Horace, from the schoolmaster's small library, he retired to the parlor, where he remained alone, until his host was once more at liberty. In the course of the conversation, the traveller said: "  I see, plainly, that you are not appreciated in this region. Oaklawn appears to be a barren region for the classics; and I am tempted to ask why you are here-' cur te in his ego conspicor regionibus?'" "I settled here, without knowing what abun- 'dant ignorance I should have to contend against," replied Luther. "Oaklawn certainly despises the classics. The inhabitants regard my wife and me, with looks, which seem to say, 'Fures estis ambo "They consider that to teach anything but reading and spelling, is to live dis- honestly. We are pointed at, as children of the evil one; and although I care little for the sneers of the rude multitude, Mrs. Livingston finds it very unpleasant to be so prominent an object of remark-' digitis vulgi designari,' as Ovid has it." At that moment, Mrs. Livingston came and whispered in her husband's ear: "What should they have for supper?" Luther, impressed with reverence for the learning of his guest, blushed to think they had nothing to set before him.    <pb n="98-99" xml:id="VAC6847-00000048"/> "No eggs . "All gone," said Lizzie. "Then that bit of ham will do." ' But we ate the last of that, yesterday." "O, we shall be obliged then to make out with the boiled pork." "You forget, Luther, that we got the ham, because we had consumed the last of the pork." "And are there no sausages?" -' Not a link Luther actually groaned. The stranger, who had overheard enough of this conversation to know what it was about, entreated Mrs. L. to give herself not the least trouble on his account; upon which, Luther de- sired that he would make himself easy on that score, adding, that it was quite an usual thing for his wife to consult him on the choice of del- icacies for the table! Shortly after, the schoolmaster, naving spoken with Lizzie aside, made an excuse to leave the house; and in a little while, the stranger, wish- ing to see that his horse was well bestowed for the night, walked leisurely to 'Squire Holme3's barn. Whilst giving the 'Squire's man direction about-feeding Old Gray (accompanying his les- son with a piece of silver, to fix it in the man's memory), the traveller heard a marvellous tu- mult among the feathered tribe in the yard; and going to the barn door to learn what all the cackling wBas about, beheld a sight which so ex- cited his sense of the ludicrous, that he could, with difficulty, refrain from violent laughter. There was Mr. Luther Livingston, of the Oak- lawn High School, with a broomstick in his hand, chasing a frightened brood of chickens, and laying about him as furiously as Don Quixote, in his valorous attack on the flock of sheep, which he mistook for an army of giants! But the fowls appeared too active for the schoolmaster's onslaught. More than once, hav- ing aimed destruction at the neck of a fat chick en and missed-his mark, the broomstick struck the frozen ground, and so made the palm of his hand tingle with the jar, that he felt constrained to stop and rub it to lessen the pain; thus giving the persecuted brood time to rally and seek places of shelter. At length, however, having driven two deserted chickens to a corner under the shed, Luther popped them over, and wrung their necks in triumph. At that moment he turned, and with huge astonishment and dismay, beheld the good-humored stranger, standing be- fore him, laughing at his exploits I   Under the circumstances, Luther thought It best to laugh with him; and facetiously repeat- ing sublime passages from Homer, descriptive of the valor of his heroes in battle, and applica- ble in a ludicrous sense to the schoolmaster's attack on the fowls, the two returned to the house, to relate what had happened ,to Lizzie, and to deliver over to her the chickens obtained of 'Squire Holmes. As the traveller had for dinner taken only a luncheon, consisting of bread and dried beef-- which Mrs. Livingston had placed before him- it was her husband's intention to have the fowls for supper i but the guests opposed the arrange- ment-as it would take the chickens so long to cook and insisted that he could sup as he had dined, with great satisfaction. Lizzie according- ly made a fine cup of tea, and the traveller and his new friends sat down to a table spread with nice biscuit, butter and slices of dried beef. On the following morning, the idea of chickens for breakfast aroused the schoolmaster earlier than usual; and on looking at the windows he was surprised to see them loaded with snow. And it wag storming still, he could see, by the fast falling flakes which filled the air. Looking out, he observed that the ground was deeply covered. The wind appeared to be rising, too; and heavy drifts were forming in the road, and under bars of fences. The traveller was not a little disconcerted by the unexpectedness of this storm. Instead of being arrived at his journey's end, he found him- self besieged by the storm, thirty miles from home  However, he endeavored to make the best of his misfortunes i and seating himself by Lizzie's blazing hearth (wood in Oaklawn was plenty and cheap), he resolved to enjoy a rare old volume he found in the bookcase, whilst Luther was giving his morning hours to the four boys who' came wallowing through the snow to school. All that day and the following night the storm continued. Drifts, shoulder deep, filled all the roads i and there was no stirring in Oak- lawn out of doors, except when the farmers dug through the embankments to their farms. Only Luther's four persevering pupils broke through the drifts piled around the house, that day. To explore Oaklawn for provisions, was out of the question. As soon as the last bones of the chickens were picked, only bread and dried beef remained. Luther was deeply mortified; but as he could not help it, and as his gdest de-   dlared himself well entertained, he resolved to think as little of the embarrassment as possible. The following morning broke like the dawn of an eternal Sabbath. The earth seemed to sleep in calmness and purity, serene and white,! Not a breath of air'stirred. The sun smiled on the immense drifts and fields of snow, from the clear, cold eastern sky. Not a sign of life was visible outside the walls of the school-house. But towards noon, Oaklawn manifested a dis- position to " dig out." First a sleigh appeared, following half a dozen men, who shoveled away the deepest banks that lay in the road; then an- other became visible in the opposite direction, and finally half Oaklawn seemed to be out breaking tracks. In the afternoon, the traveller visited the smith, and succeeded in hiring a cutter to take the place of his own useless chaise; and made final preparations for leaving Oaklawn on the following morning. Having had a tolerable good opportunity to judge of the poverty of the Liviogstons, the traveller, in as delicate a manner as possible, requested Lizzie to accept a present of a piece  of gold; h:-t her decisive refusal made him al-  most ashamed, as if he had actually insulted s the hospitality of his friends.      f The departure of the traveller did not take t place without regrets on both sides; for he de-  elared hirnt If highly delighted with his new ac- quaintances, and Luther and his wife, having  learned to love his refined mind, simple man- t ners, and plain, benevolent countenance, were  sorry to see him go, notwithstanding the poverty  -of their larder.              a Now,'()aklalwn laughed at the poor school- t master for having, in his pover'ty, given hospi- h tality to a stranger; and after that event, his o school dwindled down to a worse condition than before. It was no use, people said, to try t to keep a mah who would not look out for him- r self; ant at The- commencem(nt of the second,  quarter, with the exception of five young ladies. t] only thr-e pupils besides James Willett, the h "charity hoy," remained.          t How the Livingstons managed to live till A spring, I an unable to say. They were very a poor; yet they never gave way to despondency. a Still pu ting faih in the future, they waited to h see what anothher spring time would bring forth. In the month of March. an incident occurred. sc which gave them considerable hope. Luther h received a letter from the board of directors of it I              . I   o the R-- Collegiate institute, stating that a t. teacher of Greek and mathematics was required, n and that, should he see fit to' apply for the situ- ation, his chance of obtaining it would be equal ! to that of any other applicant. i  Luther, who had previously applied by letter for a situation in the R-  Institute, and re- ceived no reply to the communication, was somewhat surprised by this intelligence; but, - knowing with what difficulties an obscure teach- ,er like himself would have to contend, amidst the numbers who were anxious to obtain any situation like that now vacant, it is doubtful whether he would have troubled himself again about the matter, had it not been for his wife. Lizzie urged him to proceed at once t, R--; and, having succeeded in borrowirg money of 'Squire Holmes 'for the purpose, he took affec- tionate leave of his amiable wife, and set out one fine morning to make one more attempt at im- proving his condition in life. But the condition of affairs at the R--  Col- legiate Institute filled Luther with dismay, the moment of his arrival. He found eleven appli- cants besides himself, waiting for the decision of the directors; and on inquiry, he learned that several of them were supported by influential friends. What could he hope to do, alone in the world, poor and friendless, with such com petitors in the way? Moreover, Luther could not help feeling that his threadbare coat, dilapidated hat and clumsy boots were very much in the way of his success. His fellow-applicants seemed inclined to look contemptuously upon him; the students sneered as they passed him by; and even the officers of the Institute answered his questions in that brief, forbidding tone, which persons conscious of addressing an inferior are so apt to assume. The applicants, now numbering fourteen by two late arrivals, were to assemble in the after- noon (there being no regular exercises on that day) in one of the rooms of the Institute Lu- ther was early on the spot, and in a lit:le while, he found himself surrounded by the actual teachers, and those who desired so to become. At length, a commotion in the crowd indicated an arrival of unusual interest; and Luther saw approaching a middle aged man, to whom every- hody seemed to pay extraordinary deference. Luther was near sighted; but before this per- sonage had got fairly into the hall, he thought he recognized features which had become deeply impressed upon his memory. With consideras    <pb n="100" xml:id="VAC6847-00000049"/> ble eagerness, he turned to one of the teachers, 'and inquired who the new comer was. The person addressed looked at Luther supercilioas- ly without deigning to reply. The question was proposed to another, who did not appear to un- derstand it; and before Luther could repeat it, the new comer, advancing with a smiling coun- tenance through the crowd, which divided right and left before him, quietly approached Mr. Liv- ingiton. "My dear friend! I am happy to see you again!" exclaimed the great man, shaking Lu ther's hand warmly. To say Luther was astonished at meeting his friend, the traveller, so unexpectedly, would be to use a weak expression. But it would be impossible to describe the amazement of the teachers and would be teachers, who had so lately looked upon our adventurer as a person of not the least consequence! It was surprising to see how soon the popular opinion was chang- ed; Luther was the observed of all; the alchemy of the great man's friendship converting the dr9ss of his exterior into gold I In a voice loud enough to be heard by those around. Luther's unknown friend inquired good- naturedly about the "Oaklawa High School," and made f iendly inquiries concerning Mrs. Livingston, repeating his expressions of satis- faction on meeting Lather. "Perhaps," suggested Mr. Livingston, who began to suspect the truth, "I owe it to yon that I ant hero to-day." "I confess I mentioned your name to one of the directors, and requested him to write you. I should have written myself, but I did not like to give you too much encouragement: as you see we have several applicants for the vacant situation, and it. is only the best qualifcations which should influence the choice." "Even had nou written," replied Luther, "it is probable I should not have known yon for my correspondent; for, you must remember, you never gave me your name." "O, I owe you an apology! But you know who I am now!" said the other, with a benevo- lent smile. "Yes, indeed! But it is no wonder, after all, I did not suspect you to be Professor J-!' The professor laughed, pressed Luther's hand again, and passcd into another room. Not one of the better dressed applicants but would wil- lingly,. at that moment, have stood in Mr. Liv- ingston's shoes!   The applicants were examined separately, under the superintendence of Professor J-- himself. One after another they were admitted into the private apartment, and despatched with a few strokes by the professor and several of his assistants. At length, Luther's turn came. With an easy, modest bearing, he appeared before the examining committee. To the astonishment of all, Professor J-- folded his arms, and said: "Proceed, gentlemen. I have no questions to propose to Mr. Livingston. I had an excel- lent opportunity of ascertaining his qualifica- tions, three months ago; and I am so thoroughly satisfied, that I should as soon think of examin- ing myself!" It is needless to say, the gentlemen did not question Luther very closely. However, to pre- serve a certain formality, a passage in Greek, selected at random, was given him to translate, which he did with such readiness, elegance and correctness, that no one thought of proceeding farther. After the examination, the candidates were informed that the successful applicant would hear from the board in three days, and sent away. Mr. Livingston, however, received a private invitation to pass the night at the house of Pro- fessor J-, which he'joyfully accepted. Their friendship was renewed on familiar terms; and the professor told Luther, in confidence, that there was no doubt but he was the successful candidate! Luther hastened home to Lizzie with the joy- ful intelligence. It is needless to say that prep- arations were immediately made for closing the "Oaklawn High School." The Livingstons re- moved to R-   with all convenient despatch; and Luther entered upon his new duties with a heart full of hope and love for all mankind. As her husband's salary was good, Lizzie did not teach, but devoted herself to promoting the happiness of home; and never, I verily believe, were two young people so wholly free from all worldly perplexities and discontent, as Luther and his Lizzie. They were blest with the un- failing friendship of the learned and excellent Professor J-, whose kindness towards them, even to this day (although Mr. Livingston has been promoted to a still higher spheie of action), brings home to their' hearts pleasant recollec- tions of the time when, in their poverty, they entertained, in an unknown traveller, the author of the benefits they now enjoy.
