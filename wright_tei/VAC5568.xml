               <head>"THE PICKET SLAYER."</head>
               <p>LATE on the night of Washington's birth-day, 1862, President Lincoln and General McClellan were engaged in earnest consultation regarding some military matters of the highest importance. In the midst of their conversation, a stranger was announced who, though the hour was so unseasonable for visitors, expressed the strongest, wish to see either Mr. Lincoln or General McClellan. To a reply that an audience would be impossible, the visitor sent up a letter, to which was appended the single but magic word "Palmerston."</p>
               <p>"It is rather strange, however, Mr. Lincoln," remarked General McClellan, after the President had read the letter to him, "that this communication should come directly from Palmerston, when the proper channel should be Lord Lyons, he being the British Minister."</p>
               <p>"Well," said the President, "the communication is certainly in the handwriting of Palmerston himself, and doubtless there are good, reasons for his irregular course in the matter. Let us see the bearer at any rate."</p>
               <p>"With all my heart," answered the General; "we can hear what he has to say about this diabolical creature."</p>
               <p>A few moments after this, the unknown visitor was ushered into the presence of the President, and his celebrated chieftain.</p>
               <p>As the newcomer was saluted and motioned to a chair by the President, both the letter and General McClellan closely scrutinized his features and appearance. Mr. Lincoln did so in that mild, almost innocent manner so characteristic of him, and McClellan with that keen, eagle glance so peculiarly his own.</p>
               <pb n="22-23" xml:id="VAC5568-00000003"/>
               <p>"Mr. Wetherill," said the President, at last opening conversation on the subject-matter of the letter, "General McClellan and myself were engaged with a most important matter when you were announced, and I was compelled to send down a refusal to see you; but after reading this letter, I felt assured that an interview should be had."</p>
               <p>"Well, your Excellency and General," said Mr. Wetherill, bowing first to the President and then to McClellan, "I regret that I should have interrupted you; but I considered it highly necessary to see you at the earliest moment after my arrival from England."</p>
               <p>"In what steamer did you come, Mr. Wetherill?" asked McClellan.</p>
               <p>"In the Bohemian, General, which reached Portland two days since. I immediately started for Washington, and arrived here an hour ago."</p>
               <p>"I am almost startled, Mr. Wetherill," resumed the President, "at the perusal of this letter of Lord Palmerston's. Is there no mistake, no misapprehension in the matter?"</p>
               <p>"None whatever, your Excellency," answered the visitor; "in fact no language, however strong, can convey to the mind a really correct conception of this startling, terrible being!"</p>
               <p>"I am exceedingly curious, Mr. Wetherill, to hear a full detail in relation to the awful anomaly of Nature referred to in Lord Palmerston's communication."</p>
               <p>"That, or as nearly as possible, I will give your Excellency. In the year 1844, I became established as a practicing physician in the City of London. The very first case I received was a most peculiar one. I had retired one night, and had just fallen into a sort of <unclear>wakeful</unclear> slumber, when I was aroused suddenly by a ring at the night bell. The servant who went to open the door, quickly brought me word that a young and noble looking gentleman wished to see me instantly. I quickly slipped on my clothes and hurried down to the office, where I found a stranger pacing the room with uneasy steps.</p>
               <p>"His features, excepting a piercing black eye, and a marble-pale forehead, I was unable to see, as they were concealed by the carefully arranged folds of a heavy Spanish mantle.</p>
               <p>"'Doctor Wetherill,' he commenced, in a voice altered from its usual tone, and yet tremulous from excitement, 'I want you to come with me instantly. Here is gold, if you wish your fee now,' extending a purse from beneath his mantle as he spoke—'and my own carriage, with fleet horses, is at the door! Come, it is a matter of life and death! all depends on you! Come instantly!'</p>
               <p>"Naturally fond of adventure and mystery, I did not hesitate longer than to get my hat and surtout—for the weather was stormy—and, within a minute and a half, I was seated with my strange patron in a richly cushioned coach, that went flying along behind a pair of splendid steeds.</p>
               <p>"I had fully expected to be conveyed to some aristocratic mansion, in keeping with the vehicle in which I rode. What was my surprise, however, to find the carriage, after a long drive, drawn up before a neat little cottage, some distance out upon the Northern Road.</p>
               <p>"This is the place!' said my companion, in tones lower and firmer than he had used before.</p>
               <p>"The following instant, without waiting for the coachman, he himself had sprung from his seat to the ground, and stood, with the coach door in his hand, waiting for me. I got out nimbly, and followed my mysterious guide into the cottage, and up to a chamber on the second floor. I had, from the first, half guessed the object for which my services had been sought, and I was not, therefore, surprised at the sight that my glance fell on when I entered the chamber I speak of.</p>
               <p>"On an elegantly furnished couch lay one of the most lovely beings I ever beheld. She was now insensible, yet it was evident that she had but recently been strongly convulsed. One arm, white as alabaster, and peerless in its moulding, rested, where it had been tossed, upon a bunch of long, flaxen, dishevelled curls, whilst the other was pressed upon a heart that seemed to have ceased its throbbings. The rigid features were wonderfully regular, but hueless as the snow."</p>
               <p>At this point the narrator was interrupted by the entrance of a staff officer, who, saluting his superiors, handed to General McClellan several dispatches, which, as the General read, he handed to the President, with the remark:</p>
               <p>"Those relieve us of our anxiety."</p>
               <p>Then turning to Mr. Wetherill, he continued.</p>
               <p>"I am sorry, sir, you were interrupted, but the interruption gives us more time to listen to your narrative, which has already so deeply interested me that I beg of you to relate the fullest details thereof."</p>
               <p>Mr. Lincoln, as the staff officer left the apartment, made a like remark, and Mr. Wetherill resumed:</p>
               <p>"It needed not any words from my unknown guide to tell me what was wanted. I saw all in an instant. A few hurried questions and replies of the old woman who was by the bedside, placed me in possession of all the information I needed, and I proceeded at once to my duty.</p>
               <pb n="24-25" xml:id="VAC5568-00000004"/>
               <p>"A short time after midnight, the souls of mother and child passed each other through the portal of eternity.</p>
               <p>"'Dead! dead! did you say?" gasped the young man by whom I had been brought to the cottage, dropping the mantle from about his face, and seizing my arm with both hands, as the fact was announced to him. 'Oh, doctor,' he continued, in the most anguished tones, 'I brought you here to save her!'</p>
               <p>"'I have used my utmost skill, sir,' replied I, in a soothing manner, 'but it was, alas, too late.'</p>
               <p>"'Too late! too late!' he repeated after me, vacantly. Then relinquishing his grasp upon my arm, he turned to the bedside, and, bending over the lovely corpse, he took the two dead arms, and, twining them about his neck, fondly kissed the pale lips of the deceased.</p>
               <p>"Rising to his feet, he turned again to me, and said, in a calm voice:</p>
               <p>"'Doctor, my grief has overthrown my prudence, and caused me to discover myself to you. Can I trust to your life-long secrecy?'</p>
               <p>"'On my honor you can,' I quickly rejoined, taking his extended hand in mine, and pressing it warmly. I had recognized him as the eldest son of one of England's most celebrated Peers.</p>
               <p>"He and I parted for the night, after he had set me down at my own door, and promised to call and see me on the succeeding day. He kept his promise, and from him I obtained a history of his life for the past year or so. It was the old tale. He had seen this beautiful but poor girl, and fallen in love with her. She was beneath his station in life, and, of course, marriage was out of the question. His ardent love was returned, and, in an unguarded hour, Mary fell from woman's highest estate. More need not be said.</p>
               <p>"The infant, a lovely little girl, became the object of the father's whole affection, and from the hour of her birth up to her tenth year she was scarcely away from him more than a week at a time. Strange enough, however, the more strenuously her parent sought to gain her affections, the more repulsive became her disposition and temperament. At this time the father died suddenly and somewhat mysteriously, and young Mary was left an entire orphan. On his death-bed he injudiciously, as I deemed, told the full story of her mother's wrong to Mary, taking, of course, the whole blame of, the unhappy affair upon himself, and imploring his daughter to have the example of her mother's fate constantly before her eyes. The recital took a deep effect upon the child's mind, and for several weeks after her parent's death she was retiring, and even morose.</p>
               <p>"Having promised the father to take her to my home and see to her raising, I had a good opportunity to study her temperament and natural traits of character; and every succeeding day of her existence I became more and more convinced that she was a fearful anomaly, one of those pent-up tempests of soulless mind—if the expression is applicable—that, when they burst upon mankind, are most terrible in their effects. Fully comprehending the shame of her birth, she discontinued the use of her father's name after his death, and called herself Mary Murdock.</p>
               <p>"Her mind was extremely powerful and brilliant, and I therefore allowed her the use of my library, hoping for beneficial results. In my earlier years, I had been an enthusiastic investigator of those occult sciences and abstruse philosophies that were once carried to such perfection in Oriental countries, and I had spent large sums in the purchase of rare and valuable books that treated of such subjects. A collection of several hundred strange old volumes was one result of this enthusiasm; and these tomes, covered with dust, occupied a separate portion of my library. In the course of her examination, Mary chanced upon this collection.</p>
               <p>"As the wearied traveler in the desert plunges into the unexpected water pool, and drinks even to excess, so Mary plunged into the reservoir of subtle lore that I unconsciously had prepared for her, years previous. Her mental nature, too, seemed specially adapted for the reception of just such knowledge as was here stored within her reach. The result was astounding. Night and day, early and late, she was in the library, devouring the contents of musty, worm-eaten old books and manuscripts, that even I, with all my ardor for investigation, had failed to make intelligible. For awhile, my wonder was awakened, and then my fears excited for the mind of the strange young creature, whose father I had solemnly promised to guide her aright to maturity.</p>
               <p>"Her manners and habits, and even her personal appearance, became quickly, strangely altered. Hitherto her cheeks had been rosy, and her deep blue eyes dreamy and soft in expression; but now the roseate hue of her <unclear>cheeks</unclear> was replaced by a singular pallor, while her eyes burned with a brilliant, flashing light, that at times caused her to look weird, or, more truthfully, demoniac. During her previous life, she had always been frightened at the approach, and during the continuance, of a storm; but now her utmost apparent delight was to wander out into the open air, and expose herself to every tempest. The more fiercely the elements raged, the more perfectly did they seem to harmonize with her wild nature. On<pb n="26-27" xml:id="VAC5568-00000005"/> these and also other occasions, she would fling her arms abroad, and apostrophise some unseen beings in the language of the Oriental Magi.</p>
               <p>"I scarcely knew what measures to take. I confined her in her room, and in two days she raved like a maniac. I threatened her with my displeasure, and she laughed me to scorn. I told her that I would burn every volume in the library. At this she became for a while absolutely insane. Last of all, I tried the effect of reasoning kindly with her. I couched my appeals to her in terms of endearment, and succeeded thereby in calming her.</p>
               <p>"After quietly listening to me one day, she replied to the effect that she was a child of sin, doomed from the moment of her birth to perdition, and destined, while she remained on earth, to be the enemy of everything good.</p>
               <p>"'Thanks to your books, Doctor,' she continued, with the assured manner of a person of forty years, 'I have been enabled to master those sciences that teach me how to communicate with my kindred spirits in the lower world. It was not your fault! They guided me from birth; I am theirs forever! I shall perform my part on earth, and, when that is done, I shall be loosed from the body, and go to where I belong. <emph>By your hand, Doctor, they tell me I, that is, my body, shall die!</emph>'</p>
               <p>"I shuddered; my flesh crept with horror, as the words of the child monster fell upon my ears. Could it be that out from those beautiful eyes a demon from the bottomless pit was staring at me? that the spirit which animated the fragile form before me was one of darkness? The thought made my very soul sick.</p>
               <p>"'I must leave you, Doctor!' exclaimed Mary, at this moment, 'I must leave you; they are calling me!'</p>
               <p>"With an indescribable glance, the youthful speaker started from the chair on which she had been sitting, and bounded away to the library.</p>
               <p>"I did not go after her, but remained where I was, long and deeply pondering the course I ought to pursue in regard to my charge. The impression quickly graved itself upon my mind that I must devote my life, for years to come, to Mary alone, and that impression I resolved to carry out.</p>
               <p>"My first step in this direction was a re-application to the study of those occult arts and sciences to which I have already referred, and an entire abandonment of my practice. Doubtless, gentlemen, this may strike you as rather superstitious; but I myself have discovered some startling facts, facts, I repeat the word, in regard to the connections that exist, and the connections that may exist, between man and the beings of the other world. But I shall not weary you with useless detail. Suffice it to say, that from the time I commenced my surveillance upon the singular being I have been speaking of, I have had one unbroken contest with her.</p>
               <p>"Several weeks since, I was stricken down with a short but sudden illness, during which Mary escaped, and went, no one knew whither. I was satisfied that I should presently hear of her wherever she might have gone to. As I expected; I learned, not from man, however, that my charge had sailed for America to join herself to the cause of the rebellion that is now rending your land. I immediately took the next steamer that sailed, and am here, for the purpose of securing this terrible being. Previous to setting out from England, I took the precaution of obtaining from my friend, Lord Palmerston, an autograph letter as to my object in coming hither. His lordship has for some time been deeply interested in this—what he terms—'diabolical phenomenon of Nature,' and I trust, after reading his lordship's letter, that you will allow me, your Excellency, a free communication in and out of the lines of the Union armies. I could pass them whenever I might feel so disposed, without the slightest trouble; but I shall at times need your assistance, and also that of General McClellan, in the prosecution of my search; and I prefer that there shall be no concealment about my actions."</p>
               <p>"Well, Mr. Wetherill," said General McClellan, "what you have said has induced, in my mind at least, an idea that this young and beautiful creature is the victim of a most peculiar madness, or rather, to use plain language, possessed of a devil, if such a thing is possible. But what are really her powers for harm?"</p>
               <p>"Her powers for harm, General, are almost unlimited, except when under the direct influence of myself, or at least some one who has mastered those occult sciences of which I have before spoken. For instance, the barriers of your best and most rigidly kept lines, General, she could penetrate at any time she chose, morning, noon, or night, without the slightest peril of being captured. She could introduce herself into this apartment though you were to guard it with a full regiment, and were there information here valuable to the enemy, and which she wished to obtain, you might seal it with all the care possible, yet she would get it."</p>
               <p>"I hope most sincerely, then, Mr. Wetherill," said the President, "that you may succeed at the earliest moment in capturing this terrible creature. But, to speak the truth, sir, and I hope I shall<pb n="28-29" xml:id="VAC5568-00000006"/> not offend you thereby, I have no such fears as you appear to have, concerning this wild, eccentric girl."</p>
               <p>"I think I know what your Excellency means by that expression," replied Mr. Wetherill, in a quiet manner; "you mean that any belief in the exercise of such powers as I have described, is altogether erroneous, and, perhaps, to be plainer, that it is silly."</p>
               <p>"I must own up to, it Mr. Wetherill," replied the President, in his blunt, though not offensive manner, "that I cannot bring myself to credit any such doctrine as communication, or rather alliances and partnerships between people of this world and any other. It strikes me very forcibly that that sort of business saw its best days in the dark ages."</p>
               <p>"Well, your Excellency," said Mr. Wetherill, in the same quiet tone as before, "it would be useless for me to argue the matter with you, but I will, ere morning, bring to your attention something that will perhaps startle even you. I will see both yourself and General McClellan again before daybreak. You may surround yourselves with as many guards as you choose, and give them express orders against admitting me. Yet I will pass them, and hold an interview with you both. Understand me properly, gentlemen," continued the speaker, rising to take his departure, "I do not intend to do this as the juggling magician performs his tricks of magic before an audience, but by means of a science, that, however startling and profound, is still within the reach of any mind of ordinary intelligence, that will diligently prosecute the researches necessary to its attainment. I will leave Lord Palmerston's letter with you until to-morrow, at two o'clock, your Excellency, at which time I beg you will grant me another interview."</p>
               <p>"I will do so with pleasure, Mr. Wetherill," answered the President, urbanely; "and," continued he, with one of his peculiar smiles, "I shall be equally pleased to see you in that startling visit that you propose to favor me with during the night. And I have no doubt General McClellan will, also."</p>
               <p>One or two remarks of a general character passed among the three, and then Mr. Wetherill took his departure.</p>
               <p>"What opinion do you form of that man, Mr. Lincoln?" asked General McClellan, when the strange visitor had gone.</p>
               <p>"Well, I hardly know, General," answered the President, "but it does rather strike me that he's just about as queer as this girl herself, that he is in such a quandary about. To say the truth, I think he's rather on the luney order. What do you think?"</p>
               <p>"Had he lacked the letter from Lord Palmerston," rejoined McClellan lan, "and come merely with his own apparently wild assertions, I should not have given him much consideration. But I hardly think that, under the existing circumstances, and remembering, also, the delicate relations at the present time between this country and England, a man of Palmerston's sound sense would meddle in a silly affair. And you notice how strong his language is in regard to this singular and dreadful being. Besides, when I was a boy, I myself remember an old man in Philadelphia, who was said to possess powers exactly similar to those described by Wetherill. There happened, under my own observation, two facts in connection with this old man; that were most decidedly startling and unaccountable."</p>
               <p>"But then," remarked the President, "this letter of Palmerston's, though apparently genuine, may, after all, be only a clever forgery."</p>
               <p>"I hardly think the seal could be," suggested McClellan.</p>
               <p>"That is true," quickly answered the President; "that is true. Well, we shall learn more of the matter to-morrow."</p>
               <p>As there was now nothing to detain Mr. Lincoln or General McClellan, each bade the other good night and parted.</p>

               <head type="sub">THE TRAITOR AND HIS DEMON FRIEND.</head>
               <p>LEAVING both our distinguished characters, however, for a while; we shall make a retrogression, that our succeeding narrative may be the more clearly understood.</p>
               <p>The traitor President of the Southern Confederacy sat alone in his private library, harrassing his mind for expedients to excuse the unpromising condition of Rebel affairs to the people about whose necks he and his coadjutors were endeavoring to place a most tyrannical yoke.</p>
               <p>While thus engaged, he was considerably startled by the appearance directly before him of a singularly beautiful girl.</p>
               <p>"Pardon me, Miss," 'he said', in amazement, gazing at his unbidden visitor, "but I thought myself alone. What would you have of me?"</p>
               <p>"Nothing! What would <emph>you</emph> have of <emph>me?</emph>" was the prompt reply, spoken in tones unlike any that the traitor's ears had ever heard.</p>
               <pb n="30-31" xml:id="VAC5568-00000007"/>
               <p>Davis, with all his cold determination of character, became confused. He was at a loss for words to answer his fair interrogator. The letter, without the motion of a muscle, continued to gaze directly into the face of the arch-traitor for the space of nearly a minute, when she broke the silence thus:</p>
               <p>"President Davis, your cause has received some stunning blows lately! To awaken the ardor of your people, you must have victories; to have victories, you need assistance; to give you that assistance, I am here. Speak! what would you have me do?"</p>
               <p>Davis was more than ever mystified, and perplexing thoughts crowded themselves confusedly into his mind.</p>
               <p>"Pray, Miss," said he at length, freeing himself somewhat of his embarrassment, "may I enquire who you are?"</p>
               <p>"You may. I am called Mary Murdock."</p>
               <p>"One more question, Miss Murdock," continued Davis, in a half polite, half stern tone, "how did you gain admittance to this apartment?"</p>
               <p>"By a power which recognizes not the will of mortal man."</p>
               <p>This laconic reply was accompanied by a piercing look that caused the Rebel President to shudder, and induced him to the belief that his mysterious visitant was either a spirit or a lunatic.</p>
               <p>Scarcely knowing what reply he was making, he said:</p>
               <p>"You say you have come here to render, through me, assistance to the holy cause for which the Southern people are so nobly battling?"</p>
               <p>"My mission hither, President Davis, is to render your cause assistance, not because it is holy, as you hypocritically say, but because it is the most diabolical that could be conceived of."</p>
               <p>Davis leaped to his feet, his eyes flashing fire, and his lips pale, and quivering with rage. The next instant, however, he sank back in his chair, limp and helpless, whilst his visitor made several swift passes before his eyes, uttering as she did so, some cabalistic words or exclamations.</p>
               <p>Pausing for a moment, she regarded the victim of her spell in Silence. Then reversing her incantation, she caused him to recover himself.</p>
               <p>"You know me now as a potential friend, do you not?" asked she of her companion, bending on his countenance another of her terrible glances.</p>
               <p>"Yes! yes!" murmured Davis, in a voice which resembled that of a man who has been nearly strangled.</p>
               <p>"Then direct me as to what you would have me do, and I will do<pb n="38 (Illustration) -39" xml:id="VAC5568-00000008"/>
                  <figure>
                     <head>"One more question, Miss Murdock," continued Davis, in a half polite, half stern tone, 'How did you gain admittance to this apartment?" "By a power which recognizes not the will of mortal man!"—See page before this. </head>
                  </figure> it; that is, provided it is not to go to Washington. There is in that city a counter-influence, much more powerful than mine; one which I must carefully avoid."</p>
               <p>"Ah," replied Davis, "Washington is the place, above all others at this juncture, in which I want spies. There are hundreds willing to undertake the enterprise, but the lines of McClellan's army are so thoroughly kept that it is almost impossible to get through."</p>
               <p>"I will make their passage easy for them!" said the strange being, without a moment's hesitation, yet more as though she were soliloquizing than addressing Davis.</p>
               <p>"There are two men," resumed the latter, "who intended setting out to-morrow morning to make the attempt; and if I can only get them into Washington for a few days, and back safely, they will stand me in better stead than a whole army corps."</p>
               <p>"To-morrow morning do they start?" inquired Mary Murdock, for by this name must we call the beautiful demon.</p>
               <p>"Yes."</p>
               <p>"Then I will accompany them. I will be here at eight o'clock; I suppose they will be ready by that time?"</p>
               <p>"I will see that they are," replied Davis.</p>
               <p>"Then, until that hour, farewell. We shall be of much service to each other, President Davis, and also to the cause of the Confederacy! Ha! ha!"</p>
               <p>The following moment the speaker was gone.</p>
               <p>Upon finding himself alone once more, the Rebel President paced up and down the floor of the apartment with slow, indecisive steps.</p>
               <p>"Is it possible," muttered he, "that such a being can exist? the face and form of an angel, and the soul of a demon. But what matters it? she will serve me well. I wish her powers were mine. To what station would I not reach? I would conquer the whole earth, and reign its supreme sovereign. Oh! how glorious that would be! But I have a different fate, far different! Providence has assigned to me, as one of its creatures, a not very enviable position, and I must fill it. Yes! yes, it is my fate! So be it! So let the wheel of Destiny roll on!"</p>
               <p>The next morning, punctual to her appointment, Mary Murdock waited upon Jeff. Davis, who, with equal punctuality, had his two emissaries ready to start with her.</p>
               <p>These were astonished upon seeing who their guide and protectress was to be, and one of them, taking Davis aside, said to him:</p>
               <p>"There is some mistake about this matter, is there not, Uncle Jeff? or are you sending this lovely young girl as a blind?"</p>
               <pb n="40-41" xml:id="VAC5568-00000009"/>
               <p>"Neither one nor the other," replied the Rebel President; "that being, whom you call a lovely young girl, is possessed of far more power than I am. She will take you as safely through the Federal lines; as though there were no lines."</p>
               <p>"That is exactly the girl for us and the Confederacy, then!" laughed the other. "But who is she? I am wonderfully struck with her beauty, and, if I thought her fortune was as handsome as her face, I would make good use of my time between here and the Yankee army."</p>
               <p>"You talk unwittingly!" said Davis; "that paragon of loveliness, so sweetly angelic in her outward appearance; is in reality one of the most terrible beings of which you could conceive."</p>
               <p>"Then I hardly think that she would suit me, for my former wife was more than a match for me. However, she is becoming impatient. I see she is afraid, I suppose, of being too late for the train. I will step back to her."</p>
               <p>Mary Murdock, who had been sitting down, had risen to her feet just, before the spy made the conclusion of his remarks to Davis, and she now stood leading upon what seemed to be a long staff, concealed in a muslin case made specially for it.</p>
               <p>After a few final, instructions to his two servants and a gracious farewell to the beauteous demon, Mary Murdock, Davis parted with the trio, who made their way directly to the railroad depot from which they were to start on their journey. This they just reached in time to secure seats abroad the train for Manassas.</p>
               <p>All the way along, the two spies and their fair companion were extremely sociable; and so fascinating were the beauty and accomplishments of the latter, that, ere half the contemplated distance was passed over, the two former were each desperately enamored with her.</p>
               <p>It was night when Orange Court-House was reached, and a heavy rain, mingled with snow, rendered, the weather remarkably disagreeable.</p>
               <p>One of the spies, who had a friend in the town, proposed to pass the night there, and resume the journey by next morning's train.</p>
               <p>In a moment Mary's manner was entirely changed.</p>
               <p>"No delay," she said, in authoritative tones; "did not the President specially order you not to tarry on the road, under any consideration, but to push forward with all speed?"</p>
               <p>"The d—l!" muttered one of the spies to his companion, in a whisper, "she must be very intimate with Davis, that he should impart to her the instructions he gave us. What she has just repeated were the exact words of the President to myself, and I'll wager my life that we were alone at the time."</p>
               <p>"Oh, well," was the rejoinder, "perhaps she's a sort of Louise de La Valiere to Davis. It was on your account, Miss Murdock," continued the speaker, turning to Mary, "that we wished to stop until the weather should moderate."</p>
               <p>"Give yourself no concern, gentlemen," quickly answered the fair girl, "for my welfare or ease, Do your duty to the Confederacy, no matter who suffers by it. The President timed your arrival near the Federal lines exactly, and there, at that time, you must be, hail, rain, or shine! I shall be there to see that you experience no difficulty in passing the enemy's pickets."</p>
               <p>At this moment the train rushed onward, and soon left the court-house in the distance.</p>
               <p>"Miss Murdock," said one of the spies, after silence had been maintained for some time, "how do you intend to guide us through the Federal lines? I should judge you to have been a resident in a large city, unaccustomed to such a rough country as that across which these same lines stretch."</p>
               <p>"I will make a gap with this," she answered, glancing sideways at the long muslin case that she held in her hand; "and through that gap you two will pass on to Washington. There you will fulfil your mission, get your passes, and return to this identical point. Here I will await you, and make your passage of the pickets again an easy matter, as your passes will not take you outside without assistance."</p>
               <p>"May I be bold enough," continued he who had addressed Mary, "to inquire what you have there in that case, and how it will perform the almost magic powers you assign to it."</p>
               <p>"Ah! time enough yet for you to ascertain all that," answered the beautiful girl, with an expression on her countenance that forbade farther inquiry upon the subject.</p>
               <p>As the trio proceeded Northward, the weather became dryer and colder, and by the time they reached the appointed spot, snow covered the ground to the depth of several inches, above which the bleak, frosty wind rushed and whirled fiercely with its wintry music.</p>
               <p>It was eleven o'clock at night when they came within sight of the outermost line of Union pickets. We say within sight, and with truth, for, though the stars were nearly all obscured by masses of drifting grey clouds, yet the reflection of the snow was so great as to render objects distinctly visible at a considerable distance. The Federal pickets were prohibited, under the extreme penalty of death,<pb n="42-43" xml:id="VAC5568-00000010"/> from using fire, as valuable information would thereby be conveyed to the Rebel commanders. And as the cold was excessive, the shivering, but faithful heroes were obliged to keep moving about continually. By reason of this fact, and also the contrast afforded by their heavy, blue overcoats to the snow, they could be easily seen by Mary Murdock and her two companions. With a wonderful forethought, the beautiful demon had, while passing a farm-house near by, entered the latter, and purchased three white sheets. Retaining one of these herself, she gave one to each of the spies, with orders to use them as she should instruct. The object of the strange action they did not perceive until they and their companion reached a small clump of woods between which and the moving sentinels there stretched several wide, level fields.</p>
               <p>"Do you see that tall soldier across there?" asked she of the two spies.</p>
               <p>"Yes," was the reply.</p>
               <p>"You perceive, of course, how easily he can be distinguished, even at this distance, on account of the striking contrast afforded by his uniform to the snow."</p>
               <p>"Yes."</p>
               <p>"And you perceive, also, that at the moment he passes that large tree, though he is this side of it, yet he is instantly lost to view, owing to the fact that the dark color of the tree blends with that of his dress."</p>
               <p>"Yes, we see all that," answered the spies.</p>
               <p>"Very well," resumed Mary Murdock. "Now, we must cross these fields, which are uninterruptedly white. Should we do so without precaution, discovery would be certain, and an alarm would follow just as certainly. A safeguard against this I obtained when I purchased the three sheets at the farm-house at which we last stopped."</p>
               <p>"Oh, yes, yes, Miss Murdock," exclaimed one of Mary's companions, in a voice rather incautiously loud. "I see it all now; we're to wrap ourselves up in these sheets, which, being the same color as the snow, cannot be detected while moving over the snow."</p>
               <p>"That is exactly the idea," returned Mary; "but do not forget," she continued, "that, in that case, you must keep out in the open space, and not come, if it is possible to avoid it, before any dark background, as trees or bushes; for, in such case, your disguise makes you even more conspicuous to the sharp-sighted sentinels, than do their dark uniforms on the snow."</p>
               <p>"Well really, Miss Murdock," said the other spy, in complimentary tary tones, "you are a genius! Who would ever have thought of such a capital expedient?"</p>
               <p>"Well, as you both now understand, let us go forward speedily."</p>
               <p>As the beautiful demon was speaking, she drew from the long muslin bag or case that had excited the curiosity of her companions, a simple bow, such a one as is used by a few of the Indians of the Far West. It was not quite three feet long, and formed of a single piece of bone as white as ivory, and equally hard and polished. In addition, however, it was possessed of an unsurpassed elasticity.</p>
               <p>[As the reader, who, may never have heard of the use of these peculiar bows by the Savages of the plains, may think such a weapon impossible, we deem it necessary in this connection, to describe it. The bows in common use by the Indians, consist generally of a strip of the <foreign xml:lang="FRA">Bois d' Arc,</foreign> finished on the back with layers of the sinews and glue of the buffalo. Others are made by lashing several flat strips of the buffalo's horns securely together. But how or where the Indians obtain the strange bow to which we refer, no traveller has ever yet been able to ascertain. When questioned concerning them, the Savages invariably point Westward toward the Rocky Mountains, and exclaim, "<emph>Medicine,</emph>" which means "Mystery." The only plausible theory yet advanced in regard to the weapon is, that the coast tribes on the Pacific form it from the tooth, or rather snout, of the Narwhale, which is often stranded, and carrying it across the mountains, barter it with the nations of the Plains. Whatever its origin, such is its tremendous power, that a skillful hunter at a distance of twenty-five or thirty feet can throw an arrow from it clean through the body of a buffalo. Travellers have sometimes succeeded in purchasing these bows from the Indians, but it is seldom they can be persuaded to part with them, even at the most exorbitant prices.]</p>
               <p>Both the spies were surprised and disappointed at the production, by Mary Murdock, of a simple bow, after their curiosity and expectation had been raised to the highest pitch by the mysterious contents of the muslin case. Their fair companion, however, did not give them much time to indulge in their newly awakened emotions; for, taking the bow and several arrows in her hand, she entirely enveloped herself in the white sheet, ordering them to do the same, and to follow her at a distance of fifteen or twenty feet.</p>
               <p>A moment more, and she was moving stealthily, but rapidly toward the sentinel, who, poor fellow, thinking only of the loved ones that would greet his return home, tramped back and forth, all unconscious of the fate that was approaching him.</p>
               <pb n="44-45" xml:id="VAC5568-00000011"/>
               <p>The demon girl was within hearing of her intended victim as the latter, for a moment forgetting himself, said aloud:</p>
               <p>"I wonder if Jane got my last money all right, and got something for the boys out of it?"</p>
               <p>Half his sentence only was spoken before the terrible being, whose fiercely burning eyes were fastened upon him, dropped on one knee, placed an arrow on her bow-string, and raised the weapon for an aim. The next instant the passing wind bore away on its icy wings the twang of the bow-string, and the low death-groan of a gallant soldier of the Union.</p>
               <p>No angel of Heaven turned aside the winged shaft from the picket's heart, and he sank dead on the snowy winding-sheet at his feet, with his last yearning words for Jane and his boys trembling on his lips.</p>
               <p>The murderess, after the commission of the horrible deed, quickly rose from her kneeling position, and stepped back to her two companions, who had halted.</p>
               <p>"Now then," whispered she, "is your opportunity to go forward. You will meet with no opposition."</p>
               <p>"But there is most likely another line," quickly suggested one of the spies.</p>
               <p>"If there were a hundred more lines," replied Mary, "you could pass them all now. The difficulty is all gone; press forward. I will await your return here."</p>
               <p>"Wait here?" said both, in one breath, "why we shall be several days away."</p>
               <p>"I will await you here!" repeated Mary emphatically. "Hasten forward; all is clear for you. I may go no further."</p>
               <p>Doubly mystified, but impelled by a power they could not resist, the two spies obeyed the order of their companion, and, quickly passed through the gap that Mary Murdock had opened for them, they were soon within the lines of the Army of the Potomac, making their way to Washington.</p>
               <p>When they were gone out of sight, the demon girl, uttering some wild incantation in a low tone, cast away the sheet that she had folded about her when about to cross the field toward the picket. As she did so, she muttered:</p>
               <p>"Silly men! they know not who it was that assisted them on their errand of wickedness! But I must get my arrow," continued the speaker, turning and hurrying back to where the unfortunate volunteer lay dead.</p>
               <p>"Much depended on your death, soldier!" she said, in almost a bated whisper, gazing down upon the pale, upturned face. "And," continued she, as she plucked the arrow from the breast of the corpse, "if no adverse influence is at hand, all is well with treason!"</p>
               <p>Thus speaking, Mary Murdock stepped lightly away as though she had committed no crime, and wended her way back to the farmhouse at which she had purchased the sheets.</p>
               <p>When the guard, in making their next round, came upon the frozen body of the Union soldier, who had thus fallen a victim to midnight assassination, they examined his wound, and decided that he had been shot by some skulking, cowardly "bushwhacker." But the pickets on either side of him were ready to make oath that not a single shot had been fired during the whole night. Some thought of examining the locality, within musket range, for footprints; but this was concluded to be useless. In the first place, the wind had been so high that footprints were, most likely, all drifted over; and even if found, of what utility would the discovery be? Justice could not be meted out to the dastard culprit.</p>
               <p>So, with soldiers' regrets for a comrade, the murdered picket was buried, and another soldier posted in his place.</p>
               <p>His wife Jane, and the "two boys," had received his money, and, with tender solicitude for the dear one far away, battling for the Union, they had well filled a box with comforts and dainties for "Private James Hallowell."</p>
               <p>The box came, but, alas! it was unopened by the intended recipient. The Captain of Hallowell's company wrote to the widow and orphans an account of the murdered husband and father, and added what comfort he could in the <choice>
                     <sic>postcript</sic>
                     <corr>postscript</corr>
                  </choice>, that "the grave, where the body lay, had been marked."</p>
               <p>Sad, sad comfort, indeed, to those whose poverty forbade even a sorrowing visit to the loved one's sepulchre.</p>

               <p>AFTER the departure of Mr. Wetherill from the presence of Mr. Lincoln and General McClellan, the minds of both the latter were too much occupied with matters of public importance to remember, for any length of time, the statement made by the former, that he<pb n="46-47" xml:id="VAC5568-00000012"/> would visit each of them before morning. Consequently, upon retiring, to snatch, if possible, some slight refreshment from slumber, neither one of them took the precaution of surrounding himself with the guards proposed by Mr. Wetherill.</p>
               <p>General McClellan, after wishing the President good night, parted from him, and took his way over to his own headquarters; while Mr. Lincoln, weighed down with the onerous cares of his public position, and the grief attendant upon the death of Willie, his son, cast himself into an arm-chair that was in an anti-chamber of the apartment in which the interview had been held. He fell asleep much sooner than he expected, and slumbered soundly for about two hours. At the expiration of this time, he was gently awakened by a hand that was laid upon his shoulder. He was on his feet in an instant, and fully aroused.</p>
               <p>"Ah! Mr. Lincoln, I beg your pardon for disturbing you; but, as you said you would be pleased to see me in my 'startling visit,' as you were pleased to call it, I felt obliged to take the liberty."</p>
               <p>The person who uttered these words was indeed none other than Mr. Wetherill, who had conversed with the President so shortly before. Mr. Lincoln, though he had thrown a joking sort of gentle irony into the word <emph>startling,</emph> when he had used it to Mr. Wetherill regarding the present visit, was indeed startled. Upon entering the anti-chamber in which he was, he had locked the door communicating with the larger apartment, and thus, as he thought, secured himself from intrusion.</p>
               <p>If his visitor had been a <foreign xml:lang="LAT">bona fide</foreign> spirit, Mr. Lincoln could have satisfied himself with the explanation that the apparition was the result of his own harrassed state of mind, or he could have gone even farther, and allowed the ability generally claimed for apparitions, of passing doubly-locked and barred doors without the slightest inconvenience, or asking of leave. But there before him stood Mr. Wetherill, in his own proper fleshly form. The President, with the cool courage of his nature reached forth his hand to take that of Mr. Wetherill, to convince his own senses that they were not deceived.</p>
               <p>"Well, really, Mr. Wetherill," said he, addressing the latter, "I must confess myself a great deal more startled than if I had seen you in the spirit, for then I could, perhaps, have satisfied myself, or rather mystified myself, with an application of those half-beclouded doctrines of Mesmerism and Spiritualism. You must certainly possess some strange powers that have never yet been brought to the notice of the world."</p>
               <p>"I saw from your manner this evening, your Excellency," answered Mr. Wetherill, "that you deemed at least a portion of what I said to be the language of an unreasonable enthusiast. Therefore I resolved upon this visit. I will not detain you now, your Excellency, longer than to receive your assurance of an interview to-morrow at two o'clock, privately, if you choose, or in the presence of General McClellan."</p>
               <p>"May I name a condition thereof, Mr. Wetherill?" asked the President.</p>
               <p>"That is a right you already enjoy, your Excellency," replied the other, "and, therefore, needs not my assent; name it, if you please."</p>
               <p>"Then, will you," returned Mr. Lincoln, "give me an extra proof of your mysterious power by making your way into my presence, at the hour you have set to-morrow, without the knowledge of any one?"</p>
               <p>"With pleasure," was the prompt reply; "and I will, besides, add what I said this evening, that you may place as many guards about you as you choose, and give them express orders not to admit me, yet you shall see me in my own proper person at two o'clock, or as near it as possible."</p>
               <p>"Really, you astound me, Mr. Wetherill," rejoined the President; "but, to make the proof completely satisfactory, I will issue the orders you suggest, and General McClellan and I will await you in the next apartment."</p>
               <p>"Very good, your Excellency, I must now, however, leave you to fulfil my promise to the General. I will be punctual. Good night."</p>
               <p>"Good night, sir," replied the President, as his visitor turned to leave the room.</p>
               <p>The only exit, as we have recorded, was the door leading into the larger apartment, in which the first interview had been held between the President, General McClellan, and Mr. Wetherill. This Mr. Wetherill opened without the slightest difficulty—a fact that served only to increase the President's astonishment, for, as he had been sleeping when his visitor came in, he did not know whether the entrance of the latter had been effected by way of the door or window. The bolt that secured the former always made a grating noise when turned, and would certainly have roused any slumberer. So deeply mystified was the President altogether, that he was entirely at a loss what to think of the mysterious Mr. Wetherill.</p>
               <p>The latter, upon leaving Mr. Lincoln, set out straightway for the headquarters of General McClellan, who though, as we have previously said, too much occupied with his duties to order an<pb n="48-49" xml:id="VAC5568-00000013"/> extra guard, was nevertheless regularly guarded, as military discipline required. The indefatigable soldier had merely thrown himself upon a lounge, slept about an hour and a half, and then risen to prosecute the details of a plan that he was maturing. Two sentinels, fully armed, stood immediately outside the door of their commander's room, and rough usage awaited that man who should dare to force a passage into the presence of the General without his order.</p>
               <p>McClellan was attentively engaged pointing off a military map at the moment that the voice of Mr. Wetherill fell upon his ear, and so engrossed was he at the moment, that the intruder was obliged to repeat his salutation ere the General's attention was called from his task. His astonishment was most profound as he thus beheld, in the presence of Mr. Wetherill, the fulfilment of an assertion to which he had not attached any extraordinary importance; his statement to Mr. Lincoln of his boyhood remembrance to the contrary notwithstanding.</p>
               <p>Mr. Wetherill, after exchanging a few words with McClellan, and shaking his hand in the same manner as he had the President's, in order to assure him that there was no illusion, took his departure. The General, who accompanied him to the doorway, and "<emph>passed</emph>" him out, was as much amazed as Mr. Lincoln had been, at the startling fact which had thus been brought so conspicuously to his notice.</p>
               <p>This amazement was rather increased by two o'clock in the afternoon of the next day, at which time he met, according to appointment, Mr. Lincoln and the singular Wetherill. The anxiety of both may be inferred from the fact that they were in the apartment where the conference was to be held, fully a quarter of an hour before the appointed time. The President had completed such arrangements that it would be impossible for any one to reach his presence, at least by any of the hocus-pocus means that magicians might employ, and both he and General McClellan awaited the appearance of Wetherill with much anxiety.</p>
               <p>Two o'clock came and passed; it was five minutes after, and, as the President held his watch in his hand, he said to McClellan, with a smile:</p>
               <p>"Our mysterious friend, doubtless owing to the barriers I have put in his way, is not very punctual. And I am inclined to think that he will miss the appointment altogether, through my fault, eh? I must certainly make an apology to him if he chances near me again."</p>
               <p>"No apology whatever is needed, your Excellency," exclaimed the voice of Wetherill at this moment.</p>
               <p>Mr. Lincoln and McClellan, who had been looking toward the door by which they expected their guest to come, both turned as the voice fell upon their ears, and there, standing in the middle of the apartment, was Wetherill.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER IV.</head>
               <head type="sub">GENERAL M'CLELLAN MAKES A SINGULAR DISCOVERY.</head>
               <p>THE President glanced first at the Englishman, and then at General McClellan, with a look that said, as clearly as words could have done, "Well, I will have to shoulder the responsibility of the mistake."</p>
               <p>Then, stepping forward, he took the hand of the former, and said, in his honest, straight-forward manner:</p>
               <p>"Mr. Wetherill, I must acknowledge fully the powers you claim. I took every precaution to prevent your ingress, and yet you are here. But pray be seated, and let us have some talk about this matter."</p>
               <p>The visitor, acceding to the request of Mr. Lincoln, placed himself in one of three chairs close at hand, while his two companions took the others.</p>
               <p>"Now, Mr. Wetherill," resumed the President, after a short pause, "if I understand you aright, you have come from England for the purpose of securing, if possible, the girl of whom Lord Palmerston writes so strongly."</p>
               <p>"That is the object of my journey, your Excellency," rejoined Mr. Wetherill, without hesitation.</p>
               <p>"And she possesses powers of the same mysterious character as you have given such satisfactory evidence of possessing yourself, does she?"</p>
               <p>"She does. At present, however, her powers—which are all used for the furtherance of evil—are limited to a sphere, or circle, so to speak, of smaller dimensions than my own. Yet there have been occasions during my experience with her, that her forces, or rather the forces possessing her, have been stronger or more positive than mine. With the exception of these occasions, I have always been able to control her by constant attention and prompt action."</p>
               <pb n="50-51" xml:id="VAC5568-00000014"/>
               <p>"Well, Mr. Wetherill," said General McClellan, "from what you have said previously, I should judge that she is now beyond your control, owing to the fact of your sudden illness. Can she, while thus freed from your influence, do harm, that the exercise of your own powers could not annual or defeat?"</p>
               <p>"Should she once consummate any plot of evil," returned Mr. Wetherill, "no power of mine could undo it, or even palliate its effects, But, if I throw my influence around her ere this <choice>
                     <sic>consumation</sic>
                     <corr>consummation</corr>
                  </choice> has been reached, I can defeat her most promising projects, not without a struggle, it is true; and the nearer completion she should have her plot, the more terrible would this struggle be."</p>
               <p>"And are the amazing powers, Mr. Wetherill," asked the President, with the deepest interest in his tones, "the fruit of science?"</p>
               <p>"Not in the common idea of the word science, your Excellency, but they are the fruit of deep and untiring investigation of those mental science, which, like the productions of Milton, are more talked of than studied."</p>
               <p>"And you say they are within the reach of any ordinary mind that will make the necessary researches."</p>
               <p>"I firmly believe they are, your Excellency."</p>
               <p>"And has Lord Palmerston ever made any of the investigation of which you speak?"</p>
               <p>"He has, your Excellency, at least so far as to convince himself of the truth and rationality of the doctrine or science."</p>
               <p>Mr. Lincoln here read with slowness and care the nobleman's letter, which had been left with him by Mr. Wetherill on the previous evening. When he had finished, he remarked, with much emphasis:</p>
               <p>"The more I think, and the more I hear of this singular being; Mr. Wetherill, the more thrillingly interested am I in her. Certainly, a gentleman of Lord Palmerston's age and attainments would not use such phrase as 'diabolical phenomenon of Nature,' in regard to a young and beautiful girl, without some good foundation therefor. And I must acknowledge, sir, that her powers, and also your own, have awakened in me a feeling that I can hardly describe. It is not a superstition, it is not an alarm; and yet there is somewhat of each of these mixed up in it. Perhaps you can imagine what it is."</p>
               <p>"I think I can, your Excellency," replied Mr. Wetherill.</p>
               <p>General McClellan was at this moment about to make some remark; but he was suddenly interrupted by Mr. Wetherill, who, starting involuntarily to his feet, exclaimed:</p>
               <p>"She is at her evil work! I feel her influence; not directly, but through <emph>one or two</emph> intermediate parties. The stroke, whatever it is, General, is directed toward the army under your command, and it is successful."</p>
               <p>General McClellan glanced at the President, and the President glanced at him with a baffled expression of countenance, in which many an observer would have said there was shade of suspicion.</p>
               <p>"I must set out for Richmond early in the morning," continued Mr. Wetherill, "for which purpose, I beg your Excellency, you and also General McClellan, will furnish me with authority to leave and re-enter the lines of the Union army."</p>
               <p>Mr. Lincoln has, during his public career, won for himself the reputation of a very direct man; and on the occasion to which we refer, he did not make an exception to this.</p>
               <p>"Mr. Wetherill," said he, as the Englishman ceased speaking, "you are, of course, well aware of the delicate position in which I am placed, as the chief of the United States Government, especially regarding one of your own nation. You are equally aware that there is between the American and British nations a hostile feeling, which, unfortunately, the latter daily renders more bitter. Under these circumstances, notwithstanding the fact that you have come here to render the Union a most valuable assistance, it is necessary, before you receive the power for which you ask, that you go through a certain formula in the presence of the British Minister, Lord Lyons. To this, both on our account and also on your own, I hope you will make no objections."</p>
               <p>"None, whatever, your Excellency," promptly rejoined Mr. Wetherill; "I can fully appreciate the delicacy of your position, and the only regret I have to express in regard to the matter is, the delay that most necessarily occur."</p>
               <p>"No delay, scarcely, at all, Mr. Wetherill," answered the President; "I will order the carriage, and we will all ride over to see him forthwith."</p>
               <p>"Very good, your Excellency, let us go at once."</p>
               <p>The President rang his bell, ordered the servant who answered the summons to have the carriage got out immediately, and, within ten minutes, he and General McClellan and Mr. Wetherill were on their way to visit Lord Lyons.</p>
               <p>Unfortunately, the British Minister had gone out only a few minutes previously, to attend to some private business, and was not expected back until late in the evening.</p>
               <p>This was portion of the delay of which Mr. Wetherill had spoken as likely to occur. But it was unavoidable, as Mr. Lincoln's<pb n="52-53" xml:id="VAC5568-00000015"/> position in regard to public matters required the utmost discreetness, notwithstanding the autograph letter of assurance from Lord Palmerston concerning Mr. Wetherill, and notwithstanding, also, Mr. Wetherill's own assertions.</p>
               <p>The Englishman saw at a glance exactly how Mr. Lincoln was placed, and immediately acquiesced in the necessary detention, remarking, however, at the same time, that he feared some evil would result therefrom. A visit to Lord Lyons was fixed for the next morning, and the three once more parted, the President returning to his mansion, Mr. Wetherill to his hotel, and General McClellan to his headquarters.</p>
               <p>The following day, all were punctually present, and were received by the British Minister with his usual affability. Lord Palmerston's letter he perused with the deepest interest and surprise, after pronouncing it to be genuine. He then entered into a somewhat lengthy conversation with Mr. Wetherill regarding Mary Murdock and Lord Palmerston, upon the conclusion of which he assured Mr. Lincoln and General McClellan that he felt every confidence in vouching for Mr. Wetherill's sincerity.</p>
               <p>The President and the British minister now engaged for a short time in private conversation, the result of which was that Lord Lyons inquired of Mr. Wetherill if he had any objection to passing his word as to the object of his journey.</p>
               <p>Some moments were spent by the Englishman in consideration, and then he replied:</p>
               <p>"Under ordinary circumstances, your Lordship, I would most positively refuse anything of the sort; but as I fully appreciate the difficulty and delicacy of his Excellency's position, and also that of General McClellan, I yield a most ready assent to the requirement."</p>
               <p>"That is all that is necessary then, Mr. Wetherill, and I thank you for your candor," said Mr. Lincoln, stepping forward, and taking the Englishman's hand, "General McClellan," continued he, "will furnish you with the required passes, and if at any time, morning, noon, or midnight, you should wish to see me, your card sent in will gain for you a prompt audience."</p>
               <p>General McClellan immediately wrote the 'general' pass, and placed it in Mr. Wetherill's hand, with some remark in reference to the strange being that the Englishman had made such a long journey to capture.</p>
               <p>Bidding his distinguished companions good morning, Mr. Wetherill took his departure, and lost no time in placing the now historic river Potomac behind him.</p>

                     <head>"On touching her he staggered back several paces, whilst a more deadly pallor spread itself upon his features than before, and his eyes became dim and glassy.—See page 99</head>
                  </figure>
               </p>
               <p>General McClellan having, by this date, about consummated his plans for a grand strategic movement against the Rebel army of Virginia, could hardly spare the time that he had given in connection with Mr. Wetherill, and, therefore, after giving the latter the required pass, he hastened back to his headquarters.</p>
               <p>Here he remained, busily engaged, for several hours, with staff and other officers. At the end of this time, finding himself alone, he went to a certain drawer, in which he had been in the habit of keeping his most valuable and important papers. In this drawer, that was furnished with a peculiar lock, of which he alone had the key, was, in truth, the success or failure of the commander's plans; and he, therefore, guarded it with rigorous care. Not only had he thus securely locked these valuable papers away from sight, but he had also added the precaution of sealing each one up separately.</p>
               <p>The moment he took them from the drawer, it struck him that they were not in the exact order in which he had left them; and a closer examination showed that each had been most adroitly opened, without disfiguring the seal in the slightest degree.</p>
               <p>One after another, the General opened and examined them closely. As he picked up the last, he felt within the folds thereof a small, hard substance, that proved to be <emph>a diamond!</emph> Whether it had fallen from a breast-pin or finger-ring, the astonished General could not decide; but that it had not been dropped by himself, was certain, as he never used diamonds. There was another fact, too, which called his attention. The document in which this stray gem was concealed, bore evidence of having been crumpled somewhat, as though some person copying its contents had been suddenly alarmed, and attempted to thrust it quickly back into its place.</p>
               <p>As McClellan held the paper in one hand, and the precious stone in the other, regarding both with feelings that can be easily understood, a thought suddenly flashed upon his mind that caused him to start. He remembered that Mr. Wetherill, the Englishman, to whom he had so recently given a "general pass," wore a diamond finger-ring, the brilliancy of which had attracted his attention at each interview, except that at the office of Lord Lyons. There he noticed that the ring <emph>was minus its sparkling gem.</emph>
               </p>
               <p>The conclusion was almost inevitable, that Wetherill was the owner of the brilliant, and that he had <emph>lost it while ransacking the contents of the drawer,</emph> and not noticed its loss at the time.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER V.</head>
               <head type="sub">FORWARD, ARMY OF THE POTOMAC!</head>
               <p>GENERAL McClellan's first impulse was to order an instant pursuit and capture of Wetherill; but the latter was by this time safely on the other side of the river, and, besides, the power he had exhibited, to both the General and Mr. Lincoln, of rendering himself actually invisible, convinced McClellan that a chase would only prove fruitless. Strange to say, also, though the circumstantial evidence of the diamond was so positive against Wetherill, yet the very recollection of the Englishman's almost supernatural power gave the General considerable relief; for it induced him to reason thus: If Wetherill had originally designed to act treacherously by the Government, he most certainly had no need to make himself known at all; continual concealment would have been his surest safety. Added to this, was the double weight of Lord Palmerston's voucher and the recommendation of Lord Lyons.</p>
               <p>While pondering the matter, McClellan all at once called to mind the exclamation uttered by Wetherill, on the night previous, in the presence of Mr. Lincoln and himself, concerning Mary Murdock, or, rather, her <emph>secondary influence.</emph> The powers of this mysterious, fearful girl were, according to her guardian, little inferior to his own; and perhaps it had been <emph>her</emph> hands that had thus violated the documents in the private drawer. In either case, whoever was the culprit, the result would undoubtedly be the same, viz., the information contained in the documents, and especially valuable to the rebel commanders, would certainly be conveyed to the latter.</p>
               <p>Had he been fully prepared to move at once, General McClellan would not have cared much for the discovery; but he was waiting for other parties to perform certain duties, which they were delaying from day to day. Over these parties he could exercise no control, but was himself dependent upon their action in his own movements.</p>
               <p>Among the papers in the drawer, was President Lincoln's first war order, dated January 27th, and peremptorily commanding a general advance upon the rebellion, by the Union Army and Navy, on February 22d. McClellan felt confident that, if the fact of the existence of this order reached the rebel commanders, and also his own plans of an advance on Richmond by way of the Peninsula, he would quickly be informed of it by the evacuation of their stronghold at Manassas, and that also at Columbus.</p>
               <p>Without delay, General McClellan sought Mr. Lincoln, and communicated to him the facts in relation to the violated papers. He also imparted to him his own thoughts about the matter.</p>
               <p>"It is too bad, indeed, General," replied the President, "it is too bad that, just as we are about to reach a consummation of our plans, our joy and hope are dashed to earth by skulking traitors. But, as I told you when you first came to Washington, General, we are constantly surrounded by them. However, we must do the best we can. If the Rebels have obtained the information, and take advantage of it, we'll have to peg away at them any way."</p>
               <p>General McClellan had expected correctly, for a week did not pass ere his scouts brought intelligence to him of certain strange movements on the part of the Rebel army, looking toward a general falling back, especially with the Army of Virginia. The intended surprise, therefore, which, if successful, would have been the grandest achievement of the War, was frustrated; and all that remained to McClellan was, as the President had suggested, to do the best he could, and "peg away at the Rebels any way."</p>
               <p>He at once ordered an advance by General Banks, who accordingly pushed his column toward Winchester. With the most strenuous exertions on his part, however, McClellan could not get the main body of his army in motion until the Tenth of March, when, with wildly beating hearts, and with the prayers and blessings of the whole loyal nation following it, the Grand Army of the Potomac commenced its memorable series of marches, campaigns, victories, and disasters. This is no place to discuss the qualifications or the shortcomings of the officers who have alternately commanded this splendid host; but the nation must join with us when, while reminding it of Antietam and Gettysburg, we exclaim:</p>
               <p>"God bless the Army of the Potomac!"</p>
               <p>But to return to our narrative.</p>
               <p>As we have previously recorded, Mr. Wetherill, upon leaving the office of Lord Lyons, armed with the "general pass," of McClellan, was not long in placing the historic river Potomac behind him, nor was he much longer in placing the outer Union picket line in the same position. It must not be supposed for an instant, however, that the task before him was an easy one. It was, on the contrary, one requiring the most extreme caution and nerve; for, though his powers were so much stronger than those possessed by his terrible ward, still he might, if not cautious, find himself taken by the latter<pb n="64-65" xml:id="VAC5568-00000018"/> at a disadvantage, and in that case, he was perfectly aware that his doom, at least on earth, was sealed. He therefore halted at Matildaville, at which place we shall leave him for awhile, and once more return to the beautiful demon, Mary Murdock, and the two spies, whose passage through the Union lines she had rendered so comparatively easy.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER VI.</head>
               <head type="sub">THE DEATH SLUMBER.</head>
               <p>MARY MURDOCK, upon returning to the farm-house at which she had purchased the three sheets wherewith to disguise herself and companions while approaching the Union picket line, immediately retired to a chamber that the farmer's wife had, according to her request, made ready for her.</p>
               <p>The proprietor of this house was a most bitter secessionist, and was, at the time of which we write, away at Richmond, attending to some flour contracts for the Rebel government. His family were as firmly attached to the so-called Confederacy as he was, and consequently our beautiful demon was treated with the utmost consideration.</p>
               <p>Upon reaching her room, Mary Murdock cast herself upon the soft, downy couch that invited her to repose, and scarcely had her long, soft tresses spread themselves upon the snowy pillow, than her eyelids closed over her blue orbs, and she slept! What a picture of ravishing beauty and innocent purity did she present to the casual eye. Her face, oval in form, and like the summer blush of day-dawn, in its mingling white and carmine; her long eyelashes poetically fringing their lids; her delicately penciled brows breaking, with a strange charm, the sweep of marble forehead; and her sweetly appearing lips gently parted, as though magnanimously just to the pearly teeth within. One hand rested carelessly by her side, while the other,—the one that had so shortly before guided the deadly shaft to the Union soldier's life,—lay softly, like a snow flake, above the heart that regularly pulsed her half-discovered bosom.</p>
               <p>The lovely sleeper, in form an angel, in soul a demon, had not slumbered a minute ere her breathing became visibly less strong, and, before the second minute had passed, the most delicate tests could have shown no life in her. Her limbs were rigid as hewn marble, and her heart as still as Death's potent touch could ever make it.</p>
               <p>Previous to retiring, she had, with much emphasis, stated to her hostess, that, on no account whatever, did she wish to be disturbed until noon of the succeeding day. And, until within half an hour of the time named, did she remain in the inanimate state we have described. At this hour, however, she seemed gradually to resuscitate, though still remaining asleep. Her life came back much more gradually than it had deserted her. It returned without sudden shock, and set her physical forces in motion, just as the skillfully ruled steam of the engineer puts his shafts and pulleys in motion, slowly and in regular order.</p>
               <p>The moment her vitality seemed to be fully restored to its original strength, Mary Murdock suddenly awoke, and rose from her couch without an instant's delay; not with the heavy languor of a person who has been profoundly slumbering for a long time, but with the restless vigor of some one who, having been absent awhile, steps quickly back in search of something.</p>
               <p>"Vain egotist!" she muttered, as she arose; "he imagines himself my master, my superior! but a higher power guides us both, and he is, as well as I, a mere puppet of that Being whose plans angels, men, and demons alike are forced to accomplish. True they say I am doomed to pass from earth by his hand; but if I am, I will not go alone. And until I do go, my pleasure shall be unalloyed by deeds of goodness or mercy."</p>
               <p>While speaking, Mary Murdock stepped to where she had laid down the muslin case containing the weapon with which she had shed the blood of private James Hallowell. Taking from it the arrow whose point and blade were deeply ensanguined, she continued:</p>
               <p>"Shot, on picket duty! ha! ha! Well done, faithful shaft, your flight has carried sorrow and want to one household, and will yet do the same to thousands of other households, South well as North. Your keen point has breached the bank that hedged in the Union, and has made a way for Treason's flood to rush through, and Treason should make the most of it ere the ebb comes!"</p>
               <p>At this moment a daughter of her hostess knocked at the chamber door very gently, and called out, in tones equally gentle:</p>
               <p>"Miss Murdock!"</p>
               <p>"I have risen, my dear, and will come down in a moment or two,"<pb n="66-67" xml:id="VAC5568-00000019"/> answered the fair guest, still holding the blood-stained arrow in her hand, but not moving a step toward the door.</p>
               <p>"Mother will have dinner on the table, then, by the time you get down."</p>
               <p>With this rejoinder, the farmer's daughter tripped lightly away down stairs.</p>
               <p>Meanwhile, Mary Murdock hastily cleaned the arrow, and returned it to the muslin case. This done, she descended to the dinner-room, where Mrs. Tibbett, her hostess, was busily engaged, assisted by her daughter, in setting upon the board the various dishes composing a good, substantial farm-house meal.</p>
               <p>With that graceful ease of manner which belongs only to those of the most refined class of society, Mrs. Tibbett's lovely visitor seated herself at the table, and partook sparingly of the fare which was set before her in such abundance. While thus engaged, she kept up a continual and varied conversation, so pleasing to Mrs. Tibbett and her children, that they were delighted with her.</p>
               <p>Much in this manner Mary Murdock passed away three days, never during the time mentioned, however, going outside of the farm-house; but, on the contrary, remaining alone in her own room for many hours together. How she engaged herself while thus alone, Mrs. Tibbett—who was endowed by Nature with at least double the amount of curiosity generally allotted to women—became very anxious to ascertain. She, therefore, determined to conceal herself in her guest's chamber, and watch her. With this, as she considered it, innocent object, she took advantage of an opportunity that offered just after dinner, to slip into Miss Murdock's room. There she ensconced herself within a large, old-fashioned clothes-press, and had just begun to deem herself wonderfully sharp, when the door of her asylum was suddenly thrown open. As this was done, Mrs. Tibbett was confronted by Mary Murdock, who, with one of her peculiar, fiendish looks, pointed silently to the doorway through which her hostess had entered the chamber. Mrs. Tibbett, nearly terrified into spasms by that terribly malignant countenance, obeyed instantly and mechanically. No one witnessed the affair; and the farmer's wife, burying her chagrin with her defeated curiosity, resolved, wisely enough, to say nothing about what had occurred.</p>
               <p>On the night of the third day, Mary Murdock left the farm-house at rather a late hour, and took her way across the country to a spot close to where she had murdered the Union soldier, James Hallowell. With her she carried the muslin case that had so excited the wonder of the two Rebel spies, and, upon coming within reach of the Federal picket line, she undid it, and took therefrom the fatal white bow. A few moments sufficed for her to fit the string and choose an arrow, and then, half whispering one of her wild incantations, the startling creature hurried forward to her work of blood. Soon, in the grayish light of the night, she saw a Union soldier faithfully performing his duty of guarding the approaches to the army, while here and there, on either side of him, she could just distinguish the moving shadows of his trusty comrades, and the dim, momentary glittering of their bayonets.</p>
               <p>In a moment more, the demon was aroused within her, and her eyes began to burn with hellish fire as, muttering some cabalistic formulæ, she hastily but noiselessly neared the doomed man she had first seen. She carried three arrows, the last of which she sent on its errand of murder almost before its fellow-shafts had ceased to quiver in the breasts of two Union pickets. With a ruthless delight, the horrible being bounded forward and plucked the blood-stained shafts from her victims, and sent each on its second flight ere she stayed her hand.</p>
               <p>In front of, and some fifty yards distant from, the positions that had been held by the murdered pickets, was a deep gully, or rather fissure in the ground, whose sides were thickly grown with bushes and dwarfed trees. There was neither entrance nor exit to this fissure, and its depth even the most adventurous never settled. The more superstitious inhabitants of that region often declared that, many years ago, smoke, and even flames, had been seen to issue from it, while deep rumblings were often heard far down between its rugged walls.</p>
               <p>This singular and mysterious gulf offered a fitting casket in which the darkest deeds of blood could be forever hidden from the world, and from some motive or other, Mary Murdock suddenly resolved to cast the bodies of her victims into its yawning jaws. With a strength and ease that no physical frame of three times her size could boast, this girl demon seized the bodies, one after another, hurried them to the edge of the abyss, and tumbled them, muskets and all, down, down, far down, until the faint, dull sounds of their falling failed to reach the ear.</p>
               <p>"Missing! <emph>Deserted!</emph> ha! that will add a pang or two to some one's sorrow!"</p>
               <p>These words came gloatingly from between the lips of the beautiful murderess, as she turned away from the fissure after hurling down the last of the six bodies.</p>
               <p>It so happened that four of the six dead soldiers had, just before<pb n="68-69" xml:id="VAC5568-00000020"/> being detailed for picket duty, come out of punishment for some offence of which they had asseverated their innocence. When, therefore, the officer in charge of the relief, who chanced also to be aware of the facts, found their posts vacant, and no signs of their bodies or arms about, he immediately concluded that they had in anger deserted to the enemy, after persuading their two comrades to join them in their perfidy. Deep and strong were the curses uttered against the absent soldiers by their incensed comrades; and an entry was made on the roll opposite each of their names, "<emph>Deserted to the Rebels.</emph>" In due time, this news reached their homes and families, and overwhelmed their relations and friends with shame and sorrow.</p>
               <p>One patriotic old mother, who had sent her son, the only prop of her declining years, to battle for the country she loved, was stricken to her death-bed by the news of his defection. But, as she was about to expire, some good angel of God plucked the rankling thorn from her heart, and she cried out, with the last breath of her earthly life:</p>
               <p>"Thank God, my George <emph>didn't</emph> desert!"</p>
               <p>The girl demon, whose blood-guilty hands had wrought all this sorrow, did not seek to pass through the second gap that, with her strange weapon, she had made in the line of the Army of the Potomac; but she quietly remained near the scene of the tragedy, awaiting the coming of, the two rebel spies. How she became aware of the precise time at which the latter were to arrive at the designated spot, was certainly through no human agency; for, since their departure for Washington, she had held no communication with any one save Mrs. Tibbett and her family. Yet, with such marvellous correctness had she marked the time of their arrival that not more than twenty minutes elapsed after the completion of her barbarous deed, ere the spies came cautiously, like spectres, down the road.</p>
               <p>As they approached close to where she stood, she stepped out into their way so abruptly as to cause both to start back and draw their revolvers.</p>
               <p>Of this precautionary, and, to her, apparently perilous act, she took not the slightest notice, but said:</p>
               <p>"Delay not, but hasten to Richmond with the fruits you have gathered. I will follow you Immediately."</p>
               <p>On the instant her companions recognized their singular friend, and one of them whispered, in an anxious, warning tone:</p>
               <p>"Hist! Miss Murdock; we must be close to the last line."</p>
               <p>"Did I not tell you," replied she, "when I parted from you, that I would await your arrival here, and take away all peril from you in repassing the Union line? And I have done so," she continued, answering her own question, "by slaying six men; and, until guard is again mounted, you are as safe here as though you were in Richmond. But I must be gone."</p>
               <p>With these words Mary Murdock abruptly plunged away into a clump of woodland close at hand, and was quickly lost to view.</p>
               <p>The two rebel spies, as may readily be supposed, were men of no high standard of moral character; yet they seemed half shocked to hear a lovely young female speak so frigidly concerning six deliberate murders committed, within the last hour, by herself. But each, within his own breast, came to the conclusion that she was a murderous monomaniac, and tolerable only on account of the assistance she was rendering, and might render, to the cause of the Rebellion.</p>
               <p>As it would be impossible for the spies to reach a train bound to Richmond until the next afternoon, they concluded to remain, in the meantime, at the farm-house of Mr. Tibbett. They saw no more, however, of their singular companion, until they reached Orange Court House. Here she once more joined them; but how she had got there they could not tell; for they themselves had taken the first train, and had not been delayed on the road. They were certain, too, that she had not been aboard previously, as, for particular reasons, they had passed several times through each car. There was, therefore, but one conclusion, and that a seemingly impossible one, to which they could come,—that she had set out on foot, or by some carriage conveyance, and beaten the train.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER VII.</head>
               <head type="sub">THE DIAMOND MYSTERY CLEARED.</head>
               <p>THE beautiful demon, on entering the car in which were the two rebel spies, seated herself, with a pleasant remark, between them. In her hand she carried the muslin case from which they had seen her draw the deadly bow and arrow that had rendered them such good assistance. Now each of them noticed at the same instant that, besides its regular contents, the case or bag concealed some living creature.</p>
               <p>As they glanced at it, however, Mary Murdock quickly slid her hand downward until it grasped the animal, and, like a flash of<pb n="70-71" xml:id="VAC5568-00000021"/> light, all motion ceased. An undefined, half vague dread took possession of her two companions at this moment, and both involuntarily drew themselves somewhat from her.</p>
               <p>Between the point at which she entered the cars and Richmond, Mary Murdock was several times lost sight of by her co-laborers in the Rebellion's cause. Upon reaching the Capital of the Confederacy, however, they found that she intended to accompany them to see Jeff. Davis. This they relished not at all, for several reasons, the strongest of which was that they disliked to be obliged to acknowledge the assistance that had been rendered to them by the fair but fearful girl. But rid themselves of her they could not by any of the indirect means they used; and their knowledge of the light in which their master, Davis, regarded her, prevented them from adopting direct means. So, with Fear and Envy striving for the ascendancy in their breasts, they accompanied her, or, rather, she accompanied them, into the presence of the rebel President, who was consuming with anxiety to hear a report of their enterprise.</p>
               <p>"Let me have first," said Davis, addressing one of the spies, "a brief outline account of your adventure after you left me. You must have had more than ordinary good fortune or assistance to have obtained such valuable documents as these."</p>
               <p>Davis, as he spoke, glanced at the fair fiend, and the spy, noting the act, determined at once to give Mary Murdock her due credit, as a matter of policy.</p>
               <p>"Well, Mr. Davis," he therefore replied, "we owe our whole success to Miss Murdock; for, without her aid, I fear we would have been unable to get through the Union picket line. A well-directed arrow from her bow closed the eyes of a Yankee soldier in death; and so we passed."</p>
               <p>"A bow and arrow!" exclaimed Davis. "A most capital idea; no noise, and consequently no alarm. But," continued he, "that was only the first peril overcome."</p>
               <p>"Well, Mr. Davis," continued the spy, "from that moment out we enjoyed the most remarkable good fortune. Whenever we came near a sentinel, he suddenly seemed to become half stupefied; and all the way to Washington, even across the bridge, we were never once challenged, though, on some occasions, we passed as close to the guard as we are to you now. In Washington, to have seen us, you would have thought that we were regularly recognized Yankee officials, until, one day, as I was sitting in McClellan's headquarters, overhauling some of his most precious documents, I felt a kind of shock come over me, a shock which resembled that you receive from an electrical battery.</p>
               <p>It was a sudden and deadly fear of discovery. I had the last paper out of the drawer, and had copied nearly all of it in short hand, at the moment I experienced this strange feeling. In my trepidation I crammed the document, together with another, into the drawer from which I had taken it, and with such haste as to crush the paper, and break out of its setting a valuable diamond. The precious stone fell, I think, among the papers in the drawer, but I did not wait to search for it; the peril was too imminent; but, as I hurried from the apartment, I consoled myself with the fact that the Yankee General had bought the gem at a higher price than he would relish.</p>
               <p>"Both of us immediately set out for Richmond with the fruits of our adventure, and reached the last Union line in the middle of the night. Here we feared we should meet with trouble; but our guardian angel, Miss Murdock, had again cleared our path, by slaying six Yankee pickets, with her own hand."</p>
               <p>"I thank you, in the name of the Southern Confederacy, Miss Murdock," exclaimed the rebel President, turning to our heroine, who, during the whole conversation, had done naught but listen.</p>
               <p>"No thanks, President Davis," replied she, in a strange tone,—"such is my mission. But I would speak a few words with you privately," continued she, stepping to the rebel President, who instantly inclined his head forward, that she might whisper in his ear.</p>
               <p>As the beautiful but terrible girl communicated what she had to say to Davis, he glanced now and then at one of the spies with a kind of suspicious look; and when his fair companion had finished, he turned to the other two, and said:</p>
               <p>"Gentlemen, I will retain these valuable documents myself, instead of sending you with them to either of the Departments. Meet me here in the morning, at ten o'clock."</p>
               <p>Upon receiving this intimation that the rebel President wished to be alone, the spies immediately arose, and bade him and Miss Murdock good evening. That each of these men had been deeply mystified by the powers exhibited by Mary Murdock, and deeply enamored of her beauty, were undeniable; but until the present moment, neither of them had deemed her more than an extraordinary girl. Now, however, they began to appreciate her more correctly, and a strange awe took possession of them in consequence.</p>
               <p>When they had gone, Davis said to his fair companion:</p>
               <p>"Surely, Miss Murdock, is that man Wilson such a double traitor as that?"</p>
               <p>"He is, President Davis," replied Mary. "He intends to work himself into your confidence by this action, and when he ascertains the<pb n="72-73" xml:id="VAC5568-00000022"/> plans you may adopt for the defeat of the Federal movements, he will instantly desert you, carry all the information he can obtain to the Union Government, sell it at a high price, and remain thereafter in affluence at the North."</p>
               <p>"It would certainly be advisable for him to do so after that," remarked the rebel President, with compressed lips. "But," continued he, "I will secure him before morning dawns."</p>
               <p>At this moment an aid entered the apartment, and stood awaiting the leisure of Davis, who, excusing himself to the girl demon, stepped to his aid. The latter said to him, in a low tone:</p>
               <p>"Your Excellency, the gentlemen are awaiting you in your private parlor."</p>
               <p>"Ah, yes; well, tell them I will join them in a few moments."</p>
               <p>Again Davis was alone with Mary Murdock.</p>
               <p>"Miss Murdock," said he to her, "I am behind the hour that I set to meet some gentlemen, on whose experience and judgment I have such dependence that I advise with them on all matters of public importance."</p>
               <p>The speaker paused, in order to give the girl demon an opportunity to excuse herself and withdraw. But, so far from having his expectations fulfilled, Davis was appalled by the actual result of his words. Fixing upon him her fiercely burning eyes, the terrible creature exclaimed:</p>
               <p>"Must I again give you an example of my power to command your confidence, President Davis? Without my aid at every step of the way, your two spies, who have just quitted our presence, could never have reached Washington; and even had they done so, they could not have obtained those very documents you now hold in your hand. I am fully aware of the object of the meetings you hold with these gentlemen you refer to. They, like yourself, are traitors. You and they love to plot evil. My pleasure it has been, and still shall be, to assist you. Henceforward let there be no lack of confidence in me on your part. Go, and, at the proper moment, I will come into the midst of your conclave. No excuse,—no reply," continued the fearful speaker, as Davis was about to say something; "do as I wish."</p>
               <p>With these words, came an imperious wave of Mary Murdock's hand, that seemed to be more potent than a sceptre; for, as though incapable of resistance, the rebel President silently left the apartment.</p>
               <p>Striding up the staircase, he quickly reached a moderate-sized room, in which were assembled some five or six men. Two of these were well known, not only in the South, but also in the North, as ambitious politicians, whose principles and character were of the fiercest stamp. The others were men of far deeper mind and calibre, but of equally unhealthy moral parts. Epaulets and spurs, that adorned two of the group, showed that the rebel military power was represented, as well as the civil.</p>
               <p>"Why, brother Davis!" exclaimed several voices at once, as the traitor President entered the room; "you are excessively pale; what has occured? Has our army at Manassas been overthrown or captured?"</p>
               <p>"So far from that, gentlemen, all goes swimmingly with the Confederacy," replied Davis, smiling graciously, and suddenly assuming a cheerfulness he felt not.</p>
               <p>"Well, thank Heaven for that," answered one of the group. "But pray be seated, your Excellency," added the speaker, pushing a chair toward Davis, who, seating himself, placed the documents he carried in his hand, upon the table round which his advisers sat.</p>
               <p>"Gentlemen," said he, "read these; they will please you beyond a doubt, and prove to you that our infant Confederacy is befriended by powerful allies."</p>
               <p>One after another the papers were perused and handed round until all had acquainted themselves with their contents.</p>
               <p>"That is glorious!" exclaimed one of the group, "that is glorious! Now is the time for an advance. A well executed flank movement will give us Washington itself, and holding that we hold the balance of power."</p>
               <p>"I disagree with you, General," said Davis in a very positive manner, "and I will explain, why. Suppose you capture Washington, with every gun and man in it. You have won, it is true, a splendid victory for the South; but you have at the same moment infuriated the whole North to madness, and, rising in its tremendous power, it would crush us back with its more bulk."</p>
               <p>Each added his opinion, and the rebel President finally found himself opposed to a majority. For the last time he was about to once more defend the position he had taken, when suddenly all present, except himself, were astonished at beholding a young and lovely female enter the apartment, bearing in her hand a long muslim case.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER VIII.</head>
               <head type="sub">THE REBEL CONCLAVE.</head>
               <p>AS Mary Murdock stepped forward into the room where the conspirators sat, they glanced one at another, and then at Davis, who, instead of saying what he intended at the moment of the interruption, rose to his feet, and introduced the new comer in the following language:</p>
               <p>"Gentlemen, allow me to present to you Miss Mary Murdock, the young lady to whom the two spies I sent to Washington, and consequently ourselves, are indebted for the most valuable information that I have just communicated to you."</p>
               <p>The conspirators immediately rose, bowed to the beautiful intruder, and re-seated themselves.</p>
               <p>"Miss Murdock," continued the rebel President, "is a true and staunch friend of our Confederacy, gentlemen; and, being gifted with powers not vouchsafed to ordinary mortals, is capable of rendering us the most unexpected and signal service. Wherefore are you here, Miss Murdock?"</p>
               <p>These last words were spoken in a kindly tone, to the girl demon, who, advancing a step or two further toward the table at which the traitors were sitting, replied:</p>
               <p>"I am here that I may give my voice in your council. You are divided in opinion; division leads to weakness; weakness leads to destruction."</p>
               <p>Several countenances exhibited signs of impatience at this moment, that a girl should speak thus to men of age and long experience; but, altogether unheedful thereof, Mary Murdock continued:</p>
               <p>"You would have your rebellion crowned with success; you must, therefore, keep always in view two objects—the firm uniting of the South and the division of the North. For the latter, there is but one way to accomplish it, and that is thus:"</p>
               <p>With these words, the startling, terrible girl whirled from beneath a mantle she wore a huge living serpent of the copperhead species, and flung it, contorted and fiercely hissing, upon the table. The effect was electrical. Some of the traitorous conspirators started to their feet, some leaped convulsively back, and others sat as though helpless from fear. The next moment, Mary Murdock sprang<pb n="84 (Illustration) -85" xml:id="VAC5568-00000024"/>
                  <figure>
                     <head>"The serpent!" exclaimed the girl demon, "the serpent is your true ally! your most potent friend! seek not to cope even-handed with the North, or you are defeated already!"—See opposite page.</head>
                  </figure> forward, and seizing the serpent, caused it to become pacified; and the reptile slowly began to move about the table, never seeking to get off the latter, and yet ever and anon rearing its loathsome head and displaying its fearful fangs.</p>
               <p>"There is your success!" exclaimed the girl demon, extended her arm and pointing to the snake; "divide the North by the subtility and venom of the serpent. The serpent, the serpent is your true ally, your most potent friend. Seek not to cope even-handed, strength for strength, with the North or you are defeated already. I am your friend, the friend of your wicked cause, because it works evil in the land. It carries bitter sorrow and suffering to thousands of once happy homes; therefore I love it. For a limited time I can serve it well, and I will do so. I have already rendered it some little service as an earnest of the future. Ere morning I will render it another. Remember the serpent is your—our best friend!"</p>
               <p>As she thus spoke, Mary Murdock grasped the reptile she had flung upon the table, and concealing it again beneath her mantle, she bade the assembled conclave adieu, and left them, with the exception of Davis himself, almost stupefied with amazement. Inquiring glances were exchanged as the startling intruder withdrew, and all seemed at a loss what to think or say.</p>
               <p>At this juncture, Davis explained to his companions that Miss Murdock was one of those marvellous phenomena that now and then astonish mankind with their supernatural powers and attributes. He explained in what manner she had served the cause of the Rebellion, and predicted that she would ere long render the Confederacy as much material aid as a body of a hundred thousand well armed troops. The traitors were more astonished than ever; in fact, so deep was the impression that the action and personal appearance of Mary Murdock had made upon them, that, although they had met for the purpose of consulting on most important matters, they spent the rest of the evening in conversation relative to her. Consequently another meeting was necessarily appointed for the next day.</p>
               <p>Immediately upon parting from his friends, the rebel President sent for a confidential officer, one of those vile tools that are always to be found about tyrants, and ordered him to arrest Wilson, the spy, concerning whom Mary Murdock had spoken to him. The officer forthwith set out for the residence of the doomed man, but upon arriving there, ascertained that he had gone out shortly before with a young lady; whither he had gone or when he would return, no one could tell. So the officer returned to Davis, who, upon hearing the facts, ordered him to go back and keep a strict watch<pb n="86-87" xml:id="VAC5568-00000025"/> upon the house, until at least noon of the next day. If the spy should, in the meantime, go out or come in, he was to watch him until night fell, when at a favorable moment, he was to arrest him.</p>
               <p>The officer promptly obeyed, and taking up his designated position, faithfully performed the part that had been assigned to him. His diligence, however, met with no reward; and at noon he reported his non-success to Davis, who relieved him from further attention to the matter. This course of the rebel President had its explanation in the fact, that about ten o'clock in the morning he had received a visit from Mary Murdock. The fearful girl naively informed him that having determined it was better for Wilson to die, she had easily compassed his death.</p>
               <p>"He is quiet enough now, President Davis," she added. "You need have no further fear of his treachery. I saw him die,—he died by my hand."</p>
               <p>The rebel President, having taken the advice of the demon girl, did not attempt the assumption of a horror that he did not feel, at the narration of her deed of blood. On the contrary, he grasped her hand, and expressed his satisfaction in the strongest terms.</p>
               <p>After some further conversation, Mary Murdock remarked:</p>
               <p>"President Davis, when I first joined myself to your cause, I believed myself capable of rendering it service that, in spite of the tremendous strength of the North, would give you speedy success. But, doubtless, you recollect my mentioning the fact that there was, in Washington, an influence adverse to me, and more powerful than mine. That influence I hoped to destroy; but I have failed, and it is now seeking my overthrow,—my destruction! To it I must finally succumb,—how soon, how late, I cannot now foresee. Until I do, however, my best powers shall be used for your benefit. I may not pass the lines of the Union army myself, but I can open the way for others, and I can also venture, though it is a great risk, to follow and guide them, secondarily, with my influence."</p>
               <p>"I was thinking, a while ago," said Davis, in reply to these words, "that, under all circumstances, it would be best for you to confine your operations to the Union pickets. You run less risk, and, therefore, I am sure of your aid for a longer time. That which you have already accomplished is worth more than a large army to me; and, with you to break the picket lines of the enemy, I shall be able so to direct the armies we have as to defeat our Yankee foes. So I would prefer you to adopt this plan of procedure. It would, in time, so terrify the Union soldiers that they would become utterly demoralized, and would, therefore, render them useless as pickets.</p>
               <p>As the <emph>Mysterious Picket Slayer,</emph> Miss Murdock, you could help us to win two or three campaigns."</p>
               <p>"You speak correctly, President Davis," rejoined the girl demon; "and hereafter, so long as I am permitted by that Power which makes us all subservient to His will, I will confine my operations, as you suggest, to the picket lines of the Union army. It will mystify them terribly; and I love mystery! ha! ha! If I were vain of titles, that would please me wonderfully,—'<emph>The Mysterious Picket Slayer!</emph>'"</p>
               <p>"I will give you a letter to General Lee, Miss Murdock," said Davis, sitting down at a desk, and taking up a pen.</p>
               <p>"I do not really need one, President Davis," answered Mary; "but, to prevent delay, I will accept of one."</p>
               <p>The letter was not quite finished, when suddenly the fair companion of the rebel President started, and exclaimed:</p>
               <p>"Quick! quick! my enemy,—the adverse influence,—is close at hand! Quick, or I am lost! The letter!—give it to me!"</p>
               <p>A few hurried strokes of the pen, and Davis handed the letter to Mary Murdock, who, seizing it, vanished instantly, as though she had been a phantom or spirit.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER IX.</head>
               <head type="sub">THE MAGIC WAND.</head>
               <p>WHEN Mr. Wetherill halted, as we have previously recorded, at Matildaville, it was from motives of prudence that he did so.</p>
               <p>Here he remained a day and part of a night, and then, set out Southward toward Richmond. He did not proceed further, however, than Hunter's Mill, which is situated on Difficult Creek, a short distance Northwest of Vienna, on the Alexandria and London Railroad. Several hundred rods below the Mill, and on the West bank of the stream, there is a romantic little gulch or grotto. To this Wetherill bent his steps, as though he had been aware of its existence since childhood, and, making his way through the mass of tangled brushwood that almost filled it, he reached a small natural basin of stone, into which a clear, sparkling rill trickled from above, and from which, in turn, it fell over into a gravelly bed, and meandered gently away to the creek.</p>
               <pb n="88-89" xml:id="VAC5568-00000026"/>
               <p>The sun had not fully risen, and, until it did, Wetherill remained, musing silently, seated upon a large, moss-grown stone close to the spring. Now and then he cast a glance upward to the tree-tops, as though watching the gleams of daylight, that momentarily increased in brightness, until, at last, the highest boughs were bathed in the living gold of morning.</p>
               <p>At this juncture Wetherill rose to his feet, and drew from beneath his coat a wand of most peculiar wood, about fifteen inches in length, as thick in <choice>
                     <sic>diamater</sic>
                     <corr>diameter</corr>
                  </choice> as an ordinary walking cane, and curiously carved with strange figures and devices. This wand, after uttering something as though in a soliloquy, Wetherill cast into the natural stone basin.</p>
               <p>In an instant it began to circle round on the surface of the clear, limped water. Then it as quickly remained stationary for a single moment, and then, much in the manner of the compass-needle, it swung back and forth between Southeast and South. With a most intense expression of earnestness on his countenance. Wetherill bent down close over the stone basin, and eagerly watched each motion, no matter how slight, of the wand. Thus did he occupy himself for the space of several minutes, and then, suddenly snatching the wand from the water, he thrust it back in the place from which he had taken it, uttering, as he did so, some abrupt expressions, in the Persian language.</p>
               <p>Once more he paused as though in a deep reverie, and then, in the manner of a person who follows a guide, he left the dell, with a quick but half uncertain stride.</p>
               <p>We do not pretend to give any judgment on this action of Wetherill, yet we say but the simple truth in asserting, that, without halting, the mysterious and learned Englishman went directly to the farm-house of Mr. Tibbett.</p>
               <p>The action of England toward the United States, at the period of which we write, naturally led those whose affections were with the South to look with the most friendly feelings upon any one of British birth. Consequently Mr. Wetherill had only to announce his nationality to the Tibbetts to awaken their liveliest friendship. Of this he took full advantage, without committing himself to any untruth, and ascertained much that was valuable to him in his pursuit of Mary Murdock.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Tibbet was particularly enthusiastic in regard to the beautiful angel who had honored her house with her presence, and who had, with so much success, opened a way through the Union line for the two rebel spies to reach Washington.</p>
               <p>Mr. Wetherill inquired the exact date of this occurrence, and found it to tally exactly with the date, even to a minute, that he had held an interview with Mr. Lincoln and General McClellan. Further inquiry failed to elicit more from Mrs. Tibbett, than that Mary Murdock had accompanied the two spies to Richmond. To Richmond, therefore, Wetherill proceeded without delay, and yet with as much caution as possible. Long before he reached the Rebel capital, however, he became aware, though not through the agency of any human being, that the girl demon had departed from there, and gone to the Valley of the Shenandoah, for the purpose of performing the horrid, heartless role she had assumed in the drama of the Rebellion. Wetherill did not alter his direction, but continued on to Richmond, where he made good use of his own marvellous powers for the benefit of the Union cause.</p>
               <p>Through the interposition of the singular and terrible girl, Mary Murdock, the Rebel government had become thoroughly acquainted not only with the intended movement of the Army of the Potomac up the Peninsula, but also with the minutest details of its organization, and its strength, in artillery and transportation. The manner in which Generals Banks' and McDowel's columns were to operate, likewise reached them, and this was the true reason why the famous Stonewall Jackson was enabled to accomplish so much by his see-saw strategy of alternate advances and retreats.</p>
               <p>After obtaining all the information he thought necessary for the accomplishment of the object he had in view, Wetherill left Richmond, and set his face toward Stonewall Jackson's army, fully confident of capturing his fearful charge, Mary Murdock. It never transpired how he became aware of the fact, but upon reaching Piedmont, which lies in the gap of Battle-Snake Mountains, he found the girl demon close at hand. He therefore halted, and made such arrangements as he deemed ample to secure her. Had she been a mere ordinary female, the difficulty of her capture would have been, but slight; but possessed of the powers that have already been described, she became at once a fugitive hard to catch, and a foe terrible to encounter. Add to this, that it was impossible for, Wetherill to surprise her, and the reader may form some conception of the perilous task that the Englishman had undertaken.</p>
               <p>The first thing Wetherill did, upon his arrival, was to seek a clear spring in a spur of the mountain. This he was not long in finding, and into it he cast the curiously-carved wand we have previously referred to. After one or two quick oscillations on the crystal surface of the water, the wand suddenly became stationary.<pb n="90-91" xml:id="VAC5568-00000027"/> Then, just as quickly, the thicker end of it sank about two inches, leaving the point proportionally raised clear of the water.</p>
               <p>At this instant a deathly paleness spread itself over Wetherill's features, and simultaneously an arrow flashed past his cheek, and, striking the rocks back of the spring, splintered into a hundred fragments, some of which fell into the water about the wand, and others into the mysterious Englishman's face.</p>
               <p>With the quickness of lightning, Wetherill snatched the magic wand from the spring, and wheeling half round on his heel, extended it in the direction in which the shaft had come. As he did so, a wild, weird scream of disappointment and rage, broke shrilly upon the still air of the mountain, and a moment later, the light form of Mary Murdock bounded from a thicket a few rods distant.</p>
               <p>Down the rugged pathway, through the interlacing bushes, and over high stones and fallen trees, the girl demon flew, never once stumbling or slipping, and never once looking behind her at her guardian, who pursued her at the top of his speed. On, on they sped in silence, but terrible determination, until at last a little run of water that cascaded down the mountain side, appeared in view.</p>
               <p>As her eyes lit on the silvery, plashing brook, Mary Murdock for the first time turned her head, and cast a glance at Wetherill. The latter had gained upon the fair fugitive slightly, and was pressing forward with renewed energy, when the mountain stream, that had hitherto, been hidden from his eyes, came in sight. At this instant Mary Murdock was close on its bank, and pausing a moment, she uttered an exulting scream. The sound had scarcely reached Wetherill's ear, when the girl demon cleared the brook at a single bound, and as though she had sprung down a precipice on the opposite side, disappeared from view.</p>
               <p>Instantly Wetherill ceased his pursuit, and retraced his steps to where the race had commenced. From this point he wended his way, by another path, down the mountain, to where he had left his horse, a spirited and valuable animal. It was still on the spot in which he had left it, but it was dead, and already several keen-eyed vultures were circling above its carcass, in which not a single wound appeared.</p>
               <p>"Just as I thought," muttered Wetherill, turning away, and keeping on his road down toward the town. "But," continued he, "she must have gained new powers of which I know not! Strange if I should at last become her victim, However, my fault it was that she became inducted into a knowledge of these startling sciences, and my duty it is to society to bring her into my power again, or to perish in the effort."</p>

            <div type="chapter">
               <head>CHAPTER X.</head>
               <head type="sub">THE DEMON GIRL AGAIN AT WORK.</head>
               <p>AFTER escaping, as we have seen, from her guardian, on Battle Snake Mountain, Mary Murdock hastened with all speed to Richmond. Here she found that Jeff. Davis had gone to Lynchburg, but was expected hourly to return, as a dispatch had been sent to him by General Lee. She therefore awaited his coming. By this time, General McClellan had pushed the Army of the Potomac up the Peninsula, from Williamsburg to White House, which was now his base of supplies, and General Lee began to have considerable anxiety as to the safety of Richmond.</p>
               <p>The rebel President, on receiving Lee's dispatch, came forthwith to the Confederate Capital, leaving some important affairs unsettled at Lynchburg. Lee was waiting for him when he reached his headquarters, and immediately asked his approval of a plan he submitted for capturing or cutting to pieces McClellan's army.</p>
               <p>"The only difficulty which presents itself," said Lee to Davis, "is that there is peril of the Yankees becoming alarmed too soon. But even in that case, I can force McClellan to retreat or change base. If he retreats, I can cut him pretty well up before he reaches the works at Williamsburg; and if he attempts to reach the James River, which Napoleon himself would scarcely attempt in view of the danger of such a movement, I can capture or annihilate his whole host before he reaches the gunboats."</p>
               <p>"Would to Heaven that strange, terrible girl, Mary Murdock, were here!" exclaimed Davis. "She could give you all the advantage of a surprise. It was her who enabled Jackson to surprise Banks, and drive him back, you remember. She killed twenty-five or thirty men with her own hand, and without the slightest alarm."</p>
               <p>"Yes," replied Lee; "were she here at this moment, she would be of more service than an army corps."</p>
               <p>The words had scarcely left Lee's mouth, when the door of the<pb n="92-93" xml:id="VAC5568-00000028"/> apartment in which he sat with Davis was opened, and the demon girl herself stood before the arch-traitors.</p>
               <p>"Welcome, welcome, Miss Murdock!" exclaimed the rebel President, starting forward, and taking the hand of the fair intruder. "We were just wishing for you. You can render our cause a most valuable service."</p>
               <p>"Name it, then!" replied the demon girl, in a voice strangely altered from its usual tones; "for my power is fast failing me, and, in a short period, I must meet the fate prepared for me, and pass from earth to where I belong."</p>
               <p>"The service I would ask of you, Miss Murdock," said General Lee to the girl demon, "is to break the enemy's line at White House without creating an alarm, in order that I may push a column of troops through to his rear. The value of the whole movement will depend on <emph>twenty-four hours' secrecy!</emph>"</p>
               <p>"I am ready, General," said Mary Murdock, "to set out immediately. Now is the time; delay may bring me within the power of a superior foe."</p>
               <p>Within five minutes after this answer, Mary Murdock was on her way, in company with the redoubtable General Lee, to the camps of the rebel Army of Virginia.</p>
               <p>General McClellan had seen the weakness of his line at White House, but being unable to remedy the defect in any other manner, he had pushed out his pickets at this point further toward the enemy, and more than doubled their lines and reserves. Beyond the first line he also stationed Videttes mounted on fleet steeds. In this manner he sought to make up for his deficiency in strength, hoping, if the rebels made <choice>
                     <sic>a a</sic>
                     <corr>a</corr>
                  </choice> demonstration here, to be able, by rapidity of movement, to meet them with a force taken from another part of his line, sufficient to drive them back.</p>
               <p>After receiving certain instructions from General Lee, Mary Murdock set forth on her mission of blood, as cheerily as though she was going to a bridal. It was midnight of the twelfth of June that she bade the rebel General good-night, and told him he might push forward his reconnoitering column at daylight, without fear of a premature alarm.</p>
               <p>A short distance from Old Church, the terrible girl came upon the first of McClellan's mounted videttes. In a moment the fatal bow was drawn, an arrow fitted to its string; a twang, a whiz, and a groan, and another victim was added to the long list already arrayed against the "<emph>Mysterious Picket Slayer.</emph>"</p>
               <p>Scarcely had the Union soldier fallen from his saddle to the road when his murderess reached him, and, leaning over his corpse, plucked the arrow from his heart. Next, with the same rapidity of motion as had hitherto characterized her movements, she possessed herself of the vidette's cap and overcoat, in which attiring herself, she vaulted into the empty saddle, and turned the horse's head down the road. The spirited animal, all unconscious of the character of his new rider, bore her at full speed toward the next vidette.</p>
               <p>But let us forbear further details of the revolting ride of the Picket Slayer. Suffice it to say that she accomplished the object of her bloody errand most successfully, and had, by the appointed hour, pierced the last line that stretched between Lee and the Army of the Potomac.</p>
               <p>This done, she wheeled her steed and galloped back toward Richmond. Such confidence had Lee in her success, that he had dispatched his column of fifteen hundred picked cavalry and six pieces of artillery, under General Stuart, immediately after her. This column she met on her return, just as the bright sun began to rise. A body of the Fifth Union Cavalry, stationed at Old Church, she had ridden around, both going and returning; and, on meeting General Stuart, she gave him such information as would enable him either to capture or flank them, and thus avoid a skirmish. A spirit of bravado led the rebel to attempt the former expedient; but instead of capturing the brave detachment, he only succeeded in driving them before him. In spite of this, however, he succeeded in obtaining all the information General Lee desired to have for his projected movement against the Union Army, and returned in safety, by a <choice>
                     <sic>circuituous</sic>
                     <corr>circuitous</corr>
                  </choice> route, to camp. Here he found Mary Murdock at General Lee's headquarters, waiting another opportunity to serve the wicked cause she had espoused.</p>
               <p>It is, no doubt, still fresh in the memory of the reader, what an excitement was caused by this bold raid of the rebel cavalry, in the army as well as out of it.</p>
               <p>The Union lines were immediately re-established, however, and the murdered pickets buried. In regard to one of these unfortunate heroes, an incident occurred which we cannot forbear recording in this connection.</p>
               <p>Though the shaft that had deprived him of life had passed through his heart, yet he had not died immediately, for in his hand was grasped an ambrotype of an old lady, most likely his mother, in the case of which were found the following beautiful lines. In her earnest love, the mother, not knowing what words to write to her son, had come across the newspaper containing the poem, and, feeling<pb n="94-95" xml:id="VAC5568-00000029"/> ing that the stanzas expressed her own fair thoughts, she had clipped it out and sent it to him. What made the incident more touching than it would otherwise have been, was, that both the ambrotype and slip of newspaper were stained with the gallant soldier's life blood:</p>

               <head type="sub">THE CRYSTAL CASKET.</head>
               <p>ON the night of the day on which General Stuart pushed his way round to White House and Tunstall's Station, a single rider galloped over the same road, in the direction of McClellan's camp. Straight through the re-established Union lines he rode, but, strange to say, he was unchallenged, and his grey steed flew onward like the wind. This horseman was Wetherill, the mysterious guardian of the still<pb n="96-97" xml:id="VAC5568-00000030"/> more mysterious Picket Slayer, Mary Murdock. His animal seemed to have borne him many a weary mile, for the foam, tinged with blood, dropped in flakes from his bridle-bit, and his skin was covered with a complete lather. Yet forward he sprang, at the urging of his master, until he brought the latter to McClellan's tent. Here, however, his journey was ended, and, sinking to the turf, he expired.</p>
               <p>A moment later, and Wetherill stood in the presence of the Union commander, who noticed that his whole appearance had undergone a singular change since he had last seen him. His face, thin, cadaverous, and pale, was rendered still more ghastly by his eyes, that gleamed from their hollow sockets with terrible brightness.</p>
               <p>"General," said he, after some little conversation with McClellan, who chanced to be alone at the time, "I once told you I should need your help to secure this terrible girl. Since then I have been continually in pursuit of her, but, until now, have been baffled. With your aid, I can retake her at sunrise to-morrow morning."</p>
               <p>"Whatever I can do, I will do it willingly," replied the General; "for I am well assured that, without her assistance, our lines could never have been pierced, as they were by the rebel cavalry, without a timely alarm being given."</p>
               <p>"Then, General," said Wetherill, drawing forth a richly moulded crystal box, of small size, "at three o'clock exactly, open this little chest. In it you will find a peculiar candle which will light itself upon the opening of the lid. If the candle should burn beyond sun-rise, extinguish it instantly by closing the lid of the chest; but on no account permit it to become extinguished before day dawn. I may return and I may not; if I should, I will explain to you the true science of what seems no doubt to you a silly rite,—a mummery of magic. But of one thing rest assured, that whether I return or not, you will no more be troubled with this demon girl.</p>
               <p>"Another thing ere I go; General Lee has already sent for Stonewall Jackson, and with seventy-five thousand men is going to attack White House immediately with the intention of capturing your supplies. He then expects you to retreat on Williamsburg, and has made such dispositions as will insure your destruction. His army greatly outnumbers yours. To insure to you the least hope of escape, there is but one course open to you, and that he thinks you will not attempt—namely, a rapid march to the James River."</p>
               <p>"That is exactly what I have already commenced, Mr. Wetherill," replied McClellan, "and, with sufficient reinforcements, I will turn this apparent disaster, which I know cannot be prevented, into a grand and overwhelming victory."</p>
               <p>"Then you have taken the only route to safety," answered, Wetherill; "but," continued he, "I must be gone, the time gets short. Will you, General, faithfully follow out my instructions in regard to this casket and its contents?"</p>
               <p>"Certainly, Mr. Wetherill," rejoined McClellan, "I have made all my arrangements for the night, and though confessing to but little faith in these magical arts, I will, because you request it, follow your instructions rigidly."</p>
               <p>"All is well with you, then, General. I may return or I may not; if I do, I will show you that what you and Mr. Lincoln regarded so lightly, is really one of the most sublime sciences that mortal man has ever discovered. If I do not return, you may know that I am no longer of earth. Farewell."</p>
               <p>McClellan could not repress the feeling of mysterious awe that possessed him as he shook Wetherill's extended hand, and when the latter left the tent, he said to himself:</p>
               <p>"What a strange, incomprehensible man!"</p>
               <p>The intervening time to three o'clock was passed by McClellan in attention to some matters that the pressure of his other duties had not allowed him until now to arrange. True to his word, however, he did not neglect the promise he had made to Wetherill, but, exactly at three o'clock, opened the lid of the crystal casket. As Wetherill had said, a small candle within it was instantly ignited, and burned with a steady white light. Curiosity led McClellan to look into the casket; but it had no contents whatever, saving the diminutive candle, and this seemed to consume with more than ordinary rapidity. Its flame sank gradually down within the crystal sides that surrounded it, and through which its light came with an ever-increasing dimness, until at last it was barely perceptible.</p>
               <p>Day at last dawned, and the commander of the Army of the Potomac, to completely fulfill his promise to the mysterious Wetherill, approached the casket for the purpose of extinguishing the light it contained. But the latter was so nearly out that he involuntarily awaited its self-extinguishment. He was not detained long thus, for, even as he gazed down upon the little flame, it vanished wholly and without a flicker.</p>
               <p>"At this moment," said he, to the person to whom he afterward narrated the singular affair, "the thought flashed across my mind, that Wetherill and the startling girl of whom he was in pursuit, had, at that moment, ceased to live! I know not why it so occurred to me, but I could not rid myself of it. And even now, at this comparatively distant day, I never look upon the crystal casket that<pb n="98-99" xml:id="VAC5568-00000031"/> Wetherill thus left in my possession, but the remembrance comes to me as vividly as ever."</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XII.</head>
               <head type="sub">A TRAGIC END.</head>
               <p>ONCE more we return to the mysterious Wetherill. After bidding General McClellan farewell, he hastened away in the direction of the camp of the rebel General Lee. When within four miles of the latter, he stopped where four roads intersected, and seemed for a while to be at a loss which to take. This he presently decided, and again moved forward, not, however, at the same rapid pace as before; but like a man fearful of encountering some peril. Several times within the next mile he halted, and gazed intently up at the stars overhead. Immediately after doing so the last time, Wetherill turned from the main road into a by-path that wound now through wheat and cornfields, and now through dense woodlands with as much irregularity as a meandering stream. As he advanced his speed decreased, until at last it was not faster than a slow walk; and just as day was about breaking, he reached what seemed to be the destination of his journey. This was a huge rock far up on the left bank of the Chickahominy river.</p>
               <p>Here he produced from beneath his coat a crystal casket, which was an exact counterpart of the one he had left with General McClellan. Casting a momentary glance up at the sky, along which the greyish light of day was just creeping, he opened the lid of the casket, and with precisely the same result as we have seen in regard to the other, namely, the igniting of a diminutive candle. One difference, however, was instantly apparent—while the taper in McClellan's casket burned with a steady consumption, that in Wetherill's burned fitfully and with astonishing rapidity,—so much so, in fact, that day had not fully broken ere it was almost out.</p>
               <p>From the moment of opening the casket, Wetherill had bent down over it with such an intent and eager steadiness that the flame of the candle seemed to scorch his face. All this while, also, he continued to utter broken sentences in the Persian and ancient Chaldee tongues. His voice and manner became more and more earnest as the flame of the candle got lower and lower. The sun was now just below the horizon, and all nature seemed awaking to greet his cheerful rays, when suddenly an arrow, shot with terrible force, fairly struck the casket, shivering it to atoms, and instantly extinguishing the little taper. A groan burst from the lips of Wetherill at this instant, and he snatched from his bosom the singularly carved wand we have seen him use once before. This he extended in the direction of the fight of the arrow, but, while in the very act, a second shaft, shot more vengefully than the first, struck him upon the right cheek, not fully, but so close as to cut the flesh slightly from about the middle of the cheek back to the ear.</p>
               <p>A deadly shiver ran through the frame of the wounded man as he felt the warm blood spurt from the gash, and, with compressed lips, he muttered:</p>
               <p>"Three shafts! so ends her power! so ends my life! His will be done!"</p>
               <p>At this moment, Mary Murdock—for she it was who had shot the two arrows, leaped from the thicket in which she had been concealed, and sought to fly, but in an instant, Wetherill sprang after her, never lowering the wand which he held toward her. Quickly the girl demon seemed to lose her strength, and ere she had fled a quarter of a mile she sank to the earth, clutching at the flowers and grass as she fell, whilst a demoniac agony writhed and worked her beautiful features into the most fearful contortions. No sound escaped her, neither did she make any motion after sinking to the ground, save an occasional effort to raise her head, that fell forward and rested heavily on her bosom. Her end was approaching, as she had years before predicted. By the hand of her guardian, she was to die. Not that the latter shed her blood, for his only act upon reaching her was to touch her with the singular wand he carried. And even this seemed to be as mortal to himself as to her, for, on touching her, he staggered back several paces, whilst a more deadly pallor spread itself upon his features than before, and his eyes became dim and glassy. Yet, with all his determination, he continued to hold the wand toward Mary Murdock.</p>
               <p>What a weird, terribly solemn picture was there presented. No passing zephyr stirred the leaves, no birds caroled in the branches, and even the insects were silent as the two strange beings were dying, each destroyed by an art unknown to their fellow beings. Whether the wound inflicted by the demon girl's arrow, or the mysterious influence of the contact of the wand held by Wetherill, caused the fatal effect upon the latter, it is impossible to decide.<pb n="100" xml:id="VAC5568-00000032"/> Either conclusion would be plausible; but the same mystery <unclear>enshrouds</unclear> that as the two strange actors themselves. Whether Lord Palmerston knew who and what Mary Murdock was, all inquiries have failed to settle; but that she was the illegitimate offspring of <unclear>one</unclear> of the most renowned peers of England is placed beyond a doubt.</p>
               <p>Wetherill himself was without kith or kin, and his lineage is buried in oblivion. From the few facts that have come to light concerning him, however, he appears to have been a man fond of abstruse study and travel in his youth, and, consequently, just such a person as would delight in those investigations which afterwards proved so potent to him and his ward.</p>
               <p>After it was decided to withdraw the Army of the Potomac from the Peninsula, General McClellan sent flanking columns of cavalry as far as possible into the enemy's lines. One of these, scouting in the neighborhood in which the tragedy we have narrated occurred, came upon the bodies of the mysterious Wetherill and his still more mysterious charge, Mary Murdock. Both corpses had long since obeyed the mandate of Nature, "dust to dust," saving the bony frames, and these, apparently unmolested by bird or beast, still retained their relative positions. A strange awe seized the rough troopers at the startling spectacle, and, without disturbing either skeleton, they returned to camp to relate, with many an exaggeration, what they had beheld. Upon learning accidentally of the discovery, McClellan sent for the officer who had charge of the column, and questioned him closely concerning it. But the latter had noticed neither a broken bow nor a wand; nothing but the two crumbling skeletons.</p>
               <p>So mysteriously perished two of the most mysterious beings that have had any connection with the American Rebellion.</p>
