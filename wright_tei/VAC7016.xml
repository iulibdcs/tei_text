JULIETTE A. KINZIE. June, 1869.  &#xD;<pb n="-9" xml:id="VAC7016-00000004"/>   WALTER OGILBY. CHAPTER I. ON a close, sultry afternoon in the month of May, 182-, a strange, old-fashioned equipage was making its way down the western slope of that range of hills which separates Connecticut from her sister State, New York. Although, according to the calendar, the summer had vnot yet, commenced, the air was, as we have hinted, hot and oppressive; and the steed, scarcely less antiquated in appearance than the creaking, rattling chaise (the country- people called it shay) to which it was attached by a well- patched harness, seemed fagged and jaded with an unusual day's toil.               .  The gentle voice of the driver was occasionally heard in encouraging tones. "Come, Garry 1 Come now-poor creature I It is long since you have seen a spring, but we shall soon reach one now, no doubt." It was not easy to mistake the profession of the spokes- man. Not that the white cravat would have denoted it: that was, at that day, a part of the ordinary costume of a Hgentleman. But the black coat had not yet been usurped by the young man of fashion as a fitting accompaniment to the grave and listless demeanor which has, too gen- erally, succeeded the frank and light-hearted cheerfulness of former days. /  &#xD;<pb n="10-11" xml:id="VAC7016-00000005"/> 10        WALTER OGILB I The countenance of the clergyman (for such he evidently - was) indicated that he had passed the meridian of life, and ! there was in it an expression that told of sorrow only par-  tially subdued by time and contemplation. It was in strik- ing contrast with that of the bright and joyous being who sat beside him; yet the likeness was sufficiently strong to designate them at once as father and daughter. There was no sadness in the radiant face of the latter, as it looked forth from beneath a little brown muslin trav- elling-bonnet, the rose-colored lining of which imparted an additional bloom to a complexion already heightened by the heat of the day, as well as by the exercise of toiling on foot up all the steep ascents of the road, in compassion to Mrs. Garry's age and leisurely habits. The dress of the young lady was-in the fashion of the pe- riod. A close-fitting habit of gray pongee, ornamented with bands of black velvet, a collar of white cambric, the ruffle of which was laid in almost invisible plaits, thick gloves of Woodstock leather, and boots (it had not yet become the fashion to call them gaiters) of black morocco, com- pleted her costume. The road, as it descended, was not only winding and stony, but, to add to its difficulties, it was traversed here and there by ruts formed by the heavy rains of spring. There were apparently too few inhabitants in its vicinity to work out their road-tax to any effectual purpose. A- careful attention was therefore necessary in guiding the steps of the old roan animal, notwithstanding that this dilatory style of progress gave the travellers uncomfortable doubts as to the possibility of reaching their place of des- tination before nightfall. By many a devious turn between high banks overhung with arbor-vitre and cedar, or fringed with the laurel, dog- wood, and sassafras, now bursting into bloom, they held   WALTER OGILBY.         " on their way, until a sudden opening brought them in full view of a glorious landscape spread at their feet. ! "There, Ally!-there is Dutchess county! There are  the Highlands that you have so longed to see I That/tle- vation farthest to the right is the North Beacon; and stretching along to the left are the South Beacon, Solo- mon's Barrack, and others whose names 1 have forgotten, though I once knew them all. Nearer the river are But- ler Hill, and Anthony's Nose, and Break Neck, as I well recollect; but we cannot see their outline distinctly from here. Neither, indeed, are the summits of the nearer hills quite clearly defined; for the mist which rests upon them, and which, if I am not mistaken, is considered a little omi- nous, is beginning to shroud them from view. Now tell -me--is there anything in our Connecticut scenery to equal this?" His daughter did not immediately reply. She was lost in admiration of the scene before her,--the broad, fertile lands of Dutchess, its brilliant green meadows inter- spersed with patches of young /orn or fresh-ploughed fields, its fair homesteads, its herds of grazing cattle, its villages dotting the farther portion of the plain, and the magnificent sweep of mountains bounding its utmost verge. "If anything can surpass Connecticut," was at length her qualified reply, "it is surely such a scene as this!"' And she instinctively laid her hand upon the rein to check all farther progress, while she gave herself up for a few moments to the utter enjoyment of its contemplation. But Mrs. Garry had no taste for the picturesque. She could not forget, though her young mistress might, that she had travelled since morning the unwonted distance of twenty miles, and that it was long, very long on this hot afternoon since she had slaked her thirst. Like most of her sex, she could show herself wilful when matters be-  &#xD;<pb n="12-13" xml:id="VAC7016-00000006"/> 12        WALTER OGILBY. came too aggravated for nature to bear; and, in the present instance, the more she was urged to stand still, the more was she resolved not to do so, until, taking with a sudden jerk the matter fairly into her own hands, she set off at full speed down the hill, regardless alike of stones, ruts, or the united efforts at restraint of both father and daughter. "Whoa, Garry I stop! stop I I am ashamed of you!" cried her master. But Garry had no shame for herself. On she went, thumping and crashing, wheels rattling, springs creaking, blinders flying; for her instinct taught her that at the foot of the hill she would find a pure, cool spring of water, where she might refresh herself after the fatigues: i of her journey. "It is unworthy of Garry's age and experience to plunge so recklessly into the midst of things," said the clergyman, as the wilful animal, turning suddenly short, rushed, de- spite all his efforts, into a bed of deep, boggy soil, which surrounded the object of her longing anticipations. The spring which here -welled out from the bank had originally been received into a hollow log, fashioned by the country-pe6ple into a drinking-trough for the numerous cattle which ranged a considerable extent of unenclosed pasture-ground along the foot of the chain of hills. Time and service had, however, gradually worn away the sides of the reservoir, and the water, abundant at this season, by continually pouring orth, had converted the low land by which it was surrounded into almost a quagmire. "Garry has made a great mistake," observed the young lady. "Having reached the mature age of seventeen years, she ought to have known that she could not take off the check-rein herself; and she surely cannot expect us to get out in this deep mud to unfasten it for her." Something, however, must be done; for, with her head  thus braced back, Garry was in the position of Tantalus.  1 ' ..f[, Eli-   WAL TER O GILBY.       - 13 A rheumatic affection with which the gentleman was somewhat disabled forbade his climbing forward upon the thills in order to loosen the rein from the terret, and his repeated efforts to disengage it with the end of his whip proved totally unsuccessful. "Come, Garry; in spite of yourself you must back to dry land," cried he. And with a vigorous effort, in which he was joined by his daughter, he succeeded in pulling the animal a short distance in a retrograde direction. "Now, papa, hold her fast-I think I can manage to get at her head." And the young lady, with a light bound, cached a spot where she found a tolerable footing. "My dear child," cried her father, "you surely are not going to step into that mud and water? It is over shoes, -over your boots, even." "Oh, I have no intention of putting myself into jeop- ardy," replied she, with a merry laugh. "I have an ex- pedient." And, taking off her gloves, she threw them on the grass at a little distance, then, drawing up the skirt of her new pongee travelling-dress and pinning it around her, out of the reach of a splashing from the refractory animal, she selected a large stone from among the many that lav scat- tered around, and commenced making a pathway to a point whence she could reach the check-rein and release the head of the unfortunate Mrs. Garry. Her task was nearly accomplished, amid alternate scold- ing, laughing, and reiterating to her father that much les harm would happen to her than to him and his rheu- matism should he insist on changing places with her, when the sound of a horse's hoofs rapidly descending the same path by which they had come, gave promise of more efficient help. "Some traveller who, like ourselves, has a thirsty-horse; I hope not so headstrong a one," was the thought of the  &#xD;<pb n="14-15" xml:id="VAC7016-00000007"/> "       .WALTER OGILBY. young lady, as she dropped the stone she was carrying, and hastened, not at first quite successfully, to let down -her, dress into a more becoming fashion. Her quick eye detected at a glance that the -rider of the fine animal ap- proaching was a gentleman,-so much was unmistakable; that he was on a journey, for he carried a small valise buckled to his saddle; and, ere he had joined the party, which was after an interval of less than a minute from his first appearance, she felt convinced that he was neither old nor ugly. He was off his saddle, and had thrown his bridle over a projecting branch near him, before she imagined that he could have comprehended their dilemma; then, advancing with a courteous bow and the short phrase, "Allow me, madam," he proceeded to accomplish what his length of limb made an easy task, and soon placed Mrs. Garry's head in a position to refresh herself at the gushing stream. The embarrassment of the young lady was, perhaps, even more than the occasion warranted. Like most young and sensitive persons, she exaggerated in her own mind the absurdity not only of her own appearance, but that of . her whole party. She turned away to hide her blushes, and to repair, as well as she might, the disorder of her attire; while her father, who had observed nothing to disturb his equanimity, was profuse in acknowledgments and explanations of the circumstances whik;.had brought them into their present difficulty. The stranger stood waiting until old Garry had been safely guided again into the high-road. Once he had stepped forward, ap- parently with an intention of gathering up the gloves and handkerchief which had been thrown upon the grass; but the young lady had been beforehand with him, and, with a slight bow. had again turned away, as if to de- feat any intention he might have of addressing her. Hle ?  r  Kr   X, : '  WALTER OGILB       -  153 seemed at a loss to interpret her look of annoyance, but he accepted it as a hint to make no further advances, and con- tented himself with watching in silence the further move- nments of her father. The young girl hazarded a glance at him, when she felt quite sure of not being observed. "He is pretending to be quite unconscious,.-not to have taken in a full sense of our ridiculous position," said she to herself. "But I am not to be so deceived. He -looks very grave, 'tis true; but if he were not restrained by polite- ness I am convinced he would laugh outright." The elder gentleman was now turned, with his vehicle, in full view of the western sky. As he threw a glance toward it, he addressed an anxious inquiry to the younger. "Do you not think, sir, we have the prospect of a shower?" The sky was, indeed, becoming rapidly overcast, and the appearance of the clouds was growing more and more portentous. "There seems great danger of it," was the reply. "We seldom see those large, round masses of cloud, which have been for some time piling up in the west,-thunder-heads, as the good people about here call them,-but that a shower, or even perhaps a storm, succeeds them." "And is it probable that we can reach the village before it overtakes us?" The young gentleman gave a glance at Garry, and there was a slight twitching at the corners of his handsome mouth, which did not escape the young lady, as he answered, "! think it doubtful, unless you could travel as much as eight miles an hour. There is every indication that the rain is not very far distant." The low growl of the thunder, which at this moment  &#xD;<pb n="16-17" xml:id="VAC7016-00000008"/> 1 G       WALTER OGILB I. made itself heard, rolling around the distant mountain- tops, gave confirmation to the prediction. The stranger had assisted the young lady to mount the step of the chaise, and to bestow herself, as best she might, among the boxes and baskets with which travellers, from time immemorial, have taken pleasure in encumbering themselves; while her father thus continued,:- "I would gladly have gone a few miles beyond the village, to the house of a relative; but, having been de- layed in the manner you have observed, I must, I sup- pose, give up the hope of that. My only anxiety now is to reach a place of shelter for the night. I have travelled this road many years since, and, if I recollect right, taverns are not as frequent here as on the other' side of the boundary- line. You seem familiar with this part of the country: can you tell me if I shall be likely to find a good stopping- place at the end of five or six miles?" "I can direct you to the house of a very excellent couple-old acquaintances of mine-a few miles farther on," said the young gentleman. "Though they no longer pro- fess to keep a house of entertainment, yet they will, I am sure" (glancing at the young lady), " be quite happy to fall into their old habits on your behalf, and do all in their power to make you comfortable. You will not, perhaps, recognize the house, at first, for a tavern, unless you ob- serve that the sign-posts are still standing, and the pump I and horse-block are yet in the open space before the door. There is also a blacksmith's shop across the road, which will help you to identify the place. If you will inquire at this house for Mrs. Van Tine, and ask her hospitality, 'l. 'you will be certain to receive the best that she has to ' .i"offer." e Many acknowledgments from the father followed, while the young gentleman was aiding him in his last arrange-   Xi:l         WALTER OQGIL B        1    1Y ments, and giving a careful glance to the different parts of the harness, to ascertain that they were likely to hold together for the remaining miles of the journey. This done, he ventured a few words of parting compliment to the daughter,--then, mounting his horse without further delay, was soon cantering out of sight. "A fine, gentlemanly young man,-very obliging and well-bred, though not very talkative. His coming just at that moment was quite providential. Don't you think so, Ally?' was her father's first comment. "Providential as a discipline, papa, to rebuke any pride we may have had in the powers of old Garry, or in our own ingenuity in getting ourselves out of scrapes." "Why, my dear child, what is the matter? What has vexed you? You surely cannot but consider the arrival of this young man most opportune?" "Indeed, I think it could not have happened at a worse moment. Dear papal think of the figure I cutl The vexatious pin in my skirt, which would crook itself up and stick fast, so that I could not let down my dress to look even decent 1" "When I was young, my daughter, the ladies pinned up their dresses, ordinarily, very much in that style while walking the streets," said her father, consolingly. "They called the fashion a trollopee." "And a very appropriate name. I dare say the young gentleman called it the same, the moment he caught a full view of me, with my splashed petticoat, my hat half-way down my shoulders, and my hair streaming about my face. Oh, if Garry could only be made to feel half the mortifica- tion she has caused me!" "It is not like my Ally to be so disturbed by a trifle," said her father. "It will be no trifle to the young gentleman, depend  &#xD;<pb n="18-19" xml:id="VAC7016-00000009"/> 18        WALTER OQIL B Y. upon it, papa. Even now I fancy I hear the description he will be giving of us when he arrives at home. It will be one of the choicest pictures he can furnish for the even- ing's entertainment. He will not forget a single feature, and, if he happens to have any young sisters, we may be sure lie will not fail to recommend to them this last new style of proceeding in case of emergency-----" "Charging them not to expose themselves to mud and water, out of tender consideration to their poor rheumatic old father, like a certain quixotic young lady of our ac- quaintance," said her father, as he looked lovingly upon her. The cloud cleared away from the fair brow of the young girl. "Ah, papa," said she, "now you make me ashamed of myself. I must be cross no longer. I must forgive the young gentleman for coming to our rescue. I must even try to overlook his recommending us so kindly to a place of shelter; and, if I can only compel myself to feel a little proud of Garry and her performances---" "Poor Garry!" said the good clergyman, compassionately. "She is not a splendid animal, I will allow; but we must not be ashamed of her. Indeed, my dear," pursued he, in a moralizing tone, "we must guard against any dis- satisfaction with the gifts of Providence. We must strive, upon every occasion of discontent, to recall the words of Abraham to Dives:--' Son, remember that thou in thy life- time receivedst thy good things, and likewise Lazarus evil things; but now he is comforted, and thou art tor- mented.' " "I should be sorry, papa, to put too literal a construc- tion upon that text," said his daughter, archly. "It would augur but little for the future prospects of that excellent young gentleman to whom we are bound to be so much obliged. Think what a magnificent animal he is riding at this moment!"    "I should be loth to believe--" began the good man; but his observation, whatever it was to be, was cut short by a startling peal of thunder, almost immediately accom- panying a flash of lightning. Spite of a moderate use of the whip, and an occasional poke with the umbrella, which were all the discipline that the tender heart of the clergy- man permitted him to use upon Mrs. Garry, her speed was far less than would evidently now be requisite to bring the travellers safe and dry to the house which the young gentleman had recommended to them. Without venturing to stop a moment in their drive, the father con- trived to unbutton the boot or apron of the vehicle and draw it up before them, and also to disengage from some receptacle his blue cloak  and an angola shawl, with which to shelter himself and his daughter from the storm which the peals of thunder, nearer and nearer, more and more frequent, sufficiently indicated to be advancing upon them. All around them was sombre as twilight, save when a flash from the clouds above lighted up the landscape with a sudden glare.  Ally, though firm and energetic enough upon most occasions, was constitutionally afraid of light- ning, for which reason her father, while using his utmost efforts to excite Garry to greater speed, was assiduous in cheering and encouraging her. "Here come the rain-drops at last I There is very little danger from lightning, we are told, after the cloud breaks and the atmosphere below is filled with water." This is not a meteorological fact; but Ally believed it, and it answered as well. "Now, my daughter, hold the umbrella a little side- ways, so that I  can keep a lookout for the sign-posts. Ah! that must be the house,-not a quarter of a mile off, I am sure.  And the thunder is already rolling away more  &#xD;<pb n="20-21" xml:id="VAC7016-00000010"/> 20        WALTER OGILBY. to the north. But how it pours! Are you much wet, my child?" "Not' at all-not at all, papa. Take care of yourself: never mind me!"And she gave an additional pull of his cloak around his shoulders. "Garry does not like the rain, and is doing her very best," added she, laughing. "What unheard-of efforts she is making! By the best computation, we are going as much as four miles an hour!" And, by dint of this accelerated pace, they were soon turning in, past the sign-post, the pump, and the horse- block, toward the door of the spacious farm-house to which they had been recommended. i CHAPTER II. NEITHER the quickness of their pace as they drove up, nor the interposition of the umbrella, had prevented the young lady from descrying under the long open shed, not far dis- tant from the road, the noble bay horse which had borne their new acquaintance from them so rapidly, and which, contrasting his speed with that of Mrs. Garry, should by this time have been miles and miles away. She was therefore less surprised than her father that, almost before they reached the steps, there was a rush out of the door with umbrellas to shelter, and active busy hands to release them from their well-packed position and assist them into the house. "Ah, my dear young sir, is it again your fate to come   4 ^      WALTER OGILBY          21 to our rescue in the hour of need? Tbis is indeed an un- expected pleasure," cried the clergyman, as he observed who it was that was aiding the good woman of the house to throw aside the wet shawls and other wrappings with which he and his daughter were encumbered. "We did not expect to find you here. We were rather under the im- pression that you were in haste to pursue your journey; and I must confess that I have been reproaching myself as the means of delaying you, perhaps to your inconvenience." "The time I stopped at the spring caused me no incon- venient delay, I assure you," said'the young man, politely. "If I appeared in too great haste,"-with a glance at the young lady,-" it must have been from anxiety not to dis- appoint my mother, to whom I had written that I should be at home to-night. It was only when I found that my horse had a shoe loose, that I determined to stop and get my good friend Mr. Van Tine to attend to it for me." While this explanation was given, Alice had laid aside her bonnet, from which Mrs. Van Tine hastened to wipe the moisture with a clean pocket-handkerchief. Her first care was to ascertain whether any rain had penetrated her father's cl sand would be likely to increase his rheuma- tism. Warm aYe day had previously been, it had now become somewhat ailly from the dampness. There was no fire in the fireplace, but branches of snow-balls and lilac-blossoms instead. Mrs. Van Tine observed the wistful glance of her young guest toward an open door; from which a current of warm air seemed to proceed, and, in reply to it, she said,- "We have got through cleaning house and painting the hearth and jambs (they were of the brightest red-lead color), so I don't like to muss them up. But I've had a fire made up in the inner kitchen; and, if you like to step out there and take a seat, you'll soon get warm and dry."  &#xD;<pb n="22-23" xml:id="VAC7016-00000011"/> 22        WALTER OGILB.  The invitation was accepted. Either to guard himself from the possible ill effects of the rain-drops which might have reached him in helping the travellers from the chaise, or because he was reluctant to lose the company of his friend Mrs. Van Tine, the young gentleman appropriated his share -of the civility, and with the others followed the hospitable matron. The inner kitchen, as Mrs. Van Tine had denominated it, was, in fact, the family work-room. Neatness and order prevailed in all its arrangements, in the most admirable degree. On either side of the ample hearth stood a small spinning-wheel, dark with age, and garnished with that orthodox water-cup, the lower half, namely, of a yellow, -warty summer squash. More remote from the chimney was a large wheel for spinning tow or wool; and the fair, plump rolls, a few of which hung over the bench, while a goodly quantity lay in a neat basket by its side, would have gladdened the heart of the most notable Yankee housewife. The walls were curtained with hanks of linen, tow, or woollen yarn, waiting either for the proper comple- ment for each respective piece before it should be sent to the loom, or for the good pleasure of the mistress to double and twist it into thread. "Sit in," said Mrs. Van Tine, as she placed chairs for the company almost under the brow of the vast chimney,- "sit in, and dry yourselves. The rain will be over and the warm weather come round again to-rights.*   It's only a shower we are going to have. Miss Freelove, don't move: we won't disturb you." This last was addressed to a spare figure, with a thin, freckled face and projecting teeth, who sat on the farther side of the fireplace, with an open book on her lap. Two Probably from the German bereits, presently.  X      WALTER OGILBY.          23 bright-looking children, a boy and a girl, were standing before her. The three took a scrutinizing look at the strangers, as they were being seated Band made comfort- able; but immediately t}fe schoolmistress, for such Miss Freelove was, remembering the business which had been so suddenly interrupted, and fully alive to the duty of showing off upon an occasion of such rare importance, cried, in an energetic tone,- "Come, now, Jacob; come, Eliza Jane. Don't stare so. Set your toes close to that crack in the hearth. Stand up straight. ' Mum, mum for a plum, for a pear: The one that speaks a loud word Shall have a rousin' box'n car!" She accompanied the recitation of this stanza with a magisterial motion of her right hand, occasionally falling suggestively upon her. left, and brought up the finale with a clap, that caused her hearers to give an involuntary start. So much amused was the young lady by the whole per- formance, that she was not sorry when, in answer to Mrs. Van Tine's suggestion, "I think, Miss Freelove, we might better let the children take their seats awhile, till the com- pany and Mr. Walter are ready to go back into the room," that functionary replied, with dignity, "My maxim is, what you do, do it with regularity. Don't let the course of study be interrupted." And she glanced around for appro- bation. Then, resuming the spelling-book, which she had for a moment laid aside, she commenced,- "Begin at the head. Va-ri-e-ty. Variety" (in a lower tone of explanation) " means a great many different things." The word was correctly spelled by Eliza Jane. "Right," said Miss Freelove. "So-bri-e-ty. (Sobriety  &#xD;<pb n="24-25" xml:id="VAC7016-00000012"/> 24        WALTER OGILBY. means keeping sober, keeping out of liquor.) Sa-ti-e-ty."  There followed no definition of the last word, the teacher hurrying on to the next. "Pro-pri-e-ty."      . But Jacob, who had behaved with exemplary circum-  J spection thus far, now felt that he had a good right to  show off as well as his betters. He therefore proceeded to  set the teacher right, by crying,-  . "Miss Freelove, you've skipped a word. You have not  told us what sa-ti-e-ty means."  "Shut up, sir, and remember the rule, Them that speaks a loud word  Shall have a rousin' box'n ear.'  Pro-pri-e-ty is the word: that means behavin' as you'd ought to. Now, mind you do it!" with an emphasis of look ?. X and gesture that could not be misunderstood.    ;:i Jacob "shut up," as he was ordered; but there was a  twinkle in his roguish eye, and a slightly perceptible jerk of his head in the direction of his left shoulder, that announced his intention of being even with Miss Freelove at no distant day. Ally had heard her grandmamma describe her youthful training in the Puritan schools of the olden time, when the word "evil," for instance, was spelled after this fashion,-e by 't'self;-e, peaked u, i, l,-vil: Evil. But she found Miss Freelove's style not a whit behindhand i in quaintness and absurdity. It was with a feeling of regret that she saw the class -broken qp, or, as the teacher would choicely have ex- pressed it, "the course of study interrupted," by the en- trance of the master of the house. His broad, good-hu-  mored face lighted up with a cordial smile, as he recognized the young gentleman. "Oho, Mr. Walter!" cried he: "so it's you, to be sure!    WALTER OGILBY.         25 Glad to see you; glad to see you. Mr. Ogilby, I suppose, I ought to call you; though it's hard to learn old dogs new tricks. I believe, by Jocks, I came pretty near calling you Wattie, just as I used to, long ago." And he laughed heartily. "Call me Wattie, as much as you please," said the young man, with an affectionate smile. "It will always have a pleasant sound to my ear." "No, no; that will never do. You are a man grown now,-pretty well grown, too," with another laugh, as he measured the young gentleman's height with an upward glance. "I must have better manners than that, or Sauchie will see to me. So you've been away from home awhile? Are these" (turning to the strangers) " some of your folks?" "In one sense we may be said to belong to Mr. Ogilby," said the clergyman, who now for the first time caught the name of his new acquaintance, "since he has twice to-day been, if I may so say, our preserver,-once by helping us out of the mud and mire, and again by directing us to this comfortable haven from the storm. Your good wife is, as you see, making us quite at home here." "Yes," joined in the mistress, "Mr. Walter got here first, and told us there was a gentleman and lady on the road; who would be here by-and-by; and then, when the rain came up, he was afraid they might get wet, and so we had a good fire made up ready for them. And now, if your gown is dry, and you would like a room, miss,- [ don't know as I well know how to call your name," said she, a little embarrassed. "Call us Morton, if you please," said Alice, who had, not been able, as the landlady proceeded with her speech, to refrain from turning with a sudden glance toward the young gentleman. She knew that her look ought to have expressed gratitude for such kind attention to her own 3  &#xD;<pb n="26-27" xml:id="VAC7016-00000013"/> 26        WALTER OGILBY.  and her father's comfort; yet she was conscious that it was rather one of curiosity, to discover, if possible, how  much of the afternoon's adventures he had thought proper to reveal. She withdrew her eyes hastily, as she found X! his fixed somewhat thoughtfully upon her. Perhaps he  was observing how, in spite of her raised hand and folded  handkerchief to screen her face from the fire, it was be-  coming burned to a deep glow; perhaps he was speculat- ing upon the effect of a sudden ray of sunlight, which was X now streaming through the western window upon her hair of rich golden brown; possibly he was thinking it quite advisable for her to accept her hostess's offer, and  retire until she had somewhat adjusted her toilet, after  the vicissitudes of which it still bore some traces. It was the latter interpretation that suggested itself to the young lady; and she rose with alacrity to avail herself of Mrs. Van Tine's proposal. As, in doing so, she turned , in full view of the long apartment, she could not withhold a compliment, which her experience in her father's parish  had taught her was ever most grateful to the enterprising  housewife.  "What quantities of beautiful yarn you have, Mrs. Van  Tinel Surely you do not spin it all yourself?" No," said the hostess, looking much pleased; "I have  help by times. Miss Freelove, here, spins when she is not  teaching or making my caps and finny-fying me up a little. She is a first-rate, good spinner, from Litchfield county, on the other side. We like to make what cloth we use; for I ain't no hand for factory muslin."           X Her guest, to whom this term for unbleached cotton was : new, readily agreed with her that muslin must be a very poor article for family use.  "When I was married," continued the good woman, "I had thirty pairs of linen sheets, of my own spinning and    WALTER OGILBY.         2'7 weaving, besides a big pillow-case full of stockings that I had spun and knit myself." All the company expressed due admiration at this wonderful statement, except Miss Freelove. She sat knit- ting with all her might,-her mouth pursed up, and evi- dently ready to explode on the first occasion. "It must have taken you a very long time to accomplish so much. Can you spin more than a run in a day?" Ally had no objection to show how learned she was in the matter. "Why, a run is an ordinary day's work for a woman doing her little turns about the house besides," replied the lame. "I could spin a run and a half in a day, and not hurt myself,--or even two, for't I know?" "And 1," broke forth Miss Freelove, "know a young voman, not a hundred miles off, who has spun her two 'un and a half, between sun and sun, and reeled it into he bargain. None of your coarse trash, neither,-fine bread for damask,--so fine that a run would pass through wedding ring." "If she only had one," said the farmer, with a sly ;mile.  "I suppose she might have one," retorted the spinster, artly, " if she was very much put to it to get married. 'There's ne'er a gray goose that swims, but soon or late May find some honest gander for her mate.' That's true, ain't it, Miss Van Tine?"And she looked first at the latter, and then at her husband, as much as to say, 'Now you've got it." The farmer understood the sarcasm upon his own want of education, as well as upon the mature age of his wife when he had taken her for his second helpmate; but he contented himself with replying,--  &#xD;<pb n="28-29" xml:id="VAC7016-00000014"/> 28        WALTER OGILBY. "A man that knows how to choose a mate that has got  larning and good temper enough for two, needn't be afraid of being called a gander. And may-be," added he, in a lower tone, "there's more than one gray goose that - wouldn't say no, if she was ithe one asked." Miss Freelove looked as if she would have liked to give  another sharp retort; but, either having none in readiness, or deeming it unwise to provoke the master of the house -; further, she held her peace, and Miss Morton followed her  hostess out of the apartment.  CHAPTER III.  IN the neat little room to which she was shown, Ally had leisure to take herself seriously to task. "How childish and unreasonable to feel so annoyed I I i might at least have a little self-respectl What if this : stranger had even laughed outright at our forlorn appear- ance? It certainly is not worth a thought. I must be, philosophical, and dismiss from my memory- "And  : here rose up again before her the whole scene at the  spring, --her own figure, that of Mrs. Garry, and even the image of her excellent father tugging and chirruping  in vain to the headstrong beast. She was ready to cry with vexation. "Well, it cannot be helped," was at length her sage reflection. "There is nothing but to make the best of it.  It is not likely I shall ever see Mr. Walter Ogilby again in the whole course of my life." Ally pronounced these 1    WALTER OGILBY.         29 words With great emphasis, as if to draw from them all/ the consolation of which she just now stood in need. "After all," pursued she, "it is hardly fair to punish the young man, by my silence and discourtesy, for the nisfor- tune of having been of service to us. I must, in mere pro- priety, make an effort to be civil to him: therefore, when I go down-stairs again, I shall take pains to converse in an easy, pleasant way, as if nothing in particular had hap- pened to disturb my tranquillity." Ally made these resolutions while she was replacing her rumpled collar with a fresh one, and while she brushed down her luxuriant brown Lair until it lay smoothly over her forehead, and hung in long, soft curls behind her ears, according to the prevailing fashion. She descended to the parlor in this excellent disposition; but, alas! on entering it and finding it occupied only by the young gentleman himself, she had the mortification to feel the color mounting to her temples at his simple ad- dress,- "I hope you feel refreshed after the fatigue and excite- ment of this changeful daly.  And her reply, "Thank you, I feel quite refreshed," was not altogether in the indifferent, self-possessed tone she had determined upon. "I fear the dampness of the weather may increase your 'ather's rheumatism," was Mr. Ogilby's second observa- tion.  Alice "hardly thought it would ;" and then, finding that, lotwithstanding her previous arrangement, her stock of easy, elegant conversation was not quite ready for use, she sauntered toward a book-shelf which hung suspended by a green cord and tassel against the wall at a little d-is- Lance. "How silly and absurd This will never do. I ought 3*  &#xD;<pb n="30-31" xml:id="VAC7016-00000015"/> 30        WALTER OGILBY. to say something,-inform him that it has done raining, or ask him if it is going to begin again,-or something of the kind," said she to herself. She took a book from the shelf, hoping to draw from it an inspiration of courage. "Boston's Fourfold State."  Excellent in its way, but furnishing nothing to the present purpose. She exchanged it for another,-"Pilgrim's Progress," an old-fashioned edition, embellished with wood-cuts, executed  in a style to give the impression that grace and beauty were by no means the distinguishing attributes of saints, any more than of sinners. "Now, cannot I possibly find something to make a re- mark about? ' Christian in the Slough of Despond ' That suits our case exactly. My face, when Mr. Ogilby rode up to our assistance, probably wore an expression very much like this of poor Pilgrim." And at the idea one of her brilliant, joyous smiles stole over her countenance. It was very attractive, and it en- couraged the young gentleman to leave the window near which he had continued standing after his first ineffectual attempt to engage her in conversation, and to approach the book-shelf.  Alice hastily closed the book, and tookjip another. "If he should happen to open at that picture, he cannot fail to b make the application," thought she. She busied herself in turning over an odd volume of Miss Hannah More's I Works. "May I inquire if you find anything here to interest .  you?" asked Mr. Ogilby. "I was just glancing at the 'Search after Happiness,'" she replied.                    K  "That, of course, is a subject that interests us all. I do not remember this little drama particularly." And he   WALTER OGILBY.         31 ventured to approach so near as to give the book a little closer inspection. "I take it for granted, however, that it contains many valuable lessons to direct us in so import- ant a pursuit." "Yes: the precepts it contains are admirable,-full of wisdom. The actual representation of the piece, however, may teach us a lesson which the excellent authoress never contemplated." "The representation? Are you speaking from expe- rience?" "Yes; it is an old friend of mine. You are doubt- less aware that in our 'land of steady habits,' where all theatrical performances are by law prohibited, we occa- sionally make ourselves amends by producing some serious drama-a little play of this kind, for instance-at the an- nual exhibitions of the young ladies' schools?" "I must have heard of it, though I did not at the mo- ment recollect it. And you have taken part in one of these representations?" "Oh, yes!" said Ally, laughing. "I was once Florella, -' that happy she."' "Florellal she seems to be a shepherdess. Was that character particularly suited to your pastoral tastes?" She gave a quick, upward glance, to detect if there was the slightest shade of ridicule in the question. There was no expression, however, but of pleased interest in the open, manly countenance which she now for the first time looked fully upon. "It was assigned to me," she replied, "chiefly, I be- lieve, because it was easy for me to coax some one among my father's parishioners into fashioning a crook suitable for the occasion." "And did you and your companions succeed in identify- ing yourselves with the personages you represented? The  &#xD;<pb n="32-33" xml:id="VAC7016-00000016"/> 32        WALTER OGILBY. power of producing the ' ideal presence' is, you remember,  the test of dramatic success."     .. Ally gave a merry laugh. "It would have required a great stretch of the imagina- X  tion," said she, "to have fancied ourselves actually the : i young nymphs declaiming, or the venerable monitress laying down the law, in such columns and half-columns of ; heroic verse; and I suspect there were few among us  !j young performers who would not have felt grievously   X mortified had the audience failed for a moment to recollect that we who were dressed so nicely, and remembered our i parts with such propriety, were Miss Such-a-one and Miss Such-a-one."                      X( Mr. Ogilby smiled. "Was the representation a satis- factory one?" he asked.                ? "Nothing could be more so: we were applauded to the  I skies,"                         X "And what were the lessons you learned from it, other X than those inculcated by the excellent authoress, as you hinted at just now?" . "I think we ascertained, among other thi'ngs, how much  a six weeks' preparation of wreaths, bodices, sandals, and j all the paraphernalia of nymphs and shepherdesses,--to say g nothing of the excitement of the rehearsals, and, finally, -I the eclat of the representation itself,--may help to inspire a company of young people with a genuine devotion to the X deity they here invoke. Hail! artless Simplicity, beautiful maid!'"  She pointed to the lines on the open page which she held in her hand. "I must confess," said Mr. Ogilby, "that this seems a rather questionable method of forming young ladies to that retiring modesty, that distaste for observation, which is ;   WALTER   OQILBY;      ' 33 !onceded to be their greatest charm. We must hope, lotvever, that many of the axioms of wisdom here gathered will remain fixed in the memory, ready for use at some )eriod of after-life." Their further conversation was cut short by the entrance )f Mr. Morton. He was not surprised to find his daugh- ter thus engaged. He knew that, though diffident, she was not usually taciturn or reserved, but that the ice once thawed away between her and a new acquaintance, her frank and buoyant spirit would soon lead her to an unem- barrassed interchange of thought and opinion. Without having seen much of what is called the world,-a term which mav signify fashionable society, foreign countries, or what- ever other sphere the person using it feels himself to be particularly conversant with,-Alice had, as mistress of her widowed father's home, been called upon to entertain a arge circle of refined and intelligent acquaintance; for, though the rector of but a country parish, Mr. Morton was a person of much consideration for his learning and piety, vhile his urbanity of manner and his warm-hearted hos- pitality made his society much sought after, and his home lesorted to, by many who, in outlward position, were greatly his superiors. To all of these Ally had been from her childhood an ob- ject of delight and interest. Her joyous temperament, her affectionate, confiding disposition, were the result of the tenderness with which she had been raised. Having never known harshness herself, she felt no harshness toward others: those by whom she was surrounded loved her, and she loved everybody. The death of her mother, from whom    she had in- herited her quickness of perception and enthusiasm  of character, had for a time changed her cheerful temper into one of deep sadness; but the necessity of ministering  ,  &#xD;<pb n="34-35" xml:id="VAC7016-00000017"/> I34 ' ^ WALTER OGILBY.           X3 34                          II-it* to her father in his bereavement, and the care which de- volved upon her in assisting an aunt in the charge of her  two younger sisters, had taught her to cultivate every I source of happiness, and leave untried no effort to brinpg! back light and comfort to their home. The tie which bound her to her father was, therefore,  no common one. They had been, since this sad event, all j! the world to each other; and they were now to be sepa-  rated for the first time in many years.  Alice was on her way to Milbank, the residence of an X uncle, her mother's brother, to pass the summer. This uncle and his children had occasionally visited Ashfield;  but Alice had not been at their home since her early child-  hood. Journeying was much less the fashion then, than at  the present day. There were few steamboats, and no rail- roads, those ingenious contrivances for annihilating time,  space, and human life. As a general thing, people stayed at home in a humdrum manner, attended to their duties to God and their neighbor, and fancied that they were ful-  filling exactly what they had been sent into the world for. Alice had not seen her aunt for many years. Mr. Ells-  worth, her uncle, had, once or twice in days gone by, suc- :X ceeded in persuading his wife to undertake a journey of , less than eighty miles from Milbank to Ashfield in an ;X easy carriage aind sccommodated with all possible appli- ances for guarding her from undue fatigue; but years had  now passed since Aunt Alida had felt equal to such an exer- tion, and it had at length ceased to be expected'from her. The children of this family were John Peter, the eldest :X son, who was now on the eve of graduating at West Point, Gertrude, a young lady of twenty, and Cornelius, a boy of a fourteen or fifteen. All of these cousins Alice had seen in X her own home, but the visits of the eldest had been the most frequent, and with him alone did she feel herself a !: l * 1i)   WALTER OILBY.         35 well acquainted. There had been other children, who had been early taken from the family circle,-two of them by t sudden and severe accident; and the impression among ;he Connecticut relatives was that the  mother had lost ler health, and all interest in the world at large, in conse- luence of these bereavements. Ally had, therefore, looked borward to this visit as an occasion for bringing into play 1il her resources of cheerfulness and powers of amusement' for the benefit of her afflicted aunt. The good clergyman, as we have before said, had re- ;urned to the parlor, and his daughter came forward to neet hin. "Ah!" said he, with a pleasant smile, "I see you and )ur young friend are entertaining each other. I suppose, ny dear, you have made a great many inquiries about ;our aunt and cousins.1" Ally blushed. She was ashamed to acknowledge that she had not once thought of them. It would have been such a very natural way of commencing a conversation that she wondered she had not thought of it, instead of branching off into her foolish school-day stories. To Mr. Morton's inquiries, Mr. Ogilby replied that Mr. Ellsworth's family were undoubtedly well, or his mother, who was- their near neighbor, would have mentioned it in her letters- For hbilnself, he had been some time from home, he had seen none of them lately. "Mrs. Ellsworth is a good deal of an invalid, and rarely, goes from home, I believe," said Mr Morton. "Indeedl I was not aware of it,'7 replied theoung gentleman. "She has not the appearance of ill health." "That is a very bad symptom I I am afraid then that her disease is more of a hectic even than I had supposed. That always produces an unnatural bloom. I would far rather have heard that my sister showed her illness more;  &#xD;<pb n="36-37" xml:id="VAC7016-00000018"/> 36        WALTER OGILBY.       A     - but these complaints, alas I are so deceptive I My poor, poor brother I He seems destined to sorrow and affliction." Tears of sympathy gathered in the eyes of thy good clergyman, and it was some little time before he, could compose himself. In the mean time, the table for the even- : .. ing meal had been laid at one end of the long apattment in which the travellers were, and they now, in compliance with the invitation of their hostess, took their places X: around the board, standing, as was the good old custom, ; while the clergyman reverently asked a blessing.   - Alice had wondered that they had not again seen Miss v? Freelove. She had expected to be met with eager ove - tures to a more intimate acquaintance, and with a series : of questions upon every particular of her own affairs and -: history. It was not, however, until the company had seated themselves at table, that the spinster made her ap- pearance. Her striped factory dress had been exchanged - X for her best silk-a changeabella, as she termed it. Her hair bore recent marks of the curling-tongs, and stood in cork-screw projections at every possible angle around i her freckled face, while a deep flush upon one side of, her forehead and cheek gave tokens of some unsteadiness of At hand during this agitating portion of her toilet. About her neck was coquettishy tied a straw-colored handker- chief, so disposed as not to conceal the string lof gold beads, which were her patent of respectable descent. She tripped with a light, girlish air into the room, and saying, X blandly, "Miss Van Tine, let me pour the tea while you attend to your little chores," she took the teapot out of the good woman's hands and commenced filling the cups : at a side table. This done, she handed one to each guest,  giving at the same time as near an imitation as she could X compass of the sort of half-curtsy which she had seen : Alice bestow upon Mr. Ogilby when he stepped forward to ;   WALTER OGILBY.          37 open the door for her on her quitting the spinning-room, an hour before.                  ' The young people glanced at each other, and with some difficultv preserved a becoming gravity. Good Mr. Mor- ton accepted the attention offered, with only this reflection to himself, "What an uncommonly nice, civil person she seems to be, after all I What a pity that she was so rude to Mr. Van Tine a little while ago!"o The hostess, finding herself thus released, proceeded to finish what Miss Freelove called '"her chores." These consisted for the present in transcribing, from some papers she produced from her pocket, into a large account-book which she withdrew from an old-fashioned cherry-wood desk at some little distance from the tea-table. While thus employed, the master of the house made his appear- ance through a side door. His leather apron gave token that he had been, or was about to be, engaged in a differ- ent occupation from that which he had followed in the earlier part of the day. He stooped over his wife 'sshoulder, and, in a low tone, appeared to be enumerating sundry particulars, counting on his fingers, and now and then raising his head, as if to recall something that he had forgotten, while the good woman wrote from   his dictation. From the manner in which all this was conducted, Alice: felt convinced that the substantial farmer, the wealthy mechanic (for such was their host), -could neither read nor write. And yet she could hardly believe such a thing possible. Never before had she "et with a person destitute of both these acquirements. Now she understood why her dear native State was called* he "Athens of America ;" and, with a pardonable sentiment, )f patriotic pride, she went over in her mind all the praises- f New Enogland which had been said or sung, since thec r: By Joel Barlow. 4  &#xD;<pb n="38-39" xml:id="VAC7016-00000019"/> 38        WALTER OGILB Y. days of the Pilgrim Fathers, by their self-complacent sons and daughters. The dialogue of the honest farmer and his wife ended in  a whispered colloquy, somewhat to this effect:- i  "Have you fixed that shoe for Walter's' horse?" "Yes-all that it wanted fixing."           "I suppose you had to make a fresh fire in the forge." X "No need of any fire: three strokes of a hammer and a turn with the pinchers, just for make-believe. I guess, Sauchie, if there hadn't been some great strait to stop here with us awhile, there wasn't nothing in the shoe but what : would have gone another twenty mile."         ;i CHAPTER IV.              E ALICE was aroused from her reflections by a sudden out-   break of Miss Freelove.       Aid   "I guess it's lilyet, you may see me down yourl way before long, Mr. Ogilby. Miss Van Tine was a-saying you live down near the manufactories, and I've heard her talk so much, too, about your ma and the Ellsworths.  ' And, now I think of 't-le' me see I Wa?n't it down there- a-ways that a smart fore-handed farmer that we know of come a-courtin' once bn a time?"Here Miss Freelove o giggled significantly. "I guess I must go down there and try my luck, for I've hendered round here a consid'- able time, and ha'n't seemed to pick up anybody. "  "Not strictly Athenian, it must be admitted," was  ; Ally's mortifying thought, as she listened to the accents of her countrywoman. The farmer hastened to remark,--   1 "If Sauchie [his wife's name was Sarah] picked me         .   wALTyER OGILBY         39  up, it was not by tryin'. I didn't find it an easy job to   - get her.: Miss Freelove went on,                    x "I s'pose there's plenty a body could find to do, down there, by way of beginning. I s'pose you don't know if they want any spinning, or teaching, or anything of that sort, down in your neighborhood "-to the young gentleman. "I really cannot inform you," was his reply. "There are several schools there already; and you are aware that the factory-children are not at leisure to attend a day- school." Then, turning to his hostess, "I must go and look into the condition of my horse," said he. "He has to carry me ten miles yet, this evening.", "You will not think of riding that distance in the dark, my dear sir," interposed the clergyman, earnestly. ," Why, it is after sunset now 1" Mr. Ogilby smiled. "A  canter of ten miles over a good road, by starlight such as we shall have, is a pleasant recreation, and Fingal will enjoy it as much as I shall."  "Fingal!" repeated Alice, involuntarily.  "You have given your steed a   high-sounding name,"  said Mr. Morton, with a smile. "He ought to be a hero." "He is one, in his way," replied Mr Ogilby. "I do not consider the name of the wild dark chief degraded in being bestowed as it is. I am a good deal of an Arab in my feel- ings: I  have a great respect for my horse." They had all walked forth upon the piazza, or rather platform in front of the house, to enjoy the cool evening air, and Mr. Ogilby was tightening the buckle of his valise as this conversation went on. He patted the neck of his horse lovingly as he uttered  the conclusion of the sentence.

C time of the freshet last spring, when you got little Tom Carroll safe ashore?" inquired Mrs. Van Tine. "I was down there a few weeks after, and his mother told me how ! you saved the child's life."             : "Fingal did his duty very well then, as I hope he always will," said his master, and, changing the subject immedi- ately,- "When shall I tell my mother you will be down- to see her?"                       - X "Oh, most likely I shall be coming down the road Satur- day, on my way to the sloop: that's market-day, you know, ! -and I've quite a good deal to send to York this time." "Then I must be on the lookout for a particularly trim, smart vrow, knitting all the way to the landing, with a pipe [ in her mouth, and a load of calves and butter-tubs behind  her, in the wagon."  "No, indeed," cried the good woman; I never knit upon the road-neither do I follow smoking. I am Jersey born, you know; I am not so very Dutch-though, as I've i lived up here sen' I was a girl, I may have got some of their ways. It isn't for me to say whether I can make as good butter as any of them; but you may tell your mother : I shall leave a tub of my best at the store for her, on my way to the landing." The young gentleman promised to remember her mes- sage, and, approaching Mr. Morton to bid him adieu, he added,- "We shall meet again, I hope, sir, very soon. It will give me great pleasure to see you and my mother acquainted.  Then, turning to Alice, "If you will allow me to bring my young sisters to call upon you," said he, "they will act' as the representatives of my mother, who makes no visits." Alice bowed and said a few civil words in reply. The last kind shake of the hand was given to the host and   WALTER OGILBY.         4' hostess, Miss Freelove rushing forward to claim her share of notice, and the young gentleman took his departure. Alice longed to ask Mrs. Van Tine the particulars of the incident to which she had alluded as having called forth the powers of Fingal, but hesitated to betray her curiosity upon the subject. Miss Freelove saved fher the trouble of an inquiry. "Come, Miss Van Tine," began she, immediately, "do tell us about little Tom Carroll's being saved in the freshet. I had a great mind to have asked you to tell it out right before the young-man, so that we could have praised him as be deserved." "How do you know that he deserved any praise, if you have not heard the story?" asked Mrs. Van Tine, with a quiet smile. "Oh, because you said something that sounded like it. But go on, let's hear what it'was."  "Well, the story is this," began Mrs. Van Tine, ad- dressing herself more to Miss Morton and her father than   i to her third listener. "When the snows melted last spring, and a deal of water came pouring down the sides of the    1 mountains into the creek,-or kill, as most of the people call it,-of course the stream raised considerable. "This is not a thing that always i)pens at the breaking- up, as I'm told it does over your way; but it will, now  and then, and it does a deal of mischief. Well, there is here and there, down  around the factories, a boy, whose parents are too tender of him, or too proud, or something,  - to make him work or go to school, so he is always idling about and doing what he has no business to. This Tommy Carroll is just such a one. The freshet brought along branches and pieces of trees that had washed down from the high grounds, and even some pens and enclosures from along the banks of the kill.                 * 4*  &#xD;<pb n="42-43" xml:id="VAC7016-00000021"/> 42        WALTER OGILBY. "Tommy and two or three other little boys, whose people live a piece above the dam, were playing on the bank one morning when the water was highest, when they saw a hen-coop come dancing along. If he had been old enough -  to have sense, he might have known the danger; but no I what does Mr. Tom do, as soon as he sees it, but j whips into Grand'ther Kuyper's boat that was tethered e just by the bridge that crosses there, and after the hen- j coop! The boys called to him not to; but, before you could g wink, he had got the noose of the rope over the stake, and away he was going in the boat down the stream, as fast  as the hen-coop. The boys screeched and screamed, the women ran, and soon lots of people came pouring out of  the factory, some rushing above the dam and some .below it. rhey caught up poles, pieces of board, and whatever they thought would reach him; but he was too far out in the middle of the stream. When the boat got to the edge of the dam it just balanced a minute, and then over it went. Everybody thought the child was certainly gone; and oh I they say it was awful to hear the screech his poor mother gave. But the boat did not capsize, and j Tom in his fright had got close down in the bottom and # held on tight. The current carried it along thumping  against the rocks, which are pretty plenty down below the : dam, and at last it stuck fast on a monstrous big one. Mr.  Walter Ogilby was riding down toward the bridge just as ! he saw the boat cast loose by Tommy. He took right up i the hill again, and down the main road as hard as he could  spur, till he game to the new street lately cut in, a good piece below the dam, and he got to the water just after the boat had settled on the big rock, some eight or ten rods- above. People could see him from around the dam, and the high banks on both sides, and they said if he went into that deep water, and among those rocks and foam, he'd   WALTER OGILBY.     I   43 never come out again alive. But he didn't hear them; and, if he had, it would have made no difference. In he went. Sometimes he went forward, and sometimes it seemed like as if he went backward, but that horse of his carried him on, and the first thing people saw, was Tomhmy out of the boat and on the horse's back, clinging tight hold, and look- ing like a drownded rat--and then they all took breath again, for they knew that if he got there he could get back again. I'm sure I don't wonder that he sets store by that horse. " Both father and daughter listened with interest to the animated recital of the good woman. "Hov happy the recollection of such a service to a fellow- creature must make him i" observed the clergyman, after a moment's pause. Alice said nothing. the whole scene was before her. She seemed to hear the shriek of the mother at one moment, and her outpouring of joy and thanksgiving at another. When Mrs. Van Tine and Miss Freelove had left the room, "Papa," said she, "I think this young gentleman is a Scotsman." "What do you judge fromi my dear?" "In the first place, the name of Ogilby or Ogilvie-I suppose it was once all the same-is Scotch, you know. Then he calls his horse Fingal; and---"' She hesitated. "'Pretty good reasons. Have you any other?" "Yes, I have a better reason than either of the others. In all our conversation he has never spoken of himself or his affairs, except his slight allusion to his mother. Now, if he had been a Yankee, he would have talked about his home and his business, where he had been, and what he had been doing there-just as I was on the point of doing more than once, or rather," with a merry laugh, " as in fact I did, far beyond what was altogether becoming." k    &#xD;<pb n="44-45" xml:id="VAC7016-00000022"/> "       WALTER OGILBY. An early breakfast was prepared for the travellers, and, after many kind things had been said on both sides, and X hopes expressed that fortune might favor their meeting @ again, the clergyman and his daughter mounted into the old chaise, and by a few encouraging chirps to Mrs. Garry, aided by a suitable application of the ends of the reins, they soon induced her to set off in her usual jog-trot. ? The drive over the plain which stretches along the base - of the Highlands is always one of uncommon beauty. It  was more than usually lovely under the beams of this bright May morning, when the mists which succeeded  I the shower of the previous day had been lifted, and hung in fantastic wreaths along the sides of the mountains,-- now creeping slowly up, now settling around the pines e and other evergreens, having their dark, conical tops pierc- ing through, like islets in a lake of foam. Alice gazed with delight on scenery of a character so entirely new to her. "How exquisite I how charming! What a constant enjoyment it will be to me to gaze on it! What a happy, happy summer is before me  I must forget yesterday, and think only of the present and the future." i ; In due time they reached the village. A few miles yet, and they would be at Milbank. The houses of the little town stood principally upon one street,-as in most country villages,-from which a few green lanes stretched out here and there, prolonged into the cross-roads that intersected the fertile country around. Here and there might be seen the residence of a person of consideration, occupying a larger space of ground than its neighbors; and standing back, amid groups of trees, or approached by formal avenues. These were probably the homes of the physician, the principal lawyer, or the most prosperous merchant. Everything that met the eye bespoke comfort,   WALTER OGILBY.         45 good order, and competence. A  stranger would have pronounced that a pauper had never been seen within the precincts of the place. About half-way down the street was the principal store of the village, conspicuous on the front of which was the sign "POST-OFFICE." A handsome horse and gig were tied before the door, among market-wagons, saddle-horses, and vehicles of various descriptions. As our friends drew near, the figure of a portly gentleman issuing from the door caught the eye of Mr. Morton.' "Why, Ally I look there I That is surely your uncle George I It is, indeed." And he reined' Garry toward the steps of the building. The recognition had been mutual, and Uncle George stood ready to receive and welcome them. Loud and hearty was his greeting. His face beamed with satisfac- tion as he shook his brother-in-law by the hand, and kissed Ally again and again, as she leaned out, of the chaise to embrace him. "How well you look, my dear! and how    you have grownl How very like---"   He stopped, recollecting himself. "Why did you not write and let, me know the precise time of your coming, that we might have been all ready to receive you?" "I wrote ten days ago,-as soon as I could possibly do i so,-but these post-riders are so uncertain I I had more difficulty than usual in getting my pulpit supplied for two  I Sundays. " "Oh, shut up your echurch," said his brother, laughing, "and give your people a little rest now and then. I'll be l bound they won't complain." The clergyman shook his head reprovingly. "Ah I George, thoughtless still. But you have not told me about sister Alida. How is she? No worse, I hope."  &#xD;<pb n="46-47" xml:id="VAC7016-00000023"/> "       WALTER OGILBY. "No, no worse," answered the husband, cheerfully. 1 She never feels very well, you know." Alice observed with pain that her uncle did not look as much grieved as would have been proper while making this announcement. "Her household cares worry her a good deal just now," continued Mr. Ellsworth; " and Gitty is away at Nine Part-  ners', at Colonel Westhrook's. They are having a nice, gay-time up there, for such staid folks; but if she had known you were coming so soon, she would not have gone." i' If she could not stay at home with her sick mother, she would hardly have remained to see me," thought Ally; and a strong feeling of indignation and surprise rose up in her bosom. "Poor aunty! I am glad I am going to her. I shall stay with her, and try to cheer and comfort her." After a few more mutual inquiries, Mr. Ellsworth said, "Well, you will excuse my returning back with you, as I am going, by appointment, up toward the Hook, to meet a person on business; but I will be at home to a late dinner, -that is," added he, laughing, " if they have such a thing to-day." "If sister Alida is in trouble, and Gertrude absent, I am afraid our arrival will be not quite opportune," suggested his brother. "Oh, don't worry yourself about that. Aulchy will be delighted to see you. You will make her feel quite well at once. Nothing could please her better than a visit from you, at any time." And, bidding them a smiling adieu, with the air of one who has no time to .lose, Mr. Ells- worth gave his horse a cut with the whip, and was soon out of sight, while Garry and the old chaise rattled down the road in an opposite direction. *s   WALTER OGILBY.         47  C HAPTER V. TEE mansion of Mr. Ellsworth at Milbank was a large, low, old-fashioned building, with dormer-windows in the' roof, and piazzas in front and rear. It stood back from the road, with a small lawn in front, dotted with shrubbery and shaded by clumps of fine old locust-trees. Altogether, it was a very pretty place. The neighborhood would have been, to most persons, its greatest objection. It was in too immediate proximity 'to the'large, flourishing manufacturing establishment of which Mr. Ellsworth was the chief proprietor. The con- venience of its vicinity to the object of all his thoughts and cares was, however, a recommendation to its owner; while to his good lady the opportunity thus afforded her of sympathizing with all the domestic troubles and pre- scribing for all the ailments of the factory-people and their children more than counterbalanced the jeopardy into which fruit, eggs, and chickens were occasionally brought by their unfortunate position. The view in front of the house, extending over rich fields and gentle undulations, had nothing of peculiar interest; but from the back piazza, and from the garden, on a rising ground at the left, could be seen the long extent of factory-buildings in the valley below, a short reach of the creek foaming along its rocky channel, the beautifully variegated plateau at the foot bf the mountain on the opposite side of the stream, and, still farther beyond, the magnificent chain itself. as it stretches away, down to the Hudson.  &#xD;<pb n="48-49" xml:id="VAC7016-00000024"/> 48        WALTER OGILBY. As our travellers first drove in sight, they were struck with the air of bustle and commotion visible about the establishment,-carpets hanging upon the fences, chairs, tables, and sofas filling the piazza, or even, for want of room elsewhere, set out upon the grass in front, beds and mattresses upon the roof, blankets and woollen garments sunning in the open windows. "One would suppose they were packing up for an emi- gration," observed Ally, in some alarm. "This is doubtless," replied her father, " a Dutch house- cleaning, about which we have heard so much. I am afraid your poor aunt will be the worse for such a turmoil around her. Where can they have put her to keep her quiet and comfortable?"  They entered the gate and walked up the steps of the piazza. A stout black woman, with a pail of whitewash in one hand, was giving directions, in no gentle voice, to a little, withered man of her own color, who was fitting a long handle into the brush she held in the other. She called, unceremoniously, as she saw the travellers approach,-- "Please come here, missus."' A plump, comfortable personage, with an old straw bonnet perched upon the top of her head, came forward at the summons from the back piazza. Ally gazed in astonishment. This blooming, handsome face and rotund figure could not surely belong to her in- valid aunt! Yet it was even so,-as Ally could not doubt when she received her hearty embrace, and when her father was met with a welcome scarcely less demon- strative. "Why, brother William! And Ally-this is Ally, I suppose I Why, my dear child I to think of you catching us in such a muss! Never in all my life did we clean house so late before! But where will you sit down? I've   .WALTER OGILBY.        49 got two women a-scrubbiin' in the two parlors, and Dinah    is just a-goin' to whitewash the dinin'-roon : she don't  i think Jake can do it fit to be seen. And up stairs there's nothin' put aside yet, though Libby and her sister's been at it ever since daylight. We whitewashed there yester- day, and I did think we should have got a little more ahead to-day. But I can't do much myself, for mny health is not good. You know, brother William" (here her voice   j sank into a plaintive key), "I'm never very well."    0 Mr. Morton had indeed supposed so; but he now began to think he must have been mistaken. In Ally's mind,  her uncle and cousin were in a great measure exonerated.  The whole party had now retreated from the hall to theH front piazza, in order to give full play to the scrubbers and nit whitewashers.  "Ohl here's a good, comfortable place," said Aunt  Aulchy. "Sit here on the sofa, in the shade. I must keep on my old bonnet, you see, or the dust would spoil my cap and ribbons. Dinah, call somebody to take away the horse and chair,--you've got the old chair yet, I see, brother. And get one of the girls to help you in with the   trunk and things. You may set theml right down here at  present: we'll have some spot cleared up to-rights. My bedroom, I ghess-no, that's got all the curtains and pictures in it, and the cheny that we took down out of the dinin'-room closet. Well, we'll find some place. I must tell you how it all happened that we are so late gettin' fixed."  She seated her two relatives on the sofa, and herself in a large rocking-chair facing them. As the soft wind blew in upon the piazza and brought the fragrance of the open-  ing locust-blossoms and of the various flowers and shrubs from the garden, Ally thought they could not have found a pleasanter place. Aunt A ulchy held her niece's hand in 5   &#xD;<pb n="50-51" xml:id="VAC7016-00000025"/> 50       .WALTER OGILBY. her own, all the time patting it affectionately, while she went on:- "You know it has been rainy all the spring-ever since Paas at least; and I said to George, says I, ' It's no use in the world to begin cleanin' house till we've done with fires and can get our hearths and jambs painted. Sister Har- g denberg tried it three weeks agio, and was sorry enough for her pains.' Well, then, when the warm weather came on suddenly, to be sure, Pinxter must happen just at that time. I never knew it come so late, seems to me. So  then my girls must all have a week's holiday to go over the mountain to keep Pinxter with their friends.?'  "What is Pinxter, aunt?" asked Alice. "It is what some people call Whitsunday, my dear; and all the negroes think they must put by work and keep it, much as we do New-Year's Day. It would be a won- derful hardship if a darkey could not have a chance to keep Pinxter. Well, they went. I had nobody left at home with me but little Silvy. So I sent and got a white girl from over the creek-a little way up the mountain. Well, she turned out to be a snoop. She would go snoopin' round in closets and in trunks-every place that was not locked. What do you think? one day I was in my bureau- drawer, and I saw that things looked mussed up. Says I, 'She's been a-snoopin' here, as sure as the world:' So I looked, and a beautiful pink bow of mine was a-missin', and a string of beads that Gitty used to wear when she was a baby. I went out straight into the kitchen. 'Silvy,' says I, 'where's Locky?' You know her name was Ra- chel, but we called her Locky for shortness. 'Where's Locky?' says I. 'Oh,' says Silvy, 'she just went out of here.  She had on her bonnet, and a bundle in her hand. I thought missus sent her on a arrant.' 'Well,' says I, ' she's a snoop; and I'm glad she's gone. She won't get   WALTER OGILB Y        51 herweek's wages; that's one comfort.' Do you think, the little black spook didn't grin and say, ' Guess Locky took care of that. I saw her stop master on the road, and he took out his purse and gave her some money.' "Ohb my dear!" sighed the poor lady, drawing a long breath, " you don't know what a time I did have till those girls came back! I do wish there could be a law passed to have Pinxter come only every other year." "And Gertrude is absent now, her father told us," said Mr. Morton: "Yes, it's a good thing she isn't here: it would fret her terribly to have things standin' about so. She thinks housekeepin' can be done by witchcraft, without troublin' anybody. She will learn better when she tries it herself. And 'twas lucky George had some business up at the Hook to take him out of the way; it's always bad to have anybody about at such a time."  This remark, which, from another, might have caused    I doubts as to their own welcome, did not make Ally or her father uncomfortable. They saw the current of Aunt Aulchy's thoughts, and already divined that they were less in her way than her own husband and daughter would hIave been.                         i Aunt Aulchy was a type of the housekeepers of that sphere and period. To be certain that not one spot could be found, from garret to cellar, that had not felt the purify- ing influences of the scrubbing-pail and whitewash-brush, -that not an article of apparel had been suffered to escape a shaking, folding, and packing away with her own hands,-- I Wt not a cup, glass, or kitchen-utensil. had failed to re- ceive her personal inspection before being restored to its appropriate shelf or cupboard,-this was indispensable to her comfort and happiness. She complained of the labor as a burden, though she could not have existed without it.  &#xD;<pb n="52-53" xml:id="VAC7016-00000026"/> 52        WALTER OGILB Y. She was a toiling, bustling housekeeper, never idle, yet, strange to say, never contented. She would complain in a pathetic tone of "bein' kept patchin' and mendin' all day long," when the fact was that the most skilful tailor could not have repaired a rent in Cornelius's jacket, or replaced a button on his vest, to satisfy her fastidious eye. Travel- ling round and round in this contracted circle, her mind occupied with her household and herself, her servants and  her health were alternately the subject of lamentation, until at length, as might be expected, her husband and I daughter grew indifferent to her complaints, and came to 7    regard them as mere habit. They saw that, with every appliance for living at her ease, she preferred making her- 7 self a slave, and rather set it down that." mother was happiest when she could make herself most uncomfort- able."         - When Mr. Ellsworth had first met Miss Alida West- brook at her brother's house in New York, he had been captivated by her beauty and innocent, gentle manners. As she was heiress to a handsome fortune, she was sur-  rounded by admirers; and, in the gentleman's haste to secure  the prize, he quite overlooked the lady's indifference to the  improvement of her mind, and her deficiency in taste and i cultivation; particulars which have ever been regarded by the young men of New England as of vital importance.  Perhaps he relied much upon his own influence in inspire  ing his lady-love with a preference for pursuits superior to those which had hitherto occupied her; but, if so, he had forgotten that his own devotion to one great object-the accumulation of a fortune-would be likely to interfere 1   with any great degree of attention to his wife's intellectual improvement. People declared that he was a lucky fellow, "and that he and his bride would make the handsomest couple in the city"--both of which assertions he believed:   WALTER OGILBY.         53 so he married, and settled himself on his wife's property at Milbank. In, process of time, as the prospects of the manu- facturing business became more flattering, he removed the old mill which had hitherto stood upon the stream, erected new buildings, opened streets, which he built up with rows of houses for his workmen, imported Yankee ingenu- ity and enterprise to aid him in carrying out his projects, and was now, after the lapse of five-and twenty years, a rich, good-looking, good-humored, selfish sort of man, who lived for this world and troubled himself as little as possi- ble about the next. "But you must tell nle something about John Peter," said Mr. Morton. "I hear from my brother that there is no prospect of his obtaining leave to make you a visit while I am here." "Oh, dear, no! he is studying so hard for examination. His standing, I suppose George told you, is a wery good one--one of the first five, we expect; and he wouldn't for the world do anything to interfere with his coming out well,-not even to see Ally, though he wrote us, my dear, to be sure and let him know just as soon as you arrived. Oh, you need not blush. I felt a little jealous that so much of his furlough last summer should be spent at Ashfield, instead of at home with me; but then I remember when I was young." "I do not blush, aunt, or, at least, I ought not to," said Alice, laughing. "You need not be jealous of me. John Peter did not prolong his stay at Ashfield on my account particularly. " "I rather think," said Mr. Morton, "that young Mr. James Andrews was the attraction. They were together almost all the time. ' I remember they would go shooting or fishing in the morning, and we would see nothing more of John Peter till late in the evening. Those young men 5*  &#xD;<pb n="54-55" xml:id="VAC7016-00000027"/> 54       WALTER OGILBI. seemed quite inseparable; which I a little'wondered at, knowing what a decided aversion the old captain has to the military." "An aversion to the militarvy!" exclaimed Mrs. Ells- worth, with warmth-: " then I hope my John Peter will never go near his house again." "Perhaps he is in hopes the prejudice will wear off," said Ally. "What if it- does, or what if it does not?" asked Aunt Aulchy, with more energy than was her wont. "I don't think John Peter will trouble himself about the whims of  an old sea-captain. I have heard him speak of this Cap-  tain Andrews; indeed, I remember to have seen him my- self, years ago, when I last wisited my poor sister Annie; i and I am sure I shall never forget what a rough, disagree- able sort of a man I thought him. It seemed a pity that 1he should ever get leave to stay on shore. Not like the military! A soldier is as good as a sailor, any day, or I should like to know why."                Mr. Morton felt bound to allay the storm he had raised.  "My dear sister," he said, "you must not judge the captain by anything I have inadvertently said. You know l/ there is always a little feeling of rivalry between the Army and the Navy, and sailors sometimes speak their minds a i little too bluntly. I do not think the captain has any very strong feeling upon the subject, after all; for both James  his son, and Miss Kate his daughter, were very polite to " John Peter, which shows that at least their father has no I wish that they should adopt his prejudices."      V But Aunt Aulchy was not mollified. "I am sure, now, that it must have been that wery thing John Peter was thinking of, one day, when he seemed quite excited. 'What I can't stand in the officers of the Navy,' says he, 'is that they are not only unjust to us them-   WALTER OGILBY.         55 selves, but they try to make others feel as they do; and Captain Andrews is the most stubborn man I ever met with.' That is just what he said. I don't think I ever saw him so-worked up about atrifle before. But it's no matter; tand I must go and see how those girls get on. Ally, my dear, you caA look in the bookcase in the hall, and get a magazine, or soniething, for your father to read. I'll be back to-rights." CHAPTER    V I. IT was growing too warm for a walk in the garden. Ally's only resource was in the bookcase to which she had been referred. Mr. Ellsworth having gradually laid aside the literary tastes and habits of his early years, his library had re- ceived no modern additions. Some old standard works that he had inherited from his father, a few more recent ones on political economy and manufacturing statistics, with all that had ever been issued of Niles' and Cobbett's Registers, made up the catalogue. Alice, after some hesitation, -selected Mathew Carey's "Olive-Branch," as likely to be most to her father's taste, and a huge tattered volume of "Elegant Extracts" for her own perusal.. She amused herself, for a short time before opening her book, with watching the passers-by upon the highroad,-the comfortable, substantial wagons, in which was frequently seen seated a farmer's wife, knitting and smoking,with equal vigor. Sometimes an equestrian would pass, but no figure resembling the fine athletic one, no air or bearing like those of the owner of Fingal, met her eye. She laid aside her bonnet, notwithstanding that her aunt,  &#xD;<pb n="56-57" xml:id="VAC7016-00000028"/> 56       TWALTER OGILB'. who caught sight of her through the open window, called to her " not to tan herself and spoil her pretty complex- ion," and, drawing herself into a corner of the sofa, was soon deep in one of the amusing Essays of Bonnel Thorn- ton. The rattle of wheels, at length, and the crack of a whip made her look up. A light open carriage, in which were a gentleman and two ladies, was passing. The lifting of the hat, and the courteous gesture of the hand, could not be mistaken. They brought to full view all the events of the preceding afternoon. She returned the salutation, but the party did not stop: they drove on toward the village.- "It would be very unlikely that they should call just now, when everything is in such evident disorder. How much better our Connecticut ways of managing are!-one room at a time, and the rest of the house orderly and com- fortable! I cannot so much wonder that my uncle and Gertrude are annoyed at this bustle and confusion." In process of time, Aunt Aulchy had succeeded in bring- ing matters to such a state that a salver and cake-basket, together with a decanter of wine and glasses (there was no teetotalism in those days), could be produced. "iNow, if we sit here a little while longer," said the good lady, with a sigh of fatigue, "we shall most likely have my brother Hardenberg stoppin' in, on his way home, to take a piece with us. He passed about half an hour before you come, going down to wisit a patient at Cedar Grove-Squire Roosevelt's nephew. . You remem- ber Dr. Hardenberg, don't you, brother William? He married my sister Lany-Helena is her name, you know, but we always call her Lany. Ah I there he comes: I'll beckon him in to see you and get a piece'." The dapper little gentleman who drove up in a sulky was obedient to the summons, and, speedily joining the   WALTER OGILBY         fi7 party on the piazza, was introduced anew, in due form. I He gazed with undisguised admiration on Ally's blooming countenance, and, taking her by the chin, to her, no small astonishment kissed her heartily on each cheek. i "There, my dear!" was his address, " see what a hap- piness it is to be an old man! What privileges it gives us! Besides, I am your uncle, you know,-your aunt Aulchy's brother. Any new ailment this morning, sister? If not, we'll sit down and have a glass of wine, which I see you have ready there, and settle what we are to do with our friends here. Gitty being away, and you in a hubbub, I think they had better come at once, and visit Aunt Lany for a day or two. I believe I should grow ten years younger if I had this young lady to look at." Ally laughed and blushed, while the kind-hearted 6old gentleman ran on thus; but she said, "I always thought physicians preferred people with the air of invalids." "Not for companions, my dear. A doctor has no more fancy for a hospital in his home than any other man. Re- member that, Aunt Aulchy, and be sure you look as bright and as happy as this little niece of yours-of ours I mean- before she has been with you a week. When I was a young man, my dear, thin and slender young ladies were all the rage; girls with their eyes so hollow you might put your fist in them-we thought that was lady-like and inter- esting. But as we grew older, we learned better-we ap- proved more of flesh and blood; and now I've reached just this style for nmy standard,"--and most unceremoniously he clasped his hand around Ally's arm, to measure its pro- portions, laughing heattily all the while at her efforts to release it. "Come, doctor," said his sister, " you must not plague Ally. There's a carriage coming. Oh it's the Ogilbys -they won't stop here, I suppose,"-with a sigh at the probable loss of a visit.  &#xD;<pb n="58-59" xml:id="VAC7016-00000029"/> 58        WA AL TER O GILBY. "Ah I Walter Ogilby," said the doctor--" that's a young man after my own heart. What I call well-put-together" -(the doctor was apt to look at people in 'an anatomical point of view),--"compnact and firm, none of your shack- ling, half-built fellows like poor Snyder, who ought not to be trusted out in a high wind. Ogilby's father was a fine specimen of a man before him, but with less of stamina, poor fellow!" "Is his father living? He only spoke of his mother," remarked Ally, musingly., "So you know him, then!" said the doctor, turning quickly upon her. "Where did you meet him? Has he been at Ashfield?" Ally had just time to say, "He overtook us on the road yesterday," when the carriage stopped for a moment. Mr. Ogilby dismounted, and while the others drove on, he en- tered the gate and walked up to the group on the piazza. The hostess was ready with an eager address. "Dear me! Mr. Walter-I am so glad to see youl How are you all at home? I should not have known you had returned, if it had not been for my niece, who was just a telling how you met them yesterday." Ally was annoyed. She was far from intending to tell how the young gentleman had met them-she was sure he must think it very strange that she should be talkinglof him at all. She forgot that it would have been the most natural thing in the world for her to. have given her aunt a full account of all her adventures, instead of keeping carefully silent as she had done. The doctor, whose perceptions were quick as thought, interposed at once. "Yes," said he, "I was just asking my little niece if \ she had ever seen you, and she replied that she had that pleasure yesterday. "   WALTER OGILBY.         59 Neither the slight shade upon Ally's brow, nor its sub- sequent expression of grateful relief, escaped the quick eye of Mr. Ogilby. "And your mother," said Mr. Morton, politely. "I hope you found her well." "Thank you--quite well. I called to propose a little drive with you, toward evening, and a visit to my mother, if you do not find yourself too much fatigued. I did not venture to bring my sisters in upon you this morning, Mrs. Ellsworth; but when you are ready to receive them, they will be happy to pay their respects to Miss Morton. " "Oh you're wery good. Yes, to be sure--Ally must get acquainted with all the young people round. Gitty will not be home until Saturday. I told her we could not- get through house-cleanling till then--it's quite a good deal of a job. And John Peter, he can't comle up from the Point till after examnination-no-not if he is in ever such a strait to come. Did I tell you, Ally, my dear, that he wanted me to make up a party and come right down there as soon as you arrived? He wrote to his fathei about it, though how he knew you was a comin', is more than I can tell, Gitty says she never wrote him a word about it. So you see, sir, we shall be wery glad to see your sisters, or else our niece might be a little lonely at first. After awhile Catlyna and Anna Eliza Westhrook will be up from York for a wisit-and by-and-by my son will be home, with perhaps some of his friends the Cadets with him, and there will be gayety enough.' Cornel'us, too, will be down from his school at Klein 'Sopus; and I warn' you, Ally, that then there will be neither peace nor quietness in the house. But here, we are a talkin' and nobody helped." Having with a little bustle seated all comfortably and seen thenm provided with refieshment, Mrs. Ellsworth  ,^  &#xD;<pb n="60-61" xml:id="VAC7016-00000030"/> 60        WALTER OGILBY. was content to be silent and allow the gentlemen to con- verse awhile together. Mr. Ogilby had the discretion to make a very short visit. He was to call for Mr. Morton to take a drive, late in the afternoon; and he departed with the assurance from the hostess that the carpets should all be upon the floors, and visitors-be admissible within the doors of the mansion, on the second day from the present. The doctor took his leave soon after, but not before Aunt Aulchy had remarked,- "Now you'll go home pleased and satisfied: you've seen your pet-Walter Ogilby." "You are right, sister," replied he, in a serious tone; "he is a- favorite of mine, I must own. When my little niece comes up to visit us to-morrow, as she has promised, I will-tell her why. So now, good-by. Aunt Lany will be down to see you before evening." He saluted Ally with a kiss as before-shook hlands with the others, and departed. A considerable time elapsed before' it was announced that rooms above stairs were at length ready for the vis- itors. Ally had done her best to amuse her father, that he might not feel the necessity of his afternoon nap, and fall asleep in the draught of air, which, as the sun passed the meridian, began to move the grass on the lawn into waves, and to steal its way gently across the piazza. She found the refreshment of a change from her warm travelling-dress very grateful, and when she came down- stairs again, looking so fresh and pure in her simple white attire, and black pointed silk apron, her aunt exclaimed, in a tone of great satisfaction,- "How sweet and pretty you do look, Ally! Upon my word, you are very much like what I used to be at your age, only you are not so tall, and your eyes are darker. You may not think it sounds well for me to say it, but. I   WALTER OGILBY.         G1 was a great beauty in my day. Why, my dear I a young gentleman saw me across the church once and fell in love with me, when I was only fourteen years old. Sit down there, and I will tell you all about it." "No indeed, Aunty,"-Alice adopted the New England tone of endearment-Aunt Alida sounded too formal, and "Aunt Aulchy" was an abbreviation not quite to her taste,--"I cannot sit still while you are so busily employed. Let me wipe the glasses and place them on the shelves, while you sit here in your rocking-chair and -tell Ime the story at your ease." Aunt Aulchy thought this a very good arrangement, and- while Ally took her place among the vases and tum- blers, she went on with her customary prolixity. "Yes--I-will tell you all about that young gentleman. He saw me in church, as I told you, and fell in love with me, and came to my brother the next day-(I was wisiting at my brother's down in York at the time)-my brother Cornel'us-my Cornel'us is named after him-and so this young gentleman asked my brother's leave to pay atten- tion to me. My brother told him I was too young to think of such a thing, and besides, he had a wery particu- - lar friend, to whom he had promised me when I  grew older--provided I left the choice to him." "Which, of course, you would never have thought of doing," said Alice, her romantic sensibilities rising at the idea. "Oh!  if I had not happened to fall in love with your uncle, I dare say I should," replied Aunt Aulchy, tran- quilly. "But I was goih' to tell vou of another affair. One afternoon my sister and me were walkin' down near one of the wharves on the North River. You know the town then was not built up so close as it is now, and some of 6  &#xD;<pb n="62-63" xml:id="VAC7016-00000031"/> 62        WALTER OGILBY. our friends lived pretty near the water-side. Partly out of curiosity, and partly I suppose because we had no busi- ness there, girl-like, we must go walking down quite near the edge of one of the wharves, when one of imy shoe- buckles came loose and rolled right off into the river. You know we wore high-heeled shoes in those days, with gold or silver buckles in them. I said to my sister, I can't go without buckles in my shoes,-let us go over into Maiden Lane and buy a pair. There was a most beautiful jeweller's store a little way down Maiden Lane, where we always went when we wanted anything. Well, we went in, and there behind the counter, by the window, stood a young gentleman-oh! such a handsome young man! We asked for some shoe-buckles, and the clerk was going to show us some, when this gentleman stepped forward and pushed him away, and took out ever so many pairs of buckles, all of the richest kinds. There was one pair of diamond buckles-the handsomest diamond buckles. Ally, that you ever saw in your life." "Very likely," said Ally, laughing, "as I never saw a pair of shoe-buckles of any kind, except some old plated ones in a little drawer in grandmamma's desk." "Well-I only wanted a pair of plain silver buckles," continued her aunt, "but I could not help just asking the price of these diamond ones, they looked so beautiful 'Madam,' says the young gentleman, 'I have no price to put upon these buckles-if you will accept them, I shall consider myself the happiest of men.' 'Of course I was very much offended indeed, and put the buckles right down, and said I could not think of such a thing as accept- ing a present from a stranger ; but I bought a pair of silver buckles, and when he. had wrapped them up in a piece of white paper, I directed him where to send them to my brother's in Greenwich Street.'-   WALTER OGILBYe         63 "I should have walked out of the store at once, without making a purchase," said Ally, indignant at the young man's presumption. Aunt Aulchy took no notice. "Well, what -do you think? The very next day he called at my brother's-it seems he had found out who I was, and where I lived." Ally let this astonishing fact pass without comment. "He came," pursued her aunt, "with the diamond buckles in, his pocket--and oh I how he did beg and pray that I would havenhim; and he told my brother he would wait as many years as we chose, if I would only promise to have him in the end. But my brother advised me not to give him any encouragement. He said I could do better than to marry a jeweller; so the young man was dismissed. I felt wery bad and cried some, for he was as handsome as a picture, and so dreadfully in love." Alice had felt much interested in her aunt's story, and sympathized with the young man more than she had at first. intended; but she took it for granted that the love which was born in an hour, would not last a lifetime; and so she told her aunt. "Oh, yes!" said Aunt Aulchy, philosophically. "I dare say he got over it. I had quite a great deal of love-trouble before I married and settled down, and I always got over it." Tile glasses and china were all restored to their appro- priate places, before the master of the house returned. He seemed much surprised to find his niece wiping and ar- ranging  Gertrude's music-books, and laying the loose sheets in the drawers of the piano. "Well, welll" cried he, as he entered, "so they have set you'to work already, I This looks like New England. Girls are brought up as they should be there.

But our daughter has not been so well brought up. Her mother has waited on her, until she is too much of a fine lady to do anything for herself." The mother looked distressed. "Why, George! how can you talk so of your own daughter? Gitty's been away at school--I'm sure she could not learn housekeeping at Madame Lemoine's. And now she has got home, she ought to have a little comfort and enjoyment. I'm sure I had, at her age. Housekeepin and trottin' round is hard swork enough, when a body is obliged to do it. It would be too bad to put poor Gitty to it yet. " "Just as you please, my dear," responded the husband. "You think you have a hard time, and complain that the cares of life are killing you. I merely recommend that you should let your daughter aid you a little, but you know best. Come, are we to have dinner soon?" Ally went up-stairs to wake her father from his refresh- ing nap, and to provide him with whatever was necessary for his toilet, and by the time they both descended, dinner was awaiting them in the bare, desolate-looking dining- room. Aunt Aulchy had hastily made some very becoming alterations in her dress. A pretty lace cap trimmed wtth pink ribbons, and a gray striped silk dress set off her fir complexion and delicate bloom; and as the exercise she had taken through the day, together with the satisfaction she had found in her niece's sympathy and attentions, had given an additional lustre to her large, soft, blue eyes, Ally, as she looked at her, could readily believe the stories of the sudden and violent impression her beauty   WALTER  OGILBY.        65 had- produced, when in the fulness of its youthful perfec- tion. They had just risen from the table when the brisk step of the little doctor was heard in the hall. "Here we are. Walk in, Aunt Lany, and see your pretty niece, and don't be jealous if I lkiss her about once in half an hour. Ally, we had a young lady come to us once for a visit of three days, and I kissed her just forty- seven times before it was over-Aunt Lany counted. I just mention this, as we are to have the pleasure of your company to-morrow." "( Oh, doctor," exclaimed his wife, " how can you talk so, at random, and frighten Alice in this way? My dear, it is no such thing. He kissed Miss Adriance when she came and when she went away-that is all." "Well, I wanted to kiss her, and that is the same thing. The wish is as bad as the deed. Is not that your ethics, Aunt Aulchy?" "My what?" asked the good lady, looking puzzled. "I was only asking if you would take a drive with us. I have brought the carriage, for I observed that that very rude and ungallant Mr. Walter had not the civility to in- vite our little niece this morning, when he did her father; so I shall take her out myself, and make him feel just like jumping into the creek when he sees me. Comle, Aunt Aulchy, get your bonnet, and keep Aunt Lany company on the back seat." "Oh, dear! I wish I could go," said the poor lady in a pathetic tone; " but I don't dare to leave them girls. Don't you mind that I went up to your house once when we were a house-cleanin', and they broke my bedroom looking- glass-?

The very next day we got news that old Mrs. Storm, up at Middlebush, died that very day." "And so she would if you had not come up to our house. I attended her and kept her alive as long as I could. The old lady died because she could not help it, not because your bedroom glass was broken." "Well, but if I go away and leave them, they will not do any work," objected the careful housekeeper; " and we have got to have things ready for the men to cpme up from the Factory and tack down- the carpets' n the morning.7 "Never mind, my dear, never mind," said her husband. "I have some pamphlets, which I am going to sit down here and read, and I can give a tremendous shout now and then to Dinah and Libby and the rest of them, to keep them all going." Thus urged, Aunt Aulchy left the dining-room to make her preparations, and her niece followed her example. "It would be a very good plan to wait until papa is ready to take his drive, and then we could all go together," thought the latter; but as the idea seemed to occur to no one else, she would not propose to the doctor to delay his departure. "I suppose papa will sit with uncle until Mr. Ogilby calls for him," she ventured to say. "Ahl Ogcilby is coming for you, is he, brother?" said Mr. Ellsworth. "Well, he will show you the finest views that are to be found, and make himself agreeable into the bargain. I am glad hetought of the attention. So now, go, mother, and leavoie to keep house in your absence."   WTALTER  OGILBY.       67 CHAPTER VII.

She was a little Nan- tucket wonlan, who took a trip round in her brother's vessel to New York for once in her life, to see the world and the fashions, and to visit a cousin who kept a sort of Farmer's Hotel in Greenwich village. There, meeting good Farmer Van Vorst, who had come to the city with a drove of cattle, either his long limbs or his long purse took her fancy, as her education and gentility did his, and so he brought C  &#xD;<pb n="68-69" xml:id="VAC7016-00000034"/> 68       4WALTER OGILBY: her home to old Dutcheess to make butter and cheese.

She has resigned all her household cares into the hands of her two stout daugh- ters, while she sits and works collars for them, and has them and her son Lebbeus read story-books and poetry to her, when they've nothing else to do. So much for the Van Vorsts. "Now we are coming near Mr. Ogilby's place, down in the valley at the left: we begin to see the chimneys of the house. And those are his fields on the other side of the creek, stretching along at the foot of the mountain. - If I had been building, I would have placed my house over there, but Walter did not build--he bought the place, and made alterations and additions to suit him'. Now we begin to see the graperies and the gardens-he is a great gar- denler. Ah I there he is, in his gig, just coming up the lane. This is a new street he has cut, to make a hand- some approach to the house. See those fine weeping- willows drooping over the end of the piazza!" The doctor drew up for a moment that Ally might enjoy I the view, which from this point was verv fine, and the de- lay gave Mr. Ogilby time to come up. "We have got the start of you," cried the doctor; " but you drive such a fine horse that you can soon outstrip my poor nags. Being showman to a stranger, I have to pro- ceed moderately, and explain the country as I go through it. I have just got through doing you, and am ready to begin on Teuny Benthouse." And laughing heartily, he drove off at full speed, saying, "Master Walter will try to overtake us with his fine dapple-gray, but I do not think he will quite make it out." "Papa ought to lend himt Garry," said Ally, laughing; for she had caught the doctor's gay humor.   WALTER OGILBY.         69 "Pray who is Garry?" he asked. And in the height of her glee and enjoyment she gave a spirited account of their encounter with Mr. Ogilby on the preewding day, with, however, one or two slight omissions. Nobody was so well pleased as Aunt Aulchy. She laughed until the tears ran down her cheeks, as Miss Freelove and Farmer Van Tine passed in review, exclaiming, as the description finished,- !"I declare this ride will do me good. I have not felt so well I cannot tell when."' "Yes," said her brother-in-law. "I am happy to see that there is no danger of my being called out of my bed to-night to prescribe for a fit of the nerves, or a palpitation of the heart." "Oh, doctor!" remonstrated his wife. "Do not talk so. Ally will think you unfeeling." i"Unfeeling, because I rejoice that her presence is curing her aunt without my aid, or that of a certain little basket of phials and pill-boxes?" Aunt Aulchy looked grave. Her ailments were a sub- ject upon which she was rather tenacious. "It's wery seldom I get any pity,"' said she, with a sigh, ! " for the worse I am, the better I look." The doctor wisely changed the subject. "There, Ally, is Briar Lodge, where the Van Benthuy- sens live." "What a long name 1" said Ally. "Yes; but for shortness we call it Benthouse, as we call the Van Bunschotens 'Scoutens. Mr. Teunis, or as we say Teuny Benthouse, and his sister are two as-nice people as you'd meet on a summer's day, as my friend down at York says,-good people, not very young, but well-bred and sensible.

"Oh, brother! you must not forget our cousins, the Wanderwoorts," interposed Aunt Aulchy. "No, no: I shall not forget them. They live over there, Ally, on the other side of the creek. We have just passed the road leading down to the bridge. Nice girls they are,-four or five, I forget which,--capital girls-  built more for strength than beauty-won't wear out    i easily. And Garret their brother is a capital fellow. Then i there are their cousins, the Van Antwerps; sweet, pretty 0 girls, but not so rich as the others, with a nice father and mother. Indeed, Ally, we have first-rate fathers and mothers in this country." A short turn in the road now brought them in full view of the river. There lay the glorious Hudson, reflecting the gold and crimson hues of the western sky, and dotted -with the white-sailed sloops on their leisurely way to or from the great city at its mouth. Beyond, stretched the gentle slope on which reposed towns and villages, termin- ated by a distant blue chain to the north, while on the south rose verdant mountains, enclosing within their bosoms many a headland and one fair island now resting in shadow on the dark placid waters. The doctor stopped, for a few minutes, and pointed out the different objects of interest; the distant Catskills, and the little village of Klein Esopus, dear to Aunt Aulchy's  heart as the spot which contained, at this moment, her youngest son. At a few miles distance, on a beautiful peninsula, stood a residence which at once attracted their young visitor's attention. A broad lawn sloping to the water, and nearly surrounded by venerable trees, seemed the appropriate spot on which to have placed a quaint- looking mansion, whose peaked roof and broad, projecting   WALTER 'OGILBY.        71 piazzas spoke of that respectable period which Ally was accustomed to hear characterized as " before the war." "There, my dear, live the Van Nesses. Cultivated peo- ple they are; people of old-fashioned notions; people that know what is right and practice it; real old Knicker- bockers, in short. You will see them at church on Sun- day up at the village; for five or six, or even eight miles, do not keep our good people from church, nor from a tea- party either, for that matter. And when you see the Yan Nesses you will not wonder that Walter Ogilby likes them so well as he does." "I never could see why Walter Ogilby should take so much more to William Henry Van Ness than to my John Peter," said Mrs. Ellsworth, in an injured tone. "I am sure we were just as kind to him, and to his father and mother when they were poor and in distress, as ever the Van Nesses were. And now those two families are al- ways together, just as if they were blood relations; but if Walter Ogilby comes to our house, which is wery sel- dom, he is as formal and as stately as if he had just come into the country. I am sulre I was'perfectly astonished at his callin' in so unceremonious this mornin', and askin' brother William to ride with him this afternoon. And Gitty will be surprised too, for she has inwited and in- wited him, and I do believe this is the first time he ever broke bread in our house." The doctor gave a short, dry cough, but made no further reply to his sister-in-law, while Alice sat pondering and some- what perplexed, until it occurred to her that among the rea- sons for liking Walter Ogilby which the doctor had prom- ised to give her on the following day, there might be some clue to the mystery of the " poverty and distress" to which her aunt had alluded. As their drive had taken an extended circuit, it was al-  &#xD;<pb n="72-73" xml:id="VAC7016-00000036"/> 72        WALTER OGILBY. ready late, and Alice was beginning to feel some solicitude lest her father might not have carefully guarded himself against the dew which was, now falling, when, by a turn down the lane in front of Farmer Van Vorst's, they reached Milbank. They found the two elder gentlemen quietly discoursing together. "We saw you at a distance," said Mr. Morton, " and we should soon have overtaken you, but just as you had   turned inland from the river I began to feel a little chilly, i and Mr. Ogilby insisted on returning immediately.'"  "Very inconsiderate in him to be depriving me of the chance of a patient," said the doctor. "Perhaps he thought a physician's bill might not be al- together acceptable to a poor parson," said the clergyman, pleasantly. "He was not aware, probably, that I do not charge my particular friends for my services," said the doctor. "I use .them to nmake experiments upon. All the new lmedi- cines, that I have never yet tried, I practice with upon Aunt Aulchy first, to make sure that they are perfectly harmless." "Why, doctor!" exclaimed the poor lady, with a face of horror. "I will never send for you again as long as I live I But no: it is no such thing. You always come and ask me what I've been a taklin'; and, when I tell you 'a little valerian tea, or 'a little magnesia,' you always say 'that is just right-go on with the same treatment ;' and, now I think of it, I never take your medicines at all." The doctor laughed heartily at the fright he had given his poor sister, and so did her husband, both equally un- nloved by the gentle reproofs of Mrs. Hardenberg; and, soon after, the two travellers were left to the repose they so much needed.   WALTER OGILBY.         73 Ally's room was at the back of the house, with a view, from its casement window, over mountain, valley, and rush- ing stream. Beautiful as she had found the landscape in the light of declining day, it seemed to possess an added charm when, on the following morning, she beheld it bathed in the brilliance of the early, sunshine, and the glittering dew-drops. Involuntarily she joined the matin- song of the birds in a verse from her favorite morning hymn, so low, she thought, as not to disturb another with the sound. A tap at the door ere long interrupted her. Silvy's round, shining black face appeared. "Please, ma'am, missus says, don't sing afore breakfast; she's afraid the cat'll catch ye." And Silvy vanished in high glee. Ally contented herself with repeating the verses in a tone so low as she was sure would arouse none of her aunt's superstitious fears She was met, as she descended to the empty parlor, by her kind-hearted relative. Late rising was not one of Aunt Aulchy's forms of self-indulgence. "My dear," began she, "I hope you did not feel hurt that I sent Silvy to stop you; but, you know, if you sing before you eat, you'll cry before you sleep." "We always sing before we eat at home," said Ally, as she gave her aunt he; morning kiss, " and yet, aunty, we very seldom cry." "Do you?" said her aunt, with an incredulous look. "Oh yes, that reminds me, we must have prayers while your father is here. We ought to have one or two prayer- books somewhere; if I only knew where to find them. But everything is in such a muss I I suppose a Heidel- berg Catechism would not do as well? I always keep one on my bureau. I'll send in Gitty's drawers and closet, and see if they can find a prayer-book." 7  &#xD;<pb n="74-75" xml:id="VAC7016-00000037"/> 74       }WALTER OGILBY. "Don't give yourself that trouble, aunty. Papa and I have our own books, and I dare say Uncle George can recollect the service. We shall do very well." No servants were summoned after Mr. Morton made his appearance.' Family worship was a thing so unknown in that domestic circle, that the proper and reverent observ- ance of it was by no means understood. The women engaged in house-cleaning in the adjoining apartments were not admonished to lay aside their work, or even to pursue it quietly. There was the same loud speech and careless laugh, the same clatter of pails and moving of furniture, as if no minister of-God were lifting up his voice in prayer and thanksgiving within hearing of the ear which chose to listen. On the breakfast-table, which was abundantly covered with good things (for Aunt Aulchy did not understand washing-day or house-cleaning dinners and breakfasts), was a dish of hard-boiled eggs. It was something new to Ally to see these cut in slices and dressed like a salad, and her surprise was not diminished on observing that six or eight-of them were considered a ration which one person might dispose. When her uncle laid foul upon her plate, she thought it was as a joke, and only discovered her mistake when he exclaimed,-- "Come, come, Ally! I thought yo u had too much good sense to be playing the fine lady, and pretending not to Lb able to eat your allowance. Why, look at your Aunt Aulchy! My dear, how many eggs did you eat for luncheon that day we took a ride up to Hopewell?" "I don't remember," was the reply. "I was so terribly sick while I was there, and all the next day, that I forget about the luncheon. Ridin' so far at a time never does agree with me. If it had not been for the eggs, I think I could not have stood it at all. I should have been quite laid up."   WALT'ER OGILB Y.        75 Mr. Ellsworth paid his brother-in-law the compliment to lay aside some not very pressing business, in order to drive him and Ally to the doctor's residence, and to stay and dine with them, merely employing the half-hour be- fore dinner in calling upon an acquaintance in the neigh- borhood, and excusing himself, on the plea of an engage- ment elsewhere, as soon as the company had left the table and returned to the drawing-room. Mrs. Hardenberg was as unlike Mrs Ellsworth as a sister could well be. Sensible, quiet, judicious, fond of reading and of reflecting on what she had read, she was a rational and agreeable companion. She entertained Mr. Morton after dinner with a description of some of the odd families living in the mountains, and interested him with an ac- count of the efforts made by herself and a few others to humanize them, and bring them under some sort of' re- ligious culture. The doctor seized this opportunity to draw Ally off to a small conservatory, opening from his library, to show her, as he said, a daphne odora that he had just received. "I did not bring you here exactly for that," said he, when she had sufficiently admired it. "I said something yester- day about giving you my reasons for thinking so highly as I do of your young acquaintance, Mr. Ogilby. I should not have thought it necessary, under ordinary circumstances, to do this, for you have discernment enough, I doubt not, to find out the merits of people in due time. But your Cousin Gitty has taken a most unaccountable dislike to this young man' She has had it for years in fact. I know she will do all in her power to prejudice you against him; or, if she cannot succeed in that, she will contrive matters so that you will seem to share her feelings.

In order that the reader may also understand, and that he may be introduced more fully to an acquaintance with our hero, we will go back further into his history than did the good doctor in his conversation wfith his young guest. CHAPTER VIII. FORTY years before the commencement of our story, that is to say, at a period a little subsequent to the War of the Revolution, another Mr Walter Ogilby had left his home in Scotland, to find one in the United States. Many circumstances concurred to urge him to this step. His father had, after his two children--a daughter and a son-had reached the age of maturity, grieved them by marrying a second time, and his choice had fallen upon a person some years younger than themselves. This step would naturally have created a disarrangenment of the quiet domestic circle; but to add to the disparity, the lady was of a rank a little above that of her husband, and belonged to a family which, though comparatively poor, was both ambitious and extravagant. The personal advantages of the bridegroom had sufficed to the lady-his inherited paternal estate, and the consideration of her being one of a large family of portionless daughters, secured the reluctant consent of her connections. The world was easily reconciled to the propriety of the step, but not so the son and daughter; and the distaste of   WALTER OGIILBY].        " the two latter was still further increased by the total change which the new relation into which their father had entered, brought about in the domestic establishment. Where once had reigned order, sobriety, and a certain de- gree of thrift and management suitable to the modest posi- tion of the family, were now to be seen festivity, profusion, troops of friends titled and untitled,-everything, in short, which might mark a contempt of old ways, and a determi- nation to revolutionize to the most insignificant point in the household economy. Mr. Walter Ogilby and his sister were cpnscientious and right minded people, they were clear-sighted too, for no blandishments were used to obscure their mental vision; and however filial duty might prompt them to judge leni- ently the infatuation of their father, they could not but foresee a speedy and disastrous termination to the career he had now entered upon. Some hints, even a few remon- strances the young gentleman ventured to use, but they were ill received and of course unavailing. A part of the \   family estate was entailed, and could not be alienated ; but ;   as time went on, portion after portion of that which the    father had a right to control, was made away with, to satisfy the demands which the new order of things brought in constant succession upon him. Mr. Qgilby, the younger, was in the habit of taking counsel with his sister in all his troubles and perplexities. Her calm good sense and experience (she was two years his senior) often su^ggested a remedy for evils which he had considered hopeless. "What can be done," said he to her, "to change a state of things which seems to grow worse and worse every hour of our lives?" "It cannot be changed, brother; that is a hope that I have long relinquished; but it may be provided against. 'We 7*  &#xD;<pb n="78-79" xml:id="VAC7016-00000039"/> 7 8       }FWALTER OGILBEY can do as so many others are doing-we can go to America, and begin life for ourselves. We can earn our own living. It is something that must be done sooner or later." "And leave our father? Give him up into the hands of those who are selfishy leading him on to ruin?" "He has given us up," said Miss Janet, mournfully. "We are nothing to him now. The time may come, must come, when we shall be something to him. It is that we may succor our father in his declining years, that I say let us go to America. "He may yet have a large family of sons and daughters to add to the burden that is already pressing upon him. I could work for this babe that he now has, I could work for its mother, for she is a poor, innocent young creature and but does as she is guided. Pity that she would not listen to those who are no summer friends I Let us go together and provide against the evil day that is hanging over our father." The plan was discussed and matured, A small inherit- ance received from their mother would be sufficient for whatever outlay might be necessary, and as their father, when consulted, offered no obstacles, it was settled that they should take passage in the first vessel sailing from Greenock. But Providence ordered their affairs differently from what they had themselves planned. The stepmother, never robust, took a sudden cold, the effects of which were so serious that her life was despaired of. It was then that Miss Janet proved herself indeed "no summer friend." The entreaties of the helpless young creature who now clung to her rather as a daughter than as a mother, with a stronger reliance on her disinterested tenderness than upon the fitful attentions of her own flesh and blood, her pathetic appeals to her to remain and be a mother to her little S             "   '          .    Robert from whom she felt that she was soon to be separ- ated, outweighed the claims of the elder brother, and the proposed emigration of the sister was, for the present, given up. Mr. Walter Ogilby proceeded alone to his new home, and soon settled himself in Boston, where he ere long found means to embark his little property and that of his sister in a business slowly but surely prosperous. The stepmother lingered on, for two or three years, gradually resigning herself and her infant to the charge and comforting care of the daughter she had once so under- valued, until, at length, she was released from sorrow and suffering. The father, worn with grief, harassed with debts, and soured by disappointment at the heartlessness and treach- ery of the new friends whom he had adopted, did not long survive her, and Miss Janet and the young Robert was left to comfort each other, when the latter was little more than five years old. The business in which Mr. Walter Ogilby had engaged did not yield immediately large returns, and the necessity which he laid upon himself of remitting year by year a sum sufficient for his sister's expenses, and for supplying to his parents during their lifetime such indulgences as they had no longer in their own power, obliged him to restrict him- self to the most limited expenditure compatible with the appearance of a gentleman. Frugality is seldom distaste- ful to one of his nation, particularly where it is recom- mended by the stern convictions of duty; it is not sur- prising therefore that year after year passed by without a single addition to the circle of his acquaintance beyond those with whom business compelled an intercourse,-his minister and the inmates of his landlady's family. Thus he grew austere in his feelings and manners, stern and un-    &#xD;<pb n="80-81" xml:id="VAC7016-00000040"/> 80        WALTER OGILB Y compromising in the fulfilment of his own duty, and rigid in exacting the like from others. The person in whose family he had, almost at the out- set, established himself, was a lady the wife of a country, man of his own, whose fortunes had been so much preju- diced by the vicissitudes of the war, that at her husband's death, which occurred soon after its close, slSe had'found herself under the necessity of relying on her own exertions for the maintenance of a large family of children. Some friends of Mr. Elliott, her late husband, had aided her in renting and furnishing a suitable house in a neighborhood convenient to the important shipping merchants, and in securing such inmates as would be desirable in her deso- late and unprotected situation. She was now well estab- lished, and her children were growing up around her with a prospect of receiving, at least, such an education as would enable them to make their way in the world. The youngest of the family, who war but a babe when her father died, was still a little child when Mr. Ogilby became a member of the family. As' years went on, it   ] was occasionally remarked that she was the only living thing which had power to bring a genial smile upon his countenance. He would speak pleasantly to his fellow- boarders, politely to Mrs. Elliott, whom he met three times a day at the head of the table, but it was only when little Maggie met him in the hall, or called to him with some engaging infantine remark, that his heart seemed to open, and feelings long pent up to 'gush forth in a stream of tenderness. It had been his plan to bring his sister and his little brother to live with him in his adopted home; but the involved state of his father's affairs, the strict sense of justice which dictated that the smallest demand against the estate should be paid, and his perfect reliance on the   WALTER OGILBY.         81 energy and business capacity of his sister, to whom his affairs in his own country were confided, had combined to render expedient her longer continuance in her native home. She had, consequently, remained in the old mansion, managing the farm and superintending the education of her -Iyoung brother, aided only by such advice and suggestions as the elder could occasionally send her across the water. Thus matters went on for a number of years. His estate was released from all encumbrance, success in busi- ness was adding largely to his store, and if Mr. Ogilby had any purpose in life, to the accomplishment of which health, wealth, and a good name were essential, the world would have declared that at length it could not fail of being realized. As before, death stepped in to modify whatever plans he might have formed. Suddenly, in the midst of her usefulness, Miss Janet Ogilby was calledl to receive the reward of long years of disinterested sacrifice and patient fulfilment of duty, and young Robert Ogilby was left solely to his brother's care and guardianship. His ma- ternal relatives had long ceased to concern themselves about him, nor did they now come forward to offer hinm sympathy or protection until such time as his brother could come to Scotland and make arrangements for the future. This was not so easy a matter at that day as at present; but Mr. Ogilby accomplished it with his custom- ary dispatch and business-like precision. The voyage was made, the family affairs adjusted, the family mansion rented on a longt lease, and Robert Ogilby, who had now reached the age of sixteen, and who, under the careful supervision of his exemplary sister, had received thus far an-excellent education, was transferred to a new home to make friends for himself, where his silent and reserved brother had made few for him. / ,I  &#xD;<pb n="82-83" xml:id="VAC7016-00000041"/> 82        WALTER OGILBY: In the mean time, Margaret Elliott had grown from an attractive child into a pretty young school-girl, and year by year had she also grown more and more into the heart of the grave and taciturn Mr. Walter Ogilby. His separation from his native land, his early disappointments, his unre- mitting pursuit of wealth, whether solely from a principle of duty, or'because, as is too often the case, the stimulus of success was essential to his happiness, the weight of care pressing upon him for successive years, all had contributed to close his heart to the claims of society, to every in- terest, save of duty or compassion. Yet, amid all this, to little Margaret his heart had turned, as that of the pris- oner to the one ray of sunshine that enters his dungeon. He was fond of music; but it was a gratification which he had systematically denied himself. For years he had enjoyed it only in the worship of his own church, until one Sunday evening, when he lieard, for the first time, the sound of Magrgie's voice, as, seated in her mother's apart- ment, she sang with her a hymn to his favorite tune- Dundee.                          i, He had never intruded into Mrs. Elliott's parlor; but  U now the impulse was irresistible. With a tap at the door, he begged permission to enter and listen until the hymn was concluded.  Another and another followed at his re- quest. He was carried back to the days of his childhood, when the voices of home joined in a sweet chorus, and for the first time in many years the stern nature was melted to tears. "Do you never sing yourself, Mr. Ogilby?" asked little Margaret. ".I used to sing once, at my mother's knee, as you are doing now, my  child."' "Then let us practice together."   WA L TEG  U C 1LB Y.     83      ii ' By degrees her sweet voice tempted him to join in the    l old familiar strains, and her mother did not reprove her,1 when she invited Mr. Ogilby to " come always into their  little parlor before the Sunday evening service, and sing   iJ a few psalms and hymns with her."               ili It cannot be doubted that, in a warm and' loving heart   lt like Margaret's, a strong affection sprang up toward one who, she could not fail to perceive, felt a deep interestil in her; and it will surprise no one that for two or three   i years before Mr. Ogilby's visit to Scotland they hadfbeen  !J the best of friends. All the gentlemen who composed her mother's family     i made Christmas and birthday presents to Maggie; but      ji from -no one were such valuable books received as from    1'i her quiet friend; and, certainly, no other remembered tot question her as he did upon what she had read, to advise   I, her in the choice of her books, and to explain to her whatever she found in them beyond her childish corn-       prehension.                          O '- .ili There might be those who imagined that, in all this,    i3 Mr. Ogilby was seeking to recommend!himself to the      1il mother; but, if so, they were wise enough to keep their surmises to themselves, and neither wound the dignity ofl the lady, nor arouse the anger of the gentleman, by giving ilJ them utterance.                       !; Mr. Ogilby, whose knowledge and taste in music hadi  been well cultivated in his early years, ventured at length to make some suggestions to Mrs. Elliott on the subject    Ill' of suitable instruction for her daughter.           I "I would gladly have her taught instrumental music," was the reply; "but I cannot yet think it right to incur' the expense of a piano for her. I must, in the first place, provide her and the others with a living, in case I should be taken away from them."  in  &#xD;<pb n="84-85" xml:id="VAC7016-00000042"/> 84        WALTER OGILBY. "But if you give her a musical education, such as her fine powers justify, you prepare her to make her own living, should the necessity arise." The argument seemed conclusive. A piano was ac- cordingly hired, and a teacher engaged for Margaret. When Mr. Ogilby was about taking his departure for his native land, his parting words were,- "Maggie, will you learn to sing 'Alloa House'for me before I return?"                    i "Yes, indeed, if you wish it," was her earnest reply. "Don't you know I had rather please you than anybody else in the world?-except mamma," added she, correcting herself. Maggie kept her word. She sang the promised song for her friend and his young brother the first evening of their arrival from Scotland; and great were her astonish- ment and delight to find herself rewarded with a fine piano, which Mr. Ogilby had brought her from his own country. Mrs. Elliott very naturally hesitated to accept so valua- ble a present for her daughter. "Madam," said Mr. Ogilby, "I have not lived so long under your roof without foreseeing that my orphan brother will receive a mother's kindness from you. Do not, by refusing my present, treat me as a stranger, and force me to seek relatives for him elsewhere." It was impossible to decline any longer.   WALTER OGILBY.         85 CHAPTER    IX. POOR Robert Ogilby was far from realizing the glowing visions he had indulged in, of a life in the New World. Accustomed from his earliest years to the tender care of his sister Janet, who had watched over him with a mother's love, or to the gentle sway of the good minister whose pupil he had been, he had hitherto known only the voice of kindness. His disposition, like his mother's, was affectionate and yielding, so that, having been a favorite with his young companions, he had grown up without con- flict to harden, or opposition to make him stubborn. Now he was transplanted to a warehouse, to take his place among rough men and boys; to listen to harsh lan- guage; to witness occasionally personal severity; and to feel the influence of a contact'with sailors, porters, dray- men, negroes-every class of subordinates which the ex- tensive business of his brother put in requisition. Under the care of an experienced head-clerk, he was soon initiated into the particular duties assigned him, which were rather a supervision of others employed than a sys- tematic routine of labor. But to hIs astonishment he found that he was expected to be perfect at once--that no allow- ances were to be made for inexperience or forgetfulness- no excuse accepted for failures or omissions, such as occa- sionally seemed unavoidable. His brother was his master, and he was nothing more. NTo meed of approbation re- warded his most successful endeavor to fulfil the task assigned him. He had but done his duty-why should he be praised? 8  &#xD;<pb n="86-87" xml:id="VAC7016-00000043"/> 86        WALTER OGILBY. If, amid a multiplicity of calls upon his attention, one item chanced to be overlooked, the stern, formal "Sir, did you not know that this was a point vou were expected to attend to?" and the lightning glance of his brother's eyes conveyed the reproof to which he 'had hitherto been a stranger. 'In Mr. Ogilby's rounds, to visit all belonging to him at a late hour on a cold winter's night, he would stop at his brother's cllamber-door. "Are the shutters in the upper west loft carefully bolted?" " I think so, sir." "You think, sir! Did you not see to it personally, yourself?" "I looked at them yesterday, and no one has been in that part of the building since." "Be so good as to rise, sir, at once, and satisfy yourself that all is right." Such discipline would have been little to complain of; it would doubtless in time have made a regular, method- ical business-man of the petted boy; but the absence of all sympathy, of all apparent affection, made popr Robert often wish he could lay his head beside the peaceful pillow of his beloved sister Janet. And this was the brother whom he had been brought up so to love and reverence!-whose fraternal kindness and nobleness of heart had been the untiring theme of their departed sister!-whose letters, breathing the tender- est solicitude, had been expatiated on as a solace in every hour of trouble and perplexity!--to whose sheltering care he had looked to supply the place of all that he had been bereaved of I The feelings of grief, almost of despair, which such a disappointment occasioned would in time have deprived him of all ambition to please, but for one cheering ray amid the gloom-the warm sunlight in the bosom of Mrs. Elliott's family.                '   WA LTER OGILBY.        87 The half-hour allotted him at each meal was the one succeeding that on which his brother had taken his. Mrs. Elliott, with motherly penetration, had observed that, however deep the solicitude and watchful the care of Mr. Ogilby for his young brother, it was a part of his system not only to repress the slightest' manifestation of affection, but also to confirm in him the idea that an inex- orable judge was watching his every action, to detect a possible transgression or delinquency. It was in woman's nature to use every endeavor to sup- ply to the friendless youth the tenderness which he failed to receive from any other source; and in this her son George, who, as clerk in a neighboring store, took his meals at the same time with Robert, joined his best efforts. Margaret too, at such time as her mother's avocations carried her to some other part of the establishment, often took her place at the table, and exerted all her powers to make Robert's brief period of relaxation pass cheerfully, if not merrily. With what longing did he learn to look forward to this short, respite three times each day! How did it enable him to bear the toils and perplexities, the reproofs and the harshness of his daily experience! On Sundays he took his place at table with the other boarders. In' the pleasant twilight of those sacred days, how did his heart yearn to join the little singing-circle in Mrs. Elliott's parlor! But no; at an admonition from his brother, he must withdraw to his own room at the ware- house; to read his Bible, and other good books, until the hour for evening service. Such was Robert Ogilby's life, year after year. In their half-hours of pleasant intercourse, he and Mar- garet talked much together; first of books and music, of his country and early life, and of his dear sister Janet;  &#xD;<pb n="88-89" xml:id="VAC7016-00000044"/> 88         A L TER O GIL B Y. afterwards they began to talk of other things, but it was a whispered word when none was by, telling of all that passed in the heart of each when absent from the other. Sometimes the tea was left untasted or forgotten, while they hastily sang together a song of old Scotia, "Will ye gang to the Ewe-bughts, Marion?" or "Thro' the- Wood, Laddie," or while Robert repeated a snatch of somr bal- lad or legend in which they saw painted their own trials -their own ultimate happiness. No one knew or sus- pected all this, except George Elliott; and he looked on, i as young people are apt to do, with sympathy and appro- bation. The mother, as was the custom with parents at that day, governed her family strictly, and loved them tenderly, but neither gave them nor required from them the confidence of a friend. At length the day approached when Robert would be one-and-twenty: it was a few weeks before Margaret's eighteenth birthday. He had looked forward to this period with impatience, for then he should be his own master- there would be no more subserviency, no more conceal- ment. On the day preceding it his brother met him with his usual stateliness, requesting that he would report himself at his office for an interview on the following morning. No other change took place in the usual routine; but when he and Margaret met at the tea-table, it was with hearts too full for words-hearts bounding with anticipations of what the coming day was to bring. At the appointed hour Robert waited on his brother. The manner of the latter was somewhat less stern and cold than usual. Motioning his brother to a seat near him, Mr. Ogilby began,- ' Robert, you have now served me five years, and I am happy to be able to say that, for the most part, you   WALTER   OGIBIF:.      89 have served me well. You have not, I think, found me ni-ggardly toward you. I have wished to provide you with the means of always exercising the liberality becom- ing a gentleman and a Christian. The effect of trade is to make men sordid, and that I have aimed to guard you against. But you have perhaps thought me severe,--too little indulgent. It- was because I saw in you some faults of character which I wished to correct. You were too gentle,-too yielding in your disposition. Under the dis-, cipline you have received, distasteful as it may have been at the time, you have learned firmness, you are no longer in danger of beinfg imposed upon, of being influenced to give up what your judgment and your conscience tell you is right. I think you have overcome that unfortunate pliancy of temper which was your natural inheritance, and can now go forth into the world to take your place and maintain your position among men. Here,"' placing a check in his hand, " is the value of your portion of our father's estate. As eldest son I inherit the whole; but I regard the law of primogeniture as unjust. You were his child as well as I; there should be no distinction: there- fore I give you simply what equity demands " The young man was for a moment speechless with astonishment. "But, brother," said he, at length, "my education, my maintenance, all have been at your charge I I am not en- titled to this i" "Our sister's little property, which through me she in- vested, has more than supplied these expenses," said Mr. Ogilby; "There is still a portion of it untouched, which she wished you to have. Now, if you require any advice, if you' have formed plans in which imy aid or counsel can be of service to you, you will always find me ready to give them." 8*  &#xD;<pb n="90-91" xml:id="VAC7016-00000045"/> 90       }WALTER OGILBY. Robert's heart was touched. He took his brother's hand. "Let me thank you, brother," said he, with emotion, "for all your care-for all your kindness. You have been a father to me. I will hide nothing from you. Yes, I have formed plans. Your unexpected generosity-for generosity I feel it to be-puts it in myv power to realize the dream of years,-to make Margaret Elliott my wife." Mr. Walter Ogilby bounded to his feet, and his brother stood aghast at the fearful expression of his pale. counte- j nance as it glared upon him. "Margaret Elliott! Young man, are you beside your- self? What do you know of Margaret Elliott? You can scarcely have seen her three times in a year. What boy's fancy is this? Margaret Elliott is to be your sister, not your wife/ I have her mother's promise, and I have her love. She belongs to me by every right; and do you talk of-taking her from me?"  "Brother," said Robert, when he could command him-   ji self sufficiently to speak, " there is some dreadful mistake! Margaret loves me, and none but me. We have waited but for this day to make it known to her mother and to you. She never has dreamed," added he, passionately, " of any one's love but mine. For years we have lived on the certainty of being all the world to each other. You do not say you have her promise-you could not say that: you have only her mother's assurance that she loves you. Oh! if her mother has so deceived you, what a fearful reckoning will come to her I! Brother, forgive me--every- thing else in the world I can give up-but do not ask ime this." Mr. Ogilby made (n effort to be calm, and soon suc- ceeded in resuming something of his usual manner. "Robert,' said he, "you talk of years I What are the   -WALTER OGILBY.         91 years that you have loved&amp; or, rather fancied you loved, Margaret Elliott, compared with those in which I have treasured her? Since she was a little child, she has been dearer to me than all the world beside. She knows how I have loved her; she understands my affection, and she returns it. Do not deceive yourself. I nee d not say how sincerely I regret that you have done so. It will be poor comfort now, to tell you that you will soon find one per- haps more charming, to bani'sh Margaret's image. At your age the affections are not formed and enduring; the imagination predominates, and is ever capricious and un- reliable. Put aside, then, this boyish fancy; for, I repeat, a fancy only it can be. Be a man, Robert. Go to Mrs. Elliott, and, ijf you choose, talk the matter over with her. She will show you how things stand, and reason you into a right view of matters better than I can. Margaret's own good sense, too, will help to cure you." Mr. Ogilby had full proof of the success of his system of discipline, in giving his young brother's character what it had once lacked of firmness and resolution. "This is not a matter, sir, to bandy words about," was the reply. "God grant that you may have it less at heart than I have, for I tell you that Margaret Elliott can marry no man on earth but me, while I have life and breath. Do not talk to me of giving her up. She is mine, and all the world shall not tear her from me."' So saying, he quitted his brother's presence, leaving behind him on the table the check he had just before received. "Poor boy!" said Mr. Ogilby, looking after him; " wil- ful and unreasonable, like his weak mother I What could Margaret mean, to let such thoughts get into his head? Has there really been any nonsense between them?

"What does it all mean? Oh, Margaret, what can it mean?1" "I cannot tell," was the reply. "I looked up to your brother as to a father; I never dreamed of his regarding me otherwise than as a child--of his wishing to marry me! If he has talked of such a thing with mamm , she has kept it carefully from me. Let us find out the worst at once." Mrs. Elliott, when questioned by her almost distracted child, could not disguise the truth. She was forced to ad- mit that she had indeed promised Mr. Ogilby that Mar- garet would become his wife; that she had made him be- lieve that he would be her daughter's choice, when she should be of a proper age to make one. She had not in- tended to deceive him, buts she had allowed her wishes in the case to govern her judgment; and, from having long contemplated the advantages of the match, she had come to believe that it would accord-with her daughter's feelings as heartily as it did with her own. She had been blind to the growing affection of Robert and Margaret. She knew that they were good friends, but supposed their sen-  timents toward each other to be merely those of sympathy . on the one side, and gratitude on the other. Her two eld- i est daughters having married young men in a position in I life which condemned them to struggles and sacrifices, she t believed that she was securing the happiness of the young- est by promoting her union with a man of fortune, worth, and education. The disparity of age, she had flattered her- self, would be a very unimportant consideration. So it was that for years this plan had been in agitation. They were only waiting until Margaret should reach her eighteenth birthday before Mr. Ogilby should speak for himself. /       WALTETR OGILBY.        93 What was now to be done?   Robert and Margaret were equally resolute, and equally wretched. Mrs. Elliott had no wish to mar, her daughter's happiness, which she saw was bound up in a union with Robert; but if she should consent to their immediate marriage, how was she to meet Mr. Walter Ogilby, the friend of fifteen years, who would now find himself so miserably deceived? Though sorely grieved and disappointed, she could not blame the young people, and her chief anxiety now was to do what was best for the peace of all parties. Her son George was summoned to the council. "Let them run away and get married," was his advice. "I would do so in their place. As for staying to face Mr. Ogilby's grim looks, that is what Maggie cannot do, nor Robert neither. You have your good friend in Provi- dence, Robert, Mr. Nelson, who thinks so much of you. He will give you a situation. I can help you a little at- the outset; and it will be no harder for mother to main- tain Maggie for a year or two, as your wife, than it has been heretofore. With your abilities and business knowl- edge, you will soon be doing well for yourself." Robert explained the provision made for him by his sister's legacy, as well as what his brother had proposed to make over to him from the estate. "The former is unquestionably my own," he said, "and I should have no scruple in using it. The other I could never touch." There were many tears and many misgivings while dis- cussing George's suggestions. The fear that, if he did not secure his bride at once, his brother might after all come in to snatch her from him, entirely inclined Robert to the plan proposed. Mrs. Elliott, who believed that its adoption would secure her from some of the blame which she felt to be '/  &#xD;<pb n="94-95" xml:id="VAC7016-00000047"/> "       WALTER OGILBY. justly her due, gave it no opposition. Margaret alone was brave and resolute, and counselled delay, but finally suffered herself to be persuaded that an immediate mar- riage was perhaps the best thing under the circum- stances'. "But, mamma," said she, "promise me that you will explain all to Mr. Ogilby. Tell him that you had never breathed a word to me on the subject of his wishes. Tell him that I do love him dearly,-that, if he will let me, I will be a daughter to himll, and take care of him to the i end of my days; but, oh, I could never, never be his wife!" George accompanied his sister and Robert to the little North End Church, and having reimbursed the clergyman for the fine which would fall upon him for celebrating a marriage without having published the bans, he saw the young couple seated in a carriage, and on their way to Providence, beforetMr. Ogilby walked home to dinner.  CHAPTER    X. THE agitation and distress occasioned by the recent scenes prevented Mrs. Elliott fronm appearing, as washher custom, at the head of her dinner-table; but no one would have observed that there was an unusual weight on the mind of Mr. Ogilby, as he sat until the last guest had departed. He then sought Mrs. Elliott in her little parlor. She was waiting to receive him, trembling with apprehension, for she doubted not that the heaviest of the blame would,   WALTER OGILBY.         95 as it ought, fall upon her. She began to realize the evils that her own want of judgment, as well as her want of openness, had prepared for those near and dear to her. "Where is Margaret?" was Mr. Ogilby's first inquiry. "Slhe is not at home," faltered her mother. Mr. Ogilby looked searchingly at her. "Where is my brother Robert?" Unable to bear the suspense, and thinking it perhaps better to come to the point at once, though only half re- solved to tell the whole truth, Mrs. Elliott answered, bursting into tears,- "Gone with Margaret." There was no need to say more. Mr. Ogilby took a seat, for he had not power to remain standing. After a few minutes' silence he said,-- "You knew of their departure, I conclude?" "Yes. I would gladly have prevented it; that is--.I wished it otherwise. Oh, Mr. Ogilby, believe me, never till this morning did I dream of an attachment--" "We will speak no more of it," said Mr. Ogilby, rising. "It cannot now be helped. Good afternoon, madam." "But, Mr. Ogilby, stay,-let me explain. Margaret wished me-"  She hesitated-she had not the courage to go on. "Explanations would not change matters," replied Mr. Ogilby. '"Let the subject remain buried in silence for the future. I have borne disappointment, and can still bear it. I had no right to expect otherwise. Farewell!" As he quitted her, Mrs. Elliott said to herself, "After a few days, when he is calmer, it will be a better time to set the matter right with-him."' And she suffered him to depart, convinced of Margaret's perfidy and of the base ingratitude of his brother. The same evening a porter came for Mr. Ogilby's trunks  &#xD;<pb n="96-97" xml:id="VAC7016-00000048"/> 96        WALTER OGILBY. and other effects. A note had just before been handed to Mrs. Elliott. It contained these words: "MADAM,-I will not, by continuing under your roof, be the means of keeping your daughter and son-in-law from you. Accept my thanks for the kindness of many years, and my best wishes for your happiness. Will you do me the favor to transmit the inclosed 'to its propel direction, and oblige, "Yours,   WALTER OGILBY." The inclosure was addressed to Robert. On opening it, he found it to contain a check for eight thousand dollars, in those days no inconsiderable sum; together with a cer- tificate of deposit of his sister's legacy with a banker in the city,-and the following lines: "The within are your own property. I prefer that they should not be left on my hands.  "W. OGILBY."  - Robert had, before receiving this letter, written to his brother, to excuse the step he had taken; to represent to him how impossible it would have been for Margaret to have become his wife; how completely they had been kept in ignorance of any plan to that effect, and, without throw- ing the entire blame where alone it was due, striving to exculpate himself from any charge of selfishness or ingrati- tude. No notice was taken of his letter.  As Mrs. Elliott never found the courageous moment to seek an explanation with Mr. Ogilby and take upon her- self the censure she deserved, the latter gave no credit to his brother's representations, but only entertained the con- viction that one who could act treacherously, would find little difficulty in writing falsely. With the capital at his command, Robert Ogilbv estab- ...................... : . . . .  w- .:    WALTER OGILBY.           97 lished himself in the City of Providence, and in the course of time became a wealthy and prosperous merchant. After the birth of his eldest son, to whom he gave his brother's name, he ventured one more effort toward a reconciliation, through the intervention of a mutual friend, but with as little success as before. The manufacturing mania which seized so many New England capitalists about the time of the last war with Great Britain, was not slow in taking possession of George Elliott and Robert Ogilby. They embarked together all their fortune, now very considerable, in an enterprise in- volving an outlay all the greater that neither of the prin- cipals had more than a theoretical knowledge of the busi- ness which was to bring them a golden harvest. The peace came. It brought blessings to many, but to some it brought ruin, and Robert Ogilby was among the latter number. He struggled on for awhile, collecting the shattered remnants of his fortune, and striving to make a new beginning in which he might avail himself of the ex- perience he had already gained. It was at this time that Mr. Ellsworth, who was on a visit to Providence with a view of acquiring all the information necessary to enable him to carry out his own manufacturing plans on a more extended scale, became acquainted with Mr. Ogilby, and made him such offers as induced him to remove with his family to Milbank. Although Robert and Margaret had enjoyed many years of prosperity and comparative happiness, yet the remem- brance of their lonely, and, as they feared, unhappy brother, had always been a bitter drop in their cup. To their in- quiries of Mrs. Elliott, in their occasional visits to Boston, the unvarying answers had been, " that he never came to see hex, nor did she chance to meet him,"-that "in their first and only conversation in regard to what had taken place, 9 r             e       &#xD;<pb n="98-99" xml:id="VAC7016-00000049"/> 98        WALTER OGILBY. he had said, 'it could not be helped, explanations could not alter the matter,' '-that "he had seemed to take his dis- appointment very philosophically," and that "everybody said he was as much engaged as ever in increasing his already splendid fortune." Robert had gone more than once to the Old South Church, in hopes of an accidental meeting; but his brother had probably seen and avoided him, for never could he be found when the service was over. Before leaving Providence, Margaret said to her hus- band, "Let me write to him-I think I could touch his heart ;" but here Robert's Scottish pride rose up. "No," said he; " while we were in prosperity we did all in our power to soften his feelings toward us; now that we are poor, let us not subject ourselves to misconstruction." They removed to Milbank early in the autumn. The country that year was visited by one of those deso- lating typhus fevers, then so common. Two of their chil- dren fell victims, a little boy and their eldest daughter- their darling Janet. Mr. Ogilby himself, although he re- covered in a measure from the attack with which he had likewise been seized, was yet prostrated by it to such a degree as to be unable to fulfil the duties of Superin- tendent of thb Factory, the post which he had been invited to occupy. It was under those melancholy circumstances that the good Dr. Hardenberg first bccame acquainted with the family. They had yet another friend upon whom to lean in the hour of trouble. Mrs. Ogilby had known in- timately in Providence a sister of Mrs. Van Ness of Wal- dorf, and by this lady she had been furnished with letters of introduction not only to her sister, but to other families of their relatives. It was owing to the unremitting kind- ness of those new friends, their ready sympathy, and their tender consolations, that Mrs. Ogilby did not sink over- i    WALTER. OGILBY         99 whelmed during the first months in her home among strangers. Their son Walter, now about fifteen years old, was of an age to appreciate the trials by which his parents had been overtaken, the sickness and discouragement of his father, the death of his dear sister and little brother, and the gloomy prospects of the future; for though his father ral- lied, he never recovered his former vigor. The post of superintendent was given to another, and he was glad to accept at length that of book-keeper, though hardly able to discharge its duties. Mr. Ellsworth was a good-natured man, and really felt sorry for poor Ogilby; yet he was, if the truth must be told, quite as much alive to the disappointment of his own plans and to the inconvenience occasioned to himself, as to the sufferings of the unfortunate family. "You see how it is," he said to his relative and fellow- proprietor-Squire Vandervoort-" there's another vat of blue dye gone down the creek, utterly spoiled, good for nothing; and indigo at such a price! Not another person who understands the wood-vat to be had in the country for love or money, but this miserable Holtz, and yet he must be off on a drunken frolic, and let his dye ferment and go to the dogs, every time he thinks Ogilby is too weak to get down to the Factory to see after him. Ogilby must give up, poor fellow! We must have somebody else-there is no other way.' Occasionally, when not too much occupied with his business, or when he could remember to do so, Mr. Ells- worth would stop his horse at the gate of Mr. Ogilby's humble dwelling, call out with an inquiry how they all were, ask if there was anything he could do for them, and bid them cheer up and not be discouraged. Mrs. Ellsworth pitied the family from the bottom of her  &#xD;<pb n="100-101" xml:id="VAC7016-00000050"/> 100       WAL TER OGILBY. heart, and occasionally walked over to see them, and to recommend to Mr. Ogilby to take some remedy that she had found useful in an entirely different complaint. As a general thing, however, she contented herself with sending them now and then a basket of apples or some little deli- cacy, or with sighing and speaking plaintively of them whenever she happened to think of them. There was one of her children who took care to bring the family and their distressed situation often to his mother's mind. This was her son John Peter,-a fine, frank, im- petuous boy, somewhat younger than Walter, whose sym- pathies were from the first warmly enlisted in behalf of the strangers. "Can't we do something for them, mother?"' was his frequent inquiry. "You know father said they lost everything they had before they left Providence, and since they have been here it has just been one misfortune after another,-nothing but expense all the time,--and poor Mr. Ogilby not able to earn a cent for their support." "But, my dear, don't talk so: he is bodk-keeper now,  i you know." "Well, the salary of that would be little enough to keep I a family in health, let alone sickness for weeks and months. I don't believe you know it, mother, but Walter does   d every stroke of the writing, and figuring too, for his father  is not able. He is so weak and poorly that Walter has to 1 be up with him ever so many times in the night to raise i him so that he can breathe easily. I heard Uncle Har-  L denberg tell Aunt Lany so. And he says he is just like  I a man in the family, taking care of his little sisters, and doing everything for his mother, though he is but a little older than I am. What can be done?' John Peter had all a boy's eagerness and love of planning. "I dare say Mrs. Ogilby would like to teach music--they say she plays beautifully on the piano. Let Gitty take lessons of (. ..   WALTER OGILBY.        101. her, won't you? and then you can pay her a very high price, you know-and if any of the families at Cedar Grove or Waldorf, or any of our cousins, will give her scholars, I can carryv her to them in the gig two or three times a week. " "I am sure I wish you would," said his mother; " but you know your father always wants the horses, and I don't believe Gitty would walk down there to take her lessons. It would be a dreadful long walk, to be sure, for the poor child. But if she would like to have Mrs. Ogilby come up here to teach her, she can." Gertrude, when applied to, negatived the plan. "She dc not believe Mrs. Ogilby knew anything about teaching-a book-keeper's wife! Besides, she was going to school in New York, in the fall: she could learn all the music she wished to there." "But, my dear, it would be such a help to them." "You can give them money: that will help thelm just the same." "But, my dear, Mrs. Ogilby is not a beggar: it would not do to be offering her money in that way." "If she is so dreadfully poor, she ought not to be so proud," was Miss Gitty's reply. When she heard however, that Cornelia and Christina Van Ness and the nieces of Colonel Roosevelt had begun to take music-lessons of Mrs. Ogilby, and that the carriage of one or the other family was sent once or twice a week to convey her to and 'from her pupils, she permitted a message to be sent to request Mrs. Ogilby's attendance at Milbank. The increasing illness of Mr. Ogilby, after a short time, caused a discontinuation of the lessons; not, however, be- fore the feelings of the teacher had received more than one wound from the self-willed and overbearing pupil. 9*  &#xD;<pb n="102-103" xml:id="VAC7016-00000051"/> 102  e     WALTER OGILBY. CHAPTER    XI. BESIDES the Hardenbergs and Mrs. Van Ness, Mrs. Ogilby had found other kind and true friends,-the large- hearted Van Vorsts,'as the doctor had called them, and Sarah Mills, who had not yet left the home of her aunt to preside over that of Farmer Van Tine.  9 The latter never thought it a hardship to leave her loom or her spinning-wheel to watch beside the sick-bed of the afflicted family. As for the former--that Mrs. Ogilby was a lady fromn Boston, was sufficient to recommend her to the little Nan- tucket housewife, while that she was in a state of sorrow and suffering established a claim upon the good man himself.                        i Farmer Van Vorst was a man of most comprehnsive sympathies. He could never understand that-thetale of woe, which his wife occasionally read aloud to the family on a winter's evening, was other than literally true. All his benevolent sensibilities becoming excited as the story went on, he would rise from his chair, turn his back to the fire, stretch himself to his utmost height, and, rubbing down his huge proportions with energy, exclaim,-  "I tell you what, Notchie, if I had been there, wouldn't I have straightened out things for them?" i' To straighten out things" for the Ogilbys employed many an anxious thought; and there had not been want- ing opportunities for the tenderest and most soothing attentions. When the beloved dead were to be buried out of sight, the care of Farmer Van Vorst provided for the suitable   WALTER OGILBTY.        103 ministrations. It was he who summoned the clergyman from his distant home; his hands, and those of his son Lebbeus, lifted the lifeless remains into the vehicle which supplied the place of a hearse; and they were the mourners who, in the enforced absence of the stricken relatives, took their seats beside the departed, and with solemn and reverent mien conveyed them to their last resting-place. These were kind offices, never to be forgotten in after- life. As Mr. Ogilby's disease declared itself in a hopeless affection of the chest, arid as he was no longer able to take the slightest supervision of the work he had nominally in charge, the prospects of the family grew more and more gloomy. Walter, it is true, would in a few years be able to earn them a living; but what were they to do in the mean time? Oppressed by anxious forebodings like these, striving to commit his all in faith to the God of the fatherless and the widow, yet feeling the weakness of the spirit in this hour of trial, Mr. Ogilby was sitting one night propped up in his arm-chair, which he now seldoni left even for his bed. No one but Walter was with him. Mrs. Ogilby had re- tired to seek the repose necessary to enable her to take her son's place after a few hours. "Walter," said his father, "bring me a pen and ink and solme paper. I must write a letter." "You, papal I You are not strong enough. It will make you much worse to attempt it." "My son, the letter must be written. I feel that it must." "Cannot I write it for you, then?" "You, my boy?"  Mr. Ogilby spoke faintly; but, after musing for awhile, "Yes, Walter," said he, "you shall write the letter."  &#xD;<pb n="104-105" xml:id="VAC7016-00000052"/> 104       WALTER OGILBY. He paused again to collect his feeble energies. "You have heard me speak of your uncle Walter?" "The uncle I was named for? Yes. I once asked my mother why I had never seen him, and she told me there were reasons; and that I must never inquire upon the subject again." "Let us write the letter," said his father, hurriedly, "and after that, if my strength holds out, we will talk. Write as I am able to dictate to you." The letter was commenced. It began with a solemn representation that the writer was standing in view of the eternal world, and that therefore what he wrote was to be received as from the dead, for with those he must be num- bereod ere perhaps that letter should reach the oneto   whom it was addressed.  "In looking back,' Mr. Ogilby proceeded to say, " upon your kindness in the days of my early youth, in recalling your scrupulous regard to justice, and the claims' of the most indifferent of your fellow-creatures, I cannot believe that you would have cast me off so entirely,-still less would you have steeled your heart against Margaret, whom you so dearly loved, had you fully known all the circumstances attending our attachment and marriage." After repeating more in detail than he had done in his former explanatory letters to his brother the history of that event, he paused from exhaustion.         i Walter, blinded by tears, and trembling with emotion, entreated his father to forbear, at least for the present. "With the present I shall soon have done, my dear boy," replied he. "My only care is now for the future. Let us go on."  The remainder of the letter was a touching appeal to his brother in behalf of his wife and children. "If I have done wrong," said he, "and wrong I now   WALTE7R OUI LBY.       105 feel my hurried action to have been, on me alone let the punishment rest. Let my sufferings and death wipe out my errors; and, oh, brother! take those whom I leave be- hind me to your heart, and let them atone for the sorrow I have caused you." It was with difficulty that Walter could get through his sad task. The revelation he had received filled him with wonder, although he was far from understanding clearly all that the letter referred to. After the letter was sealed, and his father had some- what recovered himself, he said,- "Put back the table, Walter, and stand here by me, that I may lean my head against you. I want to talk to you." "Not now, dear papa. You have exerted yourself too much already. Wait till to-morrow." "No, my son, now. To-morrow may be too late. Listen to me." Feebly, and as he could gather strength, Mr. Ogilby gave his son the history of his early life, passing over lightly the trials he had endured during the years he had spent under his brother's iron rule. He withheld no othfr circumstance-his brother's attachment to Marga- ret Elliott, the deception'that had been practiced upon him, his own hasty marriage, and the departure of himself. and young bride to another home. Here he paused. "But, papa,". said Walter, "how was it that you did wrong, as you say in your letter? If my mother loved you, she would never have married my uncle. What good would it have done him if you had waited?" "She would not have married your uncle, my son; but she would have convinced him that we had not been re- gardless of our duty toward him,-that we had not de- signedly and unfeelingly destroyed his happiness. He  &#xD;<pb n="106-107" xml:id="VAC7016-00000053"/> 106       JWALTER OGILBY. was a reasonable man, he was an unselfish man, and he would in time have conquered his own feelings, and sanctioned our union. 'He that believeth in the Lord,' Walter, ' will not make haste.' I took the matter into my own hands. I could not be patient, and thus brought misery on my brother for the rest of his days. Now, my son, remember what your father says to you,--never dis- appoint another as I have done. You will probably not be placed in precisely the same temptation; but, when you grow to be a man, do not forget this lesson. Never give your heart until you are sure you are interfering with the rights of no other person. It is a fearful thing to rob a man of the woman he loves."  Mr. Ogilby was not made worse, in fact he seemed rather better, for having unburdened his mind to his son,  and dispatched the letter to his brother. Before it was  possible for an answer to arrive, he began to expect one  impatiently. Day after day went on, and at length a let- ter was received. It was sealed with black and addressed to Mrs. Ogilby. Its contents were as follows :- "DEAR MADAM : "It is our painful duty to inform you of the sudden de- mise of our respected friend, Walter Ogilby, Esq. Three days since, he called upon us to witness his last will and testament, drawn up by his own hand, of which he re- quested us to act as executors, and which he placed in our care "He complained at that time of qo illness, although we could not but remark that he looked much worn and worried.

Without much apparent suffering, or even consciousness, he this morning breathed his last. "In looking over his papers, we find a letter from your respected husband, which gives us the painful impression that it is to you, rather than to him, that we are now called upon to address ourselves. "At Mr. Ogilby's request we read over his will before witnessing it, and have to inform you that, besides a few legacies, it contains a bequest to yourself of fifty thousand dollars; the remainder of his very considerable fortune is devised to your son who bears the name of Walter Ogilby. We enclose a letter just commenced, as we infer, to your husband and yourself, which was found upon Mr. Ogilby's table by the person who first caine to his aid. "We shall be happy to receive your instructions as soon as possible, and are quite ready to act for you in any matter that you may please to commit to our charge. Everything relating to the funeral ceremonies of the late Mr. Ogilby we shall of course attend to with suitable care.

"Accept, dear madam, our condolences and assurances of respect.           JAMES LESLIE, ADAM FERGUSON." It was impossible that this letter could be kept a secret from the one who had watched so eagerly for its coming; nor was it right that it should be withheld longer than was necessary to prepare him for its contents, and that of the enclosure. The latter contained simply these words, written with an unsteady hand:-  &#xD;<pb n="108-109" xml:id="VAC7016-00000054"/> 108        WALTER OGILBY. "MY DEAR BROTHER AND SISTER: God grant it may not be too late '" Fe w as the words were, they were enough to bring peace to the heart of Robert Ogilby. For some moments the husband and wife mingled their tears in silence; then the former, folding his hands and raising his eyes in solemn devotion, said,- "I am now ready to go and join him. Margaret, my    !  darling, the bitterness of death is past! After this he seldom spoke; but, sinking gradually and peacefully away, in three days more he was laid to rest beside his children in the little green church-yard. The soil where reposed those loved remains had become  } inexpressibly dear to Mrs. Ogilby. She could not resolve i to tear herself from it; she therefore, after, the proposed visit to Boston and- the settlement, by the aid of Messrs.  Leslie and Ferguson, of all matters that would secure her son's interests there until his coming of age, returned to make it her home in the neighborhood of Milbank. She rented a pretty place farther down the stream than her first residence, one that was a great favorite with her son Walter, with the view of improving and embellishing it, until, at the expiration of the five years of his minority, i he should be able to purchase and remodel it for himself.  But in no respect did she depart from her former retired i habits of life. Occupying herself with the education of her two daughters, or with superintending her son's pre- paration for college, which he was pursuing along with his young friend William Henry Van Ness, she received the visits of such as sought her society with polite hospi- tality, but rarely went abroad to return them.

Walter had but to resume the studies which had been interrupted on his-removal from Providence to Milbank, and he graduated with honor at Yale a short time previous to his coming of age and taking possession of his large fortune. A visit to Scotland, in the course of that year, accom- panied by h'is mother and sisters, had enabled him to make all necessary arrangements in regard to his patrimony there; it had also helped to add strength to the feelings of attachment with which he had ever regarded his father's-- we imight almost say his mother's-native land. It was partly from a taste acquired in his intercourse with Dr. Hardenberg-partly from a conviction that such knowledge would add to his usefulness-that Walter, after the purchase of Southwick's farm (to which he gave the more attractive name of Ferndale), resolved on acquiring at least a theoretical knowledge of the science of medicine, and it was on his return from attending a course of lectures in New Haven that he met with Mr. Morton and his daughter under circumstances which the latter regarded as so untoward. 10  &#xD;<pb n="110-111" xml:id="VAC7016-00000055"/> "O       WtALTER OGILBY.

Of the domestic history of the Ogilbys previous to their coming to Milbank, he knew little. But he did full justice to Walter's filial devotion, and to the noble and manly energy of his character, even, at the early age in which trials of such severity had fallen upon him.

Aunt Aulchy is not fond of trouble, except such as is of her own providing. With regard to your uncle, he is so taken up with business and with his political schemes that he sometimes forgets he has any fellow-creatures. I think Gitty is the one, however, whose behavior Walter will be least apt to forget." "But Gertrude must have been very young," said Alice, desirous of finding some excuse for her cousin. "A girl of eleven or twelve years of age is often thoughtless. Mr. Ogilby surely would not harbor resentment for so many years!" "Not if it had stopped there. There were a great many - '                 i   WALTER OGILBY.         " slights, and a great deal of haughty rudeness to Wal- ter's mother, as well as to himseff, which, of course, it took him some little time to forget; but in time he would have forgotten tthem. When she returned from her French boarding-school in New York, and Ogilby had just got home from Scotland, and taken his place here as a rich, handsome young man (his virtues and good qualities would not have gone for so much in her estimation), I think it was Gitty's plan to make an impression on him with her beauty and accomplishments, and so forth. She fancied, probably, that he had looked up to her with envy and admiration when he was poor, and that he would be delighted with her condescension in laying herself out to be agreeable to him now. But her designs did not suc- ceed. He paid her no more attention than politeness de- manded, and, indeed, seldom came to the house, unless John Peter was at home. Finding that he will not bow down to her, Gitty dislikes him, and, what is worse, takes pains to make others dislike him. She is smart, and can say a cutting, sarcastic thing in a way that some people will think worth repeating. Walter hears of these re- marks, though he cares as little for them as most men. I dare say he minds them no more than he used to her ordering the servant in his hearing, years ago, 'not to bring that boy into the parlor,' when he went to the house on business with her father. But perhaps I had better not have told you all this," said the doctor, with sudden recol- lection--" she is your cousin, and it cannot be pleasant to you to hear anything in her disfavor. If I had not felt sure that Gitty would try to prejudice you against my friend Walter, I would have kept silent. But forewarned is fore- armed. You are from a land that puts faith in old pro- verbs, if I mistake not. Come, let us return to your father and Aunt Lany."  &#xD;<pb n="112-113" xml:id="VAC7016-00000056"/> "2       WALTER OGILBEY Alice was sorry that the doctor had enlightened, her thus upon the subject of her cousin's sentiments and dis- position. She would rather have trusted to her own saga- city to discover as much of them as would be necessary for her to know. The conversation brought up many things which she had striven to forget. It forced her to remem-n ber how dictatorial and overbearing Gertrude had often shown herself when she had been visiting at Ashfield; how disposed she had seemed to pride herself upon her father's fortune, and her own fashionable education and acquaint-  ances, how in the habit she had been of undervaluing the dress and opinions of both herself and her dear friend Kate Andrews. But these thoughts were painful, and Ally did  her best to banish them; and on returning to the drawing-  room, she was able to enter with interest into the conver- i sation of her father and Mrs. Hardenberg. The latter had  finished an animated description of her little grandchildren  who were expected soon fromr the city, and had now en-  tered upon another topic  "I shall make a point of going to hear you preach on Sunday, Mr. Morton, although I am of the Reformed Dutch Church. You remain over Sunday, of course?" "Yes, I must certainly do so. I held out a slight hope to my clerical brother at New Milford, that I would give him a service on my way home; but as Gertrude is absent  it would not be acting well by her to hurry away without waiting to see her." The doctor wondered in his heart when Ally's Uncle George would have departed from any of his plans out of compliment to her; but he said nothing. "It will be a great satisfaction," continued Mrs. Har- denberg, " to the congregation, to have a minister who can administer the sacrament. The missionary, Mr. Ludlow I think I have heard it said, is but a deacon, and it is only at long intervals that Dr. R. pays the church here a visit."   WALTER OGILBYI        113 "The congregation must be small, if it cannot support a resident clergyman. Mr. Ludlow, I find, lives in a distant parish." "Very few families in the village belong to the English Church; they are mostly of the old Dutch stock, and keep to the religion of their forefathers. A few gentlemen's families, scattered in a circuit of ten miles around, are Epis- copalians,-the Van Nesses, and Roosevelts, and Qgilbys." "You forgot to mention our niece Gitty," observed the doctor; " she belongs to that church since she came from boarding-school, don't she, Aunt Lany? No reflections on your church for being fashionable, Ally; but the truth is, the Dutch Reformed is not much in vogue at Madame Lemoine's." "Then there is a church of another, denomination at a few miles distance from the village," continued Mrs. Har- denberg, changing the subject. "I think it is a New England Congregational. The people are very zealous, and will never allow rain or storm on Sundays to keep them from their place of worship. Occasionally the minis- ter comes down and holds a service in the neighborhood of the Factory for the convenience of such as are not able to ride a long distance." When these subjects had been finished, when the garden and grounds had been visited and admired, and they had returned to the parlor to tea, the doctor began to work himself up into a pretended fit of anxiety lest his young assistant, Dr. Van Wyck, to whom he had this day con- fided his professional business, had not conducted it satis- factorily, had not perhaps administered to Colonel Roose- velt's nephew the prescription designed for old Mrs. Snyder, or ordered a blister to poor Murphy's foot instead of a flaxseed poultice. "I intended to treat my friend Anthony to a glimpse of 10*  &#xD;<pb n="114-115" xml:id="VAC7016-00000057"/> "4       WALTER OaGLBY. you if he returned in time, so I asked him to tea. I took good care he should not get a sight of you in the morning, for that would have spoiled his day's work. He has a terrible habit of falling in love, you must know, so I sent him round by the back road to call on Mrs. Van Vorst that he might not mleet you. I am afraid by his staying so long, that he stopped to make himself agreeable to Clarinda Van Vorst, or that other pretty giantess, her sis- ter. We seem not likely to see him at all, this evening."  Dr. Van Wyck did not make his appearance, but Ally, having been so well entertained during her visit, did- not miss him, and was able to pronounce to herself as well as to her aunt on her return to Milbank, that "she had had a delightful day."                   3i Things had gone well with Aunt Aulchy in their absence. In the first place, the carpets had all been put nicely down  at an early hour. "And oh, Ally!" said she, "it was a wery good thing that they was, for we have had such a  J string of wisitors,-all the Wanderwoorts and the Wan Ant- werps, and Teuny Benthouse and his sister Maria! You see I sentword down to them all yesterday evenin' that they must come up and see you to-day, and I forgot to mention * that you was agoin' to the doctor's to spend the day. So they come and they were terribly disappointed, you mayr be sure, to find you gone. Teuny talked of drivin' right on there, to see you, but I told him that he better not take that trouble, you would not mind seein' him till to-morrow, and he could just as well come up with his sister then. And, Ally, they all want you and your papa to come there and spend the day with them as soon as you can." Alice had hot been prepared for such warm-hearted hos- pitality. She had heard much of the frank, unaffected kindliness of the people of this region, but she had not ex- pected to be taken at once, in this manner, into the hearts of the, whole social circle. It was very pleasant,   WALTER OGILB r.        115 "I hope Gitty will like me as well as my aunt seems to," said she to herself. "If she does, among all these kind friends what a delightful summer we shall have!" iAlice did not forget the next morning that this was the day in which Mr. Ogilby was to call with his sisters, but she only remarked to herself, "Since Mr. Van Benthuysen and his sister are to repeat their visit, my aunt will be very glad to have everything looking fresh and pleasant." When breakfast was over, therefore, she walked into the garden and gathered some of the finest flowers, which to her aunt's great satisfaction she arranged in vases and placed in the parlor. "Oh, Ally, how sweetly those look, my dear, the corcoruses and geranium leaves in the saucer of water, and then the little glasses of flowers standing in among them. I never saw them fixed so before. I wonder how you came to think of it. That yellow tea-rose, and tBhe heliotropes, and that great pink geranium are presents from- Walter Ogilby. He sent me a passion-flower, too, but somebody let it die. Gitty would have it, that they were all meant for her; but I am sure that the messages that come with them was all for me, as plain as could be. And then, there was that beautiful white grapewine that's growin' by the arbor, I am sure he sent his man up to set it out, and put it just where I wanted it. Gitty can't lay claim to that anyhow. And now Michael Byrne comes up everv spring, to trim that grapewine, with Mr. Ogilby's compliments. I'm sure I wish your uncle would get such a man as Michael to take care of our garden, for I declare it makes me sick to go into it and see what a piece of work Jake makes of it. It needs somebody to See to it, and I don't know," in a plaintive tone, "how I can be in the house, and out of it, at the same time." Alice had changed her dress and brought her little work- basket, in hopes that her aunt, as she was expecting com-  &#xD;<pb n="116-117" xml:id="VAC7016-00000058"/> "6       WALTER OGILBY. pany, would this morning give herself a little respite from household cares. But the good lady was deep in the re- cesses of a large closet in her bedroom. Seated on a low, stool, she was overlooking a huge basket of old shoes-- hunting out mates, rejecting such as were too much worn, and sorting with care tlhose that could, by any possibility, be still made of service. Alice inquired if she could assist her to arrange her toilet and prepare for the visitors who would be likely to arrive ere long; but her aunt only replied with a sigh, "Oh, no, I must get through with these first. Sit down there by  ! the door, my dear, and you can see if a carriage drives up; .  and now that you have your needle and thread, Ally, per-  haps you won't mind just mendin' this lace for me as you sit there. Gitty has been goin' to do it for me all spring, t but she's been so busy, poor- child I she has not had time, and I do so want it to trim a cap."           t Alice took the lace, well pleased to have an opportunity of obliging her aunt. "And now, Ally, tell me about your wisit yesterday. What did you and Aunt Lany talk about? I suppose she showed you how far the meadows went, and pointed out the nice lots in the willage, that were a part of the prop- erty."  Alice was obliged to admit that she had heard not a word on the subject. "How queer 1" said Aunt Aulchy. "Lany must have known that you and your father would feel so interested about it, I should think she could not help telling. you. You must know, Ally, that my father was a wery rich man, and had us three children--my brother that lives in York, and my sister Lany and nmyself-and before he died, he divided'off his property in three parts, the willage property, and this here at Milbank, and'his property in York City,   CWAL TER OGILB .        117 which was quite a good deal, for he was connected with a great firm in business there,-he was what is called a silent partner, though you'd never have thought it, Ally, such a lively, talkative old gentleman as he was. Well--he got his friends to appraise all three divisions, and when one was of less value, he added money to make it up equal, and then he let us'draw for them, to see which he should leave us, in his will. He said he was not goin' to have everything sold off, and the worth of it divided up, as some people did, after they were dead. It happened that I drew the city property, but I was wery glad to change with my brother, who liked it better than this old homestead place, and was willin' to give considerable for the bargain. For my part, I would not have given up this place for all York put together. And that's the way it come to me, when the old gentleman died, and it hasn't lost anything in George's hands, you may be sure. I wonder Aunt Lany did not tell you all about it. Yes, Ally, we are as well off as people ought to want to be, if your uncle would only think so." Ally looked at the basket of old shoes, and thought what a pity it was that rich people should toil over such worth- less trifles; but she had already learned that it was in cares such as these that Aunt Aulchy found her happi- ness. tI, .  "Now, Ally, my dear," said her aunt, suddenly changing her tone, "let me tell you one thing, as you have to study economy I suppose. It is an excellent plan to get your- self eight or ten pairs of shoes at once, and wear sometimes one pair, and sometimes another. It eases them, and they last as long again,-you just try it." Ally laughed. "I am afraid papa would open his eyes, if I should propose making such a magnificent purchase. When I am about sending to Fairchild in the spring for a    -"         ,  &#xD;<pb n="118-119" xml:id="VAC7016-00000059"/> "8       WALTER OGILBY. couple of pairs for my summer's wear, I assure you I think the matter over and over again, before I can quite resolve on such a piece of extravagance."  "Dear me I why, Gitty has a new pair every fortnight, and of the hmost expensive kind. I don't see how you contrive, my dear; though to be sure, when I was young I did not need so many shoes, nor so much of everything else as girls seem to, nowadays." CHAPTER XIIE               l "THERE, Aunty!" cried Alice, starting up. "There is a carriage,-two carriages stopping at the gate. They are filled with ladies and gentlemen." "Dear me I dear me!" sighed the poor lady,-lropping  i her lapful of shoes, and running about in great perturba- tion. "Shut the door that leads into the parlor, my dear j -call, Silvy, won't you? What shall I do? Silvy, you run to the door-tell the company I'll be there in a minute. Alice, dear, hand me my black silk gown out of the press-- there now, just help me to put it on. I wonder what made them come so early I Isn't nty face and hair all dust? ! That's right, wipe it off, and just smooth down my hair. How does it look? Will you go in my Ibreau-drawer and I get me my cap? Oh, dear I I ought to have got ready before, when I knew they were comin'; but I thought you wanted to just hear about the property." Alice could not help smiling. "How natural it is," she thought, "to imagine that others wish to hear what we are longing to tell 1"   WALTER OGILBY.         119 Aunt Aulchy was at length made presentable, and with flushed cheeks and not very sedate air, she entered the parlor, followed by her niece. Alice found herself in the midst of a large circle, and was presented by Mr. Ogilby to his 'mother, a noble and dignified lady, dressed in the deep mourning which she had never laid aside since the death of her husband and children. The others of the party were Mr. and Mrs. Van Ness, and their two daughters, and Mr. Ogilby's sister, a tall girl of seventeen, somewhat shy and awkward, but with a countenance full of intelligence. There was an air of quiet good-breeding about the whole party, very much in contrast with poor Aunt Aulchy's fussiness. Alice could not refrain from looking frequently at Mrs. Ogilby, in whom the doctor's story of the day before had awakened a deep interest. She was surprised; too, at her visit, believing such an attention to strangers unusual on her part. "We had hoped to see your father this morning, Miss Morton," said Mr. Van Ness. "Mr. Ogilby apprised us of his arrival, and we lost no time in paying our respects to him, and bringing our young people to make acquaintance with his daughter." Alice thanked him, and said that her father had gone out after breakfast, with her uncle, to look at the Fac- tories. ".Shall I send Jacob, aunt, to ask him to return?" "Yes, do, my dear, and tell him to ask your uncle to come, too-not that I think he will, for he wery seldom leaves his business for company. It's wery happy for you, Mrs. Wan Ness, that your husband has no such great un- dertakings to keep him busy and away from his family all the time." "Indeed," said Mrs. Van Ness, politely, "I must not  &#xD;<pb n="120-121" xml:id="VAC7016-00000060"/> 120       WALTER OGILBY. boast. If there is not manufacturing, there is farming, you know-planting to be seen to, or haying, or harvest- ing. I believe we all have our little vexations in this way. It is difficult to persuade our husbands to stay at home and give us their company day after day." Mr. Morton was not long in obeying the summons he had received, and while he was engaged with the older members of the circle, Miss Ogilby summoned courage to approach Alice, and to offer for her acceptance a magnifi- cent bouquet of hot-house flowers.           l "i How lovely how fragrant! but do not let me deprive i you of it," said Alice. "I brought it expressly for you," said the young lady. "Brother told me you were fond of flowers." "How could he possibly know that?" thought Alice, with a sudden glance toward him. He seemed occupied in turning over a music-book, with Miss Van Ness, as if he had not noticed his sister!s remark. Alice began examining the beautiful variety of flowers, many of which were new to her. Among them was the passion-flower. Hearing her inquire its name, Mr. Ogilby turned to explain to her the different points of the flower, and the sacred emblems symbolized by each-the Cross, with the twelve Apostles kneeling around it. "And has it no perfume?" asked she "Very little."                  "What a pity  The emblem is incomplete--there should be 'the golden vial full of odors,"' said Alice, thoughtfully. "The Cross and the Apostles having passed away, we bring them to mind by outward resemblances," said Mr. Ogilbyv, in a low tone; "but that of which the 'golden vial full of odors' is the figure, the prayers of saifits, should be always with us, and need no emblem." , .         .S   j)   '     WALTER OGILBY.        121 "That is a perfume," said Alice, "that should hallow not only every flower, but every blessing of our lives." Mr. Ogilby was silent for a few minutes; then, seeing his sister and Miss Van Ness engaged in conversation, he again addressed he-- "You were surprised that I should have known yod liked flowers. Did you think I had forgotten the laurel and dog-wood blossoms with which Garry was orna- mented, and the quantities of other wild flowers with ;which your chaise was filled when I first met you?" The allusion was ian unfortunate one. Ally felt the color mounting to her temples in spite of all her efforts to look unconcerned. To hide her embarrassment, she rang for Silvy to bring her a glass of water. "My beautiful flowers will wither," said she to Miss Ogilby, " if I neglect them longer." i    Silvy brought the water on 'a tray; but, in passing j   through the door rather awkwardly, an unlucky open por- tion of her dress caught upon the knob, and the water was in consequence spilled upon the carpet. "Oh, mercy on us, Silvy! That is just like you," ex- claimed her mistress. "Do run and bring a file and file that right up." i    "A file!"Ally could not help exclaiming. i    "Don't be alarmed for the carpet," said Miss Van Ness, !   smiling; and there was a general laugh at Ally's look of relief when Silvy appeared with only a house-cloth to wipe away the disorder she had occasioned. Some refreshment having been offered, the visitors now rose. "I must hope," Said Mrs. Ogilby, "for the pleasure of seeing Mr. Morton in our home before his departure. As his visit to his friends is to be so short, I dare not ask for  .   &#xD;<pb n="122-123" xml:id="VAC7016-00000061"/> 122       WALTER OGILBY. a whole day, but I should be happy to have him meet you all," turning to the rest of the company, " at Ferndale to- morrow evening." "Which means," added her son, in explanation, " a so- ciable visit, I suppose, early enough for a walk on the ! banks of the-stream, or a stroll through the garden before sunset. " Mr. Morton was about to accept the invitation for him- self and his daughter, when Mrs. Ellsworth interposed,-- "I don't think, brother, we could go to-morrow. May- be Gitty might be comin' home one day earlier than she expected, and it would be too bad for her to find the house all lonely and deserted.  We had better put off the wisit till Saturday, and then she will be here to go with us." Alice was rather surprised at her aunt's cool manner of altering Mrs. Ogilby's arrangements. She felt, she could hardly tell why, that she could enjoy the visit more, as, it had been at first proposed; and she was conscious of a very decided feeling of satisfaction when Mrs. Ogilby said, turning to her son,- "On Saturdayv evening, I think, Walter, you have an engagement which cannot well be broken through. I be- lieve we shall have to petition for to-morrow.  . This was addressed to Mr. Morton, who iccepted the invitation without further hesitation, adding kInlly,-- ( I only regret that'my sister will not be able to accom- pany us." "And you will allow me, I hope," said Mr. Van Ness, courteously, " to take you with us from church on Sunday, j as our house is the home of our young missionary, Mr. Ludlow, when he visits this part of his field of labor. If I were not afraid of intruding upon Mrs. Ellsworth, I would offer to call with Mr. Ludlow on our way to church on Sunday morning." -   V ^  '   -. ]   WALTER OGILBY.         123 "Oh I not by any manner of means," said the good lady; "no intrusion. We are wery early risers at Milbank, though George does sometimes pretend he can't wake up because he don't hear the- Factory bell." As her visitors were about to depart, the hostess sud- denlyv recollected herself. "But where is your son,-where is Mr. William Henry? To think I should have forgotten him all this time, and never once asked after him." "My son was obliged to go to Poughkeepsie, this morn- ing, upon business for me. I shall have the pleasure of informing him that he has lost a most agreeable visit." And the old gentleman bowed himself out with all the courtly grace of the old school. ' Mr. Teunis and his sister did not make their visit until late in the afternoon. Aunt Aulchy was constantly ex- pecting them, and of course in all the intervals of her bustling about, she made them the subject of conversation. "It is such a wery strange thing that Maria Benthouse never got married--such a nice woman as she is " Aunt Aulchy had a great respect for matrimony. She :   looked upon it as a means of increasing one's family con- nections; a possession that, in her estimation, was to be ':  valued rather by quantity than by quality. It had always    been a fault in her eyes, that the Van Benthuysens had !;fi  so few cousins ; and sloe had never been able quite to for- give Miss Maria for having in former days refused a worth- less young relative of her own, who had no other recom- - mendation than a tolerable estate and the widely-extended branches of his family tree. "Mercy on us I  What can anybody do without rela- tions? Now if Maria Benthouse had married Jeromus, she would have been cousin to us Westbrooks, and to the Wanderwoorts, and the Wan Antwerps, and all the Storms  &#xD;<pb n="124-125" xml:id="VAC7016-00000062"/> 124       WALTER OGILBY'. up at Middlebush, and the Rapaljes, and the Rosebooms, up beyond the Hook---" She paused to take breath, and refresh her memory. "Then Maria Benthouse's not marrying, keeps her brother single," resumed she. "He thinks, I suppose, that he could never marry and leave her alone. I would not be so contented under it if I was he. I would stand up for my rights. I think he likes one of my cousins, the Wanderwoorts, and they are such nice girls! I don't think Teunis cares which, for he is not particular. I do believe he would offer to one if his sister Maria was not in the way. And'I must say, as for those girls, I don't think they have half a chance.. The old people are so close, and keep so much at home, that I don't see where they are ever to get husbands. Their father goes with them, to be sure, when they go to a party, or an excursion, or any- thing of that kind; he won't trust them even with Garret, and that again is wery bad-it keeps the young men away."  "I cannot. see how, unless there is something very dis- agreeable about him," said Alice. "Oh! no-he is wery pleasant; but you see, my dear, nobody wants an old father by, listening to every word that's said. A young man might say a great many things to a young girl if she was by herself, which he would never say if her father was by." "If it were anything that was' right and proper to be said, I do not see how the judicious and watchful care of a father Would interfere with its being said. If he wished to marry the young lady, he would find an opportunity of  telling her so."- "My dear, you don't understand me. Many a little thing said in company, and without ever having been thought of before, may lead to an engagement and a mar-   WALTER OGILBY.         125 , riage, because a young man thinks he has said it, and he has got to stick to it. Now where there are four or five sisters, like the poor Wanderwoorts, and an old father always watching them--what chance have they, I should like to know?" "I should think they had a most excellent chance for happiness when they do marry: they would at least know whether there was true love and respect between them and the object of their choice." There was no more to be said, for the expected visitors arrived at this moment. They both met Ally with great cordiality. "You are no stranger," said Miss Maria. "Your aunt made us acquainted with you yesterday, and to-day the Van Nesses and Ogilbys called on us, after their visit here, so we know very well by this time how mfich to be obliged to your father for bringing you to Milbank." Mr. Morton, who, having finished his after-dinner nap'  had now joined the party, proposed a walk to the Fac- tories, which Ally had not yet seen. Aunt Aulchy ex- cused herself'-she "did not wish to overfatigue herself io-day." The emphasis laid upon the last word, set Ally wondering what could be the special occasion for which h er aunt's forces were being reserved; but she finally con- eluded it must be to receive Gitty, should she chance to 1^1  return, as her mother had suggested. One thing she was ! I  pleased to observe-that either the excitement of her own j i presence or the satisfaction of house-cleaning had had a Xi   most beneficial effect upon her aunt, for she had scarcely been heard to sigh or pity herself for the last twenty-four "\  I hours. Mr. Ellsworth, who happened to be at the Factory when they arrived, seemed much pleased to do the honors of the establishment--to show them all the different kinds of "*  &#xD;<pb n="126-127" xml:id="VAC7016-00000063"/> 126       WALTER OGILBY. machinery, and explain their uses, and to make plain to them the whole process of fabricating broadcloth, cassi- mere, and satinette. It was not altogether new to Alice: she had seen such bevies of blue, greasy little boys, and of pale, weary-look- ing girls, before. A number of the latter, seated in a row, at a long board, on which was stretched a web of cloth, and picking, picking with a small steel instrument at the  white specks and threads which had become interwoven with the fabric, excited her commiseration. "What a life to lead!" said she to Mr. Teunis: "to be chained down day after day to the same unvarying, unin: teresting employment I It is enough to paralyze the mind -to destroy the faculties."  "Oh! don't you believe it," said Mr. Teunis, laughing. "That one with her eyes cast down so demurely is, never- theless, wide awake. She is wondering in her own mind what we think of her. That one who sits next is taking the pattern of your dress or collar. The one who is look- ing up, near the end of the row, with clear bright eyes, if she is not composing poetry now, will be when she goes home at night. There is no mistaking that face-it is the index of a mind that cannot be fettered by a few yards of broadcloth, or a pair of burling-irons. Happily the intel- lect is very little affected by the character of the manual employment-where Nature has bestowed it, it will find for itself congenial occupation, and where she has not, leisure and variety will not create it." Alice had not believed Mr. Teunis to be so philosophi- cal. He had seemed so gay and light-hearted, so full of fun, and s6 fond of amusement, that she had supposed him rather superficial. She did not wonder now, that he and his sister should be so happy in each other's society. Mrs. Ells\yorth had taken care that tea should be ready   I1.    WALTER OGILBY    .   . 12 by the time they returned to the house. To permit a guest to depart without having eaten and drank of her good cheer would have been contrary to all usages. It was not long before she recurred to her grand leading idea-the visit to West Point. She must discuss it with Mr. Teunis. "As we wish to make it particularly pleas- ant," said Mr. Teunis, bowing to Alice, " there are several things to be considered. First, we must have a good boat. Ben. Hyer's boat, Maria, will be just the thing. We must not have more than twenty persons of our party, if we can help it, but with these uncomfortable great family connec- tions (excuse me, Mrs. Ellsworth), it is so difficult to pick and choose. It is rather a satisfaction to me on such an occasion that I have no one but my sister and myself to stand or sit in the world's way. Well, in the next place, we don't want to have too many gentlemen, nor yet too many ladies to each gentleman. We have a good many young ladies in our circle, that is certain," said he, musing. "Well, we will manage somehow. When Miss Gitty comes home, we will arrange all that. If there is any leaving out to be done she is the one to settle it. And then, al- though I suppose I need not mention that, there must be plenty of good things to eat, in case of our being cast away on a desert island, and obliged to depend upon what we can save from the wreck." "There will be a good many parties I suppose-visits to the cascade and to the top of the mountain, and to all other attractive spots, after Gertrude and her other cousins ar- rive," said Miss Maria; and with this comforting intima- tion, as it was growing late, she and her brother took their leave.  &#xD;<pb n="128-129" xml:id="VAC7016-00000064"/> 128       WALTER OGILBY.: CHAPTER XIV.  ALICE on the following day had finished mending the lace for her aunt and had trimmed her cap in a style that met the good lady's entire approbation. She had practiced a few of Gertrude's songs as well as some of hei own, and she had partly written a letter which she was to ask her father to put in the post-office as he should pass through the village  in his journey home on Monday morning. This letter could not have been to her Aunt Clara, giving her a description of all the events and persons she had met with since leav- ing home, and filled with messages of love to the dear little sisters; neither could it have been to her intimate friend Kate Andrews. Epistles to either of these would have been snugly packed away in her father's valise. Whoever it may have been designed for, it was not yet completed when Silvy appeared with a message. "Missus says she's woke up now, and please you'd bet- ter dress yerself, for the carriage will be round in half an - hour." Ally put away her papers, and locked her half-finished letter in her trunk; then, having given due notice to her father, and prepared all things for his toilet, she set herself about attending to her own. Alice had been brought up to feel that her respectability by no means depended upon her dress, yet she did not un-  dervalue the importance of taste and a certain degree of conformity to the existing fashions; her attire, therefore, though from necessity simple, was never such as to excite observation by its singularity. We will not say that she   WALTER OGILBT:         129 did not upon the present occasion study for a few minutes the comparative merits of a pink zephyr handkerchief and a blue one, deciding, as the afternoon was a warmn one, in favor of the latter. Nor is it to be denied that the long, soft, brown curls were twisted with something more than ordinary care around the finger, and disposed so as to hang in the most approved order, from the side of the head, down upon the neck. White was at that dayvthe indispensable dress of young ladies for an afternoon visit, and although Ally could not boast, like some of her young friends, of fifteen or sixteen different changes, yet her own fairy fingers had provided her with the means of always appearing in a tasteful and appropriate manner. She was surprised, on descending to the parlor, to find her aunt arrayed in her best silk, her most stylish cap and collar, and redolent of attar of roses, seated with' a lae calash and shawl in her hand, in evident, preparation for accompanying her relatives. "Are you going with us, aunty? Oh, I am very glad Pl said Alice. "Papa will be so pleased." L Yes, my dear," said her aunt, catching eagerly at so valid an excuse for going, after her objections to " leaving the house all lonely and deserted for Gitty." "Yes, I did not think it vould be treating your papa well, to let him go to visit the Ogilbys with nobody but you for company. Besides, as your- uncle promised to come down there for us in the evening, it would not do for me to say 'nIo.'  Not that Aunt Aulchy had had, for a moment, the faint- est intention of saying " no." An invitation was, in her opinion, a Godsend, which was to be accepted with thanks- giving by every conscientious person. She would, upon the present occasion, have preferred Saturday, but since Friday was the day settled upon, she had no thoughts of  &#xD;<pb n="130-131" xml:id="VAC7016-00000065"/> 130       WALTER OILB .I: flying in the face of Providence by refusing its gifts. She  had seldom taken tea with Mrs. Ogilby, and the prospect of a visit so much to her taste put her in ' flutter of good f spirits. She praised Ally's appearance, and prophesied a charming time at Ferndale, then remembered to lament over poor Gitty's absence and consequent loss, and, above all, to deplore John Peter's hard fate in being kept at West Point, when he had so much rather be at home, if it were only for one afternoon. "Poor fellow!" she sighed; "he seldom has any enjoy- ment; but we'll make it all up to him by-and-by --won't we, Ally?"The hour of setting out seemed an early one, even for a sociable visit, but Aunt Aulchy explained,- "We have got to go to Cousin Wanderwoosts, they would be so disappointed not to see your father. I'm just waitin' to see if I can see the doctor comin' down the road, that I may ask if sister Lany is inwited. But never mind: we shall know, if we see them there." And with this witti- cism she sallied forth and took her place in the carriage. At the residence of the Yandervoorts Alice found more of the true old Dutch homestead than anything she had vet seen. The high peaked roof, narrow windows, and walls covered with scalloped clap-boards lying over each other like scales, the curious bordering of knuckle-bones around the grass-plats and flower-borders, the antique fur- nitureg of the large, low parlor, the huge old Dutch Bible, with its massive covers of black leather and brazen clasps, formingl the most conspicuous ornament of the heavy claw- footed table,--all had the combined interest of noveltV and antiquity, bringing the far, stately past, with its stadt- holders and warriors, its navigators and reformers, into the bustling, trafficking, work-a-day present. The simple, hearty welcome of the respectable parents and of the buxom, good-humored dqughters, was followed 4   WALTER OGILBY.        131 if  by a pressing invitation to "take off their things and stay to tea." Aunt Aulchy fairly sighed over the necessity of saying "no;" but as it was impossible by any stretch of ingenuity to take tea in two places at once, she was forced to content herself with the promise of an early dinner or tea with her cousins when she had no visit to the Ogilbys in prospect. Alice was not disappointed in the appearance of Ferndale upon a nearer approach. It had originally been a good house, but the present proprietor had improved it by add- ing some large and more modern rooms, the irregularity of outline thus produced adding to the picturesque effect. There was a beautiful extent of green turf between the southern front and the stream, across which, at a little distance below, a bridge was thrown, connecting this part of the domain with rich, broad meadows, lying in a recess of the mountains beyond. At a distance above the mansion the mountains rose more precipitously, and nearly overhung the stream, which here, compressed between high, rocky banks, ran tumbling and foaming to meet the placid waters below. There was great wealth of trees and shrubbery about the place, so judiciously disposed, however, as neither to hide the dwell- ing from view, nor to intercept the finest features of the prospect in either direction. The chief glory among the former were, indisputably, the fine old weeping-willows, a 'group of which stood on the margin of the stream, while others, shading the end of the piazza from the mid-day sun, threw an air of venerable antiquity over the place. Gardens and a grapery stretched along a slope adjoin- ing the lawn on the farther side, extending, as it appeared, to a considerable distance. There was a great deal of taste, but no pretension, in the aspect of the whole. It might have been the residence of a man of more moderate  &#xD;<pb n="132-133" xml:id="VAC7016-00000066"/> 132       WALTER OGILBY fortune than Mr. Ogilby, and still have escaped the charge of extravagance. The smiling, gratified look of the master of the house as he came forward to assist his guests from the carriage, was such as to assure them of a welcome to Ferndale; and his attention in immediately introducing his younger sister Jessie, a beautiful girl of twelve or thirteen, whom Alice had not yet seen, showed of what importance each mem- ber of his family was habitually to him. These little courtesies, too often reserved for the inter- course of society only, when retained at home, go far to *  induce a habit of thoughtful consideration, and add, in no i small degree, to the happiness of the domestic circle. Mrs. Ogilby, in compliment to Mrs. Ellsworth's invalid I habits, or what it was customary to term such, politely  offered to sit with her in the house, and spare her the fa- tigue of a walk through the garden and grounds; but this was promptly declined. The omission of a walk in the garden would have been a loss to Aunt Aulchy in more senses than one; there was always some choice shrub or plant to be particularly admired, and to call forth a lament- ation that, amid her husband's multiplicity of engage- ments, he was always forgetting to order it for her. The matter would be sure, she knew, to be taken out of Mr. Ellsworth's hands at once, by Mr. Ogilby's politeness. To the garden they therefore proceeded. There was a terrace in the garden, from which a flight of steps descended, and Alice, who was one of the last of the party, stopped a moment to look over the balustrade at the gardener, a young, bright-looking Irishman, who was setting some plants there. Mr. Ogilby stopped too. Michael," said he. The young man raised his head, and showed his rosy, cheerful face. "Michael, I should like to have you gather a number of bouquets before it is --- * -- - ^5      . *    W4ILTER OGILBY.        133 dark, and keep them in water through the evening. Per- haps there are some among your flowers that the ladies will like to have." He took out his own penknife, apd began cutting here and there a flower, as he and Alice continued their conver- sation and their walk. She had made some comment on the appearance of the young gardener, and this seemed a subject to interest the master. He spoke of his fine, manly qualities, his devotion to his poor old mother, and the assi- duity with which he he was laboring to secure a compe- i tence that might enable him to marry a pretty young girl living near the Factory, on whom his heart had long been set. Mr. Ogilby entered into these particulars with an air of sympathy and interest, as if the happiness of his de- pendents formed a part of his own. From this individual subject he went onto the character of the Irish in general, giving instances of their peculiari- ties, and anecdotes 6f their blunders, with such genuine humor, that Alice, whose natural temper was a most joy- ous one, was charmed to find, unexpectedly, a spirit so akin to her own. "Now I must contribute my share to the collection of sketches," said she to Agnes, the eldest sister, who had drawn near, attracted by her merry laugh. "The princi- Rt pal figure is a young man from Sligo, whom my father had in his employ. A friend had sent us some fish as a present,-some fine Connecticut River shad; you know, i, j Mr. Ogilby," glancing archly at him, "that even the shad in Connecticut are superior to those found elsewhere. An- i    t -thony was standing near when the fish were brought in, and, in his unsophisticated way, remarked to my father upon them as something he had never seen before. Papa said, 'ou have no shad in Ireland, Anthony, I believe.' i  'Oh no, sir,' said he; 'no shad; but the salmon are so 12  &#xD;<pb n="134-135" xml:id="VAC7016-00000067"/> 134       WALTER OGILBY. plenty there that if there was no water in the rivers you might walk over the backs of them dry, without wetting your shoes--if they would not run away.' ' *  Alice had been delivering her story with animation, and, as they approached a gate opening out upon the bank of the stream, the rest of 'the party, who had already reached it, stopped in a group to listen. It excited a good deal of merriment. Aunt Aulchy in particular enjoyed it exceed- ingly. "Dear me!" she remarked; "how I should like to live there. The salmon is such a wery fine fish! And it must be so nice to be able to catch them without fishin' them out of the water!" Alice did not think it worth while to explain that this method of helping one's self to salmon was not much practiced in Ireland, owing to the inconvenient fact of there being water in the rivers of that country. The sight of other guests arriving soon drew the whole party to the house, not, however, before Mr. Ogcilby had tied up the flowers he had collected, and offered them to his young visitor. Doctor and Mrs. Hardenberwg were among the new-comers. They met Ally with warm cordiality. "Have you missed us these two days?" asked the doctor. '"Indeed I have," said Alice. "I kept a lookout for you, from the piazza, for two or three hours this morn- ing." "You would have had good eyesight to have seen me, my dear. I had to go up to Hopewell last evening, to take off a man's leg, and did not return until this noon. Don't turn so pale, Ally! You look just as poor Van Wyck did when I called upon him to help me a little. * Fact.   4-5-           WALTER OGILB]:         135 What are people's nerves made of nowadays, I wonder? Let me look at those beautiful flowers you have in your hand; some of Michael's tying up I know, by the looks of them. I thought, too, I saw him handing them to you just as you were coming through the gate." And as the doctor fixed his keen, merry eyes upon her, he had the satisfaction to perceive that every trace of the paleness, about which he had scolded, had completely disappeared. CHAPTER XV. MR AND MRS. VAN NESS, only, had come from Waldorf. A party of young friends from the city had arrived unex- pectedly, and detained the son and daughters. As is usual in such circles, the older members soon drew together. The Van Nesses and Mrs. Ogilby had many subjects of common interest with Mr. Morton, which they soon became quite absorbed in discussing, as they sat together a little apart from the rest. Aunt Aulchy had much for her sister's private ear about the course of her week's labors,-her suspicions of some "snoopin"' having been going on, Gitty's expected return on the following day, and the hoped-for arrival, during the coming week, of the two nieces from New York. The doctor had set himself seriously to work to amuse Agnes and Jessie, by telling them stories of his experience during his recent professional journeys about the country; secretly congratulating himself that by this manoeuvre he was leaving his young friends, Walter and Alice, to enter- tain each other.   &#xD;<pb n="136-137" xml:id="VAC7016-00000068"/> 136       WALTER OGILBY. "We shall get ahead of Gitty this time, I do believe," said he to himself, as he cast an occasional glance across the room toward the sofa, where the two were sitting. A table was drawn up before them, on which were spread various views of Scottish scenery, which Mr. Ogilby was explaining to Alice. His countenance was lighted up with animation, and she was listening with pleased atten- tion. Presently she spoke, ands the drawings were pushed back. He sat looking at her,-apparently unconscious of the earnestness of his gaze,-as if unwilling to lose a sin- gle Word. Again the sketches were taken up, and seemed to lead to a conversation equally interest n to both speakers. The doctor did not lose a motion or a change in the ex- pression of either countenance. "Walter is in earnest,-very much in earnest," was the result of his observations. "How it is with her, I cannot so well tell,-but such a man ought to win any woman, if he sets his heart upon it." After tea there was a proposal for some music, and Mrs. Ellsworth warmly petitioned Mrs. Ogilby to "sing and play as she used to, several years ago ;" but the latter ex- cused herself as calmly as she could, and joined in the gen- eral entreaty that Miss Morton would favor the company with a song. Alice had been well instructed, at least for 'that day. What was then esteemed a brilliant execution would, it is true, hardly compare with the degree of excellence ex- pected from young ladies of the present generation; but she had a sweet, clear voice, and sang with a great deal of feeling. There were several books of Scottish songs lying on the open piano. Mr. Ogilby began turning over their leaves. * "Here is a song," said he, "a great favorite of mine, which I have never heard sung in this country."   * .      -.  WALTER OGILBY.        137 Alice looked at it. "Oh I were my love yon lilac fair," she repeated. ' Yes, it is a very sweet song." "You know it then? Will you sing it for me?" Alice complied. Mr. Ogilby waited until the usual thanks and compliments had passed,-and those who stood nearest were engaged in hunting for their favorite songs or pieces,-he then again addressed her. "You are, of course, aware that Burns wrote only the two first verses of this song. With all his genius and ten- derness he did not quite succeed in making them equal to the third. There is a sentiment of companionship, of guardianship, in his stanzas, but not love. Do not you think so?" "I 'suppose the latter would be worth very little with- out the fornmer,-to our sex at least," said Alice. "Women are rarely so sufficient to themselves as not to need a friend and a protector, even more than a lover." "She speaks like an inexperienced person," said Mr. Ogilby to himself; but he was pleased to hear her thus speak; and he continued, "Here is a case in point." He placed a book before her,-it was open at "Auld Robin Gray." "How was it with Jenny, when she had a friend and protector, but no lover?" "Ah I that is not a case in point. Jenny did not choose; she yielded to the urgent entreaties of her father, and to her mother's look,-more appealing than words,-and stifled the dictates of her own heart. I suppose it would require more firmness than most of us possess to resist,"--here she stopped. "Is there too much pathos in the song for you to un- dertake it, or will you sing it for mne?" "I will try." The balilad naturally awakened touching recollections 12*  &#xD;<pb n="138-139" xml:id="VAC7016-00000069"/> 138      TWAL TER O GILB Y. in the breasts of some of the listeners, and marks of deep feeling were very generally exhibited as it proceeded. iNo one wondered that the concluding stanza was given by the songstress in a less assured and distinct voice than the preceding ones. To change the melancholy tone which had gradually stolen over the company, Mrs. Ogilby remarked to her young guest, "You have the genuine Scottish accent,-I should think you could hardly have acquired it in this country." "Yes; my friend, Miss Macartney,-she is my friend, although nearly twice my age,-a genuine Scotswoma)n, has taught me most of my songs, and, liking to hear theim properly sung, has taken pains to give me the right pro- nunciation. We havesread together, too,-Scott and Burns, and many an old Highland and Border ballad,-so that I have long learned to feel an interest in the 'Land of Lakes and Mountains.' Papa quite laughs at my enthu- siasml sometimes." "Not at your enthusiasm for Miss Macartney, my dear. It has been a great blessing to our young people," said Mr. Morton, in explanation to the company, " my daugh- ter's friend, of whom she speaks, coming among us. She had been reduced in her own country, and came to this, with some acquaintances, to try what she could do for herself. Some one mentioned Ashfield to her, and she was induced to come there with the hope of giving in- struction in music. She soon saw that it was Providence who had guided her steps, for she obtained pupils, made friends, and has rendered herself such a valuable member of our circle, that she is quite an oracle among us. ' Walter could noti but recall a period when necessity had imposed upon his dear mother the exertions which Miss Ma cartney had found so honorable, and he strove to keep \            ' ,   WALTER O GIL, B YE      139 down the- feeling of bitterness with which he, in spite of himself, recollected the indignities to which her position had, in more instances than one, subjected her. These were not pleasant thoughts, and to banish them, he entered upon a eulogy of the people of Ashfield, and of the State of Connecticut in general, which established him more firmly than ever in the good opinion of the worthy clergyman. It was a warm evening, for June had now commenced. The glare of the lights had attracted great numbers of insects, which, wheeling and flying round, now dashing in the faces of the company, now dropping upon the books or drawings, became each moment more annoying. To avoid them Sir. Ogilby proposed a walk upon the piazza, an invitation which the other young people were not slow in accepting. The do6tor followed, for he was anxious to take note of all that was going on. "There, Ally, do you know that sound?" he asked, as soon as they were in the open air. "I have never heard it before," she replied, "but I am sure it must be the whip-poor-will." She drew near the railing of the piazza. and listened. The notes mingled plaintively with the murmur of the stream, as it foamed along under the dark hemlocks in the distance. The mountain opposite rose in solemn gran- deur, the blue vault was studded with stars, and a young moon was sailing in the western sky, lighting up the sev- eral peaks, and throwing the deep gorges, and the whole landscape at their base, into darker shadow. There was enough in both " sight and sound" to charm so imaginative a temperamnent as Ally's. She leaned against a pillar, and seemed absorbed in contemplation. Mr. Ogilby had descended the steps, ostensibly to gather a spray of white blossoms that hung trembling in the slight evening breeze, but in reality to enjoy the &#xD;<pb n="140-141" xml:id="VAC7016-00000070"/> "O       WALTER OGILBI . pleasure of looking upon his young guest, as she gazed and listened. At length he spoke. "Your thoughts are not in this scene,--they are far away." She started. "For a moment they were," said she. "Above this earth?" "Yes; I was thinking--" she hesitated. "Have you not sometimes thought how sad it would be to interpret literally the declaration in the Book of Revelations, ' There shall be no night there?' It may sound irreverent,--I am afraid it does,-but I cannot help feeling that amid the glories of heaven we- should miss the beautiful summer evenings that so delight us here on earth." "By reading the context carefully we shall perhaps find a comforting explanation," replied Mr. Ogilby. "'The gates shall not be shut.' Exclusion from heaven-from the fold of happiness-seems to be the 'night' thus figura- tively spoken of. We cannot doubt that more will be given hereafter to charm our glorified senses than earthly eve hath seen, or ear hath heard." "Come, come," cried the doctor; "don't be preaching there, Walter. Leave that for Mr. Morton on Sunday. Everything in its place. Speaking of that, I am just balancing in my mind whether I shall leave my accus- tomed place to go and hear him day after to-morrow, or set an example of regularity by dozing comfortably in my own pew, under our excellent Dr. Hasbrouck, as I have done for the last twenty years." The doctor had not decided the point to his satisfaction, when the sound of a carriage driving down the approach gave notice of the arrival of Mr. Ellsworth; and, in com- pany with him, the party on the piazza returned to the drawing-room. Alice could not but wonder that, with, such powers of   WALTER OGILBY,         141 making himself agreeable, her uncle should exert himself so little to be entertaining at home. Was it because he there heard only household or personal cares discussed-- a dress, or a dinner, or a nostrum, ever forraing the chief topic of interest-that he shut himself up, and either cogi- tated in silence, or buried himself in pamphlets and politi- cal papers? Now he was the life of the company. Every subject that could interest Mr. and Mrs. Van Ness, or Mrs. Ogilby, or even the young ladies, was touched upon , in succession, and upon each he had somelthing pleasant to -say, which drew from his wife the delighted remark, in a low tone, to her sister Hardenberg;- "What a funny creature George can be when he has a mind, and what good company I Don't it surprise you how he keeps us all a laughin'?" "I cannot understand it," was Ally's mental comment. "Perhaps when his children are at home my uncle may be different. He certainly seems to pay great attention to their education, and, by all I have observed, they must possess fine natural powers. How much they lose by poor aunty's indifference and worldliness 1" When the party took their leave, Mrs. Ogilby pressed Allyv's hand, and, with more than politeness,-with earnest friendliness,-expressed a hope of seeing her often at Fern- dale; an invitation which, however gratifying, the latter feared there would be little likelihood of her complying with, so long as her cousin continued to entertain her present feelings toward the master of the mansion.  &#xD;<pb n="142-143" xml:id="VAC7016-00000071"/> "2       WALTER OGILB]. CHAPTER    XVI. THE next day brought Gertrude. She arrived early, having come as far as Poughkeepsie the day before with some of the members of her cousin's family. Their son, a quiet, gentlemanly younDg man, had driven her the remain- ing fifteen miles of the journey. He was to remain at Mil- bank over Sunday, perhaps longer, for he had no disposi- tion to tear himself away from his fair cousin. The young lady herself was, all smiles and good humor. She met Alice with an air of great cordiality, told her how delighted she was that she had come just at this time when Catlyna and Anna Eliza were to be there, kissed her uncle affection- ately;, and asked after her little cousins and their Aunt Clara, as well as about other acquaintances in Ashfield, and, upon the whole, appeared more amiable than Alice, with all her disposition to look on the bright side of things, had dared to hope.. "Not that I had not a strong conviction," said she to her- self, " that the doctor was prejudiced. His warm firiendship for Mr. Ogilby has led him to judge poor Gertrude severely. We are all neglectful of what is due to others sometimes. I can see that Gertrude has improved very much in the two years since we met. She has grown gentle and complaisant. After all, it is not surprising that, brought up as she has been, to have riches and earthly possessions so much discussed, and so highly estimated, she should, in early youth, have attached an undue value to them, and been in- clined to look down upon those who were destitute-of them. That is a fault not of nature but of education. Now she   I:i]         WALTER OGILBT.         143 is of an age to judge differently. She is evidently much changed, and I have no doubt we shall have a delightful summer together." Gertrude was handsome and stylish She had the ani- mation of a quick mind, and there was much that was at- tractive in her manners and conversation. She was in a good humor, for she had ascertained beyond a doubt that it rested with herself to bringo her Cousin Gerardus, the only child of their rich relative, Colonel Westhrook, to her feet. Gertrude did not wish, to marry her Cousin Gerardus,he was, in fact, except in the advantages of outward position, very little to her taste,--but she had made up her mind to be married, and she intended to marry Gerardus if she could not do better. She was therefore very glad to feel certain that she had him entirely at her disposal. She had at one time speculated upon the wisdom of set- ting herself at work to captivate her Cousin Garret Van- dervoort. Garret's father was the richest of all the neigh- boring proprietors; and money, Gertrude had often said to herself, money, and a great deal of it, was indispensable as a compensation for the absence of some other qualities she would have preferred in her future husband. Garret was as plain as Gerardus, and less refined and cultivated. He was good-natured, it was true, and would be very indulgent: of that there could be no question; but if she made up her mind to accept splendor instead of love, what would splendor be with Garret! Then his parents were so quiet and so old-fashioned! There would be no hope of making a figure while the old gentleman lived, for he held the purse-strings. So Garret was out of the question,-she might as well marry into a family of Quakers I There was Anthony Van Wyck, the young assistant of Dr. Harden- berg. He had the personal advantages which neither of her cousins possessed-a fine animated countenance, a lithe, ,   &#xD;<pb n="144-145" xml:id="VAC7016-00000072"/> "4       tWALTER OGILBY. graceful figure, a flow of lively, agreeable conversation. But what were all these? He was poor, with a Widowed mother and four or five younger brothers and sisters-there was nothing more to be said upon the subject. There was one, but that way it was vain to look. She must occupy herself with probabilities, possibilities. She must not let slip a certain, for an uncertain prospect of car- rying out her present settled purpose. There need, how- ever, be no violent hurry in making her final decision. Alice was sorry to observe the cloud that came over her cousin's brow when, in answer to her inquiry where they got the beautiful flowers with which the vases were filled, her mother eagerly explained,- "Oh, at Ferndale, to be sure I Why, Gitty, we drank tea there yesterday, and a most delightful wisit we had, didn't we, Ally? And the day before the Ogilbys were here, and they brought those flowers on the little table in the corner. And-let me see--Tuesday, was it?-yes, Tuesday, Walter Ogilby was here in the morning, and in the afternoon he called again to take your uncle to ride-and I dare say he will be here again Monday, for he is getting quite sociable." Gitty had by this time recalled her smiles, and was able to say, in a tone of tolerable indifference,- "Upon my word, you seem to have got up a wonderful intimacy. This is something new for you, mother. You are not usually so enterprising." In the course of the day Ally's letter was finished, and given into her father's charge. "Now, please don't forget to put it in the office yourself as you pass through the village, dear papa,!" was the earn- est injunction. "Don't trust it to a third person-you knotv how important it is that it should go safely." The next morning, Sunday, rose bright and beautiful, and, as had been promised, all things were ready in due   Vi -       WALTER OGILBY.        145 X11 season to receive the visit of Mr. Van Ness and the young clergyman. Aunt Aulchy herself, in a nice mnorning-dless, travelled about from room to room, now picking up a thread from the carpet, now wiping an imaginary speck of dust from a table or chair with her pocket-handkerchief, now calling to Dinah to hurry Jake round with the carriage. Her hus- band at length looked up from his newspaper, for even on Sunday mornings he read the city papers. :t Ain't you goingl to church with us, mother?" "Oh, no!" she replied in a tone intended to imply both fatigue and indisposition; "I' don't feel at all well this mornin'. I think I've rather worn myself out this week, a cleanin' house-and besides, you know, at the English Church there's such a-gettin' up and a sittin' down, it tires me most to death. At our own church, now, where I can sit quite still all the time, I don't mind it at all. I should like so much to go, too," said she, suddenly recollecting herself, " and hear brother William preach I I'm wery fond of preachin'. There's to be preachin' over to Mr. Wan Worst's this evenin'--they've just sent me word, and I've ai promised to go and hear Mr. Lyman, who's comin' down from Upper Meetun." The party from Waldorf at length drove up, and Mr. Van Ness and Mr. Ludlow came in to pay their respects to Mr. Morton, and invite him to take a seat with them in the carriage, and proceed at once to church. This being agreed to, Mr. Van Ness said, turning to Alice,- "I think it was settled on Thursday, that we were to have the pleasure of seeing you at Waldorf to-day, after service is over." "Oh, APly! no indeed." interposed her aunt. "I don't feel well at all, my dear, and I should miss you so. And    &#xD;<pb n="146-147" xml:id="VAC7016-00000073"/> "6       WALTERL OGILBY. Gitty, too,--you know she has only just got home,--she would be so lonely without you, for I don't feel as if I should be much company for her." And Aunt Aulchvy, who, since the entrance of the visitors, had forgotten to be in any other than the best of spirits, here relapsed into a plaintive mood. "But you know, aunty, this is the last day I am to have with papa." "Oh, well; but he will not miss you as much as I should, he will have so many people to talk to, and to entertain him. I dare say Mr. Ogilby will be there-he always is when Mr. Ludlow is down--they won't miss you at all." The last argument was uttered in a lower tone, audible only to Alice and Gertrude, who were standing near her. The latter immediately interposed,-- "Oh, mother! don't urge Alice. We cannot expect her to stay at home on my account. No doubt it will be much pleasanter at the Van Nesses'. I should not like to put our claims in competition with theirs." The very consciousness that she had never in her life felt a more earnest wish to accompany hler father, made Alice unwilling to insist too strongly uponit. She doubted not that her aunt would get very comfortably through the few hours of her absence; but rather than appear wilful she though it better to yield without further debate. She there- fore said,- "If you think best, papa, I will return with Gertrude after church, and Mr. Van Ness will, I am sure, make my excuses to the ladies." "They will regret exceedingly to lose the pleasure of your company,"7 said Mr. Van Ness, politely; "but if Mrs. Ellsworth's health will not permit her to spare you to us, we must only hope that another time we shall be more fortunate. ,   1/! I         WA LTER OGILBY.         147 TThere was the slightest possible smile at the corners of the old gentleman's mouth, as he bowed to the comfort- able-lookin(r lady, who, with a pathetic expression of coun- tenance, and a half-drawn sigh, received his adieu with those of the two clergymen-and then bustled about to expedite the departure of her own family to church. Mr. Ellsworth had said not a word while this discus- sion was going on. When the company had left, however, he remarked, quietly, to Alice, "My dear, if you wish to get along comfortably through life, do always just as you think best; don't suffer yourself to be talked out of what you like for the sake of pleasing anybody. You wanted to go with your father, and ought to have gone. I don't pretend to understand what the plan is in keeping you at home, and it's my opinion you'll see no very strong reasons yourself why you should have fallen in with it." Neither his wife nor daughter thought it best to appear to hear this remark; and the two young ladies went up- stairs at once to put on their bonnets. Alice was all ready, in her pretty chip hat and worked muslin cape, when her cousin stopped at her door for her. ' "Oh! what a neat little hat," said she, "and what very pretty white rose-buds on it I But a chip hat is of very little use. Why did not you get a Leghorn like mine? It is much more fashionable." "My hat was a present to me firom a friend of papas, just before I left home. Perhaps," said she, laughing, "it was more convenient to her to giye me a five-dollar hat than a thirty-dollar one." "Dear me! If she wanted to make you a present, she might as well have given you something worth while."' Alice did not feel uncomfortable at being told that her hat was cheap and perhaps unfashionable. She even pre- ferred it infinitely to her cousin's expensive one, which   &#xD;<pb n="148-149" xml:id="VAC7016-00000074"/> "8       WALTER O G IL B Y. under its weight of roses and wheat-ears, looked like a flower-garden. "What is suitable for a tall, brilliant-looking girl like Ger- trude would be quite out of place on poor little me," was her consoling reflection, as she followed her cousin down-stairs. Jake, the old negro, was standing, dressed in his best, by the carriage, the reins in his hand, ready to mount and fulfil his office of coachman. "Never mind, Jake; we sha'n't need you," said his master. "PI'll drive, for we may want to- pick up some- body on the road to church." Jake looked the picture of disappointment. "Come, come," said his master, good humoredly, "you need not stand there hanging your lip like a motherless colt. Go rummage about,- and see if you can't find a meet- ing of some kind or other over the creek-that will do as well as stamping through the dust up to the village, and soiling your splendid white trowsers to make your mis- tress angry with you." Any meeting he could "l rummage out over the creek" was, however, far frotm being a substitute with Jake for what he called his " own church,'" and which,-being asso- ciated with the memory of the master whom he had loved, and who, dying, had bequeathed him his freedom and a moderate provision for the remainder of his days,-was re- garded by the poor fellow with an almost superstitious rev- erence. "Could -not we make room for Mr. Westhrook inside with us?" whispered Alice. Gertrude did not reply, but Gerardus made a slight move- ment, which induced Mr. Ellsworth to say, "Well--well -tramp along if you like; I suppose you can coax Dinahl- to make you all right again.7"And Jake, with a cheerful heart and look, set off to walk the two miles to the village.   Xf i         WALTER 0GILB]Y.        149 When the party from Milbank arrived opposite the doc- tor's residence, they saw, on looking down the avenue, Mrs. Hardenberg and a gentleman approaching. "Stop a minute, father," said Gertrude; "I want to speak to Aunt Lany." Alice was amazed at her cousin's unceremonious man- ner. Before the others had got fairly through the gate, Ger- trude called out gayly, "How do you do, aunt? How are you, Dr. Van Wyck? I need-not ask, I am sure, you both look so well. Come, take a seat with us in the carriage, and we will drive you to church. Alice and I can sit close to make room for you, aunt, and Dr. Van Wyck can sit by Cousin Gerardus."' Mrs. Hardenberg made her salutations to Alice and Mr. Westhrook, and introduced Mr. Van Wyck; then she said quietly,- "We had rather walk, thank you. We have still plenty of time."' "Well," said Gertrude, with a smile, " if the doctor pre- fers a sober walk with you to a seat here with us, I have, of course, nothing more to say. However, I shall set that down as not his answer, but yours." And she gave the young man another smile so bewitching that poor Gerardus fidgeted, looked out over the landscape on the farther side of the carriage, and finally ventured to say,- "How very dry the roads are getting I I am afiraid, if we delay much longer, we shall have to drive fast, and raise a cloud of dust to spoil your beautiful bonnets." "Oh! I there are more bonnets in the milliners' shops, Cousin Gerardus," said the young lady, lightly. "How is it, doctor," pursued she, " that I hear my aunt introducing you to my cousin? Have not you been to call upon her yet? You must not be so remiss, nowy that I have re- 1.3*'   &#xD;<pb n="150-151" xml:id="VAC7016-00000075"/> 150       J V4L T:R OOILB Y. turned." And having made her lover thoroughly vexed and uncomfortable, and thus secured herself against a pre- mature declaration on his part, an inconvenience that she had felt hanging over her for the last four-and-twenty hours, , she now requested ler father to drive on. The service had not commenced when they entered the little church ; most of the congregation were, however, as- sembled, and quietly occupied with their prayers or their books until the clergyman should nlake his appearance. Mr. Ellsworth had a pew in the church, in which (if the truth must be told) he was seldom seen. His daughter, when she went to church at all, made. a point, as the doctor had affirmed, of attending the one she thought most fash- ionable; and her brothers, when at home, accompanied her -John Peter, because, from being accustomed to the service at the Military Academy, he had grown to like it, and Cor- nelius, because it furnished .him, after service was over, the opportunity of a chat with Agnes and Jessie Ogilby, of whose society he was particularly fond. The Ellsworth pew was in a line with that of the Ogilbys'. As Alice, who had entered first, rose from her knees after the short preparatory prayer, she observed Mrs; Ogilby's hand extended over the low division that separated them, and felt her own most kindly and tenderly pressed in its clasp. There was something so cordial, so affectionate, in the action, that Alice felt indeed " of one household." There was no instrumental music in the little congrega- tion, but the chants and simple old-fashioned tunes, exe- cuted with tolerable skill by the majority of the worship- pers, made a music which Ally thought. peculiarly devo- tional. The morning prayer and sermon over, all the innmates of the pew, except Alice, rose to retire. Gertrude whispered to the latter "I suppose, of course, you stay to the coln- ]   V           }FVALT WALTER OGI[LBY.     151 munion; Gerardus and I will go and call on some friends of mine who live near: we will be back by the time you have finished.7 Then, with a thoughtless, indifferent air, bowing and smilinrrto such of her acquaintance as she recognized, she left the church with her father and Mr. Westhrook. Less than an hour was sufficient to complete the services, for the number of communicants was not large; after they were concluded, and Alice had rejoined her father and Mr. Ludlow, they proceeded to the porch, where were already the Ogilbys and-Van Nesses awaiting them  Mr. Ogilby'// friend, William Henry, was there-an agreeable-lookiig young man, with a profusion of light hair curling round an open, manly brow, and a pair of bright gray eyes, that de- noted great keenness of perception, while in their expres- sion was a something that as plainly declared a tempera- ment alive to mirth and joyousness. There was a general expression of regret on hearing that Alice was to return to Milbank instead of accompanying her father to Waldorf; and when she came to offer her excuses to Mr. Van Ness that "her aunt could not do without her,7' and that "Gertrude would be lonely," she hardly knew in what language to maIke her apology sound respectable. Certainly, it seemed as if she were uttering what she could not herself believe to be true! And then- it would hardly answer for her to express disappointment- that might seem a reflection on the selfishness of her rela- tives! Her father came to her relief with a gentle,- "Never mind, my daughter. We should have to be sep- arated to-morrow at any rate, and perhaps it is well to be- gin to accustom ourselves to it by degrees. As your poor aunt was not well enough to come to church, she doubtless wishes you to re'ad to her this afternoon. If you do not find any other book that will suit her, you can take ' Tay-  &#xD;<pb n="152-153" xml:id="VAC7016-00000076"/> 152       WALTER OGILBY. lor s Holy Living and Dying,' which lies on the table in my room. It will be a great'comfort to her." Gertrude and Gerardus did not yet make their appear- ance; and, as the Waldorf party had a long drive before  them, Mr. Ogilby kindly said,- "Do not delay setting off. We will keep Miss Morton company, unless indeed, she will allow us to set her down at Milbank." The latter proposal Alice declined, on the plea that ler cousin would expect to find her at the church; but as time slipped by, and still the latter did not return, the waiting party strolled through the quiet, shady grave-yard that sur- rounded the church, now reading the inscriptions on the tomb-stones, now loitering to converse under the hanging boughs of the weeping-willows. "I saw an old acquaintance of yours yesterday," said Mr. Ogilby; " one who made many inquiries about you." "An acquaintance of mine?" said Alice, with surprise. Mr. Ogilby smiled at her perplexed air. "It was my friend Sauchie," said he; "Mrs. Van Tine. She came, as she promised, to see my mother, on her way to the sloop. She rejoiced to hear that you had not suffered from the effects of the rain on Monday last, and expressed so earnest a wish to see you again, that I have engaged to use my best efforts to induce you to visit my mother on Saturday next, when she is to give us another call." Mrs. Ogilby joined in the invitation, offering to colme herself to Milbank to fetch her, and Alice, grateful for such an unexpected attention, at once gave the desired assent. The arrangement was hardly completed, when Gertrude and her admirer made their appearance. They had found, the former said, such a large circle of friends and acquaint-   ;    * 'TWALTER OGILB.        153 ances, dropping in one after another to greet them, that they had not been aware how time was flying. All this was addressed to Alice; for, after the first rather formal salutations, Mrs. Ogilby and her daughters had apparently preferred to listen, rather than take an ac- tive part in the conversation. Mr. Ogilby and Mr. West- brook knew each other, and some few remarks and inqui- ries were interchanged between them, after which the Ogilbys bade good-morning, and proceeded towards their home. "Why did not your father and the Van Nesses wait with you? How came you to be left with the Ogilbys?" were Gertrude's first questions. "The Van Nesses have a long drive, and as papa and Mr. Ludlow are to have an afternoon service in their neighborhood, it was thought best for them not to delay. I should not have minded staying alone, but Mrs. Ogilby kindly offered to remain with me, and papa and the others seemed to think that a very good arrangement." "I suspect that Mr. Walter Ogilby, for one, did not thank them," said Gitty; "for he is desperately in love with Christina Van Ness,-indeed, it is generally believed that they are engaged. He must have been excessively annoyed at our detention,-his manner rather implied as much.  I had no idea we were doing so much mis- chief." These remarks did not accomplish all that Gertrude de- signed. Alice, from even her slight opportunities of ob- servation, was persuaded that Mr. Ludlow was the most acceptable companion that Miss Christina could have been vouchsafed; and she was by no means convinced that Mr. Ogiilby had been "exceedingly annoyed" by his mother's offerl of remaining with her at the church. When her uncle at length joined them, therefore; she i ,      ,   &#xD;<pb n="154-155" xml:id="VAC7016-00000077"/> 154       WA4 L TE R OGILB I'. was able to take her seat in the carriage without one feel- ing of self-reproach, and to proceed with the utmost cheer- fulness to Milbank. CHAPTER    XVII. "ONLY think, Gitty," was her mother's salutation, as she entered the house, "the Wander Woosts stopped just after you had gone, and, seein' I felt so poorly, they asked me to come down there to tea this afternoon. They are goin' to have some apple fritters,-the wery last apples there'll be, till the trees bear again. They wanted me so to come and eat some, for they knew I was wery fond of apple fritters."  "Of course you had to say no, as you were not well enough to go to church," observed her daughter. "Well, so I told Garret at first. I told him I did not feel well, but he said that was only a reason more why I ought to go,-and he said they was the wery last apples there'd be this season; and it was wonderful how they had contrived to keep good so late as this. You know, Gitty, ours have been gone I don't know how many weeks; and Garret said if I did not come to-day, I wouldn't have an- other chance before fall, or August, certainly,-and he seemed as if he could not give it up, but come I must. So I told hium I thought I should feel better after dinner, and if they would have early tea, so I could get back time enough for the meetin' at Mrs. Wan Worst's, and if your father would go down with ime, maybe I might conclude to go."  "Very well, ma'am ; only as Ally gave up going to Wal-   IWALTER OGILBY.        155 dorf with her father because you could not spare her, she might thihnk it strange you should go away and leave her." "To be sure, so I did," said the poor lady, with a dis- appointed look. "But I do not think Ally is a person to be so over-particular. I dare say she would be glad to have me go out and enjoy myself now and then, when I do feel able,-wouldn't you, Ally?" She looked around, but Ally had gcne up-stairs to take off her bonnet, and had lost the latter part of the dia- logue. After dinner Aunt Aulchy,' having secured her hus- band's promise to drive her to her Cousin Vandervoort's to tea, retired to take a nap, that she might be fitted for the exertion. Gertrude took her seat upon the piazza, and de- voted herself to the task of restoring her Cousin Gerardus to a more comforltable state of feeling than he had enjoyed for the last few hours. She saw that he was pained by her levity in the morning, both before church, and after- wards during the visit they had made together to some friends as thoughtless as herself. Gerardus was very much in love, but he began to fear that he was trifled with. He was debating seriously whether he had not better return to Nine Partners on the following morning, instead of prolonging his visit for a few days, as he had at first intended. Something of the kind he had let fall on their walksback to the church, and Gertrude saw that it would not do to play too venturously with his affection. He was a prize of too much value to be permitted to slip away until she was ready to part with him. Gertrude was not in the best of humors. She had a strong suspicion that the Ogilbys already liked Ally very much,-that they were disposed to treat her with more &#xD;<pb n="156-157" xml:id="VAC7016-00000078"/> 156        WALTER OCILBY.         ! than usual attention. A part of their civilities, it is true, could be attributed to the respect due to her uncle as a clergyman, and to Alice as his daughter; yet she was vexed that there had been this commenccement of an inti- macy in which she had had no, share. She repeated to herself that Alice was too insignificant for her to care who noticed her, or who did not; nevertheless, she caught herself more than once wishing she had not interfered with the arrangements of the morning, but suffered her cousin to go to Waldorf with her father, instead of being left to a long and apparently very pleasant interview with the Ogilbys, and an opportunity afforded her, moreover, of contrasting their warm, cordial manner to herself, with their reserve toward her cousin. Yet, with all these reflections to try her, Gertrude was still able to follow out her most important policy,-that of soothing the wounded pride of her Cousin Gerardus, and convincing him that his peace and happiness were not a matter of indifference to her.           I It was not necessary that Alice should be an observer of the methods by which she was to accomplish this; she was therefore not asked to join them, but left to find en- tertainment for herself as best she mitght.    \ The afternoon was warm, and her uncle and aunt were both asleep. A'lice wandered around, hoping to see old Jake or some of the servants, who might be glad to have her read to them or instruct them a little. But either they had followed the example of their betters, and were liter- ally fulfilling the command to rest, or else they had all! retreated to some terra incognita, for a cool and comfort! able gossip together. -Not a living creature seemed left about the premises except the old dog, who lay basking in the sun on the back piazza. She retired to her own room, and, taking the book which   g     TWALTER OGILBY.          157 her father had recommended for her aunt's spiritual edifi- cation, occupied herself with it until she heard all again astir below stairs..oAfter awhile her aunt came up to her room. "Ally, my dear," she began, "you see how it is, don't you? I did think I was a goin' to have such a nice time with you this afternoon, but our cousins insist so on our coming down there to tea, and your uncle has got to go to talk with Cousin Abram about some business,-he is one of the partners, you know,--and it is so wery seldom I can get out anywhere. Why, Ally, before you came, I don't think I'd been out to tea half a' dozen times this spring I And Garret asked why you could not come along, and I told him no, that wouldn't do, because you'd de- clined to go to the Wan Nesses thgt mornin'. So, Ally, I thought if you wouldn't feel hurt or anything, I'd just go with- your uncle. " Alice assured her aunt that she should not feel hurt in the least. "Well then, my dear," said the poor lady, much relieved, "just come down-stairs and tell Gitty so, for she will have it that I am not treatin' you well." Alice followed her aunt, not without a slight rccollec- tion that if it was to bear the mother company; it was also to prevent the daughter's being lonely, that such a point had been made of her giving up her visit to Wal- dorf. It was easy to settle the matter, for, in fact, Gertrude cared very little whether her mother went or stayed. She had done all that was necessary to acquit herself of a share in Ally's disappointment of the morning, by making it appear that the latter's return home was simply in com- plaisance to her mother's wishes. "  &#xD;<pb n="158-159" xml:id="VAC7016-00000079"/> 158    ,   WALTER OGILBY. Aunt Aulchy had still another point to arrange. "Now I shall mlake Cousin Letty give me an early tea, that I may come back in time, and then you girls hill go with me, won't you, to the meetin' over at the Wan Worsts'?t                   ; Gertrude looked her astonishment. "You surely are not in earnest, ma'am, in expecting that I should go to any such place?" "Why not, pray? The Wan Worsts are our neigh- bors, and wery good neighbors too; and your father says we nmust keep on terms with them, because the election is comin' on, by-an'-by, and you know that is a wery impor- tant matter to him."' "I shall be under the necessity of expressing in sonme other way my sense of our neighbors' value as voters,"7 said Gertrude, with an effort to conceal her mortification at her mother's speech. "I shall be most happy to elec- tioneer for my father, but it must be in some way less dis- agreeable to myself. ' "t"That is just the way," said her mother, who was bent on carrying her point; "that is just what your father says. You look down on our neighbors, and will never. treat them with the least respect."  "My father is mistaken,?' replied Gertrude. "I have the greatest respect for the Van Vorsts. I think them admir- ably fitted for exactly the sphere in which Providence has placed them,- only,7 with a slight laugh, "it happens not to be my sphere, and I do'not incline to place myself in it. Having a circle of my own, I do not see the particular necessity of creating a new one so little to my taste." This was all aimed at Ally, whom Gertrude suspected of an intention of gratifying her mother by accompanying her to the meeting. "I don't pretend to know what your circle and your   l           ETArWALTER OGILB:.      159 sphere, as you call them,'has to do with goin' to meetin' at one of our neighbors','7 said her mother; " but this I do know, that Ally will go with me-won't you, Ally?" "Oh yes, aunty, we will both go with you. You see by Gertrude's looks that she is not in earnest." "Indeed I am," said her cousin, "thoroughly in earn- est." Mr. Westhrook spoke in a low tone to his cousin. "If you stay at home this evening from any motive of politeness to me, I shall be most happy to accompany you and your mother." Gerardus was a most devoted son, and he had not quite liked the tone of this discussion. Gertrude divined as much. "No," said she; "it is simply for my mother's sake that I am resolute,-she ought not to go." Nothing more was said, for, satisfied with Ally's con- sent, Mrs Ellsworth walked back into the parlor and an- nounced to her husband her readiness to accompany him to Cousin Vandervoort's. When they were fairly off, Gertrude felt that she must make matters quite right with Gerardus. She put on a little air of solicitude, and said,- "I really wish I could tease my poor mother out of her fancy for exposing her health by running about and pay- ing such devoted attention to all her neighbors. She is not equal to it. It is really to be lamented that, just as she is, getting a little better, she should run the risk of bringing back her old complaints by such imprudence. I, for my part, shall do all I can to dissuade her from it." Alice had seen enough of her aunt to be convinced that the best thing for her health was exercise, with occupation of mind. Feeling, therefore, that she had done right by complying with her wishes, she was the less humbled by  &#xD;<pb n="160-161" xml:id="VAC7016-00000080"/> 160       IWA LTER O (ILBI: Gertrude's covert reproof than might perhaps have been expected.                   i Aunt Aulchy, spite of the attractions of her cousin's tea-table, adhered to her plan of returning in time for the meeting. As she arrived at her own gate, she was sur- prised, and not less delighted, to observe quite a numerous company assembled on the piazza, taking their tea in the pleasant twilight.  Mr. Ogilby had not, as Gertrude fancied was his inten- tion, dined at Waldorf. He had driven over to the after- noon service, and this had given him an opportunity of bringing Mr. Morton back to Milbank. Gertrude had so courteously and pleasantly invited him to come in, and had so,earnestly insisted on his remaining and taking tea with her uncle, that he had accepted the invitation at the very moment that Dr. Hardenberg had joined the circle with the salme purpose. They were a cheerful group, for Gertrude was be t on making herself agreeable. She had not seen the doctor before since her return, and her Imanner was now particu- larly gracious to him.  Her mother had scarcely made her salutations, and ex- plained to the company the necessity she was under of quit- ting them again immediately, when turning to Gertrude she said,-                    ! "Well, Gitty, has Ally succeeded in persuading you to go with us?"' "So far from it, ma'am, that I have only been in hopes you would think better of the matter, and give up the plan entirely."  She did not speak very earnestly, for she had nqw no particular desire to keep either her mother or Alice at home. The course of her reflections for! the last ten minutes had been something to this effect:--"My uncle's visi has   it   .       WALTER OGILBtY.        161 afforded Walter Ogilby an excuse for coming here quite fami- liarly of late. As he has shown such alacrity in availing himself of it, it is evident that his backwardness heretofore has been fionom a doubt how he should be received. How fortunate that such a commencement has been made! Our position towards each other having been changed, I do not now fear for the result. I have never yet seen the man I could not conquer,--surely my powers will not fail me now.  This evening he will, naturally, remain, and, my mother and Alice absent, much may be done." The reply of her mother to her feeble remonstrance was all that she could have desired. "Oh, I must go!-I promised the Wan Worsts I would. And Ally has been so good and obligin' as to say she would go with me." Yet one more effort Gertrude felt she might venture to make. "Do not you think, doctor, it will be rather imprudent in my mother to risk going over to Mr. Van Vorst's to at- tend a meeting this evening?"I The doctor laughed heartily. "Except the probability of a greater quantity of heavy preaching than she can digest, I cannot see any danger," was his reply. Mr. Ogilby rose. "Perhaps then," he said politely to Mrs. Ellsworth, " you will allow me the pleasure of driving you and Miss Morton to Mr. Van Vorst's. I, too, am under an engagement to my friend Lebbeus to attend the service there this evening. Mr. Lyman is an old and valued ac- quaintance of mine. I shall be quite proud to carry such a reinforcement to his little congregation." Very little time was requisite to complete the preparation of the ladies, and the three had soon taken their departure. The doctor looked at Gertrude-it was with an expres- "*  &#xD;<pb n="162-163" xml:id="VAC7016-00000081"/> 162       WALTER OGILBY. sion that she could not quite interpret, yet with which she could not help feeling provoked. She therefore proposed to her Cousin .Gerardus a walk in the garden, leaving her father and her two uncles to each other's company. CHAPTER     XVIII. THE meeting at Farmer Van Vorst's was a thing exactly suited to the taste of Aunt Aulchy.  In the first place, it satisfied her conscience, and gave her an easy, comfortable, religious feeling, as if she were keep- ing holy the Sabbath day. By some sort of computation it made up for the shortcomings of'the twelve hours that had gone before. In the next place, she: was sure to meet there a class of people among whom she was the great lady,-a distinction extremely agreeable to her taste, when' it could be enjoyed without the restraints and formalities which a more polished society imposed upon her. Here she had all the advan- tage of creating a sensation, without the drawhack of having to pay for it by an extra degree of dignity; and, while feeling herself to be richer, and seeing herself better dressed than her neighbors, she could yet, in an easy, natural way, let herself down to their level, and pick up, as she found op- portunity, either before or after the service, a fund of infor- mation about their affairs in general, sufficient to beguile many a weary hour, and help out ilany a subsequent con- versation with Aunt Lany and the hosts of cousins. Itas with a feeling of supreme satisfaction that she now entered the well-lighted parlor of the good farmer, and ob- served that while the rest of the little congregation were i.   *;.          lWALTER OGILBIY        163 seated in rows on benches, or on boards placed from chair to chair, she was herself ushered to a comfortable rocking- chair, close beside the invalid mother of the huge, healthy family. Alice who, with Mr. Ogilby by her side, was installed in the next best place, saw everythng in happiest colors. vThe audience, consisting of a few of the neighboring far- ,mers' families, with nearly all the New England portion of the factory-people, were well-dressed, and intelligent and devout in their appearance. The minister was fervent in his prayers and impressive in his discourse. It was the music, however, of the simple service that touched most deeply the heart of the young listener. When the psalm had been given out, and after a few, preliminary notes from the chorister to determine "the pitch," the grand old, tune of "DELIGHTS" swelled forth from well- trained voices, infinitely surpassing in power and execu- tion anything that Alice had heard before. "No burning heats by day, No blort of evening air, Can take my strength away If God be with me there!" And when at the close of the stanza, the-thrilling fugue rolled up its full bass, "By night or noon, by night or noon- Thou art my sun and Thou my shade, To guard my head, by night or noon," the effect was entrancing-electrical-and her involuntary upward glance met a responsive one from her companion, assuring her that, like herself, he felt, from the inmost depths of his soul, the power of both the sentiment and the harmony. &#xD;<pb n="164-165" xml:id="VAC7016-00000082"/> 164       WALTER OGIL, B  The exercises finished, there was a general bustle-an introducing and a shaking of hands-an asking of questions, and an offering of civilities. Mrs. Ellsworth found many to listen with pleased interest to her account of the state of her health, and the progress of her family affairs,--of the visit she had paid to her relatives in the afternoon, of the death of one child in that neighborhood, and the expected birth of another,-with various other particulars of the wel- fare of people about whom her hearers, knowing nothing, were expected to care a great deal. Alice, accustomed by her position among her father's parishioners to find some topic of interest to each differ- ent class of people, was at no loss among her new acq aint- ance. She was soon answering satisfactorily the inqiries of the gentle hostess. "How have. you enjoyed the season? (of worship.) How do you like York State, as they call it here? What do you think of Dutchess County?"  To the sugges- tion, "you see a great many queer people here-differ- ent from what we" (with some emphasis) "have been used to in New England," Alice was forced to admit that although she had longed, and even expected, to see queer people, she had thus far been able to observe no very strik- ing peculiarities in the inhabitants. "This custom of assembling for public worship i pri- vate houses is, however, something new to me," said she. "With us, where there is to be found at least one place of worship in every hamlet, the necessity of such a se vice is unknown."  "That is very true," said Mrs. Van Vorst with pensive thoughtfulness. "That is the change one feels the most- I do miss the old Meeting-House. Then, another thing, we get very few books here to read. I have borrowed all that are to be had in the neighborfood round, and my 1',*   WALTER OGLBY.        165 minister has brought me a good many; perhaps," bright- ening up, "you have some with you that you could lend me-something serious. I once used to read aloud to iny family, but now,"--and her voice faltered,--" that day is over."  Alice spoke of the book with which she had beguiled the afternoon, and which she was sure her father would leave with Mrs. Van Vorst. "Taylor's ' Holy Living and Holy Dying'-seems to me I've heard speak of that book. Yes, I should like to read it,-it is with the latter part of it," said the invalid, in a low tone, "that I now have to do." The eldest son of the family was standing leaning against the old-fashioned clock in the corner, behind his mother's chair. An expression passed over his countenance, as she uttered the last words, which went to Alice's heart. She looked at his tall, awkward figure, and plain, sun-burnt countenance, as he suddenly moved away, with a feeling almost of reverence. What a contrast did the picture before her present to one of which she had lately been a spectator I Here, the delicate mother, surrounded by her stout, large- framed children, ally one of whom might have taken her : up in their arms and carried her without fatigue from one end of the farm to the other, yet all, "ordering themselves lowly and reverently" toward her, tending and cherishing her with filial devotion! There, in her luxurious home, the highly educated daughter grieving her less-gifted parent with her unneces- sary opposition, her sarcastic raillery, and her undutiful obstinacy! Lebbeus had made no overture towards an acquaintance with Ally beyond the offer of a hymn-book immediately on her entrance; but he had kept as steady a gaze upon  &#xD;<pb n="166-167" xml:id="VAC7016-00000083"/> ;!j     166       WALTER OGILBY. her throughout the evening as he thought, by what he had read in books, consistent with the laws of polite de- poirtment. To his sister Clarinda, Alice offered a few words of warm commendation on the excellence of the music. "Yes," said the young damsel, " we need not be ashamed of our singing. I suppose you don't often hear-better. These are the factory-hands, who practice together pretty much all their leisure time. It puts them in mind of their Yan- kee home. Cothing binds people to each other like sitting down and singing a good old-fashioned psalm-tune to- gether." As the sermon had been a long one, and the prayvers of no remarkable brevity, and as "Majesty" and "Ocean" and "Symphony" had each in turn been gone through to its appropriate array of verses, it was now time to be taking leave. The young stranger had quite won the hearts of the good people-she had only fallen short of her aunt, in omitting to compliment the new collar of Miss Clarinda, her mothers- handiwork, which, in all Ihe glory of its rich vine of sunflowers and squash-blossoms, had been donned, for the first timne, on this occasion. Mrs. Ellsworth's notice and praise of the embroidery was a civility to be remembered, and in some way or other to be paid for. The mention of the apple-fritters at Cousin Vandervoort's suggested-the suitable mode. "That's what I'll do," said Clarinda to herself; "I'll send Lebby down with a basket of our nice vanderveers, to- morrow-Mrs. Ellsworth can have -another dish of apple- fritters quite unexpected." Alice rose at an early hour the following morning. She had still some little matters to 'arrange preparatory to the departure of her father, from whom she was now  to be separated for so long a time. She began to have soime     ^WALTER OGILBY.                  167 misgivings about "the delightful summer" of which she had felt so confident on Saturday. It was only when her mind turned to Ferndale that she felt in a measure reas- sured. There all was love and peace-there she should find gentle, affectionate condescension --there she should al- ways feel as at home! But would she be permitted to go there? Was it likely that Gertrude would be invited familiarly-as much so as she felt certain she should? And if not, would not obstacles be thrown in the way of every- thing beyond a formal intercourse betw'een her and the Ogilby family? These questions made her a little uncomfortable; she wisely resolved, therefore, to dismiss them  from her thoughts. She read over once more her letters to her little sisters, and to her friends Miss Maeartnev and Kate Andrews, and she put the last finish to the packing of her father's portmanteau--and by this time was able to descend to breakfast in her usual happy, hopeful temper. The chaise was brought to the door immediately after breakfast. Alice had not seen old Garry since the day of their arrival. Was it really less than a week? Had they been at Milbank actually but six days? The time had flown very swiftly, and yet--it seemed as if a great deal had happened. "I think, for my part," observed her aunt, "brother William might better wait till to-morrow. I am almost sure we shall have a shower this afternoon. Look at that mist on the top of Solomon's Barrack I Apd when I put my head out the window this morning what should I see but all the geese a marching', Indian-file, down the lane I 'When the geese train, It's a sign of rain'- as everybody knows."   &#xD;<pb n="168-169" xml:id="VAC7016-00000084"/> "! \ , 9168         WALTER OGILBY.  Mr. Morton, however,' being anxious to return to his family and his parish, could not afford to put, faith in the proverb. He therefore took a tender leave of all, and set forward on his journey. CHAPTER XIX. NOTHNG had yet been said of returning the calls which Alice had received during her cousin's absence. She suspected that her aunt was waiting for Gertrude to sug- gest the proper time for doing so. No allusion being made to the subject, however, she ventured, while they were together in the parlor, after her father's departure, to in- quire,- "What is your custom here? Does politeness demand that visits should be returned at an early day?" "Oh, yes!" said her aunt with animation, " that is what I was just goin' to speak about. Gitty, hadn't we better go with Ally and make some wisits to-day?" "I see no occasion for such great haste," replied her daughter. "Alice had perhaps better wait until I can ac- company her. To-day} I am going, with Cousin Gerardus, to make the rounds of all our relations, to whom he natu- rally wishes to pay his respects."  "But why can't we all go together in the carriage? I am sure it would be pleasanter for Gerardus,' suggested her mother. The young gentleman, who sat by the window listening to the discussion, was far from concurring in this amend- ment. His heart had bounded at the unexpectedly gra- cious proposition of his cousin, and he was beginning to   {        .  WALTER OGILBY.         169 indulge the most delightful auguries from it,-yet his hab- itual politeness, and his sense of what was due to his aunt ard Alice, prompted him to say at once,- "Don't think of me, Cousin Gertrude. You are exceed- ingly kind to consent to a thing that would be so agreeable to me as a drive with you this morning-still, as we have other days before us, if it would gratify your mother " Poor Mr. Westhrook was perplexed: he would not, for the world, have seemed to undervalue the condescension of his cousin. Great, therefore, was his relief when Ger- trude decidedly, but very pleasantly, remarked,-- "Ally would, I am certain, on no account deprive you of the triumph of flourishing your beautiful curricle and little :blacks through the country. Such an opportunity for making a display in the eyes of our Dutch damsels may not occur again very soon. It is of no consequence whether the visits she owes are returned to-day or to-morrow. We saw the Van Nesses yesterday at church; and, as it is but three days since they called, it is to be supposed that they can wait-so, too, can others." And this matter settled, Gitty went up-stairs to prepare for her drive. When she reached her room, however, she began to weigh in her own mind the wisdom of her plan. Might not Gerardt take advantage of this occasion, and her ap- parently complaisant frame of mind, to press for a definite answer to his suit? And if so, what reply was she to give him? She did not love him ; and the idea of a quiet life at Nine Partners,-far away firom all fashion and gayety,- under the same roof, possibly, with the sober, virtuous father and mother, who would be expecting to be her oracles, was a thing she could not bear for a moment to contemplate. Still, as her influence ovgr Gerardus was unbounded, and as he possessed, by inheritance from his grandparents, a fortune sufficient to enable her to shine in 1&#xD;<pb n="170-171" xml:id="VAC7016-00000085"/>  171   the city, could he be induced to make it his residence, he was on the whole too desirable a match for her to give up decidedly, in the present aspect of affairs. She could not then resolve to discard him entirely, yet she felt that the most consummate prudence was required to manage an affair so delicate. "If Gerardus were not a relation," she argued, 1"I could accept him when he proposes, and keep the matter secret until I find what my chances elsewhere are to be. A lady is always at liberty to change her mind. But there's the mischief-being all in the family, the engagement would have to be proclaimed, and then adieu to all hope of any one else. What a pity that Anthony Van Wyck is so poor I He would be perfectly irresistible if he were only as rich as Craesus. I believe I could even give up my hopes of-of everybody else for his sake. It is, however, of no use speculating on that. I must take'care, if I mneet the poor fellow to-day, to undo the impression my gracious manner yesterday may have produced. Gerardus did not like it at all." Gertrude, in her soliloquy, could not disguise from her- self the true reason why, notwithstanding her reluctance to encourage the addresses of Mr. Westhrook, she had pro- posed driving out with him alone, and had carried out her plan so perseveringly. It was this:-she had, the evening before, overheard Mr. Ogilby, in conversation with the doctor, minention that lhe had accepted a challenge fromn his friend Teunis to give llim his revenge at chess-and that he was to go to Briar Lodge for that purpose in the course of this morning. An opportune call, just at the proper moment-an invitation to an encounter at a game in which she was known to pos- sess some skill-a resolute detention of the whole party to dinner by Miss Maria, according to invariable custom-sa   charming afternoon's discourse about books, music, and all other attractive subjects, terminating perhaps in a stroll through the garden or along the banks of the stream,- such was the panorama which moved in glowing colors before her mental vision. She could manage to dispose of Gerardus. He would have no suspicions, and might be turned over to Miss Maria or Mr. Teunis. Games of chess were very fasci- nating-once begun, they would necessarily be repeated again and again. Who could tell to what they might lead? Full of these thoughts, Gertrude applied herself to the business of making herself as captivating as possible, with- out one compunctious feeling for the misery she was pre- paring for an honest and loving heart-misery if she re- jected him--greater misery still should she accept him. Their first call was to be at the village, upon Aunt Lany. After that they would make a circuit such as would bring them to Briar Lodge at the right moment. This was Gitty's determination as they set off, leaving her mothet' and Alice to the enjoyment of each other's company. Aunt Aulchy, though not of a susceptible or a suspi- cious nature, could not divest herself of a feeling that there had been too decided a neglect of Ally's pleasure and wishes in all Gertrude's arrangements since her return. She had become warmly attached to her niece, and had found such a solace in her conversation and attentions that each day had tended to strengthen a plan which for some time had been working in her brain. This was, to bind her niece still more closely to herself by a union with her eldest son. "They must be thinkin' of it, themselves," said she, "or why did John Peter hurry off to Ashfield so, last summer, and spend almniost the whole of his furlough there? He had' been there the summer before, and if he had not had  &#xD;<pb n="172-173" xml:id="VAC7016-00000086"/> 172       WALTER OGILBY. some wery strong reason, he- wouldn't have gone again so soon-that's as plain as can be. Then he was in such a fever to have us come down to the Point just as soon as Ally got here! There-I declare-that mustlave been the wery way he knew she was a comin' just at this time! She lust have written to him. Oh I I know they've been thinkin' of this a long time--and what a nice thing it will be! To be sure, my poor brother can't give his daughter anything; but what of that? We've got plenty; and an officer in the army can never spend much besides his pay, livin' shut up, as he does, in a garrison most of the time. And then if there should be a war, and anything should happen to John Peter, Ally could come home and live with us, and her children too, if she should have any-for I'm wery fond of children I How nice that would be!" And, upon the strength of such delightful anticipations, the good lady redoubled her attentions and caresses to- ward Ally, treating her, with all the tenderness of her af- fectionate nature, as if she were already her child. Indeed, in the overflowings of her heart, she could hardly restrain herself from telling at once all she wished and all she was sure would come to pass. "But no," said she to herself, "I must be wery prudent --I mustn't let ohn-girls are so queer I And that reminds me-I wish I knew what Gitty is about with Gerardus. I can't make it out. She ought to marry him--t is high time she was married-she's most one-and-twenty."' The day was fine, though not so bright as the preced- ing ones. The roads were certainly not less dusty than they had been the day before; but Mr. Westhrook forgot to express any solicitude about his cousin's pretty bonnet as he drove his little blacks along at a speed calculated to show the whole establishment to the best advantage. Ger- trude rattled away upon various light topics, and Gerardus n . e =. *               '    W-z1 ^'-ti WtTVALITER     OGILBI .       173 followed her lead, and left the sentimental for a future mo- nent. He had the day before him, and need not be pre- cipitate. When they reached the gate of the doctor's lawn, they saw, as on the previous day, Dr. Van Wyck approaching. He called to them gayly that he would open the gate for them.* He was more smiling than usual-indeed, he seemed in the highest spirits. When they had driven through, courtesy required that Gertrude and her cousin should stop and speak to him for a moment. He almost bounded forward, shook hands not only with Gertrude, but with Mr. Westhrook, in the most cordial manner. "So much for my foolish encouragement yesterday!" said the young lady to herself. "He really seems absurdly elated by it. He must be checked, however." And she assumed a degree of cold stateliness. Dr. Van Wyck was, however, not to be repulsed. "I am conming to call on you in the course of the day, Miss Ellsworth," said he; "I am going the rounds of all my friends. I have treated'myself to a holiday--or rather, in the doctor's absence, Aunt Lany has set me free. Ha I ha I Excuse my calling her Aunt Lany,.she has just given me permission." Witha reserved bow, Gertrude requested Mr. Westhrook to drive on. "Dr. Van Wyck is somewhat familiar and ungentle- manly,' said she to her companion. "How handsome he is when he is full of animation, and what a happy flow of spirits he is in, poor fellow I'1 was her mental comment. Mrs. Hardenberg met them at the door,--she seemed to have been watching their approach. Her countenance was smiling, but her air was less tranquil than usual,-in fact, there was something a little like excitement about her. "What can be the matter?" said Gertrude to herself. 15*  &#xD;<pb n="174-175" xml:id="VAC7016-00000087"/>   174      A. 4LTR OaILB l They were hardly seated when her aunt observed,- "You mnet Anthony Van Wyck at the gate?" "Yes, and he seemed in the most preposterous spirits " "He has reason to be. He had just been to show us a letter he received this morning from his uncle in New York. You know his uncle, Counsellor Van Wyck, is as rich as a Jew and has not a child. Many have wondered that lie has not done more for his brother's family; but they are probably not aware how much he has assisted them. He writes to Anthony now to say that he has always been of opinion that boys should have nothing but their own powers to look to and depend upon in establishing themselves in life-but that, having kept a close eye on him, and ap- proved his course, and finding that he has made for him- self a standing and a reputation, he has no fears now that money can hurt him. Therefore if he wishes to marry and settle down, or. to travel, or anything of the kind, he is ready to provide handsomely for him, and to consider him hereafter as his own son. That is news that might well set a young man a little out of his wits; for, of course," said Aunt Lany, smiling, "we cannot suppose him to have reached five-and-twenty without having some plan of set- tling himself." Gertrude did not suppose Dr. Van Wyck to be without some such plan.  "And here," thought she, " have I been treating him with coldness--almost with disdain. Why could not some kind fairy have whispered this ten minutes sooner?  Shall we see him again to-day, I wonder? For, after all, we may miss Walter Ogilby." Full of these perplexing thoughts, and agitated by uncer- tainty as to what course it was most politic to pursue; Ger- trude was impatient to shorten her call, and procebd to their other places of destination. "He said Aunt Lany, and seemed inclined to boast that   WALTER OGILBY.    she had given him permission to do so I What can that mean? Had he been telling her his hopes that she would one day be his aunt?" 'sbe asked herself. No hint from Aunt Lany, however, enlightened her, and she was left to her own instinct as a pilot, or else to the developments which time and circumstances might vouch- safe for her guidance. ' They were next to go to the Vandervoorts'-"- the Or- chards," as the young people were fond of calling it, in spite of the resistance of the owner, who disliked innovations, and who maintained that " his own name was good enough for his own house and land."'     I They were not fated to proceed without interruption. A little beyond Milbank they were met by Dr. Hardenberg. He called to them to inquire if they had heard the news. "About Anthony Van Wyck? Yes; but where did you hear it. " "Oh! I saw the young gentleman awhile since, and he toldme " A short conversation ensued, during which Gitty thought the doctor looked at her more scrutinizingly than was neces- sary or agreeable-she wondered what it could mean. There seemed no one at home at Cousin Vandervoort's except the two youngest daughters. The elder sisters had gone with Garret to make a distant visit. "Phillippina and mother were much engaged, but if Cousin Gertrude would take off her bonnet and let the horses be put up, they would be in by-and-by."               r "Some fuss -about housekeeping, probably," was the ex- planation of Gertrude to herself; but she was rejoiced to be thus spared the necessity of a long call. She left Gerardus to entertain the two young girls, and walked to a window that looked out upon the garden. She was not a little sur- prised to perceive Cousin Abraham and Dr. Van Wyck    &#xD;<pb n="176-177" xml:id="VAC7016-00000088"/> ;i!!    17 i6      WALTER OGILB I2 walking slowly up and down in a distant, shady part of the grounds. They seemed in deep consultation. "Is not your father well?" asked she of her cousins. "Yes; perfectly well. Why?" "Because I thought I saw Anthony Van Wyek's horse tied at the gate as we came in." "Upon my word," she could not help saying to herself, "he intends to call upon the world at large for sympathy in his good fortune. Very natural, perhaps; but, it nlust be confessed, not particularly dignified. ':   CHAPTER XX. GERTRUDE and her cousin arrived at Briar Lodge at the happiest moment. The two gentlemen were seated at chess in the small library opening from the parlor, and through the door they might be seen by the visitors as they entered. Miss Maria received them; and, full of friendly, hospita ble animation, was soon calling,- "Here, Teunis, you must leave your game now. Here are Miss Ellsworth and Mr. Westhrook," which gaye the young-lady an opportunity of raising her voice in earnest remonstrance. "No, indeed! not for the world would I suffer a chess- player to leave his game on my account. Sit still, I beg of you, Mr. Van Benthuysen; we will come in and look at you presently." And she soon walked in, followed by the others. "Do not let us distract your attention," she said; "I  : :A        WALTER  OGILBY.        17 7 fl * . , shall merely look to see which has the best of the game, and smile to ensure him success." "That is womllan's way, all the world over," cried Mr. Teunis, with a laugh. "Favors for the fortunate; the maxim of the ancient conquerors should be differently worded-it should be ' To the victor belong the smiles. "' Gertrude tried to read the expression of Mr. Ogilby's countenance as he listened to this thadinage. She thought it was slightly sarcastic, but could not quite determine whether it were not rather an effort to resist her fascina- tion. Miss Maria, was beginning with eager questions about the health of all at Milbank. "But why did you not bring your pretty cousin with you? What a sweet creature she is!" "I should not have expected so unguarded a move as that last, friom you," said Mr. Teunis to his antagonist; "but I cannot aford to be generous." And he hastened to take advantage of it. "There I I see we are doing mischief; we must desert the field," said Miss Maria. Gertrude could not repress a feeling of exultation, for she saw that Mr. Ogilby had been thrown off his guard by her presence. She whispered to her friend,- "Take Gerardus with you, and show him your plants- anything-I will watch the game in the most discreet silence." Miss Maria did as she was requested. Gerardus looked back for his companion; but with an expression almost of impatience, she signed him to follow their hostess, and he obeyed. The game went on, slowly and in silence. Neither gen- 'tleman looked up. Mr. Ogilby had lost so much by his false move that it seemed hardly possible he should re- trieve the game. He was, however, the better player of   &#xD;<pb n="178-179" xml:id="VAC7016-00000089"/> 178 .      WALTTR OGITLB . '!    the two, and he gradually regained the advantage; his moves became more and more assured; the result could' now hardly be doubtful. '"How perfectly he sees into his opponent's play!" was Gertrude's thought. "I should hardly dare to encounter him. If we enter the lists for a higher stake, will he be equally penetrating? What if I make an encounter with him this morning a criterion I The same qualities are necessary in each game; shall the result of the one augur that of the other?" So intensely had she become absorbed in watching Mr. Ogilby's play, and comparing her own powers with his, that she actually started when, after a few judicious moves, she heard the firml tones of his voice " check-mate." "Yes," said Mr. Teunnis rising, "but I do' not acknowl- edge beat. There werie two playing against le. Miss Gertrude did not say a word, but I felt her adverse influ- ence-she was wishing you success all the time. Let me see her pitted against you now. Come, Miss Gertrude, do oblige me by beating this young man in the shortest time possible." Mr. Teunis had played often with Gertrude and knew the strength of her game. She hesitated. She could not divest herself of a feeling that there would be a sort of destiny in this encounter-an omen of the future contest she was meditating, and she was not sure that she was equal to her antagonist. She had a suspicion that Mr. Ogilby was occupied with some thought like her own, for he did not second the proposal of his friend Teunis as warmly as, in her opinion, politeness required. She there- fore said, as if disclaiming,- "Oh! I am too indifferent a player for a gentleman to think it worth his while to beat me; and, besides, I must find your sister; my cousin and I are out on a tour of visits this morning."   "- :S'r!'!;ig  ' WALTER OGILBY.       \  Miss Maria, who was just entering with Mr. Westhrook, overheard the last words. "No-no, indeed!" cried she, "no more visits this morning. When you have finished your game with Walter, you are going to give us some music, and by that time dinner will be ready. I can take no denial; you can make the rest of your calls in the even- ing." And she approached her visitor and began untying her bonnet. "But what does cousin Gerardus say?" "What?". exclaimed Miss Maria. "Why, whatever cousin Gertrude says, of course. What else should a gallant man say? He will not be disposed to make ob- jections, for he wants to walk out to the meadow after dinner, to see a new kind of grass Teunis, has, that is al- most ready now for cutting, and which I have been recom- mending for his father to cultivate; and Mr. Ogilby will go with them, and tell Mr. Westhrook something of his new experiments." Thu urged, Gertrude saw that she could with propriety do-What she had, from the first, determined to do. She suffered herself to be persuaded, and announced to her cousin her intention to remain and dine at Briar Lodge. Mr. Ogilby had by this time all the pieces set, and by some slight courteous phrase indicated that he awaited the honor of commencing the proposed encounter. "A woman plays such a weak, negative game!" ob- served Gertrude, as she seated herself. "Which only makes defeat at her hands the more morti- fying," was Mr. Ogilby's quiet reply. Gertrude played with her utmost skill. It is to be sup- posed that Mr. Ogilby did the same; nevertheless the lady Came off the conqueror. The two other gentlemen looked on, deeply interested. Miss Maria was absent " on hos- pitable thoughts intent." k' h                 r   &#xD;<pb n="180-181" xml:id="VAC7016-00000090"/> 180       WALTER OGILBY.            i  "I claim no credit," said Gertrude; "you gave me the 'game." "Indeed," said Mr. Ogilby, "I never carry my polite- ness so far, even to a lady." "I am sorry to detract from your triumph, Miss Ger- trude, but I really agree with you," said Teunis. "Walter was not quite himself." "Pardon me," said Mr. Ogilby; "I did my very best.  Shall we try another game?" "Certainly, if you will," said Gertrude, striving to sub- due the elation of her feelings at a triumph so unhoped for.  This time, Mr. Ogilby applied himself more earnestly than before: it was evident that he was anxious to win. "Does he attach the same importance to the result that I cannot help doing?" thought Gertrude, "and will he yield to the omen?" Mr. Ogilby played more slowly, more cautiously than before. There was something so bold, so fearless in Ger- trude's mode of attack-for she always took the offensive -she brought such an amount of artil!ery to bear, that, spite of his skill and his clear-sightedness, the result was the same as before. Mr. Ogilby was again check-mated. "I think I will let you rise now, Walter," said Mr. Teu- nis. "Miss Ellsworth has fully avenged me." Mr. Ogilby made no reply, but went on'setting the men again in their places. Gertrude was a little surprised. "How unwillingly he yields to his destiny!" said she to herself. "Are you wearied?" he inquired, looking gravely up. "A lady wearied of triumph!" exclaimed she, with a smile. This game was longer than the preceding ones. Mr. Van Benthuysen would fain have watched it throughout,  t          FWA1LTER OGILBY.       181 but Mr. Westhrook had become restless and soon drew him away into the parlkr, to talk of farming and various other topics, all as foreign as possible from the subject by which the hospitable bachelor's thoughts were just then en- grossed. Time stole on, and still the game was not fin- ished. The gentlemen in the parlor occasionally ventured, almost on tiptoe, to survey its progress. The contest was so close that it was impossible to tell which would be winner. "Ten to one on the lady,' whispered Mr. Westhrook, who, in spite of his annoyance, could not help feeling a pride in his cousin's success. "You will see that Walter will come out ahead in the last heat; he will take the cup," responded Mr. Teunis, in the same sportsman's jargon. Miss Maria entered the parlor with some little bustle at the moment that Gertrude and Mr. Ogilby walked in silently from the library. Her face was flushed, and her eye even more brilliant than usual, but there was no smile on her countenance. Mr. Ogilby's air was quiet and satisfied. "How has it gone?" cried Miss Maria and her brother at once. "Miss Ellsworth has been merciful, and has not pushed her victory to the utmost; she yielded me the last game." "I must quote your own words," said Gertrude, with a little emphasis. "I did my best." ' You play so admirably that victory is no common triumph,;" said Mr. Ogilby. Gertrude would have given the world to know if there was more hidden in his words than met the ear,-if he felt that they were actually, as Mr. Teunis expressed it, "pitted against each other." 16  &#xD;<pb n="182-183" xml:id="VAC7016-00000091"/> 182       WALTER OGILBY.            "After such a keen engagement, I hope you *ill both enjoy your dinner," said Miss Maria. Her brother and Mr. Westhrook were still commenting on the games, and the former was complimenting Gertrude upon her skill, which, he maintained, was, however the last game might have gone, greater than her antagonist's. While forcing herself to reply in a gay, animated strain, such' as she hoped would conceal her real chagrin, she was not unobservant of Mr. Ogilby's movements.  Shle saw him draw near Miss Maria's work-table and take from it a book in a handsome and somewhat peculiar binding. She caught his inquiry, "Have you finished with it?" and her answer, "Certainly, and ought to have returned it long ago." He put the book in his pocket. Then, to the surprise of all the party, he prepared to take leave. "What is this? You are not going, surely!" cried Miss Maria. "Indeed I cannot excuse you; you must stay and dine with us." "That will be quite impossible," said Mr. Ogilby. "I have an engagement that I cannot by any means break through." Spite of arguments and entreaties, from Mr. Teu nis as well as his sister, Mr. Ogilby went, to the very great regret of all present save one--Gerardus was glad he was gone.   WALTER OGILB Y.   183   CHAPTER    XXI. BRTAR LODGE was not the-only scene of excited and earn- est feeling this day. An animated discussion had taken place at the -breakfast-table of Farmer Van Vorst, of which the young visitor at Milbank had formed the chief topic. "Such a sweet, pretty young creature! So piouS and so feeling for those that are suffering!" said the indalid mother. "And don't seem to have a single bit of pride or am- bition!" remarked the father. (This was meant as a com- pliment.) "Nobody would think she was own cousin to Gitty," was the comment of Miss Clarinda, who always punished that young lady's haughtiness by nicknaming her, behind her back. "She's a hundred times handsomer to look at than Gitty," said Lebbeus, ' and a thousand tinmes prettier be- haved. There's no scorn about her,-just as modest and sociable as the lilies of the valley." Lebby glanced around to observe the effect of his poet- ical simile. "Clary, why don't you go and call on her, and ask her here to tea?" Miss Clarinda had a great deal of good sense,-her judgment was the guide of the family. Her father con- sulted her in all matters relating to the farm. Her mother had long resigned into her hands the entire charge of the household i Her brother Lebbeus regarded her, in refer- ence to matters and things in general, as an oracle.  &#xD;<pb n="184-185" xml:id="VAC7016-00000092"/> 184       IWAALTER OGILBF.  "Do you suppose, Lebby," said she, " that Miss Mor- ton's cousin Gitty would let her come here to tea'? I think I see her when the invitation -is given I 'Taking tea with a plain farmer!' she would say, with a toss of her head." And Miss Clarinda made a pretty successful imita- tion of what would undoubtedly have been Gert ude's manner upon the occasion. "Miss Gitty has forgotten that her grandfather ,vas a plain farmer once, like the neighbors round here," said Mr. Van Vorst. "When people's purses grow long, their memories grow short," remarked Miss Clarinda, sententiously.  "You can't say that of her mother, I'm sure," inter- posed the farmer's wife. "Nobody is fonder of a bee, or a quilting, or anything of that kind, than she is, when her daughter is away from home." "Well, Clary, what do you say?" asked Lebbeus, anx- iously. "I say then, since we want the Ellsworths here so much, the best thing is to have a quilting and try whether they will come. We may as well ask a' few others besides them, and then, at any rate, we shall get our quilting done,7" said Miss Clarinda, with a significant laugh. "Well, Clary, I can't say that I think as you do. I guess they will be right pleased to come.  Can you get up a quilting now, right off? There's no use, you know, in dilly-dallying." "Oh, we are always ready to have a quilting, Lebby. I dare say mother has not less than six or seven coverlids pieced out, in that little corner cupboard of hers. She's like that woman, in the book she was reading to us last winter, whose husband complained she would have four spare counterpanes to each bed. No, Lebby, there's no trouble about the quilt; that's not it."   "What is the trouble, then?" "In getting the people you make the party for, to come to it." "Well, Clary, we can try at any rate. Can you have it to-morrow?" "As well then as any time." "Then," said Lebby, briskly, "you just put on your things and go down with me to Milbank, when I go to carry your basket of apples to Mrs. Ellsworth. You will manage the business of the invitations better than I can." "I dare say I shall," observed his sister, dryly. "I shall be-cute enough, however, to go up to the village first and get the promise of the doctor and his wife, and a few others. Mrs. Ellsworth likes to go where she will see a good many acquaintances." The younger sisters, with the domestics, were set to work to make the necessary arrangements for the expected entertainment, and Miss Clarinda prepared to accompany her brother. "What on earth has got into Lebby, mother?"  whis- pered she, as she observed the alacrity with which he stepped off, to array himself in his Sunday suit. "Now be sure, Clary," said he, turning back when he reached the door, "do make them have everything nice and genteel ' "Yes, yes-you go along, Lebby," said his sister, laugh- ing and winking at her mother; "we'll have everything right--you shall have nothing to be ashamed of." "What has come over the boy, mother?" said she, as soon as he had closed the door. "He seems clear pos- sessed about Mrs. Ellsworth's niece; and what good is it going to do him, I wonder?" "Why, Clary, my daughter, what makes you talk so? I 16*   &#xD;<pb n="186-187" xml:id="VAC7016-00000093"/> 186       WALTER OGILB I.            am, sure I don't see what there is so much out of the way, in his taking a fancy to such a pretty young girl. She does not look down upon him as her cousin or sonme of her fine friends might be foolish enough to do. She has got sense enough not to be governed by outside show, and if Lebby can make her like him, I'm sure it's worth trying for."  "But, mother, he can't, that's all that there is about it. That girl was never cut out for a farmer's wife-and it's  not at all likely she'd ever think of taking a fancy to Lebby. It's my opinion that if he looks to his own comnfort, he'll let the matter drop before he takes it up." The mother was hurt at this suggestion. She was not as clear-sighted as her daughter. She was very ambi tious for her children, but particularly proud of her eldest  son, and seeing daily all his excellent qualities in their strongest light, she could not understand that any one  could help admilliring and loving him. If this young per- son once comes to know Lebby," skid she, " she will soon  find out that he has something better than good looks or ' fine manners .to recommend him-sonmething that will  : make her happy all the days of her life. I believe I could ; die happy, if I could see Lebby well married and settled I in life. As for his being settled on his own farm-that is  what he means to do, married or not, as soon as ever he gets his house done."                ? ,Miss Clarinda had" nothing further to oppose to what her mother might advance, and when' Lebbeus had made his toilet to his satisfaction, the two set out for the vil- lage. There were various little errands to be attended to, as well as sundry invitations to be given out, so that the brother and sister did not arrive at Milbank until after dinner. Mrs. Ellsworth was in extacies with the basket  H   WALTER OGILBY.        1S7 of Vanderveers, and so amiably was she disposed by the sight of it, that she accepted unconditionally the invita- tion to the quilting on the following afternoon. "And Ally will go with me too, of course. I cannot answer for Gitty---maybe she has some engagement- she most always has. Did you say sister Lany and the doctor had promised? The doctor called in this mornin' but I didn't see him. I was attendin' to Dinah makin' some olycooks. Not that I often have such work about on Monday, but we had to be cleanin' house all last week; so as my nieces are a comin' up from York in a day or two, and Cornel'us will be home from school this week, we must have our closets, full of good things, you know. Ally, dear, won't you tell Silvy to bring a plate of them olycooks for Miss Clary? I dare say they aren't half as good as yours: all your cookin' is so beautiful-the doctor always speaks of it. And that puts me in mind-Ally, you saw the doctor, I believe, when he was here this mornin' I did not think to ask you what he said-did he tell you any news??" "No, aunty-he said he had some to tell you, but as you were engaged he would keep it till to-morrow." "Mercy on us! why did not you come and call me at once?" "You said, you know, that you could not possibly be disturbed for anybody." "Yes, but I did not mean that I could not leave off for such a thing as that I Why did not you get him to tell you what it was?" "If it had been anything he wished me to know, aunty, he would have told me without my asking." "Did he say who, or what it was about?" "No," said Alice, laughing; " he simply said, Tell your aunt T had a great piece of news for her; but since she is<pb n="188-189" xml:id="VAC7016-00000094"/> 188       WALTER OGICBI            i so busy, I will keep it till to-morrow; and then he went t away immediately."   "Well, he won't keep it till' to-morrow, for I shall ride i up to his house after tea and find out. I dare say it's ; about John Peter, or Cornel'us or somebody or othei. I ' feel wery much worried-I think the doctor has done wery wrong to worry me so."  "It was no bad news, aunty, that you may depend upon, for he was smiling and happy all the time."      "Oh! then it's just one of his tricks, and I'll think no  more about it."  A little more conversation ensued between Mrs. Ills- worth and her guests, during which time Lebbeus sat bolt - upright on his chair, his new brown beaver hat resding  upon his knees, and tightly clasped in his two large hands,  as if he were afraid it would make some convulsive effort to got away from him. Alice was scarcely alive to the plainness of his features or the awkwardness of his atti-  tudes. She remembered what she had heard of the ster-  ling and excellent qualities of his character, and while she looked upon him with respect, she exerted herself to enter-  tain him agreeably. The brother and sister at length rose  to go.  "Take another olycook," said Mrs. Ellsworth.  "' Well, I don't care if I put one or two in my satchel," said Miss Clarinda. "Mother sets so much by everything  that comes from a neighbor's." And the bag having re- ceived from Aunt Aulchy's hands a generous supply, the  guests took their departure. At the gate they were stopped by a gentleman on horse- back. Alice at a glance recognized Fingal and his mas;er. The latter dismounted, and, after a few minutes' conversa- tion with Lebbeus and his sister, came toward the house.  "Oh, Ally I I do hope Walter Ogilby did not see me,"   1          WALTER OGILB.     J    189 said her aunt, in a low hurried tone. "I must run away- I have not had my nap, and I am so tired, fussin' with them olycooks all the mornin'. I will just slip out-I don't think he'll stay long, and if he does andyou get tired, you  may come and call me. Oh, dear I am so sorry I can't  stay and help you entertain him." And she made good her retreat just in time to allow Mr. Ogilby a full view of her stout figure flying through the  door, which she closed with a bang behind her.' CHAPTER    XXII. MR. OGILBY'S chief errand to Milbank this afternoon was not to bring the volume of Scottish ballads which he had taken from Miss Maria's work-table, and which Alice on the evening of her visit to Ferndale had expressed a wish to see. He had seized upon this pretext and this occasion with a purpose far more important. He was, as the doctor had with satisfaction remarked to himself, "in earnest," very much in earnest. He felt that Alice Morton was already k" to him an object of the deepest interest-that her personal endowments, her sweet unaffected manners, her sentiments and disposition, and, above all, her devout religious princi-  ples, made her all that his heart, his fancy, or his judgment could desire,-in short, he could picture to himself no happiness but in winning her for his own. When he first became aware of the nature of his feelings X -when he could no longer disguise from himself that they were such as he fiad never known for woman before-there  &#xD;<pb n="190-191" xml:id="VAC7016-00000095"/> 190       WAL5 T1ER O ILB Y         I rose up in his memory the adjuration of his dying fatter: i "My son, never give your heart until you are certain thiat you are interfering with the rights of no other person." Upon this point, still so uncertain, it was of vital import- ance to ascertain the truth, while his peace of Inind Was yet in his own power. Not philosophy but principle urged e him to an endeavor to satisfy himself in regard to -he  question, before it should be too late. Yet how was he to proceed? He had known Alice!ut a week, and although during that time scarcely a day \ad passed without bringing them into each other's societyl it had been in the presence of others, and almost always under circumstances which forbade any effort on his part to recommend himself particularly to her. He could not determine whether she had divined his sentiments toward her. Her first shyness, almost aversion toward him, which he had not been slow to perceive, had indeed worn off: her manner was often playful, sometimes almost confiding, yet there was nothing in'it which indicated the slightest consciousness of the admiration she had inspired. If S he was a coquette she would, he knew, have detected what he had been at no pains to hide; but she was, as he saw, truly modest, and he loved her the more for the very un- consciousness which discouraged his hopes. There were other considerations to perplex him. Alice was almost a stranger. He knew nothing of her previous history--she might have another attachment, she might now be engaged I "But if she loved another," he said to himself, " would she be so gay and light-hearted, so contented in the pros- pect of spending three months away from him, in a strange home? If her heart were preoccupied, would not her manner, at least at times, be so also?" These doubts and questions disturbed Mr. Ogilby's peace.   IWALTER OGIL3BY.        191 He must seek a solution, the only opportunity for which, he believed, would be found in an interview, untroubled by the observant eyes of Gertrude, or, if possible, of any other person. Such an interview he had planned for the coming Saturday, but in the present state of his feelings, it seemed long to wait. A happy idea: was suddenly suggested by Gertrude's consent to remain and dine at Briar Lodge, and finish with her cousin their round of visits later in the day. He would go to Milbank. - He would see Alice alone,--yes, alone, for Aunt Aulchy, even if awake, would be no hin- drance to his observations. And it was only to observe that he was going; he had no intention of addressing her; he had no right to do so, upon so short an acquaint- ance. He would lead Alice to talk of her home, of the whole circle at Ashfield. He was certain he could detect if she had any tie there stronger than that which bound her to her father and sisters. iHe would turn the conversation upon his own particular friends, and lead her to speak of hers. He should thus, he doubted not, elicit all he wished, or all he feared to know. No exit was ever more grateful, though there may have been some more graceful, than that of Aunt Aulchy, as s we have described it. The manner of it would suffi- ciently have accounted for the somewhat deepened color with which Alice met her visitor. Her embarrassment soon wore off, however, as she received and returned the first few salutations, and,as she looked over the pages of the book which he had brought her. Among the views of Scottish scenery, with which Mr. Ogilby had been entertaining her on the Friday evening previous, one of AIKWOOD, the residence of Michael Scott, had particularly interested her. An allusion to the wizard, &#xD;<pb n="192-193" xml:id="VAC7016-00000096"/> 192       WALTER OGILB. i: as portrayed by the "Minstrel infirm and old," had re- minded Mr. Ogilby of a ballad celebrating other feats of the Warlock, a ballad of which Alice had not before heard, and be had promised to get the book containing it from Miss Van Benthuysen, to whom itrhad been loaned. It was this which he had now brought her. "Shall I read the ballad to you?"' asked Mr. Ogilby.  Alice assented, and, taking her work-basket, she drew i up to the little table near the window. He also seated himself, in just such a position that he could look full upon her at every interval during the reading. He would rather she had left her embroidery alone, for he found that it oc- cupied her attention, and she did not raise her eyes as often as he could have wished. After the ballad was finished, and had been followed by two or three others, he went on turning over the leaves of the volume, and reading out, here and there, a stanza or a line that particularly struck him. Alice listened, commenting occasionally; but she stitched away, rather more diligently, he thought, than the occasion required.  J             i "I do not think," she observed, at length, "that the ballads of your favorite land, however touching, are, after all, very complimentary to the ladies." "In what respect?"              - "I observe they are almost all founded upon some in- ? stance either of falsehood or cruelty in our sex." "You must remember that the poet would naturally select the causes which, beyond all others, most surely stir up the depths of feeling. Coldness and deceit, from' those we love, are the two most fruitful-perhaps the poet would say the two most frequent-sources of sorrow and despair."  "It may be so. I suppose you and the poet are right,    '     " -       " * g-   I         WALTER OGILBY.        ' 193 though having met with nothing in the course of my happy existence to prove the truth ofyour remark, I must take it on trust. It would never have occurred to me to have written a ballad founded upon either." "You may well call your existence a happy one, if such has- been your experience. A man is said to be blest, if he can number three true friends. Your catalogue seems a- far more numerous one." "Oh, yes," said Alice, laughing. "I believe it embraces all Ashfield,-at least I have no reason to think other- wise." "But the members of your list do not all stand upon the same footing,-you have your favorites?" Mr. Ogilby congratulated himself upon the tact with which he was approaching the critical point. "Oh, yes,--favorites? Certainly; my own family, of course, first of all--"This was said with an air of great sincerity. "Then my friend Kate Andrews and her brother -and Miss Macartney, I think she comes next. After her--" Alice paused to consider. "Miss Andrews' brother stands in a very enviable posi- tion. Is he a fine young man?" "He is a very excellent young man; not quite equal to his sister, perhaps, in point of abilities; but then Kate is a very uncommon girl. I wonder you have not met James Andrews in New Haven; he has been there a good deal lately. Indeed, I dbn't think he has finished his law stud- ies there yet." "James Andrews!" said Mr. Ogilby, musing.  "The name sounds familiar. A very handsome young man, is not he?" "Handsome? Oh, no, not in the least. James is good, as good as possible, but no one can call him handsome. IT  &#xD;<pb n="194-195" xml:id="VAC7016-00000097"/> 194       }WALTER OGILBY. I  He might, by some, be considered rather a heavy young man; but he is, in fact, far from wanting sense; and he is such an exemplary young man, so truly respectable." Mr. Ogilby was perfectly at ease on the score of Mr. James Andrews. No young lady ever bestows on her lover the epithet " respectable."' The "Book of Ballads"' had been for a time laid aside. Alice now took it up. "Ah I here," said she, " is an old friend, or rather the resemblance of an old friend--' The Demnon Lover.' It is like one our old nurse used to sing to me. I have never before seen anything like it in print. There are, however, I observe, some points of difference. In my ver- sion of the story there is no glamourie." "Sing it to me, will you? You know I delight in old ballads. " "' It would never do to sing it," said Ally, lauglingr. "It would wake my aunt, or at the least give her frightful dreams, I fear. ^ But, if you like, I will repeat it to you. I must premise, however, that my ballad has a much less thrilling title than -this in your book. It is simply called ' The House-Carpenter.' " With a grace and feeling peculiarly her own, Alice then repeated the following BALLAD. "Oh! where have you been, my own, own love, These seven long years and more?" "I've been a sailing the salt, salt sea, To many a foreign shore. "And what has happened to you, my dear, Since I've to sea been gone?" "Oh! I have got married to a house-carpenter, And I have a fair young son." s    .  .     ,       4   i             WALTER   OGILBI'          195 He turned him round to hide his grief, For the tears fell bitterly- "Oh! had I but known, before I came home, a ;        You ne'er had set eyes on me. "I might have had a king's daughter, Far, far beyond the sea, And wealth of gold that could not be told Which I scorned for the sake of thee. "Won't you forsake your house-carpenter And go along with me? I'll carry you where the grass grows green-- On the banks of sweet Italy." "If I forsake my house-carpenter And go along with thee, It's what have you got to keep me upon When we're away to sea?" "Oh! I have got six ships at sea All sailing for dry land, And a hundred and ten of the bravest, valiant men, All shall be at your command." Then she took up her sweet and pretty babe And kisses gave it three, Saying, "Lie you there, my sweet and pretty babe, All for your father's company." She dressed herself in rich array, Most glorious to behold, And as she walked along the strand, She shone like glittering gold. They had not been two months at sea, Two months, or scarcely three, When she thought on her sweet and pretty babe, And she wept most bitterly. "Oh! are you weeping for gold?" he says, "Or are you weeping for fee? Or, are you weeping for your house-carpenter That you love so much better than me?"  &#xD;<pb n="196-197" xml:id="VAC7016-00000098"/> 196         WALTER OGILB :Y. "No; I'm not weeping for gold," she says, "Nor am I weeping for fee- But I'm weeping for my sweet and pretty babe That. I left when I came with thee." "Oh! held your tongue, oh! hold your tongue, My lady dear," said he- "I'll carry you where the grass grows green, To the banks of fair Italy." They had not been three, months at sea, Three months, or scarcely four, When under the deck there sprung up a leak, And they never were heard of more. "There is, as you say, no ' glamourie' in your ballad," said Mr. Ogilby, after a pause of a moment or two. "The catastrophe seems to have been simply a visitation of Pro- vidence upon a dereliction of duty. There is not the romantic revenge of the ' Demon Lover,' or of another hero, James Herries, whose history yours, perhaps, resembles still more. Hear what the latter says,-- 'Ye'se ne'er be buried in Scottish ground, Nor land ye'se ne'er mair see; I brought you away to punish you For the breaking your vows to me. " "There it is, again," said Alice, a little indignantly. "It is always the lady who is inconstant. It seems to me, if the lover stayed away' seven long years and more,' the lady did not deserve so sore a punishment for making another choice. " "It appears that she hardly waited out the full seven years," said Mr. Ogilby, smiling  "And if she forgot her constancy for a time, it asserted itself in the end. You observe that as soon as she is satisfied that her first lover has 'six ships at sea' and plenty 'to keep her upon,' she is /- '                        .F     S  I WALTER OGILBY.             19 quite readv to desert her husband and her 'sweet and pretty babe,' and depart for fair Italy.." Alice shook her head. "I think it very shocking in you to talk so," she said. "One thing is certain--these ballads are all written by your sex. If we were to make a record of our-wrongs, what oceans of tears you would have to l : shed over your own pictures!" This was said playfully and led to an answer in a simi- lar strain from Mr. Ogilby-a defence against the charge brought that his sex were less constant that hers,-with the opinion expressed more seriously, that there would be fewer cases of disappointment and unhappiness, if promises were made lmore cautiously, and if the judgment entered more than the mere fancy into the decision of a choice for life. "Do you think a person, then, always and irrevocably bound by a promise of this kind?" asked Alice. "By no means. But the word once given, nothing but a consideration strong as death can justify its being brokern. There may be a change so serious-not a change of opinion or affection--but such an actual, radical change of character in one party as is sufficient to absolve the other from the most solemn promises." "But do not you think that a person may, perhaps, make a promise in early years which, when the reason and judg- ment are more matured, they find reason to regret?"' Mr. Ogilby looked at her a moment anxiously. "Was she putting her own case?" he asked himself. But no; her clear, candid brow gave no token of con- sciousness or embarrassment. "I believe the promises of childhood, or even of very early youth," said he, " are foolish and mischievous in the extreme. Parents cannot be too watchful over those com- mitted to their care, to prevent anything of the kind.

Their obligation nmust therefore be a very questionable matter." CHAPTER    XXIII. MR. OGILBY had said to himself, that could he once be assured that Alice Morton's heart was not another's, he would rest contented in the hope of gaining it for himself in time,- by the love and devotion he would show her. But he had miscalculated the strength of his own philos- ophy. He was now as far from satisfied as ever. He could not but marvel at himself for having ever proposed to stop short at such a moderate degree of conviction. No-he could not go away without something further. It would be a difficult matter, he was forced to own, to elicit any symptom of a preference he had not yet asked for-still he must make the effort. The conversation had turned from books to flowers- here Mr. Ogilby was at home. He drew toward him a vase that stood upon the table: it contained one of the bouquets that had been brought from Ferndale three days before. "How long they have lasted!' said he. "I was going to show you one of by choicest flowers-a crimson ranuncu- lus. It was lately sent me from my favorite country, as you rightly call it,-the land of my forefathers. But I do not see it here." He turned t he vase around, lifting the overhanging leaves.     "It was not among those," said Alice; "those are the flowers which Michael tied up for us." i ',7 ;', .    WALTER OGILBY.:        199 Mr. Ogilby knew very well that the crimson ranunculus was not among the flowers that Michael had gathered. "It would hardly have lasted until now," he said, care- lessly: "the leaves mullst have fallen by this time." "The flowers that were already blown, have dropped," said she, innocently; " but there was a bud which has since come out, and it is very fresh still." He glanced around the room.  The flowers he had gathered and presented to her were nowhere to be seen: they were then treasured elsewhere. His heart beat quickly. Now, indeed, he had gained something- he 1^ would ask for no more, at present. It was well he had arrived at this sage conclusion, for the door at this moment opened, to admit the mistress of the mansion. Mr. Ogilby instinctively moved a little farther from the table, from the vase of flowers, and' from Alice. As the good lady entered, he rose and went forward to greet her. "Oh! I did not expect to find you here," said she; " but it's wery good in you, I'm sure. Ally, dear, how did you contrive not to feel sleepy this warm afternoon? Why, goodness I there's your horse, Mr. Walter, out in the hot sun all this time Why did not you let Jake take him up to the barn? I'll call him now." "I did not think my visit had been so unconscionably long," said Mr. Ogilby; "but do not order my horse away, if you please. I must wish you a good afternoon, and set a my face homeward,-I think we are going to have rain." Mrs. Ellsworth pressed him to remain; and, forgetting jall the prognostics of the morning, persisted in assuring him that the clouds would blow over, offering as an addi- tional inducement, the assurance that Gerardus and Gitty would soon be back. He was resolute, however, in de- clining the invitation.  &#xD;<pb n="200-201" xml:id="VAC7016-00000100"/> 200       WALTER OGILBEI It did not rain, and Aunt Aulchy was able to carry out the plan which she had only iost sight of' while asleep. She drove, after tea, accompanied by Alice, to the doctor's, and there she had the satisfaction of learning the great se- cret of Anthony Van Wyck's good fortune--of predicting that he would marry and settle right off-and of wonder- ing who he would make choice of. "He can't have Ally, that's one thing certain; she is spoken for," was her concluding exclamation. Ally started and blushed-the doctor turned suddenly round and looked inquiringly at her. "Who has spoken to you for me, aunty?" asked she, with a laugh. "I am sure nobody has spoken to me."- But, true to her resolution of " not lettin' on," her aunt contented herself with looking extremely knowing, and re- marking in a mysterious way,- "Oh-l wery well-it's no consequence just now: we shall see." And then walked off to the neighboring pantry, where her sister Hardenberg happened to be at the moment. "What does your aunt mean?" asked the doctor, who had his own reasons for wishing to understand what was going forward. "She means nothing at all. She probably thought it would please me to hear it said that some one had pro- posed for me. She has by this time undoubtedly forgotten that she has uttered a word of the kind. I only hope," said she, laughing, "that she will remember never to think of it again." Aunt Aulchy's remark had, however, as thie doctor  tothought, come out too heartily and naturally to be a joke; he wanted to understand it. "Perhaps I shall make it out to-morrow evening at the quilting," said he to himself. "Can it be that Walter has taken time by the forelock in this manner? Where could Gitty shave been all the time??"   WALTER OI[LB Y.        201 It was nearly dark when Mrs. Ellsworth and Alice re- turned home. Mr. Ellsworth was asleep in his arm-chair in the parlor. Gerardus and Gertrude were sitting to- gether upon the piazza. Candles had not yet been lighted, and the moon being partially obscured by clouds, every- thing seemed gloomy as well as silent. Gerardus did not come forward, as usual, to assist them from the carriage, but stepped off the end of the piazza, and 4walked towards the garden. "Why, how still and dull you all are!" was the mother's repiark as Gertrude passed them, and went into the par- lor, merely asking,- "Have you had a pleasant day?" but without staying for an answer or offering any further civilities. Alice saw that something had happened, and that neither Mr. Westhrook nor his cousin were quite at ease. She waited only for candles to be brought, and then taik- ing one, said " good-night" to her aunt, and went up-stairs. Gertrude followed her into her room. The book Mr. Ogilby had left, lay upon the table ; she recognized it at a glance. "Walter Ogilby has been here, has he?" said she. "Yes," replied Alice, a little surprised at her tone. "He called this afternoon." "That is singular, when he knew I was out." Ger- trude wished Alice to understand that none of Mr. Ogilby's visits were to be placed to her account. ' "Did he?" asked she, simply. "Did you meet him?" Gertrude looked keenly at her. "He must, of course, have told you that we met at Briar Lodge, and played chess together." "No; he said 'nothing of it " "What, then, did you talk about?" "We talked about these ballads," said Alice, taking up the book. "I had said,.the evening we took tea with his &#xD;<pb n="202-203" xml:id="VAC7016-00000101"/> 202       W ALTER O0GLB P. mother, that I should like to read one of which he was speaking, and he was so kind as to bring me the book to- day.  "Well, and what else?" "We talked about flowers-crimson ranunculuses, if I recollect right," Alice spoke as lightly as possible-she did not quite like this catechising, and she had an indefin- able dread of Gertrude's influence in aught connected with Mr. Ogilby. The doctor's words came to her recollection. "If she cannot make you dislike him, she will, at least, make you appear to do so." Gertrude turned over the pages of the book for a few minutes, then said, abruptly, "good-night," and went to her own room. She need not have been in haste to find herself alone, for she had not very cheerful subjects of contemplation. Gertrude had been so carried away by her .excitement in regard to the games of chess that morning, that she had lost sight of every other consideration. She did not remem- ber that Gerardus was present, watching every movement, every flush of her countenance, every glance of her eye, and putting his own construction upon them. It was not, after all, to conquer, but rather to fascinate Mr. Ogilby, that she had bent all her powers. She knew that his was too strong a will to be subdued--it must yield of itself to blandishment. Though speaking scarcely a word, she per- suaded herself she was using effectually t-he gift that was in her. She believed that he saw her -aim, and -felt flattered by it. Still more was she convinced of this when their games were finished, when- he spoke of the triumph of a victory over an opponent who played so admirably. She thought she could detect a, secret exultation in his manner; if there had been a  little more tenderness in it she would have felt quite secure.   But then came his departure. He would not stay and dine with them! Perhaps there was still a struggle in his mind,-C lingering of resolution to guard himself against her power,-a recollection of his mother's distaste towards her,-of the reasons for it. Whatever the motive might be, she was vexed at the re- sult. Her manner, spite of her efforts, showed this-it was -abstracted, and far less cheerful than when she had ,arrived at Briar Lodge. Mr. Teunis rallied her upon it. "Really," said he, "my friend Walter should have con- tented himself to remain beaten. I have no opinion of young men being so persevering. When he saw you so resolved not to yield, Miss Gertrude, he should have sub- mitted with a good grac,. I always did-the ladies al- ways got the better of mne, poor, easy soul! Yet, here I amll, a bachelor still. I suppose Walter is taking warning by my fate-ah I if I had only learned to stand my ground and carry my point as he does!" , Gertrude was secretly gratified that Mr. Teunis placed the contest upon the same footing that she had done-that he evidently saw in it, on the part of his friend, a greater stake than the mere victory at a gaml of chess. Notwith- standing the comfort of this conviction, she did not entirely recover her spirits during the few remaining calls that she anilher cousin made together, and their tea at the Van Antwerps'. It was still early twilight when they reached home, and found the two other ladies absent. "It is a suitable opportunity now, Gertrude," said her cousin, after she had taken off her bonnet and scarf, "to speak to you upon a subject which I had intended to have deferred until to-morrow morning. Are you at leisure?" "It is coming," said Gertrude to herself.-"As well first as last, and then it will be over."  &#xD;<pb n="204-205" xml:id="VAC7016-00000102"/> 204       WALTER OGILBY. Gerardus placed a chair for her, and another for him- self, quite at the end of the piazza. It looked formidable. "Let us walk in the garden," said Gertrude.., "No, if you please," said he, gently. "I shall not de- tain you long." She wondered what all this meant: she took the seat-he offered her, however. "I -should not have thought it right, Gertrude," began he, 'to leave Milbank, as I purpose to do in the morning, without saying something to you upon the subject of the hopes I have permitted myself to entertain. You have seen them-you were not ignorant, before I accompanied you home, of ilmy sentiments and my aspirations. I do not speak of this now to pain you; it is a matter I shall never allude to agrain. Had I gone away without this explana- tion you might have charged me with caprice. I have b een honest towards you, Gertrude,--I have made no effort to conceal my feelings, or to trifle with yours Much as I loved you, however,"--Mr. Westhrook paused a moment, -" whatever my feelings may have been toward you, I should not now have addressed you upon a subject which I see is distasteful to you but for two reasons: one I have already given, of the other I find it difficult to speak." Again he paused. Gertrude, humbled and ashamed at the light in which her cousin had placed her conduct towards him, yet burning with curiosity to know what he had still further to say, remained totally silent. "Gertrude,"' said Gerardus, at length,' "you have set your heart, or rather your hopes, on Mr. Ogilby. You have staked everything upon the chance of winning him. He must be blind if he does not see it. But he does not value your preference, and the reason is simply this-he loves another."    1.::4 WALTER OGLBB .I          205 Gertrude started. This was a contingency she was not prepared for, for when she had told Alice that Mr. Ogilby was attached to Christina Van Ness, it was without, for an instant, believing it to be so. Was it, indeed true? How had Gerardus learned it? Had Maria Van Benthuysen given him the information while they walked together before dinner? She strove to subdue her feelings while she replied, "I suppose, Gerardus, I must listen to all you have to say. It is not very courteous, you will allow, to address a lady in this style." "You must forgive me, Gertrude, but I anm not thinking of courtesy. I am speaking the truth to the woman I have loved, and whom I would wish to save from the bitter pain which I am now suffering. How differently I, this morn- ing, expected to have addressed you, you yourself know." Gertrude was touched in spite of herself. She had never felt so tenderly towards her cousin as at this moment--she had never before appreciated his manliness, his truthful- ness, his moral courage. She was almost tempted to place her hand in his, to ac- knowledge and renounce her infatuation, to ask his forgive- ness, and promise him her love. But her evil angel prevailed: she did neither; and, after X a short pause, Gerardus went on,- "I will be firm with you, Gertrude, though you should hate me for it. You will never gain the heart of Walter Ogilby; let me then ask, what gratification will it be to you to mar his happiness?" Again Gertrude started. Could it be possible that her cousin had read her so clearly, so truly, this day? How  had she undervalued him while thinking of him as an in- significant lover to be whistled on or off according to the i whim of the moment i  &#xD;<pb n="206-207" xml:id="VAC7016-00000103"/> 206       WALTER OGILBY. "Let me entreat of you, Gertrude," continued he, "to pause and weigh well what I say. I do not speak for my- self,-that is all past; but for the sake of your own happi- ness, your own self-respect, listen to this warning, and give up the schemes you have formed." Whether he would have said more she knew not, for the arrival of her mother, and Alice at this moment put an end to the conversation, a conversation that had ministered less to her pride and self-complacency than any she listened to for many a long year. After she had reached her own room, her speculations took another turn. If Mr. Ogilby had been equally dis- cerning with Gerardus, would not her wish to attract him, lower her in his estimation? She must play her cards cautiously, leave him perhaps to himself for awhile, until he should be thrown off his guard by her apparent indifference. Yet, if Gerardus was right, if Walter Ogilby really was in love with some one else,--Christina Van Ness, for in- stance,-was it worth while to throw away her time in vain efforts to detach him from her? Had she not better recall her truant philosophy, give him up, and turn her thoughts at once to Anthony Van Wyck? This was a point which she could not decide at once,-she would wait and see. A few days would determine. Alice went to her tranquil repose full of the most pleasant reveries. She was sorry, it is true, that Gertrude was dis- turbed. She would have told her so, had her cousin given her the opportunity. She hoped that all would come right between her and Gerardus, for his sake not less than for hers. He was so amiable, so kind Not to be compared to Mr. Ogilby, certainly, for agreeable qualities, but very sensible, and very right-minded. Alice remembered, too, to be very thankful that it had not rained during the day. The drops that were now begin-   4?ial      TFWALTER OGILBY        207 ning to patter on the sloping roof just over her bed, and to lull her with their continuous sound, gave hope that the i dust would be nicely laid for her. father's journey on the morrow, and perhaps cool the air a little for their visit to Farmer Van Vorst's. Mr. Ogilby and his sister would be there,-he had told her so,-and with thoughts full of peace and contentment, Alice fell asleep. Mr. Ellsworth had fully expected to be applied to, for his sanction of addresses that would have satisfied his highest ambition-and his good lady had been equally prepared for a round of calls upon her large circle of relations, to bespeak i congratulations upon the prospect of getting rid of her only daughter. This winding-up was a thing no one could understand. i Gertrude condescended to no explanation. "Gerardus went," she said, "probably because he had always intended to go on Monday or Tuesday. She had no doubt he would visit them again-cousins generally did-unles there p- id fy pened to be a feud in the foamily. This was all the satisfaction any one could obtain on the subject.  The day was fine after the shower of the preceding night still it was rather warm. "If we have got to go to the quiltin' this afternoon, I don't think, Ally, we can make our calls to-day," said her aunt. And in view of the pleasant visit before her, Alice be-  &#xD;<pb n="208-209" xml:id="VAC7016-00000104"/> 208        iWFA ER OGIL B . lieved she could wait contentedly until the morrow, with- out seeing the Van Nesses or even Mrs. Ogrilby. "Come, Gitty, won't you go with us this time?" begged her mother. "Indeed, ma'anm, you must excuse mce,-I do not feel like going out, even to enjoy the refined society at Farmer Van Vorst's." "Perhaps she is frettin' after Gerardus, poor thing i" said the tender mother to herself. "My dear" (aloud), "I dare say it would do you good,-there will be the doctor and Auut Lany, and Captain Bradford and his wife, and like as lnot Cousin Jane Ann Roseboom,--if she can only get the doctor to bring her down,--and then you may be certain there will be Aunty Kuypers and her granddaughter Locky -I'ni sure she knows enough about books and everything of that sort, to talk of and entertain you." Gertrude laughed outright. "Well, indeed, mother, you have given a most attractive list I if that liorrid old thing you call Aunty Kuypers is to be there, it is certainly reason enough for all lovers of peace to stay away. Alice, I warn you, you will have your eyes picked out as soon as she finds that you were born east of Dutchess County. The very name of Yankee will set her off like a train of gunpowder. Excuse me, if you please. And, Alice,-if you are wise, you will stay at home with me." But Alice was not wise-she preferred going. "I shall have time for my nap after dinner," remarked Aunt Aulchy. "They won't expect us to work-it's just our company they care for. They will begin it themselves this mornin', and have some nice, smart quilters to come early and get it rolled three or four times before we get there, so that the last stitch can be put in before dark. You know what puttin' in the last stitch is the sign of, don't you, Ally?" "(                  .   //:;/il     WALTER OGILB          20 The afternoon was well advanced when they at lenlcth !"fiE set off. 'Gertrude took a book and a seat upon the piazza to witness their departure. She had watched them some distance up the road, wondering what pleasure Alice could possibly expect at such a gathering, when another carriage came in sight. In it were Miss Ogilby and Miss Christina Van Ness with their two brothers. Her heart beat-with- out doubt they were going to stop-but no, they merely bowed as they passed; and, by straining her eyes to the utmost, she saw that they, too, turned into the cross-road that led to Farmler Van Vorst's. "Ally is in luck," said she; "that is, if it is any great luck to see Walter Ogilby and Christina Van Ness together. Alice had better set her cap for William Henry. He is a handsome young man--poor enough, too, for a country par- son's daughter to aim at."  Gertrude was in a far from placid frame of mind. Alice was received by the Van Vorsts with their cus- tomary calmness of manner, though their smiling counte- nances gave token of the satisfaction they felt at seeing her again. Only the little mother was demonstrative, and in her good graces Ally was still more firmly established by her having remembered to bring with her the book she had Xpromised. "May-be you don't care about quilting," was her sugges- tion, " but had rather sit here by the door and look out into the garden with your aunt and Mrs. Kuypers and me. t Mr Kuyvpers, this is Miss Morton, Squire Ellsworth's niece." The little, plump vrow, with a face so broad and full that scarcely a wrinkle appeared in it, notwithstanding her ad- vanced care, gave Alice a sharp look, and vouchsafed a few words of recognition throu gh her nose, in a tone not par- ticularly gracious. Alice saw that her place of nativity 8*  &#xD;<pb n="210-211" xml:id="VAC7016-00000105"/> 210       WALTER OGILBY: had been divined, and that it was anything but a recom- mendation. She preferred therefore taking her seat at the quilt, at a corner of which she was soon installed, opposite the accomplished granddaughter of Aunty Kuypers. Locky regarded Alice with great admiration for a moment, then rolled up her eyes, and cast them to the ceiling with a min- gled air of rapture and meditation, after which she addressed her new acquaintance in a style so high-flown, and with such a ludicrous misapplication of words, that the latter was often at a loss to comprehend or reply to her It was no small relief to see the Ferndale party enter before Miss Locky had laid her under the necessity of furnishing more than two or three answers to her remarks. Agnes, with girlish enthusiasm, soon nestled herself in beside Alice,-pressed her hand again and again, and whis- pered that she had been looking forward joyfully, since the day before, to meeting her. here. "She had been afraid," she said, " when William Henry and Christina had come over-unexpectedly to spend the day, that there would have been an end of the quilting-party, but brother had per-. suaded the visitors that their accompanying them would be esteemed a great compliment by the Van Vorsts. Chris- tina was very glad, because she wanted to see Alice again; and as for William Henry, he thought it would be capi- tal fun to play the gallant to the country lasses, though mother warned him he had better restrain his spirits and not play too many pranks, for Miss Morton, she was sure, would not like him the better for amusing himself with the oddities of other people." The quilt was, as Aunt Aulchy had predicted, in a state of great forwardness, yet room was found for Miss Chris- tina also. Her brother seated himself close by Alice, osten- sibly to thread needles and hold the scissors for the quilters, but in reality to provoke a conversation with some one of t  i,    ALTER OGILB1:       2" the company from which he could derive amusement. All this was accomplished before Mr Ogilby had got through his roand of salutations and civilities. "There,Walter, my good fellow," said William Henry, with a roguish glance, " you can take your station behind Mrs. Bradford, opposite, and overlook mne, while you aid her. I will attend to Miss Morton and Miss Rachel Kuy- pers, if I mistake not," with a profound bow. Locky nearly went into a spasm of delight. He addressed her with an air of interest. "Are you fond of this sort of employment, Miss Kuy- pers?" Locky drew up her lips firmly, and gave her eyes an additional roll. ' Well," she remarked deliberately, "there is certainly a discrimination between the different geniuses of employ- ment. This is one that is necessiated to be attended to. I find no great reluctancy to participation of it in conge- nial comnpany,"-here was another slight spasm,-" most principally because there is a species of duty consequen- tially obligating to being performed." "A duty? you surprise me," said William Henry. "I had always regarded quiltings as meetings for pleasure, merely." "That is, unequivocally, the view that is accustomary of being taken by the generality of the human species in general -that is, generally speaking. But when we contemplate the enormity of the hospitiable preparation for a numerical circle like the present," and Miss- Locky glanced around, "I am of opinion that it is conscientially obligated to us to render an equivalence." "What exalted sentiments 1" exclaimed her companion. "How much it is to be regretted that they are so rare I There is our young acquaintance Mr. Ogilby, for instance  &#xD;<pb n="212-213" xml:id="VAC7016-00000106"/> 212       WALTER OGILBY. who does not seem to participate in the least in your noble views of duty. I have observed with pain and mortification that he has not threaded so much as a single needle since he took his station just behind your chair." "Gentlemen," observed Miss Locky, with an indulgent air, " are, I believe, most universally appreciated to be less tentacious than the ladies.' William Henry, though for a moment at a loss, went on with the utmost gravity. "A spirit of tentacity cannot, however, be too diligently cultivated by either sex. 'I am proud to believe that Miss Rachel Kuypers has no objections to mingling the utile with the dulce. Am I right?" Locky cast up her eyes earnestly, while ransacking in  her memory her "Dictionary of Quotationsl-she then ventured to reply,- "I am quite feliciated to mingle miscellaneously on suit- able occasions." "Ah, indeed! Then you have a most propitious occa- sion at present," said Mr. Van Ness, bowing profoundly to Alice. "Here is a young lady from the land of erudi- tion and intellectual cultivation. You and she may now solace yourselves by holding sweet converse together upon all topics most approved in that home of the Muses-Con- necticut." Rachel bowed in imitation of Mr. Van Ness. Agnes was scarcely able to restrain her glee. She could not forbear touching Alice's hand under the quilt at every preposterous remark of William Henry. She was checked, however, by a gentle reproving glance from her brother, who endeavored, from time to time, to convey to his friend that he was going too far. But that young gentleman, in the most undaunted man- ner, kept on. Mi   MWALTER OGILBY.        213 "Speaking of the Muses, Miss Kuypers, Miss Morton has probably already repeated to you those beautiful lines on the Connecticut River, written in older, and I regret to say, more literary times than the present, by a vener- able Governor of the State.* Celebrating the various charms, both to the eye and the palate, of that noble stream, he thus enthusiastically breaks out,- 'Above, fly widgeons, ducks, and teals; Below, swim salmon, shad, and eels.' Do you not agree with me that these lines are uncom- monly simple and touching?" Miss Rachel deliberated a moment. "Yes," said she, at length; "yes, they are not excess- ively elaborate. I think we may pronounce them to have a species of unsophisticated simnplicity, and there are some to whom simplicity is rejoiceable. Below, swim salmon, shad, and eels. Yes." Her grandmother, who was within earshot, could con- tain herself no longer. "What is that you are talking about, young man?" cried she, in a voice of startling shrillness. "Eels I What are the eels in Connecticut River, I should like to know, to our Dutchess County eels?  Could they hold a candle to such, as the folks find here in our kill? Why, we've set our rack down below the race, and we've caught in it not less than fourteen dozen at a time, of bigger eels than ever was seen in Yankee land. And as for shad and salmon, if we don't 'have them nowadays like what we used to had, I should be glad to know what the reason is!

"I had always understood," said Mr. Van Ness, with imperturbable coolness, "that the absence of shad and sal- mon was in consequence of a law of the Legislature for- bidding their entrance, lest they should increase to such a degree as in time to drink the creek dry. It strikes me I have heard that there was once placed a chevaux-de-frise across the mouth of the creek for the very purpose of en- forcing this prohibition." I never heard of any Sabba' day freezes," said the old lady, indignantly. "We don't pretend to quite as much Sabba' day doings as some of the new-comers, though what we have may be quite as much to the purpose, And I don't set up to know much about the laws, neither, for in the good old times there wasn't no need of law. Folks could get along and behave their selves without it. But this I do know," cried she, raising her voice, "that since every sort of thing has come in to root out the old ways- what with Yankees, and Irish, and English-the good times what we used to have is all gone, and it's a wise body that can tell which is what, or who's t'other. And here comes Isaac Van Vorst that'll say just as I do, if he'll tell the truth out as a man ought to." The old lady was so fully roused that her gray hair, which had been carefully combed back from her broad forehead, and smoothed under her little close cap, seemed fairly to stand up with ire. "Now speak your mind, Isaac Van Vorst, and you too, Aulchy Westhrook" (in such a cause she repudiated the New England name of Ellsworth), "speak out and say if the old times was not better than the new. In those days, did not people live on their own farms, and their children i   v  Z    , WALTER OGILBY.        215 by them, without ranging all about the world to find a living? Did not they raise their crops, and when they was ready for market take them down to the landing and put them aboard the sloop, and send them to York and sell them? Did not they always have money enough to buy whatever was needed, and a good bit more to lay up? i In those days there was only a little mill here and there along on the kill. The women spun, and wove, and knit what they wanted to wear, without being beholden to their neighbors to do it for them, so that they might be idle and go to ruin. In those days a young girl did not keep a Greek or a Latin book by her side while she was doing up her work." Here she looked daggers at Locky, who, in return, cast up her eyes with an expression that plainly said, "Alas! my poor benighted grandmother!" "Yes, Isaac Van Vorst,"-continued the old lady, and her knitting-case and scissors rattled by her side with the emphasis she gave to her tirade,-" yes, you know, and so does Katrinchie Bradford, though she has gone and married an English sea-captain; you know that in them good old times a young girl was not ashamed to sit in her high, starched cap, on her stool, a milking her cow; and if a young man liked her, he could stop and lean on the fence, and ask leave to keep her company; and then, if her father and mother had nothing again' it, as it was not likely they would have, he could come the next Sunday evening, and the next, and so on, 'till they was married. Everybody did get married in these days " (Here was an- other look of indignant reproach at her spinster grand- daughter.) "I can tell you what, there was no such thing as old maids then,-no,-that, too, is one of their Yankee inventions." Here there was a general laugh.

"And here, as if Dutchess County could not furnish cattle fit for any king or kaiser, our folks must be sending off to Connecticut River to bring over half a dozen yoke to show off before our country oxen. It's my opinion that the Yankee they'd got here for teamster didn't know enough to drive Dutch oxen, and so they had to bring some of another sort to save his character." Mr. Ellsworth, who had entered with Farmer Van Vorst, could not, while laughing atthe excitement of the patriotic little vrow, resist the temptation of adding a trifle of fuel to the flame. "Indeed, Mrs. Kuypers," said he, "I think you hardly do justice to our imported oxen. Have you seen them? Have you noticed what splendid broad chests they have, and what noble foreheads? Be candid, now. Look- at their horns I Did you ever see such long, fair, wide- spreading horns?" "Horns " cried the old lady. "Horns! I don'tknow nothing about their horns; but this I will say," raising her voice, "if the Yankee oxen have the largest horns, our Dutchess County oxen have got the longest tails." CHAPTER XXV. BEFORE the general applause which followed this sally had subsided, tea was announced Alice had exchanged very few words with Mr. Ogilby' during the afternoon. She could not help wondering why he held himself aloof, and seemed by no means disposed to avail himself of any opportunity of entering into conversa-    ?: - .     WWALTER OGILBY.        217 tion with her. She had observed that, when not standing, as he sometimes did for a few minutes at a time on the op- posite side of the quilt-frame, he seemed entirely occupied with Lebbeus, to whose society he had apparently taken rather a fancy. She did not forget that he had appeared greatly pleased the afternoon before, when she mentioned her intention of going to the quilting--it must have been, she supposed, because he thought Mrs. Van Vorst would be gratified by such an attention. Mr. Ogilby had, it is true, devoted himself, since his ar- rival, very assiduously to his friend Lebby. He had been struck with the earnest admiration expressed in the young man's gaze at Alice during the whole length of the ser- vices on Sunday evening ; but he had not thought of this as, upon the whole, a thing to be wondered at. That lovely, attractive face, and slight, graceful figure, were cer- tainly in decided contrast to most of those by which they were surrounded. When, however, he met his friend the next day calling at Milbank, he could not but remark upon a circumstance so unusual; and he pretty nearly suspected the whole truth when he observed the conscious and awk- ward manner in which the invitation to meet Mrs. Ells- worth and her niece at the quilting was given. He did not exactly foresee to what lengths Lebbeus might be pre- paring himself to proceed; but he knew him well enough to be aware that among his many excellent qualities a commendable degree of self-esteem was not the least prom- inent; and he thought it possible that he might be medi- tating some gallantries which Miss Morton could not but find excessively annoying. To save her from any demonstration of the kind had therefore been his object, which he accomplished by tak- ing possession of the young man whenever he seemed un- ; occupied, and engaging him in conversation about his 19  &#xD;<pb n="218-219" xml:id="VAC7016-00000109"/> 218       WALTER OGILBY. fruit-trees, his crops, his cattle, and, above all, about his new house, which was now verging fast toward completion. He had, thus far, secured Alice from any undue share of his attention. After the entrance of the other gentlemen it would have been easy for Mr. Ogilby to have taken possession of a coveted seat beside Alice; but he did not lose sight of a' proper consideration for his homely friend-he could not indulge himself in a pleasure of which he had been so as- siduously striving to deprive him. Doctor Hardenberg, not suspecting the reasons which actuated these proceedings, was altogether dissatisfied withthem. He had come with a determination to watch what was going forward, and to find out, if possible, the meaning of Aunt Aulchy's remark on the preceding evening. The doctor, it will be observed, unlike most of his brethren of the faculty, loved a little gossip, and was in some slight degree given to speculating upon what did not immediately concern him. He was confident that at the present time he could have managed his friend Walter's affairs much better than he seemed to be doing himself. "Confound the fellow," said he to himself, " what is he about? I have watched him for the last half hour, and not once has he looked at her. One would say he was per- fectly indifferent, but I know better than that. Something must have happened. Has Gitty had her finger in the pie and set everything wrong? .I must find out.' The party were invited into an adjoining apartment to take tea. The table was covered with all the numberless varieties of good cheer customary on such occasions. In place, however, of the many sorts of preserves, without which, as a general thing; an entertainment is considered incomplete, there were now large dishes of strawherries,- the first of the season,-flanked by pitchers of cream, which   I            IrA,. LA, RGB made the eyes of at least one of the company to glisten with delight. There was a little manceuvring about getting seated; and the doctor saw with great satisfaction that Mr. Ogilby quietly accomplished his purpose of securing a place next to Alice. The extremes of the table were occupied by Miss Cla- rinda and Aunty Kuypers-the two upon whom the honor of pouring the tea devolved. It was near the latter that a seat had been assigned to Alice. Her cup was filled, and a sharp interrogatory from the old lady followed,- "Stir or bite?" Alice looked inquiringly-the question puzzled her com- pletely. "Mrs. Kuypers wishes to know," said Mr. Ogilby, "whether you will have your sugar put in your cup, or whether you would prefer to take a piece upon your plate, that you may nibble a little with each spoonful of tea." Alice could not but suspect that this adherence to an old custom was designed expressly to show her the per- tinacity with which the good dame resisted Yankee innova- tions; but she answered politely, "Stir, if you please." At the sweet tones of her voice the countenance of the old lady relaxed, and she condescended to say, with a. more gracious expression,- "Tell me if I haven't given you, enough. Everybody must feast at a quilting." The number of persons seated being greater than the dimensions of the table could well accommodate, the circle had to be s o enlarged, that each member was seated at an inconvenient distance from the board, and obliged to reach forward rather awkwardly to avail himself of cup and saucer or plate. This gave the gentlemen an opportunity 'for many little attentions and civilities.  &#xD;<pb n="220-221" xml:id="VAC7016-00000110"/> 220 .      WALTER OGILB Y. Young Mr. Van Ness divided his between Miss Locky and Agnes Ocgilbvy, insisting with great glee upon holding aplate first for one, and then for the other, quoting the fashions in Chili in support of the arrangement. The good farmer perseveringly offered his lap to all the ladies in succession, declaring that he " didn't care a mite for any tea if it would accommodate them to let him come and bold their dishes for 'em." As for Lebbeus, he had assumed a grand military air; and there being no servants in Battendance, and all things being served fron h  to hand to hand, up and down the long table, he took occasion to show off by giving the word qf command,--- "Let it pass quickly down the line!" "Now return in regular file!" or something to that effect, which excited, in no small degree, the admiration of his next neighbor, Miss Locky. When the colnpany had sufficiently complimented the good cheer, and had discussed to their 'hearts' content the various recipes for rullogies, head-cheese, keach-cakes, olycooks, and so forth, they adjourned-some to the par- lor, others to- the back porch, or stoop, as it was called, which opened upon the garden. Alice, much to her aunt's disappointment, showed no disposition to resume her place at the quilt, and try her I uck in sewing the last stitch. She took her seat on the porch with Miss Van Ness and Agnes. Mr. Ogilby had drawn near to them, and so, too, did Leb- beus; he was determined not to be out-generaled again. "Do you like the military, Miss Morton?" was his first question. { Yes, very well," she replied. "I do not know much about soldiers, however, except the militia companies that we see at home on training-days." "That's what I mean-militiy. And don't you like troopers better than trainers?"    ' ALTER OGILB       ' 221 "I think I do," replied she, with a smile. "I remember being overwhelmed with admiration, when a child, by a company of cavalry from a neighboring town, who wore very distinguished-looking bear-skin caps; and one of them, I recollect, played ' The Young Squire of Falmouth' on the French-horn so enchantingly that we young people did nothing but sing or hum it for a month." "I was in the army once, myself," said Lebby. Alice looked a little surprised. "Yes," continued he, "just at the close of the war I was drafted with a half a dozen other young fellows round here, and we had to report ourselves at York, or rather at Greenwich village, where the rendys'voo was. Well, we concluded we wouldn't go a-foot, so we each took one of the very finest kind of horses,-we could afford it,-and when we got there, you see, we were just enrolled into a cavalry company. I have got my uniform up in the garret now, if you would like to see it. I suppose there is not anything I ever had on that I look better in. I will go and bring it down. The saddle is pretty nice too, though it got a little gnawed by the mice in one or two places, but it don't show much." Mr. Ogilby hastened to turn the conversation to a topic that he 'was convinced would drive the cavalry and all be-. longing to it out of Lebbeus' head. The place where they were, commanded a view of Leb- beus' new house-tthe object of chief interest to all the members of his family. On the first allusion made to it, the young man went at once into a detail of its commence- ment and progress, the advantages of its situation, and the commodiousness of its arrangements. Many handsome things were, of course, said by the different members of the circle. "But seems to me, Mr. Van Vorst," said Ally, who  &#xD;<pb n="222-223" xml:id="VAC7016-00000111"/> 222       WALTER OGILBY. feared sh% had mortified him a little by her indifference as to his regimentals, and now wished to atone for it, " you are provident beyond what is customary. Most people catch their bird first, and then make ready their cage. You seem to reverse this order. I suppose you will soon, how- ever, be busy spreading your nets." "How do you know but what I have begun?" asked Lebbeus, with a look so sheepish, yet so significant, that there was no mistaking its meaning. Alice turned away her head, and began conversingyxith Miss Van Ness. She was confused and annoyed. She woindered why she had been so silly as to comment on' Lebbeus' affairs or doings in any possible way. What must Mr. Ogilby, what must any one think? She hoped nobody saw that look but herself; she should certainly take care never to give'the young man an oppor- tunity of addressing another remark to her. Yet she could not be rude to one so well-meaning. It was a relief to her when Agnes-who, not particularly interested in the young man's details, had strayed into the garden-called to her to come and look at a beautiful cab- bage-rose tree just bursting into bloom. "And there," cried the young girl, when they had sufficiently explored Miss Clarinda's flower-beds, "there are some elder-blossoms growing by the fence, the prettiest things in the world to dress the hair with. I will gather some for you and Christina, and when we go back to the porch I will put them in your hair." She made her way across the beds of lettuces and rad- ishes, leaving Alice standing in the middle of the path, where she was soon joined by Mr. Ogilby. "Aunty Kuypers," said he, " did not spare our native observe that you suffered no annoyance from her splenetic I .:   W VALTER OGILBY 1         223 remarks. Poor old lady I like many others, she can see in the people of New EngTland only a set of troublesome in- novators. She has no taste, as you perceive, for modern improvernents,-the old ways are good enough for her. She looks back to a time when the lives of the people were more simple, and, as she persuades herself, more virtuous than at present. Never having felt the want of learning herself, she has no sympathy with those who would extend its blessings. ' Wiser and wickeder,' is her maxim. I be- lieve she has a firm conviction that the Father of Evil walks about the world in the shape of a schoolmaster." Ally laughed.. "Her granddaughter seems by no means to partake of the old lady's horror of intellectual culti!- tion." "No, Locky is, on the contrary, ambitious to shine in the walks of erudition. She has an exaggerated idea of what constitutes a fine education, and, unfortunately, her intervals of leisure only suffice for the acquisition of a treasure of high-sounding terms, which, either through a defective memory or a nervous timidity, she is, as you have observed, continually miscalling and misapplying." "I suppose it is firom her intimacy with the Van Vorsts that she has acquired her value for books, and her desire for improvement." "Yes; I dare say her aims would have been somewhat different had they been directed solely by her grandmother. It is a proof of the excellence of her principles, that, not- withstanding this ambition of hers, she devotes the greater portion of her time to the comfort and assistance of the old lady, and seldom revolts at her caprices or injustice. With her good-temper, and her excellent qualities as a house- keeper, she will be admirably fitted to take charge of our friend Lebbeus' new house and establishment, as soon as he is prepared to place it at her disposal."&#xD;<pb n="224-225" xml:id="VAC7016-00000112"/> 224       WALTER OGILBY. How thankful Ally felt that Mr. Ogilby had thus inter- preted the young man's remark! All her annoyance van- ished. They took a turn or two around the garden, then saun- tered slowly toward the house, and soon the young people were grouped together upon the porch. Agnes had brought her treasure of elder-flowers, and began placing their deli- cate, starry blossoms in Alice's hair. Unobserved, as he thought, yet not so as to escape the watchful eye of the doctor, Mr. Ogilby quietly handed his sister a white half- blown rose which he had gathered in his walk; and she, without comment, placed it with the others among the soft, brown curls. After an interval of general conversation, in which Mr. William Henry's voice was heard above all others rallying, teasing, and perplexing his companions, as the fancy took him, but all in perfect good humor, varied by abortive at- tempts on the part of Miss Ldcky to answer him in the same strain, or to edify him by some sententious remark expressed in the most elegant and incomprehensible lan- guage, the greater part of the company returned to the parlor to attend to the important business, yet unfulfilled, of putting "the last stitch" into the quilt. The three young ladies lingered yet awhile to gaze on the landscape which, now that the sun had gone to his rest, began to be flooded with the silver radiance of the rising moon. "The air is growing damp and cool-you will feel it after this warm day: let me go for your shawls," said Mr. Ogilby. "I will bring them," said Agnes; nd she went in search of them. She did not return immediately; and her brother, somewhat impatient, followed her. While stand- ing near the door, awaiting her reappearance, he had the   WALTER OGILBY.        225 satisfaction of overhearing the following dialogue between Aunt Aulchy and her friend Mrs. Bradford: "-What a pretty- young person your niece is! How won- derfully she favors your husband!" "Oh, no indeed I Her complexion is just like mine. And she looks more like my John Peter than like anybody else. It's wery strange-but you know, I suppose, what that's the sign of!" "Oh, dear, yes I people that look alike are always sure to come together, they say. And, now that I think of it, they do favor each other a good deal more than any two of your own children do; but, somehow, it never happened to strike me before. Well, their being cousins is against the thing with some people. How is itwith you? Would it please you? I know there's a good deal of marrying cousins in your family." "Mercy on me I yes; nothing could please me better. I don't suppose there ever was such another girl as Ally. I'm sure no mother could ever ask anything better for her son than that he should have just such a wife as she will make."  Mr. Ogilby did not think it necessary to wait longer for the shawls which his sister was so slow in bringing. He left the vicinity of Mrs. Ellsworth and her friend at once, lest he might chance to hear something still mor6 unpalatable. "What absurd nonsense people do sometimes talk I What preposterous and improbable ideas will enter their brains, especially at aquilting l"Such were his reflections. "Look like John Peter I A great, brown, stalwart fellow, nearly as tall as myself, to be likened to that delicate, gentle crea- ture, with a complexion like the lily and the rose I If Mrs. Ellsworth has no stronger grounds of expectation than the personal resemblance between her son and niece, she may as well look elsewhere for a daughter-in-law."  &#xD;<pb n="226-227" xml:id="VAC7016-00000113"/> 2226      'WALTER OGILBY. Still the idea disturbed him. He tried to banish it from his mind, but it would constantly recur in spite of his phil- osophic efforts. He went home in a less happy frame of mind than did the good doctor, who retired tolerably well satisfied, upon the whole, with the result of his observations throughout the evening. CHAPTER XXVI. "POOR Gittyr Have you had a lonesome time, my 'dear?" was her mother's compassionate inquiry as she en- tered the house. " We have had such a nice wisit, haven't we, Ally? Such strawherries and cream! Nobody ever does have such cream as Clarinda Wan Worst. I often wonder what her cows are made of! And oh, Gitty, such beautiful crul- lers! You never tasted anything like them I Now, don't you wish you had gone with us?" Gertrude did wish so, but she would not acknowledge it; she only answered, with an indifferent air,- "I have not been lonely at all. Cousin Abraham and Cousin Letty took tea with me. By-the-by, I took the lib-- erty of making an engagement for you and Ally, as well as myself, to dine with them to-morrow. Cousin Letty expressed a particular wish that we all should come." "Oh, of course she always wants us particularly to come,  or else she wouldn't ask us, you know. Well, who else was here?"  "Anthony Van Wyck came in, and passed the evening; he has but just gone."   . J   X;      WALTER OGILBY.        227 "I suppose he is in wery good spirits about his uncle's letter. Well, it's pleasant to be in good spirits, and it's a comfort to see you brightened up a little." Anthony Van Wyck's visit had, indeed, done much to dissipate the gloom which had fallen still more heavily upon Gertrude after the departure of her mother and cousin. She had sat for more than an hour pondering on her fading hopes. Gerardus would not have spoken so posi- tively, she was convinced, had he not had good reason for knowing that Mr. Ogilby was attached elsewhere.  A match between him and Christina Van Ness seemed the most natural thing in the world. The families had been intimate for years-the younger members were constantly together. People, it is true, do not always marry as it is natural they should. We see occasional instances of their choosing for themselves quite differently from what the world chooses for them. Yet Mr. Walter Ogilby was such a very discreet and dutiful person that if his mamma suggested to him the propriety of marrying the daughter of her dear friend, Mrs. Van Ness, doubtless he would make it a matter of conscience to fall in with the arrangement. Thus argued Gertrude, and she deeply regretted that her pride and obstinacy had kept her from joining the quilting-party, where she might have learned, frgm her own observation, how near the truth Gerardus had been. The visit of her cousins, the Vandervoorts, had drawn off her mind, in some degree, from these unpleasant con- templations, and, by the time they had taken their depart- ure, she was quite ready to play the agreeable to Anthony Van Wyck, who just then made his appearance. The young gentleman had evidently paid the strictest attention to his toilet; she had never seen him so well dressed. He looked so handsome, and was in such fine , ii W  &#xD;<pb n="228-229" xml:id="VAC7016-00000114"/> 228       WALTER OGILBY. spirits; there was now and then something so conscious so approaching to confidential in his manner, that Gertrud caught herself saying, more than once,- "If the worst come to the worst,-if what Gerardus as serts is true,-1 do not lose everything in Mr. Walter Ogil by. With this change in his position, Anthony is no cor temptible spec, and he really knows how to make himsel charming!" There was evidently something that Dr. Van Wyec was wishing to say to her, but he seeined to lack courage Once he began,- "There was a subject upon which I intended to spea to you.'  Then he stopped, and Gitty was sure he colored slightlJ "Perhaps,"-and he laughed a little embarrassed laugl -"perhaps I had better wait a few days. You are nc going away anywhere, are you, Miss Gertrude?" "When he has seen a little more of the world," sai Gertrude to herself, "all this timidity will wear off, an he will acquire self-possession. He has labored unde disadvantages hitherto, poor fellow!" She assured the young gentleman that she had n thoughts of leaving Milbank until after the visit of he cousins from the city. "Ah  that is right. I shall be here again soon-prol ably to-morrow. I am expecting another letter from m uncle very impatiently. I must certainly get one in th morning. These letters from uncles," here his look wa most joyous and significant, "how much they do affe( one's happiness!" Gertrude drew her own conclusions from all this.

She talked of her intended visit to the Vander- voorts the next day; and even her plain, domestic cousins seemed to conme in for a share of Dr. Van Wyck's interest and commendations. It was pleasant to observe what a position her relatives seemed, for her sake, to be taking in the esteem of the kind-hearted young man. Dr. Van Wyck was unquestionably at her disposal, yet she would not decide hastily. She would bold him in a little uncer- tainty until she should see whether fate should force her to give up all hope in another quarter. This was her decision as the young man left her. A Gertrude was not long in drawing from Alice all she had to tell of the occurrences of the afternoon. "Mr. Ogilby was very devoted, I suppose, to Christina Van Ness?" "Not particularly so, that I observed." "Did not he sit by her at the quilt-frame and entertain her as a loyal knight was in duty bound?" "I do not think he came near the quilt-frame, except to stand opposite his sister and shake his head at her a little when she and Mr. Van Ness laughed at Miss Locky Kuy- pers' hard words." "And then, after tea, you walked in the garden, of course?" "Certainly. We .paid our respects to Miss Clarinda's roses and carnations. She really has a very handsome variety." "And who walked with Miss Van Ness?" "I do not think she walked at all. I believe she had something of a cold, and was afraid the garden might be damp after the shower of last night. She at upon-the porch while we walked in the garden." "Talking poetry and sentiment to her swain, Walter?" "No. Mr. Ogilby was in the garden.

Gertrude's hopes rose. Gerardus might, after all, be mistaken. She grew quite amiable, and made up her mind to wait in all patience for whatever developments the next day might bring. The following morning, after breakfast, the cousins were seated in the hall,-Gertrude occupying herself with some trifling piece of fancy-work, and Alice engaged in copy- ing a small engraving of "Barnard Castle." Both were awaiting the hour at which, all household arrangements being completed, the mistress of the family would feel at liberty to leave her cares for a day's visit- ing. This wide, old-fashioned apartment was the pleasantest in the house. The broad doors at this season always stood open, and gave the beautiful view of the mountains and the far-sweeping valley in one direction; while in front, the highroad, with its frequent passers-by, sug- gested subjects for commnet or speculation to those who had no more profitable employment. They had sat for some little time, each as it seemed in- tent upon her work, when Alice, with surprise, observed her cousin suddenly throw down her embroidery and step quickly out upon the piazza, apparently motioning to some one passing. Through the locust-trees she perceived that it was Mr. Ogilby, who, in obedience to the summons, had soon dismounted, and was approaching the house. "Oh, I will not detain you a moment!" cried the young lady. "I see you are on your way to the post-office. My father has been called away upon business, and he has, unfortunately, set all the people at work in one way or another, so that I am not at liberty to employ one of them. Will you excuse my troubling you? We really are so   anxious to hear from our cousins in the city, whom we have been for several days expecting,-so solicitous to know what is detaining them,-that I am about to ask the favor of you to try and bring us a letter from some of them." Her manner was very sweet and gracious. She flattered herself that it had produced some impression, for Mr. Ogilby looked pleased with the commission; and, after ex- changing a few of the customary polite phrases with Alice, he resumed his route to the village. Less than an hour had elapsed, when he again made his appearance. Gertrude was, as before, all smiles and courtesy. She greeted him before he reached the steps with,-. "What success? Have you brought me a missive?" "I am so fortunate," was his reply. Alice looked up involuntarily as he spoke. She had learned to distinguish each inflection of his voice, and she perceived that its tones had in them none of the hilarity with which he had departed. Gertrude seized her letter, and while she eagerly tore it open, Mr. Ogilby took from his pocket another letter, which he silently handed to Alice. Whether from accident or design the seal was uppermost, and Alice, as she turned it, saw that the post-mark was West Point. She raised her eyes to his with a sudden glance, and she almost started, as she marked the anxious, inquiring gaze he bent upon her. She colored, in spite of herself, and looked troubled. Although he had placed himself in such a position as he imagined would screen the whole transaction from Ger- trude, not a look, not a motion, was lost upon her. It was an instantaneous revelation. The whole truth flashed upon her! This then was what Gerardus meant I Tt was  &#xD;<pb n="232-233" xml:id="VAC7016-00000116"/> 232       WALTER OGILBY             . her cousin, and not Christina Van Ness, to whom Walter Ogilby's heart was given. How blind had she been l What had she been doing, that such a thing had been suf- fered to escape her? For an instant her emotions were almost beyond her control.   I Gertrude's self-command, however, rarely deserted her. : Before a word was spoken, before Mr. Ogilby had recovered his calmness, or Alice her self-possession, her whole plan of operations was decided upon. Alice did not immediately break the seal of her letter, which, as was evident through the thin paper, was closely written and crossed. She felt that the eyes of both Mr. Ogilby and Gertrude were upon her; and not quite under- standing the expression which she read in either, she in- ! voluntarily hesitated. Gertrude was the first to speak. "They have been delayed by a slight indisposition of their mother's-they will be here positively to-night or to- morrow. Well, Ally, cannot you give us a little of vour news? We will permit you to read your letter, and if it  consists entirely of dissertations upon Laplace and Vau- f: ban,"-here she smiled significantly at Mr. Ogilby,-" we will excuse you for keeping it all to yourself.." The look and the tone quite restored Ally's composure. "My correspondent must be different from young men in general, I am afraid, if he does not write more about himself than about musty authors," said sle. She took her scissors and cut around the seal, then opening the letter, v she glanced along its pages.. It was done so simply and naturally that Mr. Ogilby began to breathe more freely. Gertrude was resolved that the matter should not ter- : minate thus. "Upon my word, my brother has a furious talent for letter-writing," she said. "He must have a deal of vanity I to imagine that such a volume can be interesting, unless,  *{i   I        m'ArWALTER OGILBYT       233 indeed-Is there nothing, Ally, in all these pages that I, his sister, or Mr. Ogilby, his friend, may be permitted to hear?' "Oh, yes! he writes in a high state of perspiration, he says, in the midst of his examination before the Board of I Visitors, and he begs we will put off our excursion to West Point until he is quite through with the ordeal, and,"-she looked at the cross-writing,-"- and he sends his love to everybody, of course." "And that is all!" said Gitty, with a provoking smile. d Mr. Ogilby took up the drawing Alice had been engaged with, and seemed examining it intently. He suspected that it was not quite polite to be watching her so closely, yet he could not tear himself away while matters stood thus. "No," said Alice, "that is not all. Now," looking up and smiling archly, "you are both dying of curiosity to know the contents of my poor letter. Mr. Ogilby, I see, suspects,"'-he looked at her with a surprise he could not conceal,-" yes, I read it in his countenance that he sus- pects your brother of meditating an elopement with one of the professor's daughters, and that he has written to be- speak my approbation of the plan." Mr. Ogilby could not but smile as he met her bright sunny glance. "And I,'" said her cousin pointedly, "what do I sus- pect?" "I cannot exactly tell," said Alice, appearing to muse for a moment. "Perhaps that John Peter is making his confession to me of having neglected his studies, of having, in consequence, been sent down to the foot of his class, and that instead of getting a commission in the Engineers, as he has hoped, or even in the Artillery, he will be put into the poor unhappy Infantry, and sent off to some frontier post among the wild Indians." 20*  &#xD;<pb n="234-235" xml:id="VAC7016-00000117"/> 234        TVALTER OGILBYI.  "You certainly deserve great credit for your ingenuity - -sincerity is a virtue not to be expected, I suppose, from , young ladies under all circumstances," said Gertrude, with an emphasis of peculiar meaning. Alice looked both surprised and hurt. Mr. Ogilby    colored with indignation. He was almost resolved to take no heed of Gertrude's insinuations, but to dismiss the sub-  ject at once from his mind. He saw that there was some e by little mystery attached to the letter, but he would trust to .l that fair, ingenuous countenance, and take it for granted i that the contents affected Alicee personally, no further than she seemed willing to admit. /  He had quite made up his mind when, to the question   from her cousin, uttered in a constrained voice,- "May I mention to my mother that you have received  this letter?"  Alice replied with alacrity, "Yes, certainly; I will read a part of it to her." Mr. Ogilby was now able to take his leave.                          I "When is my mother to have the pleasure of seeing you at Ferndale?" was his parting inquiry. It was addressed to Alice rather than to Gertrude.            : "This morning, as soon as my aunt is ready, we are to set off." And they parted with the expectation of meeting again I in a couple of hours; Gertrude saying to herself, as she . turned away, "The seed is sown-if need be, I can wait  ; for the harvest."  :-. -N I:   IVALTER OGILBY.       235 j    CHtIAPTER   XXVII. ALICE was troubled at the remembrance of Mr. Ogilby's look when he had handed her the letter. She did not in- terpret it as accuratelyvas Gertrude had done-she read in it only disapprobation. "Doubtless Ee thinks it wrong for ladies to correspond with gentlemen under any circumstances, even with their cousins. Perhaps, if he knew all, he might think more in- dulgently in this particular case; but I certainly cannot explain." Such was Ally's thought. "And why should I?" would have been-,ihe next most natural question, but it was one which, somehow, never occurred to her. The call at Ferndale was not without its annoyances for more than one. Some allusion to West Point brought a polite inquiry from Mrs. Ogilby about the young soldier, to which his mother eagerly replied, "Oh I John Peter is wery well. Ally had a letter from him this mornin'. He does not write to any of us, now that Ally is here." The loojk of affectionate significance with which she re- garded her niece while making this announcement con- veyed a hint, by no means pleasing, to the maternal heart of Mrs. Ogilbv. "I anm sure there is no occasion for aunty to speak so pointedly," thought Ally; and she hastened to change the subject by questioning Agnes about her studies. "Do you take all your lessons at home?" she inquired. "Yes-mamma attends to us in the morning. Brother has always been in the habit of hearing us recite some of our more difficult lessons, but lately he seems to be giving i i  &#xD;<pb n="236-237" xml:id="VAC7016-00000118"/> 236   .

"We are always apt to be a little negligent at this season."      ' It did not escape Gertrude's observation that Mr. Ogil- by, though at the moment engaged in replying to, her questions, 'was listening to catch the conversation near I him.   '                  .  He could not, without turning from her, look at her   cousin, yet she detected the occasional glance of his eye - in that direction. She cast about for some subject that ' might rivet his attention. "Ah I by-the-by, Mr. Ogilby, we shall have to call you into council upon the subject of this much-talked-of excursion to West Point." Mr. Ogilby looked pleased.   He had particularly wished to be included in the invita- tion, but had not expected it, as he was under the impres- sion that it was to be strictly a family party. "When do you propose going?"' he asked, cheerfully-  "and what are your arrangements?", "Oh! you heard 'this morning that we are especially invited to delay. until my brother is out of the hands of the Examining Committee. We must, of course, take care ": that there shall be no drawhack to the perfect felicity the presence of some of us is to bring to him. Probably we , shall go the last week in this month. My brother comes home, accompanied by some of his young friends, to keep ! the Fourth of July,-that will bring an accession to our stock of beaux, consequently to our gayeties. Until that ? time we must do all in our power to provide amusements  : for my cousins from the city. You will readily ima gine ? that they come into the country with a perfect passion for : rural entertainments of all sorts. I trust we may rely on   WALTER OGILBY.        237 you to help us to entertain them. They are old acquaint- ances of yours, I believe." "I have never had the honor of an introduction to the Miss Westbrooks " "Is it possible? Ah! I had forgotten how many sum- mers you have been absent. You must have seen them, however. You will remember Catlyna,-not handsome, strictly speaking, but a very dignified, intellectual person; and Anne Eliza, such a clharming, unsophisticated child of naturel" It did not escape Mr. Ogilby that no mention was made of giving pleasure to the cousin now here. In all the plans of amusement it was not what Alice, but what the New York cousins would find pleasure in. He therefore remarked,- "Miss Morton's enjoyment of these proposed entertain- ment will be very great, for the reason that our scenery is so entirely new to her. The Miss Westbrooks, from their frequent visits here, have become so familiar with it that it has lost, for them at least, the charm of novelty." Gertrude smiled, and glanced at Alice. t"Oh, yes; after a time she will enjoy these things as well as the rest of us," she said, significantly. Mr. Ogilby made no reply; and, fearing that he might be meditating a movement that would enable him to join the group with which his thoughts were so evidently occu- pied, Gertrude now reminded her mother of their engage- ment to an early dinner at " the Orchards,' and the conse- quent necessity of their departure. Mr. Ogilby found an opportunity, while the others were making their adieux, to say in a low voice to Alice,- "You have not forgotten, I hope, your promise to visit my mother on Saturday?" She raised her eyes for a moment to his. His look wfas  &#xD;<pb n="238-239" xml:id="VAC7016-00000119"/> 238       WALTER OGILBI X not one of disapprobation, certainly, yet neither was it  quite the 'bricght, happy one she had been accustomed to.  His manner seemed a little ceremonious, but that might be accidental. tie may have thought she had done wrong, yet be inclined, upon reflection, to make allowances. Such was Ally's inference. She hastened to answer cheerfully,  in the same low tone,- "I do not forget, I assure you. I am anticipating  ' great pleasure in seeing Mrs. Van Tine again, and asking : after Miss Freelove and the good farmers"       :i "Then you will allow us to call early?" -  "Oh, yes, at whatever hour Mrs. Ogilby pleases. I will be ready in good season." This little dialogue had not been unremarked by Ger- trude; the timidity of her manner, the reserve of his at 1 first, and the apparent brightening up at the last. Slhe would have given worlds to know what it was about.    Had matters gone so far with them that there was a questioning and an explanation? Oh, no,-that was im- possible I There was nothing in her cousin's manner that : showed consciousness of Mr. Ogilby's admiration, or a wish to attract it. As the party drew near "the Orchards," they saw   ::^ Cousin Vandervoort waiting on the steps to receive them. H A thing so unusual could not but strike them with sur-  prise. Cousin Letty, too, Aas at the hall door, and the : three visitors, on their arrival, but more particularly Aunt i f Aulchy, were seized and kissed with a most extraordinary ; demonstration of emotion and affection.        !

But, to i be sure, you could not any of you know i"       I  Aunt Aulchy saw that something was expected of her. Something had happened, or was about to happen. The  ! "'      '     WALTER OGILBY.        239 smiling countenances of the two youngest girls assured her that it was not of an afflictive nature. "We have wanted so to see you and tell you all about it, but Anthony and Phillippina would lnot have a word said till he got another letter from his uncle, to see how he would approve. And oh, Cousin Aulchy his uncle wants them to be married immediately and go to Europe with him in August! Oh, dear! Is not it dreadfully sudden?" "Anthony and Phillippina! What do you mean? Your Philly! Who ever dreamed of Anthony Van Wyck's think- ing of her? Mercy on us! Gitty, do you hear that?" Yes, Gitty heard it. She took in distinctly the full force of the overwhelmingP fact. This day, to which she had looked forward with such triumphant anticipations, what had it brought her? The conviction that of her two in- significant cousins, as she had ever been in the habit of considering them, Walter Ogilby loved the one, and An- thony Van Wyck was to marry the other. Amid the general kissing and congratulating, the inquir- ing when it happened, and how it happened, the wonder- ing that all the family connections had been so blind as never to have even suspected what was going on, the pre- dicting that this would be but the beginning of a series of marriages in a family so rich in candidates for the honored destiny, together with the more than usually voluble out- pouring of her mother's simple affectionate heart over the good fortune of her young cousin, Gertrude was, able to recover an appearance of serenity and escape suspicion on the score of her own disappointment. The young couple now made their appearance from an adjoining room, where they had been awaiting their summons. "You see you have my secret before I got a chance to      .  &#xD;<pb n="240-241" xml:id="VAC7016-00000120"/> 240       WALTER OGILB Y.  tell it to you," said the laughing, happy Anthony. "It almost forced itself out last evening. I felt as if I ought to tell you, we have always been such good friends, and I  knew you would be so delighted to hear it. But Mrs. Van- dervoort said no, we had better make no noise about it until we could tell all our plans. Do you know, ma'am" (to his future mother-in-law), "I had the greatest difficulty in the world, last evening, to keep from telling the whole?  It does not take you by surprise, does it? (to Gertrude.)  I was pretty sure, last evening, that you understood me, : cautious as I endeavored to be."- So far from understanding him, Gertrude felt that she 1 had wretchedly misunderstood Dr. Van Wyck, herself, everybody. She seemed entangled in a web, of which every mesh brougllt some disappointment, some defeat. Now that Dr. Van Wyck was lost to her, his value ap- peared inestimable; yet she strove to console herself by  mentally depreciating both him and his lady-love. "After all, two such simpletons as Anthony and Philly are not worth caring for," she said to herself. "It is hardly worth while to occupy one's thoughts with them. There are other objects now to be attended to, and it is perhaps as well that I have nothing to distract my atten- tion from them. In the first place, this business of the 1 marriage festivities-after that, things of greater moment."  In the council which sat forthwith upon this all-import-  ant subject, it was decided that the wishes of the rich and i kind-hearted uncle, Counsellor Van Wyck, should in all i points be respected. The first of August was accord- ingly the time appointed for the happy event, that the newly-married pair might be ready to accompany their relative in the voyage to Europe, immediately after its celebration. Next came the choice of bridesmaids.    WALTER OGILBY.        241 Gitty, of course: that is a matter understood," said the eldest sister; "then two of us, I suppose." "Yes, Sarah Ann and Cornelia: they are nearest Phillip- pina in age," said Gertrude. The two older sisters, who had never officiated on such an occasion, looked disappointed, but they made no appeal. "Dr. Van Wyck, your sisters are all too young. What a pity! Then Philly will have to invite Catlyna West- brook. You will have only four bridesmaids of course; so that matter is all settled." It was now Philly's turn to look disappointed. She did not much like Catlyna Westhrook, and she was particularly 'attached to her own cpusin, Katy Van Antwerp. She would even have infinitely preferred Alice to the one selected. It would have been impolitic, however, to offend Gertrude, on whom so much depended. Weddings were things to which the family were totally unaccustomed; and how could this one be properly accomplished without the aid and supervision of their well-educated cousin? There was no alternative but to submit. "Now for the groomsmen," said Dr. Van Wyck. "I suppose I must have somebody to stand up beside me and help me blush. Your brother, John Peter, first and fore- most." "Yes, and Garret, and your brother Robert,-he is rather young, but he is tall and good-looking,-he will do very well. Now where can we look for a fourth?" "Theodore Roosevelt is your most intimate friend, An- thony, is not he?" said Phillippina. "You have nursed him up so nicely, during his long sickness, that he will be quite well before August." "Better not run the risk of giving him a relapse with our wedding festivities," remarked Gertrude. Dr. Van Wyck was not tenacious for his rights, yet he 21  &#xD;<pb n="242-243" xml:id="VAC7016-00000121"/> 242       WALTER OGILBY. really wished that young Roosevelt should be made  choice of.                     !! "I do not think my friend's health would be perilled by I a little merry-making," he said. "And I suppose he takes  a particular interest in all our proceedings, having been the ostensible object of my assiduous attention of late, while I was hiding from Dr. Hardenberg and the rest of you that I had a patient at the Orchards to share my daily visits,"  with a smile at Phillippina.             I Gertrude preserved a cool silence.  ' What do you think of William Henry Van Ness?" the eldest sister ventured to ask, as she observed that, for  some reason, young Roosevelt was out of the question.  "I did not know you were such particular friends of the Van Nesses." "No more we are," said Miss Vandervoort. "Nobody is very intimate there except the Ogilbys. Ah! true, there  is Walter Ogilby, how will he do? Anthony, will you have Walter, or is he too handsome? Will you not be afraid the company will look more at the attendants than  at the bridegroom himself?"            ? "Not I," said Anthony; "Philly will look at nobody  but me, will you, Philly?" (in a tender whisper.) Choose for yourselves" (in a louder tone). "Marry me how you like, only marry me, that is all I stipulate for."  "Well, how have you got it all fixed?" said the master  of the house, who had not until now taken a part in the  conversation.                    II His eldest daughter rehearsed the programme at length  as established.  "But I thought, Philly, your Cousin Katy was your best friend. You have always been together, ever since you  could go alone. Why don't you have her?"  "I suppose Philly wishes to save Katy the expense of a   WALTER OGILBY.         243 dress and all things necessary for the occasion. The Van Antwerps are not rich, we know," remarked Gitty. "That is nothing," said Cousin Abraham. "I will give Katy a dress just like my own girls, as a present.": "Very well; then there certainly can be no objection. Let Katy take my place, and stand next to Philly. I shall be most happy to resign it," said Gertrude, blandly. "Oh, no, no I that will never do: better for one of us to give up, cried the younger sisters,-and, "Oh, no, no! let there be no change: let it all be as Ger- trude has arranged it," added the others, feeling that on her the credit and the well-doing of the whole affair was to depend. "Catlyna is her own cousin; we cannot give offence by leaving her out," whispered Miss Westhrook to her father, --and, "Since she has consented to have Walter Ogilby, whom she dislikes so much, she doubtless feels that she has yielded a great deal," whispered Van Wyck to Philly. e "Well, I suppose we may go to our dinners, then," said Squire Vandervoort, "since you have got all your matters settled." All things were settled, yet no one was satisfied save the one to whom had been confided the privilege of mak- ing the arrangements. She had disappointed every other person, but she had suited herself. She had only now to manoeuvre a little further, and man- age matters so that she and Walter Ogilby should be as- signed to each other in the wedding programme, without her seeming too obviously to have had a hand in the matter.  &#xD;<pb n="244-245" xml:id="VAC7016-00000122"/> 244       WALTER OGILBY. CHAPTER    XXVIII. MRS. OGILBY had noticed the thoughtfulness of her son previous to the visit of the ladies from Milbank. She re- marked that after returning from the post-office he went directly to his own room. It was not his custom to do so, still it was not a circumstance to require comment orinquiry. Some little time after, as she was passing the library, the door of which was ajar, she looked in. Walter was seated at the window with a book in his hand, but he was not reading. His head rested upon his other hand, which was :! supported by the window-sill, and he was looking abroad  upon the green, shady lawn, with an air of abstraction. "Did you go to the post-office, my son?".      i "Yes, mother." "Did you receive any letters?" she inquired, anxiously. "No, mother" (arousing himself); "there were no let- ters for us." "Has the ride this hot morning been too much for you? ! Have you a headache?"  She entered the room as she spoke. "Oh, no, mother!" said he, assuming a more cheerful air. "Don't you know I anm growing older every day, and a little gravity is becomingr now and then?"' And he smiled and kissed her, to convince her that he was both well and happy. Mrs. Ogilby had not been blind to her son's growing at- tachment. What mother ever is? She rejoiced in it, for she saw in Miss Morton everything that would most accord with Walter's taste,--with his appreciation of what was lovely   W WAL TER OGILBY.       245 and beautiful in woman. She had confidence in his dis- cernment-she doubted not that he would be able to judge, before he had gone too far, whether his affection was likely to be returned. She had never made an allusion or an inquiry, but she understood very well that scarcely a day passed without his contriving, in some way, to be in the society of the object of his admiration. "If Miss Morton permits this," she said to herself, jE "without sho wing him that his visits are disagreeable, he  may then pr6Ceed with confidence." She could not help connecting his unusually grave de- portment in some way with this subject. "Were you at Milbank this morning?"' "Yes, I brought the young ladies their letters from the post-office." "I thought we should have seen Miss Morton again be- fore this." "They mentioned their intention of calling here to-day. I ought to have told you of it before. They will probably be here ere long." Enough information was furnished, as we have seen, in the course of the visit which succeeded, to enable the mother to understand why her son had returned thoughtful and preoccupied. The letter of which he had been the bearer to Miss Morton had made him uneasy. It was not an unusual thing, as she well knew, for cousins to correspond,-there was something in Mrs. Ells- worth's manner of speaking of this letter, however, to give rise to suspicion. Her son, too, might, when he pre- sented the letter to her, have observed something in her manner which had dampened his hopes,-for hopes, she was certain, he had, during the last few days, begun to indulge. The mother grew thoughtful while pondering these things. After the departure of the visitors, she seated herself on  &#xD;<pb n="246-247" xml:id="VAC7016-00000123"/> -246       WALTER OGILBY.  the piazza with Agnes. Walter, after attending the ladies to their carriage, had walked away towards the bank of the stream, and his mother and sister sat looking after hinm and watching his movements. Sometimes he stood still under the drooping willows; sometimes he sauntered slowly along, with his eyes upon the ground, as if in deep medita- i tion; now and then he would pick up a stone, and jerk it with a sudden motion into the water. All his movements indicated a mind not quite at ease. At length he disappeared in the direction of the garden, whither thev supposed he had gone, to give it a little of his customary supervision. Instead of this, however, he had re- entered the house through the library window, and, taking the book he had laid aside an hour or two before, he brought it quietly and seated himself in the parlor, near the place upon the piazza where his mother and sister sat.  He did not notify them of his proximity, for he observed that their conversation was about Alice, and he longed to hear all that they should say of her. "Oh, mamma!" said Agnes, " did not she look sweetly in that pretty chip hat? So much more lovely than Miss Ellsworth in her stylish, expensive dress and flowers I I could not help, all the time, comparing her to a white rose- bud. And oh, -mamma I let me tell you--but first, mamma, let me ask you one question. Don't you think brother likes Miss Morton very much?" "Yes, my dear, certainly. We all like Miss Morton very much." "But, mamma, I think brother likes her particularly. I think she likes him too."' Mr, Ogilby started. His heart beat quick as he listened to words so unhoped for. "You seem to have been making very close observations, my love," said her mother, smiling. "What makes you think that Miss' Morton likes your brother?"   WALTER OGILBY.         247 "Oh, several little things, mammal I will tell you one. At Mrs. Van Vorst's, last evening, we all walked in the garden after tea,land I gathered some elder-blossoms to dress our' hair with; and after we came back upon the porch, as I was putting sonle in Miss Morton's hair, brother, who was standing a little behind, handed me a white rose- bud to put along with theml. He thought she did not see him, I suppose, but she did, for she colored very much,- quite round over her ear, to the roots of her hair." "Miss Morton's color comes and goes so readily, my dear, with every change of feeling, that it can hardly be taken as an evidence of partiality for your brother. Pos- sibly she did not even know that he gave you the rose- bud." "Let me tell you the rest, mamma. When we went into Mrs.. Van Vorst's bedroom to put on our things, Miss Morton had to take out her flowers before putting on her bonnet. She laid down the elder-blossoms carelessly, but when she took out the rose-bud she held it in her hand, and just, in a quick way, threw her handkerchief lightly around it, so that nobody should observe it; and I took notice that she kept it in her hand, and carried it with her to the car- riage, all the time wrapped carefully in her pocket handker- chief. " "Perhaps there was some particular beauty in the flower, which made her wish to preserve it." "Oh, no, mamma! it was just like all the rest of Clarinda's rose-buds-like the myriads and myriads in Mrs. Ells- worth's garden at Milbank. Besides, if she only valued the flower as a flower, why did she hide it in her pocket- handkerchief? Why did not she put it in her belt, and wear it openly, as I or any one else would have done?" "You argue as if you had had a great deal of experience upon these subjects, my dear," said her mother.  &#xD;<pb n="248-249" xml:id="VAC7016-00000124"/> 248       WALTER OGILBY.             "Oh, mamma!" exclaimed the enthusiastic girl, " would not you be perfectly happy if brother should marry Miss Morton and bring her here to live with us? Would not it be too delightful?" "All these things must be as Providence appoints, my dear daughter. If it should be so ordered that your brother should win this lovely young lady for his wife, thele canll be no doubt that it would add greatly to thQ happiness of us all. We must wait and see. Your dear brother will seek God's direction in this, as in all the other steps of his life,-and then, whatever the result may be, it will be well." These moralizing reflections sobered somewhat the exu- berance of Agnes' spirits. They had a similar effect, too, upon anotherlistener, who returned to his former seat by the library-window to muse on all that had been said by his mother and sister, and to form his plans for the future, now so full of importance to him. C HAPTER    XXIX. MR. OGILBY had by no means an intention of sitting down quietly and waiting for the leadings of Providence. On the contrary, he was willing to take all the active steps possible in his own behalf. His first thought on the following morning was, that he had neglected to send his old friend, Captain Bradford, some cuttings of a choice plant which he had promised him. "It is rather late in the season," said he, "but I will carry them to him myself, and show him how to set them   WALTER OGILBY.         249 andout, and apologize at the samle time for my fortfulness. I can stop on my way to the post-office." Mr. Ogilby had lately adopted a new fashion of going to the post-office himself, instead of sending a servant as he had formerly done.  "But no,-upon reflection," he said, "Michael shall go for the letters. I will walk to the Captain's-it is but two miles, and the morning is delightfill. As I pass Milbank I shall be able to observe whether the expected visitors have arrived. I suppose we shall have to call on them immediately, since Miss Ellsworth depends so much on my helping to make the country pleasant to 'them.  He put great constraint upon himself, and did not stop at Milbank on his way. Indeed, it was too early; a call at that hour might have seemed presumptuously familiar. So he walked resolutely on, having satisfied himself, by the general appearance of things,-a greater bustle than usual about the house, sundry figures flitting through the rooms, and Cornelius at a distance leading up his pony from the stables,--that there were likely to be no more com- missions to him for letters from the post-office. His visit to the Captain's extended somewhat beyond the time necessary to give the requisite directions in re- gard to the cuttings he had brought. In the first place, he must eat one of Mrs. Bradford's nice, fresh cookies. It was in vain that he pleaded having but just finished his break- fast-the hospitable dame would take no denial. Then he must listen to her description of the " very pretty bake" her oven had. It was really a pleasure to bake in such an oven I Not but what she was glad to get through with it too, and sit down by the cool', shady door opening into the orchard, withya book, to rest herself. "All our folks laugh at me," said the good woman, "be.  &#xD;<pb n="250-251" xml:id="VAC7016-00000125"/> 250       WALTER OGILBTY.  cause I like to do such a thing as that; but for my part, I think it's handsome to read now and then!"  Mr. Ogilby was at length released, and permitted to set out on his way homeward. He was sauntering slowly down the road,--for the heat had by this time increased to such a degree as to interfere materially with the pleasure he had promised himself in his morning walk,--when, just t as he arrived at the lane leading off to Farmer Van Vorst's, he perceived Lebbeus stepping briskly towards him,- - Lebbeus, dressed in his Sunday suit, his white hat set it carefully on the top of his head, his well-starched collar reaching to his ears, and his broad-plaited shirt-frills pro- jecting in front like the sails of a windmill.     i Struck with a costume and appearance so unusual at this early hour of the day (for Lebby was a thrifty farmer and not wont to sacrifice the useful to the ornamentaD, Mr. Ogcilby stood still to await the greeting of his friend, and to receive the communication, whatever it might be, that he saw was ready to burst forth. "Well, now, this is what I call lucky! You are just the very person I wanted to see," began Lebbeus. "I  thought I might catch you by chance on the turnpike, going up or down; but if not, I was going right straight to your house. I wanted to see you and talk to you. I   i want to ask your advice. Come, let's walk back a piece, under the shade of thenm butternut-trees. I can't talk here in the sun. I'm heated enough already. I'm all in a flus- ter," with a sort of little confused laugh. Mr. Ogilby looked at his companion, whose manner was nervous and excited, such as to prepare him to become the confidant of something extraordinary. He turned back with him, and walked in silence a little way up the lane, until they came under the shade of the broad-spreading  butternut-trees.   WALTER OGILBY.        251 "t I guess we won't sit down," said Lebbells: "I can say what I've got to say better if I alm just walking about. Now, Walter, you see I've come to you, because I know you're my best friend, and you're a plain, candid, straight- forward person, who can walk up to a thing whether it's pleasant or not. If what I do, or rather, what I'm going to do, doesn't look right to you, you ain't the man that's afraid to tell me of it. Our folks at home ain't the best judges in the world, because they rather think everything I do is right. Clarinda wouldn't speak her mind, but I g guess she had some misgivings about the matter; so when I said, 'I'll consult Walter Ogilby,' she spoke right up and said, 'Yes, that's the wisest thing you've said yet. Go to Walter Ogilby, he'll soon settle your mind.' I don't think Clarinda meant anything, but somehow the matter does not quite take with her." All this exordium did not enlighten Mr. Ogilby in the least. He waited to hear something which should give him a clue to what he was expected to say, when Lebbeus, with "I guess I may as well come to the point at once," jerked a letter out of the breast-pocket of his coat, adding,- "I wish you would just read that, and tell me what you think of it."  Mr. Ogilby took the letter. To his utter amazement it was directed to "Miss Alice Morton, Milbank." He opened it and read as follows: "Forgive me writing what diffidence forbids me speak- ing  Our acquaintance has been but short, but permit me to say that what there has been, has made a most favor- able impression upon me.

And further, I should wish to tender you my affection on the broadest terms. I do not suppose it is likely (the subject not being mentioned before) that you have ever taken it under consideration whether I should be a person that would be likely to suit you or not; but if you would just turn the idea over in your mind, and make whatever inquiries you like to amongst my acquaintances round about, I think you will find that I stand pretty fair as to character and circumstances. Another thing, I cannot say how you might be suited with a farmer's life, but this I will sayfor myself, that I would not ask a young woman to have me if I did not know that I could give her a good home and take the best of care of her. As for work, it is what I should never ask or expect, only I take it every woman likes to see to things in her own house; but if she has good help and plenty of means that is no hardship, but rather a pleasure and satisfaction, as I expect every young person that is well brought up will think. As for kindness, this I will say, that I amlll not the person that would ever be guilty of any hard usage towards a woman. I believe God made them to be loved and taken good care of, and not neglected or mistreated. "One word more in conclusion. If I could receive a line from you in return, and that expressive of what I could name, I should consider myself the happiest of men. "Affectionately yours, "EBBEUS VAN VORST. "P S.--My parents and all my family (except the two youngest children) know of this step, and are very much pleased with it, and so is my friend--- "You see I have left your name out," said Lebbeus, looking anxiously at, Mr. Ogilby when he perceived that he had come to the bottom of the- page. "I was going to   WALTER OGILBY.        253 put it in after I found out what you thought of it. Well, what do you say about it? Will it do? Have I said enough?" asked he, as he saw Mr. Ogilby read the epistle a second time and then fold it without speaking. "Enough to show any woman who should bestow her hand upon you, Lebbeus, that she had every chance for happiness which the tenderness and right feeling of an honest heart could give her." Lebbeus' countenance brightened. "Do you really think so? I am glad to hear you say so --I am, indeed ;" and he extended his hand to shake that of Walter. "I wish Clarinda only knew what you say." As Mr. Ogilby marked his glistening eye, he felt how hard it would be to crush a hope that manifested itself by such emotions. Nevertheless he must act honestly by his friend, and he must act rightly by Miss Morton. He must not suffer her to be exposed to attentions, the annoy- ance and mortification of which would be all the greater, now that the vain and fashionable visitors from the city must be spectators of every demonstration that Lebbeus might think proper to make. He did not immediately relinquish the hand that Leb- beus had offered him. "You say you wish me to tell you the truth," said he, "and I pay you the compliment of believing you sincere. Most men ask advice, intending to take it only in case it agrees with their own previous determination. You will do differently, and therefore I do not hesitate to give you my opinion-to say, do not send that letter to Miss Morton." "And why not?" asked Lebby, surprised. "I thought you were pleased with it. Didn't you say so just now?" "There are two reasons for my giving you this counsel. The first is, that you are by no means so much in love with Miss Morton as you fancy yourself."  &#xD;<pb n="254-255" xml:id="VAC7016-00000127"/> 254       WALTER OGILBY. Lebbeus stared with astonishmet, and his sun-burnt visage grewsa shade darker. "You think her," continued Mr. Ogilby;' "the prettiest  young lady you have met with. You have been seized with admiration of her gentle, sweet manners,-toward your mother particularly,--and you have fancied that, because she exhibits no airs of pride or condescension, she can lay aside the habits of her whole life, the preferences which education has given her, and accommodate herself to a sphere which in many respects, as you must acknowl- edge, differs materially from what she has been accustomed to." "I don't see," replied Lebbeus, touchily, " why se should put on any airs, I am sure. She is only a country minister's daughter, and I guess a very poor one from what I have seen. It is not every day that she'd have such an offer as this. I know what country parsons are in New England. Why, when I was down at Barnstable two years ago, there was the Congregational minister there had five daughters, all old maids, with all their taste and education. I think as much of these things as anybody-I've a right to, my mother's brought me up that way; but I guess a good, broad farm, and a nice, new house like mine, that will be finished come fall-and money in the bank besides-not to speak of what father may leave me; and he can't live forever (though I'm sure, I wish he would with all my heart). Well, what I have to say is, that I rather guess it isn't often a girl situated like that, gets a chance to refuse such an offer. If she does, she deserves to die an old maid,-that's all." "You are getting warm, Lebbeus," said Mr. Ogilby, smiling. "I may be getting warm, but I know what's what, Wal- ter, as well as any man. Why, there isn't a girl round here, unless it's Gitty Ellsworth, and nobody cares for her,   XH.      LWALTER     OGIL B I       255 :'! that wouldn't jump at such an offer as this. Tlere's Lockv Kuypers, who will have all her grandfather's money and be one of the best matches in the country; well, I could have her any minute that I'd say the word. And if you go to talk of education and books, who comes up to her, I -should like to know? I don't believe Miss Morton, with all her fine education, can Write poetry, and Locky writes a great deal. I don't know as I ever showed you that piece of her's beginning ' In solitude are many charms.' Then she wrote a beautiful Acrostic on young Fitzgerald that boards there-I don't think he behaved very handsomely  about it either, for that matter." "How so?   Did he show it without the lady's permis- sion?" asked Mr. Ogilby, not sorry to observe the change that was taking place in the current of his companion's ideas. "Worse than that, by a long sight. It happened this way. We were out in the mountain one day, Fitzgerald and me, to shoot black squirrels,-they were pretty plenty last fall, and awful troublesome to the corn. Well, we had shot a considerable many, and our wadding was just about giving out. Says 1,' Haven't you got some wadding of one Sort or another?' Fitzgerald hunts first in one pocket and then in the other, and finally what does he do but opens his pocket-  book and takes out a folded piece of pink paper, all done up in a fanciful sort of way? I knew what it was the minute I cast eyes on it, but I thought I wouldn't let on, I'd ask him what it was, just to see if an Irishman ever could tell the truth. Well, for once he did, and I most wished he hadn't. ' Oh I' says he, just as saucy as anything vou ever saw in your life, ' it's only a bit of an Acrostic;' and he takes and tears off a bit anTtwists it up, and rams it down his gun with as little politeness as if it had been a scrap of a bill from the grocery store. I could not stand it, I tell you.  &#xD;<pb n="256-257" xml:id="VAC7016-00000128"/> 256       WALTER OGILB F. Says I, 'That's a very unhandsome way to treat such a piece of poetry.'. 'Oh,' says he, as independent as a wood-chuck, ' I've got nothing else. I used up the last lock of hair out Hi of my pocket-book just when you was round on the other side of the bank there.' I tell you what, if it didn't make me perspire a little! And you may guess it was the last time I ever went a shooting with Mister Fitzgerald." "But, Lebby," asked his friend, " how did you happen to know that Acrostic by sight when the young man opened his pocket-book?" Lebbeus looked a little foolish. "Well, I suppose I may as well tell," said he. "You see, when Locky Kuypers wrote it she showed it to me, partly because she did not want me to feel hard about it, in case I heard of her sending it to Fitzgerald, and partly be- cause she wanted me to help hbcorrect and punctuate it; for I write a little poetry myself sometimes. When it was all e finished she copied it out on a sheet of pink paper that I had got myself over at Newhurg-so it was not strange that I should know it again." "And did Miss Locky ever know what became of her Acrostic?"                        ; "Not unless Fitzgerald bragged of it himself. But I just :! said to her in a friendly sort of way. ' Locky,' says I, 'I  would not write any more lines on these Irishmen,-they  don't set any great store by such things, and they ain't worth the trouble anyhow.' I was her friend, you-see, and did not want her to put herself in the way of getting her feelings hurt."  "You showed that you were indeed her true friend; one that would run the risk of incurring her displeasure in . gl order to save her from pain," said Mr. Ogilby. - Lebbeus looked hard at him for a moment.  "I understand you, Walter," said he, "and you needn't ;    WALTER OGILBY 2l be afraid of my being displeased with you. Furthermore, I shall take your advice, for I ain't the man that wants to get the mitten from any woman  And when I do marry, I guess, after all, it's better to get a wife that looks up to me than one that looks down on me. 'But you said there was two reasons-was the other anything about yourself?" Mr. Ogilbystarted. "About myself? Hoaboutnly- self?"                 ' "Nothing, only I did not know but you might have some pretensions; and if so, you might just as well have spoken out at once. You might have known I was never going to stand in the way of such a good friend as you have always been to me." Mr. Ogilby had great difficulty to forbear smiling at the absurd disinterestedness of this assurance, but he preserved a serious air, the more so, as he observed Lebbeus again unfolding his letter. It was only, however, to tear it into fragments of the smallest possible size, which he scattered to the four winds of heaven, saying, philosophically,- "I don't know as I should feel so very much cut up about it, now that I've talked the matter over, only that mother will take it a little hard at first. She had rather set her heart on the thing. As for Clarinda, I'm pretty certain she'll be glad at the turn matters have taken, for somehow the plan didn't take with her-and then she thinks all the world of Locky Kuypers." 22*  &#xD;<pb n="258-259" xml:id="VAC7016-00000129"/> 258       WALTER OGILB I CHAPTER XXX. THERE was no better success in returning past Milbank than there had been in the walk up. The only person to be seen was a fashionable-looking young man, sauntering upon the piazza, smoking a cigar. This was an addition to the party of whom Mr. Ogilby had not before heard, and his presence occasioned some speculation. "Probably a lover of one of the Miss -Westbrooks, who could not bear a separation, and has therefore accompanied them, into the country." Such was Mr. Ogilby's conclusion, he being rather in- clined just now to look upon every young man as a lover of somebody. Should he call and pay his respects at once to the new- comers? No; upon the whole, he would wait and bring his sister with him in the evening. Alice had not forgotten to wonder from time to time whether Mr. Ogilby had quite restored her to his good opinion. The question not admitting of an immediate solution, however, she busied herself in endeavoring to entertain the young visitors, and this she found by no means a difficult task. She had only to admire the new dresses and fashionable ornaments which, with no undue delay, were unpacked and spread out before her, and to be properly impressed when she was shown for the first time a lace bayadere, and dancing-shoes spangled by. Pardessus. The interest was quite satisfactory with which she list-   j '1 " s:YWALTER OGILBY.                259 ened to all the young ladies had to tell of their trip lup the river--how few beaux there had been on board the boat--and those not worth looking at--how disappointed they had been, when they stopped' for a few minutes at the dock at West Point, to find that not an officer, not even a cadet, came on board,--nobody to be seen but the sentinel, and a few soldiers at a distance I They did not see how anybody could call West Point a pretty place--to them it looked shockingly dull! e Alice had sympathy to give, too, on learning of the vexatious behavior of their relative, Mr. Halford, a young Southerner, who had accompanied them expressly as their escort from the city, but who, instead of attending to them, as was his duty, had been always looking out for scenery and views and such things; yet she could not quite agree with them when they averred that " there was nothing on earth more tiresome than a young man who had a taste for painting--such things had better be left to artists, whose business it was!" Mr. Halford was a nephew of their mother's, and to his especial care the sisters had been committed for the few weeks of their visit. His quiet manners and fastidious ideas upon the subject of female deportment made him a very safe and suitable guardian, particularly for his younger cousin, in this her first emancipation  from parental control. * Anne Eliza, it is true, made herself amends for the re- straint he occasionally imposed by ridiculing her Cousin Pinckney's tastes, and calling him "an old granny," when she was quite sure he could not hear her; yet it could not be denied that she played her role of " an unsophisticated child of nature " to a less inconvenient extreme than usual when his watchful eye was upon her. The arrival of so many visitors furnished Gertrade with   &#xD;<pb n="260-261" xml:id="VAC7016-00000130"/> 260       WALTER OGILBY. the pretext she had been wanting, for proposing to share Alice's apartment. "I must give up my own room to my' cousins," said she, "for Mr. Halford is to have one of the spare rooms, and my mother wishes to reserve the other in case of visitors coming with John Peter. His room, of course, we never touch. I should always prefer to have a room to myself, and so, I suppose, would you; but situated as we are, I must accommodate myself to necessity." : Alice tried not to understand this as a hint that she was in the way; she said, very pleasantly,- "I have so few things that I can give you nearly all the drawers in the bureau, and the shelves in the closet, if you wish to make an entire change from your own room." A constrained "Thank you," from Gertrude, completed the arrangement. How Ally regretted the loss of her cherished retirement, now so much dearer to her than ever before I She ha/d so many things to think of I So many little treasures that she could have solaced herself with gazing upon Now these must be put aside. Every moment, by day or by night, must be open to the eye of the indifferent and the thoughtless I After tea the young people went to call on Aunt Lany. Alice would gladly have remained behind, but Gertrude had no intention of leaving her to the chance of a visit from Mr. Ogilby. She put on a look of surprise at the proposal. "Are you tired of the society of my cousins already?" she said. "Since Mr. Halford and Cornelius have been obliged to go to the Landing in search of Catlyna's missing trunk, it would seem that the least we can do is to try and make the drive pleasant to the girls."' Alice yielded without further opposition. As they were   W i /WALTER -OGILB Y.                 261 returning from their call they passed the carriage con- taining Mr. Ogilby and his sister on their way to the village. "What a splendid-looking fellow!" cried Anne Eliza. "Who is he? Why, he is the very perfection of beautyl I couldn't see his figure well, but he must be at least six feet high, and I adore tall men. Have I ever seen him. before?" "That is Mr. Ogilby," said Gertrude. "What! your rich neighbor? I think I did see him once; but- he must have grown since," laughing, "and grown handsome, too. Why doesn't he get married? Can't. anybody catch him? Ally, have you tried?" Gertrude drew her lips into a significant smile, which was not lost on Alice, who was sitting opposite her. "Girls, I give you fair warning," pursued the little beauty, "I am goingtosetmy cap for that young man, and don't any of you interfere. Papa says I am to go into company next winter, and I may as well be practising a little beforehand. Ally, do you hear what I say? What are you looking at, off on the side of the mountain? Do you expect to .see any bears or catamounts there? It is you I am talking to. It is only you that I am afraid of. Gitty and Lyna have done their best there ever so many years, and haven't succeeded." "You are getting too old to talk such nonsense," said her sister. "Don't you know," lowering her voice, "that Jake can hear every word you say?" "We won't talk about getting old, then, it is not a safe subject," said the younger, flippantly. "But I'll tell you one thing, Lyna- I think it is quite enough to have Cousin Pinckney making big eyes at me every other word I speak, without your lecturing me so much. I have-come into the country to enjoy myself and to have a   &#xD;<pb n="262-263" xml:id="VAC7016-00000131"/> 262       WALTER OGILBY. little liberty, -and I declare, I might just as well be at home with papa and mamma." When, on their return home, they received Aunt Aul- chy's cheerful announcement of a promised visit from Mr. Ogilby and his sister, who, having called a moment and learned that the young ladies were absent, had gone to execute some commissions for their mother at the village. Anne Eliza called out with childish glee to Alice,- "Oh, Ally! come right up-stairs with me! rhat ele- gant fellow," lowering her voice as Alice approached, so that her cousin, Mr. Halford, should not hear her, "Mr. Ogilby, will be here presently, and I must go and prepare myself to make an impression. Come, you shall tell me what I look best in. You have seen him, I suppose, and found out something of his taste. Is he fond of simplicity? Is he a bookish man? Shall I talk to him about the Cor- sair and Lall]a Rookh?" "I dare say you will soon find out," said Alice, laugh- ing, "what subjects will be agreeable to Mr. Ogilby. He is not a reserved person. He will furnish topics to entertain you and be entertained upon." "Oh, no I he will think I am a mere child; like as not he will hear Lyna or Gitty calling me so, and then he'll not think it worth while to waste his time on me. But I am a young lady--I am to come out next winter--papa says so. Now, Ally, fix my curls nicely for me-make me look just as pretty as you can, for I am determined to kill Mr. Walter Ogilby dead at the first shot. There," surveying herself all around in the glass, "how do you think he will like me?" How easy it was for Anne Eliza to rattle on in this way about Mr. Ogilby I And how strange it seelned to Alice! She would never have dreamed of mentioning his name except in answer to some question. She could not   WALTER OGILBY.        263 even hear it mentioned without something of an effort to look calm and unconcerned. She was inclined to doubt the success of the young lady's determined attack on Mr. Ogilby's heart. Aunt Clara had early put into her hands that excellent book, "A Father's Legacy," and from it Alice had learned that "men never value what they are too secure of,"-"that a woman should never let the man she loves suspect the strength of her attachment." "If I remember right, that is what Doctor Gregory says," repeated Alice to herself.' "It seems to me a strange maxim, but I suppose it must be correct. Though why, if a woman loves worthily, she should hide it away, and keep it a profound secret even, after she is married, has always been a mystery to me.'" Alice did not ask herself whether, by acting upon this rule, Aunt Clara had possibly secured to herself the life of dependence and single blessedness which she was now en- joying-still less did she think it necessary to enlighten her young companion as to the surest means of captivating, effectually, a man like Mr. Ogilby. She obeyed her be- hests, and "made her look as pretty as possible,"-pretty enough certainly to satisfy the vainest or the most fastidi- ous-and then both descended to the parlor. Everything looked bright and gay at Milbank when Mr. Ogilby and his sister joined the company. The young strangers were fashionably and becomingly dressed, and appeared to advantage, while occupying themselves with the books, and flowers, and pictures by which they were surrounded.  Most of the latter had been brought by Mr. Halford; and that young gentleman was at the moment sitting by Alice and commenting upon a drawing that he held in his hand. She was in the best of spirits, and her lively remarks amused her companion, while the correct-  &#xD;<pb n="264-265" xml:id="VAC7016-00000132"/> 264       WALTER OGILBY. ness of her criticisms, and her just appreciation of the merits of the piece, interested his artist tastes. Mr. Ogilby gave a keen glance at the two as he entered, which did not escape Gertrude. A general movement and introduction took place. Alice came forward to speak to her friend Agnes, who was diffident and ill at ease among so many strangers; but her aunt having at once seized eagerly upon the young lady, to give her a detailed account of the arrival of the visitors, and of all the good and bad fortune they had met with since leaving the city, Alice took the nearest vacant seat; and Mr. Ogilby, having paid his compliments to the rest of the company, soon found his way to the hair next her. They had conversed but a short time together when the youngest' Miss Westhrook, first making sure that her Cousin Pinckney's eyes were occupied elsewhere, crossed the room, and, drawing an ottoman directly in front of Mr. Ogilby and Alice, seated herself, and without ceremony joined in the conversation. The subject, whatever it was, afforded little field for her lively nonsense, and she soon tired of it. Presently she possessed herself of Alice's hand, and be- gan caressing and fondling it in a manner not at all to the taste of the owner, who in vain endeavored to withdraw it from her clasp. Anne Eliza held it fast, and suddenly exclaimed, with abrupt familiarity,- "Why don't you wear more rings, Ally? See how many rings I have," dispaying her pretty fingers. "All young ladies wear rings, don't they, Mr. Ogilby?"And she looked up in his face with an air so free, so unabashed, that Alice could not but blush herself at the liberty. "But, Ally," she went on, "you have only one ring! It is a very curi- ous one, though. Dear me! Mr. Ogilby, do look! Did you   WALTER OGILBY.          265 ever-see such a curious ring? That must be an engage- ment ring, mustn't it? Two little hands clasped over a heart, and two little, tiny braids of hair! Oh I how senti- mental!" IThe pained expression of Alice's countenance, as she suc- ceeded in releasing her hand, was not lost on Mr. Ogilby. To relieve her from this silly banter he hastened to in- quire,- "Did you ever meet with some stanzas on an Emerald Ring by   " "Oh, yes! I know-by the Mad Poet, or L. E. L., or somebody," cried Anne Eliza, interrupting; "I've read them a thousand timles. What a sweet idea! Ally, if you are engaged you must make your lover give you an eme- rald ring, then you will know, when he is away from you, whether he is faithful or not. 'If faithful, it is like the leaves in spring; If faithless, like those leaves in withering.' You know the lines by heart, I dare say." "It could not be a very consoling occupation," said Alice, "watching and watching for indications of change in our absent friends. It would be admitting to one's heart the possibility of their inconstancy." "Perhaps we look rather to assure ourselves that there is none," said Mr. Ogilby. "People are not expected to be very philosophical in love matters. I suspect that most of us would have a little superstition upon that sub- ject. And are we not all, at times, unconsciously and in spite of our better judgment, influenced by signs and tokens?" "Some of us, without doubt," said Alice, a little archly. "Your countryman, ' Hynd Horn,' for instance. You re- member,- 'Seven lang years he had been on the sea, And Hynd Horn has looked how his ring may be."' 23  &#xD;<pb n="266-267" xml:id="VAC7016-00000133"/> 266       WALTER OGILBY. "Now, I think," said Mr. Ogilby, "that if you had not seen something quite natural in that superstition, you would not have remembered the lines so well." "I cannot think it quite natural to be suspicious," said Ally. "On the contrary, I think we are slow to admit the idea of change or unfaithfulness in those we love. We make every excuse, every explanation to ourselves, rather than yield up our confidence, our full trust. Oh, no! we can never be looking for inconstancy, because we judge of the truth of others by what we find in our own hearts." "That is the case where our love is sG happy as to meet a return; but how if there is still uncertainty--doubts- fears?" Mr. Ogilby hazarded these words in a low tone, as he observed Anne Eliza engaged in a noisy discussion with Cornelius, who stood at a little distance. He was not aware how much expression he had thrown into his manner, until recalled by a sudden change in the countenance of his colm- panionj as she glanced across the room to where Gertrude stood by the piano. Mr. Ogilby's eyes followed the direc- tion of'hers, and he, too, was startled by the searching look which was fixed upon them. What did that glance convey? That it boded no good was certain. That Alice interpreted it as he did was obvious, from her turning away without reply to his question, and then rising and joining a distant group. He would have braved all and followed her, but that might be exposing her to pain and annoyance ; for Ger- trude's look was not simply one of curiosity--it had in it also something of menace.   WA L TE RO GILBY        267 CHAPTER XXXI. ALICE and her cousin had scarcely reached their own room at night before Gertrude began,- "Upon my word, Ally, Mr. Halford will have no reason to admire the courtesy of our Northern young ladies if you make a practice of treating him as you have this evening." "Mr. Halford!" said Alice, with surprise. "How have I been wanting in courtesy to him?" "Why, he could not feel much flattered that you should leave him, in the midst of his efforts to entertain you, the moment Walter Ogilby entered. And, as if it were not enough for you to have crossed the room to meet him, you finished by seating yourself in the very place most likely to attract his notice and invite his attention." Alice struggled to subdue her rising feelings. "-I went forward," said she, "because I saw that Agnes,- that Miss Ogilby was uncomfortable in the m dst of so many strangers. I thought it but kind, as an acquaintance, to help to relieve her embarrassment." "You very soon left her to herself, however, and devoted yourself to entertaining her brother." "No; your mother called her from me to tell her of the loss of Miss Westhrook's trunk; and as vour father had comrn menced talking to Mr. Halford about the cotton factories just being established at the South, I would not interrupt them, but naturally took the chair whichl stood next me. Was it equally wrong," inquired she playfully, "for Anne Eliza to seat herself on the ottoman directly at Mr. Ogilby's feet?"  &#xD;<pb n="268-269" xml:id="VAC7016-00000134"/> 268,       WALTER. OGILB Y "Anne Eliza is but a child. What would appear natural and graceful in her would be decidedly unbecoming in, an -older person-one who is supposed to have seen something of the world and the customs of society. I do not know that Mr. Ogilby is a particularly vain man, but if he is, he will draw his own conclusions." Alice was much hurt by this second indication of her cousin's suspicion. "Is it really true that I appear to be seeking Mr. Ogilby's attention?" she asked herself. "What must he think of me? How have I shown a wish to attract him? I hope he has not suspected that such was my intention I If he has, how he must despise me for it I I hope he has not thought so; I will be more guarded in future in accepting politeness from him."- Striving to dismiss these and all other unpleasant reflec- tions from her mind, she applied herself to her nightly exer- cise of reading and devotion, and then bidding her cousin "good-night," was soon lost in peaceful, innocent slumber. Several plans were discussed on, the following morning for disposing of time for amusement and advantage during the first few days of the young people's visit. "We must, of course, go the rounds of all our friends and relations in the neighborhood to-day," said Gertrude, " and to-morrow we may as well make a business of driving up to Hopewell, to see old Aunty Rapalje. Since the girls have to go, as a matter of course, every time they come to visit us, we had better get through with it at once before we have pleasanter engagements." Aunt Rapalje was an invalid relative, with a large for- tune, and no children to inherit it,-consequently, though crabbed and disagreeable in the extreme, she was an object of interest and kind solicitude to all her nearest of kin. It was the custom to appoint an early day for carrying the   WALTER OGILBY.        269 New York cousins to pay their respects to her--they were as nearly related as the Milbank family, and had as good a righc to keep up their claim for a legacy by civility and attention. "We shall have to set off early in the morning, and re- turn in the cool of the evening," said Gertrude. i"The only difficulty will be in managing so as to accommodate all of us, for father always wants one pair of horses on Saturday, to go to the Landing. I have always insisted that our carriage was a great deal too small-it has room for but four inside."7 "I am sure that will do wery well," said her mother; "you four girls-and Mr. Halford can drive you. I dare say he'd like nothing better." Mr. Halford was not present-he had gone to enjoy an hour's sketching among the rocks and rapids. "I should dislike very much to trust our necks to Mr. Pinckney Halford's driving," said Gertrude, laughing. "He would drop his reins without ceremony, and take to his pencil, at every, fine view upon the road. He is scenery-struclk, I think.7" "Then leave Mr. Halford behind-he won't care." "That would not be- very polite to the girls' cousin-a stranger, too," said Gertrude, hesitatingly. - "Then why don't you go in the carryall?

"No; jolting twelve miles in that horrid thing is not to be thought of," pursued Gertrude, in an uncomfortable tone. 23*  &#xD;<pb n="270-271" xml:id="VAC7016-00000135"/> 270       WIA[LTER OGILBY, "Suppose we put off going till Monday, when we can have the other horses," suggested Catlyna. "No; next week there will be engagements for every day; we have made up our minds to go totmorrow, and we will manage it somehow." Gertrude was determined to make sure of Ally's cK pany. There was to be no possibility of a tete-a-tete with Mr. Ogilbyv. She was tat ease for to-day, as he had passed the previous evening at Milbank; for to-morr9ow she could not feel so secure. She was in hopes that her cousins would have seconded her mother's suggestion, with a- "Never mind Cousin Pinckney;" but Catlyna' did mind Cousin Pinckney; she had a particular value for his so- ciety, and would not voluntarily have given it up. As for Anne Eliza, she cared too little for the perplexities of others to think of helping thenm out of them. Gertrude was not quite prepared for the ready solution of her difficulty. "You can leave me behind, if you were proposing that I should be of the party," said Ally. "I have an engage- ment for to-morrow.?" "An engagement! Where, pray?" "At Ferndale, to pass the day." Gertrude's countenance darkened with anger and sur- prise. "This, then, was a part of the interesting conversation you were holding with Mr. Ogilby last evening I Very polite to my cousins, it must be confessed, to invite one of the circle, and leave the others out! So much for the courteous and well-bred Mr. Walter Ogilby!" "My invitation did not come from Mr. Ogilby-it was given me by his mother several days ago," said Alice "Then why have you never mentioned it before?" "Nothing seemed, until now, to call for any mention of   WALTER OGILBY.        271 it. I accepted the invitation conditionally on my aunt's approving of it." "Approve of it? Yes, my dear, to be sure I do," cried her aunt, greatly relieved. "Now there needn't be any more trouble about it. I will go down with George when he goes to the Landin', and spend the day at Cousin Abra- ham's, and we shall all be enjoyin7 ourselves just as we like, without one thinkin' the other is happier and better off than what she is. But, Ally, my dear, how will you get there?" "Mr. Ogilby is to call for me." This was the climax for Gertrude. Still she kept silence, striving to preserve a calm exterior, and to hide from those around her the intensity of her rage and mortification, and inwardly vowing to make herself amends, at some future day, for all that she was now suffering. She was quite ready to excuse Alice from accompany- ing the party on their round of visits this day,-the very sight- of her, for so many hours, would have been a pun- ishment to her. So Ally was left at hoime to write her ( letters, and to help Cornelius, as she had promised, to make some flies for his fishing. "Yes," said Cornelius, "Ally and I are going to have a good time to-day. She is always ready to do anything I ask her, which is more than I can say of Gitty dowering his voice). Ally, I wish you were my sister. I do like you, first-rate." His mother caught the words. "Cornel'us," she called, "come here and pick up my ball of thread."    . When he had complied she winked at him, then draw- ing his head towards her, and putting her mouth quite close to his ear, she whispered,- "Don't say anything about that now. Some day I'll tell you a great secret." i.  &#xD;<pb n="272-273" xml:id="VAC7016-00000136"/> 272       WALTER OGILBY. Tie boy stared, but as his mother was apt to make mysterious and confidential communications about very trifling subjects, he returned to his occupation without giving the matter much heed. It was a new business which Alice had undertaken in her wish to oblige Cornelius. She was a docile pupil, but he was not a particularly skilful teacher. After two or three hours, however, spent in ingenious contrivances on his part, and diligent efforts on hers, to carry out the executive portion of the business,-an occupation which was beguiled by a stream of anecdotes and school remi- niscences such as Cornelius imagined could not fail of ex- citing a deep interest in the mind of his cousin,--he pro- nounced himself satisfied with their joint production; and, with as little delay as possible, trudged forth with line and basket to try the virtues of his new bait at a spot below the rapids, which Mr. Ogilby, the evening before, had promised to show him. Cornelius was a great favorite with Mr. Ogilby, and his honest, frank, affectionate disposition made him always an acceptable companion to Agnes and Jessie. Of all the Milbank family his visits were the most frequent and un- constrained. With a shrewdness inherited from his father, he possessed much of his mother's communicativeness of disposition; and now that his heart was so full of his young cousin, to whom he had taken from the first a grelat fancy, he was likely to be a welcome guest at Ferndale. He did not return until evening, having, without much difficulty, been prevailed on to remain and take tea with the young people. He was in the happiest spirits when he came back. "Ally," said he, when he had found his cousin, "here I am, and the flies worked beautifully,--not but what Mr. Ogilby's were rather better,--Walter always gets all his   WALTER OGILBY.         273 from York. Come, let's sit down here on the settee, and I'll tell you all about it. Didn't your right ear burn this afternoon about five o'clock? Some people were talking of you just then. I did my share at paying you compli- ments-no, not compliments, for truth is no flattery, as I said there. We were all on the piazza down at Ferndale, and I was telling the girls what fun we had had this morning making our flies, and that was what begun it. Walter did not say much, but I guess he heard every word, for, though he was sitting there pretending to read, I noticed, when I went to help myself to his knife out of his vest-pocket, he hadn't got any further than the title-page of his book."  Alice took herself to task for the satisfaction with which she heard of these commendations fromn a quarter already too much in her thoughts. They repaid her for any loneliness she might have felt on that long summer's day; for, spite of her various occupations and her habitual contentment of spirit, she had, she could not tell why, felt lonely. Even though she had enjoyed the comfort of writing a long letter to her father, and had afterwards sat down to read to her uncle, who, having been too near the workmen while they were blasting the rock for the, site of a new dye-house, had received solme slight fragments in his eye,-- yes, spite of the solace of the long political pamphlet, and the interest inspired by her uncle's comments and elucida- tions thereon, she had caught herself frequently saying,-- "How long Cornelius is gone! They must find very good fishing to keep him so I Silvy, has master Cornelius come back yet?" Now that he was sitting beside her on the back piazza, giving her a detail of his day's adventures, all things seemed bright and pleasant again.  &#xD;<pb n="274-275" xml:id="VAC7016-00000137"/> 274       WALTER OGILBY.: "I suppose they laughed a good deal at our clumsy efforts," said she. "I hope you told them that manufac- turing insects was new business to me as well as to you." "Laugh! no indeed. Why, Walter offered to exchange even his whole stock for mine. I would not take advan- tage of him, though, for his are really elegant, and ours,- you know, Ally-why, ours are very nice to be sure, first- rate, only you know, Ally, they can't of course be ex- pected to be quite equal to those fine, foreign, expensive ones. Walter Ogilby is such a generous fellow I He was really in earnest; but I said, 'No, I thank you, I could not think of robbing you; but if you'd like to pick out two or three of the very best of mine, and give me two or three of the very poorest of yours in exchange, why, so be it.' I guess when he comes to try ours, Ally, the next time he goes out fishing, he'll think," said Cornelius, laughing, "he's got a little bit of a bite that he did not bargain for." CHAPTER      XXXII. IT was one of the loveliest and most radiant of June mornings.  The breezes were fresh and balmy, the foliage in its fullest verdure, before the heat and drought of sum- mer had come to rob it of a single charm, the air vocal with strains of joy and thanksgiving poured forth fron thousands of the irrational creation, in rebuke of the more gifted, yet less grateful of God's children. Amid   the unrivalled magwnificence of Nature-sur- rounded by so much to elevate and delight-it would seem that every heart should have been glad, every spirit   WALTER OGILBY.         275 harmonious. So, at least, thought Ally, as she contem- plated the day before her. Never had the sun been so bright, the earth so beautiful! Yet she saw with pain that there was one to whom their brightness and beauty failed to give contentment. Her cousin Gertrude moved about with a cloud on her brow and an abstracted air. "What can be the reason?" thought Ally. "She planned the excursion to Hopewell herself, and carried it out in spite of every obstacle. Can it be that she is dis- pleased because I am going to Ferndale without her and the others? If she dislikes Mr. Ogilby so much, I should think she would be glad to have me make the visit by my- self. Can it be that the doctor is mistaken? Or is she really exercising a degree of self-command in treating Mr. Ogilby with such gracious affability-quite as much, it appears to me, as I have ever done?" Gertrude had not alluded to Ally's contemplated visit since the discussion of the previous morning, yet the sub- ject scarcely left her thoughts for a moment. ;[   What if Mr. Ogilby should avail himself of this oppor- tunity to take some decisive step! What if the invitation had been a plan, a contrivance to enable hiim to do so! What if he should declare his love for Alice, receive her promise in return, and thus destroy the wheb she had been V so industriously weaving in her brain, and'of which only the first filaments had, as yet, been actually spread I But would Walter Ogilby so far forget what was due to his mother's guest?

Certainly not, unless accident, or, what was very unlikely, the perception that such a theme would not be distasteful to his visitor, should tempt him to- an unpremeditated avowal. Still, as one can never calculate on the chances which may  &#xD;<pb n="276-277" xml:id="VAC7016-00000138"/> 276       WA L TER OGILB l. arise in the course of a single day--as Mr. Ogilby, with his ardent, Scottish nature, and his prompt, resolute character, was certain to seize upon the first allowable occasion to pour forth feelings, which he had no longer the power to hide, Gertrude could not but regard this visit as the most unpropitious circumstance possible for her own future hopes. Her heart was filled with bitterness and jealousy; and her long pent-up feelings requiring some vent, she thus gave way for the benefit of her poor mother,- "Can anything be imagined more absurd and annoying than paying court, as we are constantly doing, to a sickly, fanciful, old woman? And, after we have worried our- selves to death, and done penance, by bearing all her humors, as if they were the most delightful and desirable of earthly privileges, we are no more certain-of her for- tune then if we had stayed at home. and behaved like sensible people. I really wonder, ,ma'am, when you are always proclaiming that we have more money than we need, or ought to spend, that you can encourage your chil- dren in such meanness!" "Why, Gitty, my dear," said her mother, distressed, "what is the matter with you, this mornin'? Yesterday you seemed all for goin'l Why! You would not have our relation's money left to strangers, would you?" "It would not be a matter of the slightest consequence to me," said Gitty, who had, at this monlent, more weighty causes for solicitude. "There is one thing certain-it is very unreasonable in Aunty Rapalje to live on so, and give her heirs expectant so much trouble." "Well, my dear, I don't know what we are to do,- I'm sure," said her mother, plaintively. "Nobody would like to tell poor old aunty that she has lived long-enough; and I don't suppose it would maike any difference if they did. People wery seldom die because they' are wanted to;   WALTER OGILB Y.        2" they seem to like to hold on as long as ever they can. And Aunty Rapalje was never famous -for bein' wery obligin'. I am sure, for my part, I often think how much better off she would be if she should happen to be taken away." Gertrude was not the only one on whose hopes of en- joyment a shadow had fallen. Mr. Halford had by no means approved the arrangement of the day before, by which Miss Morton was left at home, although he had felt himself too much of a stranger to make any comment. Now, however, as he saw Gertrude and his cousins make their appearance in their dark silks and straw bonnets, all prepared for their drive, while Alice, in her simple morning- dress, sat at her work in the window, he could not refrain fron an inquiry,-- "How is this, Miss Morton? Are we to be deprived of the pleasure of your company again to-day?" Alice explained her engagement. "This is a great disappointment," said he; then, ob- serving that they were alone, he added, "I had depended upon a companion to-day to whom my occasional extacies, as they are termed, would not be a bore. You have an eye for the charms which Nature here displays so lavishy, and a taste to appreciate them. I had been pleasing my- self with the certainty that for once I might venture to admire without danger of appearing ridiculous. I must own, I am sadly disappointed!" Alice could only thank him, and recommend him to enjoy everything precisely the same as if he had some companion to whom he could expatiate on the beauties which met his eye. He thought she looked very lovely as she said,- "If you are compelled to keep your raptures to yourself through the day, you can make yourself amends by de- 24  &#xD;<pb n="278-279" xml:id="VAC7016-00000139"/> 278       WALTER OGILB Y. scribing all you have seen and enjoyed after we both return this evening." But Alice, though she wished him and his companions a delightful drive, would not compro- mise her sincerity by expressing the slightest desire to be of the party. After they had set off, and while she wags making her- self ready for her visit, the words of Gertrude, would occa- sionally obtrude themselves upon her recollection,- "If Mr. Ogilby is a vain man, he will draw his own conclusions." She did not believe he was a vain man--she wondered if, from aught that she had said or done, he had drawn any conclusion that would lower her in his estimation! It was not until she found herself seated beside his mother in the carriage, not until she noticed his manner, so full of respect, his every movement, so courteous and attentive, that she was convinced of Gertrude's having misjudged him and his inferences. This persuasion restored her gayety of spirits. Her natural buoyancy, repressed during the last few days by some unexplained cause of thoughtfulness, no less than by her cousin's want of kindness, returned with all its charm. She felt that she was among those who loved and valued her; and her manner, at first a little reserved, soon resumed its affectionate sprightliness. Everything at Ferndale indicated that the "favored guest" had been expected. The rarest and most fragrant flowers had been gathered, the choicest books laid in readiness, the finest engravings, the different works of art or curiosities of Nature, all placed within reach for her entertainment. The library at Ferndale was a particularly pleasant room in the morning hours. It looked out upon the shaded lawn, and its windows, opening at pleasure to the floor, were stur-   1WTALTER OGILB I        279 rounded by climbing plants which filled the air with their. perfume. It was to this apartment that Mrs. Ogilby repaired with her young guest for the time that would elapse before Agnes and Jessie, their morning engage- ments completed, should join them. It was very delightful to Alice, neglected and overlooked, as she too often was, at her uncle's, to be made the object of such solicitous kindness. Philosophical as we may com- pel ourselves to be, the estimation in which we are held by others can never become a matter of indifference so long as just pride and self-respect remain,--and Alice, although she never looked out for slights or neglect, was yet pos- sessed of a sensibility that obliged her to feel both when they became too palpable to be mistaken. Mr. Ogilby had obviously no thought but for her enter- tainment. His mother was present; but she soon occupied herself with some little employment,-a piece of netting, which she took care to find more than usually compli- cated, that'she might leave the young people to each other. Mr. Ogilby read aloud to them occasionally a - passage from some new publication, or he showed Alice some specimen from his cabinet, or sketch from his port- folio,-but more frequently all other things were laid aside,   that they might give themselves entirely to conversation. He talked to her of what he had seen in foreign lands-of people he had met, and characters he had studied-of the  homes of those of whom she had read-the noble living and " the sainted dead." He brought forth all his varied stores to gratify her thirst for information or her taste for the humorous or pathetic; and in doing so his manner !  took a tone of tenderness and softness such as he had H&amp;  never before ventured to indulge. He perceived that her l heart was clinging more and more to hill, and although he i%; knew that it was unconsciously,-that in her youth and otf  &#xD;<pb n="280-281" xml:id="VAC7016-00000140"/> 280       IWALTER OGILBY. innocence she did not realize the strength of the tie that was binding her to him,--yet he now felt certain that in time he should become to her more than home or kindred, or aught else save the One who should be supreme and above all. There was ground for this hope beyond even any indi- cation her manner afforded. They had been standing together in a window a little apart, and Mr. Ogilby had been opening the petals of a flower to give her, as he said, "a little lesson in botany." They had talked of Darwin, and Sir William Temple, and Young, and various other authors who have written well upon the subject of a garden; and, by a natural transition, to Milton and the Garden of Eden, Paradise, earthly hap- piness, and so forth, as young people whose hearts are full are apt to talk; when Alice, after a moment's silent contem- plation of the landscape without, remarked,-- "You have an earthly Paradise here at Ferndale! There seems nothing wanting to its perfection!" "You think so! To me it seems that one charm yet might be added!"Without appearing to notice, she went on,---  "One's home is always a Paradise, or ought to be., It does not, after all, depend upon outward beauty or splen- dor,-though the gifts of nature unquestionably add to its charms. But it is only the love and affection that reign here which make up the true happiness." "Your home seems a very happy one to you 1" said Mr. Ogilby. "It is-it ought to be-I have very much to make me happy. And not the least among my blessings," added she, laughing, "is the consciousness of being very important in my own home. I am a person of great consequence there. 7'   WALTER OGILBY.         281 "I do not doubt it. I can fancy the happiness of the whole circle depending upon you. What will they do then"--he hesitated a moment- "what if the idea should be ever suggested of your leaving that dear home and finding one elsewhere?'" "That is a subject we have sometimes talked of," said Alice. He looked at her inquiringly. She went on, "A poor clergyman, you know, is seldom able to make a magnificent provision for his family. If my dear father should become disabled in any way,-should lose his voice, for instance, as is too frequently the case in his profession, -it might fall to my lot to aid him in my own support, or that of others whom I love. He has given me all the ad- vantages of education in his power, and I could, if neces- sity required, avail myself of them' by becoming a teacher or a governess." She did not raise her eyes as she said this, so the look of mingled tenderness and admiration with which her com- panion regarded her, was quite lost upon her. That this young creature, so full of life, of everything that was cap- tivating, could ever seriously have looked forward to such a career, was an idea so painful that he was glad to turn from it to the more comforting one implied in her remarks t -the certainty, iiamely, that no Cousin John Peter, nor any other rival, had thus far had a share in the plans or probabilities of her future life. After a moment's pause he said,- "You can hardly have weighed well all that is involved in such an undertaking, or you would not speak of it so philosophically." "'Indeed I have. Why not? It would, I am well aware, call for great sacrifices,-the greatest of all to me would j be the possible separation from my home and family; but  if that were the path of duty, I believe I could set my face I             24*  &#xD;<pb n="282-283" xml:id="VAC7016-00000141"/> 9 82       WALTER OGILBY. to walk in it. We can always do, you know, what we feel to be right.1" Alice did not see the half smile with which Mr. Ogilby said to himself, "This then is what I have to do-con- vince her that her path of duty through life is by my side, and see if she will walk resolutely in it!" He believed that she would. Former fears and anxieties were all forgotten; and he gave himself up to the happiness of the present hour, and the anticipation of a greater still that the future had in store for him. His mother saw all this with delight. She was again the Margaret Elliott of former days; and she lived over,.in the experience of her darling son, the joys and hopes, as she had the fears and sorrows, of her own early youth. "We began wrong," said she, sadly, to herself, as she went over the past. "We asked counsel only of our own hearts. Walter will do differently. In all his ways he will seek the guidance and blessing of his heavenly Father --and he will receive it." A nd the heart of the mother went up in an aspiration to Him who alone can sanctify the wills and affections of his creatures. CHAPTER XXXIII. AFTER a time Agnes and Jessie made their appearance. They had been occupied not only with their usual morn- ing lessons, but also with some little household duties which their mother had, for this occasion, contrived for them. Their greetings of their young visitor were as warm and affectionate as if she had been a  friend of long standing.   ISM W       WALTER, OGILBYl.    . 283 em!  Since she had heard the notes of the whip-poor-will on gI the first evening she passed at Ferndale, Alice had longed to visit the home of the wild bird among the rocks and rapids. "The place is not far distant," Agnes said; "just a pleasant walk. But you will not expect to see the   shy fellow himself at this hour," she added. "He is only visible just at dusk; and then he can hardly be distinguished from the bark of the old, mossy stump or log which he chooses for his seat.7 4I   It was the wild scenery around his haunts, however,   which formed the attraction for Ally. A walk to the rapids g  was therefore at once proposed by the young girls. Mr. Ogilby was inclined -to object on account of the heat, until ! ,reminded by his miuther that the path was, for the greater 1  part of the way, well shaded, and that, later in the day, they would be expecting the visit of good Mrs. Van Tine. It was therefore decided to set forth; and sun-bonnets and parasols were brought without delay. A Agnes, proud of her tact and experience, would have left her brother and Miss Morton to the uninterrupted enjoy- ment of each other's company; but Jessie, who from the first had attached herself with great pertinacity to their guest, wluld not leave her side for a moment. In vain I '  her sister called her to come and walk with her, or strove to tempt her by the pretense of having found some rare flower or insect which Jessie must wish, above all things, to see. No pleasure to the little girl was to be compared with that of looking up from time to time into Miss Mor- ton's face, and listening attentively to every word which fell from her lips. Their walk led for some distance through fields sloping to the verge of the water, and shaded here and there by broad-spreading trees.. Passing out of these by a stile, the party at length came upon a spot where, seated cosily  &#xD;<pb n="284-285" xml:id="VAC7016-00000142"/> 284.       WALTER OGILBI:  beside a narrow road which separated the cultivated grounds from what was termed "the wilderness," was a neat and picturesque cottage. Though of small dimen- sions, it had an air of the most complete comfort, with its flower-garden in front, and long beds of vegetables at the side, every part of which seemed kept in scrupulous order. An elderly woman, in a comical little mob-cap and starched chintz kerchief and apron, had come to the gate of the gar- den, and was looking wistfully across the fields, in the di- rection of the mansion. The sight was an inspiration to Agnes. "There, Jessie," cried she, "now we must. stop a minute and ask Mrs. Byrne about your bantams. But what can be the matter with the poor old soul? She looks quite worried 1"' There was indeed an anxious expression on the coun- tenance of the dame, which cleared off in a measure at sight of the company approaching. "Are you looking for Michael? It is hardly time to ex- pect him yet," said Mr. Ogilby, taking out his watch as he spoke. "I believe I should find it difficult, myself, to' persuade him to quit his post before the clock strikes twelve " "And why should he quit it, sure? Why shouldn't be work day and night, if it be for you, sir, who's been the only best friend he iver had in this counthry? What 'ud Michael Byrne have been, only for yerself? I was looking out for the boy-that I won't deny; but I thbought it had been a'thrifie later. The hours seem long, this morning!"  "I hope nothing has happened to make them appear more so than usual," said Mr. Ogilby, kindly. "Oh, no--no; your honor!" said the dame hastily, but with something of a  sigh. "Won't you and the young             i   WALTER   OGILBY       285 ladies come in and rest a bit? Asking your pardon for the bouldness." "We are not at all tired, thank you-we are going to take a longer walk," said Mr. Ogilby, at the same time carefully shading his companion from the sun, with the parasol which he carried,-" we must hasten on our way." But Jessie had not yet satisfied herself in regard to the bantams which Mrs. Byrne had promised her, and she was prompt with her inquiries. "Oh, the bantys, to be sure 1" cried the dame. "I had a most iligant pair that the rats had spared me, besides the old ones. r I waited, as I told you, just till they'd come to some size, and I was minding to fetch them to ye, dear, just three days ago, when, all of a, suddent, the little he-biddy was a missing. I clucked and called, and the poor little she-biddy went a hunting round, all lost and forlorn-like, but nothing could we see or hear of the banty. I thought for, sure that Tom Carroll, who'd been down here of an errand, had carried it off--it 'ud been just like one of his thricks-more's the pity of some that can niver learn chris- tianable ways, not even among good christianable people"  (This remark was thrown out as if with it the good dame hoped to relieve her mind of some burden too heavy to bear.)-"Well, dear," she resumed, " it Was not he, after all (the saints forgive me for my bad thought); I was going awhile after into the pasture fornenst, and I saw something white lying under the blackberry bushes by the stone wall. I mistrusted in a minute what it might be, and sure enough, what was it but my pretty little he-biddy, dead and choked to death!" "Dead! Choked!" cried Jessie, with a look of wonder and pity. "Och, yes, dear I ye see I had tied a bit of red ribbin round the necks of the two of them that very morning,  &#xD;<pb n="286-287" xml:id="VAC7016-00000143"/> 286       WALTER OGILBY. thinking to make the little white things look the pret- tier to take to you; and whether the little biddy didn't like it and went to take it off, or whether it was an accident, anyhow, he scratched his little fut right through it and tugged and tugged till he just hanged his poor little self. So now, dear, there's nothing to be done, but wait for another brood, for the poor little she-biddy would be too lonesome and moping-like to go among strangers " Jessie's tears were ready to flow at the sad fate of her. promised pet, but she agreed with the dame that the wid- owed partner must be left in the home to which she was accustomed, for the present; and having now a subject of chief interest to discuss with Agnes, sle suffered herself to be hurried away, leaving her brother and Miss Morton to follow at their leisure. The road soon branched:off into a narrow pathway con- ducting under the brow of high overhanging rocks. Many fragments of these had been broken off, either by some con-  vulsion of Nature, or by the gradual action of the elements, and precipitated into the stream below. That this had been in many cases not a recent work was evident, not only from the moss and creepers, but from shrubs of consider- able size growing green and fresh in the soil which time had accumulated. The hand of man was nowhere visible, except so far as it had removed whatever might render the progress of the pedestrian difficult or unpleasant. As much of the wildness of nature had been left as sufficed to pre- serve every attractive feature. Alice, carefully guided, and in some places almost sustained byA her companion, was not long in reaching a spot more elevated, where she could look down upon the stream, as it foamed and chafed over a bed of rock along which it was rushing in a broken current. The arching cliffs overhead, from which depended the  hemlock, the arbor-vitae and various other evergreens in all   WALTER OGILBY.         287 the luxuriance of their rugged nature, afforded a cool and fragrant shelter to a rustic seat, so placed as to command the finest view of the wild and picturesque scene. "Let us rest here," said Mr. Ogilby. "You have gone far enough--I must not suffer you to fatigue yourself. Here is something to be enjoyed by one of your poetic tempera- ment." And he held back the branches until he had placed her to the best advantage-then seated himself on a frag- ment of rock near her. "Do you like this place?" he asked, observing that she did not immediately speak. "Oh, it is charming! charming I The rocks, the wild- rushing stream,the majestic mountain stretching beyond in the background I Then the grateful balsamic fragrance of the pines! Nothing can be more delicious 1" In order to enjoy more fully each feature of the prospect, Alice had taken off the muslin sun-bonnet with which Mrs. Ogilby had furnished her for her walk. She had pushed aside the damp curls from her forehead, until the white tem- ple, with its blue veins, and the small delicate ear, moulded as of finest wax, were visible. There was an expression of thoughtful happiness in her soft clear eye, and on her parted lips, that was infinitely charming. Was it alone the contemplation of the objects before her that spread over her countenance this air of sweet satisfac- tion? Was it but the heat of the day that mantled her cheek with its brightened bloom? And was it only the exercise of walking and climbing the rugged pathway that occasioned the quick palpitations visible through the light muslin of her dress? Mr. Ogilby was thus questioning'to himself, as they sat for some minutes in silence-she gazing down upon the water at her feet; he vainly striving to still his rising piulses that he might address her calmly.  &#xD;<pb n="288-289" xml:id="VAC7016-00000144"/> 288       WALTER OGILBY. Thoughts pregnant with weal or woe for his future life were chasing each other tumultuously through his bosom. Might he venture? Dare he, ought he, to seize this opportunity, the only one that might be vouchsafed him for days, perhaps for weeks? Alice was the first to speak. "How cool and quiet! how perfectly secluded this spot is! It might be the retreat of a hermit." "Yes, it is quiet and beautiful. Everything around us is beautiful-rock and water, shade and sunshine! Did you ever think,"-he paused,-" did it ever occur to you, how one monosyllable, spoken in reply to a question that might be asked, would change the whole face of nature to the view?-could give darkness and sorrow, and almost de- spair, in place of what was before so bright and glorious?" Alice raised her eyes a moment to his, startled by the tremulous depths of his voice. There was no misunderstand- ing the ardent gaze he bent upon her. She turned away, troubled, hesitating-embarrassed for a reply. In her agita- tion she raised her hand to pluck off a spray of laurel buds which hung just within her reach. The branch resisted for a moment, then suddenly yielding, came apart in her grasp, bringing with it a bit of sharp, jarggoed thorn which had be- core interlaced with it. An exclamation, as she dropped the flowers and wrapped her handkerchief around her hand, showed that she was hurt. Mr. Ogilby was by her side in an instant. "What is it?  You are wounded. Let me, I entreat you, do something for you." And he attempted to take her hand. "No, no, it is nothing-a mere scratch," she insisted, drawing away her hand, anfiholing it tightly compressed against her breast, while the close contraction of her lips, and the paleness which spread itself over her features, told that she was suffering. .... :]   WALTER OGILBY.         289 Mr. Ogilby called to his sisters, who were at no great dis- tance, hunting for specimens for Jessie's new I herbarium. "I Miss Morton has hurt her hand badly," he said, " or rather, a wicked branch of thorn has done the mischief." "'Oh, cruel thorn! to wound the silly sheep!" said Ally, with an attempt to smile, as she purposely misquoted the friend of her childhood, Miss Taylor. "Do not laugh when you are in such pain, I beseech you," said Mr. Ogilby. - He offered his arm, which she ac- cepted without hesitation-indeed, she could not well have done without it. "We must take you back to my mother, and let her minister to your wound, since you will not allow me that poor satisfaction," said he, a little reproachfully. "How fortunate that it is my right hand!" said Alice, affecting great cheerfulness; " now I shall have a reason- able excuse for being idle all day! I scolded myself a little before we came out, for not having once unrolled the work I had brought with me-now my conscience will be quite at ease and I can spend the rest of the day among books and flowers without the least self-reproach." "Do not give yourself the trouble of all those brave efforts to disguise the pain you are suffering," said Mr. Ogilby. "You forget my profession, and that it is useless to attempt to deceive me." He was flattered, however, by her evident wish to re- lieve him from uneasiness. They arrived at; the house, and Mrs. Ogilby, on being informed of what had happened, took Alice into her own apartment, which opened out of the parlor, to examine the extent of the hurt, and make the proper application. a' Why, my dear child i" exclaimed she, as she unbound the handkerchief, " how could vou possibly bear this with so little complaint?

Don't be frightened," said she, kissing her, as she observed her color quite fading away. "It will not add much to your suffering s-Walter is a pretty good surgeon." Ally was not frightened-she did not think she should mind the pain much; but she could not conceal from her- self that she felt a greater degree of nervousness than should have been occasioned by a hurt finger. She made no further objection, however, and Mrs. Ogilby called to her son, who was waiting in the parlor to hear her report of the case. He brought his 'little case of instruments, which bhe thoughtfully laid on a chair outside the door-and he se- lected "the glittering forfex" with an air as calmly profes- sional as he could command; yet when he had taken the little hand of the patient in his own, and performed the slight operation, binding up the finger afterward with lint and balsam, an observer would have been forced' to ac- knowledge that, although very tenderly done, it had upon the whole been accomplished with less unflinching self- possession than would have been becoming in a skilful practitioner.  z     .   WALTER OGILB .        291 CHAPTER XXXIV. "GHT as Alice had been disposed to make of the wound she had received, it was, indeed, as Mrs. Ogilby had said, no trifling one. It not only occasioned her a good deal of pain, but it quite disabled her. This furnished an excuse for a thousand little attentions. She must be fanned-her food- must be divided at table--she must be read to- amused in every possible way. She thought a whole fin- ger might almost have been paid for by such kind solicitude. Mrs. Van Tine arrived in due time, but her visit, she said, must be short-" her man was a little out of sorts, and she was hurrying home to him. I don't know as I could have stopped any way to-day, only for the sake of seeing the youngm lady here," said the good woman. "We've talked a deal about you, sin' your visit," she continued. "Poor Freelove declared she couldn't set herself to work about anything that day after you went away; but she did set right down and make up a collar, and pleat the ruffle to it as much like yours as she could. My man likes to tease her, and he just hinted that it looked rather more like the slats of the dairy window, than like what she took pattern by--and for a wonder she didn't fire up, but only fetched a sithe and said, ' Oh I dear sus! I was so lone- some after Miss Morton, that I couldn't steady my fingers to do my work very nice.' Then she sent up to Pokipsv by one of our boys who was going there, and bought her two or three yards0of narrow, black velvet ribbon to fix up her cha;ngeabella silk, just like the gown you had on that day."  &#xD;<pb n="292-293" xml:id="VAC7016-00000146"/> 292       WALTER OGILB.  Ally laughed at Mrs. Van Tine's grave, quaint way of describing the spinster and her proceedings.     ! "I ought to feel grateful for the compliment, and try and do something handsome for Miss Freelove in return," said she. "Mr. Ogilby, have you no opening in your school for a new teacher? You know that is one of her vocations. Or is there not somebody we can marry her to? Don't you remember she told us she had 'hindered round a good while and had not seemed to pick up any- body.'" "I am afraid I have no talent at match-making," said Mr. Ogilby. "Ah! then you should ask some one to help you." "That would undoubtedly be the best way," said he, with a quiet smile. "Well--then--don't forget. I shall constitute myself your adjutant." "I shall not forget, depend upon it." Mrs. Van Tine and Mrs. Ogilby smiled, but Alice obh. served nothing-she was watching the approach of a calr- riage down the road. The arrival of other company was the signal of departure for Mrs. Van Tine, who took leave with many friendly expressions to Alice and hopes of seeing her again some day. The visitors proved to be Mr. Teunis Van Benthuysen and his sister. They were full of their plans and arrange- nients for the excursion to West Point. "Gertrude called yesterday to talk the matter over," said Miss Maria. "The party is to be deferred now   only about ten days-that is, until her brother is quite re- leased from all engagements connected with his examina- tion." - "After that," said Mr. Teunis, "we must take the first fine day that the tide serves, and be all in readiness to go on   WALTER OGILBY.        293 board by eight o'clock in the morning, that we may reach the Point before the sun gets too high and too hot. Let Ime see--this is the eleventh-next Saturday will be the eiglh- teenth--Sunday--Monday. Monday is a bad day to start on, isn't it, Maria? The ladies have always their prepara- tions to make the day beforehand, and those cannot, I sup- pose, be done on Sunday. Let us look in the almanac, and see how it will be about the tide. Miss Agnes, have you an almanac?" Agnes produced one. "It is excellent of its kind," said she. "It tells you, too, what the weather is to be." "Not much fear about the weather," said Mr. Teunis; "it has now been dry for a long time, and our June rains will not fail us about the middle of the month. Then it will be all fine again. Well, well"--(examining the calen- dar)--"' this is unfortunate. Saturday or Sunday or Mon- day would either of them be a better day than Tuesday: however, we must make the best of it, -tlat's all. If the tide runs out before we get there, I can set all the young- sters to rowing. But we must make a point of being at the rendezvous, Ben IIyer's front stoop, as early as half-past seven, if possible. As for the more minute arrangements, who is to be invited and who not, you and I, Walter, are to go to Milbank on Monday afternoon, and-settle all that." "These are points which Miss Ellsworth would doubtless prefer to settle without our help," said Mr. Ogilby. "As I am nlyself but an invited guest, it would not become me to select the other members of the party." "Well, you have Gertrude's invitation to come, and you may do as you please after you get there. Nobodyv will compel you to give an opinion, of course," observed Mr. Teunis, laughing good-naturedly. "If Miss Gertrude asks me for my ideas upon the subject, I shall merely specify that she shall leave out her silly, disagreeable cousin, Jane Ann 25*  &#xD;<pb n="294-295" xml:id="VAC7016-00000147"/> 294       WALTER OGILBY. ' Roseboom, who is always placing herself under my wing, ? as she calls it, and keeping me from enjoying the society of those far more agreeable to me." "Why don't you have a lady of your own-one that be- longs to you, Mr. Teunis?" said Agnes. "Then the sin- gle ladies would not annoy you with their attentions." "Why, my dear, I ought to have been married, that is a fact--and I once came very near it, but I was disappointed." His sister looked at him with surprise, as he uttered this, in a grave and melancholy tone. Both Agnes and Jessie drew nearer to him. "Oh, tell us all about it!" said the latter, with looks full of curiosity and interest. "You do not mind mamma, and brother Walter, and Miss Morton, I am sure." "No, my dear, not in the least-I am willing that all the world should hear. Sympathy in our distresses is one of the greatest sources of consolation! Well, when I was much younger than I am now, I was excessively in love with a charming young lady. She seemed as mtuch attached to me as I was to her--we talked the matter over, and both agreed to get married the first moment we could escape the observation of our friends." "Did your friends object to it? Could not you go to church and get married, and have a wedding like other people?" asked Jessie. "Oh, no, my dear! that would have been too common- place. Our friends were perfectly willing, but we were very romantic-we preferred running away, or something clan- destine and exciting. Well, while we were waiting for a good opportunity, it happened that the young lady was riding out with her sister one day, when the horses took fright and behaved very badly. A young gentleman, a cousin of my own, was walking along, and seeing- the situation of the party, he ran immediately and helped them out of the car-   rTWALTER OGILBY.        295 riagoe. My charmer just gave one look at him, and seeing what a handsome, elegant fellow he was, she fainted right away in his arms, so that he was obliged to carry her into the nearest house, and rub her hands and temples, and try all sorts of ways to bring her to. Well, when I heard of this I went to her, and asked her what it meant; that she had never fainted away in my arms, though I liked such atten- tions as well as other people; and I told her that if she must faint away hereafter, I had rather it would be in favor of some homely fellow like myself, than of a handsome, con- ceited fop like my cousin. Would you believe it? She took offence, and put on all the airs possible." "And what became of her?" asked Jessie, who still be- lieved Mr. Teunis in earnest. i Why, she had fainted so gracefully and naturally that she quite won my cousin's heart. He came to me and told me that if it made no great difference to me, he would like to have me resign all pretensions to the lady, which I did at once--for I was afraid this habit of fainting might grow upon her, and occasion me some trouble after our marriage." "Come, come, Teunis, you have talked enough non- sense," said his sister, rising. "The reason he does not marry, my dear, is because he will not leave his sister lonely and forlorn. Is not that a better one than the story he has been making up for your amusement?" It was with no very pleasurable feelings that Mr. Ogilby saw the little dearborn from Milbank drive up to the gate, almost immediately after the departure of Mr. Teunis and his sister. His first thought was, that it had been sent to convey Alice home, and thus interfere with the pleasure he had promised himself of driving her in his gig in the even- ing. Most grateful, therefore, to his sight was the stout, comfortable figure of Aunt Aulchy,.as she stepped, or rather plunged from the vehicle to the no small jeopardy of her  &#xD;<pb n="296-297" xml:id="VAC7016-00000148"/> 296       WALTER OGILBY. son Cornelius, who was assisting her to alight. Before he. could reach the gate she was calling to him,- "Oh, Mr. Walter, here we are! We have been spendin' the day at Cousin Wanderwoort's, and I told Cornel'us we might as well drive down here and get Ally, and save you the trouble of takin' her home." "I am most happy to welcome you at Ferndale," said Mr. Ogilby,- " but you must excuse me if I decline your kind intentions in regard to Miss Morton. As I brought her away from Milbank, I feel bound to return her myself, safe and sound." "Oh, wery well, just as you please I and since your mother is so kind as to ask me, I don't care if I stay and take tea-But, mercy on me! my dear, what's the matter?' as she observed Ally's hand in a sling. Ally related the story of her hurt. "There, that's it! I've had it on my mind all day that somethin' was a goin' to happen. I said to Cousin Letty this wery mornin', says I, ' Cousin Letty, I do believe some- thin' will happen before long, for I dreamed last night of losin' a tooth, which is a sure sign ;' but I thought perhaps it was nothin' but the weddin' that was a comin' off--and, by-the-by, weren't you all wery much astonished to hear of this match?" She was gratified with the assurance that they had' all been greatly surprised. "Yes; well, it's a wery good thing that' one of those girls is a goin' to be married-such a stritg as there is of them! One weddin' is sure to bring on another, you know- --if not a sister, then a cousin, may-be." Here there was a glance at Ally. "And, Mr. Walter," continued she, " you've no idea how we fixed it about the young people that's to stand up. To be sure, I think it would have been more agreeable perhaps, under the circumstances, to have had   WALTER OGILBY.        i29 Ally for one of the bridesmaids instead of Catlyna. How- ever, Gitty settled all that, so we must put up with it 'Ally don't mind. Her turn will come by-and-by, and for something better yet, perhaps. But what are you walkin' away for, as if you'd no kind of interest in the matter? Not that I've a right to say anything on the subject till Anthony gives out his inwitations himself--but you must prepare yourself for something wery unexpected." Mr. Ogilby assured her he would hold himself in readi- ness to be very much surprised whenever a communication firom Dr. Van Wyck should authorize him to do so; and he went on making up a bouquet for Ally of the flowers he knew she loved best, leaving Mrs. Ellsworth to pour forth bits of news to his mother, from her inexhaustible budget. CHAPTER    XXXV. -THE almost interminable communications of Aunt Aulchy' were at length ended. The tea was over-the strawherries and other delicacies had received their meed of praise, and she was ready for her return to Milbank. To her dismay, Cornelius now announced that he was . under the necessity of driving home by a cross-road, in order to execute a commission for his cousin, Garret Van- dervoort, "What on earth!" exclaimed his mother. "You don't mean that you are goin' to take me up that dreadful, stony -piece of road? Why, Cornel'us, I shall be jolted to death." "Oh, no, mother! the road is very good; and I am a careful driver, you know," drawing himself up to look as tall as possible.  &#xD;<pb n="298-299" xml:id="VAC7016-00000149"/> 298       WALTER OGILBY. "No, I don't know any such thingt. You most broke my neck comin' here, a tryin' to drive as fast as Walter. I shan't go any cross-roads home, that you may depend upon. " "But, mother, I have a; very important errand for Cousin Garret. He wished me to call and ask Mr. Wilcox to bring him down a couple of patent scythe-snaths from Po'kipsy to-morrow, and I promised him I would." "Patent scythe-snaths!" said his mother, in a scornful tone. "What does Garret want of such things, I should like to know! Why, ain't the old-fashioned ways good enough .to mow his farm. with? A cheatin' Yankee in- vention I Excuse me, Mrs. O(rilby, but I never saw a patent thing that wasn't a cheat. There was their patent save-all for candles. Many a good candle did I cut into pieces and stick them on the ends of the little tin points--, and, after all, they did not last as long as if I had left them whole. I'll warrant, if Garret's father knew what he was about, he'd soon put a stop to havin' his hay cut by any new-fiangled Yankee notions. Like as not it will all be spoiled! Cornel'us, why need you meddle?" "I didn't meddle, mother. Garret asked me if it would be out of my way to drive around by Mr. Wilcox's and leave his message, and. I said no I did not wish to be disobliging. But since you don't like to go that road, I'll take you home first, and then drive back again-it will not keep me very late." There was no alternative but for Mr. Ogilby to give up the anticipated pleasure of driving Alice home in his gig, and begt Mrs. Ellsworth to take a seat with them in the carriage, leaving Cornelius free to execute his cousin's collmmission-an invitation which the good lady, who had no admiration for her son's style of driving, accepted with the greatest alacrity. )   WALTER OGILBY.         299 Mr. Ogilby, although at first greatly disappointed, soon reasoned himself into a tolerable state of acquiescence. t"After all, it-is best as it is. I might have been be- trayed into speaking of myself and my own feelings; and wearied and suffering as she is, she ought not to be dis- tressed by an allusion to thelu. I have said enough to show her that -my happiness is in her hands. She is too high-principled to trifle with me. I will be patient. Thrown together as we must now continually be, there cannot be wanting opportunities of declaring myself more fully-of learning, with entire certainty, what I have to hope. " And Mr. Ogilby devoted himself with renewed assiduity to his duties as host and physician, until he had conveyed the ladies safely to Milbank, and taken his leave of them there. The Hopewell party. had already returned, after a day of fatigue and disappointment. Aunty Rapalje had been more indisposed, consequently many degrees crosser, than usual. Though she would have-resented as a slight the failure of her youngP relatives to visit her, she was just in a humor to let them understand that they had chosen the worst possible time for doing so. She intimated very plainly that of all her largo circle of relatives, Gerardus Westhrook stood highest in her good graces-declaring, for Gitty's benefit, that she should cross out of her books, without hesitation, any one who had not sense enough to appreciate her favorite as he deserved; while, for the comfort of the young city cousins, she gave it as her opinion that no one brought up in the great Babylon of fashion and folly, let them try as they might, would ever succeed in gaining so worthy and right-judging a young man for a husband. Mr. Halford, to whose share had fallen merely an indif-  &#xD;<pb n="300-301" xml:id="VAC7016-00000150"/> 300       WAALTER O GIL BY. ferent welcome, a bad dinner, and unsynmpathizing, un- congenial society, came off rather the best of the four.. Anne Eliza, with her usual flow of childish spirits, was but little cast down by the untoward events of the day. She was ready to torment Ally on her return with a series of minute and impertinent questions upon all that she had heard, seen, felt, or spoken during her visit to Ferndale. "To think of your being there, enjoying yourself a whole day in the society of that delightful fellow, while we were having such a dismal time! Come, Ally, tell me all about it. Your finger hurts you, I know. Let me help you to undress, and then I will lie down here beside you, and we will have a nice talk. I know you will like to-talk about him.  How little-she knew Ally, if she imagined that she would wish either to speak of Mr. Ogilby or to'hear his name mentioned at this moment, or in such a manner. It was true that her hand pained her-so did her head. Her brain was in a whirl-her heart palpitatingr with excite- ment and agitation. Yet she must appear calm, and answer question after question as best she might-must bear all the raillery and nonsense of her giddy companion I Could she but have been alone-have been vouchsafed one hour of solitude to commune with her own heart and spirit! Have been left to ponder in darkness and in silence all that this day had revealed to her! Gertrude was more solicitous than her little cousin to hear all that had occurred, but not for worlds would she have asked a question. While apparently engrossed in folding and putting aside her different articles of apparel, she took care, however, not to lose a single one, of Ally's good-tempered answers to the ill-bred inquiries addressed her.   WALTER OGILBY.        301 "What! never talked of love and poetry when you were up there at the rapids; and when his sisters, too, were not by to hear! Well, after all, I do not think my cause is in much danger. Ally, you did not make a good use of vour time. If I had been there, I would have thrown such glances as would have melted the heart of a stone. If I had had such an opportunity as you have had to-day, I would have made Walter Ogilby in love with me,-yes, and offer himself to me, too, before evening. I believe you will die an old maid, Ally, with all your beauty and good sense  Do you know (whispering, her) you could catch Pinckncey Halford as easy as not, if you would only take the trouble? I see him sit and look at you when you don't know anything about it." Gertrude was by this time quite satisfied that nothing decisive had taken place. She had suspected as much, from the circumstance of Mr. Ogilby's having brought her mother honme with Ally in his carriage. "If there had been an explanation he would have made a point of having her, in 'some way, all to himself," she had com- forted herself by saying. "Fortunately, Ally is so back- ward and retiring that it will be some time before he gets a chance--that is, if things are rightly managed." She lhad watched, too, from the drawing-room window, Mr. Ogilby's leave-taking upon the piazza, and had not been able to detect that he had pressed Ally's hand at parting, or that there had been any conscious intelligence in the looks which had passed between them. Slhe had observed that he spoke a few words to her in a low tone; probably so low as not to be heard by Mr. Halford, who was standing in the doorway of the hall, and Ally had re- plied simply by an inclination of the head. This and the graceful lifting of his hat had terminated their adieux. Having ascertained all that it was important for her to 26  &#xD;<pb n="302-303" xml:id="VAC7016-00000151"/> 302       WALTER O GILB I' know, she peremptorily dismissed her little cousin to her own apartment, and Alice was left to quietness and  repose.                - But with quietness repose came not. The certainty that she was beloved, that she was the chosen of one so  noble, so manly, so far surpassing all that she had before known or imagined of human excellence,-it was more almost than she could realize. "Could it be?" she asked herself. ." T Was it indeed true?"  Yes, he evidently had wished her to see it--he had shown it unreservedly in every word and action! He was v too upright to deceive-he was hers, and she was to be his, for time and for eternity I  She could not sleep. She rose and sat by the window,  through which the moonlight was streaming. How beau-  tiful was nature at this silent hour! The graceful outline of the dark mountains, the broad fields checkered with the shadows of the spreading chestnuts, the cattle sleep-  ing in groups, the picturesque cottages scattered here and there on the rising grounds, the glancing waters in the  valley below!  "Those rushing waters--they will soon be rippling p past Ferndale! Is he awake and gazing abroad as I am?  ^ Or is he asleep, and dreaming "  She was startled from her train of thought by the voice  of her cousin. "Your visit to Ferndale seems to have added another  shade of romance to your taste, Ally. Pray, is it your intention to sit by the window, till morning.?'? : Thus admonished, Alice left her contemplation of out-  ward objects, and sought that slumber which, bhowever,  did not visit her eyes until after the gray dawn had be- come visible. ^ b             ' j    WALTER OGILBY.        303 She slept soundly at last--too soundly to dream. She was awakened by a banging of doors-a hurrying and out-a calling of voices. The first object that met r eyes was Anne Eliza, fresh and beautiful in her bright nmmer muslin, with hat and scarf on as if prepared to out. She was hunting for something; and, as she ran und opening and shutting drawers and disarranging all ings within her reach, she called to her,- "Oh, Ally! do you know anything of my parasol? I ft it down-stairs last night, and Silvy has put it out of e way somewhere. I want it this instant. I am going ride up to church with Walter Ogilby and his sister- ey are down in the parlor. They asked after you, Ally, Id I told them you were fast asleep." "They must have thought I set a very indifferent ex- uple for Sunday morning," said Alice, vexed at having 'erslept herself. "Mr. Ogilby said your friends might hope you were ,t suffering still from your wounded hand, if you could st so quietly; but I told him what I heard Gitty say, at you had been sitting up by the window all night. Oh, lly, you would have thought he was an old doctor, a. ousand years old, if you had seen the long face he put , and heard him say, so solemnly, 'how very impru- nt!'" And Anne Eliza ran out of the room, to seek sewhere for the missing parasol, hardly noticing Ally's quest that she would send Silvy to aid her in dressing. 'hen she reached the carriage, however, she remembered call out,- "Oh, Silvy! run up-stairs and help Miss Alice dress; e's got a lame hand, and can't put on her things herself. nd just ask, won't you, whether any breakfast was saved r her?" Mr. Ogilby's face flushed.  &#xD;<pb n="304-305" xml:id="VAC7016-00000152"/> 304       WALTER OGILBY. "And this is the way they treat her!" said he to him- self; and he was glad that his position on the seat with the coachman prevented the necessity of keeping up a conversation during the drive to the villagee.. Although Mrs. Ellsworth had excused herself from going to hear one of Dominie Hasbrook!s dull sermons, she was willing to listen while Ally read to her awhile; yet, upon the whole, she preferred talking to any other kind of Sun- day employment. She related to her niece many incidents of her family history, and at length adverted to the one great calamity of her life the loss of her two sons, next older than Cornelius, who had been drowned in the Hud- son many years before. As Ally had heard the general features of that history, she could not bear that her aunt should distress herself by going minutely over the harrowing scene, but the poor lady was bent on doing so. "Oh, yes, let me tell you just how it was I It does my heart good to open my troubles to somebody; and you know I've nobody ever to listen to me.

When they was a startin' my brother says to her, ' Don't you let the boys lean out of the state-room windows now, and fish in the water,' and she says, 'Oh, there's no danger,' says she, ' for the captain had some iron bars put across the windows last week just on ac- count of our children ;' so, as she was a careful, nice woman, my poor brother felt perfectly safe and easy. "It was wery pleasant after they set sail, but there wasn't much wind, and it was some time before they got up to the Highlands. It was early in the afternoon when they come opposite Crow's Nest, and it had fell so near calm that the captain had put on considerable sail to catch what wind there was, so as to get home, if he could, that night. It was wery hot and sultry, though it was in Sep- t tember, and the captain had just said he should not won- der if they should have thunder before night, when just then there came rushin' a squall of wind, down between Crow's Nest and Breakneck, just like a hurricane]1" "Before they had time to take in their' sails?" asked Ally, with a face of horror. "Oh, they sprung to do that as soon as ever they heard the first whistle of the wind, and they partly got them down. I suppose the sloop would have stood it, but only there was a heavy deck-load of plaster, and, bein' loose, it shifted, and carried the vessel right bows down." "Quite under the water, aunty?" asked Ally, faintly. "No, my dear," replied her aunt in a voice almost in- articulate with emotion. "At first she lay part in and part 26* I  *  .                      ,  -  &#xD;<pb n="306" xml:id="VAC7016-00000153"/> 306       WALTER OGILLBY. out of the water, and the people from the shore saw her, and got out their boats, and camle to her as quick as they could.

These tender ministrations drew her still closer to her aunt's affectionate heart. "My dear, how kind and good you are!" said she, as Ally stroked her forehead, and pil- lowed her head lovingly against her breast; "nobody is as good to me as you are. We do all love you so-Cornel'us and all Ally, I expect to have a great deal of comfort in you, always." Ally reciprocated these expressions of affection; but she could hardly forbear smiling when her aunt almost imme- diately after remarked,- "Well, I declare, what a nice comfortable time we are having, now that the others are all away at church 1" END OF VOL.

"I PROMSED the Van Antwerps 'we would all go there to tea this afternoon," said Gertrude to her mother, on her return from the morning service. "I heard you asking Mr. Ogilby to join us-what did he say?" inquired Anne Eliza, with lively interest. "He said I must excuse him." "I suppose he is too good to go out visiting on Sunday." "No, he was here last Sunday evening, and he often dines with the Van Nesses. " "Yes, Gitty," interposed her mother, " but that is only when it's to meet the clergyman." "It is a pity, then," said Gertrude, laughing, ". that I had not asked Dominie Hasbrook to join our party-then Mr. Ogilby could have made one with a clear conscience." Alice had no wish to accompany the young people to their cousins, and she was quite glad to believe there would be no room for her in the carriage. She wondered that Gertrude should have told Mr. Ogilby that they were all going, for she had never heard of such a plan until now. She stayed at home with her uncle, who positively de- clined accompanying the others; and while talking with him about her father, about Connecticut, and the old friends remaining, whom he had once known, she tried not to find the afternoon long, nor to suffer her mind to wander to subjects unconnected with the sacred duties of the day; but this was not always an easy task. "The fool's eyes are in the ends of the earth," says Solo- (307)  &#xD;<pb n="308-309" xml:id="VAC7016-00000155"/> 308       WALTER OGILBY. mon; so are, too often, the thoughts of the unwise children of men. Mr. Ogilby had- ridden up early the following morning to the post-office for his letters. As he was returning he I? stopped for a moment at Milbank. No one but Gertrude was visible; Alice, being unable to dress her hair herself,  was at that moment in the hands of Catlyna, who prided herself upon her skill in that department. "Is Miss Morton well this morning?" was almost his first inquiry. "Yes, quite well, but very much engaged," was Ger- i trude's smiling answer. "Too much so to receive a visit of a few minutes?" "I fear so-indeed, I know that it is so." He hesitated a moment, drew forth his pencil and pocket-book, which he opened at a blank leaf; then, as if suddenly changing his mind, returned both to his pocket, and, after few words of compliment for the other members of the family, left the piazza where he and Gertrude had been standing, mounted his horse, and proceeded on his return to Ferndale. A  couple of hours had elapsed, when Michael Byrne, Mr. Ogilby's young gardener, made his appearance with a parcel for Miss Morton. Gertrude received it, and carried it herself to Alice, who was sitting in the parlor. The latter saw at once thatiit was a book. As she took off i the envelope and turned it to look at the title, a note 1 dropped from between the leaves into her lap. She opened /  it with the natural embarrassment occasioned by a con- sciousness that the eyes of all the company were fixed upon Ai her. The note contained but these few lines,- "I take the liberty of sending you Rogers' Italy, which you told me you had not read -I am certain it will please you. I  called to see you this morning, but you were not J   "ALTER OGILB        309 visible. May I hope to be more fortunate this evening? I particularly wish to speak with you for a few minutes. I am aware that your wounded hand will prevent your writing in reply; if, therefore, you do not send me word by Michael that you are engaged, I shall do myself the pleasure to call. "WALTER OGILBY."    r Alice looked the note over slowly a second time, folded it, and walking forward to where the messenger was standing in the hall, said,- "There is no answer required, Michael." The man bowed and departed. "No answer required!" repeated Anne Eliza, rudely. "That is a funny return for shch a beautiful present I If you cannot send a word of thanks, Ally, you had better send back the book at once." Gertrude looked puzzled, and so did Mr. Halford, who had vainly tried for the last few minufes to keep his at- tention fixed on the book which he was reading. Ally walked quietly up-stairs. She found it hard to still the beating of her heart, and keep down the thick-coming fan- cies; and she did not return to the parlor till she felt sure she could do so with composure. She had supposed, from what Mr. Ogilby had said to his friend Teunis, that there was very little probability of his accepting Gertrude's invitation to come to Milbank this afternoon, and assist in choosing the persons to formc the party to West Point. Several of the cousins and friends were, however, expected, and among them the doctor and Aunt Lany. They were coming to a sociable tea; and the doctor, in a friendly call that he made at Ferndale on his re- turn from his professional rounds in the afternoon, happened to mention this little gathering with which the day was  &#xD;<pb n="310-311" xml:id="VAC7016-00000156"/> 310       WALTER OGILBY. to close. When he was about taking his leave, Walter accompanied him as far as the gate. "You are going to Milbank," said he; "I shall follow you after a time. I wish to engage you to do me a favor." "With all my heart-what is it?" "My visit there must, necessarily, be very short; but it is of the utmost consequence that I should speak with Miss Morton,- as the Germans say, 'under four eyes' Miss Ellsworth will do all in her power to defeat my design-- will you manage so to engross her attention that she shall not interfere with me?" "Yes, yes, certainly," said the doctor, greatly pleased that his young friend should meditate an errand to Mil- bank of which Alice was the chief object; " you may trust me. I am   not, as a general thing, very fond of talking with Gitty, but in such a cause I could even exert myself to be agreeable to her." When the doctor joined the company in Mrs. Ellsworth's drawing-room he drew Ally apart to a distant window, under pretence of hearing all the particulars of the hurt she had received; and they sat for some time conversing, during the pleasant sunset, and even into the twilight. At length Mr. Ogilby was announced; and having paid his compli- ments generally, he was not long in making his way to the place where the doctor and Ally were sitting. Gertrude was too good a tactician to follow him at once. The room was well filled with company, and there surely could be no danger in leaving Mr. Ogilby to his own de- vices for a little while. While she was meditating in what way she should accomplish her object of joining him, she found herself called upon to give her uncle the particulars of her visit to Aunty Rapa]je-to describe the exact state of the old lady's health, as well as that of all her family in general, and even her neighbors. Then she bad to answer t   IWALTER OGIILBY        3" so many questions, and listen to so many anecdotes, in all which Mr. Teunis and Miss Maria were somehow drawn il to take I part, that it was quite impossible to make her escape from the circle before the entrance of the servants with the tea-things compelled her to apply herself to the duties of hospitality, and effectually chained her for an- other half hour. Mrs Ogilby could not be mistaken in the flush that pastsed over the countenance of his fair companion, as he took the seat left vacant by the doctor. After an inquiry about her wounded hand, and a hope that she had not a second time been deprived of her rest, he said,-- "I particularly regretted not seeing you this morning. Now my time is so short that you will excuse me if what I say seems hurried. My business here this evening is a most painful one--I have come to say good-by to you for a time." He spoke in a low tone and with evident feeling. Alice turned pale. She could hardly utter the words as she slowly repeated--"To say -good-by? And shall you be absent long?" "I1 trust not--I go, as you may be certain, with the greatest reluctance. Nothing but an imperative duty should take me away at this time. , I hope to return in a week--perhaps in less. You shall hear how I am situ- ated, and then you will tell me whether I could do other- wise than decide to go." Alice did not fail to observe that he was appealing to her almost for permission to do .what his own judgment dictated to be right. "If it were an affair of my own," he continued, "I should feel at liberty to defer mny departure for a few days; but as it is, I think when you hear my story you will agree with me that I have no choice.

He had inherited a handsome property, with which he entered into the mer- cantile business in New York, which continued very pros- perous until the time of his death, about two years ago. He left one child, my namesake and godson, and he ap- pointed me, by will, the guardian of his child, as well as joint-executor of his estate. I waas with him at the time of his death, and he most earnestly commended his wife and child to my especial, and what he knew would be myt brotherly, care. In settling his worldly affairs, it was his judgment that the capital embarked in the business in the city should continue there, for at least some years to come. He had perfect confidence in the integrity and discretion of the gentleman who had been his partner. Poor Ruther- ford I He had hoped that his boy would have been brought up in this country; but the widow naturally preferred to return to her own fanmily, which she did soon after his death. Things have gone on well in the mercantile con- cern, until of late there has seemed a disposition to extend matters too much, as well as to enter into some speculations which have alarmed the other executor, Mr. Buchanan, Mrs. Rutherford's father, a shrewd, cautious Scotsman. He has come with his daughter to this country, and has written to me, requesting that I would meet himl in New York, and aid him in looking into matters in order to de- termine if there is any danger of prejudice to the boy's in- terests. I received the letter this morning, and as it is written in the most pressing terms, I feel that I cannot do otherwise than set off immediately-this very night, in fact. By commencing business at once. and using all pos- sible diligence, I shall doubtless accomplish all that is necessary, and be back here by Saturday, or Monday even- ing, at farthest. Am I wrong in acting thus promptly?"   WALTER OGILBY.         313 "No, certainly; you would never forgive yourself if you neglected your duty to the widow and the orphan. Your mother and sisters" (with a sigh) "will be very lonely without you 1" "They will bear it better than I shall," said he, in a tone still lower than he had hitherto used. After a mo- ment's pause hbe went on, "You will have much to amuse you, while I am away. There are parties and excursions planned, I am told, for every day of the coming week. May I venture to make one request?"Again he was silent for a moment. He wished to put what he had, to say in such a form that Alice could answer it without embarrassment-yet he wished it to be such as could leave her in no doubt as to his meaning. "You will doubtless," said he, "before my return, make your proposed visit to the top of the North Beacon. When you are there," he said it in a little playful tone, "if sonme one points out to you a faint blue line of hills, far in the east, and tells you that there is Connecticut, there is your home,-will you try to feel as if that spot did not contain all there is in this wide world to love or care for?" He saw that her hand trembled as she smoothed again and agoain the little kid covering in which her wounded finger was wrapped. "I could never again," she began-then hesitated, but,; suddenly, as if summoning courage, she said in a low tone, "I do promise." She had promised not to think that her own home con- tained all there was "to love and value." The words were not much-the manner was a great deal. He felt that it was all he could ask-he was satisfied. Alice ventured one more remark. "The weather must 27  &#xD;<pb n="314-315" xml:id="VAC7016-00000158"/> !

"As drinking cold water is not an epidemic," said Mr. Ogilby, with a smile, "we will hope that prudent visitors may escape unharmed; and in return for your hint, let me caution you against the night air and open windows, even though the moonlight be very enticing. I find I must now tear nmyself away, for I have to cross the river to meet the steamer before ten o'clock. My mother and Agnes will come to see you often. If you wish for books -if there is anything they can do for your comfort or happiness, will you call on them without hesitation?" Alice promised that she would. "And now-God bless you, until we tweet again." It was all said in an undertone, and Alice endeavored to reply calmly and quietly. She flattered herself she had done so in a manner to escape observation, and she busied herself in turning over the leaves of a book, apparently absorbed in examining, by the fading light, the plates it contained, until Mr. Ogilby had made all the excuses he thought necessary to Miss Ellsworth and the rest of the company. "But you are not running away surely!" cried Gertrude. "I thought you and Mr. Van Benthuysen had a special business to attend to this evening.7 "I must leave my share of it in my friend's hands," said he, " if indeed I have a right to any voice in the mat- ter. Whatever'the others decide upon, will of course meet my hearty concutrience." There was a general expression of regret when Mr. Ogilby's intended absence of a week was made known. "Why, my dear fellow!" said Mr. Teunis, " we cannot do without you at all. I shall vote for all sorts of amuse-   WALTER OGILB I.         15 ment being postponed until after your return; for every sinDle man in such a charmingly-numerous circle of the fair sex is a great item, I assure you, and one that can by no means be dispensed with." "-We nay as well postpone our visit to West Point in- definitely, then," said Anne Eliza; " for if Mr. Ogilby once gets to New York, where there are so many nice pleasant things to enjoy, he won't come back here in a hurry, I'll engage.-" Gertrude was not backward in expressing her very great regret, although in fact she rejoiced at the happy-, chance which removed him from her cousin's society just at this juncture. There were some things she could not quite understand: l I the affair of the note in the morningc-the apparently tran- Z quil conversation of this evening. He did not look like a despairing lover-neither did he look like a particularly cheerful one. She felt sure that she should learn nothing from Alice--no matter; Mr. Ogilby would now be absent until their visit to West. Point. ' That was a great point I' gained!  CHAPTER XXXVII. i  THE June rains which, as had been predicted, set in im- 1 mediately after Mr. Ogilby's departure, would, without Mr. Teunis' determination to that effect, have caused all  thoughts of excursions or parties in the open air to be given up for the present. The young people were confined to the house, and compelled to seek amusement or employ- m ent within doors as best they might. Mr. Halford could sit in the window and sketch to his P   &#xD;<pb n="316-317" xml:id="VAC7016-00000159"/> 316       "WALTER OGILBY. satisfaction the mountain in a storm, or the mountain in a mist-or a group of bare-legged children playing in a pud- dle, or a well-soaked work-woman making her way down the Factory-lane underi the dubious shelter of a broken um- brella-or a patient knot of dripping cows, or a cock crow- ing from the ground to indicate that the weather had not the slightest intention of clearing up at present. But to the fashionable young city ladies it was a difficult task to get through the day. Music, in which they were tolerable proficients, filled up a part of the time--backgammon, battle- dore and shuttlecock, piquet or cassing helped along the weary remainder. Alice, who, owing to her lame finger, could neither play, draw, nor use her needle, volunteered her services as reader to the company. Reading and recitation were accomplish- ments much insisted on in "l Mrs. Forbes' Seminary for Young Ladies," so that the natural taste and feeling with which Alice gave expression to the sentiments or descrip- tions of the best authors, had received every improvement from judicious cultivation. To one of the party, her obliging offer furnished a pecu- liar gratification. Mr. Halford, as he sat at his drawing, listened with delight to her pleasant voice, and was always sorry when a challenge to a contest at chess with Gertrude, or some lighter game with one of his cousins, caused the book to be laid aside. The limited library at Milbank had been nearly exhausted, when a new work was sent up from Ferndale to Alice--"a book just received from New York," as the note from Agnes informed her--"Redgaunt- let." "Brother was very well and desired his compliments to the ladies at Milbank."' Even Anne Eliza could now sit and listen. She was in :s    love alternately with Alan and Darcie, with Wandering , Willie and Joshua Geddes. !.    WALTER OGILBY.         31' "I don't know how it is, Ally," said she, " but when you, are reading I take such an interest in the story I I think I hear the very people talk, and see exactly the places that you are reading about'!" ' But even while listening, she found employment in watch- ing her Cousin Pinckney, to discover if possible the precise nature and degree of his sentiments towards Alice. She would occasionally solace herself by repeating to the latter the result of her observations. "Ally, how can you be so cold towards Cousin Pinckney, when he admires you so much? Do you know, he says your hand and arm are a I model for a painter." I   "Perhaps he would like to have me cut them off and (i give them to him for a study," said Ally, laughing. "I think he would prefer that you should give him the I whole without dividing. - Ally, do you know, the only time I I can ever getshimn to listen to me with patience is when I I talk about you?" Mr. Halford did certainly look at Alice frequently, and $  with a great deal of interest. He had once apologized for i the earnestness of his gaze, telling her that he had discovered in her face and form a striking resemblance to a picture of t  Perdita which he had seen at an exhibition, and had longed to copy, but which had been purchased and removed from the collection before he had an opportunity of doing so. He seemed now to be endeavoring to imprint on his I memory, and treasuring up for future use, all that would enable him to reproduce both contour and expression.    Mr. Halford had not been twice in company with Mr. Ogilby and Alice before he had divined the sentiments of the former, and by dint of a good deal of quiet scrutiny, particularly on the evening of his departure for the city, he l arrived at the conclusion that Alice was not indifferent to Mr. Ogilby. But one thing puzzled him. He could not i   :'       21*  &#xD;<pb n="318-319" xml:id="VAC7016-00000160"/> j : to;    318       IWALTER OGILB Y j understand why the devotion of that gentleman's manner should be exchanged for mere polite attention when he noticed that Miss Ellsworth's regards were upon him. Mr. Halford speculated a good deal upon the subject, and at length came to the conclusion that Mr. Ogilby imust have been a former lover of the young ]ady, or at least have paid her a sort of attention which ,he had now discontinued, but to which she thought herself still entitled. Has Mr. Ogilby then been fickle, or dishonorable? He could not tell-it was no business of his. Enough for him, that he was now paying his addresses to Miss Morton, and, as far as he could judge, with great probability of success. Armed with this conviction, Mr. Halford believed him- self in no danger from listening to Alice while she read, or from discussing with her subjects of literature and art,- asking hetlopinion and criticism of sketches he had made, or appealing to her taste in finishing them up. In short, finding in her a congenial companion, and repeating to himself frequently that she was out of his reach, he indulged himself in doing all in his power to make her time pass pleasantly, during the many successive days of unpropi- tious weather. Agnes had called twice during the slight intermissions between the showers; but Jessie being indisposed with a heavy cold and in danger of a confirmed rheumatic fever, Mrs. Ogilby was not able once, during the whole week, to leave her. Alice would have been glad to have gone to Ferndale to see the little invalid, but no one offered to con- vey her, and she had not courage to propose it herself. Once, when the sun seemed about to break through the clouds, she ventured to say, in her aunt's hearing, "I wonder how little Jessie is to-day!"And the reply had been, "To be sure-yes-so do I. When Cornel'us comes back, I'll ask him if he has heard."   WALTER OGILBY.        319 Saturday came. Mr. Ogilby might be expected this day. Alice was ashamed of herself for being so nervous, for starting at every sound of the opening front gate. She wished Mr. Halford would take himself into the drawing- room, or into the hall. Hle was very kind, very polite-- that could not be denied; but if he were only a thousand miles away, just at this moment, that she might sit at the front window and watch! It would be of no use to go up-stairs, for her own room was at the back of the house and commanded no viqw of the road! It grew dark, and then it came bedtime, and no Mr. Ogilby; and Alice had only to betake herself to her room to wonder if anything very dreadful had happened to de- tain him. Agnes was the only one of the Ferndale family at church the following day. Jessie was still not well enough for her mother to leave her. Mrs. Ogilby had, however, written a little note to Alice to beg that she would return with Agnes from church, adding that Jessie, who was suffering great pain, was urgent that dear'Miss Morton should be sent for. It seemed a case in which there could not be a Imoment's hesitation, and Alice was on the point of giving a ready as- sent, when Gertrude, who had listened to ,the persuasions which Agnes was adding to those of her mother's note, remarked in a quiet, decided tone,-- "I suppose  what would have been wrong last Sunday, E  can hardly be right to-day. Ally is principled against Sunday visiting." "I do not remember having expressed any opinion last Sunday," said Alice. "But I hardly think this comes within the description of Sunday visiting: an errand of mercy, it seems quite a different case." And again she looked at her note. i  . i}'  &#xD;<pb n="320-321" xml:id="VAC7016-00000161"/> 320       TVALTER OGILB II "Yes, altogether a different case," said her cousin, in a tone so sarcastic that Allv's color mounted to her temples. She saw that Mr. Halford was hearing the whole conver- sation, and she doubted not that he would understand the  interpretation put by Gertrude upon her wish to accept J the invitation. The matter was, however, decided by Mrs. Van Ness coming forward at that minute. "Oh I you are going to see poor little Jessie," she said. "That is right-she engaged Mr. Ludlow and myself both to use our good offices with you to persuade you. Me stopped there on our way to church, and found her really quite ill." There was nothing more to be said; and, to Gertrude's chagrin, Alice rode away with her friend, glad to exchange the flippant worldliness of her uncle's home for the quiet, rational, religious enjoyment of one so different. The remainder of the day was all that she had antici- pated. There were gentle, soothing ministrations to the little invalid--there were books 'and conversation, such as to remind her of her father and her own beloved home- there were selections from the daily letters of the absent one, the comments on which gave a lively picture of what he was to his family-an object not only of the tenderest affection, but of the most profound respect. Even his mother seemed to look up to him. Mr. Ogilby's letters spoke of, the favorable progress of the business which he had in charge, and of his confidence of a successful termination. The more recent ones con- tained the assurance that he should, unless some untoward accident occurred, be at home for the proposed party to West Point if not on Saturday, at all events on Monday, in time to drive up to Milbank and know all that was going on.   WALTER OGILBY.         321 !CHAPTER    XXXVIII. MONDAY was a very important day at. Milbank. Mr. Teunis was there at an early hour. He had a world of business on his shoulders. He had drawn out al I his plans, which he now brought for Gertrude's approval. The rain of the preceding week had been a great hin- drance, and he .had but this one day in which to accom- plish all the little matters that remained. "Let me see," he said, "the first thing is, to determine how many the boat will comfortably hold-though, as the company have all been invited, there must be space found for them somehow, I suppose. There will be room for twenty-let me look over our list. There are first, your family--your father and mother-- " "No, my father says he cannot waste time in going with us, but he will drive the carriage down to Cold- spring, and come across to the Point to meet us, in the afternoon." Mr. Teunis gave a sigh.' The care of Aunt Aulchy then, would, in all probability, devolve upon him. "Could you not persuade Dr. and Mrs. Hardenberg to be of the party?" he said. "Oh, no! They are expecting their daughter, Mrs. Adriance, with her children, from the city, and nothing would induce them to be absent at the time of their arrival. Besides, since Anthony has given up so entirely attending to his profession, the poor doctor has more on his hands than he can well attend to. We have scarcely seen him for the last ten days. His going is quite out of the ques- tion.'"  &#xD;<pb n="322-323" xml:id="VAC7016-00000162"/> 1 ;i     322       WALTER OGILBY. "t Well, then, there are your mother and your four young ladies, with Mr. Halford and Cornelius for your particular escort, when I am otherwise occupied. It is always my maxim when we visit the Point, to take as few gentlemen in proportion to the ladies as possible, that we may give the poor young fellows there a chance. Very well, 'vou are seven,' as the poet pleasantly remarks. Then-there are three of the Vandervooirts, and Anthony. It is to be hoped that John Peter, with several of his friends, will be ready at the dock to receive us, and walk up that long, tiresome hill with the young ladies." "Yes, but you needn't count on John Peter for one of the Wanderwoorts," observed that yo'uno gentleman's mother, who, while fidgeting about the room, picking up Mr. Hal- ford's papers after him, and laying the music straight upon the piano, caught now and then a word of the conver- sation. "No, indeed," said Mr. Teunis, brightening; "he is too good a son for that." "Oh I for the matter of that, I'm not goin' to stand in his way, nor anybody else's. He may please himself, and I can manage for myself. If I can only get somebody to give me their arm up the hill, and just hold my umbrella over my head, and carry my little basket of medicines for me, it's all that I shall ask." Mr. Teunis hastened on with his programme. "We had eleven, I think. I wonder if the Van Nesses will go!"                  ! "We agreed not to ask them --you know it is merely a sort of family affair, in compliment to John ,Peter." "Thank you, thank you, my dear Miss Gertrude,-once for myself, and once for my friend Ogilby. I shall let him know that he is set down as one of the family. Very good, upon my word;" and Mr. Teunis laughed until *%   WALTER OGILBY.         323 Gertrude became thoroughly vexed, the more so, as she could not determine whether he was placing Mr. Ogilby to her account or to that of her cousin. "Perhaps we had better finish going over our list," said she, with dignity. Thus recalled, Mr. Teunis went on,-"It is well I said nothing to the Van Nesses. I came very near it the I other day, when I ran out between the showers to talk over the matter with some of mly friends. Well, then-- there are the two Van Antwerps, and they make thirteen, and my sister and myself fifteen, and Garret-we did not count him before--sixteen. Now who else? Oh! to be sure-Walter and his sister Agnes will go I suppose; since her brother will be there to take care of her, her mother will doubtless consent. There--we have our eighteen-near enough to the prescribed number. I would beg leave to remark that my sister Maria has enough good things prepared to furnish an entertainment to the whole corps of cadets after we arrive; and what we are to do with all that will come pouring in from other quarters is more than I can tell. As we set out after breakfast, and arrive at our place of destination before dinner, it strikes me that two or three repasts on the way will be as many as we can dispose of." "You forget," said Ally, " the danger of shipwreck on a desert island." "Thank you, Miss Morton, for remembering that. But i consider how much more romantic, in case of such an acci-  : dent, to be reduced to the verge of starvation-hunting   about in the crevices of the rocks for a little moss, or bring- ing water in my new beaver hat, or picking out the softest stones as a couch for your poor aunt to lie down upon? ' How she would enjoy something of that kind I Well!- Anything more, Miss Gertrude?

I shall drive up again before evening, to learn if you have, anything fur- ther to suggest." And away posted Mr. Tennis, to see, as he said, that Ben Hyer had his boat well provided with seats and everything in complete order.  When he had got as far as the hall, however, he re- turned. "It is understood, I suppose," said he, "that we do not take the boat again at night." "Certainly. We are to have our carriages waiting for us on the other side of the river, at Coldspring; and papa has written to his friend, Captain Carter, requesting him to borrow the commanding officer's barge to bring us across at whatever hour we mav choose." "Then I can offer seats to two of you in my carriage, as you seem to muster pretty strong," said Mr. Teunis; "and Ogilby can accommodate a couple more if it is neces- sary. The other families will all be provided, and that completes the arrangement." Once more he made his bows, and was off. The young ladies, not sorry to be re- lieved of his presence, addressed themselves to the im-f portant business of their personal preparation for the ensuing day. "Ally, what are you going to wear?" was Gertrude's first question. "It do not know--something dark, I suppose.  My checked blue and white silk-would not that be suitable?" Ally looked well in her blue and white silk. "That old dress, to a party at West Point 1" "Oh, no, it, is not an old dress. It was new last suim- rmer, and I have kept it very carefully. Shall I wear my purple muslin, then? You know I have no great variety to choose from." "If we were going up the mountain after whortleber-   WALTER OGILBY.         325 ries, I should think the purple muslin exactly the thing. But I must own I should feel mortified to see you appear in it on such an occasion as our visit to-morrow." "I thought if we were going in a boat, where we might be splashed by the oars, or rub ourselves against the ropes, it would be best to wear something that could not be injured. But tell me what is proper, what is expected," said Ally, laughing; " like Hubert the archer, 'I can but do my best.' 9 "You have a nice worked canbric -wear that." "But how will that agree with my brown muslin bon- net?" "Your brown muslin bonnet! You surely do not think of wearing that fright?" "But consider, my chip hat is so delicate that exposure to the sun for several hours, and afterwards to the dew in the evening, will be sure to destroy its beauty." "Just'as you please; though if you are,so philosophical as to be willing to appear in your brown bonnet before all the gay strangers you may m eet at West Point, you could surely bear to wear it here in the country, in case your other should be spoiled.", Alice was condemned, in spite of herself, to the dress that was most becoming and most likely to heighten the impression that her innocent beauty and sweet, Inaffected manners could not fail to produce. The other two visitors were, in their turn, puzzled to decide amid the multiplicity and variety of their flounced, puffed, embroidered, and bright-colored toilettes. Their aunt, who assisted at the discussion, would have been glad if they could have worn them all; and she was eager in making such suggestions as would enable them to dispose of the greatest possible number and variety of ribbons and ornaments, when the voice of her husband was heard calling fronm the hall below. e28  &#xD;<pb n="326-327" xml:id="VAC7016-00000164"/> 326       WALTER OGILB . "Mother, where are you? What are you doing? I want to speak to you. Do you know that Armstrong's wife and children are very sick with the measles?" "Oh, yes; brother Theodore told mhe so yesterday." "Have you been down there, or sent to see what can be done for them?1" "Why, no, George--how could I possibly go this dreadful hot day? And as for sendin' Dinah or Silvv, why, you know we are all just as busy as bees a gettin' ready for to morrow. There's cake and cocoa-nut pud- din's and sandwiches, and I don't know what all, to be seen to." "Pshaw!" cried her husband, impatiently; " one would think you were fitting up an expedition to the South Seas. What you can want of such a quantity of eatables is more than I can tell; but this I do know, that Armstrong has had to be away from his loom these three days, nursing his family. He thinks, I suppose, that his wife needs to be taken better care of than other workmen's wives. I cannot, for my part, see why. It is a great inconvenience -in fact. a great loss--to have him absent just at present; the very best hand that we have, and engaged on the pre- mium piece for the Exhibition. And here's the Fourth of July coming too, when they will all be expecting a holiday. If you could just walk over there and see how they are doing, and tell Armstrong that his wife is getting along very well, he will believe it; and some of the neighbors can go in and sit with her by turns and release him." "Why, George, you must be crazy to think of my walkin' there in this hot sun!+ I should be laid up, and not fit to go to the Point to-morrow." "Can't Gitty, then, go over and see what is the matter? I really cannot spare Armstrong in this way; though it would not look well for mne to go and tell him, so."   WALTER OGILBY.         327 Gitty heard the inquiry, but did not think proper to notice it. "Why, what would Gitty know about the matter?" said her mother, taking her cue from her daughter's silence; "she never was used to sickness, and don't know anything about it, no more than a baby." Mr. Ellsworth muttered something that was, perhaps, as well not spoken aloud. "But, aunty, I am used to sickness," said Ally. "I have nursed a great many sick people. In papa's parish, you know, there was always somebody to be taken care of. If you like, I will walk down to Mrs. Armstrong's in your stead, and see what I can do. I know the place, I think." "That is right, my daughter," cried her uncle. "I am glad to find there is one young person in the world brought up to think of her fellow-creatures before she does of her- self." Uncle George said this with the most disinterested air iniaginable. "But, my dear, are you sure you have had the mea- sles?" inquired her aunt, anxiously. "Oh, yes, aunty, I well remember catching them on purpose when I was a little girl by creeping into bed with my friend Kate Andrews, who hbd them-. I fancied it would be such a pleasant, thing to lie in bed all day and drink lemonade, as she did." "Wery well, my dear,--then, if you want to go, I dare say you would do just as well as me or Gitty. And you had better take two or three lemons with you, if Dinah has got any to spare from the puddin's, because it is, as you say-lemonade is wery good for the measles. 'But, pray, don't get sick, my dear, for we might just as well not go to West Point at all as go without you, vou know." "I wish you a good time, Ally, among those dirty Scotch people," said Gertrude, as her cousin passed her, equipped  &#xD;<pb n="328-329" xml:id="VAC7016-00000165"/> 9* 328      I ZWALTER' OGILBY. ', I  for her walk. "I cannot say, for my part, that Scotch dirt P(with emphasis) "has any greater attraction for me than dirt and disorder of any other kind." Alice took no notice of her cousin's unlady-like remark, but descended to the hall, where her uncle was seated at a table folding a letter. "I am just sending off a line to John Peter," he said, "to notify him that you will all be there to-morrow to dine and take tea." "Wait one moment, if you please, uncle," said Alice. She took the pen, and, turning down the edge of the letter, hastily wrote two or three words; then refolded and sealed it before she returned it to her uncle. "Now," said he, with a smile, "I suppose it is all right;" while Alice, observing Mr. Halford standing on the piazza, hat in hand, apparently ready to offer himself as her escort, slipped quietly out the back way; and, having made a descent upon Dinah and filled her little basket with delicacies for the sick family, she took her course down the banks of the creek towards the dwelling of Armstrong, the weaver. CHAPTER XXXIX. THE small cottage was prettily situated near the edge of the stream, nestled close under the shadow of a high bank which ran out, in a bold promontory, quite into the water. Though overhung with the foliage of the trees, which grew low and wide-spreading from a sort of natural, craggy terrace above, yet. its front was unsheltered; and through the open door Ally could perceive, as she ap- proached, that Gertrude's strictures were not altogether   WALTER OGT  LBTG .      329 unmerited. There was indeed enough of untidiness and disorder to awaken the commiseration of one with whom cleanliness and comfort were identical. A plain-looking lan, with a freckled face and sandy hair, was sitting on a stool near the door, holding on his lap an apparently con- valescing infant. There were at least two more invalids in the family group-the mother, who, huddled under heaps of covering, occupied the bed, and a youngster on a rough trundle-bed by her side. Ally mentioned her name and errand, and the man at once arose with a bright, cheerful look of welcome. "Take a seat, Miss," he said, bringing, with his disen- gaged hand, a chair near to the open door. "It's very warm to-day, and it's certainly very kind of you to come at such a time to see us. Kitty, Kitty dear," said he, ten- derly, as he approached the bed, "here's a young lady come to call on you. Will ye speak to her?" A voice in a complaining, but very gentle tone was heard in reply. "Oh, Jamie dear! I m too sick to speak to anybody." "Cannot I do something for you?" said Alice, drawing near. "Shall I bathe your forehead and shake up your pillows a little?" The sick woman pushed up, with a fine, delicate hand- the soiled handkerchief with which her head was wrapped, and which in her restlessness had fallen partly over her forehead. She looked up at her visitor with eyes of dark gray, so large and soft, and fringed with such thick lashes, that, together with4 the finely-cut features; they formed a countenance strangely out of place among the unwashed pillows and coverlets with which it was sur- rounded. "A little fresh air would perhaps be of service to you," 28*  &#xD;<pb n="330-331" xml:id="VAC7016-00000166"/> 330       WALTER OGILIB Y. said Alice, admonished by every movement of the neces- sity of ventilation. i!      She brushed away the thick curtains of dust and cob- webs which hung around a casement at the head of the invalid's bed, and made an ineffectual attempt to open it. "Don't give yourself that trouble," said the gentle voice again. "Jamlie dear, come and help the lady." Jamie bestowed the baby carefully in a narrow box that served the purpose of a cradle, and then came forward as he was bid. i,.     "Is there no danger of her taking cold?" he asked, anxiously. Ally assured him there was not. Then having, after some search under the sick woman's direction, found a fresh pillow-case and night-cap, bathed the pretty face and combed out the neglected hair, and shaken and smoothed the bedclothes, she proceeded to prepare a glass of lemon- ade not only for the mother, but also for the staring, won- dering urchin who was lying in perfect quietness by her side. "Why, Kitty dear, you begin to look like yourself again," said her husband, gazing at her with an'air of the most tender satisfaction. "But she can't look quite right yet, Miss, either; the measles, you see, has spoiled her complexion, just for a time. She is getting better, thoug'h; : you are getting better, Kitty dear, aren't you?" "Yes, I believe so, Jamie," said the poor woman, with i:     a sigh that was almost a groan. "And you'll feel all the better for this nice visit of the young lady, won't you?'" "Oh, yes I she's very kind. I'm much obliged to her." "Shall I read to you again, then? Shall I go on with the story?" "No, I had rather hear you and the young lady talk." ,1 :?   WfALTER OGILBY".        331 "It must be a great comfort, if you are fond of books, that your husband is disposed to read to you," said Alice. "To be sure she's fond of books," said the husband, a little proudly. "She was always used to them when she was young. Kitty is of gentle blood. She little thought once to have ever seen herself as you now see her, Miss." Alice knew how much was expressed by that term " of gentle blood,", and her look indicated her astonishment and sympathy. "Jamie, Jamie, nman," called his wife from the bed, "come here and help me to get up.  Let me tell the story myself. I am better, far better than I was. Let Me tell it." Alice went forward to offer her services. "No, no, thank you," said Mrs. Armstrong.' "Let Jamie alone, he knows rbhat to do. Jamie dear, bring your plaid and wrap it round me, and then carry me and set me in the arm-chair near the door." Jamiie did as he was desired. Alice walked away that she might be spared the wit- ness of a scene, the unreserve of which was as little ac- cordant with the usages of gentle blood as could well be imagined. The invalid was at length installed in the arm- I chair, while her husband seated himself on a stool at her feet, and, with his hands clasped around his knees, sat looking earnestly into the face of their visitor, to observe what impression the narrative his wife was about to give should produce upon her. It was a strange story, and Alice wondered as she listened. "My father," began Mrs. Armstrong, "was a Scottish baronet. He was of an old family, with a large landed estate, but otherwise not very wealthy. He was twice married. His first wife was a woman of fortune, but the  &#xD;<pb n="332-333" xml:id="VAC7016-00000167"/> 332       W'AL TER OGIL B . second, who was my mother, had, as I have been told, nothing but her beauty for her portion. Both my parents died while I was quite young, and I was left to the care of my half-brother, Sir Archibald ---; you may have  heard his name mentioned, for he is much distinguished in public life. He and his twin sister were the only chil- dren of my father's first marriage, as I was, of his second; and there was, perhaps, never a brother more attached to a sister than he was to his,-in fact, she ruled him com- pletely. 1 do not know whether this had anything to do with the unfortunate circumstances of my brother's mar- ried life, for I was a child and away at school at the time, but this I have been told, that having married a beautiful and high-born lady, she deserted him after a few years. They were either divorced, or agreed to separate, I never knew exactly which, but she died shortly after. My sister had been up to London for several successive winters be- fore she was married. She was a very, showy, proud woman. She lived with my brother, who kept a grand establishment, and together they enjoyed a large share of all that this world has to give. It surprised everybody then, as you may suppose, when, in a sudden fit of devo- tion, she gave her hand to a clergyman of the Church of England. To be sure, he was a Dean,'and the son of an Earl, and it was expected he would be a Bishop some day; so that there was no disparity in their stations in life. But every one who knew my sister's love for the pomps and vanities of the world, wondered how she would content herself with the quiet ways and modest tastes of her hus- band, who was a truly pious, humble Christian. In the end it proved that she could not content herself with them. Her serious fit passed away, and then she longed to return to the same style and show, the same gtyeties and amuse- ments that she had been accustomed to in her brother's   WA4 LTER OGILBY.       333 house. So she quarreled with her husband--refused to live with hiln-her brother took her part, and finally brought her back to his home, and installed her there again as its mistress. "In the mean time I continued at 'the school where my brother had placed me in the town of A. I was there for several years, under the care of two kind, respectable old ladies, who taught me, or had me taught, everything that was considered in that part of the country to belong to a polite education. Oh! it was pleasant there and peaceful. The happiest days of my life were spent on the banks of the sweet Irvine Water." She paused, drew a heavy sigh, and then went on. "At eighteen years of age my education was pronounced finished, and my brother took me home. He was very kind to me, and very generous. I had always been told that I had no fortune, that my father had lived up to his income, and had died without making- any provision for me ; but my brother never let me feel it--he gave me everything that heart could wish. There was one thing, however, which healways required of me--that I should in all things be guided and governed by my sister, and this chafed my proud spirit. It was difficult for me to submit my will to that of another, for, having been greatly indulged by the old ladies, I was fond of my own way, and I felt myself now of an age to judge for myself on most occasions. My brother lived very hospitably, and entertained a great many strangers, particularly officers who might be quartered in our neighborhood and the gentlemen of' the Hunt,' as it is called, to which he belonged. One morning there had been at the Hall a grand breakfast for 'the Hunt,7 and a large company, chiefly of gentlemen, with my sister and myself, were to go afterwards to the field to see the hounds throw off. Among the visitors was a young officer of a good flmily  &#xD;<pb n="334-335" xml:id="VAC7016-00000168"/> 334       JWA L TER OGILB r. but poor, who had paid me some attention, and I had made an agreement to go with him on horseback to the ground. Truly, it was not because I cared for him, but rather that I wished to show off a new ridingc-habit with hat and feathers that my brother had had sent from Edinburgh to me. When my sister found what my intention was (for I had not con- sulted her in the -matter), she peremptorily forbade me, and told me I must come in the carriage with her, I rebelled, and as my temper became excited by opposition, I used language that certainly was not as respectful as it should have been. My brother came in in the midst of our alter- cation. Never had I seen him so angry before. He was as pale as death-for, as I have said, he worshipped his sister. He did not break out upon me, however. All that he said was ' Leave her to me, Maria; I will attend to this to- morrow.' Then, as the company were all waiting for him, he mounted and rode awav with them. At first I thought I would not go with my sister in the carriage, but some- thing in my brother's looks made me afraid of proceedintg too far. I went, but all day I was turning over in my mind what my brother had said, and wondering what he intended to do on the morrow. I was so frightened that I could hardly keep up a conversation with the young gen- tleman I have spoken of, who, not belonging to 'the Hunt,' kept his station near the carriage-windows, a thing that was evidently very displeasing to my sister. She did not speak to me, and I, for my part, was too proud to speak to her; so we returned home after awhile, feeling more uncomfort- ably toward each other than when we set out. "The next morning my brother came up to my room, and seeing my maid busy there, he said to her, without address- ing me, 'Pack up Miss Kitty's clothes--have everything ready within the hour.' "'Where are you going to take me?' said I, trembling   WALTER O GILB IY.       335 like a child, for I had read all sorts of foolish romances, and imagined angry brothers to be capable of everything terrible. "He made me no reply until I had followed him out of the apartment, then he turned and said, 'I am taking you back to school, and I shall keep you there until you are one-and-twenty, until you learn how to behave with proper respect to my sister, the head of my family.' I saw that it would be in vain to entreat or remonstrate. I gathered up my things in silence, and helped my maid to pack them. My only thought was revenge; it was burning within me like a fire; while I went about so calmly that my poor Jenny never suspected the nature of the journey for which we were preparing. "I made a curtsv to my sister as I passed her in the hall on my way to the carriage. I neither said ' farewell' to her nor asked her pardon. Nor was there one word ex- changed between my brother and myself the whole length of our journey. Had he spoken to me, expostulated with me on my conduct, represented to me not only the sin of a rebellious temper, but the grief it must occasion to a brother and sister who had acted the part of parents to me, he could have brought me to his feet in penitence and sorrow. As it was, his behavior hardened my spirit, and confirmed me in the determination I had formed, to visit upon them both trouble for all their offences. The mortification of returning under such humiliating circumstances to the young circle I had left in triumph but a few months before, did not help to allay the bitterness of my feelings. I was soothed, it is true, by the tenderness and affection with which the good ladies, my governesses, received me; but their lamentations over the unkind and unjust treatment I had received gave additional firmness to the purpose over which I was brooding. Having an object in view, however, I fet!gned cheerfulness, and affected to make light of the in- dignity I had suffered.  &#xD;<pb n="336-337" xml:id="VAC7016-00000169"/> 33fi       WALTER OGILBY. "My mind was now wholly occupied in devising some means of punishing my brother and sister. My first idea was to destroy myself. I would write a letter of farewell, upbraiding them with their tyranny, and proclaiming to the world that their pride and hard-heartedness had driven their innocent orphan sister to this desperate deed. "But besides the dread of death and the judgment, in which I had been carefully reared, I was deterred from this step by the reflection that the world would perhaps never be the wiser for this, my dying testimony ; the wealth and influence of my relatives being quite sufficient to sup- press any evidence of the share they had had in nly fate. It was pretty certain that I should be looked upon as an ill-tempered girl who had caused her family much trouble, and of whom they were well rid. "There was one way in which I could, I knew, effectu- ally wound the pride of my brother and sister-I could dis- grace my family; and this was what I resolved to do. I would not do it by misconduct however--that might be hushed up. I would do something that mnust be known; and I hastened to do it without delay, for, strange to say, I distrusted my own resolution. I was afraid of being tempted to relent. I was anxious to take, without loss of time, some step from which it would be impossible to recede. "Finally I decided upon myplan: I determined to throw myself away, by marrying in such a sphere as should cause my proud brother forever to repent the harshnesshe had used towards me. The world would, in this case, as I doubted not, cry out against him, as having by his unkind- ness driven me to seek in a humble home the tenderness which was denied me in the more, lofty estate to which I was by birth entitled. I would marry then--a menial, if possible; if not, the nearest approach to it which fortune should throw in my way." ?!   WIALTER OGILBY.        337 CHAPTER    XL. "THERE was one great difficulty in the prosecution of my plan--where to find the proper person. My governess kept only maid-servants. The writing-master or the dan- cing-master would either of them have been sufficiently my inferior, but they were middle aged, married men; there was not even an apothecary's boy who could be made available, for the old medical gentleman who at- tended to the occasional ailments of the pupils, was scru- pulously careful to bring his prescriptions himself. We were allowed no intercourse with the families of the little town, that being a point in my governess' system which she never departed from. I was almost in despair, when chance threw the wished-for opportunity iln mny way. "I went one afternoon with my governess to the milli- ner's, to buy a ribbon for my bonnet. While I was choos- ing it the door of the work-room beyond the shop opened, and I saw sitting there a young man whose appearance bespoke him of the same rank as his companions the work- women. Here was the very person I was seeking. If he only were unmarried! I instantly recollected that I. must go and speak to one of the journeywomen about some bits of silk for a chair-covering that I was piecing for my gov- \ erness. While thus away from under the eye of my guar- X dian, I laughed and talked more freely with the girls than was my wont, to show that I had no undue pride, and I looked several times at the young man with as pleasant ) and affable an air as I could assume. As I was about going away, I told the milliner she must come up to the ' 29              an9 '?  &#xD;<pb n="338-339" xml:id="VAC7016-00000170"/> 338       WALTER OGILBY. school at evening, to take mly directions about a dress she was to make for me, and I took/ my leave very graciously of all the company, the youngi iStranger included; after which I rejoined my governess in the front shop. "I received Mrs. McKay, the milliner, in my own roomn at evening; and hardly had she commenced with iber busi- ness of the dress when I interposed with inquiries about the young man I had seen, conimmending his appearance and deportment. She told me he was her youngest brother, a weaver of Paisley, come to visit her previous to setting off with a party of emigrants to America, and that they were to sail within the week. Nothing ,could have tallied better with my wishes. Spite of myself, my pride had revolted against the position I had resolved to take among my former associates. To go at once to a land unknown, would rob mly descent of half its sting. "I continued my inquiries about the young man, whether he were married, how he would bear a lonely life in a foreign country, and so forth-not forgetting to express my. conviction that happiness was most surely to be found in the humble walks of life; in proof of which I cited my own sad experience as well as that of my brother and sister. In short, I managed so well to let the milliner see the bent of my thoughts that she appointed the next after- noon for me to copme to her shop to try on my dress. On arriving there, I contrived to send away the steady old maid-servant, who had accompanied me, on an errand to the candy-shop; and I was not in the least surprised, on being ushered up-stairs into the little parlor of the milliner,- to find her brother already there. "We soon became acquainted, thanks to the determina- tion I had formed; for Jam ie,"-here Mrs. Armstrong reached forward her hand and laid it on her husband's head with an affectionate smile, which had yet something   WALTER OOILBY.        339 of sadness in it,-"Jamie would never have dreamed of lifting his eyes to me. However, he could not but see that I was resolved to please him; and indeed that was no difficult task. We did not part without appointing another meeting for the next afternoon, and then all things were settled between us. I promised to marry him, and to accompany him to America I had many articles of dress and ornaments of value, which I managed to send unsuspected to the milliner, that she might exchange them in a neighboring town for clothing more suitable to the sphere I was about to enter. "By the help of one of the maids whom I had bribed, I contrived to make lny escape by night to Jamie, who was waiting for me with a chaise, and we got to Greenock, and were married just before going on board the ship which was to take us away. "There, on board that emigrant ship, among a crowd of men, women, and children, all, like my husband, strangers to me, I had leisure to reflect on what I had done. I saw, in its full proportions and colors, the fate I had con- demned myself to-what I was to receive in exchange for what I had given up! I had punished my brother and sis- ter, it is true-but, ah! I found to my sorrow that I had punished myself a thousandfold more I "I bore up during the voyage, while exposed to the gaze of those around me, whom I must now consider my com- panions and equals; but I believe I should have sunk and died after my arrival, under the combined evils of sickness and despondency, had it not been for the kind and sensible counsels of another sister of my husband already settled in this country. We went to her at the first, and while she treated me with unbounded kindness, she endeavored to open my eyes to what was now my duty. She labored to impress upon me that, having made my own choice,  &#xD;<pb n="340-341" xml:id="VAC7016-00000171"/> 340       TVAL TER OGILBY } and drawn her brother into a connection that he would, of his own accord, never have presumed to seek, I was bound to accommodate myself to whatever circumstances I might be placed in, and cheerfully to strive for his happiness as he was constantly doin(g for mine. I felt that she was right; and I did my best to appear contented,-the more so, as I was persuaded that my brother, by means of some secret emissary, would be informing himself of my fate, and watching my deportment under it. My spirit was not so broken that I was willing my family should know how bitterly I repented the steps which I had taken. "My very pride forbade me to make an endeavor to rise above my condition; I resolved never for a moment to forget that I was a poor weaver's wife, and in the course of time I sunk, as you perceive, into the way's and habits belonging to that sphere." "And did you never hear again from your friends?" asked Ally, as Mrs. Armstrong paused in heri narration. "In the course of time I did," she replied. "At the birth of my second child, I was very ill; I expected to die, and I had many solemn thoughts about my past con- duct. I repented of my evil temper towards my family, and the wrong I had done them. I told Jamie to have my baby christened, and to give it the name of my brother, -Archibald.  He might not value the compliment, I' thought, even if he should ever hear of it, but it would be a proof that I died in charity with him. On my sick-bed, as I began to recover, I made many resolutions to strive in future to be a less unprofitable wife to my poor Jamie. I had been brought ulp in idleness and lux- ury, but I would set myself in earnest to be a helpmeet for him -I would endeavor to repay the kindness and tender'care which I had never, under whatever discourage- ments, failed to receive at his hands."   WALTER OGILBY.        341 "And indeed you did repay it, Kitty," said her hhus- band, looking up in her face with an air almost of rever- ence; " you have been a brave woman, and borne your lot well. You have been a kind wife to me, and a good mother to our children." "I have tried to do my best," replied the wife, with a sigh; " but it is hard to know what is exactly right. I must put no proud notions into my children's heads--I must bring them up to just what they are born to ;-but sometimes, when I think of my Nannie, a little servant at Mrs. Van Wyck's, and compare her lot with that of her young cousins, the companions of dukes and duchesses, it is a hard struggle to submit to. the evils I have brought upon myself and my children." Ally was startled at the plainness of the poor woman's speech. She felt for the possible wound to her husband's feelings-but no!--he continued to look approvingly and admiringly at his Kitty, only alive, as it seemed, to the great honor she had done him by the sacrifice she had made. "I think you said you had heard from. your family," ob- served Alice, to divert the current which the conversation was taking. "Yes, my little boy was but. a few months old when I received a twenty-pound note in an envelope, with the words, in my brother's handwriting, 'for Archibald Arm- strong, and ever since, from time to time, I have received the same sum in the slame way. We generally put it out at interest-never, except under the pressure of sickness or great distress, permitting ourselves to make use of it; though I doubt not it was designed we should act our pleasure in the matter. My husband has been far from prosperous in this country. We lived first near a cotton factory, and he was promised good wages; but after 29*  &#xD;<pb n="342-343" xml:id="VAC7016-00000172"/> '     34 2       WALTtE;R OGILBY. a time the proprietor failed, and he lost all. After that, by the advice of a friend who had come over from the old country with him, he took to the weaving of satinet. Jamie is a handy workrfian, and I dare say we should have done well but for sickness and a large family of little ones." "You have neighbors who are almost your own country- people," Alice ventured to say-"Mrs.- Ogilby's family." "Yes, Mrs. Ogilby is very kind in coning to see us, particularly when she hears that ally of us are ill. It is strange that neither she nor Mr. Walter have been to see why Archie and Bobby were not at school last week!" ]"Mr. Ogilby is in New York, and Mrs. Ogilby's youngest daughter is quite ill, so that Miss Ogilby was probably not at the school on Saturday. Do you not go to Ferndale sonmetimes?' The question was hazarded less as a matter of curiosity than for the pleasure of speaking of a place and of friends so dear. "To Ferndale? Oh, no! Mrs. Ogilby has invited me, ,i   and would receive ame very kindly, I have no doubt, if I were to go; but," said Mrs. Armstrong, looking around the bare and disorderly apartment with a sort of discon- solate smile, "we could not visit as equals, so I am con- tent that the visiting should be all on one side, as a matter of Christian charity. No--a call on Ochiltries' or McDou- gall's wife suits me better thaIn aiming to mingle with the gentry now." "Things will doubtless look brighter by-and-by," said Alice, consolingly. "Such wonderful changes occur often in this country 1" "May-be so.  Jamie is not made for great enterprises or fortunate changes. But we will put by little Archie's money and what we can save of our own, and some day   TWA LTER OGILBY.        343 we can buy a farm for him and the rest of the children," said she, wearily. "Come, now, Jamie dear, I'm tired. Help nme to bed again. We won't keep the young lady," seeing Alice, rise. "I hope you will come again--your visit has done me good. Please tell Mr. Ellsworth I'll keep little Archie at homne to-morrow, and let Jamie back to his loom." It was already considerably past. the dinner hour, and as there was really nothing to be done for the invalid, be- yond what her, husband could do far more acceptably than a stranger, Alice took her leave. She walked slowly along the highroad towards Milbank, nimusing on the strange story that she had heard. Was it possible that a high-born lady could, from a spirit of re- sentment at wrongs, be they what they might, thus have cast herself away? Must there not have been insanity to prompt the act? Could she, apparently so gentle, so delicate, by any possibility have been in her senses while planning and carryingl out such a scheme? A woman, without compulsion, without the'excuse of a mistaken idea of duty, to sacrifice herself! How horrible! How revolt- ing I And yet--was it actually more degrading than the sale of one's self from motives of ambition or cupidity, as is so often seen'! so carelessly talked about! I as the match made without love, at all more respectable because the party chosen was a silly or vicious gentleman, rather than a poor man like Armstrong, the weaver? With these thoughts were beginning to mingle now and then in Ally's mind a vain wish, that a few more clumps of trees had been suffered to remain by the wayside as a shelter from the scorching heat, when the sound of wheels made her turn her head. It was the gig of Mr. Teunis, and the owner was not alone-the first rapid glance told Alice who was his companion. Mr. Ogilby had sprung -       ^               #   &#xD;<pb n="344-345" xml:id="VAC7016-00000173"/> lii':  344       WALTER OGILBY.  out and joined her almost before theJlight-hearted bachelor had recognized her. " Miss Morton'! Is it possible ?" cried the latter. "What are you doing down here this hot afternoon ? Come, take a seat at once, and let me drive you to Milbank. Walter's long legs will carry him there by the time we arrive." Mr. Ogilby had drawn Alice's hand within his arm, and he now made a gesture to his friend. "Drive on, Teunis," said he, "and let them know that we are on our way. We will soon overtake you." " And leave you to monopolize the young lady ! Thank you all the same, Master Walter. You should have cried 'No halves nor quarters' when you first picked up the prize. Now I'm entitled to my share; and since Miss Morton will not take a seat with me, I shall just drive slowly along by her side, until we get to Milbank, and ac- cept such crumbs of notice as she may be pleased to bestow upon me " Being occupied at this moment in adjusting his reins, Mr. Teunis lost the grimace with which his friend rewarded him for this arrangement. "But how came you here so early ?" asked Alice.  "I thought you could not possibly arrive until evening." "Ah! there you ladies must thank me," cried Mr. Teunis.  "After I returned home this morning, I chanced to look over my city paper a second timne, and to my sur- prise I saw that a new arrangement had been made in re- gard to the river boats, a line leaving at five o'clock instead of eight, as before. So I posted directly over to Newburg, for I knew my gentleman would be there not later than twelve o'clock. I brought him straight to Ferndale, in- vited myself to dinner, and when he had beautified himself sufficiently, put him into my gig once more, and here we are."    WALTER C)ILBY,.        345 "And how did you find Jessie?" asked Alice. (' Better, much better. My mother says your visit yes- terday has nearly cured her." "We must get the doctor to put me on his list of pre- scriptions for the rheumatism," said she, laughing. '; I amn afraid in that case the complaint would soon be- come an epidemic," replied Mr. Ogilby. "I know that I, for one, should have a chronic attack of it," put in Mr. Teunis. "But here we are, and there are the young ladies-' the three Graces' I should say--waiting our arrival, wondering, no doubt, where we have picked each other up.,' In explaining the matter to the circle at Milbank, and detailing once more, what had been over and. over agreed upon by Mr. Teunis, and in answering all the numerous questions of the Miss Westbrooks to Mr. Ogilby, about the appearance of matters and things in the city, the time of the gentlemen's visit slipped away, and they took their leave with an earnest recommendation from Mr. Teunis, to all concerned, to report themselves without fail in the little porch in front of Ben Hyer's house, at an hour "not later than seven" on the following morning. Mr. Ogilby had not exchanged a word in private with Alice, but he had marked her beaming eye, her glowing cheek, her glad smile, he had held her hand and pressed it, and he was satisfied.  &#xD;<pb n="346-347" xml:id="VAC7016-00000174"/> lj  34        TF AL, TER 001 ,B L . CHAPTER     XL I. IT is an easier matter to appoint an early hour for the. assembling of a party, than to secure its punctual ob- servance. Mr. Teunis and his sister were upon the ground in due season-so too was Mr. Ogilby.  The latter came alone, for, although Jessie was decidedly convalescing, she was just in that nervous, complaining state, which made her wish to keep around her all who could contribute to hel comfort; Agnes felt therefore that she ought not leave her. Mr. Ogilby had risen at a very early hour. He felt cer- tain that this day his fate would be decided ; and although he had few doubts what that decision would be, yet many thoughts, solemn as well as joyful, mingled with his medi- tations. When he went to offer his mother his customary morning salutation, he could hardly refrain from bowing his head and asking her blessing on this, the most im- portant day of his life. But he knew he was in her heart, and that each thought of him was a  prayer for his happiness, and he said to him- self, "I will wait and tell her all, on my return, and we will rejoice together." The morning breeze freshened a little as the two gentle- men paced up and down the dock, waiting for the rest of the party to make their appearance. "'Tis well we have a  slight wind from the north," grumbled Mr. Teunis, as he looked out over the beautiful expanse which was now crisping into tiny waves. "If we have to stay much longer losing the tide, we shall be in a   WALTER- OGILBY.        347 pretty fix when the wind dies out. The tide will turn be- fore twelve, and will most likely catch us becalmed off Anthony's Nose." "Such a breeze as this will take us to the Point long before the turn of the tide," said Mr. Ogilby. "Yes, if we could have it all the way. But by the tinme the sun gets above the mountain, you may whistle in vain for a breath of air. Ahl there come the Vandervoorts- nice girls-able to get up in the morning when there's business to be attended to. Never have been to a city boarding-school and learned how genteel it is to keep other people waiting 1 Ah! good-morning, Miss Sarah Ann-igood-morning, Corry. How bright and 'rosy you both look! enough to break the hearts of half the corps of cadets. You were not kept waiting, I see," to Garret and Dr. Van Wyck. "That shows that ycur young ladies are sensible as well as pretty.'? He assisted the buxolllm, smiling young girls from the carriage, and as he did so, he espied another vehicle de- scending the hill.            , "There they are--no, that is Judge Van Antwerp's wavgon.  Pretty good season," cried he, as it drew near. "I need not ask how you do. You were up with the lark, and you look as fresh as a rose. I wish all young ladies knew as well what is becoming. Have you seen anything of the Milbankers? The young ladies seem inclined to be a little fashionable this morning, and the consequence is, we are losing all our fine breeze and tide." "Perhaps Aunt Aulchy is waiting to see the house put all in order before she sets out," suggested the Judge with a quiet smile. "'Here, Garret," he continued, "I give my girls into your charge. Don't let them elope with any of the cadets, that's all. Good-morning, Mr. Walter. Is your man the chief of the Commissary Departnment? If so, I  &#xD;<pb n="348-349" xml:id="VAC7016-00000175"/> 348       WALTER OGILB1.I shall give the basket the old lady has burdened me witlh, into his care." "Yes, Michael goes with us. I thought we might per- {.     haps find him of use to assist in carrying the ladies' bags and baskets up the hill to the Mess Hall."1 "I see you understand Aunt Aulchy,'^ said Mr. Teunis. "By all means let us have a few extra hands to carry the extra baggage. There must be a deal, I should say, by the time it takes to pack. Ah! there they come at last-some of them at least. Where are the rest of you?" as the dearborn containing Gertrude and Alice, with Mr. Halford for their escort, drove along the uneven flooring of the dock. "Mother is in the carriage, with my cousins,-at least I suppose she is there by this time," replied Miss Gertrude. "We left her hunting for her keys, which had been mis- laid. Alice was for staying to help her, but neither of the other girls liked to ride in the open Wagron-and I thought we had better drive on, and warn you to' lay in a good stock of patience." Mr. Ogilby had come forward eagerly to assist the young ladies. The look of pride and delight with which be regarded Alice, and the tone of tenderness with which he addressed her, were not lost upon Gertrude. "Am I too late?" said she to herself;- "yet no--that is impossible-there has been no opportunity." She watched him as be drew her cousin's arm within his own, and walked away toward the spot where the little boat lay swaying against the side of the dock, in the fresh morning breeze. Even the care with which he drew up the loose sleeve over her wrist, as her hand rested within his arm, did not escape her notice. It was all-important that their tete a-tte should be broken up, and she found no diffi- culty in inducing two or three of her cousins to accompanv her to take a survey of the boat, and of all the appliances   WALTER OGILBT:        349 forl comfort which the ingenuity of Mr. Teunis and his sister had devised. The words spoken ere the two were interrupted had been very few. "I have a favor to ask of you--will you consider me your cavalier for the day?" "For the entire dav?"She hesitated. "That will be scarcely possible; besides "She seemed embarrassed. He. thought lie understood the reason. "At least," said he, "you will gratify me so far as this. You wsill walk with me-there will be a good deal of walk- ing, you know. Am I asking too much, when I beg you to consider yourself engaged to accept my escort at such times, even if you should hesitate to do so at others? Is that agreed on?" he asked hurriedly, as he saw the other young people approaching, I Her low and blushing assent was scarcely given before they were joined by Gertrude and'her cousins, and almost immediately after, a shout from Mr. Teunis gave notice of the arrival of the remaining tardy members of the party. Poor Aunt Aulchy was full of apologies and explana- tions. She had been positive as to haying laid the missing bunch of keys in her bureau-drawer, and equally certain that Silvy had abstracted them, in order that she might indulge her- self in t" goin' snoopin' about" in the absence of the family; nor was she quite convinced that there had not been some underhand work, when the keys were at leingth found in her own pocket. Then, they had already driven from the door when she had been obliged to call to Jake to " hold on,'" for she re- melbered that she had forgotten to leave out some raisins for the plum-pudding for her husband's dinner; and though Dinah could make an excellent plain pudding; yet it would b0 .  -   t .  &#xD;<pb n="350-351" xml:id="VAC7016-00000176"/> j'     350       WALTER OGILB I not do for to-day, when "like as not George would be a thinkin' there might just as well have been one of the cocoa- nut-puddin's left behind for him, or some other of their good things, seein' he had to dine all alone there by him- self. " "I made Jake drive wery fast after we did get started," said the good lady, "though I knew I should ache the v\ lhole day long, to pay for it." Mr. Teunis, now that there was no futher impediment to their departure, had recovered his good humor, and seemed anxious by his bland courtesy to wipe out all recollection of his previous want of equanimity. "Come, Captain Ben," cried he to the large-featured, rough, weather-beaten skipper, "you may as well leave sorting out the traps there, and take a look at your passen- gers. It's long since you've seen the like, I'll encgage.' Captain Ben swung himself up on the dock, and with a scarcely perceptible pull at the little straw hat upon the side of his head, gave both his hands to assist the ladies in jumping down into the neat, commodiously arranged, little craft. Mr. Ogilby had not until now allowed his companion to withdraw her hand from his arm. He had taken posses- sion of her parasol and shawl. "Will this be sufficient to protect you from the night air?" he-inquired in a low tone. "We have a drive of more than twelve miles, after crossing the river, and you will re- member that our compact extends to the drive as well,as to the walks." Alice did not dispute this arrangement, and soon they were all comfortably seated and ready for their departure. Miss Maria had been at the pains df rippingr up an old suit of moreen curtains, to form a coverings for the tempo- rary seats which her brother and Captain Ben had coin-   AL TER OGILBY.         351 structed. There was no awning, but the gentlemen had provided themselves with a liberal supply of umbrellas, which furnished a tolerable substitute. The close proximity into which the company was brought by the want of more extensive accommodation, was a subject of complaint to no one but Aunt Aulchy. She panted and puffed, and now and then took occasion to observe,- "It's a wery good thing that soine of us thought of stay- ing at home. I don't know what the rest of us would have done, if we'd all have come. Those that hadn't got the nearest kind of relations at the Point, that they happened to be goin'to see, would be quite a good deal put about by such close scrouging. I expect we'll all be pretty well mussed by the time we get there. But, dear me! Dr. Van Wyck, why didn't Philly come, and Margaret, and Elsa? I'm sure  we shall all miss them so much I And how came Philly to let you come without her? She might have known there'd be plenty of beaux, just as quick as we get to ' the Point.'  Dr. Van Wyck explained that Mr. Vandervoort wished his two daughters to have each an escort on whom they. had an established claim, particularly in the evening prome- nade which would probably form part of the day's enter- tainment. "I dare say," said Aunt Aulchy, with a look of disappro- bation " that's just like Cousin Abraham. He's old enough to be wiser; but," lowering her voice, "what's bred in the bone will never come out of the flesh!" The. sail was just sufficiently filled to take them gently along under the shadow of the eastern mountains, and as they rippled on their way, the whole scene was one of en- chuanting beauty. To Alice, who had never passed through the Highlands before, each moment brought new delight. "There," said Mr. Ogilby, pointing to a low, old-fash-     &#xD;<pb n="352-353" xml:id="VAC7016-00000177"/> ti'j 1   352       WALTER OGILBY. ioned, nearly dilapidated building perched upon a small rising ground at the foot of one of the principal elevations, " in that house, it is said, were quartered a body of our officers when they were summoned to West Point by the intelligence of Arnold's attempted surrender of the post to the enemy." "' And to think that the arch-traitor escaped, while the young gallant emissary of the British commander met an ignominious death !" said Alice, sadly. " And yet, after all, he escaped with only his life. The conscience of one who betrays a trust.reposed in him must be a greater pun- isllment than the gibbet." After a time they came in sight of a bold projecting cliff, the strongly marked outline of which forming the profile of a human face, had given it the quaint name of Anthony's Nose. Ally remarked that this was the spot where Rip Van Winkle's friend, Brom Dutcher, was supposed to have perished in a squall. She had hardly uttered the words, when she reproached herself for her thoughtlessness. The allusion to such an accident, just as they were approaching Break Neck and Crow's Nest, could not fail, she was sure, to recall to her poor aunt the frightful catastrophe which had robbed her of her children and darkened her home for years. She might have spared herself all uneasiness. Aunt Aulchy was deep in a rehearsal to Miss Maria of the dis- comforts of the past rainy week-of the failure of the mar- ket-man with his cart at least three days out of the six-of the necessity she had thereby been laid under of killing a greater number than was at all satisfactory of her fall chickens, a trial to which -she was only reconciled by the comforting suggestion of her husband that those she killed and ate she made sure of, while those she spared might possibly be killed and eaten by the factory-boys.    WA'ALTER OGIL BY.     "   , 353 "And that's wery true, Miss Maria," observed the good lady, " if you don't eat up everything yourself, how can you ever be sure it isn't a goin' somewhere else that you'd rather it wouldn't?" There was much discussion among a portion of the young people of the details contained in letters from the city, received by the Miss Westbrooks on the preceding evening. Catlyna, who to her great satisfaction was seated next her Cousin Pinckney, endeavored to inspire him with an interest in the marriages and engagements which had taken or were to take place in her circle, in tile -departures for Saratoga, Long Branch, or Niacgara, of the different families of their acquaintance, with various other items of news, on all of which Mr, Teunis, now all gayety and glee, furnished a running commentary greatly to the amusement of the circle. The interest of Ally in the pri- vate affairs of people whom she had never seen or heard of, was somewhat difficult to sustain. She found herself constantly forgetting other subjects in the contemplation of the scenery around her,-the bold cliffs, the deep gorges of the mountains, over the summits of which, at rare in- tervals, a bald eagle might be seen slowly winging his flight; the picturesque cottages nestled here and there, each in its cosy nook; the white sails dotting the water, in the clear, tranquil depths of which each object was now reflected as in a mirror. She had been for some minutes quite silent and absorbed, when she was suddenly startled almost into a scream by a sharp, shrill call like a sailor's whistle, breaking suddenly forth from the midst of the group, and which, reaching the opposite cliffs, was echoed and re-echoed around the different peaks until finally lost in some distant gorge of the mountains. '"Oh, you mischievous Garret!" cried Aunt Aulchy. "I was just this minute expecting you to do that. I declare, 30*  &#xD;<pb n="354-355" xml:id="VAC7016-00000178"/> 354       WALTER OGILBY. how vou have frightened me I and there is poor Ally as white as a sheet. Ally, my dear, don't you mind him." "Oh, indeed, aunty!" said Alice, "I am not frightened. I was only a little startled at first. But what a singular choir of echoes!" For her enjoyment the call was repeated again and again. "If Garret's whistle produces such a reverberation," said Gertrude, who, since they first set sail, had seemed bent on making herself generally agreeable, " suppose we trv what would be the effect of voices in a song. 'Come, Catlyna, sing something in which Mr. Halford can join you. 7 "Let us rather have a chorus in which all can join," said that young gentleman. "It would produce a much finer effect. " The suggestion seemed to give pleasure. Two or three animated choruses were gone through, all who had any pretension to musical powers lending their aid. Aunt Aulchy joined in with as much enthusiasm as the rest, catching here and there a word or a note, and beating time in the wrong place, to her own entire satisfaction. Their united powers, however, failing to raise a respecta- ble echo, songs were once more petitioned for. Alice, at Miss Maria's earnest request, sang the touch- ing ballad, '"Highland Mary." Before the close of it the eyes of the company were drawn toward the figure of Captain Ben, who had ap- proached as nearly as possible to the spot where the song- stress sat. With every feature betokening the deepest emotion, he stood gazing at her, and listening to her strain. Then, at its conclusion, dashing the back of his hand across his eyes, and turning away, he remarked,- "I am a rough, hard sort of fellow, but I have my feel-   rIAL TER OGILB Y.        3,55 ings as well as other people ;" after which he soon gained the stern of the boat and resumed his place at the tiller. "Human nature is the same everywhere," said Mr. Ogilby, following Captain Ben with a look of interest. "Yes," observed Mr. Halford, " there is a sympathetic chord in the hearts of all God's children, which sometimes sends forth its music when we least expect it." "There, Miss Morton, there!' cried Mr. Teunis, in great excitement. "Now we have a fine view of West Point!" "Yes, Ally, my dear, there's West Point," said her aunt, approaching her. "Take a good look at it I How do you feel?" "Very well, I thank you, aunt,"; said Ally, laughing. "Did you expect me to be very much overcome at the first sight of a military post?" "Oh, no, no,--it was not that, but I did not know but you mlight be gettin' inpatient; I'm sure I ain. " Ally would not wound her aunt's maternal feelings by assuring her she was quite content with the slow, drifting progress to which the total cessation of the breeze had, for the last hour, condemned them. There were those of the party who complained of the heat of the sun, and of the tediousness of hope deferred; and who, in the absence of other expedients for killing time, now made frequent and vigorous attacks upon one and another of the baskets of delicacies. This helped to accelerate the flight of the lingering no- ments, and to keep the company in their usual spirits until they found themselves sufficiently near to distinguish the figures of those who were awaiting them on the little dock at West Point.  &#xD;<pb n="356-357" xml:id="VAC7016-00000179"/>  CHAPTER XLII. "THERE, Ally, that is him!" whispered her aunt, in an excited tone, not quite inaudible to those who stood near. "There he stands, the tallest of those three.in cadets' uni- form. There is an artillery officer-two of them, I de- clare. I guess one of them is Captain Carter, as he knew we were a comin'. Don't John Peter look handsome ? You've no idea how he has improved since last year. Poor fellow I he is just dying with impatience, now that he sees us so near."  Ally was determined she would not appear to under- stand her aunt while she ran on in this style. She felt that Mr. Ogilby's eyes were upon her, that he would be observing her meeting with her cousin, and she was vexed with herself to find that, spite of all her efforts, she could neither feel nor appear quite at her ease. " The arrival of a party of young ladies must be quite a godsend to the poor, secluded young militaires," said she. "I suppose, without any undue share of vanity, we may imagine a good many hearts to be palpitating in anti- cipation of our coming." "Yes," said Mr. Ogilby, laughing, "you will have an opportunity of observing them by-and-by on parade. How every eye will be looking out under the corner of the cap, to see whether the owner is the object of particular notice or admiration." "Mr. Ogilby I" exclaimed Gertrude, "I am surprised. I did not imagine that you would admit your sex to be so much underi the influence of ours. You who have hitherto owned homage to no onel"     WALTER OGIL BY2.       357 i I have never prided myself on being invulnerable," he replied. (' Invulnerable!" cried Mr. Teunis. "Nobody is invul- nerable. Everybody must have a fit of the tender passion some time or other, just as they do of the measles, or the whooping,-cough. If Ogilby had not his attack early, he will have it the harder, that's all." They were near enough now for smAles and bows of recognition to be exchanged with the party awaiting them, and soon the boat touched the dock, and Captain Ben, springing upon it, answered the challenge of the sen- tinel. There was a gay, joyous expression on the countenances of the young soldiers as they steppecd eagerly forward to assist the ladies in landing. The officers, as became their rank, wore a more dignified air of satisfaction. In the fine face of her cousin alone, as his eves met hers, Alice saw traces of the deepest and most earnest emotion. While greetings, inquiries, and introductions were rapidly ex- changing, and before the preparations for quitting the boat and the final directions to Captain Ben had been fully com- pleted, Alice found her hand drawn through John Peter's arm and held fast as in a vice. "'Remember, you belong to me," said be, in a low, em- phatic tone. "I do not know," she replied, with a little hesitation; "I think--that is, I believe-Mr. Ogilby expects me to walk with hini." "Mr. Ogilbyl What are his claims to mine? Ally, are you out of your senses? Do you think I am made of marble, of adamant, that you really talk of my waiting even till I get out of hearing of this crowd before I learn what I have to hope?" said he, impetuously.

I was not quite certain that you would be able to meet us at the dock." "You can fulfil your promise at another time. What you have to say to him is not life or death, as it is to me." And his passionate tones sank almost to a whisper. "Be- sides, he is not here-he is not in sight--he has walked away with some other young lady." No: Mr. Ogilby was not in sight., He was close behind the speakers, transfixed by what he heard, and for a few minutes utterly unable to move. Before'be recovered him- self they had passed on. Alice looked around after she had proceeded a few yards; but he had turned back to the boat to give some directions to his servant, and so hurried, so full of confusion, had been the whole matter that she did not observe the immediate proximity in which he mutst have stood during the dialogue with her cousin. By a powerful effort, Mr. Ogilby succeeded in master- ing his emotion, and, seeing Mrs. Ellsworth, whom John Peter, in his haste to be off with his cousin, had consigned to the care of Cornelius, slowly toiling up the steep ascent, he mechanically offered her the support of his arm. "Oh, Mr. Ogilby I thank you-; how kind of you to be takin' care of me instead of some of the young ladies. My John Peter begged me not to feel hurt if he walked with Ally; and I said to be sure I would not, for I saw how he was feelin'. He hasn't seen her for a year, you know, poor fellow I Well, he's happy as a lord now, and that makes up. One of these da ys you'll know all about it too, Mr. Walter..

There's John Peter and Ally ahead   WALTER OGILBY.        359 of all the rest I What can she be tellin' him, I wonder? See how earnest they arel" They did, indeed, seem much in earnest: she apparently narrating-he looking down and listening with an air of intense interest. When they had reached the top of the hill, Alice again turned and looked back upon those who were still behind; but her attention was immediately recalled by her impa- tient companion, who seemed bent upon keeping out of ear-shot of the rest of the party. He pointed out to her the monument, the cannon, and the white tents of the en- campment stretched along the eastern verge of the plain; and he even, in a cursory manner, introduced her to the houses of the professors as they passed them; but he showed no disposition to pause in his walk, and it was not until they had crossed the plain and reached the door of the Mess Hall that there was anything like a general re- union of the different members of the party. Alice had hoped that she should there have an opportunity of speak- ing with Mr. Ogilby, and explaining to him how she had happened to fail in her engagement to him, but she could not catch his eye. After being released from the charge of her aunt, he seemed to have found some old acquaint- ances among the officers who were assembled on the steps, and he continued talking with them there, or on the walk in front of the, Hall, until after the others of the party had been received and ushered into the parlor by the gentle- manly landlord. There was company already in the large apartment into which they were shown-gentlemen belonging to the Board of Visitors probably, together with several ladies; and, as the news of the arrival of our party spread abroad, many old acquaintances among the officers, and such among the cadets as could obtain leave, came dropping in to pay their  &#xD;<pb n="360-361" xml:id="VAC7016-00000181"/> 360       WALTER OGIL B I: respects. Ally watched the door as closely as she dared, hoping to see Mr. Ogilby make his appearance "It is singular," said she to herself, "so anxious as he seemed to secure our being together, and yet to absent himself so completely when we were about leaving the boat. It would have been quite easy forme to have asked him to release me from my enmngement just for the one walk. Where could he have been? If-he waere anywhere near, he must have seen how I was taken possession of, in spite of myself. I am certain that in three words I could convince him that I was not to blame. -He would think it both right and kind that I should give John Peter the first half hour." The first half hour seemed, however, by no means to -content John Peter. He was evidently de- termined to monopolize his cousin completely, and, except for the civilities absolutely necessary towards the othei members of the company, scarcely left her side for a mo- ment. His fine, dark eyes were beaming with happiness, and he trod as if on air. An hour or more had passed, when there was a whispered intimation from Miss Maria,- "Brother says that if we wish to refresh our toilets a little, we must do it at once, for we are to dine at two o'clock." John Peter left the room immediately to ascertain what arrangements had been made for the ladies, and Mr. Ogilby, who had at that moment entered the hall, walked slowly into the parlor. Alice's heart bounded, and her countenance lighted up, but he did not join her. He remained near the door, where he had been seized upon by Anne Eliza, and where he found himself compelled to reply to an interminable suc- cession of questions. "Is not this delightful?"' she asked, looking around upon the gay groups. "So brilliant I so exciting! 'Oh, I do love military display! and I think the uniform so be-   WA4LTER OGILB Y.        36l coming. I have been introduced to four or five officers and as many as eight or ten cadets Positively, they were so gallant and complimentary that I had to run away from them. Don't Ally look sweetlyv? I never saw her with such a bloom before. I think those officers are falling in love with her; but it will do them no good-John Peter does not intend that any one shall have a word fromn her but himself, if he can help it. I think he has been down- right rude to the rest of us. I was afraid poor aunt would feel hurt and neglected; but when I spoke to her a6out it, she only laughed and said, 'Oh, no, it's all right;' so I suppose we may think what we please."' To reply to all this vapid nonsense was impossible; in- deed it was quite unnecessary, for the young lady seemed content to monopolize the whole conversation. It was an inexpressible relief to her companion when she hurried off to other subjects, wondering whether they should ascend to old Fort Putnam after dinner, or whether the weather would be too warm, expressing her fears that the visit to the Library and the Drawing Academy would prove rather a dull piece of business, giving her opinion of Mr. Hal- ford's two military friends, and hoping that they would exert themselves to be more agreeable than Cousin Pinck- h ney himself usually was. Compelling himself as he did to remain at a distance from Alice, Mr. Ogilby could not refrain from glancing / dccasionally towards her. Once, while doing so, his eye met hers, and the sweet l smile she gave' him, caused him for a moment to waver. It was a smile of encouragement, as he would once have thought-it might even be a smile of invitation, as if she were expecting and wishing him to join her. A moment was sufficient to restore his resolution. "I have learned how to interpret such smiles," was the 31  &#xD;<pb n="362-363" xml:id="VAC7016-00000182"/> 362       WAALTER OGILB I. !'     indignant thougiht that swelled up in his bosom. "Why should I place myself again in temptation?"7 Something of this feeling lmust have been legible on his countenance, for Alice turned away her head, nor did she look towards him again until the entrance of her cousin to conduct the ladies to the apartments assigned to them. Her resentment, however, was of short duration. She reflected that Mr. Ogilby hlad somre right to feel hurt; and although her breaking through a small part of her enage- ment to him ought not to have been felt so deeply, she was not disposed to be unforgiving of that whllich, after all, had its foundation in regard for her society and conversa- tion. She determined to watch for an occasion of ad- dressing him, and an opportunity was soon afforded by her aunt's beginning to fidget about her basket and shawls. "Dear me, Ally!" she said, "do just ask Mr. Ogilby what his man did with our things, won't you? I saw him a bringin' them up the hill, just behind us." Alice crossed the room, and made the desired inquiry. "I will ascertain what was done with them,"7 was Mr. Ogilby's grave reply. "Michael has returned to the boat." After a few minutes' absence he reappeared, with the, information that all'things belonging to the ladies had been carried to their room above-stairs-and without giving time for further question or remark, he hurriedly passed the group which were now assemubled in the hall, and re-entered the parlor. Alice was surrounded by the whole party still in the midst of their gayety and noisy chatter. She felt the inm- possibility of seeking an explanation at this moment, so she went up-stairs with the rest, to take off her bonnet, bathe her face, and strive to compose her feelings, which were becoming every nmonent more and more uncomfort- able. i?    WALTER OGILB IY.        363 C HA PTE R   XLII I. GERTRUDE had been a close observer of all that was going forward. She did not guess what Mr. Ogilby had overheard while standing. near her brother and Alice on the dock, but she perceived that he was greatly disturbed; a doubtless by jealousy of the devoted attention paid by the one, and, apparently, not repelled by the other. It was with a feeling of triumph that she observed how circum- stances seemed concurring, beyond her most sanguine hopes, to aid in the accomplishment of plans, towards which, since the morning she discovered Mr. Ogilby's attachment to Alice, all her thoughts and energies had been directed. The Mess Hall was not a large and well-appointed hotel for the accomnmodation of crowds of visitors. At that day West Point had not become a place of fashionable resort. Except during the Examination weeks, strangers rarely made it a stopping place. The domain, and all per- taining to it, belonged to "Uncle Salm," and none save his retainers were supposed to have any legitimate business there. The arrival of a party of young people from abroad was sure therefore to be hailed with a warm welcome, and could hardly fail of creating a general sensation. In default of more extensive accommodations, the ladies of our party had been' provided with two large dressing- rooms on the second floor. Here, amid the merriment and gossip with which she was surrounded, Alice had as little opportunity as before for dwelling on her own sources of disquietude.  &#xD;<pb n="364-365" xml:id="VAC7016-00000183"/> 364       WALTER OGILBI. "Mr. Ogilby is displeased," said she to herself, " that is evident, and he seems resolved not to give me a chance to explain. As he asked me to walk with him, however, he cannot do otherwise than offer me his escort when we set out to visit the Academy, as is proposed. I must then tell him. all, whatever John Peter may think or say." The ringing of the large dinner-bell brought the ladies down-stairs again in renovated bloom and beauty. They found many gentlemen, chiefly military, waiting to receive them and conduct them to the dining-room. John Peter was at the foot of the stairs, ready to offer his arm to his cousin. "Have you got the letter?" he whispered. "Yes, but I cannot give it to vou now." "Well, then, after we are seated at table." He took his seat next her, and stealthily possessing him- self of her bag, drew from it a letter, which he put in his pocket, regardless of her reproving glances-after which he pursued his conversation with her, now and then whsper- ing in such a confidential manner that she became at length quite annoyed. "Don't devote yourself so entirely to me, please, John Peter," said she. "It will attract the notice of the conm- pany." He looked at her with a bright, mischievous simile. "Let it," said he,-" what do we care?" "I care. See, Mr. Halford is looking at us. I have no doubt he hears every word you say." "If he is looking at me, he is looking at the happiest dog in the universe. And I will thank you to laugh, Ally, and not keep such a grave face on, as if you had no sym- pathy with me.  When did you say you received the letter?" "Yesterday morning."   IVALTER OGILBY.        365 "Well, I have a great mind to read it now, standing up Lbefore the company, and calling on them all to fall down and die with envy of imy felicity." Alice saw that it was in vain to attempt to repress the exuberance of her cousin's spirits. He did not understand why she should feel serious, and he was constantly en, deavoring by some lively sally to draw a smile and pre- vent her from relapsing into thoughtfulness. Mr. Halford, who was seated opposite, lost nothing of what was pass- ing. He saw that Miss Morton was not in her usual spirits, and lie detected her occasional glances towards the lower part of the table, where Mr. Ogilby lad taken his seat between Gertrude and one of the Miss Van Antwerps. Gitty was at all the expense of the conversation, and she exerted herself so effectually to intertain her companion that she at least prevented his want of cheerfulness from be- coming conspicuous. Mr. Ogilby's feelings had grown somewhat calmer. The opporthunity for reflection afforded him by the half hour's absence of the ladies before dinner, had enabled him to review quietly all that had taken place. "After all, if there were an attachment in the case, as the words of young Ellsworth seemed to imply, might it not be entirely on his part?" After watching Alice care- fully while she was in the parlor he had been able to per- ceive nothing in her countenance or manner beyond a placid friendliness, such as was becoming from one cousin to another. He could detect no blushing, no timidity- nothing, in short, like what he had at times seen there. But, then, John Peter had spoken of " his claims," of her "belonging to him,"-what could that mean? He was perplexed, yet he would not quite despair, She had prom- ised to walk with him. He would lose no tinme in asking her decidedly what was to be his fate. The stolen observations he was able to make during o  1   '     t  &#xD;<pb n="366-367" xml:id="VAC7016-00000184"/> "1 i.;i   366       WALTER OGILBY. dinner did not tend, on the whole, to reassure him. The manner of young Ellsworth towards his cousin was, as all must perceive, very lover-like. True, she did not seem to encourarge it, but if it were not agreeable, why did she permit it? Bewildered and miserable, he longed to leave the table, but he could not do so without rudeness ; and Gertrude carried her point of detaining him in conversation with herself and Captain Carter, who was on her other side, until all the rest of the company had crossed the hall and passed into the parlor. With the most easy and natural air she kept by his side, and found no difficulty, on entering after the others, in call- ing his notice to some military manceuvres that were going on upon the plain-a full view of which could only be ob- tained from one of the windows on the farther side of the apa,rtment. IIis attention soon returned to one particular group among the company. Alice was standing beside Miss Maria, surrounded by several gentlemen. Mr. Hal- ford was there, and one of his young military friends, whom he had just found an opportunity of introducing, also her cousin, with one of his class-mates. A very ani- mated conversation was going on, and the young gentle- men seemed to listen with delight and interest whenever Alice spoke. "How well Ally looks!" remarked Gertrude. "Yes, she looks uncommonly well," replied Mr. Ogilby, feeling that he must say something. More captivating even than usual. She seems to be turning all the young gentlemen's heads. I wonder you are philosophical enough to hold yourself aloof!" He winced a little. "Have you forgotten our friend Teunis' proclamation, that the young ladies were to be re- served for the especial homage of the military while -on military ground?"    WALTER OGILBY.        367 "Ah! true, and Ally appears to be receiving her share of it. It's no wonder she is so much admired, with her beauty and attractive manners." "Her manners are certainly very attractive." "And," continued Gertrude, with an air of candor, "considering' her personal advantages--her power of charming your sex-I do not think she is inclined to be coquettish." "An inclination to that species of treachery which we call coquetry must depend less upon the personal advan- tages, than upon the moral attributes. A woman is not necessarily false because she is beautiful." Gertrude went on. "Some girls would, without intending to be really false, use their power to torment the man who loved them. 1 think Ally has nothing of that disposition, and I rejoice at it, for my brother's sake." Mr. Ogilby started as if a serpent had stung him. "Your brother?" said he. "Yes, John Peter is, as you know, a fine, noble hearted fellow, but extremely sensitive, too much so for his own happiness. Fortunately, Ally is a good, sensible girl, and does not trifle with his feelings." Mr. Ogilby nerved himself for the worst. "Are your brother and Miss Morton engaged?" She turned and looked at him with an air of surprise. "Can you doubt it?" said she. "Unquestionably they are. Perhaps I have no right to speak of it publicly, since it has not been announced. It has been a long attachment, but there have been obstacles, not on her part, however. I gather from something my brother once let fall, that her father objected on account of his profession. However, I take it for granted the old gentleman has relented, or he would not have brought her to see us this summer. She  &#xD;<pb n="368-369" xml:id="VAC7016-00000185"/> ,J!:  had a letter, too, yesterday," (Mr. Ogillbv had seen that letter abstracted from Ally's reticule!) " which seems to have put the finishing touch to their happiness. Doubt- less it was a great trial to her father to give her up, but I suppose he cannot stand out against 'almighty love.' We are all, of course, very much delighted, especially my father, who is very fond of my cousin. I learn from my mother that there is no doubt of his intention to make my brother a handsome addition to his income, such as will enable him to marry as soon after he gets his commission as my uncle will give his consent.7" Gertrude might have talked till the crack of doom about plans and intentions. Mr. Ogilbv learned nothing of them. The one stunning fact that Alice was lost to him, that she was to marry another, was all that his mind took in. How could he so miserably have deceived himself? How imagined that she understood and was beginning- to return his attachment? But had she not understood him? Was she really so unsophisticated, so free from everythincr coquettish, as her cousin admitted her to be? Hie could not tell-he could not judge. He knew but this, that all hope was crushed, and that he was wretched-unutter- ably wretched. And what was he now to do?  IIow could he approach and address her again?  Was it incumbent on hinm to claim the fulfilment of her promise to walk with him? 'What right had she to make such a promise when she was coming to meet the man she was engaged to, after a year of separation? Perplexed with these and similar considerations, he re- plied at random to the questions addressed to him by Ger- trude. He would not look at Alice, but strove to direct his regards resolutely past her, towards the open door which led into the hall. In doing so, his attention was  WALTER OGILBY.         3. 9 caught by the figure of a distinguished-looking officer somewhat advanced in years who, in slowly promenading up and down the hall, was taking a leisurely survey of the company.  Suddenly the officer's countenance lighted up-he stepped quickly forward, entered the apartment, and, seizing Ally by both hands, while he kissed her heartily on the cheek,- "My dear little girl," cried he, " how came you here? Who would have thought of meeting you in this, of all places on earth?"          I "Colonel Grafton!" exclaimed Ally, laughing and blush- ing. "How delighted I anm to see you I Is Mrs. Grafton with you?" "Yes, indeed! Did you ever hear of her letting me stir without her? She is over at Professor B----'s, and I must take you to her this moment. She will not for- give mle if I wait longer than for you to put on your bonnet." "Let me first introduce you to nmy aunt, under whose care I am," said Alice, and she turned to where the good lady sat in a large rocking-chair, fanning herself, and gaz- ing about with an air of supreme enjoyment. "Aunty, here is Colonel Grafton, a very dear friend of papa's and of poor grandmamma's. Uncle George, I know, / ill be so glad to see him! And Mrs. Grafton is here, too, at the house of one of the professors. Have you any ob- jection to my running away a little while to see her?" "Not in the least, my dear. I am wery happy to see Colonel Crampton, I'm sure. Thalnk you, sir, I'm wery well, for me, only I'm a little tired this warmn afternoon. Mr. Ellsworth is not here just now, but we are expecting him every minute fronm Cold Spring on the other side. Ally dear, if you go, you must hurry back, for they are all goin' presently to wisit thie Academy, you know. And  &#xD;<pb n="370-371" xml:id="VAC7016-00000186"/> 370       WALTER OGILBY. now I think of it, John Peter had better walk along with you, and then he can bring you back again."' Colonel Grafton politely seconded the invitation, and Ally went for her bonnet and scarf. When she returned, she ventured to cross the room to the window where Gertrude was standing with Mr. Ogilby. She felt her color rising as she observed that-his countenance did not soften while she stood explaining to hei cousin her proposed visit. On the contrary, there was a rigidity .abut the lines of his handsome mouth, unlike anything she had before seen there. Where was the beautiful smile that had been wont to greet her? She bowed to him as she turned to go, but neither did she smile now. CHAPTER XLIV. THE warm welcome which Alice received from Mrs. Grafton was followed by the thousand and one questions which friends naturally ask, after a two years' separation. These, with the introduction to the different members of the professor's family, and the detailed explanations of her friend as to the length of this year's circuit of travel, and the various incidents propitious or otherwise which had befallen in the course of it, prolonged the call beyond what Ally had intended-and even at last she could not get away without a promise to repeat her visit, if possible, in the evening. "We shall come over to call on your friends, and then we shall make sure of you," said the ladies, who had been I/ -  greatly pleased, the elder with Alice, the younger with her F   Ihandsome cousin. i; "    WALTER OGILBT.        371 "And I shall come," said Mrs. Grafton, "that I may talk with your aunt about sparing you to us for a little trip to Saratoga. We are going there next, and we should be delighted to take you with us." "Do not give yourself the trouble to return with us, Colonel," said Alice, " for we are going directly to explore the different parts of the Academy, up-stairs and down- stairs, and all around, I am told, and you will not care to run about with us, I am certain, on such a warm afternoon. We shall meet by-and-by on the plain, when the weather is a little cooler.." And sle was suffered to depart with her cousin. When they had walked a little way, "John Peter, I have a re- quest to make of you," she said. "If I find an opportu- nity of speaking with Mr. Ogilby at any tinme this after- noon, will yoube so good as to leave me, and let nrc have a few words with him, by myself? I think he did not quite understand how 1 came to break lmy engagement with him this morning, and I wish to explain." "Why don't you walk right up. to him, then, and say, 'Mr. Ogilby, my cousin would carry me off this morning because I had somlething, to tell him that he was dying to hear; and now. that is over, I am ready to walk with you as much as you please.'" Ally laughed. L Perhaps I shall say something like it, but it had better be by ourselves." "Well, I must own, I never gave Ogilby credit for being so extremely tenacious. Upon the whole, Ally, I don't think I would make him any explanation at all. Why could he not have come to you and reminded you pleas- aintly of your promise, as Garret or Teuny Benthouse would have done? A man must be very much of a puppy to take offence at such a trifle. Forgetting to walk or to dance with one, is no such heart-breaking matter."  &#xD;<pb n="372-373" xml:id="VAC7016-00000187"/> 332       WALTER O0GIL  "I did not forget," said Ally. "Neither do I think Mr. Ogilby is anything of a puppy. I broke my word, and I ought to tell him how it happened. If that is not sufficient, we can let the matter drop." "Certainly-by all means, it is not worth talking of." "Would you have dismissed the matter so coolly-if the case had been reversed, and you had been the one I ran away from this morning?" "Ah! but that is a different case, altogether a different case." "Not as much so as you imagine," thought Ally. When they arrived at the Mess Hall, they found the parlor deserted. A few gentlemen sat reading or smoking in a room opposite, but through the open door, as they passed, Alice could see that they were all strangers. "They have got tired of waiting for us, and-have gone on to the Academy," said she; "but your mother would hardly have undertaken it. Wait here till I go up-stairs and see." In the room above, she found her aunt, who immediately began to apologize for the rest of the party. "They waited as long as they could, my dear; but Gitty thought they had better be off, because there is so much to be seen there, and after that, they have got to go to Kuzzy, Kuzzy---" "Kosciusko's Garden," suggested Alice. "Yes, Kuzzy-cross-cow's Garden, and then there will be the evenin' parade afterwards. Your uncle will be here to take me to see that. As for Cornel'us, I haven't set eyes on him since we got here. He's off to the encampment I suppose." "Won't you be lonely, aunty? Had not you rather I would stay with you?" "Oh, no, my dear! I'm goin' to lie down and take a nap.   WALTER OGILBY.        313 Mr. Ogilby stayed behind the rest, and I believe he was a goin' to sit with me till you come back, but I told him he must excuse me, for I was quite worn out, and if it was out of politeness to you he was stayin', he need not give himself that trouble, for John Peter would take care of you." "Did Mr. Ogilby go away then?" asked Alice in as in- different a tone as she could assume. "No, he only went out on the front steps, and he was standin' there when I came through the hall on my way up-stairs. I thought he was looking off towards the pro- fessor's house to see if you was a comin'." Ally rejoined her cousin and they walked towards the Academy, which was but a few steps from the Mess Hall. Before ascending the stairs that led to the Drawing School, John Peter suddenly stopped. "Ally," said he, "I don't quite understand this business. If you thought Ogilby was offended, why did you not explain to him in the parlor after our arrival there?" "I had no opportunity." "You mean that he gave you none? I remember now that he has kept aloof from the outset. But you went to the window once, where he was standing with Gitty." "That was not the proper time. We were just on the eve of departure with Colonel Grafton, and I could not have said all I wished." "I see how it is, Ally," said her cousin, growing warm; "he is inclined to make a great fuss about a trifle. I know, although you will not own it, that you have tried to explain the matter, which, anybody would think, is simple enough, and he still chooses to play the offended. Now, he will please to understand that he is to put on/no airs with you." John Peter began to feel that he had been to blame- that he had acted selfishy in not listening to his cousin's 32 Xf  &#xD;<pb n="374-375" xml:id="VAC7016-00000188"/> 374       WALTER OGILBY. request of waiting a little, when he first seized upon her and hurried her away. The conviction that he had him- self been wrong, made him only the more anxious to find blame in another, and he was fast working himself into an uncomfortable state of feeling towards Mr. Ogilby. The reaction after the unwonted excitement of his spirits in the morning was beginning to show itself in an unusual degree of captiousness. "Mr. Ogilby will not be inclined to put on airs," was Ally's quiet reply. "A very few words will suffice to set the matter right."  "If they do not, I hope you will never speak to him again," 'said her cousin. By this time they had arrived at the Academic building, and were ascending the stairs which led to the rooms above. A gentleman was standing by the open window in the passage at the head of the stairs. He turned as they approached, and Alice saw that it was Mr. Ogilby. Perhaps he had been waiting there in hopes to meet her, perhaps he repented of his cold and distant man- ner when they were last together. She stopped. John Peter, still under a feeling of irrita- tion, gave the'slightest possible inclination of his head, and walked into the Drawing Hall, the door of which stood open. "Are you not well?" asked Alice; with an air of solici- tude, for she was startled at the paleness of Mr. Ogilby's countenance. "Perfectly well, I thank you" The tone of his voice was so unlike his ordinary one, that Alice could hardly proceed with what she had to say. She felt the tears rush- \;   ing to her eyes, but she resolutely kept them back. She I   went hurriedly on, though her words nearly choked her. EIi   "You thought me rude, and I was very sorry to appear so, I wish to explain, but it would take longer time than   1W'ALTER OGILBY.       375 this place will afford us." She paused a monent, but he did not answer. "I had no intention of breaking through my engagement to walk with you. John Peter was wrong to insist as he did, even under the circumstances,-I fear you are offended." "Offended! Oh! Miss Morton!" he exclaimed in a tone of anguish. Then softening-"Pray do not distress your- self-I am not offended-what right have I?" "If I had an opportunityto tell you all the circum- stances -" "I have no wish to hear them," said he, turning from her. "I have received a sufficient explanation-all that can be given." "I do not understand you," said she. He glanced to- wards her as she gave him one sad and reproachful look; and, after standing irresolute a moment, she turned and fol- lowed her cousin into the Drawing Hall. Mr. Ogilby continued for a few minutes longer gazing out the window in such an attitude that John Peter, who was waiting just within the open door, could not see his countenance. "Well," said he in a low tone to his cousin, "did you' succeed in smoothing the ruffled plumes of the young laird? Commend me to a Scotch temper." "I think you are a little warm yourself," said Ally, striving for composure. "Who would not be, to see a great six-foot fellow acting like a school-girl? Well, he is quite satisfied now, I hope." Ally was silent. "Did he accept your explanation politely, and say he would think no more of the matter? I see he did not. I must go and talk to him'-you are fretting about it now, Allyice, alarmed.

"You certainly cannot think it would be agreeable to me, to have you get into a quarrel on my account? This day, of all others, you ought to think of nothing but what is peaceful and pleasant. Mr. Ogilby said he was not offended, and that the explanation he had received was all that was necessary. Now let us talk of something else. The greater part of the company had already finished their survey of the drawings of the pupils, and had pro- ceeded on their tour of inspection. Mr. Halford was still in the apartment, and he came for- ward to join Alice and make the circuit of the room with her, examining the aquarelles and crayon drawings, point- ing out the merits or defects of the different pieces, and ex- erting himself so much to entertain her, that by dint -of a very strong effort she was able to preserve in some de- gree her usual serenity of manner. The Library, in which they found the rest of their friends, the Laboratory, the Chapel, and eventhe Dining Hall of the Institution were successively visited; after which, as the afternoon was growing cooler, the whole party set off for the encampment and Kosciusko's Garden. Mr. Ogilby, who had now joined them, did not avail himself of Ally's hint of her readiness to' walk with him. He left her to the escort of her cousin, or whichever of the other young soldiers could secure a place by her side. Ger- trude had maneuvred to place, herself near him, in hopes he would offer her his arm--he manifested, however, no intention of the kind, even when she approached him quite closely.  "You will remember," said she in a low tone, "that what I told you of my brother's affairs was entirely confidential." "Of course," he replied. "Since my brother has spoken of it only to his own family, I should be sorry he should know that I have been   WTALTER OGILBY        37 7 less discreet. I must confess, however, that I greatly disap- prove of keeping these things secret A knowledge of the actual position of affairs may sometimes save a great deal of trouble--even positive disappointment and unhappi- IleSS. X "We must not dispute your brother's right to publish as much or as little of his own affairs as he thinks fit," said Mr. Ogilby, gravely. "You may depend that I will betray no confidence." And he turned away and joined Miss Maria Van Benthuysen, thinking probably that she was not included in the reservation made by her brother in favor of their military attendants. How gladly would he have quitted the party altogether,  and wand dered away, among the woods and hills, or along the rocky banks of the river, to commune with his own troubled spirit! But that was out of the question. He must bear his part in all that was going on, and wear a serene countenance while every nerve was throbbing with agony. CHAPTER XLV. l ,To Alice everything she saw had the charm of novelty. The varied scenery, here so soft there so rugged; the wide-extended plain, dotted with magnificent trees and bor- dered, on the east by the white, glittering encampment, and on the west by old Fort Put, looking down in solemn, ven- erable contemplation; to the north the swelling highlands, enclosing the blue Hudson, on whose placid bosoni reposed sweet Pollopells, amid its fleet of starry sails! There was nuch to touch the feelings in the history of 32*  &#xD;<pb n="378-379" xml:id="VAC7016-00000190"/> t'7X8       AWALTER OGILBY. a shaft of white marble, standing like a lonely sentinel on the high precipitous bank of the river-commemnorating, as it does, the Hero and the Exile who, after striking his last ineffectual blow for freedom, had rushed to a foreign shore, and upon this spot found a solace in his hours of solitude and sorrow. There was at each step and in every feature around her something to prompt the observations with which Alice would, under other circumstances, have turned to one, of whose sympathy and appreciation she would have felt secure. Why was he so estranged? What had so changed his feelings toward her? Anger, she was certain, had no place in his heart; neither indifference, for a little incident had occurred which showed him as attentive to her comfort and as watchful as ever. - John Peter, being an officer of the corps, and under the necessity of preparing for evening parade, had been com- pelled to quit her side, and repair to his post of duty-Mr. Halford and his friend the young lieutenant had thus be- come her escort, and the party, after visiting the encamp- ment, bad proceeded to explore the desolate, uncultivated spot known as Kosciusko's Garden. All around this place was wild, tangled, and neglected. No trace of former efforts at embellishment was now remaining. The winding, taste- ful, well-kept "Flirtation Walk" had not yet been devised, though doubtless the want of some such retreat had occa- sionally suggested itself to the young and romantic. The monument of the Exile stood on a little terrace be- low the level of the plain. It was proposed by some of the party to descend to it, spite of the briars and untrimmed shrubbery which threatened danger to the delicate dresses of the ladies. Miss Maria, who had throughout the walk perseveringly kept close to Ally, was at this moment im-    mediately behind her. A rough, dry bit of branch in the path of the latter caught the sklirt of her dress as she passed. Mr. Ocilby set his foot upon it, then stooped and disen- gaged thetrimming in which it had become entangled. The sudden movemnent occasioned the light scarf she wore to fall backwards-he raised it and laid it gently over her shoulders. She blushed as she observed who it was that was assist- ing her, and as her eye met his, she felt almost sure he was going to speak. He did not, however, but fell back and allowed her to pass on where Lieutenant Barton was beat- ing back the projectingo branches to make a pathway for the ladies to proceed. "How strange," said Ally, "that he should continue so very grave, even after I have explained-indeed apolo- gized!  Ought I to have spoken first? But what could I have said? Perhaps he would rather I should not speak to him?"  Some one of the party remarked, "When I was here last, I was witness to a frightful scene. A woman, the wife of one of the soldiers, threw herself from the cliffs, and was crushed to death upon the rocks below.  I saw the poor creature as they were carrying  her bleeding remains in a sheet across the plain to the hospital, though life was already extinct." The young ladies uttered exclamations of horror. "What could have prompted her to commit such an act?" cried they. "Jealousy, I was informed," said the speaker. "Of her husband? How dreadful!" "Only think of that, Mr. Ogilby, "'cried Anne Eliza, always forward and flippant, " see the devotion of our sex I If you gentlemen should get jealous, do you think you would, any of you,' make away with yourselves in that manner?"  &#xD;<pb n="380-381" xml:id="VAC7016-00000191"/> 380       WAT LTER OGILBY. "Tlat would depend upon the badness of our tempers," replied Mr. Ogilby. "I think such actions are usually committed with 'a view of punishing the offender by en- tailing a life-long remorse. And yet,"' added he, after a moment's pause, "who knows what wrongs may have driven      the poor woman to mak e the fatal plunge -what longing to end at once her sorrows and her life!" "Women bear these things better than men, as a gen- eral rule,"' said Miss Maria. "One reason is they have to bear them more frequently."v There was a general protest from the gentlemen against Miss Maria's assertion,and an- animated discussion ensued upon the comparative constancy of the sexes. "What is your opinion, Mr Ogilby?" cried 'his little tormentor, seeing that he listened instead of taking part in the conversation. "I suppose I must not be too tenacious for my own sex," said he. "If a lady ever a7ppears inconstant, we must believe that the gentleman has been credulous or presumptuous."  F  "Does he mean this foi me?" thought Ally; and she grew more and more perplexed and silent. The inspiring sounds of martial music, among the strains of which could be distinguished the notes of Wyllys' keyed bugle, at that time reputed the finest instrument in the world, soon drew the party back to the neighborhood of the encampment. The tread of the sentinels, the falling into rank of the well- appointed young soldiers, the answer to the roll-call, the different military formalities observed, all interested Ally, in spite of herself. As her mind was diverted, she grew more hopeful. "If I can but convince him -that he is under some mis- apprehension," said she, " all will be peace and-happiness again." And with this consoling thought, she strove to   WALTER OGILBE:        381 address herself cheerfully to the business of looking and listening. Ere long the party were joined by her uncle and aunt. "Ahl  Ally--how are you, my daughter?" was the greeting of the former, as he took her hand affectionately. It was his customary style of addressing her, but Mr. Ogilby had never heard it before, and it did not aid him in his struggle to appear composed. "Well, have you had a charming time to-day?" was the next question. "I have seen a vast deal that was new and interesting,7 said she, after a moment's hesitation--" the sail down the river was delightful." "Have you been a good girl and not broken too lany hearts? I wonder how many of those poor fellows will be in the guard tent, or perhaps in the black-hole, to-mor- -row, for neglect of duty, after the terrible upsetting you young misses have been giving them to-day! And, speak- ing of the guard tent, Mr. Barton, I suppose our friend K---- (Devil K---- as it was the fashion to call him) passed about as much of his time in that pleasant retreat as any member of the corps you have had?" "You are greatly mistaken," said the lieutenant, laugh- ing. "He played more pranks and was guilty of more escapades than any other fellow in the corps, but he was smart enough to keep himself almost invariably out of punishment. " "How he used to annoy your commandant, Major W---!"7 "  Yes, and in such a way that he could not well take notice of it. I will give you an instance. You know the Major is great on regulations-in factf, we have a new set almost every evening.

K 'chafed under this system, till he worked himself up to a tremendous pitch. 'I'll show him,' says he, 'that I'll ob- serve neither little nor great of his rules, unless I choose.' The next evening, just at parade, K--  made his appear- a-nce on the ground out of uniform, with his cap set jauntily upon the side of his head, a cigar in his mouth, his hands in his pockets, and sauntered, with a nonchalant air, just within range of the Major'seye, as he stood before the corps waiting for it to form. The officer naturally ex- pected a salutation-none was vouchsafed. "' Mr. K--,' called he in a solemn tone, from the very depths of his chest. "'Halloo!' was the reply. "'Mr. K---- , very slowly-' are you aware that you are addressing your superior officer?' "'Of course I am.' "'And are you aware, sir, of a regulation that requires you to salute your superior officer?' "'Of course I am.' "'And are you aware, sir,' pursued the Major, growing furious, 'of a regulation forbidding the use of tobacco, in whatever form? And of a regulation prescribihg that the' cap should be worn on the top of the head, sir?' "'Of course, of course I am. But you see, Major, I am on the sick report to-day, and consequently I am excused from all duty,' and he coolly walked away." "I don't think it was wery civil of him to talk so to his commandin' officer," observed Aunt Aulchy. "No, nobody thought it very civil, but the Major rel- ished a joke as well as anybody, and he took no notice of the affair publicly,-if he admonished K--  at all, it was in private. " Many other anecdotes were told among the gentlemen,   WALTER OGILBY.         383 in which the ladies were not invited to take part, though they occasioned roars of laughter. One we will venture to record, after asking pardon of the fastidious among our fair leaders. The following order was read one evening by the adjutant: "The members of the corps will appear hereafter on parade with their shirt-collars turned down, instead of standing, as heretofore.:"  Tihe next morning the corps presented itself for inspec- tion in regulation trim-all except K -, whose appear- ance attracted general notice, from the profusion of white linen apparent about his throat and shoulders. "Mr. K--," called the deep bass of the Major. K---   promptly stepped out of the ranks. "Can you explain, sir, your appearance in this style on parade? And are you aware," emphatically, " of the reg-u-la-tion, sir?"  ,' I art, sir," replied K-- , deferentially, "and it is in trying th follow it, that I am in this plight. I have turned my collar down, quite below my arms, as far as I can get it, and I'll be hanged if I know what to do with the rest of the garment that has to be turned upwards in this sort of fashion!" The band poured forth its sweetest strains. The corps Swent through their appointed manoeuvres, marching around and across the plain, followed by the crowd of admliring spectators; "Very like," as Mr. Teunis observed, " a Yan- kee training day, only that the molasses-candy and ginger- bread were wanting." Aunt Aulchy was in extacies. She felt no sensation of fatigue She had fallen again in company with Colonel Grafton, who was a jolly, amusing person, very much to her taste, and he had brougrht Mrs. Grafton and bad intro-  &#xD;<pb n="384-385" xml:id="VAC7016-00000193"/> 384       WAI4LTER OGILBY. duced them to each other. The two ladies were soon taking sweet counsel together-the one holding forth about her John Peter, the other about matters and things in general, particularly about her favorite Ally, whom she now expressed a hope of persuading to accompany her to Saratoga. "My husband will go to Milbank for her, with your permission," said Mrs. Grafton. "Oh, the Colonel is wery kind, but it would not do at all, just now. You saw my son,-I believe, ma'am, he called with his cousin to see you,-that's him with the three long, pointed straps down the sleeve,-a mark of honor, as I suppose you know, ma'am. He stands wery high-one of the first five. He has tried wery hard for that, so he could be sure to get into the Engineers or the Artillery, because then, if he should happen to marry and settle down, he would not have to go away to one of them distant posts." "Marrying in the army is very little like settling down," said Mrs. Grafton, laughing. it That is wery true, and I suppose it is natural that some people should make objections on that score. But John Peter is so wery fond of his profession that I suppose nothin' would ever induce him to give it up." "A very splendid officer he will make," said Mrs. Graf- ton, politely. "I was much struck with his appearance, and so were the Miss B -s, who saw him when he called." "Yes, ma'am, he called with Ally. I suppose you didn't see anything unnatural in their calling together? They are always most happy when they are together, and always will be, I suppose," significantly. "Ah, indeed I Well, that must be pleasant to you, for Ally is the loveliest young creature I I have known her   WALTER OGILBY.         385 intimately from her childhood. We pass many of our furloughs at Ashfield, where my husband has a sister mar- ried. I suppose then that it is indeed in vain for me to think of persuading her away just at present?" Ally heard all this, and she was determined to bear it no longer. She had talked and laughed far more than she felt any inclination to do, in hopes that her aunt's words would be unheard by any save Mrs. Grafton. She now feigned an excuse for drawing her aside to arrange some part of her black lace shade; while doing this she spoke earnestly,;- "Please, dear aunty, don't couple my name and John Peter's together in this manner. .There is no reason in the world why you should. He would be as much annoyed as I am, if he were to hear you." Her aunt looked at her in surprise "Whyj mercy, my dear child!" said she, "if I had thought I was worryin' you, I would not have said a sin- gle word.  ell, don't feel so bad. I won't open my lips about it again." And the poor lady actually held her tongue, and looked quite demure for the next five minutes; making herself amends, however, by repeating internally,- "How wery queer girls always do act! I remember when I was a girl!" 33  &#xD;<pb n="386-387" xml:id="VAC7016-00000194"/> 386    .   WALTER OGILBI'. CHAPTER XLVI. THE booming of the evening gun from the rising ground on the verge of the plain, and the lowering of the flag upon its staff, were the signals for the return of the party to the Mess Hall. Alice felt so dispirited that she was glad to accept the invitation of the professor's lady, and accompany her and her daughters home to tea. This gave her an opportunity of correcting, with her friend Mrs. Grafton, the false im- pression created by her aunt's innuendoes. It enabled her, too, to rally her spirits, and recall a little more of her usual philosophy than she had been able to do in Mr. Ogilby's presence. She was prone to look on the bright side of the picture, and as she could see no reason why the present disturbed state of feeling in which be had been so unaccountably thrown, should not be dissipated by a little calm reflection, or at any rate by the further explanation which she should unquestionably have an opportunity, ere long, of giving him, she endeavored to think as little upon the subject as possible, but to look forward with hope and cheerfulness. The company at the Mess Hall were taking their seats at the tea-table, when young Ellsworth, who was again released from duty, entered. His first inquiry was after his cousin. Mr. Halford, to whom the question was ad- dressed, gave him the information of her having gone to Professor B----'s. He took a seat, but after remaining a few minutes, he rose, excused himself to those nearest him, and left the company.   WALTER OGILBY.         387 In process of time, the full strains of the band, which through the gallantry of the officers had been stationed under the trees at a little distance from the Hall, were an irresistible temptation to the company to walk forth and listen. Mr. Ogilby had not joined the circle in the parlor after tea. He had stood with the other gentlemen on the steps in front of the Hall where, in spite of his resolutions to the contrary, he could not refiain from casting frequent glances towards the residences of the professors, on the steps of more than one of which were young ladies at- tended by gentlemen in military costume. He had no dif- ficulty, while the daylight lasted, in distinguishing the group whose movements most interested him.  He ac- knowledged that this was folly, but his feelings could not be controlled by the dictates of wisdom. His only com- fort was in watching them, and making himself as miser- able as possible. After the twilight had quite faded away, that part of the plain where the music was stationed became a place of general resort. Everybody was walking abroad, listening or conversing as the humor dictated. It was soon too dark for the persons composing the different parties to be fully distinguished, except when their voices, indicative in most instances of hilarity and enjoyment, would identify the speakers. There was no moon, and the stars shone but dimly through a thin veil of mist that was rising. Mr. Ogilby had taken his station alone under one of the broad-spreading trees near the band. He was glad to be released from all observation-to be left to his own solitary wretchedness. Presently some one was speaking near him. "Ally has been so dull this afternoon! What can be the matter? All the way down she was in such fine spirits!" "I think she complained of a headache. The day has i '  &#xD;<pb n="388-389" xml:id="VAC7016-00000195"/> 388       WALTER OGILB Y. been very warm, and you young ladies have all had to exert yourselves more than usual." "And John Peter, he seems put out, too, about some- thing." The voices were those of Catlyna and her cousin, Mr. Halford. They passed on, and Mr. Ogilby was left to connect in his own mind the remarks he had heard with Ally's reply to her uncle. "Yes," said he, bitterly, " she was happy then, and I, weak and infatuated that I was, imagined that I had some part in that happiness, of which only the anticipation of meeting her lover was the cause 1' Other parties were passing .to and fro, quite near him. While the music was playing, no other sounds could be heard, but in the intervals the talking or laughing of the different groups was quite audible. At length there were familiar voices again, so close that although spoken very low, the words were perfectly distinct. , I must get a leave and come up in a few days. I can- not wait two weeks for my furlough. I must see my father alone and get him to write. It has been impossible to sneak to him to-day. With him and you on my side, I think the old gentleman will not hold out." Mr. Ogilby moved away, but the speakers seemed com- ing in his direction.  "Now, Ally, about this business with Ogilby." Her soft voice, in which there was a touch of sadness, was heard in reply,- "I entreat you to say no more on that subject." Mr. Ogilby for a moment found it difficult to command himself--then he coughed, and finally walked so close to the musicians that the light which streamed from the win- dows of the Mess Hall could not fail of making him suffi- ciently visible, and warning passers-by of his proximity.   WALBTER OGILBY.         389 So, her cousin was already calling her to account for the attentions she had received from him, and she, as well as himself, was to be made a sufferer. With this addi- tional source of disquietude, it was a relief to him to ob- serve at length the departure of the band, and then the general turning of the detached groups towards t heir ren- dezvous in the parlor of the Mess Hall. Captain Carter and Lieutenant Barton were to accom- pany the party in the barge across the river; but the "permit " which the other young military gentlemen had received extended only as far as a walk to the end of the dock. At that place, therefore, was the final leave-taking. 'Here many a tender, many a gallant thing was said-- many a line of poetry whispered. Here many a declara- tion was put forth that " the day had been the most charm- ing, the most inspiring, the most unutterably delightful that had ever gladdened the hearts of poor, solitary, op- pressed young mortals--a day to be registered among the rose-colored days of one's life I Such a day as, alas! could hardly be hoped for on earth again I All was rapture and regret. Pretty lips praised, and promised to remember all that had contributed to their enjoyment-and there had been so much! Even the couplet with which one of the young cadets had prepared a contribution he was medita- ting for Miss Anne Eliza's album,-- "While Wyllys on his bugle toots The steam-boat up the river shoots," was pronounced worthy to be treasured up for its elegant simplicity; and there were some of the party who, when seated in the fine commodious barge and pulled from the shoee, actually felt as if they were -leaving an enclhanted land behind them. Gertrude was not of these. She kept up an animated 33*  &#xD;<pb n="390-391" xml:id="VAC7016-00000196"/> 390       WALTER OaILBY. conversation with Captain Carter, perhaps that the silence of some of the party might not be remarked,-possibly that the retrospect of all that had occurred during the day might not force itself upon her. The mist had now increased to a thick fog, and the only light visible was that thrown from the lanterns of the little sloops, which might be dimly discovered here and there amid the gloom.  There were occasional pretty screams of timidity from one and another of the ladies, when the barge would approach, as they thought, too near the vessels, and many and earnest were the entreaties that the soldiers who rowed would be particularly careful to avoid a collision. Mr. Halford was by the side of Alice, and was assidu- ous in his endeavors to shield her from the dampness and chilliness of the evening. He perceived that she was in- disposed for conversation, and believing that he under- stood the reason, he refrained from any observation- that would demand a reply. After a time, however, his solici- tude compelled him to break the silence with,-- "I am afraid you are uncomfortable. Are any of the baskets at hand, that I may find something to throw around you?" "No, I thank you-I am doing very well," she replied, abstractedly-then, as if forgetting the words she had just uttered, she said, "How cold and gloomy it has grown I Who would have dreamed of such a termination to a day so bright and promising?" There was a deep-drawn sigh from some one near her. Mr. Halford hastened to reply,- "The, sunshine of to-morrow will chase away the mists, and then all will be bright and cheerful again."  "Perhaps so," said Alice, thoughtfully, and she spoke no more until they reached the opposite shore.   i        WALTER OGILBY.        391 The carriages were already at the appointed spot, await- ing the arrival of the party. Alice had determined in her own mind her course of conduct. She was not of a resentful disposition--she had no wish to punish Mr. Ogilby for his neglect during the day, but she was not wanting in self-respect and proper pride. "He did not avail himself," thought she, "of the oppor- tunity I gave him of walking with me this afternoon, when I could have made my explanation more complete. He has reasons for his conductswhich I cannot understand. I    A man of sense or principle would never retain anger so many hours, if indeed he would feel it at all for such a mere trifling breach of politeness as I was forced into. There is some mystery which I cannot fathom. He will, of course, feel bound in courtesy to renew his request to me, to allow him to drive me in returning-but there cannot be a doubt that he would prefer I should decline it. Ile has avoided me ever since we reached the Mess Hall-it would unquestionably be irksome to him to be compelled to a tete-a-tete with me now. After a time he will be con- vinced perhaps that I have not deserved such treatment, and then how bitterly will he reproach himself " Ally had a perfect conviction that Mr. Ogilby could not- continue to endure this state of estrangement-that he would ere long seek an explanation, for the sake of his own peace of mind; she was, therefore, although grieved and unhappy, less utterly wretched than he, to whom the future was all gloom. It was difficult amid the fog to discover the whereabout of the different equipages, and the voices of the gentlemen were soon intermingled as they called for their respective servants. "Halloo, Jake I where are you?"  &#xD;<pb n="392-393" xml:id="VAC7016-00000197"/> 392       WALTER OGILBY. "Here, massa!" was the somewhat surly response of the old negro. "Ah, Patrick I are you there?" "Yes, your honor--and here, your honor," said the man, coming the length of his reins, " is a bundle of shawls that madam sent for the ladies as the evening was growing so cold and damp." Ally had kept close to her aunt, and they were standing beside the Milbank carriage when Mr. Ogilby approached them. The light of the lamps enabled him to see her where she stood. He drew near, and endeavored to ad- dress her in his usual tone. "Am I not to have the pleasure of your company, Miss Morton. in our drive home?"   His manner, in spite of himself, was slightly constrained. "I think. I believe," said Alice, who, distinctly as she had planned her answer, now found herself hesitating. "Aunt, don't you think it would be best for me to ride in the close carriage as the weather has changed so?" "My carriage can be made perfectly close," said Mr. Ogilby, "and I may be able to induce one of the Miss Westbrooks also to oblige me by taking a seat in it." Alice felt the awkwardness of having assumed that Mr. Ogilby was to have driven her alone in his gig, but she was spared the necessity of finding any further excuse by her Aunt's replying with alacrity,- "Yes, my dear, to be sure you had better ride with your uncle and me. Mr. Walter may have any other two that he likes, but you had better come with us." Mr; Ogilby had pictured to himself the embarrassment of his position should he be thrown into the company of Miss Morton, without the presence of a third person. IHe had tried to persuade himself that he should rejoice being spared the temptation of a drive with her alone, in which   , ' WALTER OGILBY.      393 he might, against his better resolutions, be led to make known to her feelings which, as a man of honor, he was now bound to hide in the most secret recesses of his heart -or at least, any intentional disclosure of which, he was of all things to avoid. Yet, in spite of all his philosophy, it was with an addi- tional pang that he observed her readiness, indeed her ap- parent anxiety, to avoid his society. He confessed to him- self that she acted rightly, yet he was disappointed. To convince her, however, that no feeling of resentment ex- isted towards her, he unfolded the package his mother had sent by Patrick. "' Will you allow me," he said, "'to offer you one of these shawls? I think I heard you complain of chilliness while we were on the water." He could not distinguish the words of her reply, but Mrs. Ellsworth made herself sufficiently intelligible by her eager appropriation of the proffered wrappings. "I am sure it's wery good in your mother to think of us. I never once dreamed, for my part, of its turnin' round so cold and miserable as this,-and I'll just take the shawls, for my own isn't so wery thick, and will send them home by Jake to-morrow, unless it would be just as easy for your man to stop and get them when he goes up to the post- bffus. Come, Ally-come, all the rest of you that's to ride with me. I suppose three or four of you is to go with Mr. Walter and Teuny Benthouse, somehow or other." Gertrude, although still engaged in playing the agree- able to Captain Carter, had been watchfully holding her- self in readiness for any proffered civility from Mr. Ogilby. She had persuaded herself that the seat in his gig, declined by Alice, would be tendered to her. She thought he would wish to talk with her to learn more:from her on the sub- ject nearest his heart. She was prepared to add much in i   &#xD;<pb n="394-395" xml:id="VAC7016-00000198"/> 394       WALTER OGILBYI confirmation of what she had already advanced. "For, after all," argued she to herself, "though it is a bitter pill just now, it will be for his own good in the end. Ally does not care for him, and if she should marry him it will be only for his position and fortune, or because his mother and sisters persuaded her into it. He would be perfectly wretched to find out, when too late, how little she returns his own desperate love. Besides that, he would not suit her. Ally has always been petted and given up to, and made to think herself perfection. As for Walter Ogilby, he has been so accustomed to being master at home, that, let him love his wife as he might, he would want to be her master, and he would expect her to bow down to him and never have an opinion of her own,--a thing which Ally could by no means submit to, for she has a vast deal of spirit and independence, gentle as she seems. To my mind there is no question that she prefers John Peter; or, if she does not now, she soon will, when she finds that Walter Ogilby is out of the question. He will make her much the best husband of the two, for he worships the very ground she treads upon. She can govern him, and father and mother into the bargain, and that will please and satisfy her, for Ally likes to feel that she is important to other people, and has influence with them. I have pro- vided well for her happiness at any rate." Gertrude had not time to ask herself how much more docile and submissive a wife she was likely to make to Mr. Ogilby than her cousin, ere she was thrown into a high fit of displeasure by the voice of her brother Cornelius as he called,- "See here, Waler I Walter Ogilbyl Take me with you, won't you, and let me drive Gray Bird? I'll bet you we will go up in an hour and a quarter at the furthest. Let Jemmy ride withbour Jake, can't you?"   WALTER OGILBY         395 "Yes, certainly; jump in," said Mr. Ogilby, who was not sorry to be spared the necessity of entertaining a more exacting companion. "Jemmy can sit beside Patrick in the carriage."  In vain his sister called, "Cornelius, for shame 1 Why do you force yourself upon Mr. Ogilby in this manner?" 'He only replied, laughing,- "Because we like each other, and like to be together- don't we, Walter?" Mr. Ogilby assented; but he began to think he had been too precipitate, when Cornelius, lowering his voice, re- marked 'as they drove off,-- "Gitty is always so contrary. She never cares wlether I am suited or not,-all she thinks of is herself. Well, it is one comfort that *fhall have a sister one of these days, and I hope it won't be long first, that is always obliging and kind, and that can put her own convenience out of the way for the sake of other people sometimes." A half-defined hope had been forming in the breast of Mr. Ogilby that, after all, things might not be so desperate as they seemed-that Gertrude might not have been fully informed, or that there might have been some misapprehen- sion on her part-some misinterpretation on his own-of  the words which he had overheard. The remark of Cor- nelius awake/ed him to the futility of such a hope. Even he, young and indiscreet as he was, had been informed how matters stoodf. "Is your brother to be married, that you speak of another sister?" he asked. ' Oh, yes, and to somebody that you like first-rate. But, by-the-by, you must not tell of it, though, I'm sure, I can't see why it should be kept a secret. However, mother told me never to speak of it, and particularly not to breathe a word or let on to Ally that I know, because it always vexes her to hear it talked about."  &#xD;<pb n="396-397" xml:id="VAC7016-00000199"/> 396       WALTER OGILBY. "Stop, my dear boy," said Mr. Ogilby, as soon as he could interrupt his young friend, "your mother intended, doubtless, to include me along with the rest of the world in this prohibition. But the secret is safe with me. Now, we will not talk; you must give all your attention to Gray Bird, if you wish him to carry us safely over these roads in the dark." And Mr. Ogilby continued wrapped in silence, scarcely heeding the chirping of the thousands of insects, the dis- tant hooting of the owl, nor yet any other sound of out- ward life, during their long dark drive, until he deposited his companion at Milbank. ur CH APTER XLVII. ON reaching home, Mr. Ogilby entered the house as quietly as possible that he might not disturb his mother. Her watchful ear, however, detected his step in the parlor, from which her bedroom opened. The door was partly unclosed and she called to him, "Is that you, my son?" "Yes, mother." "Have you had a pleasant day?"It was a moment before he replied,- "The day was very pleasant, and the sail down delight- ful; after that there was, of course, a great deal to be seen and heard. How is Jessie?" "Much better; she has had a very comfortable day." Then to herself: "He is disappointed; he has been sur- rounded with a crowd all the time. Did you come alone?" she inquired aloud. "No; Cornelius came with me."   WALTER OGILBY.        397 "Another disappointment," thought the mother. "You will find some refieshment onL the sideboard in the dining-room."         '  e "Thank you, mother, I do not wish any. Good-night." "Poor fellow! Things have not gone right. It was hardly to have been expected that, on an excursion like this, they would have had a moment to themselves. He must go to bed and sleep off his vexation." But the slow, measured tread, which she heard hour after hour over her head, told too plainly that her son was not sleeping off his vexation. It was the step of one who has a heavy weight upon his heart. "Something se- rious must have occurred," said she, as she lay listening, hoping for a cessation of the sounds-for a quiet that would indicate his having sought repose. All was at length still, and the tender mother fell asleep, wondering what could -1  have happened thus to disturb her son's tranquillity. She would not allow the bell to be rung for prayers on the fol- lowing morning for fear of awakening him; but, to her surprise, he entered the library while they were all taking their places. A look showed her that he had not slept; but she judged it best to forbear all comment or inquiry. She could hardly preserve her serenity, however, while she listened to his tones as he read the service, so changed were they from their ordinary depth and richness. She did not press him to eat, for she knew that there are times when importunity or even observation are most grievous to be borne. She felt sure that whatever might be the nature of his trouble, he would at the proper time ask her counsel or her sympathy, and she would not be forward to press them upon him at this moment. After breakfast Walter took his gun, and, as he was leaving the house, he called back to her, "Do you think, mother, it would be of service to Jessie to take a drive 34   &#xD;<pb n="398-399" xml:id="VAC7016-00000200"/> 398       WALTER O GILBY. this afternoon? If so, I will return in time to accompany you." Thinking he might be purposing to drive to Mil- bank, his mother accepted the suggestion; but when he returned from his long stroll, looking so worn and harassed -when she observed how little he ate, and with what, ain effort he sustained his part in the conversation, she was tempted to urge him to give up all occasion of further fatigue until he had taken some repose. "Only that I know the sight of her will brighten and cheer him at once," she said; and yet she had her mis- givings. He did not drive towards Milbank, however, but pro- ceeded in the opposite direction; and, having gone a few miles, he again turned towards home, under the pretext that Jessie must not be kept out in the air too long. His mother was glad to see him retire to his own, room immne- diately after tea. "I trust your brother has gone to bed," said she to6 Agnes. "He certainly is not well; but he knows best what to take. Men never like to be worried with ques- tions or remarks, so we will .not annoy him, my dear, by asking him how lie feels." In the course of the evening Mrs. Ogilby overheard a little dialogue in the back hall, which confirmed her fears that something was seriously amiss with her son. "Here, yol Jem, what is Mr. Walter's gun standing there for till this late hour?" The voice was that of the middle-aged servant-woman, who took a general charge of the household. "An't plase you, Misthress Martin,' responded a strong Kilkenny accent, "it isn't standing the gun is at all; it's laning, and it's meself that set it there." "Well, what is it doing there, I should like to know?" "Nothing, the laste; it's as quiet as a lamb."   I WALTER OGIIBY.       399 "Jemmy McCabe, you'd better not aggravate me. Why ain't that gun put into its place? I ask you." "Becase Mr. Walter bid me clane it." "Well, have you done it?" "' No; it didn't naad it., Sorrow a bit of powder's been in it the day." "How dare you use sich a word when you are talking to me, you little blasphemlious vagabone??' said Mrs. Mar- tin, waxing wroth. "Sorrow a bit!" "What shall I say, then? Is it 'divil a bit' you'd have 2Il me say?"say "Good sakes alive! Why, worse and worse! Who ever, heard of such an audacious, little, born-natural repro- bate? Jenmmy McCabe, you that was picked up out of the dirt and the mire, as one may say, and clothed and fed by kind benevolence, and taught reading, writing, piety, and so forth, and now to be practising profanity by using such words!" "Faith! I heard Mr. Walter say the same." "Well, now, I'm beat. I wonder what you'll say next, your little sarpent.7" "Why, now, Misthress Martin," said Jemmy, pretending to whimper, though he was laughing out of the corner of the eye that was farthest from the housekeeper, " do you disremember the chapter that Mr. Walter was reading only three days ago, in the good book too, where it said, 'You are of your father, the divil'? I was wondering all the. time what made Mr. Walter look straight at you when he said it, and I felt very bad for you, sure. And now I get- called names for taking after Mr. Walter and being sorry for you." "Well, Jemmy," said Mrs. Martin, softening, "you needn't cry. I dare say you didn't mean any harm; only you mustn't think because that old wicked one is spoken  &#xD;<pb n="400-401" xml:id="VAC7016-00000201"/> 400       -WALTERR 0OGfBY.  of in the Bible that you've any right to be taking his name  in vain. But I guess you must be mistaken about Mr. Walter's gun not wanting cleaning." "Then jist look in the bird-bag, if you plase," said Jemmy, with mild politeness,. " and see if there's been ever a feather in it to-day. And if you'd seen Mr. Walter as I  seen him, you'd ha' thought may-be it wasn't for shooting  birds he was up in the woods to-day, Mrs. Martin." "What was it for, then?" asked the good woman, her  curiosity getting the better of her discretion.  "That's more nor I can tell. But when I was up in  there a little piece, to look if there was any wild raspber-  ries, after I'd carried the things you sent me with over to old Ferguson, there way off, sitting on a bank, or a stone, or something under a big tree, who should I see but Mr. Walter? He had his cheek in his hand just this way, and his head bowed over looking on the ground as if he'd lost every friend he had in this blessed world. And all the birds of the air might have perched on the top of his gun, and I'll be bound he'd never know it." "Now, Jemmy," said the housekeeper with sudden recol- lection, "there's one thing I must tell you. You are not to open your bead to any living soul about anything like this, and you are not to go spying about and making your observations upon your betters-it isn't your place to do it." "Mustn't I never answer questions when they are asked?" said the boy, mischievously. "No, never; unless it's to Mrs. Ogilby, or myself, or some other discreet person. And now, just put that gun in the rack, a  nr  the i    a th ht  ch and hang up the ird-bag ad the shot-pouch and pow- der-flask-and then go and sweep off the back piazza where Miss Agnes has been fixing her geraniumils, for Mr. Walter always likes to walk there the first thing in the morning." I/   WALTER OGI'LBY      i  401 Mrs. Ogilby was greatly disturbed by what she had thus overheard. Her son was then really unhappy I Something more than a slight disappointment, or even a lover's quar- rel, must have occurred. As to the latter, she rejected the idea at once. He and Alice were both so considerate, so superior to childish caprices. Yet, again, when young people are very much in love they are apt to be sensitive, suspicious, unreasonable. Walter had never been seriously in love before-he might have been too exacting. This may have occasioned some little misunderstanding which he had taken too much to heart. She would ask no questions. She would wait patiently a day or two. Time and reflection would undoubtedly bring matters right be- tween them. The following morning she was glad to hear after break- fast the order given to saddle Fingal. He was not to take the customary ride to the post-office, for Jemmy had been despatched there at an early hour. "La nuit porte conseil," said the mother to herself. "Doubtless a call at Milbank is now in contemplation." It was with a feeling of disappointment that she heard the inquiry of her son as he was about to depart,- "Have you any commands for Waldorf?" "Only our love, and our hope of bringing Jessie -to visit them ere long." Oh, brother!" cried Jessie, in a plaintive tone, "won't you drive up to Milbank and bring Miss Morton to see me, instead of going to Waldorf? I know I should feel quite well if she were here. I got better the moment she came on Sunday." He did not look at her as he replied gently,- "I cannot go to-day, darling. Perhaps Christina will ride over and see you." "Christina is not Miss Morton," said Jessie, sorrowfully. 34*  &#xD;<pb n="402-403" xml:id="VAC7016-00000202"/> 402       WALTER OGILBY. "May I send Michael up with a note, then, to ask her to come?" "No, my dear,- I think not." And without waiting for further importunity, he mounted his horse and rode away. "How strange brother is!" said Jessie, almost crying. "He used always to try to gratify me." Her mother soothed her with promises of seeing her   ! favorite soon, a promise that she was persuaded a few days ! would see fulfilled. Mr. Ogilby did not return home until nearly dark. "Did you dine at Waldorf?" .asked his mother. "I was there a part of the time," he replied evasively. "There was a gentleman there from the city for a visit of  a day or two, and Mr. Van Ness is sick-they are afraid their friend will have a dull time. I forgot to tell you, mother," said he, hurrying to another subject, " that Mrs. Adriance is at her father's.- I suppose you and Agnes will call to see her soon." "Certainly. We know of Mrs. Adriance's arrival. The doctor mentioned it yesterday in his visit; and Cornelius, who was here this afternoon, told us the family were all taking tea with his mother." "Are they all well at Milbank?" asked Mr. Ogilby after a short- silence. "Yes; that is---- "Oh, no, mamma l" interposed Jessie; " don't you know he said that his Cousin Ally had had a bad headache these two days, and that his mother wanted her to go to bed and take care of herself, for she was afraid she was getting a nervous fever?" Mr. Ogilby quitted the room without speaking. His mother could bear the: suspense no longer. She waited only to see Jessie comfortably arranged for the night, with Agnes seated beside her bed talking her to   WAL TER OGILBYI       403 sleep, ere she stole softly to the library where she knew her son was sittipg. There was no lamp in the apartment, but the stars were out and their soft light was sufficient to make the objects in the room distinctly visible. Walter was seated at the window, his head leaning upon his hand in an attitude of the deepest thought. He did not at first notice his mother's approach, but as she drew near and laid her hand upon his head -he started, took her hand and pressed /it-then rose and wheeled an arm-chair for her quite close to his own, Which he resumed without speaking. CHAPTE R    XLVIII. IT was a delicate matter for Mrs. Ogilby to approach the subject so near her heart; nevertheless she resolved not to ie6 deterred. She commenced, however, with the utmost caution. "The doctor probably thinks Jessie requires no more of his attendance, as he has not been here to-day. Did you not say you saw him this morning in your ride?" "Yes,-just beyond Colonel Roosevelt's on my way to Waldorf I met him."' "Did he say anything about Miss Morton's indisposi- tion?' "No; his thoughts seemed quite occupied with the ar- rival of his grandchildren, and with their improvement since he last saw them. He did not allude to any other subject." "Perhaps you made no inquiry, and if so, it might not occur to him to give you the information."   &#xD;<pb n="404-405" xml:id="VAC7016-00000203"/> 404       WALTER OGILBE             - "Probably not." There was a long pause. "I think we had better call at Milbankx in the morning," said his mother, at length, " and see if anything serious is the matter. " "Yes, by' all means, mother. I wish you and Agnes would go as early as possible." "And will you not accompany us?" "No, mother ; I cannot go there at present." "Walter, my son-tell me-something has happened. I see you are unhappy. Do you go Ino more to Milbank?" "Not with the same object I have had lately," replied he in a voice of forced calmness. "Miss Morton is engaged -to her cousin." "Engaged! And to John Peter! Inmpossible. " "So I should have said until the very moment of our arrival at West Point on that unfortunate day. You can- not be more unprepared for the truth than I was.1" "Are you quite sure there is not some mistake? Have you not been misinformed? Did Miss Morton tell you so herself?"' "Not exactly in words. Her actions, and still more his actions, spoke the fact plainly enough. There was no pos- sible room for doubt, even if, in answer to my inquiry, his sister had not confirmed that which was of itself sufficiently evident. She informed me that for two years they had been waiting anxiously for Mr. Morton's consent to their union; and this it seems they have obtained quite recently. The father would not heretofore sanction the young man's addresses, because he disliked his profession." "From any other member of the family this would seem conclusive. But, my dear son, we know that Gertrude has never been governed' by strict principle. I can imagine, too, a motive for her wish to separate y'ou and her cousin. Even were it otherwise, it would be easier for me to believe   WALTER OGILBYF.         405 that she has deceived you, than that Miss Morton, so pure, so truthful, so uprighlt as she seems, could- all this time have been acting a part." "I will tell you all that has taken place, mother, and you shall then judge whether there can be any room for doubt. In the long, miserable hours I have passed these last two days, I have, with the exception of my short call at Wal- dorf, been by myself. I have revolved in my own mind, again and again, every circumstance of our acquaintance, and my opinion is now settled in the matter. Before giv- ing you that, however, let me tell you everything that has occurred." Walter then related to his mother all that passed, from the setting out of the party for West Point in the morning, until his parting with Alice at Coldspring in the evening, omitting no circumstance, not even the remarks of Cor- nelius upon the information given him by his miother. "There is one thing that I blame myself for," said he, observing that his mother did not immediately reply, " and that is, my coldness, I fear I ouoght to say, my harshness of manner towards her when I first learned the disappoint- ment of my hopes-those hopes upon which I had built all the happiness of my future life; for, mother, I have loved Miss Morton as few men ever loved. From the first mo- nlent I saw her, nay, even before I saw her, when my ear  X first caught the sound of her merry laugh, I felt a thrill, -such as I had never felt before. Then the circumstances under which we met, together with the various little inci- dents that occurred during the time we were thrown to- gether at Mrs. Van Tine's, all showed her character in a light so different from that of young ladies in general-so tender to her father, so forgetful of herself-so artless-so retiring, yet with strch charming grace and humor. I can- hot explain it, but I was taken captive at once: it seemed  &#xD;<pb n="406-407" xml:id="VAC7016-00000204"/> 406       WALTER OGILBY. as if I had known her for a lifetime, and had been loving her with all the devotion that could be given to an earthly object. And now to lose her! Oh, mother!" starting up, "can I give her up? Must I --"He did not complete the sentence, but continued pacing the floor for a time, until, having mastered his emotion, he again seated himself. "Had you no opportunity of satisfying yourself sooner whether it would be possible for her to return your attach- ment?" "1 delayed speaking at first from a fear of being too pre- cipitate. But there was still another reason why I curbed miy own impatience as much as it was possible; and that leads me to a subject upon which I have never spoken be- fore. I would not wound your feelings, dearest mother and you will forgive me if I allude to times and events that may harrow up your feelings. Yet nothing I well know can be harder for you to bear than the sorrow and disap- pointment your son is suffering, and the narration I have to give you is necessary in order to explain whyI delayed as I did making my declaration to Miss Morton." Walter went on to recount to his mother all that had passed between his father and himself on that night when the letter containing the last appeal to his uncle was written. "That admonition," said he, "of my dying father, 'Never interfere with the rights of another,' has been ever present with me. Perhaps it has prevented my forming an attachment earlier. Every feeling of my heart seems to have been reserved, to be treasured up in this one object. Still I guarded myself carefully. I put all the constraint possible upon my feelings that I might not love irrevocably, unconquerably. I watched her, and 11 around her, to find if there was by any possibility a ri al. Her aunt occasionally made allusions to expectations which she   WALTER OGILBY.        407 seemed to have formed for her son, but I thought they ap- peared distasteful and annoying to Alice-to Miss Morton. I have never hid my love-I wished her to see it, trusting to her truth and generosity to discourage if she could not  return it. If there was sometimes a reserve that disap- pointed me, an appareht backwardness to understand what I ,wished to convey, I attributed it only to maidenly modesty. Her manner was certainly not such as to for- bid all hope. "I brought her a letter you may remember from the post- office, which I knew by the writing and post-mark to be from Ellsworth. I was for a little while exceedingly troubled and jealous on account of it, but her open, frank  manner as she spoke with Gertrude in my presence upon the contents of it, soon reassured me. Then, on the day she passed here, I saw more to raise my hopes. I think, without being vainer than other men, I had a right to be- lieve my attentions were not disagreeable to her on that day." "Certainly, my dear son, you were justified in such a belief. . I felt convinced that she loved you-not perhaps with the strength of your devotion to her " "No, mother," said he, interrupting her, "that I did not expect. I had to win her. She had not fallen in love with me from the first. On the contrary, I bad to combat with a feeling of annoyance amounting almost to distaste which had grown out of some vexatious circumstances at- tending our first meeting. I saw this, and was fully aware by how slow degrees I was making my way. But I thought she was growing to love me, and that such was her enthusiastic nature, she would at length return my affection in the same degree that she received it. And mother," said he, in an accent of deep feeling, " this is now the bitterest thought of all. I fear I succeeded in inspiring  &#xD;<pb n="408-409" xml:id="VAC7016-00000205"/> 408       WALTER OGILBY. her with a feeling that may-that must-cause her great unhappiness." "But if she were all this time engaged to her cousin, how could she permit herself to think of you with interest? What right had she to be captivated with your atten- tions? If she had been receiving the addresses of one man for two years, she was not such a novice as to be blind to the devotion of another. She must have known what your looks and manner meant, even if no word had been spoken, and it was the height of cruelty-it was unworthy and unprincipled to delude you in this way." "Yes, if she did it designedly, or even carelessly-if she were aware of the nature of her own feeling," said Mr. Ogilby, speaking with difficulty. "But we must consider, mother, how she has been situated at her uncle's. The want of kindness, of sympathy, of consideration to which she was at times subjected,-made her turn with the greater eagerness to those who, she knew, understood and appre- ciated her. She may not-she probably did not--discover that her sentiments towards me were different from those she felt for you and Agnes. What explanation she in- tended to make me on that afternoon when we are at the Academy at West Point, I cannot tell. I repulsed her. I could not bear to hear her going over the history of her engagement with her cousin. It could serve neither as explanation nor apology. I could not allow her to humble herself by attempting an exculpation. I was stunned, crushed, and all she could say would not have lessened the anguish. I could not have listened, or have comprehended. Indeed, throughout the day, I believe I was hardly myself." "It is painful to think ill of one whom we have so much loved and approved. I should be glad to exonerate Miss Morton from blame; yet I find it difficult to understand how, seeing as she must have done, that your heart was   WALTER  OGILBY.        409 devoted to her, it did not occur to her what misery and disappointment she was preparing for you." ' "So I said to myself-so I reasoned, if I could be said to have reasoned during those first wretched hours. I allowed myself to think she had acted heartlessly, with a total disregard of all honor and truth. But when I saw the expression of her countenance as I declined to receive her offered explanation, when I witnessed the unhappiness that she was, throughout the remainder of the day, en- deavoring to struggle against or to conceal, I could not but be convinced that it had been unwittingly, innocently that she had destroyed nmy peace, and perhaps, for a tinme, her own. You must forgive her, mother, as I do. She will have enough to bear without losing your friendship. From Ellsworth's manner to me, and from what I was so unfor- tunate as to overhear of their conversation; it is evident that he had been informed of my attentions and resented them. I cannot blame him. He is high-spirited and pas- sionately in love-and although he might have taken it for granted that I was ignorant of the claims he has so stu- diously kept secret, yet it is natural he should wish to throw the blame on me rather than on her." "You have nothing to reproach yourself with, my son,"' said his mother, tenderly. "I shall strive to avoid all occasion of self-reproach in future," said he, mournfully. "My duty is plain before me. I must see her no more, until I can bear, to look upon her and think of her as belonging to another. I must strive to tear out the passion which seems woven into the very fibres of my heart-for to indulge it now would be both sin and folly. Doubtless, dear mother," said he, rising as he spoke and again taking her hand tenderly, "doubtless resignation will come in the course of time. You will praySTfr me that it may. The world 35  &#xD;<pb n="410-411" xml:id="VAC7016-00000206"/> "O       IWALTER OGILBY. looks very dark before mue now, but I must fix my gaze only the mlore steadfastly upon the glories that are bevond -upon that land where is neither darkness nor sorrow for- ever.  The mother's words of comfort, her embrace and bless- ing, closed this long and painful conference, which had been protracted far into the watches of the night. ,Each felt that long and said must be the time ere their home could again be smiling and cheerful as of late it had been. CHAPTER XLIX. MRS. OGILBY fulfilled her intention of calling at Mil- bank on the following day. There was no one at home but the mistress of the mansion. Gertrude and her cousins, as she was informed, " had gone to Cousin Wan- derwoort's to plan about their bridesmaids' dresses. "Ally had not cared to go-she had not been well," her aunt added, "and the doctor had just carried her off to wisit Aunt Lany and Mrs. Adriance, and to amuse her- self with the children." "Cornelius told us that Miss Morton had been indis- posed," said Mrs. Ogilby. "Yes-the doctor thinks she ran about and, over- did a little, that day, at West Point. I didn't see that she exerted herself more than the rest of us, but the weather is gettin' warm, and perhaps she feels it. Ally will never own that anything is the matter with her, but yesterday she had fairly to give up and go to bed. The doctor came and gave her a little somethin' to take, and laughed and chatted with her awhile, till he put her in   iWALTER OGILBY .        4" better spirits. Not but what it is quite natural she should feel a little low-spirited just now-it will be quite a differ- ent story next week, I'll warrant." Mrs. Ogilby would not inquire what particular event was to work this wonderful charm, bIut without waiting to be questioned, the good lady went on. "My son will be up early in the week with some of his friends, and then we are to have all the pleasant doin's and gay times that we've been a puttin' off. Mr. Halford won't be here a great while longer. lie has got to go with the girls to make their wisit to Colonel Westhrook's at Nine Pardner's, and after that he is engaged to go and meet a party of friends at the Springs. We shall miss hm wery much, he is so pleasant and obligin'. Why, this wery mornin', he wouldn't go with the others, but stayed here to drive me up to the doctor's, when I go for Ally." From Milbank Mrs. Ogilby proceeded to the doctor's to call on the newly arrived friends. It was a relief to be spared a second time the meeting with Miss Morton, who had not yet reached there after her long round-a-bout drive with the doctor. Although resolv-ed to exercise the forgiving spirit en- joined upon her by her son, Mrs. Ogilby could not exon- erate Alice in all that had taken place. She might not, to be sure, have invited his attentions, yet she had ac- cepted themu, and that was of itself encouragrement. Mrs. Ogilby could not think her quite fiee from all suspicion that in' so doing she was preparing misery for years at least, to a trusting and devoted heart. "But, poor young thing! she had no mother to advise her," was the result of all her cogitations and conjectures upon the subject. "We must not judge her too harshy. She needs our sympathy perhaps more thanl our resentment."  And with this conclusion came the resolution to meet Alice in  &#xD;<pb n="412-413" xml:id="VAC7016-00000207"/> "2       WAL TER OGILB Y. such a manner that the world at least should suspect no e estrangement between them. A few days more passed on at Ferndale. No allusion was made to the subject uppermost in the hearts of the mother and son. Mr. Ogrilby remained for the most part at home, occupying himself with his books, the super- vision of his garden and grounds, the instruction of his sisters or his little pupils at the school, and in occasional visits to some of the old and poor people on the verge of the mountain, whom he had for years considered, his pen- sioners. His mother feared that disappointment might make him a recluse, and cast about for some occasion of diverting his thoughts. Cornelius had gone to visit a family of cousins some miles distant, and no communication had been held with Milbank since his departure. This total separation, this cessation of all intercourse, Mrs. Ogilby could see, was more than her son could bear. It preyed upon him and kept him in a state of feverish restlessness. She ven- tured to suggest that the usual courtesies, which as a stranger he had a right to expect, had not been extended to Mr. Halford. Walter caught at the idea. "Iwiil write and invite him to dine with us on Tuesday," he said. "It is a little singular, however, that he has not called before this." The note was despatched and received for answer a formal excuse quite unlike the kind wording of the invita- tionu-"Mr. Halford's compliments, and he would unfor- tunately be prevented by an enga gement, etc." Mr. Ogrilby was disappointed. He had hoped to hear something about Milbank. It could not have failed, he thought, that her name must have been mentioned--sorme indication, given from which he could have gathered whether she were becoming tranquil and happy.

With this he tried to be satisfied; yet he caught himself continually regrretting that Mr. tHalford lhad not accepted his invitation. It was towards evening that, wearied with his employ- ments, he strolled into the garden, hoping to find some- thing to cheat him into forgetfulness. lie stood for a time leaning on the framework that extended along the upper terrace. It was the spot where he had called the attention of Alice to his young gardener, on the evening of her first visit to Ferndale. The remembrance of his happiness at that time, made the contrast of the present still more bitter. the recalled her looks, her words, her light elas- tic step, her graceful, gay humor,-all that had made her so captivating. The hopes that were then just awakening in his breast, were they indeed over? Must he walk forward, hence- forth, on his path in life uncheered, alone? Yes, alone,- for her place, he felt, could never be usurped by another! It happened that Michael was again at work near the same spot. His master looked at hini as he was preparing the earth for transplanting, some exotics, and he was struck by the air of listless weariness which the movements of the young man exhibited. Instead of the life and alacrity which usually characterized his motions, it was now as if a heavy weight had been attached to the implement with which he was dressing the soil. After observing him for a few moments, Mr. Ogilby de- scended the steps and addressed him,- "You do not feel well this evening, Michael. Put aside your rake--these things can wait till to-morrow." The young man still went on, without looking up or turning his head to listen. 35*  &#xD;<pb n="414-415" xml:id="VAC7016-00000208"/> "4       WAI L TER OGIL B Y. "What is the matter?" asked Mr, Ogilby, kindly. "Have you been ailing long? You must not get sick. You should take something." "Nothing is the matter, sir,;" was the dejected reply; "nothing, at least, that medicine could help. I am only vexed with myself that I can't work as I used to, let me do my best. My strength seems quite gone."' "If nothing is the matter with your body, then you have something weighing upon your mind. Tell me what it is-perhaps I can help you in your trouble."' "Thank you kindly, sir," said Michael, applying him- self with renewed diligence to his labor; " but it's no use bothering other people with my troubles. Everybody has enough of their own to bear." "Those who have troubles of their own to bear, Michael, should be the most ready to feel for others, and, if possi- ble, to assist them. Is your mother ill again?" "No, sir; if it were not for the fretting, she'd be quite stout and well. But she takes my trouble harder, if any- thing, than. I do myself." "And is it a trouble that is past relief? Can a friend do nothing for you?" The young man looked up, and a sudden gleam shot across his countenance. "I will tell your honor," said he, "what has come across us,--my poor mother and myself,-for she will have it she's the cause of all. It's making bould," continued he, returning, in his eagerness and agitation, to something of his native brogue, "it's making bould to spake to ye of me own affairs, but since you bid me--" "Go on, Michael, let me hear the whole." "Well then, sir, you know AMary Carroll,-sure who's a better right, for didn't you pull that unlucky Tom, her brother, out of the creek last year? Well, I suppose   WAL TER OGIL B .       415 everybody knows that Barney Carroll, her father, is [  prouder and more set up than most of those that comes from the old country. He came here, like the rest of us, to try and earn a living, and as he had some education at home, he set up for a schoolmaster, you know, sir. He taught the evening school at the Factory for a good many winters, besides a day school for such as could pay. I went to him, and learned to read and write and cipher. My poor -mother, after my father's death, pinched and pared, and worked early and late, to keep me tidy and respectable, that I might learn and get on in the world. I was fond of books, and the old man seemed to have a great liking for me, and after your honor took me by the hand and gave me employment, and taught me gardening and a little botany, besides .lending me books of history and travels, why, he thought more and more of me. Two years ago, when you came back from abroad, sir, and found-how well things had gone in your absence, and gave me the cottage and bit of a garden for my mother, Barney Carroll told me, of his own accord, that hle could not have been better pleased if it had been his own son who'd met with such good luck. "Well, sir, I worked for love of my poor mother, and to pay her back what she had done for me; but there was anotherAI worked for with a lighter heart still, and that was Mary Carroll. We began by going to school together, and at first I looked up to her as the schoolmaster's daughter, and was shy enough; but we were the two smartest in the school, and kept together in our lessons, and sometimes said them to one another, which, I suppose, was whaJt first brought her to think of me, as I had done of her long and long before. So, sir, just so we kept on. We talked together of the time when I could ask her father's consent, but we both knew he had a strong pre-  &#xD;<pb n="416-417" xml:id="VAC7016-00000209"/> "6       WA4LTER OGILBY. judice a gainst my mother on account of her religion. I harve heard it said that he was once the same himself, but  that now he has turned Protestant ile lhas no toleration for anybody who does not change as he has done. He thinks the Church of England bad enough, and he would now and t-hen fling up to me that since your honor had taught me 'one new way, it was a pity you had not taught me the right one. But that "I did not mind. I knew I could depend upon Mary. Why, sir, since she grew up she never walked the length bof a perch with any other man except myself I And now, my mother beings in better health, with a home of her own, and all things going well with me, thanks to you r honor, I toullht I would speak to her father myself." "Well, what did he say? Did he refuse his consent?" "Not exactly-he just put me off. He said Mary might look for a better match; that she was good-looking and had a good education, and that he had never let her work in the Factory, but had sent her to Newhurg and had her tauglht the dress-maker's trade, which was cgen- teeler. And then he bragged how that his family in Ire- land had been respectable, and that he had always been looking to Mary to raise it in this country, where anybody could get to be the first, if they'd good luck. And then he talked about our sma ll beginnings-how that my poor mother long ago took in washing for a living, and all that. I told him that Mary and I had loved each other for years, and that I was now able to give her a house of her own, and all things comnfortable and respectable,-but still he would not say 'yes.' He kept harping on his idea that his daughter could marry so that she should keep company with the gentry, and that she was entitled to it, and so forth. He did not, to be sure, quite say 'no,'-but the most he would say was ' Wait till fall, young man, and then   WALTER  OGILBY.        4" we'll talk about the matter again., Mary's mother was on my side. She sees what such foolish pride is bringing the family to-the boys not allowed to work or earn a de- cent living and she encouraged Mary and me, that all things would come out right at last. "Well,sir, now comes the worst of it. Amongo the new hands that Squire Ellsworth brought up from New York in the spring, is the new dyer, an Englishman named Stolkes,-a great blustering, red-faced fellow, that dresses fine and talks big. He has a high salary, and I suppose he has read a good many books, but a more impudent, for- ward fellow I never beheld. Well, he cast his eyes upon my Mary, and what does he do but make up directly to her father, pretending to admire his learning and gentility, and presently he proposes to come and board at his house. Taking such characters as that to board is just one of old Carroll's genteel ways of getting a living! Stokes is that talking kind of-fellow that would please the old man-- they could sit down together and, ry up William Cobbett and Orator Hunt, and abuse the aristocracy of their own country at the very time they are doing all in their power to get the highest places in this. Well, sir, the upshot is, this man wants to marry Mary, and her father has com- manded her to put all thoughts of me out of her head,- as if she could do that, when we have thought of nothing else but each other for pretty nearly seven years!" "But will Mary think it her duty to submit to such an arbitrary command?" "She will hold out as long as she can, sir. But she has been brought up to be an obedient daughter, and may-be he'll work upon her at the last. Who knows?"And cross- ing his hands upon the top of the small rake which he still held, poor Michael drooped his head and looked the image of despair.  &#xD;<pb n="418-419" xml:id="VAC7016-00000210"/> "8       WALTER OGILB F "And how long have you known this discouraging state of things?" asked Mr. Ogilby, who began to reproach him- self for having been so unobservant of his dependant's trouble. "It was the day after you left for New York, sir, that just at evening I was going over to see Mary, as I always did, once or twice a week-not in the way of keeping com- pany, for that her father:wouldn't allow of, but to talk a. little with the old people and Mary anmongst. As I got near the door the old man stood upon the steps, but he did not bid me come in  I could not force the matter. ' How is Mary?' I said, much surprised at his way, though there had not been wanting people to give me a hint how matters were going. 'Mary is pretty well,' said he, stiffly-'she lhas gone to take a ride with Mr. Stokes, the gentleman that has charge of the dye-house,' ' And mother has gone with them,' said little Barney, who was sitting astride on the fence. His father jerked him down and began shaking him. I knew well enough what all this meant, but I walked away without another word for fear of aggravating him- but you'll believe, sir, I felt like death. The next day I walked up again beyond the Factory, thinking I'd speak to the old man, and have the matter settled somlehow, when I met the mother, and she told me how things stood-that Mary was just fretting herself sick about all that was goinig on. 'Shall I speak to the old man?' says I. ' Not for the world,' says she. ' He is just that quare person that won't bear to be crossed. He's taken the notion,' says she, ' to make a lady of his daughter, and if you try to see him now, Michael, may-be he'd turn round and do something rash, just to show that he would have his own way. I'll see you again,' says she,' and in the mean time, anything you have to say to each other you can send through me.' And that's just the way it has stood, sir, for the last ten days-not seeing    WALTER OGILBY.        419 each other, but knowing what is hanging over our heads. But I beg your pardon for tiring your patience, sir, with my long story. When a man is sorely tried, he is apt to be forgetful." "And did the mother," said Mr. Ogilby, " suggest no possible remedy? Could she think of no way in which her husband could be induced to act reasonbly and justly?" "Well, she once spoke-but it's no use troubling your honor. It might do no good." "If she thought my interference would not make mat- ters worse. Was that it, Michael?'" "Somi-ething like it, sir. She said that with all his talk about democracy and independence, the old man has a won- derful respect for the opinions of those above him--and that a gentleman of property-and education could do more with him in the way of persuading, than his own flesh and blood could." "If that is the case I will- certainly walk over there and have a conversation with hinm to-morrow morning. I have seen that Stokes, and a more coarse, unpleasant, ill-looking fellow, I have seldom met with. It is not to be thought of, that a girl like Mary should be sacrificed in this manner. I trust I shall be able to prevent it. Cheer up, Michael,- matters will come right, I doubt not. Carroll will not fly in the face, of the whole community by marrying his daughter to certain misery. A pman cannot do exactly as he likes even in this free country." Michael's countenance brightened-he even looked hope- ful, for he had unbounded faith in his master's powers of argument and persuasion, both of which, he felt sure, would be exerted to their utmost. "Poor Michael i" said Mr. Ogilby, as he walked slowly back to the house, " his case is a hard one-but his Mary is true-he knows that he possesses her love in all its integrity                   K  &#xD;<pb n="420-421" xml:id="VAC7016-00000211"/> 420       WALTER OGILBY. and fulness I And yet is that a consolation, now-that he fears she will be compelled to marry another? Will it lessen the pangs of separation? Alas! who can tell? But he shall not lose her. There is one way in which, unquestionably, old Carroll can be reached." CHAPTER L. ALICE, in the mean time, continued a prey to grief and perplexity. Her only hours of solitude and reflection were those silent ones when others were tasting the sweets of repose. Then only could she give way to feelings that through the day she was compelled to suppress; then only could she re- peat to herself again and again,--"What does it all mean? What has he seen in me? What has any one said of me to destroy his affection, perhaps his respect? Did he think I accepted and returned his love too readily?'" Yet no-he too was suffering. His looks, the tone of his voice in reply to her offer of an explanation, she could not forget. He had not ceased to love her. Whatever had come to destroy his confidence in her, he was as wretched- as herself. And now, what hope was there that she - should ever learn the cause of his estrangement? If he persisted in absenting himself, how was she to convince him that she had not deserved a withdrawal of his affection? At times she endeavored to call pride to her aid, and to say to herself, "Well, if he can bear it, he shall see that I can too.*     WALTER OGILBY.         421 But it would not do-she could neither feel nor feign indifference. There was no one to whom she could turn for sympathy, that balm so necessary to woman's heart; it is no wonder, therefore, that her cheek lost, day by day, something of its bloom, and her eye, of its brightness. She was willing that her aunt should attribute her lan- guor to over-fatigue, and she most thankfully accepted her recommendation, when she could, in truth, no longer de- cline it, " to keep quiet in bed, and sleep off all her bad feelin's. " But the quiet of her own room and the indulgence of tears were luxuries that could not last forever. The time came when she must rise and assume a cheerful demeanor. She must take care that no one should suspect the cause of her headache and nervousness. She must summon strength to reply-"Better, much better, I thank you," to all inquiries how she felt. She flattered herself that her efforts were effectual in hiding the truth from all around her-there were two per- sons, however, who were not- deceived. Mr. Halford, who was becoming a more and more deeply interested observer of all that concerned her, saw in her depression but the natural carrying out of what had been begun at West Point  The change in Mr. Ogilby's manner on that day had not been unremarked by him. He had seen from a distance the interview in the lobby of the Draw- ing Academy; and, although he had not heard the words that passed between them, he could not be mistaken in the pained expression of Alice's countenance as she turned from Mr. Ogilby and entered the apartment to join her cousin. That gentleman's subsequent avoidance of her, and now his continued absence, furnished him occasion for mueh specu- lation. 36  &#xD;<pb n="422-423" xml:id="VAC7016-00000212"/> 422       WALTER OGIL BY. All his chivalric feelings were aroused as he pondered upon the subject, and connected later events with Mr. Ogilby's inconsistency of manner, before his visit to the city. Even had there not been already in his heart a strong sentiment of tenderness towards Alice, the trial to which he saw her now subjected would have enlisted all his sensi- bilities in her behalf. He believed that Mr. Ogilby was trifling with her; and the respect and admiration with whichl he had at first regarded that young gentleman changed into contempt and dislike. "If I were her brother, or her cousin, or even a friend of long standing,--if I had any right to interfere as her chalm- pion, I would soon punish him as he deserves," repeated he often to himself. But as he was not her relative, and had no rights in the case, he did that which he felt at liberty to do,-he devoted himself with all his powers to entertaining her, and striving to dispel the cloud which he saw hanging over her. These attentions were a fresh inspiration to Gertrude. She, too, had divined that Alice was affected by something more than mere physical indisposition. She was not then, after all, so indifferent to Mr. Ogilby as would have been convenient for the carrying out of the young lady's plans. The interest that Mr. Halford manifested would be a great help in a new point of view, should John Peter or Alice be found impracticable as to her original scheme. Pinckney Halford,with his elegance and accomplishments, could hardly fail, she thought, of success, if he set himself in earnest, as he seemed to be doing, to console Alice under her disap- pointment. A woman's heart, she knew, never turns so readily to new vows of tenderness as when smarting from the coldness or the cruelty of a former lover. Thus, though like a good sister, Gitty was willing her brother should have the first chance, it was imuportant that ,}.        WALTER  OGT'LBY.       423 the way should be paved for Mr. Halford's success, in case John Peter showed no disposition to carry off the prize. As regarded the final issue she felt very little doubt. Things seemed to be working well towards an entire sep- aration of the two lovers. It was evident that Mr. Ogilby did not question the truth of the communication she had made to him; and she knew the sternness of his principles to be such that the conviction of Alice's being bound by promises to another, was as effectual a' barrier between them as if her faith had been plighted at the altar. She was therefore not surprised that he came no more to Milbank; and she began to hope that his continued ab- sence miglht embolden Mr. Halford, ere long, to take some decided steps towards advancing himself in her cousin's good graces. "It is highly important to lose no time," she said to herself, " not even the three or four days that must elapse before John Peter's arrival. Much may be accomplished even in that short time. But this being constantly sur- rounded by observant eyes is a great disadvantage-they must be left more to each other's society." This consideration it was that had prompted her to carry off her cousins, the two Miss Westbrooks, as we have seen, to spend a day at " the Orchards"-and after- wards to secure an invitation for them to prolong their visit till the following week. Mr. Halford's proposal to remain and accompany her mother to the doctor's, on the afternoon of that day, came in aid of her plan. He would thus be left to entertain Alice, and devote himself to her, until Monday. '"Then John Peter will return. He must work the harder, like a good soldier, if he finds he has lost ground; but it will not do to let slip a contingency." Gertrude said this to herself; yet she had at the same  &#xD;<pb n="424-425" xml:id="VAC7016-00000213"/> 424       WALTER OGILBY. time a conviction that if Mr. Halford's position became quite assured in Alice's favor, she should discover that, after all, her brother was perfectly indifferent in the matter. Satisfied with her tactics, she departed to Cousin Vander- voort's, and left Alice to make her visit to the Hardenbergs. It was a great pleasure to Ally to be in the domestic circle at the good doctor's. There was so much warm kindliness; so much of disinterested regard for the happi- ness of others.; so much good sense in the manner of view- ing and appreciating things,-so much, in short, that was like her own home, that she insensibly began ere long to feel more cheerful and, as a matter of course, more hope- ful than she had done for the last three days. She was fond of children; and Mrs. Adriance's little group, of whom their grandfather might well be proud, from the well-grown boy of eight to the fine fair baby of six months, were sources of amusement to her, or subjects for her caresses and tenderness. Altogether the day was wearing away in tolerable comfort, when her aunt and Mr. Halford arrived, and they were speedily followed by Mr. Teunis and his sister, in their usual flow of cheerful spirits. "Ah I how are you? how are you?" cried the doctor. "Still able to be stirring after your famous expedition on Tuesday? Well, that is wonderful! There is nothing to swell the doctor's list like one of these pleasure parties." "To be sure, that is wery true," said Aunt Aulchy, plain- tively. "I haven't felt well myself since that day; but I have not said much about it, because it wouldn't be con- wenient just now for me to give up." "It is a comfort you look so well, however," said the doctor. "But there are some, I am happy to say, who do not present any such deceitful appearances. And I   WALTER OGLBY.        425 was going to remark, that if there should ever come a par- ticularly horrid, healthy season in this region, I should prescribe at once a pleasure trip to West Point, to set business going again. Here's our little niece has had to keep her bed these two days-and yesterday I met Ogilby down by Colonel Roosevelt's looking like a ghost I If I had not been afraid it would seem like fishing for a patient, I should have asked him to let me feel his pulse." He glanced at Ally, whose color mounted to the roots of her hair with sudden agitation, then subsided, and left her paler than before. "Perhaps he has been ill and confined at home!" was the thought that darted through her mind. "This might, then, have been the cause of his absence But no-he was driving about the country!"She longed to ask the doctor something further. She wondered that the others present made no inquiries. Such indifference about a friend was unaccountable--inexcusable! They had not, however, quite done with Mr. Ogilby. "I think I have a right to feel a little hurt at my friend Walter's neglect," said Mrs. Adriance. "He has not yet been to see me. Barent and Alida have been asking after him constantly. I did not quite understand this morning, ma'an," turning to her mother, "what excuse Mrs. Ogilby was making for him." "I do not think she made any excuse," said Mrs. Har- denberg. "She merely remarked that he was not aware of their intention of driving farther than to Milbank." "Oh yes, Ally! I did not think to tell you;" said her aunt, "that Mrs. Ogilby and Agnes called this mornin' and asked after you, and I told them that you hadn't been wery well-and that reminds me, when I asked after Mr. Walter, they said he was not at all well to-day." This new source of anxiety was of service to Alice, in 36*  &#xD;<pb n="426-427" xml:id="VAC7016-00000214"/> 426       WALTER OGILBY. diverting her thoughts from that which had before weighed upon them. "If indisposed, might not Mr. Ogilby possibly be a little hypochondriac? Having misconstrued her action at West Point, might he not, now that he was somewhat ill, be 'disposed to take a gloomy view of things? Perhaps with returning health might come a brighter and more hopeful spirit! All might yet go well." This was not as consolatory an explanation as could have been desired, but it was the only one that suggested itself to Ally, and with it she was forced to be content. A letter received by her uncle on the following day gave notice that John Peter might be expected on Monday after- noon for a visit of one day only. His arrival, Alice per- suaded herself, would bring some change. True, he had not been in a very good humor with Mr. Ogilby when they had parted at West Point, but that feeling must have worn off by this time. They were neither of them, it was to be presumed, so childish as to be retaining little grudges forever. Gertrude returned on Monday. She flattered herself that the Saturday, and the quiet, rainy Sunday which Mr. Halford and her cousin had spent in each other's society, had accomplished much. She had caught, without appear- ing to listen, several allusions to what had passed during her absence,-"the sketch I was showing you,"-" that description I was reading to you,"-and "as soon as your finger will permit you to try that accompaniment,"-which sounded as if there had been a closer intimacy than hereto- fore. But most of all was she elated by the fragment of a criticism from Mr. Halford which she overheard,-- the truly devout and chastened spirit which this language evinces." "Ah!" said Gitty to herself, with irreverent exultation,   FWALTER OGILBY.        427 "if they are getting up a pious sympathy with each other the case is even better than I had ventured to hope! Mat- ters are going on well-very well indeed." "Now, Gitty," said her mother, "the carriage must be' sent to the Landin, you know, for John Peter will be there by three o'clock." This was a convenient arrangement for Gertrude, as it furnished her with an opportunity of going to Newhurg to purchase some articles that would be required in making up the bridesmaids' dresses. Aunt Aulchy, who still clung, with all the pertinacity of a gentle, obstinate nature, to the idea of having Ally for a daughter-in-law, had been revolving a great scheme. "It's no use her denying it," argued she. "Girls always do that-I always did myself. Even if she should say very ugly things about John Peter, it would only make me the more sure she meant to have him at last. But I won't give a hint before her again. It puts her out so whenever I do. I wish I could send word to John Peter to buv her something pretty at Newhurg! There's nothin' like presents to help along. I -remember them diamond shoe- buckles! But Gitty would spoil. all if I said a word to her." The good lady pondered a few minutes. "Ah! I know what I'll do: I'll send and buy her a pretty dress myself -one to wear to the wedding. It'll be easy makin' her believe that John Peter put me up to it." Gertrude was accordingly commissioned to make the purchase. "Some- thin' handsome now, Gitty," were her mother's orders. "I don't care about the price, so it's only pretty. Let it be either white or blue, I don't care which, only I think Ally becomes blue best."          I Gertrude had no objection to her cousin's looking pretty; on the contrary, it was the best policy, just at this juncture, w                    .  &#xD;<pb n="428-429" xml:id="VAC7016-00000215"/> 428       WALTER OGILB Y. to make her as charming as possible.

Not understanding that the pretty blue silk dress, which her aunt triumphantly displayed before her, was in- tended as a bribe, Ally was able to express her pleasure and gratitude ill such terms as to set the good lady's heart in a flutter of delight and hope, and make her ten times more motherly and caressing than ever. There was little of interest to communicate between Alice and her cousin on his first arrival; but after a time she was called upon for sympathy with the information he had to give her. "My father and I are going to take a drive together as soon as tea is over. I shall let you know the result in the morning. If it were only you, to do the talking and argu- ing, I should feel safe enough." "You will have my best wishes," said Alice, with a sigh. "I trust matters will go well now, and peacefully and happily ever after!" There was something sad in her tone, which for a mo- ment caught the attention of the young soldier; but he was so much occupied with his anticipated drive, or with some hopes connected with it, that he soon dismissed all other subjects from his mind and gave himself up wholly to his own contemplations.   WALTER OGILBY.        429 CHAPTER LI. As Ally was leaving the breakfast-room the following morning, John Peter whispered,- "Come out on the back piazza with me a little while- I want to talk with you." She had already gathered from his bright, happy counte- nance that the interview with his father had been satis- factory. The pleasant, shady, back piazza, with its lovely view of mountain and valley, proved, however, an indifferent place for confidential discourse. There was a constant passing apassin assing-not the slightest opportunity of even beginning upon the topic of interest. "This will never do," said John Peter, impatiently. "Let us take a walk-it is not too warm." Ally assented. "Where shall we go?" said she. "It looks very tempting over on that high ground, on the other side of the creek. Is that too far?" "It is by no means a long walk I Have you never been there?" "No; no one here seems to be a walker but Mr. Hal- ford and myself, and we should hardly have thought of strolling off together. I am very glad now to be able to visit what I have often looked at with longing eyes." She ran up for her bonnet and parasol; but as she was again descending she was espied by Gertrude. "Where are you going?" cried she. "To take a little walk with John Peter." Now this would never do. Gertrude had watched her  &#xD;<pb n="430-431" xml:id="VAC7016-00000216"/> 430       WAILTER OGILBY. brother with the closest scrutiny since his return, and the conclusion she had arrived at was, that there existed on his part no stronger feeling towards Alice than a mere cousinly affection. Her hopes, therefore, must now rest solely on Mr. Halford; and she could permit nothing like an appearance of particular intimacy between Ally and John Peter. "In wha;t direction do you propose walkingo?" she asked. "To the rising ground opposite, beyond the creek." "The very place I wished and intended to go to this morning. Just at the foot of that little hill is the house of Mary Carroll. I must have her here at once, to make up our dresses." "Can't we call there and give her your message?" asked her brother, who did not relish this interference with his plans. "And, Gitty," cried her mother, to whom, for reasons of her own, her daughter's proposal was equally distasteful, "there isn't the least need of your goin'. I sent Silvy over yesterday afternoon to engage Mary for day after to- morrow." "Still, there's nothing like attending to one's own busi- ness. I must know what to depend upon. And, John Peter," added she, as she observed that NMr. Halford was within hearing, " if you have fallen out with any of your professors, and wish to discourse with Ally about it, you need not mind me. I shall not be in your way." Somewhat discomposed, her brother sauntered into the parlor to wait until she had prepared herself for the walk. In a little fancy basket upon the table lay the cards and notes which had been recently received. As he tossed them over he noticed Mr. Halford's invitation from Mr. Ogilby.   WALTER OGILBY.         431 "-Do you dine with Ogilby to-day?" asked he. "No," replied the other, shortly. "You would find it pleasant, I dare say." "I have no wish to make the experiment." Perhaps it was because Mr. Halford was engaged in lighting his cigar that his manner seemed a little abrupt. John Peter had no wish to be unfair towards Mr. Ogilby -in fact he hardly remembered the irritation he had feTO a week previous. "Ogilby has seen so much of the world," he remarked, "and has imnproved his mind so carefully, that he is an un- commonly agreeable companion. I should have supposed hint a person exactly to your taste." "Thank you," said the other, dryly; and he walked out upon the piazza and quite away to the farther end of it, as if he wished to cut short the conversation. John Peter saw that Mr. Halford had some recent cause of displeasure at Mr. Ogilby, for when the two had been together at West Point, there had been, evidently, a good understanding between them. He found Ally in the hall, and had time, before Gertrude made her appearance, for one inquiry,- "Ally, when did you see Walter Ogilby last?" The varying color of her cheek, and the slight hesita- tion of .manner with which she answered, "Not very lately," aroused his suspicions. "Has not he been here since the day you were at West Point?" "Then he will be allowed to understand that his visits henceforth at Milbank will be particularly unacceptable." Alice said nothing; and it wa wwith feelings not at all improved towards Mr. Ongilby that John Peter set out with his sister and cousin on their walk.   &#xD;<pb n="432-433" xml:id="VAC7016-00000217"/> 432       WALTER OGILBY. The pleasantest and shortest way to their place of desti- nation was down the new lane, and across a narrow bridge that had been constructed at some distance below the mill- dam. The opposite bank was so steep and rocky that only a footpath conducted over it, in the direction of the more open upland, which was here beautifully diversified with cottages and cornfields. The morning was fine and fresh--the air rich with the bal- samic fragrance of the pines and the perfume of the wild- flowers-the sun, now screened by light, fleecy clouds, and anon pouring forth his rays upon the bright, sparkling waters. Ally felt cheered and invigorated in spite of her- self. Her step grew more elastic, and she was able to reach the summit of the rising ground with less fatigue than she had believed possible. It was a sort of plateau, extending along the base of the mountain, and the elevation on which they stood sloped away in each direction save in that of the higher range in the background. Alice knew in which quarter lay Fern- dale. She strained her eyes to catch a glimpse of some feature that might identify the spot. But no-an envious, projecting crag hid the whole domain from her view. To the right, as she turned to gaze, was Milbank full before her--farther still, the broad acres of Farmer Van Vorst; away to the left, rolling dim and blue in the distance be- yond the valley, were the waters of the Hudson,-every- thing, in short, but Ferndale! "At the foot of the hill, on the side farthest' from the Factory, is Barney Carroll's house," said Gertrude. "When we have rested a little, we will go on." John Peter perceived that the pleasure of the walk was all he was to enjoy in his, cousin's society, for the present. Confidential discourse was out of the question. After they had gazed and admired and rested themselves suffi-   WALTER OGILBY.        433 ciently, therefore, they continued their walk. The sides of the hill were here partially covered with trees and shrubs, so that only a small portion of the steep, winding path was visible before them, as they descended. They had proceeded a part of the distance, when the view opened more, and Alice was startled at observing at the foot of the descent, and just where the pathway turned off upon the level ground, two figures, one of which she could not fail to recognize instantly. Her first inadvertent exclamation was, "Let us return the way we came." Her companions, who had perceived nothing, exclaimed, with surprise,-- "Why, Ally, what are you thinking of? Return just as we have reached the place we have come in search of? ' Their eyes soon caught the figures which were just below them. One was a young girl, who seemed giving way to emotions of the bitteres' sorrow. Her apron was at her eyes, and her whole attitude bespoke a heart bowed down with grief. Both she and her companion, Mr. Ogilby, were so deeply engaged in conversation that they seemed not to heed the approach of the other party. Whatevcr he might be addressing to her, smet, apparently, no assent on her part, for she shook her head slowly, and once raised her head with a gesture as if to put aside the suggestion offered. There was no mistaking the expression of troubled interest depicted on his countenance. The sudden and steep descent brought the intruders upon him ere he was aware. There was a bright gleam in his eye as it caught sight of Alice, which was at once checked by the cold and distant bow of Gertrude, and the look of indignant surprise with which young Ellsworth regarded him.  Mr. Ogilby's whole demeanor instantly changed. He 37  &#xD;<pb n="434-435" xml:id="VAC7016-00000218"/> 434       WALTER OGILBY. drew himself up with an air, Alice thought, of proud dig- nity, saluted the party with distant ceremony, and re- mained standing until they had passed, not heeding the young girl who, throwing her apron over her head, walked rapidly away. "Upon my word, I am sorry to see that. I would not have expected it of Ogilby," were the first words with which John Peter broke the silence. Alice trembled so she could hardly stand. "Pretty business for Miss Mary Carroll to be in!" ex- claimed Gertrude. "I wonder if this is Mr. Ogilby's usual style of instructing his pupils!" "But why," Alice ventured to say, "should we con- demn the poor girl? She seems in great distress from some cause. It is surely natural that she should ask counsel of one who has been, as you say, her instructor." "I dare say the whole transaction is perfectly natural," said Gertrude, in a tone that silenced Alice. Her brother seemed not pleased with the remark, and hastened to change the conversation. In a short time they reached the residence of Barney Carroll. "I suppose, after this," said Gertrude, " that I ought rather to patronize one of the dressmakers in the village; but the fact is, there's nobody can cut and fit like Mary Carroll. I shall give her a piece of my mind, however, and let her know what we think of her." The anxious, dejected countenance of the mother, as she opened the door, did not escape her visitors. Gertrude left her message for Mary without inquiring for her; and Mrs. Carroll, with ma y courtesies and compliments, promised to deliver it. "Mary has just walked out a little way. She ought to have been in before this," said she.   WALTER OGILBY.        435 Gertrude longed to tell her that they knew perfectly well where her daughter was, but she refrained, and merely re- iterating her hope that Mary would not disappoint her, she left the house. The remainder of the walk home across the main bridge, and around by the hot, dusty highroad, was productive of anything but pleasure to two of the pedestrians. As for Gertrude, she thought nothing could have happened more opportune than this rencounter. It must necessarily, she thought, lower Mr. Ogilby in the eyes of her cousin, and help to detach her from him. All her skill in planning seemed to be put to shame by unexpected instances of good luck. Alice's defence of Mary Carroll had been perfectly spontaneous-it was in accordance with her natural dis- position to act as champion of those who were attacked. Yet she could not overcome e feeling of anxiety. She longed to know why her cousins should be so ready to put an unfavorable construction on what seemed a simple and laudable act of kindness. "It is very, unfair," she argued, "to seem to concur in the disapprobation they evidently feel. I shaJ take some opportunity df expressing my opinion." An occasion was not long wanting. After they had gone up-stairs and taken off their things, Gertrude, who judged it politic to deepen a little the impression which she fancied had been produced, began,- "After all, those people who make a great profession of religion are no more to be trusted than those who are con- tent to be tolerably good, like their neighbors." "If you mean Mr. Ogilby," said Ally, forcing herself to'speak with steadiness, "I cannot see anything wrolngt in his showing sympathy with that young girl, who is probably in some sorrow or affliction. I cannot under-  &#xD;<pb n="436-437" xml:id="VAC7016-00000219"/> 436       WALTER OGILBE: stand why John Peter should have made the remark he did." "It is just possible," replied Gitty, "that my brother knows his own sex better than we can do. And, Ally, I'll give you a piece of advice, for you seem wonderfully un- sophisticated: the less curiosity you indulge, in regard to young men's doings or the motives of them, the better opinion you will have of them." Ally -was silenced, but not convinced. The excitement of what had passed, and the feelings -of indignation aroused by Gitty's remarks, quite did away with all sen- sation of fatigue. She changed her dress, and went down- stairs with a heightened color, and an air of greater reso' lution than usual. Mr. Halford was waiting in the large, airy hall, with an arm-chair drawn for her into the coolest place, and he was eager in begging her to have some wine and water, to allow herself to be fanned, or to permit him in some way to contribute to her comfort. All this Gertrude saw with satisfaction; and she was only afraid that a very earnest and apparently interesting conversation which her brother took care to secure with Alice, before his departure for West Point, might prejudice the course of events which seemed in so fair a train. "My father has been most kind, most liberal," John Peter had said to his cousin, when he had succeeded in drawing her a little apart from the circle of young people around the piano. "He has no objection to my marrying so early; on the contrary, he says -he thinks a home of my own would be the greatest safeguard amid the idleness and temptations of a garrison life. He will do everything that is handsome; and he advises me to go directly to Alsh- field as soon as, I get my commission. He thinks I had better not press to have our marriage take place before the   WTALTER OGILBY.        437 expiration of one year of probation. It seems an inter- minable time to wait, but I suppose I can be patient. And another thing, seeing there is this uncertainty, my father agrees with me that it is most prudent to keep the matter to ourselves. What is the use, as he says, of furnishing speculation to five hundred aunts and cousins?" "Shall you say nothing upon the subject to your mother? It would seem but a proper mark of respect." "Oh, Ally, the poor dear soul would order up the horses and carriage, and travel from Dan to Beersheba, to spread the good news of a possible wedding in the family. I am not ready, I confess, to stand the banter of such a circle, still less of their sympathy and condolence in case of an unfortunate issue to the affair. No--there must no hint be given until after my return from Ashfield." Ally acquiesced; and soon after the young soldier set off for Coldspring on his way to West Point. CHAPTER LII. ANNE ELIZA was by no means disposed to remain satis- fied with the little she had been able to gather from Ally of the reasons of Mr. Ogilby's absence. She resolved to go to what she believed a sure source of information, namely -to his friend the doctor. During the customary call of the latter, on the following morning, she drew him aside for a little confidential chat. "Uncle," she began, "has your friend Mr. Ogilby left the country?" 37*  &#xD;<pb n="438-439" xml:id="VAC7016-00000220"/> 438       WALTER OGILB I "No, certainly," said the doctor, a little startled. "Why do you ask?" "Only that he used to come here sometimes, and we were getting to like him. But now he absents himself altogether --we never set eyes on him." "Since when?" "Since the day we were all at West Point." "What happened then?" "That is more than I can tell. We were the greatest friends possible all the way down. You understand, uncle, that I am not speaking of myself. Out of compliment to you, Mr. Ogilby being your favorite, I did fall in love with him myself and did my best to catch hinm, but I found it would not answer-somebody else had got the start of me (with a mischievous smile); so, as I could not afford to waste time, I elected Lieutenant Barton to fill the vacancy, as the politicians say. Well, all the way down to West Point that day he was perfectly devoted to Ally-he had neither eyes nor ears for any one else. After our arrival there, however, things seemed somehow to change. They kept apart and did not speak together, and looked very grave and sober all the time--he, particularly. And since then he has never been near the house."  ' I think his conduct perfectly natural," said the doctor, after a moment's reflection. "You young misses go flirting off to West Point, and there you fall in love, at a moment's notice, with some gray-coated, bell-buttoned little sprig that you've never set eyes on before--give him all your smiles and attention, and then expect sensible, dignified fellows like Walter Ogilby and the rest of us, to stand such non- sense, and be your humble servants, when you choose to turn to us again." "That will do for me, uncle, but not for Ally. If you think she received more attention than she ought you are   WALTER OGILBI        439 mistaken. She walked with none of the cadets but John Peter, except for a very little while in the latter part of the day. She was away at one of the professor's houses- with some old friends of her father's whom she accident-, ally met-a good part of the time. I should think, if your friend were inclined to be jealous, he would be more trou- bled about Cousin Pinckney than about any of the poor little cadets." "What has your Cousin Pinckney to do with the mat- ter?" asked the doctor, a little alarmed. "Why, everybody must see that he admires Ally ex- treinely-and I, who am sharper-sighted than the rest, know that if he thought there was the faintest hope of his :succeeding, he would not be trying so hard all the time not to be in love." "If he thinks he is in danger he had better go away!" said the doctor, shortly. "That is what he has been intending to do for a week past-but, as you see, he is not gone yet. Perhaps he thinks his chances are growing better." The doctor did not like this view of the subject, but his further questioning was cut short by the entrance of Aunt A ulchy and Alice. "Good-morning, sister. What is the matter?": said he; "you look troubled." "And so I am," said the good lady. "Oh, brother Theodore I I had such a strange dream last night I You don't know how distressed I feel 1!" "Let us hear what it was about," said her brother-in- law. "  Oh! I dreamed I was down at Ferndale, and we walked out in the orchard, and there those great vergatoo pear. trees were loaded down with such beautiful fruit, just as ripe as they could be I And we kept pickin' and eatinl them 1"  &#xD;<pb n="440-441" xml:id="VAC7016-00000221"/> "O       WALTER OGILBY "Well, I see nothing so very distressing in all that." "Oh, brother! how can you say so? Don't you know this is only the last day of June? I do feel so bad-there was Walter Ogilby pickin' and givin' em to us till we could not eat another one!" "Ah! I see what the trouble is. You should have tried to eat a few more." "No, no, it is not that," exclaimed the poor lady; "but don't you know what the sign is? Dream of fruit out of season, You'll quarrel without reason. Now I suppose the first thing I know, I shall be quar- rellin' with somebody." "Not you, sister Aulchy. Be comforted. Having lived in peace for forty or fifty years, you are not going to fall out with your neighbors now." "Forty or fifty I why, brother, how you talk I I was only forty-six last February." "I beg your pardon; but even that length of time is a good guarantee for the future. No fear of your quarrelling. Eat your pears, or whatever else you may dream about, in comfort, and you will go on, for the rest of your life, as peacefully and pleasantly as you always have done, I'll engage." Anne Eliza had left the room; and, as his sister-in-law went bustling about, the doctor contrived to say to Ally in a low tone,- "I am afraid my little niece has been dreaming, too, of the Ferndale pears!" Ally looked up at him for a moment. She comprehended his meaning, and, with varying color, replied,- "No; I assure you I have not quarrelled, either with or without reason. If any one has taken offence at me it is   WALTER OGILB I        441 something I cannot understand. I have certainly not given just cause." She spoke with so much sincerity, and at the same time with so much feeling, that the doctor believed her, and came to the conclusion that he must look elsewhere for an ex- planation. He was glad that no pressing business this morning pre- vented his calling at Ferndale. Several days had elapsed since he had been there, nor had he seen his friend Walter for the same length of time. He found him this morning at home. The first look sufficed to convince him that some- thing had occurred-the habitually animated, cheerful ex- pression was quite gone from his countenance. "How is your patient, old Ferguson?"' asked he, after the first salutations were over. "Gradually failing-sometimes suffering intensely, al- though at others comparatively easy. I have thought I of asking you to call and see him, but the poor fellow in- sists that my prescriptions only, can do him good." "Let us walk over there and take a look at him. I am quite at leisure this morning. ' They walked along down the banks of the stream, past the gardens and graperies, and over the bridge to the meadow-lands in the recess at the foot of the mountain. "What have you growing there on the edge of the water?" asked the doctor. "Something new since I was here last?" "Those are osiers. I have been making the experiment of cultivating them, for the sake of finding employment for some of the old people about here, in basket-making. I succeed very well with them. Poor old Ferguson was getting much interested in the business, and delighted to think he was able to earn a little sum monthly, when he was laid low by what I fear will prove his last sick- ness. '  &#xD;<pb n="442-443" xml:id="VAC7016-00000222"/> "2       WALTER OGILBY. The two friends continued, as they pursued their way, to discourse Upon general topics, commenting on the dif- ferent objects that met their view. The doctor was all the time considering how he should introduce the subject in which, from the affection he bore both parties, he felt so lively an interest. He had not fully made up his mind before they reached Ferguson's cottage, and then it suddenly oc- curred to him that an agitating conversation would not be the most desirable preparation for a medical consultation -therefore, that what he had to say or inquire about had better be postponed until the visit to the sick man was over. There was no occasion for a prolonged stay. The doc- tor made some slight prescription for the old man, after having examined into his case. "I think you arne going on verv judiciously," said he to his young friend, after they had left the house. "As you say, very little can be done. Your conversation and sympathy are better for him than any of my drugs; but yet, if what I have given him produces no effect, come up to my office in a day or two, and we will look over some of my books together. I was thinking of you and poor old Ferguson not three days ago, when I met with a somewhat similar case in one of my journals." The doctor thoug ht it was now time to open the attack upon a still more interesting subject. "I was at Milbank this morning, on my way here." He paused. "Are they all well there?" asked Mr. Ogilby, with as much steadiness as he could command. "Aunt Au'chy is much as usual--so are Catlyna and Anne. As for Gitty, she was up-stairs, and I did not see her; and Mr. ITalford, I think they said, had gone to take a walk; of course he is very well." Mr. Ogilby waited a few minutes, but the doctor con- tinued silent.   WALTER OGILBY.         443 "Miss Morton was indisposed a day or two since; has she quite recovered?" he at length asked. "I should say her health was about the same as yours; not exactly what we could wish, either in mind or body." Mr. Ogrilby was at this moment cutting a switch from a tuft of alders. He did not look at the doctor neither did he reply to his remark. Finding that he must make an- other push, the doctor determined that it should be a bold one. "Walter," said he, "you must excuse me if I am trans- gressing the bounds of friendship, but you know how near you are to me, how like a son I have always regarded you. Had my own boy lived, I verily believe I could not have loved him more tenderly than I do you. So, Walter, you will allow me to tell you one thing: I know that young people sometimes make mistakes. I see that there is something amiss between you and my little niece, which the timely intervention of a friend may set right again. You love each other, and yet you seem to be mlaking each other unhappy. Do not, I entreat you, throw away your A happiness and hers on account of any trifling misunder- standing. I feel that I am taking a great liberty.; greater, perhaps," added he, as he -saw that Mr. Ogilby did not at once reply, "than I am warranted in doing." "No, my kind, excellent friend," said' Mr. Ogilby; "I am deeply sensible of the tender interest you take in my welfare, and I thank you for it. It is right that with one so valued I should be perfectly candid, at least so far as mny own affairs are concerned. You are mistaken in sup- posing that Miss Morton's happiness is in any way de- pendent on me or my actions. She undoubtedly feels great regret that I should have bestowed my affections where they could not meet a return. As an amiable and right-minded woman she cannot immediately recover her  &#xD;<pb n="444-445" xml:id="VAC7016-00000223"/> "4       WALTER OGILBY. cheerfulness after making the discovery that she has, how- ever innocently, been the occasion to another of sufferings worse than----"He stopped, and the doctor hastened to reply. "Walter, are you quite sure you are right? Are you certain that Ally cannot, does not, return your affection?" "It would but add to my sorrow to think otherwise," said Mr. Ogilby, with deep feeling, " since she can never be mine She is engaged to another." The doctor stood aghast. "Ally engaged? To whom-to Mr. Halford?" "Not to Mr. Halford-and when I tell you that I am enjoined secrecy, I am sure you will question me no fur- ther. Neither, I am convinced, will you ever again allude to a subject so inexpressibly painful to me " "My dear boy, you may rely upon my silence. I need not tell you how deeply I feel for you. I can feel; for if there was one event on which I had set my -heart more than another, it waOX your union with my little Ally, But one word more-I hope she did not mislead you, that she has not acted unfairly---- "No, no," said Mr. Ogilbv, hurriedly; "I have no one to blame but myself. I was too precipitate, too sanguine. Since I have learned the truth I have thought it best, for my own peace of mind, to see as little of her as possible; therefore I do not go'any more to Milbank. I have it in contemplation to leave home for a time-that is, if I can first see one matter happily adjusted in which I am at present much interested; after that, I shall feel as if I had better be away." Mr. Ogilby then went on to give his friend the history of Michael and Mary Carroll, and the doctor's warm sympa- thies were ai once enlisted on the subject. He was particu- larly indignant on learning that the efforts his friend Walter   WALTER OGILBY.         445 had made to move the girl's father had utterly failed of success "The old reprobate!" he exclaimed. "The sanctimoni- ous old hypocrite! Why does not Michael get a parcel of the boys to duck him in the creek? He ought to have such a baptizing as would wash the old Adam out of him for all the rest of his life!" And, without pausing to reflect whether any of our t" first father" was yet remaining in his own composition, the doctor mounted into his sulky, and took his way home. Arrived there, he sat down at the end of the piazza and smoked his pipe in great abasement of spirit. All his favorite plans fallen to the ground I How could it have happened? Had Ally been engaged all this time? How was it that she had permitted Walter to go on fall- ing more and more in love, when she knew that she could not, or ought not, to return his affection? It was a very bad piece of business. Gitty must, in some way, have been mixed- up with it, that was certain. How, or in what manner, the doctor could not pretend to say, as Ger- trude's name had not been once mentioned by Mr. Ogilby. He could not go to Alice for further particulars, for he had promised silence to his friend Walter. He could not go to Aunt Lany for consolation, for the same reason; and even should he be guilty of that very rare indiscretion of telling a secret to his wife, he had an impression that he should be met by the suggestion, "People -can make matches for-themselves much better than others can make for them." So there was nothing left for the good doctor but to smoke his pipe in silence, and wonder how it was all to terminate. 38  &#xD;<pb n="446-447" xml:id="VAC7016-00000224"/> "6       WALTER OGILBY. CHAPTER LIII. GERTRUDE'S manner to Ally had been for the last few days all kindness and complaisance: It was like what it had been the two first days after her return from Nine Partners. Ally was at a loss to account for the change, but ever alive to kindness, she was gratified by it. In the afternoon they were to go to visit the Van Ant- werps, and Gertrude really showed a considerable degree of solicitude about her cousin's dress and appearance. She even remarked how prettily her hair fell in ringlets over her ears and neck, and suggested the addition of some white millefleurs as an ornament, after their arrival at their place of destination. Ally cared little about the impression she might produce. It was not probable she should see him there.' He was bent on avoiding her-he would not go, she was confident, to the house of one of the family connections. But per- haps they might meet him on the way, for he still, she supposed, rode about the country as usual. He had re- covered his health sufficiently, it seemed, to be able to walk a mile or more to the vicinity of Barney Carroll's on the day previous. And here Ally strove to turn away her thoughts. What was it to her what he might have been saying to Mary Carroll? It could certainly have been nothing but what benevolent sympathy dictated; or perhaps some kind counsel in a case of perplexity. How strange that Gertrude did not take a more amiable view of the matter!   WALTER OGLBY.        447 What a pity that she was not careful to "judge with a righteous judgment!" Well, she would strive not to perplex herself. All things would be ordered riglit, better than she, "in her poor wis- dom," could have ordered them. If Mr. Ogilby and she were to meet no more-if she had needed this trial-if she had set up an idol in her heart which must be dethroned -would not'I e who sent the blow give her strength to bear it? But poor Ally felt that she had not yet received the power to look this possibility calmly in the face. It was no small addition to her trouble that she was obliged to listen to the reiterated comments of Anne Eliza upon Mr. Ogilby's absence. "Ally, what can have become of him? To break off so suddenly I There can be but one solution: Ally, I do be- lieve he offered himself to you and you refused him the day we were at West Point,-and if you did, I must say you are a little bit of a coquette, for nobody would have suspected such a thing from the manner in which you re- ceived his attentions on our way down. I just gave a little hint of this to Cousin Pinck, and he fired up in a minute." "Did you tell Mr. Halford you thought me a coquette? You are very honest to own it," said Alice, languidly, for at the moment she cared very little for the opinion either of the little beauty or of her cousin. "No, indeed I I know' better than to say exactly that. I only remarked that I did not see how you could find it in your heart to be so cruel to that charming, -irresistible young man. He gave me one of his dignified, overwhelm- ing looks, and replied in an awful tone, as if he had been the Great' Mogul, 'Miss Morton's name should not be bandied about in that indelicate manner!

And then, Sir Oracle stalked off, and fancied, I suppose, that he had silenced me forever." Alice could not but be more and more convinced that Mr. Halford was a very amiable, high-minded young man. She was grateful to him, not so much for having taken-her part when she was accused of coquetry, as for having no suspicions of her regard for Mr. Ogilby. So pleasantly did she feel inclined towards him that she was able to listen with a peculiar degree of complaisance to all he found to entertain her with, during their viit, greatly to Gertrude's satisfaction. The latter observed, it is true, that Ally declined dancing when Mr. Halford invited her, and that, in reply to his earnest petition for his favorite song, she excused herself on the plea of a slight hoarse- ness; but then she remarked that he was her companion when the young people went for a little promenade onf the piazza, and that upon two or three occasions they were engaged in what appeared to be very interesting conversa- tions. She was very glad that her uncle, the doctor, did not come in to disturb matters by monopolizing Ally, as he was too much in the habit of doing, or to divine, and, if possible, defeat what she was now aiming to accomplish. Mary Carroll was true to her appointment on the fol- lowing morning. Her pale, sweet countenance instantly interested Ally in her favor. She saw that there was deep and real sorrow in the heart of the young girl, and her own was touched with pity. "How could any one," said she to herself, " look on that fair, candid brow, and suspect her of wrong?" Gertrude had, without any ceremony, appropriated Ally's apartment for a work-room, and having installed Mary   WALTER OGILBY.         449 there, she at once commenced giving her instructions in the minutest manner. "Now, Mary, I beg to impress upon you that I must have no wrinkles in the body of my dress. If a person understands her business she will never have a wrinkle. Do not make it so tight that it will look as if it were pasted on me-and if it is too loose it will always have a slouching, slovenly look. I hope you will cut it without the least particle of waste, for I am not sure that I have any too large a pattern; and pray make allowance that if it has to be let out there will be something to do it with- I hate skimping." Alice, always obliging, proffered her services to assist her cousin in making the all-important bridesmaid's dress, and the two seated themselves for a time beside Mary. The Miss Westbrooks had brought a very complete and ,expensive wardrobe from the city-they had, therefore, no preparation to make for the great event. Gertrude had opposed her mother's suggestion to send and order "a fashionable dress from York." "No," she said, "she should certainly not trust the selection of any part of her wardrobe to a mantuamaker. She was going to the city for a visit in September, when lher cousins returned, and she should require many expen- sive additions to her wardrobe. Something cheap and pretty, that she and Mary Carroll together could contrive, would do well enough for Philly's wedding. There was no occasion for anything very stylish." Mary had both neatness and skill, and Gitty was too good a general to jeopardize the success of this effort by attending to anything but the business before them until all was pronounced perfect and complete-not a wrinkle to be seen-not a possibility of the slightest improvement. "It is all ready to sew off now, and I think I may leave 38*  &#xD;<pb n="450-451" xml:id="VAC7016-00000226"/> 450       WALTER OGILBY. you," said she. "Ally, don't trouble yourself to do any more after you have finished that skirt." She walked to the grlass to adjust her dress, which she had resumed after the last trying-on. Without looking immediately at the young girl, she thus addressed her,- "' I think it a kindness, Mary, to put you a little on your guard. You are perhaps not aware how ill it looks for a young girl in your station in life to be receiving the atten- tions of gentlemen of family and fortune. Such attentions mean nothing honorable you may be sure. And if you imagine that Mr. Ogilby ever thinks of you, except in such a manner as may compromise your reputation and bring you everlasting sorrow and disgrace, you will find, too late, that you have been terribly deceived." Having finished her harangue and her toilet, Gitty left the apartment. Mary had dropped her work and sat gaz- ing at her, as she continued speaking, apparently without power to utter a word. Her cheeks were in a blaze, and her eyes sparkling with astonishment and indignation. As the door closed, however, she again took up her work, but Ally saw that the tears were dropping fast upon it. She had been shocked at the unfeeling manner in which her cousin gave utterance to her degrading suspicions. Even had she known that Mary deserved censure, this would have been neither the proper time nor manner of administering it. "Do not cry, Mary," said she, soothingly. "My cousin does not mean all that her words seem to convey. We do not suspect you of anything wrong. You are in trouble, and if Mr. Ogilby has been your friend and instructor, he is perhaps the proper person to give you advice. My cousin does not know in what circumstances you may be placed. Do not afflict yourself in this manner at what she said." "No, Miss," replied Mary, "Mr. Ogilby has never been O .     )    WALTER O GILBY.        451 my instructor, but he has been a good friend. Oh I it's little he thinks his kindness could be looked upon in such a light. Mr. Ogilby would never think of me but with re- spect, poor as I am. He thinks rightly of everybody, for he is all goodness, and has no evil thoughts " Poor Ally sighed. She thought Mary went too far in her praises. "I thought I had trouble enough before," continued Mary, almost inarticulate with the excess of her feelings, "but this is one that I never looked for. To be suspected I Oh I it is very hard!" "Yes, Mary, I feel with you-it is very hard. But in all our trouble we have our heavenly Father to go to. He does not afflict willingly, or grieve the children of men. If he sends us sorrow it is for our good, and he will make a way to escape if we are patient." "I know that," said Mary, wiping her eyes, "and I try to remember the promise; but- sometimes I cannot see how things can be altered. I do not mind telling you, Miss, what a sore trouble I have to bear, for you seem so tender- hearted that I know you feel for me. And besides, you were with Miss Gertrude, and you saw what she misun- derstood so strangely,-so it is but right that I should ex- plain." As Mary went on with her story, which was at first sub- stantially the same as that given by Michael to Mr. Ogilby, Ally could not but feel the deepest sympathy. Her heart beat as Mary went on, and she heard the name so dear to her coupled with praises and blessings for his goodness. "And yesterday morning," said Mary, "Mr. Ogilby came up early to see my father, and to talk with him about this matter, but he found only my mother at home. Father had told us the day before that he had as good as promised me to Mr. Stokes, and that I need think no more of Michael  &#xD;<pb n="452-453" xml:id="VAC7016-00000227"/> 452       WALTER OGILBY. Byrne. I thought I should certainly have died when I heard it. But it made mother worse to see me fretting, and so I walked away a little piece that I might cry by myself. My mother told Mr. Ogilby all, and he said it must not be -that if money was my father's object he need not destroy his child's happiness on that account, for he would give Michael as good a salary as Stokes could get at the Factory, and. that he was building a neat pretty house for him now, just beyond the lower garden. He said, too, he would see my father himself and try and persuade him. My father had gone up to High Point to see an acquaintance, so Mr. Ogilby offered to come up again late in the afternoon. He was walking back to Ferndale when he met me, sitting on a log at the foot of the hill. He told me what he had been saying to mother, thinking it would cheer me, but I know my father too well to be so easily encouraged. It is not exactly for the money, nor yet because he is sure that Stokes can make a lady of the girl he marries. It is more the pride of sticking to what he has said. I believe my happiness in life would not be of so much consequence to him as the satisfaction of boasting how he had stood out against so grand a gentleman as Mr. Ogilby; even though he was the one that saved his child's life at the risk of his own. No-there will be no change as far as he is con- cerned." "But would you think it right," said Ally, "to marry this man Stokes when you have no feeling but of dislike towards him-when you have promised Michael to be his?" "It seems to me that I would be perjured," said the poor girl; "but I think, and think-and sometimes I hardly know what is right. The commandment is very strong, 'Honor thy father and thy mother.' I get almost beside myself at times, and think I will run away and marry   WALTER OGILBY.        453 Michael at once. But then again I fee as if God's bless- ing would not follow me if 1 should. I said all this to Mr. Ogilby." "And what was his advice?" "He said I must try and be patient-that he thought he could work upon my father in time. But he does not know my father, or he would have very little hope." "Don't despair, Mary," said Alice, tenderly. "God has many ways of bringing light out of darkness. We cannot ourselves see in what manner evils are to be remedied, yet in his own appointed way he is able to turn our sorrow into joy. Only trust in Him, and continue to be dutiful to your father-that is-as far as you can in conscience, for falsehood and perjury are no part of your duty. If matters do not change for the better I will speak to my uncle. He may induce Stokes to give up his pursuit of you. Indeed, I do not think he would keep in his employ a workman who could show such a total want of principle." The cloud cleared away a little from Mary's brow. "There might be something done in that way," said she. "Stokes does not care enough for me to risk his place for my sake. I will,strive to be patient for my mother's sake. If I could only know that poor Michael has some one to speak such words of comfort to him I But oh I he fears the worst, and his heart is almost broken." "He has a kind friend on earth as well as one in heaven,' said Ally, in a low voice. "Mr. Ogilby is wise and good; he will not let Michael despair." Mary dried her tears hastily and went on with her work, for she heard the voice of Miss Ellsworth upon the stairs, speaking to her cousins in the hall below. Gitty looked inquisitively at them both as she entered, but Ally had turned away and was folding carefully the skirt of the dress which she had completed. As she did not speak im-  &#xD;<pb n="454-455" xml:id="VAC7016-00000228"/> 454       WALTER OGILBY. mediately, her cousin could only guess how far her feelings had been called into play during the time she and Mary had been left together. At evening, after the young girl's departure, Gertrude took the opportunity, while she was collecting the different portions of her dress and its trimmings, to endeavor to satisfy the curiosity by which she had all day been devoured, but which, with her usual tact, she had not suffered to ap- pear. "So, you and Mary Carroll had a very interesting con- fab while I was away?" said she, laughing. "Did the at- tractive qualities of Mr. Walter Ogilby form the principal theme?" "Mary spoke only of his noble and generous ones," said Alice, with spirit. "Oh, Gertrude I! when you hear what a friend he has been you will not misjudge him and poor Mary so cruelly." She hastened to give her cousin the history she had re- ceived from the young girl, and when she came to the con- clusion, she waited with an eager, anxious look for reply or comment. Gertrude said nothing, but fixed her eyes upon her cousin with a sort of compassionate smile. There was something very provoking in it, and it roused Ally to inquire, "Well, what can you say now?" "Only that the gallant Walter is likelyto have to pay pretty dear, as it is right he should. Six hundred a year is no trifle, even to him; but he must not complain. If I were old Carroll I would insist upon a thousand. As for Michael, whom you are expending so much fine feeling upon, I think he is remarkably obliging, and his master is very fortunate to have such good-natured people at his service." Alice was too much shocked to reply immediately. After a few minutes, however, she collected herself suffi-   WALTER OGILBYI        455 ciently to say, "You and I think and judge so differently that we had best drop this subject now and forever." "Agreed-only, Ally," said her cousin, not losing sight of her usual prudence, 'indeed you must not be angry with me. You are a dear, innocent little creature, and know nothing of the wickedness of the world; but one of these days you will grow wiser, and then you will not ac- cuse me, as you are now doing in your heart, of being so very uncharitable." Ally's thoughts were not merely that her cousin was uncharitable. A new light seemed suddenly to flash upon her. If Gertrude could so labor to depreciate Mr. Ogilby in her estimation, might she not have used the same efforts to change his good opinion of her? Again the doctor's warning rose up in her mind: "If Gitty cannot make you dislike Walter Ogilby, she will at least contrive that you shall appear to do so." Was her hatred of him really so great? Her manner towards him certainly indicated nothing of the kind. It was all a mystery. She could not understand it. Of one thing she was resolved, however. She would not suf- fer herself to be influenced by her cousin's opinions. She would not treat Mr. Ogilby as if she disliked him, should they meet again. She would both think and speak of him with the respect and approbation he deserved, even should he unhappily have learned to regard her with indifference, or it might be with disesteem.  &#xD;<pb n="456-457" xml:id="VAC7016-00000229"/> 456       WALTER OGILBY. CHAPTER    LIV. INSTEAD of Mary Carroll on the following morning, came her brother Tom to Milbank, with a large covered basket, and a message that his sister was not well enough to keep her engagement; but if Miss Ellsworth would trust her dress to her care, she would complete it and send it home as early as possible. Ally divined at once that Mr. Ogilby had been unsuc- cessful with the father, and that poor Mary had need of all the consolation she could offer Not liking to trust to a message which might never be delivered by Master Tom, she was considering-while Gitty, amid a good deal of grumbling and fault-finding, was making ready the dress and its trimmings-how she could contrive to send a little note to Mary. A sudden question from her cousin -came in aid.- "What will you do, Ally, about your pretty blue silk if Mary Carroll is going to put on airs and stay at home? As for her being sick, that is all a mere excuse. She is indulging a little fit of temper because I gave her some unpalatable advice yesterday." Ally sighed. What to her now was the pretty blue silk dress? Who that she cared for, would be likely to see her wear it? Still it was her kind aunt's present, and she must appear to regard it with interest. She was par- ticularly glad of the opportunity thus afforded her to say, "I had better write a few lines to Mary and ask her to come and make it as soon as she feels able." "Oh, yes," was the reply; "doubtless she will be inclined to oblige you, though she can treat me so cavalierly."   tWALTER OIrLBI.        457 Ally hastily scribbled a few lines. "' Take courage, Mary; I have spoken to my uncle, and he says Stokes shall not continue long to persecute you. Being one of the most important workmen, he cannot be discharged at once, but will be, as soon as his place can be supplied, if lie pursues his present course. Be firm and faithful, Mary. Do not be persuaded to sacrifice your own happiness and that of an honest heart that relies on you. God will bless you and bring, all things right. "Your friend,      A. M." A postscript contained the message in regard to the dress. Having finished her note, she brought it and pinned it upon the work that Gertrude was just laying carefully in the basket.. "Sealed!" said the latter, as she turned over the note with a scrutinizing look. "You seem to be entering into a regular, formal correspondence with Miss Carroll!" Ally made no reply. She cared little for the taunt, so long as she had the power of sending words of comfort to poor Mary. Gertrude was out of humor all day. She could not be blind to the probability that Mary would see Mr. Ogilby again-that, in the height of her gratitude for the sympa- thy she had received, she might speak to him of Alice in terms that would rouse up anew all, the feelings that he was endeavoring to subdue-that she might even mention Miss Morton's seeming sad and out of spirits, and thus awaken his suspicions of the truth of what had been com- municated to him.  He might possibly take a sudden reso- lution to apply to Alice herself for a solution of his doubts. There was nothihg in such a course that even his fas- tidious ideas of duty could shrink from. One meeting be- tween them, and the game; was lost. She perplexed her- 39 ^   &#xD;<pb n="458-459" xml:id="VAC7016-00000230"/> 458       WALTER OGILBY. self with devising means of providing against such a con- tingency; but even her fertile brain could furnish no new expedient. She must rely mainly on Mr. Halford. As far as he was concerned, things were as promising as could be desired. The arrivalof John Peter and his friends, on the fol- lowing afternoon, relieved her from all anxiety. Feeling towards Mr. Ogilby, and judging of him as her brother evidently had done on his former visit, it was unlikely that there would now be any intercourse with Ferndale for some time tdocome. Mr. Ogilby had pride enough to keep aloof from the Milbank circle, at least until very decided overtures should be made towards a renewal of the inti- macy. The presence of the guests gave a new aspect to the face of affairs. The young gentlemen were in fine spirits. Captain Carter more courteous and dignified, Lieutenant Barton more animated and agreeable than ever. Gertrude saw with pleasure that, after his first salutations and a hurried question and answer, John Peter showed no disposition to monopolize his cousin, or in any way to excite the suspicions of Mr. Halford, who quietly kept near her, though without showing her any very marked atten- tions. It was impossible not to admire the tact with which he was-carrying on his operations. "He will secure her at last," said Gitty to herself. "Ally does not suspect the interest he feels in her. She thinks all that Anne Eliza has said is mere rattle. In his quiet, undemonstrative manner, Halford is making himself neces- sary to her, while she imagines his attentions those of mere friendly politeness. If the fire does not break out and startle her too suddenly, he will wind himself around her completely, before she is aware." Gertrude, when not making observations of this kind, was occupying herself in playing the agreeable to Captain L1VI)VI rllrVJ 1 Llb VIIV   WALTER OGILB:         459 Carter, who was to stand her in stead for the future, in case of the failure of other schemes. -Lieutenant Barton and Anne Eliza in like manner paired off together--they ere quite captivated with each other, and cared not how con- spicuous they made the fact. Catlyna, having neither beauty nor animation to make her attractive, and wearing at present rather a sombre expression as she found her so- ciety by no means so highly prized by her Cousin Pinckney as she could have wished, attracted the notice of John Peter, and hK really set himself to entertain her in a more good-natured manner than had lately been his wont. There was much that was amusing to be told by the gentlemen, and much that was gallant to be said by at least two of them. Gertrude and Anne Eliza were neither of them wanting in a talent for small talk and repartee, and the evening was passing in apparently the liveliest enjoyment when the circle was augmented by the arrival of a numer- ous reinforcement of the Vandervoort and Van Antweirp cousins. It seeming a settled principle that a party of young people should never meet together without the refreshnmnt of a dance, even though the thermometer stood at ninety degrees Fahrenheit, most of the company were soon in an active state of perspiration and enjoyment Ally offered her services at the piano; but, one of the young cousins having been complimented by Mr. Halford into attempting a new set of Benoit's cotillions, she found herself excused and recommended to a seat by a window opening towards the garden, where the slight evening breeze was stealing in, laden with the delicious fragrance of the mignonette, honeysuckle, and heliotrope. Mr. Halford took a seat near her, and for a little time looked on the gay, mirthful scene without speaking. Dreading lest he might think her preoccupied, and unmindful of his attention to her comfort, Alice felt that  &#xD;<pb n="460-461" xml:id="VAC7016-00000231"/> "O       WALTER,-7-?GILB KY she must say something by way of a return for his kind- ness. "Meeta will hardly thank you," she remarked, looking at the young girl, " for the exchange you have made. I hope she does not envy me the enjoyment you have secured me here." "Are you enjoying yourself?" said Mr. Halford, with a pleased look. "Do you speak seriously?"Ally was a little embarrassed. "Are we not all enjoying ourselves?" asked she, eva- sively. "Who can tell?" said her companion. "Who can measure the depths of sorrow that may be hidden in the breasts of more than one of this company? What disap- pointments of love or ambition! -What pangs of envy or jealousy! What longings for that which is unattainable! What hopelessness in a future whichi others, perhaps, deem fair and bright I Ah, Miss Morton! if the mask of society could be raised, what sad realities would it not too often disclose!" "You surely cannot mean that for the company before us," said Ally, a little startled by the solemnity of his man- ner. "Look at the gay groups! Can you imatgine any corroding care beneath that universally smiling exterior?" "Judge for yourself. Take those whom you know best -your cousin, John Peter, for instance. HHas he no secret cause for anxiety to which we' can refer his alternately abstracted air and unnatural gayety?"  Alice began to be a little uneasy. "And Gertrude?" asked she. "It is not for me to pronounce upon the ladies; but look at her now." Alice looked as he spoke. Her cousin was indeed, at that moment, evidently under the influence of some far firom pleasurable feeling.   WALTER OGILBBY.        461 She was listening with clouded brow to a whispered com- rmunication from her Cousin Garret, whose countenance also bore marks of perplexity and dissatisfaction. What could have happened? A few minutes before, Gertrude had been radiant witlh smiles-so much so that Ally had almost envied her her gay and happy spirits. "I do not know what to say now," she replied. "It surely can be no heartfelt sorrow that has produced this sudden change in Gertrude. You will admit that she could not be so gay and animated, as she usually is, if she had a real grief. But, indeed, Mr. 1Halford, I shall begin to be afraid of you. You seem to have conjured up evil spirits-yourself creating what you predict. Look I even poor auntyv seems to have fallen under the spell!" The dancing had now ceased, and Aunt Aulchy was moving hither and thither in palpable tribulation. She had something on her mind-a point to be settled, which she was urging, first her husband then her son, and- finally her daughter, to broach to the company. It was ' this: A flag-staff had been recently planted on the green slope above the Factory buildings, and the Fourth of July was the day appointed for -the inauguration of a new and beau- tiful flag which had been brought from " the city." Aunt Aulchy, in virtue of her original proprietorship in the whole domain, felt privileged to mix herself up with everything concerning the establishment, whether she understood it or not. The matter now in hand was to secure one or two orators who, by their eloquent efforts, might contribute to deepen the impression which the august ceremonies of the day were to produce. Her husband had not treated her suggestions with the deference she thought they deserved, and she resolved to act with an independence befitting the occasion. "Well, George," said 39*  &#xD;<pb n="462-463" xml:id="VAC7016-00000232"/> "2       WALTER OGILBY. she, "if you will not speak to some of the gentlemen, I ma ust. " "My dear, had not you better leave the matter to me? When the proper time comes I will select an orator." "No; there is no time like the present. What is that that Solomon says about takin' time by the forelock? II shall speak to Captain Carter first, because he is the greatest stranger. Captain, do you ever make speeches?" The Captain looked as if he did not quite comprehend. "To the ladies? Yes, madam, I must admit that I occasionally find myself so employed. " "No, no not particularly to the ladies-to all the dif- ferent sexes,-men, women, and children."  "Well, then, madam," said the Captain, laughing, "I think I may lay claim to a sort of talent at making a very effective, off-hand speech to a squad of delinquent cadets -one that goes directly to the point, if I may venture to -boast. " "I don't mean that, either," said the good lady, much dis- turbed. "I mean a Fourth of July speech." "Something about the glorious soil of Freedom, and the Star-Spangled Banner, and the Cradle of Liberty," said her husband, coming to her relief. "Rest contented, mother, your eldest son shall do the honors of the occa- sion, without troubling our guest. Then there is one of our workmen, Mr. Stokes, a great advocate for social rights and domestic felicity," here was a sly glance at Ally, "who has volunteered to akbuse his native country for a given space of time, by way of showing his apprecia- tion of his adopted one." Aunt Aulchby professed herself satisfied, and turned her attention once more to the cares of hospitality. 'Alice observed that the cloud had by this time cleared away from the brow of her cousin. Whatever Garret had   WALTER OGI00LBY.        463 been whispering seemed to have troubled her but for a time. She was again all life and spirits, brilliant and graceful-charming to Captain Carter, and once more, to Ally's surprise, particularly kind and attentive to herself. CHAPTER    LV. SUNDAY came-the appointed one on which Mr. Ludlow was to hold service at the village church. Ally had looked forward to this day with especial hope. "In God's own house," had she more than once said to herself, " surely the spirit of peace and reconciliation will descend upon all." She persuaded herself that Mr. Ogilby would no longer feel it right to manifest either coldness or resentment. She even pictured to herself his sorrow and self-reproach that he had allowed a slight misunderstanding, or even an unfriendly representation, to interpose this cloud between them. Ally little dreamed that her note to Mary had been sent by the latter as a message of consolation to poor Michael, and that he,. in the joy of his heart, had shown it to his employer, confident of the satisfaction he would feel that, through whatever efforts, the object for which he had labored in vain was about to be accomplished. She would almost have wished that note unwritten could she have foreseen that her admonition, "Be firm and faithful-do not be persuaded to sacrifice an honest heart that relies on you," would be turned by Mr. Ogilby against himself, and be understood as a proof of her reso- . ,        X  &#xD;<pb n="464-465" xml:id="VAC7016-00000233"/> "4       WALTER OGILBY. lution to think of him no more, but to fulfil conscientiously the promises by which she was bound to another, They were a numerous company at Milbank, when all assembled in readiness to set off for clhurch. Carriage, gig, and dearborn had to be put in requisition, even though Aunt Aulchy, having a few more aches than usual, and a little extra nervousness this morning, felt the ne- cessity of rest and quietness at home. As for Mr. Ellsworth, going to church formed no part of his seventh day's enjoyment. In answer to Ally's per- suasive,-  "Won't you come with us, uncle?" his laughing reply had been,-- "I am afraid, my daughter, there will be no room for nle in that little church. You young folks will fill it up completely. I had better stay at home and give my place to some one who relishes a long sermon, and can get more good out of it than I can." And he slipped quietly away to avoid further importunity. The Ogilbys were already in their places in church when the Milbank party arrived. The entrance of the latter, and particularly the appearance of the three hand- some young officers in their military undress, naturally attracted general observation. Mr. Ogilby raised his eyes from his book as some of the numerous party were pressed close upon him in their way to their own pew. He saw that Alice was for a mo- ment next him-her sleeve nearly brushed his shoulder. Her soft cheek was crimsoning with agitation; her heart beating so violently that its motion was imparted to the light scarf which she wore over her shoulders. Their eyes met. She gave him a hurried and timid salutation as she passed in front of him on her way to the family pew. She believed it was returned, but she could not tell.   WALTER OGILBY.        465 There was a ringing in her ears as if some one had spoken softly to her-perhaps it was Mrs. Ogilby, but she could not well distinguish.         , iMrs. Adriance was beckoning her to come into the seat which she occupied; and, seeing that her uncle's pew was likely to be, too crowded, she obeyed the signal. She re- gretted instantly having done so, for it was a side pew, and so situated that she was in full view of those from whom, at this moment, she most wished to be screened. I To add to her annoyance, John Peter immediately dis- covered that it was a preferable seat to his own, and with- out delay crossed over and placed himself by her side. As if that were not enough, he began a whispered comment on her heightened color, which he attributed to the intol- erable heat of the weather; and having made an unsuccess- ful hunt under the cushions for a fan, deliberately walked back to borrow one from his sister for his cousin's benefit. She hoped he would now permit her to remain quiet and school herself into composure, but no-he must fan lher, find her places for her, and put her almost into a fit of desperation, in his efforts to contribute to her comfort. John Peter was tenderly attached to his cousin. lHe had seen lately that she was changed frorm the gay, frolicksome girl he had known in past years; and fancying that either she was not well, or that she was- homesick, or perhaps at times a little neglected by Gertrude, he believed it incumnbent on him to bestow upon her a double share of devotion whenever she fell to his particular care. Ally saw that the best plan at present was to let him have his own way, while she strove to withdraw her at- tention from outward things and fix them upon the sacred services of the place. She had become quite tranquil by the time the sermon was concluded, the benediction pro- nounced, and the congregation beginning to disperse.  &#xD;<pb n="466-467" xml:id="VAC7016-00000234"/> "6,       WALTER OGILB Y. Mrs. Ogilby- was waiting to speak to her*, and to express her regret that so long a time had passed without bring- ing her to Ffrndale. It was difficult for Alice to reply with firmness, yet she was able to say a few words about "her own wishes," and " her aunt's engagements," and to inquire after Jessie. Gertrude had monopolized -Mr. Ogilby at once. She was saying all the agreeable things possible to him, as they slowly made their way towards the vestibule. Alice saw that lhe glanced back more than once. She was sure he was wishing to speak to her. Captain Carter was waiting to hand Gertrude into the gig, and she had no excuse for hanging behind. As she moved forward Mr Ogilby turned and addressed Alice in a low  tone, and with a tenderness that it was impossible for him to disguise. "You have been ill, Miss Morton,-I am glad to see that you have so nearly recovered." Ally was determined that no effort on her part should be wanting.  She looked up at him with one of her win- ning smiles. "Ought you to have seen it here for the first time?" she said. "Had not a friend of four weeks' standing a right---" She could not finish the sentence. He waited an instant, thhn, in a hurried, incoherent tone, he said,- "It is true-perhaps I  might have indulged-might have consulted my  own happiness at the expense--you must be aware that I ought not  "Come, Ally, we are waiting for you," said John Peter, coming forward, after having handed the other young ladies to the carriage. He took her hand and drew it under his armn, with a look' towards Mr. Ogilby, which the latter interpreted to mean   WALTER OGILB Y.        467 "She belongs to me, sir, if you please!"He drew back at, once. "No, John Peter," said Ally, releasing herself, "I am not to return with you to Milbank. I am going to the doctor's with Mrs. Adriance, for the rest of the day." "I don't like that arrangement at all," said her cousin in a disappointed tone. "If I had not to drive those people, I would invite myself to go there with you, but----" What he added was in a lower tone, so as to be inaudi- ble to Mr. Ogilby, who was still near, but who now turned away to join his mother and sister. So the opportunity was lost. Ally felt that she had raised her courage to the point that she could have asked him what his words meant. Yes, even there, on that spot, she would have sought an explanation. She would have convinced him, she was sure she could have done so, that he labored under- some mistake,--had, been deceived by some misrepresentation. "Yet, what did he imagine? What d uty was he afraid of transgressing? Had he promised his mother not to marry and leave her?" Wild thoughts flitted through Ally's brain. "Could it be that he was fettered by some other engage- ment? But then, honor-should have forbidden his seeking to win her regard as he had done!" It was all, and in a tenfold greater degree than before, a mystery,- a wretched mystery. There was one comfort, however, to Ally,-she was not to return at once to Milbank. She could go,to the quiet, loving circle at the doctor's. There she should, if she wished, be left to her own thoughts, her own striving for submission. She should be released from the chatter and the nonsense which, on the Lord's day as on all others, formed the staple of the conversation in that gay and thoughtless  &#xD;<pb n="468-469" xml:id="VAC7016-00000235"/> "8       WTALTER OGILBY. circle. John Peter had, it is true, signified his intention of returning to convey her home later in the day, when the excessive heat should be over; but she would begr off- she would petition for twenty-four hours more of rest and peace. Not less than that would suffice to tranquillize her agitated feelings, and meet with outward composure the scrutinizing eyes that awaited her at Milbank. Mrs. Ogilby was grieved to observe that- of their simple Sunday dinner, consisting merely of cold meat and fruits, her son showed no disposition to partake. He retired to his own room imnmediately on his return from church, and remained there until disturbed by a message from the old man Ferguson. The latter was much worse, and begged to see Mr. Walter. "You will not think of walking over there this hot after- noon, my son?" said his mother, anxiously, as she saw that he looked pale and exhausted. "No, mother, Patrick may saddle Fingal. I shall prob- ably have to ride up to Dr. Hardenberg's after my visit to the old man. I am afraid, as the doctor has not been down, they forgot to give him the message I left for him last evening." It was late in the afternoon, and the weather had grown cooler, when Mr. Ogilby returned. He reported his pa- tient Tast drawing towards his end--still suffering to such a degree as to require much personal aid, as well as all the "i  spiritual consolation that his young physician could offer. - "I shall stav with himl to-night," said Walter to his mother. "I do not think he can last longer than till morn- ing. I have given him what palliatives are in my power; but I believe I had better see Dr. Hardenberg, and perhaps bring him back with me." He set off at once for the doctor's residence. Three or four gentlemen were sitting upon the piazza, enjoying their   WALTER OGILBY.         469 cigars, as Mr. Ogilby rode past Milbank. He- could not exactly distinguish each member of the group, through his halo of smoke. No ladies were visible--{perhaps they were still indulging in a siesta. He wondered if Miss Morton had yet returned-whether, if he should meet her at the doctor's, he should be able to accost her without any undue exhibition of feeling,- whether, in short, he could address her as calmly as it was his duty to do. No one was in sight as he passeO-lown the avenue which bordered the little lawn before tie doctor's mansion. He turned the angle of the house, and tied his horse near the door of the doctor's office, without meeting a person. He could have entered the office and rung the bell, but that would look too formal in an old friend,-it was better to proceed at once to the house. He stepped up at the end- of the piazza, and passed along it towards the open door of the large "hall, not doubting that he should find there some of the family seated, to catch the first cool breeze of declining day. No one was there. He entered a few steps, and as he did so his eye glanced in at the open door of the parlor. Alice was just entering it from an apartment beyond; but she evidently did not perceive him. She had in her arms the infant of Mrs. Adriance, a beautiful babe of some six months old. Her cheek had lost the flush with which he had seen it mantled in the morning-she was now quite pale. He gazed with a beating heart as the child nestled down against her curls, some of which it grasped in its tiny hand. He thought he hadD never seen so lovely a picture. Suddenly some one approached her from the opposite direction. It was young Ellsworth, who had been seated 40 k  &#xD;<pb n="470-471" xml:id="VAC7016-00000236"/> 470       WALTER OGILBY. upon a sofa behind the door. His animated exclamation was,- "That boy is too heavy for you, Ally,-give him to me." And he took the child front her arms. The little fellow did not relish being taken from his favorite. He turned and stretched out his hands, making an effort to reach her. To reconcile him to the change, the young gentleman commenced a somewhat rough play, now tossing him high, and again stooping him so as to bring his cheek in contact with Ally's. A deathly pang shot through the heart of Mr. Ogilby. 'Such will she be in his home?' thought he. "Such must she never be in mine! No such sweet charities will cheer and comfort me in my lonely journey through life!" He turned, and, unheard, unheeded, walked back and entered the doctor's office. All there was still and som- bre-the windows nearly darkened by the closed lattices. He threw himself into a chair by the table, and buried his face on his folded arms. He had need of solitude and silence-he had need of resolution and prayer-to still the tempest of his feelings, to subdue the bitterness, the al- most rebellion, that rose up at the contemplation of all that he had lost. But Walter Ogilby was a Christian. He did not yield in the fierce conflict. He put from him the suggestion that strove to make itself heard,-"She is not indifferent to me-I can yet win her-her happiness is of more consequence than that of her cousin-his feelings are not deep, and he would be easily consoled, but my disappointment is for a lifetime." No: he did not reason in this way. Believing that the woman he loved dearer than life itself belonged to another, bound by the promises of years, he never for a moment proposed to take her from him. This bitter cup was the discipline necessary for his soul, and he would strive to drink it in all submission and humility.   WA4LTER OGILBF        471 471 From tie deep abstraction of these thoughts he was roused by a hand laid kindly on his shoulder. He had not heard the doctor enter; and, as he now looked up, the latter was struck by the change that a few weeks had wrought. The fair, handsome brow was beginning to be crossed by deep lines, and the dark-gray eyes, once so full of anima- tion, had quite lost their attractive lustre. "81alter, ny dear boy I this will never do,' said the doctor, in a broken voice. "You must not grieve in this manner. I know that it is hard to bear-that it is seldom one meets with such a loss. But your health will give way if you allow yourself to dwell too much upon it-and con- sider! What will then become of your mother and sisters?" "You are right, my dear friend," said the young man, who had by this time recovered nearly his ordinary man- ner; "I must, as you say, be a man, and submit to whatis inevitable. Let us talk of something else-I came on business." He entered with resolution upon what he had to say of the case of poor Ferguson, the consultation ending in the doctor's acceding to his request to accompany him back to Ferndale. "But won't you go in first and see Aunt Lany and the rest of them?" asked the doctor, hospitably. Not this evening, if you will excuse me. I shall come and say good by to them before we leave." "You are really going, then?" "Yes; I shall stay by poor Ferguson to the last. It  cannot be long. Probably by the time all is over, Michael's matters will be comfortably settled,-they seem now in tlain for being so. After that, there will be nothing to keep ie." "And your mother and sisters?", "  hey will accompany me, and we shall probably not return while-that is, we shall stay away until September."

His first impulse had been to open upon her with reproaches, but there was an expression in her countenance that disarmed him. He only shook his head and said to himself, "There is something in it which I cannot understand. The poor child is not happy-that is certain." Ally carried her point of remaining with her'friends until the next day. Her spirits improved as she pondered on Mr. Ogilby's words and manner during their short in- terview in the church. She could not but gather from them that his regard was unchanged--that she was still important to his happiness. Her buoyant, sanguine spirit whispered that he would contrive means of resuming the explanation which John Peter had, so inopportunely, broken off. "What passed then was but the harbinger of the sun- shine that Mr. HLalford promised," said she; " but, oh I the cloud is long in clearing away!" Gertrude was greatly pleased to hear Mr. Halford pro- pose the next morning to drive to the doctor's and bring Miss Morton home. This young gentleman had found many subjects to occupy his thoughts since the day before, although, to tell the truth, they all related to the one grand object of interest. He was very impatient, in the first place, to observe what effect the interview in the vestibule of the church had had upon Alice. She had smiled in re- plying to Mr. Ogilby, that was a good symptom-it in-  f   WALTER OGILBY.        473 dicated a heart tranquil and without disquietude! After- wards, he had seen Mr. Ogilby riding towards the village, doubtless to call at the doctor's. Mr. Halford's heart sunk. Mr. Ogilby would not be making a visit of pleasure or politeness on the Lord's day; he must be going, as a mat- ter of conscience, to fulfil the duty of asking pardon and seeking a reconciliation! And Mr. Halford doubted not for a moment that pardon and reconciliation would promptly be accorded. lHe blamed himself for the satisfaction with which he heard from John Peter, on his return, that he had not seen Mr. Ogilby since they parted on the church steps in the morningl Alice's manner when they met was frank and cordial, and this he treasured as a happy augury. He flattered himself that she was getting o(er the most poignant of her feelings of disappointment,-tat having met Mr. Ogilby, and exchanged a few words with him, she was calmly re- solving to dismiss him from her memory. Mr. Halford was, however, too wise to take advantage of the first favor- able symptom. He would neither by word nor deed seek to place himself at present on any other footing than that of a kind, attentive friend. Ally was welcomed by her aunt with her usual warm demonstrations of affection. "Oh, Ally, my dear!" said she, "I am so glad to see you back, you don't know. It has been terribly lonesome without you 1"o "How could that be, with a house fall of conmpany? Oh, aunty I you are trying to flatter me!" said Ally, with a smile. "No, indeedl I you ask Mr. Halford if we did not say -yesterday what a monstrous long day Sunday was, and how dismal it- seemed to have you gone. We was a sittin' in the parlor here together at the wery time. Gitty 40*  &#xD;<pb n="474-475" xml:id="VAC7016-00000238"/> 474       WALTER OGILB:. is so taken up with Captain Carter, and Anne Eliza with that other young man, Lieutenant What's-his-name, and Catlyna, she'd gone away up-stairs to set all alone by her- self. I declare, if it hadn't been for Cornel'us' comin' home just then, I don't know what we should have donIe-do you, Mr. Halford?" Cornelius had returned to add to the life and bustle of the house. He was in fine spirits and full of plans and projects for the morrow--" the glorious Fourth." Alice hoped it would occur to him to propose going to Ferndale to see his young friends, and to bring back all that he could glean of what was going oil among them. She was dis- appointed to hear him say he must be off to Newhurg at an early hour, to lay in a store of crackers, fireworks, and gunpowder, with which to manifest his patriotism on the following day. "If you had been going to Ferndale," said she, when they were alone, "I would have given you a parcel to take to Mrs. Ogilby's-a couple of books that-were lent me." "I may stop as I come back; but Mr. Barton is going with me now to help me select the things. He thinks himself a good judge of powder, I suppose. So I had bet- ter not take the books this time. But, Ally, why don't you go and carry them yourself? The girls were com- plaining the last time I was there of your never coming." "I shall, of course, go whenever your mother does; but you know she is of late almost always occupied." "Well, then, get somebody else to go with you. Here is Mr. Halford," as that young gentleman entered the room; "t he will drive you to Ferndale at any time, won't you, Mr. Halford?" "Certainly, if Miss Morton wishes it," replied he, look- ing at her inquiringly. "Oh, no, no," she hastened to say, with an air of as much   WALTER OGILBY         475 indifference as she could assume; "I was only wishing to return a couple of books. Cornelius will take them for me, I dare say, some other time." Ally had a stropg impression that Mr. Ogilby would call at Milbank this day. "Surely he will not suffer matters to rest in this state after what passed yesterday," she more than once said to herself. But the day wore on, and still he did not come. Lieutenant Barton returned unaccompanied by Cornelius. The latter hal stopped at Ferndale, intending, after a short visit to his friends there, to walk home by the path along the banks of the creek. "Now I shall at least hear all about him. Perhaps he will drive Cornelius home, instead of suffering him to walk," said Ally; and she went to her own room and busied herself there, that her agitation might be apparent to no one. Cornelius returned to bring an added disappointment. He had seen Mrs. Ogilby and her two daughters, and had sat an hour with them. Mr. Ogilby was in his own room; they believed he had gone to take some rest, as he had watched all night with poor old Ferguson. "He did not come home," his sisters said, "until long after breakfast, for the poor old man was dying, and could' not bear that Walter should leave him for a moment. So he had stayed until all was over, and now his mother had persuaded him to take care of himself, for he was far from being as well as Dusual." "So kind, so' tender to everybody,-to all but me i" sighed Ally. There was disappointment in Cornelius' news; but yet there was consolation. How could he be expected to leave a fellow-creature in that suffering state? It would have been inhuman to do so. Ally tried to feel glad that  &#xD;<pb n="476-477" xml:id="VAC7016-00000239"/> 476       WALTER OGILBYI he had not forsaken his duty, even to call upon her. She wondered if the fatigue and anxiety he had undergone would make him really ill. She supposed his mother and sisters would take the best of care of him ; but would they remember to send for Dr. Hardenberg the first moment anything serious should be the matter? She did not think she should mind asking the doctor how Mr. Ogilby was, the next time he called. The doctor would not be likely to tell her without her asking, for somehow he never talked to her now of his friend Walter as he formerly had been in the habit of doing. CHAPTER    LVII. AT an early hour the following morning Cornelius was astir. His first demonstration was a salute on a small swivel with which he had the day before provided him- self, and with which, by planting it on the opposite side of the street and aiming it carefully at the front windows of his cousins' apartment, he contrived to give them such a fright that first one head and then another appeared in full view in curl-papers and night-cap standing on end. Whether the consternation depicted on the young ladies' countenances or the genuine spirit of patriotism prompted the jubilant huzzas and the full chorus of,- "Cornstalks twist your hair, Cart-wheels run round ye! Old Simon carry ye off, And mortar-pestle pound ye!" could not well be determined; but they were given "with a will" by all the young throats that Cornelius had been   WALTER OGILBY.        4 able to press into his service, and they were effectual in rousing all the young gentlemen and bringing them down to share the fun. The men were all boys again; for there  is something wonderfully contagious in the popping off of squibs, fire-crackers, or any other small artillery on a Fourth of July morning. The more imposing ceremonies were to take place early after breakfast, in order to avoid the excessive heat of the mid-day sun. The young ladies, therefore, made their appearance at table in toilets suitable to the season and the occasion. Breakfast was hardly over before hosts of cousins and friends, to whom due notice had been given, began to arrive, and among the earliest were Mr. Teunis and his sister. Many families of the neighboring farmers, and all the work-people were upon the ground which had been selected as the place of celebration-a pleasant green slope above the Factory, with the new flag-staff, or liberty- pole, as it was deemed more patriotic to call it, standing bare in the centre. The "Declaration of Independence" was to be read, speeches were to be made, and a collation to be partaken of under an arbor of boughs which the Fac- tory-people had been at the pains to construct beneath a group of wide-spreading trees. As the Milbank party were making their way towards. the appointed spot, a heavy sort of lumber-wagon was ob- served turning down the lane that led to the Factory. A sun-burnt, travel-soiled woman, and several children, were mounted on trunks and boxes behind the driver, and were gazing with wonder on the scene around them. They were evidently strangers. Mr. Ellsworth quitted the company and walked forward to make some inquiries. Aunt Aul- chy, not satisfied at being thus unceremoniously transferred from her husband's arm to that of Cornelius, said, in an excited tone,-  &#xD;<pb n="478-479" xml:id="VAC7016-00000240"/> 478       WALTER OGILBY. "Why, what can George be after now? The dear knows! As if people like that could not find their way without his help!" Ally looked back. Her uncle was in earnest conversa- tion with the new-comers; and, on turning- a second time to look, she saw him, to her great surprise, escorting the whole party to his own mansion. Luckily, Aunt Aulchy was too much engaged in taking an observation of all be- fore her to think long of what was behind; she was, there- fore, spared a world of curiosity and impatience at her husband's unusual proceedings. The large concourse of people looked gay and cheerful in their holiday garb. Some of the company found seats, but the greater number were compelled to stand. Mr. Halford's arm was ready at Ally's service. He seemed to assume it as his privilegre to hold her parasol, and to act as her screen from the sun, which was now beginning to make itself felt in all the radiance of a July morning. They were still waiting the return of Mr. Ellsworth; and, in the mean time, John Peter, who had also taken his station by her side, pointed out to Alice -the different personages most conspicuous in the assembled company. "There, Ally, that is old Carroll-that little man with the broad, solemn face, in a black coat and drab small- clothes. How self-satisfied and patriotic he looks!, That is his wife beside him, trying to make Tom and that other urchin behave themselves. Their pretty daughter is not with them. I feel as much interested in her as you do, Ally, since you told me her story. I have almost made up my mind to give that Stokes a thrashing, or hire some meaner person to do it. There he is! that is lhe-that fel- low with a flashy waistcoat and great watch-chain and seals, which he thinks make him a gentleman, I suppose. Look at his eye! Is it not a mean, wicked one? I never   WALTE'R OGILBIE.       479 saw rogue more plainly written in a face; and for him to undertake to make a Fourth of July speech I Positively, I am ashamed of my own office in such company." "What is this? What is it all about? Tell me the story; won't you?" said Mr. Halford to Alice. "Not now--wait until we go home. See, they, are about to commence!" In fact, a message had just been brought from Mr. Ellsworth requesting that the exercises should be no longer delayed, as he would join the company immediately. The "Declaration of Independence'" having, in accord- ance with immemorial custom, been read by the scholar: pronounced by old Carroll best fittedffor the office, its con- clusion was honored by three hearty cheers, and these ac- clamations were enthusiastically repeated as the new, handsome flag was at this moment observed waving in the air above the heads of the astonished and admiring spec- tators. In the excitement of the moment, it escaped the observa- tion of the company that Mr. Ellsworth had approached the ground, in the rear of the crowd, accompanied by the shabbv woman and three well-grown children, whom he stationed quietly in the shelter of a group of the work- people. Something he whispered to one of the older hands near, who gave a smile of intelligence, and for a minute or two regarded the new-comers with interest. The finale of the inspiring "Star-Spangled Banner," in which the whole company, by a spontaneous impulse, had, united their voices with the rich, well-trained ones of the Factory Choir, was the signal for the commencement of the young officer's address. 1His remarks were brief, but appropriate, and, as was becoming, were received with enthusiastic approbation, as doubtless they would have been had they possessed no J  &#xD;<pb n="480-481" xml:id="VAC7016-00000241"/> 480       WALTER OGIL BY. merit whatever. From a handsome young soldier, the son of the proprietor, they elicited a meed of applause sufficient to satisfy the maternal pride even of Aunt Aulchy. It was now Mr. Stokes' turn. He took his station at the foot of the flag-staff, and with head thrown back, one foot advanced, and his hand carelessly playing with his watch- seals, he commenced. His oration was, as might have been expected, a furious tirade against monarchies in gen- eral, but that of his native land in particular; yet, in the same breath, he lauded Napoleon, "the usurper" (he said, quoting his favorite pamphleteer), as the "Guelphs, among others, have the impudence to call him." He bespoke the detestation of all right-minded, patriotic Americans for a country whose very atmosphere breathed oppression; whose inhabitants were divided into but two classes-tyrants and slaves. He congratulated himself that destiny had conducted him to a land where freedom for all, even the meanest, was the watch-word, and the one grand, governing prin- ciple; where every man might sit under his own vine and his own fig-tree, with none to molest or make him afraid. There was great cheering at this, for every one believed it-even Mr. Halford. The orator wound up by declaring that, "should it ever be his happy lot, as he fervently prayed, to secure on this favored soil a spot which he could call his home, and to be blessed with endearing domestic ties, it would be his proudest aim to rear up those who after him should be ready to pour out their hearts' blood in support and de- fence of the glorious tree of Liberty, whose emblem now waved so proudly aloft." Tremendous applause followed this outhurst. "There's for your grandchildren T" whispered the wool-   WALTER OGILBY.        481 481 scourer to Barney Carroll. The old man drew himself up, and tried not to look too proud and pleased. "Very fine, very fine," said he. "Nobody can deny that Misther Stokesis a born orator. But who are those that Squire Ellsworth is leading up to him? And what is that he is saying?', Mr. Ellsworth's words were sufficiently audible to most of the company. "Providence has vouchsafed a speedy answer to your prayer, Mr. Stokes. It has sent your wife and children across the water to greet you at this auspicious moment, and to sit down with you under your vine and your fig- tree, in your happy, adopted country." Stokes was for a moment struck dumb, as his emplover presented the weary, haggard-looking mother, and the children who would hardly be restrained from rushing to- wards him. "Woman!" he at length ejaculated with an oath, "what brought you here?" "What broot me here?" repeated she, in a strong York- shire accent; "what should bring me, but to foind the fay- ther of my bairns? The mon who spent and wasted all the goold my poor fayther left me-soold my bit lond, and then stool away, and left us to want and sorrow. Oh! Jan Stookes! Jan Stookes! did ye think I 'oodn't foind ye an' ye war' aboove groond?" She looked the picture of resolute determination, though the tears stood in her eyes. "Why, Barnev Carroll, man!" said Losee, the boarding- house keeper, who, it may be remarked, owed the old man something of a grudge for having enticed away one of his most profitable boarders, "what do you say now to your fine son-in-law? This is the chap, I'm told, that is to marry your daughter Mfary." "  &#xD;<pb n="482-483" xml:id="VAC7016-00000242"/> 482       WALTER OGILBY. "Marry my daughter!" cried the old man, with a look of the most superlative indignation and contempt; "no in- deed! Thanks to a kind Providence that never neglects its faithful,-I mean its poor, humble, unworthy servants, my daughter is engaged to be married to an uncommonly fine young man that ye all know, Michael Byrne. I sup- pose I should say Mr. Michael Byrne, seeing he is head- gardener to that fine, honorable, young gentleman, Mr. Walter Ogilby. And it's likely ye may all have heard how his employer is building him a house, and is to give him a matter of six hundred a year by way of salary; for he knows that a daughter of mine should expect to have all things about her genteel and comfortable. And I should like to see the man," said he, looking fiercely round, "who'd take it upon him to say that a child of mine was to sit down with a profane, ungodly, ill-to-do Englishman like that I I'd give them to know she's been better brought up than all that comes to." So saying, he tucked his wife's arm under his own, and disappeared from the ground be- fore the laugh became general against him. As for Stokes, with a crest-fallen air, yet with an occa- sional glance of surly defiance on all around, he carried off his wife and children to seek without delay some vine or fig-tree under which to bestow them. Ally had witnessed the whole scene with a countenance radiant with delight. She could hardly refrain from clap- ping her hands as Tom Carroll, taking advantage of his father's exit, raised the shout, "Hur-rah! for Michael Byrne!"To which some of his young compeers, in a spirit of compliment, added,- "Hur-rah for Mary Carroll l" "Good luck to them both!" "May they live all the days of their life, and as much longer as the Lord plases!" "I think I must have the story now," said Mr. Halford,   WALTER OGILBY.        483 gazing with earnest admiration at Ally's flushed cheek and spa rkliing eyes. "It would be too cruel, certainly, to keep you longer in suspense,' replied she; and she recounted to hm all the particulars of Mary's history,--her long attachment, the persecution of her father and this man Stokes, and her filial submission. Mr. Ogilby's kindness was not forgotten; and Ally secretly congratulated herself upon the firmness with which she was able to give this part of the story. "My uncle, when I told him how 'latters stood, had promised to interfere, and prevent poor Mary from being sacrificed; but see how a kind Providence has taken the matter out of our hands, and so ordered it that there is now no possibility of that wicked man's troubling her peace in future. As for Mary's father, it is easy to foresee that pride will urge him to hasten her marriare with Michael, lest the unkindness with which he has treated his daughter, and the folly he meditated in marrying her to Stokes, should come to be currently believed among his acquaintance.", CIIAPTER     LVIII. ON the return of the party to the house, it was sug- gested by some of the company that no better afternoon than this could be chosen for the ascent of the North Beacon. A few cried out against the scheme, on account of the heat, and with these Ally's feelings prompted her to con- cur; it was, however, urged by others that there wojld be no use in waiting for a cooler day, unless it was intended - -   &#xD;<pb n="484-485" xml:id="VAC7016-00000243"/> 484       -WALTER OGILBY. to put off the party until October. Gertrude quietly re- marked that the leave of absence granted to their military visitors would expire in a day or two-three or four cousins came in aid with the assertion that the path up the mount- ain was cool and shady, and so forth and so forth. The voices in favor of the project prevailed. "I am glad you interposed no obstacle," said John Peter, in a low voice, to Ally. "We have promised to show our friends here all that is worth seeing, and we must make the best use of-our time. It will not do to be dilly-dally- ing, for you know I may be called away at any moment. As soon as a letter arrives I am off. Let the contents be what they may, I go to Ashfield.7" Amid a good deal of discussion, loud talking, and laugh- ing (for when in high spirits young people will talk and laugh loud, unrefined and inelegant though it be), it was finally settled that the company should rendezvous at Squire Vandervoort's, as the spot nearest the foot of the mountain. It was mutually agreed that they would walk moderately, so as not to fatigue themselves, an'd that, after their descent of the mountain, the party would all take tea with Miss Maria Benthouse. Not the least interesting part of the arrangement was Miss Maria's concluding stroke,- "And I will send for all the other young people, the Van Nesses and Ogilbys, to meet you." The necessary preparations were to be made by the Mil- bank young ladies for changing their dress at "the Or- chards," after their return from their walk, in order to appear becomingly at Miss Maria's entertainment in the evening. Mr. Halford had been one of those most strongly opposed to the selection of this hot day for the excursion. Finding himself in the minority, he took occasion, while the minor   WALTER OGILB.          485 485 details were being discussed, to say, in a quiet way, to Mr. "I do not think Miss Morton is, by any means, strong enough for this sort of undertaking, which must, of course be very fatiguing. Is it not possible to ascend the mount ain on horseback?, "(Certainly-it is very often done." The reply was made with due gravity, although Mr. Teunis felt a strong disposition to indulge himself in a smile, a whistle,and an ' Oh I ho--that's it, is it?" "I should be a little afraid of Cornelius' pony, particu- larly indescending," continued the y ounggentleman; "it does not appear to me quite sure-footed, or I ould pro- pose it to Miss Morton, since it seems decided that we are to go.

No-he was, by his own request, buried in -a spot that he had selected on his own little farm. It was a solemn office reading the Burial Service under the quiet, lonely old chestnut-trees." Ah I true--you have no minister here, except now and then. And Dominie Hasbrook, I remember, does not like to read your church service-not but what it is, upon the whole, as good as his own prayers," said Mr. Teunis. "Well," with a solemn air, "death is a serious thing-a very serious thing And now," brightening up, "I have a little errand of my own." "W ait a moment, brother. I have not got my answer yet," interposed his sister. Mr. Ogilby still hesitated. The longing wish to be again in the presence of the object of his affections; to hear her voice; to exchange, perhaps for the last time, a few words with her, had well-nigh overpowered his stern, conscientious resolution of seeing her no more. "Was not, after all, some explanation due to her? Her manner in the vestibule of the church the day before had certainly been such as to imply that she was unaware of the cause of his withdrawal from her society. Would it not be an allowable relief to his mind to learn that she had not designedly inflicted this wound upon his peace?" While he was revolving these questions in his mind, Mr. Teunis, growing impatient, hastened to add what was uppermost in his own. "We are all going up the mountain this afternoon, and we should be very glad if you and your sister would be of the party. Perhaps you will feel as if you could meet us at Squire Vandervoort's, where we are all to be at three o'clock. And now, there's another thing," drawing near,   WALTER OGILBY.        487 and speaking in a low, confidential tone: a certain young gentleman of our acquaintance is in a fever of anxiety lest Miss Morton should find the fatigue too great, or lest the rough road should hurt her little, dainty feet, or something of the kind, and he has made up his mind that she must ride instead of walking. Cornelius' pony, one would think, might answer the purpose; but no-it may stumble, or it may be vicious, or it may pull upon the bridle, or what not! You know what notions will get into a poor fellow's head under these circumstances; or if you don't, you will one of these days," said Mr. Teunis, with a pleasant laugh. "And so," continued he, "I have undertaken to get a nice, easy palfrey to carry our sweet, young lady in the safest and gentlest manner possible; for, to tell the truth, she looks as if she would not bear as much as some of the rest of US. ' "If you would like my sister's horse, it is entirely at your service," said Mr. Ogilby. "I will have it sent to Mr. Vandervoort's to be in readiness for you." "And will you not meet us there?" "It will be impossible. I am afraid you will find the heat quite overpowering," he added, somewhat abruptly. "Oh! we will take care of ourselves; or rather, we will take care of the ladies, which is the main point. But you will allow us to expect you and your sister in the evening, even though you do not accompany us in our walk?" "You must excuse us-it will be quite out of our power." "Well, at any rate you can get your spy-glass, and take a look at us as we make our appearance now and then in the openings among the trees. You will have the pleasure of seeing our little friend seated upon her graceful steed, and a gallant young man keeping fast by the bridle, like a knight and his lady-love in the olden time."  &#xD;<pb n="488-489" xml:id="VAC7016-00000245"/> 488  -WALTER OGILBY. And the obliging old bachelor laughed heartily at a con- ceit which was by no means to the taste of his auditor. Miss Maria could only regret that her invitation should be so positively declined. She hardly thought her friend Walter's having attended the funeral of old Ferguson that morning, a valid excuse. She was disappointed, but there was no help for it; therefore, after an interchange of a few more civilities, she and her brother took their leave. "This is friend Teunis' own doings," said Mr. Ogilby to himself, as, in order to recover in some degree his outward composure, he set out on a solitary stroll along the banks of the stream. "Ellsworth would never have condescended to ask even so small a favor of me. His manner shows that he is fully aware of the position in which we stand to each other. Has Alice told him? Does she know it her- self, or is she still unsuspicious and innocent?" Warm as was the day, he walked and walked, until he was suddenly aroused from his musings by the quick, light step of some one approaching. It was Michael. The joy beaming from the honest fellow's eyes told his story even before he opened his lips. "Oh, sir good news 1" cried he. "Blessed be God, the old man has consented." Michael did not say this irrever- ently-it was a devout thanksgiving from the very depths of his heart. "Mary is mine-there is no gainsaying itl Stokes' wife and children have arrived from the old country,-the old man gives her to me freely. They sent Tommy to fetch me, but I could not stir a step without coming first to you, sir, to tell you of my happiness." He grasped the hand that Mr. Ogilby extended to him. It is no shame to their manhood to say that tears stood in the eyes of both. "Oh, sir!" exclaimed Michael, "I'll never be quite   WALTER OGILBY.        489 happy till I see you the same as myself. You are not it now; but what does that beautiful young lady say, in the note she wrote to comfort us? 'Be patient, and God will bring all things right.' Indeed and indeed, sir, it seems wrong for me to feel light-hearted till the cloud that is hanging over you has passed away 1" Mr. Ogilby wrung the hand of his humble friend. "Thank you, Michael," said he, after a moment's silence. "It may be God's will that I shall never know the happi- ness he is now granting you-if so, He will give me strength to bear a different lot. Next to being happy our- selves, is the satisfaction of seeing others happy, and that is a blessing that God is now vouchsafing me! You must give my best wishes to Mary, and tell her that if I am not at her wedding it will not be from any want of sympathy in her welfare and yours. And now, hurry on to her, for I know she is waiting for you." "She will understand what is keeping me," said Michael, as with a light, bounding step he disappeared on the path which led to Barney Carroll's.        The MLBANK CARRY-ALL-as it was duly labelled upon its bright, blue pannels, a huge vehicle capable of holding twelve persons-was put in requisition to transport the party, like so many bales of wool, to their place of rendezvous. Aunt Aulchy had added herself to the group. "Are you going up the mountain, mother?" asked Cor- nelius in undisguised astonishment, as he saw her stand- ing beside the conveyance, ready to be hoisted in. "No: Teuny Benthouse had not the politeness to ask me," said his mother, in an injured tone. "Not but what I have as good a right up there as he, or anybody he may choose to inwite." "Probably he thought an invitation would be mere LrW    &#xD;<pb n="490-491" xml:id="VAC7016-00000246"/> "O       WALTER OGILBY. words of course; he must have known you would not ac- cept it," said her daughter. "The least he could do, was to give me the privilege of declinin'," replied the mother. "I don't thank him for doin' it for me. Nobody likes to have it taken for granted they'll refuse, and so they be left out. It's just like Teuny Benthouse! When he gets among the young girls, he quite forgets what's due to people a little older. It would be a great deal more dignified if he kept more among those of his own age. Miss Maria is wery different. She asked me to go to her house this evenin' and I shall." "There will be no old people there but yourself," re- marked her daughter, politely; but as this observation produced no change in her mother's determination, the con- versation dropped. Alice was a good deal disconcerted when informed by Mr. Teunis, who stood ready at the door of Squire Van- dervoort's to receive them, of the arrangements that had been made for her especial accommodation. However grateful she might feel to Mr. Halford for his solicitude for her comfort, she had no fancy for being singled out as the one unable to bear the fatigue which others would find endurable. She negatived, at once, the proposition of ascending the mountain on horseback. "No, she pre- ferred walking with' the rest. She was well and strong. What would her Connecticut friends think, if they should hear of her putting on airs, and pretending to be an in- valid?" The horse was at this moment brought round. "What a beautiful creature!" exclaimed she, surveying the animal with admiration. "Is not that Agnes Ogilby's Fair Star?" inquired Ger- trude, in surprise.

I am glad things are smooth between you, for he certainly is, after all, a very fine fellow. I shall go and call there to-morrow, andperhaps we shall meet at Briar Lodge this evening. Miss Maria said she should invite them, you remember. " Ally would have been glad to believe her coUsib's con- jecture true-that all things were indeed smooth between her and Mr. Ogilby. She would have rejoiced to feel assured of meeting him in the evening at Briar Lodge; but of both the one and the other, she was forced to admit with a sigh there was still far from a certainty. CHAPTER LIX. THE ascent of the North Beacon was an enterprise of no trifling magnitude. We might marvel at the readiness with which those to whom the scenery was no novelty, and who possessed moreover little taste for the picturesque, had undertaken it, could we not, each of us, recall a time in our own youthful experience when the prospect of just such an expedition, the anticipation of a good deal of fun, a little flirtation, or perhaps something of still more sober happi- ness, had sutfced to dispel all apprehension of fatigue, heat, dast, or any other annoyance. dust, or any et11 ."1;^     should think her less Alice was resolved that no one should think her less cheerful, less brave than the others, and Mr. salford hav- ing manceuvred to establish himself as her escort, they all set forth. Their walk, after the first short half mile over level ground, was at times littlemore than a scramble, so   WALTER OGILBY.        493 steep was the path-and often, from fatigue and exhaustion were the party obliged to pause to recruit their forces. Although for a great portion of the way shaded with dense overhanging foliage, there were not wanting spots where a sudden opening gave lovely views of the valley beneath. Alice, with her enthusiastic love for the beauties of nature, and Mr. Halford, with his artist tastes, could not resist the temptation of frequently stopping to admire and to enjoy. At rare intervals a cabin or hut was seen in the midst of a small clearing, the occupants of which, gazing from open doors, or peeping round some projecting corner, regarded the pedestrians with looks of surprised, vulgar curiosity. All traces of cultivation disappeared as they approached the summit, and the scenery became more rugged and bare. The impression produced upon Alice by these majestic and lofty solitudes was new and strange. She said,- "What a solemn, lonely feeling creeps over the spirit as we toil up among these grand old rocks and woods! It seems as if we were somehow connected with past ages! Those gray, mossy cliffs, like vast tombstones--how they speak to us of a race long since passed away! The echoes even of the merry voices above us sound as if the spirits of the departed were calling back to earth!" "You describe, I believe, the feeling of all who for the first time visit wild, elevated, solitary scenes like these--of all, I should rather say, who possess a sensibility to aught in the glorious world around them. These monuments of ancient time, which the transforming hand of man has not yet reached, do indeed form a connecting link with the days and the generations that have passed away. They are the only antiquities in our young, fresh country. We have no ruins, no monuments!" "Iow much it is to be lamented," said Ally, "that so 42  &#xD;<pb n="494-495" xml:id="VAC7016-00000248"/> "4       WALTER OGILBJ l few legends and traditions have been preserved to give to our mountains, woods, and streams an interest beyond that with which nature has invested them!" "' Deidrich Knickerbocker,' and a few other admirable writers, have begun to collect treasures of this kind," replied Mr. Halford, " and their country will owe them an inesti- mable debt of gratitude for their labors! But you are over- tasking yourself-you are not equal to this fatigue," said he, anxiously. "We have here just at this point a fine view of the country at our feet-would not our most pru- dent plan be to find a seat and remain here, without attempting to reach the summit?" "No, no," said Alice, resolutely. "Let us go on-I feel quite rested now." And they once more resumed their course up the steep, rugged path. When they at length came out upon the top of the mount- ain, and met the cool refreshing breeze which seldom fails to play around and along its crest, every sensation of fatigue seemed in a moment dissipated. The magnificent panorama at their feet enchained the attention of the whole party. Even the most thoughtless were for a few minutes silent with admiration. At length one and another broke forth into exclamations. "How like a beautiful picture!" "I could never have dreamed of anything so grand, yet so lovely!" "Look at the variegated carpet at our feet--the mills, and meadows, and country-seats!" "And the beautiful villages scattered on both banks, with the old Hudson rolling his glorious flood through their midst. I do not recognize the justice of the Leather-stocking's simile,' like a curled shaving.' I should rather compare it to a stream of molten silver!" Such was Captain Carter's comment. Those most familiar with the scene were soon pointing out the different features in the prospect. * . . . . v.#v. ........... i   WALTER OCILBY.        495 "There are the Catskills, Ally You can just discern the Mountain House in the midst of the Pine Orchard near the summit!" And John Peter produced a pocket-glass which Mr. Halford carefully adjusted to enable his companion to get the best view. "It is nonsense to imagine you can see anything more of the house than just the reflection of the sun shining on its windows," said Anne Eliza. "And here, Ally," said John Peter, not condescending to notice the last remark, "still nearer you can see King- ston, and Esopus, and Po'kepsie, and NewhurgtI How beautiful Waldorf looks, resting on the broad, glittering waters just below us I Milbank is shut out by that pro- jecting knob-but here you can see Orchards and Fern- dale." Alice had withdrawn her arm from that of Mr. Hal- ford. He had contrived her a seat-a rough one, it is true -at the foot of the flag-staff. But she could not remain long seated. She longed to walk apart by herself, away from the observation of those by whom she was sur- rounded. Memories, which would not be repressed, came rushing tumultuously,-thoughts were swelling at her heart, and forcing the tears which would not be prisoned back. Again she seemed to hear the whispered words of Mr. Ogilby, "When you are told that yonder faint blue line of hills is Connecticut-is your home-will you try and feel that that spot does not contain all there is in this world to love or care for?" Then, far away in the east, as she gazed, she could dis- cern her distant native hills,-they, indeed, no longer contained all the world for her. Down at her feet, nestled among its clusters of foliage, its rich hanging willows, its  &#xD;<pb n="496-497" xml:id="VAC7016-00000249"/> "6       WALTER OGILBY. vines and shrubberies, was Ferndale,-the spot where he was! That was now her world! A barrier had been raised between them-it might be a wall of adamant, or it might be a veil of gossamer which a breath would have power to blow aside. One moment, one word, one question, might suffice.- But would those ever be vouchsafed her? Would he come this evening to Briar Lodge, or would he still turn coldly away? Mr. Halford was again approaching her, and she must subdue all appearances of agitation. Some traces of emo- tion she knew were still visible-to account for these she began talking of her home. "I wonder if, far away in that little corner of the world, they are thinking of me at this moment!" "I believe I may venture to answer that there are few moments in which Miss Morton is absent from the thoughts of her. friends. I freely confess that I am occupied with little else than how to get her safely down this steep road again, to a comfortable, quiet resting-place." "The quiet," said Ally, looking around her, "is, I sus- pect, what we must not anticipate for some hours to come. I could almost envy the joyous spirits by which our com- panions are borne above toils and fatigues, of which I confess I am not insensible." "One would hardly have expected to hear Miss Morton envying another that which has been so great a charm in herself!" Mr. Halford regretted, instantly, his observation, as he observed Alice turn away with a changing countenance. She was saved the necessity of a reply by the general movement of the rest of the party, who, having accom- plished as much admiration, mirth, and nonsense as time and circumstance permitted, were now preparing for a re- turn to the plain below. 1 i' I         *              1igi 1WALTER OGILBY.               497 Spite of their high spirits, the young ladies were, one and all, obliged to confess to an overpowering sense of fatigue and exhaustion by the time they arrived at the Orchards. For the last half mile they had dragged their weary feet with the slow pace of an overloaded wain at harvest. Ally, from being unaccustomed to exertions of the kind, felt their effects most sensibly,-she even feared that she should yield entirely, and find herself unable to keep her engagement with Miss Maria. A half hour's repose, how- ever, and a refreshing cup of tea, which the kind-hearted Cousin Letty and her five equally kind-hearted daughters were assiduous in recommending and preparing for her, so recruited her forces that she was able to rise and make the necessary change in her toilet for the little party in the evening. "I declare, Ally," said her aunt, "you are just like me. A cup of tea sets me up just so, if anything is the matter with me. Many a time I've had trouble, real trouble, which I don't think I could have borne at all, if it had not been for a cup of tea. Often and often, when somethin' has come across to worry me, I've said, 'Mercy on us, how I do feel! Do somebody run and make me a good cup of tea right off.' There's nothin' in the world so com- fortin' as a cup of tea!" Miss Maria, in her bright, pleasant parlor, was ready to receive her guests with her accustomed cordiality. Mr. Teunis, without a trace of fatigue on his broad, good-humored face, was soon making his peace with Aunt Aulchy by a double share of attention, and by uttering a series of regrets that she had laid aside her habit of join- ing the young people in their pleasant little excursions. "Yes," said the good lady, "I've pretty much given up those sort of things since my health has been so dulicate, 42*  &#xD;<pb n="498-499" xml:id="VAC7016-00000250"/> "8       WALTER OGILBY. -but I remember perfectly well the last time I went up on Solomon's Barrack with you, Mr. Benthouse. Letlme see-it was when John Peter was a baby, and you was so wery kind. I never can forget it-all the time hopin' the baby wouldn't cry while I was away. " Mr. Teunis had turned away, not caring to aid his guest in her reminiscences. The latter leaned across an intervening cousin and whispered to Ally, in great glee,- "Didn't I pay him off for bein' so rude and impolite this mornin'?" "Here you all are! Mr. Teunis was now exclaiming to some new-comers. "Miss 'Philly and the doctor and all! We missed you on the mountain. And here comes Miss Katy Van Antwerp, as bright and fresh as the May- dew I No trace of having been climbing the North Beacon!'" "Now tell me, if you please, John Peter,--Lieutenant Ellsworth I suppose I should rather say," cried the hostess, "why did you not honor me by wearing your uniform this evening??" "In the first place, it had not arrived from the tailor; in the second -- "Oh, you need not trouble yourself to go farther," said Miss Maria, laughing; "but you might have worn your cadet's uniform. It is exceedingly becoming!" "The chief objection to that would have been, that if I had had occasion to use my hands, I should have been obliged to lay my pocket-handkerchief upon the floor, or- ask my next neighbor to hold it for me,-the regulation allowing us no pockets." ( Well, that is really too bad. I was in hopes to have had quite a military display this evening; but I seem doomed to disappointment on all hands. I was to have had some of our other friends to meet you."   WAILTER OGILBY.       499 Ally's heart beat thick and fast. She held her breath to hear what was coming next. "Now you will never believe it," cried Miss Maria, "but I have such a piece of news! Come, you must guess it, some of you." "Tell us where it came from, and what it is about, and I am bound to guess it," said CaptailnCarter. "Is it about a wedding?" asked Philly, innocently. "Ah! that I cannot say. One cannot tell what these things will end in. Have I raised your curiosity suffi- ciently?" "Yes, yes,-we are in the highest state of excitement, of torment," said Mr. Halford. "Well, then," said Miss Maria, slowly, and looking around on her guests to enjoy their impatience, "it is-- neither more nor less than this-the Ogilbys are going away on a journey; they are to set off the day after to- morrow, and they are to be gone all the summer." "Is that all? Ah I Miss Maria, your news is not worth paying for,-it is stale," cried Gitty; " we heard it three days ago." "How could you possibly have heard it?" "Mr. Ogilby wrote a note to Dr. Van Wyck, to say that it would be out of his power to officiate on a certain grand occasion, as he should probably be absent fr/om home about that time. I think it was Saturday evening that you were telling me of it, Garret," said Gertrude, carelessly. "Indeed, my dear!" said Miss Maria, " but you did not know he was going so soon, and you do not-know now who he is going with." "With Mrs. Ogilby and the two Miss Ogilbys, I think you just said." "Yes, and with Christina Van Ness and her brother-- and with the old Scotch gentleman, Mr. Buchanan, and  &#xD;<pb n="500-501" xml:id="VAC7016-00000251"/> 500  -     WALTER OGILBY. that beautiful daughter of his, the widow of Walter's friend, of whom you may have heard. It was to see them that he went to New York a few weeks ago." Gertrude was startled, but she did not lose her self- possession, as she replied, "Yes, certainly,-everybody has heard of the charming widow and the interesting little god- son, Walter Ogilby*Rutherford. It is fair to infer then that the lady is getting over her affliction, if she is able to enjoy journeying about with her boy's guardian." i"For that matter, I suppose Mrs. Rutherford travels under the care of her father. Walter will have enough to do in taking charge of his mother and sisters." "Ahd where are they going?"j T Catskill Mountain first-after that to Saratoga and perhaps to Niagara.7"  "A very charming programme I I must confess I envy them, so far as Niagara is concerned. But you have not told us, Miss Van Benthuysen, how you heard this great piece of news."                     1 "It was in this way. I sent a note of invitation to Waldorf after I left you this morning, and in reply Chris- tina wrote that she was going to Ferndale, and would call l and give me her answer as she returned. What I have told you is the information she brought back. It seems the plan of the journey is not altogether a sudden one. The Ogilbys have had it in contemplation a week or more, but the time for setting off was not fixed until to-day. I think Christina said Walter had received a letter from old Mr. Buchanan urging him to joinhim and hi s daughter in this trip, but they did not, at first, decide to do so,-they thought of going to Boston instead, and Mrs. Ogilby had persuaded Mrs. Van Ness to allow Christina to accompany them. This other scheme, upon reflection, pleased them better, and when they had resolved upon it the time was   WALTER OGILBY.        501 so short before their departure that Chrissy said she would have to hurry home with the news, and finish her preparations for leaving the day after to-morrow." i' It is easy to foresee the end of all this," said Gertrude. "Yes, Philly, we can answer your question now,--it is about a wedding. I would not trust even the cool and cautious Mr. Walter Ogilby within the attractions of the fascinating widow." "And they're to be gone all summer?" said Aunt Aulchy. "I wonder what will become of all their early grapes and peaches?" "Yes-they are to remain with Mr. Buchanan and his daughter until they sail in September," said Miss Maria. "If the lady sails at all," said Gertrude. "Has she the little boy with her?" "No-he was left behind in Scotland with his grand- mother. And Christina said the mother's anxiety to re- turn to him was so great that Mr. Buchanan was almost prevailed on to give up the journey on which his heart was set." "I dare say by September she will be content to let the grandpapa return to Scotland alone and send over the young heir to her and his godfather." Mr. Halford was standing near Alice at the commence- ment of this conversation. He changed his position slightly so as to screen her from observation as it went on. No one but himself remarked the varying color, and the firm clasp on the flowers she held in her hand as she strove to subdue all appearance of emotion. Once he stooped and addressed her in a low voice,- "If you were not so much fatigued, I would ask you to go with me and look at some of those curious plants of Miss Maria's that she was describing this morning,"-but at her hurried,-  &#xD;<pb n="502-503" xml:id="VAC7016-00000252"/> 502       WALTER OGILBY. "No, no-I am very well here, thank you," he turned and appeared occupied with listening to all that was going forward. "And was this all that Miss Christina had to tell?" asked Gertrude. "No, no," cried Mr. Teunis laughing, "there was some- thing else; but it was for you, specially, John Peter. You must needs interfere with my little piece of gallantry this afternoon, and send a message back with Miss Agnes' horse, which I had borrowed for Miss Morton's use. Now, see what you've got by it!" "What, pray?" "You may well look frightened. Just as Walter came to the gate to help Miss Christina out of the carriage, up came Jemnmy McCabe, that young sprig of Shilelah, you know, that Walter keeps to practice philanthropy upon; he had got Fair Star, and was leading her away to the stables. 'What does this mean?' says his master. 'I sent that horse down to Squire Vandervoort's.' 'Yes, and plase yer honor's honor,' says Jemmy, 'and Sol Van- dervoorts has just brought him back, and says Mr. John Peter bid him say, " the young lady don't want your horse; he'd rather she'd walk; he's much obliged to you."' "Ogilby must have been surprised to receive such a rude message," said John Peter, much annoyed. "Yes, I fancy he was. Christina says he looked very queer, though he said nothing. I must tell him in the morning how it was." "I shall do that myself," said John Peter. Gertrude glanced at Alice, and upon Mr. Teunis' begin- ning,- "So you see, Miss Morton, the mischief that is likely to ensue from your refusing the accommodation I had pro- vided you. A duel, at the least-probably a journey put off-some hearts broken  "   WALTER OGILBY.         503 "Ally," interrupted Gertrude, "they are bringing in tea; let us go into the library and take ours there. There are some beautiful books of tropical plants and flowers, which you will like to look at." Ally saw that her cousin's suggestion meant more than met the ear, and she rose and followed her with a lan- guid step. Before they could be joined by others of the party, Gertrude said, in a low, emphatic tone, "For Heaven's sake, Ally, do not look so woe-begone! Do you wish to show all the world that you are breaking your heart for Walter Ogilby? Have a little pride, I entreat you." "I do not think I look woe-begone," said Ally, rousing herself. "I dare say I look tired; so, I suppose, do all the others." "If it is only fatigue, then, do not let Pinckney Halford suspect it to be something more serious.- He is watching you every moment, and there he is coming now." "Mr. Halford has no right to watch me," said Alice, as she seated herself at the little table and began turning over the prints that her cousin placed before her. The hint that she had received stimulated her to assume an air of hbeerfulness that was torture to her, until the hour when, to her unspeakable relief, the Milbank carryall was an- nounced as ready to transport the wearied party again to their homes. "Here is a letter for you, Ally," was her uncle's first salutation on her arrival. John Peter seized and brought it to her, and promptly placed a light that she might read it. He could with difficulty restrain his impatience as she looked hastily over its contents; then, putting it into his hands, with a faint smile she bade him good-night and went up-stairs, while he vanished in all haste wi-h the precious missive.  &#xD;<pb n="504-505" xml:id="VAC7016-00000253"/> 504       WALTER OGILBY. CHAPTER LX.  AND this was the waking from Ally's dream of love and happiness! He was going without a word of explanation or farewell! Going, to remain away until precisely the last moment when there could be a possible chance of  meeting her again! Yet she must bear it in silence; she must not even look i dispirited, for Gertrude's admonition had taught her how such looks would be interpreted. Mr. Ogilby's conduct was inexplicable. She could not  think she had deserved to be thus treated; but she would strive against the indulgence of one bitter feeling towards him. She would, if possible, think of him no more; neither would she think of Mrs. Rutherford. What was   either of them to her now? She would do her best to forget the one brief month of happiness-happiness such as she could never know again; and she would live in future for the comfort and happiness of others. He who sends into the hearts of his creatures the dearest and ten- derest of earthly affections, would perhaps in time give her strength to conquer this, which his wisdom had not seen fit to smile upon. Yet, though Ally could philoso- phize, she could not forget. The effort to banish Mr. Ogilby and Mrs. Rutherford from her mind, kept them only the more constantly and distinctly there; and, in spite of hler wise resolutions, she found herself continually revolv- ing in her mind all that had taken or was likely to take place. Gertrude's feelings, while in the little library at Briar   WALTER OGILBY.         505 Lodge, had been scarcely more tranquil than those of her cousin. It was the first time she had entered this apart- ment since the morning of her encounter at chess With Mr. Ogilby. How had the game, of which her success that morning was to be the test, sped since then? Thus far she seemed to have triumphed. She had separated Mr. Ogilby, to all appearance irrevocably, from the object of his devotion; she had succeeded in establishing so intimate a relation between the latter and Mr. Halford as would, she was per- suaded, require only time and assiduity on the one side, aided by womanly pride and resentment on the other, to convert into a lasting attachment. But, all this accomplished, how stood her own chances? Was Mr. Ogilby checkmtated, or had he only been driven from one point to entrench himself still more strongly in another? Mrs. Rutherford was a piece in the game upon whose introduction she had not counted; and she at the moment almost felt the conviction she had so unhesi- tatingly expressed, that the fair widow would carry off the prize. Should she then abandon the contest in despair? should she, following the dictates of good policy, secure Captain Carter while there was yet time? No; she would take no decided step yet in that direction. Captain Carter had promised to return to the wedding,-she would contrive to keep him at her disposal until the return of the travel- lers-until she knew definitely what she had to hope or to fear. If, with all her admirable play, she should at last lose this game I But of that she would not allow herself to think. Mrs. Ellsworth, on the following morning, announced her intention of calling at Ferndale to say good-by to the family and wish them a pleasant journey. She kindly 43       &#xD;<pb n="506-507" xml:id="VAC7016-00000254"/> 506       WALTER OGILBY. proposed to her niece to accompany her. :Ally felt that such an attention was due to Mrs. Ogilby and her daugh- ! ters in return for all their kindness. For a moment she  wavered; but the thought "If he does not come to take  leave of me, it is because he prefers not to see me," decided her.             : "No, thank you, aunt," was her reply. "Please say that I feel very tired with my walk yesterday--or stay, as I have a couple of books to return to Mr. Ogilby, I will write a few lines to his mother at the same time to bid her adieu." The note was soon written. It contained simply what politeness dictated, though Ally's heart was ready to pour itself forth at the thought that this was to be her last fare- well to those she had so much loved. John Peter tookl the note and books when she had carefully folded them in an envelope, and, as he received them, he said to her in a low tone, "You shall hear, on my return, of all things being right between Ogilby and myself." Gertrude had, in the mean time, discovered that it was quite requisite for her to accompany her mother and brother on their visit to Feriidale.  "What would Mrs. Ogilby think of her if she should neglect such an indispensable mark of respect? . All the others, it is true, might indulge themselves in staying and resting after such a day as. the preceding one-for her, it was imperative to make a sacrifice, however much she might prefer remaining. Their guests must excuse her-  her absence need not be of more than an hour's duration. Mr. Halford would, she was sure, take John Peter's place, and do all in his power to make the time pass pleasantly. What a pity that there was not a billiard-table, or some other gentlemanly amusement of the sort, to help to while away the hours of a country visit!"   WALTER OOILBY.         507 Having said all this for the benefit of Captain Carter, Gitty'departed with the others. They were received by Mrs. Ogilby and Agnes, who expressed due regret at not seeing Miss Morton again. Mr. Ogilby entered just as his mother was making the in- quiry of Gertrude,- "Does your cousin remain with you through the summer?" Her reply, "Yes-until the beginning of September"- was cut short by her mother,- "To tell the truth, we were afraid of losing her sooner, for John Peter is to start, as soon as ever his friends leave, for Ashfield-her home, you know. And he set in at the greatest rate for her to go with him, but I would not listen to it. She has come to spend the summer, I tell her, and I can't have her running away before it's half over. Be- sides, what's the use? John Peter is a comin' right back again." Mr. Ogilby had by this time come forward. There was a slight reserve in his manner of addressing John Peter, which did not escape the latter, who was still holding in his hand the parcel which Alice had commissioned him to deliver. "Here is something for you," said he, endeavoring to speak with his usual frank cheerfulness. "Books, I be- lieve. Let us go into the library and put them where they belong." Mr. Ogilby led the way.  Gertrude looked after them with no small uneasiness. Though she doubted not that her brother's object was to explain the rude message sent in his name on the preceding afternoon, she could not con- ceal from herself the danger that other explanations, such as would prove fatal to her plans, might arise in the course of thO conversation.  &#xD;<pb n="508-509" xml:id="VAC7016-00000255"/> 508       WALTER OGILBY. John Peter went straight to the point, and, of course, a. few words sufficed to set the matter in question upon its proper footing. "And now, Ogilby," said he, with a somewhat embar- rassed air, " will you allow me to allude to another subject, in which I feel that I have been really to blame? I have to apologize to you for my manner towards you on the day we were at West Point." Mr. Ogilby looked uncomfortable-his color went and came-his voice was not quite firm as he said,- "There is no occasion to advert to that time. It is all past now." "Yes, but my recollection of my own want of courtesy is not past. I see now how wrong it was, but at that time I was in a state of great excitement; I was hardly master of myself. I believe I ought to tell you that I was hoping, dreading to hear something on which the happi- ness of my whole life depended, and I did not stop to con- sider what was due to others. I cannot make you under- stand, I suppose," continued he, with an embarrassed laugh, " unless I explain myself more fully-- " "I do understand," said Mr. Ogilby, forcing himself to speak; "I am acquainted with the circumstances in which you are placed., It was perhaps natural that you should feel towards me as vou did; but, Ellsworth, you cannot for a moment suppose that I was aware---". He stopped. "No, certainly not,"' said John Peter, looking at his companion with a puzzled air, for he could not comprehend why he should be so much moved by what was, after all, a trifle,-" of course, you knew nothing of the matter at first. But who told you afterwards? Did Ally?" "No, no," said Mr. Ogilby, hastily. "Miss Morton never said a word to me about it. But knowing it as I   WALTER OGILB1.         509 do, I of course understand what were your feelings." He turned away suddenly. "Are those the books you spoke of?" asked he, taking up the packet. "Yes; there is a note within, I think, for your mother." "Then let us take it to her." Mr. Ogilby undid the fastenings of the parcel and proceeded with the note to the parlor. A glance at his grave countenance assured Ger- trude that all was safe, and she hastened her mother's de- parture, lest some chance word or question might yet lead to disastrous results. The departure of the military guests in the afternoon brought no heart-breakings; for Anne Eliza, having ascer- tained that Gitty had made a point of Captain Carter's re- turning to the wedding, followed her example and obtained for Mr. Barton so pressing an invitation from ,her cousin Garret, that an acceptance of it readily followed. It was true, as her aunt had informed Mrs. Ogilby, that Ally had been strongly urged by John Peter to accompany him in his journey to Ashfield; and it was equally true that her heart had prompted her, at once, to accede to his request. There, in that dear, lovely home, she would find a balm for all her sorrows. What, indeed, to her now was any other place on earth? It would be better, she felt, far better, for her to accept her cousin's invitation I How delighted the dear ones would be to welcome her so unexpectedly I While she was revolving in her -mind these considera- tions, Gertrude interposed. The proposition was one which, if acceded to, might work destruction to all her schemes. Mr. Halford was not yet secured, or rather, he had not yet secured Ally. He stood, as Gitty did not fail to ob- serve, watching with even more anxiety than the other members of the circle, the decision she might make. 43*  &#xD;<pb n="510-511" xml:id="VAC7016-00000256"/> 510       WALTER OGTLBI'. "Upon my word, I think my mother will be well off, if you succeed in your persuasions, John Peter! Not only are you going yourself, in the morning, but the girls are to take their departure for Colonel Westhrook's, and, of course; Mr. Halford escorts them. I have promised, as you know, to spend most of the time that remains be- fore the wedding, with our cousins to assist them in their preparations; but, of course, that must be given up, if you persist in taking Ally away. My arrangements were made upon the supposition that she was going to fulfil her promise and remain all summer with us. I do not remem- ber to have heard any other intention expressed until within the last twenty-four hours. Well-Philly and the rest of them must bear the disappointment as they can. There seems to be an epidemic migration in the country, beginning with the Ogilbys." The sarcastic emphasis of the last remark had less weight than her aunt's earnest entreaties, in determining Ally to dismiss all thoughts of leaving Milbank at present. With many a heart-felt sigh, she suffered her cousin to set forth for Ashfield, laden only with love and blessings for those in whose arms she was longing to be once more folded.. Gertrude devoted the time which succeeded the departure of her brother and cousins, to a series of visits not to the Vandervoorts alone, but to other families of relatives, and thus Alice and her aunt were again left almost exclusively to each other's society. It suited the good lady exactly. to sit down with her large work-basket by her side, and with Ally to aid as well as to listen, while she poured forth into her affectionate, sympathizing bosom troubles real or imaginary, past, present, or to come-for all of which she received the tender consolations which she looked for in vain from any other source.   WALTER OGILBY         5" "Now, Ally, is not this nice?" she would exclaim. "Just as it used to be when you first came-before Gitty got back from Nine Pardners!" Ally could not respond in the affirmative. No-never would it again be with her as it had been before Gitty's return from Nine Partners I A change had come over her life, and she could not hope to see again the trusting, joyous days which, until that period, had been hers! One day, when Gertrude was at home for a short time, Ally walked over to call at Farmer Van Vorst's. Nothing could exceed the cordiality with which she was greeted. She had not been long seated by the little invalid mother, listening to the account of her failing health, but of her brightening hopes, ere she found herself, in reply to some questions she had asked about the younger members of the family, suddenly encircled by a feeble arm and drawn towards the speaker, a kiss imprinted on her cheek, and the information whispered that Lebby was to be married to Locky Kuypers as soon as his new house should be com- pleted, and ready for their occupation. "Such a joy as it is to my heart, you may be sure!" said the mother, between tars and smiles. "Such a good thing for Lebby to be s ttled! And such a happy match for Locky, poor girl! for there are few young men like my Lebbeus-and such a home as she'll have after the one she's leaving I You've seen yourself that her grandmother is just about the crankiest, tedious-temperedest old creature that ever walked the earth." Ally's congratulations were warm enough to satisfy the good lady, who went off at once into a panegyric upon the bride-elect, not the least conspicuous of whose good quali- ties was her taste for poetry and literature, a point upon which she and her future spouse were, as his mother averred, happily congenial. "They have been planning  &#xD;<pb n="512-513" xml:id="VAC7016-00000257"/> 512 W ALTER OGILBY.  a little about the wedding," said she," and they thought, at first, it would be a pretty idea to give out the invitations in some sort of verses. Locky wrote a set of what Lebby called blank verses, but then she said she would not have them, for she considered she had drawn a prize and she would not have any blank in the matter, which I thought was a very handsome compliment to my son. So then Lebby wrote a set himself, but somehow they did not suit Clarindy--she said she thought prose was genteeler. Then they set down one evening and just sketched out a sort of pattern-I guess I've got it in that work-basket, if you'll have the goodness to hand it to me." She hunted carefully beneath her store of patchwork and embroidery and drew forth a sheet of note-paper carefully folded in a large envelope of foolscap. The style of invita- tion was as follows: "Miss Rachel Kuypers and Mr. Lebbeus Van Vorst contemplate the consummation of their connubial felicity, and solicit the honor of your company to add lustre to the brilliancy of the scene. " Observing that her visitor was not quite ready with a compliment, Mrs. Van Vorst remarked,- "Clarindy did not like Locky's name being put first, but Lebby said he didn't think it would look well the other way. Then Clary said she never did like fine doings-for her part, she should rather go round herself among her friends, when the time came, and give out the invitations in just such words as suited her. And I guess they've pretty much made up their minds, to let her have her own way about it." Ally's praise of Miss Clarinda's good sense and right judgment in all matters, quite reconciled the mother to her silence in regard to the literary production. "Yes," said she, "and I don't think Lebby is wanting   WALTER OGILBY.         513 in good sense either. It was only a few days ago that he was saying that if Locky and he had been in no hurry about marrying, they had got something worth while by waiting; and Locky began to make a beautiful remark out of Mr. Young's Night Thoughts,- Procrastination is the thief of time;' I dare say you've heard it. Lebby says in a kind of whis- per to me, 'It would be a good thing if procrastination should make a mistake and steal her old grandmother, for she looks for all the. world like old Time in the primer- but I wouldn't tell Locky so; for what's the use of begin- ning by making light of her relations?' I thought this was very sensible and considerate in Lebby." Ally agreed with her that it was. "I think Locky must be considerate and good-tempered, too," she said. "I ob- served she bore very patiently her grandmother's sharp remarks the day we were here. Why is it that the old lady is so hard upon her?" "Why, in the first place, you see Locky is fond of books, which her grandmother sets no store by, at all. She thinks all the time given to them is just so much wasted--and she don't like the notions Locky gets from them; particularly that she learns not to believe in spooks or rixies or any- thing of that kind." "What are they?" "Why, spooks, you know, are ghosts, or spirits, or some- thing of that kind, that appear to people-and rixies are a good deal like the fairies we read about." "And does the grandmother believe in such things?" "Oh, yes I she would not think herself respectable un- less she did believe in them as firmly as she does in the Bible. She prides herself, I do believe, on her family hav- ing had a spook in it, years ago. For my part, I'd rather  &#xD;<pb n="514-515" xml:id="VAC7016-00000258"/> 514       WALTER OGILBY. owe my consequence to something else than being spooked, as they call it," said the good lady, with a feeble laugh.. "Iboes Aunty Kuypers imagine that such apparitions are seen nowadays, or are they among the good, old-fash- ioned things that the new Yankee machinery and inven- tions have driven away?" "I do believe she has a grudge at the Yankees on that very account. She thinks that it is owing to the noise and bustle that they have brought in, that out-of-the-way sights and sounds are not as much attended to as they used to be. Locky does not give in to those supernatural sort of things, but she is too dutiful to aggravate her grandmother by not seeming to believe the story of Cousin Yost Van Buskirk. I suppose your Aunt Aulchy has told you of that." "No, she has not," said Ally. "I have never heard the story. Tell it to me, won't you, unless it will fatigue you too much? I delight in all ghost and witch stories." Thus urged, Mrs. Van Vorst began. CHAPTER LXI. "T was a long time ago, before the old war, I guess, that the things I am going to tell you of happened. Yes, it must have been a good while before that, for it was when Aunty Kuypers was a little girl-I have heard her relate the story time and again. "This Yost Van Buskirk was her cousin, a smart young man, I have heard her say-that is, as regarded business and getting along in the world; for as to learning it was a thing little thought of at that day. The Van Buskirks lived in an old-fashioned place down by the side of the   WALTER OGILBY.        515 creek. It has all gone to decay now-nothing left but the old house, half stone and half clap-boards-everything else rooted out, or changed, or turned into waste land "Yost had a very pretty cousin, Elsa Fonda-of course, she was Aunty Kuypers' cousin, too. Yost was Elsa's bachelor, as they used to call a sweetheart, and they were to be married in a year or two-not right off, for people did not do things in a hurry in those days--besides, Elsa was quite young. Among their circle of relations was another cousin, a smart, dressy little woman. the wife of the cap- tain of the sloop that went down every other Saturday to York. Nothing would do, one time when the sloop wasto sail, but Mrs. Van Olinda-that was the cousin's name- must have Elsa to take a trip with her to the city. She teased and teased the old folks a long time, and at last got their consent, but Yost did not like it well: he did not think much of Mrs. Van Olinda, and he said it was enough to spoil any girl to go away so far from home, let alone her being under the care of one who knew so much more than she need to, as Cousin Lotta did. "Sure enough, when Elsa came back from the city she had got a new dress, a present, they said, from the captain himself. It was' a full petticoat, like the one she always wore, only instead of calimank it was of chintz, white, with little sprigs of flowers sprinkled all over it-Aunty Kuy- pers has got a piece of it now, for it seems it was all divided up afterwards, and given around among all the relations. And there was a gown of the same, open in front and ruffled all round, and with a long train dragging behind. "The young cousins all admired this dress very much, and that was all the good poor Elsa had of it, for her father would never let her put it on. He did not believe in young girls wearing such finery-he had no idea of anything  &#xD;<pb n="516-517" xml:id="VAC7016-00000259"/> 516       WALTER OGILBY. being proper but her little linen short gown and stuff pet- ticoat. "Yost had very much the same notions. He had not liked Elsa's going to York; and, after she came back, he liked as little to hear her talk of what she had se'en or done while she was away. She was a pretty creature, they say, and good-hearted, but a little wilful; so by-and-by she grew displeased with the way Yost would go on, and things did not seem to be quite so smooth and pleasant between them as they had formerly been. "Well, they were going to have a prink-tem-a kind of a tea-party-at her father's, old Peter Fonda's; and as the sloop was at the Landing, just come up the river, of course Captain Van Olinda and his wife were invited. Cousin Lotta, as they called her, came up early in-the morning, to bring some lemons and cocoa-nuts that she had brought from the city, and she coaxed and coaxed until she got Elsa's mother to consent that she should wear the new chintz gown and petticoat. "When Yost came in before the rest of the company and saw her with it on, he did not like it; but what he liked still less was, that instead of the string of gold beads that she always wore around her neck, she had got a double row of red coral ones, such as had never been seen in that part of the country before. When Yost went up and asked her where she got them, she said Cousin Lotta had just brought them to her. "The captain came up just before tea, and who should he bring with him but a bold, dashing young man, whom he introduced as a friend of his, a sea-captain, who sailed over the ocean to foreign countries. Yost saw in a minute that he and Elsa had met before; and, as the captain was pretty forward and paid her all the attention possible, Yost held back and looked on, without saying a word, as if he had a   WALTER OGILBY.        51 mind to see how things were going. May-be he would not have minded so much Elsa's being civil to a stranger, if one of the girls had not whispered, just out of mischief, 'Cousin Lotta brought the red necklace, but ask Elsa who paid for it.' "Whether Elsa had any liking for the stranger, or whether she was only vexed at Yost's behavior, nobody knew at the time; but in all the plays that they played she would leave Yost out, and choose the captain. He sat next her at the table, rattling and talking, till finally, as one and another of the company began to pass their remarks, Yost left the company and went home. "The next morning he says to his mother, 'Mother, I am going to see my old uncle at Middlebush, and I shall stay away a week or two, may-be.' So he went away; and when the week was out, as he did not feel like going home, he went on to Beckmantown, and after that to Po'kep'sy, and other places where he had acquaintance. At the end of about a fortnight he felt as if he could not stay away any longer,-he thought he had better go back and see how matters stood. "When he got home it was late in the afternoon, nearly dark, and, after he had put his horse away, as he always did the first thing on coming home, he went along into the house, but to his surprise he did not see any of his folks. Only a little boy was by, who told him, when he asked for his mother, that she had gone over the creek to Peter Fonda's. So he went his way over the creek, and walked on a little piece, thinking with himself whether he should go on to his Cousin Fonda's, or whether he should still keep up his hard feeling towards Elsa. "He was walking along, when just as he came to where the road branches off to go up the mountain, he saw a fig- ure moving along in that direction, which he knew in a "  &#xD;<pb n="518-519" xml:id="VAC7016-00000260"/> 518       WALTER OGILBY. moment to be Elsa, though strange enough she seemed to be dressed all in white. He was wondering what she could be doing in that lone place, and at that late hour, and  thinking he did not know what, as he said afterwards; he had not strength scarcely either to stand still or to go on, when just then she turned and looked back at him and called 'Yosty! Yosty!' just as she had been used to at times when she wished to please him. "He turned and went up the road, following her, but he thought it strange she did not stop. It was almost quite dark, and now and then he lost sight of her, and he would stand still and listen if it could be the whip-poor-will, and think whether he might not be mistaken, after all. But just then he would hear her voice farther on, 'Yostyl' 'Yosty I' and catch a glimpse of her white figure in the dark shadow of the trees. At last he saw her a little dis- tance before him, sitting on a fallen tree by the side of the road, and he hastened his pace and came up to her. He spoke to her, but she did not answer him, but only turned and looked at him with a troubled look, as if she was sorry for something. "He sat down by her, but, as he went to put his arm round her, she moved away. When he drew nearer she would move farther off, and at last, when he had got to the end of the log, she was standing right up before him, and work- ing to unclasp the red coral beads that were around her neck, and that he had felt so badly about. Then he spoke to her again and said, 'Elsa, did the sea-captain give you those baubles to coax you away from me? Give them to me, that I may throw them in the creek, as I would him if I had him here ' "She had the beads in her hand by this time; and, as be said this, she tossed them towards him, so that they struck him in the face. It could not have been the force of the   WALTER OGIB Y.        519 blow, yet he swooned away, and knew nothing more until he came to himself and found that he was lying across the log, in the same place, and the stars shining over his head. He knew it must be late, for just then he heard the cocks crowing for midnight-his hat had fallen off, and his head was all wet with the heavy night-dew. He gathered up his hat and put it on, and set out on his way home, won- dering what had become of Elsa, and what could have been the matter with himself. "As he got back to the road that runs along the creek, he could just distinguish a man coming riding along on horse- back, from the direction of Peter Fonda's,-and, by his cocked hat, he could see that it was the dominie. "As he came near, the minister called out,- "'Alh, Yost!-so you've got back at last, poor fellow! Well, I'm sorry for you 1' and with that, he rode on. ' Yost lad but one thought in his mind-that the dominie was just returning from his Cousin Elsa's wedding-and he hurried on to Peter Fonda's as fast as his feet could carry him. There were lights in the house, and people moving about, but no sound of gayety or merry-making-on the contrary, all was still and quiet. He went in, and the first person he saw was his own mother sitting in an arm-chair crying, and some of the neighbors with her. As soon as she saw him she called out,- "  Oh, my son, my son 1 you are come too late! If poor Elsa could only have said good-by to you 1' "It seemed asif he could not quite understand, even when his mother told him the whole story,-how poor Elsa had come over, two days after his departure, in a heavy rain to see her, and to inquire why Yost had gone off in that sudden manner, after being so long angry with her,-how this exposure had given her a cold, which had ended in a pleurisy,-how his family, when her life began to be de-  &#xD;<pb n="520-521" xml:id="VAC7016-00000261"/> 520       WALTER OGILBY. spaired of, had sent to Beckmantown, and all around the country, in search of him, but in vain. "His mother told him, too, how that Elsa, in her delirium, had been constantly calling for 'Yosty! Yosty I' and rav- ing about the coral necklace which she said was round her throat and choking her so that she could not breathe,- and how at last, spite of friends and physicians, she had, that very evening, breathed her last. "They took poor Yost home, and he fell into a long fit of sickness, but not until after he had told his mother all about his meeting with Elsa on the path leading up into the mountain. Nobody doubted the truth of his story, for in those days everybody believed that such things were "' "And what became of poor Yost afterwards?" inquired Alice, much interested. "Whether it was the shock, or the grief, or the sickness, no one could tell; but after the fever left him the poor fel- low grew silly-like, and seemed, they said, to go back al- most to his childhood again. They had to keep a close watch on him at evening, for he was always wanting to wander away up the mountain-road to see if he could find Elsa. "Another fancy he had, that was for making little sloops and rigging them up, and putting a figure on board which he would call 'the sea-captain.' Aunty Kuypers says she has sat and watched him many a time when she was a girl. When he had whittled one out of a shingle, and fitted all the sails and rigging to his mind, and dressed up his little figure, and placed him by the side of, the mast, he would set it sailing in the creek, and watch it till it got to the old mill-dam. Then, when the little vessel would go over, he would set up such a shout, and call out, 'There goes the sea-captain!' just like any little child.   WALTER OGILB         521 And this he kept up for years and years, until he dwindled away and died. Poor Yost Van Buskirk!" "And this appearance of Cousin Elsa was what they call a spook. Did Aunty Kuypers ever fancy that she saw her?" asked Alice. "I have heard her say that, believe it or not, the story was as true as the Bible; and that until the time that your Aunt Aulchy married, and so many strange people came in around here to live, that whenever she, or any of the family, would walk out on that mountain road just after sunset of a pleasant evening, they could hear a voice calling, 'Yosty! Yosty!' just as plain as anything. Lebby tried to convince her once that it was a whip-poor-will, or some sort of a night-bird, but she got so angry she has hardly forgiven him yet." The story of the good woman furnished Alice food for thought during her walk home. "Is it indeed so, that ' the course of true love never does run smooth!"' she said. "At least, I have not to reproach myself with the fault of poor Elsa. I did not trifle with his feelings, and by coquetry -and pretended indifference drive him from me!" She was not destined, as time wore on, to remain in en- tire ignorance of what was passing with the Ogilbys. Gertrude took an opportunity, ere long, in one of her short visits at home, to propose a call at Waldorf. No objection was made, for neither Alice nor her aunt felt the slightest unwillingness to hear tidings of the travellers. After a little preliminary conversation with Mrs. Van Ness, Gitty adroitly introduced an inquiry how Miss Christina and her brother were enjoying themselves. "Oh, excessively!" was the reply. "Indeed, Chrissy can hardly express her delight at everything sue sees. Her letter was written on board the steamboat after they "*  &#xD;<pb n="522-523" xml:id="VAC7016-00000262"/> 522       WALTER OGILBY. left Catskill. She said it was the only time she could find for writing, for when they were on land there was so much to be seen, and so many agreeable people to be talked to, that every moment was completely engrossed. Her letter was full of descriptions of the magnificent prospect from the Mountain House-of the sun rising over a sea of cloud and mist-of their visit to the Falls. You have heard of the cascade near the summit of the mountain, Miss Mor- ton  Our friends came near having a very serious adven- ture there, I assure you." "An adventure? Gracious me! What was it?" said Aunt Aulchy. "Why, the young people must needs attempt to walk around on the little narrow ledge half way up the sort of rocky amphitheatre over which the water pours. Old Mr. Buchanan, who had been escorting Chrissy, thought the undertaking too formidable for him, so he gave her up to the care of a young Quaker gentleman from Philadelphia. They two got along very well, and so did Agnes, who happened to be with William Henry-but when Mrs. Rutherford was about half way around she was seized with giddiness, or something of the kind, just in the steep- est and most dangerous part of the path. Mr. Ogilby was obliged to hold her, clinging to the rocks, and every moment in danger of falling into the basin below-till at last she recovered sufficiently to go on." "It is a great thing to know how to time one's attacks of giddiness," remarked Gertrude. The sarcasm was lost upon kind, unsuspicious Mrs. Van Ness. "Yes, as you observe, my dear," she replied, "it was certainly indiscreet in the lady to have ventured, unless she was quite sure of the strength of her nerves; but she has been the sufferer, poor thing! Chrissy writes that   WALTER OGILBY.        523 she has not yet recovered from the fright, but is so nervous and poorly that they have given up spending any time in Saratoga. They are going to Ballston instead, which is less fashionable, and consequently much quieter." "For my part, I don't see how people can want to be creepin' around in such wery dangerous places, just for the sake of sayin' they done it," remarked Aunt Aulchy, in a tone of high disapprobation. Ally had closed her eyes with a shudder at the idea of Mr. Ogilby's perilous situation, and she could not quite repress a grudging feeling towards Mrs. Rutherford for having first caused and then shared it. "And how do the young people like this change in their plans-this substitution of quietness and retirement for the gayeties they had been promising themselves?" asked Gertrude. "Oh, they do not complain,--they will have enjoyment enough. After awhile there will be a trip to Lake George, and then Quebec and Niagara,-no fear of their getting homesick, I'll venture to say, for three or four months to come." CHAPTER    LXII. Two weeks had now elapsed since John Peter's depart- ure, and still he did not return. His mother had sp3cu- lated and worried much about his absence, although she doubted not its being in some way connected with his future union'with his cousin. To her reiterated inquiries, her husband's reply had invariably been,- "He has gone on business-business in which I am par- ticularly interested. If it succeeds well you shall hear  &#xD;<pb n="524-525" xml:id="VAC7016-00000263"/> 524       WALTER OGILB Y. all about it some day." With this answer she was forced to content herself. Cornelius was again at home. He always found his cousin a most acceptable companion, particularly in his rambles or shooting excursions. The latter were seldom to any great distance from home, yet if Ally became tired with their length, he would find her a seat, where she might occupy herself with her book or her meditations, while he made his way still farther-sometimes perhaps even up the sides of the mountain, in pursuit of game. Their walk one pleasant afternoon lay along the banks of the stream on the side nearest Milbank. They had crossed the new street leading from the highroad down to the creek, and proceeded a considerable distance beyond the mill-dam and the Factory Buildings. Still farther on the ground ascended gradually for a considerable distance, and from the most elevated point Cornelius assured his cousin that a fine view was to be obtained of all the rich country sloping away to the north and east-one that would well repay her for the fatigue of the walk. More than one fence had to be climbed, and more than one stile passed through, ere they gained their point of destination Arrived there, Ally found the prospect indeed, as Cor- nelius had promised, well worth the trouble of reaching it. In front and to the right beautiful farms and meadows, woodlands and waving fields of grain now ripening for the harvest, while on the left stretched a belt of forest, which her companion at once pointed out as the Ferndale woods. Strong as was the constraint Ally had put upon herself, wise as were her resolutions, she had not yet learned to look with indifference upon even the trees of Ferndale. She turned her head away, that Cornelius might not per- ceive the emotion which the sight of them caused her. "Come," said he, after having rested himself by lean-   WALTER OGILBY.        525 ing awhile upon his gun, while he too took a survey of all around him, "let us go down there and walk a piece in the woods. It will be nice and cool, and there are always snipe or birds of some kind to be found there." But Ally had no intention of indulging herself-she turied resolutely from the temptation. "I prefer," said she, " to walk along the bank here. When I am tired I can take a seat and wait for your return." Cornelius left her, with a promise of soon rejoining her; and she continued pacing up and down along the high bank which overhung the rapid, foaming stream-now looking abroad over the landscape which lay bright in the yellow rays of the afternoon sun-now turning away, to commune with her own desolate thoughts. The young sportsman had been gone some time, and she was beginning to wonder what could so detain him. She seated herself upon a large stone a little shaded by a ragged thorn, but where she could command a view of the path by which he must return. She had been thus seated, she knew not how long, for her mind had travelled over many a past scene and many a happy hour, when suddenly raising her eyes in the di- rection of Ferndale, she perceived some one approaching. It was not Cornelius-there was no mistaking who it was. She started up, hardly knowing whether to turn and avoid, or to stand still and meet him. Apparently he had not observed her until now, for he raised both hands with a sudden gesture of surprise. At this moment a shot from a thicket on the side of the pasture-field in which they were, startled a group of young horses that were grazing near. It set them off at their utmost speed in a course around the field, the panic of each aggravating that of the others, until they plunged, tossing andcurveting, directly towards the spot where Ally stood. Her first impulse  &#xD;<pb n="526-527" xml:id="VAC7016-00000264"/> 526       WALTER OGILBY. was to spring aside at their approach, while Mr. Ogilby rushed forward, striving to intimidate or intercept them- but she was quite unaware of her proximity to the edge of the bank until she found herself losing her balance, and finally her footing, in a sudden descent of its steep side, ending in the shock of a violent fall as she reached the level below. For a moment she lay completely stunned-breathless- but was aroused to consciousness by the voice of Mr. Ogilby, who was striving to raise her from her position, half in half out of the water, while he poured forth every epithet of the most passionate tenderness and alarm. "Oh, my beloved I my darling I speak to me-tell me you are not killed. Father of mercies 1 she is dead. Oh, Alice, my precious, precious one! are you gone?" "No, no," sobbed Alice, as soon as she could speak. "I am not killed-I am not much hurt, I think. I was only stunned--I believe I fell upon a stone, and it took away my breath." She uttered these words with difficulty; and as he attempted to raise her, with a faint shriek she fell again to the earth. "What shall I do? what can I do for you?" exclaimed he in agony. "Don't, don't distress yourself," she said. "I shall be better presently-I am better already." Mr. Ogilby looked around in utter perplexity. The place in which they were was a small, semicircular spot, hemmed in at either end by a projecting spur jutting out into the water. He shouted for Cornelius, but was only answered by the echoes from the rocks around. "There is but one way to reach help," said he. "To attempt to carry you up that precipitous bank would be to hazard your life a second time. If you can bear to have me lift you,"-and again raising her with the utmost tender-   WALTER OGILBY.         527 ness he folded her in his arms, and succeeded in placing her in such a position as would enable himn to carry her without greatly adding to her sufferings. Soiled, draggled, her face and arms bleeding from con- tact with the briars and sharp stones, Ally could no longer bear up under the mingled tide of feeling. Her head sank unconsciously on Mr. Ogilby's shoulder, and she scarcely observed that it was into the water he was bearing her, in order to pass around the headland which obstructed their passage towards Milbank. How long their course con- tinued she knew not, but ere it was ended she heard a young voice cry,- "Mammy! mammy   here comes Mr. Walter bringing a sick woman in his arms 1" and they had soon entered the door of a dwelling-that of Armstrong the weaver. Alice had not quite fainted,-she was still conscious of the strong arm supporting her, the hand, gentle as a woman's, removing her bonnet, putting back the hair from her temples and bathing them with water, while an accent, the sweetest of all music to her ear, said,- "Now, Mrs. Armstrong, spread a clean napkin over the pillow, if you please, and bring me a thick shawl or a plaid to wrap around her, for she is completely wet and chilled." He had placed her upon the bed, but she did not imme- diately open her eyes. Tears were forcing themselves through her closed lids, but they were not tears of grief. Spite of pain, of fright, or agitation, they were tears of unutterable happiness. She heard him giving hurried orders to those around him,- "Bobby, ny man, run over the hill to Ferndale, and tell Patrick to bring the carriage here at once, and bid Michael Byrne to ride as fast as possible to Dr. Hardenberg's. Tell him to ask the doctor to come immediately to Milbauk--he is wanted there. Be sure you ask Michael to lose no time."  &#xD;<pb n="528-529" xml:id="VAC7016-00000265"/> 528       WALTER OGILB.  "Y les, sir," was the reply; and the quick, departing step told with what alacrity his orders were obeyed. Again he was leaning over her with anxious inquiries. He had placed his fingers on her wrist-with an involun-  tary motion she clasped her other hand around his, and for  a moment held it fast locked there. "Were you angry with me?" she whispered, for the first tinle raising her eyes to his. The words recalled all that in the first agony of alarm and solicitude he had ceased to remember-her position and his own "Angry?" exclaimed he. "God forbidl What right had I?" With difficulty could he repress a groan of anguish as he for a moment bowed his forehead upon the hands thus locked in his. There upon one small white finger was the ring which, as he doubted not, had sealed her love and promise to another I With one convulsive pressure he dis- engaged himself from her clasp, laid her handsgently down upon the coverlet, and left the apartment to conceal the emotion which he could no longer subdue. Ally, unsuspicious of all that was wringing his heart, saw in his movements only impatience for the arrival of the carriage. The pretty but not very tidy Scotswoman, who had at once recognized her guest, was assiduous in her attentions, begging to be permitted to make some application for her relief-a little wormwood and vinegar to her bruised side, or some spirits of camphor, with a few spoonfuls of mount- ain-dew and water to keep off the cold. "Mr. Ogilby," she said,' begged me to persuade you to have something done." Gently, but decidedly, Alice declined all further remedies until she should reach home. She wished for nothing but   WALTER OGILBY.        529 to lie undisturbed and meditate. What to her were wounds and bruises? Was not the cloud clearing away, and the sunlight about to break forth? Mr. Ogilby re-entered after a time to say that the car- riage had arrived. "Will you be so kind, Mrs. Armstrong, as to put on your bonnet and shawl and come with us?" he said. "Miss Morton will need your supporting arm." Then addressing her in an accent which, in spite of his efforts, retained its full measure of tenderness,- "Are you able, do you think, to be assisted -to the car- riage?" he inquired. Ally attempted, with Mrs. Arm- strong's assistance, to rise, but in vain--she sank back with an expression of great pain. There is no help for it," said Mr. Ogilby, as if to him- self-then wrapping around her the shawl with which she had been covered, he raised her with the gentlest care, and bore her to the carriage, in which, by his direction, Mrs. Armstrong was already seated. The sweet smile with which Alice, forgetful of her sufferings, regarded him, as, after having placed her care- fully in the supporting arms of her attendant, he took his seat opposite her, almost unmanned him. For the world he would not have read in it any other feeling than grati- tude for the services it had been in his power to render her. With no words spoken save his occasional cautions to Mrs. Armstrong, or directions to Patrick to drive slowly and carefully, they at length arrived at Milbank. Nothing was, as yet, to be seen of the doctor's equipage; but old Jake was in the act of driving from the door a horse and gig evidently just off a journey. "John Peter has returned," said Alice, faintly, as the vehicle caught her eye. Young Ellsworth, who was still standing upon the piazza, on perceiving the party stopping 45  &#xD;<pb n="530-531" xml:id="VAC7016-00000266"/> 530       WALTER OGILBY. at the gate, hastily came forward with a face full of wonder and alarm. "Why, my dear little Ally! What has happened?" cried he, opening the carriage door with some violence. "Ogilby, for heaven's sake, what is the matter with her?" "A fall down the bank along which she was walking," was Mr. Ogilby's reply, as he sprang out and would have  aided John Peter in lifting his cousin--but with a "Thank  you; thank you, let me carry her myself,'" the latter took her in his arms, and with the utmost good will, though, with far less skill and tenderness than that with which she had of late been ministered to, he bore her to the house. It was fortunate that Mrs. Armstrong had accompanied  Alice, for her aunt had gone out, no one knew whither, and  Ally was i. need of cares and attentions beyond what Dirtah  or Silvy could bestow. "Had you not better lay Miss Morton on the sofa for a few minutes?"Mr. Ogilby ventured to suggest. "No, I think not-Ally, I had better carry you right up to your room?"1 Ally was too ill and faint to make any objection; and Mr. Ogilby, who had no right to offer any further services, was left pacing the piazza until the arrival of Dr. Harden- berg should relieve him from suspense as to the actual injury which she had sustained. lb   WALTER OGILBY.        531 CHAPTER    LXIII. GREAT was the astonishment of the good doctor at being met on his arrival at Milbank by his young friend, whom he believed so far away. "Why, Walter! You here? How the deuce is that? What is the matter? Michael tells me about a young lady being hurt-not Ally, I hope." These. questions were uttered rapidly, and answered with equal promptness by Mr. Ogilby, a's he directed the doctor where to find his patient. "No bones broken you say? Able to speak! Not'the head then. Well, well, we'll see," and he mounted the stairs with his customary brisk step, leaving his friend pacing the piazza, and vainly attempting' to compose his disordered feelings. The time seemed interminable until the doctor reappeared. "How did you find her? Is there any serious injury?" were the eager questions. "No injury from the fall more serious than some pretty severe bruises and scratches,-enough to make her suffer a good deal. But her nerves are in a state of high excite- ment-has anything else happened?" The doctor looked searchingly at his youug friend, who muttered something, he scarcely knew what, about "fright," "agitation," "pain," and so forth. Agitation there certainly is," said the doctor, in a dis- satisfied tone; "but neither pain nor fright have brought Ally into the state in which I find her. However, I have given her an anodyne and bandaged her well with lint  &#xD;<pb n="532-533" xml:id="VAC7016-00000267"/> 532       WALTER OGILBY. and ' Goulard.' It will be some time before she is herself again. The chief difficulty is with her side, which must have received the full force of the blow as she fell. She must be kept quiet, perfectly quiet," repeated the doctor, with emphasis, "if we would escape an inflammation of some sort. Such falls and bruises in dog-days are no X trifle. But where the deuce is Aunt Aulchy? She's always  missing at the very time she's wanted. Fortunately such emergencies cor t but seldom," muttered he to himself.  "Mrs. Armstrong will, I doubt not, remain with Miss i Morton until her aunt's return, if she wishes it," said Mr. i Ogrilby. "Of course, of course; it will not do to leave her with those two darkies--good creatures, though, as ever was. But Mrs. Armstrong is a lady, or something like it, so let her stay by all means. John Peter, they tell me, has gone to look for his mother--most likely he will find her taking a comfortable gossip with her friend Katrinchie Bradford." The doctor took a few turns up and down the piazza, then suddenly recollecting himself, "But what brought you back so unexpectedly, Walter?" said he. "I thought you were playing the gallant at Saratoga, or some of those gay places." "I had business at home that required my attention," replied Mr. Ogilby, with a slightly embarrassed air. "Michael is to be married in a day or two, and I wished to give him a little holiday. It was better that I should be here just at this time, and make sure that matters were not neglected." He had evidently no wish to prolong the subject, for he immediately began inquiring, with apparent interest, after Mrs. Hardenberg and other friends. But the doctor had not obtained all the information he wished-he Soon brought him back to the original topic.   WALTER OGILBY.         533 "Tell me how all this happened," said he, " for I cannot make out, from what Ally says, poor child! Indeed, I saw it would not do to ask her many questions. What were you doing, or rather what was she doing, down in your neighborhood?" Mr. Ogillby gave such particulars as suited him, to which the doctor listened without comment. He was watching Walter's manner, and trying to reconcile it with a report that had somehow reached his ear, of his devotion to the beautiful widow, and the probability of their union at no distant day. Had Walter returned to  make arrangements previous to bringing home a bride? If so, that might account for his hesitation and embarrass- ment when questioned on the subject. But yet there was nothing like cheerful anticipation, nothing of the happy lover, in his deportment; and the doctor soon dismissed from his mind the fear of his young friend's having acted in such a fickle and inconsiderate manner. "And yet, after all," said he to himself, " why should I be unwilling that he should make another choice? If he cannot have Ally, why should I wish him to remain single and mourn for her?"These were questions he could not answer; yet he still felt that he should not approve of ]Walter's consoling himself with Mrs. Rutherford. He roused himself at his friend's suggestion that he should go once more and ascertain the state of his patient; and having brought the report that she was more com- posed and likely to sink into a quiet slumber, Mr. Ogilby felt that it was incumbent on him to take his departure. He could do nothing more for her. It was not his office to minister to her even words of comfort-the privilege which was vouchsafed   to strangers and menials was denied to him I He had placed her in the hands of those 45*  &#xD;<pb n="534-535" xml:id="VAC7016-00000268"/> 534       WALTER OGILBY.            j who had a right to soothe and tend her; and now he might betake himself to his solitary home, and to the companion- ship of his own mournful thoughts.           i In the quiet darkness most congenial to his feelings, he had abundant leisure to ruminate on all that had passed- to reproach himself for his own want of firmness and self- control. "Why did I suffer myself to utter those wild words in her hearing? Why did I dare call her by such names of endearment? Why did I for a moment forget that she was sacred, set apart, as if God's ordinance had already given her to another? And if she heard me I if she under- stood me I But no-that was impossible--she was stunned, unconscious. Accents of tenderness she may, after a time, have been sensible to, but they were such as a nurse, the veriest old crone, might have been permitted to use in a moment of alarm and compassion. More than that, she could not have understood, or she would have manifested her displeasure-she would have repulsed every indication of the feelings which I am now persuaded she never under- stood." Even the recollection of that one gesture which had for a moment sent such a thrill to his heart, strergth- ened his conviction that Ally was quite unsuspicious of his outhurst of feeling. "When she took my hand so artlessly in hers it was to show her gratitude, her sensibility to the solicitude I was feeling for her. She thought of me as ministering to her in the same spirit that my mother would have done. God grant that she may never be undeceived! That she may never suspect the pangs which my own self-deception have brought upon me!" In calmer moments Mr. Ogilby's thoughts turned to other scenes-to perplexities in his own position. Mrs. Rutherford had, indeed, been the principal cause of his   WALTER OGILBY.        ' 535 sudden return to his home, but it had been in a way quite different from that suggested by the fears of the doctor. From all that Mr. Buchanan had known of Mr. Ogilby, both before and after the death of his son-in-law, he had conceived the liglhest respect and admiration for him ; and since that event it had grown to be the predominating wish with the old gentleman to secure for his beautiful but volatile daughter the permanent guardianship of a man he so much esteemed. The necessity of visiting the United States to look after the affairs of his grandson was a pretext seized upon by the prudent Scotsman, as furnish- ing an occasion of bringing them again together. Now that the widow's prescribed term of mourning was past, it seemed to him scarcely possible that her beauty, grace, and fascinating manners, together with the tender bond of interest that united them in the person of the little god- son, should fail of inspiring Mr. Ogilby with a wish to be- come the protector for life of both. Opportunity-their being thrown much into each other's society-he believed to be all that would be required to bring about so desir- able a result. When he had summoned the young gentleman so hastily to New York, under the plea that his time in this country was limited, he had reserved to himself the right of chang- ing his plans and prolonging his sojourn, should circum- stances render such a course advisable. The earnestness with which Mr. Ogilby devoted himself to the business in hand, and the promptness with which he investigated all its details, until a clear and satisfactory statement of the whole was obtained, were attributed by the old gentleman not to the anxiety of the former to re- turn to his home, but to an interest in the subject itself; while his efforts to prevent the long, rainy week in a strange city from hanging heavy on the hands of his  &#xD;<pb n="536-537" xml:id="VAC7016-00000269"/> 536       WALTER OGILBY. friend's widow, were interpreted into a disposition to re- commend himself as a lover. That Mr. Ogilby had taken leave without having spoken to the point, was a source of mortification to both father and daughter. But a scheme in which both had become deeply interested could not be so easily abandoned-it was necessary to have recourse to a new device. After a short interval a letter was written, as we have seen, proposing to Mr. Ogilby to join them in an excursion to Saratoga and Niagara. The invitation was accepted, although not quite in accordance with the intentions of Mr. Buchanan or his daughter. It was no part of their plan that the party should have been augmented by the addition of the Van Nesses and the ladies of Mr. Ogilby's- family. It was easy to foresee that this change would necessarily interfere with the possibility of Mrs. Rutherford's appropria- ting, Mr. Ogilby entirely. That she made the best use of the advantages remaining to her-that she exerted all her various powers of attrac- tion in his behalf,-that her delicate health and occasionally weak spirits were regarded as establishing a constant claim on his sympathy and attentions,--could not long be unob- served by Mr. Ogilby, and they would have made his situa- tion sufficiently embarrassing, even had he been spared the intelligible hints of the old-fashioned, plain-spoken father, who rather regarded the whole matter as a business trans- action which might properly be discussed, since his own large fortune would enable him to make it as much for the advantage of the one as the other. It is not surprising that Mr. Ogilby had hailed the ac- cession to their party of the young clergyman, Mr. Lud- low, as affording him an opportunity of a few days' ab- sence, during which time he hoped the fancy of the lady might be diveirted from- himself to some one among her   WALTER OGILB1Y.        537 numerous admirers, and he be released from his unpleasant position. Thus it had happened that he was at Ferndale just at this juncture. It will be easily understood that it was not possible to assign-to the doctor the true reasons which had prompted his return. Mr. Ogilby on the following morning debated for a short time in his own mind the question of calling at Milbank to inquire after the health of Miss Morton. The decision was- first, that it was proper; second, that it was indispensable. No further time was therefore lost before setting forth. He was received with loquacious cordiality by Aunt Aulchy. "Oh, Mr. Walter!" she began, "to think of such an acci- dent! What a blessin' that you was there just at that mo- ment I Ally might have laid and died, only for that I I do be- lieve you saved her life!-Oh, I thank you I she is better this mornin'. She has had a poor night, though. She's terribly bruised, and her face so scratched I She won't be able to go to the weddin'--it's to be next week, you know. And to think of her beautiful blue silk dress that I made her a present of, and that Mary Carroll would insist on making up for her, though she was so busy gettin' ready for her own weddin'-and now she won't be able to wear it!" "tIas Dr. Hardenberg be en here this morning?" asked Mr. Ogilby. "Yes, and he says she's a doin' pretty well, but she must not be worried by any manner of means; he was wery par- ticular about that.

"The best thing, then, for the safety of the neighbor- hood," said her husband, without looking up from his newspaper, " would probably be, mother, for you to give up your habit of eating a hearty supper before going to bed." "I don't know as that would make any difference," said Aunt Aulchy, with a sigh. "I'll ask the doctor what he thinks of it, for I'm sure I don't want to bring trouble on Ally, nor anybody else. Such a figure as she is, to be sure, poor child I I could not help sayin' to her this mornin' when I looked at her face, Ally, my dear, you must excuse me, but really you do look like the Old Scratch." And the good lady laughed immoderately at her own witticism,- then bustling about and ringing the bell, "Here, Silvy," she said, " bring some water to put these beautiful flowers in that Mr. Walter has brought, and take them right up to Miss Ally. She's fond of flowers, and some- how, ours don't seem to do as well as yours. And there's the grapes that Michael Byrne brought this mornin'! What beauties they were! Gitty was home for a little while on her way to the willage, of an errand for Philly, and she said we'd better not let Ally know anything about them, for she might want to eat them, and they might not be good for her." "If I had not been certain they were quite harmless I should not have sent them," said Mr. Ogilby. "So I told her. It's wery likely Mr. Walter knows, said I. And I carried them right up to her, and Ally looked so pleased!" "Is Miss Morton able to sit up:at all?" "Oh I dear, no indeed I It was just as much as we could do to lift her from the bed on to the little couch in front   WALTER OGILBY.        539 of the window, so she could look off at the mountains as she always likes to. But we have to keep her wery quiet, just as the doctor ordered. I wouldn't let John Peter just speak to her through the door this mornin', though he was crazy to, bult I said 'no'--I shan't allow it: it might worry her, and then the doctor wouldn't like it. 'Worry her,' he says, 'it would cure her if anything would;' but I didn't give in. But, dear me! don't be hurryin' away, Mr. Walter. Gitty will be here to-rights. She's only gone to the wil- lage with Garret, for somethin' that's wantin' down at Cousin Abram's. Such grand doin's as they are goin' to have! When I got there vesterday afternoon,-that's where I was, that time they couldn't find me: I had seen Anthony Wan Wyck a drivin' past, and I called to him to take me a ride down there, to see what they was all about,-well, when I got there, the first thing I saw was Teuny Bent- house with his coat off, measurin' and figurin' how much factory muslin it would take to enclose the piazza, and how much floorin' was to be laid to make it wide enough to dance on, and calculatin' how many suspension lamps they must have, and how many yards of wreath to go round the doors, I can tell you what, Michael Byrne will have to look out for his marigolds and his chiny-astors-we shall rob the whole neighborhood.

And without waiting for the pleasure of seeing either John Peter or his sister, Mr. Ogilby took his leave. CHAPTER LXIV. AUNT AULCHY'S prediction proved true. Ally did not recover sufficiently to participate in the wedding festivities. For many days she lay upon her couch, striving to sup- port, without murmuring, the pain, not of the outward bruises, but of the wounded spirit within. When she heard, after a time, of Mr. Ogilby's having returned to Saratoga to join his family and friends, it was almost without a feeling of surprise. From the moment he had placed her in the carriage, to convey her from Mrs. Armstrong's cottage to Milbank, she had observed the change which had come over him. Gentle as were his words, kind and solicitous as was his care for her comfort, she could not but perceive that she was no longer to him what she had been in the first moments of her danger. Though he had then called her "his own.," "his beloved," she was such no longer. He had drawn back ceremoni- ously while her cousin offered her those attentions which, a few brief moments before, he had so assiduously lavished upon her. "Why, oh why, did he return?" she would sdmetimes say to herself. "Had he remained away, had I not known that his sentiments were still those of regard for me, I might in time have learned to forget him." And yet, Ally in her secret heart was glad that she had not been thus taught indifference or forgetfulness I   WALTER OGILBY.        541 The rumors of Mr. Ogilby's devotion to Mrs. Ruther- ford-of his intended marriage-were discussed in her presence. Gertrude invariably professed herself certain of their being well founded, and as Ally opposed no question or dissent, she began to hope that all her interest in the sub- ject had quite passed away. She had satisfied herself that they had not met after Ally's accident-that Mr. Ogilby had not sought an interview, but that having waited, as was natural under the circumstances, until he heard of Ally's recovery so far as to leave her couch, he had de- parted to complete the summer's tour which had been so strangely interrupted. She did not think it singular that the finest flowers and the choicest fruits were still brought constantly from Ferndale,-nor that Michael Byrne, who was now married, should inform himself carefully, upon each occasion, of Miss Morton's health. She doubted not that a faithful account of all that he could learn at Mil- bank was duly transmitted to his benefactor, and she read in all Mr. Ogilby's proceedings a lingering of former affec- tion sufficient to preserve him from the blandishments of the fair widow, yet at the same time a hopelessness that would secure his absence until after the return of Alice to her home. Mr. Halford did not see Alice until several days after his return from Nine Partners. He heard of her, how- ever, almost every hour in the day, and, thanks to the communicative disposition of Anne Eliza, he was kept in- formed not only of her progress towards recovery, but also of every trifling particular that might indicate the state of her mind or feelings. "Ally is getting to be a little more like herself," was the information she gave one morning as she was carelessly arranging her curls before the glass. "The side of her " -'  &#xD;<pb n="542-543" xml:id="VAC7016-00000272"/> 542       WALTER OGILBY. face is not quite such a rainbow as it was-red, blue, green and yellow! I do not think there will be any scars or marks left. What a mercy that her nose escaped! And how strange that Mr. Ogilby- should have taken himself off in that manner, without waiting to see how she was ?P going to look, or indeed how the matter was going to ter- minate! I think that shows that he did not consider it any business of his." 'Have not you yet left off speculating about Mr. Ogilbyv and his affairs?1" asked her cousin. "No, Cousin Pinckney, and neither have you. I believe, if you would but own it, you feel as much curiosity about his ways and doings as I do." This was too near the truth for Mr. Halford to relish, or to deny, so he preserved a dignified silence. The young lady went on,- "-But as for Ally, my mind is quite decided about her; and I begin to see that I was mistaken in supposing, as I once did, that she had any stronger feeling for Mr. Ogilby than mere friendship." Mr. Halford's interest was thoroughly excited, but he had so often reproved his little cousin for her indiscreet curiosity, that he could not venture to satisfy his own by asking her a question. He laid down his book, then took it up again,-but it was easy to see-that his-attention was not engaged by its pages. Anne Eliza could not resist the temptation of playing with his feelings a little while longer. She had finished twisting her curls, and she turned herself a little sideways and gave a pull to the folds of her dress to settle them, as she remarked,-- "They say that Mr. Ogilby called regularly every day to inquire about her, and was constantly sending some- thing that he thouoght would please her; and Dinah says   i WALTER OGILBY.        543 that after he brought her home that evening, as he was walking about on the piazza, he looked just like death." "All that is very natural," observed Mr. Halford; " but I cannot see that sympathy with her sufferings under such an accident imposed upon Mr. Ogilby any necessity of remaining in the neighborhood longer than he found con- venient. " ",I suppose he left orders when he went away," pur- sued his cousin, " that all the nicest things from the con- servatory should still be brought to Ally." Mr. Halford closed his book suddenly arid rose as if to leave the room. "If he knew with how much indifference they are re- ceived, I think he would perhaps feel a little mortified." "I thought Miss Morton was fond of flowers," said the young gentleman, reseating himself. "So she used to be, but now when Silvyv comes up every morning with her bouquet, and her 'Miss Ally, Michael Byrne brings ye these 'ere, and wants to know particular how ye do to-day,' she takes them and says, 'Tell Michael I am much obliged to him for his kindness and I am almost entirely well.' Then she puts the flowers in a glass of water, and never seems to take any more notice of them." "And the fruit which I observe he often brings?" "Oh!" said his cousin, laughing, "Aunt Aulchy takes care of that. She comes in and helps herself to a little, and a little, just to see how it tastes, till finally there is nothing left but the plate. It makes no difference to Ally who takes it. I've watched her, and I am positive she never touches a bit of it. No," said she, turning to leave the room, "I am quite clear that, whatever liking there may have been between them, it is all over on her part." The day before the wedding was the first on which Ally ,   . -     ,  &#xD;<pb n="544-545" xml:id="VAC7016-00000273"/> 544       WALTER OGILBYX ventured again to join the family circle. There were few of its members remaining at home, for John Peter and the three young ladies had gone to the Orchards to lend their assistance in completing the preparations for the following day. Mr. Halford had at first volunteered his services, but upon a suggestion from Mrs. Ellsworth that she in- tended to have her niece down to dinner, he thought it would perhaps be better if some one of the young people should remain to bear her company, and Gertrude being precisely of his opinion, it was decided that he should defer his visit until later in the day. Her uncle, who had missed her more than he could have believed possible, carefully assisted Ally down-stairs, and placed her in an arm-chair in the cool, shady drawing- room. She was very pale, and one side of her face still bore a few disfiguring marks. When, after she was seated, Mr. Halford came in to pay his respects, and to express his sympathy for all that she had suffered, his earnest, tender manner brought a slight color to her cheeks, and made her, in his eyes, more beautiful than ever. In the course of time both Mr. and Mrs. Ellsworth were called away by some business, and it was left to Mr. Halford, exclusively, to entertain the invalid He brought his portfolio, at her request, to show her what he had been doing in his absence. There were pic- tures of homesteads, and mills, and farm-yards; Dutch vrows and broad-faced, white-haired children; peeps into kitchens and dairies, with various other sketches of nature, animate and inanimate, each of which he accompanied with some description or some narration which Ally found both amusing and interesting. With so much pleased attention did she examine piece after piece, and listen to his lively comments on them, that Mr. Halford was quite enchanted. A   WALTER OGILBY.         545 "I had hardly hoped to see you so well," said he, earn- estly. "You are more cheerful even than before we went away-more like your former self." Ally's face became grave in an instant. Forgetfulness had been but for a moment, and with returning thought vanished all her temporary animation. Mr. Halford's manner disturbed her, but she strove to answer him with a calm and steady voice, as she again took up a piece she had just laid aside. There is something in the first release from a sick- room," she said, "and in the congratulations with which our friends welcome us, that ought to make us cheerful, If more were wanting, your portfolio," and she exerted her- self to smile, "would certainly furnish it." "I dare not flatter myself with the power to raise more than a transient smile on Miss Morton's cheek," said Mr. Halford, in an altered tone. "God knows that if there were aught I could do--if the devotion of my life--Miss Morton," continued he, with sudden vehemence, "I must speak out, even at the risk of offending you--I cannot see your sweet life darkened, blighted by the caprice and self- ishness of one who, so far from valuing the priceless treas- ure of your affection, a treasure that he has used every art to gain, now throws it from him 1" "Mr. Halford!" said Ally, with mounting color and a voice nearly inarticulate with agitation, "these are very strange words that you are speaking!" "Yes, they are strange,-and yet, cost what it will, I cannot refrain from uttering them," replied he, his impetu- ous Southern blood quite getting the mastery. "You must hear that there is one who, if God had granted him the boon of such a heart, who even now, if any devotion, any sacrifice could win him permission to consecrate his every effort, every thought to the restoration of that peace, "*  &#xD;<pb n="546-547" xml:id="VAC7016-00000274"/> 546       WALTER OGILBY ] that sunny happiness which neglect and coldness have driven from you, would esteem it the crowning blessing of his life. Oh, Miss Morton!" continued he with a burst of feeling, "can you imagine that because honor and the respect due you, made me a silent spectator of all that has been going on during thellast few weeks, I have also been an indifferent one? I have seen the assiduities of Mr. Ogilby to win your affection-his desertion when he believed his aim accomplished. I have longed to speak out. I could not have refrained, had my feelings been only those of a friend or a brother. I should, long ere this, knowing what I did, have entreated you to cast from your heart one who was unworthy of it. But I restrained myself-I distrusted my own motives-I was afraid of pronouncing an unjust judgment, even hen circumstances seemed unmistakable. If you could knbw how deeply, how devotedly I have loved you, you would appreciate my forbearance. But you have not seen my feelings, because your gentle, unselfish spirit is never looking abroad for admiration,-and still more, because your heart was occupied by one image to the exclusion of all others. But, dearest Miss Morton, ask yourself whether it is wise to throw away your young, fresh affections upon one who values them so little. Let me entreat you to consult your own future happiness, for it is for that that I plead, and not for myself, though I offer you all that man can offer to woman-my life, my every thought and faculty, if that could suffice for your acceptance. I do not ask you to say that you will be mine. I only entreat you to make an- effort to see things as they are, and to banish from your! heart one so lost to every feeling of honor and tender- ness." Ally had turned her face away from Mr. Halford, and her tears were falling fast while he went on with an earn-   WALTER OGILBY.        547 estness that would not be controlled. Her first feeling had been one of indignation, but this soon became softened by his evident sincerity and disinterestedness. As he paused for an answer, she succeeded in commanding her- self sufficiently to say, gently,. "I ought to be perfectly frank with you, in return for the kind feelings you have expressed for me,-I can in no  other way show you how much I appreciate your sym- pathy. I will say to you, what I could have said to no  other person-you misjudge Mr. Ogilby. You are mis- taken in supposing that his regard for me has changed. Something, I know not what, has occurred to produce an estrangement between us-something which, as we may never meet again, will perhaps never be explained-some-  thing which makes him as wretched as it does me. I do not deceive myself. I heard from his own lips, when he believed me unconscious, words which convince me that I am not mistaken. I tell you this, because I know your generosity-that you do not wish to think ill of Mr. Ogilby  i unless compelled to do so. I do not doubt-I have never for a moment doubted his integrity and honor. If you cannot quite think with me, still I know you will not pain  me by expressing an opinion which only adds to my un- happiness. Whatever the cloud that has interposed be-    :i! tween us, I fully believe that it will one day be removed,  and that you will do him justice. It may be too late for  ! my happiness," said she, with faltering voice, "but in the I mean time I must still continue to-nothing could ever make me think differently of him."              j "I have no right to argue with you," said Mr. Halford, after a short pause. "I have certainly, as you suppose, no desire to think ill of one in whom you are so deeply  interested. Perhaps I ought not to say that it is difficult ji to imagine an obstacle so suddenly and so mysteriously    i t'iI  &#xD;<pb n="548-549" xml:id="VAC7016-00000275"/> 548       WALTER OGILBY. interposed, which a few words of explanation would not remove. But, pardon me," said he, observing the pained expression of Ally's countenance, "I did not intend to grieve you. I began with the single wish of winning you from your present unhappiness, but my feelings hurried me away before I was aware, and I have only to ask your forgiveness for having disturbed and distressed you, when you. were so little able to bear it." He rose to leave the room. Ally held out her hand to him. "Do not think me perverse or ungrateful," said she, as he took it and held it for a moment in both of his. "Try to think of me only as faithful to what I believe to be true and right-as you will one day wish the woman you love, not from pity, but from your heart of hearts, to be faithful to you." Mr. Halford raised her hand for a moment to his lips, and then turned and left the apartment. This unexpected declaration was no small aggravation of the sorrow that Ally was already suffering. She looked back upon her past intercourse with Mr. Halford, to see if there had been anything in her deportment that could possibly have misled him, but her conscience entirely acquitted her. His own admission, too, that he had all along seen how her heart was engrossed with another would have relieved her from any self-accusation. She wished he had been so convinced of this as not to have hoped to replace that other-and she tried to persuade her- self that a feeling which had originated, as she doubted not, solely in sympathy for her, and indignation against Mr. Ogilby, would not continue long to cloud the happiness of one so estimable. Notwithstanding all the comfort she was able to derive from these hopes, she was still in a wretched state of feeling when her aunt at length remem- bered to look in upon her.   WALTER OGLBEI        549 "Mercy on us! Ally, my dear, you here alone?  I thought Mr. Halford was with you. Why, you look ten times worse than you did I don't think comin' down- stairs agrees with you yet-you had better let us help you back to your room again 1"Ally assented, for she did not feel equal to meeting Mr. Halford again, at present. 'She might have spared herself all solicitude on that subject, for Mr. Halford had gone out for a walk, from which he did not return until evening. Her aunt commented to her, on the following morning, on what she had remarked in her guest. "I do believe, Ally, that Mr. Halford is feelin' bad about not bein' one of Philly's groomsmen. 1 really think that when Walter Ogilby backed out, they might have asked him. Nobody likes to be overlooked, and it is wery natural that he should feel it. If I wasn't afraid of makin' Gitty angry, I'd just ask John Peter to give up his place to him!" rThe wedding of Anthony and Phillippina took place, and it was, as had been intended, a very splendid affair. Music from the city, all the first families for miles around, military beaux from West Point, and, as a natural consequence, no small rivalry among the belles, it being the prerogative of those whose trade is war to bring discord even among the softest and fairest. Among all that seemed so promising, there were not wanting circumstances to disappoint and distress Gertrude. Instead of the gallant Captain Carter came only a note of apology, setting forth that he had received orders to repair to' a distant post upon some unexpected duty, which would make it impossible to fulfil his engagement of revisiting Miibank. Gerardus had been chosen to supply the place of Mr. Ogilby as groomsman, and in some way, without her con- currence or approbation (for all matters pertaining to the  &#xD;<pb n="550-551" xml:id="VAC7016-00000276"/> 550       WALTER OGILB.: wedding being now completed, people began to grow inde- pendent), he and pretty Katy Van Antwerp, in whose favor Miss Sarah Ann had abdicated, were assigned to each other, and Gitty found herself left to stand up with her Cousin Garret. To add to her chagrin, Gerardus, whose value in her eyes was just now immensely on the increase, had taken up his quarters with the Van Antwerps, and showed no dis- position to renew his former devotion. A short period of visiting and amusement succeeded the departure of the newly-married couple, and then john Peter was ordered to join his regiment at Fort Independence. The Miss Westbrooks returned to the city, and Gertrude, as had been her intention ever since she learned that Sep- tember was the month appointed for Mr. Buchanan and his daughter to sail for Scotland, accompanied them. Anne Eliza, and even Catlyna, had urged Ally to be of the party. The former in particular, who had been won by the gentle, obliging qualities of the latter to a strong feeling of regard, and even to a faint determination at times to follow so lo!Ihan example, expressed the sorrow she felt at part- ing with her in her customary unmeasured terms. ( Now, Ally, if you want to do good, and teach me how to grow a better girl, vou'll just come with us, when I beg and tease you to. I have grown some better since I have been with you--even Lyna can't deny that. I am sure you would do Lyna a great deal of good too-I can see that she is not half so snappish as she used to be; are you, Lyna? Come, we'd soon make you laugh again, and be as gay as you used to!" But Ally resolutely declined. She had no heart for the gayeties and diversions which the others were anticipating with so much eagerness. She longed only to be at home.- in the bosom of her own dear family, which she now wished again and again that she had never quitted.   WALTER OGILBY.         551 "Yet; why should I indulge such a feeling?" she said to herself. "If discipline was necessary for mne, would not nmy heavenly Father have found a time and a place to ad- minister it? Only, I think I could have borne it better if the trial had come in any other shape!" Mr. Ellsworth, whose business took him to New Haven about the time appointed for Ally's return, was, by agree- ment, to meet his brother-in-law there, and return his daughter again to his care. Gertrude carried her point of getting him off at the same time that sheand her cousins took their departure. She had no. idea of leaving Ally behind to the possible chance of another unexpected encounter with Mr. Ogilby. Many were the tears which would not be restrained as Alice took leave of her friends, and as she looked around on scenes so beautiful and so dear that she was now quitting -perhaps forever. She had heard nothing more of the Ogilbys (she per- sisted now in speaking of them, even to herself, in the plural number) except that from Mrs. Van Ness she learned that Christina and William Henry would return home very shortly, but that the rest of the party would, after their return from Quebec and Boston, remain awhile in New York. Nothing was added which could decide the question whether Mrs. Rutherford would return to Scotland with her father, or whether she would remain in the United States with Mr. Ogilby.  &#xD;<pb n="552-553" xml:id="VAC7016-00000277"/> 552       WALTER OGILBY. CHAPTER IXV. SUMMER, with all its glories, had passed away. "Brown Autumn" had "spread its store," and had, in turn, been gathered into the lap of Winter. The brilliant foliage of the maple, the hickory, and the ash no longer lay in con- trast with the dark evergreens on the mountain-side, but in their place hung undistinguishable masses drooping be- neath a canopy of snow, which somewhat earlier than usual, powdered the landscape around. Mrs. Ogilby had hoped much from the influence of time and reflection in restoring her son's cheerfulness, but she saw with pain that his disappointment still preyed upon him. No duties, it is true, were neglected; no attention to the comfort of others lost sight of; no moody reveries indulged in,-still the mother could not disguise from her- self that he was not the Walter of former days. She rarely alluded to the subject which, she doubted not, was still most frequently present with him. He had been perfectly unreserved with her at the first, but from that time forward she perceived that he avoided, as much as possible, mentioning the name of Miss Morton. When he had rejoined his party at Ballston, after his short return to Ferndale, she had naturally inquired whether he had met Alice during his stay, and he had given her briefly the history of her accident, and of his having conveyed her home to Milbank. When he added that he did not see her again during his visit, she understood that nothing had occurred to change their position tawards each other. The mere circumstance of their having been thrown to-   WA LTER OGILB Y        553 gether ii this manner, sufficiently accounted for the added shade of melancholy which was for a time apparent in his countenance and manner. Everything abroad now looked cold and desolate. Out- door occupations were at an end, and although the family fireside was made, as much as possible, a scene of social comfort, yet Mrs. Ogilby felt that some change for her son, even if it were but another temporary removal from the scene of former happiness and former sufferings, might be beneficial. She ventured to urge him to visit the me- tropolis, or the seat of government, to try an absence from home under less embarrassing circumstances than had at- tended their summer's trip; but he resisted the suggestion. "No, mother," he said, "I am better at home than any- where else. In time, when I know she is married and happy, I shall feel differently. But-that is the thing that troubles me. John Peter is a fine fellow, yet I cannot help feeling that there is a want of congeniality between them. The conviction is ever present with me that she is not happy now,-that she will be still less so after she is his wife.'" , "I fear you are right," replied his mother. "I have heard it remarked, by more than one, how changed she was during the latter part of her visit to Milbank,-that she seemed to have lost all her fine spirits." "Yes-even her aunt spoke of it, when I was at Mil- bank a few days since. A letter had just been received from her, and that led to the remark that she did not write as funny letters to her uncle as she once used to." "Was Gertrude present?  Did she make any com- ment?" "Yes-she contradicted her mother, of course -said that Miss Morton was perfectly well, and that she wrote 47    &#xD;<pb n="554-555" xml:id="VAC7016-00000278"/> 554       WALTER OGILBY. in fine spirits. She took occasion, too, to let me know that the surest way they had of getting news from her brother, was through her cousin's letters. She did not dwell- upon the subject, however, but began describing to me the gay doings they had in the city after we left." "And what were they?" asked his mother, hoping to lead his thoughts in another direction. "I could not describe the half of them. I remember there was a history of a noble Spanish exile, a most ele- gant and charming person, with whom she had danced at the Castle Garden ball, and who was very devoted in hi's attentions to her uncle's family afterwards. I infer that he is living at present only in the hope of seeing her again when she revisits her cousins after the holidays. Mrs. Ellsworth suggested that her husband should speak to the President, when he goes to Washington this winter, and beg him to write to the King of Spain to give back this charming nobleman's estates, and permit him to return to his own country." "Kind-hearted Aunt Aulchy I I dare say she was quite in earnest." "That she certainly was; for she added that, supposing he should wish to marry one of' our American young ladies, he could not expect her to have him without a cent in his pocket, let her have ever so great a taste for econ- omy."' "Did Gertrude lootpnoyed at her mother's remarks?" "Not in the least. To make the whole appear merely a joke, she said, in the simplest manner, that the Presi- dent might spare himself all trouble in the matter, for she had made up her mind to write to the King of Spain her- self and have justice done to the persecuted grandee.1' A few days had passed since this conversation when, one morning after the letters were brought in from the   WALTER OGILBY.         5F5 post-office, Mrs. Ogilby observed her son pondering over an open one which he held in his hand. "Have you received any unpleasant news?" inquired she, as she noticed his thoughtful countenance. "Unpleasant 1" said he, starting ; " not in the least. I have a letter from my old classmate, Carey,-he is again in New Haven." "What does he write?" "His letter is about a course of lectures to be delivered by Professor S----; such a course, I judge, as no one ever had the privilege of listening to before,-something to ex- ceed all that was ever dreamed of in man's philosophy. You know Carey is always in extacies." "And he wishes you to join him, and attend this course of lectures with him,-is not that it?" "Yes--that is the object of his letter." "And you will go, of course,-you have made up your mind to do so?" "Not quite yet, -my dear mother It would require more than five minutes to decide on leaving home for two months." "Oh, you must go, my son, by all means. Nothing could have happaftl more opportunely. This is just the sort of occupation your mind requires. You will refresh your old stock of knowledge, as well as gain much that is new, to prepare you for future usefulness. There is, I suppose, no titme to be lost, for the lectures must be about commenc- ing." Mr. Ogilbv thought upon the subject, and the result was a conviction that his mother's advice was, salutary, and a determination to follow it. In a little more than a week from this time he was at- tending, with his friend Carey, the professor's lectures, in New Haven.  &#xD;<pb n="556-557" xml:id="VAC7016-00000279"/> 556       WAL TER O GIL B I. There had been one point on his route thither where, by turning aside, he could in two hours' time have been at Ashfield! But what had he to do with Ashfield? What now was the place or its denizens to him? Something to be, if possible, forgotten I He was soon, in compliance with the earnest solicita- tion of his friend, as well as of his former acquaintances, mingling in the agreeable and intellectual circles which have, from time immemorial, rendered the "City of Elms" so attractive. At a little party at the house of one of the professors, he one evening fell in company with a young gentleman whose pleasant, honest countenance particularly pleased him, and made him regret that, amid the buzz of conver- sation, and the sounds of music, he had not been able to catch the name by which he was introduced. The conversation fell upon the topics usual between strangers--the place itself, its society, its environs,-East Rock and West Rock. From the latter the transition was natural to mountain scenery in general-the Catskills, the Highlands, some fine engravings of which lay upon a table near them. Mr. Ogilby, while admiring one of the latter, pointed out some inaccuracies in the details which took from the effect of the piece. "You seem quite familiar with this scene?" observed his companion. "I ought to be," said Mr. Ogilby, smiling; "it is my home." "Ah 1 is it possible? You live among the Highlands?" "Just at the foot of this elevation, behind what here shows as a rising ground," said Mr. Ogilby, indicating a spot in the picture before him. "And have you been there this summer?"   WAL TER OGILBF.  Mr. Ogilby's brow clouded. "Only a part of it," he said. "Still, you may possibly have met an old friend of mine who has been passing the summer there." "What is the name of the gentleman?" "Not a gentleman at all," said the other, laughing, "but a young lady, and a very lovely young lady too. Miss Morton, our clergyman's daughter." "Yes," said Mr. Ogilby with an effort to. preserve his usual calm tone, "I have had the pleasure of meeting both Mr. Morton and his daughter." "I am sure," said the young stranger, "I need not ask if you did not admire Miss Morton-everybody must do that. But unless you knew her well, you could not ap- preciate her. She is the best, friend I ever had-the dearest friend my sister ever had. Did you visit much at Mr. Ellsworth's? For if you had talked much with Miss Morton I am sure she would have spoken to you of her friend Kate Andrews." "And perhaps of her brother James, too," said Mr. Ogilby pleasantly, as he recognized in his companion that "respectable young man," whom he had once honored with a slight fit of jealousy. The accuracy of Ally's description almost caused him a smile as the young man went on, with eager satisfaction. "Did Ally speak of me?" (Mr. Ogilby could not under- stand the necessity of such a familiar abbreviation in the mouth of Mr. James Andrews.) "Well, that is not strange perhaps. How came she to? What did she say?" "The same that you have just said-that you were one of her best friends. I hope Miss Morton is quite well." "Yes, quite well. No, no,-what am I thinking of? That is just like me. I often say, 'Verv well, I thank you,' purely from habit. No-I don't think your mount- 47*  &#xD;<pb n="558-559" xml:id="VAC7016-00000280"/> 558       WALTER OGITLBY. ain air agreed with Ally at all-But there I They are breaking up, and as I have a youngt lady under my charge I must run and see after her. I wish they could have waited a quarter of an hour longer I But come and spend to-morrow evening with me, at my room down in Chapel Street,"--Mr Andrews drew out his card,--" and we will finish our talk about old friends. By-the-by daughing), I must ask your card in return, for they were keeping up such a noise at the piano that I did not learn to whom I have had the pleasure of talking. Ah! Mr.' Ogilby I is it indeed? I am extremely glad to find that the person I am getting so intimate with is Mr. Ogilby.. You and Mr. Morton met, I remember he told me, on the road, as he was taking Ally to her uncle's, last spring. Oh I foresee that we shall be the best of friends!"And the young gentleman hastened away, to join his fair com- panion. CHAPTER LXVI. As may be imagined, Mr. Ogilby passed the time inter- vening before his visit to Mr. Andrews in no very tran- quil frame of mind. This was the first opportunity of gaining information about Alice, on which he could rely, and the hints he had received in regard to her health filled him with sorrow and alarm. It accorded too well with what he had sus- pected-that she was not happy. He could not doubt that her failing health was the consequence of mental dis- quiet. He was punctual to the appointed hour, on the follow- '   WALTER OGILBY.         559 ing evening, and found his new acquaintance waiting for him with an air of impatience. Almost his first saluta- tion was,-- "You must go up to Ashfield and spend Christmas with us. I have just got a letter from my sister, begging me to bring one or two of my friends to spend the holi- days. She is going to give a party, a great event in our little circle, I assure you-and there is rather a dearth of beaux at Ashfield." "I am afraid it will not be in my power to accept your kind invitation, though it would give me very great pleas- ure to see my acquaintances there again. You did not tell me how Mr. Morton was," said Mr. Ogilby, anxious to lead the conversation at once to the all-engrossing sub- ject. "Oh  he is very well-very well for him, that is. Scarcely any rheumatism this winter. His trip to Dutch- ess County was of service to him, whatever it may have  been to his daughter." "And she, you say, is not as well as formerly? She had a severe fall,--you doubtless heard of it. Do you think," inquired Mr. Ogilby anxiously, " she still feels the effects of it?" "No, she says not. Indeed she will not admit that she is otherwise than quite well; but we, who see her so un- like what she once used to be, of course know that some- thing is the matter. It is natural that she should try and hide it from her father-it is always natural for Ally to think of the comfort of others, before her own. Colonel Grafton, whose regiment is at the South, was anxious to take her there to spend the winter with them, but she would not hear of it. Her father urged her, and so did my sister Kate, but it was of no use." For a  moment Mr. Ogilby could not speak. His heart  &#xD;<pb n="560-561" xml:id="VAC7016-00000281"/> 560       WALTER OGILBIT was filled with fears of, he knew not what. But he must learn further-he must question still more closely. "She would naturally object," said he, with forced calm- ness, " to going so far away at present. Has Lieutenant Ellsworth been at Ashfield lately?" Andrews looked hard at him for a moment. "Not since summer," he replied. "Why do you ask?" "I thought he had perhaps an attraction there that would lead him to make frequent visits." This was said so gravely that again his host looked at him with a puzzled air. "Yes," replied he, "I suppose he has; but how did you hear of it'? It was not to have been known until the expi- ration of a year. However, I suppose these things always do come out, some way or another; and since my father has given his consent, and begins to like John Peter so well--But, my dear fellow I what is the matter with you? You are as pale as death I It is this horrid sea-coal fire, I know : it always makes a person sick who is unaccustomed to it. Come out here into the entry," said he, throwing open the door, " and walk about a little in the cool, fresh air, to recover yourself." And the kind-hearted young man ran for a glass of water. Mr. Ogilby had indeed need to walk long by himself in silence and in solitude before he could fully collect his scattered senses. The revulsion of feeling, the joy, the amazement, the gratitude were almost more than he could bear. "She might then be his!" that was the one predominant thought. "She was not another's-she was free-fettered by no promise I How could Gitty have so deceived him? And how-oh, how could he have so deceived himself-- so doubted the truth of that loving, trusting heart?" "And yet, how could all the circumstances be explained? Was James Andrews certain, quite certain, of the fact of   WALTER OGILBY.         561 its being his sister to whom Ellsworth was paying his addresses?" He must calm himself and return to seek further. ex- planations-to hear all that his young friend had to impart. He must learn by what train of circumstances he had been so cruelly misled-in what way his happiness, and, worse than all, the happiness of one dearer to him than life, had been so compromised. "Ah, now you are yourself again!" said his host, as he took his seat, and prepared once more to pursue the conver- sation. "Your father objected at first, I think you said, to your sister's choice." "Oh, entirely I he would not listen to it. The Navy, you know, does not like the Army, as a general thing. My father and Colonel Grafton get on very well together, but it's a perfect wonder to everybody, for if there is any- thing my father does hate, I think it's a soldier, or at any rate, a marine. As for this matter, he would not hear of it. 'The idea,' he said, ' of such a girl as Kate marrying a second lieutenant, and going perhaps to a distant frontier post! Put on an allowance for quarters-cut down to half a room, may-be, with only a carpet or a blanket hung up for a partition between her and her next neighbor! It was of no use talking about it.' I do not think it was quite wise in John Peter to ask my father's consent at the time he did; he might have known that, as a cadet, he would have less chance of succeeding than after getting his com- mission.  But you know he is always impulsive-what he has to do must be done on the spur of the moment; and as he had been attached to my sister for nearly two years, I suppose he felt as if he could bear the uncertainty no longer. Well, my father put him out of suspense at once, by telling him that it was a thing he would never hear of, and that  &#xD;<pb n="562-563" xml:id="VAC7016-00000282"/> 562       WALTER OGILBT. he should do all in his power to cure his daughter, who was a good, sensible girl, of such a foolish -fancy." "Poor Ellsworth I But your father gave his consent, you say, at last?" "Yes ; it was Ally's doings, after all. She was very fond of her cousin, and she knew that Kate was just the person suited to him, with her quietgood sense and thoughbt- fulness-besides, it was a very strong attachment on both sides. So, the day before Ally was to set off for her uncle's last spring, she had a long talk with my father. He thinks the world of Ally--many a time when we were children, she could persuade him into a thing that neither Kate nor I could. I remember that afternoon well. My father was sitting at the end of the back piazza, smoking his cigar, and she stood leaning on the railing, looking in his face, and smiling as she talked. I knew in a minute she would carry her point-he could not stand her coaxing. After awhile she came forwards to where Kate and I were waiting for her in one of the garden walks. 'Well, what does he say?V said I, for Kate could not speak a word. 'He says somlethiug must be done, he supposes, to stop my teasing-that he will think the matter over, and if he concludes to change his mind, Kate shall write and let nme know.' We all felt sure now that he would yield in time, and we made up our minds to be patient. Soon after that he was ordered to Norfolk to sit on a Naval Court-martial. The weather was very hot, although it was early in the season, and he had heard that it was'beginning to be sickly there. I could see that my father felt very serious about going. You know how it is with sailors-they fear no dan- ger nor exposure by sea, but when it comes to sickness on land, I tell you what, they are apt to be terrible cowards. I know that the old gentleman actually made his will, which looked as if he thought it was a pretty solemn time.   WALTER OGILBY.         563 The evening before he set off he took Kate aside and said,- 'Well, I've thought over this matter, as I promised, and you may write to Ally and tell her that if that young fel- low comes off with flying colors at his examination, and with a good reputation for soberness and stability, I shall send and invite him to spend part of his furlough with her father at'Ashfield.' Then he laughed at his own joke, and we knew that was enough. We had no fears for the rest, for Ellsworth's standing, both in studies and deportment, we knew to be among the first." "Then your sister wrote all this to Miss Morton, at Milbank?" "Yes; Ally has told us all about it, since her return- indeed John Peter had told us most of the circumstances. I say us, because what concerns Kate is of as much import- ance to me as to her, almost. "It seems there was a large party made up to go to West Point-you heard of it, I dare say. Ally received Kate's letter the day before this party, just as Mr. Ellsworth was sending off a note to John Peter to say that they would all be there at a  certain hour, and that he and some of his friends must meet them at the dock. So, before her uncle sealed his note, she just scribbled the words, ' Good news from Ashfield' on the edge of the leaf; and in that way John Peter was a  little prepared, though of course he did not suspect all that the letter contained. He was happy enough, as you may imagine, when he heard the whole, for he looked upon the thing then as settled." "Did Lieutenant Ellsworth's family know any of these circumstances?", "]is sister knew of his attachment to Kate: she was at Ashfield with him when the engagement-conditional, you understand-was first formed. My father was away at sea at that time. When he returned he discountenanced  &#xD;<pb n="564-565" xml:id="VAC7016-00000283"/> 564       WALTER OGILBY. it-John Peter was, of course, very unhappy, and I cannot suppose his sister to have been ignorant of such a thing as that-if she cares for her brother, that is, as Kate cares for me. And if she knew that he was in love with Kate, she must have known that he would persevere till he got her, if it took him ten years." "From several little things that I have heard his mother say, I infer that she did not understand the position of affairs. She seemed persuaded of a decided attachment between her son and his cousin, Miss Morton." "Yes, I am told that she took up that idea at the outset, and therewas no driving it out of her brain ever after, though she was told the contrary by her' niece. I have heard Mrs. Grafton laughing at Ally about the seriousness with which her aunt communicated to her that day at West Point, the fact that her son and niece were to be married some day; and the pains that Ally took to undeceive her in the course of the evening." "It is surprising that Ellsworth should not have confided to his mother how matters stood." "Why, you know the whole affair was in such an uncer- tain state. I doubt whether, even after Ally had showed him my sister's letter, he felt quite confident, for he knew that my father-well, my father has his peculiarities, as most men of his age are apt to have. Ellsworth could not know whether he might not change his mind when it came to the point. And then, although John Peter would not say such a thing to me, of course, yet I have heard that his mother required a great many people to help her keep a secret. It would not have been pleasant to either him or my sister to have the matter talked about; for it cannot be denied that my father had placed him in rather an unpleasant position. A young man does not like being put upon probation, and a girl, if she has any spirit, likes   WALTER OGILBY.        565 it as little for her lover. Ellsworth bore it for my sister's sake, but I can easily imagine he did not care to have it made a topic of conversation. He consulted his father, who took great interest in his success, and wrote in the most handsome and liberal manner. My father was ex- tremely well pleased with the letter-and yet, he still pre- served a little of his old, suspicious feeling about the Army, the temptations of a garrison life, and what not--and after all, would not give his full consent that it should be called an engagement until a twelve months' trial had shown what course Ellsworth was likely to take. I believe, after all, this was merely to save his own reputation for consistency, for he speaks of him now as one of our own family-indeed, I am convinced that he approves of him, and likes him exceedingly." "When do you go to Ashfield?" asked Mr. Ogilby, somewhat abruptly. "I am in hopes to be off by to-morrow noon. I have no very important cases to suffer by my absence," said the young man, laughing. "Having only hung up my shingle a few weeks since, I am not yet in so great request that I must delay my departure for the sake of my clients. Be- sides, my sister writes me that my father has a little law business for me to attend to, and that, as there will be some riding about, as well as some writing to do in the matter, I had better, she says, come up a day or two earlier than I had at first proposed. I have a few commis- sions to execute, and my Christmas presents to purchase, all which I can hurry round and get through with in the course of the forenoon." "Will you think me very capricious if I change my mind and decide to go with you?" "My dear fellow, you delight mel How pleased my sister will be! and Ally too, I have not a doubt. By-the- 48  &#xD;<pb n="566-567" xml:id="VAC7016-00000284"/> 566       WALTER OGILBY. by, are not you the friend who picked her up and took her home that time that she fell down the bank? I was sure Mr. Morton told us so; then of course she will be most happy to see you. Ally is not one to forget an old friend, I assure you. Shall I ask your friend Carey to accom- pany us? We will take the stage at noon, and we shall be at our house in time for an early tea." "I fancy Carey has made his arrangements for Christ- mas," said Mr. Ogilby, with whose views it by no means accorded to add another to the party. "Well, the affair is all settled then. Shall we meet at the stage-house, or shall I tell the man to drive round and pick you up?" i Thank you; I will leave my directions at the office to-night on my way to my lodgings." And thus the friends separated, Mr. Andrews express- ing a hope that the effects of the sea-coal fire would not continue to inconvenience his guest; and the latter pro- testing that he had never felt more comfortable than at the present moment. CHAPTER    L XVII. A HEAVY snow, which commenced falling on the suc- ceeding day, so much impeded the progress of their vehicle that the travellers did not reach Ashfield until long after the usual hour,-too late, Mr. Ogilby found, to hope to see any one beyond the domestic circle of his friend for that night. There was such a lighting up of the countenance, and such a cordial smile of welcome on the lips of Miss An- drews, when his name was mentioned, as convinced him   WALTER OGILBI         567 that he was not entirely unknown to her. This, together with the fact that she and not her friend was the person engaged to be married to Lieutenant Ellsworth, made her appear very amiable in the eyes of their visitor. The Captain, a bluff, weather-beaten sailor, was hearty in his greeting, and somewhat boisterous in calling for everything he deemed necessary for the comfort of the travellers, after their cold ride. Supper was soon smoking upon the board, but it must not be partaken of until due respect had been paid to a bowl of lime punch brewed by the Captain's own hands out of genuine Jamaica, and fresh fruit "Just sent," as he called out from the depths of the closet to inform them, "as a present from that prime old rascal, Paul Stridiron, of St. Barts." Aside from the slight coarseness, which was no uncom- mon feature in the profession at that day, there was much in the honest veteran to like and esteem; and Mr. Ogilby soon found himself at home in the cheerful, happy circle. Twenty-four hours since, how little had he dreamed of sitting by this bright, blazing fireside, listening to the in- terchange of kindly thought and feeling, and to the flow of conversation, rendered doubly delightful by the name he most loved to hear forming the constantly recurring topic I "When have you seen Ally?" was at length a question from Mr. James to his sister. "This afternoon. I was up at the parsonage." "How is she?" "She says she is very well, but I am afraid she is sitting rather too closely at work on the Christmas presents she is preparing."  "Yes," interposed the Captain, rather pettishy, "and  by way of variety, paddling about among a parcel of wet, ip  &#xD;<pb n="568-569" xml:id="VAC7016-00000285"/> 568       WALTER OGILBY. frosty evergreens, to help dress up the church like the Feast of Tabernacles." "Oh, no, papa, you are quite mistaken, I assure you," said his daughter. "There was a unanimous vote taken by the young people that Ally should be permitted to do nothing but head-work this year. So she merely gives the orders, and we execute them." "Is your friend really indisposed?" asked Mr. Ogilby, in a low tone, of which Kate could not mistake the anx- ious expression. "She is certainly not in as good health as formerly, and as her mother died of consumption--"Miss Andrews stopped short, shocked at her own want of thought. "I mean," said she, "that as Ally is very dear to us all, we are naturally solicitous about her, and anxious to bring back her roses again." Died of consumption! Mr. Ogilby's heart sunk within him at the terrible meaning those words might convey. Kate was not surprised, on the following morning, to be met, immediately after breakfast, with the inquiry from their guest,- "What are your customs here? At how early an hour may I b eermitted to call on my old friend, Mr. Morton?" "We have no formalities," was her reply. "A clergy- man, you know, is always at the disposal either of his own flock, or of the strangers within their gates." "If you will wait fifteen minutes or so, I will accom- pany you, and show you the way to the parsonage," said James, obligingly. "But you know, James, papa wished you to lose no time in looking over those papers," interposed his sister. "I can give Mr. Ogilby such directions as will enable him to find the house without trouble." Mr. Ogilby was more and more inclined to concur with   WALTER OGILBIY        569 the brother, that his sister Kate possessed a deal of "calm good sense."' "I am going to the church presently, to help in tying greens," continued she to her brother. "'When you have finished your business you can call there for me, and we will walk together to the parsonage." "And what will our friend here be doing with himself for the two or three hours he may have to wait?" "If he finds the time hang heavy on his hands," said Kate, quietly, " he can inquire his way to the church, and join us there!" Mr. Ogilby set out on his walk. How many thoughts came chasing each other through his brain-through his heart I Hopes and fears in mingled confusion! How would Ally receive him? What effect might his unaccountable coldness and desertion have had upon an affection which he now felt certain of having once possessed? Had long months of separation enabled her to overcome feelings which pride and self-respect forbade her longer to cherish? What was he to say in his own exculpation? Could he tell her that her cousin had borne false witness? That she had said that to him which she knew would seal his lips if not forever, at least until a time when to speak would be unavailing? And if he should find Ally changed in health-alarm- ingly so In the midst of these troubled thoughts his rapid step brought him to the door of the modest parson- age. "Is Mr. Morton at home?" was his first inquiry of the neat little handmaid who answered his energetic knock. "No, sir, he has just gone to the church." 48*  &#xD;<pb n="570-571" xml:id="VAC7016-00000286"/> 570       WALTER OGILBY. "Will you ask if Miss Morton can see a gentleman--an old friend?"He would not send in his name, lest it might bring a refusal. The girl threw open the door which led into a parlor, and with no farther announcement than, "Walk in, sir," ushered him into Ally's presence. She was standing before the fire. As she turned her head at the sound of the closing door, one glance of those soft eyes put to flight all his premeditated explanations and apologies-she was in his arms, her heart beating against his-he thought of but one question, one entreaty,- "Are you not raine? Say that nothing but death shall part us again!" And the few whispered words, "Never with my con- sent," were all that his full heart required. But their silent happiness could not last forever. Thev had so much to tell, so much to explain; how they had been deceived; how they had suffered. ' With all this the reader is already acquainted,; therefore it need not be repeated. They had taken no note of the flight of time, when at length interruption came, in the shape of a bright, young face peeping through the softly opened door. "This, I suppose, is one of the little sisters," said Mr. Ogilby, beckoning to her. "Come to me, and let us get acquainted." But the door was again closed, and the vision disappeared. The report carried up-stairs, with the least Possible delay, to Aunt Clara, was of a nature to startle that gentle, discreet, old lady. "A strange gentleman was sitting on the sofa beside sister Ally, with his arm around her waist I They had both been crying, for their eyes were red, but they looked very happy now-as happy as could be!"   WALT'tKR OGILBI:       .5 "A strange gentleman!"Aunt Clara had made sure it was only James Andrews, who, she knew, was expected from New Haven, and who always came as early as pos- sible to call on the family. "Who could it be? It was very strange Ally had not sent up at once to invite her aunt to come down! But as for his sitting so close to Ally, what a nonsensical mis- take I Ally was the last person in the world to permit such a liberty! And it was very unlady-like and im- proper in Lizzie to be imagining such a thing!" Miss Andrews was, in due time, joined by her brother at the church. She had been greatly pleased to find Mr. Morton already there, and she had purposely kept a little out of his way, that no chance question might make it necessary to inform him of the arrival of their visitor. She could not understand how her brother, upon this occasion, contrived to despatch his' business so soon; much sooner, it seemed to her, than he had ever done before, in order to be again with her. "Have you informed Mr. Morton that Mr. Ogilby is here?" was his first question. "No; there is no hurry." "Why, surely he will think your delay very. strange! An old acquaintance of his I I shall go and tell him at once that Mr. Ogilby is at his house." "I doubt if Mr. Ogilby will thank you for your officious- ness," said Kate, with a smile. "What?" said her brother, opening his eyes. "Why I you don't say so? You don't think that is what -he has come for? Well, it never struck me before, but I believe you must be right." Seeing the good clergyman at length preparing to depart, they gave him the information, and, at his request, accom- panied him to his home. Mr. Morton expressed the most lively satisfaction at again meeting Mr. Ogilby. ,   &#xD;<pb n="572-573" xml:id="VAC7016-00000287"/> 572       WALTER OGILBY. "Indeed, it gives me great pleasure, my dear sir, to welcome you here," said he, with earnestness, "and my daughter too, I am sure-Ally! why, my dear, the sight of an old friend is a great beautifier. We have long lamented that you seemed to have left your roses at Milbank-I be- lieve Mr. Ogilby must have picked them up and brought them back in his pocket." And her father looked, at her glowing countenance with tender satisfaction, Aunt Clara and the sisters now made their appearance, in obedience to a summons, and were duly presented. The aunt looked somewhat scrutinizingly at the handsome young stranger, to judge if there was probably any foun- dation for the report brought by Lizzie, but his quiet man- ner entirely convinced her that the child's eyes must have deceived her. Soon the visitors, resisting all invitations to remain to dinner, rose to take their leave. They had made their adieux, and James and his sister had passed out the front door, when Mr. Ogilby stepped back for a moment into the hall. "Will you give me leave," said he, in a low tone, to Mr. Morton, "to call again upon you this afternoon?" "Certainly,-certainly, sir, with the greatest pleasure. I shall be at home until four o'clock," was the courteous answer. "Poor man I He little imagines what I am meditating against his peace," said Mr. Ogilby to himself. A feeling akin to sadness came over his heart, as he thought of the great sacrifice he was about to ask of the tender parent. To give to him, a stranger, the daughter so beloved--the light of his home! Yet such is God's appointment! Those whom he has joined in heart and spirit must become one in life, even to the severing of ties which bind to home, to kindred, and all else hitherto most dear!   WALTER OGILBY.         573 Mr. Morton went into his little library and sat down with his book. Ally brought her work-basket and seated herself on a stool beside him. Now, that a separation from him at some future time had been talked of, she could not bear to lose a moment of his society. But she was too nervous and fluttered to be quiet. She tried to baste on the pattern for the collar she was working, but, expert as her fingers ordinarily were, the figures now went awry, and would not join symmetrically. She put aside her embroid- ery, and set herself to cut out some night-caps for Aunt Clara; these, too, she relinquished, on finding that she had cut for the left side all the pieces which should have com- posed the two. She could think of nothing better than to draw near her father and lay her head on his knee. He at once put aside his book to talk to her. "I hope that young gentleman is in no trouble," said be. "He seemed to have something on his mind-some- thing I imagine about which he wishes to ask my advice, for he requested to speak with me this afternoon. He seems an uncommonly fine young man-quite superior to what one often sees. How kind and polite he was to us last spring I We must ask him here to dine, my daughter. I had no idea he was an intimate friend of James Andrews. It is a little strange that James never mentioned it when we have been speaking of him!" Ally now began to think she was wanted in some other department. Her father's remarks and questions might lead to a premature disclosure of that which she had no heart to tell him of, the secret which she had left to Mr. Ogilby to impart. She did not see the latter again until sent for by her father into the library, where the two had been together for a long-it seemed to her a fearfully long-time. Perhaps her father might object To give her up might  &#xD;<pb n="574-575" xml:id="VAC7016-00000288"/> 574       WALTER OGILBY. be more than he could resolve upon I He might plead his age, his infirmities, his dependence upon her care and ten- derness; and Mr. Ogilby, with his exalted ideas of duty, might believe it right to resign his pretensions She trembled as she opened the door. Her father was seated in his old-fashioned arm-chair be- side the fire, and Mr. Ogilby was standing near him. The countenance of the latter was very grave, but it lighted up as she entered. He came to meet her, and taking her hand, led her forward, and in silence both knelt before her father to receive the blessing which, as he placed his hands upon their heads, he in tones of the deepest feeling pronounced upon them. "God Almighty bless you, my dear children I Live in love, and the God of love and peace will be with you, and bless you 1" It was some time before either of the party recovered their serenity sufficiently to join Aunt Clara and the other members of the family, who learned, with a surprise not inferior to 'Mr. Morton's, of the long attachment between the young people, and the relationship in which Mr. Ogilby hoped one day to stand to them. Kind, gentle, Aunt Clara now found a solution of that which to Lizzie had seemed so mysterious. As for Anna, the older of the two, she was, as young sisters are apt to be, highly delighted with the aspect of affairs, and took an early opportunity of whispering in her sister's ear,- "Oh, Ally! is not he grand? Is not he splendid? If /   I were not a little bit afraid of him, I should be in love with him myself-"l i;:   But when, after a time, Mr. Ogilby had made greater i'   advances in acquaintanceship, when he had talked to her in his pleasant, affectionate manner, and led her to under-   WALTER OGILBY.        575 stand bow she could, in future, supply her sister's place to her father and to all others depending upon her, as the eldest daughter of the house, her feeling of awe vanished, and her prominent thought was, "I shall love him as a dear brother-as we should all have loved our darling Wilhe had he been spared!" CHAPTER    LXVIII. KATE ANDREWS had written a note to her friend inviting her to return with Mr. Ogilby, and take tea with her; 'but this was felt to be impossible. They must have this even- ing in quiet to themselves. The half of what they had to say had not yet been gone over. Only the most prom- inent points had been touched upon, and there were yet re- maining a thousand details which each was longing to hear or to tell. According to the good old New England custom, the other members of the family retired soon after evening, prayers, leaving the young couple to an hour's exclusive enjoyment of each other's society. Ally was anxious to learn how Mr. Ogilby had explained to her father the misunderstanding which had so long kept back the avowal of his affection. "I trust you did not mention Gertrude's part in the matter," said she. "It would distress papa beyond measure to know that she had been capable of such a wrong." "It was not necessary for me to say more than that I had been assured by one whom I thought good authority, that you were to be married to your cousin; and that I  &#xD;<pb n="576-577" xml:id="VAC7016-00000289"/> 576       WALTER OGILBY. had only been undeceived two days since by our friend, James Andrews." "Did papa inquire," said Ally, blushing, yet smiling "how I came to have a heart so ready to bestow upon you at your first invitation?" "We did not dwell upon that point. The far more im- portant one, that of giving you to me, now that I had se- cured your consent, was what I had to reconcile him to." "Poor papa! He will miss me sadly. But Anna must learn to take my place. I am afraid his winter will not be a cheerful one-he will be constantly saying to himself ' Next year she will be away X?' "We will talk of that to-morrow," said Mr. Ogilby. "Just now my business is professional. I must see if this little finger-nail has grown out straight and fair. This finger-nail," said he, with an air of mock solemnity, "that was the cause, the innocent cause of so much mischief,-that so nearly occasioned the shipwreck of all our happiness!" "How was that?" asked Ally, in surprise. "Do you not remember that it was the accident to this finger that cut me short in what I was about to say to you the day we were together at the Rapids? Is it possible that you did not divine what was then passing in my heart, and that I was longing to tell you of it? Of course, when you were suffering I strove to put aside my own feelings, and not to disturb you with any expression of them; for, although I did not think you quite indifferent to me, I was doubtful how you might receive the avowal I was medita- ting. Ally, why were you always so backward, so far from encouraging in your manner towards me? Did you really not understand me?" At that timne I began to," said Ally, blushing. "But I think I was brought up with overstrained ideas of what was proper and becoming under such circumstances. In i                      , ,          W WALTER OGILBY        5" all the works upon Female Education that had been put into my hands, and more especially in your Scottish author, DI)r Gregory, I found maxims laid down which gave me the impression that it was wrong, unmaidenly, to allow your sex to suspect the preference which ours might feel. I dreaded that you might see an impropriety--that you might think me wanting in reserve --," She hesitated. '"In short," said Mr. Ogilby, smiling, "that I might feel disappointed at finding that which I was so earnestly seeking!" "I must own," said Ally, " that I was sometimes puz- zled to imagine how people were ever to come to an un- derstanding.  But there was yet another reason why I was always as guarded as possible: Gertrude's comments were such as to mortify me. She seemed persuaded that I was endeavoring to attract you, and that you were aware of my design. ' "I suspected some such reason for your diffidence, and I should have put the matter beyond a doubt by writing to you as soon as I found that I was summoned to New York, and could not see you for several days; but then again this little finger interfered: it would not have per- mitted you to reply. There was therefore no alternative but to wait until I would have you all to myself, as I hoped and expected to do on the day when we were to be to- gether at West Point." "And was it this poor finger that closed your heart against the explanation that its owner was so anxious to give you on that day?" said Ally, a little mischievously. "Oh, my Ally! do not allude to that time. When I remember how I  turned from you, and refused to listen to your sweet, pleading words, I feel that I hardly deserve to be forgiven; that I  can never forgive myself. No-let me lay the blame where it belongs: on my own weakness "  &#xD;<pb n="578-579" xml:id="VAC7016-00000290"/> 578       WALTER OGILBY. and oversensitiveness. I had no right to doubt you. I ought to have believed that what your looks had spoken might be relied on, even as if your lips had uttered it. I was inexcusable for admitting for an instant the idea that you would have accepted my attentions, such as they were, when your word was plighted to another. And yet-to doubt a story so unhesitatingly, so unblushingly told I One, too, that might so easily have been detected I Gertrude's very audacity ensured her success." "She must have had some very powerful motive for wishing to separate us. But we will not speculate upon the subject," said Ally. "We will rather adopt your ex- cellent Scottish proverb, Let by-ganes be by-ganes." "That is certainly the best and most Christian philoso- phy," said Mr. Ogilby. "And now, I must tear myself away, for there is another person to whom I still, in some sort, belong, and I cannot sleep until I have imparted to her all my happiness. Oh, Ally I dearest, you little know the joy that the letter I am to write to-night will carry to my mother's heart!" "You must charge her to find room in that heart for me-a warm, cosy place, for I am very exacting. A little love will not content me." As he rose to take his leave, she said,- "Has it occurred to you that Kate and the others are perhaps at this moment waiting tea for us?" "No," replied he, laughing; "but I have occasionally had a suspicion that James might be wondering whether I really came to Ashfield to visit himn." 'The brother and sister were sitting up, awaiting Mr. Ogilbyfs return. He apologized for his long absence, but without offering] any explanation; and they were too polite to appear to find anything unusual in the circumstance of their guest's I'                      J   WWALTER OGILBY,        579 having spent most of the day, and all of the evening, at the rectory. Miss Kate took the liberty, however, of remarking to her brother, after his friend had taken his candle and gone up-stairs,- "Mr. Ogilby appears to have implicit faith in Solomon's recommendation, 'Whatsoever thy hand findeth to do, do it with thy might.'"  Ally had no reserves with her friend, who, in obedi- ence to her summons, was with her early on the follow- ing morning. She told her all her happiness, and re- lated as much of the causes which had led to the past estrangement as she could, without compromising the chief author of the trouble. For John Peter's sake, she forbore to be quite explicit upon this point. Her friend's congratulations were warm and sincere. "You cannot but be happy, dear Ally," said she. "A man who acts thus conscientiously, in a matter where the whole happiness of his life is at stake, may be trusted in all its relations. Many men, I fear I ought to say nost men, in Mr. Ogilby's place, would have argued somewhat in this manner: 'I doubt not I can win her by my atten- tions.' All things are fair in love, and each must run his own chance.' With these and a thousand other dishonorable excuses, they would have sought to carry their point. There are few who appreciate properly the great wrong of supplanting another in the affections of a beloved ob- ject. Those few deserve and will receive their reward." Later in the day, Ally was sitting quietly with Mr. Ogilby in her father's little library. The frequent visits of the good pastor to inspect the progress of the decora- tion of the church, left this apartment vacant at intervals, and the young people were not backward in taking pos- session of it at such moments. Mr. Ogilby was revolving  &#xD;<pb n="580-581" xml:id="VAC7016-00000291"/> 580       WALTER OGILBY. a scheme in his mind, and pondering how he should im- part it to Alice. "How happy my mother will be to welcome us!" began he, at length. "When must you return to Ferndale?" she asked. "I shall go, if possible, next week." "So soon I What is there to hurry you? And what will become of your course of Lectures?" "The Lectures are but a secondary consideration. In fact, the recollection that New Haven was within half a day's ride of Ashfield was, I believe, the strongest induce- ment I had tc commence attending them." "And yet, you are in such haste to get away from Ash- field 1"The tears rose to Ally's eyes, but she tried to keep them back, the more resolutely, that there was a scarcely perceptible smile on Mr. Ogilby's lips. "Yes," said he, "I will own that I am a little impa- tient." "Which route shall you take?" "I think the shortest one across the country, if there is sufficient snow. I propose getting a sleigh and horses in New Haven, that is, if things of that kind cannot be pro- cured here. Then, with plenty of wolf-skins and buffalo robes, I think the journey may be made in tolerable com- fort." Ally could not repress an exclamation of surprise. "I thought you were so hardy," she said, "that you did not care for such things!" "Not when I travel alone-but there is one going with me whose safety and comfort must henceforward be my first care." "Oh, no! that cannot be I How could poor papa bear it? He would never listen to such a thing!" "It is only a choice between your going with me now,   WALTER OGILBY.        51 or my remaining here with you, until such time next year as you may appoint. Do you suppose I have forgotten your promise that nothing but death should, with your consent, part us again? Besides, are you willing to run any more risks? Have we not suffered enough already?" "Ah!" said she, shaking her head at him, "I see you are just such a Scotsman as I once beard described. When you have a favorite plan you 'hang on to it like grim death /" "Do not think me obstinate, or unreasonable. I am aware that it rests with the lady to appoint the day--but yet, there are some circumstances in our case which should be well considered. I do not hesitate to express my con- viction that the same spirit which separated us-which en- tailed on us so many months of misery, will, unless we make it impossible, again be at work with the same purpose." "But you could not be again made to distrust me. ' "Certainly not; but with such a spirit there would never be wanting methods of working mischief. Remem- ber your aunt's favorite proverb, 'Where there's a will there's a way ;' and from the first, Gertrude has had a will to interfere with our happiness." "From the first? What makes you think so?" "Do you remember the day I brought you the little book of Scottish ballads? On the morning of that day I was at Briar Lodge to play chess with Mr. Benthuysen. Your cousin called there with Gerardus while we were occupied with our game, and nothing would satisfy Teunis but that she and I should make a trial of our skill. Your name, just at that moment, happened to be mentioned by one of the company, and she glanced at me with a most singular expression,-one which did not leave her coun- tenance until after she had taken her seat opposite me. It was of defiance, perhaps, more than of dislike,-as if "*  &#xD;<pb n="582-583" xml:id="VAC7016-00000292"/> 582       WALTER OGILBY. in a spirit of determination she had said,' I will conquer you now, and henceforward.' This roused me. I think I never entered into anything more earnestly than into that contest. I attached a foolish degree of importance to it, for your idea seemed inexplicably mingled with the game. All my usual self-possession forsook me, and with it my skill, my powers of calculation. So intense was my excitement that, in the third trial, after. having been twice checkmated in the two first, I could distinctly hear the beating of my own heart. It was an- effort for me to speak as calmly as politeness required, when the encounter was at length over, and I had triumphed. See how weakly superstitious I can sometimes be!" "I call it neither weakness nor superstition," said Ally. "You saw that she was determined to gain an advantage over you, and you met her on her own ground. But I am a little superstitious myself, and I think I shall be more so now than ever; for although Gertrude has, as in the games of chess, been victorious for a time, you have checkmated her at last." "I shall not consider her checkmated until I present you to her in my own home. I shall, until that moment, continue to feel that she possesses a power, a malign in- fluence, if I may so say, over our happiness." "Oh, Walter, where is your faith? Are we not under the protection of a Power higher than all the powers of mischief?" "Yes, surely; but, having learned by bitter experience where the spirit of evil dwells, it is unquestionably the part of wisdom' to guard against its possible machinations. The conviction that all her arts are useless may at length disarm your cousin. The defeat of her plans, whatever they-may have been, may have the effect of leading her to reflection,-perhaps to repentance. Our very happi-   WALTER OGILBY.          583 ness may possibly be asalutary chastisement to her. Slie may learn from it that it is wiser to be truthful, and gen- tle, and disinterested like you, than to be brilliant, and coquettish, and selfish as she has hitherto been. Now I think, my Ally, I have made out my case. I entreat you to think seriously of all I have advanced. If you cannot at once accede to my plan, are you content to leave the decision to your father?" "Yes," said Ally, in a low tone, "you must know that it is on his account that I hesitate." "Well, then, to him we will appeal," and Mr. Ogilby dropped the subject. He occupied himself for a time in making a leisurely circuit of the apartment, examining the bookcases and their contents. He appeared to have at length made a selection that pleased him, for he opened the volume he had taken down, and for a -few minutes seemed absorbed in its pages. "Are you going to read to me?" asked Alice, as he again seated himself beside her. "Presently," he replied. "Is not that your father's step in the hall?" Mr. Morton was heard entering, then stopping to take off his overcoat, after which the door of the library opened, and he walked in. He stirred the fire and warmed himself, at the same time casting a benevolent, though, Ally thought, a rather sad glance at the two as they were seated near the window to enjoy the last beams of the afternoon sun. "What have you there?" asked he at length, observing the book which Mr. Ogilby still held with his finger be- tween the leaves. "An  old friend: one whom all must reverence as well as love--George Herbert."  &#xD;<pb n="584-585" xml:id="VAC7016-00000293"/> 584       WALTER OGILBY. "You say rightly, my dear sir. Well may we all ven- erate such a man, and bless God for his example and teachings!" responded the good pastor, fervently. "George Herbert was the first person who, in a most bigoted and fanatical age, raised his voice in favor of religious tolera- tion. He it was who dared to meet the persecuting spirit of the times with the maxim of his blessed Master-Peace on earth, good-will towards men 1 Honest Tzaak Walton, in his quaint language, has preserved a beautiful picture of his gentle and heavenly-minded friend." "It cannot be denied," said Mr. Ogilby, with an ex- pression which Ally could not quite interpret, "that his portraiture brings the man at once before us, not only with his holy meekness, but with his zeal and promptness, whenever an emergency required. And the latter quali- ties are not less commendable than the former. Do you not agree with me, sir, that George Herbert is a model whom, in this respect also, all may imitate? Nay, that his example is one which the older and wiser should press upon the young for their adoption?" "Certainly, certainly," exclaimed the worthy clergy- man, with an enthusiasm all the greater that, his own little place of worship being somewhat out of repair, "Layton Church" was prominent in his mind. "Among all the eminent men of later times, whose good deeds have been recorded, there is no one whose footsteps, it appears ,to me, could be so profitably followed. To any 'young friend seeking for a pattern of practice, the result and illustration of his faith, I should say, pointing to the course of George Herbert, 'Here is the way, walk ye in it i"p "I was proposing to read a part of his biography aloud to your daughter, just as you entered," said Mr. Ogilby. "If you please I will go on with it."   WALTER OGILBY.         58 "Ah! that is right, that is right. It will interest me no less than Ally," said her father. Mr. Ogilby, with great gravity, opened the book and read aloud the account given by the venerable Angler of the courtship (if courtship it could be called) between the Rev. George Herbert and Miss Jane Danvers. "Stay, stay," broke in Mr. Morton, before the history was quite completed; but Mr. Ogilby went resolutely on,- "Insomuch that she changed her name to that of Herbert the third day after their first interview. . This haste might in others be thought a love frenzy, but it was not "Here the reader paused. "I see what your aim is," said the good man, a little reproachfully. "You have entrapped me completely--I cannot deny it. You have arrived at your end, as old Burton would say, 'per ambages.' But please to remem- ber, my dear young gentleman, that the worthy divine you propose to yourself as a model did not take his lady-love away thus suddenly from  a tender, almost a dependent father." Ie looked around for Alice, but she had stolen awav to escape the discussion which she foresaw would be a painful one. It ended, however, as discussions between a powerful, earnest mind, and a gentle, yielding one never fail to do. Mr. Morton owned himself convinced by the arguments which Mr. Ogilby brought forward; though, to tell the truth, he would have been puzzled to remember what those arguments consisted in,-all that had been advanced to move him having been simply the representation of what the two had already suffered in their long separation, and -the wisdom of sparing Ally a second similar trial. To these considerations may possibly have been added, in the father's mind, the natural satisfaction of securing to  &#xD;<pb n="586-587" xml:id="VAC7016-00000294"/> 586       WALTER OGILBY. a beloved daughter the protection of a man of worth and honor,-one, too, who possessed a fortune so ample as to offer a reasonable security against the privations and hard- ships to which a single life might have condemned her. Ally was alone in the little parlor when Mr. Ogilby again joined her. She was leaning against the mantel- piece, gazing down into the fire, which only half lighted up the apartment. She did not look up as he approached, nor even when he laid his hand gently on her head. "My own Ally," said he, "if this is too hard for you; if you find the trial of leaving your home at present too great,-let us wait till summer. I did not mean to dis- tress you so," observing that the eyes she now raised to his were filled with tears. He wiped them away. "There, let us speak no more of it." And he tried to smile cheer- fully. "No," said Ally, "it is not that I am unwilling to go with you at once. It would be harder for me to stay; but how did papa take it? I see that he yielded-did he do it without too great a struggle?" "The trial was no greater to him, perhaps, than it would have been next summer, or at any future time. We could not expect that parting from you would ever have been a welcome task to him. But as it would have been a point of duty in you to pine and look very unhappy during every unavoidable absence of mine the coming winter, I think, upon the whole, I have secured your father's comfort by proposing to take you with me." Ally was by this time able to smile again. "And when do you threaten to take me away?" "We ought to go as early as possible. The roads are in a fine state now, but a thaw would make them very dis- agreeable; and heavy falls of snow,-such as we must ex- pect to have after a time, by blocking up the rough, hilly   WALTER OGILBY.        587 roads,---would render them almost impassable. I shall go to New Haven, early to-morrow morning, to make the necessary arrangements. I have already written to a friend," said he, smiling, "to engage me a sleigh and horses, and with them I can drive back in time for Miss Andrews' party in the evening. Will you trust me to ex- ecute any commissions for you?" "This seems a very hurried business," said Ally, laugh- ing. "A young lady to get married upon a week's notice I Poor Aunt Clara! How will she hold up her hands in horror at the idea of a bride without a trousseau." "She knows my Ally's value too well to imagine it would be enhanced by the most splendid outfit that Paris itself could furnish. Whatever temporary inconvenience my impatience may subject you to, will be easily remedied. You must not forget that Mary Carroll-Mrs. Byrne, I should say-will be at hand in your new home, with the nimblest of fingers, and, I dare say, a competent share of taste and skill to supply what you may consider deficien- cies. Make me out a little memorandum, if you please, of that which is desirable at present, for I have a lady friend in New Haven, whose taste is unquestionable. And now, there is another thing, the exact measure of this little finger." And as he spoke he drew off the ring she had so long worn there-the ring containing her father's and mother's hair, which had in former days occasioned him such dis- quietude. After fitting it on the end of his own, to judge of its size, he placed it on one of the fingers of her right hand. "Not even the memento of one so dear," he said, "must usurp the place of that little circlet which is to bind us together." Then, observing that this allusion to her mother again  &#xD;<pb n="588-589" xml:id="VAC7016-00000295"/> 588       WALTER OGILBY. brought a look of sadness to her face, he changed the con- versation, and chatted gaily upon indifferent subjects, until the other members of the family circle assembled to tea. CHAPTER    LXIX. MR. OGILBY was to set off at a very early hour on the following morning-the adieux, therefore, must be spoken before separating in the evening. Kate had been sum- moned; and a consultation with her and Aunt Clara had enabled Ally to prepare the list of commissions for the lady friend in New Haven to exbecute. They were few in number, comprising little beyond the hat and pelisse suit- able for the marriage ceremony, which was to be per- formed in church immediately before their departure for Ferndale. With her memorandum, when it was completed, Ally also brought her little purse. "I am glad to see you are so honest," said Mr. Ogilby, smiling, as he placed it again in her hand, and closed his own over it; " but as I have been under the necessity of borrowing to a considerable amount from your father since I came here, he and I will settle all our accounts together." Ally looked at him with a puzzled air. Nobody ever borrowed largely of her father! And Mr. Ogilby, who always had so much at his command! "There is some roguery in what you are telling me," said she, shaking her head, "but I cannot quite under- stand it. So take my purse, if you please, and see that   WALTER OGILBY.         589 you make a very profitable and economical use of its con- tents." obey. I think next week the case is to be reversed; you do well to make use of your prerogative while you may," said he, gaily; and soon he had taken leave of her for the next twenty-four hours. The merry evening party had been for some time  assem- bled at Captain Andrews' before Mr. Ogilby's return from NSew Haven. People, it will be remembered, did not keep late, faslionable hours in-those days. It was not until after he had changed his dress, and walked into the drawing-room, that Alice was aware of his arrival; and then he had to be seized upoi by his friend James and presented to many of the company before he reached her This little delay gave her time to recover Ver self-posses- sion; but there was a bloom upon her cheek, and a bril- liancy in her fall, hazel eye, which drew from him the al- most involuntary whisper, "How well you are looking this evening 1 No trace of the invalid." "Thanks, I suppose, to the physician who has lately taken me in charge," said she, archly. "What a  pity that Aunt Aulchy could not be here to admire you in the new blue dress over which she mourned so much! She would say that Mary Carroll had outdone herself." "What detained you so? - Are you not later than you intended?", asked Ally, interrupting him. "I expected you to praise the dispatch with which I had accomplished so much. I   think I have completed everything I  proposed. Your things will be here on Tuesday at the furthest. The stage-driver, who is a young man I  once had it in my power to befriend in New 50  &#xD;<pb n="590-591" xml:id="VAC7016-00000296"/> 590       WALTER OGILBY. Haven, takes charge of them for me, and undertakes to deliver them safe and sound." "And your horses-did your friend's selection please you?" "They are so much to my taste that I shall lose no time, after my return, in driving around to Aunty Kuypers' and showing her how much Connecticut can outstrip Dutchess County in its horses, as well as its oxen. I was but three hours in coming from New Haven to the door of the hotel across the way." "How could you accomplish it in so short a time? It is at least thirty miles!" "Aunt Aulchy would say, 'a spur in the head is worth two in the heel.' I wished to come, and-I came." "As you carry your point in all matters," said she, smiling. They were now joined by Miss Macartney. "I have been scolding my new friend here most un- mercifully," said she to Ally. "How has he displeased you?" she inquired. "By making a descent like a Hieland cateran, and carrying off the fairest of our flock. Have you no re- proaches of conscience for robbing us thus?" asked she, looking up at Mr. Ogilby half in jest, half in earnest. "I cannot say that I have any compunctious visitings thus far," was his reply. "Well," replied the little lady, with a friendly smile, "although I cried out upon you in no measured terms at first, I find my resentment fast vanishing away, now that I come to know you. You are taking our pearl and our darling, it is true, but I believe we must not only forgive you, but congratulate you both, and say as little of our own loss as possible." Very pleasant to Mr. Ogilby were these expressions of i   WALTER OGILBY.         591 affectionate interest in one so dear to him; and he made many a promise to his heart that she should never have oc- casion to look back with regret to the friends by whom she was so beloved and cherished. Christmas-day and the few following ones were passed in the social enjoyments incident to the season. Innumer- able were the offerings-pretty or useful, trifling or valu- able-that found their way to the parsonage as parting gifts to the pastor's daughter. Those who knew Ally's system- atic habits and simple tastes, understood that she could never be unprepared even for so sudden a journey-yet it could not be doubted, even by them, that the down hood to be worn over her chinchilli cap in travelling, and various other little articles of comfort or ornament, would be re- ceived and appreciated as tokens of regard from those she was leaving. At length came the day appointed for the wedding. All the world of Ashfield was assembled at the little church, to witness, and, in most cases, to comment on the ceremony, and on the circumstances attending it. "It's nice and warm here, considerin' it's so early," whispered one of the waiting company. "There hasn't been any banns published-that will cost the old gentleman a good round sum. Seventy dollars, I believe, is the fine." "His son-in-law that's going to be, ought to pay that, by good rights. They say he's as rich as Croetius," was the rejoinder. "So I should think, by all I've heard tell. I wonder if it's true that he's gone and settled ever so much property on her, beforehand, for fear his family would get it all away from her in case of his death. Miss Hayes told me of it, and said the papers was made out down to Squire Samp- sonls office." "Well, I guess that wasn't it, at all. What was said  &#xD;<pb n="592-593" xml:id="VAC7016-00000297"/> 592       WALTER OGILBY. about death was this: Parson Morton said he thought it was no more than fair that the young man should come down with something worth while; because, in the first place, he was taking away his daughter, that was a useful person, a housekeeper, and one that was a sort of main stay in the family; and then, in the next place, it certainly would not be very pleasant to have her coming back to be a burden on him, as she would be, in case she should be left a widow, with only her thirds. I think nobody could blame him-I should have looked out for number one, if I had been him. I asked Mirandy Stiles, who was up there a mantua-making for Ally, if that was the rights of the story, and she said she didn't know anything about it,-so, of course it's true, or she'd have contradicted it." "Well, I always thought Mr. Morton was, a good, easy kind of man, that didn't care a great deal about money mat- ters. Wasn't it queer that they should get married so all of a sudden?" "Yes; but I suppose you know how that was: the young man, it seems, was in a desperate hurry, and wanted to be married right off; but the old gentleman would not hear of it. S6 then Mr. Ogilby, who was bound to have his own way, went down to New Haven and bought the greatest sight of everything that was handsome and ex- pensive as presents for her-Mirandy Stiles- says some of the things is most delightsome-and of course, then, the father, seeing he was under such an obligation, concluded it wouldn't do to hold out any longer, so he gave consent." "I wonder who is going to be bridesmaid! Kate An- drews?" "  Oh of course. I suppose she feels mighty grand about it, too. She didn't ask my Mehitabel to her party' the other evening; but neither she nor I crave to go where we ain't asked, if Miss Kate Andrews did but know it."   WALTER OGILBY.        593 "Hush! there they come. Oh i doesn't she look lovely?" said a gentle voice on the other side of the last speaker. "Why I they said he was so handsome. I'm sure I don't think so," remarked Miranda Stiles' friend. "I wonder if he is always so pale I Seems to me I'd have kept on my overcoat this cold morning; but, I suppose he wants to show off his elegant form I I don't think her clothes are any such great things after all. My Cousin Nancy could make as pretty a hat as that. Not a feather in it I 'm sure they need not have sent all the way to New Haven for that! I wonder whether the veil is bobbinett, or real thread!" "I don't think her pelisse is much, either," chimed in the neighbor. "Nothing but French cloth, I guess. I sup- pose that is silk velvet that it's trimmed with, though I think Elias Meeks has got a piece of tabby in his store about a match for it in color, that looks every bit as well. It sets nice any way. I wonder how they made it fit " "Be still a minute, I want to hear if she speaks out plain." All sounds were for a moment hushed, save the voices of those engaged in the holy ceremony. The vows were ut- tered-the prayers offered up-the young couple knelt, and received the benediction, pronounced fervently by a rever- end and valued friend of Mr. Morton-and-Alice was the wife of Walter Ogilby. The sleigh in which their journey was to be made had brought them to the church, and it was now standing at the door to receive them. Those who had not seen it be- fore, were indulged with an opportunity of speculating upon all its appointments, as well as of admiring the silk cloak lined with furs which Mr. Ogilby carefully wrapped around his bride after she was seated. "Ie don't mean that she shall catch cold, at any rate," said the mother of Mehitabel. "I wonder if she is going 50*  &#xD;<pb n="594-595" xml:id="VAC7016-00000298"/> 594       WALTER OGILBY. to travel in her white hat and lavender-colored pelisse  Well, it isn't every parson's daughter that's so lucky as all this comes to!" She was interrupted by a soft voice addressing her in a low tone,--"Had not you better caution your sister, Mrs. Hayes, about reporting that story from my Uncle Sampson's office? I once heard him say that if one of his clerks should speak of business that was done there, or papers that had been drawn up, he should dismiss him at once." "Good gracious! you don't say so I Well, if I've lost sister Hayes' Tom his place, I guess the fat will be all in the fire. For pity's sake don't say a word about it, and I'll just run and stop Mrs. Shadwick's mouth, if anything can stop the talkingest woman in all Ashfield." It is not quite certain whether the inquisitive lady ever had the satisfaction of learning that the wedding hat and pelisse were exchanged after awhile for a travelling-dress quite suitable for the journey; but there is reason to be- lieve that in due time she ascertained from Miranda Stiles that a dress of the bride elect had been providently sent to New Haven, by which not only the pelisse, but certain other additions to her wardrobe, had been fitted according to the taste of Mr. Ogilby's " lady friend.: Kisses, congratulations, and the distribution of wedding- cake followed the return of the party to the parsonage. We'may even add that healths were drank; for the goodly fashion which had obtained since the days of A"Cana in Galilee," had not then been abrogated; all which over, Ally, amid good wishes and blessings, but with some natural tears, bade adieu to the home of her childhood, to seek a new one with him from whom she had once believed herself forever separated. A slight snow, which had fallen the day previous to their departure, rendered the sleighing uncommonly fine, so   WALTER OGILBY   -      595 that their journey was performed without accident or hindrance. It was early in the afternoon of the third day that, after descending a steep, winding, and somewhat diflicult road, Mr. Ogilby gave orders to the driver to slacken his pace. "Do you renlember this place, my Ally?" said he. Ally did not immediately recognize it. "Here, on this spot, seven months ago," whispered he, "I first heard your voice as it rang through the still sum- mer air. There, just in the opening yonder, you stood, making your little bridge 1" "I thought it was my toilet I was making when I first met your eye," said she. "I hardly remember. I saw but your sweet self-your efforts to save your father from trouble and exposure. Ally, that was a blessed day for me 1" "And on how slight an accident may hang the destiny of a whole life 1" said Alice, thoughtfully. "Had not Provi- dence so ordered it that we should meet at this precise spot, and under these very circumstances, we might never have known and loved each other." "I  cannot conceive any circumstances under which, knowing I should not have loved you at once and with all my heart. But our love is probably now the more as- sured-we know each other better, and appreciate each other more fully than we could have done in the same length-of time, with but the smooth, ordinary course of events to prove and try each to the other. Therefore we will not lament our trials, severe as they have been. They are bringing us a wholesome fruit." A  very short time now brought them in sight of the va- cant sign-posts that indicated the residence of Farmer Van Tine. The sound and circumstance with which the driver deemed it fitting to herald his approach, brought more than -- L   &#xD;<pb n="596-597" xml:id="VAC7016-00000299"/> 596       WALTER OGILBY.  one member of the family to the door of the dwelling to re- ceive the new-comers. Mrs. Van Tine at once recognized Mr. Ogilby as he lifted Ally, and, without suffering her to touch the ground, bore her through the open door into the warm, cosy parlor. "Whlv Walter--Mr. Ogilby 1 Who expected to see you here? And who have you got with you? One of your sisters?" as she hastened to assist him in disembarrassing his companion of the wrappings in which she was envel- oped. ' Why I mercy on us! Miss Morton I Who in the world would have thought it?" "Mrs. Ogilby, if you please," said the young gentleman, with an air of supreme satisfaction. "Now, you don't say I Is it really so? Well, I'm sure I wish you joy with all my heart-and you, too," looking affectionately at Ally, who now, smiling and smoothing back her curls, was standing by the bright, blazing fire. "You've no little to be thankful for, I can tell you. You'll be a happy woman if he can make you so." Alice could not but be amused with the quaint simpli- city of the good woman; but she was quite at a loss to understand the next remark, which, after glancing with a shrewd expression first at herself and then at Mr. Ogilby, she addressed to him. "Well-she kept to her bargain, after all, didn't she?" "Her bargain? What was that?" "Do you misremember the day I was down at your mother's, when your young lady was telling your mother how Freelove Powers talked she was coming down that way to pick up somebody? And don't you know she said you ought to do something to try and help her in the matter?12 "i I think I remember--and what then?" said Mr. Ogilby.   WALTER OGILBY.         597 with a mischievous smile, that showed that the conversa- tion was fresh in his memory. "You said you was a poor hand at match-making." "And she replied----" "That if you was afraid to try your hand, you must get her, and she'd help you. You said you would not forget that. " "I never did-and, as you say, she kept her promise. She must not blush, however; we both know that it was made in the innocence of her heart." "Where is Miss Freelove?" asked Ally, willing to change the conversation. "Oh I she left us all of a sudden," said the hostess. "A pedler that came along left a Missionary Herald, that had in it an account of the death of one of the missiona- ries' wives down in the Choctaw country, if I don't mis- remember. And after poor Freelove had read it over and over, she took it into her head that Providence had opened a door for her to do good, by going down there to comfort the poor, desolate missionaries, and to teach school." "And did she go?" "No; she went back to her own native town of Litch- field to get a recommend to the Domestic Board-not that she was going out as help, she said, but they were the ones to examine if she was fit. Well, when she got there, she found that a cousin of hers, who had gone off and en- listed for a soldier years before, had got his discharge as an invalid and come home. So, as he wanted somebody to nurse him and maintain him, Freelove rather concluded that Providence had shut that other door, and opened this one for her-so she stayed and married her Cousin Joram." "I hope it proves a happy match," said Ally, with an air of interest. "Well-I guess it will do middling well," replied Mrs.  &#xD;<pb n="598-599" xml:id="VAC7016-00000300"/> 598       WALTER OGILBY. Van Tine, laughing. "It's likely she may cuff his ears, or give him a going over with her tongue now and then; but she will keep all things tidy and comfortable about him, and there will be no lack of anything he may want -for Freelove is forehanded, and has got money in the bank, enough to keep them both to the end of their days." Farmer Van Tine, when he at length made his appear- ance, could only, to use his own homely phrase, " say ditto" to all his wife's warm-hearted congratulations. He was urgent in seconding her pressing invitation to the travellers to remain with them until the following morning--but this was not to be thought of. "If this young lady feels equal to the fatigue and cold of another two hours' drive," said Mr. Ogilby, "I think we must set off immediately after we have dispatched the nice dinner you are preparing for us. This is the last day of the year, and I suppose she will not like to deprive her mamma and sisters of the pleasure of wishing her a ' Happy New Year' in the morning." "Will they be expecting you?" asked Mrs. Van Tine. "I think so. I wrote to my mother from New Haven, last week. As letters go pretty direct from there to New York, and thence up the river, I am in hopes that by this time she knows all our plans, and will be ready to receive us." "But won't you let me give you another pair of horses? Yours must have had a pretty hard pull over the mount- ains," said his kind host. "No; we have come very leisurely. My horses are not at all the worse for their work-they will take us to Fern- dale iL good season. And remember--you are to bring Sauchie to make us a visit and see how I acquit myself in my new position. It is possible I may have to take a few lessons of one who is such a model as yourself.   IWALTER OGILBY.        599      ; This compliment pleased the good farmer, but he an- swered with a half sigh,- "Ah, Walter I your wife can't ever be to vou all that Sauchie has been to me. You've got larnin' enough to be your own head-man, without her help. You ought to thank God for the blessing" The waning light of the short December day soon ad- monished the travellers to take their leave, and again set forth on their journey. The lights were gleaming from the windows of Milbank as they passed. "How little they imagine who is sweeping by in such haste!" said Mr. Ogilby. "Has not your mother told her friends, our friends, do you suppose?"  "Not a syllable. I enjoined her not to give the slight- est hint upon the subject, except to Agnes and Jessie. I told you, my Ally, I would run no risks. Gertrude has not a suspicion of the truth. It will be my office to impart  i the news to her in my New Year's call to-morrow." "But the doctor I I do not see how your mother could keep it from him." "When she recollected the satisfaction the announce- ment was to afford me, -she would restrain her own impa- tience to make him a sharer in her happiness.

IT had been a matter quite past the comprehension of the notable housekeeper at Ferndale, why such an unusual style of preparation should be going on to welcome the return of the young master. She could understand that everything should be in the most scrupulous order in his apartment-that a tasteful neatness should preside over all its arrangements; for Mr. Walter was particular, and it was right that everybody else should be so, where he was concerned. But that the little room adjoining, which had hitherto been devoted to his books, boxes, cabinets, etc., should be first cleared of its contents, then recarpeted, curtained, and arranged, as she remarked to herself, " alto- gether in the oddest, fancifullest sort of way, for a young gentleman," was a point she could not explain to her own satisfaction. '"It is right enough, and reasonable enough," she ob- served, while conversing with herself upon the subiect, "that he should want to get rid of these great, long cases that are locked up so tight-I am sure, for my part, I shouldn't want to be sleeping with such things so near my chamber door. I suppose he thinks nobody's wise enough to guess what's in 'em. And some of these big books, too, I should say, might just as well be carried up-stairs, and out of the way I Well, I believe we've got everything in apple-pie order now, ma'am," to Mrs. Ogilby, as she made her appearance; " but mercy on us I Excuse me, ma'am, but wa'n't there bureaus and wardrobes enough already   WALTER OGILBY.         601 to hold Mr. Walter's clothes, not to speak of the big press by the side of the chimney? It don't seem hardly as if he could want these that we've been a putting here in this little cubby-hole. But, of course, it's just as you say, ma'am. " Mrs. Ogilby offered no explanation; and Mrs. Martin went on, to give the finishing touch according to the direc- tions she had received. It was late in the afternoon of the day on which Mr. Walter was expected that the housekeeper paid a final visit of inspection, to satisfy herself that all was as it should be-that not a particle of dust had fallen-that the wood was laid in order on the andirons, ready to be lighted at a moment's notice-that the little stove in the inner apartment had, thanks to a good fire earlier in the day, ceased to emit a smell of British Lustre. She opened the door of the little dressing-room. There, on a small table, stood a lady's work-box, and regularly laid in order beside it, a Bible and Prayer-book-new- quite different from those which had so long lain on the writing-desk in Mr. Walter's own apartment. She stood for a lmomlent transfixed, gazing as if some strange wild animal had met her view-then recovering herself,- "Why! what in the world I I declare if it didn't most knock me over!  But this must be some of Jessie's doings 1" (There was no need to prefix the lMss, seeing there was nobody by.) "One of her Christmas presents, like as not, and she's sit it in here to make out an assort- ment of queer things. I wonder she never shew it to me before!" (Mrs. Martin, when not excited, piqued herself upon the accuracy of her grammar.) "It's a most beauti- ful thing, anyhow I Gold feet I Who ever saw the like? It looks as if it was made in China. And here's a new dressing-case for Mr. Walter I I'm sure his other one was 51 i                      .  &#xD;<pb n="602-603" xml:id="VAC7016-00000302"/> 602       WALTER OGILBY. good enough, this many a year yet. If he took it away, he'll bring it back again-he's not the person to leave any- thing behind him. What he gives, he gives, and what he don't give away he takes care of. But to go to spending, money like this I Seems to me, though, this looks different, somehow, from his other one. I should like just to take one look at it!" For a second time the curiosity of the good woman got the better of her discretion. She raised the lid of the dressing-case to take a peep. "Why! there don't seem to be any shaving things I That's queer! And here-the very old I Hair-pins and scent-bottles! Well-if that don't beat me! I suppose I shall come across a pair of curling-tongs next. What is his mother thinking of? And then the idea of putting that great big looking-glass in here, and the best gilt toilet set! I'm sure, I never thought Mr. Walter would have caired for such earthly pomps and vanities, or that his ma would have upheld him in it. If I was to speak my mind, I should say it was rather a turning the house upside down without any need. There's things enough in his own room for any young man, and handsome enough, in all conscience, that's to a certainty!" At this point of her soliloquy Mrs. Martin became aware of a step in the outer apartment, and, sliding noiselessly away from the mysterious articles, she was ready to meet her mistress at the door with a demure countenance. "I think, Martin," said the latter, "you may have the fires lighted now. We must have everything warm and comfortable; they will probably be here by six o'clock, at the latest." "They? Then Mr. Walter is bringing company with him? That accounts---- " "Yes, he is bringing company."    WALTER OGILBY.        603 "Then sha'n't I have a fire lighted in one of the other bedrooms, too, ma'am?" "No, Martin, that will not be necessary," said her mis- tress. Then, seeing the astonishment that was painted on the face of the faithful creature, she thought it cruel to mys- tify her any longer. "What would you say, Martin, if it was a young lady for whom all these preparations were making?" "A young lady 1" repeated Martin, with a look of holy horror; for in her vocabulary young was synonymous with unmarried. "What if it were a wife that Mr. Walter is bringing home?" Mrs. Martin involuntarily seated herself on the chair nearest her. "Now, you don't tell me so 1" she exclaimed, with a look half comic, half rueful, as if uncertain whether she were expected to congratulate or condole. "What will you do, ma'am?" rising, as she recollected herself. "How shall you like it? I hope he has got a- wife -to suit him-to suit all around, I mean." "Yes, Martin, we could not be better pleased. You remember Miss Morton, Mrs. Ellsworth's niece, who vis- ited us two or three times last summer?" "Yes, indeed, I do remember her-a sweet and beautiful young person. But how happens it that he's married, ma'am? I thought there was some trouble. Not that I ever asked any questions, for I always make a point of minding my own business, but Mary Carroll once hinted as if she only wished things would go as happy with Mr. Walter as they did with Michael and her." "There was some trouble, as you say, Martin. I may tell you now, for I know you have felt grieved with the  &#xD;<pb n="604-605" xml:id="VAC7016-00000303"/> 604       WALTER OILB Y. rest of us, to see Mr. Walter so grave and out of spirits as he has been of late. He had been told that Miss Morton was engaged to be married to her cousin, Lieu- tenant Ellsworth, and it is only, since he left us that he learned to the contrary." "Why didn't he ask her if it was true, ma'am?" "( He could not well doubt the truth of it, from the way in which it was told him; and he thought it would be dishonorable and wrong, after having been thus informed of it, to speak to her upon the subject. He felt that it would be distressing her, without doing himself any good." "I should not like to be uncivil by differing from Mr. Walter, but if I had been in his place I should just have walked up and said,' If you don't happen to be under ob- ligations to any other person, I should like to keep your company,' and it would have been easy enough for her to have said whether she was-free or not. They talk about a young man's not liking to get the mitten-his not getting the girl is the only thing he ought to care for. And as for being so careful to save a young woman's feelings, I dare say it's all very well, but I guess most any of 'em could stand saying ' no' to one of her beaux, and not die of it. When everything is spoken out fair and clear, a body knows what they have to go upon." "I doubt not you are right, Martin," said her mistress. "However, as it has all ended well, and they are, we trust, married at last, we have only to be thankful that good has come out of evil, and to pray that they may enjoy a long life of happiness together. But I am telling you all this without Mr. Walter's permission. He wishes to be the bearer of his own good news to our circle of friends-so you will say nothing, if you please, to the rest of the family until the young people arrive." i   WALTER  OGILBY.       f,05 Mrs. Martin descended to superintend the other portions of her domestic department; and, as she walked about very silent and very dignified, it was easily divined by the juniors under her sway that she was possessed of some mighty subject of contemplation. "What on earth has somebody been after telling Mis- thress Martin?" whispered Jemmy McCabe to one of the younger maids. "There's a something wonderful shut up inside of her! See how tight she holds her lipsl By- and-by it'll all burst out, and as it's likely I'll be the one to catch the first stream, I'll make myself scarce just now." Pursuant to this resolution, Jemmy left the house just in time to hear and interpret Bran's bark, and to rush for- ward to open the gate for the admission of the sleigh con- taining the travellers. Jemmy was not a dull boy, but even had his penetra- tive faculties been less keen, there would have been no mistaking the accents of tenderness with which his master ushered forward the young stranger who accompanied him, to meet the family assembled at the hall door. By dint of great forwardness in bringing in baskets and parcels from the well-packed sleigh, he was in time to hear the "God bless you, my dear, dear daughter!" from Mrs. Ogilby, as she folded in her arms the bright and beautiful young lady, whose cloak and shawls the proud Jemmy was permitted to hold until she was quite disencumbered and ready to be installed in the warmest seat near the parlor fire. It was true, as Jemmy had predicted, that Mrs. Mar- tin's first moment of relief from her burdensome secret was accompanied by a summary order to him to take himself off to his duties elsewhere,-yet his mortification was speedily turned into triumph as he heard himself called back by Mr. Walter, and told to make his best bow 51*  &#xD;<pb n="606-607" xml:id="VAC7016-00000304"/> 606   .WALTER OGIL BY. to his young mistress; and when he received orders to go immediately after tea and notify Michael Byrne of the arrival of Mr. and Mrs Ogilby,- "Well, your cat is out of the bag now, Misthress Martin, but it didn't scratch as hard as you meant it should," said Jemmy, in a low tone of exultation, as he brushed past that worthy personage,-a piece of imperti- nence for which she mentally promised him a boxed ear at her earliest convenience. OCHAPTER    LXXI. THE warm greetings of "Happy New Year," "Many, many Happy New Years to you all," had been more than once repeated on the following morning, before the family sat down to their late breakfast. A detailed narration of all that had occurred during their separation bad kept them around the parlor fire until a late' hour on the preceding evening, forgetful of fatigue, or aught save the happiness of being once more reunited. When the cheerful morning meal was over, Mr. Ogilby said to Alice, "Would you like to write a note to your aunt? With your consent," he added, smiling, "I will leave you long enough to drive to Milbank and the doc- tor's. I must go and ask the congratulations of our friends, as well as wish them a Happy New Year." "Had I not better go with you? Aunty might think it strange that I didn't." !"She would think it more strange if we suffered you to  ,?   WALTER OGILBY.        607 go out this cold winter morning, after the journey you have come. Your mamma must keep you quietly here by the fire until I return. I shall not be absent long." He drew a table towards her, and placed a writing-ldesk upon it. Ally wrote her note while he prepared for his drive,-afterwards she stood at the window and watched him off. There had been, after the return of the Ogilbys from their summer trip, something more of a neilghborly inter- course with the family at Milbank than would, at one period, have been thought possible. The former had ac- companied their Scottish friends to New York, and re- mained there with them until the dav of their embarkation for their own country. Gertl ude, Who was still in the city, had succeeded in persuading her uncle and aunt to show some attention to the strangers. Having ascertained be- yond a doubt that she had nothing to fear from Mrs. Ruther- ford as a rival, she thought it politic to offer her, as Mr. Ogilby's friend, all the civilities in her power, and thus secure as much as possible of the society of that young gentleman and his family. After their return to their own homes this sort of inti- macy did not entirely cease, for, by going to Milbank, Mr. Ogilby could at least sometimes hear mentioned the name which he never ventured himself to pronounce. The doctor had, upon more than one occasion, met his young friend there, and it was with no very complacent feeling that he had observed the friendly footing upon which he and Gertrude appeared to stand. "Can it be," said he to himself, " that she will succeed in making him her dupe? He used to know her well enough-but now, she is trying to persuade him that she is in love with him, and there are few men that can with- stand that. Walter, I suppose," and here he drew a deep    &#xD;<pb n="608-609" xml:id="VAC7016-00000305"/> 608     .  WALTER OGILBY. sigh, " is no stronger than the rest of his sex. Yet one that has loved Ally! Well--I cannot understand it." Gertrude, for her part, grew more and more confident of ultimate success. Admitting that Mr. Ogilby's first object in the renewal of his visits to Milbank was to hear, incidentally, Ally's name spoken, to learn of her health, of aught concerning her welfare; still she persuaded helr- self that the absence of any intelligence that could justify hope, that could leave him even the consolation of uncer- tainty, would in time obliterate all traces of his early affec- tion. She believed he would gradually and unconsciously turn to her for comfort and happiness. His departure for New Haven had been an unlooked-for disappointment. She knew not how to interpret it. Was it that his mother, dreading the effect of the growing intimacy, had urged him to this step in hopes of chectking it? Then the case was more promising than she lhad dared to hope. Walter might yield to his mother an outward obedience for a time, but his resolute character was not one to give up an attach- ment, even for her sake. A call which she had recently made at Ferndale con- firmed the hopes which were now almost certainty. To her inquiry, "How long will Mr. Ogilby be absent?" his mother had been compelled by truth to reply,- "But a short time longer, I think.'? "Have you heard from him lately?"l "Yes-we had letters yesterday." The brevity of the answers, and Mrs. Ogilby's evident desire to change the subject, gave Gertrude reason to infer that there was something connected with the young gen- tleman's return that was not altogether satisfactory to his mother, and this she interpreted in the way most gratifying to her own feelings.         - When, therefore, in glancing from the parlor window at   WALTER OGILBY.        609 an early hour on New Year's Day, the first object that met her view was Mr. Ogilby tying Gray Bird to the post in front of the gate, her heart beat less with surprise than with triumph and delight. He could only have arrived, she knew, the previous evening, for the doctor had called on his way from Ferndale the afternoon before, and had given her all the news he had been able to collect-namely, that his young friend would be at home before long. Now, at the earliest moment possible, after an absence of but one month instead of two as he had intended, he was coming to greet her. It cost her a powerful effort to con- trol her feelings that she might not meet him with a face too radiant and happy. What a piece of supreme good fortune was it, that her mother's appearance to join in welcoming their visitor was utterly impossible I How Gertrude blessed the great family dinner-party, the pre- paration for which was, just at this moment, giving the anxious housekeeper full occupation in regions which no minor considerations could have tempted her to desert! She had abundant opportunity, while watching Mr. Ogilby's approach to the house, to notice the change that had come over him. She saw that his step was bounding, his color heightened, his eye beaming. She was fully prepared for the animation of his greeting, as he paid her the compliments of the season, and inquired with earnest interest after her parents and the other members of the family. She was not surprised that when these were over, he remained silent for a moment, apparently debating with himself how he should proceed with what he had further to say. She felt that she could interpret this hesitation- yet it was not best that he should suspect! her of doing so. She was therefore the first to speak.  &#xD;<pb n="610-611" xml:id="VAC7016-00000306"/> "O       WALTER OGILBY.  "Where have you passed the time of your absence?" she inquired. "The greater part of it in New Haven. " "And of course you saw many agreeable people there."  "Yes, a great many. I went, however, very little into society."  "Your early return quite takes us by surprise-we thought you were to have stayed away two months at least. Of course," with one of her most bewitching smiles, "we must not flatter ourselves that you had grown home- sick-that you longed to see your friends again." ( I must admit that I was very impatient to return-- never more so." Gertrude's heart beat quickly for what was to follow. It did not come ilmmediately-there was another pause. Mr. Ogilby seemed again to deliberate, but at length went on-"I met in New Haven an old acquaintance of vours -Mr. James Andrews of Ashfield." She started, but with admirable self-command she re- plied, "And what did he tell you of our friends-of my uncle's family." "That Miss Morton's health had been somewhat deli- cate ever since her visit here last summer." There was nothing in Mr. Ogilby's tone like the embar- rassment of a lover pronouncing the name of his mistress. On the contrary, his manner had that calm composure which strengthened Gertrude's conviction that upon this point she had nothing to fear. She therefore ventured to remark,-- "I trust there is nothing serious in- her case." "I think her friends have no anxiety in regard to her at present. From Mr. Andrews I learned another thing, which surprised me very much," continued Mr. Ogilby, fixing his eyes upon Gertrude in a manner that, spite of   WALTER  OGIL BY.       6" her efforts, crimsoned her face to the very roots of her hair,--" he informed me that your brother and his sister Kate were engaged to be married." ' With desperate energy Gertrude compelled herself to reply, but it was with a sort of nervous laugh,-- "You were surprised, no doubt, that John Peter could have consoled himself so quickly. Poor fellow I It was happy for him that his was not a life-long disappointment. Ally's friend," with emphasis, "from what I hear of her, is a person to understand her own feelings, and act honor- ably with my brother." Mr. Ogilby with some difficulty curbed his indignant feelings and preserved his equanimity, while she hurried to another point of the subject. "a But how came Mr. Andrews to speak of it? It was to have been kept to the family alone, as I understood, until next summer." 1"Perhaps my friend James can hardly be considered to have overstepped that boundary, in communicating it to me." Gertrude looked up at him with a bright flash. This was coming to the point indeed I "One of the family 1" Slightly audacious it must be admitted, but what of that? She would be politic, however,--she would not appear too readily to understand-she would let matters take their course. "I suppose, then, since my cousin found the air of the Highlands to agree so ill with her," was her remark, in as indifferent a tone as she could assume, "all efforts to tempt her to revisit them will be fruitless henceforth. She will, as I long ago suspected, prefer A southern climate,--Hal- ford Hall for instance." "On the contrary, I am led to believe that she considers this climate peculiarly suited to her--so much so, that it  &#xD;<pb n="612-613" xml:id="VAC7016-00000307"/> "2       WALTER OGILBY. may not be difficult to persuade her to pass a good deal of her time in this region." "I amn sure we shall always be glad to see her at Mil- bank, if she feels disposed to come," said Gertrude, in a constrained voice. "And I, on my part, have no hesitation in assuring her friends," said Mr. Ogilby, emphatically, "that she will be most happy to welcome them in her own home-at Fern- dale." "At Ferndale? Alice to beat Ferndale?" exclaimed Gertrude, almost gasping. "She is already there," said Mr. Ogilby, rising as he spoke. "It was to her husband, Miss Ellsworth, that you uttered these aspersions of one whom you could not but know to be as truthful and upright as she is lovely. What motive actuated you, either in that or in other steps which you took months ago, to separate us, I cannot pre- tend to determine. But I will not trust myself to speak upon this subject," said he, softening, with the natural feel- ing of his sex, to whom the sight of a woman's distress, however deserved, is painful. "I would only express the hope, that the love and tenderness with which your cousin's heart is overflowing, will in time win her the affection of all among whom she is now to live." Gertrude did not attempt to answer him, but with averted face and agitated step hastily left the apartment. Her guest made no effort to detain her, but quietly placing Ally's note to her aunt and his own card in full view upon the mantel-piece, he took his departure. It needed the drive through the bright frosty morning air, aided by the anticipation of the satisfaction to be con- ferred upon his good friend, the doctor, by the news he was bringing him, to overcome the disturbed state of feel- ing which his visit to Milbank had produced. He had,   WALTER OGILBEI        613 however, recovered his usual serenity of manner by the time he reached the end of the long avenue which led to the mansion. The doctor had not yet gone abroad upon his round of professional visits-indeed it might be questioned whether he was not planning to give himself a holiday, for he was sitting very quietly and comfortably with Aunt Lany beside the bright blazing fire, when his young friend walked in upon them. "What I Walter, my dear boy  returned so soon? This is quite unexpected. Your mother said you were coming before long, but I never dreamed that that meant sooner than another month or two. What brought you back?" "A sleigh and two fine horses in the first place," an- swered he, laughing gaily. "In the second-a wish to say Happy New Year to you all; in the third-perhaps a con- viction that there were pleasanter things to be enjoyed in this world than attending even Professor S--'s best course on Natural Science." He looked so bright, so happy, that Aunt Lany could not take her eyes from his fine countenance; she was striving to account for his recovered spirits. The doctor was not so much at a loss. He had, as we have said, his suspicions of Gertrude's increasing influ- ence, and he could see, in the sudden return of his young friend, only a full confirmation of his fears. He did not attempt to respond to the cheerful tone in which he was addressed, but his first salutation over, his brow clouded. "Your course of lectures must have been a very short one," he remarked, dryly. "About as much so as your tone in speaking of them," 52 i.   &#xD;<pb n="614-615" xml:id="VAC7016-00000308"/> "4       WALTER OGILBY] said Mr. Ogilby, with a smile at Mrs. Hardenberg. "I heard only a few of them." "And left them in the midstl Humph! When did you get back?" "Late last evening. You see that I lost no time in coming to pay my compliments to you." "Is this the first call you have made?" "No, I stopped for awhile at Milbank." The doctor had not reseated himself, after having risen to greet his young friend. He turned upon him an earnest, inquiring look. The latter smiled--such a joyous smile as at once made evident to the doctor the happiness of heart which prompted it. "I have a piece of news to tell you," said Mr. Ogilby, hurrying to the point. "Something which I am sure it will please you to hear. I have come to ask your con- gratulations---, The doctor turned from him, and walked away towards the door leading into the entrance hall. "Will you not listen to me?" said Walter, with a pained look, and making a step to follow him. "Tell it to Aunt Lany. It will be enough for me to hear it at second hand." He came back with his overcoat, however, which he began putting on, grumbling at the same time to himself,-- "I ought to have been off to my patients long ago." Mr. Ogilby stood in blank surprise. "My dear doctor," said he, at length, in a tone of deep feeling, " what am I to understand by this? You, who have always been my best friend; are you not going to wish me joy? Am I not at once to take you and Aunt Lany to Ferndale to welcome your little Ally, whom I have brought back to you?" ' .! !  ' K ,   WALTER OGILBY.        615 "Ally?" shouted the doctor. "Not Gitty? Walter, you rogue I why the deuce couldn't' you tell me at once, and not let me make an old fool of myself?" And the old gentleman wiped-his eyes; then, with the aid of his yellow bandanna pocket-handkerchief, sounded a sonorous blast well calculated to summon back his truant cheerfulness. "This is news to make one young again I My pretty, gentle, little Ally I God bless you! God bless you!" And he continued to shake the young man heartily by the hand, until Aunt Lany interposed with,- "Come, sit down, do, and tell us all about it. How did it happen? And when were you married?" "I have no time- for long stories, for I fancy I am ex- pected back at Ferndale by this time. I can only tell you briefly, that I learned from a friend that Ally was not en- gaged to her cousin, John Peter, as I had been led to be- lieve. I went to Ashfield, and in as short a time as it could be accomplished, she was 'woo'd and married and a'."' "Was it by Ally herself that you were led to believe," -the doctor laid some stress on the words,-"that she was engaged to John Peter?" "No, not by Ally." "Oh, very well; then I need ask no more questions. It is just as I always suspected. Now hurry back with yourself. I see that' every minute is an age to you. I will only wait for Aunt Lany to, get on her best bib and tucker, and then we will follow you. To think that we shall see our little Ally there, mistress of Ferndale I Your wife, Walter And what will Aunt Aulchy sav to it? The excitement will help to keep her from a surfeit over the splendid dinner she has been getting up for us all. Well, this is indeed a Happy New Year!"  &#xD;<pb n="616-617" xml:id="VAC7016-00000309"/> "6       WALTER OGILBY. CHAPTER    LXXII. IT is needless to enlarge upon the cordial satisfaction with which Alice was welcomed by the whole circle of warm-hearted friends and acquaintances. There was but one who did not join in the general greeting. Gertrude could not entirely avoid meeting her cousin, but she took care that it should be in the privacy of her own apartment, whither she had retired under pretence of indisposition. Without waiting to take part in any of the wedding festivities, she lost no time in persuading her father to take her to the city for a second visit to her cousins, the Miss Westbrooks. Unfortunately the Spanish nobleman, on whose devotion she had so confidently relied, did not step forward to throw himself, his pedigree, and his broken fortunes at her feet; and, in a fit of desperation, for she was resolved never to return to Milbank to witness the happiness of Walter and Alice, she accepted the hand of a gay young officer, with whom, after a hasty marriage, she repaired to a temporary home, in a dissipated Southern city. Gertrude's love of admiration, and spirit of coquetry, did not desert her, even after she became a wife. She was for a time the belle of the garrison, as well as of the gay city circle of which she became a brilliant member. The pride which her husband at first felt in the homage she received, soon changed, however, into dissatisfaction, when   WALTER  GILBY.       617 he perceived that the devotion of the unprincipled man of fashion was of more importance to her than the society of her husband, or the comfort of his home. Exasperated by her indifference to his remonstrances, he interposed his authority to check her career of folly,-but ?   here her headstrong will, the result of injudicious early in- dulgence, rose up in rebellion. To show her husband that she would not be controlled, she proceeded further than she had at first dreamed of, in provoking his jealousy and rousing him to fury. The result was what might have i    been expected. The quarrel into which he rushed ended :   in a duel, and Captain Covington lost his life by the hand of one who had been formerly his dearest friend. t   Those who knew Gertrude were persuaded that pride I   and the absence of all undue sensibility had preserved her from sinning as deeply as the world charged her with having done,-but the gay and high-spirited Covington had been a favorite in his circle, and its members, one and all, withdrew themselves from the woman whose giddy vanity and reckless defiance' had driven him to so early and so sad a fate. Her father, who, in obedience to her summons, had hastened to her, found her deserted, frowned upon, yet unhumbled. The mortification which, spite of her haughty pride, shN could not help feeling, caused her to resist, strenuously, every proposal to return to the friends of her childhood. In a distant and retired home she persuaded her father to place her, where her nearest connections might occasionally s visit her, but where she would be spared the observation and the pity of those whom she had once haughtily looked down upon. We will hope that penitence ameliorated her sorrows. 52* IX  &#xD;<pb n="618-619" xml:id="VAC7016-00000310"/> "8        WALTER OGILBY.. and that the example of one whose virtues were receiv- ing the reward of much earthly happiness, at, length led her to attempt their imitation; but as of this we have no assurance, we turn to other personages, and other scenes. One of the first duties of Ally, in her happy married home, was to write to Mr. Halford, and give him such an explanation of the causes of Mr. Ogilby's estrangement as would exonerate the latter without compromising her cousin. She had the satisfaction of receiving in return his congratulations, written in a style so hearty as to con- firm her previous conviction, that the attachment of this young gentleman had not been of so deep and abiding a nature as permanently to affect his happiness. If this con- viction needed further strengthening, it received its utmost measure when, at the expiration of another year, the young Southerner accepted an invitation to Ferndale, where Anna Morton was then on a visit to her sister. It was with no small satisfaction that Mrs. Ogilby had' occasion, before many weeks of their acquaintance had passed by, to recall to Mr. Halford her prediction, that i "he would one day find the woman whom   he would  love from. his heart of hearts, and not from pity or sym- pathy."                         j v Gerardus did not die a bachelor. He found charms in his pretty cousin, Katy Van Antwerp, sufficient to chase entirely from his heart the image of his first, false love,- and as this was a match entirely agreeable to old Aunty Rapalje, she rewarded the wisdom of his choice by be- queathing him a fortune he did not need, to the exclusion of sundry poor relations to whom it would have been a blessing. As for the Miss Westbrooks-it is to be taken for   I&amp;,    WWALTER OGILBY.          619 granted that the gay, fashionable young ladies, in process of time, became gay, fashionable wives. Whether they were happy, we must leave for other gay and fashionable people to determine,-our own observation, and it may be our own experience, teaching us that- "The first sure symptom of a mind in health And rest of heart is-quiet felt at home."
