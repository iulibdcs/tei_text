The sacred circle of the family, is herein described by a gentle- hand; not as it always is, but as it might become, if the possession and exer- cise of the christian-graces were made a chief pur- suit, the great study of the fathers and mothers of our land., Parents and children will be helped to the bet- ter enjoyment of the life that now encircles them, and perhaps some may be prompted to- correct va- rious domestic errors by the modest suggestions of the -story. We will not presume to forestall an opinion. nor detain the reader by a prosy preface, but at once allow you to pass on and enjoy, as here you may, a cheerfuli truthful view of scenes at home.

THE COTTAGE HOME. "AND this is to be our home l" said Charles Melrose to his young wife, as they stood, one pleasant summer evening, at the open door of their dwelling, a low, lonely cottage, shel- tered among green New England hills, and almost. hidden by vine leaves and spreading -branches. "This is to be our home, Mary, shall we not make it a happy one?"The wife did not speak; but she laid her hand upon her husband's arm, and looked up into his face 'with eyes beaming with hope and love. "You are right, Mary," said the husband, replying to her look: "It is a happy one now. We will try to keep it so."     "- There is a great deal of meaning in that e little word happy. Many a son and daugh- ter of wealth,--many a heartless. votary of fashion and folly, nurtured in the lap of lux-- ury, surrounded by the wonders of nature and art, would smile at the thought of finding happiness in a little, humble home among the  &#xD;<pb n="10-11" xml:id="VAC8259-00000005"/> 10      HOME SCENES. hills. Yet- it often hides there ; and it would do so oftener still, if the quiet inmates of such secluded spots did but know how to welcome -and how to retain it. Charles Melrose had toiled for long years to purchase the little i domain which he now called-hodme; and the very fact that it was gained by patient indus- try would have made it beautiful and valu  able to him. But this was not all. It had been the home of his parents--parents who went to their rest long years ago, leaving their orphan boy, their only one, to the care of strangers-no---to thecare of God. The little homestead was sold, when they died, to meet the demands of creditors; and :their boy was thrown, friendless and- alone, upon the world. A few -years of dependence and neglect--a few more of ill-requited toil--and the boy, stood upon the threshold of life, ready to enter upon the duties, and assume ; the responsibilities of manhood. It was  . well for him th at he was old enough, when his parents died, to treasure up their counsels in his heart. The remembered glance of his % father's eye-the gentle- pleading o his %; mother's voice, had strengthened him for many? :ia conflict; and restrained him from many a sin. The morning and evening-prayer at the family altar,: the sweet "good night," :the ready participation in all his"childish joys and griefs,--these: were -never forgotten., A-nd whene .the: thought;df a.; new home, a home: of   THE COTTAGE HOME.     " his own, began to mingle with the dreams of early manhood, his heart went :ack to the green, quiiet valley, and vine-wreathed cot- tagme, with bee-hum and bird-music and sun- light and flowers, and dark- trees and pleasant meadows all around it; and the new home seemed to him but a transcript of the old. - He visited that old home once, during a plea- sant summer ramble. The house was vacant, and he readily obtained permission to enter it.. The sunlight, stealing through the vine- lcurtained window, beamed brightly upon the floor, where his mother would sit, with her needle, in the long summer afternoons, while . he played before the door, or leaned; with his book, at her Wide. He remembered where his father's arqnchair stood, in the Winter evenings, beside the fire. He glanced at the corner where the large Family Bible used to lie upon the stand. He opened the door of s the little bed-room, where he had slept the peaceful sleep of childhood. He looked at the vines, trailing, neglected, on the ground. He saw, with a moistened eye, a few of. the flow- ers his mother had loved, blooming among the weeds. He looked round at the green hills, and up to the blue sky. Home! home'! and why not my home?" he said, thoughtfully. He left the cottage and crossed the hills. and fields, directing his course towards a white spire, rising; in the distance, against the dark firs.

The fence around the burial ground was new; and there were -many new monuments within the enclosure. With strangely mingled emotions he sought a well-remembered corner of the churchyard. Those two grass-grown graves! How many, many memories came thronging into his mind, as he stood beside them. Tears-thy tears of strong; stern manhood fell upon the turf ere he turned away, murmuring tremulously the words, "Father'! Mother!" There- were hints among the good people of the little town of Woodbury, that the cot- tage among the hills was' about to have a --tenant, but no one knew, as yet, who the tenant was to be.- Farmer Norton, into whose hands the place had fallen, said that- the price was agreed upon and the deed-was ready, waiting only the payment of the money, the insertion of the name of the purchaser, and the signature of himself and wife. / On such a day the purchaser was to be there; and on such a day he came. The money was paid, the deed signed and witnessed, and the "tttle homestead of the father passed into the hands of the son. Then the mystery was explained, and the wonder, that a young gen- tleman should wish to, buy such ,a little, out of the way place as that, ceased at once. -Farmer Norton shook the stranger's hand most cordially, and welcomed him back to   THE COTTAGE HOME.     13 his boyhood's home ; and friends and neigh- bors, all round rejoiced that the son of a for- mer friend was to take his father's place among them. The few necessarygrepairs were completed: a few improvements, which, with- out taking away the home air of the cottage, would add to its convenience, were- made; and the first month of summer found the owners in possession of their new home. Why might it not be a happy one? It might be, surely ; for a bright eye and a bounding step ever met the husband on-his return from -his daily toil, with a welcome which 'made him forget his weariness. It might be, surely  for the well trained vines hung in graceful festoons from tihe trellis ; and the bees -hum- med merrily from morning till night, among the woodbine and honey-suckle that mantled the little portico. It might be, surely; for the butterflies and liumming birds, danced among the violets and roses ; and -the robin: sang sweetly from the crooked bough of the old apple tree. It might be, surely; for sunlight and verdure were all around it; and loving and grateful hearts throbbed beneath its gray, moss-grown roof. The arm-chair stood beside thy hearth-the Family Bible lay upon the stand in the corner-the voice of prayer ascended, at morning and evenitg, from the family altar-and happiness;': ' as ever dwells upon earth, might be fou:ii Xi  that cottage home.  &#xD;<pb n="14 (Illustration) " xml:id="VAC8259-00000007"/> -' '*-* THE -FAMLY OIRCLE.

The children, a merry group, had gathered in the sunshine before the door. There stood :Char- ley, a manly little fellow of ten years, with his ball in his hand. Mary, the next in agei, had just returned from school; and there was a pleasant smile on her young face, as she held up to the gaze of the other children the "' Re- ward of Merit" received, that night, from her teacher. Ellen, a little: one of six sum- mbrs, clapped her dimple hands and shouted applause; and Arthur, a chubby rogue of three, joined, with hearty good will, in the- shout. The children's glee brought their mother, with an infant in her arms, to'the window. Her face lighted up, as she looked at the little party; .but a moment after, a deep shade passed over her brow, andshe turned away, with a sigh upon her lip, and a tear in her eye. What wals thqre, in that joyous group, to bring sorrow to the mother's heart.? Her glance had fallen upon her lit- tie Amy, who was standing apar from the rest, with a quiet smile on her pale, sweet lip, and a subdued expression of suffering blending with her smile. But for that sad, dreamy expression Which sometimes, stole over Amy's face, a stranger would have cal-  &#xD;<pb n="16-17" xml:id="VAC8259-00000009"/> 16' HOME SCENES. . led her the fairest bud in the household wreath. Her sweet temper seemed to shed sunlight all around her, and her clear Cvoice made rich heart-music from morning till night. And yet her parents never looked upon her without a sigh, never caressed her without a repressed thrill of agony. Poor little Amy was blind. Heer dark, beautiful eyes were clear and cloudless; but she lifted them to the bright summer sun, and saw no light. She mingled, at times, with a look of thought- ful gladness, in the sports of the other chil- dren; and then, again, she would steal away from them, and sit silently in her little chair beside her mother, with her head resting lovingly upon her knee. Anid then'Mrs. Melrose knew that Amy was ill, though she never complained ; and not unfrequently, a tear would fall upon the soft brown hair of the child, who wondered much what cpuld so grieve her mother. There were some little peculiarities about the other children. Charles united to a hasty and violent temper, a generous affectionate heart. Mary was gentle and forbearing, and timid almost to a fault. Ellen seemed a very tolerable example of perpetual motion; and Arthur's ruling passion was curiosity. As for Georgie, the baby, he was unanimously acknowledged (by every member. of the fam- ily,) to be the fattest, the prettiest, and the best baby that ever wasin the world. Had r ,'*                     .    THE FAMTTLY CIRCLE.    17 not our friends reason to rejoice in the pos- session of such a treasure? Rich-the meaning of the word depends upon the mind that defines it. The world would have called Charles Melrose poor, and pitied him for his' poverty. He called him- self rich, and felt his heart glow in the con- sciousness of his- wealth. He went forth, at morning to his toil, with a prayer for a bles- sing upon his- lips ; and he returned again, at evening, with a silent thanksgiving for the blessings that had been accorded him through the day. To labor for those whom we love is not a burden, but a pleasure. Charles Ielrose -felt this ; and his heart was cheered and his hands were strengthened, many a time, during the sultry hours of his harvest toil, by the pleasant picture of his sheltered home, that rose, with almost the vividness of real- ity, before him. Labor for- those whom we love is not a burden, but a pleasure. So felt that gentle mother, as she fed, and clothed, and lulled to sleep her little ones. And so, with hopeful hearts and busy hands they toiled on, day after day, and year after year, 0e,; not in name only, but in purpose and in h:e-.

Their clothing-twas plain, and their table though abundantly supplied with healthful food, offered little; to tempt the appetite of, the luxurious. But whereimental or moral improvement was in  view, money went,freely. The children were sent to school regularly and punctually; and their teachers had no reason to complain of deficient books or neglected lessons. Their places in the village church and thie sabbath schbol were seldom vacant; and" their home traning was such as to deepen and confirm , . -any good impression received there. Prompt ( and cheerful obedience toparental authority, love to each other, and -strict truthfulness, were required, and usually rendered -byl all. An occasional delfrturefrom the narrow path of duty was of course, to be expected and provided for; but such departures were rare; and the remorse attendant upon them was, in most instances, an all-sufficient punish- ment. A little incident, which 'occurred a few days after our first view of the 'family. circle, will serve to illustrate the effect .t)f correct moral training upon the childish mind. - Charley had been pleading with his mother, for some dais, for permission to take off his shoes and sockings, and go, bare-  footed, to school. His mother met his re- peated requests with repeated refusals. -She knew that the ground was still damp and ;i *  "   THE FAMLY CIRCLE.    19 cold; and she knew, too, that Charley was subject to a cough and hoarseness, whenever he took a slight cold; and this knowledge made the fact that other boys were splashing in the mud-puddles, and running through the fields, with their feet uincumbered by super- fluous coverings, a fact of little weight with her. One night, Charley came home from school hoarse, and with a cough. Mrs. Melrose was surprised, for the day had been a plea- 'sant one ; but, as she stood beside his bed, at night, a thought flashed through her mind; and she said, half-doubtingly, "My son, have you had your shoes and stockings off to day?"Charley hesitated for a moment, aim then replied in the affirmative. "I know it was wrong mother,'! he said; but the other boys all had theirs off; and it was so plea- sant, I thought I should not take cold. I only had them off a little while at noon. I will never do so again, mother, never." Pleased with the boy's frank confession- of his fault, and moved by his sufferings,- the mother reproved him gently, not direaming of -the repetition of the offence. Charley was at school the next day, and was soon as well as usual. But, not more than a week after, he came home again, at night, with the cough and the hoarseness as before.

Charley wint up stairs early that night. The other:c:hildren soon followed;  Mr. Melrose went out, to call on a neighbor; and the mother sat alone, with her, sewing, beside the cradle. She looked up from her work as the clock struck nine; Iand, as the last vibration ceased, she heard a light, steal- ing step upon the stairs. She-listened. Down it came, slowly and cautiously, step by step; and then she heard a rustling in the passage, and saw the latch of her door lifted, slowly aid noiselessly. I What could it mean? The door opened a little way; and some oue looked in.; Then it opened wider, and Char- ley, in his-night-dress, -crept timidly to his mother's side. "Why, Charley, what is the --matter? Why did you come down stairs?" lhe exclaimed in surprise. A stifled sob was the only answer. "Are you sick?" she:in- quired, anxiously, as she laid her hand- upon his hot forehead." "No mother;" and again Charley stifled a rising sob. "' What is the matter, my son?" said Mrs. Melrose in:alarm. "Have you been asleep?"

For some minutes neither spoke. "Mother," said Charley, at last, rais- ing his head suddenly, and looking up, earn- estly, into her. face; "Mother, will you ever believe me again?"His mother answered with a kiss. She could not yet: command her voice sufficiently to speak. Charley saw the tears upon her cheeks, and sobbed again, almost as bitterly as before. "There, there, '. my boy ;" said his mother,. soothingly,. at last--" that will do. I shall not be afraid to trust you again; for I do' not think you, will ever forget this. I think you have suffered enough to make you more careful imrfuture." Charley's sobs ceased; but he did not raise his head from his mother's lap. Tenderly and seriously that mother talked to her boy; and when her counsels were ended, she gen- tly raised his head from its resting-place, and kneeling, with her hand resting lightly upon his forehead, she' sought, from above, pardon  and peace for'the erring one.

Unseen, unthought of it may-be; yet-., it isfelt; and its effects are obvious even to the eyes of strangers. Some families are ruled by fear. The children" creep timidly about, anticipating reproof at every-motion, and dreading correction for every mistake. Unnaturally restrained at home, they long for freedoms - ' rejoice when a .,temporary absence from parental Carere gives scope to all the extravagance of long-repressed merri- ment and mischief. It is well if no bitter feelings mingle-with their mirth--if hatred does not spring up in their hearts instead of love-if deception does not become their re- fuge from injustice and oppression. In some families, avarice is the ruling motive. The parents do not call it by such a name-do not suspect that it is worthy of such an ap- pellation; and yet, -wat else is it?

Who can wonder, if the little economist of four years, become a miser at four score?  Children should be taught economy; but I very much doubt the expediency of encouraging a child to hoard up-money. There is no danger of any want of selfishness in the humanheart, after all is done that can be done to exterminate it. Some parents govern by the love of praise. Their children! are taught to do right, in order to appear well, and gain the good opinion of others. Is it very strange that, thus taught, they should, in after years, sacri- fice principle to acquire-popularity? No such motives as'these found a place in ,the family government of Mr. and Mrs. Mel- rose. Love was the guiding influence in their 'little circle, and its power was all-suMficient. When the husband and wife bent over the cradle of their-first-born; they resolved that no harsh or impatient words should ever fall from their lips upon the ear of their little one. That resolution was never broken. Its observance was comparatively easy for Mrs, Melrose. She was naturally of a mild and equable disposition';5nd a mother's loving f ,    THE GUIDING INFLUENCE.   -25 heart is ever ready to find excuse or pallia- tion for the errors of her children. But Mr. Melrose was naturally hasty; and his wife smiled, more than once, as he turned silently away, with a compressed lip and frowning brow, leaving her to administer reproof or prescribe punishment, as the case might de- mand; and returning, five minutes after, to approve of her administration of justice, and laugh with her, at his own power of self-con- trol. Gradually, however, that power was attained, and by the time that his assistance in the management of the family was requi- site, he was prepared to afford prompt and efficient aid. Discipline was not often ne- cessary. A gentle word of caution or of re- proof was usually enough. When punish- ment'was deemed advisable, it was of such a character, and administered in such a man- ner, as to leave a deep and permanent impress sion upon the mind of the offender. Charley's hasty temper was a cause of con- siderable anxiety to his parents. They had reasoned with him in vain. He was ready to acknowledge it was wrong to indulge in an- ger; he'sincerely regretted the' effects of his out-bursts of passion ; and always endeavored to atone, as far as possible, for any injustice or unkindness into which he had been be- trayed. Mary's favorite doll, a birthday present from her father, was broken one day, in a fit of anger. The poor child gathered  &#xD;<pb n="26-27" xml:id="VAC8259-00000014"/> 26      HOME SCNESS. up the fragments from the floor, and sat down to cry over them in one corner of her little bed-room. Before night, Charley's store of money was exhausted in the, purchase of ano- ther doll, larger and handsomer than the one he had demolished^ and his arms were around Mary's necli, and his tears dropped upon her bosom, as he: placed the peace-offering in her hands, and begged her to forgive him. Mary told'her mother afterwards that she always loved Charley best after he had been doing wrong, 'Mr. and Mrs. Melrose, looking thought- fully forward, feared for their boy. It seemed to them that his irritability increased, instead of -dimnishing, as he grew older. They were satisfied that admonition was not enough; and they resolved that the next of- fence should be followed by a suitable penal- ty. The offence soon came. The children were at play in the orchard, one Saturday morning, and Amy, who had been allowed to accompany them by Charley's special request, was sitting on a green bank in the shade, laughing. at their merry shouts as they scam- pered around the enclosure, and amus'mg her- self by fingering over the toys with which they had filled her lap. Suddenly, Char- 1ley took a fancy that a game of ball would be better than the race which they were running, and he called to Amy to throw im his ball.

It, was almost school-time, and Charley was in a hurry. "Make haste Amy!" he called, im- patiently, "throw me the ball!" Amy had taken the last toy from ;her lap, and was hold- ing the ball in her hand, ready for a throw, when, all at once, the thought of going to carry it entered her little head; and she rose from her seat, and crept slowly towards the voice that was now calling loudly and angrily. 'Throw it, Amy   - Throw itl" "I'm coming to bring it to you, brother Charley," said the little one, pleasantly; as Charley, losing all patience, darted forward to meet her, exclaiming, :"The little blind snail! she will not be here in an hour I Why didn't you throw it, as I told-you to? he added, angrily, as he snatched-the--ball'rude- ly from her hand. Amy was near one of the old apple-trees, with the hand containing the ball -stretched out, and one foot lifted for a step forward, when Chariey met her. The shock of meeting her brother, and the sud- den snatching of the ball from her hand, caused her to lose her balance.- She fell, striking her head, in the fall, against the rough balk of the old apple-tree. The mo- ment Charley saw her fall, his better nature trumphed. He sprang to raise her; and when Mrs.-:ielrose, alarmed by Amy's cries, hastened to the spot, she found the repentant  &#xD;<pb n="28 (Illustration) " xml:id="VAC8259-00000015"/> 28      HOME -SCENES  boy holding his little sister in his arms, and striving to repress his own tears and wipe away hers, while he showered upon her every endearing epithet. "There'! there  Amy! darling precious little sister 1' he said, in a. low, soothing tone; and then, turning suddenly, as his mother's. voice struck his  ear, he exclaimed, "Oh! mother! mother!" Mrs. Melrose comprehended the scene at once. Without a single word after her first mild, sorrowful, "My on so he took the child, and led the, way to the house. The- application of cold water soon relieved the pain; and Amy, with a bandage around her forehead, and a large settled spot-on her pale cheek, was laid- tenderly on her little couch, asking only that her mother might sit beside her, and sing her to sleep. "Mary!" said Mrs. Melrose in a low voice, after the child's eyes were closed in slumber, "where is Charley? "In the orchard, mother," was the reply. "He has not been in since Amy fell." "Tell him to -come to me," said the mother calmly; and Charley came- with his eyes swollen with weeping ; "It is school-time my son ," was the remark addressed to the little culprit; and the kindness of the sad voice made his heart throb with new anguish. "It is school-time, my son; go and wash your face and hands, and brush your hair. Mary is all ready.

There will be no din- ner to'carry to-day, you know." And then, as Amy moved uneasily upon her pillow, the sweet sound of a simple song lulled the child to her rest again. That was a sad forenoon for Charles. He walkedrlslowly and sadly to school, thinking of Amy's bruised cheek and bleeding fore- head all the way. His mother's mournful eyes looked from the pages of every book he opened; and Amy's sob rose above the busy hum of the schoolroom. He anticipated -a reproof from his father on his return home, and the loss of his half-holiday ; and his con- science told him that he deserved both re- proof and punishment. But his father, who sat tenderly holding Amy in his arms, and bathing her forehead with water, when Char- ley entered the house, said not a word upon the subject, though it was evident, from his shadowed face, that he knew the whole. No one spoke to Charley; no one looked at him. His mother's face was pale, and his father's brow was stern. The noon-tide re- past was a silent one. When it was over, Charley wandered out around the house, and finally sat down, alone, at the foot of the- tree against which Amy had fallen. He had wept bitterly there, in the morning; but he did not weep now. Proud, angry thoughts were in his heart. Was he so very much to  &#xD;<pb n="30-31" xml:id="VAC8259-00000017"/> 30      HOME SCENES. ' blame, after all? He had told Amy to throw the ball. Why did she not throw it instead of creeping along so very deliberately to bring it? He knew he had spoken harshy to her -; but he was in a hurry. He did not mean anything. He did not mean to throw her down, When he snatched the ball from her hand. He wlvs sure he was very sorry for it afterwards. But they would not give him a chance to tell them so. They would  not speak to him nor even look at him.' He did not think Amy was hurt much. She al- ways cried for nothing. He never meant to have her near him again, when he was at play.--- But, above all these bitter thoughts were a still, small voice, a voice that would  be heard,-accusing Charley of cruelty and sin. He tried to silence itin vain; and when Mary called from the open door, "Charley mother wants you ;" he was almost glad to exchange the accusations of his; own consCi- ence for the low sad tones of his mother's voice. Yet hedreaded to hear her speak, and he crept slowly along to her pleasant lit- tle room, with the feeling of a criminal, about to receive the sentence -of -condemnation for his .crlmes., His mother was sitting in her rocking chair, near the window.

She motioned to him to sit down on the cricket at, her feet; and he obeyed, without speaking, without even looking up once into her face. She took both his hands gently in one of hers; and placed the other on his head. "Now, my son," she said," tell me all about Amy's fall this morning." Has not Mary told you?" said Charley, looking up in sur- prise. "No, Charley ;" was the reply; "Mary commenced telling me at the time; but I stopped her. I wished to hear the story first from you." Charley was silent. (' I am waiting A for you, my son;" said Mrs. Melrose calmly. Charley commenced. "We had been leading Amy round a while mother; but we thought we wanted to have a run round the orchard, and Amy could not run with us, you know. So we led her to the green bank, and gave her all our play things to persuade her to sit still while we had our race." "That was all right, my son;" said Mrs. Melrose, as Charley paused in his narrative. ( How long did you run?"  "We ran round the orchard three or four times, till we were -tired ; and then I said we would have a game of ball. Amy had the ball in her lap, and I called to her to throw it to me.

I would rather stay here, with you; for you never speak cross to me; ande you love me just as well as if I could see, don't you, mother?'" Mrs. Melrose paused; and Charley felt her warm tears falling upon his hands. He had not often seen his mother weep. "I am :sure mother," he said, "I do love Amy dearly; and I will try never to be vexed with her again. Will you forgive me this once, dear mother?" and Charley's eyes were running over with tears, as he looked up into his mother's face. "' I have forgiven you a great many times, Charley ; but you have not succeeded in gov- ern your temper. This time I think I must punish you." Charley said nothing. He knew that remonstrance would be useless. He wondered what the punishment would be. He hoped something to make him remember to do right, next time; but lhe did not mean   THE GUIDING INFLUENCE.   35 to care much about it, if he could help it. Mrs. Melrose went on. "I think I shall not trust Amy with you any more, till you have given me some proof of self-control.

I hope that, by the time she has quite recovered-from the effects of her fall, you will have improved so much, that I shall feel safe to leave her in your care again." Charley had never dreamed of such a pun- ishment. He had taken a great deal of care of Amy, not only because she was blind, and' needed care; but because he loved. her, and loved to make her happy. He was older and stronger than the other children; and he could lift her over slight obstructions, and sometimes carry her a little way, when she was tired. He had delighted in doing' this, and in hearing her say, when the rest wanted to lead her. "I'll go with brother Charley." Now, he was not to lead her any more for a long time; and then came the thought of what his mother had said about the little child in its coffin, and, the fear that Amy might die,-that he never should play with her, and teach her to love him, any more, Poor Charley was very miserable. He sat thinking, silently, till his mother said, " you may go now my son." Then he crept very quietly down stairs.

She looked very' pale; but she was smiling languidly at something Mary was-saying to her. Charley did not want her'to hear his step ; so he stole along very softly,: and, passed out into the orchard again. He had no heart to play, that- afternoon. He sat thinking, under the old tree, till Mary came to call him to supper. The sun was low, then; and before it was quite, dark, he went, without saying good night, to any one, to his Chamber.

"You may tell me what you think about that, when it is finished," replied her father, "but please not to interrupt me again. Once upon a time," he commenced anew, "a 'poor man undertook to buiild a house. He had been working and saving money for it, a long time. At last he thought he had enough to pay for building. So he bought a piece of land, and hired a team to draw the Ntimber, and boards, andshingles, and stone that he -would want about the house. Then he went to work to dig the-cellar ; and stoned it up all around, nicely. It was hard work, and he was tired a great many times before it was done; but he finished it, and went to work on the' timber for the frame of the house. - When the frame- was 'all ready, the neighbors came to help him raise it. -But he, had' made some mistale about it, and the timbers would not fit into their places.

"-So the house is built, is it, Mary?" said her father. ," Yes, father," replied- Mary, laughing j "and it will never want building over again.  In fact, from that time, whenever -Mary felt discouraged about anything she was trying to do, she would say to herself, "Once upon a time a poor man undertook to build a house," aand concluded to " try once more.

And little Amy, where is she?

There was a reason for Charley's happiness. He had been striving, through the entire week, to control his hasty temper ;and he had suc- ceeded, beyond, far beyond his hopes. Little trials had come ; and his cheek had flushed, and his eye had flashed with anger; but he had thought of Amy, and triumphed. A single moments's pause was enough to enable him to control his irritation ; and. his moth- er's glance of approval, at the close of one "of his silent struggles, was an ample reward. for the, effort. But the greatest trial was at school. At home, all tried to encourage and aid him; but among his school-fellows were some, who, aware of 'his passionate disposition, took de- light in teasing him,--hoping to provoke him to an out-burst of angry words, or a violent attempt at- revenge. They had brought him into disgrace with his teacher and his parents more than once. Was it strange that his mother looked a little anx- ious, when he came home from school on Friday afternoon, later than usual, with his hat torn, his face brtufed and bleeding, and his books covered with mud?"Where have you been, Charley?" she exclaimed. "To school, mother," was the quiet reply ; and Charley smiled, as he saw his mother's eye fixed upon him with an inquiring glance.

Charley could have told, himself, at once. Though his father's face had more sunshine in it than he had seen there the whole week before; though little Amy warbled like a bird in her childish gladness ; though the other children gathered around him with new merriment; Charley knew that there was one whose lip had uttered no word of gladness or of praise, but whose heart was filled with joy and thankfulness for him. Mrs. Melrose did not often praise her-children. They read her approval in her eye ; and felt it in the approval of their own consciences. Her ap- proval was precidus to them ; but she taught them to lookhigher for a motive of action. She taught them, to do right, because it was the will of God, their Heavenly Father ; and becauseit was their- duty to love and obey him. After all, Charley was not very, much,' mistaken, when he told his teacher thatho had the best mother in the world.   . .   o HIPTER     T. i-  C[ CHBRISTIN CHARITY. IT was a pleasant autumnal evening; and Mr. and Mrs. Melrose were sitting on op- posite sides of the little round table drawn up before the fire, both earnestly engaged, though in very different occupations. Mrs. Melrose was seated in'her low rocking-chair, with one foot upon the rocker of the cradle, and a large basket, filled with a miscellnbous assortment of articles,' at her side. There was a jacket " out at the elbows" belonging to Charley,--a pair of pants "out at the knees" that looked as if they might fit Ar- thur,-a dress with a rent in the skirt- for Mary, and another, with half 'the seams rip- ped open for Ellen ;-there was a little, well- worn apron that, looked remarkably like Amy's, and a blanket that could not possibly belong to any one but Georgie. There were stockings of all sizes, from the thick blue woolen. pair, too long for any feet but " fath- er's," to the tiny red ones toed with white, ,         . :  &#xD;<pb n="48-49" xml:id="VAC8259-00000027"/> 48   v  HOME SCENES.     - and with a hole in each toe, proof positive s: of the activity of the baby feet that wore ; j them. -On the table were rolls of patches, ix spools of cotton, and balls of yarn; a needle- - book, a piece of wax, a pair of -scissors; in ' short, all those et-ceteris: whidh ag:gqod house- keeper calls into such frequent requisition, : in repairing the ruins Time or childish ac- - tivity and manly toil may have wrought. -  ;, Most industriously :Mrs. "Melrose plied her needle, pausing only, from time to' time, to cut aind, adjust a patch, or exchange a ball of yarn or a spool of cotton for another ofi a different color, or to glance, with a look of materAial love, at the-children grouped' tot gether in a quiet game in the corner, or; to lift- her eyes to -the shadowed face of her hus-. band, who sat, with his elbow leaning on the table, and his head resting on .his hand, ab-  sorbed in thought. He', had been reading aloud in the early part of the evening, but the book was finished and laid .aside, and, judging from the iexpression:of his features, the contents of the volume'had:passed fromi his mind-as its last- words fell from his .lips. His brow was thoughtful, almost- sad; and  the shadow- upon it -seemed to deepen, hour by hour. Mrs.- Melrose- said, nothing-; but in her heart she wondered what he could be  thinking of so earnestly. Eight o'clock came ; and with it came good-nights and kis soes enough to awaken any common muser   CHRISTIAN CHARITY.    49 from his dreaming. Mr. Melrose mechani- cally echoed the good-nights, and returned the kisses in so, abstracted a manner; that Arthur ran up stairs laughing merrily, and shouting, "Father kissed me on my nose I Father kissed me right on the end of my nose i" "Hush! hush I Arthur! you'll wake up lthe baby;" whispered Mary, vainly try- ing to silencer the noisy little urchin. But. baby was happily too much accustomed to noise- to wake for such a tr ifle. Mr. Melrose, partially recovering from his abstraction, smiled at the little fellow's merriment; and Mrs'. Melrose, returning the smile, placed her work. on the table, and followed the children up-stairs, leaving the cradle and its occupant in her husband's charge till her return. When; she came down- stairs again, she found him sitting in the same position in which she had left him, as if the one thought pervading his mind was too absorbing to admit of word or motion. Her -first thought was to peep into the cradle, to see that the sleeper- there was not awakening, and her next, to arouse her husband from his moody reverie. "My dear husband," she said, cheerfully "what are you thinking of, this evening?' - Mr. MelroSe started. Did you speak to me," he inquiired as if half-doubting the evi- deuce of his senses.

"And what made you think of that, to- night?'" said his wife. "( A conversation that I had this afternoon with a professed infidel," returned Mr.. Miel- rose,-' one who believes in nothing higher than a refined system of morality--and who, I am ashamed to say, lives a purer life than most of our church'members--leaving pro- fessors of religion in general altogether out of the question." "Who is he?" said Mrs. Melrose. "You have often seen him;" was the re-  ply. His name is Jarvis. He is an intelli- gent and kind-hearted man; but I do not think he will ever be a Christian." "Why not?" inquired Mrs. Melrose., "Because," replied her husband, " he looks at the dark side of religion; and founds his contempt for the faith, upon the inconsistency of those who profess to be guided by it. And I must say," added Mr. Melrose with something of bitterness in his tone; "he has ample materials for a broad foundation." Mrs. Melrose sighed. Mr. Melrose went on. "I have argued with him many times, and have thought, in a few of our last con- versations, that he seemed somewhat impres- sed by:the truth; but this afternoon, at the close of the political meeting inl the Town flail, he came to me in triumph. An unfor-   CHRISTIAN CHARITY.    -'51 tunate. incident had completely confirmed, in his mind, the correctness of a position which I had hoped he was beginning to doubt. You have heard of the unkind feeling between "Squire Ellwood and his brother-in-law, Dea- con Wilson?"  Mrs. Melrose replied in the affirmative. "Well. They are both church-members, you know; though; they belong to different chur- ches. I think Deacon Wilson much the more honorable of the two; though 'Squire Ell- wood is connected with us in church-fellow- ship. They were both at the Town Hall to- day; and, of course, they were on different sides,'Squire Ellwood supporting the Whigs, and Deacon Wilson- the diminutive-Liberty party." Mrs. Melrose smiled; she did not mingle much in politics; but the names and purpo- ses of the different parties were familiar to her; and, in her opinion, 'Squire Ellwood stood, and had long been standing, on- the wrong side. Mr. Melrose continued his nar- rative. "'Squire Ellwood spoke, and Dea- con Wilson replied. Some portions of his reply bore ratheriheavily upon:his antagonist, who rose to explain. When he resumed his seat, Deacon Wilson rose a second; time. 'Squire Ellwood stepped lup to him, and in an insulting manner, commanded him to sit down and hold Ihis peace.

He said to me, on our way home, "If that is the influence of Chris- tianity, I have no wish to be a Christian." I could not wonder at it. I have been ask- ing myself, this evening, "Is it possible that such men are Christians?" Mr. Melrose paused, his eyes sparkling with excitement. Mrs. Melrose plied her needle. slowly and thoughtfully, in silence., In a few minutes Mr. Melrose resumed the conversation. " 'SqUe Elwood is the rich-, est member in our church, I know. He does a great deal of good; but it is all done in a showy way. He subscribes largely to be- nevolent objects ,--his name is often men- tioned as that of a public benefactor; but in private business,-in the little, every-day affairs that make up life--he is mean,--con- - temptible. His irritable temper is a source of trials to every one whom he employs. There is nothing lovely or amiable about him. Can such a man be a Christian?" -"Allow me to say," replied Mrs. Melrose, - after a quiet pause of perhaps a minute; "allow me to say that I think your portrait a little too deeply shaded to be correct. I think, if you will let me take the pencil, I can soften some of the tints, and throw a different light upon the whole."   CHRISTIAN CHARITY.    53 'Try ;" said Mr. Melrose. "To begin, then, with the family disagree- ment. This is undoubtedly an error, and a serious bne. But there may be excuses for it, which we cannot see. In such affairs, there is always blame on both sides. What provocation 'Squire Ellwood may have had, or wthat palliating circumstances might be offered as an excuse for him, we shall never ,know. Still, it is true-that nothing can whol- ly excuse him. We will set this down, if you please, as a sad fault, a stain upon his christain character, and let it pass. The in- cident which took place this afternoon, I think perfectly natural, 'and quite excusable. 'Squire Ellwood is passionate. Hehas never been taught to control his temper. He was probably neglected in this respect while young, and it is not probable that any one has dared, since his boyhood, to intimate to him the importance of self-control. I do not doubt he would have given thousands, half an hour after, for the power to recall that - burst of passion. We will call this a weak- ness, and forget it." "You are very charitable ;" remarked Mr. Melrose, with a smile; " but you will permit me to observe that you have omitted one thing--large subscriptions to benevolent ob- jects, and private meanness."

Squire Elwood's father was a rich man,--rich, as any .one may be who makes wealth the chief aim of existence. He rpse from poverty to wealth by a system of r)tid economy-of-what we should call mean- ness, though I presume he never thought of any one's calling it so. :Would it be strange if his son recieved some lessons from him, to be remembered and practised through life-? 'Squire Elwood wishes to do good. He wish- es to do it upon a large scale. He gives lib- crally, and suffers his name to go forth with his gift, that 'the influence of his example may not-be lost upon the world. And, in looking forward to the large amount of good which - he hopes to accomplish, he forgets the little acts of generosity which would spread so much happiness around him. It is unfortunate ; it is wrong ; but still, I think it should be con- sidered as a, misfortune, rather than a fault." " Really, I had-no idea you were such a pleader!" said Mr. Melrose, evidently insome : degree-impressed by his, wife's reasoning, as if  well as amused by her earnestness. "Is that all?" "Not quite.

But tell me what you think of him? Is he not very uncharitable to judge of Christians and Christianity as he does?" ' Whlat can you expect of an infidel?" said Mrs. Melrose, sadly. "Itis strange, very strange, that Christians think so little of the value ofconsistency. I do not wonder that Mr. Jarvis judges as he does. I remember, when I was' very young, watching professed Christians with something like, the feelings - with which he watches them now. I often saw them do things that I would not have done, even then; and then I said to myself, 'I do not see that they are any better with religion than I am without it.' But, since I have called myself a follower of Christ, I look upon these things in a differerent light. There are so many things to be taken into the account-parentage-early influences- unconsciously formed habits-constitutional infirmitiesor peculiarities-there are so many things which the eye of God alone can see, that I think, when I see a Christian doing what I think wrong.. 'Perhaps, in the same circumstances, I should have done the same. God alone knows the measure of his temp - tion and his sin.'

I try the most, that I feel as if I, if any one, ought to be charitable to others."  Mr. Melrose sat, thoughtfully, for a few minutes, and then said," If you ought to be charitable, Mary, I am sure I ought. But, allowing all that you have said to be cor- rect ; and I see no reason why it may not be so; there is still one thing that troubles me moree than- all the rest. It is something, too, for which I see no remedy" The brow of Mr. Melrose grew dark again, as he spoke. "What is it, my husband?" said Mrs. Mel- rose . "A fact to which Mr. Jarvis alluded to- day. ' Samuel Elwood,' said he, ' is a mem- ber of a church professedly anti-slavery. I He contributes for the relief of fugitives from  oppression. .

Elwood is the leading man in your church, because he is the richest-man in it. Most of your church members know what the man is., He is not much beloved or esteemed among them.

If I were a christ- ian, he continued, vehemently, 'I would never enter a church controlled by such a man." A shadow passed over the serene face of Mrs. Melrose, as her husband commenced the repetition of Mr. Jarvis's remarks. It deep- ened as he proceeded ;, and when he ceased speaking, she was silent. Mr. Melrose waited for her reply, but he waited in vain. "Now, Mary,"' he said, at last; "if your charitable spirit can remove this mountain, I will be thankful."  "This ismall wrong;" answered the wife, sadly, "these things ought not so to be. Either our church should not call itself anti-slavery, or such men should be excluded from it." "But what could we do without Elwood?" demanded her husband. It is just as- Mr. Jarvis sayS,-the church could not live- with- out him.  "Let it die, then tlsaid Mrs. Melrose, ener- getically;.!"But it would not die ;--it would live as it never yet has done ;" she added, hastily. "Oh! if our church-members had only independence enough to speakthe truth -only self-reliance enough to dare to try to stand alone-only faith enough in an over- ruling Providence to do right, and leave the consequences with God,-this should not be so. , We might be poorer-- our minister's sal- ary might be less-but the blessing of Gdd would rest upon us, as it never yet has done."  &#xD;<pb n="58-59" xml:id="VAC8259-00000032"/> 58   '   -HOME SCENES. Mrs. Melrose paused. She had spoken longer and more earnestly than she had in- tended. Mr. Melrose moved his chair back from, the table, and thoughtfully paced the rooms. Then even your charity cannot cover this, Mary?"he said, after a pause.' "( Charity cannot cover sin ;" returned Mrs. Melrose, gravely. "A church cannot prosper, while members are admitted or retained; from such unworthy motives. If our church is pro-slavery, let it call itself so. If it calls itself anti-slavery, let it be so.

The demands upqn her time and talents in this line soon became- so frequent, that she found it necessary to regulate affairs, as she expressed it, by ass'gning a certain hour, each day, -for all a-plications of the kind.

I've been in families where the children fairly ran over their parents heads. I kept them far enough off so that they didn't run ove r me, I can tell you. Most children ain't governed at all. Our family was governed; but not as you govern yours. Mother loved her children and meant to make them mind her; but she was quick. It was a word and a blow, with her, and sometimes the blow would come first. It wasn't the best way; but'twas better than no government at all. You never strike your children, do you?" "Not after they are old enough to be gov- erned by other means ;" returned Mr. Mel- rose. There is a time when it seems neces- sary to govern most children by fear. The habit of obedience musthe formed very early, before a child is capablee of being influenced by reason ; but, after the first few years, oth- er modes of punishment are, in my opinion, preferable to this. For some-children a sin- gle punishment is sufficient; others need more.  Our little Amy has never been pun- ished at all. We govern her altogether by love. An appeal to her affectionate disposi- tion always insures obedience. Mary might be governed almost entirely by love of praise ; but that would be dangerous policy. Iprefer higher motives.

Georgie is the, baby-hardly conquered yet, though he will i be, soon. We are doing as well-as we can with them all." "I think you are doing as well as any one could," said Aunt Susy. "The best of it all is, that you'work together. If father or mother says anything, there's no danger of its being contradicted. I know one family, where, if the children want a ride or a sail, they ask their father for it, and tell their mother, afterwards' Father says we may go. And another I know, where a little girl when her father tells her to do anything, looks up and asks him if mother said so. I've longed to tell people, a great many times, that they were doing wrong; but what's the use? Half of them would say I was meddling with what did'nt concern me ; and the- other half would think the same. People will have their own way about such things. It's nq Ase to try to turn them out of it ;" and Aunt Susy rolled up her knitting-work, and betook herself to the"shelter of her little room.

She yielded to their wishes, and relinquished the obnoxious suit- or; put a single step farther she would not go. All attentions, beyond those of mere civility, were afterwards quietly declined. Her life has been a very useful one ; she finds a welcome in many homes ; but it is not pro- bable that she is as happy as she would have been in a home of her own." A: . few weeks after the above conversation, Mr. Melrose returned, in fine spirits from 'a trip to-the city. It was a cold winter day. The children, except Amy and George, were at school. Aunt Susy sat in the corner with the knitting ; and Mrs. Melrose was, as usu-  al, occupied with her needle. Mr. Melrose greeted them all, and seating himself before the fire, held out his hands to the blaze, glan- cing somewhat mischievously, meanwhile, at Aunt Susy.  But Aunt Susy's face retained its usual expression of tranquility; and her knitting needles went on, obedient to her busy fingers, just as they had done before her nephews return. Soo:ie unheeded glance became a- fixed, earnest, gze; so fixed and earnest that Aunt Susy-invol'untarily looked up from her work, and ,exo!t med. "Why, ' . " :   AUNT SUSY.       69 what in the world are you looking at me so for 9" "Whom do you suppose I saw in the city, to-day?" was the indirect reply.--"A great many people, no doubt ;" said Aunt Susy, "I saw enough when I was there; but there's no one there that I know anything about." "Are you sure of that, Aunt Susy?" pur- sued Mr. Melrose, at the same time giving his wife a meaning glance.  "Why, yes. How should I know anything allout people in a city two hundred miles from home?"  "Well -I think you are mistaken this time. Aunt Susy ;"- said Mr. Melrose. "I saw a gentleman there, who inquired for you. Let me give you a description of him. He was a tall, powerful looking man, with dark hair, slightly mingled with grey, a high, broad forehead, and the keenest pair of black eyes I have seen for a long time. Do you recog- nize him from my description?"Aunt Susy was very busy, picking up a stitch. Of course the question was unheard. And yet, it was a little singular that her cheek should flush, just at that moment, as it did. The fire was warm, though ; that might have been the -reason. Mr. Melrose smiled; but he said nothing more.         , . The Winter snows passed away; and the Ilue violets blossomed, as if they thought Spring had come again.

"Come, Aunt Susy," said Charley, one peculiarly pleasant afternoon; '" it is warm enough to- day to spend our hour after tea out doors.- Is j it not, Mary?" "Oh, yes," Mary answered.  "You will, will you not, Aunt Susy?"-2' Please do-!" exclaimed Ellen and Arthur. Amy said nothing, but took -hold of Aunt Susy's hand, as if she expected to be led out at once; and Georgie pulled her dress, and pointed to the door. Aunt Susy yielded to the general wish. The children were delighed with her acquiescence. Songs were sung, stories told, and races run, till the hour was nearly gone. All at once, Charley called out, "There's a chaise coming over the hill?"The children ran to the gate. It looks as if it was coming here ;?' said Mary. There's a gentleman in it, all alone," said Charley; "but I do -not know who it is. Do you, Aunt Susy?"Aunt Susy gave one look at the occupant of the carriage, and'then, without saying- a single word, turned from the group, and quickly entered the house. "Why, Aunt Susy! the hour is not up yet!"- called the disappointed children; .and then, as their call remained unheeded, they turned to watch the chaise again.

"I mean Miss"Susan Weldon." "Aunt Susy?" interrogated Charley with a look of sudden intelligoence. "Oh yes 1 Aunt Susy's here. Will you drive in, sir?" and carefully draw- ing Amy aside with one hand, Charley threw open the gate with the other. The gentleman thanked him, and accepted the invitation. !' Is your father at home?" he inquired, as he alighted. "Yes sir," said Charley, please walk in, sir, and I will speak to him." But the stranger said he would wait there; and Charley ran off to find his father. Mr Mel- rose promptly answered to the call. "Ah l good evening, Mr. Berkley," he said, cordial- ly. "I am happy to see you here. Come, walk in. Charley will take care of your horse;" and the stranger entered the cot- tage, leaving the children to wonder what-it all meant. Aunt Susy did not occupy her usual place in the sitting-room, that evening. Charley whispered to Mary that there was a fire: in the parlor stove, and that the astral lamp was burning on the center-table; and Mary hoped Mr. Berkley would not stay long, if Atunt Susy must be kept shut up in the par-  &#xD;<pb n="72-73" xml:id="VAC8259-00000040"/> - 2     HOME SCENES. lor all the time he was there. "How's that, Mary?" said her father. Mary repeated what she had said. Her father laughed. . "I imagine you'll be in no hurry for Mr. Berkley to go away, when he comes again;" he re- marked . "Why, father?" said Mary. But Mr. Melrose only answered "I think so ; and Mary knew that he did not choose to tell  her the reason; so she said no more about it. ..   .. . Four weeks from the day of Mr. Berkley's first visit 'to the home among the hills, a traveling carriage was waiting at the cottage door. Trunks, carpet-bag, umbrella, parasol, bandbox and packages were all safely- bes- towed; and Auit Susy, surrounded by an- eafger group of children, stood taking a last look at the quietilittle room she had tenanted for so many months. Aunt Susy's cheek was pale, d her lip trembled. ,:There were tears in hey eyes, and on her cheek. "It's not use crying about it, I know ;" she said, resolutely brushing away the truant drops; " but some- ' how, it's harder work to say good-bye to yon all here, than I thought it was going to be. One more kiss,i Amy,i dear ; there, don't cry, that's a good child ; Charley, Mary, Arthur, Ellen, Georgie, dear little fellow, be good children, -all of you,"-and Aunt Susy turned from them to grasp the hands of Mr. and Mrss --Melrose. : "May your new home be a happy one,   AUNT SUSY.      78 Aunt Susy ;" said Mr. Melrose. "As happy as ours ;" added his wife. "It will be happy enough, if it is ;" said Aunt Susy. "Come and see how happy it is,;" said Mr. Berkley, smiling. What right had he to say anything o about it'? What was Aunt Susy's new home to him? Here, Arthur!" called Charley, " if you'll hold the gate open, I'll run on and let down the bars at the end of the lane." The car- riage rolled through the gate, and dissap- peared over the hill. Parents and children stood watching it in silence. "And so Aunt Susy's fortune is fulfillled at last ;" said Mrs. Melrose ; as, at her husband's side, she re- turned to the house. It was worth while to wait twenty years for it." "Yes," replied Mr. Melrose-; " but there are few who hEve Aunt Susy's, constancy or Aunt Susy's trust. We shall miss her sadly - here ; but her life-long dream has come true ; and she will be happy.

Mrs. Melrose and Mary were seated, with their sewing in the room usually occupied by the family. Amy, in her little rocking-chair at the oppo- site side of the apartment, folded her doll in her arms, and tried to lull it to sleep with a song. Charley was at work with his father in the field. Ellen had gone to visit -a play- T mate. -Arthur and Georgie were at,play in ' the orchard. So there -was a very quiet time in the pleasant little sitting-room, where the mother and daughter plied their needles most industriously, setting everything in order for the- coming Monday morning.  Mary was usually social enough ;-her tongue sometimes outstripped her needle; but, this- afternoon, she wa's strangely silent. Mrs. Melrose won- dered what- the child could be dreaming about ands at last, after a long silence, she - said,-"What are you thinking of so earnest- tly, Mary?"   * COURTESY-SINCERITY.    75 A' I was thinking," Mary replied, " about the calls we made last evening." "Well, what of them, my child? Mary did not answer immediately ; in fact, she seemed to forget the question entirely; for whfn she did speak, it was to ask," Mother, which is the most polite, Mrs. Carr or Mrs. Edmonds?" "Which Should you think Mary 7" , Why, that's what I've been tryingto find out this long time, mother but Icannot tell what I do think. I want you to help me. "How can I help you tell your thoughts?" said Mrs. Melrose, smiling. "I think you will have to tell me what they are, before I shall know much about them." "Why, mother, I was thinking that people would call Mrs. Carr more polite than MTrs. Edmonds, because she uses a great many more. words ; but I cannot make it seem to me that she is so, after all.. She used so many com- pliments that I hardly knew what to say; and that made me feel very awkward; so that * I did not enjoy the call much. I was all the time afraid that I should not move according to rule, or answer just as I ought. I should not think politeness ought to make any one feel so, mother.' Mrs. Melrose looked a little amused. "Perhaps Mrs. Carr would say it was want of politeness that made you feel so," she re- marked.  "I noticed your enbarassment.  &#xD;<pb n="76-77" xml:id="VAC8259-00000042"/> i  ' , 76     HOMsE SCENES. Mrs. Carr probably thought it the timidity of a school, girl, whohad not yet seen enough of the world to know exactly how to act her part in it." .- "But, mother, I did not feel so with Mrs. Edmonds. I could talk, and move, and act naturally there; for Mrs. Edmonds did% not compliment me enough to, puzzle me at all. I was beginning to feel a little awkward, once, but Mrs. Edmonds brought out those beautiful pictures, and I forgot all about it. The first thing I knew I was talking so fast, that I was frightened when I thought what I was doing. I stopped short, and blushed, -and looked at Mrs. Edmonds to see if she did not think me very rude; but she smiled so pleasantly that I felt quite encouraged again, ' only I did not talk so much afterwards. We had a very pleasant call there, did we not, mother?" "Very ;" replied Mrs. Melrose. "What made it:so pleasant, Mary?" ,", Why"-said Mary, hesitatingly--" in the first place, Mrs. Edmonds seemed glad to see us. Mrs. Carr said she was glad ; but I could not think she was, very. But Mrs. Edmonds looked and spoke as if she was glad; and that made us enjoy being there. And then; she seemed to know just what would please us; and she did not act as if it was hard work to talk with us."  -"Mrs. Edmonds has a very happy power of   COURTESY--SIN CERITY.

She loves to make others happy ; and a little lnowledge of character, with an al- most perfect absence of selfishness, enables her to perform herduty to her visitors in a most pleasing manner." "It seems to- me, mother," said Mary after a pause, " that it is not very easy to be polite, always. It is easy enough when you have company that you like; for you are glad to see them, and it is a pleasure to wait on them, and do' everything you can to make them enjoy their visit ; but when people come that you do not care much about, or that you really dislike, it is hard work, I think it is unpleasant to recieve calls from strangers. I never know what to say to them. If they ask me questions, I say 'Yes,' or ' No ;' and that is the most I can do." "And sometimes you say them in the wrong place," interposed Arthur, who, tired of his play, had seated himself in the door-way to listen to the conversation. "Once, when a lady invited you to come and see her, you said ' No ;' and when another lady told you she was going home, you said ' O yes;' as if you were very- glad of it." Arthur was naturally mischievous. But Mary only smiled, and shook her head at him'#a so he did not gain much by his mischief.

"Those people who say '?es,' and 'No,' and nothing more," she saimriling, " are the very worst-people-in the world to enter- tain. :I can converse with strangers, and en- joy a conversation with them, if they only have ideas to express, and words in which to express them ; but to sit, hour after hour, in- venting questions to be answered in mono- syllables, is hard work for me. : I very much prefer washing, ironing, or baking." "1 think Aunt Susy would be fine help at -such times ;" said Mary, laughing ; " for she always has something to say about everything. And she says things so queerly, too, that I do not see how any one can help laughing at them. How I should like to see her again, mother! It does not seem- as if it could be a whole,year, since she went away." "Aunt Susy is excellent, in that respect," replied Mrs. Melrose. "I remember leaving a party of silent guests in her care, for a few minutes, one day; and when I returned, to take; the burden off her hands, to my surprise, they were all talking. - Aunt Susy looked up with one of her peculiar expressive glances, * as I entered. I think my glance in return, must have- expressed gratitude; for I am sure I felt it." "I think, mother,'? said Mary, " that peo- aple are very often rude in little things. ting.    ' C   COURTESY--SINGERITY,    79 When I went to J,lia Landor's party, last spring, there was one little girl there who was not dressed as well as the rest. Her name was Marion Lee. Julia scarcelvy spoke to her ati all; and I saw her, two or three times in the course of the evening, whisper- ing and laughing with the other girls. I did nt hear what she said- but it was plain enough that she was talling about Marion. I had- never seen the little girl before; but I went and sat down by her, and tried to talk to her a little. When Julia saw what I was doing, she came and invited Marion to go and play with the rest.. But she did not go. She told me that she es very sorry that she, came. - She did not see why Julia invited her, if she did not want her, she said. I never pitied any one so, in my life." "That was more than rude; itwasunfeel- ing and unjust," said Mrs. Melrose. "Guests should always be treated- with civility; but when we invite people to visit us, we are un- der special obligations to make the visit plea- sant to them. I presume Julia did not think of this." "'Mrs. Landoris not polite," Mary replied. "Do you remember one afternoon when we took tea there? There was one old lady at the table, who used her own knife when the butter was passed round. Did you see how Mrs. Landor looked? I was amused and vexed too. But the old lady knew noth-  &#xD;<pb n="80-81" xml:id="VAC8259-00000044"/> 80      HOME SCENES. ing about it. I was very glad she did not." Mrs. Melrose smiled; but said nothing. There was silence for a few minutes, and then Mary resumed the conversation. ' Is it right," she inquired, with sudden seriousness; " is it right to invite people to" visit you when you do not want them?- or to tell them you should be happy to have them stay when you wish they would go? or to say you should be pleased to visit them, when you do not care anything about them?,' "Why, Mary, how can you ask such a question?" said. Mrs. Melrose in surprise. " Almost every one--,does so, mother;"' was, r Mary's unexpected redy. "Only last week-- I heard Mrs. Landor invite a lady to visit her ; and afterwards she said she hoped, she would never come. And Mrs. Carr thanked' a lady very politely for an invitation to vist at her house, and said she should be delight- ed to accept it; ;and then, a few minutes after, she -told another lady she was sure she never meant to go there. Are such things right, mother?" "Certainly jot, my child." '"You never do so, do you, mother?" "No, indeed."' "But,"' said Mary, hesitatingly, "'it must be very awkward, sometimes, not to return an invitation. I have returned them when I did not, really mean what I said, because I:- did not know what else to do. I have been ..

But I have never felt quite right about , it, afterwards, when I/have said what I did not feel," "You can never expect to feel quite right, after doing what your conscience condemns ;" replied Mrs. Melrose. "Strict truthfulness is best, in compliments as well as everything else." "I thought you would say so, mother," said Mary. "But what do you do when peo- ple whom you really do not want come to see you, and invite you to come and see them?" Mrs. Melrose smiled. "There are, hap-, pily, very few such people in our neighbor- hood ;" she observed. "Did you notice what I did when Mrs. Downes called here a week ago?" "You treated her very civilly, mother; but I thought you seemed rather distant. And I remember, too, that when she invited you to call and see her, you only said.' Thank you, Mrs. Downes.' I see now." "What do you see now, Mary?" "A very easy way of telling the truth, mother." "Not so easy as you imagine, Mary. To return a simple 'Thank you,' to an earnest and apparently sincere invitation, requires considerable firmness of purpose, sometimes.

"No, mother, not if you knew you were doing wrong, . But it does seem to me, that there are very few people who tell the truth always."      -  "I fear there are, indeed, very few who are, strictly truthful," said Mrs. Melrose. "Few take a correct view of the subject; and fewer still have moral courage enough to act in accordance with the dictates of their consciences. To be strictly truthful, requires true independence of character. You are naturally rather deficient in: this, Mary; but I hope you will acquire more of it as you grow olde'r.

There are- three windows-one looking tow ards the- east, and half-covered with woodbine and honeysuckle-and two on the south side, open now, to admit the cool breeze. There is a small table between these two windows, near which Mrs. Melrose and Mary are sitting.- Mrs. Melrose must be about forty years of age; but a stranger would sooner call her  thirty. She is not handeome-she never was ;  but she is good and kind, and her loving heart looks out at her dark eyes, and smiles upon her parted lips.

Somehow, it is not easy to describe her. It seems as if she might be one of those people who give you an uncom- fortable feeling when you come near them, -who repel rather than attract you. She is tall, slender, erect, and angular. Her hair is light-brown-her eyes are light-gray-her lips are thin--her forehead is low-her fea- tures are sharp and irregular.

"Very good,"remarked Miss Preston- "so good, that it- is a pity he has not a bet i ter wife." There was no reply. "They say, continued Miss Preston, "that Mrs. Weldon is very passionate, and that-she has not the least control over her children.- I know nothing about it but what I hear."

"Mrs. Melrqse does love to be on the contrary side in everything," said Miss Pres- ton. "I have scarcely said anything the whole afternoon, that she has not, in some way opposed."

AND who was the Alice Lane of whom Miss Preston and Mrs. Melrose had spoken -thezone so scornfully-the other so pity- ingly? Alice was the only daughter of a gentle and pious mother, who, just beforeshe died, called the little one of four years old to her bedside, and placing her wasted hand upon that bright young, head, prayed God to bless and tokeep her child. Did not God hear that prayer? Most ,surely he heard it, and most surely did he answer it, in his own good time,  - Mr. Lane, the father of Alice, was stern, haughty and passionate. Yet beloved his child: and Alice though she shrank from him in his darker moods, poured out all the warmth of her young heart in return for an occasional word of endearment, or token of affection'. He was all she had to love. 'And what if he was sometimes harsh Or hasty? He was her father, and she loved him still.  &#xD;<pb n="98-99" xml:id="VAC8259-00000054"/> 98      HOME SCENES. It was easy to forget and forgive, for her. Her mother, too-and the thought of that- dear mother often brought the warm tears to Ally's bright blue eyes-her mother had loved him tenderly. Grief at her death might have shadowed his dark spirit still more deeply. Butshewas sure he loved her. He could not live without her love. Poor Ally! As she grew to womanhood,'her home seemed more dark and lonely, year by year. She had no companions of her own age; for it was her father's pleasure to live in seclu- sion, almost in solitude. It seemed to her he grew sterner and harsher day by day.- She was beautiful, and he was proud of her beauty. - She was gifted;, and he encouraged and delighted in the improvement of her ta- lents. But he forgot-perchance he did not; know-that, in shutting her out from the J world, in depriving her of social intercourse and kindly affection, he was committing an error that could never be repaired. The plant needs not-only the air, and the dew, but thewarm, golden sunlight. Thehuman heart needs not only knowledge, but sympathy and love. Alice did not find these in her lonely home. Was it strange,-that, when temptation came-when her heart seemed to have won the treasure for which it had unconsciously yearned so long--was it strange, that, natur- ally affectionate and confiding; she yielded -trusted-and was betrayed? . 1. *. ' '   THE OUTCAST.      99 It is well that God can forgive those who err as Alice erred ; for the world has little pity for them. Even the hearts that shduld seek to shelter and to heal, sometimes, turn coldly from them. Alas for the fallen;!- A curse from heaven may rest upon the betray- er; but the bitter scorn of earth is thrown, with its icy coldness, its crushing weight, on the torn andbleedif:g heart of the betrayed. God is great.  God is just. "There will come an end to all things; and then all -wh be well."             * Irritated almost to frenzy by the disgrace which Alice had brought upon herself and him, her father closed his doors against his child. She stood, alone, before the broad, smooth door-stone, on which she had: played in her happy childhood, so -many, many-times -beneath the shadebof the old elms, that had drooped mournfully over- her mother's cof- fin she stood, and looked up to the soft, sweet stars, that seemed to- look down upon- her from their home of purity, with eyes of pity and love.

X But whither could she go? She knew not she cared not. There was no aim, no pur- pose in her heart, as she turned slowly and calmly away from her father's door. Through the openigate, and down the green hill-side she -passed, with firm and fearless tread, though the evening shadows were deepening arOund her, and the dew rested-heavily upon the grass beneath her feet. What have they to fear, who have' no hope? Onward, on- ward,--no matter whither,--anywhere,-away from what was once her home. Unconscious- ly, she turned aside into a little bye-path,- a path down which she had often bounded in her happy, innocent childhood,-a path that led, by a dim, winding course, into a small grove. A brook, crossed by a narrow foot- bridge, ran through the grove. Alice paused, as she stepped lightly upon thelittle bridge; and, for the first time, a definite idea--almost a purpose, entered her mind. Did not the brook grow wider -and deeper, a little further on? And -was there not, a little .further' still, a dark, silent pool, where -the waters seemed to reach far, far down,--untroubled, -hidden? Might there not be rest for the weary beneath their glassy surface? For   THE OUTCAST.     101 one moment she paused, she shuddered. Then she looked up at the soft, pitying stars ; and thought of the mother whose eyes might, like them, be looking down upon her child,; and passed on. The temptation had lost its power. A new thought-a hope-a purpose, -was in her heart, as she passed on through the still grove, with hands clasped upon her bosom and lips moving in voiceless, wordless prayer-the prayer of unfathomed agony. The village clock in the distance was striking nine, as Lucy Evans, after smoothing the pillow for- the head of her aged and in- firm-mother, turned to the window - of her humble cottage home, and drew aside the curtain, to look out at the cloudless sky. No' one, who had looked into the plain, unex- pressive face of Lucy Evans, in -her sober, work-day moods, would have imagined, even for-a moment, that she could be a dreamer. And yet-so it was. That pale face,tas it was upturned to the-sky, was glowing, almost beautiful-with admiring -wonder. The beaming eye-the parted lips--the glowing cheek--all: told of a heart filled with the idea of sublimity and beauty. Many such a heart beats beneath the coarse raiment that covers a form bending to its, daily toil, and refreshed at'night, in the sleep of weariness, by dreams; bright, blessed, glorious dreams C But to-night, Lucy's dreams were of brief du- ration.

Come in, out ofthe night- air and the dew, and tell mewhat hasbrought you here."  Alice sank down in the, chair offered by her humble friend, and buried her face inher hands, "Ally, dear Ally 1" said Lucy, alarm- ed at her wild manner and disordered dress, "wht hat s happened you? And how came you to:be away from home, so late, alone " Alice raised her head, and, looking steadi- ly into' Lucy's face, said, in a low, calm tone, -"I havec no home, Lucy."  "No home ti" echoed Lucy, in amazement. -"No home," repeated Alice, firmly. "My father," and her voice faltered for a moment , but became calm again as she went on-"My father closed his doors against me this even- ing, forever."  ; -    .-  Lucy drew a chair directly in front of that in which Alice was, seated; and the convul- sivelyclasped hands of the girl in her own, as she seated herself before her, said, in a low, gentle tone: "Alice, I carried you in my ;     ;     .*       I ' *    THE OUTCAST.     103 arms when you were a little infant.

My poor, poor child!" she added, folding the silent girl affection- ately in her arms, and Alice wept, as she had  not wept before,-tears that seemed to relieve her aching heart of half its sorrow. Lucy would not hear another word that night. "Rest, rest;," she said-to-morrow you may tell me all." And her-own head did not press its- pillow, till Alice.- like a wearied child, had had sob-aedherself to sleep.

"Thank God thank God!" murmured the wretched mother, as she closed the deep blue ey-es, and folded the tiny hands, and pressed her lips on the brow, the cheek, the lips;- they smiled on her still--of her innocent babe. "Thank God l"' Those were the only words she uttered. Her heart sank, from that hour, in the hopelessness of utter deso- lation.

"Calm-peaceful-thankful," were the only words uttered, but the look which accompa- nied them was eloquent with humble, trust- ing faith. Mrs. Melrose sat beside her, while the evening deepened into night. There -was no apparent pain, but a gradual sinking -so gradual as to be scarcely perceptible-- and so calm and gentle, that Lucy Evans af- terwards said it seemed to --her mpre like a tired child going to sleep, than like the ap- proach of death.

The door opened slowly, and a tall, dark-browed -man entered, and advan- ced, with slow, measured tread, to the beds side of the dying one. He stood, and gazed upon her in silence. His bosom heaved-his lips quivered--his cheek grew ghastly white. "Alice," he said, in a deep, yet gentle tone, "Alice." Once more those blue eyes opened--those pale lips parted with a faint, sweet smile, whispering the word, "Father." "Alice, my child," and the stern, proud man folded his daughter to his bosom, and pressed his lips fervently, passionately, to her cold-brow.

So must any one have thought, who looked in-upon the -circle gathered  around the hearth of that happy cottage home, ere the snows of another Winter had begun to fall. They were all there; but one of their number was passing away--fa- ding, day by day, like the rich-hued autumn leaf, more beautiful than ever in its- gorgeus mantle of decay. Amy--the "dear little 'home missionary," as Charley had lovingly called her, was closing her brief, bright mis- sion upon earth. Her gentle spirit was fold- ing -its dove-pinions here, to be outspread again-oh! how joyfully, in the pure atmos- phere, of the sinless land. Dear, as she had ever been to them-for her very helplessness had drawn her more closely to their hearts, till love for her seemed inwoven with every fibre of their existence-they felt, as they O'   A LOVED ONE CALLED HOME.   115 looked upon her gradual decline, that-they had never loved her before as they loved her now. Week by week, month by month, they had watched the slowly, surely advancing shade of death. They knew, from the first, that it- must fall darkly around- them, but now it seemed so very near, that they involuntarily shrank, shuddering, from the thought. Yet every hour brought that shadow nearer ; and their eyes were dim and their hearts faint, as they saw the hectic flush on the wasted cheek, and felt the quick throbbings of the loving heart, so soon to be "hushed and motionless for ever." It was late in Autumn. Mrs. Melrose had been alone with Amy through the afternoon, and, for the first time, impelled by that strange sense of duty which every Christian :mother, under similar circumstances, must feel, she had spoken to the child of death. She was not prepared for her reply. "I knew it long ago, dear mother," she said, as she twined her slender arms more closely around her mother's' neck. "1 knew lit long ago, -and if it were not for you, dear mother, and father, Iand all the rest, I should be very glad. You have - thought, sometimes, when, I have been better for a day or two, that I might be well again, but I knew that I should not. I1 feel better to-day than I have for a long time.

"'You must not think I have been unhappy, mother, ,  because I have been blind," she said. "' i have been very happy, because you have been so kind to me. I have wanted to see things that they said were beautiful, sometimes. I have tried to think how the stars looked, and the flowers, and the seathat we hear so- often. But I have wanted to see your face, mother, and father's, more than anything else.- Do you remember, mother, one day  when I was sober, thinking that I could not see, and could not learn anything, as Charley, and Mary, and the other children could, what you told me? You said thatsome children could neither see, nor hear, nor speak, and I thought how pleasant it was to hear and speak, if I could not see. Why, mother, you know I can -tell every one who comes in, by their step, or their voice, and I can talk, and sing too. I thought of all this, and itseemed as if it would be wrong to -be unhappy, be- cause I could not see. I have not been, since, mother." Amy paused again. Mrs. Melrose did not speak. After a little while, Amy went on. "!Every one has been very kind to me,+and T have /been very happy. But I think it is better for me to die, -mother.'- You could not always take, care of me, as you have -done, and I could not take of myself. I was think-   A LOVED ONE CA TILED HOME. 117 ing of that, and a great many other things, last night. I -was not in any pain, but I could not sleep, and so I lay and thought. It seemed as if my life had been a long, dark night, but I thought the morning was coming, and I knew it would be all light then. You told me, mother, that I should see in heaven, and I shall go to heaven whien I die. One thing troubled me, at' first. I thought I should not know, when you caame there, be- cause I had never seen you here, But then I remembered that I had heard your voice, and I knew I should not forget it, if I did not hear it again for a long time; and I thought--it was a strange thought, was it not, mother?-that when any one came, I should shut my eyes and listen; and the voice and the step would tell me if it was any one I knew, and at last I went to- sleep, and dreamed of Heaven. It was a pleasant dream, mother, but I cannot tell it to you-- I have no -words."  The child was silent again, and leaned her head upon her mother's shoulder. "Are you not talking too much, Amy, dear?" said Mrs. Melrose, tenderly. "No, mother," Amy replied, "I was thinking. How long do you suppose I shall live?"' "Not many days, my child," said the moth- er ; and her voice faltered, in spite of her ef- -fort to speak firmly.  &#xD;<pb n="118-119" xml:id="VAC8259-00000065"/> "8   ,  HOME, SCENES. !"When I am dead," said Amy, and her low -voice seemed sadly, thrillingly sweet-- " when I :am dead, mother, will you give Charley, and Mary, and, Ellen, and A'rthur, and Georgie, each a lock of my hair? And take one for you and father. I know you will not forget me, but I want to give you something that will seem like me, and that will, more than anything else ; will it not, mother?"'  Mrs. Melrose felt that herr voicew, ould fail if she tried to answer. -She passed her hand silently over the soft brown hair, and kissed the wan, wasted. cheek, and Amy smiled, as she lay languidly in her mother's bosom. "Do I tire you, mother?" "No, darling," was the whispered reply. - Amy was asleep when her 'father came in from his work, that night. Her cheek was flushed, and her pulses throbbed with fevered quickness. Mr. Melrose bent over her, and took her thin, hot hand in his own. ' She is not as well, to-night," he said, in a low tone, to hiswife. She shook her head without speak- -An hour passed. The clock was striking eight as Amy awoke. "Is father hlere,' was her first inquiry.   - :' Mr. Melrose was at her side in a moment. '",Do you want anything, my child?' he said, tentoherry.  "I should like to have you carry wff a lit-   A LOVED ONE CALLED -HOME.  19 fte while, father, I cannot breathe very well," answered the child. Mr. Melrose gently lifted her upon a pillow, and walked the room with her in his arms. After a. little while she said, ' Please let Charley take me now, father, you are tired." The clock struck nine. "I think I can lie on the sofa now, while father reads and prays," whispered Amy to her brother. Mary arranged- the pillow, and-Mrs. Melrose seated herself beside the suffering child. "Shall we sing to-night, Amy?" said Mr. Melrose, as he closed the Bible. "Will it not disturb you?" ' "' Oh, no, father, I can sing with you, Amy replied. And among the faltering voices that blended in the evening hymn, rose one, clear and sweet, singing, as the blest in the better land might sing, of rest in heaven. They knelt in prayer, and fervently rose the peti- tion for strength to endure affliction, for faith to triumph when the hour of trial should- come. That hour was nearer even than they thought. For some time Amy had lain upon the. sofa in the sitting-room during the day, and slept in an adjoining bed-room at night. But this evening, she said-the air in -the bed-room seemed close, and expressed a wish to pass the night in the sitting-room. Her request was granted. Charles and AMary sat up with her till midnight. Then her father and mother  &#xD;<pb n="120-121" xml:id="VAC8259-00000066"/> -120.-    HOME SCENES. took their places. Amy was very restless' through the night. Once or twice her mind seemed wandering. "Did I bid them all 'good night," she inquired anxiously, just as the gray light of dawn began to make the lamp burn dim and pale. "I thought I for- got to kiss brother Charley." "It is morning now, my child," said Mrs. Melrose, soothingly. "Try to rest." "You do not breathe freely, Amy dear," said her father. l"Shall I carry you?"  "Yes, father,' was the reply; but at his second turn around the room, she said; "Please lay me on the sofa again, father. I think I can sleep now.'-   , Her father conplied with her request. She could not breathe. Her mother raised her,  and pillowed her head upon her bosom. "Do you lie easily, Amy?" she said.  "Ye, mother," whispered Amy. - I am - going to sleep now. Father, kiss me once--  mother, good night." A change came over her pale face as she spoke. She laid her head back, gently, and-closed her eyes. The mother placed her hand upon the heart of her child. It throbbed-more faintly--it was still. Mr. Melrose raised the white curtain. The first rays of the rising sun threw a rich light over the pale face of the sleeper. A brighter morning had dawned for her.   A LOVED ONE CALLED HOME.   121 Very beautiful was that you -gead, as it lay, pillowed for its last rest, like a pale, sweet bud of Autumn, over which the storm- blast had passed but lightly, destroying its life, but leaving its loveliness unchanged. Tears and blessings fell mingled upon that calm brow ; and burning kisses were pressed upon those still, cold lips, that never before refused an answer to their love. The smile had passed from then when she fell asleep, but deep, holy peace looked from every fea- ture of that pale face ; and even little Geor- gie's sobs were hushed, as he gazed upon it in childish wonder and childish awe. Char- ley gently put aside the brown hair from the -white forehead, and kissed tenderly a slight scar that had lain, concealed beneath those bright locks. His mother alone saw the act. it needed no explanation to her. The family stood, for a little while, around the hushed sleeper, gazing upon her loved face, and weeping. Then Mr. Melrose slowly closed the coffin-lid, saying, in a clear, calm voice, "Our blest little Amy is in heaven. We will try to live so as to meet her there." And silently and tearfully, one by one, they glided from the room.  &#xD;<pb n="122 (Illustration) " xml:id="VAC8259-00000067"/> ;' ;   A PTR XII.            i A-DVERSITYI IT is hard for a man who has toiled through thebest years of his life 'to acquire a com- petence for himsElf and-those whom he loves, who has met, unshrinkingly, the summer sun and the'wintry blast,' cheered by-thei thought:ofl a comfortable and peaceful .shel- ter- a home for his, declining - years-it is hard for such a man, when the silvery-hairs of age are beginning to gleam among he dark locks onehis brow, to see lthe earenings of ltong yeai;s of industriouse laborm ' swept away, at a single, blast;--gone- like 'the bubble melting into air-leaving him to sink in hopedlessnegs, beneaththhe blow,:or nerved by:-; despair;- fto begih anew his  ba'ttle: with the world s Such was the:lot tof Mri:Melvrose.- By persevering industry arid strict economy, Mr. and Mrs. Melrose had been able, not only to feed, clothe and educate their child- ren, comfortably and respectably, thus far, but to lay aside, yearly, a small sum to meet th .eld Suhwsoimo o    r+ers   -"Our little Amny is in heated "  &#xD;<pb n="-123" xml:id="VAC8259-00000068"/>      ADVERSITY.      123 the -demands of any future day ofneed. They were not wealthy, but :they. were no longer poor. Mr. Melrose had already- begun: to think and speak of giving up the care ana toil of his station, in. a few -years, to his youngest son, who, true to his early purpose, wished for no higher place than, that which his father had filled; when an unlooked-for event completely changed, for a time, the current of affairs. An early friend of Mr. Melrose, reduced by illness and misfortune to want, applied to him for pecuniary assistance. Mr. Melrose generously, perhaps imprudently, gave the required aid, and a note, which, without his endorsement would have been considered worthless, relieved his friend, for the time, from his embarrassment. Months passed; and the sudden death of that friend, a short time before the note became due, aroused Mr. Melrose to a startling consciousness of bis situation. The property of the deceased was not sufficient to satisfy a tenth part of the demand upon it. The note endorsed by Mr. Melrose was- presented to him for pay- ment. The sum was not large-a few hun- dreds only-but it came at a time when pay- ment was impossible. Recent loans and ex- penditures had left the family treasury, for the time, empty. Mr. Melrose felt the blow keenly, but he met it like a man. His chief anxiety was  &#xD;<pb n="124-125" xml:id="VAC8259-00000069"/> 124     HOME SCENES. for his children. Charles half way through his collegiate course; Mary had but just left; home to spend a year at a female seminary ; and the other children were looking eagerly forward to the time when their ages and at- tainments would entitle them to higher and more extended advantages than they had yet enjoyed, The disappointment would be a bitter one to them all. Must they be disap- pointed?  The first step taken by Mr. Melrose was to consult his wife. -Mrs. Melrose had seen I -the shadow upon- her husband's brow, and seemed rather relieved than otherwise, by learning its cause. "Is that all?" she said, smiling, as he finished the recital of his mis-- fortunes.  "All!" repeated Mr. Melrose almost bit- terly, " is it not enough?" "Certainly, my dear husband," replied Mrs. Melrose, affectionately. "But it is nothing to what it might be. Is there no way of meeting the demand?" "None, that I know of. I see no way of raising the amount, except by sale or mort- gage. Even if we had the money with which we fitted out the children, a few weeks ago, it would not half cover the debt." "Must the note be paid immediately? Would not Mr. Blake allow you to renew it, or wait, at least, for a few months? He is rich, and does not need the money."   ADVERSITY.      125 Mr. Melrose shook his head. "Mr. Blake is rich," he said; "But he Is avaricious- miserly. I shall ask no favors from him." "Could you not borrow the money?" "Not without giving good security for it, and, in fact, I do not wish to borrow it. aI should feel very mean,running round, trying to borrow money. Besides, I know of no one who would be likely to lend it to me." "What will you do then?" inquired Mrs. Melrose. "I was thinking," replied her husband- and he spoke with hesitation, as if the thought was an unpleasant one, "I was thinking of mortgaging our little place here, for a few years. I might raise the money in that way, and I could redeem the homestead before the nmortgage: was out--or lose it." Mrs. Melrose sighed. "Would you mort- gage it to Mr. Blake?" she inquired. "No," replied Mr. Melrose with energy. "No. I should not like to give him a grasp on my home. I thought of trying Farmer Norton.' If he has the money, I do not doubt he will advance it for me." Mrs. Melrose thought-for a few minutes, and then said, quietly, "It may be the best way. But the place is worth much more than the sum due." "It is worth double,' said Mr. Melrose. "I was thinking," he added, after a brief pause, " of the children. What with thin  &#xD;<pb n="126-127" xml:id="VAC8259-00000070"/> 126 a  .

Indeed, I do not think it would be right. Our money is not ours till this debt is paid. It belongs to our credi- tors, And, besides, Hthink the children would be pained by the discovery, at some future time, of what might seem like want of confidence in them. I think they ought to know the whole." "But what will they do,"' said Mr. Mel- rose, despondingly. "It will be a, great dis- - appointment to them both." "Not so very great, perhaps, after all," answered th e hopeful-hearted wife. "Char- ley will go right on-only he will' depend upon himself instead of you. It maybe the very best thing in. the world for him. Mary will have to defer the completion of her studies for a year or two, till we can help' her, or-till she can find some way. In a few  years the debt will be paid-the mortgage will be cleared off-and we shall be rich as ever.'   ADVERSITY.     '127 Mrs. Melrose smiled,' and her husband smiled also. It was next to impossible not to reflect the sunshine of her face. "As rich as ever," repeated Mr. Melrose,'" only a lit- tle older, and perhaps," he added, playfully, "a little wiser also. Tell me now, truly, Mary, do you not think I have been very im- prudent?"             a "In one sense of the word, yes; in- an- other, no ;" replied Mrs. Melrose, smiling a second time. "The world would call you imprudent, no doubt, for-paying the debts of a man who would, in all probability, never be able to pay you, but- I would not give much for a friend who would not help me when I wanted- help." "Thank you, a thousand times, Mary. You do not know what a weight you have takea off my heart. Now I will go and see Farmer Norton."'  Farmer Norton had already numbered three-score years and ten, but his heart seem- ed to grow younger every year. There are very few such hearts in the world ; it is apity that there were not more of them. Farmer Norton had the money on hand, and he did not hesitate to advance it. "Only be sure and make the time long enough so that you will be certain to pay the mortgage," he said smiling, "-for I'm- sure I don't want your homestead for half its value." The mortgage was given for three years-  &#xD;<pb n="128-129" xml:id="VAC8259-00000071"/> 128     HOME SCENES.  ; themoldney:paid--and next thing was to write  to. the-absent: children.

A feeling of dependence fosters weakness. Self-reliance gives strength and stability to the mind. Charles Melrose felt this, as he sat thoughtfully in his room, after penning the reply to his mother'sletter. During the last few hours; he seemed to have grown old- er by many years. The boyish feeling was gone. He was a man now. The path that had lain so smooth and plain before him, was  hedged up all at once, and he must remove the barrier by his own unaided efforts. But how?

There were still three years of redemption, but the time seemed very short, and Mr. Melrose looked' forward with a saddened spirit, to the day when the few acres that his hands had tilled so long, might become a part of the extended fields of his more wealthy neighbor. Mr. Melrose had been peculiarly unfortunate for several years. Unfavorable seasons and scanty crops on the farm--sickness in the family--loss upon loss from the dishonesty or misfortunes of others -all combined to baffle his efforts and re- press his energy. ' It is of no use," he said despondingly, at the end of .the third year. "The place must go ; we may as well give it up first as last." - -"Why, father," answered Ellen cheerfully, "there are three long years yet. I shall earn enough, and more than enough to pay the interest yearly, and next year Mary will be able to help us again. And perhaps Char- ley can do something too. The debt is more than half paid, now. It will all be paid be- fore the time is out." Mr. Melrose shook his head, but made no reply. "I have no doubt we shall be able to clear off the mortgage, if we are blessed with health," remarked Mrs. Melrose. ' At any rate, we will try not to be anxious about it.

"No, Nelly," he replied, tenderly, after a moment's silence. "No, Nelly, I could not leave you as easily, but I cannot stay here always, and it will be as easy going now as any time. Besides, I ought to be. doing my share towards paying this paltry debt that is threatening to eat us out of house and home. It vexes me every time I think of it.

And letters--oh I how ' welcome! went forth in -return; bearing greetings and tidings of home to the wan- derers. Sometimes Ellen wrote, sometimes  George, sometimes father, and sometimes  (her letters were dearer than any of the rest,)  mother's own hand-writing greeted the eyes  and gladdened the hearts of the fondly-re-  . membered children. People who sit down  r with pen, ink and paper before them, and'  think for long hours what to write, can have  no idea how easily those letters were writ-  -ten, and how delightedly they were read. There was no study about them,-there was  no attempt at choice phraseology and grace-  fully rounded periods. They came straight  from the hearts of the writers, and they  went, for that -very reason, straight to the  hearts of the. readers, also. Ellen's letters  were often a simple journal, written fromI day to day; and detailing, anything and eve-  rything that would be likely to interest   r a her absent brothers and sister. Home--    ;' the green hill-side-the orchard trees-   '! the cottage-roof--the fireside group-all these rose to Mary's view, as she read those j simple records of the daily life of the loved - ; ones whose. voices her full heart yearned to hear again.

We cannot, of course, give ex- tracts from all; we have neither time nor space for that, but the extracts given will be such as to show the character and aim of the correspondence. First comes a portion of a letter from Arthur. We give this for two reasons . first, because the boy's spirit breathes from every'line of it; and secondly, because it contains ao sketch of an old friend, whom it may be pleasant to all to hear from again : "Since I wrote last, I, like other distin- guished travelers, have visited the White Mountains. But I shall not describe them to you. Why? Because it is impossible, without descriptive. powers of a much higher order than mine, to give you the faintest idea of them.

If I were half as good' as Aunt Susy, with all her peculiarities--I should be-a, great deal better than I am now. She seems very happy in her family cares and duties.
