               <head>CHAPTER I.</head>
               <p>DORA GRAFTON was one of those whose greatest happiness consisted in helping others bear their burden through life; but who seemed destined herself to glide o'er the rough places as if aided by angel wings. To her "each cloud had a silver lining," and if a few pearly drops descended upon her, it only made her heart the happier to enjoy the sunshine.</p>
               <p>At the time we shall introduce Dora to the reader, she was just entering her sixteenth year. She and an older brother were the only children who had ever gladdened the hearts of their fond parents. It had been the study of those parents to bring their offspring up, so that they should become useful as well as ornamental members of society.</p>
               <p>The family were sitting round their cheerful fireside<pb n="6-7" xml:id="VAC6293-00000004"/> side, one bright, starry evening in the month of January, it was the eve before Dora's birth day, and all were busily engaged in talking over the anticipated party, that was to celebrate her sixteenth birth night.</p>
               <p>Mr. Grafton sat in his large easy chair, his feet resting upon the grate, while his gaze was fixed upon his lovely daughter; she had been playing a favorite piece for him, but had, after receiving her father's approbation, turned from the instrument, and sat carelessly leaning her snowy arm upon her brother's shoulder, and occasionally toying her fingers among the dark locks that shaded his manly brow. Her beauty was not of a cast that we may look upon every day, it consisted greatly in expression. Her hair was always allowed to fall in graceful ringlets over her shoulders, and her eyes gave to her whole countenance a beautiful expression. Her complexion was rather pale than otherwise, except when a rosy tinge mantled her cheek caused by excitement. She was a lovely being to look upon, and the delight of the family circle. The words of the poet would well apply to her: <q>

                        <l>Nor one that was of earth, who wore</l>
                        <l>The look of heaven upon her face.</l>

                        <l rend="ti-1">I never knew a heart so kind,</l>

                        <l rend="ti-1">Nor saw a hand so gladly bind</l>
                        <l>The crushed and bleeding heart of woe.</l>

                     <lg type="stanza">
                        <l>Her spirit was from sin so free,</l>

                        <l>That all who knew her purity,</l>
                        <l rend="ti-1">Poured blessings on her bright young head.</l>

               <p>As Dora sat some time in silence, her mother quietly looked up from her sewing, and enquired what it was that so occupied her mind? Her answer was unlike what many young girls of her age would have been, that she was thinking of what dress she would wear on the next eve and how it would become her; but she replied "I was thinking of Hermione Phelps; she told me this morning she hoped I would excuse her from being present to-morrow evening, as many of her former acquaintances had treated her with such marked indifference since her father's failure and death, that she felt little disposed to mingle in society."</p>
               <p>"I hope you urged her to attend;" said Mrs. Grafton. "I have always regarded Hermione as a<pb n="8-9" xml:id="VAC6293-00000005"/> young lady of superior merit, and though she is your senior by two years or more, I should encourage your acquaintance with her. And if she is willing to use the talents God has given her, to enable her widowed mother to bestow those advantages of education which she has enjoyed, upon her younger brothers and sisters, it is praiseworthy in her; what if she has been reared in the lap of luxury, and unaccustomed to toil, be assured my daughter, whoever would slight her because <emph>circumstances</emph> may have thrown her upon her own exertions, is unworthy your acquaintance."</p>
               <p>"I finally persuaded her to say that she would come, though I think she did so, more to gratify me than herself," replied Dora.</p>
               <p>"I heard a flying report to-day," said Fred, "that Frank Landon, whom every one supposed engaged to her, had left her since they have met with misfortune."</p>
               <p>"That may be the reason in part, why she is so very unwilling to mix in society; but Hermione is one who would not confide her heart's secrets even to her nearest friends," said Dora; "but do you suppose mother that he could have been actuated by so mean a motive, as the loss of money?"</p>
               <p>"I am wholly unable to judge my child, as I am unacquainted with the young man, and ignorant what his motive of action might have been; but Hermione is not a person to allow her heart to break for one, whose only object in seeking her hand was for the wealth she might possess, and who should throw back her love, as soon as the wealth which had attracted him, had taken wing. Her nature is such that however deep might have been her love for him, if this were his motive, she could but regard it with the contempt it rightly merited."</p>
               <p>The conversation was here interrupted by the entrance of an acquaintance of Mr. Grafton. The stranger seemed delighted with the playing and singing of Dora; not so much for the skill of her playing, (though she was a fine pianist,) as for the real pleasure it seemed to afford her, to be able to gratify others. She made no excuse when requested to take a seat at the instrument, and performed those pieces that she thought would be most pleasing to their guest. Her brother stood beside her to turn over her music, and accompanied her in several pieces with his rich and deep toned voice; he was never happier than when in the society of his affectionate sister.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER II.</head>
               <p>"DO let me place this jewel among your curls Dora; your uncle would feel disappointed that his gift should be slighted on your birth night."</p>
               <p>This was said by Hermione, as Dora and herself were preparing their toilet, before they descended to the drawing room, to welcome the guests who were to assemble to celebrate Dora's sixteenth birth night. They were almost inseparable companions; Hermione, with her noble nature, and Dora, with all the sunshine and affection of disposition, that good fairies might bestow.</p>
               <p>"No, dear Hermie, I cannot consent to it; look at your own simple attire, only one white rose bud in your raven locks. <emph>You,</emph> darling do not need ornaments, to make you look beautiful, I never saw you look half so lovely when you were dressed, (and then she checked herself for fear that she had touched a tender chord, by alluding to her mourning robes, that would vibrate and sadden her for the evening.) So she continued, playfully, you know poor <emph>I,</emph> would not be improved by glittering jewels. As she said this, she threw her arms about her friend's neck and kissed away a tear."</p>
               <p>They were now both attired for the evening. Dora wore a pearl colored silk; her hair allowed to fall partially over her finely moulded neck and shoulders, in natural ringlets, while it was caught up on one side, by a simple silver dart, and on the other, with a beautiful white japonica. She wore no other jewels, but a neat gold necklace, with a locket attached, which contained her father's hair, and which she always wore. Hermione's tall and commanding figure was arrayed in sable robes—her hair put back in glossy bands, a white rose bud merely for a head dress; her only ornament, a beautiful bracelet of her father's hair, which she valued above all things.</p>
               <p>They stood conversing together longer than they thought for, and were surprised by Fred's tap upon the door, which reminded them that they were infringing upon their time. Dora looked more lovely than usual; the excitement had lent an unusual tinge to her<pb n="12-13" xml:id="VAC6293-00000007"/> cheeks; she moved about among the guests in her quiet manner, shedding sunshine around her, and each face wore a smile when she came near.</p>
               <p>Hermione's face was as cold and marble-like as a statue; she returned the salutations of those present with dignity, but scarcely a smile lit up her countenance during the evening.</p>
               <p>When Frank Landon was announced, every eye was turned upon him, he was not so very beautiful in feature, but his general appearance was quite fascinating, and he was greatly admired by many; he received the appellation of a "splendid young man."</p>
               <p>Dora received him pleasantly, though any one possessed of less self esteem than he, would have noticed a slight tinge of coldness in her greeting; for there was so much frankness in her disposition, that she could not disguise her true feelings towards him. No one could judge of the feelings entertained by Hermione towards him; her countenance wore no more sadness or joy when he was near; she treated him with the same quiet dignity that she did others. But he seemed ill at ease in her presence, he appeared like one whose "guilty conscience needed no accuser."</p>
               <p>Among the young people gathered together, was a young man by the name of Henry Adams, he was a particular friend of Fred's, and was generally esteemed among his associates, as a person remarkable for his uprightness and honesty of purpose.</p>
               <p>Dora was busily engaged in examining a simple wild flower that had fallen from a vase near her, when she was addressed by the young man to whom we have just alluded.</p>
               <p>"What is it that so occupies your attention just now Miss Grafton?" said he.</p>
               <p>"Nothing but a pretty wild flower, that has just fallen from the bouquet near us; the flowers were sent to me from a dear friend who resides in the country. I prize them for the giver's sake, and because there is not a single exotic among them; they are all wild flowers culled by my friend's own hands, from the woods and meadows. This one I hold, was the only one of its kind in the bouquet, and I considered it far too beautiful not to receive cultivation; I knew that my kind old gardener would bestow every attention upon it. And if it should thrive, its blossoms would remind me of my friend."</p>
               <p>It may seem strange to some, that one so full of joy and animation as Dora, should, on her birth night,<pb n="14-15" xml:id="VAC6293-00000008"/> surrounded, as she was, by her young companions, think of preserving a simple, wild flower; but though she was fond of society, still she was a child of nature, and would have much preferred a rustic, to a city life. She was never happier than when permitted to visit her friends in the country, where she could take her hat and basket, and ramble over the fields, and return laden with her floral treasures, her cheeks flushed by her healthful recreation.</p>
               <p>The young man with whom she was conversing, regarded her in silence for a moment, and then said:</p>
               <p>"Your conversation, Miss Grafton, has reminded me of a recent event that has occurred in our family; a much loved sister of my mother's has just been called to her home in heaven, her husband having gone before her some two years; they have left behind a lovely daughter not far from your age, she will now take up her abode with us. She has always resided in the country, and is remarkable for her intellect, and simplicity of manners. She is indeed a sweet <emph>wild flower,</emph> as pure in thought and action as the flower you have been admiring."</p>
               <p>"Poor girl! then she is an orphan," said Dora.</p>
               <p>"She is, and if I may take a few moments of your time, which I know is precious to all your guests, just now, I would like to give you a brief description of her character. Her father was a clergyman, and a nobler soul ne'er left the world than he; his wife my mother's only sister) a meek-eyed, gentle creature, looked upon him with feelings akin to idolatry. Their only daughter, my cousin Alice, possesses her mother's gentleness, and her father's intellect and soul. You may think it strange that if he were so gifted by nature, that he filled a country pulpit through life; he received repeated calls to fill some of our most popular city pulpits, for his manner was so fascinating, that he drew crowds from a distance to listen to his preaching, and he was acknowledged by all who heard him to possess superior talent. But his disposition was such that he could not bear the restraint of a city life. His views of a christain minister were such as not to allow him to go every Sabbath into a church, built of the most costly materials, and finished in the most elaborate style, while many of its contributors perhaps, could ill afford to pay the sum required for its erection, but had an unwillingness that <emph>their</emph> church should be inferior to any other. He felt that to stand in such a pulpit, and preach to<pb n="16-17" xml:id="VAC6293-00000009"/> his people, of the meek and humble Jesus who went about doing good, but had not where to lay his head, would be hypocritical, and unworthy a follower of Christ. Could he stand before them dressed in the finest broadcloth, made in the most modern style, and exhort them to forsake the vanities of the world; or to encourage them to acts of benevolence when he knew in his heart, that many of his hearers spent so much for splendid clothing, in order to have their families dress as finely as the occupants of some neighboring pew, that the portion of their substance left for charitable purposes was very small. Besides, he felt that a country home, a frugal table and the pure air of the country were more conducive to a sound physical and mental state. Alice resembles her father in many respects, yet she possesses enough of her mother's gentleness, to render her entirely free from anything that might appear masculine. 'Perhaps Miss Grafton I am trespassing upon your time, but I trust you will pardon me, for I hope soon to introduce to you, my cousin; I feel almost a brother's regard for her and wished to give you a slight idea of her, feeling assured that you will find in Alice a congenial companion.'"</p>
               <p>"I feel interested in her already, from what you have said, and shall take an early opportunity of calling, when she comes to make it her home at your house."</p>
               <p>"Some one is approaching now to claim your hand Miss Grafton, for the next quadrille; and I doubt not many have wondered how you could have spent so much time, listening to a stupid young fellow's conversation, when you might have been whirling in the mazy dance."</p>
               <p>Dora merely had time to say, "it must be hard for one so much attached to a rural home, to lead a city life, but I suppose your mother will, as far as it is possible, supply the loss of her parents to her," when she was obliged to leave the young man to whom both herself and brother were much attached, to join the dancers. To some of my readers it may seem unnatural, for young persons to stop in the midst of their enjoyment and mirth, to talk of things wholly foreign to the scenes before them—but those young beings carry into the halls of pleasure, the same hearts and minds that they have in their daily walks of life; and though they may, to a certain extent, become dazzled by the splendor around them, still the<pb n="18-19" xml:id="VAC6293-00000010"/> nobler sentiments of their hearts are not crushed, but hidden under a thin veil; and when anything occurs to draw those feelings out, the heart is never more alive, and the feelings more exalted, than when surrounded by every thing to please the eye and ear.</p>
               <p>It seems to be a mistaken idea, with many, that because a number of young persons are gathered for pleasure, that there is nothing but frivolity among them; but oftentimes the most beautiful thoughts, and the noblest sentiments, are exchanged at such gatherings. The same mind is there, in that young man or woman, in embryo perhaps, that is to sway a nation, or infuse the purest principles into the childish mind.</p>

               <p>A FEW days after the party, Dora and Hermione went to call upon the cousin of Henry Adams, of whom mention was made in our last chapter, and who had now taken up her residence with her aunt, Mrs. Adams, who was a lady capable of appreciating the worth of such a girl as Alice Gleason; and then, too, there was so much in Alice that reminded Mrs. Adams of her mother, whom she had almost idolized, that it made her doubly dear to her.</p>
               <p>While they were on their way to the house, Hermione remarked, "I never fancied making new acquaintances, there is not much romance in my nature. I am better satisfied with a few old and tried friends."</p>
               <p>"Why so Hermione? We are liable to meet with those who may prove very agreeable."</p>
               <p>"I know it, but then one is so liable to be deceived<pb n="20-21" xml:id="VAC6293-00000011"/> at first sight; we may be delighted with a person who on further acquaintance would become really disagreeable to us; and then, on the other hand, we may dislike a person at first acquaintance, and not seek after their society, when if we had cultivated the friendship, we should have found much to admire in their characters."</p>
               <p>"Are not your objections rather selfish, Hermione?"</p>
               <p>"I think it quite probable Dora; I am so often selfish, that I should be so in the present instance."</p>
               <p>"I did not mean that you were more selfish than thousands who plead the same excuse, for their unwillingness to make new acquaintances. But for the sake of others, ought not we to stifle our own selfish feelings? Just imagine the feeling of loneliness this young girl would experience, to come to our city expecting to make it her home, and have most of the young people of her class, unwilling to make her acquaintance, for the reasons you have mentioned. I dislike greatly myself to make calls upon strangers, but then I feel that after we have met a few times, we shall be strangers no more. Besides, she is an orphan, her cousin Henry told me, and it always seems as though the orphan had an especial claim upon our friendship. It appeared to me that if I should lose my parents, I should need friends more than ever, to fill up in a certain measure, the void in my heart."</p>
               <p>"I always feel rebuked in your society dear Dora; you are so entirely unselfish, naturally, that if you can only render others happy, the sacrifices you may have to endure in your own feelings, seem to be a pleasure to you. I am heartily ashamed of my selfish remarks."</p>
               <p>"Do not take it as a rebuke, dear Hermione; it was far from my thoughts to reprove you, who have performed so many noble sacrifices; I merely spoke the sentiments of my heart, in regard to calling upon strangers."</p>
               <p>"Yes, Dora, and well you may follow the promptings of such a heart as yours, but for me to abide by mine, would prove but a poor guide I fear."</p>
               <p>"You do yourself injustice, Hermione; the only difference in us is, that when I receive an impression, I act upon it at once, without waiting to consider; while you are inclined to stop to philosophize a while; and then you blame your heart for the errors of your head."</p>
               <p>"I believe you are half right Dora, but here we are, almost at Mrs. Adams' door; it does not seem<pb n="22-23" xml:id="VAC6293-00000012"/> possible, our conversation has so occupied my attention, that I did not dream we were so near."</p>
               <p>Their ring at the door was answered by a well dressed, and civil man servant, who conducted them to the parlor. Every thing in the room wore a happy look. Reader! did you never enter such a room, where the very furniture looked cheerful, and every article was arranged so tastefully, that the eye loved to dwell upon it; and you felt sure that harmony and peace, were the inmates of that lovely dwelling?</p>
               <p>Mrs. Adams gloried not in being a fashionable woman, though she could boast her thousands; but her pride was in being a true wife and mother, in other words, <q>
                     <lg type="quotation">
                        <l>——"A woman nobly planned,</l>
                        <l>To warn, to comfort, and command."</l>
                     </lg>
                  </q> She was not one who ever kept her guests waiting for her appearance, until their patience was well nigh exhausted, for her dress, though rich, was always simple and easily arranged. Nature had given to her counteenance, such a beautiful expression, that she was not beholden to <emph>cosmetics,</emph> to render her looks agreeable.</p>
               <p>She entered the room with matronly dignity, yet with a sweet smile upon her placid countenance, followed by her niece to whom she introduced the young ladies. Alice took their proffered hands with cordiality, as though she were really glad to make their acquaintance; she had often heard the names of these two young ladies mentioned by her aunt and cousin, and knew it to be their wish that she should cultivate their acquaintance.</p>
               <p>Hermione and Dora had expected to find her with a sad countenance, and mourning garments; but on the reverse, her manners were simple, yet cheerful, and her dress neat, but tasteful. She would not have been called beautiful at first sight, though none could be long in her society, and not accede to her the palm of beauty.</p>
               <p>"How do you think you shall enjoy residing in the city, Miss Gleason?" said Hermione.</p>
               <p>"I have a preference for a country life, but if any thing would resign me to living in the city, it would be that I might be in the society of my aunt and cousin."</p>
               <p>She had so sweet a voice and manner in conversing, that Dora felt a great desire to hear her sing; when she asked her if she sang and played, she replied that she did, a little.</p>
               <p>"Will you not favor us with some music then?" said Dora.</p>
               <pb n="24-25" xml:id="VAC6293-00000013"/>
               <p>She sat down to the piano with ease, though she had good sense enough to know, that the plaintive airs she had been accustomed to play to her parents, in the little parsonage at home, were unlike the popular music of the day; yet she appeared as much at ease, as though she were transported to their little sitting room, where the windows were shaded by the green woodbine, instead of being in the handsome drawing-room of her aunt, where the sun's rays were kept out by the heavy folds of the rich damask curtains.</p>
               <p>Dora and Hermione were delighted with her playing, and both felt much pleased with the <emph>first appearance,</emph> of their new acquaintance, and thankful that she had the good fortune, now that she was deprived of her parents, to have so good a home, and with so desirable a person as Mrs. Adams.</p>
               <p>When they were on their way home, Hermione said, "I was surprised to find Miss Gleason so cheerful. I had pictured her in my mind, as a little, sad sort of a being, but to find her dressed in her usual manner, and in so good spirits was entirely unexpected."</p>
               <p>"I was rather surprised myself at first," said Dora. "But I remembered brother Fred told me that Henry Adams had spoken to him, of the pleasant views of death Alice had been taught by her parents: that they had instructed her not to indulge in unreasonable grief after their departure from earth, and thus unfit her for life's duties; but to look beyond the grave for consolation; and that they would all soon be united in heaven."</p>
               <p>"Well, she is a noble looking girl, and entirely free from pretensions. I feel that she will be an agreeable acquaintance," said Hermione.</p>
               <p>"You enjoyed the call then?" said Dora.</p>
               <p>"The most of any I have ever made upon a stranger."</p>
               <p>"Her cousin Henry compared her to a sweet wild flower, and I should suppose it to be a very good comparison, her manners are so simple and natural, and she seems so well suited to enjoy a country home," said Dora.</p>

               <p>WHEN Hermione found that without great exertion and economy, the small income that had been saved from the wreck of their former fortune to meet the expenses of the family, must become drained, she was not disheartened, but feared that the small amount she had been able to earn, from giving lessons in French, a study in which she greatly excelled, would be insufficient to supply the deficiency. Mr. Phelps had been considered one of our heaviest merchants; he had carried on an extensive business, but the year before his death he had entered largely into speculation, in which he was very unsuccessful, and which so involved him in debt, that a total failure was the result. This, no doubt so wore upon his mind, that it hastened on the disease which terminated his existence. Thus, his family were in one short year, deprived of a husband, father and fortune.</p>
               <p>Hermione did not shrink from further exertion, but she scarcely knew what steps to take, or what course to pursue. She cared not for what the world might say, she was willing to engage in any honorable calling that would compensate her for her labors. She knew that many who in prosperity had flattered and caressed, would now pass her with scorn, but she cared not for such summer friends; she saw her duty to her family, and determined to perform it faithfully; and if sometimes she might feel her lot was hard, she would be able to bear it calmly, because her conscience was at rest.</p>
               <pb n="28-29" xml:id="VAC6293-00000015"/>
               <p>Her task would have been less difficult, had it not been for the feeble state of her mother's health, which made the care and management of the family to devolve almost entirely upon her. But Hermione did not complain, even to Dora, and they were almost inseparable friends; but Mrs. Grafton, who was always observant of the wants of others, thought Hermione appeared anxious and thoughtful in conversation, and ventured to inquire how she was succeeding with her class.</p>
               <p>Hermione replied that she feared she should be under the necessity of abandoning her present pursuits, and seeking one more lucrative, for she did not receive patronage enough to compensate her for her time.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Grafton bore her remarks in mind, and determined if it was in her power, to aid her in her endeavors, so that she might be able to receive more amends for her labors.</p>
               <p>Dora came in one day from a call on Hermione, with an expression of sadness upon her usually joyous countenance, that led Mrs. Grafton to think that something had occurred to disturb her daughter's happiness; but she did not refer to it, for she well knew the perfect confidence Dora reposed in her, and that she should soon know its cause.</p>
               <p>"Mother," said Dora, "I feel convinced that Hermione has too much care upon her mind for one so young. Why is it, mother, that our lot in life is so different? How gladly would I bear a portion of her cares, if it would but ease her. Here I am surrounded by every luxury, while she who is equally deserving of them, is deprived of so many. As she ceased, the tears of real sympathy flowed from her eyes."</p>
               <p>"Hermione is better calculated to bear up under trials than many," replied Mrs. Grafton. "You could not endure the hardships, and receive the cold treatment of former friends. Your nature is so sensitive, you would not long survive the trying ordeal. But has anything now occurred to render Hermione's path more thorny?"</p>
               <p>"When I called this afternoon I found her so engaged in conversation with her oldest brother, who is now nearly fourteen, that I did not immediately enter the room where they were, but sat down in one adjoining. I knew that the management of the family, now that her mother is so feeble, comes upon her; and thought perhaps she might be correcting him;<pb n="30-31" xml:id="VAC6293-00000016"/> but I soon found that she was making of him, what she will not of any one else, a confidant of their family affairs. I felt extremely uncomfortable, for I had the appearance of playing the eaves-dropper, though such was far from my intention. I could not avoid hearing part of the conversation, though as soon as possible I knocked for admission."</p>
               <p>"Hermione understands you too well, my dear, to suppose you guilty of so mean an act."</p>
               <p>"I know it mother, but it made me feel so sad to hear her tell her brother that their landlord had called that day, and said that he felt obliged to raise upon their rent, and if they were unable to pay it, they must look up another tenement. Hermione told him that they should be obliged to leave the house, as they were unable to pay a cent more for rent, than they did already. She had been obliged that afternoon to neglect her class, her mother was so indisposed."</p>
               <p>"Do not look so sad Dora," said Mrs. Grafton, "remember that I have always taught you that '<emph>every cloud has a silver lining,</emph>' and I doubt not though every thing looks dark now for Hermione that we shall be able to do something for her."</p>
               <p>"Hermione has shown a great deal of perseverance, and all she needs is to be placed in some situation where she can command a high salary, to fill the station with honor."</p>
               <p>"Cannot we think of something at once, so that they will not be obliged to move, for I know that the tenement is very convenient for their family?"</p>
               <p>"I noticed that Hermione has seemed unusually thoughtful of late," said Mrs. Grafton, "and have spoken to your father concerning it; last eve we saw an advertisement in the paper for a lady to take the charge of a select boarding-school for young ladies, the highest price paid for tuition; your father has gone this afternoon to see the gentleman whose reference was given. I have said nothing about it to you for fear that he might not succeed, and you would feel so much disappointed. We had no scruples in recommending Hermione, as we knew her to possess superior talents; and that dignity of deportment so essential in a teacher."</p>
               <p>In a moment Dora's arms were about her mother's neck, half smothering her with kisses.</p>
               <p>"Oh! that is so like you dear mother," said she.</p>
               <p>At this time Mr. Grafton entered the room with a self-satisfied look upon his face. He did not wait to<pb n="32-33" xml:id="VAC6293-00000017"/> be questioned concerning the success of his visit, for he well knew by the inquiring expression on his daughter's face, that Mrs. Grafton had informed Dora of the object of it, and that they were anxious to know the result.</p>
               <p>"I have called this afternoon upon one of the gentlemen referred to in the advertisement last eve, and though but partially acquainted with him, received a cordial reception. After my description of Hermione, he thought she would be exactly suited for the situation, and promised to call upon her to-morrow. If he is pleased with her he will make an immediate engagement; his terms will be liberal, as the school is intended for some of the children of our wealthiest families. It will enable Hermione to provide for the family handsomely."</p>
               <p>Dora's joy can better be imagined than written.</p>
               <p>"<emph>Dear, dear Papa!</emph> I believe you love to do good."</p>
               <p>"If any one is to receive praise it is your mother," said Mr. Grafton, "for she has noticed the anxious appearance of Hermione, and desired me to endeavor to find a situation for her, where her labors might be appreciated, and receive a sufficient compensation. I happened last eve to see the advertisement for a teacher er, and on reading it, thought that Hermione would answer admirably for the situation. It was no trouble for me to ride over after my business hours, and talk with the gentleman. So you see the credit all belongs to your mother."</p>
               <p>Dora could hardly wait for her brother to return from the office, to accompany her to Hermione's, to communicate to her the anticipated visitor for the morrow, and to inform her of the object of his visit.</p>
               <p>Hermione's heart was too full of thankfulness to permit words to convey her meaning. She took Dora's hand in hers and pressed it tightly, and only remarked, while her usually firm voice trembled:</p>
               <p>"I hope the gentleman will not be disappointed when he comes to talk with me, for I know of no situation that would suit me better than to take the charge of a family boarding school."</p>
               <p>If Mr. Grafton had offered money to Hermione, her independent spirit would have shrunk from accepting it. But a recommendation to a situation, where by her own exertions, she might earn a competent support for herself, and those dependent on her, she considered a true favor, and though she made no great pretensions of gratitude, her face spoke volumes.</p>
               <pb n="34-35" xml:id="VAC6293-00000018"/>
               <p>She looked beautiful that eve, at least so thought Fred Grafton, as she stood before them just before they took their departure; her dress was, as usual, of the deepest black, with the exception of a plain white collar about her neck. Every feature of her face bore the traces of energy stamped upon them, yet her countenance looked so pale and cold, that some would have called it even severe. There was a canker worm knawing at that heart—'twas not that a family were looking up to her, mainly for support; to make them happy, she could have labored unceasingly, and forgotten her fatigue, in the satisfaction it would give her to see them cared for. But 'twas a love for one, whom she knew in her heart was unworthy her remembrance; and yet who she could not forget. She was not one who could easily place her affections upon an object; but when once fixed death itself could not break down the walls, with which she would surround it. uch had been her love for Frank Landon and it strengthened during their engagement, and with her it would have been as true and lasting as the sun; and though he proved deceitful, and showed how shallow was his love for her, still his very image was dear to her heart. True she had bid him go with a voice as firm, and face as calm as usual, for she would not have wished to have had one for a companion, who did not love her for herself alone. But her heart would ever treasure the memory of those days, when she thought him sincere, and though to the world she might appear as though she had forgotten that he ever existed, yet her heart had once enthroned him its idol, and as such he would ever remain enshrined.</p>

               <p>MRS. GRAFTON was a very benevolent woman, and took more pleasure in going about among the poor doing good, and finding out for herself, those who were really deserving of charity, than she did in placing her name among a list of others for quite a sum of money, when she was almost ignorant of the manner in which it would be expended. What charity she had to bestow, she gave without ostentation.</p>
               <p>She had been accustomed always to take Dora even when a child, with her, when she went on her errands of mercy; and many a time has the face of some poor sufferer brightened, at sight of the kind lady and little girl, passing the threshold of their hovel, to administer to their wants, for they never came empty handed.</p>
               <p>This was calculated even in childhood to render Dora less selfish and if she ever expressed a wish which her mother thought best to deny, she had merely to remind her of some poor child who was deprived of so many blessings which she was permitted to enjoy, to render her wholly reconciled to the refusal.</p>
               <p>Dora as she grew older had not abandoned these pursuits. She always found time to minister to the poor and suffering; and though she enjoyed the society of her young companions; yet she found one of her truest sources of happiness, in relieving the wants of others.</p>
               <p>Among those who were recipients of Dora's bounty, was an interesting little boy. She became acquainted with his destitute condition from seeing him in the street selling matches. His countenance was pale and haggard, and oftentimes he walked along with his bundles, as though they were a burden to him, yet he always looked neat and clean, and his manners were very respectful. She had the curiosity to stop day and ask him where he lived? As he replied, he fixed upon her an eye, the expression of which she could never forget.</p>
               <p>"You do not feel well to-day, do you?" said she.</p>
               <p>"I am very tired," he replied quietly.</p>
               <pb n="38-39" xml:id="VAC6293-00000020"/>
               <p>Yes, thought Dora, but you will not long be so. Death will soon close those beautiful eyes, and in the sweet slumber, his weary limbs will find that rest, which in life was denied them.</p>
               <p>She blamed herself for not having inquired into his circumstances before. She went the next day to the house where he had informed her he lived, with his mother and sister. She was surprised when she arrived there, to find the little fellow confined to his bed, he had overt asked himself the day before, and was unable to rise. The young woman who was bending over his bed with the utmost anxiety, and who bore in her arms a sweet babe of only a few weeks, he called mother. She was quite young, and her whole appearance betokened better days, though abject poverty was now her lot.</p>
               <p>"Good morning," said Dora, "I called in to see your little boy."</p>
               <p>As she approached the bed the little sufferer extended his hand to her, for he recognized, at once, the kind lady who had more than once slipped a trifle into his hand.</p>
               <p>"I blame myself," said his mother, "that I have allowed my boy to exert himself beyond his strength. But she had been so feeble since the birth of her babe, that they had been almost dependent for the bread they ate, upon the few sales he might make in the course of the day."</p>
               <p>Dora ascertained, while she was conversing with her, that she had formerly resided in the country and known better days. Her husband had wooed and won her, and she exchanged her pleasant country home for one in the city. For the first few years, they lived very comfortably; but her husband became intimate with young men of idle and dissipated habits, and he was led on from step to step, to utter ruin; and a few months before the birth of her babe, he had left her to her fate.</p>
               <p>Her case was indeed a sad one; she was left almost penniless, and now her hands were tied with an infant. Her little son, who was old beyond his years, made every exertion possible to earn a little, daily. She did what plain sewing she was able to do, and take care of her babe.</p>
               <p>Dora, from this time, became interested in the family, and did much for their relief. She visited them every few days. The little fellow often expressed a desire for spring to return, for his mother had promised<pb n="40-41" xml:id="VAC6293-00000021"/> ed him, that if he was able, they would go back to the country; she well knew that though she had few, if any, relatives living, yet she would be kindly welcomed by the friends of her childhood. Little Willie longed to hear the birds sing in the forest trees, as he had once heard them, when he went with his mother on a visit to the country; and to see the pretty flowers, growing by the wayside. Dora wished to make his illness as little tedious as possible, and brought to him green-house plants to sit beside his bed; and sent to him a sweet-songed canary, to enliven his dull hours. All these little attentions won the child's affections to her.</p>
               <p>She was seated one day by his bedside reading to him some simple but interesting story. When she had finished he said, "Dear Miss Dora (that was the way he usually addressed her) there was a beautiful young gentleman called here the other day, he seemed just like you, he was so kind. He said he was a Doctor. I believe the minister where mother used to go to church, sent him here to see if he could not give me something, to make me well again. I love to have him come, he gave me something that made me cough easier, and I slept well all night, but he would not take any of mother's money to pay for it. I wish you could see him, he is so handsome."</p>
               <p>"I think he was very kind," said Dora. "Has he called many times?"</p>
               <p>"Not but once or twice, but he said he should come again this week, perhaps he may call to-day, I wish he would. He asked me where I got such a beautiful bird, and such pretty flowers. I told him Miss Dora gave them to me, and that I loved her dearly."</p>
               <p>At this time there was a knock upon the door, and Willie exclaimed, "that's him, I know by the knock."</p>
               <p>Dora scarcely knew why, but to meet a handsome young man, in so unexpected a manner, and in a place where she had gone from purely charitable motives, caused a blush to suffuse her cheeks, which only added a new charm to her beauty.</p>
               <p>Dr. Abbott, for such was the gentleman's name, looked much surprised to see so lovely a young girl, seeking happiness in a home of poverty, and striving to make the sick room cheerful. But the picture she presented as he entered, made an impression on his mind, that time could not obliterate.</p>
               <p>She quietly left the room after his entrance; but she could not keep the incident from her mind. The<pb n="42-43" xml:id="VAC6293-00000022"/> countenance of the young man would, in spite of herself, intrude itself into her thoughts, and once or twice through the evening, Fred was obliged to repeat what he was saying to her, before he obtained an answer.</p>
               <p>"How absent minded you are this evening Dora; do collect your thoughts enough to converse with your brother for a few moments, and then he will leave you to your meditations, for I know your revery must be intensely interesting or it would not so entirely engross your attention," said Fred.</p>
               <p>"Excuse me, dear Fred," said she, smiling through her confusion. "I will endeavor to be more entertaining the remainder of the evening. Come let us practise that new piece of music you brought home with you the other evening." She was glad to turn his attention from herself.</p>
               <p>As to the young Doctor, it must be confessed, though he was, as a general thing, very attentive to his patients, and desirous of obtaining every particular of the state of their health; in the present instance, he inquired full as much about the young lady who was present, when he entered, as he did of the symptoms of his little patient; and of course, the mother and child were both loud in the praise of one who had been to them so kind a friend, and who had brought light into their home, where all before was dark; and caused them to see a faint tint of the silver lining of the cloud that threatened at one time to envelop them in its darkness.</p>

               <p>FRED Grafton had now finished his collegiate course; and his father had determined to send him abroad for a few years. He had from childhood displayed great love for painting, and had always employed his leisure hours in sketching from nature, in painting the portraits of his friends, or of any face that struck him as peculiar. He now intended to spend some time in the land of art and beauty, and perfect himself in copying the beautiful in nature in the sunny clime of Italy.</p>
               <p>It had become known among his friends and acquaintances, that he would soon leave them for a few years; he was a great favorite, and he received numerous invitations to parties given on his account.</p>
               <p>It was a great trial to him to leave the home of his childhood, for to him it had been "<emph>a sweet home.</emph>" His attachment to his father was very strong, and his mother he had always regarded as a sort of oracle, when she made a request of him, it had been a pleasure to obey.</p>
               <p>As to Dora, it seemed as though his heart was so interwoven with hers, that a separation would be almost impossible; but he hushed its wild throbbings with the hope that the sundering of those ties would be only for a season, and that the angel of death would stay his shaft, and prevent it from piercing the hearts of any of the loved ones, he would be obliged to leave behind.</p>
               <p>But there was one out of the family circle, for whom he entertained a feeling at parting, that he had never dreamed had so firm a hold upon his affection. That one was Hermione Phelps; he had been much in her society, on account of her intimacy with Dora, but he did not know until he came to bid her adieu, that his friendship was so akin to love. Then all the noble traits in her character seemed to shine out in bold relief, and he saw so much to admire, that he imagined that if he could obtain a promise from her<pb n="46-47" xml:id="VAC6293-00000024"/> that when he returned he might be permitted to call her his, he would be securing a treasure more valuable to his happiness, than ought else beside. And yet he experienced a feeling of reluctance, in communicating to her his attachment, for though she always appeared to enjoy his society, she had never displayed the least trace of preference for him, except as the brother of her friend, and son of her benefactor.</p>
               <p>He thought perhaps she might repulse his offer with coldness, but he might have spared her this judgment, for however repulsive she might appear to others, she would never have spurned the offer of a sincere heart, and though perchance she had none to offer in return, she would not glory in casting back with scorn, his proffered love. No, her own heart had been too deeply wrung to permit her to cause anothers to bleed.</p>
               <p>A few afternoon's before he was to take his leave of his friends, a ride out of town was proposed by Henry Adams. It had the appearance of proving a beautiful day for a ride, and the party, which consisted of Dora, Hermione and Alice Gleason, accompanied by Fred and Henry, sat out in fine spirits. Henry and Dora preferred to go on horseback, while the others took possession of the carriage. Sometimes they would allow the horses to walk leisurely along the shaded streets, and enjoy pleasant conversation, then suddenly Henry and Dora would gallop past them, and playfully shake their riding whips at those in the carriage, until they were quite out of sight, and then rest under the cool shade of some overhanging tree, till they came up.</p>
               <p>Thus they were so much interested in the admiration of the beautiful [scenery, and their merriment, that they did not notice the rising of a cloud, until it was nearly over their heads, and found that they should be obliged to seek shelter in the nearest habitation.</p>
               <p>They drove quickly on, and soon came in sight of a stately mansion, set back some distance from the road, on an eminence, nearly surrounded by trees, and a beautiful avenue leading up to the house.</p>
               <p>Here they were obliged to seek protection, for the rain began to descend, as they came in sight of the house. They were observed by the occupants, as they turned up the avenue, and a servant stood in readiness on the piazza, to assist them to alight, and take their<pb n="48-49" xml:id="VAC6293-00000025"/> horses, while a lady stood in the doorway to welcome the travellers to the hospitality of the house.</p>
               <p>They were supplied with every comfort, and refreshments were brought in. The lady who had received them, proved to be the widowed daughter of the old lady who owned the mansion.</p>
               <p>Soon after their entrance the old lady came in, holding by the hand her little grandson. She bade them welcome in the kindest manner.</p>
               <p>In the course of conversation the younger lady remarked:</p>
               <p>"I should not perhaps have noticed your approach, but I was watching for my brother, whom we are expecting out this afternoon from the city, and I feared he would be caught out in the shower."</p>
               <p>"Ah, there he comes," she exclaimed.</p>
               <p>They looked out of the window, and saw coming up the avenue a handsome chaise; as it drew near, what was the surprise of Dora, to notice as its occupant, the young Doctor, whom she had met at little Willie's.</p>
               <p>The rain had now abated considerably, and only a gentle shower was falling. The lady ran to the door to meet her brother, and a mutual kiss was exchanged.</p>
               <p>When the lady introduced him to the company as her brother, Dr. Abbott, the color mounted to the cheek of Dora. And when he advanced and took her hand, remarking he believed he had met her before, her eyes fell beneath his earnest gaze.</p>
               <p>His manner towards his aged parent was very deferential, and it was evident that the old lady doated upon her children. After the rain was nearly over, a fine rainbow appeared in the clouds, and all were attracted to the door, to observe its beauty. As they stood there, the sun shone out in full splendor, and the perfume from the garden, after the shower, was so delicious, that they could not refrain from strolling down its gravelled walks. They were soon rambling in groups among the numerous paths of the garden.</p>
               <p>It so happened that Fred and Hermione were separated from the rest of the party, admiring a beautiful arbor; they sat down upon one of its rustic benches, and there Fred told the story of his love.</p>
               <p>During its recital, Hermione's face was less calm than usual, and when she replied, it was evident by the kindness and sympathy with which she addressed him, that it gave her pain to reject him, though she had no heart to offer in return.</p>
               <pb n="50-51" xml:id="VAC6293-00000026"/>
               <p>"I have always felt almost a sister's love for you," said she, "But nothing would tempt me to burden you with the cares which would devolve upon you, were you to become my husband. And then she frankly told him, that she believed in '<emph>first love,</emph>' and if she had loved one who proved deceitful, it did not alter her feelings. She felt sometimes that her heart had turned to stone, and that love for another could never be excited; and that if it were not for the exertion she was obliged to make for the sake of her family, she should become a miserable misanthrope. She assured him that in after years, when he could call one <emph>wife</emph> who could give to him her undivided love, he would thank her for her present refusal. You may find too, said she, that what you have mistaken for <emph>love,</emph> is only <emph>friendship.</emph>"</p>
               <p>Fred could not feel that she delighted in throwing back his love, and this only increased his admiration for her, but when he thought of the vast difference in their dispositions, he felt that perhaps there might be truth in what she said; still it seemed to him these obstacles need not prevent their future union.</p>
               <p>When they mingled with the others, Fred could not appear as cheerful as before; but Hermione had regained her usual calmness.</p>
               <p>The others of the party had been engaged in surveying the grounds belonging to the mansion, while the young Doctor pointed out to them in an interesting manner, the beauties of the surrounding prospect.</p>
               <p>Alice Gleason had not enjoyed an afternoon more, since she left her country home. She had been in the society of those who were congenial to her, and permitted to enjoy pure out of door exercise in the country. The company of childhood was always pleasing to her, and she became much interested in the little son of the widow.</p>
               <p>All of them (not accepting Dora) were much pleased with the young Doctor. After they had rambled round sufficiently, they repaired to the house, where a table, spread with every luxury which the season afforded, awaited them.</p>
               <p>Soon after tea the horses were ordered. Dora's ride and ramble had made her unusually animated, and as she waived her adieu to those on the piazza as they rode down the avenue, she looked very beautiful. Her green riding dress was nicely fitted to her finely moulded form; and the little fancy riding hat which<pb n="52-53" xml:id="VAC6293-00000027"/> she wore, was admirably suited to her peculiar style of beauty.</p>
               <p>Doctor Abbott watched her intently till she was out of sight, and then stood gazing into vacancy, till roused from his meditative mood, by the call of his sister, who wished for his company within.</p>
               <p>About a week after this time Fred set out on his voyage; many were the tears shed when he left them; and all that reconciled Dora to the separation, was the immense advantage it would be to him in his art. Alice and she had been contemplating for some time, assuming the responsibility of teachers to a class for instructing the children of the poor the art of sewing properly; and now that Fred was gone, Dora was glad to employ herself in a benevolent object, that would occupy some of her leisure time, so that she might not feel so lonely without him.</p>
               <p>Doctor Abbott cultivated her acquaintance, and called often to see her. Mr. and Mrs. Grafton could not but be pleased with his gentlemanly manner. He often met with Dora at little Willie's, and with so attentive a Doctor, and kind friend as Dora, it was not at all strange that his health improved rapidly, much to the joy of the anxious mother.</p>
               <p>It would be well if there were more interested in the benevolent plan, which actuated Dora and Alice, that of instructing children, whose parents have neither the time nor ability, in the proper use of the needle.</p>
               <p>Now that sewing is prohibited in our common schools, many a child of poverty grows up, and assumes the responsibility of families, without a thorough knowledge of the correct rules of putting the most common garment together. Is it to be wondered at then, that so many ragged children crowd our streets? no doubt but what many times, sufficient clothing is given to their parents, if they were only capable of altering and making them over, to have those same children look neat and whole.</p>
               <p>Dora and Alice had both been blessed with parents, who had endeavored to make their children something more than mere butterflies, to float along on the surface of society, and sup only of its sweets. But they felt that those committed to their charge were immortal beings, and that a great responsibility rested upon them, to fit them to perform the duties of this life, and prepare for a high state of existence in another.</p>
               <p>They had thought best to instil into their young<pb n="54-55" xml:id="VAC6293-00000028"/> minds, such principles and rules of action as would render them instrumental of much good in after years; to resemble the bee, and lay up treasures of useful knowledge, for the good of themselves and others.</p>
               <p>In addition to book learning, both had received instructions in plain and ornamental sewing, so that they were competent of taking the charge of such a class. It was a pleasant sight to see those two young teachers of a self imposed task, as they gathered, of a Saturday afternoon, their young pupils around them; they were a cheerful group, for gratitude was in the hearts of the scholars, and the satisfaction of doing good in the teachers.</p>
               <p>Many a mother's heart has been made glad by the improvement her little girl was making in sewing, and her heart filled with gratitude to those, who had so generously offered their time and patience to instruct her.</p>
               <p>Some of these parents would gladly have taught their children themselves, but had not the time; while others were too little skilled themselves to think of being of any assistance to their children; thus they would have been obliged to grow up to woman-hood, poorly fitted to discharge those duties, which of necessity must fall upon them.</p>
               <p>But they did not confine their teaching to common sewing only, they knew that many a child of poverty has great taste for the ornamental parts of needle-work, but it may never be brought out and cultivated, because the circumstances of their parents are such, that to supply the necessary wants of their children, they are unable to expend anything for the ornamental. And these poor children seldom, if ever, have any kind friends who are able to offer assistance. It would be well, perhaps, if some of the useless money, that is sometimes expended by the rich, upon a child naturally dull, was bestowed to bring out some buried talent in a child bred in poverty.</p>
               <p>They spent much time in purchasing and cutting out garments for their pupils; and Dora was right glad to find in this new employment, occupation for her mind and fingers; for beside the benefit it was to others, it served to beguile many a leisure hour of its tediousness, caused by the absence of her much loved brother.</p>
               <p>Dr. Abbott was now a constant visitor upon Dora, and each time he saw her he became more interested<pb n="56-57" xml:id="VAC6293-00000029"/> in her, and found some new trait of character to admire; he approved much of the plan pursued by herself and Alice, and contributed considerably to their fund, besides jocosely adding that if any of their pupils should fall victims to the ills that flesh is heir to, they might know where to send for a Physician who would offer his valuable services gratuitously.</p>
               <p>Hermione succeeded finely with her school, and it promised, under her care, to become one of the most flourishing in the city. She spent as many of her leisure hours as possible with Dora, but she never lisped a word of her brother's offer. She did not glory in the rejection of his love, but rather grieved that she had been unable to return it. She would inquire as kindly of Dora what news she heard from her brother, and speak the same of him as though he had never felt more for her than common friendship. And indeed such only she thought it to be. Hermione understood human nature so well, that she felt that Fred had really mistaken his own heart, and construed deep friendship for love.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Adams and Henry almost doted upon Alice. Mrs. Adams was a widow, and she never had possessed a daughter's love, and Henry always regretted that he had not a sister; Alice supplied the place to them. She had now been with them two years, and their attachment to her had become very strong, and indeed it would have been impossible for any one to have dwelt with Alice that length of time, and not have loved her dearly. All they regretted was, that she would probably soon leave their home, to become mistress of another.</p>
               <p>She was now nineteen, and had become engaged to a gentleman some years older than herself, who was much respected as a man of talent and worth. Alice seemed to think him almost perfection, and the marriage was approved by Mrs. Adams and Henry; but Dora had had some misgivings from the first of the engagement. She knew that the intimacy would probably result in marriage, for neither Mr. Menton nor Alice were persons to become attached for a moment, and then be attracted by some new face. But she had her doubts as to the marriage proving a happy one. In many respects she knew that Mr. Menton was a person exactly suited to the taste of Alice, he was intelligent and wealthy, and possessed of great talent; that Alice loved him she had no doubt, but she feared that he was so much absorbed in his books<pb n="58-59" xml:id="VAC6293-00000030"/> that he would never be one calculated to render a wife happy. Alice was one who would need the society and sympathy of a husband, to render her life pleasant, but she never thought it her place to speak to Alice about the matter. If it was her choice she felt that others had no right to interfere.</p>

               <p>A YEAR passed swiftly away, and Alice stood before the altar, to pledge her love to one who had chosen her for his companion through life.</p>
               <p>Dora was her bridesmaid and Henry Adams the groomsman. Both bride and bridesmaid were attired in white satin, with but few ornaments; the only distinction in their dress, was the wreath of white orange flowers, that encircled the fair brow of the bride.</p>
               <p>Alice was a thoughtful though a happy bride; and as she responded to the beautiful marriage service of the church, she felt with all the depth of woman's love, the purity and beauty of the vow she was taking.</p>
               <pb n="60-61" xml:id="VAC6293-00000031"/>
               <p>But the ceremony was an unusually sad one to Dora, she could scarcely account for its being so, for both Alice and her friends appeared to think that Mr. Menton would prove an excellent husband. She was naturally free from superstition, but as the ring was about to be placed upon the finger of the bride, a cloud suddenly obscured the sun's rays, and a shadow fell upon Alice; Dora almost involuntarily shuddered, and could scarcely keep back the tears; she felt that this was an omen of the anxious years, perhaps, of sorrow that awaited Alice in the married life.</p>
               <p>After the bridal tour, Mr. Menton took his bride to his elegant residence in the country. It was a beautiful and romantic situation, the grounds were laid out with much taste and order; and within and without the dwelling was all one could desire. The furniture was rich and costly, and the rooms filled with rare collections of books, paintings and sculpture. Every thing was here to please the eye.</p>
               <p>Soon after they became settled in their abode, after they returned from their journey, Alice persuaded Dora to come and make her a visit. Dora was delighted with the situation, but she soliloquized as she retired one night to the beautifully furnished apartment, assigned her for her sleeping room.—What avails all these treasures, if the heart is not satisfied, but is constantly longing for sympathy from one, from whom it has a right to expect it?—Such she felt to be the condition of Alice; she was surrounded with every luxury wealth could procure, but that is not all a wife needs to render her lot happy. She expects sympathy in her husband, and if she finds it not, her heart is not satisfied, and those treasures she would have so much admired, lose half their attraction because she is obliged to enjoy them alone.</p>
               <p>Although the time for the so called honey-moon had not expired, Mr. Menton found too many excuses for retiring to his library, Dora thought, there to spend the greater part of the day, to render his bride happy in the new home to which he had taken her. He did not appear to realize that he had taken her from her home and kindred, where she had been almost an idol, and her every wish had been gratified, and that it was his duty to endeavor to more than supply their place to her.</p>
               <p>Alice would always make some excuse for her husband's absenting himself so much, but more than once during her stay, Dora thought she detected traces of tears upon the cheek of Alice.</p>
               <pb n="62-63" xml:id="VAC6293-00000032"/>
               <p>The fact was, though Mr. Menton considered Alice a superior person, he had married from purely selfish motives. He came in possession, at his father's death, of an extensive property, and, as he had no mother, he needed much a mistress at the head of his establishment; the care of servants was a sore trial to one so entirely engrossed in books as he. He was fond of order and regularity, and he felt that a wife would be very valuable to him in conducting his household affairs; and then it would be exceedingly agreeable, when he received invited guests at his table, to see an intelligent and handsome wife at its head. As to any ideas of domestic bliss he was entirely free. He felt it his duty to keep her liberally supplied with spending money, to carry on the affairs; and when convenient for him to spend a leisure moment in her presence, to do so. Further than this, he considered a wife had no claim on him. Surely he provided her with a splendid home and plenty of servants to do her bidding; a fine carriage at her command, and plenty of spending money; what more need she desire?</p>
               <p>And if it was his pleasure to absent himself from her society the greater part of the time, pouring over his books, he did not dream it could be any privation to her; the time seemed short to him, his mind was so occupied, and she was surrounded with every thing to make it the same to her. He was entirely ignorant of a true female character, and took no pains to become acquainted with it.</p>
               <p>But this was not what Alice had anticipated in the marriage relation. She loved her husband and appreciated his talents; she had thought their intellectual tastes would harmonize, so that they might drink from the same fountains of knowledge. This had been her ideal of hapiness, and when Mr. Menton offered her his hand and heart, she thought him to be the person above all whom she had ever met, who came so near her standard.</p>
               <p>But Alfred Menton found plenty of literary society among his male acquaintances, and when ever he found any leisure time to devote to his young wife, it was a relief to him to converse on some light subjects, and though he was kind enough in his way, he preferred to have her join him in some amusement or recreation, rather than to consult her wishes, and talk upon intellectual pursuits that were as dear to her as him. She had trusted her whole happiness upon the waves of conjugal love, and it had foundered among the rocks and breakers of literature.</p>
               <pb n="64-65" xml:id="VAC6293-00000033"/>
               <p>Dora saw enough during her visit to convince her that Alice would never lead a happy life with Alfred Menton, and what made it doubly painful was that she truly loved her husband, and all the society in the world would not compensate to her for the loss of his.</p>
               <p>She saw that Alice longed to speak to him of those things in which she was equally interested as he, but the idea always seemed so foreign to his mind, that feelings of delicacy and pride alike forbade their utterance.</p>
               <p>Hermione and Dora visited her as often as circumstances would permit, and each time it seemed to them her countenance wore a paler hue, though she endeavored to hide her sadness under a forced smile. She had been married but a few short months, yet there was a great alteration, in her general appearance. She always spoke of her husband with great kindness, and when mention was made, in her presence, of some speech he made in Congress, that had received much praise, her face would light up with pleasure, and her eyes speak the delight she felt in his success. And that wife was fully capable of sympathyzing with her husband in the attainment of his literary laurels, but he did not appreciate it. When the applauses of an assembly were sounding in his ears, he could rise, and in tones the most engaging, and words the most grateful, respond to their thanks. But when in his home, his wife ventured to speak about the same, he would generally turn the conversation as soon as possible by saying, well Alice I am glad you were pleased with it; but I have only a few moments to be with you, let us dismiss all literary subjects and enjoy some light conversation. Little did he think how much pleasure it would have given her to have pillowed his head upon her bosom, and talked over his present and future success. He did not perceive how selfish he was, and as Alice always yielded with apparent cheerfulness to his request, he did not know the sacrifice she made uncomplainingly for his sake, and thought he possessed a treasure in so obliging a wife.</p>

               <p>SEVERAL months after the marriage of Alice, Dora received a letter from her brother in Italy; he gave her a glowing description of the country, and was enthusiastic in his admiration of the noble art in which he was interested, and of the works of ancient artists, who long ages since had mingled with the dead, but whose works lived after them. Can it be, said he, dear sister, that God entrusted this heaven-born-gift to men, merely for the brief space of an earthly existence, and at death they are to be divested of all interest in the art? No! something within my soul exclaims, if not permitted to guide the pencil as on earth, yet they may influence others who are interested ed, and often when laboring over some beautiful picture, my pencil seems guided by an unseen influence. Does it not look reasonable dear sister?</p>
               <p>He longed to meet again with the loved ones at home, but he experienced a greater joy in dwelling in the land of song, and contemplating the works of art than he had anticipated in his wildest dreams of fancy, in his childish days. To his mother, he wrote, never before dear mother did I so appreciate your worth, as now that I am denied the refreshing smile of your countenance. When the evening draws to a close I long to hear your sweet "good night," but I know it cannot be, and endeavor to forget in soft slumbers the memory of "sweet home."</p>
               <p>At the conclusion of his letter he says, sister mine, to press one kiss upon your pure brow, would give me more pleasure than ever before; we are not apt to value blessings until deprived of them, and I knew not the prize of a sister's love till now. Dearest Dora how much zest would be added to my pleasure in admiring these noble works of art, if you were only present to point out with your sweet voice the varied beauties.</p>
               <p>He spoke of Hermione, but in such a manner that<pb n="68-69" xml:id="VAC6293-00000035"/> no one would have imagined he had ever been an humble suitor for her favor. She had given her refusal so kindly, that its memory caused him no mortification, and only strengthened that friendship for her which she had assured him would never prove anything stronger.</p>
               <p>Deem him not heartless reader, or be led to believe that "absence conquers love," when I tell you that he had schooled his heart into the belief that what Hermione had said was correct, and that he would live to see the day when he would thank her for the refusal. He had been much among Italy's fair daughters, and his heart told him that they, with their impulsive natures, were much more suited to his taste than Hermione; for though his respect for her might have strengthened with years, that the cords that bound them could never have been so tender; for with the many fine traits in her character, there was blended a certain coldness that would have ill suited his affectionate disposition in a wife.</p>
               <p>Think not by this that he had again fallen a victim at the shrine of love; for while he admired many, his heart was free from bondage to any.</p>
               <p>After Dora had again and again read over her broth er's epistle, she felt his absence more than before, and was about putting on her bonnet for a walk, in hopes to dissipate thoughts that made her feel unpleasantly, when the servant announced Doctor Abbott, who had called to take her out for a ride; he was entirely indifferent as to what direction they pursued, and when Dora proposed a call upon Alice, he was happy to accommodate her.</p>
               <p>They found her at home and alone in her parlor. She appeared much pleased to see them, but there was a forced cheerfulness in her manner, that one as well acquainted with her as Dora could not fail to observe.</p>
               <p>"Is your husband at home?" inquired Doctor Abbott.</p>
               <p>"He is," replied she, "but I beg you will excuse him, for he is unusually occupied just now in preparing a political address; he had his dinner sent into his study to-day, he was so much engaged; I do not like to interrupt him, or else I would call him to go over the grounds with you, they look beautifully at this season of the year."</p>
               <p>She said this with a forced smile, but Dora perceived how much pain it gave her to be deprived of her husband's society.</p>
               <pb n="70-71" xml:id="VAC6293-00000036"/>
               <p>"You have a beautiful place here; you must enjoy it much, as I think I have heard you remark you preferred living in the country," said Doctor A.</p>
               <p>"It is a lovely spot," said she, and without making any other remarks invited them to a walk in the garden. She pointed out her most cherished flowers, and showed to them a beautiful fountain then in play, with numerous tiny fish sporting in its basin, and at the foot of the garden a fine large pond, on whose smooth glassy surface floated a small boat.</p>
               <p>"This is the most attractive feature of your place," said Doctor Abbott, "[suppose you spend many hours sailing about here; it must be beautiful by moonlight."</p>
               <p>"Sailing is a favorite amusement of mine," said she, "but Alfred has so little leisure, that I do not enjoy it as much as I otherwise should."</p>
               <p>Dora could see through the veil of assumed cheerfulness, that there was unhappiness in the young wife's heart; she had not married for a handsome house, costly furniture and beautiful grounds alone, but she had thought to enjoy them with one suited to her; and that each beauty would possess a new charm, because enjoyed with the husband of her choice.</p>
               <p>When they returned to the house, she remarked to Dora, that the friends of the political party to which her husband belonged, were about to give a large party.</p>
               <p>"Do you think of attending?" inquired Dora.</p>
               <p>"My husband is very anxious for me to do so," said she, "but I believe I am growing old, for I cannot arouse any feelings of pleasure in the anticipation of the event, though I believe it is going to be a very brilliant affair."</p>
               <p>During the afternoon Dora noticed once or twice a cough that sounded unpleasantly, and ventured to ask Alice if she felt as well as usual.</p>
               <p>"I have not felt quite well of late, but I attribute it to a cold that has been about me for some time," she replied.</p>
               <p>Alice urged them to remain to tea; when it was announced, she sent to the study to see if Mr. Menton was able to leave his writing, but he begged to be excused, as he felt that he had not a moment too much time to prepare his address.</p>
               <pb n="72-73" xml:id="VAC6293-00000037"/>
               <p>Alice could not disguise the disappointment she felt, but endeavored to make the meal pass as pleasantly as possible.</p>
               <p>On their way home Dora remarked to Doctor Abbott that it made her sad to find Alice looking so pale.</p>
               <p>"I never hear a cough like that, but what I feel unpleasantly, for though the person may think lightly of it, it is sure to prove of a dangerous character," Doctor Abbott replied.</p>
               <p>"Do you consider her case alarming?" inquired Dora.</p>
               <p>"I would advise you to avoid showing any feelings of uneasiness in her presence; though to be honest, I believe her sands of earthly existence will soon be run. But to one surrounded with every luxury as she is, and blessed with a husband whose eloquence is the talk of the world, the idea of death must be very painful; and if she was made aware of her situation, it might hasten on the termination."</p>
               <p>Dora had often heard Alice speak of her mother's sickness and death, which was consumption, and of a presentiment she always had that she should die of the same disease.</p>
               <p>"I cannot bear to think that we may soon be called to part with Alice. I do not believe Mr. Menton imagines the dangerous cause of her cough. I wish Mrs. Adams and Henry might return from Europe; she seems to have so few relatives, and her husband is so engrossed in his books, that he has no time to see the hold disease is taking of her."</p>
               <p>"It must be a great source of gratification to a wife," said Doctor Abbott, "to know that her husband possesses talents, that the whole world cannot but admire. I often wished I could have been endowed with some of natures most precious gifts, not altogether for the praise of the world, but that it might be appreciated by one who was a congenial spirit, and who shared with me every joy or sorrow; to receive approbation from such an one, whom I had chosen to be my bosom companion, would give me more real satisfaction, than to receive the applause of a nation."</p>
               <p>Dora well knew to whom his conversation referred, and the glance that she gave him spoke volumes as she replied, "do you not possess talents? You have a thorough knowledge of the human frame; and have you not conferred as great a blessing upon the present generation, by devoting your time to studying out means of preventing disease, and guarding people<pb n="74-75" xml:id="VAC6293-00000038"/> against violating nature's laws and being obliged to suffer the consequences, than he who may be gifted with a flow of language, or a pen of fire. Hundreds who have perused your works on the preservation of health, have had reason to bless you, and none could think for a moment that your motives were selfish, for there would be less by hundreds expended for Doctors fees, if mothers understood better their children's organizations. If you have been favored with this knowledge and have diffused it among others, are you not deserving the praise of the world as any?"</p>
               <p>These were sweet words of encouragement to the young student's heart, and it served to render his task lighter; and when he would sometimes become weary of dwelling so much upon the ills that afflict mankind, he would persevere, feeling that he had been encouraged by one he loved above all others, to go on in his good work.</p>
               <p>When Dora laid her head upon her pillow that night, she felt that if ever she became the wife of George Abbott, he would prove a more congenial companion than Alfred Menton had to Alice. And in her dreams, she formed many ideas of domestic bliss.</p>

               <p>SCARCELY three months from the events related in our last chapter, Dora received a hastily written note from Alice, inviting her to come and spend a few days with her; she wrote that she had felt quite unwell for a short time back, and believed she must be nervous, for she had been unusually low spirited of late. It seems to me if I can only have you, dear Dora, with your sunny face near me, it would drive away my melancholy feelings. I wish Aunt Adams was at home, I miss her so much. You know she always<pb n="76-77" xml:id="VAC6293-00000039"/> thought my nerves quite strong, but I find I cannot depend upon them now. Do come and make me a visit; we will ride, and walk and talk over old times. I feel it will quite refresh me. She spoke of her husband as being much engaged, so that she was very lonely."</p>
               <p>The next day Dora set out for her visit to Alice. She found her reclining on a lounge quite unwell, but she assured Dora she should feel better the next day; she was much fatigued that afternoon as she had had several callers.</p>
               <p>When Dora entered the breakfast room the next morning, she found Mr. Menton already there reading over the morning news.</p>
               <p>"How is Alice this morning," she inquired.</p>
               <p>"I believe she is growing rather lazy, at least, so I tell her, for she used to be a very early riser, but of late she has been quite the reverse," he answered.</p>
               <p>"Perhaps" said Dora, "she does not feel as well as usual, and is unable to rise as early as formerly."</p>
               <p>"It may be so, I believe she has been troubled with a cold of late; but once or twice she has not come down to the first or second bell, and hurrying breakfast on account of my studies, had seen nothing of her till night."</p>
               <p>"Does Alice rest well at night?" inquired Dora.</p>
               <p>"Well I hardly know," said he, "for I seldom leave my study until a late hour, and am then so much fatigued, that I sleep very soundly."</p>
               <p>At this time they heard the light footstep of Alice in the hall; as she entered the breakfast room, the fresh morning air lent a false glow of health to her cheek, her hair was neatly arranged, and her rose-colored morning dress was exceedingly becoming.</p>
               <p>As she bade them a pleasant "good morning," even Mr. Menton could not but observe her beauty.</p>
               <p>"I rather think" said he, "that you spend too much time at your toilet; Miss Grafton, and I have been in readiness for breakfast this some time; we shall laugh at you a little."</p>
               <p>"No indeed, I do not I hurried; more than usual this morning," said she, "but I fell into a very sound nap towards morning, and overslept myself. I hope you will excuse me for keeping you waiting."</p>
               <p>"Do you feel better this morning?" inquired Dora, surprised that Mr. Menton did not.</p>
               <p>"Oh, I feel nicely; I told you I should last evening," said she.</p>
               <p>"Did you not feel well yesterday?" inquired Mr. Menton, "I was not aware but what you did."</p>
               <pb n="78-79" xml:id="VAC6293-00000040"/>
               <p>"I was rather fatigued last eve, and retired early, and had fallen asleep when you came in from your study," she replied pleasantly.</p>
               <p>"Did you rest well through the night?" inquired Dora.</p>
               <p>"Pretty well," she replied, and then changed the conversation."</p>
               <p>Before Mr. Menton left the room he remarked, that he had in his pocket an invitation from a Mr. Bracket to attend a party at his house, early the next week. If agreeable to you ladies, we will attend, said he.</p>
               <p>At first thought, Alice felt as though her health would not permit of her going, but on second thought, she feared 'though her husband did not appear conscious of it, that she would not long be with him, to grant his requests. So she answered, "if agreeable to Dora, I shall be happy to do so."</p>
               <p>To this Dora readily assented, for she thought if Alice had the least inclination to attend, the change might be a benefit to her; at least it would take up her mind, and prevent her from dwelling too much upon her own feelings.</p>
               <p>When Dora was alone that morning (Alice having thrown herself down in an adjoining room and had fallen asleep) her thoughts reverted to the conversation tion at breakfast time. Thoughtless husband—because you have a wife who is uncomplaining, cannot you observe the pallor of her countenance,—does not that dry husky cough ever arouse you from your selfish slumbers, and warn you of the sleepless hours she is passing? thought Dora.</p>
               <p>No! your ears seem deaf to those signs that tell others of the near approach of death. You to whom each pain of <emph>hers,</emph> should have awakened sympathy in <emph>your</emph> heart. Think you not that the fate she sees approaching would not be robbed of half its sadness, could she lean upon an earthly as well as a heavenly arm to support her, through the valley of death. No! deluded one, you will not mark all this, till it is alas, too late. Then what remorse and anguish will fill your breast. There are some persons with whom there exists such a sympathy between the mind and body, that when one is affected the other suffers equally with it,—with such, when the mind is troubled, if the cause be not removed, the frail casement of clay gradually wears out, and premature death is the inevitable result. This was the condition of Alice; her mind being troubled, brought on the hereditary disease of her family. Who shall say but he who<pb n="80-81" xml:id="VAC6293-00000041"/> should have been her support, was to a certain extent accountable for the sojourn of one so lovely, being cut off so suddenly.</p>
               <p>When Alice awoke, she seemed considerably refreshed, and endeavored to interest herself in the preparations for the party.</p>
               <p>"We must go out this morning and make some purchases," said she; and then remarked jocosely, "I suppose Mr. Menton will expect us to be the bells of the evening; but for my own part I should much prefer to remain at home, and enjoy a social evening in the society of you and Alfred."</p>
               <p>"I shall not be able to dance," said Alice, "and I know that a claret velvet dress for the evening, is a favorite with Alfred, therefore I shall order one, with a suitable head dress."</p>
               <p>Dora, who could never refrain from dancing when in its midst, purchased a thin lemon-colored evening dress and white trimmings, with a pretty white wreath for her head.</p>
               <p>Alice admired Dora's taste, and tried to keep up an interest in the preparations, but it was evidently a great exertion for her to do so. Dora would notice, when she had been more than usually excited, the hectic flush would mount to her cheek, and the intervals of that disagreeable cough grow shorter. She would make no complaint, but lie down for a few moments and take a little rest.</p>
               <p>But the afternoon before the party, she seemed unusually prostrate, she complained through the day of acute pain in her left side, and some headache.</p>
               <p>"I am afraid you are exerting yourself too much dear Alice to think of going."</p>
               <p>"Oh no!" said she, "I am resting now, so as to feel able to attend, I would not disappoint Mr. Menton for the world. I shall feel nicely by tea-time; pray do not mention to him but what I am quite well; you know I can rest a whole week if I choose, after the party."</p>
               <p>When he came in to tea, Alice had risen from her couch, and met him with a sweet smile.</p>
               <p>"I really believe my wife grows handsome, Miss Grafton," said he; "I used to think her rather pale to suit my style of beauty, but this pure country air proves a fine rouge for her cheeks. I expect she will create quite a sensation this eve; I hope she will not be playing the coquette, for these married beauties are the most to be dreaded.</p>
               <pb n="82-83" xml:id="VAC6293-00000042"/>
               <p>Alice could not keep back an expression of pain, at his ill-timed joke. Such talk at any time was far from her taste, and especially at this time when she felt so little like joining in the gayeties of the season, except for his sake. Besides, she was conscious that she should not long be able to gratify him by attending, and she felt hurt that he did not seem to appreciate her motives.</p>
               <p>But he did not appear to notice the expression of her face, or it he did, did not divine its meaning.</p>
               <p>"Come ladies" said he, as he rose from the table, "do not spend to much time talking before you commence dressing; for you know females always were, and always will be, I suppose, lavish of the time they take to adorn their persons."</p>
               <p>Dora felt slightly piqued at this last remark, for she felt that it was not applicable to either Alice or herself, and she replied,</p>
               <p>"I suppose you think to the utter neglect of the intellect, Mr. Menton."</p>
               <p>"Oh I beg pardon, Miss Grafton, I meant nothing personal, I only referred to women in general, of course there are exceptions. Pray do not take any offense at my idle remarks, I am a great a mirer of female beauty.</p>
               <p>Dora had never seen Alice appear so ruffled, she was always so mild and gentle. Alice had never even insinuated to Dora but what she was perfectly contented in her marriage relation, but she well knew that no one could have been with them so much as Dora, and not perceive the deficiency in her happiness; and she knew that she felt indignant at his remarks, more for her sake than her own. She therefore playfully turned the conversation by saying:</p>
               <p>"You had better go to your study, Mr. Menton, and be expeditious in finishing the writing you said you were obliged to complete, or else we may have the opportunity of attributing our want of punctuality to your honored self, sir."</p>
               <p>"I believe I will profit by your hint, Mrs. Menton, so I will bid you adieu ladies, for the present." And with a gay smile he left the room.</p>
               <p>Alice sat for a few moments in silence, and then placing her eyes upon Dora with an expression of the deepest pain said:</p>
               <p>"Can it be, that I am failing day by day, slowly, perhaps, but surely, and my husband be the last one to perceive it;" she could say no more for tears checked her utterance.</p>
               <pb n="84-85" xml:id="VAC6293-00000043"/>
               <p>Dora had never heard Alice speak so discouragingly of herself before, and tried to comfort her.</p>
               <p>"I am not afraid to die, Dora; I consider that a relief to the fettered spirit. But it makes me sad to see Alfred so unconscious of the approach of the messenger; it would give me so much pleasure to converse with him, upon our probable separation, and prepare him for it; but I cannot make up my mind to do so; and the shock will come upon him unawares I fear."</p>
               <p>Dora knew not what reply to make, but advised her to give up all idea of attending the party, but Alice seemed determined to go. She begged Dora not to tell Mr. Menton but what she felt as well as usual. Dora complied with her request, but made up her mind to tell him the next day, the delicate state of his wife's health.</p>
               <p>There was a look of pride upon the face of Alfred Menton, as he gazed on his young wife, after she was attired for the evening; her velvet robe was fitted beautifully to her fine form, and her head-dress was exceedingly becoming. His gaze seemed fastened upon her, there was a strange unearthly beauty in her eye, and her cheeks were flushed with excitement and fatigue.</p>
               <p>They set out in a close carriage, and Alice seemed very cheerful. Mr. Menton seemed much more attentive than usual, and Dora really hoped that the change might be beneficial to Alice.</p>
               <p>As they entered the brilliantly lighted room, many were the admiring glances thrown upon young Menton and his lovely bride; he could not fail to perceive how much attention she attracted, and it flattered his pride.</p>
               <p>Dr. Abbott, who had accompanied Dora, soon persuaded her to join the merry dancers. She was admired as a partner, and there were so many who were anxious to secure her hand, that it was with difficulty she could excuse herself, so as to spend some of her time with Alice, to join her in those amusements that required less exertion.</p>
               <p>Alice was conversing, in the course of the evening, with an elderly gentleman, when a politicial friend of Mr. Menton came up and said,</p>
               <p>"You have a splendid looking wife Menton! proud enough of her I suppose? you ought to be, at any rate."</p>
               <p>Mr. Menton looked towards her, he had always considered her good-looking; but that night there<pb n="86-87" xml:id="VAC6293-00000044"/> was a peculiar expression about her face, that almost held him spell-bound; he stood looking at her intently for a few moments, and then replied that he had reason to be proud of her, for she was a most excellent wife.</p>
               <p>By midnight, Dora noticed, though Alice made no complaint, that she was much fatigued, and urged her to request Mr. Menton to order the carriage; but he, at that time, was much engaged in conversation with some gentleman, and she would not have him disturbed.</p>
               <p>About an hour after this, Dora was startled by the cry, "<emph>she's fainted,</emph>" from one part of the room, and then there was a great confusion; she thought at once of Alice, and hastened to the spot in time to see her resting on a lounge, in an apparent unconscious state, while Mr. Menton was bending over her in great agony, with Dr. Abbott applying restoratives.</p>
               <p>Dora supposed that she was over-fatigued and had fainted from exhaustion; but when Dr. Abbott informed her that she had ruptured a blood-vessel in coughing, she was much alarmed, and hastened the preparations for conveying her home.</p>
               <p>Every exertion was made to bring her to consciousness ness, and as soon as she revived sufficiently, the carriage was ordered. Dr. Abbott returned with them and prescribed for her. Dora remained by her couch, but she did not seem to regain her strength, and coughed violently. She seemed to have her perfect senses and was very calm; but the shock to Mr. Menton was so sudden, that it almost over-powered him; he was a tireless watcher by her bedside, and appeared almost frantic, if a word was spoken in his presence of the imminent danger her life was in.</p>
               <p>Dr. Abbott called the next morning, and when Dora accompanied him from the room, he frankly told her that Alice could not survive but a few weeks at best, and he thought it right that Mr. Menton should be informed of it, as there was danger of her passing away suddenly, and the shock might be too much for him.</p>
               <p>As Dora turned from the hall door, she met Mr. Menton whose haggard countenance told what anxiety of mind he was suffering.</p>
               <p>"Let us go into the parlor for a few moments," said Dora.</p>
               <p>He followed, much agitated, for he had been startled by the illness of Alice the previous evening, and read in the countenance of Dora that the Doctor<pb n="88-89" xml:id="VAC6293-00000045"/> had spoken unfavorably of the case; but he was not prepared to hear that she was so near her end. Mr. Menton really loved Alice as well as he was capable of loving any thing besides his books.</p>
               <p>She saw that he was anxious to know what the Doctor thought of the case, but she dreaded to inform him of the alarming state of her health.</p>
               <p>"I am afraid," said she, "that the exertion Alice made last night to attend the party in her delicate state of health, was too much for her. I have wished for some time to speak to you of this matter, as I knew that Alice was one who would never complain, but have refrained from doing so on her account, as she always appeared so unwilling to have any mention made of it to you. She was unable to make the exertion that she did last evening, but it was entirely for your sake, as she did not want you to be disappointed."</p>
               <p>"You say her health has been failing; she has never mentioned it to me. I have noticed, some times, a slight cough, but supposed it was caused by a severe cold. I have thought of late, that she looked unusually well, she has had such a fine color."</p>
               <p>"You have mistaken the hectic flush for the glow of health," remarked Dora.</p>
               <p>He rose to his feet and exclaimed, "for heaven's sake Miss Grafton, tell me if Alice is in a decline?"</p>
               <p>"Doctor Abbott fears that her case is a hopeless one, it has been neglected too long."</p>
               <p>Her words sent a thrill to his heart; he realized the true condition of her health for the first time; and he felt that if he was called to part with her, her loss could never be made up to him. True he had married from selfish motives; but Alice, by her acts of kindness and attention, had learned him to so depend upon her for so many comforts, that he felt that even his books would lose their charm if deprived of her society.</p>
               <p>He threw himself upon the lounge, and burying his face in his hands, remained some time in troubled thought, as was evident from his frequent and long-drawn sighs. He feared that he had not been to her the husband that he ought to have been; and now, when it was too late, he would have given worlds had he possessed them, to have recalled her again to health.</p>
               <p>His home had been made a paradise to him by her presence; for where Alice was, there order and regularity reigned. Who now, with ready hand, would bathe<pb n="90-91" xml:id="VAC6293-00000046"/> his burning brow, when over-tasked with study? Who, with soft voice and winning smile, would soothe him when agitated, and place beside the cheerful fire his chair and slippers, and endeavor, by every art in her power, to render his few leisure moments, pleasant and inviting?</p>
               <p>That his love for her had been extremely selfish, he now seemed to realize for the first time; and the thought that she might soon be taken from him, almost drove him distracted. Willingly would he have devoted his life to her, if she could have been spared to him. He rose and paced the room in agony.</p>
               <p>To do Alfred Menton justice his selfishness was not so much the fault of his heart as his education. He was an only child, and when quite a boy, displayed unusual talent for one so young; and by a proud, indulgent father, (his mother having died at his birth,) he had been allowed every privilege if he would but apply himself to his books; he was permitted to call upon any one in the house to do his bidding, and he never dreamed that he was under the least obligation to any one for so doing. As he grew older, he went but little into female society, and never thought of wedding ought else but his books, till the death of his father caused the care and management of the house, to fall upon him, and he thought to marry to get rid of it. He looked about him for a suitable person to become his companion, and his choice fell upon Alice Gleason, the cousin of his friend, Henry Adams.—Henry rather encouraged the matter; for he had always known Alfred Menton, as a young man of excellent moral character, and knew him to be possessed of fine intellectual powers. He thought that Alice would be pleased with him, as indeed she really was. If he had better understood Alfred's motives in seeking a wife, he would have been less in favor of Alice consenting to become his bride. He was naturally a good dispositioned person; and if his youthful days had not been so warped into selfishness, by an over-indulgent parent, or if from childhood he had not been deprived of female influence, of a mother's tender love and sister's affection, he would have regarded women in their true character, and understood better their natures. Alice was dearer to him than he had ever imagined her to be; she had never appeared half so beautiful to him, as she did the eve before she was taken sick.</p>
               <p>"I must go to her," he exclaimed at last; "but I cannot,<pb n="92-93" xml:id="VAC6293-00000047"/> Oh! I cannot meet the gaze of those beautiful eyes, soon perhaps to be closed in death, and I—Oh God! the thought is maddening—perhaps her murderer;" he sank down and wept like a child.</p>
               <p>Dora had not expected to see him thus affected, and her kind heart ached for him. She could see him now in his true character, which had been well nigh blotted out by his erroneous education. She endeavored to console him by the thought, that while there was life, there was hope; that Doctor Abbott would do all in his power for her restoration, besides he could consult with other physicians. She hinted, as gently as possible, considering his agony of mind, of the comfort it would be to Alice, to have his society, and to converse with him on their probable separation.</p>
               <p>"Why could I have been so blind as not to have seen the approach of this disease, that has so nearly consumed her. I see now my selfishness to its full extent; I, who should have been the one to have smoothed her pathway to the tomb, have been the last to see her hastening to it. If gold would restore her to health, how gladly would I sacrifice my last dollar to obtain it. But, alas! I see now, when it is <emph>too late,</emph> that she has been a faithful, but disappointed wife, and <emph>I</emph> so much engrossed in my book, that I knew it not."</p>
               <p>Dora pointed out the bright hopes that Alice entertained, of the world to which she was hastening; and of the few years that would probably elapse, before they would be re-united. She succeeded in composing him so that he could at last catch a glimpse of the silver lining of the cloud that threatened to envelope <emph>him</emph> in total darkness.</p>

               <p>ALICE grew weaker every day; and felt persuaded in her own mind, that she should never recover; but she was perfectly resigned. She became so comfortable as to be able to ride out occasionally, a short distance; and Mr. Menton was but too happy to accompany her; he seemed determined in the short time she might be spared to him, to make up, if possible, by every attention, for past neglect.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Adams and her son had been travelling in Europe most of the time since the marriage of Alice—they were now expected home daily; Dora did not feel willing to leave Alice until they arrived, as she had no near relative to be with her, and they felt almost a sister's love for each other.</p>
               <p>Alice longed to see her aunt and cousin; but she knew how sad it would make them, on their return, to find her so ill; it would be like bringing afresh her mother's sickness, to Mrs. Adams.</p>
               <p>As soon as they arrived, they hastened to her. To Mrs. Adams, Alice had supplied the place of a daughter, and to Henry, she had been dear as a sister.</p>
               <p>When Mrs. Adams entered her chamber, she found Alice supported by pillows, in an easy-chair, by a window that opened into a large and beautiful garden; Mr. Menton was conversing with her, and Dora was arranging her pillows more comfortably. When she looked upon the pale and wasted, but still beautiful countenance of Alice, and noticed her slender and pined hands, so delicate that each blue vein was distinguishable; she so resembled her mother a short time before she died, that it was with difficulty she could control her agitated mind; but Mrs. Adams was, as we have before stated, a woman of strong mind, and she feared the effects of any excitement upon her niece, and while she pressed a kiss upon her pure white foreherd, spoke cheering words of hope.</p>
               <p>"You must go at once, my dear, to a balmier clime; I will go with you; your father always repented<pb n="96-97" xml:id="VAC6293-00000049"/> pented that he had not persuaded your mother to do so—he thought it might have lengthened her days."</p>
               <p>Alice looked up with a sweet smile: "No, dear Aunt. It is already too late; I shall soon join my loved parents in heaven; and I would prefer to die at home, surrounded by familiar scenes and faces, and to be laid beneath the shade of the same willow tree that covers their grave."</p>
               <p>Mrs. Adams could not keep back the tears.</p>
               <p>"Do not weep, dear Aunt, for me," said she. "I am young, perhaps, to die; but death looks beautiful to me; a few pangs to be sure are suffered when the spirit leaves the body to be robed in celestial beauty—but then what is that to a life in the spirit land. Death is but the bridge between life and the joys of immortality, and to the aspirant of heavenly joys, the task of passing is but a trifle. It is hard to part with those we love, I know—but then we have the assurance that we shall soon be re-united. Is it not a beautiful thought, dear Aunt, that we are placed in this world only for a season and that 'by the beauty and the grief, we are preparing for the skies;that we shall soon leave this state of existence, where there is so much sickness and sorrow, for a better land. Dear Aunt, this is not mere talk to soothe you; no, it comes from the depth of my inmost soul; and now that I firmly believe, that the disembodied spirits are permitted to watch over the loved ones they leave on earth, to impress them with high and holy thoughts, and strengthen them when they are faint-hearted—the parting seems less painful than ever."</p>
               <p>Mrs. Adams wept in silence. Dora came and bathed the fevered brow of Alice, and advised her to lie down, as she feared the consequence of any over-exertion upon her delicate system.</p>
               <p>On the next day Henry went in to see Alice; he was young, and of a more impulsive nature than his mother, and could not so well control his feelings at finding Alice so ill; he gave way so freely to his grief, that Mrs. Adams thought it best for him to leave the room, till he should become more composed. Dora, like a good angel as she ever was to those who were in trouble, followed him from the room, and laying her hand upon his shoulder as she would upon a brother's, strove to calm his agitated feelings; he struggled for a few moments, and then returned in a calmer frame of mind.</p>
               <p>Alice extended to him her hand, and he pressed the<pb n="98-99" xml:id="VAC6293-00000050"/> thin fingers to his lips, while the big tears rolled down upon it.</p>
               <p>"We have been as dear to each other as brother and sister, Henry; I am thankful that we are permitted to meet again on earth. <emph>I</emph> have nearly performed the duties assigned me to act in the great drama of life, <emph>you</emph> are still an actor on its stage; strive to perform well your part, so when the curtain falls upon you, as it is about to do on me, you may receive the praise of the great master."</p>
               <p>Mr. Menton feared that Alice had been too much excited, and that it might hasten her death; but he need not have indulged any such fears, for Alice had almost lost those violent emotions, that are continually haunting us in the earth-life, and lived more like a spiritual than a mortal being; her mind seemed to receive a calmness and repose from a higher source. Who shall say but parental love was supporting her through the valley of death. She knew the messenger would soon come for her, but she was ready and waiting for him.</p>
               <p>One of her greatest blessings she enjoyed was the tender care of her husband. He seemed to anticipate her every wish; he devoted his time entirely to her, and lavished upon her every comfort and luxury He had acknowledged to her his past faults, and humbly begged her forgivenesss. And his society was indeed a treasure to her, in these, her last hours.</p>
               <p>They were all in her chamber one afternoon—the Doctor had told them that she was liable to drop away at any moment, and all felt anxious to be near her. She had appeared very free from pain through the day, and now sat bolstered up in bed, her husband sitting near her, so as to pass her her drinks, and tend upon her every want. Dora had been reading to her from a book full of sublime thoughts of a future existence; Alice lay with her hands clasped, drinking into her soul the beautiful sentiments as they came to her from the sweet-toned voice of Dora.</p>
               <p>The last rays of the setting sun were shedding their beams o'er earth, and all nature seemed hushed into repose, as if preparing for rest, when Dora closed the book she had been reading; none seem disposed to break the spell of silence.</p>
               <p>Alice remained in the same attitude with her thin hands clasped, and her beautiful eyes gazing upon the last rays of the sun as it was about to wrap the earth in the mantle of night. They pushed aside the curtains that she might enjoy it to the last.</p>
               <pb n="100-101" xml:id="VAC6293-00000051"/>
               <p>Presently her thin lips parted with a smile of heavenly beauty, and in a low voice she said, "how sweet to die at such an hour surrounded by one's dear friends; methinks the spirit would more easily soar away from earth, under so harmonious circumstances, than if condemned to die in foreign lands, with no loving hand to smooth the dying pillow.</p>
               <p>"It may be the effects of a diseased imagination, but I feel that I shall never witness the rising of the glorious orb of day, whose setting has just filled our souls with admiration for its great Creator. My tired spirit longs to be free, and wing itself away to its home in heaven. Yet I am willing to bide the time of the messenger that is to call me hence. I feel my dear ones, that the hour of parting draws nigh. It is hard to sever even for a season, those cords that have bound us so firmly together. But the hope of re-union soothes the pangs of parting.</p>
               <p>"My dear husband, strive to check those sobs. I know your heart is torn, but remember my sufferings will soon be over, that ere long I shall lay this body down in the sweet repose of death, and that my spirit will have found its home in heaven. I will not say weep not for me, for Jesus wept; and there is solace in tears; come often to my grave when I am gone, and let your tears flow for me not in sorrow, but in joy, for 'I shall still live,' but in a happier existence. Let my death only serve to strengthen our love; remember that I have only gone a little before, and that you will soon have done with things of earth, and come to join the number in heaven, never more to part."</p>
               <p>"My much loved Aunt, you who have so well supplied a fond mother's love, to you I must soon say farewell. 'Tis like sundering the tie of mother and child. But what is your bereavement compared with the slave mother's? No brutal hand stands ready to force me from your embrace, regardless of your agonizing cries, to carry me into scenes you know not whither, far more wretched than words can picture; to doom, perhaps, not only my body to degradation, but to plunge my soul into sins of the darkest dye. No, to you the boon is granted to see your loved one pass from you to eternal joys, while loving friends stand round to make the passage sweet, and angels are waiting to welcome me to a heavenly home. But I die with the satisfaction of possessing your love, and that you have made many a sad hour<pb n="102-103" xml:id="VAC6293-00000052"/> happy, and soothed me with your presence in my dying hour. My mother in heaven, no doubt, looks down upon you with gratitude, for the love you have borne her child. I have always been attached to you on earth, doubtless that affinity will exist after death."</p>
               <p>"Henry, my dear brother, for such I have always felt you to be, we must soon be separated. When you parted from me to journey to a foreign clime, the thought that cheered <emph>me,</emph> was the hopes of <emph>your</emph> return. <emph>I</emph> am now to embark on a journey, but the day is not far distant when <emph>you</emph> will follow, and soon we shall be united in our haven of rest. Your days on earth will probably be chequered with joys and sorrows, but dear Henry preserve your integrity and virtue, and strive to keep yourself free from the pollution and sins of the world. Endeavor to make your life christlike, so that when called to go above, you may be prepared for immortal joys."</p>
               <p>"To you, my dear Dora, my farewell comes last. No tie of kindred binds our hearts, but congeniality of spirit has made our friendship very strong. You have shared with me pleasures in my hours of health, and have remained by my couch of pain like a ministering angel in my time of suffering. To you I say adieu; not forever; no, in a few short years you will join the spirit throng. We have loved on earth—shall we not love in heaven?—Our voices have oft blended in harmony on earth, shall we not tune our harps to the same sweet music, in heaven? But my loved ones, I shall weary you; strength has been granted me to bid you all farewell; but the angels are beckoning me away. Read to me, Dora, those beautiful lines I copied and requested you to read in my dying moments."</p>
               <p>Dora took from a draw the carefully written verses, and her soft lute-like voice trembling, commenced; yet the consoling and inspiring words of the Poet strengthened her as she proceeded: <q>
                     <lg type="quotation">
                        <l>"Strong as the death it masters, is the hope</l>
                        <l>That onward looks to immortality;</l>
                        <l>Let the frame perish, so the soul survive,</l>
                        <l>Pure, spiritual and loving. I believe</l>
                        <l>The grave exalts, not separates, the tie</l>
                        <l>That holds us in affection to our kind.</l>
                        <l>I will look down from yonder pitying sky,</l>
                        <l>Watching and waiting those I loved on earth,</l>
                        <l>Anxious, in heaven, until they too are there.</l>
                        <l>I will attend your guardian angel's side,</l>
                        <l>And wipe away your faults with holy tears;</l>

                        <l>And when, at length, death brings you to my love,</l>

               </p>
               <p>When Dora ceased, Alice called them to her bedside, and gave to each a kiss, and then sank into a sweet sleep from which she awoke only to whisper farewell.</p>

               <p>WHEN Mr. Menton knew that Alice was no more, he gave no sound of agony, but sat beside her corpse as one motionless in despair. They endeavored to persuade him to seek his rest; but he seemed not to hear what they said. Dora stole softly to the room before retiring, to kiss the inanimate clay of one whom she had loved so well. She was surprised to find Mr. Menton still a watcher there; he sat holding a little memento Alice had given him a short time before her death, and desired him to cherish for her sake. As Dora imprinted a kiss upon the marble forehead of the dead, his tears which had before refused to flow, now burst forth in torrents. Dora felt that these tears would bring relief to his bereaved soul. Kneeling there in the chamber of death, she lifted a prayer to heaven for the poor mourner, that this present affliction might indeed work out for him an exceeding<pb n="106-107" xml:id="VAC6293-00000054"/> weight of glory. His tears continued to flow, but they served to calm his troubled soul. Dora rose, and coming near to where he sat, said, with a voice that brought healing in its tones, <emph>Jesus wept;</emph> and quietly left him with the dead.</p>
               <p>Every thing that could rob death of its terrors, was done at the burial of Alice. A casket coffin was procured, and as Alice lay in it the day of her funeral, wrapped in a beautiful white cashmere robe, with a sprig of mignonette in her hand, and a smile upon her countenance, one would have almost exclaimed "she is not dead but sleepeth." They buried her in Auburn's sacred shades. When Mr. Menton went to take a last look of all that was earthly of his lovely wife, his grief knew no bounds; and they were obliged to use some persuasion to get him from the place where they had lain her. He returned to his home a sadder but a better man, determined to lead a different life in future, to follow the advice of the departed, and spend more of his time and money for the good of others.</p>
               <p>Not a week passed that he did not visit her grave, and kneeling beside the mound that covered her, pray for strength to perform manfully the battle of life, and be prepared to enjoy the same joys with her in heaven. Sometimes in those moments a sweet peace would fall upon him, and he would feel his task to be an easy one. Might not this influence have descended from her who had loved him so sincerely on earth; perhaps she hovered near to pour into his bleeding soul, the balm of gilead; he felt that it was so, and it served as a staff for him to lean upon through his pilgrimage on earth.</p>
               <p>Dora had promised Alice that she would come often to her grave, and lay upon it her offering of flowers; she was faithful to her promise. It was a sweet sight to see her bending at the white headstone, on whose smooth surface was inscribed simply, "Alice's grave" (she had requested her friends to have no other epitaph than this, to mark where they had lain her,) and placing upon it sweet scented flowers. Dora enjoyed those moments; it seemed to her that an influx of heavenly joys flowed into her soul, that she experienced at no other season.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Adams and Henry neglected not her grave, but brought fragrant blossoms to wither there, as emblems of her who slept beneath, who, when dying, sent sweet fragrance all around.</p>

               <p>A FEW weeks after the death of Alice, Dora, who was now at home, was seated one evening with her father and mother and Dr. Abbott, who had called in to pass the evening. Their conversation turned, as it often did, upon the absent son and brother.</p>
               <p>"I should think by Fred's last letter, that he intended to return before long, should not you?" inquired Mrs. Grafton of her husband.</p>
               <p>"I should not be surprised to receive news by any mail, that he would be with us shortly," he replied.</p>
               <p>"Only think, it is nearly two years since Fred left us; it does not seem possible, to look back upon it, that it can be so long; though I thought when he went away, that two years would seem an age," said Dora.</p>
               <p>"Circumstances alter cases," said Mr. Grafton, glancing slily at Dr. Abbott. He was fond of a joke, and could never let so good an opportunity pass without one.</p>
               <p>"If you intend to infer sir that <emph>I</emph> have any thing to do with the <emph>circumstances</emph> to which you alluded, I am extremely grateful to you for the compliment," replied Dr. Abbott.</p>
               <p>He had scarcely ceased speaking, when the servant brought in a letter for Mr. Grafton. As soon as he glanced at the post-mark, "news from Fred," he exclaimed.</p>
               <p>Fred dwelt at some length upon the pleasure and satisfaction it had afforded him, to be able to perfect himself in that art, in which he had delighted from boyhood. He expressed his gratitude to his parents, for their love which had prompted them to consent to his going abroad, and the advantages of education they had bestowed upon him.</p>
               <p>"If," he continued, ''my success in after years be ever so great, I shall attribute it to you, my beloved parents."</p>
               <pb n="110-111" xml:id="VAC6293-00000056"/>
               <p>In the course of the letter, he wrote, "I suppose you will not always have Dora with you, for it intelligence travels across the water correctly, a certain Doctor, with whom I once made a slight acquaintance on an eventful afternoon, is about to claim her for a partner, whether in medicine or wedlock I leave you to judge. However, I shall put no obstacles in the way of their happiness, provided the gentleman in question, does not become too jealous of the love of his fair one, and feel that he may almost challenge even her brother, if, on his return, he should presume to embrace, or even go so far as to bestow a few kisses upon her."</p>
               <p>As Mr. Grafton read this, in the presence of her lover, Dora blushed crimson, but quickly replied,</p>
               <p>"The saucy fellow, I'll teach him better, when I see him, and in revenge for this, shower upon him such an amount of kisses, that he will be glad to beat a retreat to his quarters."</p>
               <p>"I rather think there is an undertone to all this," said Mr. Grafton; "let us read on and see. Ah! yes, here it is; ha, ha, master Fred, it seems your heart has not proved invulnerable to the charms of Italian beauty. "How is it Emma," said he to Mrs. Grafton, "is there room in your heart to receive another daughter."</p>
               <p>"If you mean," said Mrs. Grafton, "that Fred intends to bring with him a wife, I can readily answer yes; for I have little fear of his choice falling upon one, who would prove unworthy of our love.</p>
               <p>"Say dear father, is it as you insinuate? please take some pity on woman's curiosity and let me know if Fred intends to bring with him an Italian bride?" said Dora.</p>
               <p>"It is even so my daughter. He writes that he hopes to bring with him, one whom we shall delight to receive as a daughter and sister, and that we shall all approve his choice, for to know her is to love her."</p>
               <p>I hope soon to be with you. Nothing has occured during my absence to render our meeting painful; our family circle has not been broken by death, and soon, I trust, parents and children will be clasped in one fond embrace.</p>
               <p>Dora was delighted with the idea of having a sister to love; she had always longed for one. She could talk of little else during the evening.</p>
               <p>"Now Dora," said Mr. Grafton, "you will feel perfectly happy, for you will soon probably not only see your brother, but you will also have a sister to love."</p>
               <pb n="112-113" xml:id="VAC6293-00000057"/>
               <p>The next afternoon was a leisure one with Hermione; and Dora, who had been much deprived of her society during the illness of Alice, was glad to spend it with her.</p>
               <p>"I have a piece of news to tell you," she exclaimed almost as soon as they met. "Brother Fred is expected soon, and is to bring with him a bride." She would not have introduced the subject so abruptly, had she ever have known of the secret between Fred and Hermione.</p>
               <p>"I hope it may prove a happy match to her and all of you," she replied. "It certainly will be a great pleasure to you all to meet Fred once more. And it will be pleasant for your parents to have your loss supplied to them in a daughter-in-law."</p>
               <p>Hermione said this with her usual calmness. She thought to herself he had doubtless proved her words to him to be true, and thanked her in his heart for her refusal of his hand. He had probably found one who could return his love, and had never had the trials that she had to sadden her.</p>
               <p>"I used to think," said Dora innocently, "that I would give anything, when Fred was at home, if you could only become my sister; but now I suppose I must give up that idea."</p>
               <p>"I never suspected you of being a match maker Dora, do not destroy my good opinion of you."</p>
               <p>"Oh no! I wanted you to set your cap for him, and catch him, it would have been so sweet to have called you sister."</p>
               <p>As Hermione made no reply to this, Dora feared she had injured her feelings, and said pleasantly, "never mind my idle talk Hermione, all I hope is that I may love Fred's wife as well as I do you."</p>
               <p>"How long before you expect to see your brother."</p>
               <p>"He wrote that we might look for him the last of the month, and perhaps sooner."</p>
               <p>"Has he heard of the death of Alice?" asked Hermione. "I believe she was not married when he went away from home."</p>
               <p>"Yes; he received a letter from Henry with the news, before the one that I wrote reached him. It was very unexpected to him; when he left us, she appeared in perfect health. He says the last time he met with her, was that ride that we took, when we stopped at Mrs. Abbott's, on account of the rain; then she promised to enjoy as long a life as any one of us. He wrote that Henry appeared to feel her loss, as sensibly as though she were a sister."</p>
               <pb n="114-115" xml:id="VAC6293-00000058"/>
               <p>"Do you often see Mr. Menton now?" inquired Hermione. "It seems as though he must be very lonely."</p>
               <p>"He calls at our house quite often; and I think I never saw a greater alteration in a person in my life. He says that he feels the loss of Alice more and more, each day he lives. When we mentioned that Fred thought of marrying, he drew a deep sigh, and said, I must see Fred soon after he returns; I may be able to save him from many bitter reflections hereafter. I know that he is better fitted to become a husband than I, yet he has great love for his art; and without any intention, he may wound the heart of her he has sworn to cherish, by being too much bound up in it. God grant that never another may suffer the mental agony and remorse that I do. If some kind friend had pointed out to me before I embarked upon the sea of matrimony, the shoals and quicksands of domestic love, I might, perhaps, have sailed smoothly over its surface, and anchored at last safely in that port to which we are all hastening. I think, said he, that a newly married pair cannot receive too much wholesome advice, in regard to making life happy or miserable, and especially should they profit by the bitter experience of others."</p>
               <p>Doubtless, God bestows talents for some wise purpose, but heaven knows, gladly would I become the most obscure person, if I could but say of my married life, that I had devoted more of my time to my wife's happiness, so as to have made life pleasant and desirable to her.</p>
               <p>God grant that Fred may never become so engrossed in the noble art of painting, as to neglect her he has promised to cherish at the altar.</p>
               <p>"Poor man, I pity him;" said Hermione. "It always seemed to me, that nothing could be more painful than the memory of a departed friend, whom conscience is constantly reminding us we have wronged."</p>
               <p>"He says that nothing would tempt him to marry again, that if he was unfaithful to Alice in life, he will keep her memory sacred in death. You would be surprised to see how he values the simplest article that belonged to her," said Dora.</p>
               <p>"Well, as our conversation has turned upon marriage Dora, tell me frankly when we may expect your nuptial to be celebrated?"</p>
               <p>"You are really very personal, Hermione, but since 'frank confessions are good for the soul,' I shall<pb n="116-117" xml:id="VAC6293-00000059"/> not attempt to deny but what you may soon commence preparations to perform the duty of bridesmaid at the ceremony."</p>
               <p>"Really, I did not expect so hasty a summons, but I shall be only too happy, to officiate at so interesting a festival."</p>
               <p>Their conversation was interrupted by the supper bell; and the evening occupied in entertaining company.</p>

               <p>KATE HEBER, the affianced bride of Fred Grafton, was born in Italy. Her mother was pure Italian blood; but her father was of English origin. His parents died when he was quite young but left him in possession of a large fortune; he had great musical taste, and when he arrived at the age of manhood, determined to make Italy his future home. There he became acquainted with, and married a young girl of great beauty. Kate was the only offspring of this marriage. She inherited a large share of her mother's beauty. It was a matter of chance that Fred became acquainted with Kate.</p>
               <p>A gentleman, who proved afterwards to be the father<pb n="118-119" xml:id="VAC6293-00000060"/> ther of Kate, called one day upon Fred; he had heard of his skill in painting, and wished to test it. Kate had a beautiful black saddle horse of which she was very fond; she had often expressed a wish that she might have him painted, so that when he became old, and they would be obliged to lose him, she should have his picture to remind her of him.</p>
               <p>This led her father to conceive the idea of having the horse taken with his fair owner seated upon him; he had called that day to invite Fred to a trial of his skill in painting the picture.</p>
               <p>This, of course, during the time he was performing the task, led him often into the society of Kate. She had the true Italian warm-heartedness and none of English formality; and each time they met they seemed more interested in each other. Kate could not of course, be unconscious that she was beautiful, for this her mirror told her daily; but it caused her to put on no unnatural airs, she was as artless and unaffected as a child in her manners, and as joyous in her disposition. It is not strange that they should grow to love one another; for Fred was a noble looking young man, pure and chaste in his conversation, and possessed of great natural ability, and an excellent cellent education. At length he asked permission to visit her in her home. Mr. Heber could make no objections, for he liked the appearance of Fred, and he had inquired of those who were acquainted with him, and found his moral principles to be of a high character.</p>
               <p>This intimacy resulted in the offer of his hand in marriage to Kate; it was hard for those fond parents to part with their only child, and they knew that if they consented to her becoming his bride, that he would take her to his home; but it was evident that it would ruin Kate, if they should refuse, for her whole heart seemed bound up in him. They had perfect confidence in him who had won her love, and they felt that they should wrong their child, if they permitted their selfish love to come in between them and her happiness.</p>
               <p>"Take her," said Mr. Heber with emotion. "But remember that I entrust to your care, one who is dearer to me than life. Be faithful to the trust imposed in you, and may the blessing of heaven rest upon my future son."</p>
               <p>"In the sight of heaven, I promise, if God give me strength, to love and cherish fondly her to whom I am about to plight my troth," replied Fred.</p>
               <pb n="120-121" xml:id="VAC6293-00000061"/>
               <p>It was with difficulty the mother of Kate could be reconciled to parting with her daughter. She was her only child, and she had almost made her an idol Kate was possessed of an uncommonly pleasant and affectionate disposition, and all who knew her were deeply attached to her; but to her parents she was dear as life.</p>
               <p>It was a great heart-struggle with Kate, to think of leaving her parents; but as the young and trusting are always full of hopes for the future, she indulged bright dreams of future happiness in her American home.</p>
               <p>When the morning arrived for Fred to take his bride from her paternal roof, to seek a distant home with him, for whom she had forsaken all other ties of kindred, it was a trying time for both parents and child.</p>
               <p>Every preparation had been made to render her journey pleasant, that her father's purse could procure, or a fond mother devise. Her trunks now stood ready in the hall, and they knew that soon they must say "good bye." Her father came towards her, and folding her in one long embrace, called down heaven's blessing on the head of his child, and with a voice trembling with emotion bade her farewell.</p>
               <p>But when Kate turned to her mother, and found her unable to speak on account of her weeping, it entirely overcame her, and sinking upon the breast that had so often pillowed her head, from childhood to the present time, she wept mingled tears of joy and sorrow.</p>
               <p>"Go, my child," said her mother, as soon as she could compose herself enough to speak, "and may you be as great a treasure in the home you are about to seek, as you have always been in the one you leave."</p>
               <p>Then turning to Fred she continued,</p>
               <p>"You are about to take from its home, a cherished household plant, guard it well in a foreign clime, for the chill winds of adversity would prove fatal to one nursed so fondly in a genial atmosphere."</p>
               <p>The last adieus had been spoken, and Fred and Kate were on board the ship that was to waft them to American shores. They had a prosperous voyage, and arrived in safety one lovely day in spring. They took a carriage at the pier, which conveyed them direct to the door of Mr. Grafton.</p>
               <p>Fred stepped out, and then turned to assist his fair bride. Kate was clad in a neat travelling dress, and<pb n="122-123" xml:id="VAC6293-00000062"/> as she took the arm of Fred, to ascend the steps, she looked as happy as mortal need to; her beautiful olive complexion, rendered a shade darker by her sea voyage, and her dark eyes kindling with beauty.</p>
               <p>The family stood ready to receive them, and as Fred presented her as his wife, she returned their embraces with true Italian warmth of manner. Fred had so often conversed about his home and the dear ones there, that Kate almost loved them already.</p>
               <p>"I have been so long an exile from my home," said Fred, "that I must be excused if I appear as though I were a child again; for I have been so long banished, that it seems almost as though I were transported back to childhood's days."</p>
               <p>When Mr. Grafton came home to tea, he was delighted to meet again his son, and was no less pleased with the first appearance of Kate, than were Mrs. Grafton and Dora. The evening meal passed very pleasantly, for the family circle was now unbroken, and one had been added to their number who promised to become as much beloved as any.</p>
               <p>As Mrs. Grafton presided at the table that eve, she looked round upon her family with a feeling of deep joy in her heart. She had made her children and their best interests the study of her life, and she had been assisted in her task by a kind and judicious husband. Those children had now grown to the age of manhood and womanhood, and were about taking upon themselves the responsibilities and duties of life. But she had the sweet satisfaction of knowing that they went forth into the field, with a knowledge how to best perform those tasks that should fall upon them.</p>
               <p>The next Sabbath, Fred Grafton took his accustomed seat in the family pew, and not a few were the admiring glances thrown upon him, and his lovely bride.</p>
               <p>Time passed pleasantly at the Grafton's now; many were the rides, walks, and excursions enjoyed by the young people; in as many as it was possible, Doctor Abbott joined them, but his practise prevented him from enjoying as much recreation as he would have liked.</p>
               <p>The weather now began to be very warm, and a visit to the sea-shore was contemplated by them.</p>
               <p>As they would probably go in Hermione's vacation, Dora was anxious to have her make one of the party. She really felt the need of recreation, and now that her circumstances were such, that she was able to defray<pb n="124-125" xml:id="VAC6293-00000063"/> fray all her expenses, she had no hesitation in accepting their invitation for her to accompany them.</p>
               <p>She also persuaded her mother to leave the care of the family to an old and trustworthy servant, and go with her, as she thought it would be beneficial to her health.</p>
               <p>Mr. Grafton chose not altogether a fashionable resort, but one where they could enjoy the most rural pleasures.</p>
               <p>Doctor Abbott would be unable to be with them always through the week, but promised to come out as often as possible.</p>
               <p>Kate was delighted with the idea, and they all set out on the appointed day, in fine spirits. On their arrival they were much pleased with the spot Mr. Grafton had selected. It was not a hotel, but a private boarding house, where they only accommodated a few boarders, and situated in a romantic spot, some ways from the village.</p>
               <p>They searched the woods for every cool and shady retreat, and bathed on the shores; there were beautiful drives about the place, and they spent much of their time riding. In one of their rambles they were strolling along the beach, enjoying the cool breeze, when they missed Hermione from their number; they turned to look for her, and saw her seated a little distance from them, upon a projecting rock; she held a blank book in her hand, in which she seemed to have been writing the sublime thoughts with which her heart was filled. When they noticed her, she appeared to be wrapped in thought of the great Creator of all these wonders. It was a luxury to her to be thus free, and the sea-air seemed to invigorate her body and mind. They thought they would not disturb her meditations, and so walked slowly on.</p>
               <p>Hermione was so much absorbed in her musings that she did not notice the approach of footsteps, and started suddenly at the sound of her name, for the voice sounded familiar to her ear.</p>
               <p>She was surprised to see before her, he who had made life in its spring-time so cheerless and dark to her. She could hardly believe her own eyes, that the person before her could be Frank Landon; she had not seen him since the party at Dora's, nearly five years before. Directly after that, she heard that he embarked for Europe, expecting to remain there some time; she had during that time only heard his name mentioned a few times, and then in no very flattering manner.</p>
               <pb n="126-127" xml:id="VAC6293-00000064"/>
               <p>One more romantic than Hermione would have been affected considerable, under such circumstances but Hermione after she had recovered from the surprise, appeared as calm as usual, and bid him a formal good morning. But as he remained gazing at her with the freedom of an old and valued friend, she rose from her seat and prepared to walk away.</p>
               <p>"Stay Miss Phelps," said that voice who had poured words of love into her heart, that made sad desolation there.</p>
               <p>She heeded him not, but kept on her course, though he followed close beside her.</p>
               <p>"Are you walking alone Hermione, if so allow me to become your companion." This was said in the same winning manner that had once sounded like sweet music to her ear.</p>
               <p>She was surprised at his freedom in addressing her whom he had treated so meanly, in so familiar a manner. She turned now and fixing her dark penetrating eye upon him answered, "No! Frank Landon, the friends with whom I came are only a short distance from us. I wish now to join them, and I prefer to do so alone."</p>
               <p>He now placed himself directly in her path, so as to oblige her to listen to him. "Hermione Phelps, I will speak once more to you, though it should cost me my life. I once loved you, and I <emph>know</emph> you loved me."</p>
               <p>Hermione quailed not beneath the fiery glance of his handsome eye as he asserted this, but returned it with haughty scorn. "When poverty became your portion I left you, because I could not brook the idea that the world should know that I wedded a penniless bride. God knows how bitterly I have repented my rash act. But I dared not return to you, for I well knew with what biting sarcasm and withering scorn, you would receive a second offer of my hand. I sought other lands, and thought by mingling in the halls of festivity and mirth to find other attractions, that would cause me to forget your existence, but it mattered not where I was, whether in solitude or surrounded by friends, your image still haunted my memory."</p>
               <p>"You have now acknowledged the sordid motives of your love for me. No, Frank Landon, you feared what the world might say if you wedded a child of poverty; and you were influenced more by this, than the thought of the misery you would cause that heart you had taught to love you. You may deem me<pb n="128-129" xml:id="VAC6293-00000065"/> little given to woman's tenderness when I tell you, that what you may have suffered I consider only a just punishment, for the wretchedness you have caused another heart to feel. If you think my words unbecoming a woman, I have only to answer, search into the inmost recesses of my heart, and see if there were not enough of love and tenderness there, before the fatal blow you dealt, turned it into coldness. You now reap some of the bitter fruit you caused to be sown there."</p>
               <p>"I acknowledge my past errors, and as for riches, I have enough for both of us."</p>
               <p>"You had not <emph>once,</emph>" said Hermione, with a look of scorn, "and, if report speaks truly, you have not added to your store since then."</p>
               <p>"Do not taunt me with your sarcasm, is not my remorse a sufficient punishment to compensate for the wrong I may have done you? Have I not sought to find you ever since I returned, and traced you even to this secluded spot? and is this the only welcome I am to receive from you?"</p>
               <p>"You can expect none other," replied Hermione, coldly. "A few days, or even weeks, is nothing, spent in looking for an object, to a life darkened by the remembrance of a faithless lover."</p>
               <p>"Then naught that I can say will cause you to look with favor upon me?" said he, imploringly.</p>
               <p>"No, Frank Landon; to be sincere, I scorn your very name; but you have your revenge, for you have made my heart desolate. I will not attempt to deny that I have loved you devotedly, but I have schooled my feelings into bitter hatred, for one who cared not for my heart unless set in gold. I cannot put trust where I have once been deceived. Go, Frank Landon, and may that happiness that is denied me on earth, attend your way."</p>
               <p>"I will obey, but remember, when you hear another call me husband, that you might have enjoyed the same."</p>
               <p>"Do not flatter yourself by the belief that it would cause me one heart pang," she replied, haughtily.</p>
               <p>"Hermione Phelps!" he exclaimed, angrily, "you provoke me beyond endurance; but I will have my revenge. I will cross your path continually. I will seek a bride, and lavish upon her every luxury, and cause you to suffer from the green-eyed monster."</p>
               <p>"Leave me," said Hermione, in a commanding tone, "my friends are coming towards us."</p>
               <p>He looked towards the path, and saw forms coming<pb n="130-131" xml:id="VAC6293-00000066"/> near them. He turned upon Hermione, who stood motionless as a statue, and, with a look of revenge, turned down a path that led in a different direction.</p>
               <p>Hermione hastened to meet her friends, they had seen her from a distance, conversing with a gentleman, and they joked her about loitering behind to meet the stranger.</p>
               <p>Hermione merely replied that it was an old acquainance, whom she had not met for some time, and that she did not know he was in America, much more, so near to her; and then signified by her manners, that she wished nothing more said in regard to the matter. She was one who did not need to use words always to express her meaning. So there was no more mention made of it by any of the party.</p>
               <p>Kate frolicked along the beach, as gay as a child; occasionally she would run away from Fred, and amuse herself by skipping stones into the water—and then seat herself upon some low rock, and warble forth a sweet Italian melody, so silvery in its tones that all would hush their voices to listen to the strains as they came from the sweet songstress. Kate always allowed her auburn locks to flow in natural ringlets over her shoulders, and Fred Grafton thought, as he looked upon her sitting in some graceful attitude, the breeze toying among her curls, that it could not be sinful to worship so pure a being; she was one of nature's own children.</p>
               <p>"It is really refreshing," said Hermione, "in this weary, every day-world, to find occasionally one so free and happy as Kate. She must, I think have been born under some lucky planet, and sorrow's touch have never been her portion."</p>
               <p>"I trust she may never know its smart," said Fred, "for to one so sensitive as she, the effect, I fear, would prove fatal. I have often heard it remarked, that the most light-hearted oftentimes are the least calculated to rise above trials."</p>
               <p>"Why is it," said Dora, "that some escape trials almost entirely, while others seem weighed down beneath their burden; sorrow and care are not at all equally divided."</p>
               <p>Hermione replied, "circumstances, of course, cause the inequality; yet it is well that it should be so. Such glad, sunny faces as yours and Kate's, make happy those who are sad. You have your mission,<pb n="132-133" xml:id="VAC6293-00000067"/> and if it be not to take part in the bitter conflicts of life, you help others to be patient under their afflictions, which otherwise would be grievous to be borne. You, dear Dora, show to us the "silver lining of the cloud."</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XIV.</head>
               <p>THEY returned from their walk to the boarding house, and then in the afternoon all were engaged in watching for the stage in which they expected to see Doctor Abbott, Henry Adams and Mr. Menton.</p>
               <p>When the stage arrived it was unusually crowded; but they could distinguish within, the faces of their friends. As it drew up to the door and stopped, those they had expected alighted; and then an elderly gentleman requested the driver to stop a few moments while he stepped to the door, to inquire of the landlord if he could accommodate him with board, as he preferred if possible, to remain here, than to go on farther to the hotel. The host informed him that he could, and he returned to the stage and beckoned to some one within.</p>
               <p>In a moment, a young girl of graceful movement sprang to the ground, followed by another, who appeared<pb n="134-135" xml:id="VAC6293-00000068"/> peared about her age, but was dressed in simple Quaker garments, and whose manner was as unassuming as her dress.</p>
               <p>They entered the parlor where the Graftons and their friends were sitting. The young girl who had first alighted, proved to be very handsome; and as she entered the room in a graceful manner, and tossed from her rosy cheeks her pretty curls, she seemed perfectly conscious of her personal attractions.</p>
               <p>The young Quakeress, who possessed much beauty, seemed to think less of herself, than of the old gentleman whom she addressed as Uncle, and for whom she seemed to feel quite anxious, for fear he was fatigued.</p>
               <p>The new comers soon went to their rooms to adjust their toilet for tea; as the day had been very warm and dusty, the travellers needed to refresh themselves, after travelling so many miles in a stage-coach.</p>
               <p>"Did you make any acquaintance with your fellow-passengers?" asked Mr. Grafton of Doctor Abbott. "As they are the only boarders beside ourselves, I suppose we shall be thrown much in their company."</p>
               <p>"You must ask Henry," said Doctor Abbott; "for he seemed much pleased with the young ladies, especially the gayest of the two."</p>
               <p>"It appears to me you are using my name rather freely in that direction, gentleman. Will you inform me, Doctor, what authority you have, to say that I was pleased with one, more than the other. I confess that I scraped acquaintance for the sake of making a dull ride pleasant," said Henry.</p>
               <p>"I merely judged from appearances; my mother always taught me, that 'actions speak louder than words;' and if I could judge by that, the lady with curls, had decidedly the preference. If I could have felt your pulse, I might have been able to have decided more correctly."</p>
               <p>"She was very easy and social, and as I found by their conversation that they intended to stop at the same place, I thought I should be obliged soon to make their acquaintance, and I might as well make a virtue of necessity."</p>
               <p>"I had some very interesting conversation with the old gentleman coming down," said Mr. Menton, "he appears to be a fine old person, and these young ladies are his nieces of whom he has the charge, and he has come out to spend their vacations with them at the sea-shore."</p>
               <p>The old gentleman, whose name was Elliott, now<pb n="136-137" xml:id="VAC6293-00000069"/> came out upon the piazza, to enjoy the cool sea-breeze, amid the curling smoke of his Havana. Mr. Grafton sought the same retreat, and soon became much engaged in conversation with Mr. Elliott; while the young people were enjoying themselves inside.</p>
               <p>The two young ladies entered the room looking much refreshed, and Henry Adams, who had become acquainted with their names, introduced them to the company, and the two Misses Warren were soon made quite at home among them.</p>
               <p>At tea-time they all assembled in the dining-room with cheerful faces, with the exception of Mr. Menton, who had never worn a smiling face since the death of Alice. Hermione felt, or rather feigned unusual cheerfulness, for fear of marring the enjoyment of the rest. Mrs. Grafton was delighted to see the young people so happy, and the gentlemen, old and young, seemed in an exceedingly cheerful mood.</p>
               <p>Mr. Elliott addressed the two young ladies by the names of Adelaide and Lizzie.</p>
               <p>"Do you feel fatigued after your journey, Lizzie?" said he, addressing the Quakeress.</p>
               <p>"Not at all," she replied; "this fine air is so refreshing."</p>
               <p>"As to you, Adelaide," said he, "I suppose you would not acknowledge it if you were."</p>
               <p>"I don't know that I should," she replied; "but I enjoyed the ride greatly, and do not feel the least fatigued."</p>
               <p>After tea was over, they repaired to the parlor, to enjoy the beautiful twilight. "Music would sound sweetly at this hour; will not some of the young people favor us with a song?" said Mrs. Grafton.</p>
               <p>"Come, Dora, you are always obliging," said Henry; "if you commence, others will follow your example."</p>
               <p>"I would willingly comply," said Dora, "but I took so severe a cold last eve, that I fear should I attempt to sing, you would pray me spare your nerves, the sounds would be so discordant."</p>
               <p>"Perhaps one of the Misses Warren would favor us with a piece," said Mrs. Grafton.</p>
               <p>Adelaide replied with a graceful bow, while she shook the curls from her face in true coquette fashion; while Lizzie replied, in a modest manner, to their request.</p>
               <p>They played a very pretty duet together, and then Adelaide sung a song or two; after she left the piano,<pb n="138-139" xml:id="VAC6293-00000070"/> some one asked, "where is Kate? she is a child of song, and doubtless her heart, by this time, is longing to tune itself to some sweet melody."</p>
               <p>"Yes, Kate," said Dora, "please sing that sweet piece you were singing this morning on the beach."</p>
               <p>Kate glanced towards Fred, and read in his countenance a wish that she should comply; she needed no further urging. Fred led her to the piano, and seated himself a short distance from her in the soft twilight. She touched the keys of the instrument lightly, as a sort of a prelude, and then commenced a plaintive Italian air. Not a whisper was heard in the room; there is some mysterious power in music, that can awaken deep emotions in the breast. I do not think that a crime, even in thought, could be committed when the notes of some sweet, sad song were sounding near. It seems to subdue all selfish feelings, and fill our hearts with a pure love, for all that is beautiful.</p>
               <p>Fred looked upon his young bride with the admiration of a lover. After she had ceased playing, they formed again in groups, and commenced social conversation. The moon had now risen, and shed a silvery light around. The evening was beautiful, and a moonlight walk was proposed to the beach, which was only a short distance from the house.</p>
               <p>It fell to the lot of Henry Adams to gallant the Misses Warren, as their Uncle preferred to remain at home with Mr. and Mrs. Grafton.</p>
               <p>Doctor Abbott thought if Dora complained of a cold, she had better not go, but as she was very anxious, and promised to wear sandals, (a precaution all young ladies are not willing to take,) her friends consented.</p>
               <p>A moonlight scene upon the beach is always beautiful; but the peculiar shade the pale empress of night shed around at this time, was unusually lovely. It was so still that they could distinctly hear the dipping of the boatman's oar upon the water, as he was returning from his day's labor.</p>
               <p>One of these came near to where they were walking, to moor his boat; they asked if he was willing to take them a short distance to sail, for which they would reward him. As he consented, they were soon glancing over the moon-lit waves. The water in some places was so phosphorus, that as the oars caught it up, it appeared as though glistening with diamonds. As they sailed along they could hear the<pb n="140-141" xml:id="VAC6293-00000071"/> note of the shrill night-bird, upon the shore, and the low hum of voices.</p>
               <p>They passed one place that the boatman remarked was distinguished for a certain peculiarity, whenever a sound was made near the spot, an echo was produced, and let the sound be gay or mournful, it was taken up and repeated by the echo.</p>
               <p>This was a new amusement to the party, and they seemed delighted with it. Adelaide was perfectly carried away with the novel pleasure.</p>
               <p>As she bent forward in the moonlight to catch some faintly echoed sound, she presented a very pretty picture. Lizzie, her cousin appeared wholly unlike her. She made but little conversation, as she felt unacquainted with the company, but when addressed replied in her sweet quaker dialect. She was as much pleased with the sail as any of them, but she was less talkative than her handsome cousin; as they left the spot she whispered "good night echo," and "good night," was quickly returned o'er the water.</p>
               <p>They remained out till near ten o'clock, and then landed and pursued their way up the road to the house. Adelaide chatting all the way with Henry as though he were an old acquaintance—while Lizzie walked along enjoying herself in comparative silence, for her cousin had so much to say that there was no need of her conversing much.</p>
               <p>When Hermione and Dora retired to their room Hermione threw herself into a chair by the window, and resting her head on her hand, burst into tears.</p>
               <p>Dora had never seen her give way so to her feelings before, and looked upon her with surprise, not knowing whether it were best to ask the cause of her grief and try to console her, or to let her relieve herself undisturbed in tears. But finding that Hermione still retained her position when she should have been seeking rest she went to her, and ventured to say, as she threw her arms around her neck, "What is it Hermie that so troubles you, you have appeared happier than usual through the day I thought."</p>
               <p>"Yes, I may have done so, but I am heartily sick of acting a deceitful part. I have so long schooled myself to wear a smile and look of calmness, when all is turmoil within, that even you, my dear Dora, would not detect the deceit. But to-night I can disguise nothing, I am quite a child."</p>
               <p>"Do not give way to your grief, dear Hermie, said Dora. "It seems worse to see you weep than it<pb n="142-143" xml:id="VAC6293-00000072"/> would most people, it is so unusual for you to display any emotion."</p>
               <p>"How little we can judge of another by their outward appearance, few are affected more with deep emotion than I, yet the world would never dream it."</p>
               <p>She then confided to Dora who it was she had so unexpectedly met in the grove. "It has," said she, "opened afresh a wound, that time has seared, not healed. It has caused me too, to utter bitter words of scorn and hatred, for which my conscience upbraids me. He offered again his love; but do you suppose I could accept it. No! I should have felt as though I were again entrusting my heart in a serpent's coil. Oh, Dora, my life for the past few years has been so entirely wretched, that I would willingly give up this existence."</p>
               <p>"Do not murmur at your lot, Hermione. I cannot sympathize with you from experience, but still you have my pity. You have struggled nobly with affliction, do not let your courage fail you now."</p>
               <p>"Yes," said Hermione, as she leaned her head upon Dora's shoulder, "you can pity, and even that is sweet to me to-night. But you who have ever been more favored than most mortals, with kind parents and riches and so many blessings of life, know little of the trials of one like me, who is obliged to buffet the cold-hearted world. To such as me life loses its attraction. We act our part on the stage of life, and a sad part it is too, and when the curtain drops upon us, we are forgotten by the world."</p>
               <p>"You are indulging in too gloomy feelings," said Dora. I think you are disposed not to look on the bright side at all, and therefore I shall do so for you. Your life, up to your father's sickness and death was blessed with more attractions than fall to the lot of most of us. Since that time you have to be sure, had many trials to endure. But Hermione do not say you wish to die. Your sorrows have enabled you to be of more service to your family than you otherwise could have been. When you look back upon the few past years of your life, though it may be darkened by some sad memories, does not the satisfaction that you have been as a guiding star to your family, inspire you with fresh courage to go on and meet as fearlessly the storms of life that may be in store for you? But remember, my dear Hermie, the old adage, the 'darkest time is always just before day;' and the future for you may be full of gladness<pb n="144-145" xml:id="VAC6293-00000073"/> ness. I believe the cup of joy and sorrow is more equally blended than we are apt to acknowledge in our moments of sadness."</p>
               <p>"You are a sweet consoler, Dora, I see now my error. I will not give up entirely under the chastening rod, but believe that it is for some wise purpose; or I shall be little fitted to perform the duties of life, or to enjoy what blessings may be in store for me."</p>
               <p>"Come then, said Dora, and seek some rest."</p>

               <p>THE next morning, when they assembled at breakfast, Hermione had regained her usual calmness, and the party were merry as ever.</p>
               <p>Mr. Menton intended going back to the city that morning, so when the stage arrived, they all accompanied him to the piazza. After he entered the stage, Adelaide turned to Dora and inquired if the gentleman who had just left, was an acquaintance or relative of hers.</p>
               <p>"His wife was a particular friend of mine," replied Dora. "O, then he is a widower; I should suppose he was a queer sort of a body; I have not seen him smile once since I have been here. I did expect<pb n="146-147" xml:id="VAC6293-00000074"/> to see the muscles of his face relax a little when that clumsy negroservant carelessly stepped on his toes; and then the creature assumed such a terrible modest look, and with a bow so full of grace, begged his pardon. For my own part, I could scarcely refrain from laughing outright; and if Uncle Elliott had not been within hearing, should have inquired of him where he learned his grace of manners, as I would like to patronize his master."</p>
               <p>Dora glanced at the thoughtless girl, and replied: "probably Mr. Menton thought the circumstance not worthy a smile, and even had he been inclined to do so, would refrained from it, rather than to have injured the feelings of a kind, though awkward servant."</p>
               <p>"O dear me, you don't suppose, do you, that negroes have so tender feelings, they don't mind being laughed at, you know they do not expect to be treated as equals by us white people."</p>
               <p>"Do you believe, because their skins chance to be of a different hue, that their hearts are any the less sensitive?" asked Dora.</p>
               <p>"Certainly I do. They seem to me to belong as much to the monkey race as they do to man. A <emph>nigger will be a nigger,</emph> and you can't whip it out o him." </p>
               <p>Dora was shocked to hear a young girl speak in so inhuman a manner of her black brethren, and inquired what was the cause of her antipathy to the African race.</p>
               <p>"I did not say that I had any particular antipathy to them," she replied; "on the contrary, I rather like them in their place. In fact, I like them for what I think they were made for—that is, to be slaves and menials to the white population; but then you must look out for the rogues, or while your back is turned, they will pick your pocket for you. They are poor, degraded beings, and if the whites did not take care of them, they would suffer from want."</p>
               <p>"Perhaps they might in their present condition; but is it any credit to our land that so many of her sons, (it matters not whether they be black or white,) are such miserable beings, not even calculated to take care of themselves. It is nothing to our credit, and something that often causes me to blush for our country's sake. But tell me where <emph>you,</emph> an inhabitant of the <emph>Northern States,</emph> became so deeply dyed with slavery?"</p>
               <p>"My parents reside mostly in the Southern States, or rather my father's business is such as to call him<pb n="148-149" xml:id="VAC6293-00000075"/> mostly at the South. I have travelled considerably with them, and been much in slave States. I have been stopping with my uncle awhile to attend school here in the Northern States. I know that the slaves are better off than though they were free, for I have often heard of free negroes there who longed to get back into slavery. They did not know how to maintain themselves, and I do not believe God ever meant they should."</p>
               <p>"Do not attribute so great a sin to God; it is impious in man to endeavor to lay their faults to him. He created all men <emph>free and equal;</emph> and they who, to excuse their own actions, use God's name to sanction them, commit, in my opinion, as great a fraud as he who uses an earthly name to cover some base deception. You may think me rather warm on the subject; but, Miss Warren, when I see persons (not alluding to you merely) endeavor to prove that God (who is no respecter of persons) intended one man to be in bondage to another, both soul and body, my blood almost boils in my veins; and when <emph>ministers of the gospel</emph> countenance such outrage, they no longer deserve to profess themselves followers of Christ."</p>
               <p>"It is useless for <emph>us</emph> to argue the point, Miss Grafton ton. I have heard others talk before you, and what <emph>good</emph> do you accomplish? You only enrage the slaveholder by your words, and bind the chains of the slave the closer."</p>
               <p>"I confess that <emph>words</emph> are useless without <emph>action;</emph> the slaves, to be sure, have descended to them, and they are their rightful property; I, for one, would not approve the plan of wresting them from their masters, which in many cases would ruin their owners, as they are dependent upon their slaves for the carrying on of their plantations; and to take the slave in his present condition, and free him, might not be of any benefit to him. But, if by talk we could influence the whole of the Northern States to <emph>buy them,</emph> and send them to their native soil, we might do some good by agitating the question here."</p>
               <p>"This may be all very well, but, I say, let well enough alone; they are contented enough, most of them; they have plenty to eat and to drink, and when their clothing is worn out, they know more will be provided for them; and when their work is done, they lay down "the shovel and the hoe," and "take down the fiddle and the bow," and all sorrows are shaken<pb n="150-151" xml:id="VAC6293-00000076"/> off in the merry dance; as the old saying is, they lay no more at <emph>heart</emph> than they can shake off at <emph>heels.</emph>"</p>
               <p>"This may be a very easy and pleasant life for them on <emph>earth;</emph> but, did you ever think, Miss Warren how low a state they must occupy in <emph>another world.</emph> Here they are obliged to ask their masters if they can give their souls to Christ; but there they must be their own masters, and answer for the deeds done in the body," replied Dora.</p>
               <p>"You are getting very solemn in your manner, Miss Grafton; you really ought to become a public speaker. For my own part, I think the slaves are a favored part of the race. I do not believe in the cruelty that is often laid to their masters. And I have often heard that a <emph>black</emph> over-seen was much more cruel than a <emph>white.</emph> They are singular beings. I once heard a master say, who used the whip but very little himself, that he believed they were something like dogs, the more you whipped them the better they liked you."</p>
               <p>"Yes," replied Dora, "but perhaps that master did not think what a compliment he was paying to the <emph>white blood</emph> that flows in the slave's veins, as well as the <emph>black.</emph> Many a master condemns his <emph>own child</emph> to the smart of the lash."</p>
               <p>"Really, Miss Grafton, I should suppose you thought me accountable for the sins of others, but let us not continue the subject longer; we have departed sadly from Mr. Menton, the gentleman of whom we were conversing. You say he is a widower, I wish I had been aware of the fact; I supposed by his demure face that he was a married man, 'full of cares.'"</p>
               <p>"Mr. Menton," replied Dora, "has never recovered from the shock caused by his wife's death."</p>
               <p>"Oh dear! that is something entirely new and interesting, a distressed widower. Why, Miss Grafton, all the widowers that I have ever met with seemed the happiest of mortals; and the weed on their hats, a sign that they were again in the market. We schoolgirls have had some rare fun with these species of humanity. If we saw a gentleman with a weed on his hat, we knew that his lordship wished to be distinguished from the rest of his brothers, who were tied by hymens silken chains, and to let the fair sex into the secret that he was at liberty to choose again."</p>
               <p>Dora had never been accustomed to hearing the<pb n="152-153" xml:id="VAC6293-00000077"/> marriage relation spoken of in so light a manner, and she was at a loss how to answer the thoughtless girl.</p>
               <p>"Then you think, Miss Warren, that few wear their weeds out of respect to their wives. I should be very sorry myself to believe as you do."</p>
               <p>"We might as well <emph>think</emph> so, as long as we <emph>know</emph> that it is so. I believe <emph>half the men</emph> have their second wives chosen before the breath is out of the bodies of their first."</p>
               <p>"I do not agree with you exactly,;" said Dora, "for I think that Mr. Menton, at least, is a sincere mourner, and do not think anything would tempt him to marry at present."</p>
               <p>"I wish he had staid longer, and I would have convinced you of the truth of my statement. A few smiles and admiring glances, and I doubt not but what he would have been a devout adorer at my feet. I would not marry a widower for the world, but then it would have served for sport; a <emph>disappointed widower</emph> is worse than a disappointed <emph>bachelor.</emph>"</p>
               <p>Dora was too much displeased by the young girl's artful coquetry, to continue the conversation further, and was glad to hear Hermione calling for her within, as it made an excuse for her to leave the thoughtless girl. As she turned from her, she meditated, if all men were as Adelaide has pictured them, I would never care to be married, to be forgotton by them as soon as I were dead. But she judges the <emph>many</emph> by the <emph>few,</emph> I am inclined to believe.</p>

               <p>"Do you think my cousin Lizzie, pretty?" asked Adelaide of Hermione one afternoon, as they sat at the window which looked out upon a green lawn where Lizzie and Dora were gathering some wild flowers."</p>
               <p>"I suppose she would not be called handsome by many, some would say her countenance lacked animation, but it certainly does not expression; she has a beautiful mild eye, and her whole face bespeaks the index of her soul, pure and spotless," answered Hermione.</p>
               <p>"She is a kind-hearted girl, said Adelaide, "but I do not enjoy myself in her society; I wish uncle had not brought her with us, I can never act myself in her presence."</p>
               <p>"Then you do not both reside with your Uncle," said Hermione.</p>
               <p>"Lizzie has been with Uncle, now, since the death of her parents, some five or six years, I believe, but I am only stopping with him while I am finishing my education; this is the last term I shall attend school, I am now eighteen, and consider myself too old to be a school-girl. Papa wants me to go another year, but I am anxious to get rid of school restraints," replied she.</p>
               <p>"Do you both attend the same institute?" asked Hermione.</p>
               <p>"Oh no; Lizzie's parents left instructions for her to be educated among the quakers, as both of them belonged to the Society of Friends. They appointed Uncle her guardian, she has quite a fortune of her own, but you would never know it, she dresses so plain."</p>
               <p>"Her dress is simple to be sure, but she always looks neat, and her manner of dressing becomes her much."</p>
               <p>"How can you think so, nothing but everlasting <emph>drab, drab,</emph> year in and year out. If it were ever so pretty I should get tired of it."</p>
               <pb n="156-157" xml:id="VAC6293-00000079"/>
               <p>"I am sure she looked sweetly this morning in her simple white morning dress."</p>
               <p>"Yes she does become white very well. But it is fortunate it was <emph>her</emph> parents, instead of <emph>mine,</emph> who left behind such odd instructions, for I am quite sure I should not have followed them. I could never have been contented to have followed such customs."</p>
               <p>"Perhaps you would," said Hermione, if you had known it to have been their request on their death-bed."</p>
               <p>"O, do not talk about death, I cannot bear to think about it, much more talk of it."</p>
               <p>"Your Uncle seems very fond of her," said Hermione."</p>
               <p>"Yes indeed, Uncle Elliott thinks she is something more than mortal. They make a great baby of her at home. Aunt Elliott is continually setting her behavior up as an example for me; but her ways are too decidedly plain for me to admire. I am glad we fell in with your party, for if there had been only Uncle and cousin Lizzie here, I should have felt "like a toad under a harrow" as mamma says.</p>
               <p>"I wish you could see my mother Miss Phelps, she is a splendid looking woman <emph>now,</emph> and I have heard people say she was considered quite a <foreign xml:lang="FRA">belle</foreign> when she was a girl. She is so different from Aunt Elliott, <emph>she</emph> is so quiet, and never wants to go much into society, while <emph>mother</emph> is never happier than when in the midst of gayety.</p>
               <p>Hermione made no reply to this, but she thought it was very evident that Adelaide had never been taught to think of much else than fashion and folly; and though she could not but feel disgusted with the heartless tenor of her conversation, still, she felt that the mother was more to blame than the child; she it was, who moulded the young mind, and as we "bend the twig the tree's inclined."</p>
               <p>"There," said Adelaide, "Cousin Lizzie is coming across the lawn, with some sort of an animal in her arms. I never saw a person so taken up with every diminutive little creature, as she is, it matters not what it is, provided she can make a pet of it. I think such a mania decidedly vulgar," said Adelaide, with a curl of her pretty lip. She knew that Lizzie was a favorite with both Hermione and Dora, and she seemed determined to do all in her power to injure her in their estimation.</p>
               <p>"What sort of a curiosity have you?" said Adelaide to Lizzie, as she approached them.</p>
               <p>"It is a dear little white kitty, that the little boy<pb n="158-159" xml:id="VAC6293-00000080"/> who lives the other side of the lawn owns, I brought it to show thee, she is so pretty and playful."</p>
               <p>"I do not see anything very remarkable about the creature, for my part, I perfectly despise the grimalkin race."</p>
               <p>Lizzie seemed hurt at her cousin's speech, and replied, "I am very fond of pets, I have just been admiring the gambols of a lamb over the way. Thee knows, cousin Addie, that it is a treat to me to be in the country, and I hope, Hermione, thee will not think me childish."</p>
               <p>"Indeed I shall not," said Hermione, with warmth, (well knowing that Addie intended to hurt the feelings of her cousin,) "for I am extravagantly fond of pets myself; that is a dear little kitty you have there," said she, stooping to caress it.</p>
               <p>"I admired it for its pure white coat, and it looked so pretty at its play, that I begged permission of the little boy who owns it, to bring it over to show to thee."</p>
               <p>Lizzie turned to take the little pet away, because she saw Fred Grafton and Kate, and Henry Adams coming towards them, and she feared they would think her as childish as Adelaide appeared to.</p>
               <p>"Don't take it away," said Kate, and in a moment she had it in her arms, admiring its beauty.</p>
               <p>Adelaide found that she had not succeeded in her plan to mortify her cousin.</p>
               <p>"Let us go into the garden," said Fred, "and sit under the shade of the old tree. But where is Dora? I thought she was here."</p>
               <p>"There she comes," said Hermione, "she has been a short distance into the woods, gathering flowers."</p>
               <p>She came towards them, her hat crowned with a beautiful wreath, and in her hands were several others.</p>
               <p>"You look like a May-queen," said Kate.</p>
               <p>"Yes, and I mean to crown you all queens," said she smilingly, as she gracefully placed upon the heads of each, a wreath.</p>
               <p>"Now for the old elm tree," said Fred.</p>
               <p>"Where is Lizzie?" inquired old Mr. Elliott from the door, is she among you? I have looked the house over for her."</p>
               <p>"Here I am, uncle," said Lizzie, as she rose from the ground, where she had been kneeling to caress the kitten, "Do'st thou want me?"</p>
               <p>"No, darling, only I felt rather anxious about you, as you had been absent so long."</p>
               <pb n="160-161" xml:id="VAC6293-00000081"/>
               <p>"Come out here Uncle, and sit in the cool shade," said Lizzie. She made room for him near her, and with her gypsy hat kept the flies from troubling him.</p>
               <p>They formed a very pretty picture, as they sat there at the foot of the tree. The old gentleman with his head uncovered leaning against its trunk, with Lizzie sitting beside him, her head crowned with flowers, her kitty in her lap, while with one hand she swung her hat to and fro, to keep the flies from disturbing the old gentleman. The others were seated round in various attitudes.</p>
               <p>"Do you play the guitar?" asked Henry Adams of Adelaide.</p>
               <p>"No!" she replied, with a bewitching smile, "but my cousin Lizzie is quite an adept at it."</p>
               <p>"Thee knows better, Adelaide; thee knows I only play for my own and Uncle's amusement. I make no pretensions to playing."</p>
               <p>"Will you not play for us, if Fred will run and bring your guitar to you?" said Dora, "it would sound so sweetly out here under the old tree."</p>
               <p>"I would much prefer to be excused," she answered, "but if it will be any gratification to thee I will not refuse."</p>
               <p>When the instrument was handed to her, she received it with a sweet smile, and running her fingers lightly over its strings, commenced some simple melody. She sang with such perfect ease and so little affectation, that it was full as pleasing as though she had been an accomplished player. When she lay the guitar down beside her, they expressed their thanks for the favor.</p>
               <p>"Thou art welcome," she replied, "to my poor performance."</p>
               <p>The old gentleman looking down upon her, replied, "poor as it is, it has made many an hour joyous to her old Uncle in his home."</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XVII.</head>
               <p>ADELAIDE WARREN seemed determined to play the coquette if possible.</p>
               <p>She was much delighted because a few other boarders took accommodations opposite; it made it more lively, and as there were some young ladies and gentlemen among the number, it gave her a fine opportunity to excite admiration.</p>
               <p>She had engaged, considerably, the attention of Henry Adams, and seemed determined to engross his attention so that he should not become interested in her cousin Lizzie.</p>
               <p>Hermione had never fancied Adelaide from the first of their acquaintance; and this, Adelaide perceived, and disliked her as much in return.</p>
               <p>She said one day to Kate, "I cannot bear Miss Phelps, she is so cold and distant; and as proud as a peacock. I should not think she need to carry her head quite so high; I have understood that she was obliged to teach school for a livelihood. My Uncle was acquainted with her father, and he says he died a poor man."</p>
               <p>Dora happened to be within hearing, and replied, "I should not suppose that was any reason why she should not carry her head high. If your father should be suddenly taken from you, and leave his family poor, would it be any disgrace if you should take up some honorable employment to assist them?"</p>
               <p>"<emph>I</emph> do anything towards the support of a family;" she replied scornfully, "no not I."</p>
               <p>"Not if you knew it to be absolutely necessary."</p>
               <p>"I might, and I might not," she replied, "but if I did, I should not carry about me such an air of superiority. I should feel too much ashamed of my low condition for that."</p>
               <p>Dora had not an opportunity to reply to this, for they saw Hermione coming towards them.</p>
               <p>"Your father, Dora, commissioned me to come and bring you to the parlor, as he wishes to make preparations for a fishing excursion to-morrow."</p>
               <p>When they had all assembled, Mr. Grafton said, I wished to see you all together, to see if it would be<pb n="164-165" xml:id="VAC6293-00000083"/> agreeable to invite the company at the other house to accompany us. They all agreed to the proposition, and appointed Doctor Abbott, whom they expected that evening, to carry the invitation.</p>
               <p>When the stage arrived, it brought Doctor Abbott and a young man, to the house opposite, but as it was quite dark, they could not distinguish his features, and Doctor Abbott was ignorant who his fellow passenger was. In the course of the evening he carried the invitation, which was accepted.</p>
               <p>The next morning, all were up bright and early.</p>
               <p>The Grafton party arrived at the wharf before the invited persons, and were about seating themselves in the boat when they arrived. What was the surprise of Hermione, to see among them Frank Landon. He had told her that he would continually cross her path, and he intended to fulfil his threat.</p>
               <p>He was distantly connected with some of the party who had taken board at the house, and determined to make this an excuse for his coming to spend a week; but in reality it was so that he might if possible annoy Hermione.</p>
               <p>Dora merely bowed coldly to him, and then glanced at Hermione; her face was averted from her, but she well knew what must be her feelings.</p>
               <p>But Adelaide delighted in this addition to their party. She soon became introduced to him, and entered into lively conversation with him.</p>
               <p>Frank Landon was very handsome, and he well knew how to make himself agreeable; he cared not a fig for the admiration of Adelaide, only to annoy Hermione.</p>
               <p>Henry Adams had been rather dazzled by her beauty, and did not realize till now, that Adelaide was playing the coquette with him; this led him to confine his attention less to her, through the day, and threw him more into the society of Lizzie, in whom he found much to admire; though before, he had regarded her merely as a pretty quakeress.</p>
               <p>The afternoon was fine, and they met with success in their fishing. Hermione exerted herself to be gay, so that he should not have the satisfaction of thinking that he took from her enjoyment; and she carried it out well, but she was only acting the part, that she had complained of to Dora as being her portion, that of wearing a smile when her heart was sad.</p>
               <p>Frank Landon bestowed every attention upon the fair Adelaide, which she received with pleasure.</p>
               <p>"Who is that young man with my cousin?" asked Lizzie, of Henry Adams."</p>
               <pb n="166-167" xml:id="VAC6293-00000084"/>
               <p>"His name is Landon," he replied. I have not seen him for some time; he has been absent in Europe. I did not know until to-day that he had returned; it was he, it seems, who came to the house opposite last night; he is a relative of the family boarding there, he says. He used to be a beau of Miss Phelps, some time ago, I believe."</p>
               <p>"I do not think it right to form hasty opinions of persons, at first sight," said Lizzie, "but thee knows that there are some that strike thee unpleasantly at first sight. He is very handsome, but I do not like to see my cousin so intimate with a stranger."</p>
               <p>The day wore away pleasantly with some of them, and with others it was mere pretension. Dora really enjoyed the time, because Doctor Abbott was with her, and so many of those who were near and dear to her.</p>
               <p>But to Hermione it was tedious enough. To be compelled to be in the society of one who made her feel so uncomfortable, was almost misery to her.</p>
               <p>Thus the time wore on with the party at the seashore. They were always enjoying some excursion or other, till the six weeks that they intended to spend in the country had nearly expired, and they were about preparing to leave with regret, the time had passed to most of them so pleasantly.</p>
               <p>Dora had become much attached to Lizzie during their short acquaintance; and she hoped to continue the intimacy after they returned.</p>
               <p>It would have been difficult to have decided which, if either of the Misses Warren, Henry Adams had a preference, certain it was that he was very attentive to old Mr. Elliott and his two nieces.</p>
               <p>But Frank Landon during his stay, was constantly in the society of Adelaide.</p>

               <p>AFTER their return from the country, Fred commenced his career as an artist in his native land. He executed his paintings with so much punctuality, and was so correct in his portraits, that he soon won the praise he merited.</p>
               <p>Kate endeared herself more and more to the Grafton's. She was so affectionate, and yet so artless. It was a source of comfort to Mrs. Grafton to have her with her, for she felt almost the same love for her that she did for her own children; and now that she knew it would not be a great while before she would probably lose Dora, it seemed to attach her more to Kate.</p>
               <p>Doctor Abbott had for some time been anxious to take Dora to a home of his own, but she had been so loath to leave her parents, that their marriage had been deferred from time to time. But now Kate had so won the love of her parents' hearts, she felt that she would supply her loss, and they would not be so lonely; therefore she had consented to become his bride the ensuing spring.</p>
               <p>Adelaide Warren left school as she had said that she should, the term after she went from the country; and as her parents had now settled at the north, she was at home a petted and spoiled child.</p>
               <p>It was very evident, now that the two cousins were separated, which of the two presented the most attractions to Henry Adams, for the calls that he made upon Adelaide after she left her uncle's, were very few, while, if rumor spoke truly, he corresponded with Lizzie, who still attended school in another city.</p>
               <p>It roused the anger and pride of Adelaide, not that she cared really for Henry's love, for he was not gay enough for her, but she thought him much in love with herself, and expected to excite him to jealousy, by her flirtation with Frank Landon; but when Henry gradually withdrew his attentions from herself, and bestowed them upon her cousin, whom she considered<pb n="170-171" xml:id="VAC6293-00000086"/> so inferior in personal attractions, it annoyed her vanity exceedingly. To think that Lizzie had become her rival, and that it seemed to cause Henry so few unpleasant feelings to see her admired by another, made her very uneasy.</p>
               <p>She determined, in her selfish heart, to form a plan to destroy the confidence of Henry in Lizzie, and she laid her schemes so deep that none would have detected her in its performance.</p>
               <p>Lizzie came home to spend her vacation, and Adelaide received her with a honeyed tongue; for she did not want the unsuspecting girl to think for a moment, that she entertained any jealous feelings towards her, or that she was forming any plan to ruin her happiness.</p>
               <p>Adelaide gave a large party, during the vacation, which she pretended to do entirely on Lizzie's account. But in reality to see how Henry would appear towards her cousin in company, so that she could aim her shafts with more safety.</p>
               <p>Quite a party were gathered in the beautifully furnished apartments of the Warrens. Among them, might be numbered all those who had met the last season at the sea-shore.</p>
               <p>It would have been difficult to decide which of the cousins was the most beautiful to look upon. Their style of beauty was entirely different, but none could deny, but each possessed much.</p>
               <p>Addie was clothed in a rich and costly manner, yet every thing was in good taste. While Lizzie, as usual, wore a simple white muslin,—yet what would have been more becoming to her angelic countenance.</p>
               <p>"Cousin Addie, thee seems unusually happy to-night," said Lizzie, in her innocent way.</p>
               <p>"It must be only the reflection of your own sweet face, cousin mine, you look so charming to night; but I am so happy to have you again with us, that it would not be strange if I did look happy. Have you noticed whether Henry Adams has arrived yet?" asked Adelaide, so as to see what effect it would have upon her cousin.</p>
               <p>But no tell-tale blush rose to the cheek of Lizzie as she answered quietly, "no I have not; thee expects him then?"</p>
               <p>"I sent him an invitation, and I supposed you of course would know whether he intended to be present," said Adelaide.</p>
               <p>"I know not why thou should'st," said Lizzie, "for I have not seen him since I went back to school."</p>
               <pb n="172-173" xml:id="VAC6293-00000087"/>
               <p>"Can it be possible, that so devoted a lover as rumor makes him to be, should be guilty of allowing his lady love to be in town two days, and not call upon her."</p>
               <p>"Rumor often lies," replied Lizzie, smilingly.</p>
               <p>"Yes, but there comes the gentleman in question," said Addie, "I did not see him enter."</p>
               <p>"Good evening," said he to Addie, according to etiquette, addressing her first, though his gaze was bent upon Lizzie;—then turning to Lizzie he cordially greeted her, for he had not spoken with her for three months.</p>
               <p>"It seems really pleasant to have Lizzie again with us, does it not Mr. Adams?" said Addie, with a searching gaze.</p>
               <p>"It does indeed," was his candid reply.</p>
               <p>"I am most happy to be again among my friends," said Lizzie; "but is Dora Grafton here? I have not spoken with her yet."</p>
               <p>"Yes; there she is," said Henry, "by the window, shall we go to her? she is with her brother and his wife."</p>
               <p>"I should like to," answered Lizzie.</p>
               <p>"Will you go too," said he, addressing Adelaide.</p>
               <p>"No, I thank you," she replied, and turned to converse verse with another of her guests. She preferred now to watch them from a distance, where they would not suspect her eye was on them.</p>
               <p>Lizzie and Dora were delighted to meet again, and continued together much of the evening. Dora was pleased to notice the apparent attachment between Henry and Lizzie, for she felt they were well suited for each other.</p>
               <p>Adelaide saw enough during that evening, and through the vacation, to convince her that the report of their correspondence was correct; and she determined that if she did not win the heart of Henry Adam's, Lizzie never should, if she could prevent it. She intended to put her plans into execution as soon as Lizzie should return to school.</p>
               <p>Thus, after Lizzie had been a short time in school, she wrote to her that she intended to come out and spend a day or two with her; she missed her so much that she felt as though she could not live longer without seeing her.</p>
               <p>Lizzie who really loved her cousin in spite of her faults, sent to her that it would give her much pleasure to have her do so. When Adelaide arrived and met her cousin, she ran to her and embraced her, saying<pb n="174-175" xml:id="VAC6293-00000088"/> my dear Lizzie, you cannot imagine how I have longed to see you; and I have teased papa until he consented to my coming and spending a day or two with you, though he was very anxious for me to be at home to attend to my Italian lessons, as he has procured for me an excellent teacher. But I coaxed and coaxed, and when I found that did not accomplish my purpose, took to weeping violently and I knew that would avail, for papa nor mamma either cannot bear to see me cry, they are afraid I shall spoil my eyes I suppose.</p>
               <p>While Adelaide was on her visit, she wrote a letter to Henry Adams, mailed from there, and signed the name of the principal of the school. This was her object in making her pretended visit of friendship to Lizzie, so as to be able to carry out her wicked plans the more effectually.</p>
               <p>She wrote that it was against the rules of the school for any of the young ladies to carry on a correspondence with their gentlemen acquaintances; and that it had been discovered that Miss Warren (whom they esteemed much as a pupil,) had been guilty of violating this rule, by carrying on a regular correspondence with himself. If the practice is continued, it must result in the expulsion of the young lady from the school, as this is the law of the institute, to those who disobey its so-written rules. But, she continued, we have no doubt you will comply with our request and cease writing or receiving letters, rather than to subject the young lady to the disgrace of being expelled from school.</p>
               <p>She wrote that there would be no need of his seeking an explanation with Miss Warren, as she would be informed of the steps that had been taken to prevent a future correspondence between them. To this epistle she had the presumption to sign in full the name of the principal. She had now accomplished a part of her plot, that was, to prevent Henry from writing to Lizzie, and thus cause her to think he had forgotten her. And now she determined to bribe one of the servants, so as to prevent any of Lizzie's letters reaching him, to destroy all that he should be commissioned to take to the office for Lizzie, directed to Henry Adams.</p>
               <p>These plans she was carrying into execution, when she was, to all appearance as friendly towards Lizzie as ever. And while Adelaide was doing all in her power, in secret, to ruin the happiness of her cousin, Lizzie was exerting herself to make her visit pleasant.</p>
               <pb n="176-177" xml:id="VAC6293-00000089"/>
               <p>When the time for her to return had arrived, Adelaide left, with great pretensions of regret at parting with Lizzie. After this Lizzie looked anxiously for a letter from Henry, night after night, but none came. The servant would hand to her, her parcel of letters, but when she glanced over the direction, and found none in the familiar hand of Henry, her heart seemed to fail her. She wrote several times to him in hopes to gain an explanation, but as she received no answer to these, she of course was led to think that he wished to discontinue the correspondence.</p>
               <p>This was a great blow to Lizzie, for she truly loved Henry, and she never suspected her cousin as having any part in the matter. Lizzie made no mention of her disappointment to either her Uncle or Dora, (these were her most beloved correspondents) but suffered in silence and alone. Her school-mates thought her unusually sad, but it was so natural to her to be quiet and rather reserved that none guessed its cause.</p>
               <p>But Henry, who was naturally rather impulsive, determined to invent some way so that he might be permitted to write to Lizzie. He thought at first of writing to the principal, informing him that an actual engagement subsisted between himself and Lizzie, and that it was with the consent of her guardian. But then, when he glanced at the letter, he found that the rules of the school actually prohibited any correspondence, under any pretex whatever, between young ladies and their gentlemen acquaintances.</p>
               <p>Then he determined to visit Lizzie in person and acquaint her with the reasons of his silence; but as the principal stated that Lizzie would be informed of the measures taken to prevent their correspondence, he felt that this would be useless; and that at the close of the term she would probably graduate, and then all would be explained; and till then, all they could do was to be patient.</p>
               <p>The most that puzzled him, was the fact that Lizzie had previously exchanged letters with him; he knew her to be too conscientious to carry on a correspondence in secret. All the reason he could divine for this was that she had done it so innocently, not knowing that she was violating the rules. The term passed slowly enough with him, and seemed as though it would never come to a close.</p>

               <p>HENRY ADAMS was walking home from his counting room one afternoon. He had felt unusually gloomy through the day, and walked along absorbed in thought, when a merry voice at his elbow bade him good afternoon. He turned, and saw beside him the handsome face of Adelaide.</p>
               <p>She had directed her course on purpose to meet him, at the usual hour that he went to tea; but the artful girl affected great surprise at meeting him at so early an hour. "I did not dream of the thing," said she, "when I came this way."</p>
               <p>"Which way are you walking?" said he, "if agreeable I will accompany you." He was in hopes by so doing, to hear something direct from Lizzie, as he had not called upon her Uncle for a week or more.</p>
               <p>"The afternoon was so fine," replied Adelaide, "that I contemplated a stroll on the mall."</p>
               <p>On their way, she said, "how long since you received a letter from cousin Lizzie, Mr. Adams."</p>
               <p>"I should suppose you considered me one of her regular correspondents, Miss Warren," he replied, "which privilege would be denied me, even were I disposed to improve it."</p>
               <p>"Why so," she replied, with affected surprise</p>
               <p>"I have been informed," said he, "that the rules of the school prohibited young ladies from exchanging letters with their gentlemen acquaintances.</p>
               <p>"O wretched," she exclaimed, "I would as soon be locked up in a convent, as denied the free use of my pen. For my part, I would almost as soon consent to having my tongue, (which you know is rather an unruly member,) bridled, as to be told to whom, or when I should write."</p>
               <p>"Have you heard from Lizzie of late," said he.</p>
               <p>"O yes," she replied, "only last eve, she is well<pb n="180-181" xml:id="VAC6293-00000091"/> and in excellent spirits. If I were her lover, I should have been somewhat jealous of the manner that she speaks of the gentleman who has charge of the school. She describes him as a man of fine talents, and admirably fitted, (considering his age, which is about thirty," said Addie, with a provoking smile, "just an interesting age for a gentleman,) to fill the station of principal.</p>
               <p>Henry Adams bit his lip. The thought that Lizzie was every day in the presence of one, who possessed so much influence over her, when he was denied the privilege of seeing or even writing to her, made him uncomfortable enough.</p>
               <p>Addie took advantage of his silence, and added, "Lizzie was always so quakerish in her ideas, that I do not think it at all strange, that she should become interested in one of that persuasion. But I did not imagine Lizzie would be guilty of coquetry, she has always preached so much about it to others."</p>
               <p>This she said with perfect coolness, and looking up into his face to see if her poisoned arrows had taken effect, was delighted to find that they had hit the mark and that she had succeeded in rousing him to jealousy.</p>
               <p>The face she looked upon was pale, and evidently struggling with emotions it could not conceal. She felt that she had ventured far enough; she sent the dart and it reached its mark; she knew that it would rankle and corrode within his breast, and change his feelings of love into jealousy.</p>
               <p>So she carelessly turned the conversation by asking Henry if he had heard of the intended marriage of Dora Grafton, which was to take place in a few weeks.</p>
               <p>"No, I have not," said Henry, scarcely heeding what she said, his feelings were so much agitated.</p>
               <p>"Yes, and I suppose she will have a splendid wedding," continued Adelaide. "I understand Hermione Phelps is to be one of her bridesmaids, I wonder how Hermione would like Frank Landon as groomsman. I fancy it would be very pleasing to her majesty, but I rather think she will not have that privilege," said she, with a triumphant expression.</p>
               <p>Henry knew that Landon had been quite attentive to Adelaide at the sea-shore, but he supposed it nothing but a flirtation; he did not know, that though the parents of Adelaide, were much opposed to her keeping company with him, that she kept up clandes tine meetings with him, and, therefore, spoke of him in rather different terms than he would have done, had he been aware of the fact.</p>
               <pb n="182-183" xml:id="VAC6293-00000092"/>
               <p>"I do not think Hermione would deem it any credit to herself to have her name associated with one like him."</p>
               <p>"Why so?" said Adelaide.</p>
               <p>"In the first place, for his past conduct to herself; and then I should not suppose his reported character was such as to suit Hermione. He is too gay and reckless."</p>
               <p>"O, I think such sort of young men charming."</p>
               <p>"They might make <emph>charming</emph> admirers," said Henry, "but pretty miserable husbands, I should judge."</p>
               <p>"O, that is an after-consideration," said she, gaily. "Some of these wild young men make model husbands, you know."</p>
               <p>"Perhaps so," said Henry, dryly. "But I think from what I have seen of Doctor Abbott, that Dora Grafton, if she marries him, will have an excellent husband."</p>
               <p>"Yes, I believe people think that she will. I think she will make a model wife, at any rate; for though Dora and I could never agree in conversation, still she is a person you cannot help admiring. She is always agreeable and social in her manners to all."</p>
               <p>They walked a while longer. Adelaide exerting herself to appear as agreeable as possible. "I shall be obliged to bid you good afternoon soon," said she, "as I have a friend that I wish much to call upon near here."</p>
               <p>She made this for an excuse, but in reality, she knew that the hour that had been appointed for her to meet Frank Landon had nearly arrived, and she preferred to meet him alone.</p>
               <p>"When you next write to Lizzie," said Henry, (showing that his thoughts were upon her,) "please tell her that I am glad she is so well pleased with her instructor."</p>
               <p>"I shall not probably write to her before she will be home to see Dora married. Good night," said she, and with a fascinating smile turned from him.</p>
               <p>"I have worked my cards pretty well," thought Adelaide. "I have got both Lizzie and Henry jealous, or rather have made them think they have cause to be so; now I wonder what the result will be. If Henry should seek an explanation, they would suspect some foul play somewhere, but I do not believe they would, either of them, suspect me. If they do not, I shall have the satisfaction of knowing that I have carried<pb n="184-185" xml:id="VAC6293-00000093"/> my points, and perhaps destroyed all confidence between them. But if they should discover me to be the traitor, I would laughingly acknowledge the whole as being a capital joke. That the affair had been carried out for pure mischief, to see how well they loved each other, and though they may think it rather an expensive one for them, still they will be obliged to make the best of it. At any rate, I care not for the after-consequences, as I have succeeded so as to make both of them unhappy enough for the present, at least; and perhaps broken up the engagement."</p>

               <p>SPRING had now arrived with its many flowers; and Doctor Abbott persuaded Dora before their marriage, to make a visit of a few days at his mother's, in the country.</p>
               <p>They were strolling one day along the banks of the river that wended its way near the house, talking over bright anticipations of future happiness. "It is now about three years," said Doctor Abbott, "since I met you in little Willie's sick chamber. Time will never obliterate, Dora, the picture that you presented<pb n="186-187" xml:id="VAC6293-00000094"/> sented at that time to my eye. Motves of charity prompted me to seek that humble dwelling; I hoped to be the instrument in God's hands, in relieving the little sufferer. I expected not to find one there, who was fit to shine and grace the halls of splendor, bending in all her youthful loveliness over a couch of poverty and pain, striving by her gentle tones and tender care to soothe the pangs of sickness. I knew that no wish for notoriety, kept you there, but a wish to follow in the footsteps of your Savior"</p>
               <p>"Some say that love at first sight is impossible. I know not but this may be true with some. But in my own case, I have proved it not only possible, but deep and lasting. Yes, dear Dora, I can truly say I loved you at first sight, and that love but increased with acquaintance. Something whispered to my heart that you were the one destined to become my bosom companion. The more I was thrown in your society, the more beautiful traits of character I beheld in you. I sought your hand and heart in marriage, and was not repulsed, this to me was the happiest moment of my life. You have entrusted to my keeping your future happiness, and God grant that I may prove faithful to the trust imposed in me. Dearer to me than life will be your happiness."</p>
               <p>"Our love is mutual, and ere long, we shall pledge at the altar our vows. Our destinies will then be united, and we shall become sharers of the same joys and sorrows. We cannot expect that our path through life will be free from thorns, and strewn entirely with flowers. No, my dear Dora, the cup of life is a mingled one, its contents are made up of joy and sorrow; but in union may we find strength to assist each other to drink cheerfully from it."</p>
               <p>Dora listened with pleasure to the words of her lover; his sentiments were dear to her heart. Their attachment had been founded on no mere fancy, their love from the first had been strong and deep.</p>
               <p>"You are willing to take upon yourself the whole responsibility of making our married life happy," said Dora. "I have been too well instructed by my mother, of the duties of a wife, to imagine for a moment, but that I have also a part to perform. There is no sphere in life that woman can adorn as well as <emph>home.</emph> To a certain extent, I consider her responsible for her husband's character. Most young men marry in hopes to find in their wives a congenial companion, who will make their home the most attractive place on earth to them. If they become disappointed in the<pb n="188-189" xml:id="VAC6293-00000095"/> one they have chosen—if she is disposed to make her home cheerless and unhappy—oftentimes he is driven to other places to find society. If his principles are not uncommonly strong, he may drown his sorrows in the poisonous cup, at the gaming table. By the world, perhaps, he may be blamed for this neglect of his home, and for indulging in vice; while the wife will receive pity for the misfortune of marrying so dissipated a young man.</p>
               <p>But if the wife makes her home the centre of attraction to her husband, how gladly will he bend his steps homeward; there he is sure to meet a smiling welcome, no inducement would lure him to vice, and if the tempter should seek to entangle him by his wiles he will think of the loved one at home, who has perfect confidence in his integrity, and whose heart would be broken should he fall into the snare, and he is enabled to say "get thee behind me satan." "Is not my picture a faithful one?" said Dora.</p>
               <p>"You have looked much into human nature Dora, and understand it well. Your picture is too true."</p>
               <p>"I fear," said Dora, "that if Adelaide Warren persists in marrying Frank Landon, that they will prove a most unhappy couple."</p>
               <p>"I understood the other day," said Dora, "that her parents having ascertained his dissipated character, have forbid his visiting the house, but that Adelaide has been seen several times in his company abroad."</p>
               <p>"She, of course, has been informed of his character," said Doctor Abbott.</p>
               <p>"Yes, but she will not believe any of the reports."</p>
               <p>"I should suppose his whole appearance bespoke his character."</p>
               <p>"I do not think Frank Landon has the least particle of love for Adelaide, said Dora."</p>
               <p>"What do you attribute his motives to?"</p>
               <p>"You knew that he was once attached to Hermione, I suppose."</p>
               <p>"Yes."</p>
               <p>"It was on account of Hermione suddenly becoming reduced in circumstances that he left her; but he repented his rash act, and would willingly have acknowledged his error, but Hermione had found out his true character, and would not receive him again. It is also said that love is blind and cannot see any faults; true it was with Hermione after Frank Landon left her, that she became known to many and glaring<pb n="190-191" xml:id="VAC6293-00000096"/> faults in him that she had never before perceived. But it enraged him greatly to be refused by her; he swore revenge. He threatened to continually cross her path, and obtain a bride, and lavish comforts upon her, in hopes to annoy Hermione."</p>
               <p>"Then you think he loves Hermione, but merely seeks the society of Adelaide, from revenge."</p>
               <p>"I do."</p>
               <p>"Do you imagine," asked Doctor Abbott, "that Hermione can have any regard for one who has treated her so meanly."</p>
               <p>"Hermione's attachments are very strong," said Dora. "I cannot believe, and indeed I know, that she does not love him, as he is, but she cannot banish him from her memory, as she once believed him to be sincere."</p>
               <p>"Do you think it had any effect upon her disposition."</p>
               <p>"Oh yes," said Dora, she would never have been so cold and distant if it had not been for this. It has destroyed her confidence in her fellow-beings."</p>
               <p>"His conduct towards her was shameful," said Doctor Abbott."</p>
               <p>"It was indeed."</p>
               <p>"Hermione appears to be a noble character, and I think it very fortunate that her fate is not united with one so worthless as he," said Doctor Abbott."</p>
               <p>Here their minds were called from the subject on which they were conversing, to admire two beautiful rivulets at their feet. They pursued the same direction for some time with a gentle current; but at last they mingled into one, and became quite a stream, able to bear upon its surface a small boat. "Such may our love prove," said Doctor Abbott; "we have so far through our acquaintance glided smoothly along, soon may we become united, and may our love be so blended, that we may indeed become one, and our lives flow on towards the ocean of eternity, undisturbed by the storms of fate."</p>
               <p>"I trust that it may," said Dora.</p>
               <p>"Do you suppose Lizzie Warren's vacation will come in season for her to be present at our wedding," asked Doctor Abbott.</p>
               <p>"Yes I think it will, for in her last letter, she wrote to me, that school would close in a week or two, and that she hoped to be home in season to see me married."</p>
               <p>"She is a lovely girl," said Doctor Abbott. "I think Henry Adams will obtain a prize in her."</p>
               <pb n="192-193" xml:id="VAC6293-00000097"/>
               <p>"Yes, but I have feared of late that there is some misunderstanding between them," said Dora.</p>
               <p>"Why so?" inquired Doctor Abbott.</p>
               <p>"Because, in the first place, Lizzie has scarcely mentioned his name in any of her last letters, and then she does not write in so good spirits as formerly."</p>
               <p>"That accounts perhaps," said Doctor Abbott, "for Henry's being so blue; the last time I saw him, I told him I should imagine from the length of his face that he had got the mitten."</p>
               <p>"I cannot believe that Lizzie would be guilty of coquetry; and I know that Henry truly loves her; so I cannot divine the meaning of their coldness," said Dora.</p>
               <p>They now turned their steps homeward. As they stepped upon the piazza, the Doctor remarked, "It was from this spot Dora, three years ago, I gazed after your lovely form so earnestly, as you rode down the avenue. I thought, as I watched you till you were lost in the dim distance, if thus I should lose trace of you forever, my future life would be a mere blank without your sweet face to enliven my existence; life would have appeared a wilderness, without a single green oasis to cheer me on my journey."</p>
               <p>The supper bell now warned them that they had prolonged their walk longer than they had thought for. As they came in, old Mrs. Abbott smiled, and said, "time is short to lovers, but it seemed to me you would never return from your walk. I know it is all your fault, George," said she, addressing her son; "for Dora said you would only be gone a few moments."</p>
               <p>"I am sorry if we have delayed your tea-hour," said Dora, "we did not intend to have been out so long."</p>
               <p>"O, that is of no consequence," said the old lady, "but as you return so soon to the city, I want to enjoy your society as much as possible."</p>

               <p>MRS. GRAFTON was a tender and loving mother. But she never believed true parental love to consist in granting every indulgence to her children, because they might wish for it, regardless whether it was for their best interest. She was devoted to her family, and they appreciated her worth to them.</p>
               <p>It was a great trial to Dora to leave her home and parents, even though she would probably reside near to them, and though she had given her whole heart to him who was to be her future companion.</p>
               <p>She was in the family sitting-room the evening before her marriage was to be celebrated, seated by a window that had always been a favorite one to her, and which she usually occupied; it looked out upon her garden in which she had spent so many pleasant hours. Those flowers which she had watched with so much care must soon be left behind, and her attachment to the spot had become so strong that the tears would come in spite of herself. She averted her face from the window, but then her eye fell upon the piano, whose soft notes had so often sounded in her ear, and now she must soon bid it adieu. She knew that in the home awaiting her, one more splendid had been carried, a bridal gift from Kate, but then it seemed to her its rich tones could never be half so dear as the <emph>old home piano.</emph>
               </p>
               <p>She felt that her tears were childish, yet she could not keep them back. She had perfect confidence in him who was to be her husband, but her parental home, had ever been a sacred place to her; her mother was her only confiding friend. However much she would become attached to her new home, it was hard for her to leave these old familiar scenes of her childhood; she felt too, the responsibility resting upon her in assuming the duty of a wife.</p>
               <p>She did not notice the approach of soft footsteps behind<pb n="196-197" xml:id="VAC6293-00000099"/> hind, till the arm of Kate was thrown around her, and in her rich cadence she commenced a sweet song, the words intended for a bride's farewell:— <q>
                     <lg type="quotation">
                        <l>"Why do I weep to leave the vine</l>
                        <l rend="ti-1">Whose clusters o'er me bend,—</l>
                        <l>The myrtle,—yet, O, call it mine!—</l>
                        <l rend="ti-1">The flowers I love to tend.</l>
                        <l>A thousand thoughts of all things dear,</l>
                        <l rend="ti-1">Like shadows o'er me sweep;</l>
                        <l>I leave my sunny childhood here,—</l>
                        <l rend="ti-1">O, therefore, let me weep."</l>
                     </lg>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>"My own sweet sister," exclaimed Dora, "you too have known what it is to leave the '<emph>myrtle</emph>' and the '<emph>vine,</emph>' and do not wonder at my tears. Your parting from your native land must indeed have been trying."</p>
               <p>"Yes Dora it was painful; right happy should I have been to have enjoyed the society of your brother in my native land; but if we unite our destinies with another, we must follow them, and make their pursuits ours."</p>
               <p>"Yes," replied Dora, "and the future presents so many attractions to our view, that we become in part reconciled to the separation from our friends."</p>
               <p>The memory of home caused the tears to flow from the eyes of Kate, so that Dora's attention was diverted from herself, to become a comfort to Kate.</p>
               <p>"You must consider yourself a very valuable person Kate," said Dora, "for I am sure we could not part from you here. You will become more dear to mamma than ever, after I am gone."</p>
               <p>Here they were interrupted by the entrance of Fred, who, on finding the traces of recent tears upon the cheek of both Kate and Dora, exclaimed merrily, "I should really suppose some shocking accident had, or was about, to take place in the house. I just passed through the garden and saw old Samuel bending over a beautiful rose tree; 'well Samuel,' said I, you have made a very pretty bush of that."</p>
               <p>He looked up into my face, while a tear rolled down his sun-burnt cheek, and replied,—</p>
               <p>"Yes, and I am watching these buds to see if they will be half opened by to-morrow night, for Miss Dora."</p>
               <p>"What do you intend for her to do with them?" said I.</p>
               <p>"I want to make a wreath for her, said he; they are beautiful moss-rose buds, and I know she would prefer them to any artificial ones."</p>
               <pb n="198-199" xml:id="VAC6293-00000100"/>
               <p>The old man wiped his eyes and continued,—</p>
               <p>"O, Mr. Frederick, you don't know how I shall miss her sweet face out here in the garden. It didn't make any difference whether the sun shone or not, her face was always so sunny. Poor old Samuel will be very lonely now."</p>
               <p>"Perhaps Kate will take pity on you, and give you some of her society," said I.</p>
               <p>"Well," he answered, "Samuel loves Miss Kate, but she won't be Miss Dora."</p>
               <p>Kate and Dora could not refrain from smiling at the simple, heartedness of the old gardener.</p>
               <p>"When I left him and came through the kitchen there was Biddy and Eliza weeping and wailing over some little parting tokens you had given them. I did not attempt to comfort them for I thought it would be useless, and so passed on to mother's room, but found the key turned, and presumed she was enjoying her tears in solitude; and now here I find both of you in the same affliction. I am going to run immediately for the '<emph>Doctor</emph>' to see if he can relieve this distressed house."</p>
               <p>"I believe papa and I are the only sensible ones in the house; he is reading the paper, (upside down, though, I fancied, as I peeped over his shoulder,) and I have come to comfort the afflicted," said Fred.</p>
               <p>"You are as saucy as ever, Fred Grafton," said Dora. "Pray can't you raise one tear for the occasion?"</p>
               <p>"I might possibly, if you were to provide me with an <emph>onion,</emph>" said he provokingly. "But really my dear sister, I think if Doctor Abbott was aware of the commotion he had made in our household, he would be much surprised. Come, cheer up, and let us enjoy the afternoon."</p>
               <p>Fred Grafton loved his sister sincerely, and it was hard for him to feel that she was going from him, but his bump of hope and mirthfulness were very full and he could not bear to see any one sad.</p>
               <p>Fred ordered the carriage, and they went out for a short ride, which they enjoyed much, the weather being very pleasant.</p>

               <p>DORA rose early from her couch on her bridal morn. She knelt by her bedside and prayed for strength from on high; thus far her path in life had led in pleasant places; sickness nor sorrow had never lain their withering hands upon her, and she was now about to enter upon new scenes and duties. Dora was still in a kneeling attitude, when her mother softly entered the chamber, and laying her hand upon her daughter's head, bestowed upon her a mother's blessing.</p>
               <p>"You go my daughter this day to the altar, to take upon yourself a solemn vow; in the sight of heaven that vow is sacred. You have been instructed to look upon marriage as no trifling thing, but as a high and holy ordinance. You take upon yourself duties and responsibilities so arduous, that you will often feel need of seeking aid from on high. So far through life you have been exempt from its trials; and it may be that your destiny will never change. But my dear Dora, if the storms of adversity overtake you, be not cast down; though the time should come when you saw nothing to enliven your dark prospects, still indulge bright hope for the morrow; and remember what I have often endeavored to impress upon your mind, that 'every cloud has a silver lining."</p>
               <p>Dora pressed a kiss upon her mother's forehead and replied, "I know dear mother that I am but a novice in the life before me, but you have been so faithful to your child, that I do not assume responsibilities without some knowledge how to perform them."</p>
               <p>"I shall preach to you no marriage sermon; I would merely say, remember that your husband's happiness is in your hands; guard it well," said Mrs. Grafton, as she left her daughter's room.</p>
               <p>The hour appointed for the wedding arrived, and Dora, attired in her bridal robes, with Hermione as her bridesmaid, entered the church, to acknowledge before God and the witnesses assembled there, her promise to become the loving and faithful wife of George Abbott.</p>
               <pb n="202-203" xml:id="VAC6293-00000102"/>
               <p>It was as old Samuel Had said, Dora much preferred a natural to an artificial wreath, for her hair; and the pretty moss-rose buds were fitting ornaments for one so pure and beautiful as she.</p>
               <p>Her whole dress was very simple, but as "beauty, unadorned is best adorned," she looked very lovely.</p>
               <p>Hermione formed quite a contrast to the bride, though their dress was not unlike. Dora appeared so modest and childlike, while Hermione, though but two years her senior, seemed years older, her figure was so commanding, and her deportment so full of dignity.</p>
               <p>Dora gave a large levee at the house, at which all her young friends were present. The next day they were to go on their bridal tour. Lizzie's school closed, so that she was able to be present at the marriage and levee. She appeared rather sad, and Henry Adams scarcely seemed to notice her through the evening. Adelaide was present, and kept much with her cousin, she was so delighted, she said, to be once more near her.</p>
               <p>"How very distant Henry Adams appears to you this evening Lizzie," said Adelaide, "I would not, if I were you, flatter him enough to let him see that it troubled me at all. Pray what is the meaning of all this my dear Lizzie."</p>
               <p>"Thee knows as well as I," said the artless girl.</p>
               <p>Yes, thought Adelaide, and perhaps rather better.</p>
               <p>In the course of the evening Dora, having, an opportunity to speak with Henry Adams, said to him,</p>
               <p>"I am sorry, Henry, to notice so much coldness between you and Lizzie Warren. I have no right or wish to search into the heart-secrets of another, but I trust if you have any regard for Lizzie, you will not trifle with her affections; there are few whom I consider possessed of more loveliness, not only of person, but of mind and heart, than she."</p>
               <p>"I have entertained, from the first of my acquaintance with Lizzie, an exalted opinion of her character, and would not for the world believed of her, what she has forced me, by her conduct, to do."</p>
               <p>"What has Lizzie done that is so unpardonable?" asked Dora, "I did not know that she was ever guilty of committing any very great sin."</p>
               <p>"You did not suspect her of being a coquette, then, did you?" said Henry.</p>
               <p>"That is the last fault I should expect in her," replied Dora. "It cannot be that you have proved her such."</p>
               <pb n="204-205" xml:id="VAC6293-00000103"/>
               <p>"I am pained to say that I have," he answered.</p>
               <p>"Pray explain yourself," said Dora.</p>
               <p>"I have nothing to prove by her writings," he replied, "for I received a letter from the principal of the institute she has been attending, at the commencement of the term, forbidding me to carry on a correspondence with Lizzie, while she was a member of the school. But I have heard from another source, that this is probably no privation to her, as she is much interested in the teacher of the school."</p>
               <p>"Indeed!" said Dora. "Where, if I may be so inquisitive, did you gain your information?"</p>
               <p>"Her cousin Adelaide told me of it," said he.</p>
               <p>"I should be loath to credit this," said Dora, "unless Lizzie, by her conduct, should confirm it."</p>
               <p>"I was," he replied, "and though I must confess I suffered considerably from jealousy, still I determined not to give credence to the report until I should see Lizzie; this is the first opportunity I have had of seeing her. When I first saw her I bowed to her, but she returned it with coldness, as I thought. If she had appeared glad to see me again, I should have joined her immediately and sought an explanation. I did not speak with her till just now, and she did not seem inclinced to make any conversation with me. Do you not think her conduct proves the truth of the report?" said Henry.</p>
               <p>"It certainly does appear rather suspicious; still I cannot believe but some misunderstanding causes her indifference. Are you quite sure but what your letters may have been miscarried, and thus have led her to think that you had changed in your feelings towards her?" inquired Dora.</p>
               <p>"We have not exchanged letters this term, said he; the rules of the school forbid it."</p>
               <p>"I cannot solve the mystery of Lizzie's conduct; I shall be sorry to find her a coquette," said Dora.</p>
               <p>Soon after this conversation, Dora sought Lizzie, with whom she had not yet spoken.</p>
               <p>"Good evening friend Dora, for such I must still call thee, though thou hast prefixed to thy name the sober title of <hi rend="i"/>Mrs.," said Lizzie.</p>
               <p>"And such I would ever have you call me, Lizzie, replied Dora. My husband, turning to Doctor Abbott as she spoke, is sadly afraid that I shall grow old and demure."</p>
               <p>"We all grow old full fast enough," said Lizzie; "childhood's happy hours soon fly away, and only<pb n="206-207" xml:id="VAC6293-00000104"/> leave behind their joyous memories; but methinks that Dora can never grow old, life will always be in its spring time with her, her heart is so light and happy. Let me congratulate you, Doctor Abbott, in your choice of a wife."</p>
               <p>"I am most grateful to you Miss Warren, for your compliment to my wife; you know we newly-married men are rather apt to be vain of our wives."</p>
               <p>"Thou hastsomething to be proud of in thine. Thou would'st not find Dora Grafton's every day."</p>
               <p>"Ah, let me offer my congratulations," said Adelaide, as she came towards them. "Cousin Lizzie is before me, but I trust mine may prove as acceptable."</p>
               <p>"The kind wishes of all are acceptable"</p>
               <p>"The kind whishes of all are acceptable," replied Dora. "I am glad to see Lizzie once more among us."</p>
               <p>"You cannot be more so than I," said Adelaide, "I was so utterly wretched after her return to school that I could not refrain from visiting her, though by so doing I had many obstacles to overcome."</p>
               <p>"Do you start to-morrow on your tour?" asked Lizzie.</p>
               <p>"That is our intention," replied Doctor Abbott.</p>
               <p>"Are you holding a <emph>consultation,</emph> Doctor, with these ladies?" said Fred Grafton, as he joined them with Kate and Hermione. "Good evening," said he, turning to Lizzie, whom he had not noticed before, "I am glad to see you here to night; how long since you returned to the city?"</p>
               <p>"Only two days," answered Lizzie.</p>
               <p>"I am glad you have graduated, on account of a certain friend of mine, who has been so exceedingly dull of late, that I feared for the consequences."</p>
               <p>"Where is Henry?" said he, to Dora, "I have not spoken with him this evening."</p>
               <p>"Not far distant," answered Henry, who happened to be near, and heard his name mentioned.</p>
               <p>"I was just saying to Lizzie that I was glad for your sake that she had graduated," said Fred.</p>
               <p>"Why so?" asked Henry.</p>
               <p>"For the very ostensible reason, that you could enjoy more of her society," he answered.</p>
               <p>"Thou art much mistaken Frederick if you suppose my society so valuable," said Lizzie.</p>
               <p>"I don't know about that," said Fred, "if I could judge my friend Henry's feelings by his sanctimonious face, the last few weeks, I should judge the time of your absence was very tedious to him."</p>
               <pb n="208-209" xml:id="VAC6293-00000105"/>
               <p>"Appearances are often deceitful," said Henry, endeavoring to force a smile.</p>
               <p>"I hope thou may'st have a pleasant journey," said Lizzie, in order to turn the conversation, to Dora.</p>
               <p>Lizzie had suffered much from suspense during the term; still she had entertained a hope that all things would be satisfactorily explained when she should again meet Henry. But instead of that he seemed to avoid speaking with her, and confined his attentions mostly through the evening to her cousin Adelaide; this of course, made her think that he wished her to forget him, but she thought his treatment of her unbecoming a gentleman.</p>
               <p>On the other hand, Henry had been aroused to jealousy by the reports he had heard of her, but determined not to believe them to be entirely correct, until he should have an opportunity to meet with her. As Lizzie appeared rather cool towards him; he felt justified in thinking that it was as he had heard from Adelaide, that Lizzie was more interested in Mr. Brown, the principal of the school she had been attending, than she was in him, and therefore, he made little conversation with her.</p>
               <p>Dora perceived that there was a great misunderstanding standing between them, but she was unwilling to attach blame to either of them, until she knew better the circumstances of the case. She regretted much that she should probably be absent for some little time; as she knew so well the innocent character of Lizzie, that she would not disguise from her the truth of the matter.</p>
               <p>She felt that Henry must be in the wrong to believe her a coquette, and yet she could not but notice a marked change in her treatment of him.</p>
               <p>Dora felt that perhaps she did wrong to entertain such thoughts of another, yet she could not but feel that Adelaide was a false friend to Lizzie. She knew her to be a girl of little or no principle, but she could scarcely believe her guilty of so mean an act as to attempt to destroy or interfere at all with the happiness of her cousin Lizzie. Still she knew such cases had been, and Adelaide for some motive or rather might be prompted to do the same. But when she looked upon the pretty innocent face of Lizzie, she thought that no one could wish for a moment to injure her; and she felt in hopes, that by the time she should return from her tour, it would all be explained to the satisfaction of both.</p>

               <p>THE morning after the levee, Doctor Abbott and his young bride set out on their bridal tour, with many kind wishes from their friends. They took passage on board the steamer <hi rend="i"/>Europa, and after a delightful voyage of ten days arrived in Liverpool; they did not stop long in the city, but took up their abode at the elegant residence of a gentleman, a friend of Doctor tor Abbott's, who resided a few miles from the city, who had obtained a promise from him to bring his wife to their home; here they enjoyed themselves much, everything was done to render their visit pleasant. They returned to Liverpool and took the Railway carriages for London. This part of their journey Dora enjoyed much; the smooth, level fields presented such marks of a high state of cultivation, and the beautiful hedges that separated one lot from another, showed the hand of taste and refinement, while they answered the same purpose of our homely stone walls. She noticed too the small garden plats attached to the stations on the way.</p>
               <p>The English railway carriage, differs from ours, being partitioned so that six only can be accomodated in one of the apartments, and seem more suited to conversation than ours. It happened that there was only one person beside Doctor Abbott and Dora in the section of the carriage they chose, and they fell into conversation upon the country and scenery.</p>
               <p>The stranger was a fine looking gentleman, of perhaps fifty of sixty years. His figure was tall and commanding, but there was about him a natural ease of manners, that proved him a person accustomed to society.</p>
               <pb n="212-213" xml:id="VAC6293-00000107"/>
               <p>Neither Dora or her husband could recall to mind ever having met him before, and yet there was something familiar in his appearance to them.</p>
               <p>They found by his conversation that he had been much in foreign lands. They were greatly interested in his relations of adventures of sea and land, for though he had seen much of the world, he was no egotist, and gave his descriptions in so honest and truthful a manner, that it made them doubly interesting.</p>
               <p>He proved to be an India merchant, who had been absent from his native land many long years. Circumstances he said had prevented him from visiting America, the home of his childhood, for years; his once jetty locks had turned to silver, and age had given to his limbs some infirmity. He was then on his way to London to transact some important business, preparatory to returning to his native land, to spend the remainder of his days.</p>
               <p>"You can little imagine, said he, "the feelings of one about to revisit the scenes of his youthful days, after so long an absence from them. He cannot expect to find home or kindred as he left them, but still one can scarcely be prepared for the many changes time, with his busy fingers, has wrought there, with the scattering of friends, some to distant lands and some to the confines of the tomb; and the havoc it has made with things familiar to one's childhood."</p>
               <p>"You will probably be scarcely recognized by your friends who are living," remarked Doctor Abbott.</p>
               <p>"I shall look about me for some familiar object; but in vain; not a vestige will be found; the finger of improvement will have so changed its appearance that I shall not be able to recognize it as the same. And thus will it be with my friends. Tidings have reached me across the water of the death of both my parents, but since that time I have heard nothing from my family. They, I suppose, consider me among the dead. I once had a loved sister, and I live in hopes that she may still be in existence, so that I may spend my last days among my kindred, and mingle my ashes with those of my parents."</p>
               <p>A tear glistened in Dora's eye as she said, "I hope you may find your sister still living."</p>
               <p>"I scarcely dare to hope it," said he, "for fear that death with his relentless grasp, may have made her its victim. And I, like the last leaf on a withered tree, be obliged to quiver alone a few years more in<pb n="214-215" xml:id="VAC6293-00000108"/> the breeze of life, and then fall to the earth, forgotten and unmourned. But, said he in a livelier voice, "I must not give up to melancholy, it may be that a better lot may be in store for me."</p>
               <p>"I trust that you may find it so," said Doctor Abbott. It would be a happy meeting to both of you."</p>
               <p>"Yes, if I could behold the face of my sister Hermione, life would once more look bright to me," replied the old gentleman.</p>
               <p>"Hermione?" said Dora, the name sounded so familiar to her ear.</p>
               <p>"Yes," said the old gentleman, "Hermione Gardiner was her maiden name."</p>
               <p>"I know a young lady whose first name is Hermione, so the name sounded familiar to me," replied Dora. "In what place did you formerly reside?"</p>
               <p>"In the city of N——," he replied.</p>
               <p>"That is the native place of my wife," said Doctor Abbott, "perhaps she may be able to assist you in your search. Was your sister ever married, to your knowledge?"</p>
               <p>"She was engaged at one time to a Mr. Phelps," he replied. "I have never heard of her marriage; but then I have received no letters from my friends for nearly thirty years."</p>
               <p>It occurred now to the mind of Dora for the first time, that some years before, a brother of Mrs. Phelps went away; and as they had never heard from him but once or twice, they supposed him dead. The circumstance happened before Hermione was born, she therefore merely knew of it, from having heard her mother mention its occurrence. But Dora remembered of hearing her speak of it. So she remarked:</p>
               <p>"I am intimately acquainted with a young lady by the name of Hermione Phelps."</p>
               <p>"You are?" said he quickly. "Do you know what her mother's maiden name was?"</p>
               <p>"I do not," she replied.</p>
               <p>"Was the young girl's father named Charles?" he asked.</p>
               <p>"He was," replied Dora.</p>
               <p>"It must be the same," said the old man with emotion, "for that was the name of the young man she was engaged to. I am anxious to hear of their circumstances."</p>
               <p>"The Mrs. Phelps that I have reference to, is a<pb n="216-217" xml:id="VAC6293-00000109"/> widow, her husband having died a few years since. Up to the year before his death, he had been considered one of our most flourishing merchants, but he became unfortunate and met with losses, which, at his death, caused his family to be left in rather reduced circumstances," said Dora.</p>
               <p>"This would not have been, had I known of it," said the old gentleman. "I have enough for both of us," said he, "and gladly would I have divided my portion with her, had I known that she had need of it. But as I wrote home several times, which for some reason or other, I received no answers, I gave up writing, thinking that my family had either forgotten me, or thought me dead. But as age crept on, I yearned for home and kindred, and determined to seek my native land, and if my sister yet lived, to die with her. How have they managed since the death of Mr. Phelps?" he inquired.</p>
               <p>When Dora informed him of the perseverance of Hermione under all her trials, and extolled her many virtues, a tear trembled in the old man's eye as he said, "Hermione will not have to labor for the support of the family, if I live to reach them. Those who may have scoffed at Hermione Phelps, the <emph>school</emph>
                  <emph>teacher,</emph> will be surprised when they know her to be the <emph>heir</emph> of <emph>a millionnaire.</emph>" He said this not to boast, but he knew the feelings of the world to those who, are more blessed with riches than others; and he thought that Hermione must have suffered much in her feelings to become suddenly transferred from riches to comparative poverty.</p>
               <p>Dora went on conversing with the gentleman, whose name it seemed was Gardiner, giving him al the information he desired concerning the family, that she was able to. It was interesting to observe the different expressions that played over the old man's face, as he listened to the words of Dora, as she went on relating to him every little circumstance that she thought might interest him.</p>
               <p>"My accidental meeting with you," said he, "has made up for many years of loneliness."</p>
               <p>Doctor Abbott, until now, had sat a silent and attentive listener; but he so well understood the character of Dora, whom he could not but regard with admiration as she patiently answered the queries of the old gentleman, replied, "I doubt not but it has given my wife great satisfaction to be of service to you."</p>
               <pb n="218-219" xml:id="VAC6293-00000110"/>
               <p>As they occupied the same hotel in London, they saw much of each other. Mr. Gardiner's business was such as to detain him some little time in the city, and as he had been there several times before, he was able to point out to them many objects of interest, which they perhaps would not have found. Dora was much amused when she looked at an old dilapidated chair, kept sacred in Westminster Abbey, which she was informed was the chair Queen Victoria was crowned in. Doctor Abbott had always read accounts of Nelson's naval battles with delight, and it gave him great pleasure to look upon his statue as it stands in Trafalgar square upon a high pillar, with his feet upon a coil of rope. It was an attitude so appropriate to his character. They visited most of the places of note in London, and spent as much time as Doctor Abbott could well spare, and then set out for home; so far their time had passed most pleasantly. Mr. Gardiner sailed a short time before them for America. They had a most delightful passage home. Dora suffered but little from sea-sickness. They enjoyed some lovely moonlight nights on their voyage. Dora would sit on deck until eleven or twelve o'clock at night, she thought the scene so beautiful. Oftentimes times Doctor Abbott would be obliged to warn her of the lateness of the hour, so absorbed would she be in the contemplation of the beauties of the deep.</p>
               <p>"How many," said she (one eve, as they sat upon the deck,) "who have lived and loved, now sleep beneath the wave. No epitaphs are written for them upon beautiful tablets,—no friends come to weep over their graves, and to strew over them their offerings of flowers. No solemn strains are sung over their inanimate bodies, and no pageant train followed them to their last resting place, but the wail of the wave was their requiem, and silent and alone they sought their watery grave.</p>
               <p>"Yes," replied Doctor Abbott, "Chapin's beautiful lines would well apply to your meditations: <q>
                     <lg type="quotation">
                        <l>"The ocean is beautiful lulled to rest;</l>

                        <l>Are epitaphs written upon the deep,</l>
                        <l>All over the places where lost ones sleep."</l>

                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>"Yes," replied Dora, the golden orbs of heaven shine upon the places where we take our last rest, whether it be on land, or in the bosom of the ocean."</p>
               <p>Long did Doctor Abbott and Dora converse upon<pb n="220-221" xml:id="VAC6293-00000111"/> the beauties of nature, and they looked through nature up to nature's God. Their sentiments were so congenial, that time passed swiftly on. Their voyage seemed short to them, though they were glad to arrive again on their native shores.</p>

               <p>DORA now entered upon her home duties. Doctor Abbott before their marriage, purchased a beautiful dwelling, which was furnished entirely to suit the taste of Dora; not a picture was hung or an ornament placed, without her taste being consulted. Doctor Abbott felt that Dora was calculated to make any home happy. Even the polar regions, he once remarked to her, would appear genial in her society; yet he felt that the happiness of his wife should be consulted on all subjects. He had obtained a prize, and he knew how to value it, which we fear some husbands do not.</p>
               <p>They now took up their abode in their new home;<pb n="222-223" xml:id="VAC6293-00000112"/> Dora assumed the dignity of mistress, and well did she fill the station; her home was a sweet place to her, and no charm was wanting to render it attractive. She moved about among her domestics, and managed all things with a quiet grace so natural to her.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gardiner arrived some little time before them, and sought out at once his sister and her family; great was the surprise and joy of Mrs. Phelps, on beholding again her brother whom she had considered long since dead.</p>
               <p>Their meeting was truly affecting; for nearly thirty years they had been separated. In that time, of course great changes had occurred. When Mr. Gardiner left his home he was then in the bloom of manhood, and his sister, Mrs. Phelps, just budding into womanhood. Mrs. Phelps had seen many changes in fortune; her parents were people in excellent circumstances. She had married Mr. Phelps, a young merchant, and he amassed a fortune, and she had lived in great splendor. But at his death she was suddenly deprived of the greater portion of it. These changes had made her prematurely old. Her brother it seemed had left his home to engage in mercantile pursuits; for some little time the family kept up a correspondence with him. But as he was seldom long in one place, his business calling him to travel much, they finally lost trace of him entirely, and were led to suppose him dead. The first cause of his going from home was an attachment to a young lady, who was forced, contrary to her wishes, by her parents to marry another. He had left the scenes connected with his unfortunate attachment, in hopes to forget, if possible, its occurrence.</p>
               <p>He had now returned laden with riches. He had the family removed immediately to a magnificent home, filled with every comfort and luxury.</p>
               <p>It was with great regret that Hermione was given up by her pupils and their parents, as she was much esteemed by them; though they were delighted at her sudden change of fortune.</p>
               <p>Now some of Hermione's former friends began to recognize her; some who did not know her as a school-teacher, now perfectly recollected her countenance in the heir of a millionnaire, as her uncle had prophesied, but to such she gave a cool reception. And to some, in the days of her adversity had scarcely bowed, who now came forward and begged to have the intimacy renewed, she was as cold as an ice-berg.</p>
               <pb n="224-225" xml:id="VAC6293-00000113"/>
               <p>Dora was sorry on her return, to find the breach between Henry and Lizzie widened, rather than made whole. Lizzie's sweet and interesting face, wore more sadness than was natural to it. And though Henry Adams endeavored to appear the same as usual, still he was unhappy. He visited the house of her uncle occasionally, but they came no nearer to an explanation, for Lizzie appeared silent in his presence, and he would not ask of her an explanation.</p>
               <p>Old Mr. Elliott noticed this growing coldness between them, but could not divine its meaning, he knew that Lizzie really loved Henry; why then should she be so distant in her manner towards him. Henry's visits grew less frequent, and Lizzie more sad. Adelaide still kept up her acquaintance with Frank Landon, in direct opposition to the wishes of her parents.</p>
               <p>Lizzie was one afternoon walking with her cousin Adelaide, when they accidentally met Frank Landon.</p>
               <p>"I am sorry cousin Addie, that thee still keepeth up an intimacy with the young man we have just passed; it seems to me, that it is unkind of thee to encourage it, after thy parents have requested thee to discontinue the acquaintance," said Lizzie, mildly.</p>
               <p>"You are very kind to be so interested in my affairs," said Addie, angrily.</p>
               <p>"Do not feel angry towards me, Addie, I only feel interested for thy sake," said Lizzie.</p>
               <p>"<emph>Some</emph> people are remarkably good," said Addie, "but I would like to know what you have to say against him. I suppose Henry Adams has been filling your ears with reports that he cannot prove."</p>
               <p>"I did not say that he ever had," replied Lizzie.</p>
               <p>"I should think he had better not," said Addie; "he once undertook to talk against him to me, and brought up the manner of his treatment to Hermione as something criminal. I would like to ask him how much better he has treated you. We can all see other people's faults soon enough, but we are not so fond of seeing our own."</p>
               <p>To this Lizzie made no reply, and Addie continued. "But do tell me if Hermione Phelps has become so rich as report makes her to be?"</p>
               <p>"Dora informed me the other day," replied Lizzie, "that her uncle was a rich India merchant, and that he has made Hermione his heir, on account of her noble exertions for her family, when they became so suddenly reduced in circumstances."</p>
               <pb n="226-227" xml:id="VAC6293-00000114"/>
               <p>"Now I suppose she will carry her head still higher. I think it a pity for one so haughty to come into possession of property," said Addie.</p>
               <p>"I think it is well," said Lizzie, "that virtue and industry has received its just reward."</p>
               <p>"Have you called upon Dora since her return?" said Adelaide.</p>
               <p>"Yes, I called the other day," replied Lizzie.</p>
               <p>"How did she know anything about this Uncle of Hermione's?" "I understood that they met him in their travels, and directed him to his sister," said Adelaide.</p>
               <p>"They accidentally met him in the cars, I believe, in going from Liverpool to London," replied Lizzie, "and falling into conversation with him, ascertained that he soon intended to sail for America, from which he had long been absent, to meet a loved sister, if she was still living. And finding that they resided in the same city that his own family used formerly to, he made inquiries that led to the discovery of his relationship to Hermione and her mother."</p>
               <p>"If it had been some people that had become so fortunate all of a sudden, I should be glad for them; but a person like Hermione, who was poor and proud, it is really provoking to have them have the means to look down upon others," said Adelaide.</p>
               <p>"I never considered Hermione a proud person," said Lizzie; "she is naturally very dignified and reserved, and then her early misfortunes have made her seem old beyond her years. I do not think she feels the least superior to others. But she has been obliged to do since her father's death very differently from what she did before, and she knows that some narrow-minded persons have thought the less of her for it; but she has had an inward satisfaction of performing her duty, that has perhaps lent to her manners a look of pride and superiority of feeling, which I do not think she possesses."</p>
               <p>"You have a very exalted opinion of her," said Addie, "but you mark my words and see if she will recognize her old friends now, who cannot boast so many dollars and cents as she."</p>
               <p>"I consider Hermione a person of too much mind to value her friends for their money alone, and if I were among the poorest of her friends should not fear that she would slight me on that account," replied Lizzie.</p>
               <p>At this time, an elegant carriage drawn by two noble gray horses approached them; while seated within, was Mrs. Phelps, Hermione and her Uncle.<pb n="228-229" xml:id="VAC6293-00000115"/> Hermione looked towards them and bowed with more freedom than usual.</p>
               <p>"How terrible good-natured some people feel in their new carriage," said Adelaide. "I would like to say in her hearing, that <emph>last</emph> year at this time she would have had to have <emph>walked</emph> through the streets, or else have taken the hourly, as that is the <emph>cheapest</emph> mode of conveyance."</p>
               <p>"Cousin Addie," said Lizzie, "I do not see as Hermione can possibly suit thee. Just now thou thought'st her cold and haughty; and now thee considers her too much elated and condescending. Thee must go to her thyself, and make thy complaints for her sins of commission and omission."</p>
               <p>"Hermione can do nothing wrong in your estimation I suppose," said Adelaide; "money will cover a multitude of faults with <emph>some</emph> people."</p>
               <p>"Do not let us become angry with each other," said Lizzie, "for so trifling a cause. Come, I have an errand in the next store to do for Aunt Elliott."</p>

               <p>SHORTLY after Dora had become settled in her new home, the hearts of Fred and Kate were made glad by the gift of a little son. The little one was a great favorite with all, but to Kate it seemed as though a new fount of love had been opened in her heart. She possessed many glittering jewels, but this was the rarest gem of all. It was a pleasing sound to hear the voice of that young mother chanting the low lul-a-by to the infant slumbering on her breast, that had so often held, as by a spell of enchantment, those who were privileged to listen to the mellow tones of her sweet songs.</p>
               <pb n="230-231" xml:id="VAC6293-00000116"/>
               <p>Mr and Mrs. Grafton were delighted with their first grandchild, their little Fred, as he was called. Dora claimed a large share in the child's affections, and he grew to love her much, and clasp his tiny hands with joy when she came near.</p>
               <p>It made Dora really sad to see the growing coldness between Henry Adams and Lizzie, she perceived that both were unhappy. Lizzie's health appeared so feeble that her kind old uncle urged the necessity of seeing a physician, but to this she would not consent, on the plea that she should soon feel better. But her pallid countenance in the morning, told of sleepless nights; and unbeknown to her, he sent for Doctor Abbott.</p>
               <p>"I do not need thine assistance Doctor," said Lizzie, "my Uncle is needlessly alarmed about my health. I assure thee, I have no disease about me."</p>
               <p>Doctor Abbott told her that her system seemed somewhat debilitated, and ordered some simple restoratives. He saw at once that her mind was more diseased than her body, and candidly told her uncle his belief, and asked him if he knew of anything that might worry her mind, and thus injure her health.</p>
               <p>"I have noticed ever since her return from school a marked change in her appearance; her aunt has often remarked it, and has been anxious for me to persuade her to take some medical advice, which I have endeavored to do, but she was very unwilling, so that I have delayed it until now; for a week past she has looked so pale, that I sent for you, unbeknown to her. You asked me if I knew of any cause that might disturb her, mentally? I know of none, without it arises from a seeming misunderstanding between herself and Henry Adams."</p>
               <p>"I have heard my wife speak with regret of this circumstance," said Doctor Abbott.</p>
               <p>'What the difficulty is between them," said old Mr. Elliott, "I am at a loss to divine. But I have noticed myself, that Henry and Adelaide are very intimate much more so than I should fancy were I in Lizzie's place. Whether she has noticed the same or not I cannot say."</p>
               <p>"I thought that Adelaide was engaged to Frank Landon," said Doctor Abbott.</p>
               <p>"I trust not engaged," he replied, "though she still keeps up the acquaintance contrary to the wishes of her parents, but I trust that she may see her error by-and-by. I am sorry to say it, but Addie is a sad coquette."</p>
               <pb n="232-233" xml:id="VAC6293-00000117"/>
               <p>"Henry visits here, does he not?" asked Doctor Abbott.</p>
               <p>"O, yes; but there is a certain restraint between them; neither of them seem at ease as they used to. Henry appears suspicious of Lizzie; and sometimes when Addie is present it would be difficult for one to decide which of them he was most attached to; you know that Addie can if she pleases make herself very agreeable, and he will seem, for a while, completely entangled in her charms; and then he will weary of her frivolity, and court the society of Lizzie, whose mind is more richly stored; but they do not appear as happy as formerly."</p>
               <p>When Doctor Abbott went home, he found Dora in the hall in earnest conversation with a well-dressed female and two children, a young boy and sweet-faced little girl. The face of the lady was turned from him and he did not know who the children were, till the happy voice of Dora exclaimed, "there George, is Willie, your little patient, and this is his mother. I have been trying to prevail upon them to stop until you returned to dinner, and now I shall insist upon their going back to the sitting room."</p>
               <p>Doctor Abbott could scarcely believe his own eyes, that the sprightly little lad before him, could be the same emaciated little being, whom a few years before, he had seen stretched upon a bed of sickness and pain.</p>
               <p>He gave them a hearty welcome, and they all entered again the pleasant sitting-room. Doctor Abbott drew Willie towards him, while Dora smoothed the glossy curls of the little Minnie. "Well my little man," said Doctor Abbott to Willie, "how do you like living in the country?"</p>
               <p>O, I would not live in the city again for all the world," he replied. "In summer we have so many pretty birds and flowers, and in winter the boys have such fine fun coasting and skating."</p>
               <p>"Then you would not come back again to live here?"</p>
               <p>"No sir, I should not want to," said he, "and I guess mother and little Minnie would not want to either. We have such a nice house now, and such a pretty garden."</p>
               <p>"Minnie loves pretty posies," lisped the little girl.</p>
               <p>"Yes Minnie," said Willie in his manly way, "but we could not have them if we lived here. Miss Dora used to bring them to me when I was sick, but I did not have any garden to take care of."</p>
               <pb n="234-235" xml:id="VAC6293-00000118"/>
               <p>"You must not say Miss Dora now," said his mother, "you must call her Mrs. Abbott."</p>
               <p>"I like Miss Dora best," said the little fellow.</p>
               <p>"You may call me so if you had rather," said Dora.</p>
               <p>"You would hardly believe that he would remember so distinctly, events that happened during his sickness, replied his mother. "He always has a great deal to say about Doctor Abbott and Miss Dora, and was much delighted, when I read to him from the paper, your marriage."</p>
               <p>"Don't you remember, Miss Dora, that you came to see me one day, and I told you all about my Doctor, and how handsome he was, and that I knew you would like him if you should see him?" asked Willie.</p>
               <p>Doctor Abbott smiled at his childish compliment and said, "Then I am indebted to you for a recommendation to my wife, and as I always like to acknowledge favors, I think I must bestow upon you some suitable reward."</p>
               <p>"Your kindness in assisting us to remove back to the country, was as great a favor as you could bestow," said his mother. "We met a kind reception from our former friends and acquaintances, and now we are in very comfortable circumstances." They conversed together till the dinner-bell rung.</p>
               <p>It seemed that after Doctor Abbott gave them means to convey them back to the country, and something besides to assist them till they should gain some employment, they got along very easily. Mrs. Arnold obtained a situation as housekeeper to a gentleman in very good circumstances, (a machinist by trade,) who, after she had been there some little time, offered himself to her. She had heard some months before of the death of her former husband, and therefore accepted his offer. She was now in very comfortable circumstances, and her children had a kind father-in-law.</p>
               <p>Dora made them promise to visit her often, and Doctor Abbott engaged to bring Dora to see them, in their country home. As they were taking their leave of them, little Willie said, "come to see us Miss Dora, and I will give you some flowers out of my garden, almost as pretty as those you used to bring me."</p>
               <p>Doctor Abbott dropped into the little fellow's hand a gold coin, telling him to expend it for books to read winter evenings; while Dora gave to little Minnie money to purchase a doll.</p>
               <pb n="236-237" xml:id="VAC6293-00000119"/>
               <p>After they were gone Doctor Abbott and Dora returned to the sitting-room. "Your life, my love, seems to be a mission of good; how many tears has your kindness dried? how many hearts have had reason to bless you? you have relieved the widow and the fatherless in their poverty and wretchedness. But my dear Dora, in giving to the poor you have lent unto the Lord. How great is the gratitude of Mrs. Arnold and her little boy to you, for your kindness in their day of affliction."</p>
               <p>"I am thankful," replied Dora, "If I have been the means of making the path of any one brighter; but it seems to me you were the greater almoner in the present instance."</p>
               <p>"It matters not to which of us the credit belongs," replied Doctor Abbott, "but let us go on casting our bread upon the waters, that we may have the satisfaction of knowing that we are not living in vain. We cannot always expect to meet with the gratitude we have in the present instance; but that should be no hindrance to our endeavors to do good. But, as I said at first, your mission on earth seems to be to do good, and help others bear their burdens. I was called this forenoon to old Mr. Elliott's to prescribe for Lizzie."</p>
               <p>"Is Lizzie sick?" asked Dora.</p>
               <p>"Her Uncle sent for me unbeknown to her; she declared herself quite well, and said that her friends were needlessly alarmed about her. But her nervous system is somewhat debilitated, and she needs some simple remedy for that perhaps, but there are outward circumstances that have a great effect upon her health.'</p>
               <p>"Does her Uncle have any suspicion of its cause?" asked Dora.</p>
               <p>"He has observed some misunderstanding between Henry and herself, and thinks that it may trouble her somewhat. He is entirely ignorant of the cause, and hardly knows whether to mention the subject to Lizzie or not. I think you will have to be the good Samaritan, and find out the secret cause of Lizzie's difficulty. I cannot bear to see two persons so well calculated to make each other happy as they, suffering, from all appearance, from some misunderstanding." Dora promised to go the next day to see her.</p>

               <p>DORA took a lively interest in the case, and when Doctor Abbott called from time to time, she would go with him, and spend many an hour in endeavoring to amuse and interest Lizzie, so to as to prevent her as much as possible from indulging in melancholy. She soon found, though Lizzie at first was very silent on the subject, that her hidden secret was the cause of her malady, and she determined to do all in her power to effect a reconciliation between Henry and Lizzie, or at least lead him to an explanation of his conduct.</p>
               <p>Henry happened in one evening to see them, and Dora ventured to broach the subject to him.</p>
               <p>"Do you not think that Lizzie's health is very poor this season?" said Dora.</p>
               <p>"It appears to be," said he with an half-averted face.</p>
               <p>"Do you not feel some interest in her case?" said Dora.</p>
               <p>"I should feel more if she permitted it, perhaps," said he.</p>
               <p>"There is a sad misunderstanding between you," said Dora, "and I think it a pity for the roses to fade from the cheek of one so lovely as Lizzie.</p>
               <p>"Cannot the Doctor cause them to bloom again?" said he.</p>
               <p>"I am sorry," replied Dora, with a roguish smile, "to deprecate my husband's skill, but he has used every remedy in his power to make her appear as usual, but all in vain. I have a strange fancy that you, in this case, possess a very potent power."</p>
               <p>Henry received her joke with a very grave countenance, as he replied, "Whatever power I might once have possessed over Lizzie Warren, is now usurped by another."</p>
               <p>"Do not accuse Lizzie of coquetry," said Dora. "I have been much with her of late, and I am willing to vouch for the truth of the statement, that she cares for none other than you. I sincerely believe your indifference to her to be the great cause of her illness."</p>
               <pb n="240-241" xml:id="VAC6293-00000121"/>
               <p>"You must excuse Dora for her freedom of speech," said Doctor Abbott, "I suppose she relies upon your old acquaintance as an excuse. But her nature is such that she cannot bear to see suffering of any kind, either mental or physical, without an effort to relieve it. And though in the present instance I think an interference necessary, yet, in most cases of the kind, neither of us would deem it advisable. But as a physician, I deem it my duty to effect a reconciliation, where the consequences to one of the party may prove fatal."</p>
               <p>"You have spoken freely to me, and I am not offended; now I shall take the same liberty with you," he replied. "My motives in appearing towards Lizzie in the manner which I have, will, I think, be excusable by both of you, when I explain to you the cause. I will acknowledge that ever since our visit to the sea-shore, I have felt a deep interest in Lizzie. As I became more acquainted with her, that interest deepened into love, and we became much attached to each other; her modest demeanor and serene disposition, completely won my heart. When she first returned to school, we kept up a regular correspondence, until prohibited from so doing by the principal of the school, as being against the rules of the institution.—He informed me that the punishment for transgressing this law, was dismission from the school; I of course did not wish to be the cause of her being expelled, and so desisted from writing.</p>
               <p>"I endeavored to comfort myself with the thought that at the close of the term, Lizzie would graduate; and then all restraints of that kind would be at an end. I supposed of course that she considered this as much of a privation as I, and was surprised one day to hear from her cousin Addie, that she should judge from Lizzie's letters, that she was in excellent spirits, and much interested in the principal of the school, who was a young man of about thirty. This of course caused me some uneasiness; but still I determined to wait patiently until the close of the term, when I should see her face to face. But every time I met Adelaide she confirmed my doubts of Lizzie's constancy, by accounts from her letters. Yet I was determined not to place entire confidence in these reports, until I was obliged to do so.</p>
               <p>"The first time that I met Lizzie, after her return from school, was at your levee. She did not appear much delighted to meet me again; and sought no opportunity<pb n="242-243" xml:id="VAC6293-00000122"/> to speak of our being denied writing. And I felt that if it was no sacrifice to her, she should never know that it was such to me."</p>
               <p>"I cannot understand this," said Dora, "for she once mentioned to me, that you ceased writing, from some cause of which she was ignorant, and that after writing again and again to you for an explanation, she gave up the attempt, and supposed that you wished to discontinue the correspondence."</p>
               <p>"There is some mystery here," said Henry, "can it be that the principal of the school, to answer his own selfish purposes, could have written a falsehood?"</p>
               <p>"There is blame to be attached to some one, certainly," said Doctor Abbott, "and the guilty one ought to be discovered."</p>
               <p>"I have heard too, that since her return, the principal has taken pains to leave his school, and visit her, as he heard her health was not very good. Now all I can say to exonerate myself is, that if I have not had reason enough to suppose that my company could well be dispensed with, no man ever did."</p>
               <p>"You have never suspected that your letters were intercepted have you?" said Doctor Abbott.</p>
               <p>"No, for I never imagined any were written," he replied."</p>
               <p>"Who informed you that the teacher had been to see her?" inquired Dora. "If I am not much mistaken, she once told me that he was engaged and soon to be married; but I will not be positive; at all events I can assure you his visit was only a friendly one, and he was unable to see Lizzie, for she was out of town, and he was in haste to go on further; he merely stopped as it was on his way, to inquire after her health, as she was not quite well when school closed," said Dora.</p>
               <p>"Has Adelaide Warren been your only informant?" inquired Doctor Abbott. "If so, for my own part, I should not rely upon it."</p>
               <p>"She is my only informant, but I have Lizzie's own conduct besides to prove it," he replied.</p>
               <p>"I believe Lizzie to be entirely innocent of the whole affair," said Dora, "I dislike to suspect any one of the blame, however."</p>
               <p>"Henry Adams now rose to his feet and exclaimed, "have I been fool enough to become duped by Adelaide Warren? could she have been base enough to contrive a plan to separate us? If so, thank God that I have not become more deeply entangled in the web she has been weaving. But what motives could she have had for so doing. I will go to her at once and demand an apology."</p>
               <pb n="244-245" xml:id="VAC6293-00000123"/>
               <p>Dora begged of Henry to be more calm, and not be too hasty in his movements. "You are not sure," said she, "that Addie is the guilty one; even though deception has been used by some one. Would it not be better," said she, "to first seek an explanation with Lizzie, or at least for you to let her know that you have never changed in your feelings towards her; and then endeavor quietly to investigate into the particulars of the deception."</p>
               <p>"Your advice is very good Mrs. Abbott; your judgment was good when you were Dora Grafton and I doubt not but that it is the same now. This is not the first time you have had occasion to check my impetuosity. I will act upon your advice. Nothing would give me greater pleasure, than to feel assured that Lizzie Warren was not estranged from me," said he.</p>
               <p>"You have certainly had sufficient reasons for entertaining unkind feelings towards Lizzie, and I doubt not, when she comes to hear from your own lips the cause of your indifference, that she will readily forgive you," said Doctor Abbott. "And while the world will give to me the praise of having restored her to the blessings of health, you will have the inward satisfaction tion of knowing that the remedy was nearer home; for her disease did not come under my power to heal."</p>
               <p>"Rather," said Henry, "should the credit be given to your wife; for she has brought about an explanation, which will probably cause the favorable results you have predicted."</p>
               <p>"If the praise is to be awarded to me," said Dora, "I shall feel doubly repaid, if it may only bring about a reconciliation between you. Nothing would have tempted me to interfere in a matter of this kind, had it not been for the deep interest I feel in the happiness of both of you. I am unwilling to believe that Addie would be guilty of conniving so base a plot against the happiness of others although I never admired her ways. If she did, I cannot believe but what it was begun in sport, and effected results of which she little dreamed. She could not have intended to have done injury."</p>
               <p>Thus was Dora ever willing to throw the mantle of charity over the faults of others. She was so innocent herself, that she was unwilling to consider others guilty.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XXVII.</head>
               <p>DORA was seated one evening in her little sitting room. It was rather cool and a cheerful blaze from the grate lent a pleasant light to the room. Her husband was absent and she was thinking over the singular circumstances that led to the sudden good fortune of Hermione, who had been in that afternoon and taken tea with her. Hermione had become a great favorite with her uncle, and he lavished upon her all that wealth could bestow.</p>
               <p>After the gas was lit, she employed the time by looking over some beautiful engravings upon the table. She now heard the steps of her husband in the hall, and went to meet him at the door.</p>
               <p>"I believe we are going to have a pleasant evening all to ourselves," said Doctor Abbott, "as he entered the cheerful-looking room. We will have a fine chance to talk over old times, and the pleasures we have enjoyed joyed in the past; and then build air castles for the future, in hopes that they will not fall like some of their predecessors."</p>
               <p>"Hermione has been in this afternoon to see me," said Dora. "She was dressed magnificently; I was just thinking over her sudden change of fortune. Her uncle has some little business to transact in the southern states, and he is anxious for her to accompany him, so they start to-morrow."</p>
               <p>"Hermione is one whom a change of fortune does not elate or depress as it would many," said Doctor Abbott. "Such people deserve to have money. She called into my office to day and gave me ten dollars towards assisting a poor family who are in much distress. I had just come from their miserable abode, when she came in; I spoke to hera bout it, and told her I was just drawing up a paper for their relief, when she took from her purse the money and gave it to me. I asked her to put her name to the list; she took the paper from my hand, and merely wrote, 'A friend, $10.00.' She handed it back to me and said, I am sorry that circumstances are such that I shall be unable to visit this poor family; if I were not to leave town to-morrow to be gone a week or more, I should<pb n="248-249" xml:id="VAC6293-00000125"/> certainly do so. She spoke like a true woman, as she is. Money has not made her the least proud."</p>
               <p>"I understand the benevolent feelings of Hermione," so well, said Dora, "that I doubt not but what she enjoys her riches as much for the good she may be able to do for others, by possessing it, as she does for any more selfish motive."</p>
               <p>They sat some time conversing upon different topics which were of interest to both, and every thing out of doors seemed so quiet, that they started at the sudden pull of the door-bell, supposing that some one was dangerously ill, and this was a summons for the Doctor. They heard the servant answer the call, but could distinguish no voices at the door. Soon he came and tapped at the door of the room where they were sitting, and handed the Doctor a large basket. Doctor Abbott took it in to examine its contents; on raising the covering that was thrown over it, the sleeping face of a lovely infant, of tiny size, was presented to their view. An exclamation of surprise burst from their lips, Dora hastily removed the warm blanket that had been placed about the child to protect it from the cool night air, when the little innocent awoke, and threw a smiling glance upon those around."</p>
               <p>Dora raised it tenderly from the basket, and kissed the little up-turned face. Then laying it in her lap called the attention of her husband, who stood looking at her, to the pretty dimpled hands of the babe.</p>
               <p>The tears stood in the eyes of Dora as she said,—"Who, with one spark of woman's nature within her breast, could have abandoned this little immortal being to its fate? What mother could have so abused the name, as to have deserted her little one?" The child still gazed into her face as though it comprehended the meaning of her words. That gaze sunk deep into the heart of Dora; it spoke volumes, and seemed to beg her protecting love.</p>
               <p>Doctor Abbott turned towards the basket, and found that it contained considerable rich clothing. Among some of the folds was a note, and a check for a few hundred dollars. The note ran thus. Take this little one to your hearts and cherish it, and God will reward you, and a heart-broken mother will call down blessings upon you.</p>
               <p>Doctor Abbott turned towards Dora to see what effect the words had upon her. Dora was clasping the babe to her breast with all a mother's tenderness.</p>
               <p>"Do you feel that you can assume the responsibility<pb n="250-251" xml:id="VAC6293-00000126"/> of mother to the little one, Dora?" asked Doctor Abbott.</p>
               <p>"I could not send it from me," she replied; "I love it already. No, little innocent, said she, clasping it more tenderly to her, this breast shall shelter you from the storms of life. God grant that both of us may be permitted to discharge faithfully our duty to this ittle immortal being."</p>
               <p>It was a touching scene to see those two, who had so lately plighted their vows at the altar, now kneel beside that pure young infant, and craving assistance from on high, to perform the duty of parents to their new charge.</p>
               <p>Dora gave to the child some nourishment, and laying aside the richly embroidered robe, substituted in its place a snowy night-dress; and nestling the child close to her warm heart, soon soothed it by her sweet voice, into soft slumbers. As she sat thus, with her eyes resting upon the sleeping infant, Doctor Abbott thought he had never seen her look half so beautiful before; it seemed to him that she was almost an angel in disguise, sent to administer to the wants of others. Her heart was ready to overflow with human love.</p>
               <p>Dora lay the tiny sleeper in its little bed, and then bent over it with a mother's fondness. Doctor Abbott came towards her, and imprinting a kiss upon her forehead, called her his angel wife.</p>
               <p>When they again took their seats by the fire, Dora remarked: "There is some great mystery connected with this affair. It is evident that the child is not of humble parentage, and this seems to make the act less excusable; but then we know not what might have been the motive. It appears from the note, as though the mother was, from some reason or other, driven to despair, and this must account for the seeming unnatural act."</p>
               <p>"I cannot imagine to whom the child belongs, yet it is evident that the babe belongs to some one who is known to one or both of us, and that it was a premeditated act to leave it at our door. It was at least the work of some heart-broken mother, who knows your benevolent character, and felt assured that you could never send so helpless and innocent a being from your home, my dear wife."</p>
               <p>"They probably knew to, that I should meet with hearty co-operation in any acts of benevolence, from my right-minded husband," said Dora.</p>
               <pb n="252-253" xml:id="VAC6293-00000127"/>
               <p>As Dora collected together the articles of clothing that had been placed in the basket, she found attached to a richly wrought blanket, a slip of paper, with these words written upon it. No stain rests upon the birth or parentage of this infant. Keep this and tell her 'twas her mother's hand that worked it for her darling child. In time you shall know to whom she belongs.</p>
               <p>That night, Doctor Abbott and Dora lay their heads upon their pillows and felt that, though they had assumed a great responsibility, they had discharged their consciences; and the sleep that visited them was sweet. Doubtless, loving angels hovered over their couch, and guarded their slumbers. As Dora lay wrapped in sleep, she dreamed of the babe. She saw it laying in the basket-bed, with its beautiful eye, gazing up into her face. Suddenly the babe became endowed with speech, and spoke to her with a voice of unearthly sweetness.</p>
               <p>"Mortal, to you I come,—receive me into your heart—and by following the example of Him, who once told thee to entertain strangers, for by so doing, thou mayst entertain angels unawares, you may, by this act of kindness, secure to yourself ample reward. Thy life on earth is but a preparation for another and a better, in the life to come. The good deeds you perform here, but advance you in the future life. On all sides are offered to you opportunities for doing good; if you slight these, you injure <emph>yourself</emph> more than another; for each one shall be judged according to the deeds done in the body. Christ has said, not every one that sayeth unto me Lord, Lord, shall enter into the Kingdom of Heaven, but he who doeth the will of my Father, who is in Heaven. Mortal, thou hast chosen well the better part; thy religion is of the <emph>heart,</emph> not of the lips only. The <emph>world</emph> may not call thee <emph>christian,</emph> but <emph>Christ</emph> knoweth his followers. Act up always to your highest convictions of duty. Go on doing good. <emph>Such</emph> mortal is <emph>your</emph> mission. There are diversities of gifts by the same spirit.</p>
               <p>Dora awoke, and found the little one resting sweetly upon her breast, and as she looked upon the innocent expression on the sleepers face, she thought within herself—Yes sweet one, I will receive thee to my heart, and if ever I prove faithless to my task, may the good angels again visit me in dreams and remind me of it.</p>

               <p>WHEN the babe had been with them a few days, Henry Adams and Lizzie called in one eve. Dora was delighted to see them together again, for she thought most probable, that a reconciliation had been made between them.</p>
               <p>Lizzie was delighted with the tiny beauty of the little Minnie, and caressed it fondly. "You have not lost your love for pets, yet?" said Dora to her. I well remember the day at the sea-shore, when you were so amused by the gambols of the lamb, and by the pretty white kitten opposite."</p>
               <p>"Those are pleasant hours to look back upon," said Lizzie, with a smile.</p>
               <p>"Yes, but they came well nigh being the last to our happiness," said Henry.</p>
               <p>"If we have been fortunate enough," said Lizzie, "to have this cup pass from us, we should cast all recollection of it from our minds, as recalling it will only harrow up our feelings, and cause us to feel aught towards another."</p>
               <p>"I have been on a voyage of discovery, into secrets, since I was last here," said Henry.</p>
               <p>"Have you, indeed," said Dora. "I should suppose by the satisfied look upon your countenance, that you found something pretty valuable to your happiness."</p>
               <p>"Yes, I did indeed; when I came to speak to Lizzie about a letter I received from the principal, it was all Greek to her, and we found at once that there was some misunderstanding somewhere, so I determined to search it out. Lizzie wrote to Mr. Brown, to know if any such letter had ever been sent by him. He wrote that he was entirely innocent of any such thing, but investigated the matter, and found that the servant had been bribed by Adelaide, to manage to destroy all the letters that Lizzie should send by him, directed to me. He also wrote that the servant had carried a letter to the office for <emph>Adelaide</emph> directed to me. Mr. Brown said that he reprimanded the servant<pb n="256-257" xml:id="VAC6293-00000129"/> vant for so doing, but he said that the lady told him she only wanted to have some sport, and teaze us a little, and when she should be found out to be the rogue, it would be rare fun. So that she managed in this way to blind the eyes of the servant," said Henry. Wasn't she a good contriver?"</p>
               <p>"Thee must have charity," said Lizzie.</p>
               <p>Dora could not refrain from showing a feeling of indignation, that one would spend their time so idly if for no other purpose than sport, but now that she knew the facts of the case, she could not but feel that Adelaide had some motive, rather than mischief, in doing as she had. But Dora was one who would never, by words of hers, aggravate a cause. She felt that if Adelaide had been guilty of deceit, her cont science would some day or other reprove her sufficiently for it. Henry and Lizzie would probably be more cautious in future than to distrust the honesty of each other without they first were certain that they had cause for it. She was surprised to hear Henry say that the rival he had so much feared was now a married man, and that when Mr. Brown called upon Lizzie, he was then on his way to the native place of the lady he intended to marry, to claim her hand in marriage.</p>
               <p>'He was a dangerous rival indeed," said Dora.</p>
               <p>"The course of true love never runs smooth, you know," said Henry, "and these little difficulties only test the strength of an attachment."</p>
               <p>"Perhaps, Addie has done wrong," said Lizzie; "she has carried her fun too far at least, but we must have charity one for another. Thee knows, friend Dora, that we are differently constituted; some are naturally more prone to evil than good, while others are just the reverse. But circumstances in a great measure make us what we are. Addie has not had the parental restraint that many enjoy, and she has been allowed to follow the dictates of her own will almost entirely. Thee knows that the infant mind requires a great deal of moulding to make it well in after years. Addie's faults are many I know, but I think we should overlook them in some measure, when we take into consideration the many circumstances that may have brought them out."</p>
               <p>"It is well that the sweet plant of charity still survives in some breasts, for there is need enough of it in this world, where all are liable to err. We must, as far as possible, endeavor to think that Addie was innocent of any intent to injure either of you, but if she<pb n="258-259" xml:id="VAC6293-00000130"/> was tempted to do wrong, and fell, her own conscience will punish her sufficiently," remarked Dora.</p>
               <p>The amount of the affair was, that her plot had turned out very differently from what Addie had anticipated. She had thought to so provoke Henry towards Lizzie, that he would never seek an explanation of her conduct to him. She had also thought that if while she was influencing Henry against Lizzie, she might win his love to herself. She would on many accounts prefer Frank Landon, but then her parents were so much opposed to him, that she knew they would never consent to the match, and she thought it would be a source of gratification to her, to hear people say, his choice is made, he has married the beautiful cousin, and forgetten the Quakeress. But she was destined to be mistaken. It would be well if more such plots were unsuccessful, before they resulted in more serious consequences to the parties concerned.</p>

               <p>IT may be remembered that Frank Landon made a threat to Hermione, that he would yet win a bride, and make her position so enviable, that Hermione would repent that she had slighted the second offer of his heart.</p>
               <p>Frank Landon knew that he was considered a beautiful looking young man; and he was well aware too, that Hermione had once loved him sincerely. And though she might refuse to become his bride, still he doubted not, but what she still had some of her old affection for him; and determined to annoy her as<pb n="260-261" xml:id="VAC6293-00000131"/> much as lay in his power. He became acquainted with Adelaide Warren, and as she was handsome and gay, he determined to make her the object of his <emph>pretended</emph> devotion.</p>
               <p>Adelaide was just vain and foolish enough to believe that he really cared for her, and considered that she had made quite a conquest, in obtaining the attentions of one like him. The parents of Addie feared is was indeed the case, that he was a young man of intemperate habits, and did all that they could to persuade Addie to give up his society. Frank Landon found that he met with no very favorable reception from the family, yet he determined to persevere and obtain her hand if possible. He knew that her parents had always been very indulgent to their child, and when they found that they would ruin her happiness for life, if they prevented the union, they would be compelled to consent. He knew too, that Addie's father was a man of extensive property, and his own had become so well drained by his manner of living, that it was necessary for him to marry one who would be able to support them in the style he was determined to keep up.</p>
               <p>All this did not disturb Hermione, as he had fancied that it would. She felt sad and pained that one naturally so well fitted as Frank Landon, for high mental and moral culture, should by his conduct, so bury those talents God had entrusted to him. If he had never deserted Hermione, he would probably never have drank so freely of the poisonous wine cup. But without her restraining influence he had been led to imbibe to his injury.</p>
               <p>Hermione longed to extend to him a saving hand ere it was too late; to snatch him, as it were, a bran from the burning, and rescue him from the inevitable wretchedness that must follow such a course of action. But pride forbade her from doing so. She feared that he might think she repented having slighted his second offer, and wished to win him back; when in reality she could not have brought her mind to uniting her destiny to one who was a mere wreck of his former self.</p>
               <p>She knew the character of Addie so well, that she felt that she would only cause him to plunge still deeper into ruin.</p>
               <p>Addie tried in vain to bring her parents to consent to their marriage, and they determined to elope, and the papers were filled with accounts of "a marriage in high life." They had resorted to this measure, thinking<pb n="262-263" xml:id="VAC6293-00000132"/> ing to compel them to become resigned to their union. They left behind them nothing by which they could pursue their course, for Addie so well understood the character of her father, that she knew if he should discover the fugitives, he would oblige them to separate at once. Mr. Warren was a southerner by birth, and very warm and impulsive in his nature. Addie felt assured that after his first burst of anger was over, he would willingly overlook all they had done, and receive them back to favor.</p>
               <p>Adelaide left her father's house in the dead hours of the night, at an appointed time, and met Frank Landon, who was waiting for her near by in a place of concealment. They hired a private conveyance to take them out of town, on pretence that they wished to visit a friend who was dangerously ill; and from that place took the early train of cars for parts unknown.</p>
               <p>Mr. and Mrs. Warren were almost frantic, when they found the next morning upon the dressing-table in their daughter's room, a note saying that when they would be reading that note she should probably be miles away from them, in company with one for whom she had forsaken home and parents. If you had consented, said she, to my marriage, I should never have been driven to this step.</p>
               <p>When Mr. Warren read the note, he stamped it under his feet, and denounced them both in no very gentle terms. "I will find her," he exclaimed, "and force her to return with me, and send that scamp who has enticed her from her home, to the lock-up if to no worse place."</p>
               <p>Mrs. Warren was a woman at heart, even though she had sadly neglected the culture of her daughter; and felt the anguish of a mother on thus being called to part with her only child, under circumstances so painful.</p>
               <p>Mr. Warren set out at once in pursuit of them, but his search was fruitless; he was obliged to return to his wife, and they suffered more anguish of mind than as though they had laid the form of their erring child down in the repose of death, and consigned her remains to the cold tomb; for now they felt that she would probably either drag out a miserable existence, and then die forsaken and alone, among strangers, or else return to them an unhappy and heart-broken wife.</p>
               <p>Hermione pitied them both from her heart. She felt that Addie had acted from girlish thoughtlessness, but that <emph>he</emph> had taken a step, that would plunge them both into misery.</p>
               <pb n="264-265" xml:id="VAC6293-00000133"/>
               <p>A month wore on, and the anxious parents were constantly hoping to hear some tidings from their absent child. Meanwhile the father's heart softened, and he would willingly have taken his daughter again to her home, and for her sake, have treated kindly him, who had brought so much unhappiness to his hearth.</p>
               <p>But they could find no trace of her, until about three months after the elopement, when they received a letter, to come immediately to her, as she was sick and alone among stranges. She wrote that her husband was descending a high flight of steps, that he misstepped and fell to the bottom, which caused instant death.</p>
               <p>She was now confined to her bed with a fever, the effect of the fright, but from which she was fast recovering. She gave to him the fictitious name they had assumed, and begged of them to come soon to her relief. "I have'" said she, "been guilty of a great fault dear parents, but I come to you a penitant child. I have time, as I lay here upon my bed, to think over the events and errors of my past life; and bitterly do I deplore them. If life and health are spared to me, I will, as far as it lies in my power, atone for them, by my future conduct. I would not chide you mother, for you have always been the kindest of parents to me; but I cannot but believe as I look into my heart, that there are <emph>some</emph> good seeds there, that needed a mother's fostering care to make them germinate. You know, dear parents, that at an early age I was denied the privilege of "home influence," and sent to a boarding school; there I have spent the greater part of my life. This may do for some, but to one constituted as <emph>I,</emph> it was the worse place for me. I was thrown into all kinds of society, and being under no restraint, chose those with whom I could have the most sport. My character has been moulded as it were among such. I have never thought much about the realities of life, and expected always to get along as I have done, free and careless. If, dear parents, you can see anything left to love in your child, and are willing to take her again to your bosom, she is ready to promise never again to willingly wound your hearts, by her misconduct. Your affectionate and penitent child Addie.</p>
               <p>Her father, who would have been destitute of a parent's feelings, if he had not heeded her distress, hastened to her, accompanied by her mother. They found her in a boarding-house in a miserable state of health. Her husband had left his affairs in so confused<pb n="266-267" xml:id="VAC6293-00000134"/> ed a state and so involved in debt, that she was comparatively a poor widow. Mr. Warren found upon inquiry, that he had drank to great excess, and visited quite frequently, gambling places. He was, it seems, returning from one of his midnight revelries, probably in a fit of intoxication, when he met with the accident that caused his death. Though Adelaide made no complaint to them of his treatment to her, the people in the house informed her father that he had been known to abuse her with his tongue, and had even been suspected of laying rough hands upon her. But it was most probable that he was laboring, at those times, under the maddening effects of liquor. Adelaide spoke as though, for the most part, he had been kind to her, except that she had been left much alone.</p>
               <p>When she returned with her parents, none would have supposed her to be the same gay beauty that she had been three months before. For some weeks she kept her room, and her bed part of the time. She admitted but few to her solitude; but among these was her cousin Lizzie, who manifested great interest for her in her affliction. Adelaide became so much reduced in strength that the Doctor felt fearful of her going into a decline. This, Addie was aware of, from the anxiety of her parents on her account. She felt so much shame and mortification, that it did not alarm her. She merely wished to atone for some of her faults; for she felt that she could never again, were she restored to health, mingle in society. She had become now so humble and penitent, that her pride did not prevent her from acknowledging her faults, if they were ever so great; she felt too that it would relieve her mind of a load of sin, to confess them, and ask forgiveness of those she had injured. She told Lizzie one afternoon as they were sitting together, that her present afflictions were hard enough for her to bear, without having her conscience constantly goaded with past errors.</p>
               <p>"I hope, my dear cousin, what I am about to confess to you, will not cause you to abhor me altogether," said she, pleadingly, to Lizzie.</p>
               <p>"Give thyself no uneasiness on my account, cousin Addie. I am sorry in thy present affliction that thou hast aught else to trouble thee. But remember that thy present afflictions may work out for thee an exceeding weight of glory, and that all the human family are liable to err," said the kind-hearted Lizzie.</p>
               <pb n="268-269" xml:id="VAC6293-00000135"/>
               <p>"My dear cousin," said Addie, "I have been a false friend to you, but bitterly do I regret it now, and humbly beg your forgiveness. Perhaps you remember that when we first met Henry Adams at the sea-shore he appeared more drawn towards me than you. I thought that he admired me, and endeavored by laughing and talking with Frand Landon to excite him to jealousy. But instead of this, it only drove him to your society my sweet cousin, and he found in your richly-stored mind, and simple manners, more to love, than he did in my transient beauty. The fact of your being my rival in his affection, made me angry with you, and I determined to have my <emph>revenge.</emph> I was wicked enough to form a plan to injure, if possible, his confidence in you. On my pretended visit of friendship to you, I wrote to Henry, and was guilty of using the name of the principal to carry out my purpose. The contents of the letter you already know. Thus far I was successful. I prevented him from writing to you, and then, by bribing the servant, succeeded in having all the letters you should send to him destroyed. Then, in your absence, I did all in my power to excite him to jealousy of you. When you returned, I had the satisfaction of seeing you estranged from each other, and thought my plans were coming out finely, when, by some providential means or other, you were led to see that there was a misunderstanding, and you became reconciled before it was too late. Thankful am I that the consequences were no worse. I saw that though you suspected me of being the one who had caused the difficulty, still you were inclined to hope, judging from your own innocence, that my motives could have been more for sport than to injure you. If circumstances had not led me to review my ways, and made me to repent of them, I should never have acknowledged this to you. Can you, my dear cousin, after this conversation, ever regard me with other than feelings of contempt?"</p>
               <p>"My cousin, I freely forgive thee. Strive to bring thy heart to a knowledge of thy ways, and humbly beg the forgiveness of God. Then will the white dove of peace again nestle in thy bosom; and if others censure thou wilt be in possession of a treasure that the world can neither give nor take away," replied Lizzie.</p>
               <p>"Thank you Lizzie for your kindness. But if I ever recover my health, how am I to mingle in society, and hold my head as though I were not ashamed," said Addie.</p>
               <pb n="270-271" xml:id="VAC6293-00000136"/>
               <p>"Innocence within, is a garment without, replied Lizzie. Strive, my dear cousin, to make thy bitter experience of great good to thee, and those who have before blamed, will learn to praise thee."</p>
               <p>After such conversations as these, Addie would indulge in giving free vent to her tears; but they were tears of true repentance, and were refreshing to her soul, and calculated to do her good.</p>
               <p>Towards spring, she began to mingle more in society. Hermione met her one day in the street, clad in her garments of widowhood. It struck a chill to the heart of Hermione, as she saw beneath the heavy folds of her mourning veil, the pale and sad, yet still handsome face of her, who had so short a time before, been the gayest of the gay. And then when her mind reverted to him to whom she became united, and of his subsequent horrid death, it sent the blood curdling through her veins. She was on her way to call on Dora. When she entered, Dora inquired why she looked so pale?</p>
               <p>"I was not aware that I did," replied Hermione," "but I have just met she who was Adelaide Warren, and the great change in her appearance almost overcome me."</p>
               <p>"Poor girl," said Dora. "Lizzie informs me that she has as much changed in character as in looks, and that now she is really lovable. She has bought her experience very dearly, but it may make her future life purer."</p>
               <p>"How is your little one?" said Hermione, glad to turn the conversation from the course it had taken.</p>
               <p>"Nicely," replied Dora, "she is just the dearest little thing that ever you saw. I am sure we could not part with her now; and I think sometimes supposing she should be taken from us as suddenly as she was left."</p>
               <p>"What name have you decided upon calling her?" asked Hermione.</p>
               <p>"I rather think we shall call her Alice," she replied. "You have never been able to gain any information as to her parentage, have you?" asked Hermione."</p>
               <p>"None whatever," she replied. There is something very singular about the matter. It may one of these days be proved, and I trust it will for the good of the child. I wonder sometimes if its mother is still living, and think, perhaps, she may have an eye upon the child."</p>

               <p>TWO years passed and brought with it some changes to all. Henry and Lizzie were married, and Mrs. Adams, Henry's mother, made it her home with them. Kate's health since the birth of her second child (a little girl) had been failing; and she had a great desire to return to Italy for a while. The Doctor also advised it, as he thought a change of climate might be of benefit to her in her feeble state of health. So that Fred had taken her and the two children to visit their grand parents. It was like parting with an own child to Mrs. Grafton, to have Kate go from her to be absent so long. And then she could not but entertain some fears that she might never return, her health seemed so very frail. Fred was anxious to gratify Kate, especially as he thought it might be of benefit to her, but he never for a moment had a thought but what she would return again, in her usual health and spirits. If Fred had known when he left his native shores with his beloved wife and children, that he should be compelled to return, with his two little ones motherless and himself bereft of his bosom companion, who was dearer than life to him, he would have left with a sad heart indeed.</p>
               <p>During their absence, Dora had received an addition to her family. A babe of her own now slept upon her bosom. But the little foundling (Alice) was none the less beloved.</p>
               <p>Dora could scarcely believe, as she saw Alice trotting about the floor, that it was the same little being, who, three years before, she had seen laying so helplessly in its basket-bed.</p>
               <p>She was sitting one day beside the cradle of her infant, (for she was one of those devoted mothers who could not give the entire care of her little ones, to nurses, who had little or no interest in them,) thinking of the eventful night when Alice was given<pb n="274-275" xml:id="VAC6293-00000138"/> them. The child was at its play and Dora was obsering its innocent gambols, when she suddenly turned from her amusements, and fixed her beautiful eye upon her, in that same peculiar manner, that she appeared to Dora in her dream three years before. Dora had endeavored to be a faithful mother to the child, and those eyes glanced no reproof to her conscience, for neglect of duty. And calling little Alice to her, she embraced her fondly, and imprinted a loving kiss upon the fair cheek of the child; while a secret prayer went up to heaven from her heart, that she might continue faithful.</p>
               <p>The child looked up into the face of her, who had so well supplied the place of mother to it, and seeing a tear rolling down her cheek, put up her little hand and brushing it away, said,</p>
               <p>"Don't cry mamma, Ally loves you dearly."</p>
               <p>For those few simple words of the child, Dora felt doubly repaid for the care she had taken of her. "I won't cry," said she, "if it troubles my little Alice."</p>
               <p>At this moment Doctor Abbott entered the room, and seeing recent traces of tears upon the face of his wife, exclaimed, "Why Dora, in tears?"</p>
               <p>"I am very childish I know," replied Dora, "but my mind has been reverting back to the time when Alice was an infant like our own that now lies slumbering in the same cradle in which I have so often rocked Alice when of her age."</p>
               <p>"Well my dear wife, you can have no reflections to trouble you, for you have been one of the best of mothers to the child; so cheer up, and read this letter I have for you, from Italy. It is from Fred, I suppose." Dora hastily broke open the seal and read:</p>
               <p>My dear sister—"When I last wrote you, Kate had recovered somewhat from the fatigue of the voyage, and appeared for a while really benefited by it; the fine sea-air seemed to have given to her new strength, but of late she has relapsed into her former state of weakness. I cannot bear to think my dear sister, that perhaps her sickness may be unto death. No, the very thought would madden me. I could not live without her sweet presence to cheer me on my way."</p>
               <p>"The children are both well, and mere idols with their grand parents. Fred will clap his tiny hands with delight, when I hold him up to view some beautiful picture. So you see, I can already trace a <emph>love</emph> for the <emph>fine arts,</emph> even in my boy. The baby has grown considerably in the time we have been absent.<pb n="276-277" xml:id="VAC6293-00000139"/> As to Kate, I shall make it my continual study to do all in my power to assist in her recovery. I have heard that it is sometimes of great benefit for an invalid to revisit the scenes of their childhood; to ramble in the same paths, to drink of the same waters and to bathe in the same cool streams. I trust that <q>
                     <l>"Twill soothe like a fairy spell,"</l>
                  </q> and I am determined to visit with her every favorite haunt her childhood knew, and strive to bring again to her cheek the rose of health, and to her step its former sprightliness. Her voice now is always tuned to some sad lay. It seems as though it was repulsive to her feelings to sing anything of a lively nature; she took her harp the other eve, and sang that sweet song you have sometimes sung together. "<emph>Take me home to die.</emph>" It seems singular, but she is impressed wth the idea that she shall never return to America. I cannot believe that this is anything more than the effects of a morbid imagination, brought on by debility. If I were to become deprived of the love and sympathy of Kate, life would be as a wilderness to me, without one bright oasis to refresh my weary soul. But I will not dwell longer upon this painful subject; yet I sometimes feel impressed with the idea, that my domestic bliss is destined soon to become destroyed. God grant that the day may be far distant.</p>
               <p>"I have so far been very selfish in my letter, and spoken only of ourselves; but, my dear sister, be assured that the loved ones we have left in America, hold a large share in our affections. I hope that at this time you may all of you be possessing that richest of heaven's blessings, health; without that, we cannot well enjoy life. I long to see your little one. Kate says it must be her namesake. If my dear Dora, the child grows up to be as good as her mother, she will indeed be a treasure to her friends. Remember us to your husband. We have sent letters to father and mother, so I have no word for them. But with love to all, remain your affectionate brother—FRED.</p>
               <p>Enclosed was a letter from Kate, the contents of which were evidently unknown to Fred. She wrote,</p>
               <p>"My Dear sister—Though miles of sea and land lie between us, we are not denied the free interchange of thought. I am again in my native land, and in the home of my childhood. These scenes are sweet to me, and I love them. My home in America was made an attractive one to me. The kindness with which you received me as a daughter and sister<pb n="278-279" xml:id="VAC6293-00000140"/> into your family, has made you very dear to me. But yet, when I felt persuaded that my sands were almost run, I longed once more for my <emph>childhood's home.</emph> The balmy air of Italy, I felt, would make my last days happier. And this privilege was granted me. But 'we cannot live alway,' and I feel that my career is <emph>nearly</emph> done. This life has been very beautiful to me, the trials and griefs, which many are called to suffer, have swept lightly over me. My life, to be sure, has been short, but I have enjoyed it much; and this makes me cling to earth; but the 'silver chord must be loosed, and the pitcher broken, at the fountain.' If it is my destiny to leave thus early this state of existence for another, I pray for strength to become reconciled to my fate, and to prepare for my home in heaven."</p>
               <p>"My husband and parents, either do not think my case alarming, or else are unwilling to believe it so. This prevents me from speaking of some things in case of my death, that I otherwise should. To you, my more than sister, I wish to confide the secret wish of my heart. It is hard for me to part with my much loved husband; but that parting is more painful when I think of the two little motherless children I must leave behind. I know that they are blessed with one of the best of fathers, but they will sadly need a mother's fostering care. Fred has often said to me in health, 'if you die, Kate, before me, I shall <emph>never marry again,</emph> but live on your memory.' Of this I should approve if I left no children behind, as I consider if a man is truly united to his first wife, he ought not to wed another unless circumstances are such as to compel him to do so. Perhaps you may think that I am in too great haste to make arrangements in case I should be called away, but I know my own frailty full well. I would wish, dear sister, to have some choice in a mother for my children. I would like to speak of this to Fred myself, but he will not hear a word when I refer to anything respecting my death, and tells me I am needlessly alarmed about my health; that he hopes soon to see me as well as ever; I am sorry to see him so much deceived. I know you will say my choice has fallen upon one well fitted to fill the station, provided she will consent to do so; that one is Hermione Phelps. I well know that she has received many advantageous offers, and I do not think she would ever marry for real love, but perhaps she might from a sense of duty. Fred<pb n="280-281" xml:id="VAC6293-00000141"/> would be to her a kind husband; and I should feel perfect confidence in entrusting my children to her care.</p>
               <p>"I have as I say, never been able to speak of this to Fred, but I hope to ere long; at any rate I wished to write this to you, as a proof of my request, if I should never make it known to him. Adieu, sweet sister. If we never meet on earth, may we be united in heaven."</p>
               <p>When Dora finished these epistles, she said to her husband, "I am afraid Fred will soon be called to part with Kate; it will be a great blow to him. The world will, I fear, never look so bright to him again."</p>
               <p>"I am sorry for him," replied Doctor Abbott; "his whole heart seems bound up in his wife and children. And they will lose a kind mother."</p>
               <p>"These constant partings with friends should warn us of our short tarry on earth," replied Dora. "Thankful am I that we do not now regard death in the light that people long ago did. For it appears to me if I had been taught to look upon God as such a God of vengeance, and upon death as the 'king of terrors,' I should have lived in constant dread of dying. I well remember of one of my school-mates saying, whose parents were <emph>strict</emph> orthodox of the <emph>old</emph>
                  <emph>school,</emph> and who had instructed their children that if they died in an unconverted state they would go to a place of torment, to be forever miserable, that she was almost afraid to go to sleep at night for fear she should die before morning, and be condemned to endless torture. Their young minds were not capable of reasoning upon the subject and it struck a dread to their hearts. How much better it is to teach the infant mind to love God rather than fear him. And how much better calculated to the childish mind is the thought that if they are obedient children, good angels will watch over their beds. I have often conversed with Kate on such subjects, and know they are very dear to her heart. She is light-hearted and impulsive, and some might be led to think her thoughtless of such things. But her piety fills her heart with love to God and man. <q>

               <p>THE GIRL who was in the habit of taking Alice out to walk, was accustomed to hearing the child's beauty praised, and was not surprised if a person stopped and spoke to her. But she came home several times and spoke of a lady who always kept a thick veil over her face, whom they met almost daily, in nearly the same spot, and who made it a point to stop and converse with the child. The girl described her as a very richly dressed person. She could not well decide whether her features were beautiful or not, as she invariably kept her face covered with her veil. They had, she said, so often met her, that Alice would exclaim as soon as she saw her approaching, "There comes lady."</p>
               <p>Dora mentioned this incident to her husband, as she thought it looked rather suspicious. "It may be," said she "that this is the mother of Alice. Poor woman, if circumstances compelled her to abandon her child to other hands than her own, and if she still mourns her loss, how wretched must be her life."</p>
               <p>"It may be that the secret of the child's parentage will by this means become revealed to us," said Doctor Abbott.</p>
               <p>A few days after this conversation, the girl, who had been out as usual, for a walk with Alice, came in somewhat agitated, bringing in her hand a sealed package which she gave to Dora. "What is the matter with you Martha?" said Dora, "you seem much agitated."</p>
               <p>The girl, who knew the circumstances of Alice's birth replied, "why maam, I really believe I have seen <emph>her</emph> mother," pointing to the child.</p>
               <p>"Why so?" asked Dora.</p>
               <pb n="284-285" xml:id="VAC6293-00000143"/>
               <p>"You know I spoke to you the other day of having met several times, a lady who always kept her face covered with her thick veil?" said Martha.</p>
               <p>"Yes," replied Dora calmly, "well what of it?"</p>
               <p>"I did not meet her to-day, in the place I usually do, and supposed we should not see her, but as we turned into a very quiet and lonely place she came towards us. Alice was delighted to meet her. The lady stooped and placed upon her neck this locket, said Martha, drawing from her pocket a beautiful locket, (which she had taken for fear the child might lose it) and told her to ask her mamma to keep it for her. She turned to me and gave me this package for you; and as she was going to leave us, she raised her veil to kiss Ally, and looked <emph>so beautiful</emph> as she said 'good bye,' that I did not wonder Alice cried for her to 'come back.'"</p>
               <p>Dora opened the locket and beheld a face very beautiful, but still it looked familiar, though she could not then call to mind, any one whom it might resemble.</p>
               <p>"What did the lady say to Alice?" asked Dora.</p>
               <p>"She told her, while a tear stood in her eye, to be a good girl, and to ask you to let her look at the picture every day," replied Martha.</p>
               <p>Dora drew the child to her, as though she feared she might be taken from her. She sent Martha and the child from the room, and then proceeded to open the parcel, which she found to contain several pieces of valuable jewelry, and a closely written letter that run thus:</p>
               <p>My Dear Madam—You will, perhaps, hardly credit the declaration that she who addresses you, is the mother of your little Alice, who was left an innocent babe at your door, some three years since. Deem me not an unnatural or heartless mother, or that the child was abandoned to its fate, and then forgotten. Not a night has passed since that time, that my pillow has not been wet with tears, and a prayer gone up to heaven that you might be strengthened to perform your duty towards the little one faithfully.</p>
               <p>Doubtless many times you may have wondered who were the rightful parents of the child, and if they still felt an interest in it. Perhaps you have forgotten that among your schoolmates, was one called Nelly Blanchard. Time may have erased my memory from you, for while you were one of the older pupils, I was among the younger. You probably regarded me as a child, for there was not so very great a difference<pb n="286-287" xml:id="VAC6293-00000144"/> ference in our ages; but I was so <emph>gay</emph> and <emph>frolicksome,</emph> and you so <emph>gentle</emph> and <emph>mature,</emph> that one would have imagined a vast difference in our ages. Well do I remember your kind and winning manner, as you would sometimes stoop to smooth my disordered curls, or to gently chide me if you thought me too rude. Little did you then think how your kindness sank deep into my heart. I <emph>was an orphan,</emph> and you knew it, and felt pity for me. You knew that I was deprived of a judicious mother to guide me aright; and was ever willing to encourage me with a smile to do as I ought. I loved you for this, and memory delights to dwell upon it. Would that we attached more importance to kind words, for they are to our fellow beings like way-side flowers. <q>

               <p>But these were my happy days; no lasting sorrow had ever clouded my brow; I was as free and gay as the birds that caroled their morning vespers in the old elm tree, front of the school boarding house. Would God had taken me home, in the springtime of my life, ere sorrow had made me prematurely old. But I will not give way to complaints, to grieve your kind heart, more than is necessary at this time.</p>
               <p>Soon after I left school, I became acquainted with a young man, who appeared worthy; we became engaged, and I was married the day I was eighteen years of age. I was young and thoughtless but we lived very happily, until the birth of my babe, (<emph>your little Alice.</emph>) He seemed to entertain a perfect hatred for the child. I knew not why. My heart sunk within me when I thought the little one that I wished to have brought up in love and kindness, should be the victim of a cruel father. My husband would often taunt me, that I had no relatives to love the child, and he was quite sure he possessed no love for it Such cases as these are <emph>few,</emph> and I trust they may always be. You who are now a mother can imagine my feelings. I endeavored by every art in my power to win the father's love towards the child, but all in vain; he seemed not to possess one spark of love for it.</p>
               <p>"With the exception of this, my husband was generally<pb n="288-289" xml:id="VAC6293-00000145"/> erally kind to me, but this treatment to his child I could not bear, and asked for a separation. He would not consent to this, but declared that he would not be bothered with a crying babe in the house keeping him awake nights; it should be sent out to nurse. My heart was sorely tried. I knew not what course to pursue. I thought at first of taking my babe and seeking another home. But the property left me by my parents was so entangled with my husband's, that I could not well do this. I had no relative to confide the care of the child to, and the idea of entrusting it with a stranger made me wretched. My tears and entreaties only seemed to increase his dislike for the child.</p>
               <p>"My babe was only two months old, when in one of my walks, my mind as usual dwelling upon my child, I saw a carriage approaching. I had not seen you for a long time, but your pleasant countenance had changed so little that I recognized you at once as my old school-mate. The gentleman who was with you, I supposed to be your husband, as I had heard accidentally a few months before of your marriage to one well deserving of you, and whose benevolent character was well known. From that moment my mind was made up. <emph>There,</emph> said I, I will seek a home for my worse than orphan child. Neither of them could be guilty of sending from their home a helpless little one, whom <emph>circumstances</emph> have deprived of a mother's care. From them my heart's treasure will I doubt not receive the kindest attention, and be brought up in love and harmony. I quickly retraced my steps to my home henceforth to be forever desolate, determined as soon as possible to carry my plans into operation, before my heart failed me.</p>
               <p>"I reached the house and went with faltering steps to the room where my idol lay quietly sleeping in its cradle, little dreaming that its mother was about to tear it from her bosom. I sent my attendant from the room, and with thoughts that almost distracted me, bent over the sleeping form of my lovely babe.</p>
               <p>"What was my duty? The child had but just commenced life. Should I bring it up to know that its father possessed not a spark of paternal love for his offspring, or must I send my child from me for other hands to mould its infant character? Must I look at the empty cradle and feel that my 'fondly cherished nursling from the parent's nest had flown,' and that its infant tongue would never lisp to me the<pb n="290-291" xml:id="VAC6293-00000146"/> name of mother? Gladly would I have wrapped it in its little shroud and consigned it to the Savior's bosom. But to give it to an earthly one beside my own, was maddening to my brain. But I felt I should not live long to suffer for the loss, for God would take me to himself, where I could be permitted to watch over it with a mother's guardian love, if that privilege were denied me here.</p>
               <p>"I knew that my husband intended to be absent that evening, and sending my servant away on an errand at some distance, secured the house to myself. While the child slept I gathered together all its clothing I had made, and taking from the draw a small sum of money that I had in my possession, which I wished kept for the child, lay them in the basket I had procured for the purpose. When I had completed all the needful preparations, I went softly to the cradle to take from it my babe, hoping that it would not awake. I bent down to take a last fond kiss, while the scalding tears rolled down my cheek; but duty called me to carry the child to a home of love. I raised her gently from the pillow, and lay her in the basket, with her clothing for a bed. I gazed upon it with more anguish than I should to have seen it in its coffin. But I hastened to throw a covering over the basket, for fear my strength would fail. I left the house, and, as I locked the door, felt as though it would henceforth be to me a living tomb. I reached your door, and lay my heart's treasure down, but could not refrain from looking once more upon its innocent face; from what cause I know not, the babe opened its eyes and smiled; this was too much, I felt that reason was deserting its throne, and with a nervous hand rang the door bell, and then with frantic eyes watched from the opposite side to see it answered. When I saw the child taken over your threshold, I felt that it was <emph>well with it,</emph> but I had received my death-blow. My mind was in so distracted a state that I missed my way home. It came on a violent rain and I took so severe a cold, together with the excitement, that it brought on a brain fever.</p>
               <p>"When my husband returned I was in an unconscious state, so I have since been informed, and they could gain no information whatever of the whereabouts of the child.</p>
               <p>"The fever left me but not the insanity. I have no knowledge of existence from that time until about<pb n="292-293" xml:id="VAC6293-00000147"/> two months since, when I partially recovered my consciousness. Soon after this my husband came to take me from the hospital, where I had been placed. He made no mention of the child, but after my arrival I heard one of the servants say, when she supposed I was asleep, that my husband thought that probably my insanity had been coming on longer than they had been aware of, and they supposed I had made way with the child; so that he had forbidden any one to speak of the child in my presence. I kept this knowledge to myself.</p>
               <p>"When I became able to walk out, I used often to pass your door in hopes to see my darling. One day I chanced to pass just as the nurse was taking it out to walk. I knew the child was mine, for I could trace a resemblance to myself and family in its features. I managed to find an opportunity to speak and ascertain her name. Every day I have followed in her footsteps, when she has been out with her nurse. But to-day my husband has informed me he intends to take a sea-voyage. I know that his object is for the benefit of my health, but he little knows <emph>my secret.</emph> We start to-morrow, and I shall never more see my little Alice, as <emph>you</emph> call her. Show to her every day her mother's picture, but tell her not, at present, her sad history. Farewell, my loved friend; be faithful to the little one, and may you receive the reward of heaven as well as the thanks of the heart-broken mother."</p>
               <p>When Doctor Abbott came home, Dora read the words of the poor mother to him, and said "I well remember, when I was away at boarding-school, of <emph>little</emph> Nelly Blanchard, as we used to call her; she was a rosy-cheeked, curly-headed girl, gay as a butterfly and joyous as a bird. She was kind-hearted, but her mirthfulness was so great that it would sometimes lead her into excesses. It always seems to me as though those who are unusally light-hearted in childhood, are destined to drink deep of sorrow's cup in after years."</p>
               <p>"It is so, many times, I know," replied Doctor Abbott. "She does not give her husband's name, does she?"</p>
               <p>"No," replied Dora.</p>
               <p>"I wonder if her health being feeble, is the reason why she thinks she shall never see the child again?" asked Doctor Abbott.</p>
               <p>"I do not fairly understand what she means. She<pb n="294-295" xml:id="VAC6293-00000148"/> speaks of <emph>her secret;</emph> it cannot mean that she contemplates taking her own life?" said Dora.</p>
               <p>"I thought I would not speak of it first," answered Doctor Abbott. "But her mind has been much excited, and even though she may now be perfectly sane in an excited state of mind, she might perpetrate an act, that at another time she would have shrunk from."</p>
               <p>"Poor creature," said Dora, "I wish I knew where to find her, that I could go and try to comfort her."</p>

               <p>A FEW weeks after the occurrence related in our last chapter, Doctor Abbott came home to dinner in fine spirits. It was a clear, cold day; the earth was covered with a thick carpet of snow, and the frosty air made every one step in a brisk and lively manner. Dr. Abbott ran hastily up the steps that led to his dwelling. It was always a pleasure for him to think of spending an hour with his family, for he was sure of a cordial greeting. It was a treat to him to enjoy the society of Dora and the children.</p>
               <pb n="296-297" xml:id="VAC6293-00000149"/>
               <p>As he entered the dining-room, the pleasant face of his wife and the happy countenances of his children, together with the smoking meal upon the table, presented a very pleasing picture to one who had been exposed to the cold air.</p>
               <p>He kissed the baby, and caught little Alice up in his arms playfully. "And now for dinner," said he; "if the taste is only equal to the savory scent, we shall indeed have a luscious meal; but a very simple meal would be delicious enjoyed with my family."</p>
               <p>In the course of the meal he remarked, "I have thought, along back, Dora, that you have confined yourself too much within doors for your health. You are over-anxious on the children's account. I should be sorry for <emph>Mrs. Abbott</emph> to lose, so soon, the fresh countenance of <emph>Dora Grafton.</emph> This is just the day to enjoy a fine sleigh ride; and I determined this morning when I went out, to make up if possible a pleasant party, so that you might have a merry sleigh ride. I did not mention it to you for fear you would think the baby might have a pain or an ache that you would not be near to sooth, or Alice should chance to have a fall and injure herself. Now I have examined the baby's pulse and find her to be in excellent health; and Alice's bump of caution is so large that I rather think she will not knock her cranium. So I shall hear no excuses from you. Mrs. Phelps is coming in to superintend the care of the children, and if you leave them in so good hands you can make no reasonable objections to leaving them for a few hours. You will not have more than time to dress yourself, and bestow upon each an equal number of kisses, before the sleigh will probably be at the door."</p>
               <p>"You do not intend then to consult my wishes at all in the case," said Dora, playfully.</p>
               <p>"No," replied Doctor Abbott, "I have prescribed for your case, and now I expect you to follow my advice. So away to your chamber, and don an apparel my love, suitable to keep you from freezing, after sitting so much of late in a warm room."</p>
               <p>Dora thought it useless to make any objections. And then it was so seldom that her husband took any time for recreation, that she felt anxious to comply with his request. Dora was bestowing some last caresses on the children when the prancing horses drove up to the door, shaking their bells right merrily. The Doctor handed Dora in and then sprung in himself<pb n="298-299" xml:id="VAC6293-00000150"/> self. The sleighing was fine and the proud horses drew their burden easily. There was quite a number of their friends in the party; among them was Henry Adams and Lizzie, Hermione and her younger sister, Hattie, Mr. Menton, and two or three other friends of Doctor Abbott, two of whom were single gentlemen, and acted as gallants to Hermione and her sister. Hattie Phelps was entirely different from Hermione, she was gay and lively, and was the life of the party during their ride. Hermione never attempted to check her gaiety, but seemed fearful (her own lot had so often been darkened,) that something would occur to blight the young girl's happiness. In their days of adversity Hermione had taken every hardship upon herself, and endeavored to shield her sister from them; she could not bear to see her blithesome spirit saddened. Now that they had become wealthy Hermione was not called upon to make these sacrifices for her sister, but she was as mindful as ever of her happiness.</p>
               <p>"I declare Hermione, you are the only old maid in the party," exclaimed Hattie. "I should think it would make you feel really aged to see so many of your companions married, and some even with families lies around them. It really makes me feel old to have so venerable a sister."</p>
               <p>"There are some," remarked Lizzie, "whose hearts are born many years after them. Such never grow old. Perhaps thy sister is one of them."</p>
               <p>"Why Hermione is only two years older than I,' said Dora, "and I am sure I do not feel old."</p>
               <p>"You will never grow old," replied Hermione; "your heart is too light ever to wither."</p>
               <p>"I should suppose we were really an aged group," said Henry, "by the turn the conversation has taken. Pray have any of you been finding stray gray hairs? For my own part, Dora, I feel as young as I did the afternoon we took that eventful ride, where you first made the acquaintance of him who is now your liege lord." This he said with a roguish smile.</p>
               <p>"Not so fast young man, that was not our first nor second meeting. If I did not fear that it would bring a girlish blush to the cheek of my wife, I would reveal to you all, where I first met her. Suffice it to say, that if a physician sees a pretty attendant, upon a poor sick child, he is apt to make his professional visits more frequent," said Doctor Abbott.</p>
               <pb n="300-301" xml:id="VAC6293-00000151"/>
               <p>Dora placed her g oved hand over his mouth playfully, and told him not to give so free reins to his tongue. "One of the party to whom you referred Henry, we little thought then would so soon be called away from earth. Your cousin Alice was at that time as happy as any of us now. And brother Fred he too is absent from us. He would enjoy making one of our company to-day."</p>
               <p>"How is Kate now?" inquired Lizzie.</p>
               <p>"Her health is very poor," said Dora. "I sometimes fear she will never return."</p>
               <p>"She would be a great loss to your brother," answered Lizzie.</p>
               <p>At this time the driver drew the horses up before the door of the public house, where they intended to stop and take some refreshments.</p>
               <p>They had a merry time at the hotel where they stopped and warmed themselves. There was a fine piano in the room, and Hattie sat down and commenced playing the "Sleigh-Bell Polka." They remained at the hotel awhile and then set out for home. All had enjoyed the afternoon finely. The glow upon the cheek of Dora, told that her ride had been of benefit o her. Still she was a devoted mother, and felt glad when the sleigh stopped opposite her door, and she saw at the window Mrs. Phelps, with the babe in her arms, and little Alice clapping her hands in glee at sight of her mamma.</p>

               <p>SOME months after Dora received the letter written by the heart-broken mother of Alice; she was called one day to the parlor to speak with a gentleman whose name she could not remember of ever having heard before. He introduced himself as Mr. Malcolm. "I called madam," said he" to discharge a duty of conscience, before I leave forever this continent, never to return to it. I am, I suppose, a stranger to you, and probably always should have remained so, had not circumstances accidentally thrown us together at this time.</p>
               <p>"You have with you a child whom you call Alice?"</p>
               <p>Dora replied in the affirmative.</p>
               <p>"I am," said he, "the <emph>rightful</emph> and <emph>only</emph> remaning parent of the child."</p>
               <p>Dora was too much taken by surprise to attempt a reply; and he continued:</p>
               <p>"Her mother was, I believe, a schoolmate of yours?"</p>
               <p>"She was," replied Dora.</p>
               <p>"She was my lawful wife," said he, "and we lived very happily together, until the birth of our child, the 'little Alice,' as you call her; and then our happiness ceased forever. I never was fond of children, and more especially girls. I wished to have the child sent out to nurse; but to this my wife was unwilling to consent. This caused her to appear melancholy, but if I had known the amount of injury that it would have been to her, I should probably have pretended a love for the child, even though in reality I felt none for it.</p>
               <p>Things went on in this way, until one evening, when I was obliged to be absent from home until a late hour, on account of business. I found on my return neither wife nor child. I inquired of the servant where her mistress was, but she had been absent of an errand to a distant part of the city, and when she came home, seeing nothing of her mistress supposed she had retired, and concluded not to disturb<pb n="304-305" xml:id="VAC6293-00000153"/> her. I searched every part of the house but could find no trace of them.</p>
               <p>I began to fear that perhaps while she was alone, some one had entered the house, and murdered them. It was now about midnight, and I was startled by a ring of the door-bell. When I opened it I found it to be the watchman, who was supporting the apparently lifeless form of my wife.</p>
               <p>With his assistance, we got her into the house, and lay her upon her bed, when she began to show signs of reviving. The watchman said, that he noticed at first, at some distance from him, a female, wandering about as though she had lost her way. He overtook her, and was surprised to recognize her as my wife. She had been out in the hardest of the rain, and her clothes were drenched. When he spoke to her, he said she answered him in an incoherent manner, and he perceived at once, that her mind was wandering. He persuaded her to go to her home; she consented, but her step was so feeble, that he was obliged to support her, and just as he reached the door, she sank into an unconscious state.</p>
               <p>I sent immediately for a physician, and he pronounced her case brain fever. For many weeks she lay as it were at the door of death. But in all her delirium, she never revealed the fate of the child. The physician thought most probable that she had destroyed it in her delirium, and forbid mention of it being made in her presence, for fear of making her raving. The fever turned upon her brain, and left her as we feared, hopelessly insane. She was conveyed to the hospital, but recovered partially in about two years.</p>
               <p>When we thought her able, I had her taken home. She never mentioned the child's name any more than as though she had never possessed one.</p>
               <p>As her health seemed rather poor the Doctor advised a sea-voyage. When I mentioned it to her, she made no objections, but seemed very sad.</p>
               <p>On the voyage she appeared perfectly sane, but very thoughtful; and I noticed that she spent considerable time in writing, and that she was very careful to conceal anything she might write.</p>
               <p>I was not at all surprised; for at home before her child was born, she would often amuse herself by writing verses, as she had quite a taste for it. One night about midnight, we were startled by a loud cry from the watch on deck, and then there was a great<pb n="306-307" xml:id="VAC6293-00000154"/> noise and confusion. I hastened as soon as possible to the spot, and found those who had collected, busy in lowering the boat, in order to rescue one from the waves. Imagine my feelings, madam, when the nearly lifeless form of <emph>my wife,</emph> was placed before me upon the deck. Everything that could be done to restore her to life was tried, but all to no purpose. <emph>She was dead.</emph> It seemed that the watch heard a plunge from the ship, and fearing that some one had risen in their sleep, and fell overboard, instantly raised an alarm, but ere the body could be rescued, life was nearly extinct.</p>
               <p>In looking over some writings she had left, I found that it was her intention when she left home never to return. She revealed to me the fate of the child, and requested that her property should be given to it.</p>
               <p>I find my dear madam that my conduct has been the entire cause of my wife's insanity and death. I wish as far as it is in my power to make up to the child, for the wrong I have done the mother. Here," said he, "is the property which formerly belonged to my wife," handing to Dora the deeds and checks that he had brought. "I have so far obeyed one of her last requests."</p>
               <p>If you have become weary of the child, you need not be burdened with her longer, though I know I am unfit to take the care. This, madam, has been to me a painful task, but I felt that I owed it to the <emph>living</emph> and the <emph>dead,</emph> to my wife, and child." He manifested considerable emotion, and though Dora had previously regarded the father of Alice as a sort of monster, she found he possessed some human feelings. And though she thought he had been guilty of great and glaring faults, she knew that his own conscience was sufficient punishment to him, without her adding to it by words of hers.</p>
               <p>"I could not," said Dora, "think of parting with the child; she is as dear to me as though she were my own. I had the care of her when she was so very young that she seems the same to me."</p>
               <p>"My wife informed me in a letter which I found, that she had entrusted the child to those who had been faithful to the charge," said he.</p>
               <p>"We have endeavored to do so," said Dora. Would you like to see little Alice?" she inquired.</p>
               <p>"I would," he replied.</p>
               <p>Dora rang for Martha to bring the child. She came running in all smiles, but when she saw the gentleman,<pb n="308-309" xml:id="VAC6293-00000155"/> clung close to Dora. This was unusual for her; she generally thought it quite a privilege to be able to be in the parlor when her mamma had callers, and loved dearly to converse with them. She was now four years old, and very interesting in her manners.</p>
               <p>"Go and speak to the gentleman," said Dora.</p>
               <p>"I had rather not," she replied.</p>
               <p>"Why?" asked Dora.</p>
               <p>"He don't look as though he loved little girls," replied the child.</p>
               <p>Dora saw that Mr. Malcolm felt the childish rebuke, and said, "This gentleman, Alice, has seen the lady whose picture you love so well to look at."</p>
               <p>"What, my other mamma?" asked the child. Have you?" said she, addressing Mr. Malcolm.</p>
               <p>"Yes," he replied, drawing from his pocket a locket with a picture he had persuaded his wife to sit for, a short time before her death. "Come and see this, and see if it looks like the one you have."</p>
               <p>The child now went to him, and after she had looked at the picture, said with tearful eyes, "where did you get my mamma? I thought it was up stairs."</p>
               <p>"And so it is," replied Dora; "this is another picture, and this gentleman is your father, my dear."</p>
               <p>The child looked up in surprise; she had never known or heard of any other father than Doctor Abbott, and replied, "I havn't got but one father besides God, and that is papa Abbott."</p>
               <p>Even the stout heart of Mr. Malcolm could not withstand the effects of the child's words, and tears flowed from his eyes.</p>
               <p>When Alice saw these, her affectionate little heart was touched, and though she seemed to feel repulsed at first from him, now she was as anxious to make friends with him. So rising up on tiptoe, she put her little white arm round his neck, and said, "you may be my papa if you won't cry."</p>
               <p>"I will be a father to you, and a faithful one too," he replied, as he caught the child convulsively to his breast.</p>
               <p>"Now I shall have two papa's," said the child, "and one real mamma and a picture one."</p>
               <p>Dora saw that the heart of Mr. Malcolm had been completely taken captive by the child's winning ways, and she felt sincere pity for him. She went towards him and said in as firm a voice as she could command, while she extended to him her hand, "Let the past be forgotten. Sad as may your reflections be to you, still<pb n="310-311" xml:id="VAC6293-00000156"/> hope on. Human beings are frail at best, and some fall more easily than others; but we ought ever to be ready with a mantle of charity, to throw over the faults of our neighbors, and like the poet be able to say: <q>

               <p>WHEN Doctor Abbott came home to tea, Dora managed to find an opportunity to speak with him before he went into the parlor, and informed him who their guest was.</p>
               <p>When Dora introduced him to Mr. Malcolm, Little Alice, who was sitting upon the knee of her newly, found father, jumped down, and running to Doctor Abbott exclaimed, "Papa Abbott, you can't have but half my heart now, for half is God's and half yours, and the other half I am going to give to <emph>that</emph> papa," pointing as she spoke to Mr. Malcolm.</p>
               <p>"You are very free with your heart," said Doctor Abbott; "but what is mother to do if you give all your heart away, and leave none for her?"</p>
               <pb n="312-313" xml:id="VAC6293-00000157"/>
               <p>The child looked perplexed for a moment and then said "O, I've got another half for her."</p>
               <p>They could not refrain from smiling at her innocence. Doctor Abbott conversed with Mr. Malcolm upon different subjects during tea-hour. He seemed to be a person who was very well informed, and quite interesting in conversation.</p>
               <p>Soon after tea, Mr. Malcolm took his departure promising to call often. The nurse came to take Alice to bed, and Doctor Abbott's conversation turned upon him who had just left them.</p>
               <p>"He does not appear like a person," said he, "who would ill-treat his family."</p>
               <p>"His wife in her letter, speaks as though he was as a general thing, kind to her; but he seemed to have an aversion to the child," replied Dora.</p>
               <p>"I have heard of similar cases before," said Doctor Abbott. "It does not seem possible, I know, for a father to dislike his own child, and yet it sometimes occurs. I once knew a lady who had been married several years before her child was born, (a little boy). The father showed almost hatred to it, from the moment it first drew breath. From what cause was never known. The mother was always fearful that the child would annoy him, and was careful to have him eat his supper, and be safely in bed before his father returned from his business. I do not know that he ever abused the child, but appeared to never want to have him in sight."</p>
               <p>"It is well," replied Dora, "that such cases are not more frequent. But it is evident that Alice has by her innocence and affection, touched the secret springs of the heart of Mr. Malcolm."</p>
               <p>Doctor Abbott now took out his watch, and informed Dora that he had an engagement out that eve, and asked her if he should not bring Hermione to spend the time with her.</p>
               <p>Dora replied that she should be pleased to have him do so. And Doctor Abbott set out to accompany her over.</p>
               <p>It happened that there were no other callers in, and Dora and Hermione had a fine opportunity to converse together. Dora related to her the singular circumstances connected with their visitor; and the acknowledgment of Mr. Malcolm, that he was the rightful father of Alice.</p>
               <p>Their conversation then turned upon Kate.</p>
               <p>"How long since you heard from them?" inquired Hermione.</p>
               <pb n="314-315" xml:id="VAC6293-00000158"/>
               <p>"Mother received a letter from Fred a day or two since," replied Dora.</p>
               <p>"Does Kate's health improve any?" asked Hermione.</p>
               <p>"Fred wrote that she seemed to fail almost daily," replied Dora. "I think he begins to fear that she will never recover."</p>
               <p>"Her death would be a great shock to your brother," said Hermione.</p>
               <p>"It would indeed," replied Dora, "and only to think of those two little ones who will become deprived of a mother's care. I hardly know how Fred will bear up under his affliction."</p>
               <p>"Who would take the care of the children, in case of her death," inquired Hermione, "would they remain there, or return to America, do you suppose?"</p>
               <p>"I do not think that Fred would feel as though he could possibly leave them behind, and you know he would feel obliged to return. Mother will probably take the care of them, until Fred makes up his mind what is best for him to do. I think that Kate would prefer for him, after a suitable time, to marry again," said Dora, "provided he should choose one who would be a good wife, and mother to his little ones."</p>
               <p>"I do not blame her for feeling that she would like for her children to have a mother, if he should choose one who was calculated to discharge her duty faithfully to them; but still were I the wife of a husband to whom I had been devotedly attached, and I knew that soon we must be called to part with each other, I do not think I could bring my mind into a willingness to have him ever marry again; though I should say nothing to prevent him from so doing. It seems wrong to me, for one who has been truly mated in first marriage, ever to enter into the same relation a second time." This Hermione said calmly.</p>
               <p>"I cannot say," replied Dora, "but what I should feel the same as you, and yet I am not quite sure but that it displays a selfish love. Circumstances, you know, alter cases. Now as it is with Fred, he is young and needs a home for himself and children. If he remains single, only think what a lonely life he must lead."</p>
               <p>"I do not think we can avoid some selfishness in this world," said Hermione, "and I feel some principle as well as selfishness about this matter. It does not appear <emph>right</emph> to me. But then I know my disposition to be different from many persons. If I once<pb n="316-317" xml:id="VAC6293-00000159"/> loved a husband I could never become attached to another. And to me, it seems wrong for two who have no sympathy for each other, to call themselves husband and wife."</p>
               <p>"I agree with you there," said Dora, "I think that inharmonious marriages are of great evil to the world. It can scarcely be expected that children of such parents, will prove as useful members of society. For their home influence will be against it."</p>
               <p>"Those children are very interesting," said Hermione. "I think that if Kate could be spared to them she would prove an excellent mother."</p>
               <p>"I received a letter from Kate, a while ago. She spoke of her own frailty, and her fear that she should soon be called away from Fred and the children. She said too, that it would be her wish for Fred to marry again, and choose one who would be a good wife to him, and kind mother for the children. She even went so far as to mention one whom it would be her desire for him to wed."</p>
               <p>"Indeed," said Hermione.</p>
               <p>"Yes, and I suppose you would be more surprised should I tell you who that <emph>one</emph> was. Kate wrote that she had never mentioned the subject to Fred, as he could not bear to think of any thing connected with her death. But," said Dora, "Kate expressed to me a wish, that if she should be taken from her family, that <emph>you</emph> might supply her loss to them. She felt such confidence in you."</p>
               <p>"I feel that she bestowed upon me an unmerited compliment, in expressing such to be her desire; for I well know my own faults and do not consider myself a suitable person to assume such a responsibility, even were I disposed to do so. My nature is too cold for the warm hearts of childhood. Besides, I should never prove a congenial companion for your brother. But Dora," said she, "if I understand aright your brother's nature, he will never marry again. He has lived a very united life with Kate, and he would never be able to forget her enough to make another wife happy."</p>
               <p>"It may be as you say," replied Dora.</p>
               <p>"You remember a conversation we once had," said Hermione, "at the sea-shore, after my accidental meeting with Frank Landon. I told you then that I believed in <emph>first love,</emph> and I have never changed my opinion. Nothing would tempt me to stand before the altar and promise to give my heart to another, when I felt in reality I had none to give."</p>
               <pb n="318-319" xml:id="VAC6293-00000160"/>
               <p>"I fear there are too many such instances," said Dora. "But sometimes I think people become married who are far from being congenial to each other; in that case, I consider it perfectly right to marry again. But Hermoine, there are some people who do not have these scruples of conscience about the matter. And I do not think with some, that it signifies because a widower marries again, that he never cared for his first wife, or that he has forgotten her entirely. They appear to agree with scripture, in thinking that in heaven they neither marry nor are given in marriage, and that it matters not how many they unite their earthly destiny with. This view may be entirely correct, but it does not harmonize with my belief altogether."</p>
               <p>"Mr. Menton has never married again," said Hermione. "I believe him to be a sincere mourner for the loss of Alice."</p>
               <p>"I think that he is, and that he would not were he so disposed, marry again, as he feels that he is not capable of making a wife happy."</p>
               <p>"Have you seen much of Adelaide, lately?" asked Hermione.</p>
               <p>"I meet her occasionally at Lizzie's, she is very much changed for the better," replied Dora. "Lizzie says she never enjoyed her society more than she does now."</p>
               <p>"How kind it is in Lizzie to overlook all the injury she tried to do her," said Hermione.</p>
               <p>Here their coversation was interrupted by the return of Doctor Abbott. "I went in to see your Mother this eve, Dora," said he, "as I found I was rather early for the lecture. She says that she is lone y, and wants you to take the children and spend the day with her to-morrow." They sat chatting a few moments and then Hermione felt that she ought to be going home.</p>

               <p>THE next day Dora started to spend the day with her mother, unexpectedly to her. Mrs. Grafton had sent for Hermione and Lizzie, thinking to make it seem like old times again to have Dora at home, and to have Hermione and Lizzie as visitors.</p>
               <p>"I do not see that thy mother looks older than she <unclear>did five years</unclear> ago, Dora," said Lizzie. "It seems as though we were transported back to the time when this roof was thy home. Some changes have taken place since then."</p>
               <p>"There has indeed," said Dora. "I can scarcely believe that I was once a tiny child, trotting about these same rooms, as these children now are."</p>
               <p>"None of you appear so little changed to me as Hermione," said Mrs. Grafton.</p>
               <p>"I am glad you think so, for uncle and Hattie are continually teazing me about growing old. I tell them they are terribly afraid I shall be an old maid, and that they will always have my society."</p>
               <p>"I rather think your uncle would be sorry to have you anything else," said Mrs. Grafton.</p>
               <p>"Yes, I sometimes tell him if he lays it so much to heart, he ought to marry me himself," said Hermione, "as I fear no one else ever will."</p>
               <p>The day wore pleasantly away, till Mr. Grafton came home from his business. Dora knew, the moment she caught a glimpse of her father's face, that he had something upon his mind that was painful; for though he endeavored to greet them all cordially, and kiss the children, there was all the time a forced cheerfulness upon his countenance. Turning to Mrs. Grafton he said, "I have a letter from Fred, and I fear there is bad news in it, for the seal is black. They all feared at once that it contained tidings of the death of Kate. It was directed to Mrs. Grafton, and when<pb n="322-323" xml:id="VAC6293-00000162"/> the seal was broken, found to contain these words, which Dora read aloud, as all were anxious to hear:</p>
               <p>My Dear Mother—Many times when absent have I taken my pen to write you, but never with such painful feelings as I do to-night. My pen almost refuses to write the words, that <emph>Kate is no more.</emph> She has passed from earth to heaven. Of her it may be truly said, <q>
                     <lg type="quotation">
                        <l>"Thine innocent heart hath passed through a pure life,</l>
                        <l>Like a white dove, wing-sunned through the blue sky."</l>
                     </lg>
                  </q> I feel that if it were not for my children I should have no desire to live. I have written you in my last letters that Kate continued to fail; her decay was gradual but certain. She was perfectly conscious of the fate that awaited her, and resigned to the will of God. The most that troubled her in her last hours was the thoughts of those she must leave behind; of the loneliness of my lot, and of her little ones who at her death would be motherless. Not one of her loved friends but what she thought and spoke of often in her sickness. She loved to speak of the happy hours she had spent among you, and the hopes she had entertained of long life. She had never seen anything but brightness in this world, she said, and it made her cling to it with a firmer grasp. But she is gone, and I feel like one "midway to death, left sad and lone." But, my dear mother, the sweet words of hope to the mourner's heart are, <emph>ye shall meet again.</emph> Yes, there is a land where we shall all at last meet, never more to be parted. What would this life profit, were there no other? I would not care to love aught that was earthly, if at death that love were to cease. No! a few more years we shall be separated, she in her heavenly home, and <emph>we</emph> still inhabiting our earthly one, in chrysalis, as it were, while she has unfolded from the tenement of clay, in celestial regions.</p>
               <p>As soon as circumstances will permit, I shall return and bring with me my motherless little ones, to crave your sympathy. But I know they will not appeal in vain. Gladly did you receive their mother to your hearts, who came to you a few years since a stranger, and I know her offspring will not be cast off by you. The parents of Kate would gladly keep them here, but I cannot part with them; they are too dear to me because they were <emph>hers,</emph> to allow me to do so.</p>
               <p>The last hours of Kate were somewhat peculiar. The night before she died she had a dream, which she related to me in the morning, and which struck me<pb n="324-325" xml:id="VAC6293-00000163"/> unpleasantly when she repeated it. "I had," said she, "a beautiful dream last night. I thought I was wandering in a beautiful garden; there were in it numerous paths, filled with visitors. Some of the walks were more attractive than others, the fruits were more abundant, and the flowers of a brighter hue. While occasionally you would perceive a path in which there was nothing that looked inviting; it seemed as though all the brambles were gathered in it. There were stationed at the entrance of each, guides to conduct those along who were to pass through them. It appeared to me that I was among the fortunate ones, who entered upon one of the flowery paths; everything around me was beautiful, and my walk would have been without a shadow, had it not been for the cries and complaints of those near me, who chanced to have been obliged to walk in one of the paths filled with briers.</p>
               <p>My walk to me seemed short, when my guide told me I had got nearly to the terminus of the garden, and soon I must go beyond its precincts, into new and untried scenes. I wished in my heart, though I dared not express it, that my walk could have been prolonged. I would hear occasionally a cry of anguish from some one travelling in the rough path, who had been torn by some of its thorns, and hear too a petition that they might soon arrive at the end of their journey, and find rest for their weary feet beyond its walls. I felt regret when my guide told me that soon I must bid adieu to some of those who had become very dear to me in my pilgrimage, for they had not yet finished their walk. But he told me of it so mildly, and my friends gathered round me so lovingly, to bid me farewell, that I became resigned. My only anxiety was for two little beings who had from the moment they drew breath clung to me for protection. But I felt that they had entered a flowery path, and trusted they would not diverge from it, for they had kind friends in the garden, and the great Master who had charge of it, <emph>loved little children.</emph>"</p>
               <p>The next day Kate left us. She had indeed nearly finished her walk, and arrived at the gate of another existence. Farewell my loved parents, and sister, some time must unavoidably elapse before I can again be with you. Italy has now no charms for me, and I long to be once more <emph>at home.</emph>
               </p>
               <p>There was not a dry eye in the room when Dora finished her brother's letter. Mrs. Grafton was the first to break the silence.</p>
               <pb n="326-327" xml:id="VAC6293-00000164"/>
               <p>"Can it be," said she, "that the gay gladsome voice of Kate is hushed forever? those eyes that never looked aught else than love, closed in death. Will her light elastic step never more gladden us with her presence? No, never more shall we behold her on earth; the places that once knew her, shall know her no more. My dear children, for such you all seem to me, let this death remind you of your own frailty; we are as the grass of the field, which to-day is, and to-morrow is cast into the oven. There is nothing in the thought of death to sadden one, if they view it aright. Remember my dear girls to live always, so that if you be called away to-morrow, you may be prepared for the transition."</p>
               <p>Hermione spoke not a word; but Lizzie in her sweet tones said,</p>
               <p>"Friends, thou hast our sincere sympathy in this thy affliction, but the Lord chasteneth those whom he loveth."</p>
               <p>"Sympathy from friends is always sweet," said Mrs. Grafton, "especially when the heart is tried."</p>
               <p>"Poor Fred," said Dora, "how lonely he must be. I wish he was at home with us. Kate was dearer to him than all the world beside. It seems to me as though I can see her now as she looked the first time I ever saw her, the night they arrived from Italy. Her bright eyes kindling with pleasure when she greeted us. She was as dear to me as a sister."</p>
               <p>"Let us not repine," said Mrs. Grafton, "that she is no more. I doubt not that it is well with her; her earth-life has been so free from stains, that she has probably attained a high state of existence, in another."</p>

               <p>THE gladsome month of June had now arrived. Fred with the children was expected home the last of the month. Mr. Malcolm had become so much attached to Alice, that he had given up the idea of going abroad and resumed his business in the city. He had met she who was Adelaide Warren, several times at the house of Doctor Abbott, and in the street, and was rather pleased with her appearance, some even went so far as to say that he was partial to her; but Dora had never mentioned the subject to him, and therefore was ignorant of the truth of the statement. As she had a promise from Mr. Malcolm, that he would never take Alice from her, she felt that she had no right to interfere at all in the matter.</p>
               <p>It may be remembered by our readers, that when little Willie Arnold, with his mother and sister visited Dora, Willie exacted a promise from Doctor Abbott to bring Dora to see them, in their country home, and he would show to her, flowers, almost as pretty as those she used to bring him, to set beside his bed, when he was confined by sickness.</p>
               <p>Willie did not forget this, and persuaded his mother to write an invitation to them to come. His garden was now in fine order, and he had bestowed upon it extra pains, in order to have his flowers as numerous and beautiful that season as possible.</p>
               <p>His mother, (now Mrs. Capen,) wrote that Willie was very anxious that Miss Dora, as he still persisted in calling her, should come to make them a visit. "If," said she, "you will partake of our frugal fare, it will give both myself and husband great pleasure to have you do so. We are now blessed with a competency, but we make no pretensions to display. My husband by his economy, has accumulated some little property, but that does not ead us into extravagances of living."</p>
               <pb n="330-331" xml:id="VAC6293-00000166"/>
               <p>"How would you like to accept of the invitation and spend a few days with them Dora?" said Doctor Abbott. "I think I could leave town just now for a short time very well."</p>
               <p>"If you can accompany us, I should be delighted to do so," said Dora, "and I think the change of air would be beneficial for the children. Willie would be so disappointed too, if we should decline visiting them."</p>
               <p>"When will it be most convenient for you to leave?" said Doctor Abbott.</p>
               <p>"It makes no difference to me, I can go any time,' said Dora.</p>
               <p>"Supposing we start the first of next week then, if nothing happens to prevent," replied Doctor Abbott.</p>
               <p>"Any time that it suits your convenience," replied Dora, "I shall be ready."</p>
               <p>"I will then drop a line to Mrs. Capen to-day," said Doctor Abbott, "Telling her that we thank her for her invitation, and shall, if nothing prevents, be happy to visit her the first of next week."</p>
               <p>It was then Friday, and the next Tuesday Doctor Abbott set out with his family, for the pretty village of R——. Their journey occupied a few hours, and the route was very pleasant. It was a beautiful season of the year to be travelling through the country, every thing looked so green, and as the season was very flourishing vegetation was remarkably forward.</p>
               <p>When they arrived in R——, Doctor Abbott inquired at the depot for a carriage to take them to the house of Mr. Capen. They were delighted with the appearance of the village as they rode along. Every thing about it looked so neat, and the pretty white cottages and green blinds, with their grass plats or gardens in front, bespoke the industry and thrift of their occupants.</p>
               <p>At the gate of one of the prettiest of these, the carriage suddenly stopped, and the driver informed them that this was the residence of Mr. Capen. They were soon assured of this by the appearance of Willie and his sister coming to the door, followed by Mrs. Capen, all neatly attired for the afternoon. They were cordially received by Mrs. Capen and the children, and were soon seated in the pleasant and cool parlor, where the scent of the fragrant roses and other flowers was wafted in, by every breeze, from Willie's garden.</p>
               <pb n="332-333" xml:id="VAC6293-00000167"/>
               <p>Mrs. Capen brought to them cool water, right from the well, and then asked to be excused while she went to prepare an early tea, to refresh them after their journey.</p>
               <p>Alice soon made herself perfectly familiar with Willie and his sister Minnie, and they were anxious to amuse her. The baby had fallen asleep and been placed in a cradle, formerly belonging to Minnie. Doctor Abbott and Dora were enjoying the fine country air and admiring the little marks of industry about the room, showing that although Mrs. Capen performed her household duties without the aid of a servant, she still found some leisure to devote to ornamental work.</p>
               <p>"After tea, when you are rested, Miss Dora, I want you to go out in my garden," said Willie.</p>
               <p>"I shall be happy to do so," replied Dora.</p>
               <p>At this time Mrs. Capen entered the room, and addressing Doctor Abbott, said "my husband's place of business is only a short distance from here; if you would like to, Willie will walk over with you. Mr. Capen would be happy to go with you over his rooms."</p>
               <p>"I should be glad to do so," he replied, and taking ing his hat looked round for Willie, who soon came running in, hat in hand, ready for the walk.</p>
               <p>"Tell your father," said Mrs. Capen to Willie, "that tea will be ready in about half an hour."</p>
               <p>The half hour soon passed, and as Dora stood at the window she saw her husband and Willie coming towards the house, with a well-dressed, fine-looking man, who she supposed must be Mr. Capen, with them.</p>
               <p>As they entered, Doctor Abbott introduced him to Dora as Mr. Capen; he had a fine open countenance and a broad intellectual forehead. Soon after they came in, Mrs. Capen announced tea to be ready. The table was covered with a snowy cloth, while upon it were biscuit of her own making, light and warm from the oven; butter as yellow as gold, from her own dairy, and preserves made of fruits raised in thei own orchard; and pastry that a professed cook would have been proud to have made.</p>
               <p>Doctor Abbott told Mrs. Capen that he never tasted a more luscious meal, or at least one that suited him better, at any first-class hotel that he ever visited.</p>
               <p>"You have a very pleasant situation here, I should think," said Doctor Abbott to Mrs. Capen.</p>
               <pb n="334-335" xml:id="VAC6293-00000168"/>
               <p>"It is pleasant to me," she replied, "especially after having lived some time in hot and dusty streets in the city: we will go out after tea, and I will show you my flowers, or rather Willie's, and our ducks and chickens."</p>
               <p>"I have heard my wife and Willie so often speak of you, Mrs. Abbott," said Mr. Capen, addressing Dora, "that I felt almost acquainted with you before having the pleasure of seeing you."</p>
               <p>"I am glad they are not like many, who forget those whom they have once known as soon as they become separated by distance," replied Dora.</p>
               <p>"We owe to you too great a debt of gratitude for that," said Mrs. Capen. "If it had not been for the kindness of yourself and husband, instead of the peace and plenty we now enjoy, we must unavoidably have suffered from want. I sometimes tremble to think what must have been our fate had not kind friends been raised to us."</p>
               <p>"If we were instrumental in doing you good," said Dora, "I am very thankful; 'tis as sweet to confer a favor as to receive one."</p>
               <p>"Not to all at this day," said Mr. Capen; "there is too much selfishness in the world." "But," said he, "you did not know the benefit you was to another, in assisting Mrs. Capen to return to her native place. I consider myself considerably indebted to you for being the indirect cause of finding my wife."</p>
               <p>"If you are satisfied with your part of the bargain, we are with ours," said Doctor Abbott."</p>
               <p>"I have had no reason to complain as yet," said Mr. Capen, smiling.</p>
               <p>Soon after tea was over they went out to see the place. The first spot they visited was Willie's garden—it was really pretty, and received due praise from both Doctor Abbott and Dora. Alice was delighted with the broods of ducks and chickens, and wished very much to carry one of the smallest home with her.</p>
               <p>The evening passed pleasantly away, and when the hour came to retire, Mrs. Capen showed them the chamber they were to occupy. Everything about the room was in perfect order. But what most attracted Dora was a beautiful bunch of flowers upon a stand. "Those flowers," said Mrs. Capen, "Willie picked from his garden and wished to have them placed here."</p>
               <p>"He was very thoughtfu I am sure," said Dora.</p>
               <pb n="336-337" xml:id="VAC6293-00000169"/>
               <p>After Mrs. Capen had gone out, Doctor Abbott remarked, "It is pleasant to do good always, but especially when we see such good results from it as we witness in the present instance."</p>
               <p>They remained two nights under the hospitable roof of the Capens, and then with many invitations to visit them again, set out for home.</p>
               <p>"I do not know that I ever enjoyed a visit more in my life," said Doctor Abbott. "Mr. Capen is an intelligent and honest-minded man, and that is the noblest work of God."</p>
               <p>"And I," said Dora, as she placed in a vase a bunch of flowers Willie had given to her as she was preparing to leave them, "am delighted with our visit to R——."</p>

               <p>FRED arrived the last of the month, and brought with him the nurse, and his two little motherless children. He was much overcome when he met his parents and Dora again.</p>
               <p>After his return, he spent many of his evenings with Dora. He had appeared very melancholy, and Dora had used every art in her power to draw his mind away from meditating so much upon his troubles. One evening, finding her efforts unavailing, she went towards him, and drawing a chair close by his side, said, as she threw her arm around him as she had been used to do: "My dear brother, sincerely do I sympathize with you in your affliction; and well do<pb n="338-339" xml:id="VAC6293-00000170"/> I realize the loss you have met with. But is it not wrong for you to yield so entirely to your sorrow? It appears to me that if Kate were permitted to speak with you at this time, she would disapprove of your not endeavoring to dwell less with such gloomy thoughts upon her death. Strive my dear brother to look beyond the grave for consolation. Think of her as indeed she is, a bright immortal. And by your life prepare to meet her above. By giving way so entirely to grief, you unfit yourself for the duties of life. You must remember that your mission is a noble one. Strive to become again interested in your painting. You are conferring upon the memory of Kate no honor by making yourself so utterly miserable. You know how dear to her was your success in your art; embalm her memory then not in fruitless tears, but by your wish to fulfil her anticipations, give to the world the benefit of your genius. You have children too, my brother, looking up to you for instruction and guidance, make them your study. You know how dear to her would have been the privilege of moulding their young minds; as much as it is in your power, you must supply her loss to them."</p>
               <p>"I thank you, my sister, for your timely advice. It may be that I am wronging the living and the dead, by yielding so entirely to sorrow. I will as far as it is in my power, interest myself in those things which will benefit myself and children. It may be that <emph>she</emph> will shed a benign influence around me, to encourage me when I am faint-hearted. I know when Kate was with me, if I accomplished any work of art that drew admiration from the world, it gave to her as much and more delight than it did me. Yes, for your sake, said he, dear Kate, (clasping his hands and looking towards heaven), will I exert my utmost energy to win a deathless name among men. Methinks even now, sweet wife, I can distinctly discern thy face looking down upon me in love and encouragement; pleading with me to perform faithfully my mission on earth, and then when I have completed my work here, be prepared to meet thee above."</p>
               <p>When Fred had spoken these words there was a calm and holy expression upon his countenance, that partook not of earth, but was an emanation from the world of light. Dora saw that he was wrapped in inward prayer, and that he was striving to overcome <emph>self,</emph> and thought best not to disturb him at that moment.</p>

               <p>Presently, turning to Dora he said, "why is it Dora that <emph>you</emph> are possessed of so much hope in this life, and beyond the grave? You can always see a bright side to the darkest picture, and point out to those whose vision is more obscured, the <emph>silver lining of every cloud.</emph>"</p>
               <p>"If I am more blessed with the ability than some, it is in part owing to my organization, but still more, I think, to my home culture, and early education. To my mother, Fred, whose society and confidence were ever mine. It was <emph>she</emph> who early taught me in the school of benevolence, and showed to me scenes of misery so utterly wretched, that when I was tempted to murmur at my own lot, she had but to remind me of the sorrows of some poor outcast, suffering in sorrow and alone, to make me perceive how wrong it was in me to complain, and think my portion hard to bear, when so many others, whose sufferings were known perhaps only to God, were enduring hardships to which mine were a mere trifle. Fred," said she, "we who have been blessed with such excellent parents, cannot be grateful enough for it, and it should make us charitable to those who never enjoyed the same blessing."</p>
               <p>"I have often thought of this myself," replied Fred, and trust that I am thankful."</p>
               <p>"There is one circumstance that I wish to speak with you about, Fred," said Dora, "and yet I feel some delicacy in so doing, as you have never mentioned the matter to me."</p>
               <p>"There should be perfect confidence between brothers and sisters," said Fred. "I am willing to listen to whatever you may have to say."</p>
               <p>"Did Kate ever speak to you concerning your marrying again after her departure?" asked Dora.</p>
               <p>"She did," he replied.</p>
               <p>"Previous to her death," said Dora, "she wrote to me, and spoke at some length upon the subject. It seemed to be her wish that you should, after a suitable time, choose another to become your companion, and mother to your children."</p>
               <p>"She expressed this same desire to me," replied Fred, "a short time before her death."</p>
               <p>"When she wrote me," continued Dora, "she had never spoken to you about it, as the mention of anything connected with your separation was very painful to you. Did she ever allude in her conversation to any one in particular, who it would be her desire to fill her place to you and the children?"</p>
               <p>"She did," answered Fred.</p>
               <pb n="342-343" xml:id="VAC6293-00000172"/>
               <p>"Did her choice meet with your approval?" inquired Dora.</p>
               <p>"Her choice fell upon one whom I consider worthy the approval of any one. But, Dora, <emph>I</emph> shall <emph>never</emph> marry again." This Fred said with much decision.</p>
               <p>"Did you inform Kate of this, before her death?" inquired Dora.</p>
               <p>"I did," he replied, "and gave her my reasons why I should not. I have a kind and judicious mother, to whom I can confide the care and management of my children, and who assumes the responsibility cheerfully. And for my own part, I have no wish ever to marry again. I should never expect to find another, who would so far come up to my ideal of what a woman should be, as Kate did. I could never forget <emph>her</emph> enough, to make one whom I might choose to fill her place happy. I should continually see and speak of things that Kate would have done differently, and thus cause unhappiness between us."</p>
               <p>"It may be that you are <unclear>right</unclear>. But you will lead a very lonely life," said Dora.</p>
               <p>"I do not think I need to," he replied, "with my children, and so many kind friends and relatives as I have."</p>
               <p>"She wrote to me, that she knew of no one in whose care she would rather entrust the little ones than Hermione, and whom she should prefer for your companion," said Dora to him.</p>
               <p>Fred with a smile, said, "Kate did not know that Hermione had once refused the offer of my hand, in marriage."</p>
               <p>"And neither did I," said Dora, with surprise. "Hermione never whispered such a thing to me. Pray explain yourself."</p>
               <p>"You remember, undoubtedly, our ride out of town, a few days before I sailed for Italy the first time," said Fred.</p>
               <p>"Certainly," replied Dora.</p>
               <p>"Well, I fancied then that I was dead in love with Hermione, and could not take my departure for a foreign land, until I had obtained from her a promise that on my return she would become mine," said Fred.</p>
               <p>"This is all news to me," said Dora.</p>
               <p>"This proves that some women can keep secrets." said Fred, "But to resume my story. In that beautiful arbor, which you all so much admired, in the garden attached to the mansion of old Mrs. Abbott, I confessed to her my love, and my wish to have it returned."</p>
               <pb n="344-345" xml:id="VAC6293-00000173"/>
               <p>"Did she refuse you?" said Dora.</p>
               <p>"She told me kindly, what I afterwards found to be true, replied Fred, "and that was, that I had mistaken <emph>strong friendship,</emph> for <emph>love.</emph> And that I should live to see the day, when I would thank her for her refusal of my hand. She spoke of her temperament being too cold for one like me, and of the cares that must of necessity, fall upon one who should choose her for a companion. But her last and greatest objection was, that she had <emph>loved once,</emph> and could <emph>never</emph> love again."</p>
               <p>"This accounts," said Dora, "for her unwillingness for me, before your marriage, to joke her about you," and, said she, "this conversation has banished from my mind, all thoughts of using my influence, as Kate requested me to do, in your uniting yourself to Hermione."</p>

               <p>FIVE years rolled on in their rapid flight, but added few traces of care to the calm brow of Dora. Her life might well be compared to a smooth lake, which seemed not to be disturbed by the ripples of time.</p>
               <p>Alice was now ten years old, and little Effie, the joy and pride of the hearts of Doctor Abbott and Dora, was now nearly six.</p>
               <p>It was in the month of January, a cold blustering evening, that Doctor Abbott, not having any professional calls out, was glad to have an opportunity of spending an evening at home with his family.</p>
               <pb n="346-347" xml:id="VAC6293-00000174"/>
               <p>The little sitting-room, had, to be sure, undergone some changes of furniture, but was not much altered, in its general appearance, from what it was, when Dora occupied it for the first time ten years before.</p>
               <p>Let us, gentle reader, for a moment glance at the occupants of the room.</p>
               <p>There, in his comfortable arm-chair, sits Doctor Abbott, turning over the leaves of a picture book for the amusement of little Effie, who sits smiling upon his knee, and who is allowed to sit up beyond her usual bed-hour, to enjoy the society of her father.</p>
               <p>Doctor Abbott has been a faithful student and physician and had been much exposed to the heat and cold to attend his patients. Time has therefore laid a heavier hand upon him, than upon Dora. But it has not taken from, but rather added to, the manliness of beauty belonging to his countenance. Little Fred and Kate Grafton (the children of Fred) had grown to be playmates for Alice and Effie, and were now on a visit to them. Dora was seated at the piano, playing the accompaniment to some juvenile air, while the sweet voices of the children were blending together in harmony. Little Kate who was the image of her mother, joined her sweet voice with the others. When the children had sat up as late as Mrs Abbott thought best for them to, they gave their goodnight kisses and retired. Dora went with them to their chambers, and saw them safely in bed, and heard the younger ones repeat their little hymns, and then returned to the sitting-room to join her husband again.</p>
               <p>Doctor Abbott looked up from the book he was perusing as she entered, and said,</p>
               <p>"Do you know that soon your birth-day will come round again, Dora. Let us see, it is the last of the month, I believe, and the largest half has already gone."</p>
               <p>"Yes," replied Dora, "and only think I shall be thirty-two. Just sixteen years ago this month I was preparing for my party, to celebrate my sweet sixteenth birth night. Some changes have taken place since then. Some of which are joyous to look back upon, while others are tinctured with sadness. Yet my dear husband" said she, "I think few can look back upon life, with less sorrow than I. In that time I have become acquainted with you, and your love and society have added a new charm to existence. A little<pb n="348-349" xml:id="VAC6293-00000175"/> one of my own has been given to me; and one for whom I feel a mother's love, has been entrusted to my care.</p>
               <p>True, some of my near and dear companions have been called from earth, and I have stood by the couch of death, and witnessed their departure. But our family circle, with the exception of the loss of Kate, remains unbroken. I do not know but what life presents as many attractions to me, as it did when I was <emph>just sixteen.</emph>"</p>
               <p>"Time has dealt kindly with you Dora, one would scarcely imagine you to be thirty-two. The years have flown with astonishing rapidity, since first you came to gladden my home with your presence. You have been a sharer in my joys, and a hearty sympathizer in anything that has occurred to trouble me."</p>
               <p>"I think the circumstances that sent Alice to us, though sad in themselves, have added much to our happiness. Alice is so kind and affectionate towards Effie, and so obedient a child, that I feel as though I could not have got along without her," said Dora.</p>
               <p>"Alice <emph>is,</emph> I think, a treasure to us, and of great benefit to Effie; as she is older and so well behaved, that she sets an excellent example for Effie to follow.</p>
               <p>But, my dear wife, I think she is greatly indebted to you for what she is; for you have spared no pains in her instruction in the ways of right."</p>
               <p>"If I have been faithful to the trust imposed in me by her mother, I am indeed thankful. But Alice has never been the trial to manage that some children are. A word is enough for her, and she merely needs to be led with a hand of love, her nature is so yielding and affectionate," said Dora.</p>
               <p>"The law of love is very potent," replied Doctor Abbott. Even though Alice does naturally possess an affectionate disposition, if her character had been formed under harsh treatment, she might have grown up to be stubborn and unlovely in her ways. I wonder if Mr. Malcolm and Adelaide would like to have her with them? Let's see, how long have they been married; two years this spring, is it not?"</p>
               <p>"Three, I believe," replied Dora.</p>
               <p>"Is it possible?" said Doctor Abbott.</p>
               <p>"Yes, and I rather think they lead a very pleasant life," replied Dora. "I called upon Adelaide last week. She is really a fine appearing woman now."</p>
               <p>"Both Adelaide and Mr. Malcolm have, by experience dearly bought, been much benefited in their<pb n="350-351" xml:id="VAC6293-00000176"/> characters," said Doctor Abbott. "They both have, probably, bitter reflections on the past. But if they have repented of their ways, it is not our duty to slight them for past faults. That was not the doctrine of our Savior. He came, he said, to bring <emph>sinners,</emph> not the righteous, to repentance. His words were, 'Thy sins are forgiven thee, go, and sin no more.' He would have us lend an encouraging and helping hand to those whose steps may have once slid from the path of rectitude, but who are anxious to gain the right way."</p>
               <p>"If all the world were as charitable to the faults of others as you, my dear husband, there would be less injustice done in judging our neighbor, than there is now."</p>
               <p>"We all have need of charity being shown us, and therefore should be willing to grant it to our neighbors. But Dora, I am thinking, that I would like to have your thirty-second birth-night celebrated by giving a party to our friends. What if the rose on your cheek is not quite so bright as it was at <emph>sweet sixteen.</emph>
               </p>
               <lg type="quotation">
                  <l>"For at each glance of those sweet eyes, <emph>a soul</emph>
                  </l>
                  <l>Looks forth as from the azure gates of heaven."</l>
               </lg>
               <p>"You are inclined to flatter to night," replied Dora. But as to the party, it would give me great pleasure to entertain my friends, on my birth-night. Some will be present who were once strangers to me. But <emph>one</emph> will be absent who was dear to me in my younger days. Alice Menton joins us not now, in our earthly festivals. Yet there are many of those companions who were dear to me in girlhood, who are still among us. Time seems to have made as little change in Hermione as any of them. Her face wears its same calm expression, which neither poverty nor riches change."</p>
               <p>"It must be that she is very wealthy now," said Doctor Abbott, "for I understand that her uncle, in his will, made her his principle heir."</p>
               <p>"I expect she is," replied Dora, "but one would never know by her manner, whether she were rich or poor. In their days of adversity, some called her more haughty than become one in her circumstances; but when prosperity again shone upon them, it changed not her bearing. Some call her cold and distant, but she never seemed so to me. There is, I know, a 'world of thought,' in her calm dark eye. But she is never deaf to the call of the distressed."</p>
               <p>"Hermione is rather a peculiar person, and there are few, I think, by whom she is rightly understood,"<pb n="352-353" xml:id="VAC6293-00000177"/> replied Doctor Abbott. "I consider her a person of unusual deep feelings," said he, "but she never makes any pretensions to emotion. This makes her formal and distant."</p>
               <p>"I think it is so myself," replied Dora.</p>
               <p>"It is growing late," said Doctor Abbott, "and nearly time to retire. I suppose we may calculate to make preparations for our anticipated party, right away."</p>
               <p>"There will not be any too much time, if we intend to have it on my birth-night," replied Dora.</p>
               <p>"We intend to have it on no other," replied Doctor Abbott.</p>

               <p>THE night appointed for the party arrived. The handsomely furnished parlors of Doctor Abbott were thrown open, to receive their guests. Though the form and step of Dora, were less elastic than they were on a similar occasion, sixteen years before, yet she had not lost any of her beauty as a matron, that she had possessed as a maiden.</p>
               <p>Among the guests assembled were Henry Adams and Lizzie, whose cheerful faces told that life was passing smoothly with them. Mr. Menton was there, with his sad and thoughtful brow, that had made him prematurely old. And Mr. Malcolm, with Adelaide by his side, looked better pleased with himself and life, than he did when Dora saw him for the first time.<pb n="354-355" xml:id="VAC6293-00000178"/> Adelaide had lost some of her girlish beauty, but was much improved in appearance. Hermione moved round with the same dignity that she did years before, while Hattie had lost none of her sprightliness.</p>
               <p>Fred endeavored to appear cheerful, but it was evident it was a great exertion for him to do so. It reminded him so much of his loneliness, and of Kate, and his mind dwelt so much upon the past that he could not enjoy the present.</p>
               <p>"Let me congratulate you, Mrs. Abbott," said Henry Adams, "on your birth-night. This occasion reminds me of a similar one several years ago, when you were Dora Grafton."</p>
               <p>"Yes," replied Dora, "and it reminds me, too, of a conversation I had with you that eve, when you described to me your cousin Alice, whom you expected would soon come to make it her home with your mother."</p>
               <p>"Did I speak in too high terms of her excellence?" he inquired.</p>
               <p>"I found her all, and more than you described her to be," she replied. She was one whom <q>
                     <lg type="quotation">
                        <l>"None knew her but to love her,</l>
                        <l>None named her but to praise."</l>
                     </lg>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>"She was as dear to me as a sister," said Henry."</p>
               <p>"Thee has great cause to be thankful for the numberless blessings that have been granted thee, in this life," said Lizzie, addressing Dora. "Few pass through less trials than have fallen to thee, in the same space of time."</p>
               <p>"I am fully sensible of the many privileges I have enjoyed in life," said Dora, "and sometimes fear that I do not appreciate them as I ought. If the future is to be as joyous as the past, I shall have no reason to complain."</p>
               <p>They were now joined by Hermione and Hattie, and a Mr. Stanley, a young man to whom Hattie was engaged.</p>
               <p>"I hope we do not intrude upon your conversation," said Mr. Stanley.</p>
               <p>"O, no!" they all replied.</p>
               <p>"We have come to offer, among the rest, our congratulations," said Hermione, "and to hope that the years that await you may be as bright as those that have passed."</p>
               <p>"I wonder," said Hattie, who was a regular tease, "if Hermione would be willing to celebrate her birth-night in this way?"</p>
               <pb n="356-357" xml:id="VAC6293-00000179"/>
               <p>"Why should I not?" asked Hermione, calmly.</p>
               <p>"Because there might be such a thing as some one's inquiring your age," rejoined Hattie.</p>
               <p>"And which I should have no objections to answering," replied Hermione.</p>
               <p>"Well, now, really, I thought ladies of a certain age were extremely delicate about others knowing the exact number of years that had passed over their heads. But I find you are an exception to the general rule."</p>
               <p>"Tell me why I should be so sensitive about the matter," said Hermione.</p>
               <p>"Because, my dear sister, your guests would know you had passed the first and second notch, and were still enjoying single blessedness."</p>
               <p>"That is nothing for which I should feel ashamed," quietly replied Hermione.</p>
               <p>"Perhaps thy sister is one who remains single for <emph>choice,</emph> not from <emph>necessity,</emph>" said Lizzie.</p>
               <p>"It may be so," replied Hattie. "But where is Effie, Mrs. Abbott? I want to give her a kiss."</p>
               <p>Dora pointed towards her at another part of the room, and Mr. Stanley and Hattie soon turned from the group to join Effie.</p>
               <p>"Thy sister always seems in fine spirits," said Lizzie to Hermione.</p>
               <p>"She does," replied Hermione, "and I hope that the hand of sorrow may never check the exuberance of her spirits. It is refreshing to see one so happy as she occasionally."</p>
               <p>The time to partake of supper now arrived, and all were called to the dining-room. Here the conversation became general, and all seemed inclined to be social. As indeed it generally is at parties, contrary to the old rule for children, that food will keep the tongue still. For it matters not how dull and silent a company may have been, when they are gathered round the refreshment table the reserve gradually wears off, and all seem inclined to be merry.</p>
               <p>"I think, Doctor Abbott," said Mr. Stanley, "that it is decidedly wrong for <emph>you</emph> to place before us viands so tempting to the appetite, when your knowledge of human frame teaches you, that simple food eaten at regular hours is more conducive to health."</p>
               <p>Mr. Stanley was as fond of a joke as Hattie.</p>
               <p>"This is a hard thing to get over, how shall I vindicate myself?" said Doctor Abbott. "Ah! I have it," said he. "Mr. Stanley, I had nothing to do<pb n="358-359" xml:id="VAC6293-00000180"/> with the getting up of this supper. The whole care and management fell upon my wife. I merely pay the bills."</p>
               <p>"A lucky escape for you," said Dora, playfully, "but if you should chance to fall sick after partaking of it, we should be inclined to say, "Physician, heal thyself."</p>
               <p>"I really think," said Doctor Abbott, soberly, "that the style of living and the food that we accustom ourselves to partake of, are highly injurious to health. If I had consulted the laws of health alone in ordering a supper for this eve, I should have chosen a much more simple bill of fare."</p>
               <p>"Shall I help you to a piece of tongue?" said Mr. Menton to Hattie.</p>
               <p>"If you have any mercy upon the ears of those present, Mr. Menton, pray do not be guilty of such a thing," said Mr. Stanley.</p>
               <p>"Do you mean to insinuate by your remarks, that my <emph>own</emph> tongue is an unruly member?" asked Hattie.</p>
               <p>"I do not <emph>always</emph> feel obliged to explain myself, if the person whom I address is incapable of divining the meaning of my words," said Mr. Stanley.</p>
               <p>"Your impudence is beyond endurance, said Hattie tie. But I attribute it in part from your having eaten rather freely of that cranberry sauce that stands near you, which has made you <emph>both tart</emph> and <emph>saucy.</emph>"</p>
               <p>"You are too severe," said Mr. Stanley, "but who ever attempted with any success, to get the better of a <emph>woman's tongue?</emph>"</p>
               <p>"You seem <emph>both</emph> to be striving to see which can 'hit the hardest,' as the old saying is," said Doctor Abbott, "and now I think it is time for me to interfere with my 'healing art.' Let me give to both of you some advice, and then you can follow my prescriptions or not as you choose. I shall deal with you in true homoeopathic style, and give you only a small portion, but pretty powerful. Never allow your <emph>tongues</emph> to separate your friendship, or <emph>saucy</emph> words to cause bitter feelings."</p>
               <p>"Thanks to you for your timely advice, Doctor. Your pill is sugar-coated, and we can swallow it easily," said Mr. Stanley.</p>
               <p>"I trust I may be never be called to administer to you a more bitter portion. So here's health and happiness to Mr. Stanley and Hattie," said Doctor Abbott, as he touched his glass of <emph>cold water,</emph> with that of Mr. Stanley's.</p>

               <p>HEMONIONE went home from the party and retired to her chamber, but did not immediately seek her pillow. The pale beams of the moon left their shadow upon the floor, and sitting down by the window, she looked out upon the surrounding prospect. The house which their uncle had purchased for them was beautifully located. It fronted upon a magnificent sort of park. It was, as we have before stated, the month of January, and the weather exceeding cold. But a warm fire had been kept in the chamber, so that Hermione could sit perfectly comfortable within, while she admired the grand, though somewhat cheerless prospect, without.</p>
               <p>There had been a light fall of snow and rain, which had congealed by the coldness of the atmosphere, and now hung in glistening pendants from the trees in the park. The moon shone upon them in full splendor, and as they dazzled in its rays, one might almost imagine themselves in fairy land, or in some grotto where the walls were hung with sparkling jewels. The earth had upon it a thin covering of snow, and here and there the ground was entirely bare. In the centre of the park was a beautiful figure hewn out of solid marble. Hermione's window was directly opposite to it. As the moon shone upon the figure, it would give to the features a pleasant cast; but when its light was obscured by some passing cloud, for an instant the face would look dark and gloomy.</p>
               <p>That figure, thought Hermione, reminds me more of myself and life, than anything I know of. That statue might as well hold my heart, as my own tenement of clay; for the world could as well read the varied emotions going on within, by those cold features of marble, as they could by my own, I have so schooled them into calmness, however violent may be the turmoil within.</p>
               <p>Whether the world smile or frown, whether prosperity<pb n="362-363" xml:id="VAC6293-00000182"/> perity shine upon me, or adversity become my portion; never shall words of <emph>mine</emph> reveal to others my joys or sorrows. I believe "my heart is turned to stone; I strike it, and it hurts my hand."</p>
               <p>But <emph>thou,</emph> kind moon, said she almost audibly, art very dear to me in my loneliness of heart; for <emph>thou</emph> too seemst an emblem of myself, sad, but yet prefer to suffer on alone, and never speak thy sadness to the cold unfeeling world.</p>
               <p>I know I am considered cold and distant by many, indeed there are but very few who understand me aright. They judge my heart by my face, and think it is always calm there; but alas, how far they are from being correct.</p>
               <p>My life, to look back upon, gives but very few scenes of true enjoyment. Early did I drink from the cup of adversity, and learn by sad experience the coldness and heartlesness of the world in which we live. Is it strange that it should cast its reflection back upon me. Ere my heart had become stony, it learnt to love another, and believed <emph>that love</emph> to be returned; but on awaking from the transient dream of happiness into which it had fallen, it found that earthly joys can be but little depended upon, and taught me that must learn to look within my own heart for support and sympathy.</p>
               <p>Why is it, that mortals inhabiting the same sphere are so differently constituted and circumstanced? Some would never have been able to bear up under the trials I have had to endure. They could not have wornr the outward semblance of happiness, when the hearts were crushed and bleeding. What would Dora have been had she filled my situation in life. She has passed through childhood, girlhood, and is now in the bloom of womanhood, and yet no lasting sorrow has ever fallen to her lot. Her childhood was blest beyond that of most of us. Few are blessed with such parents as Mr. and Mrs. Grafton. Riches have always been her portion through life. And now she is united to one who is well calculated to make her married life pass pleasantly.</p>
               <p>How different must her feelings be from mine, when she reviews the various scenes and incidents of her past years. It may be that I do wrong to indulge in such gloomy thoughts, but I am so weary of acting a part, in which I have no heart, that I sometimes feel as though I could lay aside the mask, and act once more my true nature. But no, I have so faithfully<pb n="364-365" xml:id="VAC6293-00000183"/> performed the deceit for many years, rather than the world should know how much I suffered, that I will still preserve it. What matters it if none ever give to me the credit of possessing a heart, and deem me destitute of emotions? it does not make me so."</p>
               <p>Hermione cast one more look upon the statue. It stood now in the full light of the queen of night, silent and motionless. She turned from the window, and closing the shutters, so as to shut out from her gaze the pale moon-beams, sought her couch for a little rest, so as to avoid the suspicions of her mother and sisters, that she had been up all night. She was very weary, and sleep soon visited her pillow. In her dreams, as she lay there, she saw her father at her bedside. He addressed her thus:—My daughter, you are weary to-night. Weary in body, and weary in mind. Thou hast indeed had more to sadden thee than many. But take courage, "be not weary in well doing." The world, taken as a whole, may not award to you the meed of praise you rightly deserve. But if your heart is right, be not dismayed, but trust in God. This world is not our only home, if it were, then indeed might you yield to dark despair. Still persevere. So far you have borne nobly up under the trials of life. Be not discouraged now. When Hermione awoke she felt much refreshed. Her mind reverted to her dream, and gave her fresh courage to carry with her in the walk of life. Who shall say that this was all a dream? It was a bright one to Hermione, at least. The poet hath sung, <q>
                     <lg type="quotation">
                        <l>"The departed, the departed, they visit us in dreams,</l>
                        <l>And they glide about our memories, like shadows over streams."</l>
                     </lg>
                  </q> Perhaps that father was permitted to hover near, and impress his child with those thoughts that would lead her to look beyond this world, where there is so much on every side to annoy and perplex, to that land of rest, prepared for the weary pilgrims of earth, after their sojourn here.</p>
               <p>When Hermione took her seat at the breakfast table, none would have imagined, to look upon her calm countenance, the conflict she had undergone in her mind the night before.</p>
               <p>"How did you enjoy yourselves at the party last eve?" inquired Mrs. Phelps of her daughters, as they sat at their morning meal.</p>
               <p>"O, we had a glorious time," said Hattie.</p>
               <p>"I passed quite a pleasant evening," said Hermione.</p>
               <pb n="366-367" xml:id="VAC6293-00000184"/>
               <p>"Why don't you never say as I do, Hermione, when we have been out together in company, that you have had a glorious time, or you never enjoyed yourself more, or give way to some burst of eloquence? Don't you never have an enjoyment that merits it?"</p>
               <p>"I am not much given, you know, to expressing my feelings," said Hermione, "and really I do not know that I could ever, truthfully, make such remarks."</p>
               <p>"You are a queer child," said Hattie; "you don't seem a bit like other folks."</p>
               <p>Hattie did not intend by her words to injure Hermione's feelings for they were devotedly attached to each other. And it was not often that Hermione ever displayed in her manner any signs of tender-heartedness; but her feelings had been so wrought upon the night before, that she had not perfect control of them now. She could scarcely keep back the tears as she asked, "Why don't I seem like other people?"</p>
               <p>"O, I only meant because you do not express your feelings as much as many, and one can not decide by your manner whether you have enjoyed yourself self or not. I did not intend to hurt your feelings, I am sure," said Hattie. "But you do not often mind my nonsense enough to take much notice of it, you know. I was sorry for what I said to you last night, about being an old maid. I know it was not right for me to speak so before company. Forgive me, dear sister, for my thoughtlessness."</p>
               <p>"What you said last night did not disturb me at all," said Hermione; "I am now thirty-four and deserve the title."</p>
               <p>"If I remain single till that time," said Hattie, "I shall not look so young and fresh as you, I know. My face, by that time, will be as dried up as a <emph>baked apple.</emph>"</p>
               <p>Hermione could not refrain from smiling at her sister's odd comparison. She replied, "I rather think if present appearances are true, you will never have an opportunity to really compare your face with a <emph>baked apple.</emph>"</p>
               <p>"There's many a slip 'twixt the cup and the lip," said Hattie. "I may have the privilege of dancing at your wedding a single lady yet."</p>
               <p>"I have not the least desire that you should," said Hermione. "If you or any one else think you<pb n="368-369" xml:id="VAC6293-00000185"/> should be happier married than single, it makes no difference to me. I have no wish myself to leave the sisterhood."</p>
               <p>"Mrs. Ahbott, or Dora, as it seems most natural to call her, looked beautifully last night," said Hattie. "I should hardly suppose her to be a married lady, and the mother of a child as old as Effie."</p>
               <p>"<emph>She</emph> will never grow old," said Hermione.</p>
               <p>"Was Mr. Malcolm and his wife present?" inquired Mrs. Phelps.</p>
               <p>"She was," replied Hermione. The more I see of Mr. Malcolm the better I like him; he wears well upon acquaintance. And Adelaide never appeared half so well as she does now. She has lost most of her frivolity and behaves with becoming propriety."</p>
               <p>"Henry and Lizzie appear as happy as 'two doves in a locum,'" said Hattie. "What a darling Lizzie is and always will be; so pretty and modest in her manners."</p>
               <p>"I suppose little Alice, as we call her, felt like quite a young lady," said Mrs. Phelps.</p>
               <p>"O, yes indeed," replied Hattie, "you would have been diverted, mother, to see how dignified and womanly she appeared. She hardly seems to know which to love best, Doctor Abbott or Mr. Malcolm; she is very fond of both, and they of her."</p>
               <p>"When I think of Mr. Malcolm, in the days of his first wife, and his treatment of Alice when an infant," said Mrs. Phelps, "I can scarcely tolerate his actions. But if, by his subsequent repentance and reform, he has been led to do better, I know it is our duty to forgive the past."</p>
               <p>"Alice, at least, was fortunate to be thrown into so good hands," said Hermione. "I believe Dora has been a kind and faithful parent to her. She had about her neck last night the picture of her own mother, which Dora once informed me, she deems almost a sacred thing."</p>
               <p>"I should suppose Mr. Malcolm would feel bad when he looks at Alice, and knows that he was once the cause of her being driven, a helpless little one, tfrom her home," said Hattie, "and would feel mortified about it."</p>
               <p>"There are not many, probably, who know the truth of the matter. I suppose most persons think her mother was laboring under a fit of insanity, when she carried the child from its home. Mr. Malcolm knows this. And, as to his own guilt in the matter,<pb n="370-371" xml:id="VAC6293-00000186"/> he is fully sensible of his past errors, and is endeavoring, by his present life and conduct, to atone for them," said Hermione.</p>
               <p>After breakfast was over, Hermione and Hattie took their work and books, and went into the parlor, which looked out upon the mall in which stood the marble statue. This reminded Hermione of her thoughts the night before. And if she had allowed herself to show some little emotion, at the breakfast table, she determined henceforth to appear to the world as impenetrable as the solid marble. Well might it be said of her, <q>

               <p>THE reader will remember Dora's visit to the Capens, some six years previous to the events recorded in our last chapter. Then Willie was a school-boy, of some twelve years. In the intervening time, he had finished his school days, and become apprenticed to his father-in-law, to learn the machinist's trade. From the time that necessity made him a little match-vender, wending his weary way through the crowded streets of the city, never caring for his own aching head and feet, if he could make sales<pb n="372-373" xml:id="VAC6293-00000187"/> enough through the day to carry a few pennies to his mother at night, to buy something to keep them from going hungry. He would willingly have dragged himself about in torture all the long hours of the day, for the happiness he would feel at night, when he sought his humble home, to see the tears upon his mother's face wiped away at sight of the little sum he had collected by his industry. From that time he had always displayed great energy in whatever he undertook, and was always ready to make sacrifices for the good of others.</p>
               <p>His father-in-law gave him the advantage of a good common education of which Willie made the best improvement. He was beloved and respected by his teachers and school-mates, and well advanced in his studies. After he left school, and became interested in his trade, he evinced equal interest in that; he possessed a good share of inventive genius, and was of great benefit to his father in his business.</p>
               <p>He grew up to be a tall fine-looking young fellow, and whenever he came to the city, always made it a point of calling at Doctor Abbott's, where he was sure of meeting a kind reception from them all.</p>
               <p>But two years had now elapsed, since they had seen him. For he had received a very lucrative offer to take the place of overseeing a stationary engine, for grinding sugar, upon an extensive plantation in Cuba. They would occasionally hear from, or see Mrs. Capen, and thus hear of the success Willie was making in his southern home. He wrote very encouraging letters to his mother, spoke in high terms of his employer, and often sent to her and his sister valuable presents. In one of his letters he said, "I should never have been where I am now, if it had not been for the kindness of our friends, Doctor Abbott and wife. I feel dear mother, that we owe to them a debt of gratitude, we shall never be able to repay. 'A friend in need is a friend indeed,' and such truly were they to us. Let my future success be ever so great, I shall feel that they were the first cause of my prosperity."</p>
               <p>Doctor Abbott came home one fine afternoon in autumn to take his family out for a pleasant ride to his mother's.</p>
               <p>They had owned the horses sometime, and always considered them perfectly gentle. They had never shown any signs of unmanageableness, and were admired for their beauty and good qualities.</p>
               <pb n="374-375" xml:id="VAC6293-00000188"/>
               <p>They were riding slowly along, and had only got about half a mile from their residence, when a newspaper blowing in the street frightened them, and they commenced running at full speed. Doctor Abbott used every endeavor to gain control of them, but to no purpose. They continued to run at a furious rate.</p>
               <p>They trembled for their own fate, and for the injury they might cause to others. Several persons did all in their power to check their speed, but in vain. On they dashed, carrying with them, as it appeared to the lookers on, the occupants of the carriage to certain injury or death.</p>
               <p>Suddenly as they were about to turn a corner to the imminent danger of those within, a young man from the sidewalk observing the peril they were in, regardless of the consequence to himself, almost leaped to the horses heads, and succeeded in preventing the carriage from overturning and throwing upon the pavement, the occupants. This was all done in a moment of time; others soon gathered to the spot, and assisted in calming the frightened horses, and assisting to alight, the trembling inmates of the carriage.</p>
               <p>When Dora regained the sidewalk, little Effie and Alice clinging to her in their fright, with her usual thoughtfulness she asked for their deliverer from the danger they were in and was pointed to some gentleman who were bearing into a house near by the insensible form of a well-dressed young man. Turning to Alice, with as calm a voice as she could command, she said, "Go, my dear, with Effie to your grand-mother, and make yourself comfortable till I return. Your father will be obliged to remain for the present and attend to the horses. I must go to the young man who so nobly risked his own life to rescue us from danger." Alice who had been much alarmed, turned to obey her mother, and persuade Effie to follow her, but the child seemed to hesitate, and be unwilling to go without her mother;, the fright had made her timid. "Is my Effie so selfish, as to be unwilling for her mother to go and see what she can do for the kind young man?"</p>
               <p>Dora knew that her words would have the required effect. "No, mamma," said the child, "kiss him for Effie, and tell him she's sorry if he is hurt."</p>
               <p>More than one eye in the crowd filled with tears at the child-like benevolence of little Effie.</p>
               <p>Dora spoke to her husband who left the horses to<pb n="376-377" xml:id="VAC6293-00000189"/> be carried home by one in the crowd with whom he was acquainted, and then went with her to the young man. He had been taken by the inmates of the house to a chamber, and kindly cared for. When Doctor Abbott and Dora entered the room, he was lying upon a couch, his face turned from them, while one or two were standing round him bathing his temples and performing other little acts of kindness and attention. Doctor Abbott said to a gentleman who was about leaving the room as they entered, "Do you know whether the young man is much injured or not?"</p>
               <p>"We feared at first that he was," replied the gentleman, "as he was taken up insensible, but with the exception of a few slight cuts and bruises, he does not seem to have suffered much injury. But it was a noble action; he risked his life in the attempt."</p>
               <p>As they went towards the young man he turned his head, and gave them a full view of his face. What was their surprise to see the features of their young friend Willie Arnold, as their deliverer.</p>
               <p>"Is it possible," exclaimed Doctor Abbott and Dora in the same breath.</p>
               <p>"I knew not, till this moment," said Willie, "who it was in the carriage."</p>
               <p>"We will not express to you our thanks for your great courage and kindness in rescuing us from danger, till we have first ascertained how much you are hurt."</p>
               <p>"Oh, I do not think I am at all injured," he replied. "Only a few scratches that will soon heal. I am very thankful if I have been instrumental in saving you from danger. I have always felt that I owed to you an immense debt of gratitude."</p>
               <p>"I am thankful that you escaped unharmed, but you must have run a great risk of losing your own life in endeavoring to save others," said Dora.</p>
               <p>"I did not think of that," he replied. "I merely had time to see the situation of the carriage, and determined if possible to avert the fate of destruction to those within, which seemed to threaten them."</p>
               <p>"How did you become thrown down?" said Doctor Abbott.</p>
               <p>"I had some difficulty to check the speed of the horses," said he, "but succeeded, when one of the horses gave a sudden spring which knocked me from my feet. It was fortunate for you that some one near had by this time taken hold of the bridle of the other<pb n="378-379" xml:id="VAC6293-00000190"/> horse, or they would probably set out again at a more furious rate than before. So you see you are not entirely indebted to me for your deliverance."</p>
               <p>"You must go home with us," said Doctor Abbott, "immediately, if you feel able. I will order a carriage for you at once."</p>
               <p>Willie assured him that he felt quite well, the fall had at first sort of stunned him; but he had almost entirely recovered from the effect of it now.</p>
               <p>"Before we start," said Dora, "I want to ask how you happened to be in the city. The last time I saw your mother she said you did not write anything about coming home at present."</p>
               <p>"I intended to take her by surprise," said he" and so have never written anything about coming home in my letters."</p>
               <p>"It will indeed be a surprise to her," said Dora, "almost as much as it was to us."</p>
               <p>"Do you like Cuba as well as ever?" inquired Doctor Abbott.</p>
               <p>"Yes, quite as well," he replied.</p>
               <p>The carriage was now announced, and they set out for home; they stopped at Mr. Grafton's and took in Effie and Alice. Effie did not remember the countenance tenance of Willie Arnold, but Alice recognized him at once, and was delighted to meet him.</p>
               <p>They were all glad enough when they were once more safe in their little sitting-room.</p>
               <p>"We had rather a different termination to our ride than we anticipated," said Doctor Abbott, as he took his accustomed seat.</p>
               <p>"We have great reason to be thankful that we are all safe and at home, after being exposed to so much danger," said Dora.</p>
               <p>"How little we realize, when we rise in the morning, the fate that may await us before we again seek our pillow," remarked Doctor Abbott.</p>
               <p>"We can never be grateful enough to you for your noble behavior," said Dora to Willie.</p>
               <p>"Mrs. Abbott," said Willie, and as he spoke his fine eyes glowed with animation, that lent an additional beauty to his face, "do you remember the time, years ago, when you were a young lady, and I a small lad, that while you passed along the crowded streets, clothed in rich attire, admired by all who beheld you, you noticed at your side a poor boy, thinly clad for the season, pale and emaciated in features. Every day the countenance of that boy seemed to haunt your<pb n="380-381" xml:id="VAC6293-00000191"/> steps. You heard that child of poverty, raising his weak and feeble voice to the passers by, endeavoring to persuade them to purchase enough to keep his mother and her little one from starving. Yes, lady, you listened to the tones of that poor boy, and his entreating look, and miserable attire, went to your kind heart. You felt that absolute poverty must be the cause of his efforts to gain a few coins. You risked your <emph>fashionable</emph> reputation, and, unheeding what the world might say, stopped and spoke an encouraging word to him, clad in the habiliments of poverty. Beneath those rags you knew there beat a heart, throbing with affection for his near kindred, with as deep and holy emotions as though covered with garments of a more beautiful texture. Yes, I say, you risked your <emph>fashionable</emph> reputation, and spoke in the crowded streets an encouraging word to that poor boy, which lent to his life the first bright ray. Since that time your words have been as a guiding star in my onward progress. Whatever I <emph>am,</emph> or ever may <emph>be,</emph> I owe it all to you. If my life has been risked to save yours, and those who are as dear as life to you, I thank God that I was able to render you such a service, for the sacrifice of self that you made. For, my dear lady, if more would follow your noble example, how great would be the amount of good they would do.</p>
               <p>There lies in every bosom fountains of love and ambition, but woe to the child of poverty. Circumstances are unfavorable to the development of his character; he is trampled under the feet of the rich, as a poor, forlorn outcast, good for nothing but to beg; and it will be fortunate if he is not tempted to steal. If he yields, they say, 'Poor boy the gallows will, I fear, yet bring him up.' Shame on such a state of society. It is a disgrace to the human heart that 'tis so bound up in dollars and cents that they can find nothing to admire in one who has none of them to boast of. How few, I say, stand ready to give an encouraging word, or lend a helping hand to bring from the obscurity poverty may have enveloped it in, humble worth, or some hidden talent. You, my dear lady, stand out as one, whose name should be immortalized among those who have nobly <emph>dared</emph> to do right. Excuse me if I have displayed more feeling than you may deem the case requires; but the subject is dear to my heart, which is overflowing to my early benefactors.</p>
               <pb n="382-383" xml:id="VAC6293-00000192"/>
               <p>To you, Mrs. Abbott, I am indebted for kindness and encouragement in my dark hours, and to you, sir, (addressing Doctor Abbott,) for being the instrument in God's hands of raising me from a bed of sickness and pain. Since that time I have been blessed with many privileges and advantages, which I trust I have appreciated and improved to the best of my ability. For the past I am grateful, and if the future is granted me, I will endeavor, by every effort of mine, to make my life such as shall be of benefit to myself and the world."</p>
               <p>Doctor Abbott grasped the young man warmly by the hand, while he exhorted him to go on in the good work he had begun; but never to let the love of fame lure him from virtue's path.</p>
               <p>Dora, who had been much affected by the young man's words, now came forward, and speaking to Willie, with the kindness of a mother, said, "Many of our most illustrious men have, like you, once been poor boys. When I for the first time gazed into the clear depths of your eyes, I felt that there was within you, more than the world knew of. Then I feared you had been neglected too long, and that you would in another world receive the praise and reward you rightly merited in this, but had never received.</p>
               <p>If words of mine, or any little acts of kindness, have cheered you on your way, I am thankful. So far through life you have done nobly; may you be strengthened to perform as faithfully the part assigned you in the future. If, at times, all things look dark to you, 'if fortune frowns, and friends grow few,' never yield to dark despair. Still hope on. Strive ever to see a 'silver lining to every cloud.'"</p>
               <p>That day was another epoch in the life of Willie Arnold, and was never forgotten by him. It encouraged him in his hours of prosperity. And if the world at times looked dark to him, it caused him to still persevere, feeling assured that in time all would again look bright as before.</p>

               <p>TIME rolled on, and each year brought some changes to all. It had sprinkled a few silver hairs among the jetty locks of Doctor Abbott, and had given to Dora a more matronly look, but she had lost none of her charm of manners; she was still the same lovable being, the delight of her family, and esteemed by society and beloved by the poor for her kindness and benevolence. She had never been called to pass through any heart-rending scenes. Her parents, husband and children, and only brother had all been spared to her. She had many times wiped the tears from sorrow's eye, but never been called to pass under the rod herself.</p>
               <p>Hermione held to her resolve and remained single; <emph>an old maid,</emph> as her sister Hattie delighted in calling her. She received several offers, some of which she thought were for herself alone, and some for the fortune she possessed. But she had but one answer for them all, and that was that "she never intended to marry." But she was as useful to the world as though she had married. Her time was her own, and she devoted much of it and money, to benevolent purposes.</p>
               <p>Hattie was married, and Mr Stanly did not prove a <emph>saucy</emph> husband, neither was he in any danger of abuse from his wife's <emph>tongue.</emph>
               </p>
               <p>Henry and Lizzie were as happy as ever, and as<pb n="386-387" xml:id="VAC6293-00000194"/> they had no children, were entirely dependent on each other for society. Henry was very thankful, that through the interference of Dora he had secured so good a wife as Lizzie had proved herself to be.</p>
               <p>Mr. Menton still remained a widower. But he never neglected to obey the word of his beloved Alice to come often to her grave, and pray for new strength, to combat manfully with the trials of life. And faithful had he been to her memory. He had struggled with the selfishness of his heart, and overcome it. He was noted for benevolence and generosity. Though he still loved his books, he did not allow them to engross his entire attention, as he had previously done.</p>
               <p>Mr. Malcolm and Adelaide had now two children, of which they were very fond. No one could find fault with Mr. Malcolm, that he was wanting in love for his offspring. Some thought him even too indulgent.</p>
               <p>Fred never seemed to have the least desire to marry again, though some mammas used every exertion to attract the attention of the handsome widower, to their equally attractive marriageable daughters.</p>
               <p>He devoted the most of his time to his children, and his art, in which he became eminently successful. He was distinguished far and wide, as an artist of uncommon talent. None knew the secret of his great success. It was not so much to receive the praise of the living, as it was to answer the anticipations of her who had long since been sleeping 'neath the green mound, in the sunny land of her birth. He lived on, with the blessed hope of being reunited in heaven, to her who had been so dear to him on earth.</p>
               <p>Willie Arnold had gone on from step to step until he had become a highly respected and wealthy citizen of Cuba. Alice had grown to womanhood, and was very beautiful. She possessed the almost faultless features of her mother, and her manners were very interesting. She was now about eighteen, an exact counterpart of what her mother was at that age, as her father often told her. Effie, who was some two years younger than Alice, just '<emph>sweet sixteen,</emph>' loved her with a sister's love.</p>
               <p>The reader may be somewhat surprised when I tell them that an anticipated event is about to take place at Doctor Abbott's. A party, but not a birth-night party, but it is a marriage festival. And who, me-thinks I hear you inquire, are the parties concerned?<pb n="388-389" xml:id="VAC6293-00000195"/> Be not surprised when I tell you that W. Arnold, Esq. has left his southern home to claim the promised hand of Alice in marriage. Wealth and influence are now his, and he can give his fair young bride a home equal in beauty to the one she will leave.</p>
               <p>Alice knows that soon she must part from her who has been to her one of the kindest of parents, and with her two fathers, as she always regarded Doctor Abbott and Mr. Malcolm, and be deprived also of the love and society of Effie. But yet she is willing to leave them all to become the companion of him who is dearer to her than all others.</p>
               <p>A week or two before the wedding was to take place, Doctor Abbott and Dora were sitting together talking over events of the past, present and future.</p>
               <p>"It seems but yesterday," said Dora, "to look back upon it, since Alice was left a helpless infant to our mercy. How rapidly the years have flown since then. Now she who so short a time ago, to think upon, a weak and helpless infant, is about to become a wife."</p>
               <p>"Does it seem any more impossible to you my dear wife, than to know that the noble young man she is about to wed, was once a little match-vender, poor, and dependent upon this, to buy bread for himself and invalid mother?</p>
               <p>"I can scarcely believe my own senses in either case," she replied. "It all seems more like a dream, than reality."</p>
               <p>"It does indeed," replied Doctor Abbott, "but when we look back upon the time when we united our destinies for life it seems impossible that it was so long ago. Do you remember, Dora, a walk we once enjoyed upon the banks of the stream near my mother's house? Our attention was then drawn to the course of two small rivulets, gliding peacefully along together, until they became united in one, and formed quite a stream. It was the wish of our hearts then that such might be our lives, that we might float harmoniously along, and our love become so blended that we should indeed be one; and our lives flow on towards the ocean of eternity, undisturbed by the storms of fate. And so far our brightest hopes have been anticipated. 'Our love hath been no common love.' It has shone with the same radiance at one time as another. Our path, it is true, has led mostly in pleasant places; but if any slight cause threatened<pb n="390-391" xml:id="VAC6293-00000196"/> to disturb the even tenor of our lives, we have been able through united love, to smooth the troubled waters.</p>
               <p>"We are now, my, dear Dora, in the meridian of our days. The past is ours, and many and fragrant are the remembrances connected with it. Whether we have been successful or not, we have 'struggled for the good;' and to our <emph>consciences</emph> we must stand or fall. Our religion can be traced to no particular creed, but the law of right within our hearts. We have endeavored to take Christ for our preacher, his life and teachings for our sermons, and the world for the church. Such, indeed, from the highest convictions of duty within us, we understand to be the doctrine of Christ. It mattered not to him by what name a person worshipped the only true God, if he worshipped him in spirit and in truth, and did unto others, as he would that others should do unto him. Such to him were laborers in the field of right.</p>
               <p>"We are now, I say, in the meridian of life, but soon we must commence upon its decline. Heaven with us has begun on earth, our lives will glide on a few years longer in a more peaceful flow, till at last we shall leave these earthly scenes, to mingle our spiritual love in another sphere."</p>
               <p>"But there are others to come after us and to take our places on the stage of life, over whose youthful characters we have exerted more or less influence. In a great measure we are responsible for their future career. I refer to our children. For though Alice is in reality no child of ours, I know not that we feel less love for her, than for our own offspring. And we have always had so strong an interest in the well-fare of Willie, that he seems already almost as near as a son to our hearts. Alice, under your guidance my dear wife, has become a noble woman. You have been faithful to the trust her mother confided in you. You can have no misgivings when she leaves our home for another, that you have not been as faithful to her as to our own Effie. We shall miss the society of Alice, much in our family-circle, and to Effie, it will be like parting with a sister. But Willie Arnold is every way worthy so good a wife as she will make him. He can, it is true, boast of no proud ancestry, and his early years were passed in poverty, but that has not affected his heart, nor his spotless character.</p>
               <p>"But for you Dora, as he once said, he would never have arrived to the distinction he has now, by his energy<pb n="392-393" xml:id="VAC6293-00000197"/> ergy and industry attained. Truly has it been said, it is more blessed to give, than to receive, and that it is more pleasant to confer a favor, than to receive one."</p>
               <p>"I should feel that my account would be deserving of blame, if at the close of life, I could not look back upon some acts of kindness to my fellow-beings," said Dora, thoughtfully.</p>
               <p>"Your entire life, my dear wife, has been a mission of love to others. Whatever of good there is in me, has been drawn out and cultivated by you."</p>

               <p>THE elegant residence of Doctor Abbot appeared almost as if illuminated, so brilliantly was every room lighted. Carriages were till quite late driving to and from the door, bringing guests to the wedding of Willie and Alice. The rooms are filled, and all are looking eagerly for the bride and bridegroom. Doctor Abbott and Dora, felt the same as they would, were it their own daughter's wedding, and Effie, instead<pb n="394-395" xml:id="VAC6293-00000198"/> stead of the bridesmaid, the bride. Mr. Malcolm was there, to witness the marriage of his daughter, of whom he was very fond. He wore an unusually thoughtful face, as it reminded him of the time, years ago, when the mother of Alice, was, like herself, young and happy, about to unite her destiny to him who she trusted would make her future life joyous. Her fate had been so dark, and he saw too, that he had been its cause, that this occasion made him sad, though he had no misgivings as to the character of him who was to be Alice's husband. It was his own conscience that troubled him.</p>
               <p>Mr. and Mrs. Capen and Minnie were there. Judge of the feelings of Mrs. Capen as mother to the young man who had so nobly answered the anticipations of his childhood. He had been a faithful son to his worse than widowed mother, in their days of poverty and adversity. And now that fortune had so kindly smiled upon him, he was none the less devoted.</p>
               <p>That mother must be pardoned if she indulged some feelings of pride, as the door sprang open, and the noble form and features of her son, with Alice as his bride, with all the unsullied beauty and innocence of an opening rose-bud, entered the room, followed by Effie and her cousin Fred, as attendants.</p>
               <p>Alice so reminded Mr. Malcolm of her mother, on her wedding night, that it was with difficulty he could control his feelings. It seemed as though he must be transported back to his own wedding-night, and the lovely bride before him his own Annie. Memory of those days was ever painful to him, and he strove to forget the mournful past, in the present, which was bright and joyous.</p>
               <p>Alice Malcolm was a beautiful bride, and her character was as pure and spotless as the dress she wore. The charm of youth rested upon her features, for eighteen summers only had she known. <q>
                     <lg type="quotation">
                        <l>"Thou'rt young to wear the bridal bloom;</l>

               <p>But her early training had been such, that she was well calculated to become a wife, and one too well worthy the high-souled Willie Arnold. It does not always follow that one must be born in a <emph>palace,</emph> to be<pb n="396-397" xml:id="VAC6293-00000199"/> well-bred, for he was naturally refined in his tastes and manners, and his intercourse with the world had lent an ease and polish to his appearance, that made him a thorough gentleman. There was a look of conscious worth upon his face, but it did not amount to arrogance, it only gave to him an assurance of manner, that caused him to feel perfectly at home in society, and lent to his handsome features manliness. He possessed none of that pride that made him ashamed of his humble origin; he was not afraid to speak of the time when he was a poor little match-vender.</p>
               <milestone n="*   *   *   *   *   *   *   *" unit="typography"/>
               <p>With many kind wishes for their future success and happiness in life, the newly married pair set off for their southern home. Soon after their arrival, letters were received from both of them, speaking of their safety, and expressing the gratitude of their hearts towards Doctor Abbott and Dora, for their past kindness to themselves. When these letters arrived they were perused by both Dora and her husband with considerable emotion, while Effie was completely overwhelmed with her feelings.</p>
               <p>The one from Alice ran thus:</p>
               <q>
                  <floatingText>
                     <body>
                        <div type="letter">
                           <p>"My Dear Parents—I now address you from my<emph>new home.</emph> Varied are the emotions, as I take my pen to write you, that crowd themselves into my thoughts; but the uppermost of them all is <emph>gratitude.</emph> My dear mother, now that I am absent from you, I can more fully unbosom myself to you. When I reflect upon the time (of which I have so often heard you speak,) when <emph>I</emph> a trembling infant was cast upon you for protection, torn by heart-rending circumstances from my own mother's breast, I cannot but regard you, as indeed you have been to me, a '<emph>guardian angel.</emph>'</p>
                           <p>"Yes, though to me was denied the privilege of being nursed upon the bosom of her who had borne me; you received me in my helplessness, and clasped me with a mother's fondness to your heart. Ah! how my heart bleeds to think of the mental agony of my mother's heart, as she took me, her first-born, from its cradle, and for the good of her child, to have it reared in <emph>love</emph> and <emph>harmony,</emph> stifled the wild throbbings of her breaking heart, and robbed her own life of its brightness, rather than her babe should grow to know that its father <emph>loved it not.</emph> Sweet mother though my infant lips were never taught to lisp thy name, I love thy memory. I would not now cast<pb n="398-399" xml:id="VAC6293-00000200"/> any reflection upon him who has shown since then, a father's fondness. But it is hard to think of her sad fate. That picture which she placed upon my neck with her own fair hands, while her sweet-toned voice, which, though so long ago heard, still sounds in my ear, whispered, 'be a good girl, and look every day at this, your mother's picture.' My infant mind could not then comprehend the meaning of her words; you were the only one whom I had ever called mother—but still I set a strange value upon the gift. 'My picture-mother,' was very dear to me.</p>
                           <p>"I am dwelling perhaps, at too great length upon these events, but thought is a strange thing, and we cannot always control its wanderings. As you pillowed my head in infancy, so you learned my tottering limbs to know their use. And in my earliest years, diffused into my childish mind good lessons for the future. You learnt me to look upon God as a God of love, and to make true religion the every day thought of my heart.</p>
                           <p>"To you, my dear father, I would also say one word. Never was a child blest with a kinder parent than you have been to me, who possessed not the claim of an <emph>own</emph> child upon your affection. You have conferred a lasting favor upon her who feels all a daughter's love for you.</p>
                           <p>"I must not make my letter too lengthy, for Willie is also writing, and I fear we may weary your patience. I will soon close, but first let me say a few words to Effie, who is dear to me as a sister. We are now prevented from enjoying social converse, but 'distance cannot conquer our love.' Soon I hope to have you with me for a while; and then we will indeed be happy. My home is a pleasant one, but if it were not for the society of my husband I should pine to be with you all, once more.</p>
                           <p>"Willie is so well known here, and we receive so many invitations, and are obliged to entertain so much company, that were I so disposed, I find but little time to indulge in loneliness. Write often to us, and soon we shall expect to welcome you to <emph>our</emph> home. With much love, I remain yours, affectionately,</p>

                           <p>"We are both of us greatly indebted to you for our present comfort and enjoyment. You kindly cherished <emph>her,</emph> when a feeble little one, and watched over her after-years with parental fondness. And to me you gave succor, when, had it not been for you timely assistance, my life would probably not have been spared.</p>
                           <p>"We do not forget these benefits; and always will your memories be cherished by us.</p>
                           <p>"I have now amassed a fortune worth possessing, and which will enable me not only to support my family handsomely, but afford ample means for me to seek out those unfortunate children, whom circumstances have destined to be reared in poverty, and denied of those advantages, for which I so longed in my childhood, but which would never have been mine, had it not been for your kindly interference in my behalf.</p>
                           <p>"As I have before said to you, whatever I am or ever shall be, I owe my entire success to your encouragement. If, like you, as age advances, I can look back upon a well-spent life, and know that I have caused joy to shine into hearts where before all was darkness and sorrow, I shall not feel that I have lived in vain. I will ask for no greater boon than this—I care but little for other <emph>fame</emph> than this.</p>
                           <p>"I feel assured that in Alice I possess a treasure, and that she will be a co-worker in any act of benevolence. The highest compliment I can pay to you, is, that no one could have remained eighteen years under the healthful influence of such a home as yours, and not become worthy the love of one better than I. Adieu, my dear friends, and may the blessings of life that have so far been yours, be continued to you is the sincere wish of your friend and well-wisher.</p>

               <p>WOULD that there were more such as thee, sweet Dora! It matters not that many years have passed since first we greeted thee when thou wert <emph>sweet sixteen.</emph> Thy spirit is as lovely now as then. Time has added to, not dimmed, the lustre of thy pure soul. Thy mission to earth has been a glorious one, and the recording angels have written thy name among those who have been faithful servants in the Lord's vineyard.</p>

               <p>The poor have never raised their petitions to thee in vain. Thy tears have flowed for those in distress, while you have pointed the mourner to that never-failing source of consolation to the bereaved heart. The dying have blessed you with their latest breath and called upon heaven to reward you. Thou hast pillowed the tender and helpless years of infancy upon thy breast, and supplied the tie of mother to one denied its blessing.</p>
               <p>Thy encouraging word and smile has fanned into a flame the spark of ambition and energy, which but for thee, had ere long died out of the heart of one, who now stands a noble monument of what you, by your benevolence, have made him.</p>
               <p>Yes, would there were more like thee,—more such daughters, more such wives, more such mothers, and more such noble examples of what a woman should be.</p>
               <p>If there were more like thee, our jails would be less crowded with youth, who by cruel circumstances, have been led on to sin. If there were more ready to follow in thy footsteps, there would be less of crime and poverty in the world.</p>
               <p>If those who possess the means and time would devote vote a greater portion of them in seeking into the secret haunts of poverty, and with their own hands administer to their wants; if they would take the interest that thou hast, in searching for the gems in the hearts of children born in a low condition of life, but which are enshrined there as much as in those of their own class, how many buried treasures would they bring to view? and when they should have become purified from the dross with which it may have been surrounded, then will they shine out with all the brilliancy of gold from the refiner's hand.</p>
               <p>How sweet at the close of life must be the reflections of one like thee. As thou approachest the valley of the shadow of death, no haunting recollection of the good thou hast neglected to do to thy fellow-creatures, will disturb the hour, when thou art to take thy final leave of all things earthly, and join thy seraphic songs with the loved ones who have gone before thee to that world to which we are all hastening. There to meet him who has promised to us below that our Father in heaven has mansions for his children, which He has gone to prepare for them.</p>
               <p>Thou hast made it a study of thy life, to make his examples and precepts a guide to thy path; and in<pb n="406" xml:id="VAC6293-00000204"/> that world thou shalt receive the reward He has promised to such as thee.</p>
               <p>Thou art now in the summer of thy existence—the spring-time is past—and the autumn is near at hand; soon the evening hours of life will come, the winter of thy days. But may the remembrance of thy many virtues render it cheerful. And when thy summons come to join the throng above, may thy departure be but a happy transition from earth to heaven. <q>
