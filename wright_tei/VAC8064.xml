PEARSON, In the Clerk's Office of the District Court-of the United States for the District of Ohio.   OLINDA;; OR, THE MEXICAN'S DAUGHTER.   CHAPTER I. In the morning twilight of the tenth day of April of the year eighteen hundred and forty-six, Lopez Pecosta, an aged citizen of Santiago, as he looked across the great gulf toward the east, observed the dim out- line of a ship's hulk, floating within the mouth of the river. Surprised at a sight so unusual, for at that daym  vessel seldom en- tered the channel, he picked up his walking stick and trudged down the bank of the stream, until he -stood directly opposite. Leaning forward upon his staff, which he planted firmly on the ground for support,- be raised his hand to the broad brim of his hard felt hat, and pulled it a little downward to intercept the glimmering. After intently gazing for a few moments, he was enabled to make out a schooner of two or three hundred tons burthen: but the darkness- prevented more particular observation. Not content with what hecould discern he shifted theposition of his hand, and placing it behind his ear, bent to the segment of a circle, endeavored to distinguish the conver- sation of those- on board. But the bustle of the sailors, busily employed at some: sort of noisy labor, and the confusion bof different voices, several persons speaking at the Isame moment, completely baffled his effort Never- theless, he was now and then able to catch a wiord, more distinctly or loudly uttered than its fellows, and became satisfied- that the   language used, although he could not under- stand its meaning, was English, and strongly suspected that those on board were Ameri- cans. This conclusion seemed to inspire the old man with renewed vigor, for he instantly raised himself from his leaning posture, and stood firmly upon his own natural suppor- ters. '"Thank God!" he exclaimed, with a gesture of reverence, "my prayer is answered. Here is a way opened, and through it I shall conduct to power the pride of his country- to power which be only ought to exercise over a country which he alone can save from destruction." Having uttered these words, he walked quickly away toward the village; but after a few paces, changing .his intention, turned again to the vessel; which he hailed, as if he would assure himself before he returned. "Ahoy, -ship!" he cried in the Spanish tongue, hoping-to attract the attention of those oq board, and to elicit- an answer that would quiet his doubts. "Who calls, and for what purpose?" replied the Captain of the vessel, in the same lan guage. On hearing this answer, the old man ex- claimed witih a great oath, 'Deceived again, again disappointed." And in the angers of the moment, he gnashed his teeth and struck the ground repeatedly with his cane, which was split from the socket to the haft, and rendered entirely useless. 3  &#xD;<pb n="4-5" xml:id="VAC8064-00000004"/> But the ebullition was only of a moment's f duration. He quickly subdued his anger, and u begun to interrogate the commander, using I a loud voice and a tone of authority. "Your d craft, sir" he enquired, as if he had not un- i derstood the question from the ship, "of what name and country?^            There was something in the construction of 1 this inquiry, that excited suspicion in the breast o ihe skipper. He felt confident that 1 the inten o ator was not of the peasantry, but who or vmat he was he could not judge by r the faint light at that distance. For a  oent he hesitated, and then re- solve upon a course to be pursued. "My vessel is called the Flying Cloud," he replitkd  "and she belongs to Buenos Ayres." This was not at all impossible, though somewhat unlikely, as the vessels of that coun- try seldom sailed in the-waters of North Am- -erica. The fLOt was not unknown to the Mexican, as was evident from his next inter- rogatory, "What induced you to visit this port?" he continued, in the-same tone of voice, "We have been driven from our course by the storm, and compelled to enter your har- bor' for safety," answered the commander. "To what port are you bound, and with what are you freighted?" persevered Pe- costa. -We are on a voyage to New -Orleans with a cargo of cattle-pelts," returned the skipper.--- "What are they worth in that market?" persisted the interrogater. "I am not informed," said the trader; and be quickly added, changing the character of the dialogue," what name bears, this river?" "Rio Grande del Norte," replied Pecosta. "What is the depth of the water on the bar when the tide is -down?" inquired the skipper- "About three feet," answered Pecosta. "The water of the river is very low at pre- sent, and a vessel as large as yours would be staved in an attempt to cross before the flood." Having ,imparted this information, he turned away, and walked slowly back toward the villagye. But his thoughts, unlike his   feet, were rapid as. the current of the river upon whose bank hM was meditating; and before his receding figure was concealed by distance from the vision of those on board the vessel, his plans were fully matured. Meanwhile the- following conversation, carried on in the English tongue, took place between Captain Leonard, master of the Flying Cloud and Mr. Williams, his first mate. But before repeating this conversation it may be well to describe the personal appear-, ance of the former, as he is to figure conspic- uously in-the following pages. Captain Leonard was a man above six feet in height, well proportioned, and very mus- cular. He was about thirty-six years of age, and time had traced a few faint wrinkles on his forehead and at the'ou'ter corners of his eyes. His complexion, originally of that rud- diness characteristic of the Anglo-Saxon, by lorg exposure to tropical influence bad ob- tained an olive hue. His eyes were dark, and also his hair and whiskers, the latter of which reached half-way to his girdle. For several years a razor had not touched his face, and his beard, except that his mustaches were a trifle too long, was very handsome, and added much to his imposing appearance. Altogether Captain Leonard was such a man as is seldom seen, but never seen without ad- miration. "My fears are realized," said the Captain, commending the conversation.. 1 "This is not the Brazos Santiago as you supposed, but the Rio Grande del Norte.-" "I inferred as much- from what old Som- braro said," returned the mate, "though I didn't understand a word he uttered." "We have got ourselves into an unpleas- ant predicament," said the skipper. "How so?" inquired the mate. , "If you think we fun any risk in remaini' g here un- til the billows subside, we can weigh anchor-' and put to sea." "Not until the tide flows," replied the master, "for there is but three feet of water on the bar at, the ebb." "The d--l" exclaimed Mr. Williams "Then, indeed, our situation. is unpleasant." "Yes, and dangerous, too," added the,   master. "Yon old Mexican will have-a score ' or two of soldiers down on us before the sun ,is ao bour high. "Does he know who we are?" inquired the i mate. "No," replied Captain Leonard; "but as soon as the sun di'spels the 'twiligfht, he will not only discover our true character, but de- tect me in a falsehood." "A falsehood!" repeated the mate, "Why, what did you tell him?" In reply, Captain Leonard rehearsed the conversation that had passed between him- self and Pecosta in the presence of Mr. Wil- liams, who, like the rest of the crew, under- stood not a word of Spanish. 1  "'And whether the curiosity of yon, Id Mexican is satisfied," he added in conclusion, "depends entirely upon the degree' of credit he attaches to my story; but our safety de- pends, in a great measure, upon our own ex- ertions, for as soon as it becomes known that a vessel is in the river, the banks will be covered with both male and female venders of almost every age, laden down with bread and meat, and garden vegetables, wishing to traffiv4, I have traded a great'deal among these people, and am well acquainted with. their customs." "What course do you propose to follow?" inquired Mr. Williams, who, was beginning to grow uneasy. -^ "In the first-place," - ied the skipper "the stars and stripes must be lowered, and the flag of Buenos Ayres run up la their stead. In the next place, we must throw a tarpaulin over the barrels upon the- upper deck, and, permit nothing to remain visible that may be distinguished from the shore and lead to our detection. And in the third place if they come, as I believe they will, we must trade with them' on the shore, and endeavor to engage their attention until the Hood ena- bles us to escape.1 &amp; "But suppose they come in boats, as 'is frequently the case, at New Orleans and, GaL- veston with those who wish to sell or ba\ter vegetables?" suggested Mr. Williams. "We must immediately weigh anchor," re- plied the Captain, L and pass out of the river beyond the possibility of such intrusion.   There is space enough between the bar and the shore to ensure our safety, as the canoes of these people would be swallowed up in such billows as are now dashing against the beach" Turning to te sailors, who were sitting about in different places, spinning yarns for the amusement of each other, he cried, "'UP, my lads, and heave the anchor." A portirof the sailors, under the direc- tion of the second mate, proceeded to raise the anchor, and the remainder guide d by Mr. Williams,to unfurl a sail. The noise of the capstan soon attracted the notice of others of the inhabitants of San- tiago, and before th- labor was half done, some fifteen or twenty had assembled -on the north shore opposite, near the spot where Pecosta stood when he and the skipper were engaged in conversation. A few minutes after, Pecosta, gliding along, with the current in a light canoe, approached the bow of the vessel unperceived; for al- though the day had begun to break, the ship lay so directly between him and the east, that he was within a boat's length of the stem of the schooner, before -he was observed. "You come late and go early," he remarked, addressing the skipper, who stood on the up- per deck looking toward the shore and on hearing this remark was first aware of his approach. "Captain," continued the Mexican, pull- ing his canoe alongside of the schooner, "I am astonished to finid you wei ing anchor ati a time when an attempt to go over the bar will be certain destruction." "I do not intend, to destroy my vessel -by -the rash step you regard as the consequence of a necessary preparation," replied -Captain Leonard; I am only getting ready to avail myself of the flow,- to clear the bar without injury."     .   - "But--five hours ;'must elapse before the tide will be high enough to carry you over in safety," returned Pecosta, "and niditime if the anchor is taken up, your vessel -w" il!be unmanagOable?"         u This was said; interogatively, for 116costa knew the captain was not so ignorantqas to suppose his vessel would remaini s ttio arv, in 7  &#xD;<pb n="6-7" xml:id="VAC8064-00000005"/> the mouth of a rapid river, without sufficient fasteniligs. "I shall anchor again between the bar and the shore," replied the skipper. "What have you to sell?"         %  The Mexican immediately arose, and stand-! ing in the bow of the boat, which he kept i from running under the large vessel by means of his paddle, began to display sulndry gar- den vegetables, which he offered at a rate far beyond their value in any southern market, scarcely hoping that the skipper would pur- chase at the price demanded; but to his sur- prise, he not only bought his load and paid for it in good Spanish coin, but begged that he would bring another without delay, as he was confidant something might be made on such articles in the market at New Or- leans. Pecosta was not long in transferring his little cargo to the schooner, which being done, he struck out toward the shore, but when near the bank changed his course, and ascended the river in the direction of the village. As he glidedfiwiftly along, he thus solilo- quised-"Still more do I suspect that yonder little schooner is a government transport of the United States, which has run into this harbor to find security against the gale of yesterday, or mistook the mouth of the Rio Grande for Corpus Christi Inlet. But I will know." These last words were expressed with a firmness that clearly evinced his determina- tion and were followed by increased exertion, which soon carried:the little canoe beyond vision of those on board the schooner. "Mr. Williams, " said the Captain as soon as the canoe had passed out of sight, "I con- cluded as it was not light enough to disein- guish between a barrel of flour and a bale of hides, that I would send the old man away, and endeavor to get beyond his reach in his absence." "He intends to return then?" inquired Mr Williams. "O certainly," replied the Captain. "I sent him for another load of kale and onions. But by the time he gets back, it will be light enough to read the brands upon the   barrel heads, and be must be invited on board and made a prisoner. The disputed territoryis said to be filled with straggling bands of Mexican soldiers from whom we may apprehend danger if discovered in our present situation." "And what shall we do with the prisoner," inquired Mr. Williams. "He could scarcely ride yonder billows in his frail canoe?" "When ourselves are beyond danger," re- plied Captain-Leonard, "We will send him ashore if it can be done- with safety; and if it cannot, we will carry him willi us to Corpus Christi, and turn him over to General Tay- lor with a history of the circumstances. He will be too much delighted with the bread we bring his hungry army to censure us for such a precautionary step, if it does deprive a Mexican citizen Gfhis liberty for a few hours. The sight of an American camp and an American conqueror, together with the price of these filthy vegetables, which are of no manner of use to us, will fully indemnify the old extortioner for a short confinement. any rate and be the consequences what they  ay, in my opinion- there is noother course that will insure our safety and success, whiph are very essential, at this moment, to  the welfare of the whole Army of Occupation. CH APTER II. In the meanwhile the sailors, under the ex- citement of fear, redoubled their exertions to place themselves beyond the reach of danger, Round and round they turned the capstan, link by link they shortened the chain that supported the anchor; but time progressed as well as their labors. Mu - aset to be accomplished when the sun like a great ball of fire, began to rise above the level of the sea, and spread its golden beams ver land and water. And the orb, of day pas but partially visible when Pecosta's canoe, shooting around a projecting angle in the bank, appeared in full view in the stream. "Heave away, lads," cried Captain Leon- ard, to the men at the capstan. Then turn- ing to his mate, he continued, 'Mr. Wil- liams, the old devil is coming again, and   some one with him, who, at this distance, looks like a woman." The descent of the canoe was like a streak of light, so short a time elapsed from its first appearance until it touched the side of the schooner. *'I admire the promptness with which you meet your business engagements," said Cap- tain Leonard, with a flattering smile. "But you must not infer from my expedi- tion," replied the Mexican, quickly '"that I am over anxious to dispose of my vegetables. I can find a ready sale for them in Matamo- ras; and at Point Isabel, which is occupied by a detachment of Mexican soldiers, or at Corpus Christi, which is the head quarters of the Army of Occupation, they command a price considerably beyond what you were charged. But it is less trouble to sell at one's own door as it were, and I hurried lest you would be beyond the mouth of the river, when I should not like to venture my little canoe, and whence you might have thought it too much trouble to dispatch a boat to meet me at a point of safety." "You think less of my honor than Ido myself," replied Captain Leonard. "Not for one moment should I have considered the trouble against a breach of my engage- ment. Besides" he added, glancing at the young lady who occupied a seat in the stern of the canoe, "a sunlight -view of so sweet a countenauce would have amply rewarded me for a greater venture, without the vege- tables." "This is my daughter," said Pecosta. "But, sir, do not be surprised; a rose may grow in a peasant's garden as well as in a lord's, and if it receivesless culture, may possess no less fragrance. Olinda is a dain- ty thing, if she is uncultivated." To which Captain Leonard replied, raising his Panama and bowing to the youn: lady, who returned his salute with a slight incli- nation of the head, "I shall feel Iqyself highly honored if you and your pretty daughter will step aboard my vessel and taste a glass ofmy, wine. It has travelled with me from France} the country of its manufacture, and is none the worse for being unadulterated." "It is very seldom I indulge in vinous be-   verages of any kind--my daughter never,' replied Pecosta. "As our pursuitsare hum- ble, our habits of life are simple and our diet frugal." "If the lady's rosy lips but touch the rosy wine," returned the captain, "I shall be satis- ficd V" "Do not urge my darling," said the Mexi- can, "I shall drink enough for both father and daughter." 'That will suffice," said Captain Leonard with a smile, "if the daughter bears the father company." "To manifest their good will, it is far from necessary that either should enter your vessel," returned Pecosta; 'nevertheless, that you may not esteem me churlish, I will share with you the contents of your bottle in your own cabin." As soon as the second cargo of vegetables was transferred from the canoe, a rope ladder -was thrown over the starboard side of the schooner, and Pecosta received on board. Olinda, with her blushing face averted fromin the rude gaze of the sailors retained herseat ' in the stern of her father's little boats Captain Leonard recieved hisguest with outstretched hand, and conducted him to his cabin. From a small closet he took a bottle of wine, and filling a brace of tumblers that stood on the table, presented one to Pecosta. The other he took in his own hand, and look- inig steadfastly into the face of her father, simply uttered the name of Olinda. Pecosta returned the look with a tearful eye, and swallowed the contents of his tum- bler at a siule draught, to indicate that his daughter's happinless, compared with all things else together, was as the flowing gob- blet to the dregs that settle at the bottom. Captain Leonard in the most courteons manner, imitated the example of the affiec- tionate parent, and immediately refilled the glasses; bet. Pecosta declined a-second indul- igence, assuring him that the large. quantity he had already imbibed, owing to his-abste- meous habits, would certainly produce dizi- ness, perhaps downright intoxication. The glasses were pushed aside,. and a si- lence of several minutes followed. - At length Pecosta signified his desire to return to his  &#xD;<pb n="8-9" xml:id="VAC8064-00000006"/> daughter.  Whereupon Captain Leonard drew out his purse, and paid him the price of the second boat load of vegetables. --This is done,' said he, "in fulfilment of my agreement, and to convince you that I design no evil to you or your daughter. The vegetables I have purchased at a double price I have no use- for, and shall be obliged to throw them into the sea." "I declare upon my honor," said Pecosta, I have not demanded an exorbitant price. But. aside from this, the vegetables were worth to me all I have received for them, and you were not compelled to purchase." True," replied the captain "but I had- a purpose to subserve; and as I have effected the object at which I aimed, I should like to re-sell the vegetables at sigh a discount as will compensate you for your trouble. You say they are worth to you all I paid for them?" 'cI used the past, not the present tense,' returned Pecosta. While the vegetables were in the ground they were valuable to me but now they are not. Only fresh vegetables can be sold in our markets, and they must be conveyed thither in thenight. By the time I should carry those you have purchased to Matamoras or Corpus -Christi through the sun, I might stand by them until they decomposed egJ had, a purchaser. "If pulling them from the ground does them so much injury," said Captain Leonard, "why did you not inquire if I wished to pur- chase before you brought the first load? You were the first that observed our presence, and stood a good chance of making a suc- cessful bargain." "It is so rare a thing to see a sea-vessel in the river," replied the Mexican, "that the thought did not occur to me until after my return home, and then I feared to go back lest in my absence some one should antici- pate my intentions. Therefore, of the first load, which-yow know was small,-I chose to venture the loss of the price, rather than the -loss of the opportunity" "I will not spend time in an attempt to prove the folly of your choicei" returned Captain Leonard, "but will at once assume 1L:    that you are not a gardener, and that the ob- ject of your visit was not so much to dispose of a few worthless vegetables, as to discover the true character of those who preferred the jaws of the enemy to the-bosom of the great deep." "As the Lord lives," said the Mexican in the most solemn manner, "I am a gardener, honest in the pursuit of my profession, and dependent upon the labor of my own hands for subsistence."  "In my country," said the Captain, "where the dissemination of knowledge is more gen- eral than perhaps in any other, men of your vocation are not usually so well skilled in the use of language, as you have shown yourself to be throughout your conversation." "Indeed, sir," replied Pecosta, with an air of truth, 'I am wholly ignorant of the skill which you profess to have discovered. I have only endeavored to express my thoughts in suitable language. In doing so, if I have chanced to use a word or phrase above my position, it should not be regarded as an evi- dence of education, but as a favor of the memory. It has been my good fortune, many times in my life, to meet learned men in the transaction of business, as I have this morn- ing met yourself; and on these occasions I treasured up every expression that pleased my ear at the moment, as I have done several that have fallen from your own lips, that I mightuse- them afterwards. The metaphor of the rose, the only one I now remember, is of this character.' "And would you have me believe that a man who traffics lkale and garlick, because he has happened to meet a few learned men in the course of -hislife, would be qualified to speak of phrase and metaphor, and tenses past and present, as you have done this morn- ing? It is no use to attempt further disguise, for your speech betrayeth you. N ow, lsir. what is the object of this deception?" -The truth'was, Lopez. Pecosta had no thought that the commander of the small trad- ing vessel could detect his imposture by the language used in conversation. But the rule by ,which he measured the education of sea- men, while its general application to those   of some nations might do no injustice. wOi'd t find among this class of Americans a, mu!ti- I tude of brilliant exceptions. 'Against. you," he replied, to Captain s Leonard's interrogatory, "I have used no de- ception. I am a gardener, and by the labor N of my own hands support myself and daugh- i ter. And I have visited your vessel with no i other intention than to malke sale of my I vegetables." "I will hot take time now to inquire why ( you, who are evidently possessed of a good education. should be engaged in so humble a -profession; or for what purpose you have as- sumed the false character in which you stand self-convicted. You are a man of too much intelligence to be at liberty until my vessel is beyond the bar. Until then you are my prisoner." "It is not convenient for me to remain here until the tide is up," said Pecosta, embarras- sed; "but if it is your determination," he quickly added, with affected indifference, "I must submit, not having the power to op- pose. But -you will allow me to inform my daughter, who, by this time must be anxious on account of my protracted absence." "I crave your pardon," said Captain Leon- ard. "I had entirely forgotten your daugh- ter. She shall come aboard and share your imprisonment. No injury shall be done to either beyond a few hours confinement, which -deem essential to my own safety. Shall I inform your daughter that -you desire to see her in the cabin of the Flying Cloud?" Pecosta signified his assent wit} a short nod, and Captain Leonard, carefnlly closing the door of the cabin, ascended the stairs to the uppermost deck, from which he accosted Olinda. "Beautiful maiden!" said he, "it is your father's desire that you come to him in the cabin of my vessel without delay. -Run your canoe alongside, and I will assist you on board."         . - Almost the last thing my faSder faMin my presence-," returned thie maiden,- ia a voice as sweet and winning as her count&amp;n- ance, "was a promise to drink for me as well as himself, if it was necessary our good will should be thus manifested; and the proposi-   tion was accepted as a substitute formy presence."  "But if your father has changed his mind?' said Captain Leonard. "I must have it from his own! lips," ans- wered the maiden. "There are conditions in which a man is unable to -express his thoughts," returned Captain Leonard. "While reason controls the man, he can control his tongue," replied Olinda. "Wine will thicken a man's tongue before it will muddy his brain," said the Captain. 'Few men are so abstemious as my father." returned the damsel, in a tone of slight re- proach; and it he has become intoxicated in the short time that has elapsed sinee he left this canoe, you have administered something -more potent than wine." "And suppose I have," returned Oaptila Leonard, 'would you allow hMn to suffer for want of your presence and care?"'   ; "If the father has suffered treatcheryan d wrong at yonr hand, the daughter could not hope to fare better," said Olinda.  "But if he has suffered no injury?" persis- ted the Captain. "Then my presence is not ne-dede;d" "a swered the maiden.     -  Captain Leonard, not knowing how to meet her objections, returned -to She cabin, aand repeated to Pecosta tlihe language of This daughter, and passed a saitable-encomiUm i upon her for her quiwk-witted replies. ; ' "I will not bid my daughter coAe aeoard - ; your vessel," replied the MYexicani;'J"I -will explain to her my unpleasant situatiotn- -and  leave her to act her own pleasure."' I  "That will suffice,"-said the Captain.- "Fil- ial love will bring her to-your side,l and that ris all I desire." e He then returned to the deck, aecompoip- i ied-by Pecosta, who said,in a-rather moWS- 1 ful voice, "Olinda, my darling, I am here a prisoner.".  ^     .  i - But these words had not the effect Cap- a tain Leonard desired. Scareely *we 'hey - Outered, when the niaidtOn,plaCieg her paddle "against theside of ttie ship, forced her little "boat away with her utmost strength. "' Like i- an arrow it flew- toward the*north sidteof the  &#xD;<pb n="10-11" xml:id="VAC8064-00000007"/> river till within a few yards of the banks I where it was turned up the stream. As she glided by those on the shore, she spoke a - few hasty words, which produced an inst n- taneous'excitement, that in a few "minutes was visible to all on board. TWhen st e reaca- ed the projecting angle before mentioned, she looked back on the schooner, and seeing her ratherleaning on the gunwale with his eyes berrt on her, waived the paddle above her head, and the next moment disappeared. CHAPTER III. Now the necessity for increased exertion on the part of the sailors was greatly eOhan-, ced, for although the maiden was ignorant of I the true character of the vessel, yet she was  too. well assured of the fact that her father  was therein a prisoner From those on shore i there was obviously nothing to apprehend, for I beside a large quantity of vociferous talk,-- there was no evidence that the fact had come to their knowledge. Captain Leonard Swas I unable to account for this inaciivity, on any ( other thanthe following hypothesis. It was 1 his opinion, which he expressed to Pecosta ( as well as his crew, that they were made ac- 1 quainted with the intentions of the maiden,!  who had gone to apprise some garrison or I other - body of soldiers, of her father's im- e prisonmeot, to procure their assistance tol@ effect his liberation. .  "I am not at all surprised at the deport- t ment of those on shore," replied Pecosta, e when Captain Leonard inquired the cause of their inactivity. "They have no interest b in-my welfare, for I am a stranger among s them, I came hither from Texas, and Other t regard me as a fugitive from justice. They g may term your aec a daring- outrage or a o villianous treachery, and shower upon your head curses innumerable, and vet I know to they secretly rejoice that I am here a pris- p oner."                 - "But the same cannot be said of your I daughter, who has gone to summon the sol- tl diers Up her assistance?' said Captain Leon- i( ard.                  'c ' You greatly mistake the character of my v   ! d drling," returned the Mexi oC  "Shjis not e aheroine. On the contrary, she is timid as a a fawn, and starts at the approach of oanger - as she fled from the presence-oF her father's s imprisoner." i 'Aiswer me,-and answer me truly, 'said , Captain Leonard, with an air of authority, "is there a Mexican garrison at Santiago?" s  "'here is none within the disputed territo- a ry,"' replied Pecosta, 'except the small de-  tachment at Point Isabel, before men- tioned." "Only two weeksaco,r' returned Captain Leonard, all the coast country lying between -the Rio Grande and the Nueces, was filled with straggling bands of cavalry, belonglng  to the regiments under the command of r Canales and Minon?" '-But since then" replied the Mexican, (6theyr have been collected together, and are now at Malamoras wailing the arrival of Genera! Arista, who is entrusted withi the --chief command." )uring this conversation, Pecosta leaned upon the gunwale of the schooner, with his eyes intently turned towards the north. But his gaze did not escape the observation of Captain' Leonard, who repeatedly looked in the same direction, concluded, as he could , discern nothing unusual,. that succor was ex- pected from Point Isabel. Under the influ- ence of this opinion he urged his men to still ' greater efforts, and expressed the confident belief that the maiden had gone to summon the Mexican soldiery, trom whom they could expect nothing bat robterg and death. Stimulated to more vigorous exertion b-the increased apprehension, the seamen soon brought the anchor home, and spread the great three-cornered sail to catch the gentle wind that was to bear them to a point of safety. When the prow of the vessel was turned towards the gulf, the Mexican shifted his position to the opposite side, and continued togaze toward the north. Again Captain Leonard CIoked in the same direction, an4 al- though-nothing appeared to support the opin- ion already mentioned, he was more firmly convinced of its truth, as. the singular beha- vior of the Mexican was otherwise inexplica-   ble. But as they were passing beycind the reach of da ger, he regarded it as a matter of small i aportance-s\arcely worthy of con- sider;ation. "And is it the design of your govern- ment," said he, resuming conversation with Pecosta, "to -fight for the little strip of bar- ren land Iying bstween these rivers?" "Most assuredly," answered the Mexican, with emphasis. "And it expects to blot out the o ily evidences of title which the Ameri- cans heve, with the blood of their mercenary soldiers." "You have a mistaken notion of our army," returned Captain Leonard. - "Oulr soldiers do not fight for money, but for the honor of their country." "Arethose native Americans who com- prise the Army of Occupation?" inquired Pecosta. "I do not mean the officers, for they are of course, but the rank and file!" '"It must be confessed that many of those are foreigners," replied the American; "but military service is asauch their vocation as gardening isyours, and they pursue it, for the same purpose-a livelihood." "That is to say,' returned the Mexican, "they fight for money." "It is one thing," returned the Captain, "toengage in military pursuits as a busi- ness, and quite another, as you very well know, to enaage services for a particular oc- casion and consideration." "Thire is certainly a difference," said Pe- costa, with a sneer, "and there is also a dif- ference between- tweedle-dum and tweedle- dee.  "It is of little consequence to our govern- ment," said Captain Leonard, "whether a - soldier be a native or a foreigner; success is the great desideratum." "Yes," said -Pecosta,- with another look of disdain, "and that will account for the great number of foreigners which are to be found in your army. Your government is too ambi- tious to engage in a war of invasion and con- quest without the hope of success, and in the present case there is reason to believe that the hope is based upon the prowess of her Irish soldiery." "Tou cannot have a higher opinion of Irish   itJtrep)idity than I already entertiin,"' return- ed Capt;in L-onar;d, '*so that subject adlnits of no discusion on the -present occasion; of American bravery I have only to say, that the history cf the past furlnishe. abundant proof of its superiority, and supercedes the necessity of particularity." "'You have reason to vaunt," said Pecosta. 'Your arms have beeu many tim 's victorious. But as Set you have only met the aborigines of the wilderness, whose 'wooden bows and flint poiated arrows a-vail but little in a strife where lead and steel are used against them; and the English, who are 'only indomitable when they encounter the effeminate inhabit- ants ot the Eastern Hemisphere." ,-You are not so young as to -have never heard, nor so old as, to have forgo(tten, the battle of San Jacinto, where General Hlous- tonj a native of America, with a smnall body of American troops, met the flower of- the Mexican army, under the command of its moat distinguished Captain, and against a very great odds obtained a most complete victory, and made the General in chief of the discomfited army a prisonkr of war. You must have heard of that engagement?" said Captains Leonard, with a smile of triumph. A  shade passed over the dark features -of Pecosta, but he made no reply.  Hlis eyes were still turned in the direction before men- tioned, but the shore, the chapperal, the trees and the sky, were all that were visible. For a moment Captain Leonard' regarded him with attention.  He was of the medium height, slender, and slightly stoop-shouldered. - His features, like his person, were meagre, and his complexion a chesnut-brown. . His eyes were large, black of course, brilliant, and very expressive. He was clad in a suit of coarse gray cloth, and over his shoulders his hand thrust - through the centre, hung a blanlket of inferior quality, such as are .usu- ally worn by the poorer classes of that coun- try. But in the midst of his observation, Mr. WYilliams claimled his attention. The vessel hbd passed ont of the river, and was rapidly approaching the bar, which-it should have been mentioned before-surrounds thegulf, -and greatly obstructs navigation. The depth  &#xD;<pb n="12-13" xml:id="VAC8064-00000008"/> of water upon this bar is not tlp Paine in all places; along the coast of Texas, and parti- cularly in the region of Brazos Island, it rises so near the surface as to prevent the passage of large vessels under any circum- stances, and those of small dimensions except at the flow of the tide. And in some places it is much nearer the shore than in others, a fact which not unfrequently leads the unskil- ful navigator into difficulty. It was during the night ,that Captain Leonard, riding upon the huge billows that dashed against the beach passed over the river, and he was totally ignorant of his pre- 'cise situation. Besides, he was not at all certain that there was more water than the Mexican had represented while his vessel was drawing Dearly sibfeet. Under, these circumstances it became necessary to drop ' anchor, launch a boat, andrely upon the in- dications of the plumit. Accordingly, the anchor was unloosed from its fastenings and a boat lowered to the water, and manned with sailors under the su- perintendency of Mr. Williams,- who mana- ged the rudder, while another of the crew cast the lead and noted the depth of the wa- ter. Almost immediately, Pecosta left the place he had occupied during the vesselPs descent, and joined Captain Leonard, who stood at the bow, *'I see," he remarked, pointing his finger toward the boat, "that my information is discredited." "You decieved me once," replied Captain Leonard, "and it behoves me therefore not again to trust in your representations." "I confess the imposture," replied the Mex- ican, "but deay that the imposition was in- tended for your injury.', "You are a greater knave -than I supposed,"' said the captain. "Listen!-'four feet,' 'five feet,' fsix feet,'-and neither tide, nor ebb- tide'" At that moment a shout from those on shore attracted his attention, and turning his eyes in that direction he saw hats and hands waving in the air, and in the distance a cloud of dust rising above the tree-tops. itLiarl villian Slhe exclaimed, seizing the   Vt IsK, old man by the throat, and hurling him to the deck with great violence. Then calling through his trumpet, he ordered Mr. Wil- iams to return to the vessel immediately. By this time a company of musketeers, some forty in number, appeared in the dis- tance, and in a few minutes after at the top of their horse's speed, dashed down to the very water's edge. Here they formed themselves into a line, and the officer in command demanded of Captain Leonard, in a very peremptory manner, an immediate liberation of his countryman, threatening the destruction of both vessel and crew if he refused., Captain Leonard replied that as soon as his boat re- turned he would comply witth his request. Hereupon Pecosta called to the commander of the soldiers, to dispatch the citizens for' their canoes and come and take the vessel which was an American transport, loaded with provisions for the Army of Occupation. In accordance with He direction ot Pecos- ta, who spoke as one having authority, the citizens were ordered to bring their canoes with all possible -dispatch. Next the soldiers were ordered to dismount and prepare to board the vessel. Three or four being de- tailed to hold the horses, the company was divided into two sections, and formed at the shore of the river, ready to step into the boats on arrival. In a marvellously short space of time the citizens, onre after another shot round the be- fore mentioned angle and descended the river to He feet of the soldiers, who immediately stepped aboard, and proceeded in two com- panies one on each side of the vessel on both sides at the same time.- By the order of 'the commanding officer, those who followed the north bank of the river, being in advance of the others who were obliged to cross the stream, when- they , had gained a suitable distance, fireditheir - muskets in front of Williams and his party, I to keep them from the vessel. iWhen the mate heard their bullets whist ling by him, and saw them scattering the wa- ter directly in his course, he became terrified, and fled toward the opposite shore. Again , and again Captain Leonard ordered him to r   return, but the fcar of his superior was as nothing to everything, compared with his fear of the Mexicans.  Deserted by -much the larger portion of his crew, Captain Leonard turned to the re- mainder, and said to them, that as they had shipped with him to labor and not to fight, he wouild not control their movements in this emergen*y. "Yet," he added, with energy and deter- mination, "if but one of yon will remain, I will fight till the last drop of blood oozes from my veins before I will surrender; but if you prefer, you may follow the example of your cowardly mesmates." Very much to the surprise of Captain Leonard, who hoped to be able to defend his vessel against the attack of the musketeers, the remainder of the crew, regardless of the shame attached to their ignominious flight, immediately launched the other boat, jumped aboard, and struck out toward the shore which their terrified fellows had already reached, leaving him with none in the vessel but the Mexican, and without the means of escape. The musketeers who were descending the south bank of the river, observing the flight of this portion of the crew, started in pursuit, and running between them and the share forc- ed them out to sea. For nearly an hour thir little boat was visible,- and then it entirely disappeared and was never heard of after- wards. CHAPTER IV. Meanwhile the other party, headed by the officer in command of the company, had ta- ken possession ofthe vessel, and -made Cap- tain Leonard a prisoner. Not a prisoner of war, however, for then he would have been entitled, not only to protection, but to kind treatment, such as is prescribed by-athe law of nations. From the moment of his arrest, he was accounted a victim, and immediate -preparations were made on shore, whither he wae conveyed by order of Lieutenant Muffles, the junior officer of the company, for his tor- ture and execution.   His hands and. feet were pinioned, and bis *body. lashed .to the trunk of a mosqueet tree which grew a short distance from the bank of the river. His body was stripped naked to the .waist, And the women, by the direction of the lieutenant, whipped him with white eb- ony rods, until the flesh of his breastand arms, and so much of his back as was not protected by the pigmy tree, was horribly cut and lacerated. While this barbarous scene wasa being en- acted, to the manifest gratification of the inhuman perpetrators, the soldiers were ma- king free with the wine- of the suffering cap- tive. And in a little time beginning to feel the effecta of the liquor, they, grew merry first, and danced and shouted, then angry, and quarelled and fought, until half their no- ses were dripping blood. At length the tide - began to flow, and the agitation of the vessel, soon removed the cause of their intoxication from their sick stomachs. The nausea Was general and the abandonment of the vessel which the officer had vainly endeavored to effect during the height of their drunkenness, was produced without further trouble. Angry with themselves and with each oth- er, but unwilling to renew -their quarrels, they resolved to vent their spleen upon the prisoner, whom  they reviled and menaced andeven- pricked with the points of their bayonets. 'If you have any authority over these mer- ciless creatures, or any influence with their inhuman commandet, I entreat you to use it for the preservation of my life," begged the suffelrer of Lopez Pecosta. "Your life shall be preserved," replied the Mexican, "but I cannot interfere with these gentlemen's amusement. If I had not been throttled, you would not have been whipped, Nevertheless it was not. ordered by me, though by me it might hate been prevented." "If I ever deserved punishment for the plight injury inficted upon you in a mom nt of, passion. have  I not already endured enough?"said ihe sufferer. "Not unless you are penitent," replied Pe- costs. "I do sincerely regret," said Captain *   &#xD;<pb n="14-15" xml:id="VAC8064-00000009"/> Leonard, "that I could so far lose control of my temper as to lift my hand against an old man, and he a prisoner." "Enough," said Pecosta; and he turned about immediately and cried, i Stand back, men," waving his hands to the soldiers, who were surprised at his interference, and still more at his authoritative demeanour. "By what right do you interrupt our plea- surts?" demanded the lieutenant drawing his sword over the head of the old man. "Away, thou scum of the republic, or I will sever your head from your body, and give your carcase to the dogs." ' To you, Captain Jose Peron, I appeal for clemency on behalf of this helpless prisoner," cried Pecosta, turning to the officer in com- mand. '*Captain Peron," said the lieutenant, "grant not this captive's life, lest we quar- rel, for I say he shall die." "First let me hear the reason for this re- quest," said Captain Percn.. "It may be such as will justify his preservation."'  "Speak out, old man," said the lieutenant, "and let us know what reason you can assihn for this unwarrantable piece of interfer- ence 7"  "I have a reason," replied Pecosta, with a dignity of manner that abashed the lieuten- ant; "lbut it is only for the ears of Captain Pcron." "Mr. Muffles," said the commander, ad- dressing his lieutenant, "yon will see- that no harm befalls this man in my absence." He then joined Pecosta, who had drawn a few paces apart that they might converse un- heard. "Who is that man who has dared to con- trol our actions-to interrupt our pleasures?" demanded the lieutenant of one of the citi- zens. "I don't know,",replied the man addressed "He came here a few days at,o but where from I don't know. He dresses like the peo- ple of Santiago, but he tallks different. It is the general opinion that he isn't what he ap- pears to be, but who he is I don't know.' "And I dont know,2' said - the lieutenant land I don't care. One thinjg I do know howeyer, that this mau shall die or Jose Pe   on shall never be a major." Drawing a line upon the ground with his sword, as Pizarro did on another occasion, he added, "Those of you who are in favor of the prisoners leath will join the side of Pedro Muffles." A short time before all the soldiers were intoxicated, and the nausea occasioned by the sea had but partially sobered them. In this half drunken condition, the anger of their lieutenant found a ready sympathy in their bosoms, and without an exception they cross- ing over the line which he had drawn upon the ground and swore that mortal man should not deprive them of their, vengeance. In the meanwhile the following conversa- tion took place between Pecosta and Cap- tain Peron. i"The time has at length come," said the Former, "when an act of mercy may discharge a debt of gratitude. To preserve the life yon villains seek to destroy, will be an act of justice that may subserve both our interests. At least, nothing can be gained by his death. "I am not insensible of my obligtations to you or unmindful of the many services reeeiv- ed atit your hands," returned Captain Peron, "but if Muffles is resolved upon that man's death, I must submit to lose his influence, without which I shall be defeated." 'The influence of Pedro Muffles might have been essential to the election of Captain Peron," replied Pccosta; "but Captain Pe- ron the captor, stands in need of no such as- sistance. His name will be trumpetted throughout the republic. All men will speak in his praise. His enemies will-not dare to open their mouths." "And suppose all these things should com- to pass, and they are a great deal more than I expect, what difference can the preserva- tion of this man's life produce?" inquired the officer. iHe is a citizen of the U. States-the greatest republic upon the face of the earth, and -the master of one of his government's transports, replied Pecosta; "and leaving the promptings of humanity and the rights of the captive wholly out of the consideration, youri own country, to say nothing 4of other nations, will no more forgive the death of   that prisoner, than it would the destruction of yonder prize."  "I cannot perceive the importance of, this mant preservation,"'returned the officer. "Tte prize is valuable, because -both vessel and cargo are useful; the foitmer will increase our navy, which is none too large, and the latter will support our army, which is none too well fed." "But of what value is the prize compared  with the life of a human being?" inquired Pecosta.. s "It ii worth a thousand such as this man's," replied the Captain. "1 speak not of the life of an, American but of a Mexican," said Pecosta. "I cannot see what the life of a Mexican has to do with the matter," returned Captain Peron. "To preserve one of my conntry- men, if he was a worthy man, I would save or destroy a dozen such lives, and sacrifice a score of such prizes." "Very good," said Pecosta. "If General Arista was a prisoner of war and in the hands of the enemy, would a hundred such prizes procure his liberation?  Would a doz- en such- secure the freedom of the meanest private in our ranks? And yet this man would be received in exchange for any com- 'mon soldier, perhaps for ang officer whose rank wasnot aboveyour own. Doyounow see the importance?" "Viewing the matter in that light," said the officer, "it is of some consequence; never- theless, I will not anticipate such a contiu- gency." "The fortunes of war," returged Phe elder, "is a proverbial expression, and like all pro- verbs, its truth has been established by time and experience. Ten years have not yet elapsed since the flower of our army was de- feated at San Francisco, and the commander in chief made a prisoner. It was these very people who were then our conquerers; and Arista may experience the fate of Santa An-\ na." "In this opinion we widely differ," said the young man. "I believe we shall be conqler- ors, and more than conquerors; you-imagine that Arista will be repulsed, and consequent- ' -/   '    *     -. ly disgraced, and that S1nta Anna will be recalled from his banishment and placed at the head of the army." "I do sincerely believe that all these things will occur," replied Pecosta. "And if they should, all the officers who enter the field with the defeated general, will share his disgrace. If Arista sinks in the estimation of his country, Jose Peron will sink with him, unless he is fortunate enough to secure a broken mast to rest upon. If Santa An na is-recalled, Lopez Pecostawill dff his peasant'sgarb,for his counsel will then be re- quired. And then, if the captor hasmotstained his hands with the blood of inuocence, and covered his memory with eternal infamy, the exiled secretary nay do him a greater service than Pedro Muffles and all his friends could accomplish." "Allow me to quote another proverb," re- turned the officer. "A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush. The certainty of a majority is to be preferred to the mere possi- bility of a colonelship." "But I repeat,"' said Pecosta, impatiently, ,that if Arista should be defeated, Captain Peron will share his disgrace. - As the eap tor of a valuable prize and the first prisoner 'of war, his name will become notorious, and if that prize and prisoner are surrendered to the government without injury, his fame will not exceed his country's praise. Send this man to Arista in my charge, and there will then be one at head quarters to urge your claims." "And suppose Arista should see through your disguise?" inquired the-officer. "Your life is a forfeit the moment you set foot upon Mexican soil." "1I care not if it seals my doom," replied Pecosta. "I will no longer be a wanderer, I would rather have a grave in the land of my birth,- than a home in any I have visited. I have been dispossessed, disfranchised, bati ished; I may yet be executed; but I must die in my own country, if for that country I die a sacrifice."  "I will do what I can,' said the officer. "'You can do all I ask,'" returned Pecosta. --Tbhs -the- conversaioD ended, and the twain retraced, their step\ in silence. CApg b -  &#xD;<pb n="16-23" xml:id="VAC8064-00000010"/> tain Peron, in a brief mamr, presented the matter to his company, m all its bearings, dwelling' particularly upon the value of the prisoner as an exchange. But what was said in reference to Santa Anna was not mention- ed. Muffles listened with patience, and whenPe- ron has finished, replied with a sneer, that the defeat of the Mexican army was an impossi- bility. "It is a-craven thought." he added,'andthe mpan who could entertain it for a moment, is unfit to hold a commission or hold a com- pany." This was an- insult offered Captain Peron, bAt he chose to regard it as merely an opini- on.  "But the vanquished sometimes carry off prisoners in their retreat," he replied.  I know they do," said the lieutenant, "and so do the victors. I have no fears if our army should ever meet that of the Uni- ted States in battle, that we should have a lack of prisoners to exchange. But I care not who becomes a- prisoner, or for whom this man may be exchanged, I am resolved upon his death; not so much to avenge the wrongs done my country by his government as to teach that old meddling villain the res- pect due to officers of the army, and as an example of the punishment that awaits him  should he ever again interfere with my auth- ority."  Lieutenant Muffles," said Peron, earnest- ty,' this murder must not be committed. You are now excited. When your reason has regained the ascendency, you will rejoice that I have kept you from the commission of such a heinous crime." "I submit to the authority -of my superior," said Muffles, with mock deference, and a smile that too plainly expressed his thoughts and his determination "I have no right to dic- tate his choice, but I perceive he would ra- ther be a Captain with a prisoner, than a Major without." Jose Peron, though the youngest Captain in the army, was too ambitious to be content with his situation. There was a vacant ma- jority for which he was a candidate, and with the influence of Muffles and t support   of his friends, his election was regarded as certain. There was likewise a beautiful maid- en to whose companionship he aspired, but without the approval ofLopez Pecosta she whuld never become his wife. Such was the peculiar situation -of Captain Peron at this critical moment. But in his opinion the contest was not be- tween interest and duty; he knew it was his duty to save, and his interest to destroy, the life of the prisoner. It was a contest be- twcenlove and ambition; for if Captain Leon ard was preserved, hishopes of army ad- vancement were blasted, and if he was sacri- / ficed, Olinda was lost to him forever. Pe- costa had said no such thing, he had not in timated the like, but in speaking of the cou- templated deed, he called it murder, and his daughter he would never let become the wife of a murderer. Captain Peron was a man intrinsically bad-totally devoid of honor-capable of crimes. - For a time he hesitated which to sacrifice, his love or his ambition. But the longer he considered, the less val ue he attach- ed to the office, and the more to the maiden. The former might be procured in some other regiment, or at som e other time; but the peer- less Olinda, to whom be was betrothed, was too precious to be lot. And having come to this conclusion, he placed the prisonerin the custody of Pecosta, with orders to con- duct him to  Matamoras, and turn him over to the officer in command. CHAPTER V-. Pedro Muffles was a man who delighted in the sufferings of his fellow creatures. The soldiers feared him, and voted the more read- I ily for the death of Captain Leonard, to es- cape his anger and his cruelty. And when Captain Peron ordered the thongs that bound the prisoner to he unloosed, they looked one at another, and then at the disappointed offi- cer, not knowing what would be the conse. ; quence. But lMuffes, contrary to his usual course, for he was excitable and bositcrous, i especially when crossed in opinion or purpose, t conceale d bia thoughts from all present. t   order of Arista to effect his arrest, learning that he was in the custody of an alguazil, went to the house oahe officer and demanded his surrender. Of course it was refused, and the matter was reported to Arista. The next morning a larger guard was dis- patched, with orders to arrest the alguazil as Well as Martella. The execution of this or- der called forth a protest from the city pre- fect, who claimed that the military had no right, under any circumstances, to interrupt the course of civil justice, and that the arrest of the alguazil was -a high-handed measure that ought not to go unpunished. le farther clailed thatAlphonso Mar- tella, having surrendered himself to the city authorities for examination, was entitled to an investigation of the matter at their hands; that he was a civil and not a military citizen, and ought therefore to be judged by the civi and not by the martial law of the Republic; and that-the examination before the prefect ought to be final and satisfactory. On the other hand, General Arista main- tained that as the murdered man was an officer of the army, the murderer ought to be tried by a court martial, and judged by the military law of the Republic. It was probable that an examination be- fore either tribunal would result in the ac- quittal of the prisoner; but the matter in- volved a question which neither party was willing to sacrifice. The state of excitement  was already very great, and the quarrel wax- ed warmer with the lapse of time. This information fully explained the cause of the neglect Captain Leonard had experi- enced, and he began to regard the dungeon i as his future abode. For hours after the i jailor withdrew, he paced his cell in a state  of excitement little short of - insanity. Up ] and down, and across, and back, 'and angular ' -there was no course he did not take, and  scarcely a- spot upon which he did not tread. ( Once near the head of his bed he felt a 4 brick give slightly under the pressure of his foot, but he was too much excited at the mo- ] ment to derive any advantage from the dis-  covery.  He only avoided it in future, and 1 continued to pace the floor until again ex- f hausted when he cast himself upon"his bed a s,         .   and tried to forget his misery; but sleep had forsaken his eyes, and slumber his eyelids, i and after bossing about for a time he. rose I and resumed his walking. But though he slept not while he lay on the bed, he was nevertheless rested, -and his mental excitement to a great degree allayed- Now he began to consider his situation dis- passionately, and in the course of his reflec- tions his mind reverted to the brick that t gave way under his foot, and he turned and t made an instant examination. To his surprise he found it loose, and capable of removal with his hands. The dirt beneath was soft, and of a character that could be eazily dis- placed. After this discovery he began to entertain thoughts of escape, and he carefully replaced the brick, and anxiously waited the approach of night. At length the jailor came with his supper, and for the-first time he eat heartily. After the departure of the prison officer, he removed the brick, and found upon examina- tion that the walls of his prison were built upon the surface.  Encouraged by this additional discovery, he set to work with all his might, scooping up the dirt with his hands, - and spreading it carefully between the blankets of his bed to avoid detection. In the course of an, hour he had removed- a large quantity of earth with no other aid than his hands, but it was such as had been placed thereto raise the floor to a desirable height. Beneath this was the natural ground, which his fingers were powerless to-remove. Again hle suspended his labor and resum. ed his walkings, and again his foot ac-cident- ally discovered the means for carrying on his secret labor.' As he walked across the floor, his foot struck against a: broken bayonets which had beer;.stuck in the floor for a can- dlestick. Seizing this instrument, which' was destined to perform a third service, he return- ed to his labor.           . The ground was hard, and it was with much difficulty he could penetrate the surface. [A few inches below, however, it was not so hard,. and his progress was greater in con- sequence.  Still the undertaking, with no other instrument than  a broken bayonet,  &#xD;<pb n="24-21" xml:id="VAC8064-00000011"/> was one of actual magnitude, and when mor- E ning came scarce a title of his work was ( completed.               1 But night after night he toiled, and at the 1 end of the week was near the surface of the 1 ground outside the wall. The next night was 8 fixed upon for his escapes       1 A little after dark, and just as he was about to resume his labor, which was that night to be completed, the door of his prison was op-  ened,and Lopez Pecosta entered, followed by  a couple of military officers. At first he supposed hiln come on business connected with himself or his confiscated vessel,- but one of the officers informed him otherwise. "It is not our custom," remarked the offieer to Captain Leonard, "to confine our crimin- als and prisoners of war in the same dung- eon ; but owing to a difference of opinion be- tween the civil and military authorities touching their respeetive duties, we cannot ask the use of the city prison for the confine ment of our State prisoners, and this is the only place beside that is secure. Perhaps to- morrow we shall be able to make a different and more satisfactory arrangement." After the officers withdrew, Captain Leon- ard inquired-xof- P-eeo09ta-the-iaise-of his im- prisonment. "I am Fernando Rodamont, who was Se- cretary of War at the time of Santa Anna's deposition, and driven with him into banish- ment, with the penalty of death affixed to my return," replied the Mexican. "In the hope that I might promote the interest of my be- loved superior, in a dress similar to that in which I effected my escape, I came among my enemies, who have penetrated my disguise, and discovered my true character, through the same medium you detected my import- ance. And here I am by my own act con- demned, to await my doom in a gloomy pris- on from which there is'no chance of escape." 'If it-was now in your power," said Cap- tain Leonard, "would you fly from the dang- er which you are threatened?" "Would I?" said Pecosta, emphatically. "There is nothing I would not undertake to - secure my liberty. Young man, do you sup- pose I desire to die. and more especially at the   stake or on the gibet? No, no; life is pre. cious even to the aged, and especially when they have children dependant upon them for protection and subsistance. - But show me the way to escape, and the eagle is not more swift in his course than I shall be in my- flight." Captain Leonard replied that there was a way already opened, and proceeded to dis- close the result of the efforts made for his own delivery. Pecosta, getting down in the hole, carefully surveyed the work with- his hands, it being darlr as before observed. That a very slight pressure from beneath would break the- surface, and open a way for their escape was sufficiently evident, but the Mexican believed the undertaking attended with great danger, as there would be nothing after tho surface was broken, to support the wall This was a probable consequence Cap- tain Leonard feared in the beginning, but within the prison there was no means of pre- vention. The effort was certainly attended with danger, but it -had to be risked, and if need be, encountered. All these things were duly considered, and it was at length resolv- ed to make th4 effort and abide the conse- quences. CHAPTER VIII. It was agreed that Certain Leonard, being young and strong, should break the surface, and that Pecosta- should follow if the wall stood, and escape through the breach if it fell, without reference to the condition of his fellow prisoner. It was not without difficul- ty, however, that the latter could be persuad- ed to adopt this course, in casetheir fears were realized; but at length Captain Leon- ard made it appear sod evidently to his ad- vantage, by the appropriate mention of his daughter, that he reluctantly consented. Then the American took a blanket from the prison pallet, and spreading it over his head and shoulders, to keep thedirt out of his ears and clothes, stepped down into the hole he had dug-, passed under the wall, placed his broad shoulders against the earth, and forced himself through the surface. e i It was on the south side of the prison, next   at the moment of Pecosta's announcement,he was speaking of the Americans, and repre- senting them as a-imillutiVe and effeminate people, from whom they had nothing to fear but ihe loss of their property. ^Prisoner" said the general, "to what count- ry do you belong," "I am a citizen of the Re- public of theUnited States," replied Captain Leonard. This morning you called yourself a citi- zen of Buenos Ayres?" said the general. "I did," returned the prisoner, "but it was to avoid difficutly. I am a native of Ohio, and a citizen of Cincinnati." "What is the name of your principal ho- tel?" inquired the general quickly, perciev- ng from this answer that he could judge of his truth in other things by his replies to interogatories requiring local information. "When I was last in Cincinnati." replied Captain Leonard "it was Broadway." "Where is it situated?" continued Arista. You wish to test my veracity" replied said the Captain, "for you are well acquainted with its location, it being the hotel at which you and Major Isadore put up during your stay in that city." "From whom did you learn these facts?" asked the general. They came to my knowledge during boy- hood," replied the prisoner, 'and in that way which is most likely to leave an impression. A distinguished leader of the forces of the great republic of Mexico, an exile in a strange country and in the midst of stran- gers, soon obtained a notoriety that excited the curiosity of the universal Yankee nation.  As one of that people, though at the time a schoolboy,I felt a desire to look upon a man who was accounted worth to suffer for the cause of his country, bd so ventured to the Broadway Hotel, when I wasr introduced in- ] to your presence, not as on this occasion, but 1 with unshackled hands." The allusion to scenes and sufferings so l long past, but in which he had acted so i prominent a part and endured so much after- l wards, touched a tender spot in the general's heart and melted it to tears.      (   "Unbind the prisoner," said he, as soon as he could master his emotion. The officer of the night, to whom these words were addressed, immediately stepped forward and severed the bonds that bound his hantds. A chair was brought for him to Fit upon, :nd a basin of water to reduce the swellg a occasioned by the thongs. After a little while spent in silence, Arista addressing the officer of the night, gave some directions touching the arrest of Alphonso Martella. -He also directed that a party of thirty men should be detailed, forthwith, to ao in search of fodamont, who was supposed to be somewhere within the disputed terri- tory. Admirning to one of the officers with whom he had been conversing, he added,' Captain Costo, I will entrust you with this expedi- tion, and have you in all things thereto per- taining, to-follow the dictates of your own judgment. You may depart to-night, or wait till morning, as you prefer." He next addressed the prisoner, inquiring in what country he had learned to talk the Spanish language. "For nearly eighteen years," replied Cap, tain Leonard, "I have followed a sea-faring life; half of that-time I have commanded a vessel, and traded along the coast of South America; and the greater portion of the last mentioned period I have talked no other lan- guage." "Then how is it that I find you in this unpleasant situation?" asked the general, "A  few months ago I carried a cfrgo of cattle-pelts from Buenos Ayres to New Or- leans," replied Captain Leonard, " and while here was solicited by  General Hunt, the quartermaster at that p!aee, to take a ship load of bread to the army of occupation at Corpus Christi. Since then, until made a prisoner by-Captain Peron, I have been in the employ of my government.' "I suppose yur attachment for your na- tive country is -not very strong,"- said Aiista, interrogatively, a since you have been con- tented to spend so many years abroad?" "The people of America,"' replied the pris- oner, " not unfrequently go to other countries   &#xD;<pb n="22-19" xml:id="VAC8064-00000012"/> to engage in business, and when they have f^ amassed fortunes, return to the land of their of nativity to enjoy them.  Sometimes they th choose another country for their home, and live and die in the land of their adoption.- w But everywhere, and under all circumstances, ol whatever may be their business and wherever si their homes, they have no country but Amer- ti lCa."                   01 The general pursued the subject nofurther, w but simpl 'added, "I regret, sir, that it is h my duty TO imprison 'oue who-has sympa- a thized with me in My troubles and sufferings; but through one of those unfortunate circum- ff stances that constantly befall: the citizens of c nations at strife with each other, you. are p now a prisoner of war, and prudence requires m that you should be deprived of your' 'iberty. f You will find your prison by no means so c pleasant as the cabin of the Flying Cloud, t but it is the best we can afford,yon for the present. I trust it may not be long neces- I sary to keep you thus constrained. Captain ^ Costa will conduct you to your quarters." i CHAPTER VII. The prison in which Captain Leonard was I confined, was a small dark room, the further- most from the plaza-- situated in a back con- tinuation of the building above mentioned. The entire edifice, including all the floors of the lower story, was made of brick. There was no window in the prison, except a-small aperture near the ceiling, about the-size of a man's hand. Through this, at mid-day, scarce enough. of light penetrated to enable the cap- tain to see the walls of his prison. In one corner stood a truckle-bed, arid by its side a chair, and near at hand an earthen jar filled with water. WThis," said Captain Costa, "is your home for the presentr A better will be pro- vided for you as -soon as a room can be pre- pared-perhaps on to-morrow. , Please ex- tinguish the light when ydft retire. I wish, sir,-that you may have dreams pleasanter than your prison is' likely to inspire. Good night e" "Good night," returned Captain Leonard, with emotion, partly occasioned by his mis-   f rtune, and partly by the, kindness of the officer, who immediately retired and locked the door on the outside. For the space of an hour Captain Leonard walked backward and forward across the floor of }ns cell, meditating upon his unfortunate situation, and striving to conjecture the des- tiny of his little schooner. But at the end of this time he had only gained exhaustion, which perhaps enabled him sooner to forget his sorrows in, the profound repose of youth and innocence. The -exf day the jailor brought his break- fast about eight o'cloc'k. It consisted of a cup of coffee, a beefsteak, and cakes ofmaize, prepared without sifting. and mixed - with water. He drank the coffee, but found it?im; possible to swallow a mouthful of the bread or meat; not because they were unfit for diet but for want of an appetite. At noon the jailor came again, and then he managed to eat a little, but his Appetite was small and easily satisfied. And again in the evening he took a few bites, and drank another cup of coffee. And thus passed the first day of his imprisonment. All day long he had expected a visit from some person authorized to conduct him to the better quarters promised, but the #day passed and no one entered his cell but the jailor, who made no allusion to the matter, f but served him in silence. At first he sup- a posed the apartment to be fitted for his ac- I commodation was not made ready for want of time, perhaps, but he finally concluded, ewhen no one came near during the day, that 1 the promises of the general-in-chief were all e hollow, and he threw himself upon his bed ain a state of despair. 3  The next mornin' He interrogated the jailor, who informed him that his name had r not been mentioned, to his knowledge, on the )- day previous. "The mind of the commandc- ^ ant," said he, ( is occupied with a matter of ,- more importance." ,  It appeared that on the evening previous, ,r Alphonso Martella, on, arriving at Matamo- )d ras, surrendered himself to the municipal atV thorities, to be, examined in reference to the d, death of Pedro Mitiffles. 3s-  AIshort time after, the guard detailed by   which had travelled well enough before, re- fused to move a foot, except to kick at those who tried to urgejktr forward Deeply chagrined on account of .his fail- ure, and enraged withall, Muffles turned to Pecosta, and said, "H wouldn't stop a pick- ayune to have a dozen bullet holes through your. hide for your meddlesomeness this morn- ing." "I had really hoped" .returned Pecosta, "that when you left us, we should not again be pained and troubled with your presence." "No insolence, you old devil," said Muf- -fes, menacingly, "or I'll be damnedif you'll ever see the sun set after this evening." "You can not intimidate me by your threats," replied Pecosta, "or cause me to ne- glect my duty through fear of any punish-, anent that you can inflict." "Juan," cried the lieutenant to one of his party, a large, heavy, square-built man, "pull that old ruffian off his mule, and give him a dozen with the end of your lariat." The musketeer, sinking his rowels into his horse's sides,- rushed toward the old man, who, with a'sudden jerk of his bridle reins, threw bis beast upon haunches, and thus avoided the grasp of the soldier, who designed, in passing, to drag him from. hisseat. All this while the doakey refused to go forward, and Muffles, out - of patience with the stubborn, beast, ordered his men to cut the thonag of the prisoner and mount him apon Pecosta's mule, and then cut the -ass's throat for its obstinacy. Immediately the men set to work, some at the prisoner .and others at Pecosta, and had it not been  for Martella, the orders of Lieutenant Muffles would have been speedily but not very, gently executed. He had drawn a little apart with Olinda that she might not be insulted, or- that he might be at hand to resent the insult. ,But when he saw the soldier called Juan, sieze the old man by the throat to drag him from his beast, while. -another held his arms rmshe drew the revolver Pecosta had given him, andd levelling it at Muffles breast,- cried out, "Hold vilains! the moment you unseat that man you will lose an officer." Haul him off," shouted Muffles, with an-   gry impatence, "and then serve this braggart in the same manner." s Scarcely were these words uttered, whpn Pecosta was thrown with violence to the ground. Olinda screamed,;ard flung herself from her beast to ran to her father's assis- tance. And Alphonso Martella, true to his threat, shot the lieutenant through the body, andkilled him on the spot. The musketeers, seeing their leader fall, fled upon the road to Burita, leaving Pecos- ta and his party in possession of the pris- oner. The men of Santiago, who had witnessed these, transactions with fear and trembling, -were sent to capture the mules, which in the struggile and confusion had escaped. As if ashamed of their former inactivity, or afraid of another attack, they exerted themselves to the utmost, and'in a very: little time, with the help of their lassos, reduced the frighted beasts to captivity. - The corpse was lifted from the- ground and laid across the saddle it'had occupied before the vital ffA44jun from its veins, and the beast upon which it was conveyed was given in charge of one of the attendants. - All things ready, the party resumed --its course, and reached Matamoras just as the bun was sinking behind, the, hills of Siralvo. CHAPTER VI. Very great was the excitement produced by the arrival of Pecosta and his party, who, under the direction of a guide, were conduc- ted to the head- quarters of the army. Gen- eral. Arista, who had arrived at 'Matamoras in advanceeof the main body oof the'troops, occupied a large two-storied brick building that stood upon the west side of the Plaza de Midalgo. In this house for many years be- fore Victoria became the capital. of Taaaauli- pas, the legislature of tis department used to hold their annual sessions.  'The hall, committee rooms and s'tationary deposits were above stairs, and the apartments be- low were occupied for stores and ware rooms. In the largest commilte eom, subsequent-  &#xD;<pb n="20-17" xml:id="VAC8064-00000013"/> ly the court of General Clarke while military governor of Matamoras and its dependencies, General Arista. surrounded by his officers was publishing the plan of his future opera- tions. An orderly appeared at, the door, and at a sign from the commanding officer announ- ced Lopez Pecosta, who advanced to the center of the apartment, bowed profoundly to Arista and the other officers present, and in a clear succint-manner, narrated all the inci- dents of the day, and thus concluded : "It was the order of -Captain Peron that I should report the prisoner to the comman- dant at this post; accordingly, I have brought him hither, and have him below in the grand-chamber. The remains of Lieu- tenant Mufflesaare there also.. I regret the death of this man, but my brders were imper. ative, aod the necessity unavoidable." "What name bears this stripling who has deprived us of one of the best fighting men in the armies of Mexico?" demanded Ar- ista, with a sternness of expression that clear-, ly showed his dissatisfaction. "He is, if I am correctly informed," replied, Pecosta "the son of General Martella." "Alphonso?" cried Arista. I'Hismna-me may be Alphonso," answered Pecosta, affecting ignorance. He is very young, almost beardless indeed, but brave as his grandfather whose name adorns the pa- ges of oar nation's history.' "What can a peasant know of his coun- try's history?" inquired Arista, glancing at the old man with suspicion. "I'I knew his grandfather well in his life- time," replied Pecosta "and the young man told me that his name is printed in books." "sWhere did you kno*- the great Martel- la?" continued'Arista.   -  When he'resided in Puebla, at which time he and the elder Rodambnt, with whom I lived, were fast friends," answered Pecosit. "How old are you?" demanded the gen- eral, abruptly,4do ubting the truth of his statement. "I was a boy at that time," replied,Pecos- ta." The younger .Eodamont, who was af- terwards secretary ofwar, and with whom I lived up to the time of his banishment, is about my own age."   And where is Rodamont now?" said-the questioner, eyeing the countenance of the old man. "It was -said he fled to the United States," replied -Pecosta, with a perfect control of his features. "And it was rumored on the coast a day or two since that be had - crossed the Nueces, and intended to visit Matamoras and offer his services to the Republic." "I sincerely wish he would," said Arista, with- flashing eyes. "We heed his services at this moment." There was something sinister in the ex- pression of the general's countenance as he uttered these words, and something in the tone of'his voice that made the old man think of-the gibbet. 'You live on the coast?" inquired Arista. "I reside in Santiago," replied the old man. ,What is your name?" said the general. "Lopez Pecosta," replied the disguised sec- retary. "That is all," said the officer, with a mo- tion of his hand toward the door But as the old man turned away he quickly called him by name and added, "Mr. Pecosta,' we, desire the counsel of Rodamont, and com- mision you who were formerly his servant to seek 'his 'refuge and conduct him hither. Your services will not go unrewarded." Pecosta bowed and retired. But he was scarcely beyond the threshold when he was again recalled by the general, who said, "Give the remains of Lieutenant Muffles in- to the hands of the guard, to be conveyed to his friends. 'Turn the prisoner over to the officer of the night, to be- brought hither for examination.^ In the course of a few moments, Captain Leonard was conducted into the presence of Arista. His hands were crossed-behind his back and bound with, thongs. There -was anxiety in his countenance, but his step was firm, and his bearing undaunted. The general of the Mexica'n Pirmy, said to be one of the largest men in the republic, pri- ded himself- not a little upon his dimensions; but wh ten he looked upon the 'gigantic pro- portions of the prisoner, he keenly felt his own insignificance; and more particularly, as   At first a lowering cloud gathered upon his brow, but it was quickly dispelled, and with a smile he-thaoaked the captain for his firmness, which had kept him from the com- mission of crime, but begged as a favor, that he might be permitted, with a few chosen mnen, to pursue those of the crew who had escaped. Captain Peron, hoping to conciliate, gran- ted the reqneit; after which he and Muffles had a short private conference, which resul- ted in a satisfactory understanding. The lat- ter, with his party, immediately set out upon their expedition. crossing the river in the boats of the natives, and causing their horses to swim by their sides. An hour afterwards, Pecosta accompa- nied by his daughter and four or - five of the citizens of Santiago, the latter as a guards started for"Matamoras. They were moun- ted on mules, except the prisoner,- who was seated on a donkey, with hi hands tied to- gether behind him, and his feet tied under the beast's belly. A  rope was fastened at one end to the bit of the bridle, and the. oth- er was held in the hand of one of the guards. It was about ten - o'clock when they com- menced their journey, a distanice- of some thirty miles. They proceeded up the river until they reached a point opposite Burita at which there. was a kind of ferry, where they crossed to: the Mexican side of the riv- er. In this village they  stopped. and baited their horses and dined themselves- After 'dinner they resumed their course, at a brisk trot, that they might, as Pecosta said,. reach' the city before the out-guards werei stationed for the night; b#, in reality because he feared some treachery on the part of Pedro Muffles. In this manner they were jogging along three or four miles from the  city, when a young man, .mounted on   a cosal-black Mus- tang pony, and dashing  along' at a reckless speed, as he passed by a thicket that conceaeled the road in advance: of the party,- suddeny  appeared in their midst, and ran withsuch force against th, male upon which Olinda was riding, that sheas thrown   from her seat, and but for his presence of mind and su- perior horsemanship, she  would probably 2-?   have been killed. As it was, be caught, hbr falling, and with a swing, assisted by ,the .mo- tion of his horse, raised her to his, withers, and immediately after dismounted and lifted her to the ground. The excitement occasioned by the collision was sudden and extreme, but it lasted only for a few moments.' Olinda, who was *1 first very much excited and frightened, soon rr- covered her spirits, and her father, instead of reproaching the young man for his heedless- ness, thanked him for his service. The voice of the parent caused the 'young man to lift his eyes from the beautiful face of Olinda, and notwithstunding the disguise which so effectually deceived'others, he in- stantly recognized the ex-secretary. "Rodamont!" he exclaimed, with a look" and gesture of surprise. At the sound af this name, which they had not heard pronounced for months, both father and daughter started, for the young man Was a stranger. "It was in my father's house," said the youth, observing their surprise-and hasten- ing to explain, "that You were for a month concealed to escape the emisaries of Santa Anna's successor, who were  charged - *ith your secret execuition." "Alphonso Martella!" cried -the - old man, throwing his arms -around the yonuh, and embracing him with an affection almost pa- Tental; "my dear, dear boy, are your pare6nts well?"? "They are," replid Alphonso, "and are at present in Matamoras, where they-have been living for some months past. They of- ten speak, of you, and will be rejoiced, to see yon again, even in the peasant's garb that enabled .you to elude your, prsuers." "Olinda," said. the, elder, addressing his daughter "'this is the young man of whom you have so often heard me speak. Alphon- so," he addedtqnipg to the youth, "this-is my daughter." , Martella stepped forward and took- the maiden's dainty ,little hand in his own, with such a warmth as friends manifest -who have been a long time separated; and, he ut- tered words, scarce above a whisper, that brought, the color to her -cheeks,-. still p Ikte  &#xD;<pb n="18-31" xml:id="VAC8064-00000014"/> with the fright, but pleased the ears they pen- etrated. She raised her eyes to those of the youth, and replied becomingly, at the same time thanking him for the service he bad so re- cently rendered her, and still more warmly for his kindness to her father on his way in- to banishment. Assoon as she had finished speaking, she withdrew her hand and turned away, won- dering how she could ever have loved Jose Peron, when one so much more nobIe, at least in appearance and courtesy, was her - father's intimate acquaintance and friend. Butin the fact there was nothing at all marvellous, for Captain Peron had been sev- al months with them in New Orleans, whither he had fled from punishment for his part in an insurrection against -'the government, and Olinda had seen no other of her countrymen. Through the intercession of friends, Peron- was not only forgiven but invited to return to the republic, and entrusted with an office in the army, that in future he might be in- clined to defend the government, rather than attempt an overthrow i But Olinda, though betrothed to this cap- tain of musketeers, could not refrain from an occasional glance at the young man who stood by her side engaged in conversation with her father. He was tall and slender, and very youth- ful in his appearance. His short black hair curled about his ears and the back of his head. His features were regular and hand- some, and his complexion olivaceous. He was superbly dressed in a suit of snuff- colored broad-cloth, beautifully ornamented with figures of various shapes, wrought with the soft and glossy blue black silk of Italy. His trowsers, open from the waist to the ankle, exposed a pair ofdrawers of the finest Irish linen,and white as the snows ofCanada. On his head was a drab beaver, with a'long flowing nap, and on his feet a pair of black morrocco boots. His horse, a beautiful black pony, was trigged out in a manner as gay as that of his master. Saddle and bridle were ornamented with silk and silver to the high- est possible degree, and even the clumsy   U., V vW wooden stirrups were beautified to atttactive- ness. Now those who had gone in pursuit of Olinda's mule, returned, brintging with them the frightened beast,which they had captured with difficulty. It was still very restless, but she refused to exchange it for another, confi- dent that her skill was equal to its manage- ment. Martella assisted the maiden to her seat, and was in the act of mounting his own pal- frey, when aloud shout in the rear attrac- ted his attention. Looking back, he saw a dozen men, riding with the utmost hurry and confusion, and shouting like as many de- mons. "Itis Pedro nuffles, coming to takethe prisoner with whose custody I am charged,"' said Pecosta. "What does he want with the prisoner?" inquired Alphobsb. "He wishes to make him a feast for the bloodhounds that howl at his heels," replied Pecosta. "Who is this man, and what is his crime?" continued Alphonso, alluding to Captain Leonard. "He is the cornmmander of-an American transport, whorun hisvessel into the river during last night for sheltter, and was this morning captured by Captain Peron, of Mi- nor's musketeers," answered Pecosta. "And would Lieutenant Muffles kill a prisoner of war?" asked- Alphonso, surprised. "He would have done so this morning but for my interference and Peron's authority," replied Pecosta; 'and now I fear he has fol- lowed us for the same purpose." "It must not be permitted," said Martela, courageously. "But I have no weapon' "Here is a pistol," said Pecosta, handing him one of Allen's revolvers, which he-had procured in New Orleans while a sojourner in thatcity. "You have only to .aim -and pull.  Scarcely had the youth possessed himself of the weapon, when'the pursuing party, rushinghy them like a tornado, siezed the rope attached to the bit of Captain Leonard's donkey, and endeavored to carry off the pris- oner by flight. -But the stubborn beast,   vindicate at any time and before any tribu- So saying, he took-the light which one of the servants had ;brought, and conducted -Barbata and so many of his men as were not placed on duty as sentinels, throughout the house below and above stairs; and examined all the cupboards and ward-tobes- behind the doors and under the beds-on the balcony and on the vestibule; but the fugitives were no were concealed within the edifice, nor was there any trace of their flight, until they reached the scuttle, which they found ajar. Believing they had fled for -refuge to the house-top, from which he knew of no means of escape, the captain felt confident of their recapture, and ordered his men to continue the search, and not to overlook a cranny where a mouse could be concealed. One of those who pursued a westwardly course, when he discovered that the eaves of the sloping roof rested upon the wall, concluded that the fugitives had escaped. But by order of the captain, who believed they were some- where upon the wall, from which they could not descend without assistance, he walked away to the first angle where he found a rope hanging over the wall, one end noosed to the limb of a lemon tree, while the other touched the ground, by which it wis -evident they had escaped. CHAPTER   X. With the discovery of the rope at the end of the wall, the search was discontinued, and the attention of the soldiers directed to the fate or condition of their unfortunate com- panion, whom the earth swallowed up as it did Dathan and Abiram. During -the time that had intervened, the moon had travelled from the east a long distance towards the south, and her beams lay all around the spot where the soldier had disappeared. On examination it was found, that in times past there had been a pool or cisternii, of water in this place., but that it was now. empty and andabndoned. For want of dirt, or for some other reason not so easily conjec- tuired, it was not filled up, but simply covered   over, first with planks a-.nd then with mould and formed into a flower-bed. By the maist- ure of the earth these planks had become rot- ten in several places, and while they were still strong enough to support the flowers and the s6il in which they grew, could not sus- tain the additional weight of Captain Leon- ard. First they stooped at the cavity and aeshed the soldier by name, but receiving no answer except the rumbling echo of their own voices, a rope was fdstened round the body of one of their party, who Was let down into the cistern, at the bottom of which, and directly under- neath the opening, -he was found dead, his neck being dislocated. Taking the corpse in his arms, the soldier signified his desire to ascend, and was immediately drawn up; after which Captain Barbata and: his men returned to the barracks, bearing with them the lifeless body of .their companion. It was Barbata's opinion that Captain Leonard had escaped at the same time and in the same manner as Rodamount, and that the break in the top of the cistern, had been caused by .the deceased soldier.. But the reader who is better informed, will be anxious to'know if the A merican fared ally better than the Mexican.  As remarked in the second paragraph of this chapter, the planks that covered the cistern, in consequence of their decayed con- dition, were not of sufficient strength to sup- port the weight of Captain Leonard, who in ,his attempt to follow Rodamount, -stepped upon- the corner- of the flower-bedj and was precipitated to- the'bottom of the abandoned reservoir., But- fortunately for thb-fugitive, only one, planl gave way, causing a hole barely suffi- cient for his body to slip! through; and al- though his descent was sudden, the plank -agd earth were forced- to yield,-this natural resistance preserving him from serious injury; while the Mexican was instantaneously and unresistingly precipitated to the bottom and  killed upon the spot. t  Captain, Leonard was by no means satisfied with his new situation, for beside . the. damp, unwholesome air,. And-musty odor that filled  &#xD;<pb n="32-29" xml:id="VAC8064-00000015"/> ok               -   s-iA A the receptacle, he looked to be discovered, and had neither the means of concealment -nor escape. This was his apprehension, that his pursuers seeing the chasm, would cause the cistern to be eglored; and it was increased by the misfortune of their companion, whom they would certainly seek and find at the bottom. Hoping that his disappearance had es- caped the observation of all but Rodamount, he dragged the body of the dead Mexican which had tumbled toward the center of the reservoir, back to the opening, that it might be discovered by the first who entered; and the manner in which it was subsequently dis- posed of, has been already related. After the soldiers had abandoned the search and returned-to their-quarters, Capt. .Leonard endeavored to extricate himself, but without success: for the board that yielded to his weight in a horizontal position, and by means of which he tried to reach the top of the re- servoir, did no better service as an inclined plane. It was now evident that at the bottom of this cistern he was obliged to remain until assistance was afforded by Rodamount, or, if Acs of his power, by some one he himself might attract to the breach by his cries. However, for the present he resolved not to give an alarm,lest he should- discover his lurking-place to some patrol or sentinel, but to wait until the morning, when some person belonging to the family should pass-by, to visit the broken flower-bed. Accordingly, he threw himself upon the floor of the cistern, which like the sides was smoothly plastered, and being fatigued; soon fell asleep. It was nine o'clock the next morning when he awoke, and the first sound that greeted his ear, was the musical voice of Olinda- Rodamont. For a moment he believed she was sent thither by her father, to effect his further liberation; buther words which were distinctly heard, soon convinced him of the contrary. "Let me talk of my father, of the bearded American, of this broken cistern that will hold no water, of anything on earth, A1- phonso, but lover," said the maiden earnestly.   "I know that those you have specified ore the popular themes of gossip throughout the city," replied Martella,,whose voice the pri- soner instantly recognized, " but they have no interest for me beyond JHe pleasure oc- casioned by year father's escape," "See how little Lola's flower-bed is bro- ker   said. Olinda, wishing to avert his thoughts from the subject he was endeavor- ing to introduce, "It can be mended," returned Martella, "but if you-break my heart,--Olinda, I should become a wreak." Alphonso," said the maiden, with increased earnestness, "why will you persist, when thereby both of us are rendered miserable?' "It is in your power to make us both happy;" replied Martilla, " but I fear you will not, unless you are urged." 'And will not if urged by all the friends I have on earth," returned Olinda, em- phatically. "Captain Peron is in no respect your equal," persisted Martilla, not a particle dis- couraged by her . emphatic manner; " and in a moral point of view, he is totally unworthy of one so pure in thought, and so prudent in behavior."- "It may betrue,-;lphonso"said Olinda; but it becomes me not to hear remarks ut- tered in dispraise of one to whom I am affi- anced."  "But it is your duty to consider them,"' returned the youth, "forf the happiness of a life-time is of vastly more importance than the fulfilment of a promise. Besides, Olinda, you do not love him, and no woman should wed a man she does not love." Proceed, Alphonso," said themaiden, resignedly, "ny imprudence merits your to- ture." f  "'Your imprudence, Olinda,-' exclaimed the youth; "you have never done an imprudent thing in you life." "Have not?"said the younpgjldy, "Then to confess a love for one apd he betrothed to another is not an imprudence." "Not so great a one certainly," replied Martilla, "as to love one and wed another."   ments sufficed to break the bolt, or the handle of the gate through which it was thrust, and then they came teeminginto Martilla's in- closure. During all the time occupied in the re- moval of the rubbish from the broken bed, and the examination of Mrs. Cathedra's garden, the fugitives had remained in the place and position above mentioned; but when the searchers forced their way through the postern, further concealment was im- possible. "We must now run for our lives," said Pecosta; "-for the Philistines are upon us." "Whither shall we run?" inquired Captain Leonard. "We are encompassed by walls half as high as the houses to which they are attached; besides, 'the moment we move we become visible." "Do you suppose my young friend," said the Mexican, energetically, " that by remain- ing here we shall escape discovery? I assure you there is not a foot of ground within the enclosure that will not be examined." "I do not," answered Captain Leonard. 'But I repeat, whither shall we fly?-how shall we get beyond these walls?" "To the house, and through the house," replied Pecosta, springing to his feet. "Fol- low me, quick," he added, darting off in the shadow of the wall toward the dwelling. Captain Leonard instantly obeyed: but he had not made above a dozen steps, when the surface of the ground gave way, and he disappeared from the sight of Pecosta as suddenly as he had appeared a while before to Romanno and the beautiful widow. The noise of the rupture attracted the at- tention of the soldiers, one of whom, seeing the Mexican in his fight, which he continued notwithstanding the sudden disappearance of his companion, cried out, "Rodamont," and gave immediate chase. Theothers, catching up the cry, hurried away in the same direc; tion. As they rushed forward eager in the pur- suit, and heedless of their steps, one of the foremost in the chase chanced upon the chasm, and involuntarily followed Captain Leonard into his subterranean concealment. Hiscom- panions, indifferent to his fate under the ex-   citement, held on their course, and entered the house soon after the fugitive. It was not until Pecosta was- within a few rods of the building, that he recognized the residence of General Martella; but this dis- covery inspired him with hope, and animated him to greater exertions. The lower door of the house had been opened for the egress ot the servants, one of whom stood upon the threshold, resolved to protect his master's domicil against intruders. But he had scarcely determined his .duty, when Pecouta darted past him, mounted the stairs, passed through the scuttle, and stood upon the housetop. . In Matamoras the roofs of the houses are commonly flat, and covered with square bricks such as are generally used in tropical countries for floors and pavements. On the west side of the Plaza de Hidalgo, from the residence of Mrs. Cathedra to the corner of the block, and thence westward to the corner of the cross,-street, the houses were all joined together, and a person might- pass from the roof of one to the roof of another without difficulty. Lopez Pecosta, when he reached the house- top, did not pause to survey the scene below, in which servants and soldiers were striving, the one to gain and the other to prevent; an entrance; but hurried away toward the west until he reached the-futhermbst house, to which was attached another running badk, with a sloping roof, the eaves of which at-one end touched the wall. Down this roof he hastened, and then along the wall to the ex- tremity, when he disappeared. By this time Alphonso Martella, by his presence and authority, had  quelled the strife between his father's domestics and the repulsed soldiers, and then'the following con- versation enslied.  "What means all-this confusion?" said the young Mgan to one of the soldiers. X "We are in pnrsuit of old Rodamount, who has escaped from prison and sought re- fuge in this house," replied the man addeas- edl         -    -  P"He is not in this house nor-about these premises," replied Alphonso.  "Between  &#xD;<pb n="30-27" xml:id="VAC8064-00000016"/> this garden and the prison yard there is no communication." "But there is between this garden and Mrs. Oathedra's," returned the soldier. "Yes, but none between hers and the prison yard," returned the youth. "It was by undermining the wall that they escaped, and it is the side next her dwelling thai has tumbled down," said the examiner, with impatience. "Who beside Rodamount?" inquired Al- phonso. "The American." answered the pursuer. "And where is he?" continued the youth. "With his traitorous companion," replied the seeker, with inceased impatience. "They are not in this house," said Martilla. "It is only a few moments since the door was opened, and no person has been admitted. " "It is false,"' said the soldier. "I saw him enter but now, and our orders are to retake him." "To whom do you allude," inquired the youth, "to Rodamont or the American." "Stand back," said the pursuer, angrily, "'yquhave impeded our progress long enough." "Yow cannot enter here without an of- ficer," said Alphonso, firmly. "I am a sergeant of infantry, and leader of this party of searchers; so give -way or take the consequences," returned the soldier, with determination, bringing his musket to a charge. "Advance at your peril," returned Martel- a, pointing at his breast the revolver Pe- costa had given him to defend the American prisoner against the attack of muskets. "Will you kill me as you did Lieutenant Muffles?" demabded the sergeant. "Yes," replied Martella, firmly, "ifyou at, tempt to force your way in this dwelling." "Our orders are to recapture the prisoner, and they have taken refuge in this' house, returned the soldier; "and how are we to execute our. orders if we are denied admit- taace?-' "i&amp;The door is open to any commissioned officer of the army with as many soldiers as may choose to accompany him," said A1- phonso.   * fa . C 3 Captain Barbata, who cared less at that moment for the capture of Rodamount than the disgrace of General Martella, heard the greater portion -of the dialogue, standing be- hind a rose-bush a few paces from the door. And at this point in the conversation he ad- vanced, and inquired angrily of the sergeant why he had not obeyed his orders. "Because," replied the soldier, "we were refused admittance. The servants first oppos- ed our entrance, and when we had overpower- ed them without blood-shedding, Mr. Martel- la camne with the weapon you sPe in his hands with whichhe killed Lieutenafit Muffles, and threatened to serve the firs tho advanced in like manner."  "Mr. Martella," said the officer of the night, "I must search this house in which it is supposed Ernando Rodamont has taken refuge. But so much time has been con- sumed in parleying, that I scarcely expect to find him here; nevertheless,-as he was seen to enter at this door, I should be remiss in my duty if I did not make an examination.' "If the venerable Rodamont is in this house, it is without my knowledge," said Alphonso. "But you are at liberty to search and had you accompanied these soldiers they would not have been refused admittace." "'If you offer the want of an officer as an excuse for your conduct,'"returned Barbata, "tI must inform you that it is insufficient. When soldiers are at the heels of a fugitive who seeks shelter in another man's dwellings the owner may not with impunity deny their admittance, unless he ejects the runaway. Your conduct, therefore, is not only inexcu- sable, but highly criminal, as you have assis- ted a traitor in his fliglit from merited con- demnation and punishment. If you were not at liberty on parole, I would have you in- stantly arrested; as it is,- I shall reportg you to the general in chief." "With reference to this matter," replied Martilla, with an air of defiance, "I wish-you to pursue whatever course you regard as your duty: it is the principle upon which I have acted in this as well as in graver matters. My present behavior I am able and ready to , . '       f e   famrnish them with a key to maske it secure. or leave it open for the passage of ma- rauders.  "Then how can a stranger gain admittance to her dwelling?" inquired Captain Leonard. "He may knock at the front door the same as if the garrison was not there," replied Pe- costa, "and if he is a-person who ought to be admitted, which may be determined from the balcony, he will'be invited to pass round to the wicket, at which a servant will be found ready to conduct him to his mistress. These things are not uncommon in Mexican cities that are garrisoned." "What shall we do next?" asked Captain Leonard. "Remain quiet," quickly replied Pecosta, "until the persons I hear talking without shall have passed." '6They have stopped at the gate," 7said Cap- tain Leonard; "they-are about to enter." "Follow met' said Pecosta, darting from the wall, and dflying with the speed of a young man to the opposite side of the enclosure. Captain Leonard did as directed, though he found it no very easy undertaking, so quick was the start and so rapid the flight of the Mexican. When they reached the opposite wall, A continuation of the prison from which they had just escaped, they threw themselves upon the ground in the shadow of an orange tree, at the same time to avoid detection and make observations.' Presently, the wicket from which they had just fled, was thrown open, and several per- sons entered, and having closed it again, pro- ceeded toward the spot where Captaih Leo- nard appeared, issuing from the. ground to Mrs. Cathedra and her suitor. "We must not remain here," said Pe- costa; " for the moment our escape is dis- covered, the garrison will be alarmed, and patrols sent out in every direction; and there is not a tree or bush, a nook or corner, in the whole enclosure, that will escape examni- nation.'" "Whither shall we go, and what do?" in- , quired Captain-Leonard. "We must force the wicket next 'the I    house," replied the Mexican." "The lock may be broken, possibly, with the heel of a boot. I see no other chance." "But how shall we get there?" said Cap- tain Leonard. "Between us and it there are a hundred yards of space,?and every one is filled with the rays of the moon." We must glide from tree to tree, and from bush to bush, until we reach the opposite wall," answered Pecosta. It is not the-first time I have thus escaped." ' As he finished speaking, he darted from the - side of his companion, and like a streak of light, so quick was the movement, passed to the shadow of a pommegranate bush. Captain Leonard was preparing to follow, when his eye accidentally fell upon a postern partially concealed by the shadow of the tre- under which he was standing. Therefore instead of following Pecosta, as was his in- tention a moment previous, he turned to and examined the gate, which, to his surprise, was fastened only with a latch. Of this fact he immediately informed Pecosta, who re- turned to the shadow of the orange-tree, with a celerity that showed his eagerness to escape  from the enclosure. In the space of another minute the fugi- tives had passed the wicket, which they closed after them, and fastened by drawing a stick through the handle of the latch. They were now. in the enclosure of General Martilla, whose wife and Mrs. Cathedra were very intimate, and kept up a daily intercourse by means of this postern; but these facts were unknown top them until afterward. CHAPTER IX. The fugitives, -after a brief consultation touching theirfuture movements, proceeced to explore the wall of the enclosure which they had just entered; .but, save the-wicket through which they escaped, they found no " opening on the south side, nor on the east as far as the prison bounds extended. A4t this point they paused again to consider ,teir further progress; but in the midst of their deliberations, they were startled by a deafen- ing, crash that not onlylarmed the gearriden,  &#xD;<pb n="28-25" xml:id="VAC8064-00000017"/> but a considerable portion of the city, and produced a general consternation. It was afterwards made to appear, that one of the examining party in the adjoining enclosure, seeing the pendant brick which the clothes of Pecosta had partially displaced, thoughtlessly struek it with the end of his baton, and forced it from its fastenings. As before observed, this brick was the key to the whole arch, and when it fell there was nothing to support the wall and roof, both of which came tumbling down with a fearful noise, and completely crushed and covered the prisoners bed beneath the ruins. When the astonishment had in a measure subsided, orders were given to remove the rubbish and extricate the prisoners, who were supposed to be underneath. A party of soldiers were immediately set to work, who, after half an hour's vigorous labor, reached the bedrs which they found broken down, but unoccupied. Up to this time the story of Mrs. Cathe- dra's lover had received but little attention, and even now it was not fully credited. That the prisoners had escaped by a subterranean passage was obvious upon examination; but the opinion obtained generally that they had received assistance. As Valasquez Romanno, the lver above mentioned, was the only person present who had witnessed the prisoner's eruption, and as the story itself was highly improbable in the opinion of the officer of the night, he fell under instant suspicion, which whas mani- fested at the moment rather by significant looks and nods than by words, for he was a merchant of the city, a maiin of great wealth and influence, and almost universally re- spected. But wh en these facts were reported to Arista, he ordered the merrchant to be imme- diately arrested, and kept in confinement sub- jectto his farther orders. But Captain Bar- bata, who was a personal friend of Romanno, after his arrest being charged with his cus- tody, released him on his parole, believing, notwithstanriding Arista's suspicion, that his innocence would be clearly, and if certain in- formation should prove to be correct, per- haps easily established.   , v^ W ,v Meanwhile the fugitives lay close to the ground in the shadow of the east wall, for the inmates of the dwelling, alarmed by the crash, had gathered together upon the vestibule and the slightest movement could not have escaped their observation. Captain Barbata, who, as before observed, believed the story of his friend, concluded that the fugitives, the wicket having been properly secured, were somewhere concealed within Mrs. Cathedra's garden. Acting upon this belief, a company of searchers were formed, to make an examina- tion; but after the- lapse of half an hour, the garden having been thoroughly scrutinized, an inspection of the wall was ordered, and the postern through which the prisoners es- caped discovered.  As the gate was barred on the other side, Romanno was dispatched to inquire of Mrs. Cathedra concerning the communication. - In a few moments he returned with information to the effect, that-the wicket opened into her garden from General Martella's, and that it had never been fastened, other than with a latch, since the General's family came to re- side in Matamoras. This intelligence increased a suspicion al- ready existing in the minds of Captain Bar- bata and others present, that the former friendship of Martella and Rodamont, had in- duced the former to procure the latter's libe- ration.- It was well known that in all the army, Santa Anna had not so devoted and fearless a friend as the General nor any where so able and truthful a counsellor as the ex- secretary; and these facts were the ground of suspicion. On receding this information, Captain Barbata, who was a secret enemy of General Martella, ordered the examiners to stave the postern, and search his premises, and if neces- sary, not to spare his lady's bedroom. The last clause of this sentence was a sort of gene- ral license to do whatever in clinationprompt- ed, and was made that the soldiers might give the family all possible annoyance. No sooner were the orders pronounced, than they set to work to carry it into effect, with an: energy that clearly showed in what sense it was understood. A very few mc-   to theresidenceof Irsd. Cathedra, a widow of great wealth and beauty, who had many ad- minirers and not a few-suitors, although she filled the alliterative phrase, "fat, fair, and forty," except -that her complexion was de- cidedly olive. Now, it so happened that at the moment Captain Leonard passed up through the earth like Samuel at the bidding ofEndor's withch, the beautiful widow was standing at the door of her house, within a few feet of the pris- on wall, talking to one of her lovers who was about to take his departure. The beams of the moon were exceedingly brilliant, and the wall of the prison was cov- ' ered with their light, though the widow and her lover stood within the shadow of her dwelling. The widow, whose face was turned toward the wall at the moment of the disrupture of the earth and sadden appearence of a creature whom she thought the prince ofPandemonium shrieked and fled into the bouse, leaving her lover to divine, as best he could, the cause of her singular behaviour. - The noise of the breach attracting his at- tention, he turned about just at the moment 'Captain Leonard remol the blanket from his head, and seeing a {an half-way protrud- ed through the earth, with a long beard sweeping his breast, mistook him for the spir- it of Samuel himself, and was scarcely less frightened than the widow, and fled with as much precipitation.  Half a dozen of the lower-bricks, fell-from their places, and that part of the wall imme- diately above the Subterranean passage, sunk several inches; but the pressure from each side prevented a general crash.  But the aperture was so much diminished by the wall's depression, that it became nec- essary to remove a couple of bricks before Pecosta could force his body through. "Captain Leonard," said he, speaking through the passage, "the removal ofa single brick will cause the entire wall to crumble down ; the noise will rouse the garrison, and we shall be recaptured before we are fairly free. Make rise of your liberty, and leave me to my fate."   i, ' NoQ," returned Captain 'Leonard, "I will not forsake a fellow prisoner."  "But there can be no sympathy. between us as such as other criminals,feel for each other, ' said Pecosta, "for you are a prisoner of war, and I a prisoner of the law ; you are confined to deprive your country of your services, but I by legal arrest, to suffer for a crime."' "True," replied Captain Leonard, " we have not the emotions of criminals, for we have not sinned like them, bdu there is the sympathy which one human being feels for another in distress and that is enough to jus- tify my further assistance." "But there is no law of our nature stronger than self-preservation," said Pecosta, "and not even gratitude requires the sacrifice of one man's life to save another's." "A man may take another's life to save his own, and by the -law be justified," re- turnead Captain Leonard, because there is nothing dearer to a man than his life, and  such an act is human. And a man may if he chose, give his life for another's and none should condemn the sacrifice, for the deed is divine, at least so far as emulation extends, Christ having died for a sinful world." "But if you remain here," said -the 1SMexi- can, "both may be lost; whereas, if you fly at once, one may escape. I will wait a few minutes, until I ithink you have got beyond the wall that encloses the garden, before I attempt to enlarge the aperture."  -"I will not go," said Captain Leonard, firmly. :"It shall never be said, that I aban- doned a fellow prisoner.- It is enough that we have occupied, though for an hour only, the same dungeon cell." "You Americans are a ,singular peopled" said Pecosta.  "But a, few mornings since, you seized me- by .the throat, dashed me to the earth, called me liar and scoundrel, and now   you hazard your life to save, mine. But we consume time unnecessarily by our conversation; if you are determined to risk so much, better that it be done bofore -we are discovered."           .  ' "It was in the heat of passion," said Cap- tain - Leonard, "and under the impression that you had dispatched your- daughter for  &#xD;<pb n="26-33" xml:id="VAC8064-00000018"/> the musketeers, that I inflicted the injury to which you have alluded."- "I did, I did," replied the- Mexican, with- energy, and in a tone of self-condemnation. "I deserved to be throttled to be thrust down-to be spurned; for I deceived you and betrayed you, and have brought jou into this difficulty. Go, young man, I am not deserving of your sympathy." "Stand from under," was Captain Leon- -ard's reply, " and I will endeavor to enlarge the opening?" "Yes," replied Pecosta, stepping out of the hole, and moving ad couple of paces toward the- center of the room. But on examilation it was found impos- sible to remove another brick, without pro- ducing the crash of which they were appre- hensive. To increase the passage by the removal of more dirt, was the alternative. Accordingly, the broken bayonet was again employed in a labor for which it was never intended. They had to work cautiously, lest the wall, for want of its foundation, should tumble down and crush them beneath its ruins. But at the end of thirty minutes their labor was suspended and the passage undertaken. With the help of Captain Leonard, the prisoner was drawn through the opening, which was still too small for his escape un- assisted. Indeed, one of the- bricks, which served to hold up the rest, as the key-stone of-an arch supports the structure, was forced by his clothes, which caught upon its corner, full half its width from the place it had oc- cupied. "Follow me," said Pecosta, as shon as he had regained his feet; and he walked quickly toward Mrs. Cathedra's house, in the shadow of which he paused until joined by Captain ; Leonard.  "We must proceed with great caution," continued Pecosta, when the other reached his side, 'for there is a sentinel on yonder house top, Sand he is looking in this direce tion." "But with all consistent dispatch," said Captain Leonard, "for my up-rising from the earth was observed by- at least two wit-   nesses," whose respective flights he described in the fewest possible words. "I shall not soon forget the risk you have run and the aid you have rendered in secur- ing to me my liberty," said Pecosta; "but as you suggested, dispatch as well as caution is necessary to insure our escape." "But whither shall we fly?" inquired Cap- tain Leonard;" or, rather, how shall we es- cape? for we are surrounded by a wall." 1'We must find the aperture through which Mrs. Cathedra's visitor made hisexit,"replied the Mexican; "it will let us into the street, and after that we--shal! have no difficulty." "He fled in this direction," said Captain Leonard, pointing toward the rear of the enclosure. "But we must hug the wall to escape ob- servation," returned Pecosta. "Very true," said Captain Leonard, "Iead the way I will follow." "Softly then," said the Mexican, moving  forward in the shadow of the wall, closely followed by Captain Leonard. In a few moments they reached the angle and turned toward the back end of the let They had not proceeeded far when they Came to a wicket but it was closed and fastened, and from its appearance had not been opened for a length of time, the padlock with which it was secured having become rusty. A very slight stroke might have broken the staple, but there was nothing at hand with which to give the blow; besides the noise might have led to their discovery, and so they passed on in quest of the passage through which the lover had escaped. Near the next angle there was another. wicket, and from its appearance, one was in daily use,- bit it, like the oth&amp;r, was barred and locked. - "We have not' et found the place of Mr. Lover's, egression," said Captain Leonard, seeing that the gate was fastened. "Not unless he has a key," returned Pe- costa. "As the garrison occupy the adjoin- ing lot, Mrs. Cartledra may prefer to receive her friends though the back entrance, to avoid observation and intrusion and as, she cannot accompany them to the wicket, must 1 \    "Leave me, Alphonso, leave me," cried Olinda; 'PI can bear no more." "I will leave you, dear, if it is your wish," replied the youth, "but not here by the side of this frightful chasm, so suggestive of death.' "Do you fear that FIshall destroy my life,', asked the maiden. "But you need not, it is not yet so great a burden. I prefer to rc- main by these wilting flowers." "I go, then," said Alphonso; "but I carry hope in my heart." With these words he turned away, and walked slowly toward the mansion, leaving Olinda by the broken flower bed. "There was a time -when Captain-Peron was as dear to me as life," soliloquized the maiden,--a time when I regarded him as ar model man: but I have changpd my opinion -and my heart has also experienced a change." - After these words, her thoughts for a time were unspoken; at length she walked close to edge of the opening, and remarked, "How aptly did he style this a frightful chasm!- how truly did he say it is suggestive of death! --and how easy it would be here to end my trouble! A plunge, a collision, a quiver, and then all would be over." As shp spoke, she looked steadfastly down iato the deep receptacle, for a moment; then raised her eyes to heaven, and implored for- giveness for the self-sacrifice she was about to offer upon the altar of disappointed love. After which her head dropped updn her breast, and she shuddered like one in the agony of the death-struggle. But as she closed her eyes to take the fatal plunge, these warning words, uttered in a melancholy voice, and coming up from the depths of the cavern, fell upon her ear, as the  voice of the angel did on Abraham's, Olinda beware!" Thus the deed of self-destruction was ar- r rested in the conception, for the -maiden j started from her position, and would have ] fled frightened, to the house, had not the voice called to her in a tone of entreaty that C toubched her heart.  -"Maiden of sorrow, be not frightened, the as voice you hear is mortal."  3   'CWho speaks from the bottom of this deep cavern?" demanded the maiden, assuming courage., "One who entered unwillingly, but would willingly depart," answered the voice. "Give me your namer" said the maiden. "Stephen Leonard," replied the voice. "My -father's deliverer! exclaimed the maiden. Then followed an explanation of the cir- cumstances connected with his involuntary descent into the earth the night previous; ap ter which the maiden published the contents of a letter received from her father, who in. quired his fellow prisoner's fate, and express- ed his wonder and regret that he had not fol- lowed him in his flight. Having made this communication, and s- tisfied the curiosity of the captive, she assured him he was not yet out of danger, for that the search was still continued, in diF ferent parts of the city and on both sid, a of the river, and that he was safer in his present hiding-place than he could be perhaps any where else on the soil of Mexico, at least until evening, when she would have him liberated and conducted to the Texas side of tlhe Rio Grande. This done, she went to the house, and pre- sently returned with some   refreshments which she let-down to him by means of a rope and basket. Alphonso, on leaving the maiden, selected a position on the vestibule, from which he could observe her movements, for he had a presentiment that she proposed the commisott of suicide. With apphenssion he witnessed her sin- gular behavior immediately after their sepa- ration, and was about to cry out when she- started back at the sound of Capt. Leonard's voice. When she returned to the ehasm bearing refreshments concealed beneath her robes, be continued. to note her actions, but with 1es apprehension than curiosity On her return to the house, he said to one of the servants in her presence, 'you must go and procure some materials and cover yo* cistern before it becomes dark, or some one will fall into itand be injured or #Ied."  &#xD;<pb n="34-35" xml:id="VAC8064-00000019"/> "Alphonso," said the maiden, quickly, "I beg of you to leave it until to-morrow, that I may note the effect of the sun on certain flowers that have been uprooted." Tlins was intended for the ears of the ser- vant, but was so artlessly uttered that Al- phonso was also deceived. But she after- wards called him aside and acquainted him with her discovery. Mortilla, whatever course he may have been disposed to pursue under other circum- -stances, at the request of the young lady whose father had been saved though the haz- ardos-land self-sacrificingt exertions of Cap- tain Leonard, promised to render all the assistance in his power to have him safely conducted into Texas. And in accordance with this promise, as soon as it was night, he procured competent aid, and delivered the underground prisoner from his singular but fortunate confinement. CH:APTER XI. Under the guidance of a young man select- ed for -his courage and trust-worthiness, Captain Leonard started upon his perilous journey immediately after his deliverance. The moon was above the horizon, and shin- ing as brightly as it had ever donmin Mexico. There was not a cloud to obscure its beams, not a mist to dim it rays. Earth, air and sky were illuminated. Guide and fugitive, side by side, and in the 'shadow of the houses, left the mansion of Martilla, and started toward the river. -But the streets of Matamoras were at that time partrolled from dark to day-light, and several times on their way they were challenged, questioned, and permitted to proceed. / They met with no serious opposition, how- ever, until they had passed beyond the city / proper and entered the suburbs, where they were againchallenged, and being exposed to the moon'slight, Captain Leonard was recog- nized and immediately arrested. But the guide, taking advantage of the surprise and joy of the patrol, slipped away unobserved, and effected ht  e. Captain Leonard wad placed between two soldiers, having loaded muskets with the   M, INV L , bayonets fixed, who were ordered to convey him safely to the quarters of the commands- ant. The patrol, except the two detailed to conduct the prisoner, continued on their course; and these set about to execute their orders. That there might be no possibility of escape, they walked so close the prisoner that. his and their elbows touched.   And in this manner they proceeded until the patrol was out of sight and hearing, when Captain Leonard, striking each guard across the throat at thesame moment and throwing the weight of his own body backward, assisted by the strength of his arms, hurled them both to the ground and fled. By this action one of them was stunned to insensibility, but the other, who was consid- ably injured by the fall, discharged his mus- ket, and summoned the patrol to their assis - ance. Meanwhile the fugitive had reached the river and taken possession of the boat, having  first knocked down the ferryman, who offered some resistance. But the patrol immediately gave chase, and where at the bank of the river before the fugitive was half-way across Thei vessel was a flat-boat of considerable size, indiscriminately used to carry men, horses, cattle, and luggage of all descrptions. A rope was stretched across the river, and the boat was propelled by the hands. As was just remarked, the fugitive was half-way across the river when the partrol arrived, and in a few minutes more but for their interference, would have been in Texas. After shooting at him several times without effect, one of them drew a knife from his boot and cut the rope. Immediately the boat turned, and by the current was carried swiftly down the stream. Captain Leonard held furiously to the rope, and endeavored-to bring the vessel to the shore but the force it had accumulated in one di- rection, when turned in another assisted by the strength of the current, was more than he could overcome.  But a moment after -he rejoiced at his failure, as the boat afforded a' more speedy, and certain deliverance from his pursuers. i All that night he continued to descend the - A   river,and the next day until nearly noon, when, observing a couple of boats in pur- suit, he jumped into-the river and swam ashore. H is pursuers immediately rowed their boats to the bank, and gave chase among the chap- aral. The prisoner was swift olf foot, and having a long start, soon left them behind and out of sight. But escaping from one danger he ran directly into another. Captain Costa,whom Arista had dispatched in searchof Hernando Rodamount, havingo scoured the country between the Rio Grande and the Nueces, for fifty miles from the coast, was on his return to the city. He was en- camped to rest ard refresh his horses during the heat of the day, and was doncealed be- neath a clump of Mosqueet trees, which Cap- tain Leonard endeavored to place between himself and pursuers. This brought him completely within the power of the searching party, who made him a prisoner, and reconducted him to Matamo- ras, where he was confined in the city prison. The question between the civic and milit- ary authorities, touching the arrest and trial of AlphonsoMartella, which had been referred to the President for decision, was not yet set- tled, and a  new difficulty arose out of the capture of (Captain Leonard. The prefect of the city refused to receive the prisoner or be accountable for his securi- ty, unless the general would resign Martella into the hands of the municipal authorities'; and Arista, inflamed on account of his arro- gance, threatened to place the city under martial law,and take forcible possession of the prison. At this juncture General Martella arrived in the city, and proposed that his son should be submitted for an examination before both authorities, and be judged by the 4aws of each; and that as the military, exceptnnder the most critical circumstances, ought to be 5 subservient to the civil powers, the first ex- amination should be made by the authorities  to whom the supposed offender had-surren- dered himself.  As this could be done independent ofthe ] abstraction submitted for the decision of l President Herrera; the proposition was at   ' once adopted, and the young man, after a great deal of verbiage and speculation was honorable aquitted, on the grounds of justifi- cation and self-de n  oth tribunals. Thle adjustment of this difference removed the difficulty in reference to Captain Leon- ard's imprisonment, and he was thrust like Paul into the inner dungeon, after being sev- erely scourged by order of Captain Barbata, who was that day the officer in charge of the post, Sandoval Ambrosia, a humane man, and one of the Alcaldes of the city, being in- formed of this barbarous treatment, first com- plained of it to Arista, and then visited the prisoner, whom he ordered to be brought forth into the light prison, when he had his back an- nointed, and a bed brought for his repose. He afterwards sent him some palatable refresh- ments, and did many other little things for his "pnfort, The next day General Martella's division entered the city, and encamped on the Old Plaza, and the day following the Tampico Guards and Le Vega's Artillery arrived. Ard on the third, which was the seventh before the battle of Palo Alto, all the troops at Mta- tamoras, to the number of about eight thous- and, were marshalled in the Plaza de Hidal- go, to be reviewed by the general-in-chief. On   this occasi General Arista again spoke of the American soldiery, but not in the same contemptuous terms used on -the eve- ning of the day of Captain Leonard's arrest. Now he carried his description to the other  extreme, and represented them as a gigantic people, with long beards, strong arms, brave spirits, and cruel hearts; in short, as barbar- ians, who killed, ravaged and consumed from a mere love of destruction. That his words might have the greater weight, it was arranged to exhibit Captain Leonard after the conclusion of the harangue, and Captain Barbata was charged with the custody of the prisoner during the exhibition bo, when the troops began to enter the Pla- za, this officer went to the prison room in which the captive was confined, -to inform him ofthe General'8 intention, and prepare him for the occasion. On entering the prison, he inquired of Cap.  &#xD;<pb n="36-37" xml:id="VAC8064-00000020"/> tain Leonard if he was ready to die, adding that in Mexico, if a prisoner, in an effort to l escape, caused directly or indirectly the death  of another person, he was accounted a mur- derer, and was punished accordingly.   X Captain Leonard replied that he was in their power, and however unjust his condem- 1 nation and punishment, he had not the power to prevent their execution. He then reques- ted a pen and paper thas he might indite a letter to Genelral Taylor. At the mention of this name the officer smiled, and said-  "You can have writing materials if you des- ire, and maRy write a dozen epistles to the chief, of the invaders, but they will avail you noth- ing, for it is General Arista's intention to cross the. river in a short time, perhaps on to- morrow, and drive the Army of Occupation beyond the Nueces." "With the force you have marshalled on that Plaza?" inquired Captain Leonard, con- temptuously. "That is a much greater force than the American army," replied Barbato. "But in the army of the Anglo-Saxon, es- pecially on this side of the Atlantic," replied Captaim Leonard no manis received 5who cannot whip his weight in wild-cats." "The American is a greaiit boaster," returned the officer, "'and bragadocia is an infallible sign of cowardice.'" 'o no, sir, the American is not abrag-. gart," replied Captain Leonard. "It would be no boast for General Houston to say he conquered Santa Anna at San Jacinto. There is nothing the American willnot undertake, and nothing he cannot accomplish." "Villain!' cried the officer, in a great pas- sion, *how dare you mention Houston and San Jacinto in my presence?" "I thought the recollection of them might assist you to form a more correct conclusion in reference to the powers of the American soldiery," replied Captain Leonard. "Barbarian," said the officer, "It is General Arista's intention to engagethe army of Oc- cupation in open battle, to defeat and disperse its members, to capture its general, put out his eyes, and exhibit him throughout the Re- public of 1Mtx ico."   /7-  "The man who is capable of such a deed," returned the prisoner, "is worse than a bar- barian."  "Dare you speak so of Mexico's favorite?" demanded Barbata, drawing his sword. 'W ould you strike a prisoner?" said Cap- tain Leonard, stepping ba'dktowards the wall. "I would thurst my sword through the arch-bishop himself, were he to apply such a term to Arista," replied the officer, striking atfthe face of the prisoner, and cutting away a portion of his beard. ';Brute!" exclaimed Captain Loonard, seizing a broken brick that lay on the sill of the window, and assuming an attitude or defence. "Do you defy me?" said/the enraged Bar- bata, springing forward with- his sword raised above his head, and his arm stretched to its utmost capacity. Captain Leonard, compelled in order to save his own life, hurled the brick at the of- ficer, and struck him full in the forehead, as the ruddy faced stripling of Israel did the great champion of the Philistines, but in- stead of the like fatal result the- officer re- ceived only a severe cut of several inches in length, which laid the- flesh open to the skull. Now Captain Barbata's rage knew no bounds, and had he not been blinden by the blood of the wound, the - prisoner must have lost his life. At length when the troops were all mar- shalled around- the Plaza, with facts toward the centre; when Arista, sitting on horse- back in the midst of the square, had harranS gued them for an hour, descanting upon the I prominent traits upon the American charac- ter, and' portraying the death and deso- t lation that would fall upon the Mexican pea- i pie if their army was defeated; when news of i the injury received by Captain Barbata had been officially received and in'like manner 1 communicated to the army, with a false ac- - count of the prison transaction that placed e Captain -Leonard in a very unjust light, yet t stimulated the curiosity of the impatient sol- - diery, who had been promised a sight of the prisoner' Captain Costa was ordered to bring   him forth, that he might be exhibited as a fair specimen of the people whom they were expected-to meet and -bon6quer.. CHAPTER XII. Wbile Captain Costa was-peparing the psisoner for exhibition, the troops were all faced about, and the general and his staff, all of whom were on horseback, leaving the cen- tre of the square, took a position immediately in front of the prison. The line of the troops was also extended, by marching them toward the houses that surrounded the square, and by reducing the' number of ranks. When within thirty feet of the building they were caused to halt, this space being reserved for the passage of the prisoner and the mounted officers. By this arrangement the troops were enabled to obtain a close observation of Captain Leonard, while the citizens who oc- cupied the pavements and balconies, were in like manner gratified.  At lenOth every thing being in readiness, the prisoner was led forth bareheaded, with his hands bound behind his back, with a rope of several yards in length, each end of which was firmly held in the hands of an al- guazil, who walked behind. The position of the prisoner was in front of the procession, a politic arrangement of the general, who was excessively fond of admiration, and not choos to be rivalled by an American captive. He clearly perceived that if he and his suitet rode in front, anxiety would induce the beholders to look over their heads; whereas, on the contrary, if the prisoner was put foremost, - after their curiosity was gratified, or the ob- ject of it beyond further observation, their eyes would then be turned admiringly upon their general and his splendid retinue. Captein Leonard left his prison under the apprehension of death, though the fear that f filled his breast was not visible inbhis coun-  tenanee. He  resolved to die as became an s American, and moved forward with /an un- ( daunted step, and a look of defiance, which-  greatly enhlnced the impression made by the v generals representations. On leaving his cell, he observed that the a balconies in front of the houses which sur- ]   rounded the Plaza, were Filled with persons of both sexes, whose curiosity was scarcely less than that of the soldiers and rabble; and the ttought occurred to him that among the ladies he might catch a glimpse of the I sweet and neautiful face of Olinda Rcda-  mont. I The city prison adjoined the old legislative hall on the north side, as the mansion of Mrs. Cathedra did on the opposite. Hence as the --prisoner first moved toward the north the curiosity of the handsome widow was the last to-be gratified, though,-perhaps, in con- sequence of the fright she had received, it was more highly stimulated than any body's else. In front of the procession, to clean away all obstruction, a platform of musketeers, with fixed bayonets, and weapons to charge, were marched immediately before the prison- er, who was thus rendered conspicuous. That all might have an opportunity to make a thorough examination, the-procession was caused to move like a funeral, which en- abled the prisoner, not only to observe' the countenances of those who filled the balconies, but to notice the appearance and equipage of the soldiery, among whom he most admired the two  divisions henceforth specified, Le Vega's artillery and the Tampico guards. Captain Leonard was not a military\an; he lacked even the taste and judgme fan amateur; but the opinion formed of the troops at that 'time, was fully confirmed by their subsequent deportment, especially at Resaca de la Paltia, when the guards were the last to leave the field, and Le Vega was captured with a torch in his hand. There was not a female face visible at the windows or on the balconies that Captain Leonard did not closely scrutinize, but am- dng them all he nowhere beheld the fair, features of Olinda. He had already passed the north, the east, and the south sides of the square, and so much of the west as lay norta of the barracks, Without observing the object of his search, and he began to feel like one who treads alone a banquet hall deserted. There was yet one house to pass before he arrived at the barracks.- It did not occur to him until they had passed all the others, ft  &#xD;<pb n="38-39" xml:id="VAC8064-00000021"/> that as General Martella's house did not front on the plaza, his household would most likely be found among the widow Cathledr-a's, owinz to the very particcolar intimacy that existed between the familles. With this thought his expectations increa- sed, and also his disappointment, for the object of his search was not anmon the occu- pants of the balcony. At -the north end stood the widow, leanin -on the arm of Valasqnz Romanno. She was indeed a hand- some woman, but her form- had the fulness theFrench call embonpoint, But therewere others there, of more youthfiul appearance, quite as bea utiful, and one a grreat deal more loveable in the prisoner's estinmation. Mrs. Cathedra noticed Captain Leonard with a sort of horror, having a lively but not very agreeable remembrance- of the fright he had occasioned her a few nights previous, when he so suddenly emerged from  the ground in her presence. Romanno had up- braided -T er for her desertion at that time, but excused her on the ground 'tlit he him- self-was as much frightened when hle saw the bearded countenance of the prisoner. The others looked upon Captain Leonard as most of those already passed had done, with surprise mingled with admiration. It is true they observed him very much as they would have done a Royal BFengal tierer in his cave, as a monster, formidable Jin his natural state, but harmless in his confinement. Nesv- ertheless. his handsome person and manly carriage called-forth many expressions of praise.- But there was one who regarded him with pity, and it was she he thought so loveable. At the farthest end of the-balcony, partially concealed by thosewho stood next her was a young woman, very beautiful, whose stream* ingeyes most touchingly expressed her deep sympathy for the unfortunate prisoner. Not only in this respect, but in many others, there was a marked differenve between this young lady and those by whom she was surrounded. She was tall, that is to say, tall for a Mexican, and if thet rosiness character- istic of the Saxon complexion had not been ?      ,      pa, iL a great measure wanting, she might have passed fur an Enuglish woman. tier hair, like all the people of southern climates, was black, and it hung in ringlets all round her neck and temples, addint, mIuch to the charms c f a face otherwise sulrpassing- ly beautiful. She was one of those angrlic creatures whose goodness is equal to her beauty, one of those who seldom twice cross a man's path in the allotted threescore years and ten.  There is a more manifest, but not a more certain recognition between friends when they chence together after a long absence, than between congenial spirits when they meet for the first time, no0 diffrence under what cir- cumstancps. But while the recognition of acquaintances may sometimes be the result of recollection, that of kindred souls is ever instantaneous; the immediate effect is elec- tical, and the consequential the consumna- tion of huirnman happiness or misery. If persons of this character are young and in a condition to form a matrimonial alliance the greatest possible degree of earthly bappi- ness is secured to them by constant fellow- ship. Whereas, on the other hand, if the law, or some other irresistable power, has interposed a barrier that may not be guiltless- ly surmounted, nlisery, in some degree,is the inevitable consequence. With his eyes fixed upon e beautiful face of the maiden, Captain Leonard moved for. ward, heedless of his footsteps, until -almost opposite the spot she occupied, when the brightest ray of the sun of life appeared to illumine his pathway to the grave; for after what Captain Barhata had said and done in prison, he could only resolve to die bravely, showing no outward sign of fear. An hour before Caplain Leonard had re- conciled his mind to the portentious event that was at once to terminate his troubles and usefulness on earth, and in a way and place that might forever leave his friends un- cercain of his destiny'; but the sympathetic tears of the- beautiful maiden, who, standing amid a group of curious observers, shrunk from the contemplation of his misery, awak- ened anew, and with a force never before es-   prienced, the desire for life's continuance and he resolved, comevhat might, to resist death in any form, so long as there was hope on earth orin heaven-so long as there was strength in his arm or efficacy m the heartfelt prayer.  Captain Leonard was a man of good edu- cation, wide experience, and extensive tra- vel; he had seen the beauty of many coun- tries, in its most attractive guise, and wit- nessed, in almost evory clime, the exqulisite pleasure and transcendent happiness of ma- trimonial life; and yet he had lived until his days were six-and-thirty years, without a de- sire to change his condition. But the sight of beauty weeping on account of his mis- fortune and misery, roused the latent affec- tion of his heart, stimulated his ambition to higher purposes, and determined his career of future usefulness. These reflections, though the consequence of an imaginary change in his situation, as will presently appear, had a beneficial effect upon the subsequent actions of Captain Leonard unier very trying circumstances. On being reconducted to his prison, he in- quired of Captain Costa, with surprise the cause of his recommitment. "Your exhibition,' said Captain Costa "was all that was intended, as it was thought by the General that the sight of an Ameri- can would inspire the soldiery with addi- tional courage, which he believed to be ne- cessary; for notwithstanding his declara- tions to the contrary, he knows that your army is composed of brave and - daring men, who fight for glory instead of gain, as is not the case with too many of our own." "This -is strange said Captain Leonard. ' The unprincipled officer who first entered my prison this morning, told -me to prepare for death, as I was Arst to be shown -to the army and people, and then executed in their presence." ' Captain Barbata, though a good officer' in very many respects, has certain peculiari- t'es of expression and action, which are at no time commendable, and under certain cir-  cumstances, perhaps  inexcusable," replied Captain Costa, " yet I hardly think -it the   result of evil principles, as your hasty remark would seem to imply." 'My remark was not hasty, nor a word of it uttered without consideration," returned Captain Leonard. , His deportment toward me on all occasions, and especially on this morning, has been as rnde and cruel as your own has been manly and gallant.^ I then went on to report the conversa- tion whlch passed between himself and Cap- tain Barbata, and to describe thVscene in which he had been victorious. "I do not doubt the truth of your r-lation,' said Captain Costa, "although Barbata des- cribes the intercourse and encounter in very different language. Bat his punishment, it not greater than the occasion demanded, is much greater than I could have desired." "To what extent is he injured?" inquired Captain Leonard, with solicitude. "I should not condemn my own action if it had result- ed in his death, for I think hisattack would have justified the destruction of life, yet I rejoice that it was spared, and hope he is not danrigerously injured " 'Unless inflammation ensues, the injury will not be-fatal, thouoh it must be confessed he is seriously hurt, so much so indeed, that weeks will pass beforehe will be able to re- sume his duties." "1 wish him a speedy recovery," said Cap- tain Leonard, "aud that the injury which he this morning received may result in his refer. mation.  There is one question which I ask- ed him that I will now ask you, as he treated it with indifference and insult,-whether I shall be permitted to have any communication with General Taylor or- the American, consul at this place?' I presume there will be- no objections," replied Captain Costa, " though your coxnm- munication with the former would have to undergo inspection." "Such a precaution is highly proper," said \gaptain Leonard. "I only desire to inform him -of my situation, and to inquire if he possesses the means necessary to. secure my deliverance " "I will make known your request to (Jen- eral Arista, and in due time inform you -of F  &#xD;<pb n="40-41" xml:id="VAC8064-00000022"/> *kV his answer," said Captain Costa, mo-ving to- ward the door. "And meantime," said Captain Leonard SI will prepare a communication, if you will send me ink and paper, and if it is not ap- proved, it can be destroyed." Upon the paper-used in Mexico there is a stamp duty, niwich rendered it at that time very expensive, a fact that Captain Leonard was ignorant of until long afterwards. But Captain Costa, whose deportment toward him had been courteous on all occasions, sus- pecting that he had been robbed of his money a3 well as his ship and liberty, pur- chased for his use a case of writing materials and some fine white English paper, and sent them to him with a note informing him of Arista's permission--an act of kindness that was subsequently remembered to his advan- tagc.  CHAPTER XIII. Having obtained -the consent of the Mex- ican General, Captain Leonard opened the writing desk sent him by the kind-hearted- aptaia Costa, and taking from it a sheet of paper, wrote a brief note-to the American Consul at that place, requesting an interview-. This he dispatched open by a messenger, feel- ing assured that it would never reach its ies- tination unexamined. He then returned to the desk and wrote a long letter to General Taylor, to whom he recounted all the events that had passed from the time he left New Orleans up to the moment of the writing. This letter he folded and addressed to the Commander of the Army of Occupation, but left it unsealed that it might be examined before it was forwarded. He had just completed his labors, when Mr. Shat-ell, the American Consul, was an- nounced,Captain Leonard immediately arose and extended his hand to the red faced, round bellied old man who stood at the door of his prison. After the usual salutations, Captain Leonard apologized for having troubled him on his own account, but that he found his loneliness so oppressive and his confinement so insupportable, that he was anxious if there was any way in his power, to obtain his li- beration. \   )A; OR, Mir S'atsell assured hirn that he was not aware of his capture until that morning, hav- ing suspended his official relations with the government d4miiil.  Bat that on that morning he had come out to witness the re- review of the army,' and was painfully surn prised at the sight of a fellow countryman in I bonds and upon exhibition. And that he had obtained permrission to visit him in his confinement, and inquire the circumstances connected with his imprisonment. Captain Leonard thanked him very warm- ly for his disinterested sympathy, adding, ' I amn delighted to see you, even if it is not in your power to relieve me. This solitary confinement is not endurable.-' ' My dear sir,-my countryman," said ir. Slatsell, earnestly, laying his hand upon the knee of the prisoner, "I should inave called upon you and dose all is my power to relieve your necessities and protect you from insult and abuse, if I had only known you were here. But as I have already said, I was first aware of the fact this morning." "Is there anything you can do toward af- fectint my liberation?" inquired Captain Leonard. "'I am anxious to be at liberty." "I presume I can do nothing to secure your permanent liberty," replied the Oonsul. ' They hold you as i prisoner of wnir, and my official capacities are all civil. However, I may relieve you of your confinement, if you will accept a parol. "That I will do with pleasure under the circumstances," replied Captain Leonard. "Indeed, as for the matter of that, I may consider myself in that situation at the pre- sentmoment. You see those wooden bars; well, it would not be difficult for me to break them and enjoy the liberty I so much desire. But I could not remain in this city if my liberation was thus obtained, and I should rather remain in this prison than be compell- ed to fly to Texas.     "What!" exclaimed the Consu!, surprised "prefer a Mexican prison to the wide prairies of free Texas, and you an American?" Captain Leonard was about to confess his love for the unknown beauty where commi- seration had so excitedhis love, as the only way to satisfy the surprised Consul, who was   n 1 m I e L Z X I v La on the verge of indignation, when the kind ness of the alcade occurred to his mind, and be made it the excuserfor the supposed pre- ference. "You very much mistake the nature of my choice," replied the captain. "Liberty any where is preferable to imprisonment any where. But even a Alexica- prison is to be preferred to a dishonorable liberation. In other words, if a prisoner, through the kind- ness of a friend is taken from a lonely and loathsome dungeon, and given the liberty of a large and light apartment, with the implied condition that he will not attempt to escape, is he not justified, as a man of honor, in pre- ferriog his confinement?" i He is, most assuredly," replied the Consul with a warmth of manner thut made the ob- serving Captain suspect his southern origin. 'But this is a condition in your case with which I was not acquainted. By whose kindness do you enjoy the air and lighl?" "My benefactor is one of the alcades of the city, but I do not recollect his name," re- plied Captain L. onard. "He is a man; per- haps above the medium height, but exceed- ingly me igre, resembling a corpse more than a living animal. But he has a beaming eye an i a tender tone, that gave me a more favor- able impression than I co;uld otherwise have formed of one that strongly reminded me of a doctors skeleton." "You mean Sandival Ambrosia,".said Mr. Shatsh, and he is every way worthy of the good opinion you have formed of him. He is universally respected among his own people, and is my favorite. I like him very much He is a gentleman and a scholar. He has travelled in our country, and has a high opinion of our people. You will value his acquaintance'"  "I trust I have a just appreciation of his kindness, which was entirely voluntary," said Captain L-onard, Caud I long to be at liber- ty that I may make the proper acknowletdge- ments tor his disinterested benevolence." "I certainly wish it was in my power to procure your liberty," said the consul, with regret; "but I cannot, see how I am to serve you in this respect. It may be that Gener- al Taylor, if informed of your situation, could *r'   io soetnh't0 for your relief. I know he will if it is in is power." "I had just eoucluded a communication to him before you arrived," said Capt. Leonard. '-So then, you had no confidence in my assistance after all?" said the consul. "'You cannot think so if you received my letter," replied Captain Leonard. "Yionr letter?" replied th e consul. "Why, I saw no letter from you." "I dispatched one to you an hour before ties was concluded," said Captain Leonard, placinr the end of his finger Upon the letter before him, "and supposed you came hither at my request." ',rNo, my son, I came of my own free will and accord," replied the consul. "I am grat- ified that you sought my assistance. It does my soul good to aid one that I know will ap- preciate my kindness." '  "And I am more highly gratified that yon came of your own choice,"-replied Captain Leonarff' 4Well, weql my son, it seems to have- tur-n ned out to our mutual advantage," said Mr. Shatsell. "'Bat enough of this. l',et me see your letter to General Taylor. You need not hesitate t-s-ow it to me, for it will be read by the Mexican General, or in his pres- ence, before it will be dispatched to Corpns Christie, "It was my intention to submit it for yonr perusal and approval," said, Captain Leon- ard. ' And if you thinlik it will be any ad- vantage, I should also like to have your cers tficate, in your official capacitv, to authen- ticate as many of the statements-as are with. in your knowledge." So sating, he handed the letter to Mr, Shatsell, who read it carefully throughput, and at the conclusion expressed his approba- tion. '-There is one thing that might as well havebeen omitted," said the consul, "and- tney may require you to exptinge it, and that is the descriptionUf your maltreat pnent." '"I have thought as much myself," replied Captain Leonard; "'bat it will be an easy  thing to make the alteration." j  &#xD;<pb n="42-43" xml:id="VAC8064-00000023"/> "How do you propose to get this letter to the general?" inquired MTr. Shatsell. "I should be very glad to avail myself of any sn(rgestions you may have to make," said the captain. "I'll take the letter with me and think about it," said the consul. "I'll do the best for you. I'll come and see you in the mor- ning. Good bye!" As he pronounced these last words! he held out his hand, which the captain clasped warmly in his own, and the next moment was shuffling away towerd his domicil on the op- posite side of the square, near the spot where Rodamount effected his escape from the wall. That evening a conference tools place be- tween him and Ambrosia, the alcalda, which resulted in a promise from the latter, that he would use his influence to have Captain Le- onard set at liberty on parol. He also agreed to carry his letter to Arista, and ob- tain permission to dispatch it to General Taylor. And in accordance with these prom- ises, he called and submitted the prisoner's communication for examination General Arista, as usual, was surrounded by his officrs, and he caused the letter to be read aloud for their gratification. The in- terpreter was a Spanish Mexican, ad a man of finished education ; that is to say, his par- ents were Spaniards and his birth-place Mexico, and he was a graduate, not only of the best school in the republic, but in Mad- rid, whither he had been sent to receive the finishing touch ; for strange to say, the Mex- ican, though he dispossessed and disfranchised the Spaniard years ago, and effect to hate him to )this day, thinlks no person's education can be completed outside of Madrid. The interpreter, as has been observed, was a man of fine education, and a residence of several years-in New Orleans enabled him to write and speak the English language with great ease and fluency. It was an easy task therefore, for him to read the contents of Captain Leonards's letter, whieh,-though written in English, he pronounced in Span- ish, with as little apparent difficulty as he would had done had. it been written and per- used in the same language.   Wrhen he! ad concluded, General Arista inquired of his officras if-hey discovered any thing improper in the letter. To which some one replied, that what was said in re- ference to Captain Barbata ought to be om- itted. Anothher thought that as the consul made no reference to that circumstance in his certificate, it was a matter of small con- sequence. A third said that the prisoner ought not to 'be permitted to hold any com- muaication with the general of the invaders, no more concerning himself than matters of graver importance. A fourth suggested that it would be an- excellent opportunity to call out some expression T-the American Gener- al, which might rgive. them a clue to his thourhts touchi ng cominga events. 'Here were a large number of officers pres- ent, and others of them expressed themselves in different ways, some making suggestions and some objecting; but the large majority seemed of the opinion expressed by the fourth speaker, that the communication was likely to elicit General Taylor's thoughts respecting the battle which was to be fought shortly under some circumnstances. This suggestion also met the approbation of Gen- enal Arists, and a messenger was dispatch- ed with the letter to the headquarters of tt^ie Army of Occupation. Captain Loonard's colmunication clearly explained to General Taylor what had hither- to been an absolute mystery,not only to those in the disputed territory, but to those having charge of the Quarter IMaster's and Commis- sary's Department at New Orleans,- the fate of the--Plying Cloud. From the time she was cast off from the steamer that towed her to the gulf, she had not been heard -of, and-it was generally believed she had perished in the storm. This intelligence gave a new phase to the position of the governments, and the facts--were immediately dispatched to Washington. General Taylor wrote a reply to Captain Leonard, to the following effTect;-thatit was out of his power to afford himtany immediate assistance; that the siuggestiou touching an exchange was well enough, but could avail nothing until after a battle, for that Arista ,      r  S  i e   would scarcely exchange him for a platoon of such marauders as the American scouting "pharties, daily captur-ed- and disarmer], and afterwards released; that there would be a battle fought in a few day if the enemy cross- ed the river, and he would see that a briga.- dier, or at least a colonel was captured for the purpose of an exchange; and advised him in the meantilne to bear his sufferinas with the fortitude of an Americsn, assuring him that if he failed to make the capture proposed he would burst his prison doors and set Lim at liberty. This was a verv diffrent communication from that whitEh General Arista and, his of- ficers expected in reply to the prisoner's; for in order that the latter might be off hiq guard  and communicate his opinions and purposes  without reserve or suspicion, the messenger; had been instructed to deliver the letter as a secret communication from Captain Leonard. i Whether General Taylor suspected the fraud and wrote for the eyes and ears of Mexican's,  or whether he wrote as if no one was to read his reply bat the person to whom it was ads dressed, is a-matter of importance; Captain Leonard and the Mexican officeris both be- lieved the latter which- was quite -thLsame as if it was so intended. On receipt- of this communication, General Arista casled a general cour cil of war, incl.- ding all his officers of the rank of Captain and upwards. The letter of the American General was the chief subject of discussion. If they could have supposed-it written for themselves, they would have been entirely content; but on the contrary, as alreadypaid was the general opinion, and they were puz- zled, how to construe the language of the  letter, which spoke of battle and success as things of course. Some   affected to be of  opinion that the Americans were a beautiful people, and so used to bragadocia that they i could not under any circumstances avoid 1 playing the braggart; and General Arista \1 was of this portion of the couucil. But after i all, the latter produce but little permanent s effect upon the council, for the Mexicans are E a   people of high hopes and grand calcula- N *i"   I tions, two things for which they make due allowance in others, especially in their enek mies: C1 :APTER XIv. From that day forward, the most vigorous exertions were made on the part of the Mex- icans. Inteed, for many days previous, large part ies bad beran at work in various places, I, building batteries, repair ing old forts, and j making defences of various kinds. A large body of troops had been thrown across the river, and was daily aurmentt,-d until the entire army was in Texas. Now prepara- tioos were made to annihilate the American army. To cut off supplies and stave those in Fort Brown was the plan proposed. To I this and a large party of troops was station- ed on the road fioni Point Isabel to Metamo- ras. Under this state of circumstances it be- came necessary to send a force from the fort i to open the ,way, and as this could not be done by a small detachment in the presence of the whole Mexican army, General Taylor resolved to withdraw his entire forces from the fort, except so many as were barely ne- cessary to guard it against the assautlt.; of the enemy, and go and bring provisions enough to'last during the bonvardment of the city, The events that immediately follow- ed are so scant and so widely known, that it would be a work of superfluity to encumber this narative with the particulars. Sufficeit to say, that wittin the next three days the battles of Palo Alto and Resaca de la Palm* were fought, and the arms ofthe Americafn' completely victorious. The Mexicans army was totally discomfit- fited and disorganized. The officers fled tow ward the river, leaving the-soldiers to tak care of themselves, and the soldiers followed the example of the ,officers. And so gr te was the consternation,that many rushed into the river and were drowned, being carried to the bottom or down the stream by the weight of their mail. Others, by  almost superhuman exertions, reached' the opposite shore, and died of pure exhaustion. Some were more fortunate, and gained their own  &#xD;<pb n="44-45" xml:id="VAC8064-00000024"/> caloicils, while others, who lived in a more remote part of the department of Tamaulipl -a, flA d through the city and beyond as if the victorious soldiers of the United States were panting at their leels. Meanwhile the prisoner occupied his cell  in a state of anxious agitation. A parol had been denied him on the ground of national treachery, as it was -expressed by the objec- tors, meaning that the Americans as a people were so treacherous, that it would be a dan- gerous experiment to trust any of the nature at the moment of a battle, lest information should be communicated to the enemy that ' might result in their own injury. A differ. ent reason was assigned to the American Consul and Mexican-Alcade, who were the applicants for thie liberty, and who proposed, to become sureties for the prisoner's proper  behavior; but they very easily discovered the true cause of the refusal.  Captain Leonard was duly informed of their unsuccessful effort, for which he thanked them as if their ends had been accomplished. But he was very greatly disappointed, for he' had hoped to obtain the liberty of the city  that he might visit his angel friend, the beaum tifnl' Olinda Rodamount, and seek his tearful sympathiser, the etierial reigin who shrunk from the contemplation of his myserv on the morning of his exhibition. But it was not the first time Capt. Leonard had been disappointed, and he reconciled himn, self to his fate with the philosophy-ofother occasions. He employed himself in writing' letters to his friends in the United States, which the kind?-hrarted Ambrosia promised to have conveyed to the Army of Occupation or some town in Texas, that they might be mailed for their destination,. He also wrote a letter to Olinda Rodaueo mount, thanking her, and through her Al- phonso Martella, for their kind assistance on the occasion of his deliverance from the abandoned reservoir. But he had occasion- more than once afterwards to regret this overflow of thoughtfulness; immediately bew cause he received no answeri-which occasionO ed him chagrin and mortification; and sub,   sequeutly, because it involved her and her lover in difficulty, which caused him sincere regret. Oa thetighth of May he heard the loud can nons of the armies, as they battled near the tSalltimbers that furnished a name for the en- gagement. It cameto his ears like the rum- bling of distant thunder, and filled his mind with dread and uncertainty. Not regarding his one fate, for that was fotgotten in the cause of his country, whichh, however others have considered it then and since, was in his opinion just and right. But to his inquiries respectig the battle, his jailor refused to comunic tto any particu- lars. He admitted there had been an en- gagement, and claimed for the Mexicans a victory. He even wentso far as to admit that the day following Arista intended to- en- counter the Americans again,if they did not retreat during the night. But not a word could. be elicued concerning the battle fought beyond that already mentioned. But Captain Leonard's mind, even with this intelligence, was in a state of uncertainty. In the prowess of theAmerican poeple- he had abundant confidence, but he feared its suffi- ciency against a army of such superior numbers, to the last. degree hopeful of suc cess. Bat he was encouraged, despite the upleasant news of the jailor, by the dis- charge of cannon at intervals during the night. And' from his acquaintance with the locality, obtained from a rough and lasty sketch by Mr. Shatsell, at his request, he could easily distinguish the guns of Fort Brown from those of the enemy. On the day following, the battle of Resaca de la Palma was fought; but thejailor, with the sang-froid peculiar to the Spaniard, claimed for the Mexicans another victory. At first CapUtin Leonard was -disposed to ' doubt the truth of his assertion, having wit- nessed from the window of his prison what he thought-the unmistakable signs of apprehen- sion. But the jailor assured him of the contrary. The running was occasioned by the joy exper- ienced on acount of the victory, one vieing with another who should spread' thenews   quickest and farthest; and this looked rea- sonable. The grief and anguish that were manifested, were the direct consequence of the loss of friends, fait hers, husbands, brothers, sous; and tks was natural.' But if these ex- planations had failed to convince the prison- er, the presence of Captain Barbata an hour  afterwards, accompanied by half a dozen sol- . diers, would have removed alldoubts from  his mind.  it was after dark when this officer visited! the csh of the prisoner, on this occasion. It was evident from his manner, that he had not i forgotten the scene enacted in that place a short time before, in which he had sustained the most tragical part. In- one hand ,he held a lamp, and in the other a drawn sword, and at his back, with bayonets fixed, were the soldiers. - Captain Leonard, by the dim light of the lamp, readily recognized the hateful features of the cruel Barbeta, whom he regarded with indiscribahle horror. His countenance, at all times-repulsive, was greatly disfigured by a score of narrow white -straps of plaster, which  served to hold the flesh together.  The wound had nearly healed, but the straps could not be removed with safety ,until the ; knitting was perfect. Beside the wound, his, countenance was! further disfigured with a scowl that fore- boded danger to the prisoner, as certainly  as the portentious cloud foretells the storm. Captain Leonard felt that there  was no i escape from the punishment which the, as- sassin-proposed to inflict. There was no frag- ment of brick within his reach as on the for-  meroccasion, nor would it have availed any- thing against an offiecr, backed by a squad of men, and all armed with steel set for im- I mediate use. But Captain Leonard was not the man to \ despair under any  circumstances. Against Arista and all his force he would have made a cn exertion to save his life. He siezed thne chair upon which he was setting, and swin- ing it above his head, in the next moment would have struck , Barbata to - the floor, 'if  not killed him on the spot, if he had not instantly retreated and called upon him to  desist. -- t I   "I come with no evil intentions," saidthe officer, dropping the point of his sword to the floor and resting his hand upon the hilt, "but to do the biddings of my general." "I know not what may be the orders of your superior, "replied Captain Leonard, lowering the chair, to the window sill, but still holding it firmly within his grasp, "but to me a drawn sword and a fixed bayonet are always instruments of evil." "But I assure you they are not on this occasion," said Captain Barbata. "Then why are they displayed? ' inquired Captain Leonard. "After what has already occurred between us," said the military officer, "I was afraid to enter your presence again without prepar- ation against further injury of a like charac- ter." "You have nothing to fear from meso long as your treatment is courteous and proper," replied Captaia Leonard. "Convince me of your peaceful disposition by putting aside that chair," said the Mexi- can officer. "Captain Barbata has not inspired me with so high  an opinion of his honor as would justify me in placing myself at his mercy," replied the American. "But I cannot rid myself of apprehen- sion," said the Mexican, "so long as Isee you in that threatening attitude." "Nor can I feel secure so long as you hold in your hand a drawn sword," replied Cap- tain Leonard. Barbata immediately thrust his sword into its sheath,'and motioned his men a couple of paces back, sayg ThNow, are you satisfied?" Captain IjeonWd made no reply. hot he placed his chair upon the floor, yet in such a position that it might be used upon emer- gency. After which the Mexican entered into an explanation of the cause of his visit to the prison at that hour.        \ "Our General," said he, 'has encountered yours, and completely routed him. But he has taken up a position on the other side of the Neuces, where he proposes to remain until - reinforcements shall reach him, when he dew igns to renew the invasion. -As the repulse  &#xD;<pb n="46-47" xml:id="VAC8064-00000025"/> which your army has sustained will cause your Presidant to send a more powerful force to operate against this city. Arista has ad- vised the removal of the inhabitants, that in case it becomes necessary to serve the enemy as the Muscovites did the French, the loss of life may- not be increased by the conflagra- tion. And for reasons which will readily suggest themselves to your own mind he has ordered your removal to Victoria, and charged me with its execution." "You give me credit for too great percept tion,' replied Captain Leonard. "I cannot understand why I should -be removed, unless General Arista apprehends defeat; and even then, I cannot clearly perceive the reav son for the removal."' "Allow that to be the reason,"' said the Mexican. "Defeat in battle on opposite side of- the river, would involve the necessity of a retreat. This city would then become a military camp, and, possibly, its streets a battle field. Then it would be too late to remove valuables, whether jewels or prisoners of war. Such a consequence we do'not an- ticipate, but the skillful General overlooks nothing that may be to his advantage und'er defea(,py more than he would the necessary steps of preparation for battle. It is for this reason that you are to be removed." "And when is the change to take place," asked Captain Leonard. '"We shall leave to-night," replied Cap- tain Barbata. "Why so much haste," inquired the Ame- rican, apprehensive. "To-night an escort leaves this place for Victoria, to convey some State prisoners to a place of greater security, and, to aviod double trouble, the General has ordered me to join them," was Barbata's reply. "But why is not the deparlture deferred until to-morrow morning,'" persisted Capt. Leonard, with increased apprehension. "Lest a demonstration be made in favor of the prisoners, who are popular with the people," replied the Mexican. The prisoner was silent. Whet this new feature in the history of his imprisonment could be he was at a- loss to conjecture. That it boded evil of some description was war- ,    L   ratited by the presence of Barbata, and yet he knew that his removal could not be affected without orders from the commander- in-chief, But, as resistance would be in vain, he resolved to submit without opposition. At the close of the above conversation, Captain Barbata remarked that he had some i prep ration to make for himself, which would require all the time between then and the nmoment of departure; that, therefore, he ! would le; ve the soldiers present to prepare I the prisoner, while he attended to his own ! comforts. He tOeu withdrew and motion- ed one of the soldiers alter him, to whom he gave some particular directions, chief among which pertained to his personal secu- rity. In obedience to the directions of his supe- rior, the soldier, who boasted the rank and i authority of a Sergeant, set about the neces- I sary preparations for the journey. To this end he produced a long rope, and with the I help of two ot his companions, tied the unresisting prisouer's hands behind his body in the same manner that they were bound on the morning of his exhibition. And in this condition he remained until the return of the officer, which was not far-from midnight. CHAPTER XV Captain Barbata, on leaving the prison, had mounted his horse which a servent held at the door, and rode at an ambling pace to the other end of the -city, where he entered the market place and paused at the door of Valarsquer Romano.  He knocked against the door with the butt of his whip, and im- mediately it was opened by a servant, who led the horse into the house directly ajfter his master had? entered, and through to the gar- den, where he was secured to a post for that kind of purpose,  Another servant conducted the officer to. the presence of Romano, who was sitting in  a small side room, in the center of which stood a table covered with a white linen cloth, containing dishes aitnd victuals for their sup- pers, Romano rose at the entrance of the -officer, extended his hand in, welcome, and showd him to a seat at the table.   Every thing having, been so prepared as to render assistance unnecessary, the servant who had conducted the captain hither was immediately dismissedwith order to remain within hearing of tue bell. But servants not unfrequently, when not permitted to go as far as inclination prompts, remain much nearer than is altogether desirable. Thus the young man who 'was banished from the presence of his master and his mas- ter's guest, endeavored to pass the time em; ployed by thein in supping and conversation in taking some key hole notes. But owing to a dullness of comprehension, he got but a very imperfect notion of what was under consideration. "You are behind. the hour," said Romanno, reprovingly. "I had become quite impas tient."  'It was impossible for me to be here sooner,  repliedBarbata.   "Ambrosia was busy fit-  ting out his expedition, and as long as he was about the prison I could not gain access 1 to the prisoner unnoticed."       f \ - 'Well, and what is the present condition 1 of things?" asked Romanno. "Every thing, I believe is in readiness, re- t plied Barbata.              i "flow mpany does Ambrosia's expedition number?" continued the merchant.    i "I could not tell," replied the officer.- J "The escort consists of Captain- Peron and ' k his musketeers, and about a score of mounted  Rancheroes under the charge of Juan Mor- tior."  d 'But how many people-you can certainly n make a guess?"' said Romanno, impatiently. p "At least a hundred," answered Barbata.  'The devil!" exclaimed the merchant, sur- s prised. "Why, who?"          ! n "I know not who all," replied the officer, ii "there are at .least thirt familiesepresent- fi ed."1  - "Who-who?" cried Romannoeagerly.   " 'The families of GomezMenchaca, Chap- ai pa, Scloval, Romiquez, Barbodi, Rappello, i Arnijedo, Cathedra,"-          c '$And is Mareguanna among the number?' pr interrupted the merchant, anxiously.  l X If you mean the beautiful widow, yes," replied Carbata.            ail   )  "Curse the luckf!" cried the merchant, ex- t cited and indignant, '-That is what I most 3 feared." I  "Ah! indeed!" exclaimed the officer. "Why 3 what difference can she make?"  "More than you can iniagine^ replied Ro- i manno; bat not wishing to be interrogated, he quickly added an inquiry, that required an answer and a change in the subjuct of com- munication. "By what means do you expect to detach her from the company?" "Who, the widow?" inquired Barbata. "No, curse the widow, and you too if you don't forget her this moment," answered Romanno. ';I mean Andronita." "Oh! I scarcely know," replied the officer "I think I have formed no plan as yet. I shall endeavor to enlist Peron in the matter. He will go as far for money as I will for revengu, and that -you know is not a little distance." '"He will, truely," replied Romanno, "bus not in this direction. If I am correctly ins formed, he is in love with Andronita, and not likely to assist you in my behalf."' "He is in love with old Rcdamcnt's daugh- ter, and betrothed to her to boot," replied Barbata.  1"He is betrothed to her, but in love with Andronita," returned Romanno. "I can't admire his preference," said Bar- bata, "for Olinda is greatly the superior. "Say so where and when you will but in my presence," returned the minerclant, "Olin- da is a superior woman when compared with most of her sex, but Andrornita is without a peer."  I '1 have thought of no other plan than the subvention of Peron," and Captsdn Barbata, resuming the subject in hand. "But if your information is correct, some other must be fixed upon. Perhaps Mortior may be con- trolled?" "Scarcely, if h-ff hioofPeron's command," answered Romanno.          A  "But he is not," quickly returned the offli- cer. "To him is entrusted the custody of the prisoners.-' "What prisoners?" inquired the merchant. "Alphouse Martalla and Olinda Rodamcnt,' answered Baibata.  &#xD;<pb n="48-49" xml:id="VAC8064-00000026"/> "Prisoners!" exclaimed Romnanno, truely. i surprised. "Why, for what are they prisou- eps?" "Is it possible you have-not heard?" replied the officer. "They were this morning arres- ted for having assisted in the escape of Rod- amcnt and that cursed American, who spoil- ed the beauty of my countenance." "This is obrtunate," said Romanno: "It will enable us to manage the thing without difficulty. A feigned attack upon Mortior's command will bring Perou to his assistance, when a rush amnong the women and children will enable you to carry off Andronita." 'I do not altogether like the plan, for it is attended with too much danger,' replied Bar- bata. "I am of the opinion, that by joining the party with the American, I shall escape suspicion; and having gained the confidence of Peron and Mortior, shall find little diffi- culty in discovering an opportunity to carry offAndronitadurina to-morrow night," "Perhaps that will be better," said Ro- manno, thoughtfuilly. "At any rate, I see nothing preferable at the present moment.- But it is time we were under way, or they will get too much the start." '- No fear of that, for they must necessarily- travel slow," replied Barbata. But unless I get the prisoner beyond the city to night, I shall stand but a slim chanuce for-revenge;- Even if the Americans do not come and set him at liberty, Ambrosia will protect him against me until he is exchanged " "Well, if you have finished your supper, there is nothing to detain you," said Roman- no. "The Men I promised to furnish, are in the court ready to set out at a moments warn- ing." "Then, the sooner we are off the better," said Barbata, rising from the table. "Where is the General's order?" inquired Romanno, with-a smile. "Here," answered the captain, touching the breast of his coat opposite his waistcoat pocket. "Give it me," said Romanno. Barbata deliberately unbuttoned his coat, felt in one pocket of his vest and then in the other, then in both his trowser.; pockliets, but \ .    *   the order was in none of them, at least it was not found. "I certainly put it in this pocket," he re- marked, feeling again in the pocke which he had first examined- "It is not here! I must have lost it." "That is very unfortunate," said Romanno, quickly, "for it defeats all our purposes." 'gIt can t effect them at all," replied Bar- bata. 'The order has done its work; it has procured us the control of the prisoner." "But it is a forgery, and if evil befals the prisoner, will easily be detected, and the deed may be. fixed upon its rightful perpetrator,' returned Eomanno  "Though the signature is good enough to deceive the prefect, Arista would detect the imposition, for he would know he never executed such an order. So, through your carelessness both our plans are frustrated, and our most cherished purposes defeated."' "There is nothing to prevent the progress of our intentions," said Barbata, "Nothing but the loss of the order," re- plied Romanno. "That is a small matter," said the officer, contemptuously. , "It involves my honor," said the merchant, in an excited tone, "and unless it is recover- ed, nothing further shall be done. I can ef- fect my purpose in some other way." '"It may be sticking in some cogner of my pocklet," said Barbata, renewing the exami- nation.  It will be perceived from- the foregoing conversation, that the officer and merbchant -bad entered into an agreeme't, each to assist the othert in carr'ying out a favorite object. The condition s of that agreement were brief- - ly, that Romanno, being an excelnt pensman and acquainted with Arista's signature, should forge an order aponwthe city prefect for the. delivery of the American into the custody of Barbata, and furnish a company of fifty men to carry him beyond the city to a place of security; and for this service Bar- bata was to sieze/Andronita Rappello on her way to Victoria, and carry her off tovard the mr ountains' where Romaliuo should sud-   denly cro s his path, and rescue her from her fancied danger, lomanno purposed 6o wrong beyond the mere abduction. He loved Andronita-lov- ed her almost to distraction; but his love was not reciprocated. Pntil he saw her, he had loved the widow Cathedra; but the beautiful widow had no charms for his eyes after they had once dwelt upon the angelic countenance of the adorable Andronita. It was on the day of Captain Leonard's exhibition to the Mexican soldiery and popu- lace, that he first beheld this lovely creature. She was standing at the north- end of the widow's Balcony, in the half concealed atti-  tude described many pages back, and the tears r of compassion were trickling down her dim- 1 pled cheeks, and falling softly, one after an- 1 other, upon her heaving bosom. His atten- N tion had been directed toward her by the ad-  miring gaze of the prisoner, and the discove- ry of such angelical sweetness and beauty t instantly inspired him with love for the mai- f den and- hate for the unfortunate being whose i situation had called forth her tears.  r But scarcely had he discovered the lovely r Andronita., when Mrs. Cathedra, who leaned upon his arm, claimed his attention, and di- t rected it toward some object in quite a differ- o ent direction. Much against his desire he i complied with her request, but as soon as he b could without attracting her notice and excit- c ing her jealousy, turned his eyes again toward tl the spot where he bad seen the etherial beau- o ty. But to his surprise and vexation, she b was gone, and before he could free himself from h the widow, she had left the mansion. Romanno was too deeply enamored not to he make some exertions to discover the object w of his love, and he was not long in obtaining m the desired information, and what he prized a  even more, an introduction. As already said, Q he was wealthy and very generally respected; m and perhaps there was not a young lady in the city who did not envy. the beautiful wid- re ow such a  comely and desirable husband, of ta this fact he was aware,and he concluded there in could be no exceptions among women. ^ But to his surprise, Andronita Rapello ed checked his declaration before it was halt'-ut- bi 4   r tered. She described his behavior as perfi- dious. She refused to hear a contrast b e 3 tween her own and the widow's beauty. She told him plainly that if he was not bound to ; another lady the sacred promise of matrimo- nial alliance, shecould not love him. In short she repulsed him with reproaches, and threat: ened to discover his faithlessness to his be- trothed. Romanno insisted that it was not his fault that he admired her beauty; any other person must have done as much. Of course he was to blame for having confessed his foolish love; but he was impetuous, and the hope of win- ning so fair an angel ought to excuse even a greater indiscretion. He begged that'she would not expose this love passage, but oa the contrary give it consideration; he had the vanity to hope if she could realize the depth of his love, she would regard him with favor.. To all of which the maiden replied, that the character of his love could make no dif- ference with her, because she loved anothqei But to his inquiries concerning her love, ani more particularly if it, was reciprocated, she refused an answer. Romanno found it impossible to elicit ny thing beyond her ingenuous confidence. Of other persons he made inquiry;, but gaited m information -which could assist hix to a relia- ble conclusion. Among the youth of .the city, many had heard of her beauty, but until the day of Captain tLeonard's exhibition, no one had ever beheld her, so carefully had she been guarded from their gaze, in the quiet of her rural home. The merchant was of the pinion, aD t i he could render her some signal service, 4 would make such a deep impression on ier mind, that gratitude would assist her in ite; accomplishment of his purpose. And with this object in view, he entered into the: age" ment with Barbata.         . - On the other hand, the officer, lent upoP revenge for the injury,iwd disfigurement s- tained at the hand of the prisoner, yet Ark ing to avoid cenuare as well, as Sn a fig more serious, had accented and used-the frg-, ed order, and now wished.,to retain itto gowr by what authority he had acted, in case he  &#xD;<pb n="50-51" xml:id="VAC8064-00000027"/> was called upon to render an account for his behavior toward the prisoner, whom he in- tended to destroy atthe first opportunity. But Romanno, too sagacious to be overreached by such contemptible falsehood, refused to take any part in the abduction and murder of the prisoner, so long as the order existed to clear another and contemn himself. Finding it impossible at the same time to glut his vengeance and cast the blame upon , another, Captain Barbata again renewed the , search, with great energy, and to his appar-, -ent surprize, found the order in the pocket he! had twice before unsuccessfully examined.-  Of course ithad found its way into the very farthest corner, and was only discovered with great difficulty. The order having been delivered up to Ro- manno, and by him destroyed, there was no farther obstacle, as between themselves; in the way of their wicked deeds. The men in the court, who were lounging about upon the, gound half disposed to encourage repose; were ordered to get themselves ready with all possible dispatch, as they musthe off without further delay. The men having but little to do beside mounting their ponies, were soon in readiness. From Romanno, they proceed- ed to the prison, whence the prisoner was brought forth and mounted upon a horse, when the entire party set forward on the road to Victoria. CHAPTER XVIL It was nearly noon the next day before Barbata and his party overtook Mortior and his, who composed the rear of the column.- Peron and his mounted- musketeers rode in advance. Between the escorts rode the citi- sens and the prisoners. The former were composed chiefly of women and children, who were escaping from their homes to avoid the Americans, whom Arista had pronounced barbarians, and whose gallantry on the two days previous had not served to dimini h the dread with which they were almost univer- sally regarded. Mortior was not a little surprised when overtaken by Biarbata; havirg in charge the Ameriean prisoner. At first he suspected   W, atV the truth, that this officer, set upon revenge for the injury be had received, had taken ad- vantage of the tumult and coosteration to carry off the prisoner for the gratification of his vengeful disposition. . He intimated as much, when Barbata endeavored to satisfy him of the contrary by the proof of those soldiers who had accompanied him to the prison, all of whom had seen Arista's order upon the prefect for the prisoner. It is most probable that these representations were at te'. time believed, for the act was in exact keeping with some others which could not be doubled, Mortior, who had been an active soldier in the earlier struggles of the republic, could not but regard with contempt, the general who would fly from a city of ten thousand' inhabitants, with an organized army of more than half that number untouched in the res cent engagements, with a rabid unbridged river between him and the enemy, and yet not forget to arrest a youth and maiden for having assisted a condemned fathor to obtain' his liberty, or to order a prisoner of war, the captain of a small government transport, to be carried into the interior of his country as if the presence of these prisoners would wipt away the stain of defeat from his repua- tation. More than once had he reareted his present undertaking; and had he known for what he was summoned from the quiet of his ranche, he would have refused. Even now he was disposed to hazzard his neck by giving the prisoners in his charge their liberty He had already ordered their bond to be remov- ed; indeed, this was done in the morning, as soon as he discerned who- were his prisoners. Barbata had rode on in advance with a small party of soldiers, those who bad ac- companied him to the prison, except the sar- geant before mentioned, who was charged with the custody of the prisoner; and the conversation barely alluded to above, had all transpired before they arrived. ' As remark- ed some chapters back, Barbata envied and hated General Martella, who some years be- fore was only a subordinate, with a commis- sion. younger than his own, but who, by his   A IL L J A. LIk prowes in battle andfis dovotion to Santa Anna and his country, had rapidly risen to therank and command Wfa brigadier. He therefore secretly rejoiced to see the son of his rival a pri oner. Alphonso observed the ill concealed satis- faction of his father's enemy, and could not forbear remarking, that he would do well not to exult until after his condemnation, which was a thing not likely to occur in conse- quence of the charge against him, as there was no proof by which it could be sustained. "I incline to the contrary opinion,'" said Barbata, You refused to admit the search- ing party under my -command, into your fa.. ther's house, into which Rodamont had fled because I was not with them, giving him suf- ficient time to escape.  "Bat I was ignorant of the fact as I shall be able to make appear," said Martella. ;At the time of his entrance I was in my own a- partment, which I did not leave till the dis- pute arose between your men and my father's! servants." "That sort of proof might have answered your purpose if the American had not writ- , ten that letter to Miss Rodoment, but that I has played the deuce Iwith your calculations " said Barbata. "What letter?" cried Martella. with sur- prise. "What letter?" repeated Barbata. "Why, is it possible you are ignorant of the cause of your arrest?"  "I have been arrested for the supposed of-  fence of aiding Rodamont to escape from his 1 pursuers," replied Martella. "True," said Barbata, "and your supposed guilt is based upon the American's letter to; old Rodomcnts daughter."         1 "Wbat letter, I repeat?" said Martella. Barbata, perceiving that he was really ig- norant on the subject of his inquiry, informed  him that Captain Leonard, a few days provi- c oneus, had written to Olinda, expressing his c thanks for the kindness she bad manifested c toward him, and for the assistance she and I E Alphonso had rendered in his efforts to es-l t cape; and that the letter had found its way e e   a into the hands of the general, who fortwith D ordered their arrest. a  This explnnation made. clear in the mind 3 of Martella whaLt had before been a mystery. He had wondered why his arrest had been, so ong deferred, as Capta in Barbata must Ihave t reported his conduct at the time it transpired. t He wondered still more why Olinda had been i arrested with him, as she was on the porch a above, and bore no part in the conversation and disputes of the soldiers with the inmates of his father's mansion. Striking his spurs into the flanks of his horse, he dashed quickly forward along side of the maiden, and communicated the facts he had just obtained from Barbata. And he could not refrain from an expression of ; censure for the imprudence that had got them into such a dangerous difficulty. But Olinda checked the reproach in the ut- terance. In her opinion, good intentions ought to excuse evil consequences. There might be a lack of prudence, but no want of goodness. Captain Leonard had meant well, and been deceived.  ADd much more to the ; same effect.  Alpbonso listened quietly to her vindica- tion.  When concluded he offered no objec- tion, and remained silent. Olinda waited a few moments to afford him an opportunity to reply, and then led the conversation into another channel., "What, I wonder has become of the Amer- i ican?" che inquired. "Doubtless he is at liberty," answered Mar- tella. "His countrymen would open the pris- on door to him, if they had to use force." "I certainly hope your conjecture may prove correct," said the maiden, with emo- tion ; "for I own I have felt more anxiety on his account than on ours, since our arrest." At that moment the clatter of horses' feet  on the stony road over which they had just  passed, was distinctly heard a)bove the noise of their own  -and Alphonso, looked back to discover by whom it was caused. A spore of mounted rancherps, armed with swords and ecopettes,- were advancing at a fiery rate, heedless of the danger that maenced them at every leap. They rode with that apparent  &#xD;<pb n="52-53" xml:id="VAC8064-00000028"/> defiance of death which characterizes thaeval- orous soldier in the battle charge, and seemed to have no other object in view than the in- . stant distinction ot Mortier and his com- I pany.  And this was the old captain's first impres- I sion. Acting upon the instant, he ordered his men to halt, face about, and repel the charge. Here Barbatainterposed, assuring. him that the new comers were the remainder of his own command, and that their haste was in conformity with his orders.- Mortier affected to be satisfied, but kept his men in a defensive position until he could make sure of the truth. More than once he had seri- ously considered in his own mind the propri- ety of releasing the prisonrs, but to have them wrested from him was something to- tally incompatible with his nature and the  honor of a faithful soldier, and resolved to defend his charge against any attacl ; and l this he would have done at all hazzards, if i the intention to set them free had been the i thought uppermost in his mind at the mo- ment. But in a very few seconds the truth of 3Babata's assurances was manifest; the party  proved to be the remainder of three of his command. Soon they arrived at the place  where Mortier's men were drawn up in a posi- tion for defence, -advancing fearlessly at a sign from their commander. A general re- [ cognition ensued, for Romanno's -laborers found many acquaintances among the guard of Mortier. A bottle of meycal and a gourd of water testified to their joy at the meet- ing, and much loud talk and hilarity en- sued.. MartelIa dliad his fellow prisoner, by the kindness of Mortier, unrestrained had rode a j 'short distance in advante of the escorte, to i be out of hards way in case of a collision.  But as -the swoift-coming party more nearly  approached,bthe qniclk eye of the youth dis- tinguiAhedtamong the ridprs, a man in bonds; andupon a better view, recognized the un- fortiunate American. "-Amnib'g those who ride in this direction," said Martella to the excited maiden by his side, 'see captain Leonard, bound as when , I first beheld him a prisoner.  ,                .   "'A'plhouso," said the maiden, in a voice full of mingled pity and reproach-pity for i the prisoner and reproach for herself, ' I shall I n'ver forgive myself for the part I acttd in Cthe drama that deprived the noble hearted I yoaul;g man of his liberty. Hail be been a coarse, selfish, cruel man, the character of the act would noi have been chanced, and I might never have realized the wroung I had inflicted t but his noble self-denial has made my selfish behavior the more palpable, and his mind and manners, both of which are so admirable, the one in its struggle and culti- vation, and the other in their grace and re- finement, have completely won my hieart." AMartella raised his eyes to the maiden's countenance, which was all aglow with her , animation. A-pang ofjealousy shot thronuh j his heart, which a moment before was full of sympathy for the prisoner. Ever since the j event at the cistern of his father's garden, he had observed a change in Olinda's bearing I toward himself; he had many times wondered what could be the cause, and now believed he had made the discovery. His eyes instantly fell from the glowing countenance of the maiden to the ground upon which their beasts were stamping rest- lessly. That moment he loved Olinda a thousand times more intensely than ever be- fore. He could not account for this increased emotion, for he did not feel flattered that she preferred the American. At first his thoughts were rational, but in a -little while they be- came confused, and he lost in a reverie s  "Alphonso," said- the maiden, breaking  upon his thoughts, '"if Barbata will permit I should like to speak with Captain Leon- Aar. A cloud instantly overspread the comely features of the youth ; lightning flashed from his eyes; his voice, as -he pronounced these words, resembled the low muttering of the distant thunder, "I shall endeavor to secure you an interview." -aid he turned away and rode toward Batrbata' There was something in his /manner that alarmed Olinda; he had never so looked, so spoken before.- Had she divined the cause at that moment, she would have hated him with the sincerity of her love. 'Uneeriaiuty   increased her anxiety, and an-xiety her love, for the truth did not enter her mind. She loved Alphonso, and that moment more ar- dently than ever before.-For the scowl upon his brow seemed to her a manifestation of the anger hbe felt toward the American for the imprudence which hnd inovolved them in so much difficulty, and -his ready a-quits-scaence a proof of his devoted attachmrrent. In a few moments Captain Leonard advan- ced toward the maiden with a polite saluta -tion, followed by expressions of commissera- - tion for her situation so "blended with self- reproach for his own thoughtlessness, that she scarcely knew how to answer. But allowing her feelings to dictate, she assured him that the inconvenience to which she was subjec- ted, was nothing in her mind when compar- ed with the unbonnded pleasure occasioned by his written acknowledgment of the little service she had rendered him, who had done so much for her father. ," And where is your father, my beautiful benefactor?" enquired Captain Leonard. "You I will tell," said the maiden. "I have already told Alpbhonso. I know not another in all this multitude to whom I could trust a secret of such im"portance.'] "Not even Captain Peron?" inquired the i American with a-glance of peculiar signifi-  cance.                 I "Captain Peron!" repeated the maiden." i "Is he here? I have not seen him. Where  is he?"                 I "In the van," repied  Captain Leonard. "He has charge of the escort, who  have I charge of the women and children."   i "And does he know that I amn here a pris- r oner?" asked Olinda anxiously.     1! ,I1 do notknow," replied the American. r 4I knew it before I left my prison." 1I "But he did not certainly," said the mai- I den; addressing her own mind rather than the ears of her companion. Until now,;I did b not know that he was of our number? he h is no more aware of my presence.  And yet h he may be. Of late his conduct has been  M singularly cold and indifferent. I have half b doubted his love; I may test it now. 'He t] shall know that I am here and a prisoner." jf The maiden paused, A   deep blush suf- I   fused her cheek. She had spoken aloud, for- getful of her situation. Butsheturnedin- stantly to Captain Leonard, and gave him her entire confidence. "If you knew less of my secret sufferings," said she," not even as my father's friend would I make you their recipienfft. But you have discovered all, without an unvorthy ef- fort on your part. You know more than Alphonso, and he knows that I love him. How unhappily situated to love one and wed another. "Such unhappiness is notrational under any circumstances, nor is it ever commenda- ble when it can beavoide," replied Captain Leonard. "But I cannot break my -promise," said the maiden. "Such a cause, though perhaps the best that can be offered, is the very last to be received as a justification." "If Captain Peron's-love has grown cold like your own, as you suppose, rest assured that an  opportunity will offer which will justify the breach in the opinion of the world," replied the American." "You speak of my love," said the maiden. "I never had  any for Captain Peron. I preferred him, sincerely; I respected him greatly; but I did no more, certainly; forndw that I analyze the feelings that I entertained for him during our association in a strange land, I know I never felt for him a particle of gerfuine true love such as I feel constant- ly. for Martillo." By this time the mezeal and water having been imbibed in quantities sufficient to sat- isfy the, appetites of all, and dethrone the. reason and destroy the steadiness of some, Martior- ordered a march. This necessarily required a separation of the parties, not on- ly of the guards, but of Oliuda and Captain Leonard.  Alphonso rode by the side of the maiden, but neither was inclined to speak. Her. heart wasfull to overflowing with loave for. him, and her thoughts were busy with tle. words of Captain Leonard; but Martilla's  heartfhad scarecely more love for the maiden than liate -for the American, in vhomhbis jealous fancy bad found a successful rival. Delicious-dreams of future happiness ab- 3  &#xD;<pb n="54-55" xml:id="VAC8064-00000029"/> sorbed Olinda's thoughts, and castles such as fairies never -built sprang up before her mental vision, distinct as the sunbeams which lag along their path. Pity such bliss- ful reveries can never be realiz d; they are therefore better avoided, for they only serve to blacken the reality. Thoughts of an opposite character filled the mind of Martella; and they were not a  reverie-a day-dream like Oinlia's, but deli- berate thoughts--wicked thought -da nuer- ous thoughts. Danugerous, not that Alph'on- i so was disposed to evil ; onl th? colntrary, i nothing was more foreign to -his character. But evil thoughts when harbored in the mind tor a moment only, may strike th-ir roots so L3ep that years will not eradicate them. The meditation of evil thoughts creates a desire for similar actions, and if they are never turned to shapes, seldom tail to viciate and degrade the mind. And yet, to do the self- deluded lover Justice, he would have scorned to inflict an injury upon this unfortunate man; more than that, he would have raist d his arm in his defence,-yea, fought for his deliverance, as a matter ol honor. CHAPTER XVII.  Evening came at length, and Peron ordered I a halt on the bank of a small mountain! stream that coursed away toward the east, and emtied its waters into the Tampico riv- . er. In the short space of an hour, where an  hour-before there breathed not a human be- ing, three score of canvass tents, pitched without the least regard to regularity, formed  a busy little town, inhabited by full three hundred souls, four-fifths of whom were flying from   imaginary danger, and runni-lng risks, in running from home. a thousand times greater than they would have encountered in the quiet and security of their own domicils. A8 when the column  was in motion, Peron and his company occupied the right which  rested upon the road, and Barbata the-left, nearly a furlong further down the stream-.  After supper, guards were stationed at corresponding distances around  the camp as much to guard 'agaiust thieves as danger- 1   O  ( ous enemies. And when the sun had disap- peared, and the round faced moon poared fourth her silent rays upon their canvass dwel- lings, and the spangled stars glimmered and, twinkled in the blue expanse, the weary mothurs, with their tender infants wrapped to their heaving bosoms, repared themselves to, rest and sleep.  Some of the young ladies who had spent the intervals bet ween supper and twilight in conversation and cards, when it became im- possible to distinguish kings from knaves, cast aside the figdiled pasteboards, but con- tinued tee interchange of news and senti- ment. "Captain Peroa has just informed me," said Mrs. COathedra, breaking in suddenly upon the chit chat of a group of young mai- dens, drawn a little aside so as not to disturb the sleepers, "that that hateful American is in our camp." **Holy Virgin! have merey upon us," cried several voices, and as many maidens started to their feet, astonished and fright- ened. "Don't be alarmed," cried a maiden quick- ly. 'He is a prisoner and guarded." "But he may escape," suggested a timid little creature, with a trembling voice. -0'Ie cannot,f- answered the maiden in a tone that smacked a little of exultation. "He is bound." This iLformation in a great measure res- tored confidence, by removing immediate ap- prehension. Still their thoughts and conver- sation were about this man, whom they re- garded as a human monstrosity. "I shall not be able to sleep a wink this night," remarked the timid girl just men- tioned. "Mrs. Cathedra ought not to have told us this fact," said another. "Indeed, indeed, I did it quite thoughles- ly," said the widow.. Perhaps she did, for it was thus she did almost everything; but if she had not already told it, she would have done it on the spot for she loved to publish news,rid was not very particular about its character. / "&amp;Well, and what is' there in that informa tion to excite emotions other than pity and   regret?" inquired Andronita Rapelio, in a voice so sweet and touching, that not one who heard its plaintive tones withheld her sympathy. - ----- "After all, it is a pity to see such a hand- some looking man in bonds, I will admit," said Mrs. Cathedra, "But the leopard is also, beautiful." "'Your csmp;ixisonis unjust," said Andio- nita. "He is handsome; you have said so. He is brave ; he has proved himselfso. He is proud; all witnessed his manly bearing in the morning of hisexhibition. And he is noble. "Perhaps I wrongly estimate his charac- ter," replied the widow; but you overate as much as I underate. He is handsome, and so  is the leapard. I cannot rid myself of this idea. And all the other characteristics you discover in him, I can find in the treacherous animal of which he constantly reminds me ; unless it is nobility, and I have'seen none of that." Andronita replied with animation and en- ergy. The color in her cheek was increased  to an extent, perceptible in the- pale light of the moon. Her accent evinced her ear- nestness. Her eyes flashed. "A stranger in a strange land and among strangers; that stranger a prisoner and bound; those by and among whom he was bound of a merciless enemy; gazed upon by twice ten thousand human eyes; led like an unruly beast to the slaughter; threatened with: death-at such a moment to move undaun- - ted toward his doom, bespeaks a true nobil- ity." "A strange sort of nobility/ replied the widow, with a sneer. "And wherefore strange?" inquired An- dronita, unable to conceal -her indignation. "At such a moment, and under such cir- cumstances as you have described, the Amer- ican did nothing the leopard would not have done similarly situated," answered Mrs.! Cathedra.  "If I admit all you assert," returned An- dronita, "I may yet claim nobility for Cap- tain Leonard on another ground. If, when  bound with thongs and doomed to death,. it is not a  nmark of nobility to walk the earth   with a firm tread, and return the look of surprise with a glance of defiance, it yet must be admitted that when the eye, grows soft at the sight of pity and the heart melts in the presence of tears, amid such a scene as we have all witnessed, there is in teat soul a true nobility." "'To undermine a dungeon and set a traitor at liberty, is that a sign of true nobility?I questioned the widow, witth an air of con- scious advantage. i'In very sooth it is, under the circumstan- ces of this case,' answered Andronita. "The mall of noble feelings gcorns to be enslaved, and he will ever use all honorable means within his power to regain his liberty. As to the escape of Rodamout, if the story I heard is true, I think his conduct worthy- of all praise, so generous was it toward his aged fellow prisoner, so noble was it, so disinter- ested." Mis. Cathedra reflected for a moment, but- unable to think of anything pertinent to add, introduced another subject, by the way of imparting another item of news, which affor- ded her even greater pleasure than taunting Andronita. "I have better news to communicate," she remarked, '-Captain Peron says Alpuonso and Olinda are also among us." "Among us?" cried -half a dozen at once. 'Yes, to be sure," replie t the widow. "I have not seen them," said the timid young lady.  "Nor I," replied -Mrs. Cathedra. Nev- ertheless they are here ; but they are pris- oners." "Prisoners?"  This too was pronounced by several. "For what are they prison- ers?"  **For helping to liberate Rodamont and that odious American," answered the wid- ow. "And do you call that;better newswhich tells of the imprisonment of friends?" inquired Andronita. "I expected some such question from you',' replied the widow, impatiently. "The pleas-" anthems of the news had no reference to their misfortune, but to their presence. ISurely fi  &#xD;<pb n="56-57" xml:id="VAC8064-00000030"/> is more pleasing to hear of their presence among us than the American's." "Did you see Olinda?" was all -the reply Andronita made to the widow's remark, though her pretty lips slightly curled with contempt. "I did not," answered the widow. "I should havb gone, but I was afraid of that bearded barbarfan, who is confined near the same place. Captain Peron proposed to go with me, and I was half inclined to go once, but my courage failed before we were started." "Point me the direction and I willgo," said Andronita, rising to her feet.  The widow pointed down the stream, and the maiden started alone in seach- of her friend-she and Olinda were particularly in- timate.  While she threaded her difficult away among tents and noiseless sleepers and clumps of chaparal, the company she had left discussed her character thoroughly-  thoroughly for them, but at the same time so ' indifferently that it would be injustice to both maiden and reader to repeat it in these i pages.                 t  Andronita had gone but a few rods, when some one advanced athwart her path. Re  was a man, that she could discern; and an  officer, for she could hear- tlank of his . sword on the ground ; blt who he was and how to avoid him, that was her uneasiness. But it lasted only for a moment. "Certain- s ly," thought she, ,there is nothing to be ap- 1 prehended in the midst of a guarded Mexi-  can camp ; besides, it is an officer of the ar-} ( my, and he is the soul of honor."  While these thoughts were swiftly cours- ing through her mind, she was quite as swi ft t ly coursing through the camp. But- unless r she quickened her pace to a run, she could ti not avoid a  meeting; and even then she i could not escape observation, while increased i speed would excite suspicion; nor was there a t place where she might conceal -herself until i ^ the unknown officer had passed.  Making a a  virtue of necessity, she walked boldly for- a ware in the direction of Morticr's tent, as if. lunconscious of the approach of any person, i until her name was uttered in a voice that filled her soul with gladness.     i   '-Miss Rappelio," said the officer, "whither away at this tine of night alone?" tIt is Captain Peron," said the maiden. X I am rejoiced." "Are you, indeed?" said the captain, with emphasis. I1 saw you coming, and was afraid it was 1sojce one with whom I was unacquainted," replied Andronita, doubtful of his man- ner. "iThen you rejoiced lthat it was I, only be- *cause I am not a stranger?" said the cap- jtain, with a peculiar significance of expres   sion. "That alone ought to be sufiicient to make the heart of a timid maiden rejoice," replied Andronita, not a little disconcerted. 'In this place there is no danger," said the officer. '.Oue so little acquainted as r am with scenes like these, might very easily get lost," replied the maidlen. "True, and I wonder to see you this far from your tent at such a time at night," said the captain. "It was but a moment since I learned that Olinda Rodamont was among us, and I am on my way to her," said Andronita. "Then let me bear your company," said Captain Peron. Andronita took his proffered arm, and thpv started forwartl together. No-together they started certainlv, but D t forward ; for Captain Peron led the maiden in quite an- other direction. Now she feilt the necessity of his guidance, and was thankful. 1 hey walked on in silence for some dis- tance, and the rivulet was just before them. The sentinel stood on the opposite bank. The noise of the water as it flowed swiftly along its pebbly channel,deadened the sound of the voices. The sentinel saw them, and heard, their converse, and tried to distinguish their. words, but he could not. Another saw them, and heard them  too; hfard distinctly, not willingly, yet, thankfully. "Are we not ipur suing a wrong course?" inquired Andronita, observing the rivulet - "Pardon me," said Captain Peron. 'I have conducted you hither purposely." -   "Then you have done a very improper thing," returned the maiden, apprehensive- ly. "If it is directly in our course?" queried the captain. "Your answer very clearly implied the con- trary," replied Andronita, detaching her arm and refusing to go forward. "Stratagem is permitted in love and war," said Captain Peron. "And out of place here," replied the-maid- en, with indignation. I  "You will not say so when I have unburth- ened my heart," returned the officer. "Then you anticipate a war," said Andro- nits, "for I assure you such an artifice is not likely to inspire love in me at any time, and more especially - my present frame of mlnd y "I could find no other opportunityv," said the captain, striving to conciliate. "The- deed is unwarrantable,'? she replied.  "You have forfeited my esteem. I cannot re- main in your presence."  "At least give me a hearing," pleaded the C officer.          / "Not here, or now," said Andronita.  u "When then, and where?' he demanded, eagerly.  P "To-morrow-any time   after sun-rise and I before sun-set; any where--in presence of Olinda Rodamont," she replied.  "You choose a  strange time, that is,. an o unusual time for such a purpose, but that is unimportant; but to the presence you pro- fi pose I must object ; I do not cnose to have all the world know  what I would utter to ,1 its divinest creature," said Captain Peron. "But I  choose to have Olinda present for 0 my own safety," replied Andronita. "I do not understand your fears!" said the a officer, illterrogativelv.        a "Y(ou compel me to be discourteous," said  I Andronita. "I could not consent to hear al what a  gentleman, who would deceive me as n you have done, might choose to say. except bi in the presence of his wife or bride, for whose if sake be would utter nothing unfit for the co chaste ears of a maiden."        ti "I know not what you mean by such terms he   r as wife or bride," said the officer, affecting I- ignorance. 'You do kuow, Captain Peron,' returned d the maiden, alnrffst sternly. "Pardon my boldness, but your behavior on this occasion - is to me an insult--to her a perfidy." n  "God is my judge," cried the officer, with a counterfeit solemnity, "'that I am actuated by the purest of motives." "If be were to Judge you for your faith- lessnees. and punish you for your falsehood, he would serve you as he did Annanias. Captain Peron," she alded, earnestly.  X I lave hitherto held you in such high estima. tion, that I am truly astonished." 'If you were a man," said Captain Peron, scarcely able to suppress higanger, "I could call your language insolence, and punish it, as it deserves. But you are a woman, and the loveliest of your sex, and I forgive you." "I am not content with forgiveness, I de- mand justice," said Andronita. "You must conduct me hence to Olinda, and promise never to broach this subject again ; and this you must do before I will forgive you your unworthy behavior."' "I will guide you to Olinda, but I will promise no more at present," said Captain Peron.  "And why not promise all I  ask?" said Andronita. "Olinda is the sweetest creature on -the face of the earth." "I thought so till I saw you," said the o f- ficer. "Say no more," cried the maiden, "or I shall despise your courtesies, as I now do your perfidy. I am ready ; shall I go alone, or shall I have your guidance?" Captain Peron stepped quickly to her side and offered his arm, but the maiden declined, prefering to follow in h -footsteps. The of- ficer muttered something very like a curse, and than started forward at a  quick pace . not exactly in the direction they had come, but so nearly that Andrinita almost doubted if they were not again pursuing a wrong course. But she dared not ask, lest her ques- tion opened the way for something which her ears would not hear with pleasure. To  &#xD;<pb n="58-59" xml:id="VAC8064-00000031"/> her joy, liowever, the course was right, and a [a u few momrnents they stood at the door of it Olinda's tent.             s But to their surprise and disappointment, tu the little narrow room was tenantlss. There was a bed made upon the grouud, a bed of tl blankets and swalols and bolsters, but it was ra undisturbed. They looked and wondered, g bua were sient. Presently the sweet voice b of Olinda broke upon the stillness, which had q already become painful to the disappointed c twain, in a merry, ringing, joyous laugh, q coming from a point higher up the stream, r and explained the mystery. They tacitly r came to the same conclusion, that Olinda g was away with the widow and her compan t ions.                  1 In the full light of that pale May moon, at  the door of the lodge of his own betthed.  Captain Peron was half-inclined to renew his protestations. But Andronita, fully deter- mined to hear nothing from his lips on a sub-  ject so unpleasant, took advantage of his hesi- tation, the true cause of which she readily surmised, and requested the pleasure of behol-1 ding the American. A spriglW conversation  ensued, touching the phraseology of her re- i quest. a pt. -Peron assured her that she was the first person who had slyied it a pleasure to behold the north- barbarian, meaning what the word truly implied, as was evident in her accentuation. She assured him in return that she was not prompted by idle curiosity, for that she really felt an interest in his destiny. Peron wondered-reflected--hiesitated--bt t at length complied. CHAPTER XVllI.  As they walked toward the prisoner, the- silver light of the moon shone full upon their faces, and for once coming events did not cast their shadows before. Sound did as much, however, for their foot- steps announced their approach. The sen tinel on dutv bv the side of the prisoner, turnted toward the intruders, stepped a pace or two forward, dropped the point of his bayonet, and demanded, not in a loud, but in a distinct voice, the object of their visit   a K an unseasonable hour. But observ- ing that it was Captain Peron, he made a siun of recognition and defference, and re- turned to his former position. The ear of the prisoner had also caught the sound of approaching footsteps, but he remained motionless. He was sitting on the ground, with his hands crossed beLind his back, and tied firmly to the trunk of a mos- quet tree, his face toward the east. He could not see his nocturnal visitors, but he quickly recognised the voice of Captain Be- run. The other voice, though sweet and musical beyond anything he had ever ima- gined, was to him strange. At first he thought it must be Olinda's, for who so likely to be the companion of the ambitious Captain as the maid of his choice. But closer attention led him to think otherwise It possessed an indiscribable something that filled his ear with a delicious sound, and thrilled his heart with an exquisite joy. He felt that he was -in the presence of his un- known sympathiser. To be assured was but the work of a mo- ment-to turn his head and raise his eyes i were .all that were required. Captain Leon- ard was a man-not slow, not impetuous- ? a man of moderation, He remembered Poor Richard's maxim, think twice bofore you speak once. He seldom acted without suf- t -ficient consideration; but when he had de. termined his course, he pursued it with promptitude. He was a brave spirit, and for t the right would have encountered any danger. But there was withal -a touch of pot0ryinhis composition. A touch merely; just enough- to make him prefer an illusion that called up plesanlt emotions, to a reality that might bring disappointment. In plain words, he felt that the woman who was now a witness of his misery, was the pitying angel who had dropped a tear of sympathy when he was the gaze of twenty n - thousand orbs of curiosity. At the moment ! he did not wish to feel therwise, and there- Ie fore the illusion was preferred to the reality, is coupled as -it was with luncertainty. It iq it very doubtful if the ideal did not afford a it i sweeter enjoyment than the real; ctrta L it   is, better was not deserved, and the prisoner remained motionless. *; Let us pass round and look at his coun- tenance,' said the officer. "You have never seen him?" Captain Leonard bent Lis head forward, until the rim of his hat completely shadowed Lis features.' He still clung to the illusion, and resolutely shut his eyes. But he. could not stop his ears; and he knew that- the maiden's auswer would reveal the truth. What that answer would be he could not eonjecture, for he could not conclude whether Captain Peron's remark was assertion or inquiry. "Yes," replied the maiden, "I sat him oil the morning of his exhibition." ,' Buat Captain Leonard was mistaken; for the answer left him still in doubt-it did not disturb the illusion. ( Is Miss Rapello satisfied " inquired the offic r. "Rapello!" replied the prisoner, mentally. *It isa pretty name, and famous. I could have sworn no plebian blood coursed throuj h her veins." N"Not quite," replied the maiden, to Pe- ron's interrogatory. ' I must charge that sentinel to double vigilance, lest this bear-ed foreigner obtain his liberty among so many helpless females." O how harshy these words fell upon the ear of the deluded prisoner! The language implied distrust on her part, and cruelty on his-after allshe was not his symp thiser, Yet her tone was soft and sweet as the notes of the'lute, and her vocie was neither faint nor tremulous. This seeming inconsistency excited bhis curiosity and mastered the illu- sion. He raised his head and turned it round, but the maiden 'had turned away the moment before, and he caught but a glimpse of her retreating form. But that was quite ehough. An hour's observation would not have made him better satisfied. It was his sympathiser, of that he felt assured. What did it signify that shF had charged the sentinel to double diligence? her tone was tinged with irony-not palpa- ble, unmistakeable; but latent-impercept-   ible to the untutored miud, and lal'f-con- ctaled from the keenest discrimillnation-in- viting hope, lulling suspicion. Such at least was the effect her words pro- duced. Captain Peron regarded then pre- cisely as he would if they had been u tiered by Airs. Cathedra. But to the ears of the prisoner thley were full of hope. lThey ex- pressed one thing, and meant another. What they expressed was designed for the ears of Peron: what they meant was intended for tihove of the prisoner. It was the drowning man catching at a straw; nay mucre, thie sha- dow of a straw.  Yet Captain Leonard, never for a moment doubted that they fore- bode his liberation. In this excited state of mind he continued to reflect,it might have been an hour, it might have been two, it maiglt, lave been longer. Hiis brain at length became weary like his body, and notwithstanding the pain occasioned by the cutting rope, he feil asleep. And in his sleep he dreameJ that the maid of pity bad come and cut his thongs and set him at libeity. In the joy of the moment he started from his slumber; for his was not the deep obli- vious sleep that separates the soul and body, and rests them both; but that fitful state of unconsciousness, when brain and sense half do their work, and manufacture dreams. He started from his slumber---but oh! how painful is the emotion that follows disap- pointment, when the enchanting fancies of dream-land are put to fligtht by wakeful reason! He started from his slumber-and how exquisite are-the emotions when the thoughts of sleeping moments are the 'sha- dows of the events that are coming! Hestarted from his slumber, and woke in the full enjoyment of his dream. At least, his hands were free; but by whom the thongs had been severed was a mystery. 'o hu- man being was in sight save the sentinel, who slept profoundly on his post. The moon was in tlihe south, and the sha- dow of a neighboring tree spread over the spot he, occupied, and a clump of bushes deepened the shadow almost to darlkness. Elsewhere her silver beams lay an the ground,  &#xD;<pb n="60-61" xml:id="VAC8064-00000032"/> bright as they ever did in MNay, and the tents, the horses, the sentinels, all were visible; of at course not so distinctly as at midl-day, but -in much too plain for one who would escape unobserved.               ed It was necessary to reflect and to plan; for which no place seemed so secure as the sa very spot he occupied. fie sat still there- be fore, and considered. Many courses sug-! gested themselves, but nont seamed feasible, re save one, and in it there was murder.  i w To steal upon the sleeping sentinel,-to rt throttle, strangle, and disarm, would require  but a moment, for one of Captain Leonard's  strengthof nerveand muscle. But foraught e he knew, that sentinel had cut his thongs, c and now feigned sleep.  He thought of Llewellif's hound-and the sentinel slept c in security. While he lingered, doubting, the shadow  of a person passed along the ground before  him and was lost in the broader shadow of the neighboring tree. At the same moment a man came out of a tent, dressed even to the cap, and looked steadfastly for several se- conds toward the prisoner. But the shadow and substance had no connection; the former had a substance and the latter a shadow of its own. The shadow of the substance lay beyond the prisoner's view, and the substance of the shadow walked behind him-and it was a woman, A moment after this fact was confirmed. In the same sweet voice that ravished his ear and thrilled his heart awhile before, he was addressed by name. "Captain Leonard!'" He turned his head, but in the shadow of the tree, gray as the shadow itself, the maiden stood concealed. ( Your links are free," said the speaker. "Rise and escape. Follow the course of the moon; you will meet with no obstruc. tionm            .  "Who is my deliverer!" inquired the pri- soner. "Stay not to inquire,' replied the damsel, with impatience. "'I shall not move until I know," returned the American, resolutely.   "Foolish man! to exact such knowledge at such a moment!" cried the'maiden, chid- ingly. r It may be my only opportunity," persist ed the prisoner, . 4' It is better that you should not know," said the maiden, earnestly, " for kindness has betrayed a secret already." ( You allude to the misfortune of Olinda," returned Captain Leonard. 'W-bhat I did was very foolish, I must admit; but I seldom repeat an imprudence." "But you sometimes commit new ones,"  said the liberator. You have tarried until escape unobserved is impossible. Hither comes an officer. ( It is Barbetta," said the American. "He comes to satisfy himself that I ami still se- cure. He will find me asleep." "Or, rather, his seatinel," said the maiden. But he will leave him awake, or a more vigi- lant one to supply his place." Further converse was impracticable, -for Barbata was now within earshot. He carae not forward boldly as a brave man of honest intentions; but stole along the ground with the noiseless tread of a cat, and approached f the prisoner in the tree's shadow.. Within a dozen feet he paused, to contemplate and B cogitate. t   He is alseep," said the officer, " and the guard is asleep. It is a favorable moment; I shall never have such another." ; 3  Captain Barbata, as he spoke, drew his e sword half way from the scabbard. But he quickly thrust it back, with a gesture of impatience." )f  ( This is not the weapon," said he, "another n must be employed, one that will not lead to my detection, or suspicion." r. He, turned toward the sentinel, who lay of sprawling on the ground, dead drunk and 3f asleep, his gun unguarded by his side- Bar- bata - picked up the weapon, carefully exa- i- mined the bayonet and then turned again to the prisoner. A1,  "Captain Leonard," said he, speaking in a suppressed tone, but one that evinced de- ed termination as well as hatred, "I am come hither in mercy to terminate your troubles.   If you were a Mexican, I should defer the deed until to-morrow or the day following, that you might be confessed; but a. bearded barbarian, without the pale of the church, and no friend to defraythe expense, hasi small claims on my magnanimity; andi) least of all Captain Leonard, who has injured me more than time would have done iu fifty  years." A brief silence ensued. The officer stood but a rod from the prisoner, and in his hand he held the sentinel's gun. He seemed to reflect. At length he said, "I know not what to do. If I merely gash his face, he may live to cause my death; and if I kill him outright, I shall have but half a ven- geance. If I could cover his visage with scars, such as that which disfigures my own face, and see him -turn away from the curious who always gaze at such things, I should be gratified; and after years of this annoyance, if I could then thrust my trusty sword through his bloody heart, I should be sa- tisfied." Meanwhle the prisoner sat upon the ground, his hands behind his back, his head slightly inclined on one side, apparently asleep. Near the clump of brushes in the-! deeper shadow, the maiden observed his in-  difference with dread not unmingled with disgust. She well knew that Captain Bar- bata was a desperate, unscrupulous man, and that he would not hesitate to put his wicked 1 threat into execution. Onceshe well nigh  betrayed her presence; it was when the offi- cer drew his sword. If the moonbeams had reached the prison- ers' countenance, she would have thought and felt otherwise; for she would have seen that his eye closely followed every motion of the assassin. Then- she would have admired the consnmmate bravery of the man who could coolly wait until an adversary was ready to strike the fatal blow, before he made a motion in his own defense; for she would have felt the power he possessed, and which he believed was to bear him through triumphantly. "I will run no risks,"- said the officer at   Ingth, speaking his determination hastily; ( he shall die." So suying he stepped forward, and stood immediately in front of the prisoner, within a tew feet of his face. He liftqed his gun from the ground, proved the bayonet again, seru- tinised the camp in every direction, then planted his feet and set his, weapon. All this transpired, and yet the prisoner had not stirred. There he sat, motionless as a statue; one leg thrust out, the other bent; his hands behind his body; his head in- clined. The maiden saw it all; saw and shuddered. When the bayonet was dropped to a level with the breech, she started and would have shrieked but for what ensued. It was so sudden, so unexpected, her cry was stifled-- stifled in its incipiency. The pris ner moved not until the weapon was drawn back to strike the blow;, then quicker than the maiden's cry, his extended leg shot out, and swept the space in front, and the cowardly assassin 'was tripped and thrown headlong to the earth. 'The noise awoke the sentinel, but not in time to save the officer who had made him drunk. Leon- ard's heel was upon his neck, and he crushed it as he would have done a viper's. "The American!"-cried the sentinel. The cry alarmed the camp. Each who heard it, repeated it; like the cry of fire, it ran -from mouth to mouth. "The American!"  But none who heard it thought of--the-prisoner, but of the victorious army from which they were trying to escape.       - The soldiers were enraged, and curses fe- upon the heads of the enemy like withered leaves upon the ground in the- monthst of ; autumn! Mothers and maidens were filled with apprehension, and children were crying and clinging to their skirts. The confusion was immense--the excitement unbounded. But amid all this confusion, Andronita was calm; amid all this excitement, shermas cool and collected. She hastened from ten-t to\tent, and published the truth, that the American prisoner had -killed Barbata'and "d.' And after -some time the exrcitement was allayed and order restored.  &#xD;<pb n="62-63" xml:id="VAC8064-00000033"/> The next morning Barbata was buried aE near the spot where he was slain. Captain ric Peron pronounced an extravagant eulogy \ Ge upon his character, false in every respect. bu He maligned the American prisoner, and, lit would have reproached his country had not a disapproving look from Olinda chec  f his utterance. Meanwhile the women wept, a the children cried in imitation of their me- i joi thers, and the soldiers crossed themselves' ch and cursed the fugitive. The scene pre- re sented a singular motley of rage and grief, bl fear and falsehood, profanity and superstitious i w devotion. ci CHAPTER XIX.         P The funeral services were scarcely con- eluded, when a messenger arrived, post- haste  from Matamoras. He had orders and direc- f 1 tiohs; the former from the prefect, and the  latter from the American Consul. The e orders alluded to all present, but the diree- i tions only to the fugitive. Capiain Peron  was ordered to escort such as preferred to go forward to thie city of Victoria; and those \  who-( hose to return were assured by the pre- j  feet, that the Americans were a gentlemanly people, and not at all disposed to do the  Mexican's injury either in person or pro- perty. The majority preferred to go for- ward, and Captain Peron, very much against his- inclination, was obliged to keep them company. It was against Captain Peron's inclina- tion, because an order from the prefect or- \ dered the release of Alpbhonso and Olinda, I who, with Andronita and about five score of others, preferred to return to their homes.- This, order imparted scarcely greater plea- j sure to the prisoners,. than to Morticr who was charged with their custody. The old man pressed their hands together in his own, and in the joy of his heart, weeping like a child the while, thanked God for their de- liverance.     i There was another order, directing Bar- bata now in his graver-to bring the pri- soner-now at liberty-that he might be ex- -changed for Captain Costa, who had become   a prisoner of war in the hands of the Ame- ricans. There were some directions fro&amp; General Taylor, respecting Captain Leonard, , but as he was already at liberty they are of , little consequence. As soon as all these facts were published, -rsarations were made, and the parties se- typiited; Peron, with those under his charge, I journeyng forward, and Mortior taking charge of those who returned. Each party reached its destination without unusual trou- ble or delay, though it was nearly midnight when the latter arrived. As this party approached Matamoras, a circumstance occurred that caused some ap- prehension. They were challenged by the American pickets, stationed near the ruin of an old fort, a short distance south of the ; city. Great excitement prevailed,-and but for Olinda, who explained the challenge to Morticr, dispersion and flight would have ensued. The sentinel on duty at this post, charged with strict orders which he dare not disobey called for the officer in charge of the picket guard, giving his number, which indicated his position, and enabled the officer, whoever he happened to be when the call reached his Y ears, to proceed directly to the post from which the alarm proceeded. The next sentinel, on each hand, repeated "the words, and in a very few minutes, the 3t officer arrived. A few words from Olinda explained everything, and all save Morticr and his command were- suffered to pass. a- These, by order of General Taylor, were dis- "I armed, but permitted to return to their homes. This little circumstance, so different from  anything they had expected, notwithstanding "I the assurance of the prefect, inspired confi- dence and respect. And this confidence and respect -were- never forfeited, although the three months' volunteers called into service e  by General Gaines,did very many thingsnot only inexcusable, but highly disreputable. It was several days before the other party pri- reached Victoria. Owing to the scarcity of ex- water, which was chiefly carried for many once miles in artificial channels to supply the   inhabitants of the villages and ranches on the road, they were obliged to journey a greater or less distance each day; in some instances ten, in others twenty miles, for the mules would have died had their-thirst remained unquenched. In the evening twilight of the third day after the separation, Captain Peron's camp was alarmed by the sentinels, who announced the advance of a large party of mounted troops. Immediately the guard were sum- moned to duty, and drawn up in battle order a little distance in front of the camp, to repel the attack. At first the -advancing force was supposed to be a party of Americans, sent in their pursuit; and the greatest consternation pre- vailed. But as they approached, the unmis- takable characteristics of personal appear- ance, corrected their impression, but with- out removing their apprehension; for they had scarcely less to fear from guerillas, large parties of whom infested that region of Ta- maulipas, and plundered all who were not strong enough to make successful resistance. The commander of the approaching party, observing the warlike attitude of the other, called a halt, and dispatched a messenger to communicates with Captain Peron; it proved to be Romanno and his laborers, whom he had armed to make sure the capture of An- dronita. With the mention of one other fact, the merchant will be left to explain his presence and the armed condition of his people, as shall accord with his motives of proplriety. The night upon which he and Barbata had concocted a plan for the capture of Andro- nitaand- the destruction of the American, as Soon as the latter had departed, he called to his servant and gave orders for his rancheros to prepare for the march. A little before daybreak he left the city, by a road and direction different from that pursued by the parties hitherto mentioned, and by a circuitous route, gained a designat- ed point fifty miles Irom the eity, by the following evening, at which he was to be joined by Barbaata, some time during, the next day.   But after waitiDq until the timne had tran- spired, and being wholly at a loss to account for the delay, and having withal, no very considerable conDfideuce in EBarbata, he resolv- ed to follow Perou's party, and ascertain the cause of the disappointment, It was after dark when he came to this conclusion, and most of his men had retired to rest for the night; but he was a man of promptitude and energy, and allowed nothing that might be controlled to interfere with his arrangements; so he roused his men, and set forward to the accomplishment of his purpose. "The same night you left the city," said Romanno to Peron, giving a different version of the facts above recorded, "I received a letter from my steward at Santa Barbara, informing me that a body of guerillas3 under the command of the infamous Gotama, had visited my ranche and carried off much val- uable' property. I immediately summoned such of my laborers as were id the city, and hastened thither, in the ho'pe that I might recover my property and punish the offenders.  "On arrival, -I found that they had fled in this direction, and I immediately gave pursuit. All day long we followed them in their precipitate flight, and at sundown the next day was in full view of them, we being on the hilts east of the road,-and" they in the valley of the creek at which you- encamped the--first night, distant about two leagues. "We minust have perceived each- other at the same moment, for they suddenly increased their speed, -and dashed a-way as if the fiend of destruction was upon their track. The chase was vigorously maintained and we were rapidly gaining upon them, whhen the shades of night obscured the valley, "In that; brief: interval between the set- ting of the sun and the rising of the moon, when, everything was enveloped in a thick darltkness-,they managed to escape- for when the mbon showed her face above the eastern hills, and poured her cheering light into, the dat* valley beneath, not a robber was vi- sible\ in: apy direction.  "Scouts were sent out on all the roads in  &#xD;<pb n="64-65" xml:id="VAC8064-00000034"/> the neighborhood, but they returned without tidings. So we encamped for the night, re- solved-to renew the chase as soon as it was light enough to discover the course pursued by the fugitives. "In the morning we were completely be- wildered. At the place we saw them last, the robbers had dispersed, and every one taking a course of their own, no trace was left by which we might even guess their ren- dezvous. After several fruitless attempts to fix -upon their course, the pursuit was aban- doned. "Shortly after a solitary footman was observed farther down the valley, and a cou- ple of men were dispatched to inquire of him respecting the guerilla. Bit as soon as he noticed their approach, he turned and fled at the top of his speed; whereupon I imme- diately ordered a general pursuit. "The fugitive bent his course toward the hills, and so rapid was his flight, that our utmost exertions were not sufficient to pre- vent the attainment of his object. A score - of my followers at once dismounted, and con- tinued the chase on foot, but their best ef- forts where wholly inadequate to the under- taking. "The reckless daring of the fugitive I have never seen equaled. Frightful chasms that his pursuers dared not approach he cleared at a bound, with- the ease and grace of the mountain goat.. From rocks that crumbled beneath his weight, he would leap to a firmer foothold.  And by means of shrubs not strong enough to support one half his weight, he would ascend or descend At pleasure, and withperfect security., "Perceiving the impossibility of his cap- ture by direct pursuit, I ordered those pofmy followers who were on horseback, to ascend the valley for half 'a league, and then dis- mount and inttercepthis course. The. move- ment was successful, though an hour and up- wards were consumed in the effort. But the / capture was worth the exertion." This narrative was made in the presence of all those under Peron's protection, and was listened to with lively interest. \   -- -  J WTho is the captain?" inquired Peron, eagerly. ' Captain Leonard," replied Romanno. An hour before the widow Cathedra had expressed her joy at the American's escape: but her accustomed cheerfulness had pcarce!ly returned before he was again in their midst. At the mention of his name she shrieked and shuddered as if she really felt the fear sne affected. Romanno'flew to her side and en- deavored to allay her apprehensions. "My love," said he, " be not afraid, he is bound.' "Your love," cried the widow, forgetting the part she was playing in her eagerness to manifest her indignation, " how dare you address me in such terms, after what has. transpires?" "I must beg to be enlightened before I can answer," returned the merchant. "Its -verf easy to affect ignorance,' said the widow, angriily, 'but it'don'talways answer the purpose intended." r I am  not conscious of having done anything to merit your displeasure," said Romanno. "Is it' nothing to violate your troth- plight?" demanded Mrs. Cathedra, with in- creased anger. "I do assure you,"' began the merchant- "I will hear none of your assurances," in- terrupted the widow. 'I have listened to too many already for my own peace -of mind."    "If you would but listen a moment," en- treated Bomanno, " everything would be ex- plained to your satisfaction." - To what would you have me listen-9" cried the beauty, fiercely. "To a confession of your own guilt? To an avowal of your own  perfidy? To an acknowledgmentf your own disgrace?"       . "I know not how or what to answer,"-said the-merchant, growing impatient. -',A little reason instead of so much excitement might enable us to come to an understanding. O, Velasques  Romanno!? cried  the widow. "I could never hlave suspected you of such perfidy. I shall neverput my trust in man." 'll7   "If you persist -n these accusations, and yet refuse an explanation I shall utterly fail to command my temper," returned the mer- chant considerably excited. "Explanation!" exclaimed the indignant beauty.  What called you hither? What induced you to leave the city? You talk of Guerillas and robbery; but neither has been at Santa Barbara. You know there is pot one word of truth in all you have uttered except that you have recaptured the Ameri- can. I cannot think of him without a shud- der; and yet I ought -to feel thankful to him, for he has innocently exposed your perfidy." "You have heard a falsehood,' said the merchant. ' Barbata has lied upon me, and prepared a. noose for his nec." "It will be of no consequence then,' said the angry widow, except in the hands of the resurrectionist."  "What do you mean?" asked Romanno  quickly. Captain Leonard had refused to  converse, and he was ignorant of the fate of his accomplice.             j ' Barbata is dead, as he ought to be," said a Mrs. Cathedra; "and he is in kis grave, 1 which is no more than he deserves."   5 "Dead or alive," cried the excited mer- 1 chant, "( he-is a liar and a scoundre!." 1 "That he was without much doubt," re- - turned the widow; " but in neither respect a did he equal his employer. But I will do e him justice in this particular. I have no doubt, if he had succeeded in his effort to kill the American, that he would also have suc- ceeded in the intended abduction. But his unexpected death not only saved the life of an unfortunate prisoner, but the virtue of an C innocent maiden. I believe he was capable ti of treachery, but I know he was faithful to a you. The next time you lend- yourself to n the commissionof such infamus crimes it d would be well for your townsafety if you a would stop the key-hole after ejecting the 'I servants."               ti Romanno, utterly unable to exculpate k himself from the charge, and equally unable m to excuse his, infamous conduct, abruptly Pt turned away and joined his fellows, wlio, at hb a little distance aside, impatiently-waited for g  the close of the excited conference. He w 5 ^   d named one of the principal of these, and gave il some orders concerning their repose for the - night. - He made an effort to speak mildly, but his voice was harsh and busky, though It there was notLing authoritative in tis man- t ner. This done he dismounted and gave his f horse ,to one of his servants, and then sat a down by the root of a tree to consider and t conclude. In this attitude he remained for , upwards of an hour, then rose with a deter- - mination, and proceeded directly to the tent of the beautiful widow, who received him with greater favor than he expected. A long conversatic n ensued; but as there i was no one present to repeat what was ut- tered, it must be omitted. But the result of their conference, 'which was of much import- ance to themselves, and is of some conse- quence to the reader, must be mentioned. Suffice to say, that notwithstanding all that had occurred, a complete reconciliation crowned the intercouse. The next morning Romanno   dismissed his servants to their homes, turned the prisoner over to Peron, and  proceeded with the expedition, The rest of the journey he and the widow rode side by side, apparently as happy as if nothing unpleasant had ever occurred to mar for a moment the pleasure of their acquaintance. And on their arrival in the city of Victoria, all differences were forgotten in the blissful enjoyment of matrimony. CHAPTER    XX. On his arrival at the capital of Tamaulipaa, Captain Peron reported to the governor of the department, and represented the prisoner as one of the most daring and dangerous men-that had ever visited the republic. He; j detailed the incidenta of his original arrest and subsequent escape from the prison, with \many bold exaggerations; and gave an- ex- travagant account of his escape, after havring killled Barbata, and - of his reeap'tre by RoL manno and his rancherosy after baffling'their pursuit for nearly five hours. All' of -which- had a powerful -effect on the mind'of the governor, who had beforehand- heard, bumt. with less particularity, of the ;exploits.'of  &#xD;<pb n="66-67" xml:id="VAC8064-00000035"/> this northern barbarian, as they termed him: and really believing him as dangerous as re- presented by Peron, he ordered him to be confined in the strongest prison of the city. The dungeon in which Captain Leonard was now incarcerated, differed in many res- pects from any other he had occupied. Two or three things are worthy of mention. It was below the surface of the"gronda, and the walls, floor, and ceiling were all made of stone, so fitted together as to render it diffi- cult to discover the seams by the sense of feeling, and so strongly built that escape without instruments was wholly impossible. i EHere he remained until after the arrival of  General Scott, whorordered General Patter- son with his division of the army to proceed by way of Victoria to Tampico, and there embark for Vera Cruz, which also formed, three hundred gears before, the base of the i line of Rernaudo Cortes' invasion.  As General Patterson proceeded on his  marbch, information of his approach was con- veyed to the governor, who, with his officers ofstate, fled to San Louis Potosi; but not until he had provided for the, removal of the prisoner to the same place. On arriving in this city, Captain Leonard was turned over to the military commandant of the city, who ordered him to be conducted to the army prison, and treated with becoming respect; and it was made the duty of the officer of the-day, to visit him every morning and see that his order was strictly obeyed. Among the officers of the Mexican army, it must be confessed there were some quite unworthy of the trust reposed in them by the city commandant; for they not only lacked the feelings of kindness and the prin- oiples-of nobleness which actuated their hu- mane commander, but were influnced by a contrary feeling, even to a degree of disobe- dience. One in particular,a distant relation of Pedro Muffles, seemed to take a fiendish delight in teasing and torturing the prisoner every time he came on duty. Hiee would give him hard bread without water, water impregnated with. salt, soup thickened with sawdust, or meat peppered with sand. As the officer of the day always remained   on duty twenty-four hours, it followed that Captain Leonard, who refused to-eat the day this officer had charge of the garrison, fasted once or twice a-week, from the breakfast of one day to the dinner of the next. To a man that is blessed with good health, this is i-a deprivation he cannot endure without in- tense stomachical sufftering. At length unable to endure these frequent fasts, and the abuse of the officer whose cru- elty rendered them necessary, he complained to another officer, and requested him to in- torm the commandant. But this officer, who b had more of the nature of M uffles than of his true-hearted superior, availed himself of the  suggestions contained in the complaint, and adopted a likr series of petfty persecutions. And these two officers so managed the de- tails thereafter, that they were more than half the time on this sort of duty. In this extremity, Captain Leonard be' thought himself of the efficiency of free-ma- sonry, which tad saved him from difficulty on several occasions and in different coun- tries. It chanced that the officer on duty next, after a day of extreme annoyance from the friend of Pedro Muffles, understood the mystic language in which he was addressed, and immediately entered into conversation with the prisoner, who complained of the conduct of his brother officers, and begged that he might he placed somewhere beyond the reach of their persecutions. The officer to whom this complaint was made, reported the behaviour of those com- plained against to the commandant, who ordered them under arrest for insubordina- tion and cruelty to o prisoner of war. The next day Santa Anna, who was then prepar- ing for the Battle of Buena Vista which was soon after fought, visited the prisoner, and gave him the liberty of the city on parol, and a purse of money to procure such necessaries and comforts as his condition re- quired. The ntxt day, as he was walking in front of the state-house, he was agreeably surprised to behold his old fellow prisoner, Bodamont, elbowing his way through the gaping crowd, whowere much surprised to see the renowned \        secretary embraceAthe bearded barbarian publicly and with the warmthof a genuine affection; which the prisoner returned in like manner, and with becomiog defference. The jtoy of the prisoner on meeting his aged friend, who withy the return of Santa Anna had recovered his former popularity and influence in, the Republic, was scarcely greater than the astonishment of the secre- tarv, who had heard a rumor of his death, while in the dungeon at Victoria, which was confirmed by Captain Peron, who was sent expressly to obtain a history of the details of his sickness and dissolution. The next day he was introduceed by Ro- damont, to the commandant of the city aud- Santa. Anna, with a brief account of all the incidents that had befallen him from the night in which he sought shelter on the Rio Grande, to the time the-earth opened in Mar- tilla's garden and swallowed him up from the sight of his pursuers. And at the re- quest of all present, the prisoner narrated the subsequent events, withholding not even his liberation by the beautiful Andronita. The general was so pleased with his-hero- ism and frankness, that he at once ordered an escort to be got ready to convey him to the advance position of the army of occu- pation. And the next day he bade. adieu to his dear devoted friend, who gave him letters of introduction to distinguished citizens of  Saltillo, Monterey, and other cities through  which he would have to pass before he i reached Matamoras, the place of his first  - imprisonment.  The escort which accompanied Captain  Leonard consisted of twelve persons, includ- t ing their leader. This person was somewhat I advanced in years and was called Lieutenant Ricardo. His personal appearance was not ] the most prepossessing in the world, but he  fortunately was wanting in those character- 1 istics that mark with shame the Mexican 1 race-cunning and treachery. His feature; I were much scarred, and wore a haggard un- ( couth aspect; but were nevertheless stamped  with intelligence and generosity. Not how-  ever of that kind that does a good and gene- ( rous action, in order to boast of it afterward The remainder of the company, with one ex- I ,i     "    ception, we shall pass by without further remark. This was a man who had by some means secured the confidence and favor of the cornnmander-in-chief, and by him had been placed second in command of the escort. Who or what hle was no one could tell, and as he did not seem by any means communi- cative on the subject himself, it still remained enveloped in mystery and doubt. In age he wras - vidently about thirty years, and his form was a perfect model of strength and symmetry of mould. His step was firm and buoyant, and decidedly military, which at once told that his training in the service, had been of the higliest order. Yet at times had one closely observed his every motion they would have noticed a kind of uneasiness -a nervous twitching ot the muscles of his frame that indicated an unquietness within. That he was other than he pretended, no one doubted, but nothing had yet occurred by which they might be enabled to draw definite conclusions. He was known as Guy Rominez. The country through which the escort was compelled to pass en route to the mnouth of the Rio Grande, as the intelligent reader who is at all conversant with the locality well knows, is wild and unbroken, and at times almost .impassable. The dense- groves of chapparal-high rugged hills and mountains and winding troublesome streams of water, were obstacles that were to be met with almost continually. - Besides these, the trav- eller had much cause to fear an attack from some of these bands of daring robbers or guerillas, with which the greater portion of the republic was infested, unless strongly protected by an escort; and even this, at times was insufficiient, as the forces of the robbers outnumbered 'them.  One of these bands, since the commencement of difficul- ties between Mexico ind the Unired States, had proved a source of much annoyance to both parties, and their leader, by hl hdaring deeds and almost miraculous power which had been often displayed in the -midst of bat- tle, had received the soubriquet of "Scourge of the Rio Grande." The escort which accompanied Captain Leonard moved slowly onward, and in the  &#xD;<pb n="68-69" xml:id="VAC8064-00000036"/> course of a few days had left Saltillo and Montereybehind them. Nothingof import- ance occurred which might prove of interest to the reader, until near the close of the se-- cond week of the journey. The day was slowly moving on, and the shades of night had began to hover around the terrestrial sphere, wrapping, as it would seem, the face of nature in a wreath of sable hue. The forests, which during the day had beealight, ed up, and by the aid of the bright and glorious orb, had been enabled to reveal its many pleasing and natural charms, wore a darkene I and gloomy aspect. Captain Leon- ard and Lieutenant Ricardo, between whom, during their journey so far, there had sprung into existence an intimacy, which was warm and ardent on both sides, rode in front of the -cavalcade and seemed to be deeply engaged in conversation. Suddenly looking upward toward the now blackened sky, the latter spoke. "By heavens! look up at that cloud. See what a dark and- lowering aspect it leaves and then bnark the purple tinges around the horizon. We are going to have a disagree- able hour, if we cannot manage to find some place of shelter, Romez," he added, turning to the strange and mysterious person whom we have already remarked as being his second in command, "I believe you pretend to be somewhat familiar with the locality, can you inform me where we may find shelter from the approaching storm?" "In your grave, most probably," muttered the dark stranger in an under tone, but im- mediately spoke aloud. O "A short distance in advance of us is the ruins of an old castle, and if I remember rightly, we may there find a safeand pleasant protection from the tempest, provided we are fortunate enough to reach it in sufficient time; but in order to reach these ruins, we will be compelled to traverse a long, dark ravine, which is said to be the abode of a desperate band of robbers, headed by the chief, Camile, in person." "What, the Scourge of the Rio Grande?" asked Captain Leonard and Lieutenant Ri- cardo at the Fame time.   d  "No other,?' replied Romez in a careless - tone, which sounded so strange and unseem- t ingly upon the ears of his listeners, that they - both turned and gazed upon him in astonish- 3 ment.  Noticing this, Romez remarked, t "yon appear much surprised, Senors, at my 1 language, or rather at my manner of express- ing it--but you need no longer trouble your- ! self about it. I have faced death too often; to tremble at the mere mention of a name- I though that name should belong to one of 3 the most daring and powerful bandits in Mexico,' "If you mean by such language to insinu- ate fear or cowardice on the part of Captain Leonard or myself-I throw back into your teeth the vile slander," exclaimed Lieutenant i Ricardo in a warm tone, for the sarcasm of the other had touched him in afender spot -bis honor and bearing as a soldier. The other made no reply to this, but a dark cloud of passion overspread his swarthy features, as he checked the speed of his powerful steed, and fell back in the rear of the escort. "Lieutenant Ricardo, what think you of this strange person?" asked Captain Leonard of his companion, after being left so uncere- moniously by Romez. "Indeed--I am at a loss for a reply to malhe to your enquiry," responded the hon- nest-hearted  Lieutenant, "for his con- duct appears most singular and unaccount- able. I am quite sure he is other than be pretends, but who and what, I am at fault. But this is an improper time for parley. The clouds are at each moment assuming a more serious aspect, and the distant muttering of the thunder warns us that not an instant should be neglected until we have reached some place of safety--some retreat where we may be protected from the fury of the terrible storm that now lhovers above our heads. Come what. may, threaten what will, let us onward and speedily too p? Few words more were uttered by eithier party, and the steeds of the whole cavalcade were urged onward at a rapid pace. In a short space of time they -entered a long and gloomy ravine which was no doubt the one spoken of by Roamez, which led to the castleruins where they   might hope to findgshelter, Even the lion- heart of Captain Leonard, that bad never a, get known such a feeling as fear, beat less regularly as he entered the dark pass. He could face the terrors of death -had done so a thousand times or more--but then it was openly face to face and steel to steel am d the roar and din of battle. But now it was different. He had cause to fear danger; but  he knew not from whence to expect it. It 1 - was with such feelings as these that the ca- E valcade entered the dark ravine. In the i meantime the storm which had been threat- i ening, slowly approached the crisis, when it I should burst upon the earth in all its power., i The muttering of the distant thunder at  each moment became more distinct, while the frequent flashes of the vivid lightning, proved a source of considerable advantage to our travellers, in pursuing their lonely way through the gloomy pass. Suddenly, they I were startled by a deep voice, amid the sur-  rounding darkness which commanded them tl to " halt.'"The next moment by a bright s flash of lightening they were enabled to see lf that they were surrounded on all sides by s( aband of mounted robbers. The words of b Guy Romez were not without foundation. ti A single glance was sufficient to satisfy Captain Leonard and the Lieutenant that re- S sistance would be vain, and would only re- m sult in useless bloodshed; so they determined  to surrender and calmly await their fate, fe whatsoever it might be. "What means this interruption?" demand- a ed Lieutenant Rlcardo, of the summoning -e party.                 e "It means that you and your party are th prisoners-so lay down your arms if you m would prevent bloodshed," was the reply of A one of the robbers, whose voice sounded not te unfamiliar both to Captain Leonard and of Lieutenant Ricardo.  "But if we should choose to resists' di  "Then the consequences are with you," Le was the reply.             h "Who *s the leader of this band?" asked i1 the Lieutenant,             de "Camile, the ranchero!".       rad "Enough-we surrender to your mercy," the responded Ricardo, as he threw down his to   i- arms, which example was immediately fol- lb lowed by Captain Leonard and escort. The s bandits secured their prisoners as speedily as e' possible, and having them strongly guarded, O so as to prevent anl escape, urged their steeds s onward through the dark pass, with which i they seemed to be well acquainted. In a 3 short time they reached the ruins of an old t castle which was evidently the one spoken of t by Romez, where the entire party dismount- ed, and conducted their prisoners into one of its damp and dreary apartments. In this uncomfortable place, they were destined to pass the night, while a strong guard was placed over them. It is here that we will leave them until our next chapter. CHAPTER XXI The long night slowly passed away and morning-bright " incense-breathing" morn, once more spread its cheering influence over the face of earth. Before the dawn had scarce visited the lofty peaks of the Cordi- leras, Captain Leonard and his fellow pri- soners were awakened by the sound of many bugles on the mountain side, the reverbra- tions of which were heard for many  miles around, being  carried from  cliff to cliff. Shortly afterward, the heavy trampling of many steeds was heard, warning them of the approach of a large body of horsemen. In a few minutes the cavalcade entered the court- yard at the same point where the prisoners had been conducted in on the preceding evening, and although they could not obtain a view of the party that  lad just entered, they could distinctly hear the words of com- mand that were given out by   the leader. Again the ears of Captain Leonard and Lieu- tenant Ricardo were greeted with the sound of that voice which had so startled them in the dark pass, when encountered by the ban- ditti on the evening previous. Captain Leonard thought it something very strange- h'i knew that he had heard it before, but when aid where he could not in his mind determine. In this mood he mused for seve- ral moments in silence  Suddenly as a thought seemed to cross As mind he started to his feet and gazed upon his fellow. nvryq- - -; )     -   &#xD;<pb n="70-71" xml:id="VAC8064-00000037"/> ers, who were lying aiound upon the floor of the apartment heavily chained. A single glance seemed to be satisfactory, and turning tn the Lieutenant he asked in a low tone, so as not to be overheard either by companions or guard, "Where is Guy Romez?" Is he not among, the rest of the prison- ers?" asked the Lieutenant in a much sur- prised tone. it He is not here," responded Captain Leon- ard pointing nrround at the forms of the mem- bers of the escort. "Then  he must   " the Lieutenarnt paused and seemed uncertain whether to pro- ceed. "What?' interrmpted his companion calmly. "I was about to remark that perhaps he had been killed." '; But your own heart told you that it was impossible," said Captain Leonard, " as our surrender was voluntary, and- no contest took place. But hark ye, Ricardo! I have a word of suspicion to whisper to you, and each moment seems to make it stranger, and affix the stamp of truth more fujy upon it. 1 am of the opinion that we have been be- trayed!" 'Ha! betrayed! and by whom?" asked the Lieutenant, in a tone of great excite- ment. ( Wlio could it be, but Guy Romez?" "But you must be mistaken, the Com- mander-in-chief would never have placed one so unworthy of his confidence in so import- ant a position," answered the Lieutenant. "So it would seem; but might not he too tave -been deceived as well as ourselves? and'moreover you are aware that the Com- mander-in-chief is not entirely the master of his own actions.  Santa Anna has rore minds to consult and wills to please than his own. Do you understand my meaning?" "I believe that I do," replied Lieutenant Ricardo, musing on the words of the other, "but still I am at a loss to account for it. You are aware that I have been more or less of the opinion ever since Romez has been among us, that he was other than he pre-   tended-yet, as I before remarked, I am at a considerable loss to attribute this act of which he is suspicioned to its proper mo- tives. Let me hear your opinion." "That is easily expressed," was the reply of Captain Leonard; * I think, and am now fully convinced, that he whom we have known as Guy Romez, is no other than--" s Who? ' exclaimed the Lieutenant im- patiintly- ;' Camile, the Scourge of the Rio Grande!" spoke a deep voice near them, which caused the two to start instantly to their feet, and turn toward the entrance from whence the sound proceeded. The door was darkened by a tall form, and the next instant an indi- vidual had entered the apartment whom we shall here begt leave to introduce by a brief description. He was rather above the me- dium height, which accounts for the desig- nation of tall, that we have given above. Hi's form was closely knit, and he exhibited much strength and vigor of constitution, copbined with a pliant and active muscle; his hair was dark and fine, and hung in loose curls about his shoulders, while a moustache of similar hue garnished the upper lip. A small green velvet cap adorned with a rich feather of sable hue, and bright tassels of gold, was set jauntily on one side of his head, and cast a shade over his otherwise dark and sternly chiseled features. He wore a short green Mexican jacket upon his upper person which was-also ornamented in a costly man- ner. His lower extremities were incased in a pair of leggings manufactured from the skin of some beast of the forest; while a broad belt was clasped around his waist, filled with pistols and daggers. From this also (!epend- ed a long Spanish rapier, the hilt of which represented the crucifixion, and was' of gold. His features have already been described in the person of Guy Romez, for he was none other than that mysterious person, who now stood forth in his real character and name, Camile--the "'Scourge of the Rio Grande." '-Ha! Romez! then indeed my suspicions were not unfounded-for we have been be- l traged 1" exclaimed Captain Leonard upon - the entrarce of the bandit Captain.   "Indeed!" muttered Romez or Camile, as we now shall designate im, "( then you have had your suspicions, I suppose. But it matters not what you may think, so loung as you are in my power. Now I desire to let you know my object and intentions in nralkirng you my prisoners. As for your compa I harbor no thought of malice towarthelm, and shall release them from confinent du- ing the coming day. Bulyou, you two, Lieutenant Ricardo and the hated American, I will reserve for a fate that the agoniz-ng pangs of a thousand deaths, would be a mercy, when placed in comparison. -To you, Jose Ricardo-ah! do not start-you see I know you--I owe a deep scar which I now bear upon my bosom, as a remembrance of days past and gone." "Then you are Pierre Gonsalvo, inter- rupted the Lieutenant, as he gazed long and! intently upon the dark features of the ban- dit. "Yes, I was truly that wronged person," answered the other, "( but do not interrupt my story, for I am no longer the one of whom you speak-I am Camile, the Scourge. i We were young soldiers together. both gra- duates of the same military academy, and en- tered the army at the same time with equal rank. We were then friends in the general acceptation of the term, but our natures widely differed, and so we each chose the so- ciety of companions which best suited our inclinations. It is unnecessary to particu- larise farther, the cause of our enmity is still . fresh in your memory, or I am much mis-  taken. I became enamoured of a fair damsel, and in taking some liberties with her-person, which-she did not seem to relish, secured her displeasure. The affair was placed in your hands for redress, which resulted in a chal- lenge and a meeting. The termination of the affair is also well known, to you. By some unlucky means you obtained a victory over me, and fled- from -the spot, coward ais! you were, leaving me bleeding  upon the  ground.  For thisI sworerevenge. Shortly i afterward I learned you had left Spain for Mexico, and hither I followed.- It is useless to tell you how I became the leader of this     \   brave band; but I assure you that it was only to accomplish my revenge. For months and years I have been near you, and watched your every movement-but until the present time I have been favored with no opportunity to get you in my Dower. My triumph has come at last, amni you shall feel the weight of my hatred I To you Los Americanos my hatred is different in motive, but not less to be feared. I hate your nation as I dread the fires of hell, and one of the principal objects of my life has been to wreak a -terrible ven-y geance out upon your people. Many years ago my father was crossing the ocean in one of your nation's vessels, and during the pas- sage attempted to excite a mutiny amniong the crew-many of whom were natives of his own country. Among the latter was a vil- lain who for some cause entertained feelings of hostility toward my father, which he so managed to disguise, that the other was de- ceivedd and revealed tis scheme to him; this was all the villain wished, and he imme- diately revealed it to the officers of the ve ssel The consequence was, that my father was mmediately arrested, and upon the landing, of the vessel in America, thrown into prison where he shortly afterward died. Since that time I have sought, on every occasion that presented itself, -to revenge myself on the hated people of your nation. You are not ignorant of my hatred toward the Americans, for since the commencement of hostilities be- tween Mexico and the United States, I have had many chances of exhibiting these bitter feelings that I harbor against them. 'Twas they who gave the soubriquet by which I am known so widely, the "Scourge of the Rio Grande," and I have sworn that my efforts should not cease for an instant, until every rude barbarian of the north, is driven from the soil of my adoption, -or buried beneath. its surface 1" As the bandit concluded his narrative, hi drew his tall form up to its full height, and casting  upon his prisoners a look of scorn and contempt, which is beyond description, strode from the apartment. "So then, it is as I expected," remarked Captain Leonard to his companion- and  &#xD;<pb n="72-73" xml:id="VAC8064-00000038"/> fiend, the Lieutenant, "Guy Romez and Camile, the Scourge, are one and the same person. We need expect but little favor from him. But why look you so sad and melancholy? You certainly have not given up all hope of escape?" "Alas! my friend, I can but fear the worst-we are in the hands of one who is as fiendish and ravenous as the wolf, and will not hesitate to resort to the most horrid means in the world, to wreak his vengeance upon one who may have secured his hatred. I have known this man, from childhood, and never has it been my lot to meet ohe so base andtreacherous as he. But you have less to fear than me; he may be content to let you die a soldier's death, but for me, there is no such hope: all the tortures that a wicked mind can invent, will no doubt be my por- tion. But I am foolish to spend my last moments in useless regrets--let me prepare to meet death with a calm resignation--as a man-as a soldier' "- Right, Lieutenant i" exclaimed the Ame- rican, who as our readers are aware, poss-s- sed a warm and generous heart that beat in nison with all noble sentiments; 411 let that one great desire be your guiding star, if the worst comes, be ever prepared to meet it boldly-if death stares you in the face, be ever prepared to meet it as a man, an I as a man and a soldier-for he is no true soldier that fears death in any form."  It would be unnecessary for u3 to detail the conver-  sation that followed, as it was of little im- portance to the reader, not being strictly confined to the thread of our narrative. So  we will pass it by, with the simple remark 1 that many plans were formed for escape, but E all abandoned as useless, while they-were so a strictly and constantly guarded.    1 About noon   Camile entered the apart- s ment with a body of his men, and released c all the prisoners with the exception of Capt. i Leonard and  the Lieutenant. These he 1 commanded should be thrown into the deep- q est and strongest dungeon in the castle to await his pleasure.           : The members of the escort were then led a forth into the court-yard, where everything c *' /    of value was stripped from them, and without arms or food of any kind, they were marched ; away from the castle toward Monterey. I Contrary to their expectations and wishes Captain Leonard and Lieutenant Ricardo were placed in different cells, and were not permitted to hold the least communication with each other. The dungeon in which the American was confined, was situated under one extreme corner of the castle, and from its thick stone walls, and damp, disagreeable atmosphere, he was led to judge that it was many feet be- low the surface of the earth. The walls were of a gerayiih cast and from the fact that in many places it was grown over with moss and other underground vegetation, hie could tell that many years had passed since the structure had been founded. Captain Leoa- ard was no poetic dreamer, and scarcely ever allowed his imaginationt o get the better of his love for the realities ol life; but he was a man of taste-and although of rough exterior he possessed a mind, which in one sense of the word, was well cultivated. His reading, and knowledge of the world was extensive, and he prided himself much on his knowledge of human nature. It is not'strange then, that the gloomy as- pect of his prison should recall to his mind, many events which had marked the history of Mexico, in other days. 'rhe old castle was evidently a relic of tihnes plst and gone; and Captain Leonard thought if it could only speak, might "a tale unfold," concern- ing the history and fa ll of the western world. His mind ran back into the aboriginal his- tory of the country, at the time when the glory of the Aztecs, was at its height. And as he mused upon their then happy and flourishing empire, which was destined shortly to fall beneath the power of Hernan- do Cortez and his steel clad followers, he felt inclined to -drop a tear of regret that the hand of ambition had been suffered to con- quer. In this manner tie day passed by, and the night came slowly on. This fact he was en- abled to ascertain from a small aperture at one side of his cell, through which a faint   -streak of light was enabled to penetrate. With the night, cie thoughts of escape, and he arose from his hard couch in order to scan the appearance of things about him. He had at different times during his impri- sonment in Mexico, discovered some of the many secrets of their architects, and he little doubted, but that there were some secret springs connected with his dungeon, besides the one at which he had entered. With these thoughts in his mind he arose to his feet and commenced a diligent survey of the apart. ment. After spending near an half an hour in search, which proved unsuccessful, he waq about to relinquish all further effort when his eye was arrested by the sight of a small hole perforated in the solid masonry at one side of the apartment. At any other time this might have failed to attract his atten- tion, but so firmly was he bent upon effeet- ing his escape, that this slight circumstance  convinced him that his first impressions in regard to a secret outlet, were not without foundation. With these thoughts in his mind, he  looked around the   apartment for some t pointed instrument with which to prove the E mystery. In this he was successful; a few t steps from the spot, he discovered a some- i what curiously shaped nail, which had evi- 1 dently lain within the damp cell for years, it a being much rusted and injured. This he in- ' serted in the small perforation before named, ( and to his joy  became aware that he-was 1 pressing against a  spring.  At the same u moment he observed a portion of- what had t before appeared the solid wall, slightly jar, rn and the next it slowly turned aside, -with a a creaking noise that echoed through the apart-  ment, and-revealed an entrance of -near two u feet square.  The moment that the opening ( was effeected, a strong chilling breeze cane p rushing into the apartment, which he was at it once convinced emanated from a subterranean a passage. - Hope once more swelled in the b bosom of Captain Leonard, and the vigor T that characterised his every action. returned st to his manly frame. He  felt onca more his s1 indebtedness to that all-powerful Creator in whoso far through life had preserved him b    froin the machinations of his numerous ene- mies. With such thoughts as these in his r mind, he returned to-the farther side of the cell, where a small lamnp was standing with which he had been furnished by the guard, whose duty it was to supply -him with food, and taking it ill his hand, strode back to the secret outlet. One nmoment more, and  hie would have entered the gloomy passage but was positively prevented by the sound of foot-steps approaching, his prison: With a quick movement he stepped baclk and drew the open door toward him, which closed with a creaking, noise, just as the door on the other side was thrown open to admit the guard, who supplied him with food and wrater. As- suming an air of composure that he did not by any means feel, Captain Leonard, turned to the man, who was evidently much sur- prised at the appearance of the prisoner with his lamp in his hand. "Captain Leonard is astir late," remarked the guard eyeingr theprisoner closely. "Why yes," replied the latter in a careless tone, which he could sa well assume. "I must acknowledge that I did not feel like retiring early. Butthe truth of the matter is, was trying to find some way to escape, not fancy- ing such-uncomfortable quarters as these," the senitnel was deceived. The bold carless air of the other convinced him that he spoke The truth! and deeming that escape from his cell was impossible without proper assistance, he was perfectly easy upon the point. Placing uponthetable, thatstood in one  corner of the room, a  jug of dirty water, and hard moulded bread, he turned and  quitted the apirtment, closing and locking the door be- ,hind him. After waiting for a few moments until all should once more become quiet,- C lptain Leonard again opened the secret  passage,d and in a moment more, had closed it behind him. HEe now found himself within a narrow and-damp passage through  which fbe only could walk with the greatest d fficulty. The walls were built of rough, unpolished stone and being covered over with moss and slime, made it quite disagreable.  It. was indeed a lonely place, for the only sound that broke upon the silence, was the low moaning  &#xD;<pb n="74-75" xml:id="VAC8064-00000039"/> of the wind that came rushing along the; passage added to dripping of water from the  rocks, and the sound of his own footsteps as,; he moved forward. Captain Leonard thought of his home, and -of his many kind friends in Ohio, and wondered if they were thinking of him in his absence. Then his mind reverted to his recent, captivity and several escapes, and with it came thoughts of the fair Olinda Rodamont, and his lovely sympathiser. He reasoned, that if the latter could have relived him in his present situation, surrounded by circumstance of the most embarrassing nature, her kind heart would have been overflown  with its tender gushings; critical as had been his situation many times before, he felt that it was now doubly so. It was true that he had escaped from his place of confinement, but be knew not but what he has only ex- changed it for one still worse. The ground beneath his feet, upon first entering the caven, had been firm and solid, but as he progressed it became more soft and yielded beneath his step. until he was compelled to drag forward his feet through a thick slimy surface which reached to his knees. Any one with less determination and courage than that which characterised Captain Leonard, would have given up the attempt, and turned back in despair, but when our American friend under- took a thing he knew no such a word as fail. He had determined to brave the worst and die inthe dreary passage, rather than return and place himself within the power of his ene- my. In a short space of time he arrived at a point when a flight of stone steps assented from the cavern. This seemed some what strange, - for he imagined that from the distance he had traversed the passage, that he was some- thing near a half mile from the castle, under which hisprison cell was situated. Deter- mined to satisfy himself- in regard to the matter as soon as possible, he mounted the steps and, soon stood at their top, when he found his farther progress, impeded by the solid wall. This only for a moment how- ever. By searching, he discovered a small perforation, similar to the one in his prison wall, and having fortunately retained the nail key in his possession he- soon had the   A; Ou, \satisfaction of seeing the pannel. open, and stepping forth, once more breathed the fresbh and pure air. He now found himself in a small house on the banks of th3 river Rio Grande, and as he had conjectured, some dis- tance from the walls of the castle. But Captain Leonard did not yet consider that he was safe, for he was not beyond discov- ery should his captors become aware that he had left the castle. Then he thought of his fellow prisoner for the first time. Could he leave him in the hands of the ferocious ban- dit, who had so basely betrayed them both? But how could he save him. He knew not even what part of the castle he was con- fined in, and to venture among them to search -for him, would be certain destruction. - He mused thus, and was undecided what course to- adopt, when he stepped out in front of the building in which he had before been con- cealed, and was immediately seized by two persons who had been standing in the sha- dow of the wall. Captain Leonard was again a prisoner. ;    CHAPTER   XXII. We will now return to Lieutenant Ricardo, whom we left in the power of Camile, who had sworn eternal hatred toward him. Upon being separated from Captain Leonard, as 1 before remarked, he was conducted to a deep L underground dungeon, in some respects simi- lar to that in which the American was con- b fined, with the exception that it was much cleaner, and appeared to have been at one time overflown with water. Upon making this last discovery the Lieutenant waq much alarmed, for he was a Mexican, and thought he could easily divine the object of the ban- ditin having him brought hither. He well 3 -knew that to attempt to escape was useless, I and that thoughts of mercy at the hands ,of ! Gamile, were vain, vain were he to ask it-- a- which his proud nature scorned to do. The - walls of the 4ungeon, as before remarked, I I were very closely built. and were lined with i ' a solid cement, that would resist an ordinary e blow, that might be hurled against it.-At e one corner of the room, was a small perfora- ,    .   tion in the solid masoary, which he judged permitted the flood of water with which the vault was at times deluged, to escape.- Lieutenant Ricardo was left without a single hope. To escape alone and unaided, was not for a moment to be thought of; and even if he had assistance, it would be extremely hazzardous. Captain Leonard, if at liberty he knew would make some effort in his favor -but he was confined lilke himself. To his follower who had been released by the bandit as related, he could look for nothing, as their cowardly naturewould not allow them to again willingly place themselves in contact with the dreaded "scurge of the Rio Grand." In this state of mind he mused over the many prominent events of his past life. Lieute- nant Ricardo was born near the city-ofVal- ladolid on the river Douro. His parents were not wealthy, but in respectable circum- stances. They lived by the management and culture of the grape. At an early age Lieutenant Ricardo had expressed a desire to enter the ranks of the army, and as his father had been in his younger days a soldier in tire  service of his country, his inclinations were not opposed.  Accordingly the. younger, Ricardo entered the service in the private ranks. In the course of time, he was promo- tqd,and upon his subsequent arrival in Mexico received the Commission of Lieutenant from: Santa Anna, by embracing the cause of that ostensible nobleman. Of his quarrel and encounter with the now-bandit chieftain before quitting Spain, the reader has already been informed in the words of Camile himself, when explaining his motives to his prisoners, so nothing further need be said in order to introduce: things  in their proper light. Lieutenant Ricardo was now convinced that by some means the commander-in-chief had been induced to betray him into the power of of his old enemy, and he partly accounted for it in the following manner. At the present stage of the struggle between the United States and Mexico it was well known that the forces of the latter were some-what di- mished by the recent disasters at Palo Alto and REsaca de la Palma, for the great force that was afterwards concentrated at Bue"    Vista and other points were yet in the inte- rior. Santa Anna,inconsequence, depended much upon the operations of his scouting par- ties, and guerillas, that were continually scouring the countryalong the Rio Grande, and often into the immediate vicinity of the American forces. One of the most noted of these, was that under the command of Camile the scourge. By some it was even- rumored that the commander-in-chief feared the power of the terrible robber, from some cause.,and always endeavoring to be found in agreement with him.- Certain it was that he depended much on the assistance of Camile, in carrying forward the assassin-like warfare which he was then waging against his more open and generous enemy. From these circumstances Lieutenant Ricardo was indluced to believe that Santa Anna, in order to retain the aid and good-will of the formidable ranchero, had- betrayed him into the hands of his most deadly enemy. The hours passed over, but the Lieutenant knew  not whether day or night reigned over the world without, for it brought no visible change within his pi ison- all was damp and gloomy.  Feeling wearied, he laid down in one corner of his cell, whore a small quantity oft straw h-ad been placed, and in a short time his deep breathing announ- ced that he was asleep. Not long afterward, a slight rattling noise was heard as one side of the apartment, and the next instant a heavy door creaked on its hinges, and admitted the form of Camile, or as he was first introduced to our readers, Guy Romez  He was dressed  in the same style as before, and the same demoniac smile rested-on his dark and sun- browned features.-  '-Ha! sleeping!'" muttered he between his clenched teeth. "But 'tis well--for me thinks 'twill be his last upon earth. Ricardo-my triumph has comeat last, and you now shall feel my rvenge! Long have I watched and prayed for this hour-and   how -my sol bounds to think that it has not remained un answered but" he added musingly, a strange and suddea thought seeming to cross his mind, - stopping -the current of his thoughts and turning them into .an entirely different channel " why is it that 'I feel 0o strangely  &#xD;<pb n="76-77" xml:id="VAC8064-00000040"/> when I consider the deed? It certainly can- not be called fesar, for Camlle has never yet shrunk from performing an action no matter how desperate it may be. But this Ricardo-we were friends together, once, and both sported on the mountain side, in all the joy of happy innocence. But he was mild and I was rash-I often became en- raged at him in boyhood, but he bore all my taunts and indignities meekly. At that time had he been so disposed, he might easily have overpowered me, for he was more than my equal in strength-and lacked not courage as I was afterward convinced. Wegrew to be men, and then from a cause but too well known to both, we became deadly foes. I cannot blame him for extending his protec- tion to a female-and that one as it afterward appeared, of his own blood O,-God! Ican never forgive that, while the blood of my father courses through my veins. Ah! my father, did I say? There is another vow to redeem-for my dagger's point has not tasted the life-streams of half the number of Ame- ricans, which the blood of my wronged pa- rent demands. But this Captain Leonard, his life must not be taken, for I have pledged my word to that effect, to Santa Anna, and the word of Camile, '-the Scourge,' is sacred. When I have got rid of my hated enemy here, and it will not be long, and sufficiently tortured the American, he shball be set at liberty and permitted to seek his companions of the North, and to them relate the story of the dreadful ' Scourge of the Rio Grande,' which they are pleased to call me. Now then for my revenge." Then turning to the form of the slumbering Lieutenant he mat- tered between his clenched teeth, while a frown black as night gathered upon his features;-"Sleep on, and dream of heaven, for there you must shortly go-and when there, speak a favorable word occasionally for me-your friend--Camile, the ' Scourge of the Bio Grande.' Say that Camile has almost completed his work on earth, and then-No! there- is probably some doubt, where I shall go to-so I had better not make any preliminary arrangements;" with these words, the impious villain, turned and ,     ,   disappeared from the cell, in the same man- uer he had previously entered. We return to Captain Leonard, whom we left in the hands of two of the robber band, Just after he had emerged from the subter. randan passage- that connected the river- ; shore, with the interior of the old castle. Finding that resistance was useless and would only result to his own disadvantage, he permitted himself to be led slowly back  toward the structure which he had just before quitted. In a short ,space of time he was conducted into the presence of Camile, whom he found surrounded by a number of his band, as though he was holding his council. Something of importance, Captain Leonard thought, must have occurred, for they were all apparently much excited, and Camile, cursed and stamped, as one would be apt to do when laboring under a fit of insanity. Upon the entrance of the guards and their prisoner, the bandit started to his feet, and half unsheathed his sword, but observing that the American was unarmed, he paused for a moment gazed upon the manly form and features of the prisoner, with a singular expression resting on his countenance. The next moment he stepped forward to his side, and placing his hand on Captain Leonard's shoulder, spoke: "By Saint Paul! thou seemest another Jack Sheppard, to escape so often from thy prison walls! Camile begins to admire the daring of the Northern barbarian, and is willing to offer him life and liberty.  What sayest thou American-art willing to accede to mrdy terms?" "Let me hear them before I answer,' res- ponded Captain Leonard. in a tone of as- sumed calmness, for his heart beat-high with hope and the consequent excitement of the moment.  "Ah! that you shall! Your- cdutr is engaged -in an unprofitable and un'- war, and sooner or later must be driven from the. soil of Mexico, or  exterminated.  Your people are brave, but they are unacquainted with the use of arms, and consequently 'are unfit to battle with the war-tried veteran of Santa Anua's army. The Commander-in- "r   chief is now concentating his entire forces in the interior, and will shortly meet your boasted Taylor upon the battle field, to de- stroy, his pigmy army forever. Take then my advice, desert his standard, and join that of the great Republic, and you may be preserved from an ignominious death-join my band, and you may win a repution and a name-both of which should be the high- est aim of a soldier." "So then, this is the terms upon which you offer me life and liberty," replied Cap- tain Leonard, after the bandit had concluded, and silently awaited his response, " on the condition that I will desert my country, and help to fight the battles of her enemies. That I shall turn the point of my sword against my-brother'sbreast! That in -order to'se- cure Aoor, (and such honor,) I will betray those who have stood side by side with me when the showers of death were falling thick around ns, thereby provingfalsetomy country, my fellow-men and my God! I see that you do not know the American cha- racter. The northern barbarians, as you are pleased to term them, are not so far removed from civilization, as to believe for one mo- ment that a true soldier, can be a bandit, robber, or murderer, without forfeiting all claim upon the- appellation. You say that your wooden-legged commander is preparing to exterminate our" boasted Taylor," but I am inclined to the opinion that in the battles of Palo Alto and B-esaca de la Palma he ] may read his future hopes of success. At 1 any rate, time will show whose suppositions are the most correctly drawn. In conclusion, I would say to you, that- if Santa Anna i whips our " boasted Taylor," he will have E to do it on more legs than one "    'a During this speech of the brave and fear- less American, Camile writhed beneath its cutting irony and sarcasm; and when the  last words had been uttered, leaped to his -S feet, for during the time the other was speak- - ing he had resumed his seat, and shouted to P the guards:               h Hoo! seize the detested barbarian and cl drag him^ence-if he attempts to spealr, p place a gag in his month. Away with him!" f A   s ; As his order was promptly obeyed, the banr r dit again resumed his seat and mutterud .- - "By Saint Paul I this man has the courage 1 and resolution of the devil! who would have t expected such a reply as he made to my offer. e I supposed that with the fear of death Ataring -him in the face, he would have calmly -con e sidered my proposal and accepted it on the - conditions named. -I hope that there are but few such men in the ranks of the Ameri- cans, for-should there be many, our chances would be but slender indeed! O that 1 had not given my pledge to the Commander-in- chief to spare - this fellow's life. How' 1 would like to place him down in the death- vault with the hated Ricardo and there let them perish together. But it must not-ng my word must be kept sacred.  But,":- the bandit frowned darkly, "he-my enemy, must not live until to-morrow's sun -shall gild the castle ruins-Ricardo must die!" - -amile-beware 7-spoke---a- deep voice near hit. The bandit leaped to his feet. "Ha! that voice again-will these warn- ing spirits never cease their visits, to terrify - me by their solemn injunctions?- Ever since the night when first I took shelter within its gloomy walls, I have been greeted with un- earthly sounds and voices so solemn and sepulchral, that it appeared that spirits from the vaults of death stalked amid the crumb- ling ruins to watch my actions. Can there be any reality in spiritnal manifestations? Can the immortal p'art of a human being, whose body has mbuldered in the dust, be permitted to return again into our midet, and retaining its invisibleness, ^tatch our actions? but it-, matters little to me-with -these unearthly .'-beings eIhave no business at present--mine is with- the living. GCa- mile was never intended for a moralist, or he would have long since been a prest Si ce heaven then-has formed me for anoither purpose, let hell make me  equal to it!lI have lived a villain--and will die one! - Thus saying, the bandit drew his -heady cloak about his form, and tollowed ibs dnom- ,pan-ions. (Captain -Leonard upon being led firw e  &#xD;<pb n="78-79" xml:id="VAC8064-00000041"/> presence of the bandit chief, waM conducted i by his captors to an apartment in the upper 1 portion of the castle, which he was pleased j to find much more comfortable than the dun- ' r geon he had before occupied. It was not  large, but was sufficiently roomy to admit enough air for all purposes. On one side of the room was a small oval window, strongly  protected by iron bars, that overlooked the valley through which flowed the rapid waters of the Rio Grande. Through this the prisoner could see that he was some distance from the base of the castle walls, probably sixty feet, or more. By sounding the walls with a small pestle which he found in the room, he was soon made aware that they were of double thick- ness. Escape seemed this time impossible.  Captain Leonard, for once in his life was at, fault. Always before, when in a difficulty of this kind, he was enabled to thiuk of some ' method by which to overcome it, but now, it  seemed all had deserted him at once. The apartment contained a rude bed of straw, and a table on which stood a stone jug, filled with muddy water. It, from ap- pearances, had not been used for some length of time, as everything bore the impress of time, and seemed as if it had long been de- serted by everything human. One thing that seemed -to attract the attention of Capt Leonard, more than all else, was the fact that every opartmenthe had entered within the structure, wore the air of a prison, and teemed to have heen built more for a fortress of defence, than a place of residence. The walls that every where met his gaze pre- sented a front of solid masonry that would have defied the efforts of all the combined prowess of the day if they had been brought againstit. Besides these, hen had already become acquainted with some of the mysi teries of the vaults beneath, and every mi- nute seemed more and more to convince him that there was a past history of the edifice ,that would,if disclosed, prove-as interesting as strange and startling. The vault or un- der-ground passage,through which he had came 8o near effecting an escape a short time btrce, was an object of much curiosity and   interest, and he meditated much on the pro- bable uses to which it might have been sub- jected in- days past and gone. The conclua sion which seemed the most, probable, was tha it had been the strong-hold of some party or banditti, during the feudal times, w en Mexiso was completely convulsed by the contending political factions that then existed. In such times as these -the subter- ranean passage spoken of was of tmuch ad- vantage, both as a mode of egress and in- gress, when the enemy was prowling about the court-yard to intercept those who should attempt to issue forth from the castle gates. In the same way, it might have been of-ser- vice in admitting contraband goods, con- trary to the laws of-government. These { were some of the numerous speculations in- dulged in by Captain Leon rd, as he sat in his prison. After having thus ruminated for l a considerable time, he once more deter- mined on a rigid scrutiny of the walls; he was satisfied from the sound emitted that they were double; at length he discovered a small crevice in the north corner where the two met, which at first had escaped his ob- servation, but which on closer inspection, proved to be a moveable panel, fastened by a strong spring; this difficulty- he soon over- came, and on opening it, he found it led to a staircase which descended in the vacant space in the wall to the very base of the castle, and by this means he made good his escape, while all in the castle were wrapt in slumber; his better fortune now seemed in the ascendant, for he not only escaped, but soon found the means of joining his former companions. CHAPTER XXIIL. On one occasion he met-at General Mar- tilla's the beautiful widow, now Mrs. Ro- i mano, who was wont to regard him in times e past with no small horor. At first she re- fused to be introduced, but afterwards cou- - sented. An hour later she was heartily i ashamed of her previous unjust opinion. e Before they separated she begat to think 1 him quite agreeable, and handsome for an   American, of whom -she had seen a goodly number from her balcony. And stranger than all, she complimented him highly-,on behalf of his beard, which she had described to some pl rsons, under other circumstances, as ugly, frightful, hideous, detestable. Meanwhile many changes had talken place. Alphonso and Olinda had daily advanced in Iove, anI Captain Peron would not have been indifferent to this growing attachment, if his thonghts had not been otherwise em- ployed, and his affections otherwise engaged. From Victoria he returned immediately on having discharged his duty, and since he came back had done but little else than make love to Andronita. As to Captain Leonard he had inquired of Olinda, who the maiden was that commis- serated his sluffleringo with tears on the day  of his exhibition, but Olinda did not know. He asked Mrs Romano, and' she did not  know. "Do you know a maiden whose name is  Rapello?" inquired the Captain, surprised to think no one had witnessed the tears that , controlled his destiny. Captain Leonardo did- not know that his sympathiser and deliverer were identical; he felt thatthey must be,and that was all. One he had seen, and her tears; the other he-had heard, and by her assistance had gained his liberty, and eventually saved his life. Ra- s pello was the name of his deliverer; she de- -r served his thanks; and then she might be the object of his search. "Yes," replied Olinda. "Mr. Ambrosia's t niece is so named-Andronita Rapello; but , surely it is not she you mean?". "It may be,"- said - Mrs. Romano, " she a was at my house the day the monster was shown." This was said playfully and was accompanied with a smile.        ( "It cannot be," said Olinda. a She is but a child; I mean in years, for she is a C sage in thought. I love her dearly, for she is a true woman. And she is kind, but-not -h tender; I never saw her weep, if she could, ,. she would not at such a moment."  , "The girl I mean is tall, straight, slender, pliant, and extremely youthful," said Capt. p \    . .   Leonard. "H r hair hangs about her nece and temples in loose flowing curls; her face is exceedingly handsome, and her features well-proportioned; her complexion transpar- ent, glowing and almost Saxon; her eyes are soft in their expression, like the gaselle's, which they strongly resemble in size and lustre. Do I describe Andronita?" "Yes, and perfectly," answered Olinda. "But I am astonished she never wept before --tears, I mean. Whatever her heart may have suffered in contemplating human misery, never did it manifest itself in this wise. She is a strange compound--soft and gentle as a woman, firm and fearless as a man. Understand me rightly, it is her na- ture to be the woman in a-ll things; yet, if occasion require, she can act a manly part, if that part is heroic." -"I know another after this sort," said Captain Leonard.  He would have added something more, if he had not been inter. rupted. 't She may be of this sort,' said Olinda, quietly, understanding whom he meant, ' but a very feeble type of the character, which Andronita so completely represents." "Do you know -Miss Rodamont, that I greatly admire what I have seen of this young lady?" inquired the American. "She would be dull indeed 'who did not suspect as much from your conversation," replied Olinda.  Do  your know that I have reason to be grateful to this fair creature for a manifesta- tion in my favor of that heroic -manliness which younsag constitutes the under current of her character?" continued Captain Leon- ard. "I do not," replied Olinda. "Then she has not told you?"Vasked-.the Captain, surprised, ' She has told me   nothing," answered Olinda. "What ras there to tell?" -  Pid it never ocur to gour-miad -to inquire how the thongs of the prisoner come to be severed on that particular night?'. said the American. "Yes, and often. too, then and since'rer- plied Olinda. "And now I can- comprehend  &#xD;<pb n="80-81" xml:id="VAC8064-00000042"/> why Andronita was so composed in the midst of the tumult, so collected amid the distraction." - Is she so very young as she appearsr' inquired the Captain; "She is but eighteen," replied Olinda 4' Eighteen!" repeated the American. A pause ensued! Captain Leonard re- flected. Olinda and the widow observed hi- thoughtfulness; they glanced at each other. but neither spoke. The pause was brief, and was broken by the Captain, who talked to himself. abstractedly. "Eighteen!" he repeated. "There is a' great discrepancy; is it too much?" The Captain, it will be observed, by the, reader, was comparing the maiden's age , with his own; but Olinda understood the  language as applying wholly to Androbita. '4 You think, then," said she, " that her appearance is younger than herself?" I think,' said the Captain, blushing, as he recollected his language, " that there is a slight discrepancy; she lookIs to be no more than sixteen." "It is her flexible form and transparent complexion that gives her so youthfulan appearance," said Olinda. "She is more the woman than she seems." "ZEighteen!" repeated the captain. "In that many years women mostly pass through three distinct phases of -existence-the days of infancy, the days of instruction, and the days of flirtation. What is Andronita's history?" In the first period she lost her parents, and found a home with the kind-hearted Am- brosia, the second period was spent in San Louis Potosi, and has just concluded; the third, therefore, has not yet elapsed, and I think I may promise Captain Leonard a share in the pleasures." It was thus Olinda answered. At the moment, Captain Leonard gave her zconcluding words -but little attention; afterward, however, when he recalled them, and the look by which they were accompam nied, they seemed to have a significance which he had entirely overlooked. But , \   what they could mean he could not well con- jecture. With this subject uppermost i, ihis mind, he set out that afternoon for the residence of Androuita. The Alcaide lived on the Texas side of the Rio Grande, about five miles from Matamoras. He owned a large tract of land, upon-which lived some four-score families, whose rude dwellings were clustered together under the name of San Augustine. His own house was a large adobe building, fronting toward the north; the roof covered -with flat tiles, forming a promenade, and protected by a balllustrade the height of a woman s elbow. Behind the house was a i spacious garden, surrounded by a wall of ! brick, and full of tropical trees.--orange, -lemon, lime, fig, citron, tamarind, palm, and pommegranate. At San Augustine Captain Leonard had a warm reception. Ambrosia, though not a great, was a good -man. lIe was glad to see the American; he said-so, and a good man utters no falsehood. His manner was kind eAnd demonstrative, and his language flattering. The Captain was accustomed to compliments, and could return them; and on this occasion he did, mingled with repeated thanks.; - They discussed, in a very friendly manner, all the little incidents, pleasant and unpleasant, which had transpired since the Flying Cloud put into the Rio Grande for shelter from the storm. An aillusion to this circuistance indueed the Captain to- inquire the fate of his vewsel, which had been confiscated. This -fact he knew, and had known for weeks; but-,he  also knew that the schooner, unless by pur- pose or accident destroyed, was somewhere /in the waters of Mexico. Ambrosia bad the required information, and he gratified the inquirer. The Fiying Cloud was at 'Alvorado.  -  -After this conversation, Ambrosia pro- posed a walk, and he and his guest strolled out into the village, to look at the people and their dwellings. Captain Leonard felt I butlittle interest in either. nevertheless he listened patiently to all that Ambrosia had to- say respecting them. It is written pa-   tiently, and patientiit was so far as appear- ances was concerned, but patiently it was not in, reality. Captain Leonard, though his manner evinced anything else, was ex- ceedingly anxious to return. At length the round was accomplished. Their steps were about to be retraced; they  had turned their face toward the mansion, on the top of which Captain Leonard dis- tinctly saw two persons, the one a man, and the other a woman. He was too far off to distinguish, but he felt that one was Andro- nita, and the other a suitor. The thoughts made him miserable. He began inwardly to deplore his fate; he regretted that he had left Matamoras, for there he -could have thanked Ambrosia, as well as at his own, house. But this was not the, object of his 1 visit, though he intimated as much to the Alcalde, and tried to deceive his own mind intothe same belief. Before they had proceeded many steps, j the twain upon the- house-top descended out! of sight, and who the gentleman was, he was left to conjecture. On their return to the house, Ambrosia conducted his guest to the dining-room, where tea was prepared. Mrs.  Ambrosia, a very agreeable, Iddy-like, man tronly. woman of fifty, having In this respect some ten years the advantage of her good , husband, (whose hair was quite gray with, the frosts of sixty,) was the hostess on this occasion. The conversation turned upon books and authors, and those of Spanish origin were, chiefly discussed. The Captain was fami- liar with, many such, and the conversation was agreeable. Still he could not but think how mnuch more pleasant it would be to con-: verse on these topics with one who belonged under that roof, yet was not present. He had but a small appetite, on that occasion , and it was easily satisfied; the meal wag soon dispatched. After supper, Ambrosia proposed a walk inhis garden. But scarcely had they got cleverly beyond the door, when the Alcalde's presence was required at the front, of the house. He excused himself, told the Captain to follow the main walk, and promising to   join him presently, hastened away to obqy the summons. Captain Leonard followed the directions ' until he reached the termination of the walk, ! where he waited some minutes for his com- panion and guide; But growing weary, .w turned out into a narrow side path. which wound away to another and more distant portion of the garden. As he walked aloog, musing, he heard human voices close at hand and directly in front of him. The speakers were concealed from view, but he instantly recognized the voices of Andronita and Capt. Peron. "In that you are greatly mistaken," said the latter. I "I do not know that I am," replied the I former. "I have not forsaken Olinda." said the officer. "Then why are you not with her?" i- quired the maiden. ( She has forsaken me," returned Peron. "And you came hither because forsakent' said Andronita, disdainfully. "There is nothing on earth so dear that I would not forsake for your sake," said the officer; ( but I have been-obliged to forsake nothing, and therefore guiltless of the ayt- posed perfidy." "Guiltless ii act, certainly; but not guilt less in thought and will to do the deed Ahd it been necessary, if what you say is tram rejoined Andronita. a Incorrigible creature I why will you ttlh willfully pervert everything I ntter?" ri lr Peron, with impatience and vexation. "Because I do not believe the half," an- swered the maiden, frankly but severely. "But you must believe," .returned the officer, with a strong-accent upon the m iliary. "How can I "   demanded Andronth quickly. "Yon are betrothed to- OliH4 sand the engagement is not broken, nor do (you design it shall be if your prent4t- tenpts are unsuccessful. - But epaulettes and a sword have not such a cm in xy et, as would ever induce me to step betwen another and happiness; nor could I ever  &#xD;<pb n="82-83" xml:id="VAC8064-00000043"/> be persuaded for their sake, to wed a man who could prefer another to Olinda Ro- damonnt." "Andronita," said the officer, with in- creased firmness, "I have now let you go on, until I am wearied." "I am heartily glad of it," answered the maiden quickly; " perhaps I shall have less trouble in future." 1 say I am wearied," repeated the officer impatiently. "You must decide this mat- ter, here and at once." 4 Captain Peron," replied the maiden, earnestly, "on two other occasions I have told you as plainly as language could tell, that I would never be your wife; and you persist to no purpose. This I have also told my uncle, who favors your suit, in spite of your engagement with. Olinda;. te only thing I ever knew him to do that did not meet the world's approbation. He- once hinted at services rendered him by your father, and I can account for his strange demeanor toward yourself and me on no other ground than gratitude. But I con- ceive that the deeds of your father, however mush they may have benefitted my uncle, is no reason why the niece of the latter should checome the wife of the former's son-aside from every other consideration " s And do you adhere to this determina- tion?" said the officer in a low but firm voice?"Refleet before you answer," " If I could have had my way, I had been saved this trial; but my uncle prefers you for a nephew, and you know it, and I am made to suffer in consequenee. To day I have seen you, by special agreement, for the last time under such circumstances; and I tell you again, and this once for all, that I -will never be the wife of Captain Peron." "Enough!" said the officer. "I had hoped that it might be accomplished without vio- lence; but I see that is impossible," As-he spoke, he stepped toward Andronita who stood a pace or two from him,-and threw out his arms to encircle her waist. The maiden turned to fly, and was immedi- ately confronted by a rough-looking soldier, who prevented her escape. Shrinking from,   A; go,' a contact with the latter, she came again fall within the power of the officer, who again stretched forth his -hand and would -bave accomplished his purpose, bad nota voice in a tone of thunder cried, almost in his very ear, 'Desist!"And tt;e next moment Capt. Leonard stood by the side of the damsel. 'The soldier fled, but Captain Peron drew bs sword. Since his liberation, to guard against assassination, which he had just -reason to fear, Captain Leonard had carried pistols constantly; and before the disappoin- ted officer could make the challenge, one of Colt's deadly six-shooters stared him full in the face. On seeing which he turned quickly and followed the soldier. '*Miss Rappello," said Captain Leonard, bowing to the maiden, "may I have the honor of guarding you to a place of greater safety?" "Captain Leonard," cried the maiden joy- fally, "how thankful I am for your-timely and fearless interposition. Yes, most confi- dently will I place myself under your pro- teetlon." Captain Leonard offered his arm, which the maiden accepted; and they walked quick- ly forward and entered the house. The sud- den entrance of Andronita, leaning on the arm of the American, her face pale and her lips quivering, frightened her aunt, who ut- tered an exclamation of surprise, and called lustily for her husband, who entered the room in a twinkling. Andronita was very much agitated, and it devolved upon Captain Leonard to explain the cause. This he did in a few words, merely stating that a brief conversation pre vented the attempted act of outrage, leaving his own interference to be inferred. Here the maiden t6ok up the thread of the narrative, and described Capt. Leonard's promptitude and bravery, with artless fidelity and an apparent unconsciousness of his pres- ence. "How good a friend you have proved yourself," said the-alcalde, embracing him warmly. "And how base an ingrate Captain Perob has proyed himself," said his wife, who had   never been pleased with Andronita's suitor, and never consented to their union. This remark had a peculiar -.ff ct upon the alcalde, then in the midst of his trans- port. He at once left off embracing the American, and -a dark heavy frown settled upon his brow, while his mind revolved the incidents of -the past. At length he started, as from a broken sleep, and gazed wondering- ly at his wife and thn-overs. "Is hp such a villian?" cried the astounded man. "Elave I been so basely imposed upon? His father was a man of honor, and a gen le- man in fact. How different the son! He, it seems, is but a gentleman in appearance, and a villian at heart. I will be revenged. Captain Leonard, I summon your assistance. He must be captured." "I am at your service," replied the Amer- ican; "but I apprehend," he added, observ- ing that his benefactor was making immedi- ate preparations to execute his purpose, "there is no particular haste required. It  is now almost dark, and they are far enough  beyond our reach." "O, no," returned the alcalde, his anxiety increasing with his anger, "they are in the garden, and must be taken without delay. I will call some of my men to our assist ince." It is quite unnecessary*" said Capt. Leon- ard. "They have already escaped from your enclosure; . I saw them as we were hastening toward the house, climbing over the wall near where the incident transpired. There were three beside Peron whom I saw, and there might have been others." This information surprised the alcalde. scarcely less than the villanous conduct of the captain of musketeers; for the walls of his enclosure were built high and the surface on eaeh side made smooth, to prevent the ingress and egress of marauders, and the theiving portion of his own community. Knowing' that -it was quite impossible for any one to gain the opposite, without a lad- der or some other assistance. he proposed an examination of the premises at and near the spot where the escape was effected. If there were any doubt of Peronas guilt lingering in the mind of the alcalde, they   were speedily removed by the examination; which disclosed in the wall, on both sides, a series of notches, which served for steps about two feet apart, which enabled the I kidnappers to escape unmolested, and clearly l established the evil intentions of the pre- ; tended lover. Highly incensed at this addi- , tional evidence of the guilt and ingratitude of the man whose suit he had constantly favored, the white-haired old gentleman in- dulwed in a tirade of execration such as had not .before occupied his lips since the reckless days of his boyhood. On returning to the House, he wert di- rectly to his library, where he remained un- -til he had written half-a-dozen letters, one of 'which was addressed to Rodamont, and another to Santa Anna, in both of which Peron's behavior was represented in the blackest possible colors. The others were directed to officers of his own rank, request- ing them to take any necessary steps to arrest the offender, and to keep himrh in custody subject to the orders of the Commander-in- chief of the forces of the-Republic. These missives he dispatched immediately by mes- sengers, mounted on horseback, and ordered to lose no time in conveying them to their destination. CHAPTER XXIV. Let us now return to the unfortunate R- cardo whom we left in an underground cell in the castle, in the power of his revengeful enemy, Camile, the "Scourge, of the Rio Grande." Night, silent and gloomy night, came once more, but with it came' not hope to the pri- soner; -he had quietly resigned himself to his fate. At this time, Camile, the Bandit cap- tain, emerged from his apartment, and care- I fully examining who of his brave- band were awake, proceeded to the edge of the- moat that surrounded the castle. -The-oiatthe  reader is probably aware, is a kindd of chan- nel or canal filledwith water, which was in feudal times, placed around on the outside walls of a castle, as a protection agiinst the assaults of an enemy. Over this ws a  &#xD;<pb n="84-85" xml:id="VAC8064-00000044"/> drawhridge, which could at any moment be raised, or let down at the will of the inmates. When the drawhridge was raised and the portcullis shut down, it presented an insur- mauntable barrier to those who meditated harm against those within, When Camile arrived upon the brink of the moat, he paused for an instant, and seemed to reflect and consider. Th re was audark scowl upon his fiercely chiseled fea- tures, that told his mind was bent upon committing some terrible act. As he paused, he thus gave utterance to his thoughts, in the following soliloquy:- The time has now come, for the consum- mation of my revenge. But why do. I hesi- tate-? Is he not my enemy still? When he basely struck me to his feet, in a duel, did he not coward-like turn and fly from the spot, in order to avoid detection, thinking that I had been slain? But then I cannot deny that he had sufficient cause for the act; for had I been similarly situated I would probably have done as he did, or worse-for I would not have quitted the spot until I was per- fectly satisfied that life was extinct. But that wound H can never forgive or forget, while life remain! Jose Bicardo, thy time has come I within a step of me lies the key of thy fate-one simple turn of -my hand-, and your soul is in eternity! my triumph has arrived at last Pierre Gonsalvo -is REVENGED!" So saying the bandit stepped forward, and -kneeling down, with the point of hin dagger removed a small stone from out the ledge, that formed the support to the embankment around the moat; this being done, disclosed- a smail iron ring that connected with the tube leaning to the water-vault beneath the castle, in -one of which was confined the Lieutenant. The bandit grasped it firmly in both htands-but for an instant paused. It was an awful moment 1 one slight turn of the rags which .Camile now held in his hand and the water in the deep moat would have been turned aside into the subterranean channel, and the unfortunate prisoner buried in the flood. This iWas the- revenge meditated by the terrible bandit.   At the moment the above was taking place, the Lieutenant was lying in his gloomy cel- asleep. Despair had long since twined itself around the heart of the unfortunate soldier, and after many sleepless hours he had at last fell into a gentle dose. How long he had slept he knew not, for while in the midst of pleasant dreams and happy visions, he was suddenly aroused by the sound of rushing water. In an instant he started to his feet. and the next moment his already excited sus- picions were confirmed, as the flood came rushing into his prison through the aperture already described; Ricardo felt that he was lost. He was not ignorant of this mode of murdering prisoners, for the stratagem was not an uncommon one in Spain--and in some parts of Mexico he well knew it was the work of Camile. Ia a moment the flood had covered the floor of the cell, and rapidly began to rise. -The Lieutenant shouted with all his might, but he might as well have at- tempted to have made himself understood through a solid stone as the walls of his prison. Soon the water had mounted several feet, and the wretched man to avoid being submerged was forced to climb upon the top of his table, which he knew would only serve to lengthen his misery a few moments longers Up- up-it came, still higher each moment -whirling in fierce eddies about his almdst lifeless form, until the waves washed over his shoulders. O God I what an awful moment of suspense! till that moment Lieutenant Ricardo had never known the value of life. In moments of excitement-in the midst of battle he had often risked it -thoughtlessly. but now all around was calm-his thoughts, were undisturbed by anything else, and he could fully realise his situation. One instant more--Hark! he thought he distinguished the sound- of human voices, and -a thunder- ing noise as if some persons were forcing an entrance into the vaults ibut the next moment he was washed from the table and was struggling in -the flood I We now return to the moment when the I bandit emerged from his private apartment, and proceeded to accomplish his hellish work-the effects of which we have already   seen. As he passed out of the doorway, a low solemn voice was again heard-- "Camille, beware!" But the bandit was too firmly bent upon the consummation of his wishes, to heed its' warning. The reader will remember that these same words were before uttered, just' after the recapture of Captain Leonard. The bandit had always attributed the warning whic-h so often greeted his ears, to some ghostly apparitions that were in the ages of superstition and ignorance supposed to stalk in the mantle of invisibleness among the ruins of old castles and structures that had formerly been their abode upon earth when living. But in this Camile was de- ceived. Scarcely had he quitted the entrance when a low creaking noise was heard, and a small panel in the wall was moved aside and a human being wrapped in along sable man-, tle emerged therefrom,  "So, so," muttered the figure hastily look-  ing carefully around, in order to see if any prying eyes were bent upon him, " he heeds not my advice. But the prisoner must be saved at all events. One thing that appeared somewhat singu- lar was that nose of the band or guards were to be seen-within the castle walls. 'This however could be accounted for in the following manner. Camile, during the day, under various pretences had dismissed the greater portion of his men, and allowed them the liberty of hunting in the forest, in order that there might be no witnesses of his in- tended barbarity. In a short time the stranger entered the passage leading to the cell in which the lieu- tenanti wasconfined. At the samemoment his ears were greeted with the sound of rush- ing waters. "Gods " shouted the stranger, in a deep voice, "I am, I fear,too late! Camile, the villain has already turned the flood into the passage " The passage in which the stranger was standing was somewhat higher than the floor of the cell in which the lieutenant was con- fined; he paused only for an instant. Draw- ing from beneath his robe a bunch of keys,   ; lie soon fitted one in the lock, which yielded to his touch and the door swung backward , on its hinges. Quick as thought the Stranger grasped firmly, and the next instant dragged the lifeless form of Ric ardo through the entranice intothe passage-This had scarcely been accomplished, twhen he' was alarmed by the sound of Jheavy footstep approaching.- The next moment Oamile stood before them. "Ha! who have we here?" he shouted, drawing his sword and stepping forward. "Camile, beware."- "By St. Paul! that voice again! Who are you" he asked turning to the other who stood with his cloak closely drawn about its tall form. "Behold!" and the stranger thiew aside his cloak, and tore a mask from his fae.- The bandit fell upon his knees and bowed his , head to the floor. I It was SANTA ANNA! CHAPTER    XXY. The events of the last chapter transpired a short time previous to the battle of Buena Vesta, for which Santa Anna was making great preparations when Captain Leonard left San Louis Potcsi. The van of the Mexi- can army had already-arrived at Eacaraa- tion, and the American forces had. fallen back from Agua Nueva to the ground upon which the battle was fought. All communi- cation between Monterey and Camargo was cut off, by a large body of .cavalry- and Musketeers, under the respective commands" of Urrea and Minon.    : . Captain Peron, who belpsged ;to o taei-e mand of the latter, at his own request was permitted to range- the-country lying between Camargo- and the gulf, to prevent or annoy the march of any detachment seot to augj- ment the garrisons along the line of -operar tion; and under this pretext he had-marched directly to the neighborhood of Matamoras, and in a secluded spot near a lagoon formed by the Rio Grande, and on the Texas side of the river, established his camp.  &#xD;<pb n="86-87" xml:id="VAC8064-00000045"/> In this camp,-as might be supposed, there was very little discipline. In truth, Peron u himself was seldom there. Most of his time was spent at Saint Augustine and Mataimo- rap, though in the latter place he always wore a disguise. Of course he was known to his acquaintances, but by the Americans, could crnot be distinguished from alny other stranger of the republic. It was in his camp where he planned the abduction of Andronita. And every neces- sary thing was so completely arranged, that he must have succeeded but for the timely interference of Captain Leonard, But he was not a man to be thwarted with impunity. He was of a determined mind, and of a vengeful disposition. He loved adven- ture, and always preferred the post of danger. His misadventure in Ambrosias garden, fired him with revenge. He returned with his men to their camp, and there concocted another plan to secure the forcible posses- sion of the damsel, as well as one for the des- truction of her deliverer. Both failed, however; and the latter re- silted- in his recognition, and well nigh in his arrest. The assassination was attempted in a billiard-room, kept by Angelo Oliva, an Italian; by whom 4 was happily prevented. It was after night, and the assassin, by means of the darkness, effected his escape. One of his men, however, was caught and sent to the Mexican prison; but he was dis- charged in the course of a few days, no one appearing to prosecute. The second attempt to kidnap Andronita, also failing, Peron grew more determined, and resolved to' storm the mansion.- But Amibrosia fearing such an event, obtained permission from the commandant of the post at hatamoras, to arm a certain numbr rof his rancheros for the defense of his family. News of this preparation having reached Peron, he concluded that it would be unsafe to make the contemplated attack, and Yewas therefore abandoned. But other means were immediately adopted to accomplish the same purpose. Meanwhile time elapsed, and other events   transpired. Captain Leonard had become a frequent and welcome visitor at the house- of the alcalde, and the accepted lover of his beautiful niece, with the/ approval of her friends. More than this. A day was fixed for their nuptials, and a messenger had been dis- patched to Victoria for a bishop, who was to perform the ceremony; and this high digni- tary was daily expected. Among the first informed of these things, was Olinda Rodamont, who visited Saint Auguustine at the request of Andronita, to remain with her until after the nuptial cen remonyt. During the interval she received a parti- cular account of Captain Peron's behavior toward his niece, which afforded her an additional proof of his gross perfidy toward herself. Olinda was not an angel, and much as she loved Andronita, she could not forgive the officer the preference manifested for her friend although she herself loved another, Almost daily Captain Leonard rode over to the mansion of the alcalde, ar d Alphonso not unfrpquently bore him company. On one occasion the following conversation transpired. o HEas anything been heard of Captain Pe- ron?" inquired Alphonso. - ' Nothing reliable," answered the Ameri- can. ' A company of traders, from New Leon, reported to have seen him at Ribonada Pass; but I am inclined to discredit the account." ' And I should unless I knew the narrator to be a man of truth," said Alphonso,; "for that place, you know, is a long distance be- yond Camargo."  "He is a merchant, from Cadareyta, highly respected in the city where he lives, and fa- vorablyr known to' some of the citizens of Matamoras, by whom his story is credited," replied Captain Leonard. "But all these things being true does not make his story true; he was doubtless deceived, and is in- nocently endeavouring to deceive others. I believe the villain lingers in the neighbor- hood, and is bent upon the perpetration of   Some evil, corresponding with his defeat and  disgrace." 't 1 trust you are mistaken," said Alphonso; *' and yet you may be correct. He is capa- ble of great crimes, and if he meditates evil, I depend upon it he will not stop to consider the consequences, further than is necessary to secure his own safety. -He is vicious and vindictive, and I stand inconstant fear lest Olinda should be made the object of his I vengeance."  Alphonso had abundant reason for his fear, for his rival had more than' once asserted, with a great oath, that she should never be- come his wife. He bad said the same thing of Andronita and the American, and his love for the former was sufficient warrant for the character of his intention. Captain Leonard was right in supposing that the kidnapper was still in the neighbor- hood. After the failure mentioned in the last chapter, he had returned to the seclusion and safety of his own camp,- where he re- mained for several davs before he again ven- tured abroad. On the evening of the day the above conversation took place, he sat in the midst ot his men who listened with the most profound attention to what he pro- posed, "On the next Wednesday," said he, "An- dronita and .that cursed American are to be married. This I have learned from a source that is reliable. I am in possession of the entire order of arrangements, but can dis- cover no way by which the marriage can be prevented. But after the ceremony the prin- cipal parties, with their attendants, are to proceed on horseback to Matamoras; and I propose to seize and bear away the bride at the very moment that they issue'irom the mansion. A loud shout -testified the approbation of the musketeers, who loved Peron, and were ready to do his bidding in almost every- thing. Nothing more remained to be enacted be- fore the day of the wedding, and Peron gave them fill liberty to roam wherever they pleased and in such numbers as they pre- ferred, only requiring that they should be   back ar d ready for duty the evening pre- vious to- the nuptial ceremonies at Saint Augustine.  The next morning they/ separated, and scattered about the country in pairs and half dozens, according as they could agree upon a destination or an employment. Quite a number went to the city and spent the time in dissipation and debauchery. Othersvi- sited the neighboring ranches, and loitered away the precious hours in conversation with the lazy inhabitants. Others, and by far the greatest-number, resolved to enlarge their stock of this world's goods, by appro- priating a portion of their neighbors' super- abuodance--some by theft, and some by open robbery. On the evening of the wedding day, a large majority of these lawless creatures returned to their camp, and all but one or two arrived before morning; in all, they numbered about sixty, and they were well armed with short straight swords and spanish muskets with bayondst- Besides, their stomachs and ha- versacks were abundantly supplied with choice food, which they had providently se- cured, by purchase or peccadillo, during their absence. Thus equipped and provi- sioned, they were ready to follow Peron into the midst of any danger. Between Saint Augustine and the city there was a cane-brake of vast extent, and the plants in many places shot up to the height of forty feet. In this thicket, close by the western edge of which the road passed, three of the musketeers were stationed at different points to give information of the movements of the wedding party, or rather to ascertain the number and quality of the guests, that they might calculate their chances of success. About ten o'clock the ferrymen at Forts Brown and Paredes -became unusually busy, and continued so until nearly noon, by which time all the guests from the city were safely landed on the other side of the river; among these there were quite a large number -of American army officers, who were of the ac- quaintances of Captain Leonard, made since bis return from captivity. All were mounted  &#xD;<pb n="88-89" xml:id="VAC8064-00000046"/> ,.f - on horseback, anl the officers, to imparit a more inposin appearance to the procession, wore their svords, and all those who be- longed to the field or staff, also carried their holsters. The Mexican portion of the guests, con- sisting of the city prefeets, alcaldes, the prin- cipal of the algiazils, anid the friends of Am- brosia and the nuptial parties, including lomano and his beautiful w'fe, Alphoriso and hii yet more beautiful bride, and Captain Coster, who was slowly recovering from his wounds, proceeded in a single body; while the -Americans, including Mr. Shatsell, fol- lowed about an  hour afterwards.  The whple number was not much short of a hun- dred persons, three-fourths of whom were men, and perhaps one-fourth armed with Springfield swords. All these things were duly reported to Peron, who, with his command, was waiting behind the brake for information which should confirm or change his plan. He lis- tened patiently to the detail of facts, and at the conclusion expressed his determination to pursue his original intention, as the only one likely to succeed. He argued thus; of course the principal parties would issue forth in advance of all others unless it should be their immediate attendants, and the bride would be the first miountea; and it was at the mnment she be- same seated in the saddle, that she was to be snatched away from the happy husband. That he might know the exact time to leave his concealment, so as not to-be too early, and create suspicion, or too late, and fail of his purpose, Peron sent a man to the village and another to the suburbs, the former to communicate by sign the first pre- parations for departure, and the latter to eonvey the -news with all possible dispatch. About the middle of the afternoon the sig- nal was given, and immediately the mus- keteers were all, mounted, marshalled, and marched. They approached the mansion in the rear, and under cover of the garden walls. These were so high, that they feared no discovery from the inmates, and the ran- cheros were too much occupied with what   was transpiring in the mansion and'about the main entrance, to observe their stealthy approach. The signal maker was stationed at a point where he could watch the, motions of the one party and .convey instantaneous intelligence to the other. At length the moment arrived The bride tripped forth in all her maiden loveliness; decorated in the most becoming,. manner, and was elevated to a seat on a snow white steed. Sinultaneous with her egress, Peron, closely followed by his fiendish men, darted round the corner of the wall, and with a savage yell that would have shamed the law- less Camanche, dashed into the midst of the wedding party, who were suddenly over- whelmed with consternation. On the instant, Andronita gurssed the purpose of the ruffian. and quickly detaching her-foot from the stirrup, endeavored to cast herself into her husband's arms, which were extended to receive her. But the approach of Peron was so rapid, that she was unable to accomplish her dt sign; for just as she was about to quit the saddle, his ruffianly arm encircled her waist and snatched her from the protecting embrace of her brave and gal lant spouse. He camre and went like the hurricane, which approaches with a great noise, filling all who hear it with fear, and departs before thenhave recovered .from the consternation, leaving behind only waste and desolation. CONCLUSION; The musketeers followed the lead of their commander, who fled toward the camp, where they had found shelter from the alguazils aud ! thorised to arrest and bring them to justice. i The rapidity of their flight gave them con- siderable advantage over Captain Leonard  -and then American officers, who mounted their I steeds with all possible despatcn and started off, one after another, in full pursuit. Fore- most in the chase was the bridegroom, who I bestrode the horse intended for bis- wife, de- - termined to rescue or die in -the attempt. t  The superiority of his steed soon enabled   him to overtake the rear of the dflying party, whom he would have pazsedd in his eager pur, suit, but that the villain guided his ovfn horse athwart his path and impeded his pro- gress. Angered beyond measure or control, the pursuer snatched from his bosom the re, volver which he had used with good effect on other occasions, and the next moment the musketeer rolled in the dust. A second, a third, and a fourth, who endeavored to retard his progress, met a similar fate, and the rest, seized with a sudden panic, fled in every di- rection; while the officers who were close behind, pursued them in their devious course and cat them down without mercy in their headlong flight.        - Still Peron, far in the advance, spurred his horse to his utmost speed, and kept on inthesame direction. Leavingthedispersed musketeers to be followed by the American o%ers, Captain Leonard pursued their dar- ing leader, between whom and himself the distance was every moment diminishing. At length he was within pistol range; but the ruffian, observing the levelled weapon, quickly interposed his unconscious burden, and saved himself from the death he so richly merited. Afraid to fire, lest in his effort to kill Pe- ron he might destroy his wife, Captain Leon ard thrust the pistol back into his bosom, struck his spurs deep into the sides oT his horse, and ex3rted every nerve to overtake the fugitive. But the attempt was useless, for his own beast, though swifter than the other for a certain distance, was not capable of as much fatigue and endurance; and the space between them, which until now had gradually diminished, be'an to increase with fearful rapidity. In this- extremity, Captain Leonard again plucked the pistol from his bosom, and le- velled it at the fugitive; but the drooping body of his wife, again thrust between the victim ana his danger, paralyzed the finger   that pressed the trigger, and the we-apon aud hand fell heavily by his side together. But the next moment both were again raised, and the contents of another barrel discharged; but not at the politic viilaio, who was armed  witch a shield more effectual than brass or iron; but at his tireless steed, which received the load in its head, and reared anrd plunged, and at length fell down in the aronies of death. In the fall, Andronita anud Peron became separated. The. former, who had tainted, as soon as she found herself in the arms of her rejected lover, lay on the ground senseless a short distance from the dying beast. But Peron quickly regaiuing his feet, drew his sword and rushed upon Captain Leonard, who had leaped from his horse- to protect his bride. The American still held in his hand the pistol from which he had already five times discharged a messenger of death: and it yet contained another, which the next mo- ment, was deeply lodged in the breast of his lawless rival. In a little time, several of the officers ar- rived, and afforded their triumphant country- man such assistance as the emergency re- quired. Andronita was conveyed to her uncle's mansion and by the help of suitable medicaments, was in a little while restored to consciousness. But in conseqluence of this interruption, and the many deaths it had occasioned, thirteen of the musketeers having shared the fate of their commander, the wed- ding ball, which was to have come off that night at the splendid mansion ot Velasquez Romanno, was deferred until the following. After the departure of the guests, most of whom returned to the city that evening, the rancheros were dispatched to collect and bury the dead bodies of Peron and his ills fated followers, and to administer to the re- lief of the wounded, who were unable to es- cape, of whom the number embraced nearly one third of the company.
