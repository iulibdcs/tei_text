ROCKFORD.&#xD;
CHAPTER        I.&#xD;
WE are all creatures of impulse, guided in the main&#xD;
by our passions, whims and caprices. The human mind&#xD;
N is so constituted that it requires a certain quantity of&#xD;
aliment, like the physical system, to sustain and keep it&#xD;
upon its proper balance. That pabulum must be gar-&#xD;
nered from the great field of literature, which blooms&#xD;
and blossoms in every nation of the civilized globe.&#xD;
Like the pilgrim in search of Truth, the neophyte of&#xD;
learning is puzzled to find a shrine at which he may&#xD;
worship and receive the signet which will serve as a&#xD;
passport into the Temple of Fame. What the unhappy&#xD;
pilgrim had considered as Truth in his own country, was&#xD;
so different from that crowning virtue of mortals in oth-&#xD;
er regions, that his heart sank within him, and he girded&#xD;
his loids afresh, rebuckled the sandals upon his weary&#xD;
feet, and retraced the space of his fruitless journey until&#xD;
the minarets and spires of his own village gladdened his&#xD;
eyes once more. The taste of our people is so different,&#xD;
that it behooves the writers of romances to introduce&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb  n="4-5" xml:id="VAC7718-00000003"/>&#xD;

scenes into their works which may please all classes' of&#xD;
society ; even then, the more fastidious may heap coals&#xD;
of fire upon the heads of the innocent authors.&#xD;
True, there, is a great diversity of2-.pinion existing in&#xD;
the minds.of individuals, ,even, who are competent judges&#xD;
of literature, as to what constitutes true merit. That is&#xD;
just and proper. If their minds ran in the same smooth,&#xD;
unruffled channel, the mass of readers would become dis-&#xD;
gusted with the easy path they tread, and retire from a&#xD;
race in which there are no competitors. It is controversy&#xD;
that brings truth to light, and fashions out the safest&#xD;
plan for the government of all social bodies. Like the&#xD;
rays of incidence and reflection, which move always in&#xD;
e sal angles though in different directions, the champi-&#xD;
ons pon the arena of debate divest every question df&#xD;
its surplus proportions, and erect a model which is&#xD;
pleasing to every one; or each party creates a system&#xD;
of principles which has its own admirers.&#xD;
As there is a marked difference in the opinions of&#xD;
wise legislators upon the systems of government, -so&#xD;
there is a diversity in the minds of those who write&#xD;
novels, plays, and books of amusement. The works of&#xD;
fiction, of late years, are masked batteries, from which&#xD;
the authors assail the public in every conceivable formal&#xD;
The religion of particular sects is ridiculed and put to&#xD;
tVie blush after a style ,so ludicrous, that the members&#xD;
are soften tempted to renounce their faith and adopt&#xD;
dome other creed. It is not to be doubted, that the&#xD;
loose writers of French romances have prepared the&#xD;
way for every revolution which has deluged the streets&#xD;
&#xD;
ROCKFORD.&#xD;

of Paris with blood, for the last hundred years. But&#xD;
scribblers will write, and- even a starving population&#xD;
will buy and read books. If the best talent of the&#xD;
country is not engaged in writing histories, essays, or&#xD;
romances of a legitimate literary. character, the legions&#xD;
,of small fry, who have no higher aspirations than to&#xD;
amuse the giddy crowd for a brief hour, are filling our&#xD;
book-stores . with their worthless trash which is daily&#xD;
corrupting the morals of our youth, thus paving the&#xD;
way for the subversio ' and dethronement of reason.&#xD;
How shall this thing be guarded against? Tl de-&#xD;
plorable system cannot be changed, except by the force&#xD;
of education and right reason. Teach a boy that the&#xD;
unequalled romances of Walter Scott are not to be laid&#xD;
aside for the lascivious productions of Eugene Sue, or&#xD;
the startling tales of horror which have rendered Alex-&#xD;
ander Dumas so noted, and you place him in the right&#xD;
path to avoid insurmountable obstructions in his literary&#xD;
pilgrimage. The masses of mankind.cannot be taught&#xD;
in a single day or a year; but a series of years spent b&#xD;
yea;yarspen              y,&#xD;
the educators of youth may effect a great change in this&#xD;
matter.&#xD;
The appearance of so many new novels of late years&#xD;
from writers unknown to fame, will tempt many inexpe-&#xD;
rienced 4thors to soar in' o realms of ether bright, but&#xD;
their own leaden weight will bring them down upon a&#xD;
level with terrestrial things. If a book without merit&#xD;
forces its way into polite circles, the eager crowd iray&#xD;
. , .&#xD;
read it; but the condemnation of wise critics will soon&#xD;
consign it to the shades of oblivion. Criticism is a.&#xD;

sharp lancet which is admirably adapted to the work of&#xD;
draining off sup'erfluous fountains, yet it often kills an in-&#xD;
nocent victim. The English and Scotch Reviewers sent&#xD;
-so many shafts into the ranks of MISTAIgENDOM, who&#xD;
.were trying to force a passage into the Temle of Fame,&#xD;
that none but the valiant and true in the.palmy days of&#xD;
Byron, Scott and Moore, were permitted to climb high&#xD;
up the hill of the Muses.&#xD;
If a romance is not intended to, instruct, as well as&#xD;
amuse the reader, it is written in vain. There are but&#xD;
.few authors 'who are capable of spinning out a tale by&#xD;
merely giving narrations,-after the pleasing style of the&#xD;
old class of writers, therefore-a variety of characters&#xD;
must be introduced to cater to the taste of the multitude'.&#xD;
The monotone of a reader renders his hearers weary and&#xD;
uneasy; yet the musical modulations of a well-trained&#xD;
voice fall upon the attentive ears of an eager .auditory&#xD;
like the thrilling chimes ofggolen bell. The descrip-&#xD;
tion of a beautiful landscape would not be so charming&#xD;
if the writer should draw ;the picture of no rugged&#xD;
mountains and desolate heaths. A beautiful, clear rip-&#xD;
pling brooks as it rushes- heedlessly and playfully along&#xD;
over its pebbly bed, gladdens the eye and freshens the&#xD;
grove; but the very flocks and herds loathe and fly&#xD;
from a sluggish, turbid pool. It is contrast that renders&#xD;
beauty more sublime, and variety scatters all the flowers&#xD;
of the wrest in our paths; even the kingdom of Flora&#xD;
would bloom in vain if the hedges were planted alone&#xD;
with roses or lilies.' The sensitive plant, which shrinks&#xD;
from the touch and closes its tiny leaves wlen the rough&#xD;

winds visit them too freely, has no sweet flower, but&#xD;
every model of grace and beauty exists in its slender&#xD;
form. It is not to be-excluded from the garden, for it&#xD;
is a sweet sister to the flowers. They look more beau-&#xD;
tiful by its side, and they protect and"guard it from&#xD;
harm.a                                  a&#xD;
I propose to write a novel, not after the style of&#xD;
trashy authors, whose existence is only ephemeral, but&#xD;
one which may interest and instruct the reader. The&#xD;
abuse of no religious sect will find a place in these pages.&#xD;
If the work has merit, the public will soon discoverit ;&#xD;
if it has none, it will share the fate of thousands of&#xD;
others which were written only to gratify the whim of&#xD;
the authors. Like the author of Gil Blas, I respectfully&#xD;
ask a perusal of -this work. The reader may remember&#xD;
the fVble that the author relates in the opening chapter&#xD;
of that masterly work.&#xD;

CHAPTER 'II.&#xD;
&#xD;
THE moon shines so brightly, -my dear," said Mr.&#xD;
Rockford to his wife, as he made preparations for an&#xD;
evening walk, "that I have an inclination to step over&#xD;
to t  village hotel and spend an  hour in conversation&#xD;
with our friend ,&#xD;
"Lo6k! Mi. ockford, how the baby smiles upon you.&#xD;
Do you not hear him say, 'Papa'? iHe, extends his lit-&#xD;
tle hands for you to take him. Do remain' with us this&#xD;
beautiful.Winter evening. There is such a pleasant,&#xD;
bright fire burning.in the grate, and the hall looks so&#xD;
comfortable."&#xD;
Mr. Rockford excused himself, and promising to re-&#xD;
turn by ten o'clock,. hurried from the house, and was&#xD;
soon walking briskly in the, direction of the principal&#xD;
square of the town. - Mrs. Rockford kissed the rosy&#xD;
cheeks of Sebastian more than once, and standing him&#xD;
upon the marble slab which supported a 'costly mirror,'&#xD;
she pressed her darling to her bosom as he endeavored&#xD;
to strike his own beautiful image reflected from the,&#xD;
crystal surface of the glass. Sebastian was a promising&#xD;
little boy of two years of age. His light auburn ring-&#xD;
lets clustered in many a curl about his well shaped head.&#xD;
Hisbluie eyes made his mother glad, when they beamed&#xD;
upon her with an expression of intelligence so far be-&#xD;
yond one of his age.&#xD;

"Bless mother's little darling ; she would not take&#xD;
the world for him. Kiss mother, and then get down.&#xD;
upon the carpet and play with Jupe."&#xD;
Jupe was a little white woolly fice, which had been so&#xD;
much petted, that he considered no place about the&#xD;
house too sacred for him to enter, Whe sofa and rock-&#xD;
jing-chairs were occupied by this dinjinutive specimen of&#xD;
the canine race, whenever it pleased him, to take a nap.&#xD;
Jupe was never satisfied'when little Sebastian was out&#xD;
of his sight. Sebastiar1 returned his love with all the&#xD;
ardor that an affectionate child is capable of possessing.&#xD;
When Jupe would play too freely with Sebastian's toys,&#xD;
or -throw down his block houses and run off with his&#xD;
ivory rattle, the boy would chase, and jfle*k him with&#xD;
his whip. Jupe had too much sense or did not care to&#xD;
hurt Sebastian; but as dogs are not mire patient of ill&#xD;
treatment than humaji beings-are, Jupl became nervous&#xD;
when Sebastian bit his soft velvet ears to  ard, and&#xD;
never failed to give him an unlucky snap upon the fin-&#xD;
gers. Sebastian wogld run: to his mother, crying, with&#xD;
many bitter complaints against Jupe. - She, upon occa-&#xD;
sions of that kind, would order tupe to be moderately&#xD;
chastised, and sent to his kennel in disgrace.&#xD;
"Here, Jupe," said Mrs..iRockford, 'as-she stood,.Se-&#xD;
bastian down upon the floor, " come and play with&#xD;
darling."&#xD;
Jupe barked immoderately, and playfully bit-$ebas-&#xD;
tian upon .his leg. They were soon rolling over and&#xD;
over upon the floor, -while Mrs. Rockford beheld the&#xD;
scene with much delight. Her happinessseemed to be&#xD;

concentrated in the boundless love she entertained for&#xD;
herson. She almost idolized him, and yet her love for&#xD;
her husband was nQt in the least diminished by its being&#xD;
divided with Sebastian. All the wealth of Golconda,&#xD;
added to the priceless pearls of the ocean, are not so&#xD;
dear-in a parent's eyes as a lovely child. 'Thus thought&#xD;
Mrs. Rockford, as she seated herself before the glowing&#xD;
grate, with the household pets playing at her feet. She&#xD;
was a lovely woman, capable of rendering a household&#xD;
happy and sharing the felicity herself. She was indus-&#xD;
trious and prided herself in arranging and putting every&#xD;
thing in its proper place. The piano was dressed off&#xD;
with a costly covering, embroidered by her own fingers-&#xD;
A green, vine formed the border of this magnificent&#xD;
piece of her handiwork. In the center was a vase of&#xD;
flowers, and numerous devices filled the space. The&#xD;
embroidered mats for the lamps were not the least&#xD;
attractive ornaments of the'center-table, and the willow&#xD;
basket, filled with Sebastian's toys, was beautified with&#xD;
numerous enmblems wrought in: crewel. These were only&#xD;
sa few of the fruits of hei' accomplishments and industry.&#xD;
It is generally supposed that women are unhappy&#xD;
because the greater portion of their time is spent within&#xD;
doors, but such is not the case. They have a thousand&#xD;
things to interest them which are not attractive to men.&#xD;
A woman will sit for weeks, axd labor with her needle;&#xD;
embroidering a pair of uihdersleeves or a single cambric&#xD;
handkerchief. When Mrs. Rockford was not employ.&#xD;
ing her time in reading, or playing with Sbastian, its&#xD;
was thus that she amused herself.. She rang a little&#xD;

brazen bell that lay upon the mantel, and Lucinda, Ethe&#xD;
housemaid, entered. Lucinda brought the work-basket,&#xD;
which was filled with the scraps of many samples of&#xD;
domestic goods. Placing thebasket by her side, this&#xD;
industrious lady commenced selecting some of the latest&#xD;
styles which were to - form the squares of a quilt for&#xD;
Sebastian's bed. Being satisfiedwith the selection of&#xD;
colors, she commenced cutting the pieces intodiminutive&#xD;
squares, triangles and crescents. If the manufacture&#xD;
of quilts is' considered a waste of time, it is truly a&#xD;
great saving of rags. It would be but liglt employ-&#xD;
ment, indeed, for a lady to make enough quilts for a&#xD;
whole community,' if it were only requisite for her to&#xD;
cut the different goods into pieces of the length of the&#xD;
quilts, and sew them together. The good ladies ought&#xD;
to have -their own way about their household affairs.&#xD;
Let them cut their cloth into as many fairy-like sec-&#xD;
tions as they please, and stitch in rose, lily or japonica&#xD;
patterns.&#xD;
But Sebastian was not of this opinion, pr was Jupe;&#xD;
or at least their actions indicated it, for they rose from&#xD;
the floor as if by mutual consent, and made an attack&#xD;
upon the good lady's' basket. The boy emptied it upon&#xD;
the floor and commenced selecting the scrips of the&#xD;
brightest colors, before his mother was aware of his&#xD;
intentions. Jupe seized several bits of cloth, regardless&#xD;
of their whiteness; with his tiny sharp teethadran&#xD;
to his usual safe retreat under the sofa.  He was so&#xD;
fairy-like in his physical proportions, that he could&#xD;
occupy a very small space. Lucinda had uponseveral&#xD;

&#xD;
occasions tried to eject him from his lurking place. The&#xD;
sofa was so shaped that its frame work almost rested&#xD;
upon t e floor. Jupe effected his entrance to this safe&#xD;
asylum    a small aperture between one of the legs and&#xD;
slabs of essofa. It was necessary to remove the sofa&#xD;
in order to rest the miscreant. Jupe had sense enough&#xD;
to know this; besides he was- all pluck, and ifhe took&#xD;
it into his head to withstand a siege he would maintain&#xD;
his position and remain in his impregnable fortress from&#xD;
the rising of the sun to the going down thereof.  Se-&#xD;
bastian ran all over the room, scattering his' trophies,&#xD;
while Jupe applauded him by keeping up a continual&#xD;
g     barking.&#xD;
Lucnda was ordered to gather up the scraps, and&#xD;
place them beyond the reach of Sebastian. The ser-&#xD;
vant did as she was directed, and Sebastian was upon&#xD;
the eve of receiving a slight chastisement for his con-,&#xD;
duct, when his mother remembered that he would relate&#xD;
everything to his father when he came home. Mr.&#xD;
Rockford was not, favorable to the rigid training of&#xD;
children, believing that a child should be taught the&#xD;
enormity of an offence before the punishment is inflict-&#xD;
ed. The mother laid aside her work for the balance.of&#xD;
the evening, and ordered her basket put away. She&#xD;
,was in no mood to proceed with her work, nor could&#xD;
she have done so to advantage, .,for Jupe had dome of&#xD;
her select scraps in his saf keeping. She knew he&#xD;
would stay under the sofa for hours to come. The wai'&#xD;
had been waged, and he was not yet willing to surrender&#xD;
Mrs. Rockford readily forgave her child, but poor Jupe&#xD;
&#xD;
ROCKFORD.                   13&#xD;
must suffer in the flesh when sheshould lay her hands&#xD;
upon him.' She. smoothed the dishevelled ringlets of&#xD;
her darling, kissed his coral lips, and took him in her&#xD;
arms and sang him to sleep.&#xD;
How blessed is that happy mother who has an angel&#xD;
sleeping in her arms ! An innocent child is the true&#xD;
type of those celestial beings, whose dwelling place is&#xD;
Paradise. If a child. has the germs of sin within it,&#xD;
the commencement of its trangressions is not co-eval&#xD;
with its birth. Angels guard the slumbers of infants,&#xD;
and fan their cheeks with snow white wings. Sebastian&#xD;
slept the sweet sleep of happy childhood. His mother&#xD;
unloosed his tiny fingers from her neck, around which&#xD;
his arms had clung as if for protection, and gently&#xD;
placing him in his little bed, covered him up carefully.&#xD;
Taking a book from the center-table, she sat down to&#xD;
read until the .return of her husband.&#xD;
When Mr. Rockford left his stately mansion to walk&#xD;
to the town, the iinon shone brilliantly and the pebbly&#xD;
walks resounded beneath.hismanly tread. The steeples&#xD;
of the churches and the dome of the town hall reflected&#xD;
the silvery rays of the orb of night from their metallic&#xD;
coverings. Crofton was a quiet, nice town, and possess-&#xD;
ed an intelligent population, noted for integrity, sobriety&#xD;
and industry. In the business season the place had a&#xD;
bustling, commercial-like appearance. It wasa seaport.&#xD;
whose harbor admitted ships of light tonnage. Situated&#xD;
at the mouth of a navigable river, which had its source&#xD;
in the upland districts of the State, the commodious&#xD;
ware-rooms were the recipients of the staple produce of&#xD;

the country. Besides, the place was considered very&#xD;
healthy, and was frequently resorted to by those in&#xD;
search of a quiet retreat.. The waves of the Atlantic&#xD;
dashed against the base, of the steep bluff upon which&#xD;
the town stood, and the ears of ,the citizens had learned&#xD;
to love the harmonious echoes of the moving billows.&#xD;
Mr. Rockford approached the square upon which the&#xD;
principal hotel was located, and was proceeding quietly&#xD;
along the walk when his attention was arrested by the&#xD;
appearance of a largeycrowd assembled at the corners&#xD;
of the street. He approached the assemblage and en-&#xD;
quired the cause of the excitement. One of the citizens&#xD;
told him that a murder had just been committed by a&#xD;
desperate character, and, one of the most inoffensive, -&#xD;
upright men in Crofton was the unfortunate victim.&#xD;
The citizens had assembled for the purpose of consid-&#xD;
ering the propriety of taking the law in their own hands,&#xD;
and dealing out summary punishment to the offender.&#xD;
Mr. Rockford was a good man, and having practiced&#xD;
law in Crofton many years, his views upon all subjects&#xD;
were duly respected. He was instantly importuned by&#xD;
those present, to speak to the infuriated citizens, and,&#xD;
if possible, to induce them to respect the supremacy of&#xD;
the law. He responded to their call, and mounting the&#xD;
steps of one of the stores, admonished them not to&#xD;
abuse the privileges they then enjoyed as law-abiding&#xD;
and God-fearing men. He said it was true that one of&#xD;
the best men in the community had fallen by the hands&#xD;
of a desperate man, yet he, was in safe custody, and&#xD;
they had laws which ought' truly to be executed ; hut&#xD;

CHAPTER III.&#xD;
&#xD;
IT was a' custom indulged in by Sir Walter Scott to&#xD;
rise early and take long morning walks while he was&#xD;
engaged in the composition'- of any one of his great&#xD;
works: He supposed that his mind was free from care&#xD;
at such times, and his solitary rambles lent that beauty&#xD;
and vigor to his compositions which are seen in the&#xD;
writings of' no other authors. The human mind is so&#xD;
constituted that it requires rest, exercise, and indul-&#xD;
gence. Being a philosopher by nature, this great man&#xD;
knew that the mind; like the body, would be exposed to&#xD;
the ravages of decay, without fresh pabulum  to feed&#xD;
upon. He would stand for hours and indulge his fancy&#xD;
in beholding the silvery sheets of water pour over the&#xD;
rough ledges of rock, and unite again in the bosom&#xD;
of the soft rippling stream. Coleridge composed the&#xD;
"Rime of the Ancient Mariner" during' a pleasant&#xD;
evening excursion. Lord Byron would never have writ-&#xD;
ten the unequalled poem of "Childe Harold," if his foot-&#xD;
steps had never wandered beyond the limits of his&#xD;
native country. As sweetly as his liquid verse flows in,&#xD;
melodious streams; he confessed that it was quite difli-.&#xD;
cult for him to compose, unless he was very familiar&#xD;
with his subject, and at such times as his, mind was&#xD;
completely under his control. Shelley had a peculiar&#xD;
&#xD;
ROCKFORD.i&#xD;
fancy for sail boats. If he,was not indulging his fond-&#xD;
ness for this sport in sailing across the lake, he would,&#xD;
when fatigued with labor, hasten to the water side, and,&#xD;
child-like, sail diminutive boats near the 'shore. It is&#xD;
related of him,' that he. was. so fond of constructing&#xD;
ships and sail boats out of paper, that he would tear&#xD;
leaves from a book however so costly. Upon one occa-&#xD;
sion, he. was sitting upon the banks of a river in a&#xD;
meditative mood. He had left his little boats at home,&#xD;
and, unfortunately, had no book with him. I'could&#xD;
not be deprived of his pleasure, and taking out a Bank&#xD;
bill of considerable value, he fashioned out-a boat and&#xD;
flung it into the stream.&#xD;
Napoleon Bonaparte so prepared his mind for labor by&#xD;
by violent exercise, that he accomplished more in a given&#xD;
space than any General of modern times. And -if we&#xD;
except Julius Coesar, who was one of the most accom-&#xD;
plished scholars among the ancients, the great Napoleon&#xD;
had no superior. - The periods of history are so strangely&#xD;
divided by those who are considered competent judges,&#xD;
that we are in doubt whether it is proper to class Julius&#xD;
Cosar among the ancients, or not. Some authors face-&#xD;
tiously speak of events which happened before antiquity&#xD;
itselfbegan ; but let dates begin or end as the caprices&#xD;
of men may limit them, Julius Caesar finished the: an-&#xD;
cient and laid the corner-stone of modern' times, His&#xD;
history of the Gallic War was composed in 'his camps:&#xD;
it could not have been written by one, with half the&#xD;
vigor, who was not a' participator himself in those in-&#xD;
teresting scenes.&#xD;

Josephus Napoleon BonaparteSnibbenis had a great&#xD;
fancy for imitating distinguished, men. He imagined&#xD;
that he was learned, for the reason that he had read&#xD;
and studied the works of great authors. It was certain&#xD;
that he had read "Robbins' 'Outlines of History." 'and&#xD;
"tTooke's Pantheon."  He could discourse eloquently&#xD;
upon the righty deeds of the Egyptian heroes; and&#xD;
when he was relating the scenes of the Chines revolu-&#xD;
tion ,  always 'grew pathetic.  Mr. Snibbens was a&#xD;
grea an, as most of his patrons and pupils thought.&#xD;
He had come to Crofton to teach the juvenile portion&#xD;
of the community, not.only the theories of the learned-&#xD;
authors, but he intended that the society of. the place&#xD;
should be improved by his illustrious example.&#xD;
Early on the morning subsequent to the events related&#xD;
in the preceding chapter, Mr. Snibbens emerged from&#xD;
his boarding-house for the express purpose of taking&#xD;
his usual morning walk. The weather was cool and&#xD;
bracing, and the white frost glittered upon the ground&#xD;
like transparent eystals. Buttoning his overcoat, up&#xD;
to his chin, and straightening up the collar to protect&#xD;
his ears from the cold, this modern genius directed his&#xD;
footsteps to the sea-side. He had not proceeded far&#xD;
when he met John Simpkins, one of the town merchants,&#xD;
on his way to his place of business.&#xD;
Good morning, friend Simpkins," said Snibbens, as&#xD;
he halted for a regular chat, "thisis delightful weather.&#xD;
Thomson 'gives such glowing descriptions of Winter&#xD;
mornings, in his poem gn the Seasons, that I am almost&#xD;
tempted to rehearse a few of the stanzas for your es-&#xD;
pecial benefit."&#xD;

"Ah ! Mr. Snibbens," replied Simpkins, ''you men of&#xD;
learning are excellent companions; but a plodding mer-&#xD;
chant, like myself, is always at a loss to find suitable&#xD;
words to repay you for your fine display of rhetoric."&#xD;
Snibbens received 'the compliment with studied af-&#xD;
fectation, and taking a pinch of -snu, described a&#xD;
geometrical figure upon the ground with. his walking&#xD;
stick, gd was on the point of entering upon. a discus-&#xD;
sion concerning the-properties of angles,-but h was so&#xD;
anxious to learn the particulars of the murder Oat he&#xD;
changed his determination n.&#xD;
"Come, friend Simpkiis," said the erudite pedagogue,&#xD;
"please relate to me what information you have gathered&#xD;
relative to the heart-rendig occurrence of last evening,&#xD;
which," as, I have been informed, has no parallel in the&#xD;
history of Crofton."  (Here Snibbens took snuff a sec-&#xD;
ond time, and looked wise.)&#xD;
"It is true," replied Simpkins, "that it is a deed&#xD;
which makes one shudder to think.of, yet I have read&#xD;
of crimes as equally. horrible. dare Royston has been&#xD;
the terror of this community ever since his dissipation&#xD;
commenced. A few years since he was an accomplished&#xD;
clerk in one of the principal business .houses in this&#xD;
town. He was admired and respected by all who knew&#xD;
him, and'was considered by his employers as a man of&#xD;
strict integrity. - For a long time he has led a desperate&#xD;
life. He was supposed to have been implicated in a&#xD;
murder committed only a few miles from Crofton, but&#xD;
sufficient evidence was 'not produced- upon the investiga-&#xD;
tion to -convict him. Last night he was. creating a&#xD;

disturbance, in the -sitting room of the hotel, where&#xD;
several, gentlemen were conversing, when' they endeav-&#xD;
ored to pazify him. He commenced throwing the chairs&#xD;
about the room,and one of them struck Jonathan Wins-&#xD;
low. That gentleman remarked that he was peaceable&#xD;
man, but was not in the least inclined to submit to a&#xD;
wanton insult. He made no advance upon Royston,&#xD;
but cautioned him-not to molest him again. Royston&#xD;
drew  t a pistol and discharged its contents in the&#xD;
bJeas  f Winslow, who fell and expired in a few min-&#xD;
utes."&#xD;
Mr. Simpkins wished Snibbens a very good morning,&#xD;
and hurried to his store. Snibbens walked down to the&#xD;
wharf, made a forcible speech to the waves,.snuffed the&#xD;
sea breeze a few minutes, and retraced his steps to his&#xD;
boarding-house. When he entered the hall, the jingling&#xD;
sound of a hand-bell announced that breakfast was&#xD;
ready. He was -a punctual man in all the relations of&#xD;
life, but more especially in his attendance at his meals.&#xD;
He took his accustomed place that morning, if 'not with&#xD;
a light heart, at least with:a keen appetite.&#xD;
Samuel Culerhouse, and his tidy wife, subsisted upon&#xD;
the profits of entertaining a dozen boarders. Mrs. Cul-&#xD;
verhouse wore a Swiss muslin cap, bordered with wide&#xD;
edging of her own knitting. The good dame had a&#xD;
pair of old-fashioned silver spectacles which had been&#xD;
the property of her grand-mother. The glasses were&#xD;
circular, and when she put them on and seated 'herself&#xD;
beside the coffee urn, she presented a' very ludicrous&#xD;
appearance. Samuel was dressed in his everlasting suit&#xD;

woven with her own hands.&#xD;
"Take a bit of this steak, Mr. Snibbens ? fine steak&#xD;
-tender steak. I selected it myself," said Samuel, as&#xD;
""he helped each ones of the boarders to a portion of the&#xD;
savory dish.&#xD;
Mr. Sniibens, will you hay  cream and sugar in&#xD;
your coffee this morning ?" sai  orothy.&#xD;
If you please, madam," said the learned pedagogue.&#xD;
"Will you have much sugar in it, Mr. Snibbenss?"&#xD;
continued the good dame.'&#xD;
"I am not at all .particular, my dear Mrs. Culver&#xD;
house," anxiously replied Snibbens, who had given the&#xD;
identical answers to the same queries every morning,&#xD;
for three years, in which he had sojourned in the house&#xD;
of that most excellent woman.&#xD;
The conversation naturally turned upon the murder&#xD;
of Jonathan Winslow. Each one had a good word to&#xD;
say concerning the lamented man, while they all loathed&#xD;
the very name of Royston. Samuel entertained the&#xD;
opinion that there'would be but little difficulty in the&#xD;
conviction 'of Royston, when the case hould come up&#xD;
for trial. Many murderers had been turned loose upon&#xD;
that community, he said, because the lawyers had been&#xD;
ably feed,; and in some instances the jury had been&#xD;
bribed. - Samuel was not certain of this, but he was&#xD;
sustained by the boarders, who were not in the habit of&#xD;
differing materially from tle -opinions as expressed by&#xD;
the worthy host.&#xD;
"I knew Winslow well; sir--knew him well," said the&#xD;

hearty Samuel, as he emptied fis fourth cup of coffee,&#xD;
and helped himself to a fresh supply off buck-wheat&#xD;
cakes. "A nobler man was never an inhabitant of,&#xD;
Grofton than he was.' I learn that old Mr. ,Winslow&#xD;
has employed lawyer Rockford to prosecute the case,&#xD;
and if he does his duty and brings the powers of his&#xD;
.mind to act with their  customer vigor, it is not to be&#xD;
doubted, but that the risoner will be convicted."&#xD;
"Sramuelmuy darling," said the good house-wife, rais-&#xD;
ing her massive spectacles from her long Roman nose&#xD;
and resting them upon the frill of her muslin cap, "is&#xD;
it the same young Mr. Winslow uho used to drive that&#xD;
dapple horse by ere last Summer ?"&#xD;
"You are rightmy dear," saiA the affectionate Sam-&#xD;
uel. "You are seldom wrong in your surmises, Dorothy.&#xD;
Mrs. Primrose never made the Vicar of Wakefield a&#xD;
betterpose than you have been to me.' Have Edith&#xD;
to bringii some warm cakes from the kitchen."&#xD;
Samuel knew exactly how to cater to the vanity of&#xD;
Dorothy. She returned his compliment with becoming&#xD;
iodesty, but cided hin for being so affectionate before&#xD;
company.             w     al     so     m    y&#xD;

words to me before them. I asked you question about&#xD;
Mr. Winslow, and you gave me only a half an answer,&#xD;
and'wound up by making an appeal for warm cakes."&#xD;

The good Dorothy had sent Edith.,to the kitchen, to&#xD;
assist thee cook in prep ring sausages for the second&#xD;
table, and not desiring to interfere with her own ar-&#xD;
rangements, she took a dish and tripped off to 'do ,the&#xD;
behests of her husband. During her. absence, Mr.&#xD;
Snibbens related his morning's adventures, and expatia-&#xD;
ted upon the many happy th     hts that arise in the&#xD;
mind while the body is -mod    ely exercised by a&#xD;
pleasant ramble. He never forgot to relate, in speaking&#xD;
of the benefits the mind derives from exercise, that&#xD;
Napoleon Bonaparte unloosed' the leaden fetters from&#xD;
his mind, by walking for hours before the camp-fires upon&#xD;
the eve- of a great battle. Mr. 'SnibAns' had read a&#xD;
pictorial history of thevFrenchRevol ion.&#xD;
The mistress of the house having made a successful&#xD;
trip to the kitchen, returned laden with. some brown&#xD;
cakes spread with Goshen. butter. The boarders finish-&#xD;
ed a pleasant meal, and left the host and his spouse to&#xD;
discuss their plans for the day.&#xD;
Snibbens went into the hall, sat a few minutes by the&#xD;
fire, picked his teeth and smoked a cigar. Wheir the&#xD;
hour for opening school arrived, he went o his chamber&#xD;
and collected his books which he used at recitations.&#xD;
He placed a Key to Algebra in one pocket and .a Dia-&#xD;
mond interlinear, translation of Virgil in the other.&#xD;
Those were the best friends this .nted teacher had in&#xD;
the'world, as he overcame many obstructios by making&#xD;
drafts upon. their oracular 'leaves. ' lie Went to his&#xD;
school-room, and rang the bell. The boys took their&#xD;
seats and' applied themselves to their lessons.&#xD;

When the class in Virgil was called up to recitation,&#xD;
three boys sauntered to the stand, each one carrying a&#xD;
dilapidated edition of the works of the Roman bard in&#xD;
one hand and a Latin Dictionary ithe other.&#xD;
"Which is the lesson, James Jones.? 'asked the learn-&#xD;
ed teacher.&#xD;
"It commences at t  two hundred and fiftieth line,&#xD;
second Book of the    id, sii."&#xD;
"You may commence, James,",said Snibbens.&#xD;
James took his sweet gum from his mouth and lent it&#xD;
to the boy who sat next to him, and began his recitation:&#xD;
"Vertitur interea coelurm-the interior of the heaven&#xD;
was inverted ; etuit Oceano nox-and the ocean rushed&#xD;
on to the night ;'bvolens umbra magna terrarnque po-&#xD;
lunique-overturning the great shade of the earth with&#xD;
a pole ; Myrmidonum que dolos-with the Myrmidonian&#xD;
dollars: This translation'did not exactly suit Snibbens,&#xD;
though he supposed that the boy was not far from being&#xD;
right.&#xD;
"Wait a moment, James, until I go into the apparatus&#xD;
room. I thought I heard something fall."&#xD;
' Snibbens weitinto the little room, and 'drawing out&#xD;
his translation, hastily looked over the passage which&#xD;
James had just read. He placed some of th, retorts&#xD;
upon different shelves, made'a noise, as if picking up&#xD;
something from the floor, and having arranged what the&#xD;
class had supposed was blown down by the wind, he&#xD;
returned and required James.to translate the sentence&#xD;
again. The teacher grew very wrathy, and flourishing a&#xD;
rod over James' head, ordered him to translate it again,&#xD;
&#xD;
ROOKFORD-                   25&#xD;
I&#xD;
but the lazy boy did not improve by, either effort. Snib.-&#xD;
bens exercised James in a lively manner with the- rod&#xD;
around his shoulders, waist and legs.&#xD;
"Listen at the translation I give you of this simple&#xD;
sentence," said the teacher ; and he gave James one&#xD;
more cut upon the ankle. "The heavens are, turned&#xD;
around, and the night rushes from the ocean, envelopiiig&#xD;
the earth, and the sky, and the  archery of the Greeks&#xD;
with a great shadow."  Parse ruit, sir."&#xD;
"Ruit is a verb," said the whining and sobbing boy;"&#xD;
"of the first conjugation ; from ruo, ruare, ruavi, rua-&#xD;
turn. Indicative mood, pluperfe'ct tense, third person,&#xD;
singular number, and agrees with Oceano. A verb must&#xD;
agree with its nominative case in number and person."&#xD;
" He is. wrong, Mr. Snibbens," said Joe Bishop,&#xD;
" ruit is of the third conjugation'"&#xD;
"I am aw 'e of that, Joe," replied the teacher.&#xD;
." Bring me her  your dictionary.  How .often must I&#xD;
point out words to you?' Do you not see as plain 'as&#xD;
the noseon your  e that it comes from ruo, ruere rui&#xD;
ruiturn?  Now bri g me here your grammar and let&#xD;
me show you how to nd it."&#xD;
Snibbens found lego, and whispered to himself, lego,&#xD;
legis, legit, legirnus, legitis, legunt, he discovered that&#xD;
it was found in the indicative mood, present tense, third&#xD;
person, singular number, and agreed with nox.&#xD;
'"Take this lesson over again; boys, and if you come&#xD;
up here again so.deficient I will make you remember&#xD;
me."&#xD;
Snibbens was an industrious teacher, who, when he&#xD;

rons, who had not suspected his deficiency, supposed&#xD;
him :to be a wonderful genius.&#xD;
The foundation of a -boy's education is frequently&#xD;
spoiled forever' byjust such teachers as Snibbens5 who&#xD;
may be found in all communities. They adopt teaching&#xD;
as a profession, because it is a good stepping-stone to&#xD;
the law, medicine and divinity. It is often made a sin-&#xD;
ecure by ignorant men, who succeed in humbugging a&#xD;
community by artifice; and plausibility of speech.&#xD;
Mr. Snibbens was as punctual to his business as the&#xD;
dial is true to the sun; yet he aspired to the knowledge&#xD;
of sciences and languages, of which he was, entirely&#xD;
ignorant. The more intelligent- of. the lads, who had&#xD;
been placed under his literary.guardianship, were cer-&#xD;
tainthat'his insructions-were not in the least beneficial&#xD;
to'them.' They' had often hinted their suspicious to&#xD;
their parents, but a father who hasforgotten the famil-&#xD;
iar lessons which he learned in his youth, is not 'a proper&#xD;
judge of the qualifications of a teacher.  Trustees of&#xD;
academies and high schools are more frequently chosen&#xD;
&#xD;
on account of their wealth and influence, than for their&#xD;
literary accomplishments.  Snibbens had maintained&#xD;
his position unshocked 4nd unshaken against more than&#xD;
one competitor more ompetent to fill the position than&#xD;
himself, at several annual meetings of the BOARD. . Ev-&#xD;
cry one acknowledged that 'Snibbens was a good, clever&#xD;
man, and it would have been sue a pity to have ejected&#xD;
him from his position, when the boys liked him so well;&#xD;
and he was such a nice, hindy 'gentleman to instruct&#xD;
the 'Sunday School. classes.  No one could raise the&#xD;
hymns in church better than he could,' and if one of the&#xD;
neighbors should be taken sick, he was the best hand&#xD;
to sit up, in the town. He was just the.man who could&#xD;
have obtained his board in 'a family regardless of com-&#xD;
pensation, repayig the worthy proprietor of the house&#xD;
with no, other coin than the pious example he might set&#xD;
before the children.   '$    -&#xD;

ROKFORD.&#xD;

IT is related.of-the renowned Gil Bias, that when he&#xD;
left the parental roof  seek his fortune in the wide,&#xD;
wide world, his mother bestowed upon him the last shil-&#xD;
ling she possessed, and shed copious tears at his depart-&#xD;
ure ; while his father enriched him with his blessing, and&#xD;
gently pushed him out into the arena of life. The father&#xD;
often means to bestow a blessing upon a son when he&#xD;
forces him to buffet the waves. of the sea of life, though&#xD;
the son may place a' different construction upon the&#xD;
actions of the father, and accuse. him of cruelty. Be&#xD;
this as it may, if an individual is compelled to undergo&#xD;
hardships, and sense is to be learned only in the school&#xD;
of experience, youth is the proper season to receive such&#xD;
costly instructions,; for then'Jtheir admonitions will be&#xD;
lasting.&#xD;
Mortimer Rockford had been the architect of his own&#xD;
magnificent fortune, and had worked his way up to the&#xD;
enviable position' he now occupied, by persevering in-&#xD;
dustry. His f:f er died while he was a mere boy,&#xD;
bequeathing to his son only a moderate Competency.&#xD;
By studied economy his iiother was enabled to procure&#xD;
subsistence for herself and son. Though the assistance&#xD;
of friends and his own scanty. patrimony, Mortimer&#xD;
was enabled to receive a Collegiate education. He-&#xD;
&#xD;
ROCFORD.                   29&#xD;
graduated with distinction, and his valedictory was re-&#xD;
ceived with rapturous applause., His mother welcomed&#xD;
him back to the cottage with warm embraces and eyes&#xD;
streaming with the tears of affection. She had often&#xD;
denied herself the necessaries of life to lay by a small&#xD;
sum to purchase clothes for her. darling boy. He saw&#xD;
the world before him as 'the great theatre upon which&#xD;
was to be enacted the great dram; of life. With a bold&#xD;
and dauntless heart, he was contented to step upon the&#xD;
boards and perfo m his part. He had early learned that&#xD;
life is a commingling of the good and the evil; and&#xD;
that man; in a great measure, holds the reins of happi-&#xD;
ness in hi  own hands.&#xD;
What a strange mortal am I, 'thought Mortimer, if,&#xD;
with the -inowledge I possess of human nature, and the&#xD;
modicum of learning that I have gleaned from the in-&#xD;
structions of wise men, I shall not be enabled to buffet&#xD;
the waves of any stream upon which my life-boat may&#xD;
be hereafter cast ? I have only to maintain a firm&#xD;
position upon any question that presents itself to my&#xD;
mind, and combat Prejudice and Ignorance with the&#xD;
weapons of Reason and Common Sense, to obtain the&#xD;
mastery.&#xD;
Mortimer had not taken-into consideration that fortune&#xD;
or position was to be gained by other tian close magage-&#xD;
ment. Neither of the twain is the result of any certain&#xD;
plan of action. Menwho have been noted for chicanery,&#xD;
industry and economy, have as often failed of arriving&#xD;
at distinction, or been disappointed in the accumulation&#xD;
of bags'of golden coins, as those 'who have waited for&#xD;

beach. He had adopted the' law as his professional,&#xD;
though, his fees had been meager in the beginning, and&#xD;
at first he was almost denied the means of subsistence;&#xD;
yet Themis, at times, poured into his. coffers bountiful&#xD;
showers of gold.&#xD;
Fifteen years ofincessant labor and toil found Morti-&#xD;
mer, surely but slowly,'ascending to the topmost round of&#xD;
the ladder in his profession. He had been a. friend to&#xD;
the needy, had combatted.and contended- with error in&#xD;
all its forms and phases, and'Fame was almost within&#xD;
his grasp.'. He had 'nearly overcome the asperities of&#xD;
life, had passed the rapids of nin's existence and was&#xD;
just entering upon the gulf of happiness, when the&#xD;
floTer ,of his youth was.lbeginning to fade. He was4a&#xD;
famous lawyer and bade fair to arrive ,at eminence within&#xD;
a few years, when Miss Josephine Broxton, the belle ;of&#xD;
the State, enriched him withj her heart ,and hand, and&#xD;
encumbered 'him with a magnificent dowry.&#xD;
Mr. iRockford built one of. the most, costly, edifices&#xD;
that was ever' erected in the environs of Crofton. - It&#xD;
was in Crofton that he was born and reared, and it was&#xD;
there that he wished to:pass the remaining years of' .his&#xD;
life.]. Heaven had-smiled upon and blessed.him, and it&#xD;
was far from his purpose ' to desert the scenes -of his&#xD;
childhood. ' Five hundred acres of arable land were at-&#xD;
tached to his homestpad , and the products sof the labor&#xD;
of his slaves were more than equal to his expenditures.&#xD;
Mr. Rockford would have been a mere, madman had hey&#xD;
not appreciated all those advantages of fortune. He&#xD;

V&#xD;
&#xD;
ROCKFORD.&#xD;
&#xD;
was admired; courted, and almost worshipped by the&#xD;
good citizens of the place, yet 'he was not vain of the&#xD;
position he occupied. Honors were showered thick upon&#xD;
him, yet he bore them with meekness.&#xD;
His lovely wife was 'many years his junior, yet she&#xD;
seemed dearer in his eyes; for the discrepancy of age, and&#xD;
she, as a tender vine, clung still closer to, him for pro-&#xD;
tection. If she sighed, it was only when he was not&#xD;
near ; if she grieved, it was at such times as the busi-&#xD;
ness and cares of life were too onerous for the comfort&#xD;
of her husband. She had studied his nature, and his&#xD;
every want was known to her. She had learned to read&#xD;
the workings of his mind by the expression of his fea-&#xD;
tures, and he should not have been surprised that all of&#xD;
his domestic. wants were anticipated.  One year of&#xD;
domestic bliss glided. by, and Sebastian blessed the&#xD;
nuptial couch. The house of 'Rockford was gay with&#xD;
festivities when this lovely child gladdened the hearts of&#xD;
hi devoted parents. They w'iere now united by a strong&#xD;
and heavenly tie. The father had an impetus to speed&#xD;
him still higher ,up the ladder of Fame, and the mother&#xD;
had a tender infant to, nourish, which might rise up&#xD;
hereafter and call her blessed.'&#xD;
Two joyous years passed by, and Sebastian was the&#xD;
lovely child of Rockford house, as' he appeared upon&#xD;
the eventful night of the murder of 'Mr. Winslow. His&#xD;
mother haEdlain him quietlyin his bed and drawn the&#xD;

She had scarcely ever known him to remain- from home&#xD;
longer than the appointed time for his return. She&#xD;
turned over the leaves of the book with 'an air of se=&#xD;
riousndss, as the steady stroke of the pendulum vibrated&#xD;
upon her ear and forced the obedient-hands of the clock&#xD;
to move in their accustomed sphere. Eleven o'clock, and&#xD;
still her husband came not.: She went to the casement&#xD;
and looked anxiously in the direction of the town. Wea-&#xD;
ried out by fruitless vigils, she took her seat by the fire&#xD;
and gave vent to her grief, by a copious shower of tears.&#xD;
In a short time her husband came. The explanation he&#xD;
gave for remaining beyond his limited time, relieved her&#xD;
mind of much anxiety, yet the death of an estimable&#xD;
citizen was a sufficient cause of her sharing the despon-&#xD;
dency of her husband. Blessed Josephine! if no deeper&#xD;
sorrows.ever fall to thy lot than to weep for departed.&#xD;
friends, thou wilt not share the fortune of those, whom&#xD;
adversity has marked out for its prey.&#xD;
The next morning,; while the .Rockfords were seated&#xD;
at the breakfast-table, the conversation took a turn from&#xD;
a lisping word which fell from the lips of Sebastian.&#xD;
He had been dividing his breakfast with Jupe, until the&#xD;
little dog became impatient of being fed by driblets, and&#xD;
seized hold of ope of the boy's feet with his teeth, and&#xD;
playfully bit it,, while Sebastian dealt him a: few hearty&#xD;
blows with his spoon, declaring in his brolien style. of&#xD;
speech, that Jupe should sleep' no more in his little sail-&#xD;
boat.&#xD;
" Josephine," said Mr. Rockford, "this is a cool,&#xD;
&#xD;
33&#xD;
&#xD;
wintry, sunshiny morning. Suppose we take Sebastian&#xD;
and the nurse, and go upon a sailing excursion."&#xD;
"Nothing will give me more pleasure than to gratify&#xD;
you, my husband," said the affectionate wife. "Besides&#xD;
Sebastian and myself both need exercise and a change&#xD;
of air. The breeze has just sprung up, and as there&#xD;
are no indications of a storm, we will set out upon the&#xD;
excursion as soon as I can prepare a sufficient supply of&#xD;
provisions for the day."&#xD;
"You need not tarry for that purpose, my love," said&#xD;
the husband,.-"the ship Ellen is anchore only a league&#xD;
from shore, and her commander has giv~n me several&#xD;
pressing invitations to visit him before he leaves the&#xD;
port. When once we' have ascended upon the deck of&#xD;
his ship, I, am, certain we will be close prisoners for the&#xD;
day.&#xD;
The preparations for their departure were soon made.&#xD;
Seated in the pleasure-boat that was kept for the especial&#xD;
accommodation othe family, the Rockfords were soon&#xD;
sailing upon the bosom of the Atlantic. Sebastian&#xD;
would clap his'hands for joy when a porpoise would&#xD;
emerge from the waves in its rotary evolutions. The&#xD;
sea gulls would almost strike the sails of the boat with&#xD;
their snowy wings, as if they were tendering to the&#xD;
party a joyous welcome to the crested waves.&#xD;
"Look, Josephine, how small the sails and.hull of the&#xD;
ship appear in the distance. The wings of that gull that&#xD;
flew by then, are large in comparison' to the rigging of&#xD;
the ship, at this distance. Within the space of an hour,&#xD;

" True, Mr. IRockford, the pleasures of life,- like the&#xD;
uncertain future, are -in the distance,. yet we are not&#xD;
sure of ever having them within, our grasp. A slight&#xD;
misguidance of the pilot at the helm, a.sudden and un-&#xD;
looked for storm springing up, and the possibility of&#xD;
our reaching the ship would be only in the scope of&#xD;
Omnipotence."&#xD;
"KBt, Josephine, suppose we should have no faith in&#xD;
the security of our boat, and entirely distrust the capa-&#xD;
city of the pilot, would we not despair of reaching the&#xD;
point of our destination?  Why have we deserted the&#xD;
land and embarked upon the sea?  You answer, for a&#xD;
change, and to gratify a mere whim. We live to learn,&#xD;
and desire to see what we have learned to admire,' from&#xD;
descriptions of good authors. As young as Sebastian&#xD;
is, the scenes of this day may never fade from his mind.&#xD;
His memory as'yet is as a dream; but striking scenes&#xD;
may 'awake it to a reality.  One hour to a child is as&#xD;
long as day to an adult. Frequent changes of scenery&#xD;
are beneficial to them, yet it is better for them to go but&#xD;
little into he company of strangers."&#xD;
The breeze blew briskly, and the helmsman performed&#xD;
his part well. The boat was soonnugly secured along-&#xD;
side of the ship. In a few jninutes the party ascended&#xD;
the ship's ladder, and were ushered into the  spacious&#xD;
saloon. The rockiigof the vessel was at first unpleas-&#xD;

along the beach. Sebastian was perfectly amazed to&#xD;
see so many objects of attraction. The door kuo s,&#xD;
locks, tippings and dastors- up n the chairs, occupied his&#xD;
attention. He rolled the single ottomans about, to tie&#xD;
amusement of the Captain, who took quite a fancy to&#xD;
him, and had him supplied  with candies and nuts in&#xD;
abundance. Captain. Walsingham was an old fried&#xD;
and college-mateof Mr. Rockford's, and had frequently&#xD;
spent a day with him at Rockford house, while the&#xD;
Ellen was lying in port.&#xD;
"My dear Mrs. Rockfordj said the polite Captain.&#xD;
"it affords mc much pleasure to welcome you and my&#xD;
friend of former days aboard of my vessel. It is e&#xD;
pleasure I have long sought and heartily desired. The&#xD;
best plan that we can conceive of, by which to preserve.&#xD;
old friendships, is cordial and happy re-unions.&#xD;
"You are extremely kind, Captain Walsingham.-&#xD;

Mrs. Rockford was'left to amuse herself with Sebas-&#xD;

Rockford and Captain Walsingham, each, provided with&#xD;
a spy-glass, a:m used themselves a few minutes in taking&#xD;

catchers are playing havoc with the mnollusk fribe. One&#xD;
of the crew has just raised the grapplers from the deep&#xD;
bed, and another is receiving the huge mass. Large&#xD;
quantities are produced from one mother shell, around&#xD;
which they cling until their own. weight breaks them off&#xD;
into sections."&#xD;
"Look again," said Rockford in reply to the Captain,&#xD;
" one of the men has fallen overboard. The waves have&#xD;
almost washed him from their reach. Now they have&#xD;
succeeded in throwing him- a line. He is safe among&#xD;
them again, and they are applying a canteen of spirits&#xD;
to his lips. What a happy set of fellows they must be ?'&#xD;
"Yes, indeed," replied the Captain, "they think but&#xD;
little of the past, and the future to them is not penetra-&#xD;
ted by hopes or fears. They are 'hale fellows well met,'&#xD;
who make the most of the present time. I have frequent&#xD;
visits from men, of this class while lying at anchor in&#xD;
various ports. They barter large quantities of fish and&#xD;
oysters to me for provisions. Those men yousee at the&#xD;
bar paid me a visit yesterday, and I purchased .some of&#xD;
their cargo."&#xD;
" I think," said Rockford,, "they are the sea-faring&#xD;
portion of the' fish-mongers who dwell in those filthy huts&#xD;
near our wharf."&#xD;
"It is highly probable," replied the Captain., "They&#xD;
related to me yesterday, that they had been attacked by&#xD;
a party of desperate looking men in bats, and their&#xD;
fish and oysters taken from them. They supposed that&#xD;
the men were a portion of bnditti; whodhave a retreat&#xD;
not many miles from shore." '&#xD;
&#xD;
"This must be looked into," rejoined Rockford. "The'&#xD;
police must have the country diligently searched.&#xD;
The gentlemen, arm in arm, walked the quarter-desk,&#xD;
talking socially about their college scrapes. Their mer-&#xD;
ry peals of laughter often attracted the attention of the&#xD;
crew, who were busily engaged in hoisting packages of&#xD;
merchandise from the hold of the vessel and lowering&#xD;
them upon the lighter, or 'scow, which was to convey&#xD;
them across the bar to Crofton. The friends continued&#xD;
their walk, and the jolly crew sang theii- songs and&#xD;
turned the windlass. They were devoted to the Cap-&#xD;
and his slightest command was executed by towery&#xD;
one, from the mate down to, the sailor-boy.&#xD;
When the dinner hour approached, Captain Walsing-&#xD;
ham led the way 'to the saloon, where Mrs. Rockford&#xD;
and Sebastian were. The little boy had made' friends&#xD;
with a large Newfoundland dog belonging to Captain&#xD;
Walsingham.&#xD;
"Sebastian is. very fond of dogs," said his father.&#xD;
"He has a little pet at home which is as dear to him as&#xD;
his parents."&#xD;
"He shall have the Newfoundland, too, if you will&#xD;
be encumbered with him, Rockford," remarked the Cap-&#xD;
tam. "Carlo is a royal dog, and'will guard any treas-&#xD;
urre with fidelity that may be placed under 'his 'care.&#xD;
"I accept the gift for Sebastian with much pleasure,"&#xD;
said Rockford.&#xD;
Dinner was announced, andthe party were soon seated&#xD;
at a table which was spread with all the delicacies of the&#xD;
season. When the first and second courses were ended,&#xD;
the wines and fruits were brought out.&#xD;

the rings of the boat, and struggled and howled pit-&#xD;

Just as the sun dipped his red disc into the sea, the&#xD;
Rockfords stepped on-shore and sought their home. The&#xD;
servants made fast the boat, and took home the oars and&#xD;

CHAPTER V.&#xD;
IT is a difficult thing, indeed, to give racy descriptions&#xD;
of the scenes of every-day life; but those descriptions&#xD;
if faithfully portrayed, are more eagerly read, and pro-&#xD;
duce a more lasting impression on the, mind than a&#xD;
treatise upon abstruse subjects. Divest literature of .its&#xD;
'common-place scenes, which are introduced by authors&#xD;
to fill up the acts of the drama, and you remove one of&#xD;
the main propswhich support the fabric of fiction.  One&#xD;
writer may spin out numberless pages upon an evening&#xD;
excursion, and sustain a fair. reputation for authorship,&#xD;
yet the trivial scenes, clothed in such beautiful language,&#xD;
will scarcely survive the first edition of a work. The&#xD;
imagination of the reader may not be so lucid as that of&#xD;
the writer,! and it becomes necessary to paint each scene&#xD;
with appropriate colors. Another writer may introduce&#xD;
characters of an heroic -caste into his work, yet. if the&#xD;
picture is not faithfully sketched, and the back-ground&#xD;
made to correspond with the subject-matter, the delin-&#xD;
eator has mixed his colors in vain..&#xD;
Some of the most noted authors have preferred to&#xD;
introduce the best scenes of their works in the opening&#xD;
chapters, in order that the attention. of the reader may&#xD;
at once be arrested, but the denouement of the plot may&#xD;
expand into airy nothingness. The Illiad of Homer,&#xD;
one of the most beautiful poems that was ever written&#xD;

in any language, and perfect in. all its parts, is d re-&#xD;
markable exception to the general rule, inasmuch as the&#xD;
illustrious author plunges into, medias res, and presents&#xD;
the tero in a revengeful mood, about to decide the des-&#xD;
tinies of two great),contending nations, by retiring from&#xD;
the war which his valor alone could win. .But is it not,&#xD;
preferable to commence with the beginning, and enjoy&#xD;
the pleasure of filling up each scene in thelife of your&#xD;
hero; not leaving it for the imagination of the reader to&#xD;
supply the vacuum ?  The taste of the intelligent reader&#xD;
is the best arbiter.&#xD;
Such a thing has happened, where self-styled critics&#xD;
have disputed about the identity of .the rightful hero or&#xD;
heroine of a novel. It is an evidence of an erratic ge-&#xD;
nius to clothe the hero in habiliments so similar to those&#xD;
of the prominent characters, that the distinction is dif-&#xD;
ficult. For fear that some critics may wrangle about&#xD;
the hero of this work, it. is proper to state right here&#xD;
that Sebastian, and nit his father, is the hero of: this&#xD;
novel. Who would careto record the actions of a more&#xD;
promising lad than the little curly haired boy that was&#xD;
the light, and life of Rockford house?&#xD;
A few days subsequent. to the advent of the New-&#xD;
foundland dog to his new home, Sebastian was playing&#xD;
a the veranda with his pets. Carlo was one of,. the&#xD;
largest size of his species, while Jupe was 'the most "di-&#xD;
...  tive of his race! The one was large, muscular and&#xD;
dtcapted to the performance of feats that required&#xD;
strength -and agility; the other was exceedingly&#xD;
sn.all, 'feeble, and, seemed .to have been formed for a&#xD;

a bull-dog concentrated in his heart. At times, when&#xD;
Carlo would irritate him, he would bite him upon the&#xD;
nose with',all the vengeance of an adder. The only&#xD;
punishment Carlo -inflicted upon 1him for. his misdeeds&#xD;
was both laughable and tanta zing. He would seize&#xD;
Jupe carefully around the body and bear him off be-&#xD;
tween his huge jaws. .After running across the yard a&#xD;
few times,' at a pace so. brisk that, the poodle would lose&#xD;
his breath; Carlo would deposit the culprit upon the&#xD;
steps of the veranda for resuscitation.&#xD;
Sebastian had learned to ride upon the back of Carlo&#xD;
with perfect safety. Upon the morning on ,which the&#xD;
boy and his pets were introduced upon the veranda, Sc-&#xD;
bastian had just finished feeding them. His mother,&#xD;
hearing her son express . a desire to ride, walked .out&#xD;
upon 'the veranda and placed him upon Carlo's back..&#xD;
Jupe expressed a desire to ride also, by holding up his&#xD;
fore-paws and barking piteously. Mrs. Rockford placed&#xD;
Jipe in Sebastian's arms. Carlo had not the least ob-&#xD;
jection in the world to carrying his young master, but&#xD;
with the addition of Jupe to -his burden he trotted off&#xD;
that morning in no good frame of mind. If the weight&#xD;
of Jupe had not been the hundredth fraction of an ounce&#xD;
the principle woulhave been the same with the et    .,&#xD;
fallen Carlo. He laid up a good shaking for the pol&#xD;
when the next overt. act should be committed.&#xD;
Carlo carried his riders out upon the lawn in front of&#xD;

the spacious mansion, where-he met Mr. Rockford just&#xD;
returning from town. Theparent was much delighted&#xD;
at the, sport of Sebastian and Jupe. He conducted the&#xD;
obedient Carlo back to the house, where he was disen-&#xD;
cumbered of his load.&#xD;
Mr. Rockford was particularly fond of the enjoy ents&#xD;
of home. His early years had been spent upon the&#xD;
arena of abusy life; and when the period had arrived&#xD;
for him to assume the responsibilities of a married man,&#xD;
the major portion of his leisure hours was passed, in&#xD;
the bosom of his family.&#xD;
When Mr. Rockford seated Sebastian by his side in&#xD;
the sitting room on that morning, the curiosity of the&#xD;
boy was greatly exercised- about -the ~contents of his&#xD;
father's pockets. , As was his usual custom, he diligent-&#xD;
ly searched them until he was enabled to draw forth his&#xD;
candies and fruits, which were usually stored in those&#xD;
receptacles in large quantities.&#xD;
4"What'news do you bring from town, Mr. Rockford ?"&#xD;
said the Wife, as she seated' herself for the purpose of&#xD;
resuming her never-ending, work of embroidery.&#xD;
"There are strange rumors afloat in Crofton," replied&#xD;
Mr. Rockford. "They say there is a band .of robbers&#xD;
not magiy miles from the town. Several suspicious men&#xD;
} have been seen lurking about the jail since the confine-&#xD;
of Royston, and it is now believed that he has&#xD;
mysteriouslyly connected with them for two or three&#xD;

more about those lawless men than -he cares to relate.&#xD;
The jailoi- has been instructed by the proper authorities&#xD;
to have the prisoner closely guarded."&#xD;
Mr. Rockford had a select library. Every good work&#xD;
of ancient and modern times formed his tasty collection.&#xD;
Shakspeare, Milton, Pope and Dryden were his favorite&#xD;
poets. It was from them he had derived that exquis-&#xD;
ite taste in the selection of words.that lent so much&#xD;
beauty to his speeches.' He had perused a thousand&#xD;
books before he was thoroughly   convinced that all&#xD;
knowledge is contained in a few volumes. He was fond&#xD;
of reading histories, particularly those that contained&#xD;
the records of ancient heroes. ,He had learned to di-&#xD;
vide the reigns of princes of 'different kingdoms into&#xD;
periods. He was never at a loss how to place events in&#xD;
their proper chronological order. His law books were&#xD;
never neglected, being read and studied by, him with&#xD;
system. The English and American Reports of the&#xD;
decisions of cases at Common Law, were as familiar to&#xD;
him as household words. It was a-thorough kiiowledge&#xD;
of those works, and a practical application of 'the same,&#xD;
that rendered him so formidable a competitor to his&#xD;
compeers at the bar.&#xD;
He employed his time ,chiefly in the investigation of&#xD;
his cases, when not too busily engaged in the mechan-&#xD;
ical formulas of the profession. He was never takan&#xD;
by surprise when one of his cases was called in Co&#xD;
The Spring Session of the Superior Court wasto com&#xD;
mence within a -few weeks, and he bent all his energies&#xD;
upon a proper preparation for the prosecution of Roys&#xD;

sel. He was a conscientious man, who did not desire,&#xD;
to receive five-thousand dollars without rendering his&#xD;
client an equivalent for the same.&#xD;
Time ever speeds by rapidly when we are engaged.:&#xD;
An unusually large gathering about the Court house&#xD;
square gave indications that the Court was upon the&#xD;
point of convening.&#xD;
The Spring had come in .that warm, beautiful clime of&#xD;
the South, and Nature had put on .a gay dress. The&#xD;
woods were enameled with flowers, and every hedge&#xD;
was green with vernal beauty. The feathered songsters&#xD;
sang their matins from the bush, and every animated&#xD;
creature rejoiced in the return of Spring. Beautiful&#xD;
ha py season, would that thy reign could last forever&#xD;
The Grand Jury found a true hill against Royston&#xD;
or murder, during the first day of the Session, and&#xD;
when the case was called up, an unusually large crowd&#xD;
assembled to witness the trial. The couhsel for Roys-&#xD;

case managed upon the part of the prosecution, a mo-&#xD;

was one of the crowning acts of his life. He had never&#xD;
been known to make a failure at the bar, but, upon this&#xD;
occasion, his success was commensurate' with the- fame&#xD;
he had previously achieved as a criminal lawyer. The&#xD;
Court House was filled to overflowing with the citizens,&#xD;
and strangers from the neighboring counties, who had&#xD;
been induced to attend, to listen to the speech of a dis--&#xD;
tinguished man in a case of such vital importance to the&#xD;
State and community. Mr. Rockford received the con-&#xD;
gratulations of his friends 'with that degree of modesty&#xD;
natural to one so gifted.&#xD;
Duty, in his eyes, was more to be valued than the&#xD;
hue and cry after popularity. Unless he considered&#xD;
that he was entitled to commendation, he. would have&#xD;
shrunk from applause, and desired his friends to have&#xD;
lavished their praises upon one more deserving. Popu-&#xD;
larity is like the' current of a stream, the more auxil-&#xD;
iaries it receives, the more swollen will be the current,&#xD;
and the more readily will it be enabled to overcome&#xD;
obstacles in its headlong course. But, instead of en-&#xD;
deavoring to augment his popularity, Rockford discour-&#xD;
aged all propositions' tending to his own advancement.&#xD;
The law, especially the criminal portion, is fraught&#xD;
with many difficulties. It is not an easy task, to recon-&#xD;
cile the law with the evidence and make a point; nor is&#xD;
it less difficult to convince a client that justice has been&#xD;
done to him, or ,a culprit that no advantage has been&#xD;
taken of his dependent condition. Those who embark&#xD;
in {the profession must make up-their minds. to sailupon&#xD;
a tempestuous sea. It is very much to be feared that&#xD;

the majority, of lawyers become case-hardened,. after "t&#xD;
few years of successful practice;. but it must be remem-&#xD;
beredythat all secular professions have their abuses.&#xD;
Mi. Rockford had never courted the popular favor of&#xD;
the world or his advancement to honorable positions,&#xD;
but his mind had been bent almost entirely upon the&#xD;
acquisition of PROPERTY. He had seen the advantages&#xD;
arising from the influence of WEALTI bIf he . did not&#xD;
acknowledge its power, the WORLD did. It is as profit-&#xD;
able to blow your 'breath against the whirlwind as to&#xD;
move in opposition to the popular current. The actions&#xD;
of one man may be Herculean in comparison to those of&#xD;
another; yet, when weighed in the balance against the&#xD;
deeds of thousands, the scales are turned upon the side&#xD;
of the majority. Somecontend that the whole force of&#xD;
government is ruled by compromises, but its -own ab-&#xD;
surdity refutes the admission. A. party which admits&#xD;
the force of compromises, will have but little else to do&#xD;
but to make and support them. 'Rockford was a happy&#xD;
exception:to meh who are guided, in the main, by con-&#xD;
ventional rules. He steered very safely between Scylla'&#xD;
and Charyhdis, neither asking nor courting popular&#xD;
favor.&#xD;
Thirty years ago, the period -at which this story&#xD;
opens, our Government was supported more according&#xD;
to the tenets of JUSTICE, TRUTH and MODERATION, than&#xD;
has been of late years. There was not such an in-&#xD;
e  lity in the dispensation of justice, as at the present&#xD;
time. The contending parties, if they differed mate-&#xD;
rially, based the discrepancy, of their views upon other&#xD;
&#xD;
than sectional grounds. If the laws, then, were rightly&#xD;
administered, and made to redound to the glory and&#xD;
happiness of a State, the cause was attributed, to the&#xD;
correctness of self-government. If a State is made to&#xD;
bear the burdens of other sections of aFederal Govern-&#xD;
ment, the remedy to correct the-evil is not within its&#xD;
own hands, and there is no. virtue, then, in State Sov&#xD;
ereignty while the 'people submit.&#xD;
Rockford was not a mercenary man, but he 'had a&#xD;
sufficient quantity of pride to speed him forward in the&#xD;
performance of anything in which he thought his DUTY&#xD;
was enlisted. He had made a powerful effort to convict&#xD;
Royston of the heinous crime of murder, and had sue-&#xD;
ceeded. - He did not fear or care for the consequences&#xD;
while his conscience was not disquieted. It had been&#xD;
intimated to him that Royston was not without friends,&#xD;
and the promptness with which competent counsel had&#xD;
been employed to defend him, corroborated this 'belief.&#xD;
It was supposed that he had been intimately connected&#xD;
with a band of robbers, whose degradations, of late,&#xD;
were assuming an importance not to be overlooked by&#xD;
those who had rights to maintain. It was even supposed&#xD;
that the wire-workers of that band were frequent visi-&#xD;
tors to the town, and might he not have endangered' his&#xD;
life and property by discharging his duty so well? 4d-&#xD;
mitting this to be true, lie had pledged himself to be&#xD;
faithful to his trust, and no obstructions could thwart&#xD;
his plans, or remove him from the course of his duty.&#xD;
The laws had been seriously violated, the life of a&#xD;
good citizen 'had been unjustly taken, and was it a&#xD;

tierest where the fashions and prejudices-of the" citizens&#xD;
are allowed to govern it. If wealth were more equally&#xD;
distributed among the people, a Moderate degree of&#xD;
splendor might not be objectionable. - But the-majority&#xD;
of those who are constant attendants upon Divine ser-&#xD;
vice belong to the class of those who are supported by&#xD;
their daily labor. They never feel at home in the midst&#xD;
of so 'much splendor as is sometimes lavished upon, the&#xD;

The organ struck up an anthem, and the choir joined,&#xD;
in sweet harmony. The Minister read out the morning&#xD;

=his discourse he alluded feelingly to the recent painful&#xD;

Mr. Rockford and his family were conveyed to their&#xD;
splendid mansion in their costly carriage. When they&#xD;
were summoned to dinner, the husband and wife com-&#xD;
menedd the meal in silence, but they were soon engaged&#xD;
in social converse.&#xD;
"My dear," said Mr. Rockford, " is it not strange&#xD;
that we who enjoy so many blessings, should live so&#xD;
neglectful in the performance of our duty ?"&#xD;
A tear glistened in the eye of Mrs. Rockford, as she&#xD;
heard this 'confession from ithe lips of her husbyand&#xD;
She knew that he was not what the world calls a wicked&#xD;
man, but his mind had been so bent upon the acquisition&#xD;
of property that he had been too negligent in returning&#xD;
thanks to God for tthe many blessings with which he&#xD;
was surrounded."&#xD;
"Truly, my'husband; we are all too sinful. We are&#xD;
too apt to forget God while He is so good to us. It is&#xD;
only when his afflicting rod is scourging us that we re-&#xD;
member Him. .He afflicts us that we may be drawn more&#xD;
closely into His fold. Suppose He should take Sebastian&#xD;
from us, would we not be bowed down With sorrow ?"&#xD;
As the eyes of Mr. Rockford rested upon the beauti-&#xD;
ful face of his child, his heart was filled 'with .pride&#xD;
mingled with sorrow. He knew that if the boyshould&#xD;
be spared to him, his own life might flow on in one un-&#xD;
interrupted stream of happiness, but should an early&#xD;
death remove him from the.home of his dear parents,&#xD;
that sorrow would fill that house forevermore.&#xD;

&#xD;
Mr. Rockford had arrived at the- period.of life when&#xD;
it behooved him to render those around him all the as-&#xD;
sistance that lay in his power. He resolved from that&#xD;
day to commence a reform. His. example might tend&#xD;
much towards influencing others to- leave off from fol-&#xD;
-   lowing in the evil pathsof sin.&#xD;
But how to commence, that reform was certainly. a&#xD;
difficult thing. As he sat in his studio upon that holy&#xD;
Sabbath-evening, and beheld with what glee Sebastian&#xD;
sported among the flowers that were just opening to the&#xD;
kisses of Spring, he felt as if his Maker had sent his&#xD;
son as a blessing, and his own example would either&#xD;
pr phare his. offspring for happiness, or consign him to'&#xD;
the shades of misery.&#xD;
He had endeavored to live justly and conform to the&#xD;
.laws of the land, but, upon an examination of his own&#xD;
heart, he discovered that the laws of ,God required more&#xD;
than the mere observance of a creed which is upheld&#xD;
merely by the basis of morality. He had been influ-&#xD;
enced too much by the subtle .teachings of those who,&#xD;
though not militating against the established usages of&#xD;
orthodox church doctrines, invited them to pin their&#xD;
faith to moral principles, which were not dissimilar to&#xD;
those tenets taught by the ancient philosophers.&#xD;
He had not sought his knowledge, in a prayerful man-&#xD;
ner, from the great fountain of, divinity-the Bible.&#xD;
Henceforth he would not .neglect the blessed volume.&#xD;
If any of our readers are in doubt as to any question&#xD;
which should guide them. aright, in. a mQral point of&#xD;
view, let. them search the Scriptures-the tenets of men&#xD;
are dangerous guides.&#xD;

* The Sabbath passed, and the week with its busy&#xD;
scenes was ushered in. Each one of the citizens of the&#xD;
place was busy in the pursuit of his daily occupation.&#xD;
Mr. Snibbens had turned over several new leaves in his&#xD;
classics, and as many in-his translations. 'His scholars&#xD;
were flogged and "turned back" when they advanced&#xD;
too rapidly for him. Mr. Samuel Culverhouse and his&#xD;
amiable wife still prepared wholesome viands for their&#xD;
boarders. Mr. Simpkins sold his goods to those' who&#xD;
gave him their patronage, and the affairs of the town&#xD;
moved on smoothly. The Ellen had been heavily laden&#xD;
with the staple produce of the country, and had sailed&#xD;
to foreign ports. The Captain promised Mr. Rockford&#xD;
to pay him a visit upon his return, and bring many cu-&#xD;
riosities and presents for Sebastiai, for whom he 'had&#xD;
manifested much love.&#xD;
Those who dwell in fine houses, and are blest with the&#xD;
goods of this world, are rarely, if ever, wanting in&#xD;
friends and relatives. Rockford house was noted for&#xD;
its. hospitality. A few days after the Sabbath evening&#xD;
reveries' of the proprietor, several friends alighted at&#xD;
his gate. Mr. Rockford felt that it was not good to be&#xD;
alone, and he hastened to welcome them. As he )has-&#xD;
tened across the long front yard, which intervened be-&#xD;
tween the house and the outer street, he recognized&#xD;
several friends and relatives whom he had not seen for&#xD;
several years. He should now have an opportunity of&#xD;
presenting them to his dear Josephine. She had never&#xD;
seen them, but his friends were ever dear to her.&#xD;

Cousin Roxana,. this is indeed' a surprise. Josephine&#xD;
will be so glad to see you. Cousin Frances, how you&#xD;
have grown ! Mr. Watson, you and Mr. Judson assist&#xD;
the ladies to the house, while T look after your bag-&#xD;
gageMrs. Rockford, arriving just at this time, was for-&#xD;
inally presented to each one of her guests by her hus-&#xD;
band. They were conducted to the spacious niansion&#xD;
by the good lady. Rooms were speedily prepared for&#xD;
the new c omers, and Rockford house was no longer a&#xD;
quiet residence, but it seemed more- like a crowded ho-&#xD;
tel at a watering place than the dwelling of a private&#xD;
family.&#xD;
The-horses of the. visitors were properly cared for,&#xD;
and soon occupied the well filled stables. The carriages&#xD;
were rubbed. off and rolled under the spacious sheds,&#xD;
and every thing was in a happy bustle that lived, breath-&#xD;
ed and moved upon that homestead. We 'live only for&#xD;
our friends, thought Mr. Rockford, as he arrayed him-&#xD;
self in a new suit of clothes which he had never yet&#xD;
worn. Selfishness was no part of his nature, and what&#xD;
he enjoyed, his friends were welcome t~o share with him.&#xD;
He' surveyed himself in the long mirror, and was not at&#xD;
all displeased with'his own personal appearance. It is&#xD;
true a few gray hairs were intermi'igled with his flowing&#xD;
locks; but he knew he had arrived at that period of life&#xD;
when gray hairs were expected. We have said he was-&#xD;
satisfied with his appearance. The reader would have&#xD;
acknowledged Mr. Rockford's claims to fine looks, we&#xD;
&#xD;
will not say to beauty, for that term should never be&#xD;
applied to men.&#xD;
As we have said before, Rockford house was the very&#xD;
home of hospitality. The building was very large, and&#xD;
commanded;, not only a good view, of the ocean, but a&#xD;
person' stationed. in the observatory might overlook the&#xD;
whole.region. The eight spacious rooms upon the first&#xD;
floor were occupied, principally, by the family and the&#xD;
select friends and relatives who blessed the house with&#xD;
their protracted visits. The eight rooms on the second&#xD;
floor were used as the apartments of those who were&#xD;
merely spending a few days as friends.    The four&#xD;
rooms of the third story were occupied. when the house&#xD;
was crowded to overflowing. Those rooms were resort-&#xD;
ed to by Mr. Rockford, when he wished to retire from&#xD;
the din -and bustle of his family. The front of the&#xD;
building was adorned-with massive columns, which ex-&#xD;
tended from the 'main piazza to the roofing, giving beau-&#xD;
ty and strength to the entire structure. . At the landing&#xD;
of the second and third stories, a veranda extended&#xD;
out for the accommodation of a small party who might&#xD;
desire to enjoy a tete-ajtete, and yet have the benefit of&#xD;
the sea breezes. The house was built of brick, and&#xD;
stuccoed after the most, approved style, and so accurate-&#xD;
ly penciled as to 'present the appearance of a grand&#xD;
marble pile. Every room of this magnificent structure&#xD;
was supplied with furniture to correspond with its ex-&#xD;
ternal appearance.' The well' trained servants moved&#xD;
like clock-work in their appointed spheres. Few were&#xD;
the orders given at' Rockford house, for when the ser-&#xD;

Mrs. Margery Fairfield was an aunt of Mr. Rock-&#xD;
ford's. She was a lady of moderate fortune, who re-&#xD;
sided at Colonna, one of the .heighb9ring towns. Her&#xD;
husband had. died only a few years previous to the visit&#xD;
of the good lady to her relative. Her two daughters,&#xD;
Roxana and Frances, who had   mpleted their educa-&#xD;
tion, were her only children. Thomas Watson and&#xD;
Reginald Judson, were agreeable acquaintances, who,&#xD;
' had kindly consented to. be their visiting companions.&#xD;
After the visitors had been conducted to their rooms,&#xD;
and sufficient time had elapsed for them to perform their&#xD;
ablutions, and exchange a'traveling for a more comely&#xD;
dress, the company assembled in the drawing-room. It&#xD;
was a goodly siglft to see how the countenance of each&#xD;
one was wreathed with smiles. Mr. Rockford could'but&#xD;
anticipate a pleasant time with his visitors. If time&#xD;
should pass sluggishly, and the hours should be inter-&#xD;
spersed with moments of gloom, his carriages or pleas-&#xD;
are-boat should be put int9 requisition.&#xD;
Mr. Rockford again welcomed the party to his house,&#xD;
and'wished them to put off all restraint and seek what&#xD;
means of enjoyment that might be within their grasp.&#xD;
The company were soon engaged in an animated .con-&#xD;
a versation, in which Mr. Rockford and aunt -Margery&#xD;
took the lead. The young mei; the cousins and Mrs.&#xD;
Rockford were not long in becoming acquainted. Se-&#xD;
bastian and his pets were inot overlooked, At length,&#xD;
when themparty had ezpes ed a desire to promenade&#xD;

upon the terraces, Mr. Rockford led'them out in front&#xD;
of the building. They were struck with admiration at&#xD;
the beauty of the evergreen hedges, and the vast quan-&#xD;
tity , of early Spring flowers, which were thus early&#xD;
scenting the lawn. The area just in front, of the house&#xD;
bloomed with flowers. A little farther on, the giant&#xD;
oaks, and- the-trees which were planted by the proprie-&#xD;
tor of the place, covered the ground with a' continuous&#xD;
shade.&#xD;
After spending an hour in an agreeable conversation,&#xD;
and enjoying a delightful walk, the company retired to&#xD;
their rooms to make preparations for dinner.&#xD;
What mortal is there, who is free from the horrible&#xD;
pangs of'dyspepsia, that' does not welcome the dinner&#xD;
hour ? Poems have been written upon it, or'ations have&#xD;
been pronounced upon it, yet the theme is inexhaustible.&#xD;
The ancients revered it ; the moderns do not scorn it;&#xD;
and we, oh ! Epicurus, do not hate it. Take away our&#xD;
breakfast or supper, but' let us not be far distant from&#xD;
the smoking. viands that .roast upon the spit, or thp&#xD;
brown pheasants that float in the golden gravy, with all&#xD;
the little extras that fill up the spare corners of the&#xD;
ovens. .Let us not be far from' those when the tintin-&#xD;
nabulation of the dinner-bell is heard.&#xD;
Reader, did you ever enjoy a good dinner when twenty&#xD;
miles of travel had given you a good appetite, and you-&#xD;
had become sick of home fare ? If not, you have yet&#xD;
something to live for.&#xD;

CHAPTER. VII.             '&#xD;
The majority of mankind rejoice in the blessings that&#xD;
are poured out upon them from day to day, without re-&#xD;
turning thanks to the great Giver of good ind perfect&#xD;
gifts. It is a common saying, that tthe hog never looks&#xD;
up to him who threshes down the acorns.'. It is never&#xD;
more perfectly exemplified than in the conduct of some&#xD;
men, who seem to be perfectly devoid of all moral prin-&#xD;
ciple.&#xD;
'Fortune, it is true, showers its blessings, indiscrim-&#xD;
inately,.upon the just and unjust. The rains of Heaven&#xD;
descend with equalmeasure upon saint and sinner; the&#xD;
fortunes of the hour are within the grasp of the prince&#xD;
and the: peasant. Whether the happiness of our little&#xD;
hero is controlled entirely by chance, or not, the writer&#xD;
deposeth not._&#xD;
W'e, at present, must follow the'happy party into the&#xD;
spacious hall of Rockford house. It was arranged with&#xD;
everyconvenience that modern taste could fashion out.&#xD;
We shall not give a minute description of it, leaving the&#xD;
imagination of the reader to ornament the scenes.&#xD;
The table was bountifully spread with costly viands,&#xD;
which could not fail to tempt the Palate of the most&#xD;
fastidious. Mr. Rockford seated himself' at the head&#xD;
of the well-supplied board, and bide his guests be seat-&#xD;
&#xD;
ROCKFORD.                     59&#xD;
ed and enjoy the bounties of Rockford house. It was&#xD;
his peculiar delight to" have his friends surround his&#xD;
table, and enjoy the comforts of his well filled larder.&#xD;
Conversation is the fountain from which flows the source&#xD;
of enjoyment at the dinner-table. Without its aid, the&#xD;
sumptuous feast is spread in vain. The most marked&#xD;
attention upon the part of the host, without a due ap-&#xD;
preciation of the guests, is -a vain effort to effect enjoy.&#xD;
ment. Mr. Rockford had studied the philosophy of the&#xD;
ancients and the more refined of the moderns, and was&#xD;
prepared, upon all occasions, to render any company&#xD;
into which he mignt be thrown, agreeable.&#xD;
"Homer had a pleasant and very agreeable faculty,&#xD;
Mr. Watson," said Mr. Rockford, "of ,describing a&#xD;
feast, and lending to the assembly a grandiloquent flow&#xD;
of conversation, to enliven it."&#xD;
"True," replied the guest, who was never more at&#xD;
home than in descanting upon his favorite authors.&#xD;
"Homer supposed, and that truthfully, that a feast&#xD;
without conversation was a ludicrous thing. It would&#xD;
have 'appeared in his eyes, as if the guests had been in&#xD;
vited to a funeral, rather than to the board of merri-&#xD;
ment, if the flow of sentiment were of consequence&#xD;
obliged to be restricted."&#xD;
" Who has not been touched with the lines in.Homer ?&#xD;
"Then spread the tables. the repast prepare,&#xD;
Each takes his seat, and each ,receives his share.&#xD;
When now the rage of' hunger was repressed,&#xD;
With pure libations they conclude the feast."&#xD;
"But," replied Mr. Watson, "the sentiment, as ex-&#xD;
pressed in those lines, is rather an - invitation to youth&#xD;
enjoy the luxuries of the wine cup."&#xD;

"Not at all," said the good host. "In those days,&#xD;
when liquors were unadulterated, there was but little&#xD;
drunkenness. Men were supposed to be guided more&#xD;
by reason and common sense than they are how.- The&#xD;
feast, or even an extraordinary dining, was not supposed&#xD;
to be complete without the introduction of wine. If&#xD;
men would only drink the juice of the graped in moder-&#xD;
ation, we should have no cases of intoxication."&#xD;
Mr. Judson, who had been endeavoring to entertain&#xD;
the ladies in the meantime, joined in the conversation,&#xD;
and the meal passed off to the satisfaction of every one&#xD;
present. The meats, dainties, fruits and wines were&#xD;
served in turn. When the last course was served, the&#xD;
company retired from, the hall to enjoy the evening as&#xD;
the fates might degree, r as their host might see 'proper.&#xD;
He is a happy man A ho can make the best plans for&#xD;
enjoyment. The wises men have failed in this partic-&#xD;
ular. In vain we often sit and ponder over the best&#xD;
matured plans of action. The occurrences of an hour&#xD;
may supply us with the means of enjoyment, or may&#xD;
snatch from us every vestige of that basis of enjoyment-&#xD;
which may be fraught with pleasure.&#xD;
The visitors of Mr. Rockford, in a very few days,&#xD;
became domesticated, and distant formalities were aban-&#xD;
doned.. The -amusenents consisted of excursions along&#xD;
the coast in theypleasure-boats belonging to Mr. Rock-&#xD;
ford, or the carriages conveyed the guests to the; roman-&#xD;
tic portions of the surrounding country. Mr. Watson&#xD;
was particularly fond of the society of Miss Roxana&#xD;
Fairfield, the elder of the beautiful sisters, while she&#xD;
&#xD;
ROOKFORD.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
was not indifferent to his polite attentions. He had&#xD;
commenced the practice of the Law atgColonna, under&#xD;
the most favorable auspices. He had' been received as&#xD;
an agreeable visitor at the house of Mrs. Fairfield; thus&#xD;
his acquaintance with the family had almost ripened&#xD;
into 'intimacy. He was one of - those prudent young&#xD;
men whose good sense never permitted him to enter&#xD;
into extravagances of speech. He hadbeen a close&#xD;
student, and had not only read the ivorks of the best&#xD;
authors, but had' studied them carefully. Upon this&#xD;
account, he 'was a very pleasant companion for Mr.&#xD;
Rockford. They spent several hours of each day in&#xD;
conversation upon polite literature. They were partic-&#xD;
ularly fond of poetry, especially the works of the au-&#xD;
thors of the old school'. It was a pleasant task for&#xD;
them'to take the works of Pope, and select portions&#xD;
from his best essays and translations. Each line was&#xD;
suggestive of thought, and lengthy disputations would&#xD;
spring up between the friends, which could only be set-&#xD;
tled by an agreement upon the next beautiful passage.&#xD;
Mr. Judson was a young man of a gay temperament.&#xD;
He'seemed to live only for the enjoyment of the pres-&#xD;
.ent. He amused Miss Frances Fairfield and Mrs.&#xD;
Rockford by a rehearsal of his college scrapes. To&#xD;
have heard him converse, one would have supposed that&#xD;
the four years 'he spent at the University were. not well&#xD;
improved, but he had managed to pick up a- smattering&#xD;
of the languages. - He had merely scracped'through a&#xD;
graduation. He was the life of the party, and never&#xD;
let time hang heavy if he' could procure an audience.&#xD;

If he could amuse! himself in no other ways he would&#xD;
take Jupe and Carlo and amuse Sebastian. The child&#xD;
loved him dearly, and insisted iapon a frequent rehear-&#xD;
sal of the feats he had taught the pets to perform. - He&#xD;
would clap his little hands and jump for joy when Car-&#xD;
lo would leap over the bars, or find a handkerchief,&#xD;
hidden by Mr. Judson.&#xD;
The guests had been at Rockford house several days.&#xD;
and yet their host would not consent for them to depart.&#xD;
Time had not passed so pleasantly with him in a -long&#xD;
time. He exacted a promise fronthem that they would&#xD;
spend two more weeks at his house. He desired to give&#xD;
them a grand party, and invite the citizens of the town&#xD;
to it. He was fond of merriment himself, and nothing&#xD;
delighted him so much as to see his friends enjoy his&#xD;
hospitalities.&#xD;
Aunt Margery spent the most of her time in the so-&#xD;
ciety of Mrs. -Rockford, whose company she esteemed&#xD;
very greatly. The good old lady was fond of impai-ting&#xD;
what lessons she had early learned upon house-keeping,&#xD;
the art of cookery, and the all-irmportant one of quilt..&#xD;
making, to all young folks. She had seen the folly of&#xD;
throwing away scraps which might just as well form the&#xD;
squares of a quilt. It would be well for us if we had&#xD;
many such good soulas she was. She was not -stupid&#xD;
or awkward in company, but preferred the society of a&#xD;
few to mingling with the gay throngs, whose only object&#xD;
appeared to her to be a grand display 'of fine dress.&#xD;
She thought folks had better learn to copy Nature more,&#xD;
and trust less to art;. But aunt Margery was. too pru-&#xD;
&#xD;
R O K FORD.6&#xD;
dent to restrict her daughters in their harmless enjoy-.&#xD;
.ments.&#xD;
What a happy thing it was for Mrs. Rockford that&#xD;
she had the as istance of aunt Margery! When her&#xD;
husband proposed the party, she interposed not the least&#xD;
objection, but readily gave her consent. Her larders&#xD;
were well supplied with every ingredient) she desired.&#xD;
Her cooks were well trained, and she was no novice in&#xD;
the culinary art. Aunt Margery could give her much&#xD;
odcounsel; and upon the following day she com-&#xD;
menced making extensive preparations for the festival.&#xD;
Hcr husband had told her to spare no expense, but to fit&#xD;
up a sumptuous supper for a great number of guests.&#xD;
It was soon known in Crofton that a grand party was&#xD;
to be given by Mr. Rockford in honor of Mrs. Fairfield&#xD;
and her daughters. They had received the attentions&#xD;
of the visiting portion of the ladies and the young men.&#xD;
Those who expected tickets to the party commenced&#xD;
making preparations to attend. Mr.'Snibbens brushed&#xD;
up his seedy coat, had it pressed and repaired, and&#xD;
commenced looking out some big words and phrases to&#xD;
use upon the occasion.&#xD;
While the party is the common gossip of the town,&#xD;
and the ladies of Rockford house are making extensive&#xD;
preparations for the occason, let s relate other things&#xD;
which may be of. interest. to the reader.. It has been&#xD;
intimated that a band of robbers was supposed to have&#xD;
one of their retreats, near the town of Crofton. The&#xD;
attack which had been made upon the fishermen by men&#xD;
who seemed to he intimate with the coast, and the fact&#xD;

borhood of the jail, gave strength to ,the suspicions&#xD;
thatiRoyston had friends and accomplices. in a set of&#xD;
maraders wh9 place all law and order at defiance. It&#xD;
was not at all improbable; neither had the-character of&#xD;
that- desperate iman been above reproach for along time.&#xD;
It 'as a mysterf to his former friends and companions&#xD;
how he managed to pay his bills. They supposed; that&#xD;
hi had resorted.to the gaming-table. His most intimate&#xD;
acquaintances were: not generally known in the town,&#xD;
nor did they apear as if desirous'of pushing themselves&#xD;
into society, so.little were they suited for the company&#xD;
of the refined.&#xD;
Crofton was built, as to the business portion of it,&#xD;
around the Court square.  The stores of; all descrip-&#xD;
tions were situated at intervals, and, with the hotels and&#xD;
nd other  buildings, filled up the entire sp ce."The&#xD;
i churches anti academies were located upon emiiences in,&#xD;
Convenient parts of. the toyn  while the residencesof&#xD;
the inhabitants were rangedupon'the different, streets,&#xD;
as suited the convenience of' the citizen. The principal&#xD;
street led to the wharf, rhere} were located: the exton-.&#xD;
sive warehouses. Orofton, though not large enough to&#xD;
recalled a city;was a place that co~i ained nearly two&#xD;
thousand inhabitants#though it was a small place in&#xD;
comparison to some cities upon the coast.&#xD;
Jewellers, drutgists, dentists pnd painters occupied&#xD;

ing sign might be mead the name of "Hans Kemple,&#xD;
Jeweller." In order to discover the exact locality of&#xD;
the veritable Hans, the sign further described the part&#xD;
of the house he was supposed to occupy, "Third floor,&#xD;
second room to the right."  When you arrived at the- ,&#xD;
gallery of the second floor, numerous signs greeted you.&#xD;
" Miss Jerusha Smith, Milliner." 7"J. Sinclair Peebles,&#xD;
Attorney at Law."  "G. iHigginbotham Compton, Den..&#xD;
twist " "Crofton Courier," and other offices. After&#xD;
passing up the second flight of steps, the.attention of&#xD;
the stranger was only directed to the small sign of Hans.&#xD;
The other apartments were private, or not occupied&#xD;
at all.&#xD;
At a given signal from without, Hans went cautiously&#xD;
to the doorgand having satisfied himself that a friend&#xD;
sought admittance, .he opened the door without hesita-&#xD;
tion.&#xD;
"Ah! Heinrich, is it you?" said Hans. "I am&#xD;
overjoyed to see you. How is o r scheme progressing?&#xD;
When were you at the retreat ?"&#xD;
"Do not talk-so loudly," replied ieinrich. "Walls&#xD;

are watched of late.&#xD;
"Then dome into. my little baksroo   aid nsai a&#xD;

Hans led Heinrich through his tolerably well filled&#xD;
room into the small apartment indicated. The door&#xD;
was bolted, and they commencedbtalking eag atly.&#xD;

his execution. It will never do in the worlTfor so noble&#xD;
a soul as he is to suffer s'o humiliating a death: He has&#xD;
been true and valiant, and right nobly has he divided.&#xD;
the poils with us. He has been foremost in every at-&#xD;
tack, the first to strike, and the last to quit th' field.&#xD;
When we have been forced to abandon an enterprise, he&#xD;
has covered our retreat, and defied all the united force&#xD;
of his assailants."&#xD;
"You speaktruly, Hans," said his companion. "Thus&#xD;
far he has borne his confinement and trial with heroic&#xD;
fortitude; but death is a dreadful thing. Do you sup-&#xD;
pose he4 would ascend the scaffold,- and take the awful&#xD;
leap into eternity, with all the crimes that hang upon&#xD;
his soul, and not make a confession? You arrive at&#xD;
different conclusions from what I do, if yiu think your-&#xD;
self safe. He knows that it isin our power to release&#xD;
him from confinement, and he expects it at our hands."&#xD;
"See what I have been doing for the past few days,"&#xD;
id Hans. "Here is a finely tempered- saw, which I&#xD;
hive made. This must be conveyed to him as soon as&#xD;
ossile. With this he can sever the manacles that&#xD;
bind him, and cut his way out of confinement in a 'few&#xD;
hours."&#xD;
The companion of Hans informed him that he had&#xD;
been upon a visit to heir friends, and they were doubly&#xD;
enlisted in the cause of Carl Royston. If he should&#xD;
not be enabled tosnake his escape within a few days, it&#xD;
was theigtitention to brave all, and risk Their lives in&#xD;

ment he had made in his own hands. The jailer had&#xD;
called upon him only a few days before to have an article&#xD;
of jewelry repaired, and he would walk out in that di-&#xD;
rection and drop in .and see him.&#xD;
When Heinrich had taken his departure, Hans en-&#xD;
closed the saw, which was very small, in a paper, took&#xD;
several late newspapers and put them in his pocket.&#xD;
He directed his footsteps towards the common, upon&#xD;
which the jail was located. He was in the act of pass-&#xD;
ing the prison, when the jailor, who was at work in the,&#xD;
garden, hailed him, and invited him to call in. Hans&#xD;
tried-to excuse himself, but the jailor urged.him so that&#xD;
:he consented to tarry only. a few minutes. The jailor&#xD;
was a communicative man. He could never rest until&#xD;
he had divested himself of every secret he was in pos-&#xD;
session of. Yet he was a faithful man, who might have&#xD;
been entrusted' with the. greatest treasure. He was&#xD;
prepared to defend the jail and environs with his life.&#xD;
The jailor invited Hans to join, him in a glass, at the&#xD;
same time. opening the door of a closet. Hans consent-&#xD;
ed, of course, and..soon the friends were discussing" upon&#xD;
various subjects. The conversation at length turned&#xD;
upon Royston, whom Hans pictured out as being one of&#xD;
the most abandoned men he had ever seen. The drinks&#xD;
were repeated, and the jailor was in a fair way of be-&#xD;
coming intoxicated. Hans recollected that he had the&#xD;
piece of jewelry, which he had- repaired for the jailor in&#xD;
his pocket. When. he offered it to him, he could not be&#xD;
prevailed upon to receive any compensation for his work.&#xD;
Hans expressed a'desire to see the prisoner, saying that,&#xD;

&#xD;
as he would not be in town upon the day of the execu-&#xD;
tion, he had a curiosity to see the wretch .once more.&#xD;
The jailor consented, and led 'the way to -his place of&#xD;
confinement. The massive bolts and locks yielded to&#xD;
the key and the pressure of the strong hand .of the&#xD;
jailor, and they were soon in the presence of Carl&#xD;
Royston.. The prisoner Was a man above the medium&#xD;
size, andseemed formed for feats of strength and agil-&#xD;
ity;..He could not have been'exceeding thirty-years-of&#xD;
age, from the appearance of his face. A heavy beard,&#xD;
almost jet black,. corresponded with his long, flowing&#xD;
ringlets. There were few finer looking men than Roys-&#xD;
ton. The prisoner merely bowed to Hans, as the latter,&#xD;
accompanied by' the jailor, entered the room. Royston&#xD;
was seated at a table, reading a book. Several papers&#xD;
were scattered upon the table. Hans observed that&#xD;
Royston was confined.,by a chain, which was fastened&#xD;
to one of his ankles. The chain was secured by a staple&#xD;
driven into the floor near his bed.&#xD;
Hans conversed with' the prisoner upon trivial matters&#xD;
for some time, without alluding to the murder. Roys-&#xD;
ton asked the jailor to furnish him with a supply of&#xD;
fresh water. While the latter was gone to get it, Hans&#xD;
hastily drew out the saw and a ball of twine, and gave&#xD;
them to Royston. Ne said that, upon the night previ-&#xD;
ous to 'the day appointed for the execution, his escape&#xD;
must be made. The plan was imparted to Royston in&#xD;
a few words. The- friends embraced and were silent,&#xD;
as they heard the footsteps of the jailor.&#xD;
Hans took his departure from the jail, well pleased&#xD;
&#xD;
ROCKFORD.&#xD;
with the success' of his visit. The hopes of. Royston&#xD;
were revived. He began his work of sawing the bars&#xD;
of the window, which was happily within his reach. He&#xD;
worked slowlyat first, and succeeded so well that the&#xD;
bars were sawn sufficiently,.in one night, to render them&#xD;
capable of being wrenched off. The window had a&#xD;
curtain, which the prisoner wisely drew over the aper-&#xD;
ture to conceal his designs. The jailor had heard no&#xD;
noise, and not suspecting an attempt on the part of&#xD;
the prisoner to make his escape, merely performed the&#xD;
usual task of furnishing Royston -with his meals. Roys-&#xD;
ton concealed the saw in his bosom, resolving to part&#xD;
with it only with his life.&#xD;
When the jailor had performed his round, upon the&#xD;
evening preceding the day set apart for the execution,&#xD;
Royston commenced the task of sawing in twain the&#xD;
iron that encumbered him. He labored long and dili-&#xD;
gently, and succeeded in severing it just at midnight.&#xD;
He went to the window, and listened for the signal.&#xD;
All was still and quiet. There was no noise in or about&#xD;
the prison. His fate was in the balances, and the&#xD;
weight of a feather would turnsthe scale. It seemed&#xD;
almost an age to him when the clock tolled the hour of&#xD;
one. Just then he heard a low whistle from the copse&#xD;
hard by the jail-yard. He retui Ad the-signal cautious-&#xD;
ly, and applied his hands to the bars, which yielded to&#xD;
his pressure. One by one they were removed. Fasten-&#xD;
ing the twine to one end of the saw, Royston threw it&#xD;
with all his might over the enclosure of the jail. In a&#xD;
fewinutes another signal was given, and he drew back&#xD;

the twine and joyfully clasped the end of a rope in his&#xD;
hands. It was only the work of a few minutes to make&#xD;
the cable fast to the bedstead, and swing himself from&#xD;
the dizzy height to the ground. Holding fast to the&#xD;
rope,, which had a fastening fiom 'without, Royston&#xD;
climbed over the high wall. He was free !&#xD;

CHAPTER        VIII.&#xD;
WE are taught from experience, that many of the ills&#xD;
of life-result from disappointment. When once.we have&#xD;
placed our affections upon an object, its attainment forms&#xD;
our chief desire for the present moment.. It matters&#xD;
but little how trivial is the object of our desires, the&#xD;
mind is not the less bent upon its pursuit. A  country&#xD;
damsel, once upon a time, performed a journey of ten&#xD;
miles, on foot, to witness an execution; but the culprit&#xD;
was reprieved by the Governor wlile the Sheriff was in&#xD;
the act of adjusting the noose. Tae disappointed crowd&#xD;
left the place filled with regret, and the damsel sought&#xD;
her far-off home, bewailing her unhappy lot -complain-&#xD;
ing that Fate had decreed that she should never enjoy&#xD;
any of the pleasures of life!&#xD;
If the execution of criminals were attended by the&#xD;
thoughtless thousands who witness them, with other ob-&#xD;
jects than those of gratifying an idle curiosity, and of&#xD;
seeing the culprit enact the last scene of the drama of&#xD;
life, the effect upon the by-standers would be different&#xD;
from what it really is. The public execution of crimi-&#xD;
nals was intended by our legislators, who enacted the&#xD;
law, to act as a warning to the people, who are never&#xD;
backward in crowding around the scaffold to catch the&#xD;
last confession of the victim of the law. Men, whose&#xD;

skirts were red with the blood of innocent victims, and&#xD;
whose hearts were black with crime, upon surveying the&#xD;
sympathizing crowd around them, have imagined them-&#xD;
selves martyrs, and have died amid seeming exultations.&#xD;
The increase of crime has, in a measure, resulted from&#xD;
those Nappy exits upon the part of fiends ; and many&#xD;
nations have substituted private for public executions.&#xD;
The town of Crofton was thrown into a state of utter&#xD;
confusion on the morning after the escape of Royston..&#xD;
Five thousand persons from neighboring places were in&#xD;
and around Crofton, to witness the anticipated hanging.&#xD;
The hotels were.croiwded, the private houses were over-&#xD;
flowing with visitors, and the woods were fullHof men,&#xD;
women and children, who had pitched their tents the&#xD;
evening before. The jailor was almost frantic when he&#xD;
discovered that the bird had flown. He could not gon-&#xD;
ceive how the instrument had been conveyed to the&#xD;
prisoner.. Suspicion could not rest upon Hans more&#xD;
than upon'other men who had been admitted to Roys-&#xD;
ton's cell. Besides, Hans was considered to be a man&#xD;
of irreproachable character. The more ignorant por-&#xD;
tion of the community imagined that Royston's escape&#xD;
had been effected by super-natural agency. They did&#xD;
not doubt but that Royston was in close league with the&#xD;
adversary of souls. The 'editor of the town 'paper has-&#xD;
tened to his .sanctum, locked his door to keep out intru-&#xD;
ders, seated himself by his desk, took out a fresh supply&#xD;
of paper; provided himself with a new pen, shook the&#xD;
ink, roaches back his hair, crossed his legs, knit his&#xD;
brows, lenhed his' teeth, and wrote-the following edi-&#xD;
torial notice':&#xD;
&#xD;
MIRACULOUS ESCAPE !&#xD;
CAPTIVUS FUGIVIT!&#xD;
UNPARALLELED EXCITEMENT!&#xD;
MYSTERY CONNECTED WITH IT!&#xD;
"Last night, when the silvery orb had disappeared&#xD;
behind the horizon, and the roseate scintillations emit-&#xD;
ted from the stellated firmament alone guided mortals&#xD;
upon their nocturnal pereginations, by some mysterious&#xD;
agency of supernal hand craft, a convicted miscreant,&#xD;
whose life had been forfeited to the law by disinterested&#xD;
and far-seeing jurors, effected his escape from durance&#xD;
vile. [Here the' editor had recourse'to his dictionary of&#xD;
quotations.] Ensconced, as he was, by the unyielding&#xD;
walls of the conciergerie, [Here the editor took snuff]&#xD;
manacled with a brazen chain with frequent links, guard-&#xD;
ed by day 'neath the dragon eye of the ever wakeful jail-&#xD;
or, and by night [tempore noctis] by the iron doors which&#xD;
grate upon the brazen thresholds,. how was it possible&#xD;
for the prisoner to have made his escape? [Here the&#xD;
editor coughed three times, took snuff again, and spent&#xD;
one hour in searching Pope's translation of the Illiad&#xD;
for a suitable quotation.]&#xD;
Now pleasing sleep hath closed each mortal eye,&#xD;
Stretched in their tents, the Grecian leaders lie,&#xD;
The immortals slumbered on their thrones above,&#xD;
All but the ever-wakeful eyes of Jove.'&#xD;
"Who would have supposed it within the power of one&#xD;
so helpless as Royston -just upon the eve of beholding,&#xD;
experiencing and feeling the dread realities of the un-&#xD;
known Future--to effect his escape from-his keep, guard-&#xD;

hour in searching the pagesof Shakspeare.]&#xD;
iAy, bt to die, and go, we knownot where;&#xD;
TQ lie in cold obstruction, and to rot;'&#xD;
Royston thought this, perhaps, and assisted by some&#xD;
elf, wrenched the mighty fabric of the windows from&#xD;
their strong position in the walls, and summoning all the&#xD;
courage his naturally brave, but drepraved'heart pos-&#xD;
essed, he swung down the cord, by fairies wrought,&#xD;
cleared the court-yard below, and vanished into thin air.&#xD;
"So great is the unparalleled excitement of the infu-&#xD;
riated crowd, that anarchy reigns without. 'Saevitque&#xD;
animis ignobile vulgus.' It is apprehended, upon the&#xD;
part of our sooth-sayers, that 'Jamque fasces et saxa&#xD;
volant.' If such a dire calamity should happen, as a&#xD;
natural consequence, we. canp only expect that 'furor&#xD;
arma ministrat.' But we shall n t despair.  'Nil des-&#xD;
erandum.'&#xD;
"By the time we go to press again, we hope and fondly&#xD;
trust that the mystery may be cleared up. We should&#xD;
not be too 'hasty in censuring our vei'y excellent and&#xD;
highly competent jailor for the escape of Carl Royston.&#xD;
More anon. Nous, verons."&#xD;
The erudite editor unbolted the door of the sanctum,&#xD;
placed the article in tie hands of the compositor, bade&#xD;
him use all possible dispatch, and give him a proof of&#xD;
it very soon.&#xD;
When the paper made its appearance, the -sensible&#xD;

appropriate classical quotations. It is more than prob-&#xD;
able that it saved much disturbance, as the editor him-&#xD;
self thought, as the crowd dispersed, no lives were lost,&#xD;
no blood shed, and the ,jailor was unmolested.  What&#xD;
a powerful engine is the Press !&#xD;
The miraculous escape of Royston was the constant&#xD;
theme of conversation for several days. At .length the&#xD;
argument was exhausted, and other topics supplied the&#xD;
vacuum. The whole town was in a bustle about the ap-&#xD;
proacliing party at Rockford house. The merchants&#xD;
were reaping a rich harvest, indeed, .from the sale of&#xD;
fancy goods. Blessed are those who dwell in towns,&#xD;
where the bustle and confusion of a crowded and hurried&#xD;
populace do not deaden the genial vitality that should&#xD;
pervade society. We should live in vain, if we did not&#xD;
cultivate and refine the better feelings- of our nature.&#xD;
If only the morbid desire of acquiring wealth, and of&#xD;
elevating ourselves to a superior position in'society were&#xD;
the mainspring to our exertions, the world, instead of&#xD;
being advanced in civilization, would cease to reflect the&#xD;
light of science, and the reign of. the Dark Ages would&#xD;
overshadow mankind again.&#xD;
By frequent repetition we- are enabled to learn the&#xD;
most difficult-languages, and to demonstrate the most&#xD;
intricate propositions. By frequent contact with our&#xD;
associates we are enabled to polish our manners, and&#xD;
prepare our minds for the. enjoyment of that blessed&#xD;
existence which is promised to the faithful. The rough&#xD;

Ashlar is divested of its asperities by the art of me-&#xD;
chanism, and prepared for the adornment of costly&#xD;
palaces. The golden stream of education, when, left&#xD;
free to flow through ourrmidst, waters and revivifies every&#xD;
plant in the garden of our hearts. The mind must be&#xD;
concentrated upon a subject before the reasoning.facul--&#xD;
ties can rise superior to mere matter. It is by a strict&#xD;
regard to Truth, which is the touch-stone of every vir-&#xD;
tue, that society is held together-that governments&#xD;
flourish-and the heavenly bodies move in their accus-&#xD;
tomed sphere. Truth, like pure gold, becomes more&#xD;
refined by being polished ;' and the mind 'is expanded&#xD;
and strengthened by the force of education.'&#xD;
Housewives would forget the use of their utensils, if&#xD;
they were not, at times, permitted to bring them into&#xD;
requisition upon extra occasions. By the advice of&#xD;
aunt Margery, Mrs. Rockford ordered a complete mus-&#xD;
ter of every culinary utensil upon the premises. Thy&#xD;
pots, ovens, spiders, skillets and baking-pans were all&#xD;
brought face to face, to give account of their steward-&#xD;
ship. Mr. Rockford smiled to see his aunt examining&#xD;
the quality of every piece of ware with the care of a&#xD;
purchaser. After condemning about one-half the lot&#xD;
as unfit for service, the good dame made out a list for&#xD;
new articles, which were presently bought arid brought&#xD;
into.immediate requisition. All was bustle and merry&#xD;
confusion at Rockfo-d house now.  Turkeys ,were cha-&#xD;
sed down, and sacrificed; chickens suffered decapitation;&#xD;
pigs were slaughtered; and the fish market .patronized.&#xD;

men lent a helping hand. Mr. Rockford pulled off his&#xD;
coat, laid Coke and Littleton upon the shelf, tied up his&#xD;
office papers securely, and followed the workers into the&#xD;
pastry rooms. He was soon banished from there by&#xD;
the edict of aunt Margery, for he had forgotten himself&#xD;
and upset the sugar bowls, mixed the white of the eggs&#xD;
with the yellow, -and. spoiled fully a dozen of those in-&#xD;
dispensible and ephemeral productions of the barn-yard.&#xD;
He had mixed the sugar and flour without waiting for&#xD;
commands, and must suffer banishment.&#xD;
Judging that the house was almost too hot a place for&#xD;
him, he hastened to the yard to assist Adam and dame&#xD;
Phillis in roasting the meats, but he soon discovered&#xD;
that his presence was not required there. He attempted&#xD;
to turn one of the spits, and let a choice joint of meat&#xD;
fall into the fire.&#xD;
"Dar now," said Phillis; "massa done gone spile de&#xD;
meat. I 'speck he done sumthin' 'rong in de hous, and&#xD;
missis run him out dar. Do pray, massa, go 'long to&#xD;
de Law offis, and leave de niggers 'lone. Dey can cook&#xD;
de meat better'n you."&#xD;
Mr. Rockford went to the house, and vowed he would&#xD;
not again interfere with the arrangements of the party.&#xD;
He procured a list of the guests to be invited, and sent&#xD;
out the cards. In the meantime, the young men, who&#xD;
were more docile, aided the ladies in their work, and&#xD;
were of incalculable advantage to them. The domestic&#xD;
apartments were redolent with the odor of pound-cake..&#xD;
Every sunshiny place about the yard was. put into re-&#xD;
quisition for drying the iced cake. Sebastian and Jupe&#xD;

were closely guarded to keep them from mischief. Carlo&#xD;
was the best custodian of the knick-knacks. The pigs&#xD;
and feathered tribe, which had not been drafted, were&#xD;
kept at bay by that, faithful animal. He would stretch&#xD;
himself out, as if asleep, by the tables, and watch the&#xD;
chickens as they would step lightly upon tip-toe to per-&#xD;
petrate mischief. When they were upon the point of&#xD;
committing the overt act, Carlo would make an imme-&#xD;
diate sally upon them. He kept his watch faithfully,&#xD;
and suffered no harm to come to the tables.&#xD;
So expeditiously had the work been carried on under&#xD;
th e superintendence of aunt Margery, that everything&#xD;
was cooked fully two days before the time appointed for&#xD;
the party. She had taught Mrs. Rockford some lessons&#xD;
in the art of cookery she had never known before. The&#xD;
young men had labored as faithfully as any of the ca-&#xD;
terers. ,Mr. Rockford was not allowed to go near the&#xD;
pantries, for fear he might upset something. Every'&#xD;
apartment' about the house was cleansed and put in&#xD;
complete order for the reception of the guests. When&#xD;
the day for the party arrived, the gentlemen took&#xD;
guns, and went upon the beach to shoot gulls and ducks.&#xD;
Aunt Margery sat down to crimp the border of her new&#xD;
cap. Mrs. Rockford was busy in performing a thou-&#xD;
sand useless things, but anything to keep the 'mind&#xD;
employed is' better than to sit down and do nothing.&#xD;
Miss Frances took Sebastian and Jupe, and went to&#xD;
play. Carlo kept guard at the entrance of the dining-&#xD;
room. The numerous cais and pigeons about the prem-&#xD;
ises were not too good to displace many .a thing and&#xD;

literary caste, sat down to write a letter to one of her&#xD;
female friends in Colonna. As we have the liberty, let&#xD;
us look over her shoulder while she writes. It is said&#xD;
that time discovers all things; let us rather take it by&#xD;
the fore-lock in. this instance.&#xD;
But, gentle reader, do not imagine that you are doing&#xD;
a very praise-worthy action in prying into the secrets of&#xD;
others. If you can keep your own, it is well; but it is&#xD;
almost impossible for you to keep those of your friends.&#xD;
There are really but few secrets kept. You may trace&#xD;
out, by enquiry, a solution almost to everything. But&#xD;
let us give everything its due. There is a society ex-&#xD;
isting among us which has kept secrets from time imme-&#xD;
morial. * The very actions of Solomon and his wise men&#xD;
are known to that society, and even to its neophytes.&#xD;
Who will say that mankind is unfaithful, when MASON-&#xD;
RY has withstood the ravages of time?  But, by Miss&#xD;
Roxana's leave, we will look over her shoulder as she&#xD;
writes. it may throw some light upon our novel.&#xD;

tiful morning,-which bids fair to be the happiest day of&#xD;
my life, I am seated in my well furnished apartment,&#xD;
writing, to you; my dear Helen, who hav6 shared my&#xD;
bliss and divided my sorrows from our early childhood.&#xD;
The window of my apartment commands a fine view of&#xD;
the Atlantic, and I can distinctly see the briny billows&#xD;
as they chase 'each other to the beach. Mr. Rockford&#xD;

upon the beach, waging war upon the gulls and ducks.&#xD;
The report of their fowling-pieces is distinctly heard&#xD;

how we were amused at the exhibitions .of a magician,&#xD;
who came to Colonna several years ago ; and with what&#xD;
rapidity he changed and varied his performances? How&#xD;
we clapped our hands and laughed, and were.almost dizzy&#xD;

tern? It is true they were simple enough, and could&#xD;

"Do not suppose, dearest, that I wish to cast- any&#xD;
aspersions upon the fame .of our town.. Far from it ;,&#xD;
but ,I longed to beholdd other scenes, and I left my home&#xD;
with a joyful heart- We were soon out of Colonna,&#xD;
and were passing through a beautiful country. The&#xD;
high, saridy ridges were densely covered with the tall,&#xD;
stately pines. As I leaned my head out of the window&#xD;
of the carriage, and listened to the mournful sighing of&#xD;
those Leviathans of the forest, I became almost sad;&#xD;
but then they are crowned with foliage all- the year&#xD;
round, and look so beautiful, especially in the Spring,&#xD;
when they put on. a new, dress.' Their tasselated leaves&#xD;
do not wither, but at the appointed time they are forced&#xD;
to give place to the younger shoot.&#xD;
" You have no idea, dearest Helen, how many beau-&#xD;
tiful streams we crossed. We could see the fish playing&#xD;
upon the pebbly beds., 'When we -ould get. out at such&#xD;
places to rest the horse we would cast, pebbles at- the&#xD;
fish. They would dart off under their retreat at the&#xD;
bank,' but when we threw themsome.crumbs, they would&#xD;
come very near' us.. One large trout  eame to. the sur-&#xD;
face to get a chicken bone which Fannie threw into the&#xD;
stream, when Mr. Judson, who is never better employed&#xD;
than when engaged in sport, gave him so severe a blow-&#xD;
with"the big end of his whip, that. the scaly victim was&#xD;
killed outright.        -&#xD;
"We passed many fine residences. I was surprised&#xD;
to see so much magnificence displayed in the country.&#xD;
* Those who reside in such lovely retreats, with .every&#xD;
convenience around them, should never despair of en-&#xD;
&#xD;
joyment. If I could-exchange my residence in Colonna&#xD;
for a retreat, like some I saw when I came to this place,&#xD;
I could spend my life ,so pleasantly..&#xD;
"By eleven o'clock in the morning, we arrived at Mr.&#xD;
Rockford's stately mansion, having left Colonna at sun-&#xD;
rise. We were scarcely six hours upon the road, though&#xD;
our .speed had not been great. But you know how very&#xD;
careful mother is of her horses. She would not travel&#xD;
more than four miles an hour to gratify us or any per-&#xD;
son else. Mr. Roekford came and welcomed us wjth&#xD;
such a becoming grace, and his wife has been so agree-&#xD;
able, that I shall be soiry when the time comes for us to&#xD;
return to Colon~na.&#xD;
"We' have had delightful drives about the town, and&#xD;
pleasant excursions in the sail-boats. Numerous friends&#xD;
have called to see us, and we have repaid their visits.&#xD;
I wish you could see Sebastian Rockford! lHe is one of&#xD;
the prettiest boys I have ever beheld. He is truly and&#xD;
wonderfully intelligent. :His parents love him so fondly&#xD;
that I am afraid something will happen "to the child.&#xD;
But what a oolish saying that is, Helen, as if the love&#xD;
one bears to a child should not rather be a protection&#xD;

&#xD;
CH APPER IX.&#xD;
When Mr. Rockford and his "two' friends had filled&#xD;
their game-bags with as many birds as they chose to&#xD;
carey'they directed their steps homeward, well pleased&#xD;
with the morning's sport. There are many birds to be&#xD;
found upon the sea-shore which can be scarcely ranked&#xD;
among the aquatic tribe. They not unfrequently wage&#xD;
war with the Grallatores, which, after wadinginto the&#xD;
water and capturing their prey, are ruthlessly deprived&#xD;
of -the'p:roceeds of their labor. The Snipe, the smallest&#xD;
species of the Grallatores, is a timid and cautious bird.&#xD;
The slightest motion of 'the hunter Will cause it to seek&#xD;
safetyit flight. Some bird-hunters suppose that the&#xD;
oldfbit and steel lock guns are. not quick enough in&#xD;
explo ing to kill them. Be that as it,'may, they are not&#xD;
easily bagged. The Partridge, of the'order Gallinw:,&#xD;
family Tetraonido, are generally found in low countries.&#xD;
They resemble our barn-yard fowl, are war-likein their&#xD;
disposition, attacking. any animal, which may disturb&#xD;
their young. They are generally shot upon the wing&#xD;
by sportsmen, who train their pointers to the task of&#xD;
flushing them. They go in flocks, and,, except in the&#xD;
laying season, when they are only foundin pairs, fifty&#xD;
or' sixty may be seen in one flok. They are fond of&#xD;
grain;'but, like other birds,.are. equally satisfied with&#xD;

insects. Their flesh is sweet and wholesome, and he is&#xD;
no Epicure who refuses a 'roasted Partridge.&#xD;
The bags of the huntsmen were filled with Ducks and&#xD;
Partridges, with -a few Wood-oks d Snipes.&#xD;
'4Here' are some deliacies, Josephine," said Mr.&#xD;
Rockford. "Have a few of the choice birds served up&#xD;
for dinner."&#xD;
'' Your success' has been commensurate with-your de-&#xD;
sires, one would think, from the great number o the&#xD;
feathered tribe you have slain," said ' Miss Roxana to&#xD;
Mr. Watson.&#xD;
"Indeed, madain," replied the.gallant, "'we have not&#xD;
sported this morning to no Kpurpose. I have scarcely&#xD;
ever seen birds more plentiful. We tookour nations,&#xD;
hidden from view by the copse, and when a Du4k would&#xD;
light near us, Mr. Rockford would .request one of us to&#xD;
shoot it, and enjoin upon the other to be ready to fire&#xD;
upon the birds on shore, which, of a suiety, were 'on-&#xD;
cealed all around us in clusters."a-&#xD;
Here an interesting lecture upon the subject of orni-&#xD;
thology, by Mr.,Rockford, occupied the time' that inter-&#xD;
vned 'until the dinner hour. When that meal had been&#xD;
duly discussed, the friends sepai-ated, to meet no more&#xD;
until the arrival of the guests for the party.&#xD;
At the usual hour for fashionable gatherings to con-&#xD;
vene, the extensive parlord and reception rooms were&#xD;
crowded with the numerous guests. Every one in the&#xD;
town, who ,made an pretensions to gentility, was invi-&#xD;
ted. If any deserving persons had been neglected, it&#xD;
was not the fault of the Rockfords. The fashionable;&#xD;

the gay and the grave were represented.   The aged&#xD;
attended their children,'to see them duly initiated into.&#xD;
the mysteries of fashionable society., The belles of the&#xD;
own were dresses     the finest silks, satins and em-&#xD;
broidered nuslins". Those maidens; to whom Nature&#xD;
had not beeii so'lavish of its charms, supplied the de-&#xD;
fects by the bea tiful colors of 'the toilet-box.&#xD;
When Josephus Napoleon Bonaparte Snibbens con-&#xD;
ducte4 Miss Jerusha Smith into the parlor, nothing but&#xD;
god feeding prevented an outburst of laughter.  The&#xD;
appearance of' this strange couple was anything but&#xD;
prepossessing. Miss *erusha was very stately, being&#xD;
several inches taller in person than her pedantic escort.&#xD;
The superfluity of bows, flounces and lacesof her dress,&#xD;
did not fail to attract the attention of those, even, who&#xD;
were notconnoisseurs in the art of haberdashery. Like&#xD;
some ,jewellers, who seek to make a display by wearing&#xD;
numberless rings and pins, Miss Jerusha, who was a&#xD;
niilliner, hod surely made herself, upon that occasion,&#xD;
a locomotive sign post for they display of 'her goods.&#xD;
Mr Snibbens had been studying the costume, as well as&#xD;
the attitude of the first Napoleon. Buff pants, a vest&#xD;
4fdthe same material, and4 a blue frock coat, cut in the&#xD;
try military style, mud fastened in front, with military&#xD;

coporalp   Snibbens seated his charge, and commenced&#xD;
discoursing his acquaintances upon abstruse sciences&#xD;
generally;.&#xD;
a ersation sOen became general and the modest&#xD;
reserve that naturally restrains the guests when they&#xD;

uel Ctiverhouse and his ancient spouse were there, pre-&#xD;
pared to listen to the conversation of the guests of&#xD;
their own age, and to collect all the little news-items&#xD;
that were afloat in the town. Samuel and Dorothy were&#xD;
an amiable, but homely couple. As a certain wag has&#xD;
facetiously said, those two made a pai. Samuel's blue&#xD;
domestic suit, which had only been worn .seventeen&#xD;
years, appeared to rather, better advantage upon that&#xD;
occasion than usual, thanks to the renovating ordeal&#xD;
that all household goods were subjected to by the excel-&#xD;
lent Dorothy. She never permitted anything to go' to&#xD;
waste about her ; far from it. She had taken off the&#xD;
fourteen yard border of her antique cap, washed it in&#xD;
milk-warm water with a little weak soap, carried it&#xD;
through a course of mysteries, quilled it up, as she had&#xD;
done an hundred times before,,and sewed it back again.&#xD;
Her silver spectacles, with the large circular glasses&#xD;
never became her better than they did on the night of&#xD;
the party. She held in her hand a large ttarkey-tail&#xD;
fan, bound' with blue morocco. The good old couple&#xD;
said but few words, but they we-? busily compiling in-&#xD;
formation to be used on future occasions, perhaps at the&#xD;
breakfast table on the next morning.&#xD;
The Misses Fairfield were arrayed in costly but pfain&#xD;
'dresses, and received an abundance of- attention from&#xD;
the young gentlemen. Their good sense' and fine ac=&#xD;
complishments fitted them for the adornment of the&#xD;
most polite and elegant circles in which they had been&#xD;
accustomed to move. The grace with which they re-&#xD;

ceived the addresses of their friends, might be attributed&#xD;
to the  excellent training they had received from their&#xD;
parents.  One of the young men,: who' vas conversing&#xD;
with. Miss. Roxanaescorted her to the piano. -While&#xD;
the company:was. entertained by the music, several in-&#xD;
teresting.scenes were being enacted in' the room.. An&#xD;
old'gentleman, wo was noted for his' wealth, had two&#xD;
daughters present.. The'Misses Slocum were the belles&#xD;
of. Crofton, :and were as, much .sought after for their&#xD;
wealth as for any accomplishments they possessed. Mr.&#xD;
Slocum was very corpulent, and his manners exceeding-&#xD;
ly stiff and. starchy.. His daughters were obedient dis-&#xD;
'ciples, and early imbibed the exalted 'notions of their.&#xD;
parents.. The. young men' of Crofton, who were not&#xD;
wealthy, were not welcome guests at Slocum hall.  Sb-&#xD;
qum had instructed ;his daughters, before arriving at&#xD;
Mr. ROckford's;.not to receive any advances from young&#xD;
lawyer' Spingles, or from Dr. Montage, as they were&#xD;
both very poor.- -'He had never been pleased with their&#xD;
visits to his house. When he took his seat,' and ob-&#xD;
served that both of the'young men named were present,&#xD;
he felt'disguieted. He enjoined upon his wife the ne-&#xD;
cessity of keeping a' iict surveillance over Amelia and&#xD;
Jula during the evening. He was not kept long in&#xD;
suspense, for Spingles 'waf casting furtive glances in the&#xD;
direction of the Slocum circle. Miss Amelia reddened,&#xD;
her fatlyer grew angry, and her, mothe  darted basilisk&#xD;
glances at Spingies.&#xD;
"Here he comes,; wife," said Slocum. ."Just leave&#xD;
him to ne. ' I will not let him enjoy the company of&#xD;
ourdaughter very long.'&#xD;

;&#xD;
,&#xD;
-:&#xD;
;&#xD;
._&#xD;
&#xD;
Spingles, who was a young man of sterling worth,&#xD;
but poor and proud, now approached and saluted each&#xD;
member of' the Slocum family, and .seated himself' be-&#xD;
side Miss Amelia., He had scarcelypassed the compli-&#xD;
ments of the evening, when Slocum, after having made&#xD;
an attack upon his gold snuff-box, which he-never neg-&#xD;
lected to display upon all occasions, addressed- Spingles&#xD;
after the following style:&#xD;
"You have. only been residing in the. town a few&#xD;
years, I believe, Mr. Spingles?"&#xD;
"Four years next Fall," said the young mnan.&#xD;
. Where did you graduate, sir.?  My sons all grad-&#xD;
uated at Yale College," rejoined the irated Slocum.&#xD;
"-Indeeed, sir," replied Spingles, "I must confess&#xD;
that I had not the advantages of a' collegiate course."&#xD;
"Pity, pity, sir ; but you cannot expect to arrive' at&#xD;
distinction. .A young man without wealth, or the pres-&#xD;
tige 'of family influence, cannot aspire to lofty positions&#xD;
in society."&#xD;
"Truly, sir," said Spingles, "I am at a loss to com-&#xD;
prehend you. I cannot believe that you desire to offend&#xD;
me, but your conversation has assumed a strange form&#xD;
for a social circle. I despise the.aristocracy-of wealth,&#xD;
' r the false position a young man tries to assume by the&#xD;
aid of family influence. , If *'tour remarks are intended&#xD;
to apply to' my penniless circumstances, I must ask the&#xD;
pardon of. your exalted reverence, promising not again&#xD;
to place myself in p position to receive an affront from&#xD;
} an ill-mannered aristocrat."&#xD;
Slocum was nonplussed. He endeavored to explain,,&#xD;

'&#xD;
&#xD;
but the young man turned a deaf ear to his confused&#xD;
apology, and passed into another circle. The Slocums&#xD;
did 'not enjoy themselves as well as they anticipated, as&#xD;
.they screened themselves from the contact- of their in-&#xD;
feriors; their equals (in Wealth) had but little to gain&#xD;
in seeking their confidence.&#xD;
Mr. Rockford.and his good lady passed from room to&#xD;
room, endeavoring to render their guests comfortable&#xD;
and entirely at home. Watson and Judson were' de-&#xD;
lighted with the pleasant company. They proved them,&#xD;
selves particularly interesting to several yonng ladies,&#xD;
whose acquaintance they had formed several days before.&#xD;
Aunt Margery gave entertainment to the. old folks, who&#xD;
chiefly assembled in a parlor apart from the gay young&#xD;
men and women. Sebastian, and a few. juveniles, en-&#xD;
joyed themselves in the nursery, as the mother had set&#xD;
a table there for their especial benefit.&#xD;
Rockford house. was indeed filled with merriment.&#xD;
The long piazza was crowded with promenades, who&#xD;
chose to. pass, an hour thus in social chit-chat. The&#xD;
moon shone brightly upon some wh  stepped out 'upon&#xD;
the terrace:to pluck- a .flower, or tb whisper the soft&#xD;
words of first love.&#xD;
',Time flew by on golden winglts," and still pleasure&#xD;
fanned the cheek of every one that sought it. The&#xD;
haughty fe*w   QYrthrew themselves upon their dignity,&#xD;
as was the customof the Slocums, were almost entirely&#xD;
overlooked and neglected.  Some gathered 'around the&#xD;
chess and whist tables, others engaged in lively conver-&#xD;
sation. Snibbens let off superfluoius quantities of gas.&#xD;
&#xD;
to the edification of some, but to the amusement or dis-&#xD;
gusL of the more refined., The old folks heartily longed&#xD;
for supper time to come. Samuel and Dorothy were&#xD;
anxious to see the table, and the former fully intended&#xD;
to-do the subject full justice..&#xD;
It was whispered around that there would be a sur-&#xD;
prise, as-they termed it, immediately after supper, but&#xD;
it was not ascertained what the performance would con-&#xD;
sist of. Every one was in suspense, when the announce-&#xD;
ment for supper was made. There was a general rush&#xD;
for partners, and the long hall was crowded almost to&#xD;
suffocation. When the magnificent feast was concluded&#xD;
and the company had repaired to the parlors again, Mr.&#xD;
Rockford invited the ladies to walk up to the rooms upon&#xD;
the second flgor.&#xD;
Mr. Rockford was rather opposed to making an aris-&#xD;
tocratic display upon any occasion, but he'wished to&#xD;
amuse his guests.- He had invited a few select and&#xD;
tasty friends, of both sexes, to his house, a few .days&#xD;
before the party, and they had gotten up some tableaux&#xD;
and charades. After two or three rehearsals,.they were&#xD;
prepared for the representation. A temporary stage,&#xD;
some scenery and a drop-curtain were prepared.&#xD;
Tableaux-vivants! What could it. mean ? .asked a&#xD;
hundred persons of Snibbens, who was the oracle of a&#xD;
certain class in the town. Snibbens had not "looked&#xD;
out " the word, and was at his row's end. He scratched&#xD;
his head, bit his pale lips, and said nothing. .One of&#xD;
the young men supposed it meant table-turning, or some-&#xD;
thing of that' kind, he was not exactly certain. Uncle&#xD;

Samuel told them. they would learn what it meant by&#xD;
waiting, as he was sure Mr. Rockford meant not, only&#xD;
to amuse, but to instruct them. Dorothy, having drank.&#xD;
five or six glasses of wine and syllabub, fell fast asleep,&#xD;
supported by the stalwart .arm1 of her husband. At&#xD;
length the curtain rose,: and revealed an interesting&#xD;
group. An officer, rather beyond the prime of life,&#xD;
stood gazing at a departing ship.. Several were looking&#xD;
upon him with sorrowful)countenances. A harpist re-&#xD;
clined upon:his instrument; several attendants were&#xD;
represented as weeping. The tableau was complete&#xD;
the curtain dropped. It.was Napoleon at the island of&#xD;
St. Helena.  Snibbens was charmed. He recognized&#xD;
the god of his .adoration. He had overheard a gentle-&#xD;
man tell another the meaning of " tableaux-vivants, 'and&#xD;
he was now explaining it to several around him.&#xD;
The curtain rose 'again#and revealed the: inside of a'&#xD;
prison. . A tall, finely formed man, dressed in the cos-&#xD;
tume of the Elizabethan age, was clasping the hands of&#xD;
a lady, and imprinting a kiss upon her brow. The sul-&#xD;
len wardefi held the massive bunch of keys in one hand,&#xD;
and beheld the scene with feelings of indifference. A&#xD;
file of soldiers awaited without, holding their muskets,&#xD;
with match-locks, prepaid for any emergencies." The.&#xD;
fetters had bgen taken from the ankles of the distin-&#xD;
guished personage, but his wrists were secured with a&#xD;
chain. His maiiuscripts and books revealed his studious&#xD;
habits. The taper was burning at his table. It was&#xD;
Sii Walter Rileigh taking leave of. his wife on the&#xD;
morning of his execution.&#xD;
&#xD;
After the performers had exhibited quite a numbers&#xD;
of excellent tableaux, Mr. Rockford announced that a&#xD;
few charades or rebuses would be represented. While&#xD;
the company were waiting for the curtain to rise, the&#xD;
orchestra discoursed sweet music. There is nothing so&#xD;
acceptable as music when the mind is free from care;&#xD;
there is nothing so soothing as music when the mind is&#xD;
troubled with care. Let the dulcet strains of an R olian&#xD;
harp, or the wild warbling notes of an inspired child of&#xD;
song lull us to slumber, when. our souls are sad.&#xD;
The curtain rose again. A triumphal arch, covered&#xD;
with roses and vines, was on the stand. A conqueror&#xD;
passed under it, while the ladies and children threw gar-&#xD;
lands at his feet. The scene was changed, and a group&#xD;
of shepherds, in oriental costume, appeared. They con-&#xD;
versed apart, as if expecting something wonderful to&#xD;
happen. They had heard some UQavenly music, and&#xD;
expected a vision., Suddenly a crimson light flashed&#xD;
across the stage, and an angel, appeared. The shep-&#xD;
herds fled, and the scene closed. Archangel was the&#xD;
subject.&#xD;
Many were the representations, and the company dis-&#xD;
persed.not until the small hours warned them to seek&#xD;
their homes. The party was pronounced, by'every one,&#xD;
to be a decided success. All who were present wished&#xD;
a long and happy life to Mr. Rockford, whose chief de-&#xD;
light appeared to be that of dispelling sorrows, and dis-&#xD;
pensing hlessings upon his race.&#xD;
He is a noble -benefactor, who, instead of sinking his&#xD;
friends in the sea of trouble, will take them by the hand&#xD;

CHAPTER        X.&#xD;
A few days subsequent to the party, aunt Margery&#xD;
and her company bade.adieu to the  od folks of Rock-&#xD;
ford house, and sought the pleasant town of Colonna,&#xD;
having been absent from their home much longer than&#xD;
they anticipated. Quiet was again restored to the town&#xD;
of Crofton. The escape of Royston had given place to&#xD;
the 'week's conversation to which Rockford festival had-&#xD;
given rise. There was nothing out of the routine of&#xD;
the ordinary affairs of life, worthy of notice,. in the&#xD;
place for several weeks. At length, Hans Kremple re-&#xD;
ceived a letter without a signature, but he knew from a&#xD;
glance that Royston was the, author of it. We take&#xD;
the liberty of laying the contents of the letter before&#xD;
our readers:&#xD;
"POINT PEAR, May 10th, 18-.&#xD;
"Dear lans:-I am here, in this, sylvan retreat,&#xD;

uries'of life as I wish, for the present. The close con-&#xD;
finement of the prison had almost wrecked my copsti-&#xD;

"When TIp ted 'with you.on that eventful night, I&#xD;
followed the directions you gave me, and found jolly&#xD;
Ben awaiting my arrival'with much anxiety. I sprang.&#xD;
upon the horse he had prepared for me, and. we were&#xD;
soon, beyond the vicinity of a place which had bpt few&#xD;
charms'for me. It was broad daylight when wear-&#xD;
rived at Hermit's Retreat. Our friends were expecting&#xD;
me, and were prepared to face any danger that might&#xD;
present itself on my account. The tears stole down&#xD;
my own cheeks, as I, beheld them weep at once more&#xD;
beholding me. .They' pressed around- and embraced me,&#xD;
and almost devoured me with kind offices.  .&#xD;
I dispatched a hasty meal,' change my apparel, re-&#xD;
ceved a supply of gold from the strong box, had my&#xD;
hair. snd whiskers: curtailed, and- mounted my black&#xD;
charger and left my..fiends; to seek the covert of some&#xD;
wild retreat.. ,Iam fully one hundred miles from you,&#xD;
but at present it is not exactly' prudent, for any of our&#xD;
mento. conie here. I am spending my time at the house&#xD;
of,'a good fimer,, who has taken quite .a fancy to me.&#xD;

"The killing of Winslow has placed a heavier burden&#xD;
upon my soul than any crime I ever committed ; yet I&#xD;

..'When I write you again, you shall have a descrip-&#xD;
tion of my present retreat.. You must iot laugh at me,&#xD;
Hans, for counterfeiting an honest occupation. I prefer&#xD;
to undergo even the hardest labor iniaginable, to remain-&#xD;
ing in a close prison.. Who would be deprived of the&#xD;
skies one hour, if within his power to be free?. We&#xD;
have lakes and small streams here, filled.with an abun-&#xD;
dance of fish. The scenery around y.retreathere,'is&#xD;
wild and beautiful. The hills are elevated almost to&#xD;
the height of mountains.- Iam enjoying myself .as well&#xD;
as I ever did. I am almost tempted, sometimes, to&#xD;
cut the acquaintance of suchscape ,grace.. as .you .and&#xD;

selves into scrapes you could never be, exticated £rom&#xD;
without my assistance. IDo not fear treacb ry from me.&#xD;
I'shall prove true to the end. Caution the boys to&#xD;
make no more sallies in the direction of Crofton until&#xD;

Heinrich, who .had an office not far from his own. -Hein-&#xD;
rich was' steiibly a painter; but his employees per-&#xD;
formed more work than lie did. He was 'dispatched to&#xD;
the retreat to'convey 'the information that Royston was&#xD;
safe, and would be with them at no distant. day.&#xD;
Han Kremple way a jolly fellow, who might have&#xD;
been a good citizen and a useful man, but fate had early&#xD;
decreed'that he should be a thief. He had so early&#xD;
forgotten the distinction between his own goods. and&#xD;
those of'his neighbors, that he had~arrived at the con-&#xD;
clusion that what he filched from those who could afford&#xD;
to lose it, if applied to good purposes, amounted to no&#xD;
crime. It was through his instrumentality that Roys-&#xD;
ton had been seduced from his upright course, and made&#xD;
the intrepid leadersof a lawless band of robbers. Hein-&#xD;
rich was another young man, whom the influences of&#xD;
Hans had beguiled into evil habits.&#xD;
So well concealed had been the manoeuvres of these&#xD;
lawless wights, thattsuspicion had not even rested upon&#xD;
them. Indeed, so contrary was the sentiment of the&#xD;
citizens of Crofton,: as related to the fidelity of Hans,&#xD;
that'he was generally considered to be a man of strict&#xD;
honesty.: Upon 'one occasion, when he was returning&#xD;
front' a peddling tour, he entered the town and reported&#xD;
that a banasof robbers had waylaid and robbed him of&#xD;
some of his wares. "No fox, that ever. escaped the&#xD;
huntsman by artifice, had'more cinningly devised plans&#xD;
than Hans had..&#xD;
H  frequently reported skirmishes that the citizens&#xD;
of the community had had with the banditti, but, under&#xD;

&#xD;
his lead, the officers of the'law were always led in the&#xD;
direction contrary to the place of hostilities.&#xD;
Hans had the happy faculty of attending parties, and&#xD;
making himself perfectly agreeable. He prided him-&#xD;
self upon being a judge of jewelry, 'but not being:&#xD;
contented to risk his judgment at a hasty glance, it was&#xD;
natural for him to take several silver forks and spoon&#xD;
home with him from those parties, to put them to a&#xD;
strict test. He was never known to return them to&#xD;
their right owners. It arose, probably, from leis being&#xD;
very absent minded.- Taken all in 'all, Hans was a rare&#xD;
genius. You might travel over two continents without&#xD;
finding his equal. He reminded one, of the prig, Sir&#xD;
Walter Scott described as being a man with so generous&#xD;
a heart, that he stole. a quantity If clothes to keep the&#xD;
moths from eating them. Hans kept a fine store, and&#xD;
many customers' flocked to itF to purchase fine wares,&#xD;
.and have their jewelry repaired. If some of them re-&#xD;
cognized matches to lost spoons, forks and' silver cups,&#xD;
oh! indulgent reader, do not impute it to any thing but&#xD;
chance.&#xD;
But as some authors have said, that thereaare no things&#xD;
similar or like unto each other, except, the same, we&#xD;
may at once infer that the philosophy of chance is at&#xD;
an end when brought to bear upon the-actions of Hans.&#xD;
At any rate, by' artifice and cunning, he managed to&#xD;
life above suspicion.&#xD;
He pondered several days upon the reply'it behooved&#xD;
him to return to the communication he had received from&#xD;
Royston, and, after torturing his brain for a suitable angeu&#xD;
swer, the following was agreed upon:&#xD;

For the space of several months,. the officers of jus-&#xD;
tice were upon the alert to discover the lurking place of&#xD;
the fugitive; but so well had the whole affair been rian-&#xD;
aged, it was firmly believed that- he had fled from the&#xD;
country. If suspicion had rested upon the robbers&#xD;
(whom the bestraid stratagems had,'- as- yet, failed to&#xD;
entrap) as afordmg an asylum to the convicted felon&#xD;
that suspicion only aroused those lawlessmen to greater&#xD;

been denied that privilge so long, that the company of&#xD;

The appearance of the house was by.no means pre-&#xD;
possessing, nor-was it remarkable for huge proportions&#xD;
or elegance of structure. It had only six rooms, and, to&#xD;
all    arances, it was the residence of an unpretend-&#xD;
infaramer, or a' country hotel. "Hilton House" was&#xD;
the rude sign that vibrated, at the pleasure of the wind.&#xD;
Dame Elspeth and her husband were the ostensible pro-&#xD;
prietors, the former, taking almost the entire chargeof&#xD;
the business. When Hans'drove up and alighted from&#xD;
his vehicle, ,dame Elspeth, who ,was a: ,tidy, smart old&#xD;
woian, adjusted' her spectacles, and surveyed the new-&#xD;
comer with a very scrutinizing glance. When she re-&#xD;
cognized him, her, countenance cleared up, and she&#xD;
hastened to welcome.him.&#xD;
"'Why, bless your body, Hans, is it really you that's&#xD;
come;this way once more-? It's truly a long time since&#xD;
arbody has seen ye.' I was sure some one was coming,&#xD;
for :.y nose -has been itching the blessed day.".&#xD;
tIsans was ushered into the reception room, and Els-&#xD;
petrprepared for him a hasty, though well served repast.&#xD;
Dandie Doane, the husband of Elspeth, soon came in&#xD;
fr n his work and informed Hans that six of the friends&#xD;
bad been absent eafew days, but were expected at home&#xD;

di'sdeclarations were shortly verifiedd by the ar-&#xD;
bfseveral men on horseback, followed by a wagon,&#xD;
fbicli'as drawn by two stout horses. The driver had&#xD;
-°ll the appearance of a country lut returning from&#xD;
&#xD;
market with his year's supplies, but a person versed in&#xD;
physiognomy would have arrived at a different conclu-&#xD;
sion. The whole group presented a motley appearance&#xD;
indeed ; but when they recognized Hans, they threw-off&#xD;
their reserve and appeared in their true character. Ben&#xD;
Harley was the leader of this lawless band of men in the&#xD;
absence of Royston. He was a man above the medium&#xD;
size, thick set and well, muscled.. His face and care-&#xD;
worn brow indicated that he had passed the meridian of&#xD;
life. His long, bushy beard and dark, flowing hair gave&#xD;
him a remarkable appearance, and his black, sparkling&#xD;
eye was sufficient of itself to designate him 'as a bold,&#xD;
dauntless man.&#xD;
It was night, and the sable curtains were drawn darkly&#xD;
around "Hilton House."    Dandie Doane and dame.&#xD;
Elspeth spread the festive board in, one of the rooms&#xD;
remote'from intrusion. The old folks,-at the command&#xD;
of Ben Harley, brought out the wines and several kinds&#xD;
of stronger spirituous liquors, and retired to keep watch.:&#xD;
After several glasses had. been drunk by the. company,&#xD;
Ben commanded three of the men to look after the goods,&#xD;
they had taken, and have them conveyed quietly to the&#xD;
cave, and to remove every' appearance and. vestige of&#xD;
their arrival. Two of the more trusty menu were per&#xD;
emitted to .remain with him and Hans, as the 'latter was&#xD;
a confidential friend of the gang whose society they .&#xD;
dom enjoyed.&#xD;
"Come, Ben," said Hans, "you have often promised&#xD;
to relate your advefrtures to me, but it has never been&#xD;
entirely' convenient until now. Will you not gratify me,&#xD;
this time-it will help to while away 'an hour so pleas.&#xD;

Well do I remember the stern looks and cruel reproofs&#xD;
he bestowed upon my other, when, almoAt frantic, she&#xD;
rescued me from his clutches.' Yet was I gentle and&#xD;
obedient to the tyrant; never daring to speak to him ek&amp;amp;&#xD;
cept when interrogated. My motherwas my onlyfriend.&#xD;
Without the angelic love she manifested for me; and:the&#xD;
matronly care she bestowed upon me when not restrain-&#xD;
ed by her husband,:my slender 'frame would have re-&#xD;
posed beneath the sod of the church yard ere I had&#xD;
passed my first decade. My brothers hatednie from the.&#xD;
sympathy they possessed for our father, whose love they&#xD;
had never dividedwith me. I was the unfortunate re-&#xD;
cipient of their unremitting abuses, and they compelled&#xD;
me to carry their books to and from school as if I had&#xD;
been a hired servant. I"complained to my mother of&#xD;
their unnatural treatment,- but received only her tears&#xD;
for consolation, with a promise that she 'would entreat&#xD;
my father to intercede in my behalf. "Instead of an'&#xD;
amelioration of the unfraternal manner in which my&#xD;
brothers acted towards me, it really seemed as if. they&#xD;
were bent upon my destruction.&#xD;
"It is an old adage, and a true one, that 'a hair will&#xD;
break a camel's back.' I had borne the iniults, kicks&#xD;
and rebuffs of those graceless boys so long, that 'I'was f&#xD;
determined to be submissive no more.' My heart sank&#xD;
within me, and I was almost frantic with grief; ag4if&#xD;
I could not place a:perfd to our unhappy interdcnse,&#xD;

.My resolution was soon formed. The candle my&#xD;

head was bound up, but from the regularity of his&#xD;
breathing, and from the absence of fever as indicated&#xD;
by. the feelivg of his hand, I was certain that he was&#xD;
out of danger. I kissed him ,tenderly as he he slept,&#xD;

tempestuous Mediterranean. Every enterprise must&#xD;
have an end; and all evil doers, must,- sooner or later,&#xD;
meet with the condign punishment that is merited by&#xD;
their crimes.  Our captain was the most heartless&#xD;
wretch that ever 'walked the deck of' a piratical sloop.&#xD;
If he took a notion to seize a vessel with grappling&#xD;
irogs, preparatory to boarding it, no person could per-&#xD;
suade him to desist 'from his perilous undertaking.,&#xD;
"He ordered us one day to aboard a vessel which was&#xD;
in pursuit of us. We begged, entreated and implored&#xD;
him to crowd on the sails and seek safety in flight. He&#xD;
drew his pistols from his broad belt, and threatend to&#xD;
shoot any pirate who should disobey his orders. We&#xD;
submitted ; and waiting until the vessel was near enough&#xD;
to claim as as a prize,' we poured one broad-side into it.&#xD;
The cracking of masts, and the screams of the wounded&#xD;
were heard, and before the smoke cleared away, we were&#xD;
upon the deck, making havoc with all those we encoun-&#xD;
tered. Our captain was contend'ng in a hand-to-hand-&#xD;

tigation upon me:.&#xD;
'-o rushed to his side, and implored the:pirate to&#xD;
spare my father's life. He did not heed me, but, re-&#xD;
doubling his exertions, disarmed, my father, and laid&#xD;
him prostrate and bleeding upon the deck. So quickly-&#xD;
was the work accomplished, that my interference in my&#xD;
fathers behalf was ineffectual. I drew a pistol from&#xD;
my belt, and shot the ,cruel pirate through the heart.&#xD;
lie fell and expired without a groan. I bent over the&#xD;
bleeding form of my father, and discovered that he was&#xD;
not dead. By the assistance of one of the pirates, who&#xD;
had ever been a friend to me, my father was removed&#xD;
to a.place of safety. Hurrying back to- the deck, I&#xD;
.perceived that the pirates had slain nearly all of the&#xD;
opposing combatants.&#xD;
"Great was the consternation of the pirates. when&#xD;
they beheld their beloved, yet tyrannical captain lying&#xD;
stark and stiff in the cold embraces of'death. I fondly&#xD;
hoped that no:positive evidence would convict me of theme&#xD;
wanton deed; yet I trembled at the result. When quiet&#xD;
had been restored, and the body of our captain convey-&#xD;

fact? he died in a few hours."&#xD;
"He;-was much affected when I made myself known&#xD;
to him, and fondly prayed that I would forgive him for&#xD;
the cruel treatment he had heaped upon me.' Late at&#xD;
night our captain was lowered to the depths of the sea.&#xD;
I implored my friends to permit me to behold the face&#xD;
of my parent until a few short hours should have elapsed.&#xD;
before consigning it to the watery grave:&#xD;
"We were only a few leagues from shore, and I re-&#xD;
solved to take my friend, and, in the stillness of the&#xD;
night, when the pirates, as was their custom, should&#xD;
betake themselves to deep drinking and be quieted into&#xD;
profound sleep. by too frequent draughts from the ~fes-&#xD;
tive bowl, leave forever the sickening scenes, and take&#xD;
my father's remains with me. Pierre assented to every&#xD;
proposition I made, and while our comrades were jubi-&#xD;
lant over the victories of the day, and were dividing the&#xD;
booty, we were silently making preparations for our es-&#xD;
cape when first an opportunity should present itself.&#xD;
The grief at the loss of my father, and the known at-&#xD;
tachment of Pierre to me, were a sufficient excuse for&#xD;
our absence from the ba'aquet.&#xD;
"As we had surmised, it was scarcely midnight when&#xD;
the revelry almost totally subsided; and soon after, the&#xD;
only noise we heard .was the dashing of the waves&#xD;
against the vessel. The moon had just risen in all ,its&#xD;
splendor, and the stars paled before the majestic queen&#xD;
of night. We quietly visited every portion of the ves-&#xD;
sel.' Every one was locked in the embraces'of Mor-&#xD;
&#xD;
pheus. The night-watch had yielded to the potent influ-&#xD;
ences of the wines. We hastily exchanged our sailor's&#xD;
garb for citizen's costume, and collecting supplies of&#xD;
provisions, and as much gold and silver coin as we could&#xD;
find, we lowered, our cargo, together~ with the body of&#xD;
my deceased father, into one, of the boats, and' leaving&#xD;
~the vessel to which we had been attached for so many&#xD;
years, we weresoon drifting upon the waves of the At-&#xD;
lantic.\-&#xD;
"Guided by the moon and stars, which are unerring&#xD;
guides to experienced sailors, we directed our course to&#xD;
the shore. When day dawned upon us, we could per-&#xD;
ceive no vessel of any kind within our horizon. We&#xD;
had abstracted a compass from the ship, and by its aid,&#xD;
we readily continued our course to land. About night-&#xD;
fall, we arrived at the bar of Crofton, and landed at&#xD;
one of the neglected wharfs. . We reported ourselves as&#xD;
fishermen upon an excursion, and by bribery, procured&#xD;
what assistance we needed from those who dwelt in those&#xD;
miserable huts. A suitable coffin and shroud were, pro-&#xD;
cured for my father, and it now devolved upon- me to&#xD;

" A .steamer was about to ascend the river near&#xD;
whose banks- my father's residence was located. I&#xD;
applied for tickets, and all the preparations were soon&#xD;
made. In two days, Pierre and myself landed our car-&#xD;

CHAPTER XII.&#xD;
" I swear to do this though a present death had been n re merciful.&#xD;
Come on, poor babe ; some powerful spirit instruct the kites and ravens&#xD;
to be thy nurses' Wolves and bears, they say, casting their savageness&#xD;
aside, have done like offices of pity."&#xD;
Winter's Tale.&#xD;
It is not necessary to enter into any minute descrip-&#xD;
tion of the lawless deeds that were enacted at intervals,&#xD;
at and in the vicinity of Hermit's retreat. Suffice it to&#xD;
say, they were generally of a most diabolical character.&#xD;
From the narrative of iBen Harley, the reader may at&#xD;
once infer that the wayfaring man, whom chance threw&#xD;
in their, way, was not likely to leave the retreat or its&#xD;
environs with whole bones and a full purse.&#xD;
Hans received several valuables from the band before&#xD;
he left the retreat. He paid the friends only half of&#xD;
the intrinsic value of the articles, declaring that, as he&#xD;
ran a great risk in offering the wares for sale, it was&#xD;
nothing but right for him to make a good profit.&#xD;
Leaving Hans to pursue his journey, in whatever&#xD;
direction he might select for the perfection of his nefa-&#xD;
rious schemes, the attention of the reader is directed to&#xD;
other, scenes, which may be as interesting as the record&#xD;
of any of the noted actions of' the inimitable Hans,&#xD;
Kremple.&#xD;
But it may not be out of place to borrow a familiar&#xD;
&#xD;
figure from one whose name is as familiar in both hem-&#xD;
ispheres as "'household words."  Not Charles Dickens'&#xD;
" Hous11ioLD WonDs," kind reader, for though we con-&#xD;
sider him a genius, and one of the princes of English&#xD;
literature, the writer of these pages had. rather be ex-&#xD;
cused from quoting from an author who came among us&#xD;
to enjoy our hospitality, and then, .like a frozen adder&#xD;
warmed into life by kindness, to turn and inflict upon&#xD;
us a mortal wound.&#xD;
George Payne Rainesford James, thou incomparable&#xD;
light novelist, we invoke thy aid. Thou ewert surely&#xD;
born a cavalier, or the "solitary horseman " had never&#xD;
entered into all thy plots.&#xD;
It was in the leafy month of June-that happy sea-&#xD;
son of the year, when Southern climes have first made&#xD;
glad the joyous heart: of man. When tree, and shrub;&#xD;
and vine, are laden with thetender,, though .delicious&#xD;
fruits of early summer.. It was the hour just before&#xD;
the king of day hid; his blazing head behind the western&#xD;
hills. The day had riearly closed upon the sins of mor-&#xD;
tals ; yet the lengthening shadows of the whispering&#xD;
pines gave but few tokens of approaching night. The&#xD;
scarce audible tinkle of the distant sheep bell, and the&#xD;
lowing of the home-returning herds recalled the enthu-&#xD;
siast from his rustic dreams, and bade him remember&#xD;
that he was. remote from the noise and clamor of the&#xD;
busy city.&#xD;
It was at such an hour that a "solitary horseman"&#xD;
might have been seen at the distance of more than .a.&#xD;
mile from the'Hermit's retreat. His noble charger-&#xD;

whether of the Arabian or Canadian breed, the ehroni-&#xD;
cle doth. not relate---had the appearance of having been&#xD;
ridden hard, though his proud spirit could not submit to&#xD;
the goadings of the rowel.&#xD;
"So ho ! Dapple--softly Dapple,- said the rider, as&#xD;
he reigned in the horse, " dost not know thy master ?&#xD;
By my:Halidon, an I had a few more leagues to travel,&#xD;
thou shouldst rue thy conduct.&#xD;
A powerful mastiff bounded to the stirrup of his mas-&#xD;
ter, and signified his joy at the subjection of the horse.&#xD;
"Down, Wimple, down! dost thou not remember the&#xD;
trouble thou gavest me last night at the inn ? Gramer-&#xD;
cy, sir, an thou troublest me again, thy shaggy skin&#xD;
shall feel the vengeful weight of this whip."&#xD;
Suiting the action to the words, the powerful rider&#xD;
flecked the sagacious animal more than once, which sent&#xD;
him howling toy his proper station in the rear.&#xD;
The rider was not dressed in "Lincoln Green;" nor&#xD;
in the garb of the knights errant, though Brian de Bois&#xD;
Gilbert might have coveted the fine limbs of the un-&#xD;
known    le did not ride with the majestic mien of-the&#xD;
"Black Knight," nor with the ease and grace of Wilford&#xD;
of -Ivanhoe ; yet, there was something very attractive&#xD;
and romantic about his appearance. He was .dressed&#xD;
after the fashoin of;a gay Southern gentleman, whose&#xD;
chief pleasure is the chase. His dark hair correspond-&#xD;
ed to the waving black plume that played with his flowing&#xD;
ringlets. His features were concealed by a waxen mask,&#xD;
which gave him rather a cavalier-like appearance.&#xD;

ty of 'ne who' was accustomed. to the management of&#xD;
horses, the rider dismounted beside the banks of a soft&#xD;
rippling brook, and taking his pistols from the holster.&#xD;
examined the flints and priming, which he found to&#xD;
be in perfect order. Replacing the pistols with a&#xD;
self-satisfied air, the "solitary horseman " drew out a&#xD;
traveling flask, which was filled with delicious spirits,&#xD;
if an eye-witness could -have judged by the pleasure&#xD;
with which he exhausted a large portion of its contents&#xD;
He poured a few drops of the liquid into the nostrils of&#xD;
the panting horse. This being done, he produced a cup&#xD;
from his traveling sack, and dipping up water from the&#xD;
brook, sprinkled it over the head and neck of the horse.&#xD;
After remaining at the brook a few minutes longer,&#xD;
the unknown again mounted; and, giving the reins to&#xD;
Dapple, he was soon speeding swiftly in the direction&#xD;
of the Hermit's retreat. Wimple had forgotten his late&#xD;
castigation, and followed' the fleet footsteps of Dap-&#xD;
ple, with much love for his master. The owl hooted&#xD;
from the hollow 'oak, the hare 'fled to the covert, the&#xD;
shimmering rays of twilight closed up the day, but still&#xD;
the hardy and dauntless rider kept on his course. (We&#xD;
thank you, Mr. James, for a few random thoughts.)&#xD;
13y the permission of the reader, we will imagine our-&#xD;
selves (that is,' the reader and ego) arrived at the Her-&#xD;
mit's retreat a few minutes in advance of the unknown.&#xD;
Ben Harley and his'gang had just returned from the&#xD;
cave, whither they' had been to secure the spoils of the&#xD;
last expedition.' Dandie and dame Elspeth were busily&#xD;
preparing the repast. The candles were lit in the re-&#xD;

ception room of the hotel, and the' members of the&#xD;
household were waiting patiently for the supper bell to&#xD;
ring.&#xD;
"Pierre," sait Ben, "our last expedition was a blood-&#xD;
less victory, yet we returned home- laden with spoils.&#xD;
If there were not so much uncertainty and danger con-&#xD;
con neeted with our business, the life we lead here would&#xD;
be a pleasant one, compared to the seafaring existence&#xD;
of a sailor."&#xD;
".True, Ben," said Pierre, "but then we are put to&#xD;
so much inconvenience in concealing our' booty ; and&#xD;
then ,we have to use all sorts of expedients to keep from&#xD;
detection. Just remember, only a few days since, you&#xD;
and -I were so hotly pursued br the officers that we&#xD;
barely had time to spring into the copse, and hastily&#xD;
transform ourselves into ragged mendicants--which we&#xD;
did with so much adroitness that we were not suspected&#xD;
by the beagles of justice, as they passed in full pursuit.&#xD;

" I suspect,, Pierre, that you long again to be in a con-&#xD;

soulless heathen ! Is it not sufficient that you take the&#xD;
last sous from, the trembling traveler ? Yet, we can&#xD;
scarcely withhold 'you from slaying every one we cespoil&#xD;
of his purse and 6ther' valuables. Ah.! 'Pierre, you will&#xD;
have to render a strange account to your Maker one of&#xD;
these days."&#xD;
" Softly, Ben," said Pierre, as he laughingly directed a&#xD;
knowing glance tothe window where Bensat, "you speak&#xD;
as lightly as if you had never aimed a deadly stroke&#xD;

of the cimeter at the head of that fat Dutchman who&#xD;
was imploring you to save his life."&#xD;
," Quiet, Pierre," retorted Ben, "I was not much to&#xD;
blame ;. you know I could never make head or tail out&#xD;
of that delightful language. How did I know what the&#xD;
thick tongued foreigner was saying?"&#xD;
"But, Ben, the signal of distress is always legible,&#xD;
it mattereth not whatsigns are made to represent it."&#xD;
" Oh ! you piratical imp," said Ben, "to listen at&#xD;
your jargon, one would be disposed to think that you&#xD;
had turned preacher and abjured the wickedness of your&#xD;
ways."&#xD;
." Ben," said Pierre, "let us. be quits on those scores.&#xD;
When have you heard from Carl?"&#xD;
" I do not know," replied Ben, "It seems-."&#xD;
Here the sentence of the outlaw was cut short by the&#xD;
sound of, horses' feet near at hand.&#xD;
" What can the fellow mean ?" said Ben, as the shrill&#xD;
notes of a bugle saluted their ears. "The man ,must&#xD;
be a herald of an Eastern troop just from Palestine.&#xD;
I do wonder if the wand of Merlin. has transport-&#xD;
ed us to another hemisphere, and the wheels of Time&#xD;
have rolled back five centuries? These are strange times,&#xD;
Pierre ; go and see whit sir Knight wanteth."&#xD;
Pierre went as he was directed, and perceiving that&#xD;
the unknown was masked and spoke not, his knees&#xD;
shook under him. He supposed that he stood in the&#xD;
presence of a spectre horseman, or tlhe shades of one of&#xD;
those luckless men whom his bloody hands had sent to&#xD;
his last account. Running back to Ben, Pierre declar-&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb  n="120-121" xml:id="VAC7718-00000061"/>&#xD;
ed that the place was haunted or was about to be put&#xD;
under a "spell."  Pierre ran. to the sofa and hid his&#xD;
head betWeen its cushioned pillows, while Ben went, him-&#xD;
self, to -ask.the rider in what manner he could be served.&#xD;
Approaching the, horseman, Ben made a very polite&#xD;
bow, and asked in genteel phrase after the health of the&#xD;
unknown knight. (We must imitate G. Payne Raines-&#xD;
ford once more.)  "Polite sir," replied the unknown,&#xD;
"I am on a pilgrimage to the shrine of my lady of the&#xD;
BROKEN HEART.    She resideth only a days' journey&#xD;
from this spot, as my directions, given me by the 'Sis-&#xD;
ters of Mercy' at my departure from my castle, plainly&#xD;
indicate. It behooveth me to pay adorations at her&#xD;
sainted shrine, 'and I have a burden at my heart which&#xD;
cannot be removed except by her forgiveness. I crave&#xD;
rest for myself and refreshments for my horse and dog,&#xD;
(may Saint Barnabas protect them !) but. as for me, no&#xD;
food except that which hath been sanctified by the pray-&#xD;
ers of the .Sisters of Mercy " must enter these lips'&#xD;
until I shall have knelt me at the shrine of my lady of&#xD;
the BROKEN HEART."&#xD;
" Alight, sir knight," said Ben, who was determined&#xD;
to explore this; mystery. "Our cottage shall be your&#xD;
resting place for one night. ' No pilgrim to the shrine&#xD;
of my lady of the BROKEN HEART shall ever be turned&#xD;
from our door. Here,'. Pedro, see to the-horse ; and&#xD;
you, sir pilgrim, follow me, and I will conduct you into&#xD;
our humble castle. Ho ! warden, lower-the port culls&#xD;
and admit your, commandant and his guest." But,&#xD;

Ben implored the forgiveness of his stately companion,&#xD;
who, approaching the unsanctified person 'of the fierce&#xD;
robber, whisperad a few words .into his ear, which pro-&#xD;
duced a perceptible change in the demeanor ,of Ben.&#xD;
"Your instructions shall be obeyed to the letter; and&#xD;
we must keep up the deceptive appearance," said Ben,&#xD;
who conducted him into the reception room.&#xD;
Dame Elspeth commenced counting her beads, as she&#xD;
dropped a plate of savory victuals in the yard. She&#xD;
was certain' her time had come. She imagined that the&#xD;
arch-fiend had come to claim and bear her off as a prize.&#xD;
"May the saints beshrew me," said Dandie, .,as he&#xD;
hastened to the relief of his spouse, "the wife is daft,&#xD;
yet blessings -upon her, she hath a braver heart than&#xD;
mine. What cowards doth conscience make of us all !"&#xD;
"Pull off your 'visor, sir knight," said Ben. as he led&#xD;
the unknown to a seat, "and taste some of our refresh-&#xD;
ments."&#xD;
" It. is not permitted me by my vow," replied the un-&#xD;
known, "to discover my features to mortal until I have&#xD;
paid my vows at the shrine of my lady of the BROKEN&#xD;
HEART."&#xD;
'Tis he, 'tis he," said Pierre, "'tis my victim," as&#xD;
he rushed from the room, followed by his companions,&#xD;
leaving the unknown and Ben alone. The former was&#xD;
shown to his room, while the latter i'n vain -endeavored&#xD;
to collect his friends around the festive' board. It is&#xD;
needless to add, that the room of the unknown was not&#xD;
entered that night for the purpose 'of robbery, nor were&#xD;

horseman was. soon out of sight.&#xD;
When' Ben summoned. Pierre and his comrades, he&#xD;
could scarcely make them leave their rooms. In 'order&#xD;
that he might keep up the appearance of mystery, he&#xD;
told them that no stranger had been there, but supposed&#xD;
they must have been disturbed by ugly dreams.&#xD;
By the leave of the reader, the scene changes from&#xD;
Hermit's retreat to the house of Mr. Rockford. On&#xD;
the evening of the day subsequent to the departure of&#xD;
the "unknown knight " from the Hermit's retreat, Mr.&#xD;
Rockford was sitting in his piazza, reading to his wife,&#xD;
while Sebastian, whom we have not seen in several&#xD;
months, was playing upon the front yard with his pets.&#xD;
"Josephine," said the husband, "Sebastian has grown&#xD;
so niucli lately that Captain Walsingham' will scarcely&#xD;
recognize him when he comes to see us to-morrow.. The&#xD;
boy looks so handsome in. the new suit you have made&#xD;
him, suppose we let the nurse take him down to the&#xD;
beach and play a while in the shade.' He loves to see&#xD;
the waves lash upon the shore."&#xD;
The request of the father was complied with, and&#xD;
Sebastian kissed his parents and departed with the&#xD;
nurse. 'Mr.'.Rockford continued his reading until.it was&#xD;

spectacles gave the stranger a comical expression.&#xD;
"Hans has more strange acquaintances than any man&#xD;
in Crofton," said Mr. Rockford to himself, as. he hur-&#xD;
ried past them.' Before he arrived at the office, Mr.&#xD;
Rockford encountered Mr. Snibbens, who had just dis-&#xD;
missed his school. The pedagogue bored the good man&#xD;
to the quick in trying to illustrate something beyond&#xD;
his own comprehension.&#xD;
Mr. Rockford was busily engaged in the investigation&#xD;
of a "case," and Was hunting up all the "points,"&#xD;
when one of his servants, hastily entering his office,&#xD;
implored him to return home immediately, as something&#xD;
dreadful had 'happened. ~ Mr. Rockford was a man not&#xD;
easily excited, but was generally disposed to encounter&#xD;
and overcome obstacles with composure. Sippgsing that&#xD;
his presence at his own house was absolutely necessary,&#xD;
he hastened home, much troubled in mind.&#xD;
When he entered his house, he found everything in&#xD;
utter confusion. The servants were running in every&#xD;
direction. Mrs. Rockford ran about the house almost&#xD;
frantic. Mr.IRockford was horror-stricken when he learn-&#xD;
ed that Sebastian had been taken from the nurse by a&#xD;
party of men who had landed in haste from habo  and,&#xD;
before she could give the alarm, they had pushed from&#xD;
shore and sailed away.&#xD;

CHAPTER XIII.&#xD;
THE reader must now imagine that' five years have&#xD;
passed away since the strange abduction of Sebastian&#xD;
Rockford. ;We must now change the scene of our story&#xD;
from Grofton, and introduce new characters' into our&#xD;
romance, and follow up, if possible, the fortunes of our&#xD;
little hero. ~&#xD;
The greatest. men who have ever figured upon the&#xD;
stage of life, and-whose actions have been noted, either&#xD;
descended from the Plebian race; or their road to fame&#xD;
was traversed with dangers and difficulties. It is a sin-&#xD;
gular-'fact, and one worthy of note, that men may be&#xD;
bornto  wealth, but individuals must work their way to&#xD;
distinction. Alfred the Great, who was one of the most&#xD;
valiant kings that ever sat upon the throne of the Brit-&#xD;
ish nation,-was an outcast and a beggar in his own couw-&#xD;
try, until the Fates decreed that a wise man should be&#xD;
called back to the helm of State.}&#xD;
Wise men, on the contrary, have declared that our&#xD;
fortunes are' not in, our stars, but in ourselves. If such&#xD;
be the fact, then the 'science of Astrology is at an end.&#xD;
Two thousand years have passed since the wise Chal-&#xD;
deari looked up at the Heavenly bodies and read the&#xD;
future history of nations by the fitful changes of the&#xD;
it  kling stars. Antiquity itself has taken its rise-&#xD;

Who that is an enthusiast'and an admirer of the Hea-&#xD;
venly bodies, has not watched the motions of the plan-&#xD;
ets and wished'that a sign might be given unto him ?&#xD;
You are a coward, and it can be very plainly demonstrated&#xD;
even to your own satisfaction. You start at an appari-&#xD;
tion in a dream, and the cold sweat bedews your brow,&#xD;
and you thrust your timid head under the bed clothes&#xD;
on awaking, for fear that you, in reality, may behold&#xD;
the realization of your "poetic nightmare." Dare you&#xD;
at such times walk into -a cemetery and commune alone&#xD;
with the spirits of departed friends ? You shrink from&#xD;
the task; you fear that you might call up spirits from&#xD;
the vasty deep which would not down at your bidding.&#xD;
They are not morallybrave who start pt the apparitions&#xD;
of night. Those that sleep the, sleep of death are our&#xD;
best friends, or we should be infested with numberless&#xD;

soil you may call your own ?&#xD;
Oh! reader, if the dead are permitted to walk forth&#xD;
at night, they will be seen only in your. feverish imagi-&#xD;

Do you love fiction? listen at the conversation of the&#xD;
giddy crowds that, throng your thoroughfares. If they&#xD;
have lately come into possession of a fact, the rules of&#xD;
addition and subtraction will soon make truth appear&#xD;

our funny female writers, (God bless and ,put them all&#xD;
to some occupation that is" more remunerative than&#xD;
writing for one dollar and fifty-cents a column!) who&#xD;
spin out sixteen pages a. day in descanting upon the&#xD;
travels of a certain toady in Lapland. One of those&#xD;
blessed ladies, who has swept all Southern male authors&#xD;
from the gay pages of Romance ,with one shake of her&#xD;
curls, once wrapped herself up in a buffalo robe ,with-&#xD;
we shallnot call its name-at any rate, this was only&#xD;
in imagination. She )ad read the book of travels, and&#xD;
having nothingielse to write about, she got into the&#xD;
sleigh with it, (remember, reader, this was only in fancy)&#xD;

&#xD;
the dear creature ! she is perfectly sincere,when she de-&#xD;
clares that men have but little genius. -We had rather&#xD;
be wanting in genius than- to strive to imitate every&#xD;
toadyish tale writer and poetaster who have forgotten&#xD;
how to .call things by their proper names.&#xD;
We have no distaste to the.writings of the ladies, but&#xD;
we would have beautiful governments if their wise (?)&#xD;
mandates were followed up. There are only two lady&#xD;
authors whose works can stand the test of criticism-&#xD;
we mean as distinguished writers-and those are Jane&#xD;
Porter and Madame De Stael. Their mission seemed&#xD;
to be to wreath garlands of immortality of ivy green to&#xD;
crown their noble heads.&#xD;
.We have a few man-milliners in the United States,&#xD;
who surely belong to the class of MISTAKENDOM.-&#xD;
Letthem commence writing upon whatever subject they&#xD;
please, they will make rit convenient to quarrel with the&#xD;
fashionable ladies of "Madison Square" about the&#xD;
flounces of their dresses, the feathers upon the edges of&#xD;
their fans; and some of them have wisely invented&#xD;
rouges and pomades, and a thousand little things for the&#xD;
ladies that they (the ladies) never thought of themselves.&#xD;
Those man-milliners are so delicately modest that, in-&#xD;
stead of;calling a silver thimble by its proper name, they&#xD;
will denominate it a semiperforated argental truncated&#xD;
cone. Others, though. bachelors, would not dare to un-&#xD;
dress'in a room in which there is a pin-cushion, because&#xD;
the needles have eyes. Those fashionable critics have&#xD;
given rise to the Flora McFlimseys who, though ar-&#xD;
rayed in purple,".hav't a thing in the wide world to&#xD;
wear.&#xD;

,Two boys who have been reared up together ag broth-&#xD;
ers, having received the',same kind , attentions from in-&#xD;
dulgent parents, were never i ore unlike .than Falkner&#xD;
and Cdrolan. If there was nothing, vicious and sordid&#xD;
about the latter, he possessed, but few or none ,of the&#xD;
ennobling traits of the former. , Falkuer was an excep,&#xD;
tion to the majority of boys' of his age. If,,;he read a&#xD;
book, it was with caretthat he tried to profit by its wise&#xD;
instructions., His father had so lectured:him upon' the&#xD;
first principles of Jiterature, that he was readily enabled&#xD;
to judge of the merits and demerits of any composition..&#xD;
Nature seemed to have formed hin for, a scholar, and&#xD;
his father intended to give him, all the benefits of a lib-&#xD;
eral education.  Corolan should enjoy the same oppor-&#xD;
tunities, too, though he might not profit thereby.&#xD;
Some of our readers will remember that a promise&#xD;
was made in the commencement of this book, that a va-&#xD;
riety of scenes should be introduced to please all classes&#xD;
of those who delight' in reading romances. I' we in-&#xD;
troduce the wise teacher of those interesting boys, and&#xD;
give a few of his "wise saws and 'modern instances,"&#xD;
will the reader grow tired ? We  hope not.&#xD;

lessons well learned each day, will soon make up the&#xD;
fund of a boy's education."&#xD;
" True, my friend," said the dominie, "that is exactly&#xD;
wh t I endeavor to teach my lads, non quarn multum,&#xD;
sec quan 'bene. There is another wise saying, which is&#xD;
worth its weight in gold, labor omnia vincit. If I can&#xD;
not teach a boy to observe all these wise sayings, and&#xD;
conform entirely to 'my precepts, I almost despair of'&#xD;
his ever arriving at proficiency. I exhaust every pos-&#xD;
sible plan before I confess -that I can not teach a boy&#xD;
who has even common capacity. Some of the best and&#xD;
most accurate scholars we read-of, either in ancient or&#xD;
modern times, were very dull boys. But patience and&#xD;
perseverence on the part of their instructors, overcame&#xD;
every obstruction. You must not. be too uneasy about&#xD;
the backwardness of Corolan. He has an excellent&#xD;
mind, but his ideas have not yet been reached. He is&#xD;
averse to study. If he ever learns much, it must be&#xD;
either voluntarily or from observation."&#xD;
The dominie made use of many Latin, Greek and&#xD;
French quotations during the conversation, which we&#xD;
omit from the fact that many of our readers are not&#xD;
. linguists. Falkner was an atttentive listener and often&#xD;
joined in the conversation: Mr. Manning knew that&#xD;
the dominie was versed in English as well as Latin poe-&#xD;
try. In order to draw him out on some other subject,&#xD;
he changed the conversation.&#xD;
"What are your ideas of happiness, dominie Heflin ?"&#xD;
said the host.&#xD;

"It exists as much in our imagination as in anything&#xD;
else,-I think," replied the teacher.&#xD;
" Suppose we should imagine ourselves miserable ?"&#xD;
"Then, my friend, there is an end to the enigma;&#xD;
for you may ,safely say'that happiness is a riddle too."&#xD;
(Aquam da mihi, master Falkner.)&#xD;
While the youth ordered a glass of water, the father&#xD;
brought out the wine.   At. the sight of the cut glass&#xD;
decanters and silver goblets, the eyes of the dominie&#xD;
sparkled, and he almost forgot his enunciation of hap-&#xD;
piness.&#xD;
"Rogo te aquam, sed mihivinum das," and the dominie&#xD;
drank the health of his friend in more than one glass.&#xD;
The domine was upon the point of feeling a portion of&#xD;
what some men call happiness, and he thus commenced:&#xD;
"You ask my opinion in regard to happiness.    I will&#xD;
just quote a few lines from the bard of Twickenham:&#xD;
'Oh, Happiness! our being's-end and aim,&#xD;
Good, pleasure, ease, content'- whate'er thy name:&#xD;
That something still which prompts the eternal sigh,&#xD;
For which we bear to ,five, or dare to die:&#xD;
Which still so near us, yet beyond us lies,&#xD;
'O'erlook:ed, seen double, by the fool and wise&#xD;
Plant of celestial seed! if dropped below,&#xD;
Say in what mortal soil thou deign'st to grow?&#xD;
Here we have what happiness is, and what it may&#xD;
not be. We cannot deny that all men desire to exist&#xD;
in a state of bliss, yet their mode of living may differ&#xD;
as widely as the habits of the animals of the Torrid and&#xD;
North Frigid Zones.    The pleasure of this man may&#xD;
consist in drinking and riotous living, while the enjoy-&#xD;
&#xD;
1 6             ROCKFORD&#xD;
&#xD;
f,&#xD;
r-&#xD;
&#xD;
ment of another may be exactly the reverse.  One man&#xD;
may love ease-another is not contented unless he is in&#xD;
continual motion. We may hale happiness within our&#xD;
grasp, yet sigh for enjoyments which may lead to mis-&#xD;
ery. Thus, you see, happiness is a myth, or a will-o-&#xD;
the-wisp.  It may be ever in sight, yet, like the mirage&#xD;
of the desert, vanish into air as we approach it."&#xD;
"But,.doninie," said the host, "are you not sure&#xD;
that Pope was right in his deductions, or do you not&#xD;
think he was melancholy at times,, and longed for things&#xD;
he did not need ?"&#xD;
"It is hard to tell," said the patriarch of Academus,&#xD;
"we must take a man's writings at what they are worth.&#xD;
He has but few equals as an essayist, and no superiors&#xD;
as an original thinker and correct versifier."&#xD;
"Alexander Pope," rejoined. Mr. Manning, "had&#xD;
correct views upon any subject. If he had lived in&#xD;
our day, when learning has received so many auxiliaries,&#xD;
he would have left us a greater legacy than he has.&#xD;
But let.us look and see what he says further upon our.&#xD;
subject in point:&#xD;
- Order is Heaven's first law; and this confessed,-&#xD;
Some are, and must be, greater than the rest,&#xD;
More rich, more wise ; but who infers from hence&#xD;
That such are happier, shocks all common sense.&#xD;
"Here, my good Heflin, we are assured that happi-&#xD;
ness is not alone confined to the wealthy classes. It is&#xD;
very natural for us to hear some men long for wealth,&#xD;
while others, who are rich in heaps of gold, long for&#xD;
the repose that is bought only by a competency.  For&#xD;

&#xD;
the very reason that we are never satisfied, we may&#xD;
rightly infer that happiness is only a relative term.-&#xD;
When a'limit shall have been placed to our desires,&#xD;
theAi we may know how-to appreciate happiness. I fear,&#xD;
sometimes, it is like 4 humming-bird. It is almost a&#xD;
miracle to catch one, and when you confine the little&#xD;
Peri, it dies. To sum up the, whole subject and place&#xD;
it in a nut-shell, Happiness is LIBERTY."&#xD;
The dominie was about to enter at large upon several&#xD;
*points, but the dinner-bell was heard, and the discussion&#xD;
ended. ..&#xD;
The meal was scarcely concluded, when one of the,&#xD;
servants entered the room hastily and told the master&#xD;
that the black pony had come back without Corolan.&#xD;
There was much confusion in the house for the next few&#xD;
minutes. When Mrs. Manning had been sufficiently&#xD;
quieted, her husband followed the dominie and Falkner,&#xD;
who had taken some of the servants and gone in quest&#xD;
of the missing boy.&#xD;

CHAPTER        XVI.&#xD;
WHEN we least expect danger it is at our door.-&#xD;
Though we may linger in the paths of pleasure and&#xD;
gather flowers from all the hedges, yet a serpent may&#xD;
lie hidden in the rosy bower to inflict upon us the mor-&#xD;
tal wound. Is it better for us to long for all the pleas-&#xD;
ures of earth at once, and to expect the full train of evils&#xD;
to flood in upon. us in their natural, course afterwards,&#xD;
or to long for an alternation of the good and the evil?&#xD;
It is difficult for us to bring our minds io a right deci-&#xD;
sion.&#xD;
All things do' not happen by chance, or the whole&#xD;
fabric of the Christian religion would be- overthrown.&#xD;
It was necessary in olden times for prophecies to be&#xD;
fulfilled, which gave some semblance to FATALISM;. yet,&#xD;
both Moral law and the light of reason dispell that in-&#xD;
fatuation. If God moves in a mysterious way, it is'not&#xD;
for us io divine the cause; or demand the reason.&#xD;
There. are thousands of. things-as we are taught-.&#xD;
which will not be revealed to us until the dgy of rgrne..&#xD;
MENT. Why cannot man discern all things? Why is&#xD;
it not given him to-explore all the foundations of science ?&#xD;
Was he not forbidden to eat of the fruit of the Tree of&#xD;
Life? Let us reason a while. Why can not a man uali&#xD;

the reason that he is notan elephant. Why can he not&#xD;
survey the starry Heavens and discover new planets&#xD;
without the aid of A telescope ?  Simply because the&#xD;
Great I AM hath placed those bodies too far for his&#xD;
vision to scan.&#xD;
"Why has not man a microscopic eye &#xD;
For this plain reason : man is not a fly."&#xD;
If the father of Corolan had known what evil would&#xD;
have befallen his son, his 'influence and fatherly kind-&#xD;
ness would have kept the boyya close prisoner at home.&#xD;
Bt Mr. Manning was like the majority of' men; he&#xD;
was perfectly willing to trust tochance in some respect.&#xD;
The paths that youth are compelled to tread are so be-&#xD;
sprinkled with flowers and thbrns, that every step is a&#xD;
venture. But to our narrative.&#xD;
Oorolan saddled the black pony, and having mounted,&#xD;
rode off briskly in the direction of Oak-Lawn----the vil-&#xD;
lage at which his father recieved his mails. As we have&#xD;
before related, the boy -had a will of his own. He was&#xD;
possessed of a  dauntless spirit, and if he took it into&#xD;
his head to. accomplish an object, he would never desist&#xD;
from an endeavor until he had tried eveiy expedient.&#xD;
If he had possessed the same aptitude for his studies&#xD;
that he did for sport and pleasure, Falkher would never&#xD;
have supplanted him in the estimation of the dominie.&#xD;
The principal' object that Corie had in view on that&#xD;
morning was to rid himself of the presence of his&#xD;
teacher,'for whom he entertained no good will.  He&#xD;
&#xD;
ROCKFORD&#xD;
urged the pony into a canter--the submissive quad-&#xD;
ruped obeyed. He pressed him to' the utmost extent of&#xD;
his speed-still the pony made no resistance. -For two&#xD;
miles the caprices of the boy vexed, and tortured. the&#xD;
pony from the most tardy to the swiftest gait.&#xD;
When Corolan had spent as much time at the office&#xD;
as he desired, in playing marbles and ball with his ac-&#xD;
quaintances, he.applied for and received his father's&#xD;
mail, and started towards home. When he had accom-&#xD;
plished about one-half of the distance 'between the office&#xD;
and his father's house, he endeavored to urge the pant-&#xD;
ing pony into a full speed ; but the reluctant beast-&#xD;
tired out with cruel treatment from his young master-&#xD;
became restive and threw him upon the roadside.&#xD;
When dominie Heflin and Falkner' approached the&#xD;
spot where the unconscious boy lay, they were rejoiced&#xD;
to discover that he was not dead. Mr. Manning arrived&#xD;
soon with the family physician, whomf he had happily&#xD;
encountered on the road. Corolan was much bruised&#xD;
and stunned by the fall, but it was uncertain as .to the&#xD;
extent of the injury. It was certain that he was seri-&#xD;
ously, if not fatally injured. , He was speedily conveyed&#xD;
homeland placed in his bed. Falkner could not be pre-&#xD;
vailed upon to leave the bed-side of his brother; and&#xD;
the mother--after the first shock had passed--remained&#xD;
by the unconscious Corolan as.a ministering angel..&#xD;
For several days and nights Corie suffered 'immensely,&#xD;
yet he seemed perfectly unconscious of what was pass-&#xD;
ing around him. If he spoke,, it was to warn his schopl-&#xD;
mates from trespassing uponliis rights. .'It was evident&#xD;

thatfrom a se'e-e shock which the brain had received,&#xD;
that sensitive organ had suffered seriously. The physi-&#xD;
cian informed the parents that, with proper' treatment,&#xD;
their son might' recover in tlhe course of a few weeks.&#xD;
Falkner endeared himself, still more to the parents by&#xD;
his unremitting attentions to Cone. If cold cloths were&#xD;
to be applied to the head' of his brother, his willing&#xD;
hinds performed the task. He would sit for hours and&#xD;
fan the fevered ,brow of his brother, and shed tears of&#xD;
sorrow' at poor Corie's misfortune.  .&#xD;
Tfl he was overcome with fatigue and constant vigils,&#xD;
he could not beprevailed upon to- leave the room, but&#xD;

Blessed"Falkner! why should the dreams or the reali-&#xD;
ties of life ever disturb 'the repose of 'one. so pure as&#xD;
thou"Wert? .&#xD;
One night .when Corie had revived, and there was a&#xD;
change in his condition for the bettat, Falkner-who&#xD;
had not left the room during the entire day-extended&#xD;
himself' upon the couch and slept. At.first he scarcely&#xD;
moved;-,but soon 'he became troubled as one in a fright-&#xD;
fal dream.w Let us relate his' dream, as told'to his fath-&#xD;
er thie next day:&#xD;
He dreamed that he was   bahild, quite young. He&#xD;
dwelt =in a far-off clime. His father and mother were&#xD;
so fond of hin that' they would scarcely permit him to&#xD;
leae their presence.' He dwelt with them in a T1hrge,&#xD;
fine house--so unlike the one he had lived in so .1ng.&#xD;
Alhe' furniture was of the most costly kind. He was&#xD;
reminded of some' scenes in' the "Arabian Nights "-&#xD;

ofr reality. .He dreamed that he was the owner of a&#xD;
large og and a small canine pet, with 'which his hours&#xD;
were spent in much glee. "The scene changed. He'was&#xD;
sailing upon what appeared toihim a broad river, with&#xD;
his father' and mother. As the' boat cut the rolling&#xD;
waves andthe breeze fanned his infantile cheeks, he ex-&#xD;
perienced sensations 'of pleasure. The scene changed&#xD;
again. He was playing beside the shore of that broad&#xD;
river with his nurse. Some fierce looking men landed&#xD;
close beside him.' They seized him,. struggling in the&#xD;
embraces of the nurse, and bore 'him off. So great was&#xD;
the struggle in his bosom,' that he awoke, exclaiming,&#xD;
Saveme, father! oh! where is my mother ?"&#xD;
Mr. Manning rushed td the 'couch, and raised the boy&#xD;
up and observed that he was .as pale as marble.".&#xD;
"Oh! father, where am I?" exclaimed Falkner, "I&#xD;
have had such a horrid dream."'.'&#xD;
" Pray relate it, 'son," said the father, "I am troubled&#xD;
to see you in such agony."&#xD;
"Oh'! I shudder to think of it. I cannot tell you&#xD;
now. Oh! father, tell me, am I not your son'? At&#xD;
times, 'of late, I have heard you speak words whose mean.&#xD;
ing I have been. at a loss to divine."&#xD;
"Falkner, I' should be a miserable man indeed, did I&#xD;
not esteem you more than a .son. Come to this bosom,&#xD;
darling of. my soul! -Sleep, Falkner, go to your bed;.&#xD;

afew days Corse was so much better that he was&#xD;
en  idtto walk out.upon the lawn ,supported by the&#xD;
strong armofdhis brother  Falkner was perfectly de-&#xD;
lighted to see the great improvement in the condition of&#xD;
his brother.&#xD;
Day byt day. health and strength returnedtoe Corie,&#xD;
and by the- time vacation was at an end, the brothers&#xD;
were tired of sport,, and joyfully resumed their ,studies&#xD;
under the; astute supervision of the wise dominie Heflin.&#xD;
Two years passed away, and still the. brothers were&#xD;
at school  alkner was now.prepared for college. He&#xD;
was tall,,nuscular and active. His face was almost&#xD;
efferginately beautiful, while his dark, auburn hair rest-&#xD;
edin  m  ny a curl upon his shoulders. His soft, blue&#xD;
eye gave tokens of a greater degree of intelligence than&#xD;
is usually possessed by boys of his age.&#xD;
Corie had not improved much in books, but he had&#xD;
grown rapidly. his disposition had -slightly changed&#xD;

CHAPTER         XVII.&#xD;
IF we are particular at all times to respect the opin-&#xD;
ions of our friends, we Will not be obliged to make use-&#xD;
less, apologies. The.ancient philosophers supposed that&#xD;
next to wisdom, silence was the most commendable of&#xD;
virtues. If it were possible for our friends to remain&#xD;
silent and let our own actions speak for us, we might&#xD;
often be relieved of a world of trouble. Those who&#xD;
seek after popular favor are too often extolled to the&#xD;
skies by senseless wights whose opinions are worth not&#xD;
a sous, while the meritorious remain in oparative ob-&#xD;
scurity. It was thus the case with poor dominie Hefl i,&#xD;
who had more talent than one in a thousand of those&#xD;
good men who are devoting their time and talents to&#xD;
the education of youth. He had remained in the back-&#xD;
ground so long that it seemed as second nature to him&#xD;
to court obscurity. If 'he had been puffed by-the press,&#xD;
as some are now-adaf who have. not the scintilla of merit,&#xD;
it might have destroyed his usefulness. 'Besides being&#xD;
a very fine scholar, and a teacher' whose merit  was at&#xD;
least appreciated by those who were directly interested,&#xD;
he could survey land, draw up deeds; transcribe ac-&#xD;
counts, and, upon a pinch, write wills.&#xD;
If the good'dominie was not reaping the rich rear&#xD;
of his merits in this world, he' Was laying up his treasury&#xD;

in Hearen.-.where neither moth nor rust Zan corrupt-&#xD;
where thieves do not break through and steal. 'He&#xD;
had surely performed his duty in teaching Falkner and&#xD;
Cone. If the first-named had gained much by his wise&#xD;
instructions, the, second at least remembered some. of&#xD;
the wise tenets.&#xD;
We said that the boys were rgearly upon the point, of&#xD;
leavingfor the. University. Several days were wanting,&#xD;
to 'fillup thre' space ere the day appointed for their de-&#xD;
parture woulplarrive. The events of an hour oi- of a&#xD;
day maydecide the fate of an empire, or may raise o-&#xD;
lower a man who isstruggling.for supremacy.&#xD;
One evening while the 'family'were seated at the sup-&#xD;
per-table,. one of the 'servants came hastily into the&#xD;
hQ'Use, and stated that a man had been found in a faint-&#xD;
inig 'condition not far from the front gate. It was sup-&#xD;
posed by the servants that he had been thrown from his&#xD;
horse, as his traveling sack had been found not far&#xD;
from where he lay; and it was not at all probable that&#xD;
a man so well cladas the unfortunate, 'would be found&#xD;
performing his journeyson foot.&#xD;
Mr. Marping and his sons left the table in, haste,,to&#xD;
go to the relief of the map  They were followed by&#xD;
the good domine, who happened to be spending the eve-&#xD;
ning with the boysjust upon the eve of-their departure.&#xD;
,FMkner being the swiftest of:the party; arrived first&#xD;
at the place where the wounded man'; lay. He raised.&#xD;
his head from the ground and discovered that the blood&#xD;
wa,  issuing from .a awund whichhad doubtless been&#xD;
caused by his head coming:in contact with a hard sub-&#xD;

stance upon the toad-side. The man was evidently too&#xD;
weak to 'hold conversation with the party, and was im-&#xD;
mediately taken to the house.&#xD;
.Falkner was forthwith dispatchedsfor the family phy-&#xD;
sician, who resided but a short distance from the ho me-&#xD;
stead. While he was absent, the stranger was divested&#xD;
of his apparel, and placed in a comfortable bed. Mr.&#xD;
Manning had. some experience in the treatment of&#xD;
wounds and the management of invalids. The expert-&#xD;
ness of the good dominie in staunching the'blood and&#xD;
applying bandages to the head of the unconscious man,&#xD;
proved that 'he was equal to any emergency.&#xD;
"What a finely formed man this is, friend. Manning,"&#xD;
said the classical dominie. ' "'His hair, though partial&#xD;
'ly gray, has the  appearance of having been of a beau-&#xD;
tiful black color. Look at his handsome features. Old'&#xD;
age has 'not made this havoc; grief or dissipation has&#xD;
taken time by the forelock."&#xD;
"True, dominie," said the good man," circumstances,&#xD;
at times, hasten the flight of old age. . .Have you not&#xD;
read of men who have grow gray in.one night ?"&#xD;
"I' have, but those instances 'are rare. I read of a&#xD;
man whose 'occupation was that' of 'gathering the eggs&#xD;
of birds which build their nests in the clefts of rocks&#xD;
upon the sides of mountains and yawning precipices.&#xD;
They were compelled 'at'-times to. obtain the objet -of&#xD;
their pursuit by perilous adventures. - The father of the&#xD;
boys, upon one 'opcasion, was 'lowered several :hundred&#xD;
feet' by a 'rope, in order that he might obtain the eggs&#xD;
of numerous birds. He had despoiled the nestsof many&#xD;

of their treasures, not neglecting to break in upon the&#xD;
sanctity of the great of an eagle. the signal. had been&#xD;
give for his sons to' draw him up. He- was gradually.&#xD;
rising to the top of the steep precipice, when the mother&#xD;
eagle/attacked him with all the fury- of her bellicose&#xD;
nature.  Drawing a ,hunting knife which he wore,&#xD;
concealed in a sheath, he dispatched the bird, but&#xD;
in so doing,-he almost severed; the cord by which he&#xD;
swung. It .is. said that'he was perfectly, gray when he&#xD;
was taken, fainting, from the noose in -the rope, by&#xD;
his sons.'&#xD;
Just at this moment Falkner entered the room, follow-&#xD;
ed by Doctor Gillis. A description of this singular in-&#xD;
dividualmay not be out of place. He, was a man just&#xD;
above the medium height, rather thickly set. Judging&#xD;
from the wrinkles that illustrated his swarthy face, he&#xD;
might have been on ;the shady side of forty... His.eyes&#xD;
were of a yellowish gray, and his head was nearly bald.&#xD;
His sandy whiskers were sprinkled with many gray ones.&#xD;
His clothes were cut after the most approved, style,&#xD;
but his awkward gait and -rustic air plainly indicated&#xD;
that he had not been used to fine apparel. He had evi-&#xD;
dently learned all his manners from observation. -&#xD;
"Good evening,. Col.' Manning," said the doctor.&#xD;
"Your obedient servant,, professor Heflin" .Here the&#xD;
doctor raised his gold-headed cane full in, view of tthe&#xD;
company, and handing it and his hat, to Cone, desired&#xD;
him to place them in one of the outer rooms. Pulling&#xD;
of ;his kid' gloves, and taking a pinch of snuff from.his&#xD;
silversnuff-box, 'this disciple' of' iEsculapius was pre-&#xD;
vailed upon to take a seat.&#xD;

ROCEFORD-.&#xD;

&#xD;
"Whom have we here, Col. Manning, that needs&#xD;
niedical aid?  Have you learned the circumstances by&#xD;
which he came to this accident?  Have hid wounds bled&#xD;
profusely ?  Do his pains seem to be acute ? "&#xD;
"It is difficult to answer all your queries at once,&#xD;
doctor ; please examine him,, and apply what remedies&#xD;
you can.&#xD;
"But, 901. Manning," said the doctor, "it is entirely&#xD;
necessary to ask all these questions before we can diag-&#xD;
nose a  ase. If ZEsculapius himself, ,were present-&#xD;
with all he remedies known to the healing art, or if I&#xD;
possessed all the healing herbs known to the .wise an-&#xD;
cients-nothing could be done for a patient without a&#xD;
proper knowledge 'of his disease. You are aware, also,&#xD;
Colonel, that the ancients were ignorant as to the' use&#xD;
of 'the lancet." It was never thought the blood circu-&#xD;
lated, until Harvey demonstrated it conclusively to&#xD;
King Charles the 'First. When our class graduated,&#xD;
Colonel, in. the city of Philadelphia, just twenty years&#xD;

"Do, if you please," interposed the Colonel, "go to&#xD;

do not desi to have a lecture, upon Anatomy, ,Pathol-&#xD;
ogy or Surg ry.'. You have told me all of those things&#xD;
more than one hundred times."&#xD;
." Sir," said the doctor, much offended, "the-fraternity&#xD;
of which I am a member should have', some deference&#xD;
shown them. D9. you suppose. we burn the ' midnight&#xD;
lamp in vain?  Do you consider the researches we&#xD;

*'r."beg pardongdotor, said Mr.,Minning, "but I do&#xD;
not see why yon.sEould ,male*so much delay. Be kind&#xD;
enough to step to the bed-side and examine the patient.'&#xD;
The doctor beinthus importuned, and having car-&#xD;
riedins1 point--winchwas to make a display of his&#xD;
learning before the dominie--went to the bed-side of&#xD;
-  the wounded man and felt of his pulse, which he re-&#xD;
ported as indicating much fever.&#xD;
"Please requestMrs. Manning to send me some do-&#xD;
mestic goodsfor bandages, a plate, knife and spoon.&#xD;
and.some warm water."&#xD;
When those things were brought, the invincible knight&#xD;
of the pilbboxidivested himself of his coat, rolled up&#xD;
his sleeves, and made awful preparations for a 'display'&#xD;
of medical skill. A small side-table was placed before&#xD;
him, and his saddle-bags were. brought in by the ever-&#xD;
attentive Falkner.&#xD;
"Now, Cone,?' said the 'doctor, "bring me ,a small&#xD;
quantity of treacle."&#xD;
"A snall quantity of what? " said the boy.&#xD;
"Treacle, my lad; -do you not know what treacle is?"&#xD;
"I do not, sir," said the boy, "perhaps brother Falk-&#xD;
ner kiows, he is about 'to'-leave for College.".&#xD;
"It is molass$, brother," said Falkner, "you are so&#xD;
fond of it and do' not know the several names under&#xD;
which it'is known!"                        .&#xD;
If folks mould use fewer big words and more plain&#xD;
English, -said' he boy, "we, 'would: have less, use for&#xD;
wise-doctors and learned teachers."&#xD;
&#xD;
ROCKFORD.&#xD;

&#xD;
The doctor called for twenty things in a few minutes.&#xD;
Falkner and Cone were heartily tired of running to&#xD;
their mother for lint, pins, salve, thread, flarnel, sugar&#xD;
and milk.&#xD;
Mr. Manning and the dominie were afraid to open&#xD;
their mouths, dreading that the descendant of the god&#xD;
of the healing art would launch off into learned disqui-&#xD;
sitions upon Epilepsy, Catalepsy, or Hydrophobia.-&#xD;
Dr. Gillis thrust his pen-knife into a dozen vials, and&#xD;
extracted from each a small quantity' of powder. In&#xD;
a very mysterious manner--known only to medical&#xD;
men-he mixed up a small compound, (thanks to the&#xD;
all-absorbing treacle;) having rolled it out to the proper&#xD;
length, he cut the compound into a dozen fearfully ook-&#xD;
ing slugs, which were hastily formed into globules. An&#xD;
eye-witness would have pronounced them PILLS.&#xD;
Oh! gentle reader, if you have the same horror of&#xD;
PIaS that we have, the very sight of a little round box&#xD;
with red sides, blue top and white bottom, will disturb&#xD;
your nerves.&#xD;
The doctor looked up with a self-satisfied air, as much&#xD;
as to say, what a wonderful thing is the science of Phar-&#xD;
macy. He next mixed up several vial-fulls of mysteri-&#xD;
ous liquids.&#xD;
"Now, friend Manning," said the man of science,&#xD;
"let us examine the wounds of the stranger."&#xD;
"With pleasure," said the host, whose 'patience had&#xD;
long since grown threadbare.  We should have done&#xD;
that at first, but doctors must have their way."&#xD;

had applied were removed, andthe wound was ,washed&#xD;
and properly dressed. When the doctor left, the patient&#xD;

whose cruel hands have been imbrued in the blood of&#xD;
innocent victims, has slept soundly on4the night pre-&#xD;
vious to his execution.&#xD;
1Ill health,. 'a hearty supper, the want of exercise, and&#xD;
irregular habits; will banish sleep from the eyelids of&#xD;
us all,, whether we have good or evil consciences.&#xD;
The stranger, whom chance had cast as an inmate in&#xD;
the house of Mr. Manning so unexpectedly to the mem-&#xD;
bers of the household, slept soundly- and sweetly-&#xD;
(thanks to the good quality of the, medicinal potations&#xD;
left in charge of. the dominie and the tender-hearted&#xD;
Falkner.). The dominie, whose thirty years' occupation&#xD;
as teacher had taught him to sleep in his chair in an&#xD;
upright position, when the hour at which he usually re-&#xD;
tired arrived, could not keep himself awake. He placed&#xD;
his hands over his eyes as if endeavoring to induce the&#xD;
belief that he was in a state 'of meditation. Falkner&#xD;
was-too well acquainted with his habits to believe that&#xD;
the good dominie was awake, when every signal he made&#xD;
was an indication that he was in the quiet retreat .of&#xD;
Morpheus.&#xD;
When the boy was warned by the significant strokes&#xD;
of, the. clock, that the hour had approached for the&#xD;
stranger, to 'take his medicine, the good 'dominie was&#xD;
easily aroused from his meditative slumbers by a gentle&#xD;
touch.&#xD;
"Carissime puer, dormiebam," would be the only ex-&#xD;
lamation the sage would be heard to. utter. He would&#xD;
rouse himself from his slumbers and exert all his efforts&#xD;
toyassist 'the boy in performing the goodly' task of ad-&#xD;
ministering the medicine of the renowned Gillis.&#xD;

What a' strange picture was there presented to an ob-&#xD;
server! Old age, with all the respect that is due it,&#xD;
was represented in the person of dominie Heflin. Mid-&#xD;
dle age, or the prime of life, was truly impersonated in&#xD;
the character of the unknown, who lay stretched upon&#xD;
the bed of affliction. Everything that is concentrated in&#xD;
youth, hope and happiness, was impersonified in the&#xD;
person of the gifted youth, who sat by the bed-side of&#xD;
the sick man.&#xD;
Falkner had arrived at the period of life when his&#xD;
mind had commenced expanding. He had.read most&#xD;
of the works of the authors whose instructions are&#xD;
sought after. He longed to mingle with those whose&#xD;
path led to the temple of Fame. The instructions he&#xD;
had recieved from his teacher and from his dear father,&#xD;
were of such a character that he was not enabled -to&#xD;
pause or linger by the wayside.&#xD;
The good dominie slept, because it was his nature to&#xD;
do so. He could not have maintained the. wakefulness&#xD;
of the watchful Falkner, because he had arrived at the&#xD;
period of life when age must succumb to the force of&#xD;
circumstances.&#xD;
The map of life was spread out before our hero, with&#xD;
all its phases of good and evil. He thought it within&#xD;
his power to choose between the two extremes. Still&#xD;
there was an incubus which weighed upon his mind.--&#xD;
He had been early taught to consider that every man&#xD;
held his happiness in his own hands. If chance should&#xD;
cast the weight of the balances in his favor, it seemed&#xD;
as if Fate were upon his side ; but' might it not be mor-&#xD;

ally true that the affairs of men are not entirely di&#xD;
rested by chance ?&#xD;
The dominie slept as sweetly as ever he did in the&#xD;
halls of academus, Falkner smiled to see how the&#xD;
good man endeavored to make it appear that he was only&#xD;
in a meditative mood.&#xD;
Falkner had arrived at that interesting period of life&#xD;
when the mind is most active and the intellect is not&#xD;
allowed to slumber,. It was not his intention to remain&#xD;
idle while there remained a chance for him to improve&#xD;
his mind or to render himself useful to his fellow man.&#xD;
Even whilst he watched by the bed of the unfortunate&#xD;
man, he held a useful volume in his hands.&#xD;
When the sick mad was restless, the good boy was 'by&#xD;
his side in an instant to attend to his wants. The&#xD;
cooling., drink was handed him by the attentive boy,&#xD;
while the aged dominie slumbered in his easy chair.&#xD;
The cold cloths were' applied to the brow of the sick&#xD;
man by the same tender hands ; and when day dawned&#xD;
the vigilant boy was relieved from his watchful post by&#xD;
Mr. Manning.&#xD;
It is not'exactly certain how long the good teacher&#xD;
would have slumbered, had not the golden rays of the&#xD;
morning sun aroused the erudite sage from his dreams.&#xD;
When he rubbed his eyes, and observed that Falkner&#xD;
was not present, he expressed some surprise; but the&#xD;
good dominiee soon reflected that if there was any vir-&#xD;
tue attendant upon the vigils of the past night, himself&#xD;
would share but little of it.-&#xD;
Mr. Manning had learned from his beloved boy that&#xD;
&#xD;
the medicine had been regularly administered, to the&#xD;
patient, (thanks to the watchfulness of Falkner.) But&#xD;
in order to cater to the vanity of the old teacher, Mr.&#xD;
Manning could not refrain from passing some compli-&#xD;
ments upon his good offices to the invalid.&#xD;
When the dominie sought his-home on that morning&#xD;
after breakfast, the astute Corolan ventured the remark&#xD;
that the.teacher had imposed upon the goodness of his&#xD;
brother Falkner. He knew that it was a matter of im-&#xD;
possibility for the teacher to maintain his watchfulness&#xD;
even by day. If the sick man had received any atten-&#xD;
tions at all, it was certain that dominie Heflin had not&#xD;
been a voluntary agent in rendering them.&#xD;
The horse of the invalid had' been arrested not far&#xD;
from the house by one of the servants. It was a mat-&#xD;
ter of conjecture as to the social standing of the un-&#xD;
known; yet, there would be time enough for the host to&#xD;
make all necessary enquiries when the convalescence of&#xD;
the guest would render it expedient.&#xD;
In a very few days the stanger had improved so rap-&#xD;
idly, that it was no longer necessary for him to remain&#xD;
in bed. He was a man of great intelligence, and was&#xD;
competent to interest his youthful acquaintances who&#xD;
sought his company. Corie was as much delighted at&#xD;
his anecdotes as Falkner was interested in his descrip-&#xD;
tions of his extensive travels.&#xD;
;Day by day the invalid's health improved ; still'Falk-&#xD;
ner was his constant companion. One evening, when&#xD;
they were walking in the grove in front of the house,&#xD;
the following conversation passed between then:&#xD;

,You ,say that you are about fifteen years of age,&#xD;
4alkner, and have resided at this place from your in-&#xD;
fancy. Have you no recollections of having dwelt at&#xD;
another home ? "&#xD;
1 Iam at a loss to comprehend the nature of your&#xD;
enquiry," said the boy, "m1y father has been one.of the&#xD;
most indulgent of parents, whose love to me has been&#xD;
unbounded. Pray tell me why you have propounded&#xD;
the question ? "&#xD;
"I cannot tell you. now, Falkner," said the stranger,&#xD;
"we often propound questions which have but little orf&#xD;
no relevancy to the.subject of conversation, yet subse-&#xD;
quent events. may bring obscure points to light."&#xD;
"You distress me, sir," said the boy, grasping his&#xD;
companion by the arm, "pray do not tantalize me with&#xD;
wanton insinuations. If you know anything of my&#xD;
early history, of which I am totally ignorant, in the&#xD;
name of God,. relieve my anxiety., I am prepared to&#xD;
listen to any revelation, however disagreable it may be."&#xD;
"Falkner," said the stranger, whose dark eyes~eam-&#xD;
ed with a melancholy pleasure, as they. rested upon the&#xD;
boy, "there are some revelations we cannot make except&#xD;
at the proper time. Do not allow what I have said to&#xD;
distress you. . It is true, you may think it unkind in.me&#xD;
to withhold from you. that which it might be imprudent&#xD;
in me to reveal. You see before you a stranger whom&#xD;
yor unremitting attentions during his illness,. have&#xD;
greatly endeared to you. Promise me faithfully that&#xD;
you will reveal no, part of this conversation to your fath-&#xD;
er, or to any other person."&#xD;
&#xD;
ROCKFORD.          1X69&#xD;
&#xD;
"If there is any truth in your insinuations, I can see&#xD;
no impropriety in asking my father for a full explana-&#xD;
tion upon every point relative to myself."&#xD;
"Believe me, my young friend," resumed the stranger,&#xD;
"it is better for you to make me the promise I request.&#xD;
You are young yet, and do not know the ways of the&#xD;
world. I would iot fill thy young mind with sorrow&#xD;
for the wealth of Croesus. Do you see that star which&#xD;
the paling rays of the setting sun have 'given to our&#xD;
sight ? Whilst the great lamp of day illumined the&#xD;
world, the inferior planets held no sway, yet the rays&#xD;
of that star have not been less brilliant. But see, as&#xD;
the sun hides his head behind the horizon, and the soft,&#xD;
mellow tints of the twilight.are shed around us, each&#xD;
one of the-small planets come out and sparkle with crys-&#xD;
taline delight. Everything has been made by God for&#xD;
some wise purpose. We cannot foresee our own desti-&#xD;
nies ; yet it is better for us to bide our time. Will you&#xD;
promise me not to relate what has occurred between us&#xD;
this evening ?"&#xD;
"It is strange that you should make such a request,&#xD;
my dear friend," said Falkner, "and I am at a great loss&#xD;
to comprehend you; still, if it is your desire-rand&#xD;
doubtless you have your reasons-I will conceal my sus-&#xD;
picions in my bosom."&#xD;
''Noble boy," said the stranger, "take this, and wear&#xD;
it for my sake ; it may, at some time act as an amulet&#xD;
to you.&#xD;
Falkner received a beautiful gold chain, to which was&#xD;
attached a medal. The letters "C. R." were engraved&#xD;

A FEW days subsequent to the one&#xD;

the latter departed from the hospitable ma&#xD;
Manning. He placed a letter in the hands&#xD;

should remain unbroken for the space of&#xD;

thrown the father and son together? He&#xD;

"I wonder why that black imp does not bring out the&#xD;
carriage," said Corolan, "here' we have been waiting&#xD;
more than an hour. Master Falkner. will cry his eyes&#xD;
out at parting with papa, if we do not hasten away from&#xD;
this place. Falkner, stay here with papa, and learn to&#xD;
be a farmer. You are already farther advanced in book&#xD;
learning than I ever expect to be, yetI am anxious to&#xD;
travel some."&#xD;
"You must try and exercise more patience, my dear&#xD;
boy," said his father. "I have' ordered the driver to&#xD;
wash the-carriage and grease the wheels carefully. If&#xD;
you had as much love for your father as your brother&#xD;
exhibits upon all occasions, my cup of bliss would be&#xD;
full."&#xD;
"Ah !.father, you think I do not love you because I&#xD;
am too shame-faced to hug and kiss you and follow you&#xD;
up, as brother Falkner does. It is, asYmuch as I can&#xD;
do to let mother devour me with a'thousand kisses.each&#xD;
day."&#xD;
"Promise me, Corie," said his mother, "that you&#xD;
will be a good boy, and listen to the advice of your&#xD;
brother. He, loves'you more tenderly than you do him.&#xD;
Oh! Corie, learn to imitate his good example and stu-&#xD;
dious habits, and you will gladden the heart of your&#xD;
mother."&#xD;
" I see the driver is coming with the carriage," said&#xD;
the father. "Here is your purse, Falkner; you will find&#xD;
in it enough money to, pay your college bills for one&#xD;
year. You must give Corie some pocket-change as he&#xD;
requires it ; but I need not advise you to be economical.&#xD;
&#xD;
Good-bye, my sons.; write to me as soon as you get to&#xD;
the University."&#xD;
The mother kissed the boys and shed many tears at&#xD;
their departure. Corie vould have given birth to a few&#xD;
tears himself, but he had none to shed. As the carriage&#xD;
moved off, he thrust his head from the window and re-&#xD;
quested his father not to let black Dick ride his pony&#xD;
too hard. He wanted his fishing-poles kept in their&#xD;
proper place in the carriage house. Falkner was too&#xD;
sad to enjoy the rattling conversation of Corie. He&#xD;
was leaving his father, whom he almost worshipped.&#xD;
"Come, brother, dry up those tears ; you cannot ex-&#xD;
pect to be with papa always. He has placed me in your&#xD;
charge, but if you are to cry after this style, I shall&#xD;
think that you are not a safe guardian.&#xD;
"Oh ! Corie, you are so unkind. Have you no ten-&#xD;
derness in your nature ? You parted with father and&#xD;
mother as carelessly as if you expected to be gone but&#xD;
a few days."&#xD;
"Master Falkner, you may yet learn some valuable&#xD;
lessons from me. Ido not care much for books, and I&#xD;
thank my stars that I have but little of the girl's na-&#xD;
ture. You will pore upon the pages of a dry book as&#xD;
if your life depended upon your learning its musty con-&#xD;
tents. You have spent enough time in drawing and&#xD;
painting to have made you an adept in each branch of&#xD;
the art. Do you suppose that papa is a-going to let you&#xD;
set up as a painter'or drawing master?"&#xD;
"You wrong painters and drawing masters, brother&#xD;
Conic, if you intend to cast a slur -upon their professions.&#xD;

If I thought I could arrive at distinction as an artist,&#xD;
*and father should happen to lose his fortune, I do not&#xD;
suppose there would be any impropriety in my 'setting&#xD;
up' as a painter."&#xD;
"You misapprehend me, master Falkner; it is not&#xD;
my intention.to wrong any man wilfully. I should feel&#xD;
very sorry indeed to see you laboring in a close room&#xD;
with the brush and pencil- As for me, I love the sun-&#xD;
shine and the cold, piercing winds., I am not disposed&#xD;
to addle my brains by hard study. I care more for my&#xD;
dogs, and gun, and fishing tackle, than for the knowl-&#xD;
edge that is contained in all the books in the world."&#xD;
"It seems, Corie, that you. are perfectly regardless&#xD;
of 'the wishes of father and mother. They desire to&#xD;
see you a studious boy. Why do you act so?  You can&#xD;
learn anything if you will only apply your mind to the&#xD;
task. I shall be very much displeased with your con-&#xD;
duct if you prove as inattentive to the instructions of&#xD;
the teachers of the preparatory school as you have been&#xD;
heretofore."&#xD;
"'Why do you.wish to force me to study hard books&#xD;
against my will? Do-you ever expect to derive much&#xD;
benefit from your incessant labor in translating Latin&#xD;
and Greek? .I can read and write tolerably well, and&#xD;
with a few extra accomplishments, which I hope to gath-&#xD;

until towards night, and the lads had ample time to take&#xD;
a stroll through the town. Falkner endeavored to point&#xD;
out the objects of interest to his brother, who was per-&#xD;
fectly delighted with everything he saw. How happy,&#xD;
thought Corie, must they be who dwell in this beautiful&#xD;
place !&#xD;
"Look, brother Falkner, at that church yonder !&#xD;
what is the use of that small house upon the top of it,&#xD;
which runs up to so sharp a point ? We have no such&#xD;
churches in our old dull neighborhood. We are only&#xD;
twenty miles from home, yet father has never ;thought&#xD;
proper to let us come here before. If I do not improve&#xD;
my time and see some strange sights before I return&#xD;
home, then you may call me a dull boy."&#xD;
"Look out, Cone," said Falkner, "those horses will&#xD;
tramp you under their feet. You must not stand ga-&#xD;
ing idly at one object so long, or .folks will "think that&#xD;
you have never seen a town before."&#xD;
"People will think 'entirely right, brother, for we&#xD;
have been kept at home like close prisoners. Look at&#xD;
those beautiful chains in the window of that watch-&#xD;
maker's shop. I see one almost exactly like the one&#xD;
Mr. Rodman gave you."&#xD;
"They are pretty indeed, Corie; if you will be eco-&#xD;
nomical, and not spend the money mother gave you, too&#xD;
lavishly, I will put by some of mine and we will pur-&#xD;
chase one for you."&#xD;
Every one that saw those interesting boys, was struck&#xD;
with the beauty' and manly bearing of the one, and the&#xD;
independent, but easy manners of the other. When they&#xD;

informed those who interrogated them that they were&#xD;
on their way to college, they were kindly assisted in&#xD;
purchasing their tickets. Corie was as much delighted&#xD;
at the idea of riding in the stage as Falkner was of&#xD;
knowing that he would soon be at the University,.where&#xD;
he could apply all his energies to the, acquisition of&#xD;
knowledge. The stage was crowded, but the boys ob-&#xD;
tainedasgood  ats as any of the passengers. Corie&#xD;
was very ta1kative ; but when the night was far advanc-&#xD;
ad; he stnetched himself upon the breast- of his brother&#xD;
and slept as sweetly as if he had been in his own bed.&#xD;
Th good boy extended a parental care over his&#xD;
brother. He held him fast in his arms to protect him&#xD;
from harm.&#xD;
Bless your soul!" murmured 'Falkner, "you have&#xD;
but little love for any person, but -for mother's sake I&#xD;
ill protect you with my life. You shall want for noth-&#xD;
ihgif it is in my power to assist you."&#xD;
The'attentions of the good boy did not escape the&#xD;
observation of the passengers. One- of them said to&#xD;
Falkner:&#xD;
"You fake great care of your brother, I see."&#xD;
"It is my duty," said the boy, "we are going to col-&#xD;
lege, and mother has entrusted him to my care. If any&#xD;
harm should befall him, I would be loth to see the face&#xD;
o     of mother again. He desired so much to come with me.&#xD;
that I consented to become whis protector."&#xD;
You are a noble youth," said the elderly man, who&#xD;
hadtaken quite a fancy .to Falkner. "I would give all&#xD;
the wealth I possess- if, I had a son like you. A long&#xD;

that my son was living ",----- .Here the grief of, the&#xD;
noble looking man--who was probably about fifty years&#xD;
of age -,choked up his utterance.&#xD;
"How unfortunate !" said Falkner. "I trust you may&#xD;
yet, recover your son. Have you no other children? "&#xD;
I have not, my lad, but.,we have adopted a daughter&#xD;
of one of our .deceased friends. She is beautiful and&#xD;
charming, but can the place of my son be filled-?  What&#xD;
is your name?"&#xD;
"Falkner Manning," said the boy. "My father&#xD;

The conversation, between Falkner and the stranger&#xD;
was very interesting and entertaining, especially to the&#xD;
latter, who, on parting with the boy, declared to a friend&#xD;
that he was the, most-interesting yotth he had ever seen.&#xD;
Falkner. and Crolan arrived at their destination in&#xD;
two days ,from the time they started from home. The&#xD;
good youth had been -so well prepared,(thanks to the&#xD;

culty in directing the attention of his brother to' his&#xD;
books. When he had arranged his room and been re-&#xD;
ceiv4d as a regular student of the University, he wrote&#xD;
the following letter to his father:                                               'CHAPTER       XX.&#xD;

"My dear and much beloved father: Br&#xD;

luxuries as your fatherly care allows me at home.-&#xD;
Gorie sometimes desires extra attention, but I have&#xD;
assured him that I would not consent to spend more&#xD;
money than is absolutely necessary ; therefore I have&#xD;
only engaged the services, together with the aid of sev-&#xD;
eral of the students, of one negro, whom the Faculty&#xD;
permit to wait upon the students.&#xD;
"I must give you a short description of my examina-&#xD;
tion. When I had presented myself for admission, the&#xD;
old professors, (bless their wise pates !)' ogled me through&#xD;
spectacles which seemed to possess the sense of seeing.&#xD;
I could scarcely withstand the gaze of the wise men -&#xD;
but I tried with ,my utmost powers to preserve my equa-&#xD;
nimity. How my timid heart throbbed when, in com-&#xD;
pany with forty boys, I was called upon to recite. My&#xD;
tongue became dry and silent. I could scarcely articu-&#xD;
late one word ; but, remembering your advice, I com-&#xD;
posed myself, and commenced reading one of the&#xD;
Eclogues of Virgil. I was even surprised at my own&#xD;
success, and when I sat down I perceived that the pro-&#xD;
ressor who was conducting the examination was pleased&#xD;
with my effort. I had but little difficulty in convincing&#xD;
each one of the Faculty that I was prepared for entry&#xD;
intothe Freshman class.&#xD;
"IL have some difficultyin keeping brother in our room&#xD;
at night ; yet I trust by entreaties and promises he may&#xD;
disappoint our expectations. Corie has some pride, and&#xD;
if I can operate upon that, I shall not despair of suc-&#xD;
deeding in arrestingthis attention and directing it to his&#xD;
boks.&#xD;
&#xD;
"I have engaged a gentleman who gives lessons in&#xD;
painting, to instruct me. I am heartily delighted with&#xD;
his tuition,.and trust that I may be enabled to paint your&#xD;
and mother's portraits when I come home in vacation.&#xD;
If you think the expense is unnecessary, the painter's&#xD;
instructions shall be instantly dispensed with.&#xD;
"Kiss mother a thousand times for me, and let her re-&#xD;
turn each salutation. Tell her that the beautiful ruffled&#xD;
shirts she made me are admired by all the students.-&#xD;
Corie has torn his new coat and almost spoiled his vest,&#xD;
yet I have hopes that he will quit his sportive tricks.&#xD;
"cGood night, dear father ; may angels guard you by&#xD;
day and night ; remember your Falkner always in your&#xD;
prayrs. Remember that you have ever a dutiful son&#xD;
in your                              FALKNER.'&#xD;
When Mr. Manning received the above letter from&#xD;
Falkner his eyes were filled with the tears of affection.&#xD;
How could he ever make the revelation to the boy that&#xD;
he knew must be made sooner or later ! If Corolan&#xD;
possessed one-half the talent that Falkner did, or if&#xD;
he was endowed with the same good disposition which&#xD;
rendered Falkner so amiable, then he might consent to&#xD;
tell Falkner that he was not the brother of Corolan.&#xD;
He believed that Falkner suspected that there was some&#xD;
obscurity about his birth, but he hoped that the boy&#xD;
would ever consider him as his own, dear parent.&#xD;
The letter which Rodman had left with such strict&#xD;
injunctions weighed heavily upon his mind. He desired&#xD;
to know the information those mystic p ages might res&#xD;

pledge not to break the seal until the five years had ex-&#xD;

Was he bound to keep his pledge with a man who&#xD;
was unknown to him-one who owed him the preserva-&#xD;
tion of his life?  Mr. Manning felt that it was wrong&#xD;
even to violate pledges given to an enemy, although the&#xD;
moral law would have borne him out in that. But he&#xD;
had pledged himself' not to break the seal of the letter&#xD;
for a specified time, and, come weal or woe, his word&#xD;
should be kept. He knew Falkner's confiding, yet in-&#xD;
dependent disposition, and almost shuddered at the&#xD;
consequences attendant upon the revelation. He was&#xD;
ignorant as to the parentage~ of the boy. He could&#xD;
never desert Falkner, but de half of his estate should&#xD;
be offered him! Would he accept it ?  That was the&#xD;
point that troubled Mr. Manning. Corolan was a gay&#xD;
boy, whose love or attachment for an individual was not&#xD;
orth a fig; yet, he was Mr. Manning's only child.&#xD;
He loved him because he was his son-he loved Falkner&#xD;
for himself alone.&#xD;

You will discover, my dear son, that the world abroad&#xD;
is quite different from what it is at home. In your sit-&#xD;
uation as student you will not be forced to contend with.&#xD;
the world except in miniature. When you shall have-&#xD;
grown older, and the leaden shadows of mature age-&#xD;
have thickened around you, then you may realize&#xD;
the responsibilities of'life. Beware of those who flat-&#xD;
ter you; they are often foes to you, rather than friends..&#xD;
They may seek to devour you with kind words and&#xD;
endearing phrases, yet their actions are like a sepulchre&#xD;
which, though white, smooth and ,beautiful without, is&#xD;
filled with dead men's bones. Above all things, shun&#xD;
the society of him who is devoid of integrity. The&#xD;
baneful-influence of such a one is more to' be dreaded&#xD;
than a contact with the Jpas tree. Truth is a lleav.-&#xD;
enly virtue which shines resplendent under all circum-&#xD;
stances ; like pure gold, the.,more it-, is burnished the&#xD;
brighter it will glisten. Truth dwells at the bottom,&#xD;
because the purest foundations are deepest. Truth is&#xD;
located in the middle of every circle, for the reason&#xD;
that it is equally distant from every arc.&#xD;

CHAPTER XXI.&#xD;
WE shall not attempt to relate the particulars of a&#xD;
boy's actions at college, as a narrative of that .kind&#xD;
is not interesting to the general reader, A few words&#xD;
upon college government may not be inappropriate.-&#xD;
One of the objections to sending boys to college, is&#xD;
that they learn bad habits. If no restraint is thrown&#xD;
around them by strict discipline, it is not to be supposed&#xD;
that a large number of boys and young men will remain&#xD;
long in any Institution without diverging from the path&#xD;
of rectitude. These that, are studious, modest and re-&#xD;
served may withstand the thousand and one tempta-&#xD;
tions wiich allure so many good youths from the paths&#xD;
of virtue, and plunge them into the depths of misery.&#xD;
What are familiarly known as college scrapes generally&#xD;
originate from a desire  on the part of a few headstrong&#xD;
boys to liave what they term "a little fun."  Sport,&#xD;
like disipatioxi, when tho freely indulged in, is a dan-&#xD;
gerous thing. The passions of boys, when once arous-&#xD;
ed, are more violent than those of men, and more difli-&#xD;
cult to allay. It is, generally the fault of discipline&#xD;
that renders disagreeable occurrences among students&#xD;
frequent. Moral suasion may do much in effecting a&#xD;
change towards amelioration, yet there are some boys&#xD;
whom the most stringently enforced rules often fail of&#xD;
&#xD;
bringing into subjection. It is a fact, that outrages upon&#xD;
buildings and the furniture are often perpetrated by&#xD;
students who are desirous of attesting their aversion to&#xD;
certain members of the Faculty, thus casting odium up-&#xD;
on every member of the college. Numbers of boys have&#xD;
been victimized by designing ring-leaders who had ob-&#xD;
jects of their own to accomplish. When once the dis-&#xD;
turbance ceases, the participants are generally penitent;&#xD;
yet, if harsh measures are used in enforcing the penal-&#xD;
ties of the violated law, the pride of the- students, in&#xD;
many instances, when arraigned before the Faculty for&#xD;
misdemeanors, will prevent them from making confes-&#xD;
sions or of pledging themselves to offend no more.-&#xD;
Would it not be better for the Faculty to use mild meas-&#xD;
ures in enforcing the laws, by appealing to the honor of&#xD;
the student? Let the laws be executed with firmness,&#xD;
impartiality and moderation, with an eye single to the&#xD;
welfare of the Institution, thus exhibiting a desire upon&#xD;
the part of the Faculty to act upon each case in the&#xD;
capacity of an unbiased tribunal, then there will be an&#xD;
alacrity upon the part of every 'student. to respect the&#xD;
laws.&#xD;
Frequent lectures by the President upon moral sub-&#xD;
jects, will tend, in an exceedingly great degree, to di-&#xD;
rect the mind of the student-to, that course of- training&#xD;
which will prepare him for usefulness and induce him to&#xD;
eschew the evil counsels of the wicked.&#xD;
It has been unwisely urged upon the Tiustees of&#xD;
Universities to construct their laws requiring the stun&#xD;

of the University as recitation halls alone. Young men&#xD;
will not submit to being placed under the surveillance&#xD;
of a professor or tutor; neither will the latter consent&#xD;
to play the part of a pedagogue or usher. Young men&#xD;
will have occasional frolics, and it is better for them to&#xD;
confine their REVELRIES within the sanctity (?). of their&#xD;
own rooms than: to invade the underground regions of&#xD;
a GIN COURT, imbibe the unhealthy potations of suspi-&#xD;

hangers-around, learn billingsgate phrases from idlers,&#xD;
get gentlemanly drunk, boisterous and warlike-and&#xD;
lastly, be conducted by the police .to a "LOcK-UP."&#xD;
In a word, it is as easy a task to conduct the affairs of&#xD;
a State as to govern one hundred and fifty young men,&#xD;

of choice "Old Otard," one hundred and fifty dulcineast&#xD;

hundred and fifty fathers, who are satisfied to let their&#xD;
dear sons have their own way. If the dear boys bring&#xD;
home a "SHEEP SKIN" at the end of four years,. (which&#xD;
they are unable to read) the delighted fathers feed as&#xD;
happy as so many presidents.&#xD;
Dear reader, isit not one hundred and fifty wonders&#xD;
that the Faculty, students and sheep-skins all get along&#xD;
as harmoniously as they do? -Bless all their dear souls,&#xD;
(not the sheep skins) let us pray for them and drop the&#xD;

We are decidedly in favor of colleges with all their im-&#xD;

Falkner and Corolan were sitting in their room one&#xD;
night soon after their' advent to the University of M -.&#xD;
The former was busily engaged in reading one of the&#xD;
Odes of Horace, while the latter was looking" at the&#xD;
pictures in a book which one of the boys;had lent him.&#xD;
"Come, brother," said Falkner, " do lay aside that&#xD;
ridiculous book and- let me teach you your lesson.&#xD;
Come, now, you remember what I promised you about&#xD;
the chain, do you not?"&#xD;
"Falkner," said the boy, "I do not think I shall ever&#xD;
be able to learn Latin. I see but. little sense in it;&#xD;
can you not prevail upon the teacher to let me skip it?"&#xD;
4You talk so strangely, Cone, that I am astonished&#xD;
at you. It is impossible for. you to enter College with-&#xD;
out a thorough knowledge of Latin and Greek."&#xD;
The boys were cut short in their conversation by a&#xD;
knock at the door.4 Corie opened it, and admitted about&#xD;
a dozen boys, who had come to pay the new-comers a&#xD;
visit. Falkner welcomed them to his room and -desired&#xD;
them to be seated.&#xD;
"Falkner Manning," said one of the party, "we are&#xD;
going to have a little 'burst up' to-night. You and&#xD;
your brother must be of the party, since you are stran-&#xD;
gers; besides, we have not initiated you into the mys-&#xD;
teries of college life yet."&#xD;
"You must excuse me, my friends,"-said Falkner; "I&#xD;
do not desire to go out to-night. I promised father that&#xD;

I would be studious, and not engage in any sports for-&#xD;
bidden by the laws of the University. I must prepare&#xD;
my lessons to-night, or my standing will not be high at&#xD;
recitatios to-morrow."&#xD;
"You talk as if you disdained our sport, Manning,"&#xD;
said the spokesman of the party; "we are riot used to&#xD;
having our mandates disobeyed. You will find it much&#xD;
to your advantage to come with us without compulsion."&#xD;
"With all due deference to your sports-of which I&#xD;
know nothing-please allow me to remain in my room&#xD;
with my brother, unmolested."&#xD;
"You both shall go with us," said several, Who ap-&#xD;
peared to become excited all at once.&#xD;
"You cannot and shall not force us," said the reso-&#xD;
lute boby.&#xD;
One of the boys took hold of Corolan, who was in for&#xD;
the sport, while several of them advanced towards&#xD;
Falkner to coerce him into submission. The latter&#xD;
pushed them aside, and rushed to rescue Corolan from&#xD;
the strong youth who was marching off with him.&#xD;
"Put down my brother, sir, or you shall feel my ven-&#xD;
geance," said Falkner.&#xD;
The command was not obeyed, and Falkner seized&#xD;
the boy, and before assistance could be offered by the&#xD;
astonished crowd, Corolan was rescued, and the boy&#xD;
whom Falkner had encountered, was hurled violently&#xD;
from the room into the street. The other boys were&#xD;
dreadfully enraged at the conduct of Falkner, and gath-&#xD;
ered around toconquer him. Falkner's blood was up,&#xD;
and he bade them stand off. One of the boldest ap-&#xD;

from his footing. A second and third shared the same&#xD;
fate. Falkner would have been overpowered in a short&#xD;
time had not some of the professors come to his assist-&#xD;
ance. The baffled students fled in all directions-some&#xD;
with slight bruises upon their heads and faces.&#xD;
When Falkner explained the cause of the disturbance&#xD;
to the professors, they were astonished at his prowess&#xD;
and determination to conform to the laws of the Uni-&#xD;
versity.&#xD;
The next day the "invaders" were arraigned before&#xD;
the Faculty for their misdemeanors and severely repri&#xD;
manded. Some of them would have been expelled or&#xD;
suspended, had not the good Falknir pleaded for them.&#xD;
The boys pronounced Falkner a noble fellow, and&#xD;
from that time he was regarded as a general favorite.&#xD;

CHAPTER         XXII.&#xD;
WE love to see modesty in a boy. It is an ennobling&#xD;
virtue which should, commend itself, 'at times, even to&#xD;
men. We are disposed to consider omselves free from&#xD;
this fault, simply for the reason that charity sometimes&#xD;
begins at home. Parents owe it to society to educate&#xD;
their children properly at home. Then we should have&#xD;
fewer self-constituted critics upon manners and fash-&#xD;
ions ; fewer masters of ceremonies at social parties, and&#xD;
fewer nonsensical debates in political meetings. Esquire&#xD;
Lighthead says to his son, "do not let any of them turn&#xD;
you down, my boy; hold up your head and be a man;&#xD;
tell folks that your father has fifty negroes-makes one&#xD;
hundred and fifty bales of cotton. Here is a dollar for&#xD;
you to buy whatever you please."  That parent is in-&#xD;
ducing precocity in his son, which may prepare him for&#xD;
misery. Teach a boy that he is upon an equal footing&#xD;
with his fellows,. and superior to none except for his&#xD;
moral worth--he is then prepared to commence the&#xD;
world aright. If a boy is not taught that it is wrong&#xD;
to'speak improperly, to men, especially to old ones, he&#xD;
will-grow up a man who will be compelled to learn po-&#xD;
liteness in the costly school of experience.,&#xD;
Mr. Manning had endeavored to perform his duty in&#xD;
this respect; still he had failed to observe the good&#xD;

effects of his precepts as applied to Corolan; but Falk-&#xD;
ner readily conformed to every requirement. If his&#xD;
father had not neglected the-sage counsels of Solo-&#xD;
mon, Corolan might have been a better scholar and more&#xD;
exemplary in his general deportment. If the Froward&#xD;
boy had been moderately chastised with a slender branch&#xD;
of an umbrageous beach tree, whe all persuasive argu-&#xD;
ments had been exhausted, it is do htful whether Falk-&#xD;
ner would have excelled him. Boys may be punished&#xD;
moderately without resorting- to cruel measures ; yet, if&#xD;
they cannot be conquered without it, give them the rod&#xD;
freely.&#xD;
"Corie, you have less modesty than any boy I have&#xD;
ever seen. Your teacher has already complained to me&#xD;
about your conduct. He says you are intolerably imper-&#xD;
tinent, and hard to control. If you do not change your&#xD;
course of conduct, I shall be reduced.to the painful ne-&#xD;
cessity of reporting you to father."&#xD;
"Brother Falker, I shall become angry with you if&#xD;
I am to be thus lectured by you. I do not care what&#xD;
the teacher says. I intend to do just as I please, .in&#xD;
spite of him and, you."&#xD;
"What I dislike mostly in your conduct is, that when&#xD;
any of the students call upon me, you speak to them so&#xD;
harshly that they are forced to withdraw-fearful of&#xD;
offending me by entering into a controversy with you.&#xD;
'Do not brag upon father's wealth; and hold yourselD up&#xD;
so stiffly; the wispr portion of the students will. laugh&#xD;
at you. Suppose we are rich, is that any reason, for&#xD;
yog to boast of it ? Now, brother, once for all, I shall&#xD;

not allow you to spend so much money. You want me&#xD;
tabuy a fine suit of clothes for you, because one of the&#xD;
bys has told you that you need them. Before I order&#xD;
ourWinter sits, I must write to father and get his ad-&#xD;
vice. Only yesterday you spent one dollar. for fruits,&#xD;
which you distributed among those noisy boys whom&#xD;
you bring in here to annoy me."&#xD;
9" Come, master monitor, if I may be allowed thus to&#xD;
salute your reverence," said Corie, who had much xit;&#xD;
"I am heartily tired of your sermons-or whatever you&#xD;
call them. I must have another suit.of clothes, as the&#xD;
last suit old rustic Threadneedle made for me do not&#xD;
fit"; besides, they are not exactly in the latest style.-&#xD;
I must let yowinto one of my secrets, brother, which&#xD;
your sense of honor will enjoin upon yob to keep. You&#xD;
remember, last Sabbath, we went to Church, rd do&#xD;
you remember seeing a pretty girl, who sax in the pew&#xD;
across the aisle from us? Well, she looked at me, and&#xD;
I looked at her, and we both looked at each other. I&#xD;
think she is smitten with-me, Falkner, and if I can&#xD;
make a conquest of her, your brother Corie may not&#xD;
have come to College in vain. I learn she is quite&#xD;
wealthy, and have been informed that she is anxious to&#xD;
see me."&#xD;
"Come, my.youthful Adonis," said ,Falkner, "you&#xD;
arethirteen years of age, and are making your arrange-&#xD;
melts to commence assuming the splhere of manhood.&#xD;
Why bless my soul! I expect you will imitate the ac-&#xD;
tions of King Richard the First and his brothers, who&#xD;
rebelled against their father, and tried to wrest the&#xD;
&#xD;
ROCKFORD.g&#xD;
sceptre from his hands, ere they had arrived at the age of&#xD;
puberty. If you have any notions of marrying this&#xD;
young lady this Winter, I hope you will not sell out&#xD;
father's land and negroes without consulting him. You&#xD;
may have my share in advance, if. you will only sell that&#xD;
and your portion."&#xD;
"You are almost too pure for this earth, brother,"&#xD;
said Core; "I fear I may wake up some morning and&#xD;
find that you have been translated to a better world.--&#xD;
You must not take your flight until I have learned more&#xD;
wise words from your lips, for I can assure you that I&#xD;
shall never be able to learn anything from books. rB-&#xD;
sides, I shall need your assistance in supplying myself&#xD;
with a. few phrases or set speeches to be used when I go&#xD;
out to see my dulcinea, as you and father would call&#xD;
her. Now, Falkner, if you will just consent to lend me&#xD;
your assistance, and write my love letters for me--be&#xD;
sure to put in some French words-I do not know but&#xD;
that I will give you the black pony and one of my lcie&#xD;
.fishing-poles."&#xD;
"Now, Corie, I have heard enough of your nonsense&#xD;
for one night. Just close upon your love affairs, ard&#xD;
apply yourself to your books. I never heard such norn&#xD;
sense as sometimes falls from your lips."&#xD;
"Very good, master Falkner, I will obey you this&#xD;
time ; but I shall resume the discussion of the subject&#xD;
on to-morrow evening at early candle-light."&#xD;
Falkner possessed more control over his brother than&#xD;
any other person, with the exception of his mother, and&#xD;
knew exactly how to appeal to his sense of pride He&#xD;

as exceedingly kind to him, and had never been-known&#xD;
tdstrike him. If he had anything in his pQssession&#xD;
which the boy wanted, he immediately resigned it to&#xD;
h1S hands.. What a marked difference was there in the&#xD;
deportment of 'Falkner, to Corolan, as compared with&#xD;
that of some older brothers. Love begets love, it is&#xD;
said, and there is nothing truer than that unkind inter-&#xD;
course between brothers engenders. hatred which even&#xD;
the wisdom of age and the charity of reason can never&#xD;
dispel.&#xD;
It seemed to be natural with Corolan to oppose every&#xD;
thing that pleased his brother, so different were their&#xD;
dispositions. Falkner knew the habits of Corie so well,&#xD;
that he rarely opposed him except in matters of great im-&#xD;
yortance. He desired to continue the rules by which&#xD;
his parents had governed the refractory boy. He loved&#xD;
his brother, because it was evident that the disagreea-&#xD;
ble boy had but few friends, and it was entirely uncer-&#xD;
t*iin how long he would retain them.&#xD;
The preparatory school was situated in a shady grove&#xD;
convenient to the Campus. Falkner made it an invari-&#xD;
able rule to be near the Academy when the boys were&#xD;
dismissed for the day, in order that he might join his&#xD;
brother and induce him to take a walk. He thought by&#xD;
pursuing this course Corolan might be freed from many&#xD;
temptations, and finally reclaimed from the'error of his&#xD;
ways. Palktier was almost a man in statue, though he&#xD;
wi seakeely sixteen years of age ; yet he was very&#xD;
jttvenile, and almost effeminate in appearance, and it&#xD;
seem9d perfectly consistent for him to be Corolan's pro-&#xD;

compactly built; he was hardy and perfectly prepared&#xD;
to encounter hardships.&#xD;
"Now, Falkner, if you desire to walk for a wager,&#xD;
suppose you mark off a circuit and let me choose my lo-&#xD;
cation and keep time-for it is evident to my mind that&#xD;
I cannot keep pace with you, and I have just consulted&#xD;
my legs upon the subject, and find them unwilling to&#xD;
enlist in the contest."&#xD;
"I beg pardon, brother; I have been so accustomed&#xD;
to walking with father that I had forgotten that your&#xD;
short legs were contending with mine."&#xD;
"You are perfectly excusable, my young philosopher,&#xD;
but you must not offend again after the same style.: ;&#xD;
What did father say about the clothes we should buy&#xD;
this Winter ? I am getting extremely anxious to appear&#xD;
before my dulcinea."&#xD;
"Am I to be tortured thus every dayrabout your/ul,&#xD;

doubt not but that you would order a suit of m 'l and .&#xD;

I will not purchase any for myself, but will order a sup-&#xD;
ply of paints and drawing materials in lieu of the same.&#xD;
We will go now to the store and make the purchases.&#xD;
What color do you prefer for your suit, Corie ?"&#xD;
"If Iam to choose for myself," said the delighted boy,&#xD;
"I will select black cloth for the coat, blue casimere for&#xD;
the pants, and buff cloth for the vest."&#xD;

"You must let me make my own selections, then,&#xD;
and allow me to do the principal part of the talking.&#xD;
At times I will ask your opinion, but you must coincide&#xD;
with me. I have not had a real good spell of talking&#xD;
in two weeks, and I wish to exercise my voice."&#xD;
"Have your own way this time," said Falkner. " I&#xD;
hope you will not keep me witing until dark, nor should&#xD;
you worry the merchant."&#xD;
"That is fair for once in your life, brother, just give&#xD;
me your paw upon that," said Corolan, as they entered&#xD;
the finely furnished store.&#xD;
Corolan displayed his taste, exercised his lungs and&#xD;
the patience of his faithful brother, who paid the bill to&#xD;
the rated merchant, whom the young Adonis had of-&#xD;
fended more thah once before the purchases were made.&#xD;
The goods were left at the tailor's with directions to have&#xD;
the suit made up after the most approved style.&#xD;

CHAPTER        XXIII.&#xD;
WHEN Corolan received his new suit of clothes, he&#xD;
was so. much delighted that the room could' scarcely&#xD;
contain him. He stripped himself to the skin, washed&#xD;
with brown Windsor soap and arrayed himself with as&#xD;
much pride as an Eastern prince. Falkner did not ap-&#xD;
pear to notice him at all, for fear the boy might become&#xD;
dissatisfied with the clothes and cast them aside. Corie&#xD;
was really a fine looking boy, .with as much pride as&#xD;
ever falls to the lot of mortals. He was one of those&#xD;
strange beings who believe everything made especially&#xD;
for their use, and that they are formed to receive atten,&#xD;
tions without rendering services for the same.  He&#xD;
walked up to the mirror, surveyed himself a few mo-&#xD;
ments, cast a glance at his brother, who did not think&#xD;
it prudent to look in that direction, and making the dis-&#xD;
covery that Falkner was not watching him, the vain&#xD;
lark commenced the task of copying the mode of ar-&#xD;
ranging his hair and cravat from the style of his bro-&#xD;
ther. He tried to make his hair curl like Falkner's,&#xD;
but it seemed impossible for him to do so. After sev-&#xD;
eral ineffectual attempts at imitation, he adopted his&#xD;
own plan. He next endeavored to tie his cravat like&#xD;
Falkner usually did, but made an utter failure. "I&#xD;
know what I can do," murmured the boy;. "I can brush&#xD;

off as much dust as Falkner can, wash my skin as clean,&#xD;
if not as white as his, and can use up as much cologne&#xD;
as he can, but to save my life I cannot look half as re-&#xD;
spectable as he .does. Blame the fine looking fellow!&#xD;
everything comes.perfectly natural to him, yet he is as&#xD;
indifferent to his charms as I am vain of my silly at-&#xD;
tempts at display."&#xD;
"Brother Corolan," said Falkner, "you look very&#xD;
charming in your fine new dress; I suppose .you are&#xD;
going out to see your dulcinea?"&#xD;
"You are rather fast this evening, Falkner; I am&#xD;
only trying on the clothes to see whether they fit me or&#xD;
not. I am rather inclined, to think they do not suit me,&#xD;
since you are so well pleased with them."&#xD;
"Turn around Corie," said the boy; "I had not ob-&#xD;
served them very closely; I think now that the coat is&#xD;
rather loose in the back for you, and the sleeves are a&#xD;
trifle too tight just' above the elbows. Your pants do&#xD;
not standout as they ought to, and the vest is rather&#xD;
short for you.'"&#xD;
"If that is your opinion, I am perfectly satisfied to&#xD;
wear them, as our ideas upon dress are as different as&#xD;
the poles. This coat sets as easily upon me as my skin,&#xD;
and it is the only one I ever had that suited me in the&#xD;
least. Look at the collar how smoothly it lies, and the&#xD;
waist fits snugly up. Nothing can be more charming&#xD;
thin the pants, and as for the vest, it is a paragon of&#xD;
beauty.  Oh'! I shall surely make a conquest of my&#xD;
eetheart now."&#xD;

ther, or you will force your friends to laugh at you.&#xD;
The students are to give a' party very soon; it may be&#xD;
possible that your intended will be present. For the&#xD;
balance of the evening please take up your. books and&#xD;
endeavor to learn your Latin lesson."&#xD;
"You are surely relating a fable to a deaf man now,&#xD;
Falkner, for I shall have no use for the dead languages,&#xD;
having but little desire to converse with ghosts. Do&#xD;
yon suppose Cicero, if he should rise from the dead,&#xD;
could understand you and professor Graymont?    I&#xD;
have never been so completely worried out in my life&#xD;
as I was one night last week. The antique professor&#xD;
and your ancient self clattered away at the verbs, ad-&#xD;
jectives and pronouns, until I almost wished that the&#xD;
spacious earth was one voluminous Latin Grammar and&#xD;
you and he were the only inhabitants upon it."&#xD;
"That is yery uncharitable in you, brother, since I&#xD;
have been so kind as to induce father to buy that suit&#xD;
of clothes for you. Do I not literally stuff your les-&#xD;
sons down your throat ? You do not try to receive&#xD;
them through the channels. of reason. I see plainly&#xD;
that you must learn everything by imitation or frequent&#xD;
repetition."&#xD;
" That is sufficient, brother; you are putting 'me fast&#xD;
to sleep; I feel the leaden god, as you and professor&#xD;
Graymont call him, drawing his sable curtains: around&#xD;

The wild, but brilliant lad, tired himself completely&#xD;
04t before he ceased talking, and having disrobed, went&#xD;
to bed to dream of his dulcinea, the black pony and the&#xD;
new watch his mother had promised to send him. Falk-&#xD;

boy frequently performs the task of translating the les-&#xD;
sons for the entire class, and Falkner was chosen for&#xD;
that purpose. If he could not read an intricate sen-&#xD;
1ence, solve a mathematical proposition or elucidate an&#xD;
abstruse question in rhetoric or logic, the professors&#xD;
were applied to. It was rarely that the learned boy&#xD;
failed to give entire satisfaction upon any point.&#xD;
Time flew by rapidly and the end of the first year&#xD;
4f Falkner's college life was approaching. He had&#xD;
easily maintained the first position in the class, though&#xD;
much of his time had been spent in amusing and in-&#xD;
structing his brother. He had redeemed the promise&#xD;
he :made to Corie relative to the chain. The virgin gold&#xD;
links supported the beautiful watch his mother had sent&#xD;
him, thanks to Falkner's liberality. His dulcinea had&#xD;
not been as easily victimized as he imagined, yet he had'&#xD;
some hope of obtaining her love by. another year. If&#xD;
shAohiad buffed him, the secret was carefully kept by&#xD;
the atute lad.&#xD;
&#xD;
- Falkner had learned to write verse, and had been&#xD;
complimented by the professors. He was pronounced&#xD;
to be the brightest student that had ever entered the&#xD;
University. The following letter .to his father may be&#xD;
read with interest:&#xD;
"UNIVERSITY OF M   -, Jgne 1st, 18--.&#xD;
"Dear JFather : I am rejoiced to inform you of the&#xD;
change- in brother Corolan's habits. It is said that&#xD;
drops of water will eventually wear away the hardest&#xD;
stones, so will a dull mind receive instruction by fre-&#xD;
quent repetition. I had almost despaired of Corolan's&#xD;
ever being able to master the rudiments of the Latin&#xD;
language, but it is true he has made wonderful progress&#xD;
during the last few months.&#xD;
"Do not blame me, dear father,' if you discover that&#xD;
I have allowed him more. money than you directed me&#xD;
to give him. I think he is entirely too fond of dress,&#xD;
yet without a stimulus of some kind he would not have&#xD;
been satisfied to remain as a student with boys who are&#xD;
so finely attired.&#xD;
"I am truly beset with temptations, yet I strive to re-&#xD;
member your counsels, trusting that I may do no wrong.&#xD;
"If I win the esteem and praises of the virtuous and&#xD;
good, I shall be confident that I have done my duty.&#xD;
The older I become, the more I pm impressed with the&#xD;
obligations I am under to respect the laws of the Su-&#xD;
preme Being who, upholds and sustains us by His supe-&#xD;
rior goodness.  Some of the students pretend to be&#xD;
atheists, but their very assertions are confuted by the&#xD;

arguments they use.: I fear that brother's young mind&#xD;
may become imbued with their false philosophy, yet I&#xD;
shall battle against those influences with all my might.&#xD;
"I am not a believer in dreams; but I do have some&#xD;
very strange scenes presented before me at times whilst&#xD;
I sleep. You remember the singular, yet painful, dream&#xD;
I had when brother was so dangerously ill ? I have had&#xD;
a repetition of the same nocturnal visitation again of&#xD;
late, I shall not allow it to weigh upon my mind ; but&#xD;
why should I conceal it from you? I do think I shall&#xD;
experience strange vicissitudes of fortune at some period&#xD;
of life.&#xD;
"You have often warned me against the use of ardent&#xD;
spirits. A few days since, brother and I were invited&#xD;
to a party given at the house of one of the Faculty.&#xD;
Wine was pleztiful at the table; still I drank only one,&#xD;
glassfull; I amworry to say that Corolan was not so ab-&#xD;
stemious. At the risk of revealing secrets, I must re-&#xD;
late .a funny little circumstance : I observed that Cor-&#xD;
olan was drinking as much as any of the students, and&#xD;
I went to him and remonstrated with him, but all to no&#xD;
effect. One of the members of my own class who has&#xD;
taken quite a fancy to brother, was acting as his chape-&#xD;
ron on that occasion. He took a fresh bottle of cham-.&#xD;
p% gne and opened it. He desired the boys to hold their&#xD;
glasses for another draught. Brother was so completely&#xD;
under the influence of what he had already drank, that&#xD;
he mistook the stopple of a decanter for a wine-glass,&#xD;
and held that to the boy to be filled with the intoxica.&#xD;
ting beverage! I managed to get him to our room be..&#xD;

He has promised me that he will not drink more than&#xD;
I do at any future party, and you know that Corie will&#xD;
keep a pledge sacred when it is once given.&#xD;

"3fy dear Father: I promised, in my last letter, to&#xD;
send you some verses, which I now enclose. I trust&#xD;
that you may not criticise my first effort at a long poem&#xD;
too closely. I have not shown it to any person, though&#xD;
often tempted to ask the advice of one of the profes-&#xD;
sors.&#xD;
" Corie thinks that I will be a poor man some of these&#xD;
days, because I am learning to paint, and have a fancy&#xD;
for poetry. He says he has peeped into the pages of&#xD;
some moon-struck authors himself, when he thought no&#xD;

TALE.'&#xD;
&#xD;
"THE HERMIT'S TALE.&#xD;
""Dark was the night; the wind blew shrill and loud;&#xD;
The rain descended from the angry cloud ;&#xD;
The mountain trembled 'neath the thunder's sound,&#xD;
And Nature's echoes filled the groves around.&#xD;
The stately oaks, (the forest's giants ol ,&#xD;
&#xD;
4s&#xD;
&#xD;
Beneath whose shades for countess years untold,&#xD;
The hero, sage, or Indian warriors wild&#xD;
Had planned their fights, or on their fair ones smiled,)&#xD;
Dark; to the sky their stalwart branches bend,&#xD;
While torrents through the leafy domes descend.&#xD;
The wolf went howling to his rocky lair,&#xD;
Led onward by the lightning's fiery glare;&#xD;
Nor stopped he at the hermit's sainted cell-&#xD;
That holy one whom all men loved so well.&#xD;
Long years had passed since first the hermit came-&#xD;
None knew from whence, nor had they learned his name.&#xD;
But this they knew: by either night or day,.&#xD;
If uck'ess Wight shouts on that mountain stray,&#xD;
And wander to the hermit's sainted cell,&#xD;
lie lingered long, and every word that fell&#xD;
From lips which only deigned to speak in prayer,&#xD;
Was hoarded up as some prized relic rare.&#xD;
- Fierce raged the storm; young Tibald's fiery steed,&#xD;
Scared by the lightning,-put forth all his speed;&#xD;
And rushing from the road and through the dell,&#xD;
Climbed the rough peak and reached the hermit's cell-&#xD;
The holy father, on his knees-in prayer,&#xD;
Was asking aid from Heaven; his every care&#xD;
Or ill of life was cast upon his beads;&#xD;
Those numbered he in fervency. His deeds&#xD;
Were known to Heaven ; may his prayer be heard :&#xD;
Who trusts in prayer believes God's holy word.&#xD;
"Long gazed young Tibald, then, with wild delight ;&#xD;
Still knelt-the hermit at his altar bright,&#xD;
'Nor ceased he from his fervent Vesper prayer&#xD;
Till all his beads were told. His knees were bare&#xD;
From oft reclining on the flag-stone cold ;&#xD;
Around his neck was hung-a cross of gold.&#xD;
. A sable robe -around his form was thrown.&#xD;
And wooden sandals on his feet were wok.&#xD;
Three waxen candles shed their mellow light&#xD;
Within the cell upon that stormy night.&#xD;
The hermit!beckoned Tibald to a seat--&#xD;

A rustic stool whereon his sacred feet&#xD;
Had oft reclined when stretched upon his bed,&#xD;
And leaden shadows 'round the cell were spread.&#xD;
'Holy hermit! one night within thy cell&#xD;
I pray thee let a wayworn traveler dwell;&#xD;
My limbs are wet and chilled with drenching rain;&#xD;
Dark is the night and trackless is the plain.&#xD;
My charger, frightened at the thunder's sound,&#xD;
Forsook the road and up the mountain wound.-&#xD;
Then from a recess in the rocky wall&#xD;
The hermit brought a chest compact and small;&#xD;
A secret spring threw back the iron lid,&#xD;
And garments fine wit-hin the chest lay hid.&#xD;
'Long years have passed,' the holy father said,&#xD;
'Since on these clothes mine aged eyes were laid;&#xD;
I could a tale, young man, to you unfold-&#xD;
But no; my secret to the silent grave&#xD;
With me must go-ave Maria, save."&#xD;
Then took he from the chest the garments rare&#xD;
And robed his strange young guest with studied care.&#xD;
Bright glowed the flames within the sacred cell;&#xD;
The smoking meat sent forth a savory smell;&#xD;
The red wine sparkled in the goblet bright,&#xD;
And soon a festive board made glad the sight.&#xD;
'The tire has come when from this aching breast&#xD;
My secret must come forth;. my soul will rest&#xD;
On earth no more until is brought to light&#xD;
The hidden scenes of that eventful night.'&#xD;
The hermit gazed upon his youthful guest,&#xD;
WhQ,'in the old, but princely,,garments dressed;&#xD;
Was seated at the well-filled, rustic board.&#xD;
The rosy Wine was in the goblets poured-&#xD;
The rosy {iti long in the larder stored.&#xD;
"The feast was o'er; the table moved from sight;&#xD;
Still raged the £torzn, and doubly dark the night ;&#xD;
Then crossing thrice himself with piops care,&#xD;

His prayer was ended; then he sought his guest.&#xD;

My long black curls were like thy raven hair&#xD;
When first the regal crown with diamonds spread,&#xD;
By pious hands was placed upon my head.&#xD;
My royal spouse across the ocean came,&#xD;
And lit the altar with love's holy flame;&#xD;
When in my rms I pressed her form so fair-&#xD;
Dark were her eyes and black her flowing hair-&#xD;
My wide dominions dwindled into nought,&#xD;
Compared to her. Could love like hers be bought ?&#xD;
Swift passed the days, and sweet the rosy hours&#xD;
Unheeded, flew. One eve within the bowers&#xD;
Whose leafy dome would scarce admit the light&#xD;
Of that bright orb, the silvery lamp of night,&#xD;
We sat and listened to the nightingale&#xD;
Repeating to her mates her plaintive tale&#xD;
My soul was filled with love, and grief, and pride;&#xD;
I knew not why, for in my royal bride&#xD;
My soul was centered, yet Imy heart was sad;&#xD;
Such fervent love had well nigh nade me mad.&#xD;
I could have dwelt with my sweet spouse forever,&#xD;

I could have dwelt beneath that bower so bright&#xD;

One night of moonshine, with birds and bowers-&#xD;
One endless night of moonshine, love and flowers.&#xD;

"Like some proud bird that soars to realms on high,&#xD;

CHAPTER XXV..&#xD;
&#xD;
MR. MANNING made extensive preparations for the&#xD;
reception of the boys. He intended that they should&#xD;
be taken by surprise. He did what Southerners are&#xD;
ever apt to do upon extra occasions-killed a pig and&#xD;
barbecued it. (You need not laugh, reader, your father&#xD;
did the same thing when you were expected home!)-&#xD;
Mrs. Manning sacrificed a fat gobler at the altar of ma-&#xD;
ternal love, and a real festal board was spread for the&#xD;
boys.&#xD;
The family carriage was dispatched to the town to&#xD;
receive the boys at the station. The good Mr. Manning&#xD;
delivered his proclamation and the servants rejoiced in&#xD;
a-holiday.&#xD;
"Come, Dick," said black Joe, "lets dress up in our&#xD;
best bib and tucker, as aunt Phillis calls it, and go and&#xD;
meet mos- Falkner and mass Corie. I tell you, mun,&#xD;
if you don't put on good close, and wash dat black skin&#xD;
o' yourn, mass Corrie. will get out de carriage and&#xD;
.comb your head for you. You know how he combs&#xD;
heads, boy. He jes takes de curry comb and 'pears like&#xD;
it does him good :to hear you holler."&#xD;
"Dat is'all true, nigger," said Dick, "but den as ole&#xD;
master's already gin me to mos Curie, I don't care much&#xD;
ef he does sorter whip me sometimes. He gi's me many&#xD;
&#xD;
more things den mos Falkner does you. Mos Corie1&#xD;
got too much sense dan hurt his nigger ; he jes makes&#xD;
out like he hurts when he dont."&#xD;
"Now, Dick," said Joe, "you never seed mos Falk-&#xD;
ner hit one de black foax in your life. I don't know&#xD;
dat he ever expects to. I jes bleeve he gwine make a&#xD;
preecher. I hope mos Falkner giv me sebenpens. I&#xD;
don't 'spect your moster get any, 'cause he oilers spens&#xD;
his munny jes for foolishness."&#xD;
Those negro boys, whom the father had gifen to his&#xD;
sons, (as all farmers do, simply for the sake of letting&#xD;
their children have something to claim,) chatted away&#xD;
as happily as if they expected their young masters to&#xD;
bring them a fortune. Fully two hours before the car-&#xD;
riage was expected, Joe and Dick started off in a sweep&#xD;
ing trot to meet it. When they had proceeded about&#xD;
three miles at that rapid rate, they espied the carriage&#xD;
moving slowly down the hill. They increased their speed&#xD;
and rushed forward to meet the carriage, hallooing afI&#xD;
the time, "yonder cums mos Falkner-yonder canns&#xD;
mos Cone! bless God! dis nigger want to die; get uit&#xD;
de way and let dis nigger run. Black Sam thirik hiin&#xD;
self mity smart settin' up dar drivin' dem fine college&#xD;
boys."&#xD;
"Howdy, mos Falkner-howdy mos Corie; how you&#xD;
boaf bin dis long time?"&#xD;
After the familiar salutations had been passed, Ooro-&#xD;
Ian ordered the driver to stop. He opened the door,&#xD;
alighted from the carriage, and walked up to Dick to&#xD;
compare hights. Having satisfied himself that black&#xD;

Sok had outgrown him, Corolah mounted upon the&#xD;
Lc of the stout negro, as he had done a thousand&#xD;
timesbefore, and rode him in advance of the fast trot-&#xD;
tipp horses fully a quarter of a mile before Dick could&#xD;
be prevailed upon to' let his precious rider dismount.&#xD;
When Corie dismounted, he made Dick perform several&#xD;
qvolutions, such as turning summersaults, jumping up&#xD;
agd striking his heels together three times before he&#xD;
touchedthe ground.&#xD;
i'Now, mos Corie, gin me one quarter dollar, plees&#xD;

Sthe boy that waited upon me at college. How often&#xD;
hge 1 told you not to appear before me with your head&#xD;
h Wcormbed."&#xD;
JIere Oorolan gave Dick a few light strokes with a&#xD;
switch by way of asserting his superiority, and drawing&#xD;
forth a horn comb from his pocket, the mischievous boy&#xD;
gave Dick's head a radical combing.&#xD;
a messy, mos Corie, you pull all de har out po&#xD;

quarter and this handkerchief and cut out home. If&#xD;
you dosnot have the black'pony curried down slick when&#xD;
I get there, I will comb your head well for you."&#xD;
Dick started in a run, as happy as a king. He de-&#xD;
clared to Joe, who had made a draft upon the liberality&#xD;
of Falkner for fifty-cents, that master Corie Was tife&#xD;
best young man in 'the world. He soon forgot the head&#xD;
combing, but he did not fail to obey the commands d&#xD;
Corolan relative to the pony.&#xD;
. When the carriage arrived at the gate of Mr. Manx-&#xD;
ning, the father and mother went out and gave them a&#xD;
very warm reception. The dinner was served up is&#xD;

CHAPTER XXVI.&#xD;
IT is not prudent to dwell too long upon one theme.&#xD;
We have given a faithful history of the lives of Falk-&#xD;
ner and Corolan from their childhood up to the close of&#xD;
their first year in the University and Preparatory school.&#xD;
Mr. Manning was so well pleased at the manly course&#xD;
and studious habits of the.good Falkner, and so much&#xD;
surprised at the improvement in Corolan, that he shed&#xD;
tears of joy. There was only one thing wanting to com-&#xD;
plete his happiness, and that was an impossibility. If&#xD;
Ialkner had been born his son he could not have loved&#xD;
him more than he now did; or even if it were possible&#xD;
for him to conceal from him the fact of his being a&#xD;
foundling, his joy might still be complete. Mr. Man-&#xD;
ning had a strange presentiment that Falkner would be&#xD;
exposed to perils, though he was confident that the boy&#xD;
had nerve sufficient to encounter any dangers that might&#xD;
beset him. If the feelings of Mr. Manning had been&#xD;
.otherwise than of the most fraternal character, the&#xD;
doubtful parentage of his foster son would not have&#xD;
cast a darkening shadow upon his own manly brow.&#xD;
He considered Falkner, whose hight was nearly equal&#xD;
to his own, as one of the noblest specimens of youth he&#xD;
had ever seen. His naturally effeminate face had lost&#xD;
a slight degree of its delicacy and put on the ruddy&#xD;

&#xD;
isage of early manhood.  His hair had assumed a&#xD;
darker hue, yet the auburn ringlets still clustered in&#xD;
many a natural curl about his well-shaped head. His&#xD;
eyes, as blue as the welkin, were not the least at-&#xD;
tractive feature of this. interesting youth. Mr. Man-&#xD;
ning observed that Corolan had grown much, and his&#xD;
face was gradually improving in appearance. Corolan&#xD;
had been at home only a few days, when he expressed&#xD;
a desire to return to school. It is strange, thought his&#xD;
father,. that Cone, who has never been known to love&#xD;
school, should have improved so much as to desire to&#xD;
leave home again in a few days, after having been ab-&#xD;
sent one whole year.&#xD;
"How is this, Falkner; has Corolan really a love for&#xD;
books ?"&#xD;
"I think not, father," said the boy, " but brother is&#xD;
improving rapidly; yet I scarcely-know how he learns,&#xD;
unless it is from the frequent drillings I give him nightly&#xD;
upon his lessons, very much against his own inclina-&#xD;
tion."&#xD;
"You are a good tutor, my son; I had almost ar-&#xD;
rived at the conclusion that Corolan would ever remain&#xD;
totally ignorant of the contents of books."&#xD;
"I hope, father, that you will permit him to return&#xD;
to the University with me. He may improve wonder-&#xD;
fully during next year. If he remains at home he will&#xD;
as surely spend all his time in riding, hunting and fish-&#xD;
ing as the means, are placed in his power."&#xD;
"You shall be gratified, my boy, and Corie shall be&#xD;
placed entirely under your control. But, to change the&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb  n="216-217" xml:id="VAC7718-00000109"/>&#xD;
subject, why did you not relate how the hermit disposed&#xD;
of Estell when he left the palace so precipitately after&#xD;
the murder of the queen and her paramour ?"&#xD;
'"I thought I would merely give the story a slight&#xD;
touch of romance, leaving your imagination to supply&#xD;
any defect in the narrative. I did not even give the&#xD;
name of the king nor denominate the country he ruled.&#xD;
The king's name was Bohomathalzal, quite an unpoetic&#xD;
appellation, as you will observe, and it was so difficult&#xD;
for me to insert it in the verse. I was fearful that Bo-&#xD;
homathaizal might be a hard name to rhyme to, and I&#xD;
thought I would serve it like you do the gar fish when&#xD;
we are seining-throw it out. The name of his king-&#xD;
dom is Utopia.'&#xD;

Tale' is strictly original with me, and was written merely&#xD;
to gratify a whim, at odd times. King Bohomathalzal.&#xD;
recei-ved the crown from his father Anakthalzer, and&#xD;
was supposed to have been the most wealthy prince that&#xD;
ever reigned in Utopia. He gave'his father's fine pal-&#xD;

the wonder of the world. Kings and princes came from&#xD;

distant countries to see the magnificent pile and to taste&#xD;
the rich dainties of his magnificently spread board.&#xD;
One of the kings of the East was so much delighted&#xD;
with Bohomathalzal that he gave him his daughter in&#xD;
marriage, whose dowry was forty millions of piastres.&#xD;
Bohomathalzal was so enamored with his queen that he&#xD;
expended thousands of dollars upon her wardrobe daily.&#xD;
IIer beauty and rare accomplishments were so attractive&#xD;
that the premier of the' king, who possesed as many&#xD;
graces of person and mind as the renowned Leicester,&#xD;
won her love and despoiled her of her virtue. The king&#xD;
loved her too dearly to accuse her, from silly reports&#xD;
and suspicions, but he could not withhold his hands&#xD;
from shedding blood when he saw his wife, at the dead&#xD;
hour of night, in social converse with his premier. He&#xD;
shot both of. them dead and hastened to the palace, took&#xD;
a large quantity of gold and.valuables, not neglecting&#xD;
the 'golden crown, and going to the bed of the royal&#xD;
babe, he took it up softly and carried it away with him.&#xD;
He was accompanied by a trusty servant, upon whom&#xD;
he enjoined secrecy. They traveled as private citizens,&#xD;
and took up their residence in a strange country. The&#xD;
self-exiled king bought a few roods of land and lived&#xD;
secluded with his servant and babe about two .years.&#xD;
The servant was a white man, of rare intelligence, who&#xD;
had been a faithful attendant of the king's father. Bo-&#xD;
homathalzal exacted a pledge from his faithful Adoni-&#xD;
ram, that he would never reveal his secret, but raise and&#xD;
educate Estell as his own son. He gave Adoniram a&#xD;
large quantity of gold, and taking his crown and jew-&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb  n="218-219" xml:id="VAC7718-00000110"/>&#xD;
els, and a few clothes, he went to another strange coun-&#xD;
try and dwelt in the cell in which Estell found him."&#xD;
"That is a very strange little romance of itself," said&#xD;
his father; I" but you have not related any of the par-&#xD;
ticulars of Estell's life."&#xD;
"Estell," resumed Falkner, "was a very wild and&#xD;
venturesome boy. When Adoniram was not instructing&#xD;
him in the languages, the royal boy would stray from&#xD;
the cottage and engage in the sports of the chase. Upon.&#xD;
several occasions he was wounded by the wild boars and&#xD;
panthers which he killed. He was not contented to&#xD;
dwell in that secluded spot, and tried to obtain the con-&#xD;
sent of Adoniram for him to join the army ; but the&#xD;
good old man, who was noted for integrity, implored his&#xD;
boy to remain with him. Estell was hunting one day&#xD;
in the forest, when he encountered a sybil, who exam-&#xD;
ined his palm and told him that he was the son of a&#xD;
king, and would see his father within a few years. He&#xD;
predicted that he would be a prosperous and happy mon-&#xD;
arch, but as the lines in his hands crossed so strangely,&#xD;
he would encounter many difficulties before he obtained&#xD;
the kingdom of his fathers.&#xD;
"Estell related the sayings of the sybil to Adoniram&#xD;
when he returned home. The old man said to him that&#xD;
he had but little to do to listen to the tale of a wander-&#xD;
ing witch. But the boy, who had almost arrived at the&#xD;
age of manhood, allowed the prophecies of the sybil to&#xD;
prey upon his mind. He longed to be a great man.&#xD;
He had not the modesty of Moses, who refused to be&#xD;
called the son of Pharaoh's daughter, even though a&#xD;
crown should be placed upon his head.&#xD;

"He could not, he would not remain in solitude. He&#xD;
threatened to throw himself from a precipice if Adoni-&#xD;
ram should not consent for him to go to the wars. The&#xD;
old man consented, and placing a fine steed at his dis-&#xD;
posal, invoked the blessings of the Virgin upon the head&#xD;
of the erring boy. Estell rode from the cottage as&#xD;
happy as a belted knight, not doubting the prophecies&#xD;
of the sybil. He lifted his mace and battle-ax and&#xD;
slew many imaginary foes ere he had ridden a furlong&#xD;
from the cottage of the weeping Adoniram. The fiery&#xD;
youth had all the beauty of Adonis and the valor of&#xD;
Achilles. He was received in the army, was among the&#xD;
foremost when a charge was to be made, was knighted,&#xD;
honored and rewarded by the prince whom he served.&#xD;
"I have not yet seen my father," said Estell; "yet&#xD;
I have encountered many difficulties. Surely the words&#xD;
of the sybil are true.&#xD;
"He was acting in the capacity of a spy upon the&#xD;
night he so strangely encountered his father in the per-&#xD;
son of the hermit."        C&#xD;
"You have not told me, Falkner, whether Estell ever&#xD;
gained his kingdom."&#xD;
"You must be interested, father, in my tale ; you&#xD;
will not even give me time to breathe, before you hurry&#xD;
me on with the recitation. When Bohomathalzal died,&#xD;
Estell discovered among his relicts several letters which&#xD;
the hermit had written, directed to Adoniram, giving&#xD;
shim directions as,ti'his future course. Estell could not&#xD;
doubt but that the hermit was his father. The crown&#xD;
and royal robes were found in the cell. He had his&#xD;

father's remains transported to Utopia and interred in&#xD;
the royal cemetery."&#xD;
"You are rather fast with your narrative, my son;&#xD;
you have not told me anything about the difficulties that&#xD;
Estell encountered in obtaining his kingdom."&#xD;
As to that, father, it is a long story; but if you&#xD;
will give me your attention after tea, I will relate all&#xD;
the particulars."&#xD;

CHAPTER        XXVII.&#xD;
"Now, Falkner," said his father, when they had&#xD;
risen from the supper-table, "you'must tell me how&#xD;
Estell obtained his kingdom."&#xD;
"You may doubt the truth of some of my assertions,&#xD;
my dear father, but they are as true as some of the ad-&#xD;
ventures which we read of in the Arabian Nights. The&#xD;
unhappy Estell had as many difficulties and dangers to&#xD;
encounter as Eneas of old experienced ere he arrived&#xD;
at the place of his destination. Often the shades 'of&#xD;
his father appeared to him in his dreams and implored&#xD;
him to bury his body in that strange land and hasten&#xD;
on to his beloved Utopia; but the good boy had taken&#xD;
upon himself a vow to suffer death before he would yield&#xD;
up the corpse of the deceased king. He was wrecked&#xD;
upon an island, where he remained with a few friends&#xD;
for two years. One day while they were out searching&#xD;
for drift wood, and eggs which were deposited upon the&#xD;
island by the sea-birds, they espied a vessel. With joy&#xD;
they discovered that the ship was making for the island.&#xD;
They were horror stricken when, they, discovered that&#xD;
the vessel carried a black flag at the mast head. The&#xD;
pirates landed anS took possession of the persons and&#xD;
property of the unfortunate sojourners. Happy it was&#xD;
for them that they were able bodied men, or they night&#xD;

have been slain. They were marched aboard of the&#xD;
vessel and carried to a distant port and sold into slave-&#xD;
ry. It was.fortunate for, Estell that he had concealed&#xD;
his treasures in a cave upon the island. He had buried&#xD;
the coffer that contained the remains of his father.&#xD;
"The master of Estell was a good, man, and treated&#xD;
him with much kindness. He was employed .as an&#xD;
amanuensis and interpreter, (thanks to the instructions&#xD;
he had received from the learned Adoniram.) The&#xD;
merchant died after many years, bequeathing his whole&#xD;
estate to Estell, who had married his only daughter.-&#xD;
Estell purchased a ship, sailed to the island, and placing&#xD;
his treasures aboard, steered for Utopia, many hundred&#xD;
miles away to the South. He had not revealed to any&#xD;
person on board that he was the son of the late Boho-&#xD;
mathaizal, trusting to Fate to solve the great enigma&#xD;
of his strange life. When the vessel of Estell had pro-&#xD;
eeeded a few hundred miles upon the expedition, the&#xD;
ship of a pirate hove in sight. Estell gave the pirati-&#xD;
eal ship a few broadsides,, and fastening the grappling&#xD;
irons to its sides, boarded it, followed by the trusty&#xD;
crew. All the pirates except the captain were slain-&#xD;
he being taken alive. What was the joy of Estell at re-&#xD;
cognizing in him the pirate who had sold him into slavery.&#xD;
He was immediately run up to the yard-arm amid the&#xD;
shouts of the exultant crew. Groans were heard issu-&#xD;
ing from the cabin of the pirate's vessel. Estell went&#xD;
immediately to relieve the unfortunate persons. Adon-&#xD;
iram, the aged foster-father of the boy, was among the&#xD;
number. He was released; and fainted in the arms of&#xD;

Estell, whom he recognized. He had traversed half of&#xD;
the globe searching for the adventurous boy. The ves-&#xD;
sel of the pirates was made fast to the ship of Estell,&#xD;
and, buoyant with hope, the modern iEneas steered&#xD;
again for Utopia.&#xD;
"Whenthe prosperous winds wafted them into the port&#xD;
of the principal city of his kingdom, Estell was sur-&#xD;
prised at the magnificence of the buildings. He was&#xD;
greeted as a stranger whose prowess had subdued the&#xD;
wizzard of the seas. He had the difficulties of Ulysses&#xD;
to encounter ere he obtained his kingdom.&#xD;
"He learned that a foreign prince ruled in the place&#xD;
of his father, and had brought over as many followers&#xD;
of his own as William of Normandy conveyed to Eng-&#xD;
land. He had distributed the principal offices. among&#xD;
them--thus Utopia was held in complete subjection.-&#xD;
He presented'himself before the people and claimed to&#xD;
bd the lost prince. Adoniram, who was present, was&#xD;
recognized by his old associates, and the story of Estell&#xD;
was believed by many; yet, others, among. them the&#xD;
king, believed it to be a fabrication. The king issued&#xD;
a warrant for the arrest of Estell, but he collected many&#xD;
soldiers who were not well disposed to the usurper, and&#xD;
resisted the authority of the pseudo king. The armies&#xD;
fought long and desperately, and victory perched upon&#xD;
the standard of Estell. The aged Adoniram brought&#xD;
forth the crown which had been piously kept by Estell,&#xD;
and placed it upop the head of his foster son. The&#xD;
joy of Adoniram was so great when the king marched&#xD;
into the palace, that he expired."&#xD;

When Falkner had finished the narrative, his father&#xD;
was satisfied that the boy had more imagination than he&#xD;
had given him credit for.: He cautioned the boy from&#xD;
indulging too freely in novel reading, but recommended&#xD;
a few standard works for his perusal.&#xD;
Within a few weeks Falkner and Corie bade farewell,&#xD;

[FROM THE JOURNAL OF FALKNER MANNING.]&#xD;
"TEN years have passed since I entered thelUniversity&#xD;
of M . Ten years have passed swiftly away, yet&#xD;
they have been mingled with sunshine and shadow, love&#xD;
and grief, hope and despair. I try to be calm as I&#xD;
write, yet my mind is so troubled at the recollection of&#xD;
the past, I shudder to record my thoughts upon this&#xD;
stainless sheet. I would long to die, but it is sinful in&#xD;
me to wish to hurry myself into the presence of my&#xD;
Maker. I have learned ALL that Mr. Manning knows&#xD;
about my abduction, yet not enough to establish my pa-&#xD;
rentage. How I long to see him whom I so dearly&#xD;
love ! him whom I supposed was my father! And Cor-&#xD;
olan! these eyes may never again behold him, but I&#xD;
shall pray for him till life's last sun shall set.&#xD;
"But let me be more explicit, and chronicle some of&#xD;
the principle events of my life. Perhaps these pages&#xD;
may be exhibited to the world when I shall have ceased&#xD;
to exist; perhaps my mind may be calmed by becoming&#xD;
familiar again with events which have nearly escaped&#xD;

"How happy was I when Ijoined the Sophomore class&#xD;
ohe  niversityof M  -!   Corolan was my con-&#xD;
$tant companion, and from my kindness to him, he had&#xD;
learned to love and respect me. His mind reacted un-&#xD;
der my tutelage, and his reason, which was not obtuse&#xD;
except upon abstruse and scientific subjects, was sud-&#xD;
denly loosened from the leaden fetters which bound it.&#xD;
He became as famous for his excellence in learning as&#xD;
he had formerly been noted for his inattention to oks.&#xD;
Fathie-yes, I must call him father still-was not p-&#xD;
pier on account of this sudden change in the mind of&#xD;
Corolan than I was. He could scarcely believe his eyes&#xD;
when he opened and read the first letter Corolan had&#xD;
ever written. When father was assured by me that the&#xD;
letter had been composed by Corolan, without my assis-&#xD;
tance, he wrote me a long, loving epistle, entreating me&#xD;
to continue my laudable course of instruction. I was&#xD;
directed by him to allow Corolan as much money as.&#xD;
he wanted, not-doubting but that the boy had become&#xD;
as economical as myself. I did not reveal this to Corie,'&#xD;
fearful that he might take advantage of it and relax&#xD;
again into indolent habits. I gave him whatever I&#xD;
thought he needed, not refusing anything within the&#xD;
bounds of reason that he desired.. His love for me in-&#xD;
creased, and I joyfully perceived that he would be able&#xD;
to enter the University by another year. How quickly&#xD;
that time rolled around and found us again at the Uni-&#xD;
versity! As I had expected, Corolan applied for, and,&#xD;
obtained an entry into the Freshman class. I rose Ju-&#xD;
nior, having maintained the first position in the two&#xD;
&#xD;
26&#xD;
&#xD;
lower classes. Father was so overjoyed at the success&#xD;
of Corie, that he insisted upon paying us a visit. He&#xD;
went to the College and spent one week with us. That&#xD;
week was one of the happiest of my life. I had a bed&#xD;
prepared for him in 'my room. One night during his&#xD;
visit, I waked up and saw father bending over me, weep-&#xD;
ing bitterly. He bedewed my cheeks with his tears.&#xD;
I asked him why he grieved; he could give me no an-&#xD;
swer, but, bending over me, kissed me more than once&#xD;
and retired to his bed. I could not divine the cause of&#xD;
his grief, thinking that he was sad on account of being&#xD;
about to leave his children so soon. I can now divine&#xD;
the cause, oh! father, but then I thought I was your&#xD;
own son.&#xD;
"Father left us, having made us many fine presents,&#xD;
and enjoining upon us to write to him every week. He&#xD;
embraced Corolan more tenderly than he had ever done&#xD;
before, but when he came to take leave of me, his frame&#xD;
shook; he pressed me to his bosom, he kissed me, and&#xD;
tears, which he could not restrain, flowed from his eyes&#xD;
like rain-drops. How I remember his looks on that&#xD;
morning! His finely-formed, handsome face looked sad&#xD;
and sorrowful. I had never discovered before that his&#xD;
hair had commenced turning gray. His mild and beauti-&#xD;
ful eye seemed a little sunken. I supposed that he was&#xD;
unwell. No, it. was sorrow; it was the visible trace of&#xD;
grief; it was dejection, on my countt alone. He knew&#xD;
my nature so well that he feared to tell me I was a.&#xD;
fou"'dling. Bless his good heart! his letters are read&#xD;
by me with cai'e and tenderness. If I should ever dis-&#xD;

with half the ardor that I did (and do yet) Mr. Man-&#xD;
ning. But I digress.&#xD;
"Corolan maintained a fair standing in his class, as&#xD;
some supposed, from my superior tuition; but it was not&#xD;
from that -cause. His mind, naturally active, was as&#xD;
capable of grasping a subject as mine, and he devoted&#xD;
his whole time to his studies. He had an excellent&#xD;
constitution, thanks to the superior training he received&#xD;
from father in our field sports. He was capable of per-&#xD;
forming heavier tasks than I could.. I remember that&#xD;
he had set up several nights, on one occasion, in suc-&#xD;
cession-during the whole of which time he never ceas-&#xD;
ed from study. His pride was fully aroused, and he&#xD;
stood at-the head of the class at the Alose of the Fresh-&#xD;
man year.&#xD;
"He was successful in obtaining the love of his dul-&#xD;
cinea, who promised to become his bride when he obtain-&#xD;
ed his diploma. She was indeed a prize. Her beauty&#xD;
was of that soft, dove-like kind that renders the Italian&#xD;
ladies so charming. I have never seen but- one lady&#xD;
who was her superior in point of beauty and accom-&#xD;
plishments, and that was-yes I must name her-that&#xD;
was my own flame, Elfrida Mordaunt.&#xD;
"When the diplomas were distributed to the gradu-&#xD;
ating -hss at the end of my fourth year in college, and&#xD;
it was announced that I had obtained the first honor,&#xD;
there was' general applause. As I went *upon the ros-&#xD;

was seated with the trustees, was weeping for joy. I&#xD;

traveled with Corolan and me when we first went to the&#xD;
University. He was then in quest of a lost son. I&#xD;
remember every word he said as distinctly as if it were&#xD;
yesterday. He is the finest looking old man I have&#xD;
ever seen. When he delivered to me the diploma and&#xD;
the prize, I thought his voice and manner of speaking&#xD;
were unequaled. 'He pressed me warmly by the hand,&#xD;
and -congratulated my father for havin so talented a&#xD;
son. I long to see him again; but how could I meet&#xD;
him, now that he is the Governor of the State and I a&#xD;
poor artist ? He is the guardian of Elfrida, whose love&#xD;
I sought and obtained when I was in the senior class.&#xD;
She was placed at the Female College of M   -by&#xD;
him, where she graduated with honor.&#xD;
"I returned home with father and Corolan, who was&#xD;
as loth to part with his affianced as I was sorry to see&#xD;
Elfrida depart with her father for Crofton.. I promised&#xD;
Elfrida, before, I left, that I would come to Crofton when&#xD;
one year had passed. I had not sought to obtain Mr.&#xD;
Rockford's consent to our marriage, preferring to wait&#xD;
until we had tested our affections for each other thor-&#xD;
oughly.&#xD;
My father was dulyinformed of my intentions-for&#xD;
I had never kept an important secret from him in my&#xD;
life. He interposed -no objections to mygoing to Crof-&#xD;

the beautiful boy asleep at your door, receive him as a&#xD;
gift from Heaven. You may learn something of his&#xD;
history in the future-but not now. That he is one of&#xD;
the most beautiful boys you ever beheld, there can not&#xD;
be a doubt. You have just lost one about his age, and&#xD;
it may not be improper for you to adopt him, You&#xD;
are soon to' remove to another portion of the State, and&#xD;
it will not be incoRvenient for you to adopt the boy as&#xD;
your owrn son. If you make any publication of the&#xD;
discovery of a foundling until the injunction of secrecy&#xD;
is renroved from.you, the boy will be slain,,or yourself&#xD;
will be tlie sufferer in person. You may learn every&#xD;
thing relative to the child at some future day-but you&#xD;
must observe secrecy.       With respect,&#xD;
"O. R."&#xD;
!Thus had my reputed father been held in suspense.&#xD;
Thus had my fates been balanced, as it were, upon a&#xD;
hair. I had been beset with dangers, yet my dear father&#xD;
and mother had carefully preserved my secret. The&#xD;
servants, who loved me dearly, had obeyed the commands'&#xD;
of my father, who, removing to the place where I was&#xD;
raised, within a very few days'after I had been found,&#xD;
easily persuaded the curious that I was his'eldest child.&#xD;
I was but three years of age when I was stolen from&#xD;
my parents, and know nothing of my earlier history.&#xD;
The fil-st thing I remember, was my stapiding 'by my&#xD;
&#xD;
mother's lap playing with' brother Corolan, who was&#xD;
then an interesting child of two years of age. I was&#xD;
then about five years old. Corolan was a warrior from&#xD;
his birth. He commenced fighting .me before he could&#xD;
pronounce my name. I have scratches upon my' face,&#xD;
the marks of which will never be effaced until this flesh&#xD;
shall return to its originalelements. It seemed natural&#xD;
for him to fight everything that moved. He is a stranger&#xD;
to fear, when his passions are excited. I never return-&#xD;
ed one of his blows, because father and mother taught&#xD;
me to love him and them.&#xD;
"My-father was so kind to me that I was unhappy&#xD;
when he went from home and remained beyond his usual&#xD;

without complaining, that she doated upon Corolan. I&#xD;
murmured not; no discontent was ever heard to come&#xD;
from me. She performed herdupy, and I love her dearly,&#xD;
and shall honor her until the grave closes over her.&#xD;
Father loved me more than he did Corolan, because I&#xD;
almost worshipped him. Who could have helped loving&#xD;
so gooa a man as Theodore Manning! He was a model&#xD;
man, who concentrated all the happiness of this life&#xD;
around his own fireside. All the unhappiness that I&#xD;
feel is from the fact that I am not his son."&#xD;
"When I recovered, father took me out to ride in the&#xD;
carriage. He used every means in his power to pacify&#xD;
me and make me, content to live with .him and be his&#xD;
son. He offered me an equal share with Corolan in his&#xD;
immense estate, but I could not accept it. I had learn-&#xD;

ed that my -father was living, yet I did not know what&#xD;
position in society he occupied. If he was a boot-black&#xD;
and possessed honor and integrity, I would rush into his&#xD;
arms. But the dread uncertainty of suspense, ah! that&#xD;
is the most galling of all hardships.&#xD;
"I refused to remain with the man whom I loved so-&#xD;
tenderly. I refused to share his fortune with Corolan.&#xD;
That generous boy, who had learned to love me, would&#xD;
have surrendered the half of his own claim rather than&#xD;
see me depart. But the boy was absent, and I should&#xD;
see him no more. Blessed Corolan! may thy life be&#xD;
not beset with the same misfortunes that have rendered&#xD;
your brother Falkner so unhappy!&#xD;
"Mother implored me to remain and share the love&#xD;
she bore her own Corie. Father wept, and entreated&#xD;
me not to leave him. But how could I remain near one&#xD;
I loved so well, knowing that our relations had changed!&#xD;
No, I could not stay;' I had no name, and I must win&#xD;
one.- I knew I possessed some talent. I had borne off,&#xD;
all the prizes and the first honor from forty boys who&#xD;
were contending for it with all their might. I could&#xD;
draw and paint, and, that failing, I might be an instruc-&#xD;
tor of youth. The world owe me a name and a living,&#xD;
thought I to myself, and I WILL carve out my own for-&#xD;

may then tell him that he is a foundling, but if C-&#xD;

"I PROMISED to receive assistance from my father with&#xD;
the conditions that he would receive back the amount&#xD;
he might advance me when I should desire to return it.&#xD;
I was not long in making up my mind as to my future&#xD;
course. I resolved to go to Italy and take a thorough&#xD;
course of instruction under the chief masters of the art&#xD;
of painting, in the principal galleries of the most noted&#xD;
cities of that beautiful region. I thought, by adopting&#xD;
this course, my mind might be freed from the great bur-&#xD;
den of grief that was consuming my vitals. I had al-&#xD;
lowed my mind to dwell at great length upon Italy. I&#xD;
had read the works of Plutarch, Petrarch and Dante,&#xD;
and I desired to behold the everlasting city whose fame&#xD;
will exist, through all time to come. Rome! Rome!&#xD;
what a world is spoken in that short word'! Two thou-&#xD;
sand years ago it was the Capital of the World. Cosar&#xD;
dwelt there in all his imperial pride; Cicero harangued&#xD;
the multitudes; the Scipios were renowned for their&#xD;
deeds of valor, and the Antonines gilded the imperial&#xD;
cities with their golden laws. I would-see the ruins of&#xD;
the Colliseum; J would see the tombs of the Scipios,&#xD;
and stand" upon the seven hills of the greatest city of&#xD;
ancient times.&#xD;

"Yes, I resolved to visit Italy, the birth-place of the&#xD;
fine arts; the nurse of genius, if not the cradle of lib-&#xD;
erty."&#xD;
"My preparations were soon made, and I bade adieu&#xD;
to my beloved foster parents. My father placed in my&#xD;
possession a check for one thousand dollars, upon one&#xD;
of the principal banking houses in the city of New&#xD;
York. He accompanied me to the nearest station, and&#xD;
I pressed his hand, returned his warm embrace and left&#xD;
him. I was strongly induced to go .by the University&#xD;
of M      and see Corolan; but how could I meet him!&#xD;
how could I part with him! My father must make the&#xD;
disclosure to him; I could not, I would not. His pres-&#xD;
ence might baulk me in my purpose; I could notsee him.&#xD;
He never would have permitted me to leave him.&#xD;
"II arrived at the great city of New York-a world&#xD;
in miniature, of its.elf. There Iwere so many attrac-&#xD;
tions in that city for one like myself, who had never&#xD;
traveled, that I was forced, against my will, to remain&#xD;
several weeks.&#xD;
"When I embarked upon one of the principal vessels&#xD;
that made regular trips to Europe, I bade farewell, as&#xD;
I supposed, to my'native land forever. I was in search&#xD;
of what I never expected to find-peace of mind. I&#xD;
was in search of a name-where should I find it? That&#xD;
was the main question.&#xD;

our own course; we cannot ever direct our own bark.&#xD;
The winds of prosperity or adversity may mock our ef-&#xD;
forts or may be propitious.&#xD;
"I visited London, that great babel of the world.   I&#xD;
stood upon Tower Hill and wept over the fates of Ral-&#xD;
eigh, Wallace and More! Every place of note in that&#xD;
great city was seen by me--some with indifference,&#xD;
others with interest.&#xD;

the minarets and towers of Paris with but few pangs of&#xD;
regret.&#xD;
"It was at Rome that I lingered; it was in the gal-&#xD;

"I sAID that it was with regret that I left Italy,&#xD;
where I spent so many happy hours in visiting the gal-&#xD;
leries of art. It is true, that the beautiful land of the&#xD;
sun possessed many charms for me; yet, I felt as if I&#xD;
were in seatch of something I could not find.' I had&#xD;
rowed with the gondoliers of Venice, and listened to&#xD;
their sweet songs and romantic stories; had stood in&#xD;
the decayed palaces of the mighty Cosars; had wan-&#xD;
dered by the banks of the Yellow Tiber; yet I could&#xD;
not, I did not, realize the dreams of my boyhood rela-&#xD;
tive to that sainted land.I&#xD;

els? From the land that Brutus tried to redeem from&#xD;

literature is to remain in obscurity and ignorance?  The&#xD;
very citizens of that once happy country have forgot-&#xD;

mature decay.1 The instructions of the swan of Mantua&#xD;
have been forgotten and neglected. Cimmerian dark-&#xD;

sway. Italy may never awae from her lethargy, but&#xD;
let us wait and hope.&#xD;
I stood upon the Alps, and head the thunder roar-&#xD;
ingb'and saw the lightning flashing beneath my feet. I&#xD;
gathered the vernal flowers at the base of those famous&#xD;
elevations, and saw the snows and experienced the chil-&#xD;
ling blasts of a polar region upon their summit. The&#xD;
armies of Napoleon had passed those gorges; the feet&#xD;
of Byron, Shelley, Keats-4and Goldsmith had pressed&#xD;
those glaciers, and should I dare to tread where mortal&#xD;
had ever ventured? No; fear has never been to this&#xD;
bosom known, though I have ever been esteemed as a&#xD;
quiet and unobtrusive man. I climbed the sumqiits of&#xD;
the Alps, where the Swiss cottager, accustomed ever to&#xD;
brave danger, durst not venture. I communed with the&#xD;
spirits'of those whom I imagined had ventured upon&#xD;
the most dangerous places. If wizzards, witches or&#xD;
hobgoblins existed otherwise than in the fancy of nerv-&#xD;
ous mortals, it would have been a source of pleasure for&#xD;
me to have welcomed the apparition. While standing&#xD;
upon one of the highest pinnacles in the world,,why did&#xD;
I long to cast myself down? It surely arose not from&#xD;
a desire to imitate the actions of a Curtius or Manfred,&#xD;
but all men have a strange desire to jump from high&#xD;
places.. I would, particularly advise the nervous man&#xD;
not to venture upon. high mountains; their desires may&#xD;
overcome their judgment.&#xD;

"Did I desire to dwell upon that summit forever? Did&#xD;
Lvish to exclude myself from the balance of my race,&#xD;
and end my days in those'fiozen and frightful solitudes ?&#xD;
I know not, I care not. My feelings were not as they&#xD;
were when I read of those %rial regions. I crossed the&#xD;
beautifullowland regions of la belle France, and my heart&#xD;
leaped afresh at the goodly sights I saw-a prosperous,&#xD;
happy people to all appearances. If their burdens&#xD;
seemed to sit lightly upon their necks. They sang to&#xD;
their tuneful harps, danced with light and merry hearts,&#xD;
trod the wine-presses, drank the health of their despotic&#xD;
rulers-yet they claim to be happy!&#xD;
"I had learned to speak the French language with&#xD;
fluency at the University, but I could scarcely make&#xD;
izyself intelligible to the Vendeeans. It is true, they&#xD;
were polite, clever and courteous; yet it is evident&#xD;
that they are only children of nature. France has&#xD;
changed her policy of Government so often, that it is&#xD;
impossible for the lower classes to keep pace with the'&#xD;
strides of conquerers and rulers. It is certain that the&#xD;
t~tiets of the first Napoleon obtained a greater sway&#xD;
over that fickle people than the fixed laws of any king&#xD;
siice th good times of Louis Quatorze.&#xD;
"I passed into Spain. I wandered by the banks of&#xD;
the famous Guadelquiver. I listened for the sounds of&#xD;
k tMagie JEolian harp to strike upon, mine ear-but I&#xD;
heard it not. The nymphs of poesy have even deserted&#xD;
those vine-clad groves. The Spanish maid hath truly&#xD;
hung her harp upon the willows, and its strings are all&#xD;

ROCKFORD-                 245&#xD;
broken, and dead the sound. Yet, lovely Spain, the&#xD;
memories of the past will ever cluster around thee, and&#xD;
render thee, as ever, an interesting nation. That beau-&#xD;
tiful land of the sun rejoices in more natural advantages&#xD;
than its sister States-still the populace are an ignor-&#xD;
rant, degraded, besotted race. But the grandees of&#xD;
Spain retain the pristine ,virtues "of their ancient corn-&#xD;

Gauls-some of them could yet contend with another&#xD;

"Upon the deep waters of the dark blue sea againtI&#xD;
embarked. As the noble ship cut the proud waves of&#xD;
the briny deep, I looked out upon that wild waste&#xD;
of waters and thought my life as cheerless as the pros-&#xD;
pect before me. The captain was a man who had passed&#xD;
the prime of life. He was tall and handsome, and withal&#xD;
very intelligent. He had been upon the sea nearly forty&#xD;
years. - He might have been sixty years of age, still&#xD;
he might have passed for a man of middle age had not&#xD;
his head assumed a hoary garb. Captain Walsingharm&#xD;
is a man whom to know is to love. His manners are&#xD;
mild, unassuming, and yet of the most fascinating char-&#xD;
acter. He took a peculiar fancy to me before I-had&#xD;
been aboard, of the vessel one day. He said I had a&#xD;
striking resemblance to a charming little boy who was&#xD;
the child of Governor Rockford. He related the cir-&#xD;
cumstance of hishaving given the boy a Newfoundland&#xD;
dog a great many years before,' when the father and&#xD;
mother were upon a visit to his ship. It is very singu-&#xD;

lar that I should be so interested in the fate of that boy,&#xD;
whom I, of course have never seen. I listened atten-&#xD;
tively to Captain Walsingham's narrative, and I could&#xD;
scarcely refrain from weeping when he had finished. I&#xD;
do wish I could see that lovely boy. I think they call&#xD;
him Sebastian. I wonder if he is as unhappy as I am?&#xD;
No, no, he cannot be; it is utterly impossible; no mor-&#xD;
tal knows how I suffer.. But to return to Captain Wal-&#xD;
singham. He seemed to love me. He praised my su-&#xD;
perior hight, extolled my music, and often when the sea&#xD;
was calm, and the sun was about to dip its fiery arc in&#xD;
the bosom of the distant waves, I would take my guitar,&#xD;
which I could at times strike' in tuneful, melody, and&#xD;
play for him some plaintive air. He had a fine voice,&#xD;
and sang delightfully. The tears would glisten in his&#xD;
eyes when I would happen to play a melody which re-&#xD;
vived the memories of the past.&#xD;
"Captain Walsingham gave me a large Newfound-&#xD;
land dog, because I took a fancy to him. He said he&#xD;
would give a thousand such dogs if he could only be-&#xD;
"hold Sebastian Rockford again. He has made his will,&#xD;
devising his whole estate to Sebastian, if he should ever&#xD;
be found. That boy must have been truly and wonder-&#xD;
fully interesting and lovely.. Walsingham was one of&#xD;
the first graduates of the University of M  . He&#xD;
seemed dearer to me for that reason. When shall I see&#xD;
him again ? Bless his soul! he would receive not a sous&#xD;
for my passage from Madrid to S   0."&#xD;
"I am here in this dull town, fully one hundred miles&#xD;

from father's residence. I long to go and throw myself&#xD;
in his arms, yet I cannot. Crofton is fully fifty miles&#xD;

[FROM FALKNER MANNING'S JOURNAL.]&#xD;
"THE night is dark, and my soul is sad. As I st&#xD;
here in my lonely chamber and listen to the merry peals&#xD;
of laughter that come from the street below, my mind&#xD;
reverts to the scenes of my college days, when Corolan&#xD;
was with me; when we were happy; when only the&#xD;
faint shade of a shadow had crossed the path of my&#xD;
life. I feel sad; yet why should I repine ?  It may be&#xD;
that the darkest days of my life have passed. The cur-&#xD;
tain of Time may soon ise and present different scenes&#xD;
to my view. I have tasted of the bitter dregs of the&#xD;
cup of despair, yet 'the future may have bliss in store&#xD;
for me. If I could only discover my dear father, who&#xD;
has grieved for me so bitterly, I would bid sorrows de-&#xD;
part, and fly to his arms. I would then go back to my&#xD;
foster father and ask his blessing. I love him too well&#xD;
to dwell near him, knowing that he is not my parent.&#xD;
Why did he not rear me as a foundling?  I should not&#xD;
have repined if the discovery had been made to me at&#xD;
an earlier day.&#xD;
"The only friend I have i'n this town is my New-&#xD;
foundland dog. He is lying at the door of my cham-&#xD;
ber, guarding it from intrusion. Last night while I&#xD;
&#xD;
was asleep, I was 'aroused from my slumbers by his&#xD;
barking. In a few moments I heard the sound of a&#xD;
footstep upon the stairs. I apprehended no danger-&#xD;
feared none; the word is not to be found in my vocabu-&#xD;
lary. The hand that writes these lines can trace with&#xD;
delicate pencil, the softest tint of an oriental landscape,&#xD;
and hurl the bar and quoit farther than any man with&#xD;
whom I have ever contended. I feared no danger-&#xD;
had no enemy in the, world that I knew of, yet the cau-&#xD;
tious tread of the intruder aroused my suspicions. In&#xD;
a moment after he had arrived at the head of the stair-&#xD;
case, the dog disputed his approach to the door of my&#xD;
chamber. I rose quickly from my bed and sprang to&#xD;
the assistance of my noble guardian. As I opened the&#xD;
door, by the light pf the moon I beheld a stalwart man,&#xD;
with long grisly beard and gray hair, standing to con-&#xD;
front me. I asked the cause of the intrusion; he spoke&#xD;
not, but, taking a knife from iis girdle, he rushed upon&#xD;
me. I seized his wrist, wrenched the knife from his&#xD;
hand, and hurled him down the steep stairway. Not de-&#xD;
siring to return to a contest so unequal, the assassin&#xD;

him with kidnapping me! I threatened to call the po-&#xD;

beheld the same man whom I had encountered and dis-&#xD;

was gone, and I turned to grapple with my quondam&#xD;

fired at me, but without effect. I disarmed and disabled&#xD;
him; he was at my mercy. I bade him depart, though&#xD;

[FROM MORTIMER.ROCKFORD'S JOURNAL.]&#xD;
"I HAvE lost my son; the light of the world is dark-&#xD;
ness to me. I am a man of sorrow and acquainted with&#xD;
grief. What is life to me, now that I have no Sebas-&#xD;
tian! My fine mansion and the wealth I have accumu-&#xD;
lated yield me no pleasure. It is true that my dear&#xD;
Josephine is left to me, but she is overwhelmed with&#xD;
sorrow. My hearth is desolate; the joy that lighted&#xD;
up my house has fled. Only twelve months have passed&#xD;
since his disappearance. I have reasons to believe that&#xD;
he lives, because I have received anonymous letters to&#xD;
that effect. I will start upon a tour of search for the&#xD;
boy to-morrow. The inhabitable globe shall be travers-&#xD;
ed or Sebastian shall be found. How bright and sweetly&#xD;
he smiled when I ordered the nurse to take him to the&#xD;
beach and see the wild waves dash against the shore!&#xD;
I knew not how much I loved him until he was lost to&#xD;
m~e and his dear mother."&#xD;
"Five years have passed swiftly away, yet I have&#xD;

Royston has had something to do with, his abduction.&#xD;
The police have discovered the robbers' retreat, and, as&#xD;
fate had directed, some of the ring-leaders have been&#xD;
discovered. Who would have believed that Hans Krem-&#xD;
ple and the painter Heinrich were implicated.! It seems&#xD;
that they have been engaged actively with the band for&#xD;
a number of years. The police had been directed to&#xD;
the Hermit's. retreat iy some travelers who had barely&#xD;
escaped with their, lives. The officers of the law con-&#xD;
. cealed themselves in the vicinity of the den and wit-&#xD;
nessed the assassination of a man one night, and Hans&#xD;
and Heinrich were the principal murderers. They and&#xD;
Pierre,' a French pirate, are now in jail awaiting their&#xD;
trial. I am engaged in the prosecution. Their trial&#xD;
will come on next week. The prison is guarded night&#xD;
and day, for fear of a rescue. Dame Elspeth and Dan-&#xD;
die Doane were examined, but, nothing of a criminal&#xD;
nature being found against them, they were discharged.&#xD;
They htve been forced to leave the country by the citi-&#xD;
zens, 'who have long suspected them.&#xD;
" What a pity it is that Harley and the notorious&#xD;
Royston, who has been at large under sentence of death,&#xD;
should not have been taken !"&#xD;
"I have just returned from the Court-house. The&#xD;
trial of Kremple, Heinrich and Pierre has terminated.&#xD;
There were many strange faces %in the Court-house;&#xD;
some suppose that, many of the- confederates of that&#xD;
lawless gang were present. Kremple received the sen-&#xD;
tence of death with more composure than I imagined&#xD;

he possessed. Heinrich and Pierre were in a joyful'&#xD;
glee when the Judge ordered them to rise and receive&#xD;
the sentence of death."&#xD;
"A large concourse of people thronged the town to-&#xD;
day. I have never seen a greater crowd in the town of&#xD;
Crofton. The thoroughfares were crowded to overflow-&#xD;
ing at an early hour. When the jailor delivered Hans&#xD;
Kremple, Heinrich and the pirate Pierre into the custody&#xD;
of the Sheriff, the jolly crowd made the welkin ring&#xD;
with their cheers. Some of the boys asked Hans if he&#xD;
didfnot desire to sell them a patent for making saws,-&#xD;
and teach them the art of erasing names from jewelry.&#xD;
"While on. his way to the place of execution, Hans&#xD;
stole the golden cross from the priest, and when he was&#xD;
swung off he held the purse of one of the by-standers&#xD;
between his thievish fingers! Ueinrich and Pierre died&#xD;
sullenly, but there was much merriment over.the eleva-&#xD;
tion of the inimitable Hans Kremple.  Hans would&#xD;
have made a safe companion to have taken a sea voy-&#xD;
agf ith; for, as the poor fellow was surely born to be&#xD;
hanged, he might never have feared death by the waves."&#xD;
"Twelve years have passed since the abduction of my&#xD;
sainted Sebastian. I have not yet despaired of seeing&#xD;
hih again. We have adopted a lovely little girl of ten&#xD;
years of age. If Sebastian does not return she will be&#xD;
heir to my broad estate. I have lately been to the town&#xD;
of 1M-- to see Elfrida. I saw one of the most hand-&#xD;
some and amiable boys in the stage I ever beheld. He&#xD;
reminded me so much of my lost Sebastian, that I felt&#xD;
&#xD;
L&#xD;
V&#xD;
&#xD;
a strange fondness for him. He said his name was&#xD;
Falkner M:anning, and his father lived at Oak-Lawn.&#xD;
He had a little brother with him, over whom he was&#xD;
exercising parental care. That boy will yet arrive at&#xD;
distinction."&#xD;
"I have just returned from the University of M~ ---.&#xD;
I delivered the diplomas and prizes to the "graduating'&#xD;
class. It was with much pleasure that I conferred the&#xD;
honor upon Falkner Manning. He is the most distin-&#xD;
guished young man of my acquaintance. He bore his&#xD;
honors so meekly, and reminded me so much of myself&#xD;
when I was of his age, that had I not known that he&#xD;
was the son of Theodore Manning, Esq., I would have&#xD;
claimed him for Sebastian,&#xD;

CHAPTER XXXIV.&#xD;
[FROM THE JOURNAL OF MORTIMER RoCKFORD.]&#xD;
"IT is strange that I should have this load of sorrow&#xD;
to encumber me so long. I have grieved over the loss.of&#xD;
Sebastian for more than twenty years,.still I shed tears&#xD;
when I think of the beautiful face, the, flowing auburn&#xD;
ringlets and the sparkling blue eyes of the beloved boy.&#xD;
I have hopes- yet that my son may be restored to me,&#xD;
having received several letters of late from an anon-&#xD;
ymous author that Sebastian was living, totally uncon-&#xD;
scious of the names of his parents. It is strange that&#xD;
the individual who holds my secret within his, breast&#xD;
should make no revelation to me.&#xD;
"I have heard nothing from Royston for several&#xD;
years. He was recognized at one time and arrested.&#xD;
The officers who were conveying him to. this place for&#xD;
the purpose of confining him in prison, were attacked&#xD;
by members of his desperate band, and the prisoner was&#xD;
rescued from custody.&#xD;
" I firmly believe that Royston is the person that stole&#xD;
Sebastian, assisted by some of his lawless clan. Since&#xD;
the execution of Hans Kremple, I have called to mind&#xD;
the strange individual I saw with him on the evening&#xD;
Sebastian was abducted. I believe, now,' that it was&#xD;

ROCKFORD.                  25T&#xD;
Royston himself in, disguise. If Royston desires a&#xD;
compromise, and will restore my son to me, he shall be&#xD;
rewarded with wealth. I am the Governor of the State,&#xD;
and will pardon him if a petition is presented from a&#xD;
respectable source."&#xD;
"I have lately heard of the death of my aged aunt&#xD;
Margery. May the sod rest lightly upon her breast,&#xD;
and the flowers bloom sweetly around her sacred -grave.&#xD;
Her faii' daughters have made exemplary wives, (thanks&#xD;
to the good advice of their mother.) Mr. Watson and&#xD;
Mr. Judson were happy in their selection of partners.&#xD;
They have frequently visited. me. The party I gave&#xD;
them when Sebastian was a child, will ever be remem-&#xD;
bered by me. They were so happy; we were all happy."&#xD;
"There are some things I delight to remember; and&#xD;
as their scenes come up froni the mist of long forgotten&#xD;
years, I put forth my hand to draw aside the curtain of&#xD;
memory, as if about to gaze upon a picture which once&#xD;
had the powers of fascination. Yet, I pause and reflect&#xD;
ere I draw aside the veil that divides me from the scenes&#xD;
of former years, as if I feared the change would pro-&#xD;
duce disappointment. How often have-I imagined that&#xD;
the house in which I passed the first years of my exist,-&#xD;
ence equalled in splendor some noble old Gothic struc-&#xD;
ture, yet a visit to the old homestead, which is scarcely&#xD;
two miles from my own house, dispelled the illusion. It&#xD;
is strange I had noe'visited the house since the death of&#xD;
my father compelled my mother to leave it and dwell in&#xD;
a cheaper cottage. How changed, thought I, is the&#xD;

scene; but still, time had, dealt gently with the old&#xD;
house, and memory revealed every picture to my ad-&#xD;
miring gaze.&#xD;
"In youth, our admiration of the most trivial objects&#xD;
is only equaled by the pleasure we experience during&#xD;
all those golden moments which come no more in after&#xD;
life. Ourpleasures die as the flowers, but they live em-&#xD;
balmed in our memory like Some departed hope, which&#xD;
may return with the soft rays of Spring. Our tastes&#xD;
change; the flowers and birds that once delighted us,&#xD;
yield us no pleasure, because the associations which&#xD;
made them dear are far away.&#xD;
"I stood beneath the tall oak, where my dear father&#xD;
used to sit, and, as I fancied I could see the good old&#xD;
man reclining in his easy chair beneath the umbrageous&#xD;
boughs of the graceful tree whose branches were the&#xD;
homes of tbze tuneful choristers, I brushed away the&#xD;
tears that voluntarily4dimmed my eyes. I hope that I&#xD;
may meet my father again, in that better world, where&#xD;
farting is never known-where sorrows come not-&#xD;
where pain is felt not. Is it not a tender mercy, that&#xD;
Earth is not the abiding plabe of the saints, but that a&#xD;
holier and happier sphere is prepared for them by the&#xD;
wise Ruler of the Universe ?  Death is only the gate&#xD;
through which we must pass to reach that Elysian plain&#xD;
that is watered by the river of Life. How solemn it is&#xD;
to visit the family cemetery, and see the graves of de-&#xD;
parted friends! Yonder is the grave of a man who was&#xD;
interred' when I was a lad. I remember how I shud-&#xD;
dered and clung to the skirts of my mother's dress as&#xD;

ROOKFORD.                  259&#xD;
the coffin was lowered into the deep and solemn grave,&#xD;
and I heard the rumbling soundof the fatal clod falling&#xD;
upon the frame-work of the vault. He had died in the&#xD;
spring time of life, having hastened his death by draughts&#xD;
from the wine cup. The old spring is down yonder, be-&#xD;
neath the hill, surrounded with sycamore trees. It was&#xD;
a sacred spot in my boyhood's days, 4nd the trysting&#xD;
place of many happy thoughts. If .I had a pleasant&#xD;
book to read, it was thither I hastened. It was there&#xD;
that my mother used to sit and tell me' of the joys of&#xD;
Heaven. Fifty years have fled since I stooped to im-.&#xD;
bibe the sweet waters of that old moss spring ;. but I&#xD;
must cease-my soul is sad.&#xD;
I know not why my mind dwells so much upon Falk-&#xD;
ner Manning, who received the first honor at the Uni-&#xD;
versity of M -, six years since. I have learned that&#xD;
he has lately returned from a visit-to -the Old World,&#xD;
whither he had gone to copy the paintings of the mas-&#xD;
ters of the Art. Captain Walsingham was here ,yes-&#xD;
terday, and informed me that young Manning was a&#xD;
passenger in his vessel. Walsingham was so much de-&#xD;
lighted with him that he gave him a large Newfoundland&#xD;
dog, similar to the one he presented to Sebastian. Poor&#xD;
Carlo sleeps at the beach near the spot where his young&#xD;
master was stolen, and a plain marble slab marks, his&#xD;
resting place. Jupe reposes by his side. How they&#xD;
loved Sebastian! they grieved at his loss seemingly as&#xD;
much as we did.&#xD;

and my features have not assumed the appearance. of&#xD;
old age. Josephine looks young yet, though grief has&#xD;
depressed her spirits. Elfrida has been a faithful child,&#xD;
and a great source of comfort to my sorrow-stricken&#xD;
wife. I know not why she has never married. I some-&#xD;
times think that she has refused so many opportunities&#xD;
of marrying from the love she. entertains for Josephine&#xD;
and niie.  She says she never intends to leave us. Bless&#xD;
her soul! she lights up our benighted hearth, and con-&#xD;
soles us, to a great extent, for our losses. I oftentimes&#xD;
think she loves Manning, yet she has never revealed the&#xD;
secret to me. She seems interested in him, and often&#xD;
joins me in extolling his merits. Josephine goes out&#xD;
upon the beach and casts many long and sorrowful glances&#xD;
upon the sea-indulging the vain hope that every home&#xD;
returning vessel may restore Sebastia to her arms."&#xD;
"I have just returned from the seat of Government,&#xD;
having been called thither on official business. When&#xD;
iny term of office expires, I shall not again be a candi-&#xD;
date for re-election-as I am tired of public life, and&#xD;
am heartily disgusted with the fawning and flattery of&#xD;
office seekers.' I shall retire to the privacy of my own&#xD;
peaceful home, and spend the remnant of my days in&#xD;
the shades of private life. The world is a theatre, up-&#xD;
on whose stage are enacted many strange scenes. The&#xD;
curtain rises amid the cheers of -the impatient audi-&#xD;
ence: a tragedy is performed, and the idle and listless&#xD;
laugh when a- chief is slain; the sentimental young man&#xD;
may shed-tears at the pathetic passages of a comedy."&#xD;

CHAPTER XXXV.&#xD;
[FROM THE JOURNAL OF ELFRIDA MORDAUNT.]&#xD;
THE fear has almost expired, and I shall soon see&#xD;
Falkner. I have not yet told Mr. Rockford that he&#xD;
was coming; I have never informed him I possessed any&#xD;
than feelings of friendship for Falkner. I went to Mrs.&#xD;
Rockford's room one morning for the purpose of making&#xD;
the confession, but my lips faltered, and my tongue was&#xD;
silent. Falkner will soon be here, and my cup of bliss&#xD;
will be full. I think he bears a striking resemblance to&#xD;
the portrait of the beautiful Sebastian that hangs in the&#xD;
parlor. His hair and eyes correspond exactly with Se-&#xD;
bastian's, though the curls of Falkner may be a shade&#xD;
darker. - Yes! yes! I am too happy! Falkner will&#xD;
bless my sight ere ohe more month shall have elapsed.&#xD;
His last letter was so full of love that I pressed it a&#xD;
thousand times to my lips. It is now in my bosom,&#xD;
where it shall remain until I see him. I have placed it&#xD;
next to my heart, which beats fond and fervently for&#xD;
him, and him only. I know he loves me tenderly; I&#xD;
know he is faithful and true to all his pledges. I love&#xD;
him the more tenderly because he loves me for myself&#xD;
alone. I told him that'I had no fortune; that I should&#xD;
never consent to receive the estate that belongs to Se-&#xD;

&#xD;
bastian, or anf portion of it, as he might be restored&#xD;
to his father. Yes, he loves me for myself and this&#xD;
faithful heart will cease to beat ere my love for him&#xD;
shall grow cold."&#xD;
"Ah, me! IJam so miserable! Fate hath decreed&#xD;
that I should be unhappy. All is dark and dreary;&#xD;
the future hath no bright hopes for me; the day no sun-&#xD;
shine. I recall the lines of the poet of Nature to mem-&#xD;
Had we never loved so kindly,&#xD;
Had we never loved so blindly,&#xD;
Never met and never parted,&#xD;
Then we'd -not been broken-hearted.'&#xD;
"I cannot blame him; I cannot reproach him; I can-&#xD;
not cease to love him.  Oh! the fatal letter! it came&#xD;
this morning by post.. It has plunged me in a sea of&#xD;
sorrow. The noble, generous Falkner is not less hap-&#xD;
py than his miserable Elfrida.  How his heart must be&#xD;
troubled! how his mind must be tortured, to leavethre&#xD;
good man whom he so fondly loves! He has released&#xD;
me from every obligation, but that is cruel; I would&#xD;
have loved him more tenderly-for his misfortunes. Sup-&#xD;
pose he is a foundling, he is none the less noble-none&#xD;
the less dear to me for that. He is upon the broad&#xD;
waters of the ocean ere this, and is borne far away from&#xD;
her Who adores him."&#xD;
" Three years have passedsince I saw Falkner-three&#xD;
long years, filled with bitterness. My secret has been&#xD;
kept within my own breast, and there it will remain for-&#xD;
ever. .I cannot think he will ever return. He is so&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
ROCKFORD.&#xD;
&#xD;
263&#xD;
&#xD;
pure, so sensitive, so refined, that he wrongly imagines&#xD;
he is disgraced. He will never return, I fear; he will&#xD;
pass his life amid solitude; he will delight to remain in&#xD;
obscurity. If I could only see him; if I could only&#xD;
speak to him, it would lessen this burden of grief at my&#xD;
heart. No! no! I must pine in solitude. I must reject&#xD;
the addresses of every one as I did those of H-.-.&#xD;
"Mr. Rockford has beeh elected Governor, and I am&#xD;
to go to the Capital to spend the winter during the ses-&#xD;
sion of the Legislature. Mr. Rockford looks so noble,&#xD;
and is so little elated at his distinguished honors, that&#xD;
I am astonished. He would give all his wealth to have&#xD;
Sebastian restored to him."&#xD;
"I have just learned that Falkner has returned! he&#xD;
is near me! he is in Crofton! Shall I see him? Has&#xD;
he forgotten his Elfrida?  No, never! never!' If I&#xD;
.knew that he loves me yet, an eternity of bliss would&#xD;
be centered in a moment.&#xD;
- "Be still, my throbbing heart, be still! Elfrida is&#xD;
unhappy ! Elfrida is happy!&#xD;

CHAPTER XXXVi.&#xD;
[FROM FALKNER MANNING'S JOURNAL.]&#xD;
"WrEN I had resolved to go to Crofton, I commenced&#xD;
making preparations for the journey. My trunks were&#xD;
quickly packed, my bills paid, and I left the place, hav-&#xD;
ing hired conveyance and a driver. As we proceeded&#xD;
along the road that extends through the beautiful coun-&#xD;
try, Iwvas forcibly reminded of the home of my child-&#xD;
hood, and I wept. My own beautiful land of the South&#xD;
is not less lovely than the most smiling portions of Italy&#xD;
or France. The leafy magnolias, which bear the sweet-&#xD;
est flowers that ever bloomed; the stately pines, whose&#xD;
stalwart branches have withstood the storms of an hun-&#xD;
dred winters; the graceful sycamores and elms; the&#xD;
live-oaks and cypress, beautify those never-ending&#xD;
groves, while the vine, the lowly shrub and honey-&#xD;
suckle fill every place'with flowers and fruits. Was&#xD;
the land of Beulah more lovely in the eyes of the Is-&#xD;
raelites than the beautiful vine-clad land 6f the South&#xD;
is to us?  Mountain and valley, hill and plain, river,&#xD;
brook, spring and fountain present one continued round&#xD;
of beauty and interest. Who that is born at the South&#xD;
would care to dwell in the frozen regions of the North?&#xD;

shadows across my path. I saw several men skulking&#xD;
behind the trees, endeavoringto shun observation. I&#xD;
directed the driver to be upon his guard, and force the&#xD;
horses to their utmost speed, if an attempt should be&#xD;
made to attack and rob us.&#xD;
"I was not kept long in suspense. We had proceeded&#xD;
scarcely another mile on our journey, when a man,&#xD;
mounted upon a charger that had the appearance of&#xD;
having been ridden very hard, advanced to the carriage&#xD;
and ordered the driver not 'to proceed another step at&#xD;
the peril of his life. The robber wore a mask, but from&#xD;
his form and the appearance of his gray hair, which his&#xD;
hood failed to conceal, I easily recognized Harley, or&#xD;
the ruffian whom I had twice :before encountered  I&#xD;
demanded of him the cause of my being thus rudely&#xD;
stopped upon the highway, at the same, time o-dering&#xD;
the postillion to drive on. The highwayman drew a&#xD;
pistol and discharged itat the head of the 'postillion,&#xD;
who, falling from the box a moment sooner than the re-&#xD;
port was heard, escaped with his life. I sprang from&#xD;
the carriage and went to the assistance of the cowardly&#xD;
fellow, who was nearly insensible from fear. He was&#xD;
trembling in every joint of hiscowardly frame. When&#xD;
I raised him from the ground he could scarcely stand.&#xD;
Four men emerged from the woods and awaited the&#xD;
commands of the leader, who sat upon his horse, a cool&#xD;
spectator of the scene. I -knew my own strength, and&#xD;
did not fear those who were directed by the leader to&#xD;
force me to submit. I drew out a pistol and fired it at&#xD;
the foremost man. He fell instantly, but I was closely&#xD;

pressed by the others, who were within arm's' reach of&#xD;
me. I smote one -of then with my heavy stick, which&#xD;
felled him to the ground. I had a desperate encounter&#xD;
with the remaining two, inflicting upon them several&#xD;
severe wounds with my knife. 1Two men rode up to my&#xD;
assistance and the graceless assassins fled, leaving be-&#xD;
hind them the robber whom I had shot. f was bleed-&#xD;
ing from several severewounds I had received during&#xD;
the combat.&#xD;
"I was glad to discover that the man was not dead.&#xD;
I placed him in the carriage and looked around for the&#xD;
postillion, who was lying at a little distance from us&#xD;
with his face to the ground. I raised him up, telling&#xD;
him there was no danger; he slowly recovered his&#xD;
senses and went back to his position on the box. I&#xD;
thanked those who had come to my assistance, and they&#xD;
accompanied me to the nearest-house, where my wounds&#xD;
and those of the robber were dressed. The physicians&#xD;
said that the man was seriously, but not mortally,&#xD;

CHAPTER XXXVII.&#xD;
"Father'! Corie!" said Falkner, as he hastened to&#xD;
embrace Mr. Manning and Corolan, as thby stepped&#xD;
into his studio, "welcome to my poor apartment. Is&#xD;
mother with you?"&#xD;
Mr. Manning pressed Falkner to his bosom, and shed&#xD;
tears of joy. Corolan wept upon the neck of his be-&#xD;
loved Falkner. It was long before they were sufficiently&#xD;
composed to reply to the interrogatories of the painter,&#xD;
who was just finishing a portrait of Governor Rockford.&#xD;
"Falkner," said Mr. Manning, "you have been in&#xD;
Crofton nearly six months, yet you have not. written&#xD;
one line to me. I was only. made acquainted with your&#xD;
residence by accident. A traveler came to my house,&#xD;
and I gave him entertainment. He was very commu-&#xD;
nicative, and I became interested in his conversation.&#xD;
I learned from him that he had witnessed the encounter&#xD;
between a young man by the name lof Manning and&#xD;
several highwaymen. From his'description, I was cer-&#xD;
tain that it was my own self-exiled Falkner. He said&#xD;
that his companion assisted him in extricating you from&#xD;
a hazardous combat, thpugh. he was confident that you&#xD;
would have conquered them all. The man upon, horse-&#xD;
back had taken no part in the fight, from causes un-&#xD;

known to my informant. Corolan and myself made-&#xD;
irhmediate preparations to come and see you.  40&#xD;
"We were surprised to receive a visit from Rodman&#xD;
-whom you remember-on the day we ahad set apart&#xD;
to commence our journey. He is strangely altered, and&#xD;
time has not dealt gently with him. There is some-&#xD;
thing mysterious about the man I cannot fathom. He&#xD;
said that the time had come for him to reveal the secret&#xD;
of your birth. He directed me to pack up the articles&#xD;
which were found with you, (when Heaven directed the_&#xD;
person, as it seemed, to leave you at my room door,) 'and&#xD;
carry them with me. He could restore you to your pa-&#xD;
rents beyond a doubt. He has not revealed the name&#xD;
of your father. Are you prepared to see him, Falkner ?"&#xD;
"I am," said the boy. "I would rather learn the&#xD;
name of my father, and rush into his arms-though he&#xD;
were the poorest man in the Universe-than remain in&#xD;
suspense. But whoever he is, I cannot, I shall not love&#xD;
him more than I do you. I have wronged you, my&#xD;
father, in not writing to you, but I could not."&#xD;
"How you have grown, my son; you were tall, but&#xD;
rather slender, when you left upon your European tour.&#xD;
Now you are almost Herculean. Corie is scarcely half&#xD;
your size. Your form is similar to that of Governor.&#xD;
Rockford."&#xD;
"Father," said Falkner, "when shall I see Rodman ?&#xD;
Did he tell you that I had encountered him and de-&#xD;
nounced him for his perfidy?"/&#xD;
"He is in town now, Falkner, but preferred stopping&#xD;
at an obscure hotel near the wharf. He would give me&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
ROCKFORD.&#xD;
&#xD;
269&#xD;
&#xD;
no explanation of his preferring to take that course.-&#xD;
To-morrow morning he will meet us in this room, where&#xD;
the mystery will be cleared up."&#xD;
Falkner had held Corolan in his strong arms during&#xD;
the conversation with his, father, as if he had been a&#xD;
child.&#xD;
Corolan was small of stature but had improved much&#xD;
in appearance since last we saw him. He was slightly&#xD;
below the medium height, though very strong for a man&#xD;
of his size. His beard was long, and gave him a manly&#xD;
appearance. Falkner was slightly above six feet in&#xD;
height, and as finely formed as the statue of'Apollo.&#xD;
"Falkner, my own brother-I shall never call you&#xD;
by another name-you must return home and live with&#xD;
us, and share ,our 'estate. You must never leave us&#xD;
again. Put up the brush, throw away the paints, break&#xD;
all the pencils, and go with us-to the home of our happy&#xD;
childhood. It was cruel in you to,-leave us and remain&#xD;
away so long.. My dearest wife will be-so glad to wel-&#xD;
come you. Mother is almost frantic to see you. I have&#xD;
been married two years, Falkner. 'Our little boy bears&#xD;
your name; do go with us and see him."&#xD;
"I will go," said Falkner, "but I cannot promise to&#xD;
remain. I will tell you my future plans after I have&#xD;
seen Rodman. How is dominie Heflin?"&#xD;
"He sleeps the sleep of death," said the father. "He&#xD;
often spoke of you during his illness, and shed many&#xD;
tears at your departure."&#xD;
"Where is the chair' Mr. Rodman gave you, broth-&#xD;
er ?" said Corie.&#xD;

&#xD;
"I have it still, Corie ; but he shall receive it back&#xD;
when I see him. The ungrateful man is not worthy of&#xD;
respect; besides, he is a robber, or he would not have&#xD;
been an associate of Harley's. It is reported and be-&#xD;
lieved here that Harley was among the number of those&#xD;
who were slain in a skirmish with the police a few weeks&#xD;
since."&#xD;
The father and sons spent the whole day in conversa-&#xD;
tio1 and'when they retired to their beds-at the -hotel&#xD;
it was late. They retired to dream, perhaps, of what&#xD;
the morrow might disclose.&#xD;
The lamps were lighted in the stately mansion of&#xD;
Mr. Rockford. The reader is familiar wifth the place&#xD;
and it needs no further description than we have given of&#xD;
it heretofore. The Governor was seated with his wife&#xD;
and Elfrida at the supper-table. Elfrida had just in-&#xD;
formed them that she was the affianced bride of Falk-&#xD;
ner Manning, the poor artist. The Governor. said he&#xD;
would not withhold his consent. The conversation was&#xD;
broken off by a loud knock at the door. Mr. Rockford&#xD;
went to the .door and beheld an aged and infirm man,&#xD;
who craved an audience with his excellence. He led&#xD;
theiman mto the library, and desired him to take a seat.&#xD;
"4You had a little son stolen from you about twenty-&#xD;
three years ago," said the man.  "Have you heard&#xD;
from him of late years ?&#xD;
"I have not," said Rockford, becoming interested.-&#xD;
"Pray keep me not in suspense. Tell me instantly, in&#xD;
the name of God, do you know aught of Sebastian ?&#xD;
Speak, man, does he live?"&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
." He lives," said the man; "and you may see him&#xD;
soon, upon conditions. Do you remember one Carl&#xD;
Royston, who made his escape from prison on the night&#xD;
previous to the day set apart for his execution?"&#xD;
"1I do," said Rockford, "and I have long supposed&#xD;
that he was engaged in the.abduction of the boy."&#xD;
"He was," said the man. "He told me that he did&#xD;
it for revenge. He has seen the error of hi ways.-&#xD;
'The last one -.of his band has suffered death, and he&#xD;
alone remains. He cannot present himself before you&#xD;
except you will sign this instrument. When that is&#xD;
done he will conduct you to your son."&#xD;
"The Governor took the instrument and examined it,&#xD;
(which was a form drawn up for the pardon of Carl&#xD;
Royston, under sentence of death for the murder of&#xD;
Jonathan Winslow.)&#xD;
"I do not know whether I ought to sign this or not,&#xD;
sir. I am the Governor of the State, and Sebastian&#xD;
is my own. son. I. am willing to give this man Roys-&#xD;
ton thousands of dollars if he will restore my son, but&#xD;
I ought not to sign his pardon. What is' your name,&#xD;
old man ? you look feeble."&#xD;
Mr. Rockford ordereda glass of wine to be brought,&#xD;
and the old man drank it. He seemed much revived,&#xD;
and resumed the conversation.&#xD;
" It may not int rest you to learn my name. I came&#xD;
upon an errand o mercy. Royston will not receive&#xD;
your gold. Tf you do not sign the pardon you may&#xD;
never recover your son.'&#xD;
"When shall I see Sebastian if the pardon is sign-&#xD;
ed ?  said "A excited Governor.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
"To-morrow," said the man.&#xD;
"Hand St to me," said the Governor; "I would do&#xD;
it were it the last act of my life."&#xD;
The name of Mortimer Rockford was affixed to the&#xD;
instrument in an instant.&#xD;
"But I must keep the pardon in my hands until I see&#xD;
the man Royston himself."&#xD;
"You can have the opportunity to-night, sir," rejoin-&#xD;
the man.&#xD;
"Then let us go instantly to him," said the Governor,&#xD;
"moments seem like hours to me."&#xD;
"Royston stands before your excellency," said the&#xD;
man, who, pulling of his gray wig, and freeing himself'&#xD;
from the long black wrapper, revealed the person of&#xD;
Conrad Rodman, or Carl Royston.-&#xD;
Morning came. The day was beautiful. The sun&#xD;
shone in splendor, and the house of the Governor was&#xD;
thronged, as usual, with early visitors. Rockford excus-&#xD;
ed himself, requesting his friends to remain with his&#xD;
wife and Elfrida  He and Royston (who had remained&#xD;
with him during the night) left the house and proceeded&#xD;
to the town.&#xD;
"Let me step into the studio of the painter one mo-&#xD;
ment, Mr. Royston," said the Governor, "and I will at-&#xD;
tend you.- He has been painting my portrait."&#xD;
When Rockford entered the room of the artist, he&#xD;
was surprised to see two strangers with Falkner.&#xD;
"Mr. Manning, I am glad to meet with you again&#xD;
I scarcely recognized you. This is your younger son.&#xD;
&#xD;
ROCKFORD-                 273&#xD;
I have been surprised that your son Falkner, here,&#xD;
should have taken it into his head to be a painter.-&#xD;
Have you failed in business, sir, that Falkner was driven&#xD;
to this expedient ?  He informs me that he is penni-&#xD;
less."&#xD;
Mr. Manning looked sad, Falkner blushed, and Cor-&#xD;
olan was confounded.&#xD;
"Your excellency will excuse me if I give you an&#xD;
evasive answer," said the good farmer.&#xD;
At that moment Royston, who had remained in the&#xD;
sti-eet, entered.&#xD;
"I have come according to appointment, Mr. Man-&#xD;
ning," said Rodman. "Falkner, I hope you will for-&#xD;
give me. I can repair every injury I have ever done&#xD;
you.I&#xD;
"How is this, sir," said Rockford, "do you know&#xD;
anything of this young man? Let us proceed upon our&#xD;
expedition."&#xD;
"I will soon explain, sir,." said Royston, (or Rod,&#xD;
man) this is the PLACE and this is the TIME to make the&#xD;
revelation. Mr. Manning, yof will please produce the&#xD;
clothes of the boy "-&#xD;
"What boy---what clothes !" said the excited Gov-&#xD;
ernor.&#xD;
"The clothes of YOUR SON."&#xD;
Why should this gentleman have them?" said the&#xD;
Governor.&#xD;
Will your excellendy please remain quiet a few min-&#xD;
utes.  I will soon explain every point."&#xD;
When the clothes were unwrapped, and- the gold chain&#xD;

&#xD;
was held up to view, Mr. Rockford sprang forward and&#xD;
grasped them nervously.&#xD;
"Sebastian's suit-Sebastian's chain! where is my&#xD;
boy " said the Governor, as he fell to the floor. Falk-&#xD;
ner raised the stately form of the prostrate Rockford,&#xD;
and laid him upon his couch and bathed his head with&#xD;
water. )Vhe he revived, he implored Royston to con-&#xD;
duct him-to-his son instantly.&#xD;
"Falkner, behold your father! Mr. Rockford, receive&#xD;
back your stolen child!".&#xD;
The Governor sprang from the couch and embraced&#xD;
FAalkner with wild delight. Falkner could scarcely re-&#xD;
alize his happiness. Mr. Manning appeared as if in a&#xD;
dream. Corolain 'embraced Falkner and wept tears of&#xD;
joy. Mr. Manning related to Mr. Rockford all the&#xD;
partirnlars of the, early history of Falkner, with which&#xD;
the meagleriefam~iliar.&#xD;
"I have two fathers, now," said the artist. "My&#xD;
love for the.h'ahli be-the same."&#xD;
a             tWe'a   s ay-here another moment," said the&#xD;
Cverni       W   m-st hasten to mother, my own Se&#xD;
bastion. Coie, my dear friend, Mr. Manning; come,&#xD;
Coroad' Roystn, all. We must go and convey the&#xD;
news to Josephine."&#xD;
They left the office of Sebastian (we shall call hiim by&#xD;
his omw name) and proceeded to the house.&#xD;
"I wonder why Mr. Rockford is bringing so many&#xD;
friends home with him?  It is just like him-he often&#xD;
brings a. dozen with him without having' given me warn,&#xD;
ing. Elfrida, do you, ee Mr. Manning with them?"&#xD;
&#xD;
U&#xD;
&#xD;
ROOKFORD.&#xD;
do, said the young lady; "and I must not re-&#xD;
main here, but go and adjust my hair-.&#xD;
Mr. Rockford'entered hastily, followed by Sebastian,&#xD;
who was the only one of the party that could keep pace&#xD;
with the lengthy strides of the excited and happy Gov&#xD;
ernor, who, approaching the place where Mrs. Rockford&#xD;
was standing, said:&#xD;
"Oh! Josephine, God has heard our prayer. Sebas-&#xD;
tian, behold your mother!"&#xD;
We must let the curtain fall upon this scene.&#xD;
Crofton has improved wonderfully since. tlhe abduc-&#xD;
tion of Sebastian. Samuel Culverhouse. and Dorothy&#xD;
have been sleeping for, many years under the sod.  Jo&#xD;

rusha Smith. He named his first child Joachim Napo&#xD;

edge of the classics, but it is hoped that he may do so&#xD;
before he dies.&#xD;
There was a grand festival at the hoou.ok-&#xD;

stored to his father.  Captain WalsinghaInVas there&#xD;
to give away the bride. Corolan and his wife and Mr.&#xD;

altar.&#xD;
