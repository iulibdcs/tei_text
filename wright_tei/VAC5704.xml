            <p>Should sentiments breathed in the following pages awaken within our hearts a deeper interest in freedom's cause, or serve to cement more firmly the golden chain of love which binds humanity to sublime truths, and the holy alliance between the finite and the Infinite, grateful to God will be the writer, for the satisfaction that a little good may arise from an humble effort.</p>

               <p>Dark grew the western sky, and gathering clouds folded their huge pinions more closely around the electric fires within. The arched vault was lurid with the crimson flow that streaked the horizon at the twilight hour.</p> 
               <p>Rumbling thunders shook the battlements of heaven, and the voice of old ocean wailed and trembled beneath their awful roar. Fiercely the elements combined their innate powers, threatening destruction upon all the weeping earth. But the voice of God walked upon the waters, and the glorious sun burst<pb n="8-9" xml:id="VAC5704-00000005"/> forth, bidding the world sweet peace and tranquil rest. The following day would behold a grand re-union of the warring elements of minds eternal, or a final dissolution of peace and happiness, and a total demolition of liberty and power. What wonder that the firmament of heaven is shaken, when the earth reels and totters beneath the tornado of dissolution?</p> 
               <milestone n="*   *   *   *   *   *   *   *" unit="typography"/> 
               <p>Anon two voices are heard in conflict: "To-morrow we must part forever, my beautiful Nora, my dearly beloved. Thou wilt make no concessions, because thy noble father, thou sayest, when invested with the need of power, will, at all hazards, carry out the principles of Washington and Jefferson; making liberty and human rights the awe-inspiring theme of the nation.</p> 
               <p>"His faith in his ability to maintain the principles of our forefathers, and perpetuate the Union, will prove to be 'faith without works.' He may, by chance, save the cargo and the passengers, yet the old ship, the Constitution, must sink, a total wreck. He is a stern man, thy father, my Nora, but he shall yet feel the force of my hatred of his principles.</p> 
               <p>"And we must part! God knows how it rends my heart to repeat those cold and cruel words. Heaven bears witness that I have loved thee long and fervently-loved as mortal man never loved before. Thou hast been my light, my life. My every thought twined around thee as some beautiful and divine presence, filling my soul with happiness and bliss; teaching me to believe that, let my will be what it may, no power on earth our kindred souls could sever.</p> 
               <pb n=""/> 
               <p>"Alas, alas! that the sun of abolition should shine with such burning rays upon the horizon of slavery as to dry up the ocean of affection which has hitherto rolled in glorious unison between us. Alas, dear Nora, I fear our separation will prove a dire calamity to both-a final overthrow of all our peace and prosperity-and where, indeed, will end our dreaded woes?</p> 
               <p>"Dear Nora, thou art still silent. Hast thou no bright hope to whisper; no language of love to breathe to my despairing soul?"</p> 
               <p>Wise man paused to listen once again, ere she might perhaps be to him no more a "good genius," to the counsels of his "better half," hoping to hear from her lips such deep and humble concessions as would justify him in remaining with her in the bonds of wedlock, until he could regain his former influence over her, and subdue more effectually her kindred.</p> 
               <p>When wilt thou learn, O man! woman was created to wear the form of an angel, so long as thy heart is filled with kindness towards her. But when thou dost seek to <choice>
                     <sic>tyranize</sic>
                     <corr>tyrannize</corr>
                  </choice> over her, to compel her into subjection to thy wishes, she will eventually appear in the spirit of a demon, taunting thee with the corroding bitterness of those deep and incurable wounds which thou hast so thoughtlessly inflicted upon her heart. Of such is the kingdom of earth. But let us return to our prospective, domestic and political tragedy.</p> 
               <p>"I have been lost in reflection, dear Solon," whispered Nora, "wandering through the bright yet thorny paths of the past to that dear old time when you and I were wed, when happiness and prosperity, attending<pb n="10-11" xml:id="VAC5704-00000006"/> ing our hand in hand efforts, and love, the deepest and purest, as I believed, bound us by the golden chain which time could not sever, war, fire nor sword could sunder. But even now I seem to see, far back in the past, the dark shadow of distrust that crept cringly between us, while the phantom of selfish fear seemed to hover over with a faint foreshadowing of future ill. Enough of the past. What have we to hope for in the future but destruction of principle and desolation of soul; ruin, fanaticism, and, O most deplorable! the moral death of the nation?</p> 
               <p>"Many long years, dear Solon, have I been thy faithful companion, and we have seen added to our once happy household another and another of those noble children<note xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="WRIGHT2-0185-NOTE001" n="*"

                  </note> whom God has given us, and who have contributed much to our happiness; whose fame and whose name have been borne across the wide Atlantic, and of whom foreign nations have spoken in eulogy. Ah, that thou and I should severed be, and these our daughters part too, forever!</p> 
               <p>"Pause and consider, my dear husband. Thou lovest slavery more than me. Thou lovest that ease and indolence ever attendant upon the patrons of slavery. Thou hatest free labor and human rights, therefore is thy heart cold, proud and ungodly.</p> 
               <p>"Do you flatter yourself, my love, that because I have foreborne until forbearence has ceased to be a virtue, I am blind to your faults, that I honor and respect your principles? No, believe me, your faults, though I have forgiven so many, have ever been heinous in my sight, yet the love I bear toward our children<pb n=""/> dren caused my tongue to cleave to the roof of my mouth whenever I sought to reprove thee for thy daring and traitorous acts, and in this respect am I greatly in error. Instead of winking at thy first transgressions until thy strong bold spirit had gathered new strength to <choice>
                     <sic>tyranize</sic>
                     <corr>tyrannize</corr>
                  </choice> over me, I should have studied thy nature and purposes more effectually and sought to repress thy first evil desires to transgress the laws of the land, and annul the rights of the people. When man shall have ceased to reverence the laws of his country and respect the rights of his fellow man, he will also have forfeited his respect for and interest in his household."</p> 
               <p>"Nay, it does not follow," replied Solon, "that a man should lose his affections for his family because he cannot abide by the conservative laws of the land, when they have become offensive and exceedingly oppressive to his sense of justice. Those Black Republican laws are becoming intolerable to every lover of independence of spirit, and every hater of injustice and wrong.</p> 
               <p>"Could we have had a milder and more generous form of government than that which will be administered through thy father and his cabinet, there would have been no cause for this distressing eruption between us, which now exists, the consequences of which will prove, not only disgraceful, but very disastrous to the happiness and well being of our children. But it is not too late to redeem the past. The only power that can save from ruin, or cause me to relent in my purposes, in fine, that we may possibly withstand the<pb n="12-13" xml:id="VAC5704-00000007"/> tide of dissolution, which has no reflux, but is continually rolling with inevitable force upon us, is concession from thy lips, and the humiliation of compromise from thy father. Your influence over him is unbounded. He will carry out your will and purposes, even at the point of the bayonet if need be. Therefore, what is your decision, my beloved? Remember to-morrow, and decide wisely."</p> 
               <p>The voice of Solon was hushed, yet Nora remained in deep and profound thought. It was of most momentous importance for her to decide between her duty to her country and the long cherished affection for her companion and those children who would depart with him. The intense and painful silence was at last broken by the perceptible agitation of Nora's low but impressive voice:</p> 
               <p>"Shall I," she said, "who have adhered to that liberty which was purchased at so dear a price, the blood of our forefathers, implore my father, as thou desirest, to defame his noble name, to make himself a stigma in the land; the hiss and by-word of generations to come; the land-mark of insult of foreign nations, by the dark and traitorous act of compromise; of granting an extension of thy crimes, in increase of thy vices, and protection, beyond our present laws, of the horrid acts of villiany of which some of thy kindred have been guilty? No! Rather would I bathe my hands in my own heart's blood, than live a traitor to my people and their laws. No! Sooner would I war with kindred blood than wear the brand of felony and shame which belongs to the instigators of disunion<pb n=""/> union. No! nor ever will my noble father and brothers submit to the awful destiny which thou wouldst force upon them. My father is just and merciful, yet will he not, so long as there is one ray of hope, see this Union, upon which the whole world is gazing, dissolved-the marriage vow forever annulled. Patience, my love, and a little faith in his honesty of heart and high and noble principles, will teach thee that the laws of our land will justify him in all his proceedings.</p> 
               <p>"You fear that when my father assumes the authority invested in him by the voice of the people, he will rule you with the rod of iron; that he will force you to abandon your <emph>beloved institution</emph>, slavery, or he will overthrow its monuments in your midst. In that belief you are mistaken. My father will not meddle with your idols, nor deprive you of your worship of darkness rather than light. Nor will he war with your principles, unless your own violence and your traitorous acts towards his people shall compel him to send out force of arms to quell your stern and haughty rebellion.</p> 
               <p>"Yet, if war with thee is inevitable, let it come! It matters not how soon the bonds of matrimony are dissolved between us, if a steadfastness to high and holy principle must dissolve them. Yes, if war must come, let it come! In the language of that noble patriot, Patrick Henry, I repeat mine own sentiments and those of my kindred: 'I care not what others may say, but as for me, give me liberty or give me death!' You comprehend my sentiments, my husband<pb n="14-15" xml:id="VAC5704-00000008"/> band, therefore you can act in accordance with or without them."</p> 
               <p>"This then, is thy stern decision, my proud, rebellious and beautiful Nora," said Solon, in bitterness. "There is very little indeed of the gentleness of woman in thy nature. The true woman's heart will submit to any discipline, or 'despotism,' as you term it, rather than lose the confidence and affections of her liege lord, and you, my Nora, I have ever fondly believed until now, possessed sufficient gentleness and womanly tenderness of heart to cause you to submit your future will to mine, and forget the fancied wrongs of which you deemed me guilty towards you."</p> 
               <p>"Allow me to sketch one scene from real life," said Nora, interrupting her liege in the gentlest manner possible. "Behold a man, haggard and wo-worn. His eyes roll heavily in their sockets, where burneth ever and forever the midnight fires of intemperance. His intellect, once bright and glorious, is besotted and benumbed, and the beast of the field reasoneth as well as he. Once he was the loved and cherished friend of the noblest of God's creatures, the patriots. Then, too, was he the stately oak, around which the household vines clung for protection against the rude tempests of time. His very name was a household word that breathed magic to every heart, and music to every soul. His sentiments were revered as oracles of wisdom, and rare and noble intellect shone through all his precepts and examples. But a storm gathered over his life's sky, and dense clouds <choice>
                     <sic>lomed</sic>
                     <corr>loomed</corr>
                  </choice> above the horizon. Then came the dark hours-then came the<pb n=""/> tempter also. He fell, and great was the consternation occasioned by his downfall. He had an idol which caused his overthrow. His idol was king Alcohol, (thine-pardon the allusion-is slavery,) his deadliest foe.</p> 
               <p>"But look at him again. He is the most loathsome of all 'worms of the dust.' Even the child cannot pass him by without a look of pity and contempt. Poor outcast! where is the purifying home influence that could have saved thee from thy terrible doom?</p> 
               <p>"He had once a beloved companion who was 'worthy of him,' he said, 'in his noblest days,' and who in prosperity forsook him not; yet, when the tempter came, she who should have grown strong in courage, and thrust the tempter from the household, stood trembling, fearing to resist the entrance of the evil one, lest her husband should deem her 'meddlesome,' or too 'strong minded.' Seest thou reality in the picture which I have presented?"</p> 
               <p>"Little, very little indeed," answered Solon. "But do you really consider me depraved in intellect, because I uphold slavery as an institution, ordained by the Father of the universe? Do you see me going the downward road to ruin because I hold the slave in bondage, believing it to be the lawful and moral right of posterity to do the same?"</p> 
               <p>"Slavery," said Nora, "is a vice, a CURSE, to the country wherever it finds toleration; hence the evils growing out of it are almost as numerous as the sands of the sea. <choice>
                     <sic>Wenever</sic>

Therefore is the curse of slavery darker and more damning than all other crimes into which the human race has fallen. It is a blot upon thy character which marks thy soul as perjured before God, and perfidious to man. The old world has long looked upon thee as a stumbling block in the way of civilization, and a traitor to the rights of both God and man. God grant that the shackles of slavery may one day fall, and that the soul of man may be made free from the terrible sins that necessarily follow the tyranny of man over man.</p> 
               <p>"No, I do not ask you to relinquish your power over the slave, nor do I wish you to banish the <emph>darling</emph>, slavery, from your heart. I only watch and pray that the God of truth and justice will eventually open your eyes to behold the great sin that is resting upon you. I await patiently the fulfillment of his word, when He will bring the soul out of darkness, and set the bondaged free. He is just, wise and merciful, and will work out the redemption of all who trust in him."</p> 
               <p>"Why this useless argument?" said Solon, "nought can avail with me. Thy father and his people must compromise as I desire, or I will sunder forever the strong bonds of union between us. I have wealth, luxury and power. I care not for the influence of thee and thine. To-morrow we shall no longer be one. The sun will rise upon our union, and set upon our disunion. Our fates are sealed. We shall part, and forever!"</p> 
               <p>"Beware! false hearted!" said Nora, in firmness. "'Twill not be so easy to burst the bonds which God<pb n=""/> has joined together, commanding, 'let not man put <choice>
                     <sic>assunder</sic>
                     <corr>asunder</corr>
                  </choice>.' It will be no light matter to break an alliance upon which all the nations of the earth have gazed in admiration and wonder.</p> 
               <p>"Remember Bonaparte and Josephine. How soon did the monarch fall when he had annulled the marriage covenant between them-gone out from the light of her influence and love. He sought to gratify an ignoble ambition, and grasp the power beyond his reach, and in that grasp lost all, and banished himself from fame, fortune and friends. And such will be thy fate.</p> 
               <p>"Dissolve this Union, and thou shalt become an outcast. Thy name shall be branded, from pole to pole, as a traitor to the nation-a tyrant of the household. Think not that by dissolving this Union you can form another in which you will be prosperous and happy. Dissolve our union, go forth from thy companion, draw part of our children after thee, yet so sure as the God of Heaven rules, will the day come when he will visit thee in the strength of his wrath, and thou wilt repent of thy sins in sackcloth and ashes, and plead with the humility and repentance of the prodigal to be received once more into that home which thou hast wilfully forsaken. Yes, sunder the golden chain of human love which has long bound us together by ties indissoluble, and thou shalt see, emblazoned in letters of blood, upon the ends of all the earth, thy name-'<emph>The Father of Traitors</emph>.'"</p> 
               <p>"Cease! Silence, mad woman!" muttered Solon, in a storm of fury and rage, "nor dare to threaten<pb n="18-19" xml:id="VAC5704-00000010"/> thus. Think you that by your dark and terrible predictions you can avert the fall of the avalanche, or hush the thunders of the cataract? No! Nor can you terrify me into servitude to woman's weak, capricious <emph>whims</emph>. Nay, the curtain may fall from heaven's eyes, the <choice>

The fire of disunion has long been kindled between us, nor can it become extinguished. Already have a chosen few of our noblest daughters departed from the light of their mother's counsels, while others are weighing the matter and will soon follow. Already have I placed over them a just and wise ruler, who will soon hush the cries of 'God save the Union!' and 'Liberty or death!'</p> 
               <p>"But let us repose once more in peace, that we may be strengthened and invigorated for the duties of that dark and portentious to-morrow."</p>

               <p>O beautiful sun! thou hast risen not in vain upon man's iniquity. He cannot hide it from thee, though he shroud it in darkness dense as the gloom of death. Behold him! created in the image of God; a man of genius, power, and strength; endowed with noblest reason and rarest intellect; coveting dishonored glory and dishonest renown. False ambition hath blinded his sight of truth, and palsied his sense of justice. The clanking chains of mammon, forged upon his soul by the wretched hand of slavery, chime in sweetest harmony upon his distorted brain. He speaketh in the voice of thunder, and the mountains from slumber awake, and the rivers of strife leap and tremble at his terrible power. He standeth upon the mount of Hope with extended spear, and the Cloud of Might rises in<pb n="20-21" xml:id="VAC5704-00000011"/> gorgeous array before his longing vision. He feasteth upon the secrets of his soul, and saith in bold self-reliance: "I am the man. I will rule over them, and they shall be my people. In the wisdom of Solon, I have been chosen the lawgiver of the nation. I will strike out her Sun from the horizon, I will hew down the Pillars of State, and I will hurl the Avalanche from the mountain side into the gulf of woe. I will wade through seas of human gore, and I will fasten the upas fang of Solon upon every living thing.

I will decoy them through the sea of Dissolution, and the dark billows of distrust will roll on either side. Yea, I will pursue them with the Lion of Fury, with the Ignus Fatuus will I lead them estray.

               <p>"I will trample the laws of matrimony beneath my feet, and my idolized son, Solon, shall break the fetters of wedlock which bind him to the loathsome weakness<pb n=""/> of woman-her wanton and ill-graced affections. I will teach him that her tears are as the dews, soft and glittering, yet absorbed by every ray of brighter orb, or moistened by every breath of whispered love. I will teach him the falsity of woman's heart, and the deep cunning and artifice of her nature, when the moth of distrust begins to corrode her love and the hope of re-union but faintly gleams above the darkness of despair.</p> 
               <p>"Yea, I will tower in my strength, and my future life shall be one of mystery and power. The softening beams of the glorious Moon will smile in approval upon me, and I shall be invigorated with a sense of new and lasting joy. The fire of the Flaming Sword will consume mine enemies, and I shall triumph in the glory of sovereign power and extended dominion. I will plant the tree of Anarchy in their midst, and they who have hungered for the bread of freedom shall partake of the fruit in all its bitterness. I will bow their heads beneath the yoke of tyranny, and oppression shall set her seal on every brow.</p> 
               <p>"I will go now to my son, Solon, and advise him of my determination to rebel against all law and reject all principles proposed by the leaders of black republicanism and dough-faced democracy. His heart is with me, and should Providence permit me to annul the marriage covenant between the cold and haughty Nora and himself, I shall have accomplished the one most essential act, which will entitle me to the highest position the Nation can confer."</p> 
               <p>Thus reasoned he who had so recently clothed himself<pb n="22-23" xml:id="VAC5704-00000012"/> in the magnificence of stern and relentless power-of sullen and atrocious authority.</p> 
               <p>But knowest thou, O man, that the Most High worketh in His own sublime and mysterious way. He hath not made the sun to shine that thou shouldst cover it with blots so that it send forth pestilence and darkness rather than light and glory. Nor hath he wisely framed the grand solar system, wherein the heavenly bodies move in most perfect harmony, that a Lucifer may, with daring hand, strike out planet after planet, regardless of consequences of collision of forces, and the crashing of worlds whose relative motions and annual revolutions depend one upon another for strength, order and grandeur. No! The Great Ruler of the Universe will not suffer the work of a century to be destroyed by a single breath, until that great day when he shall destroy the wicked by the breath of his mouth and the brightness of his coming.</p> 
               <p>Our temple of Freedom was reared upon a basis as pure as the throne of Heaven, as firm as the adamantine rocks. But woe to the structure built with human hands, although in form divine, when the storms of ages have passed over it, and the earthquakes of dissolution have rent its huge walls-when the thunders of public opinion and the tornadoes of disunion have darkened its windows, and the secret and smouldering fires of partizan spirit are creeping through every crevice, undermining the whole superstructure. Think you, then, that it will remain unshaken? Nay! it is more than we could expect of the "house made without hands, eternal in the heavens," were not our Father who is in<pb n=""/> heaven the Architect, Christ Jesus the Builder, and Eternity its foundation.</p> 
               <p>Our temple of Freedom may be shaken to the centre by the blasts of war; yet so long as the spirit of patriotism looms up in its midst, and the patriotic are ready to defend it with their lives, it cannot fall. It will stand ages upon ages, an indissoluble monument of the glorious past; for its foundation is truth, liberty and love.</p>

               <p>"Yes, yes, you speak truly, my father," said Solon, "when you say that Nora and Solon are no longer one-true indeed; our very souls are uncongenial; our principles are at war with each other. There is no longer unity of purpose, or union of sentiment in our hearts. Her heart has been chilled towards me, and her sympathies twine not for me the wreath of happiness which decked my brow in former years. The fire of abolition has dried up the fountain of her affections, and she is a vain worshiper at the hollow shrine of so called freedom; and yet her soul is full of love-devotion-such as would make the angels blessed. But she loves not me. Once that love was all mine own; now, alas, it has flown forever. O God! must this be so? O bitter cup! must I indeed drink the dregs of eternal regret? Is there no balm for woes like mine? My very existence will be but a blank without the light of Nora's eye, and the sweet melody of her voice."</p> 
               <p>"My son," said his father, "there is no cause for this regret. The separation once brought about, and<pb n="24-25" xml:id="VAC5704-00000013"/>  you will be happier in some new alliance, or, at least, you will be free from the unhallowed and intolerable influences of black republicanism which have so long cursed your union, and rendered your life most miserable. Once free, Solon, and you are the light of the world; stand firm, and you will be acknowledged as such. You fear the disgrace consequent from such a separation, yet Nora, weak woman, will feel it more than yourself."</p> 
               <p>"Disgrace," said Solon, "will not be the only calamity which will follow our separation. Should Nora's father sternly refuse to acknowledge it, or to compromise the matter, the most terrible consequences may ensue-those of civil war and the shedding of kindred blood. Such a fatality may result in the overthrow of our peculiar institution, and destroy the prosperity and happiness of our children.</p>

               <p>"Let us depart from these scenes of horror. We will go to the oblivion of forgetfulness, and drink to the stars of our serpent flag. One glowing cup of the sparkling wine-one glance from the eye of that old monster, the serpent, will diffuse throughout my veins the hot blood of revenge, and I shall arise before Nora's father, causing his tongue to quiver, and his lips to be dumb, when he shall stand in the presence of the<pb n=""/> nation, and declare his determination to abolish slavery, and destroy its principles. Already do I feel the venom of the hydra-headed monster, suspicion, coursing through every pore, and revenge most terrible will fall upon the instigators of the extinction of slavery.</p> 
               <p>"Farewell, father; we shall meet to-morrow somewhere on earth, to take measures against that old arch-fiend who would destroy us, and blot our names from the nation's glory. Woe, woe, to him! I will be a viper in his path!"</p>

                  <p>'Twas night. Half the world was hushed in dreams and visions of that one "to-morrow" on whose breath, fragrant with the sweet perfumes of love, or poisoned with the effluvia of a deadly upas, would be wafted healing balms to the wounds of the nation, or swift <choice>

                  <p>'Twas midnight hour-that hour when the melting tones of love are hushed in the deep silent chambers of the soul to breathe, through holy inspiration, the pure angelic melody of hearts, whose music knows no utterance save in the heavenly harmony of poetic numbers, and whose outpourings of joy or woe are borne aloft to spirits blessed. It was at such an hour, when the ever varying beauties of the night throw a mantle of brilliant glory, or a sable fold of darkness, o'er the human mind, that the gay metropolis, awakened unto new life, with living souls who swarmed the capitol, all eager and anxious for the dawn of "to-morrow," yet many were waiting with an indistinct dread akin to foreshadowing of coming woe. But the<pb n="28-29" xml:id="VAC5704-00000015"/>  morning dawned gloriously, and the bright star of hope shone brilliantly above the dark cloud of woe which hovered hiddenly in the distant horizon.</p> 
                  <p>The hour drew near when he-the father of his country-must stand before the people, and in tones profound utter those sentiments and disclose those principles which would move the great heart of the nation to return to its first love, and make glad the whole earth by the sunshine of beneficence and the blessedness of peace, or cause the nation to weep and bewail the darkness of bloodshed and the agonies of dissolution.</p> 
                  <p>At length the hour arrived. Nora and Solon met face to face in the presence of him who was to seal their destiny for weal or woe. Each wore a look of resignation, yet both were silent. But when the honest old patriot arose and began to read to his wondering and attentive listeners these words of his inaugural address: "Fellow citizens of the United States," etc., the glance of Nora's eye brightened, and her whole countenance, irradiated with a deep glow of filial love, wore a reverential aspect, such as angels holy might assume in the presence of the Great Divine.</p> 
                  <p>Now as the good man proceeded with the words, "Intelligence, patriotism, christianity, and a firm reliance on Him who has never yet forsaken this favored land, are still competent to adjust, in the best way, all our present difficulties.</p> 
                  <p>"In your hands, my dissatisfied fellow countrymen, and not in mine, is the momentous issue of civil war. The government will not assail you. You can have<pb n=""/> no conflict without being yourselves the aggressors. You have no oath registered in heaven to destroy the government, while I have the most solemn one to preserve, protect and defend it." Then came the words, "We are not enemies, but friends. We must not be enemies;" and the great, generous and honest heart of the speaker seemed to go out towards Solon with a look of human love which would have melted a human heart into humble contrition. But Solon's brow contracted, his countenance grew dark and menacing, and in every lineament of his feature was depicted the spirit of firm resistance and awful defiance. And yet a tear of long <choice>
                        <sic>burried</sic>
                        <corr>buried</corr>
                     </choice> patriotism trembled in his eye, when poured forth from the speaker the patriotic eloquence of a Washington in these noble and heaven-born sentiments: "Though passion may have strained, it must not break our bonds of affection. The mystic cords of memory, stretching from every battle field and patriot grave to every living heart and hearthstone, all over this broad land, will yet swell the cords of the Union when again touched, as surely they will be, by the better angels of our nature."</p> 
                  <p>The oath of office was then administered in great solemnity, and the dense multitude departed.</p> 
                  <p>"Surely," whispered Nora, "the dark storm so long gathering in Solon's bosom is now being dispelled by the 'better angels of his nature.'" Alas! dear Nora, appearances deceive thee.</p> 
                  <p>They met-Nora and Solon-met, not as lovers do, when the storm has spent its force and the starlight of reunion illumes their weary path. They met to<pb n="30-31" xml:id="VAC5704-00000016"/>  talk of separation, "secession," and "final dissolution." They met to annul their former vows, and banish, if possible, every emotion of sympathy from their hearts. They met to part; to meet no more as friends, such as of yore, this side of heaven. Let the waves of oblivion and the dark billows of eternity roll over the scenes of horror, heart rending remorse and conflicting emotions which attend the breaking up of the home circle, the happy fireside and domestic felicity. The picture is too dark for contemplation.</p>

               <p>"I know thy kind heart, my father," said Nora, "I<pb n="34-35" xml:id="VAC5704-00000018"/> would see it open to the world, that they may read its true worth, its high and noble sentiments, its just and elevating principles. But, alas! the selfishness of poor human nature has blinded their sight, and they can only see thee through the microscope of self-righteousness, therefore art thou ever misunderstood and misrepresented. Could all the world know and love thee as I do, dear father, I am sure thy gentle voice would never have been heard in the call "to arms," for thine enemies would have been conquered by the love of principle and the force of example. But thus it is: 'man proposes and God disposes.'</p> 
               <p>"In all ages of the world, whenever a government has become greatly corrupted, or darkly despotic, the All-Wise has raised up a ruler to revolutionize-to cleanse and purge the nation of her sin, and blot out the stain of her iniquity, and to tear down the bulwarks of despotism. And though kingdoms may crumble, and nations may fall, He will bind up the broken fragments, and cement the glorious bond of brotherhood more firmly together. That thou art the faithful pilot at the helm, and that the old ship, the Constitution, will be steered safely through the storm of war, unwrecked, is the ever constant and fervent prayer of thy Nora's heart.</p> 
               <p>"Though thy movements may seem, to many an impetuous spirit, too weak and dilatory to accomplish the wishes of the nation, yet I doubt not that to thee belongs greater wisdom and prudence than to those who are hasty and less considerate of the terrible consequences, and the devastating influences of civil war.</p> 
               <pb n=""/>

               <p>"Since the foundation of the world the grand luminary of light has not shone upon a more magnificent spectacle of patriotic devotion than the present age presents. The unity of men and minds, the general outpouring of the 'almighty dollar,' the universal spirit of self-sacrifice in woman, all these predict a future grand and glorious triumph of principle over error; the everlasting victory of freedom over <choice>

               <p>"Indeed, my daughter," said the honest old patriot, "thy soul is filled with the purest and loftiest patriotism, such as would awaken the ocean from its slumbering deep, or cause the rocks and the mountains to cry out, 'give me liberty or give me death!'</p>

               <p>Deep night hovers over the earth, with folded wings and solemn brow. No voice is in her footsteps, no music is in her soul; but the wails of the pierced and dying are borne silently upon her breath, and a look of woe is in her eye. The cloud-capped hills bow in majestic awe within her presence, and the silvery stars hush their whispers in the sky.</p> 
               <p>Dark and portentous thou art, O beautiful one, whose habitation is unbounded space; whose existence is an unending eternity. I love thee, dark, deep night, as the soul loveth inward joy or "sober melancholy." But thou art more lovely yet, since the glorious Comet hath flown across thy purple drapery, and hidden beneath thy crimson folds. Or else to what new sphere is he wending his way, since he hath crossed the trackless path of livid gore, a light to the weary footsteps and a sunbeam of hope to the despairing heart?</p> 
               <p>O thou Immutable One! who hast suffered so bright a luminary to be dispelled; so fair a central light to cease its burning. Couldst thou not have prolonged the visitation of the heavenly stranger until men's hearts were filled with the pure benevolence of purpose, the magnanimity of being, the philanthropy of soul, which radiated from this the chosen light which thou didst send to illuminate the hearts of thy people, and invigorate them with new life? The dense darkness following its sudden disappearance was almost overwhelming.</p> 
               <p>The leaves of the forest sigh, the moss-covered rocks answer in mute eloquence, the hills and the mountains echo from side to side, "Father, thy will be<pb n=""/> done and not ours."

               <p>"Our land will be darkened," sighed Nora, "by the disappearance from the nation's sky of so many 'bright particular stars.' Our people may lose courage, faith, and hope, for victory. Indeed, it seems to me, that misfortunes attend us not singly, but the thread of sorrow is strong and lasting. O that we may never regret that we have folded to our bosoms the weapons of death-the arms with which to kill our brothers. It is an inglorious fate-a shocking calamity-which has forced me to take up arms against my once idolized companion."</p> 
               <p>"It is truly," said Nora's father, "a work of loathsome sorrow, of deepest regret; but our cause is just, and we must not flinch from duty, be its mandates ever so stern and severe. Then let our policy, our principles, or our politics, be what they may, yet upon the momentous issue of the present war, and the proper adjustment of our difficulties, may we ever be firmly united. We MUST stand by freedom's side, believing that with her cool and calculating courage, she will yet work out a sure and certain victory."</p> 
               <p>"The traitors will be punished as they richly deserve<pb n="38-39" xml:id="VAC5704-00000020"/> serve," murmured Nora, somewhat sadly, "and we know not how many of our nearest and dearest friends may yet become traitors and violate all moral law and human obligations to both God and man. Think of it, my father: mine own bosom friend is false! is a traitor of darkest dye! Who can we trust? Shall we search the household but to find those soulless inhumanities clothed in the garb of friendship, bearing, concealed, the death-darts, ready at any moment to inflict the fatal wound, without one token of warning, or one moan of regret over such base ingratitude? Yes, we must expect to find enemies, even at home, so long as there is envy, hatred, malice and revenge, in the human breast-so long as the national fire is unquenched. It is not a recent thing that we find traitors among us. In 1852, among the last words Webster spoke, in public, he says: 'If classical history has been found to be, is now, and shall continue to be, the concomitant of free institutions, and of popular eloquence, what a field is opening to us for another Herodotus, and another Thucydides, (only may his throne not be a Peloponnesian war,) and another Livy. And, let me say, gentlemen, that if we, and our posterity, shall be true to the Christian religion-if we and they shall live always in the fear of God, and shall respect his commandments-if we and they shall maintain just moral sentiments, and such moral convictions of duty as shall control the heart and life-we may have the highest hopes of the future fortunes of our country. And, if we maintain those institutions of government and that political Union-exceeding all praise as it<pb n=""/> exceeds all former examples of political associations-we may be sure of one thing, that while our country furnishes material for a thousand masters of the historic art, it will afford no topic for a Gibbon. It will have no Decline and Fall. It will go on prospering and to prosper. But, if we and our posterity reject religious institutions and authority, violate the rules of eternal justice, trifle with the injunctions of morality, and recklessly destroy the political constitution which holds us together, no man can tell how suddenly a catastrophe may overwhelm us that shall bury all our glory in profound obscurity. If that catastrophe shall happen, let it have no history. Let the horrible <choice>

"The conflict deepens," she repeated, "and Heaven only knows where it will end: whether in the entire overthrow of our government, or in the peace and re-union of the nation. The latter we hope and pray for. And yet, I fear, our hopes are vain. The prayers of this unrighteous nation will not be heard until she is purged of her iniquity. We may not hope for victory until with one heart we implore the Almighty for wisdom, counsel and aid, in all our struggles against the foes of freedom.</p>

               <p>"May God in mercy avert such a catastrophe, my daughter," spake the "honest heart," "True, the Moon may not smile as propitiously as in former years. Though she has shown us momentarily her dark side, to try our faith in her sincerity, yet rest assured, dear Nora, her interests in us are too deep to be torn asunder by a single frown; and her welfare is too closely allied to our own to be violated without greater cause than that she disapproves some of the lighter measures<pb n="42-43" xml:id="VAC5704-00000022"/> sures we adopt in our proceedings against this accursed rebellion.</p>

               <p>"Woman, too, the 'weaker vessel,' is taking her part in the struggle. Ever faithful in her good works; self-sacrificing noble woman is denying herself of comforts to add to those of the soldier. She is often seen, like a ministering angel, watching beside the sick and afflicted, or the wounded soldier, who, instead of the downy bed, finds naught but the billowy turf upon which to languish out the last dying moan. No dear sister's gentle hand may be there to bathe the fevered brow, or bind up the fatal wounds; no kind mother's voice can reach him, soothing the wild distress and assuaging the pangs of death. No tender and loving wife, whose deep devotion says, 'I cannot give thee up,' may be there to infuse the soldier's heart with new life, while her prayer by his side, ascending to the Eternal, imploring the great Ruler of the universe to spare the beloved, if not for her sake, yet for her country's good, to enkindle the vital fires and bid him live for God and humanity. But the stranger, though she cannot fill the place of the dear devoted wife, yet she may earnestly and faithfully fulfill the mission of a mother or sister, and win for herself a treasure which gold cannot purchase nor time destroy: the imperishable gratitude of the honest soldier's heart, and the eternal blessing of God.</p>

As in France, the wonder-working Madame Roland laid her hands upon the secret springs of the nation's destiny, and the voice of the Revolution was heard throughout the land, enkindling its vital fires and stirring the souls of men to action. Yet she who could so move the great heart of Freedom, and win for herself honors imperishable, was content, in humility, to entwine around her husband's brow her laurels of fame. And this act of humility and devotion was more valuable to her happiness than the most glorious coronet that ever decked the brow of female sovereign."</p>

No answer comes from the conflicting elements; but the deep blue skies frown darkly, terrible upon them.

                  <p>"My son, how goes the battle to-day?" asked the rebel chief.</p> 
                  <p>"'All's well that ends well,'" replied Solon, "but the end is not yet. This will be the most fearful contest the world has ever known. The blood of the nation has flown as freely as the waters of the ocean, and yet the fire of vengeance is unquenched. This ungodly war of brothers against brothers will yet, I fear, cause the whole world to convulse with groans of the<pb n=""/> dying, and our land will be a desolation. Our homes have been destroyed, our cotton fields laid waste, and our servants let loose by insurrection among us. We are stung with treachery on every side. We are an unhonored and famished people. Father, have we not wasted already too many precious years in bitter and heart rending strife? Have not our swords and bayonets quaffed enough of human gore to satiate the hungry craving for our brothers' blood, and teach us that 'tis vain to hope for victory over our enemies? It is hard, 'tis very hard, to fight against woman-to take up arms against a once loved companion. I tell thee truly, my father, Nora can never be subdued. I once believed, firmly as you now do, that she would yet yield the contest or compromise. But how mistaken! She has gained the interests of the whole world in her favor, and her influence over the heart is more deeply felt than understood. She sways the human mind with such even temper and serene justice, that she is regarded almost as a saint among her people. And, indeed, many of our own are beginning to look upon her as such, and wish to feel again her benigned influence over them. I am candid in the opinion that one-half of our numbers are even now wishing for a re-union between Nora and myself."</p> 
                  <p>"And that is thy wish also, Solon, is it not?" said his father. "You love the haughty Nora yet; you cannot erase her image from your heart. That sirene voice comes back to you as in former years, and you cannot war against her with such hatred and revenge<pb n="50-51" xml:id="VAC5704-00000026"/> as you had anticipated. You would return to her, humble yourself in sackcloth and ashes, and implore her forgiveness: and for what? Only that you may be duped by her smiles once more. You remind one of the language of some poetical soft-brain, who says:</p> 
                  <p>"'There is a silence in deep love, as in deep water. There is a melancholy in it which suspends the foot; and the folded arms and the dejected head are the images which it reflects. No voice shakes its surface; the muses themselves approach it with a timid and tardy step, and a low and tremulous song.'</p> 
                  <p>"Little did I dream that one so wise as my son Solon would ever reflect such fantastical images of folly. That you should still cling with such tenacity to a boyish 'first love,' surprises me. Indeed, I cannot comprehend such womanly weakness-such impotence of purpose. You must arouse yourself from such stupidity of soul, or we are lost; all is lost, if you do not labor, if not for love, for hate, at least-bitter, direst hate.</p> 
                  <p>"Remember: there shall be no re-union between my son and the daughter of my hated rival and foe. The decree has gone forth; my laws are as the laws of the Meeds and Persians, unalterable. Our destiny is sealed. I cannot, if I would, revoke the seal. Let come what will; fire, sword, pestilence, and death! This is my will, though they should be the last words I shall utter again on earth. I cannot-I will not-submit tamely to see our vast wealth confiscated by northern hoards, while our cotton fields are overrun<pb n=""/> by their debased demagogues and wine-bibbing politicians. Enough. I have declared. On to 'victory or death!'"</p>

                  <p>"We shall triumph," said Nora, addressing the Pillars of State, "for the God of battle is our God. He goeth before and prepareth the way. As in the days of Moses, we are led forth to battle; the waters of disunion roll up on either side, yet we shall pass through, and our enemies will be swept away by their own wickedness.</p> 
                  <p>"We gaze into the deep blue of God's infinite arch, and threatening clouds arise and forked lightnings play, and the thunder's rumbling voice is heard upon the mountain's brow, and fierce tornades speak below; 'tis then we shudder and feel that the tempest is near. And, tracing earth's broad domains with visible eye,-are they parched with thirst? burning the feet of the weary traveler, or are they yet laving their wavy foliage in the crystal fountains descended from the floodgates of heaven?-we can, with some degree of accuracy, calculate the results of the coming storm. But when the bow of promise spans the horizon, the majesty of God speaketh in all his works, and nature speaketh to man in silent yet powerful eloquence, telling him that light is looming up, dispelling the darkness of the past with bright promises of the future.</p> 
                  <p>"Thus, too, in this world of living life, of mingling forms of light and beauty-of darkness and deformity-do we behold the elements of minds eternal, tempest-tost, in sweeping tornadoes of disunion-making waste, with volcanic fires of secession-desolating the soul's abundant harvest of glorious works. Yet when the bow of promise-those noble, unselfish and unfettered spirits of freedom, linked in the bond of<pb n="54-55" xml:id="VAC5704-00000028"/> brotherhood-span the Union's horizon, all hearts may rejoice that, though the tempest of war has not spent its force nor completed its destruction, the nation's sun will yet burst forth in glorious splendor, and all earth will be filled with gratitude to Heaven for the restoration of those inalienable rights which the God of our forefathers had once peacefully granted us.</p> 
                  <p>"Therefore be of good courage," said Nora, "for upon this day's salvation hangs our destiny. We shall be victorious, or we shall be blotted out of the great book of the nation, as being too weak for the conflict, too slow for the enemy, and forgotten and forsaken of God, who has so loved us from the foundation of the world."</p>

                  <p>The battle is won! The day is ours! Right has triumphed, and,we are again a free people. We have possessed ourselves of all the strong holds of the nation, and we have subdued the Cotton King in his glory. The fort was stormed by fire-no surrendering<pb n="56-57" xml:id="VAC5704-00000029"/> ing until by the devastation of fire the affrighted populace, panic struck, cried out for quarters. Great consternation was felt when the appeal for mercy was not granted until the signal to surrender was shown.</p> 
                  <p>We have taken all the rebel leaders prisoners, and they will be dealt with according to the law of the land. This will be a sad and unholy work-a task I cannot contemplate without a feeling of horror and dread. To gaze upon our desolation-our blighted prosperity-and not shudder at the thought of the future, would be as looking on with an inhuman indifference.</p> 
                  <p>"But Solon, father, thou wilt forgive," said Nora, "should you find sufficient penitence in his heart to satisfy you that he is really rebellious no more; that he is now willing to unite with me in sustaining the government and promoting the welfare of the people."</p> 
                  <p>"Nothing can be more conciliatory to all parties than that Solon and yourself should again be united in might, mind and strength. I shall endeavor to the utmost of my capacity to facilitate such an object-to accomplish that purpose upon which the welfare of the nation depends for security and happiness. But were every other obstacle removed, there is still a most formidable one in the way of your re-union. Your husband's father will oppose it until his last breath shall expire."</p> 
                  <p>"Yet, father," said Nora, "the laws of our land will require you to deal with him in the manner in which you deal with other leading traitors who were taken prisoners at the last battle, if so, all opposition<pb n=""/> to our best wishes may cease to exist. O, if he could only repent of his many crimes and be forgiven, it would be a pleasurable reflection to Solon, who has suffered wrongs and committed injustice and outrage towards us only through the influence of his father, and other rebel leaders. But I fear he is too far gone to feel the need of repentance until it is too late to avail anything towards a reconciliation between his Maker and himself. And, father, what will you do with him? exile him, or let him <emph>enjoy</emph> the tortures of hemp instead of the benefits of cotton? or would you prefer to give him a life of regret, <q>

An exile! an outcast from society, friends, home and happiness, would the tortures of this atone for the blood which the vengeance of his ungodly<pb n="58-59" xml:id="VAC5704-00000030"/>  heart has caused to flow from many of the noblest and best of Freedom's sons?

Yes, conscience will yet do her work, ere his reason shall have taken its everlasting flight."</p> 
                  <p>"You are well aware, father," interrupted Nora, "that so long as you suffer one leading traitor to exist, there will be cause to fear the instigation of another rebellion."</p> 
                  <p>"Do not be needlessly alarmed, my daughter, in regard to a future rebellion; all its causes will soon cease to exist. We shall never again be disheartened by such a disasterous and distressing eruption. The National Fire is now nearly extinguished. Solon has repented fully of his folly and rashness, and longs for a reconciliation and re-union between thee and himself; and thy great, generous heart is ever ready to forgive, and to welcome the return of the prodigal to the happy household once more. The grand and glorious Moon has shown of late, by the equanimity of her smiles, that she approves our cause. And, indeed, how could she roll on in her lofty majesty, far exceeding all the other heavenly bodies in the mildness and purity of her light, and the genial rays of her luminous<pb n=""/> countenance, had she not declared to heaven that she loved justice more than power, and 'right' more than 'might'? Had she, by her frowning coldness, condemned the cause of freedom, when she is herself the freest of all the 'glittering host,' she would have produced a revolution in the heavens, and a collision among the heavenly forces, such as would have crushed the universe, or torn asunder the great wheels of nature. Truly she is to the world as the 'isles of beauty' to the 'vasty deep.' The Flaming Sword has been sheathed, and hangs menacingly over us no longer, but is ready to pierce the heart of Rebellion through, should Freedom again be <choice>

                  <p>A low and solemn voice, as one coming from the depths of the grave, seemed to answer him: "There is no mercy without penitence; there is no forgiveness without repentance."

"Death will come soon enough-fearfully enough, too," muttered the sentinel, in hoarse and ungenial voice. "Death will come ere you are prepared to receive his icy grasp, which, I trow, will not be half so soothing as the warm embrace of a friend. You had better make your peace with God before it is too late."</p> 
                  <p>"Too late! too late!" repeated the rebel, instinctively, "too late! He is here-here," he murmured, his reason flickering. "O my dagger! let me thrust it through his heart!

I would rather suffer a thousand deaths than measure out such an existence as that. Death, disgrace or the dungeon-anything but banishment. He will never live to feel such a shock, to suffer such misfortune. Vitality is too nearly exhausted, and withering remorse is doing its frightful work. I fear only that he will become a maniac. His reason is hourly being dethroned."</p>

                  <p>"This generation will never appreciate thy purity and magnanimity of soul, my dear Nora," said Solon, who had listened enraptured to her praises of Freedom, "but ages to come will bless thy name, and laud the efforts which have given the back the Union unbroken, though once severed; purified, though once stained by<pb n="70-71" xml:id="VAC5704-00000036"/> crimes of darkest hue. Would that Freedom could give me back thy heart, filled with the warmest emotions of love-mine, and mine only- as when first we wed. O, will it never be? Is all lost?-lost forever! Is there no hope of re-union of spirit? or must this life be one of dark despair, with no bright ray of hope breaking through to dispell the soul's eternal gloom? May just Heaven forbid that we should wear out a miserable existence-linked together for selfish ends, because our interests demand it, our children desire it, and foreign influence decrees that we must unite and make the best of it. I cannot endure thy coldness. Nay, I cannot exist without thy love-that love which in my boyhood became a part of my being, and I knew nought of happiness save through thee, thou who wert my destiny."</p> 
                  <p>"I gave my heart to thee, Solon," replied Nora, "not because of thy broad possessions, thine immense wealth, thy luxurious life and mine own personal interests, but for thy great, generous heart, thy noble intellect, and, more than all, for thy <emph>seeming</emph> fidelity to the Union for which our fathers bled and died. I loved thee because thou didst then love truth, justice and integrity, more than thy life. But those terrible fire eaters have been thy overthrow, and the destroyers of thy happiness. But let the dark past be forgotten. The future will, I trust, find thee more faithful in fulfilling thy renewed promises than the past has in keeping thy first vows. You need not doubt that all the devotion of my former love will be restored to you, should you prove worthy of it. Let time do<pb n=""/> his work; we will wait patiently and see what the future has in store for us. We will hope and pray that she will betide us no ill. We have renewed our former vows, and now let us learn to love and cherish each other until the end."</p> 
                  <p>"But what will your father say of our re-union?" said Solon. "I know it has been his wish to see us again united."</p> 
                  <p>"He will say," whispered Nora, "Heaven bless you, my children; may you ever live in the fear of God, and go no more estray."</p> 
                  <p>"What will be his future course of action? Will he ever be able to subdue or overcome the prejudices of my people against him?" said Solon, with an expression of doubt hanging upon his lips.</p> 
                  <p>"My father!" said Nora. "The world does not know him yet. He is honest and just. With the Constitution firmly upheld by the Pillars of State-the glory of the Rising Sun illuminating and cheering the gloomy way, and the Morning Stars singing together as the music of the spheres. His voice, blending like the voice of Freedom, will long be musical to the noble souls of the North; rising in <choice>

                  <p>"Beautiful being!" exclaimed Solon, gazing into her deep, soul-breathing eyes, "I can but adore thee more and more, for thy filial devotion to him who has devoted his whole life to thee. Were thy companion as worthy of thy affections as is thy father, we should both be happier now." He clasped her hand in his, and a strange and mysterious power came over them. It was not sleep, nor yet akin to sleep; nor was it much unlike a sweet and tranquil dream at dewy eve.</p>

                  <p>They sate in open air, musing upon the past, and all the glorious universe a flood of light became. The sky was draped in azure, purple and gold, and clouds of fleecy fold were blending through.

                  <pb n=""/> 
                  <p>They asked: "Whence came this temple fair, and what its import?" and were about to enter, when, suddenly withdrawn, beheld a sentinel or guardian, who kept the portal, and conveyed to them the intelligence which they desired.</p> 
                  <p>"This edifice," he said, "is called the Temple of Genius, because it is dedicated to genius alone. 'Twas built by human hands, although it seems divine. Its architecture is the work of Heaven; its workmanship is the perfection of all things perfect. 'Twas reared for mortal good-in which to blend the laws of God and man in harmony-and genius is the power between the finite and the Infinite-the connecting link between earth and Heaven. Therefore is this most beautiful work of God and man dedicated to His greatest earthly power, Genius. This temple has as many spires as there are nations of the earth. Upon each spire is borne aloft the nation's flag of peace. See!" he said, pointing to one which bore the name, "America," and "Liberty forever!" "Art thou ready?" he said.</p> 
                  <p>"We are," they both replied, and again they attempted to enter, and were repulsed.</p> 
                  <p>"First take the oath of allegiance," said he, solemnly, "and swear that you will war no more with any nation of the earth." They took the oath and entered the temple. There, within that holy shrine, every nation under the whole heavens assembled, but vowed before they entered, that they would war no more-that there should be no more bloodshed, or enmity, or hatred, but all should be peace and unity of heart. Each nation entered at their own portal,<pb n="74-75" xml:id="VAC5704-00000038"/> but all met within the great council hall, with congratulations and peace-offerings. No mortal could pass the threshhold of that beautiful temple without purification. Within, the arts and sciences were taught in all their primeval purity. Genius alone stood unrivaled. At her shrine the nations paid their tributes of devotion. She was the supreme ruler. The whole world acknowledged the merits of Genius, pure genius, and all sin was swept away from her presence as darkness before the light of the sun. </p> 
                  <p>Nora and Solon knelt at her shrine in that change of heart which belongs only to the tried soul, purified and refined. They turned away, wandering forth to view the wonders of the Almighty Architect, feeling their own insignificance and utter helplessness and dependence upon Him whom they had <choice>

                  <p>Thus, dear reader, we will leave them, hoping that no domestic storm may ever again darken their horizon, or o'ercloud their happiness. Praying, too, that King Cotton will never more enkindle in the home circle the fire of Disunion, or seek to break those bonds which God has joined together, commanding: "Let nor man put asunder."</p>
