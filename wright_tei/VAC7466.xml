In the first place we have endeavored to illustrate, by a variety of examples, the evils resulting from such measures as have been adopted by those rash monomaniacs, who, carried away by fanaticism and blinded by prejudice, seek to depre- ciate true merit by making the land of their birth the test of a fellow-creature's capabilities and intrinsic worth. As true Americans, firm upholders of our constitution, and liberal Christians, we believe it to be our duty to bestir ourselves, and put forth every effort iv order to check these influences which savor so strongly of religious proscription and general oppression. In the second place we have attempted to prove, that 'there is neither sense nor reason in crushing the white man in order to liberate from bondage the black, often, by such interference, rendering the condition of the latter infinitely worse- than if such philanthrop;c measures had never been resorted to. Know-Nothingism is an offspring of the North, and though we doubt not -many of those who have' attached themselves  &#xD;<pb n="vi-vii" xml:id="VAC7466-00000004"/> vi       ,    PREFACE. to this party have had their country's bestinterests at heart, still; we confidently believe its originators had but one object in view; viz: to enlist 'the Southerners din this movement, incense them against the foreigners and the foreigners against ,them, and while preserving a prudent silence, secretly rejoic- ing to see hundreds of both native and adopted citizens caught in the snare their wary brethren have spread out for their unsuspecting feet. We believe, too, that the South will, sooner or later, be aroused to the conviction of the truth. It may be, however, (and this is our greatest fear,) that the scales will not fall from her eyes, until she has blindly assisted in electing to the most important offices the very men who have resolved, as soon as practicable, to force her into the Abolition ranks, 'and when this last measure is resorted to, who, that knows anytling of Southern character, will hesitate to say that the 4igsolution of the Union is inevitable.

Like those snows that rest on the mountain's breast, , Was the face of this youthful maiden'; Save the mollow flush which we term a blusht. That flowed to her' cheek with as soft a gush As a zephyr with sweetness laden. THEBlast lingering rays of a' gorgeous sunset were gradually fading from the blue waters of the Main, a a maiden of some fifteen summers strolled listlessly along its bank, pausing, occasionally, to watch the rip- ples that danced at her feet, or to let her eye feast on the landscape of beauty spread out before her.    Al- though autumn's reign had scarce bekun, nature had already clothed many of the forest trees in rich garbs &#xD;<pb n="14-15" xml:id="VAC7466-00000008"/> g14      EMMA BARTLETT: OR, of brown and gold, which, interspersed with -the emer- ald, formed a bright picture the gay young girl seemed fully to appreciate. As she stood there musing, low, sweet snatches of song burst from her lips, most of them national airs, breathing forth a spirit of devotion to the -Fatherland. There was tnething strangely fascinating in the maiden's face; her features, even then strikingly hand- some, gave promise of surpassing beauty when the breath of a few more summers should deepen the flush upon her cheek, the touch of a few mnore years mold into perfect symmetry the already graceful form, and further instruction cause the germs of thought already awakened in her bosom, to expand, thus deepening her earnest glance, adding pathos to her voice, and if pos- sible, fitting her heart for a finer appreciation of the beautiful in nature than it then possessed. , Her silken tresses were unconfined, and fell in sunny ringlets about her neck.  Her eyes were of a heavenly blue, and had in them an expression of child-like confidence; her i hovnements were full of grace, and she possessed, with- all, such a gentleness of manner she seldom failed to attract the attention of even the casual observer. After gazing until the sun had wholly disappeared behind the western hills, leaving a host of silver clouds to cov er his retreat, she slowly turned her steps home- ward. Though of antique construction, the mansion she entered, together with the grounds surrountding,   PRl VDIftI  - AXD PANAt0ISM.    " indicated that its owner was possesed both of wealth Wad exquisite taste. The high Gothic arches were sulp ported in front by a- double row of colonnades, while on either side were balconies through whose trellis-work sunshine and shadows were ever at play. The top of the building was adorned with on observatory, whose lattice-work of fairy lightness enclosed a fountain, the waters of which, in the sultry summer days, rose and fell in crystal jets, cooling the heated atmosphere where- ever the pearly drops were shivered. This point com- manded an extended view of the surrounding country; but, ere the eye roved to distant objects, it was first attracted by the carefully cultivated garden on one side, and the diamond-shaped conservatory on the other; the rare exotics the latter contained, as seen through the polished glass, with their bursting buds and gaudy flowers reaching toward the golden sunlight, formed a rainbow of colors beautiful beyond description. The grounds in front of the mansion were ornamented with every species of flowering shrubs and large numbers of forest trees, whose branches were stretched forth so invitingly, many a wild-wood bird had been wooed to their embrace, and constrained to linger there away from their native shades; and while sipping -from the blossoms their distilled sweetness, to pour forth rich strains of melody to its entertainers. It was no wonder the fair girl, as she tripped lightly along the broad gravel way leading to the portal, )   &#xD;<pb n="16-17" xml:id="VAC7466-00000009"/> ffi 3   . EMMA BATBTT: OR, o exclaimed enthu-siastically, "There is no place like home;" or that, on reaching the vast hall, she turned to her father, saying, in the soft Franconian dialects as her blue orbs sought his imploringly, "4Dear father, E' why can I not remain here -with you and mother? If don't want to return to school." Baron Von Hutten cast a look of mingled tenderness and pride upon his child, and as he caressingly smoothed the sunny tresses from her brow, said in a voice made eloquent by paternal love, "Is not my daughter willing to make the sacrifice in order to complete her educa- tion? Only a year longer must we endure the trial of separation, and then there will be no more partings, I trust." "It is a long time to be from home, father; I have already been three years away, you know." "Yes, and have fu!filled my fondest hopes, Rosalie; only continue a fwelvemonth longer; the time will soon pass. You know you spend all your vacations -at home." The young girl mused for a moment, and then said, I do believe I love my home better than any one else; I 've been strolling along the banks of the Main for the last hour; don't you think it the prettiest river in the world, father? I do." "It is because your home is so near its banks. From infancy you have gazed upon its waters, and every tree that lines its shores, for miles, has become endeared to you by association."   PREJUDICE AND FANATICISM.      17 "But, father," asked the maiden, turning toward the door and allowing her gaze to wander in the direc- tion of the river, " do you think other streams and for- ests could be found elsewhere, that could in any way compare with those of the Fatherland? Even in Amer- ica, the land of peace and liberty, of which you talk so much?" "Why not, my child? The same Hand fashioned the channels there, and clad the woods in verdure, that painted with delicate touch the blossoms with which your own native hills are decked. Yes, America, I fancy, is as fair a  clime as ours, and those who seek its shores are entitled io many privileges we can never enjoy; there, unoppressed by kingly power, they acknowledge allegiance to none save the Supreme Ruler.  Would that I were freed from the chains that fetter me here; would that, with those most dear to me, I could join those of my countrymen who have sought the land of liberty, and kneeling on the free soil of Columbia, offer up my devotions not to priest or pope, but to Him who is ever willing and ready to hear. Heaven knows I love my  native land, the home of -my forefathers, and the hallowed spot that holds the  sacred dust of-my sainted parents, but sooner than see you, my daughter, or our little Karl, now slumbering  on his mother's knee, crushed in spirit by the galling yoke of our des- potic king, or forced to worship in a manner repulsive to your conscience-sooner than behold this, would 1 2  &#xD;<pb n="18-19" xml:id="VAC7466-00000010"/> 18-      EMMA BARTLETT: OR, sacrifice all I possess, and launch forth upon the ocean with ,the fond hope of reaching and spending my remaining days in the asylum of the free-the land of Washington." "Softly, father, softly, your voice grows loud; you may be overheard, and you know the penalty." As Rosalie spoke, her hand was laid admonishingly on his shoulder. "Who has taught my Rosalie to be so cautious ' asked the Baron, smilingly. "Roderic," she replied with a slight blush; " be says were any of the officers to hear you speak of the king as you do,* you would be imprisoned." "Roderic is thoughtful; for your sake he would not betray me,-but--" "O, you need not fear him, father; he would not, but, his father, you know, is' an officer, bound by oath and honor to report, and before him and others, prudence is requisite." These words of caution sounded strangely, coming from the lips of one so young and child-like as Rosa- lie; but Roderic Sundahl, to whom she had been be- trothed in early years, and whose repeated entreaties to put her father on his guard, had .impressed them- selves upon her mind, had, of late, urged her to seek every opportunity to remind him of the penalty await- ing tho"se who dared to give utterance to sentiments of disloyalty.   PREJUDICE AND FANATICISM.      19 To him it was a matter possessing the deepest in- terest; already had his heart been led captive by the unfolding charms of the gentle being he had been told fo regard asohis future mate; already had his dark eye learned to flash and his bosom to throb wildly, whenever he approached her; and already had her timid glance, and the faint color that stole into her cheek at the sound of his approaching footstep, told the heart secret that the red lips had never attempted to frame into words. But should his. father learn that the Baron gave utterance to sentiments against his-sovereign, it might be the means of dissolving their brightest dreams, for would not his oath bind him, as a true officer, to report whatever information of this character came  into his possession? f         -  &#xD;<pb n="20-21" xml:id="VAC7466-00000011"/> 20       EMMA BARTLETT: On, CHAPTER      II. THE  IMPRISONMENT. X SE drooped as a blossom, When withered by blight, Or as roses in summer, When reft of the light. She passed from among them, And left them to mourn, For the loved and the lost, That could never return. WELL had it been for Baron Von Hutten had -he lis- tened to the pleadings of his child, and kept her by his side, for she, perchance, would have been to him as a guardian angel, and by her gently breathed words of timely caution, have averted the calamity his impru- dence brought upon him. Six months after her depar- ture from the homestead, Rosalie received a hasty summons to return and watch by the bedside of her mother, who had been suddenly prostrated by the astounding intelligence .that her husband, while at Kis- singen Bath, a noted watering-place in their province, had been arrested and charged with treason. Had the wife doubted the truth of the report, the blow might not have fallen with such crushing wight upon her r   PRrJUDMCE AND FANATICISM.     21 heart, for hope might have whispered it was without foundation; but, having heard him so frequently and boldly express his views on that subject, she felt con- fident he had not been apprehended. without cause. The Baroness was a fragile, delicate blossom, living only in the sunshine of her husband's love; and, when she learned his presence was to, be denied her, when told, that by order of the tyrant, Karl Ludwich; he had been sentenced to three years' imprisonment, and positively refused the privilege of seeing any member of his family during that period; and  further, that their beautiful home, and   all they possessed, had been confiscated to the government, thus reducing her- self and children to penury, like some  fhgile plant, reft of the  sunlight, she sank beneath the stroke. Daily her strength' diminished, and --the light faded from -her eye, until, drooping and withered, she passed away, leaving only the remembrance of her unbounded benevolence to the needy, whose wants-. she had so often supplied, the recollection of her uniform gentleness to her servants, and the example of a   loving wife and devoted mother to her sorrowing daughter. And thus was Rosalie robbed of both parents, and !eft, with the little Karl clinging to her for love and protection. Yet was she not wholly alone; Roderic was left, and indescribably dear did he seem, as he stood by her side, his fine eye flashing with indignation, . .   &#xD;<pb n="22-23" xml:id="VAC7466-00000012"/> 22       EMMA BARTLETT: OR, and vowed, if life were spared, to be revenged on the tyrant who had destroyed the peace of the household. to which Rosalie belonged. "Be cautious, Roderic! The same punishment may await your words as has been visited upon father; guard your lips, for my sake." "Do you fear the trees and rocks wsill repeat?" he asked, smiling. "Have no anxiety for me," he con- tinued, "but my Rosalie has yet to learn how this calamity has blasted my brightest hopes." "What mean you, Roderic?" she asked, looking earnestly into his face. The information he was about to impart evidently pained the youth; several minutes elapsed ere he could frame his thoughts into words. "We have loved each other, Rosalie," he at length said, clasping nervously the waxen fingers resting in his hand. i Yes," she replied, looking up with child-like confi- dence, "You are all that 's left me now," she added, as her eyelids drooped beneath his gaze. "I have been taught from boyhood to look upon you v as my own. You have become, as it were, a portion of myself, and now-" he paused, overcome by his feelings.  "And what?" asked Rosalie, a dark foreboding seiz- ing her, "they surely would not be so cruel as to part   PRJUDICE AND FANATICISM.     23 us now," and she grasped convulsively his circling arm. "It is even so," he replied, avoiding- her agonized look; "my father has informed me that heretofore the position and wealth of our respective families were equal; now it is different, and he thinks I should renounce all hopes of uniting my fate with yours. But, Rosalie, my father must not endeavor to control me in this matter; he shaU not; in all things else I will yield obedience, but in this my heart must decide. I know he will never consent to the union, but in two years more I shall be free, and can act for myself ; you are aware that the family mansion falls into my possession at haTe, it being a portion of my mother's inher- ince; until then I have no hope of calling you mine, t in the meantime IQ have resolved to effect your father's escape from prison." "O! Roderic is there the least possibility of such a 'thing?" "With great caution it might be accomplished; but even if success crowned my efforts he would have to fly his country." "Well, well," cried the daughter, with enthusiasm, "he could do that; he would gladlyffly to America, the land of which he has so often spoken; but, Roderic, he should not go alone," and bright tears started to Ro- salie's eyes as she spoke.

The youth saw the struggle, and said, "-It would be a terrible trial to part, yet for his sake, perhaps, we should make the sacrifice. I could join -you, at the expiration of two years, in America. Think you we could endure such a separation?" Rosalie returned his look of confiding love, and replied 'ia trembling voice, "If you can bear it, should not I, when the release of a parent depends upon it?" "Yes," she added, gathering firmness from   the thought, "I will nerve myself to endure." It was a severe trial for the maiden, but dut tri- umphed; two years seemed an interminable perio for loving hearts to be parted, but her father must not seek a foreign coast-alone; the hope of his escape seemed to strengthen her, and after devoting several weeks to making all necessary arrangements, the lovers strolled out, as was their wont, to exchange vows of eternal constancy,-perhaps for the last time, beside the blue waters of the Main. "All is now ready, dearest," said Roderic, in a tone which, despite his strong effort at control, was slightly tremuilous; "if success crown my efforts, before to-mor- row's nun is set, you will be far enough away to baffle pursuit; but how you tremble, Rosalie--.think you your courage will fail?

"The papers, are they secure?" he asked, hoping to divert-her thoughts. "They are." "Remember those are passports to facilitate your escape. They are made out in the name of Walde- meyer-your father must assume that name in order to effect his escape." "And you, Roderic, you are running a fearfil risk." "Have no fears about mne; mny innocence can be proved, and, thanks to the laws of our land, inferior as they are in some respects, I can not be retained in his stead, But, Rosalie, love, it is time for action; a carriage waits at the edge of the forest to convey your- self and Karl to within a short distance of the prison; there it will remain until I put my plan into execution; if successful your father will join you within an hour after I leave, if not I will return, or if prevented by any unforeseen interference, the driver has directions to retrace his steps. And now, Rosalie," he continued, making another strong effort to control his emotions, "we must part; here, beside the blue waters where we have so often sat together, let the farewells be spoken; it is like sundering the heart strings, my sweet girl, for those who have loved .so deeply to be severed, but we must try to be brave and hope for the best."            .      .8  &#xD;<pb n="26-27" xml:id="VAC7466-00000014"/> 8        E-M fMA BARTLETT: OR,           l The lover's voice sank to a whisper; the great storm of grief that swept over his spirit put his voice to flight, and as he folded her to his bosom, long, fervent kisses were pressed upon lips, cheek and brow, and then, in a scarce audible whisper, he said, "God bless and protect you, my betrothed, till we meet again." "'O! -loderic, how can I leave? you?'7 were the only articulate words that forced themselves, through burst- ing sobs, from Rosalie's lips. It is hard to administer comfort to a bleeding heart swhen our own is lacerated and writhing in agony, yet sympathy is sweet. Roderic felt this, as that fair head rested on his bosom, and though he strove, in cheering r accents, to soften the pain of separation, he also expe- rienced a secret joy when he gathered from her broken accents, that her affection for him could only be equaled -by the unutterable love he bore her.

IT was a narroaw, dismal-looking cell in which Baron Von Hutten sat, with his spare form bowed, and his face buried' in his hands. Months had passed away sinc he had entered that gloomy prison, and yet no tidings, not even a word from his family had ever reached his eatrs: often; during that period, had he been seized with darlt f  orebodings; for well he knew the ntelignee of his apprehension would fall with fearful weight u pon th inm ates of his home.; As yet he had not learned lath the death-angel had visited the homestead, and borne from thence the spirit of the gentle being whose love had been his greatest', s1ae for so many years.

It was after dark when Roderic Sundahl reached the door of the cell ui which the prisoner was confined. "Remember," said the jailor who had accompanied him, " a half hour is the time allotted for the interview." "I'll be punctual," was the reply, as the jailor turned away, and the young man, entering the cell, closed the door behind him.  "You don't recognize me, my friend," he said, addres- sing the Baron, who had arisen as he entered. "Wait a moment," and with inconceivable velocity he relieved his head of a suit of false hair, and his face of the moustache and whiskers with which it was adorned. "You see, I have arrayed myself, lala Baron, he said, smiling. "Roderic! ' burst from the prisoner's lips, as- the young man's features were revealed. "Exactly so, my friend, but remember, no time must ie lost in queries. I have come for the purpose- of assisting you in making your escape from these uncom- fortable quarters; and in a low tone he briefly related his plan. The Baron grasped his hand. "You are daring muc1h for my sake, /he said, "Say-rather for ther : A w. a he hasty rep;y. :Bt,   PREUDICE AND FANATIISM.       2 py friend, these moments are too precious to waste in thanks; it is time for immediate action; we must exchange clothes; we are aboutthe same hight, and the false hair I selected corresponds with your's admirably: moreover, the jailor looks as though he was half asleep." Very quickly was the change effected; and enveloped in Roderic's cloak, with his cap drawn closely over his eyes, and carelessly swinging his cane in one hand, the prisoner stood until the jailor, opening the door, informed him that the half hour had expired. The Baron replied to the summons by gliding quickly out, and simply say- ing, , I am ready."  The jailor cast a glance at the sup- posed prisoner, and seeing, as he imagined, the Baron's form, with head bowed, and face concealed, as was his wont, he had no suspicion of the truth, and mentally exclaiming, "All right!" he turned, and  led the way from the cell. "I  hope you brought the poor man some news from his family; I never before saw any one so anxious," he said as they descended the dark stairway. "I did," was the brief reply. "I was astonished," continued the former, " when I learned the keeper had given you permission to see him; he has had repeated applications, but this is the first time he has acquiesced." ( Indeed!"was the laconic rejoinder. It was well that no lengthier replies were requisite and that, as they approached the outer door, the conver  sation ceased altogether; for the prisoner's voice had  --                .voc  &#xD;<pb n="30-31" xml:id="VAC7466-00000016"/> 8w      - MA BARBdETT: O-, partaken of the agitation of his perturbed thoughts; and the possibility of escape, now almost reduced to a cer- tainty, made his heart throb wildly with alternate hopes and fears. It was well, too, that the young moon, which a few moments before had looked smilingly down, moved as it were by an impulse of tender pity, drew a white cloud-veil over her face as the prisoner passed through the portal, which for an instant robbed the earth of her beams: and that when this veil was removed the Baron had descended the stone steps, and the jailor, after closing the street door carefully after him, had turned the heavy key in the lock, and returned to his duty. Again to imbibe the pure air, to feel the soft touch of the night-breeze as it swept across his brow, and know that it had not penetrated -through prison-bars to reach him; to fully realize that the confined atmosphere of a prison was exchanged for the refreshing South Wind, then fanning his cheek; all this inspired the Baron with new energies, as, with a quick, noiseless step, he turned and sought the spot to which he had been directed. In his short interview with Roderic, the- brief reply to his inquiries with regard to his family, was, "You will find them all in the carriage, awaiting your coming." The youth had not dared to inforA him of the death of the Baroness; the shock, he knew, would render him inca- pable of attempting escape,- and, when immediate oetion was so necessary, he felt it his duty to avoid imparting any infor ation that might cause delay; ^.\              PREJUDICE AND FANATICISM.     81 therefore, without dreaming that she, who was de&amp;rer than all others, was not included, when he said, " all awaited him," the prisoner had silently accepted the purse of gold forced into his hand, and followed his leader. "Is it you, father?" asked a soft voice, while by the glimmering light a fair face was discernable, on which the traces of recent tears were visible, but which, at that moment was lit up with joyful expectancy, as she bent eagerly forward. "It is," was the tremulous reply, and the next moment the arms of his children were thrown round his neck, and in a warm paternal embrace were they folded to his bosom. "Your mother, my children; where is she?" he asked, glancing anxiously round, for an undefined dread had crept through his heart when he missed the pressure of the lips which had ever been first to welcome him. "She is not here. ! father, did you not know she was dead?" asked the daughter, the most intense agony depicted on her features. f "Great heavens! No!" gasped the strong man, sink- ing back into a seat. "This," he continued, wringing his hands, " this is the severest blow of all; " and bow- ing his head upon his bosom, he wept like an infant. "Which way?" asked the driver, in an impatient tone, as he raised a curtain, and turned his fdce toward the travelers. *;       ,    ,  &#xD;<pb n="32-33" xml:id="VAC7466-00000017"/> 832      EMMA BARTLETT: OR, "(n n! i' replied Rosalie, recollecting the peril of delay; on; to Frankfort."

Day and nigf they traveled, unheeding fatigue, and continually buoyed up by the thought, that each day's journey brought them- nearer the ocean, which, if reached in season, would enable them to bid defiance to their pursuers; and when, at the expiration of a fortnight, they arrived at Havre and found a ship just ready to sail, they embarked instantly; and then, for the first time since their flight, Baron Von Hutten breathed freely; he was out of the reach of his enemies, and capture was then impossible.

Yes, Rosalie and Karl were indeed orphans; the ship- fever, which had raged violently for several weeks, carrying off scores of victims, finally seized upon the Baron, who, wasted as he was from  recent anxiety, became an easy prey to its ravages. With a hand clasped in each of his children's he breathed his last; fixing his eyes on vacancy, as it seemed to the watch- ers, with his dying breath he tenderly breathed the name of his wife, and then, tranquilly fell into that sleep that knows no waking. O! it was terrible to see him lying there, stiff and cold, with the death dew still upon his noble brow, and his gaze apparently fixed upon somethng above hi'm: terrible when, watching until aftert he morning dawned, strange, rough hands pushed the orphans aside, and, wrapping a sheet around him, prepared to consiga him to a watery grave; terrible to see the dear form that had so often protected and shielded them, lowered from the ship, and to hear the waves plash and gurgle as they parted to receive the body; terrible the dark, fearful night that followed, when, locked in each other's arms, the orphans allowed their wild, unutterable grief to relieve itself in tears.

Poor little Karl! he who itad scarce numbered six summers; it was a terrible scene for him to witness. As the cheering sunbeam   that struggles through filth and wretchedness till it rests beside the couch where squallid poverty and wasting disease have laid the pauper low, and, uncontaminated by the coarser materials with which it is brought in contact, emits as pure a light as when it strayed downward through fields of air, so did the young Rosalie seem as she glided froin berth to berth, now administering a cooling draught, now gently moistening the parched lips, and ever and anon dropping a sad, sweet smile as though to encourage the suffering ones by whom    shb was surrounded. It was a motley crew with which that old, weather- beaten ship was peopled. Rosalie heard her mother tongue spoken in every variety of forms, many of the dialects so entirely different from her own, as to be perfectly unintelligible. And thus it came that she was, as it were, alone on' the ship;- for, although nine- tenths of the crew had sufficient education to under- stand the high German, which she spoke, she found it  &#xD;<pb n="36-37" xml:id="VAC7466-00000019"/> 8MMA BARTT T:. OR, utterly impossible to comprehend the multiplicity of dialects that continually fell upon her ear. In this, as well as in some other respects, the Eng- lish' language excels all others, for, while in many parts of Europe, as with the various Indian tribes, the inhabitants of one place find difficulty in conversing with those of another, we can travel over the length and breadth of our Union, making use of one common language to express our'ideas. Yet, though denied the privilege of a free inter- change of thought, the Franconian maiden, by the light of her presence and, her gentle, winning ways, won the hearts of many on board, whose beaming eyes and expressive looks of gratitude, aside from their oft- repeated thanks, amply rewarded the lovely minister for her unwearied attentions. The cry of "Land in sight!" seemed a welcom'e sound to every ear; even to those who still lay helpless and prostrated by the fever that had so thinned their number; but though Rosalie strained her eyes to catch a faint glimpse of the land they were approach- ing, her heart sank within her, and a shudder passed through her frame as she thought of the future; clasping the tiny hand of her brother more firmly, she continued gazing steadfastly forward, and musing on her forlorn condition. Where would she go? What would she do?

"Just read that," cried the person addressed, rising and handing his interrogator the paper, as he pointed, with his fore-finger, to a particular column ; "just read it," he repeated emphatically, and see if it don't make your flesh crawl!"

"Then sir," said the philanthropist, pertinaciously clinging to the subject, " you deny that such things occur." "As you insist upon prolonging this subject; I will merely say, that I am myself an Alabamian, and after spending two-thirds of my life in that State, have anivedr -chanced to be- an eye-witness of .-any such scenes, and if of - such frequent occurrence, it is passing strange nothing of the kind has ever come under my 4Bservati." -  : -But fuirther South, sir; there may have been a misftakle in the-State," persisted the Yankee.

Both -contempt and pity might have be detected in the expression that flitted over the .S therner's face during this eloquent harangue, and when finished, he merely replied: "My friend, you are just at that age when zeal often outstrips discretion-; and let me say to you, that unless you have -no desire to see- slavery abolished, avoid cooperating with these prying, intermeddling, insulting abolitionists, who, while endeavoring to aid  us by proffering assistance, entirely unneeed. get that they could do infinitely bette by turnin, their attention to -the degraded beings thronging their own streets, many of them reduced to tleir present forlorn condition merely because the same assistance is with- held, which: our Northern brethren geii'u  ^offir- 4  &#xD;<pb n="42-43" xml:id="VAC7466-00000022"/> 42       EmA BARTSlT: OR, to us.

Rudely the throng brushed by her, and now and then a strange face would pause and gaze admiringly, by the glimnmer of the wavering lights that kept moving to and fro. Fully  occupied with his business, Mr. Dare did not observe the- face of exceeding loveliness upon which the Southerner's eye was riveted; and when his attention was called in that direction, by Mr. Mitchell, he exclaimed with some warmth: "She's right down handsome, for a 'Dutch girl! aint she?" "Hush!  said the Southerner, softly, "she might hear you."

She did not venture a second glance until, Mr. Dare approaching, addressed her in her own tongue.   What a thrill of delight those few words sent to the heart of the young girl!  Surrounded as she had been for so long, by those whose dialect was unintelligible to her; standing as she had been for an hour, confused and bewildered by the hurry and  bustle of the ship, the words of the stranger fell upon her ear like an echo wafted from her native land.  &#xD;<pb n="46-47" xml:id="VAC7466-00000024"/> 4EMMA BARTLETT: OR, Raising her eyes timidly, she replied, in the rich Franconian accent, and, when-further interrogated, briefly i related to him the series of misfortunes that had reduced her to her present destitute situation. Mr. Mitchell watched her animated features as she proceeded with her touching recital, and though he could not compre- hend her words, he knew by the varying color of her cheek, and the tears glistening in her eye, that it was not devoid of interest. ' Has she no protector, no parents?" asked the South- erner, as Rosalie ceased speaking. "No, but give yourself no uneasiness on her account, air; she shall be well cared for," and turning, he again addressed the orphan in German. Und mein kleiner Bruder," she said, gazing fondly at the child she held by the hand. Again she was answered in German, and Mr. Mit, chellnoticed the look of confiding trust she bestowed upon the speaker. "What are you going to do with her?" the South. erner ventured to ask, his sympathies fully aroused by her forlorn condition. "Do the best we can," was the reply, "w'e endeavor to do that for all who come."      ' "It is a great pity she is Dutch," thought M it. ehell, endeavoring to withdraw his gaze from the face upon which it seemed riveted; " we seldom meet crea- tures half so beautiful.

What nation on the globe surpasses Germany for inventive genius? and as for ancestry, trace back your pedigree as far as you can, and your coat of arms will show no prouder name than that inscribed on the escutcheon of the Huttens. But Mr. Mitchell had not been informed of this fact, the prejudices of education had0 made him regard all foreigners as a little inferior to those of his own nation: and with these feelings he could but turn from the orphan whose exceeding beauty had so inter- ested him, regretting that she was a foreign pauper; while, had an opportunity been presented to test her education and accomplishments, he would have found her far better fitted to occupy a place among the elite of society than many of those who, with small preten- sions, flutter around our fashionable drawing-rooms. And so, after a short time spent in musing, Mr. Mit. chell went his way, leaving the orphan to the care of Mr. Dare, and yet that evening, as he mingled in the ilance, and listened to the voluptuous swell of music flooding the elegant parlors of his Boston acquaintance, the vision of beauty he had beheld seemed gliding before him the lone, unprotected orphan, with her timid, trustful glance, seemed ever at his side.. o              '     O a  3 B  .n  &#xD;<pb n="48-49" xml:id="VAC7466-00000025"/> 48 IEMMA BARTLETTr OR, Miss Bartlett was never seen to better advantage than on the evening in question; there was a peculiar. fascination in her -manner, and withal a charming reserve, a something between the- retiring, dignified manners of the ladies of -the South, and the -self-con- fident reliance often observable in their northern sisters.              , It was conceded by all, that Miss Bartlett was not only intelligent and agreeable, but brilliant and beau- tiful; and moreover, many of her female friends aver- red that she possessed a very warm heart, the falsity . of which opinion fa number of male -acquaintanceg asserted they could prove from actual experience. , As the Southerner's eye followed her sylph-like figure float- ing about, he acknowledged internally he -had seen but one to whom she might surrender the palm for personal charms; and that one, (he was loth to confess it), was the orphan on the ship., Miss Bartlett made a conquest that night; and it is not to be wondered at that she wlas considered the favored of fortune; for Mr. Mitchell was a great "' catch," and with all their lively sympathies for the "poorl unfortunate blacks under the galling yoke of oppress.  ion," and their repugnance to a 4" system which holds a fellow man in servitude," it not unfrequently happens that our Yankee girls accept the first offer of a home among a people whose principles they so thoroughly detest.

Scarce had Mr1. Dare's footsteps died away, when a, low knock fell upon Rosalie's ear. With a  constant fear that some  new misfortune might befall her, she hesitated about replying to the summons, and, after waiting until' the knock was repeated, she was startled , '      J  &#xD;<pb n="52-53" xml:id="VAC7466-00000027"/> 52       OMMA BARTLETT: OR, :by the opening of the door without her assistance. Before she could calm her agitation, the same servant who had led the way to their apartment, entered, bear- ing a tray, over which was spread a snowy cloth. The girl smiled as she approached the table and deposited her burden; then raising the napkin, she motioned to Rosalie to approach and partake of the repast. Forget- ting that they spoke different languages, the orphan murmured forth her thanks, as her eye fell upon the smoking rolls, golden butter, and hot coffee set before her, but the servant only shook her head, smiled, and said, "can't verstehe," the latter word comprehending her entire knowledge of the German language. Faint and weary as she was, Rosalie felt the need of nourishment, and seating herself, silently partook of the refreshments. The girl, meanwhile, drew Back, and pushing the window curtain aside, seemed absorbed in gazing at the gas-lights below; yet occasionally she stole a quick, sharp glance at the orphan's face; ihe beauty of those features had evidently attracted her attention.

"Karlchen," said Rosalie, comprehending her move- ments; then shaking her head, to intimate that she did not wish him disturbed, she buttered one of the rolls and laid it aside till he should awake. Mr. Dare was punctual; he called as he had promised,   PREJUDICE AND-, FANATICISM.    i on the following morning. Rosalie met him with a smile; his winning manner and softly spoken words were any thing but calculated to arouse her suspicions; and when he told her that he had found a home for the little Karl, with those who would take the, same care of him as if he were their own, they havig just lost an only son about his age; .whe- in 'gene persuasive accents, he strove to convince her it was her duty to give him up, knowing, as she must, that parents of experience were better fitted to rear him than herself; when he urged her to consent to his taking the child that morning, for, as he said, the place might be lost by delay ; when in reply to her entreaties' to accompany him, in order to see for herself those to whom he wished her to relinquish the boy, he asked her, in a slightly reproachful tone, patting Karl's rosy cheek the while, if she were not willing to confide in him, promising that she might visit her brother at some future period; the poor girl, overwhelmed by the thought of parting from the little one, yet fearing a refusal would call forth her friend's displeasure, and perhaps deprive them both of his protection, burst into tears, and turn. ing her eyes from the earnest gaze of those soft, hazel orbs, she murmured the words of acquiescence that seemed wrung from her heart. Yet, as she did so, she inwardly resolved that no time should elapse before a letter was dispatched to-Roderic, and he, she felt sure, would either come or send for them immediately.

Full of these thoughts, she lifted the little fellow in her arms, and promising, with a quivering voice, to come and see him  very soon; for a moment 'she strained him to her bosom, and then whispered a scarce audible good-bye. But the child, for the first time fully realizing that they were to be parted, clasped his dimpled hands firmly around her neck, and pressing his velvet cheek to hers, sobbed convulsively Poor Rosalie! she cast a beseeching look at him whom she regarded as her onlyf friend, as the words, "How can I endure this?" fell from her lips.

Poor little fellow! she never-saw him afterward, "One step toward the fulfillment of my plan already accomplished!" ejaculated the pretended friend, in a self-satisfied tone, as he passed from the outer door and turned his steps in the direction of the poor-house, where he intended depositing his charge. And Rosalie, after the wild tumult of grief had subsided, sat down and penned a long, touching letter to her lover; telling him of all she had suffered since they had parted, and of the dependent situation in which she was placed; she spoke in glowing terms of him who had generously proffered to' act as guardian;, of his devoted attention, and her' gratitude for his' kindness; and finally, she described, with pathos, the trial she had that'morning undergone--the parting from' her brother; she knew it had been done for the best, she said, yet she felt she could not long endure the separation-; she ended by asking his advice with regard to her future course, feeling confident his heart would prompt an immediate answer. Then, having no drawing materials, she took-a pencil and traced a For- get-me-not on the space reserved' for that purpose; this done, the letter 'was sealed and directed, and she sat down to muse over her recent loss.

Mr. Dare had informed her that, as she was an entire stranger, and it was impossible for him to be there to escort her to the table, he had ordered her meals should be served in her room, an arrangement for which she, with her natural timidity, seemed truly grateful, and which more fully convince4 her of the sincerity of his friendship. The day, however, seemed long, and when the ser- vant entered with her dinner, the smile that lit up her features, her only greeting, fell like a sunbeam on Rosalie's heart. As she observed the searching-glance the girl cast round the roont, Rosalie knew she missed her brother, but being unable to communicate, she merely pointed to the door, leaving herto imagine the rest. As the evening shades gathered, Mr. Dare made his appearance, prepared to answer satisfactorily her many interrogations with regard to Karl. When about to leave, she- held up the letter, asking him to have the' goodness to drop it into thtoffice. "To a friend in Germany, is it?"

Taking the letter from her hand, Mr. Dare forebore further questioning, 'and, promising to deposit it promptly, he took his departure. Had the passer-by noticed our hero stop beneath the first lamp-post, after he had turned the corner, and deliberately break the seal of the missive entrusted to his care, he would never have mistrusted that he had no right to do so; it was done so coolly no one would have dreamed of questioning his prerogative. Nor would any one, save a calculating deceiver like himself have suspected his reasons for questioning her so closely on the following day about the friend to whom this letter was written. If he had professed such friendship, why had he not accompanied her to America? or why did she not remain with- him in Ger- many? he asked, throwing into his look and tone just enough reproach to lead the misguided girl, whose love was aroused by this reflection upon her lover's con- stancy, to explain their true position, and relate minutely the circumstances whiqh led to their separa- tion. Her auditor listened attentively, especially when she spoke of the active measures her lover had taken to effect her father's escape; and when she ended, he asked whether she had heard from Roderic since their departure.  &#xD;<pb n="58-59" xml:id="VAC7466-00000030"/> Q8      IEMMA BARTLETT: OR1 "No," was the reply ;. how could I?

Are you not uneasy, after leaving him, as you say, in so perilous a situation?" "OO! yes!" she replied, in a tone of the deepest anxiety; " but he assured me there was no danger; they could not keep him in prison." "s They could certainly do it." said Dare, anxious for the accomplishment of his purpose, to excite her appre- hension on that point; nothing could be easier than to retain him in prison on the same charge brought against your father; they would want no better pre- text to arrest than the fact that he planned your father's escape." The designer watched the effect- of these words upon his victim; he marked the quick heaving of her bosom, and knew at that moment a thousand apprehensions were torturing her heart;- he saw the long, silken lashes droop beneath his gaze as though to conceal the pearly drops swelling beneath the transparent lids; and, he was satisfied, he could ask no better evidence of the perfect reliance she placed in his words, and felt it would be an easy matter to convince her, at a future period, that such steps had really been taken. For. this purpose he had spoken, to arouse her fears that she might bo the better prepared to credit the informa-   PRE}JUDICE AND' FAATICISM.     59 tion he had in store for her. Having succeeded in thiS, and learned that she expected a letter by the next packet in accordance with a promise Roderic had made to write in a few days, and relieve her of the suspense he felt confident she would suffer until informed of his release, Mr. Dare turned his steps toward the Custom- House. Two days afterward the packet arrived, bringing the expected letter. It was handed to Mr. Dare at the post-office, whither that individual's steps were directed, as soon as his business on board ship was transacted. Steering his course homeward, he sought his room. turned the key in the door, lighted a small lamp, and drawing a chair near the table, sat down.' Then he drew the letter fronm his pocket and carefully examined the seal. It was wax. By a slow process of melting, it was removed, and the envelop unclosed; though the utmost pains was taken, the edge of the paper was slightly torn, but that could be concealed by a little additional sealing-wax. Our hero's next step was to draw out the letter, and give it a careful perusal; it was full of tender pathos and pictures of future happi- ness. "'Tis well for me-that her eye will never rest on these?paeos," he exclaimed,; as he proceeded to examine carefully the hand-writing; then taking from a drawer pen, ink and paper, he ejaculated mentally, "What a fool to think of imitating his hand, when the letter must purport to be written by a stranger, inform-  &#xD;<pb n="60-61" xml:id="VAC7466-00000031"/> 80   }BM1 BMMA BBRTLETT: OR, ing her of his sudden death,' and, without further hesitation, he penned the following brief epistle: RESPECTED MS: --In fulfillment of Roderic Sundahl's dying request, I sit down to inform you of his sudden and very unexpected death, which occurred only two days after your departure. Contrary to his expectations, he had been detained in prison on the charge of plottinog against his sov- ereign, and it was in the same cell from which your father escaped that I found him one morning, when on ray daily rounds of duty, struggling with the grim monster. His death was, from what I learned from his lips, caused by the grief with which your departure overwhelmed him, together with the prospect of several years' gloomy imprisonment. Your name was the last word he uttered, and with his latest breath he begged me to communicate the sad intelligence to you immediately. I have the honor, Miss, to be, Your obedient servant, THE JAILOR. After copying from the letter carefully the nanPe and date it bore, the writer inspected his work with aE look of satisfaction; he wrote a fair German hand, of which he might well have been proud; but on compar- ing it with the superscription on the envelop, the expression of satisfaction vanished; however, after nicely shading every letter of the light, running hand, in which the missive had been directed, it gave the whole an entirely different appearance.

Dare had little time to devote to his son, he was often heard to remark that the boy had had very careful training, and he was already beginning to see the fruits of his rigid discipline. Adam was all he could desire; strictly upright in his dealings, correct in his deportment, and a zealous advocate of the cause of humanity, ever ready to lend his assistance where the efforts tended to the extermination of the curse of slavery. The satisfied parent was always gratified by the strict attention his son gave to the reading of the chapter, and pleased, too, with the spirit of devotion he exhibited as he bent his knee and bowed his head upon his hands, while in his heart he was devising a plan such as a fiend should blush to execute.  &#xD;<pb n="62-63" xml:id="VAC7466-00000032"/> 62       EMMA BARTLET,:.

When Rosalie awoke to consciousness, Mr. Dare was standing by her side; as her shattered senses became col- lected, and remembrance brought the fearful certainty of her lover's death before her, she murmured in a painfully disconsolate tone, "Gone, all gone! and I am left alone! a "All gone!" said a low voice near her, in its tender- est accents; "all gone!" it repeated, reproachfully.

The man was evidently intoxicated, and had, as Rosa- lie gleaned from the wife's repeated charges, purloined her week's wages to purchase his dram. On seeing the young girl she ceased expostulating, and seemed greatly surprised to find one, apparently so far above them in station, in their unpretending abode.

But in what direction should she go? Bewildered by the multitude of streets through which she had threaded her way, she felt it would be impossible to return with- out the guidance of some one acquainted with their devious windings: to whom  could she apply?

Who, but a true friend, would have given her such timely advice, and, lest her reputation should suffer, urge an immediate union with her, a poor, friend- less orphan.

I can't help her any, then," and turning on her heel, she picked up her bas- ket, and trudged on.  Finding himself unable to render her any assistance, the sawyer resumed his work, while Rosalie turned heart-sick away.   PREJTDIE AND' FANATICISM.  'Handsomely dressed ladies passed her; chatting gaily, men, whose noble countenances seemed truthful indices of warm, generous hearts; laughing, joyous children, just let loose from school, whose fresh, blooming faces, radiant with smiles, and occasional bursts of merriment told they had yet to learn, by sad experience, that the world was something more than a mere play-ground. IRosalie looked at them, and sighed unconsciously as she thought how unclouded her childhood's years had b en, away off in the Fatherland. O! could she but speak the language of the passers- by, th them her sad story, add appeal to their sym- pathies, she felt sure she would not plead in vain. But alas! she must keep silence, and hasten wearily on, she knew not whither; perhaps each step she took was widening the distance between her, and the place that had been her refuge since she left the ship. "The ship!' she repeated aloud, a sudden thought striking her. i"Could I only find the ocean," she soliloquized, "perhaps he might be there-it was on board ship we first met." It was the last hope that remained, and, redoubling her pace, she hurried on in a direction oppo- site to where she had seen the sun disappear. It was about dask, on the same evening, when Mr. Dare turned his back to the harbor, and bent his steps homeward; he had been called in that direction; as usual, by the arrival of a ship, and had only proceeded a -few- steps when he w:s Qvertaken - by :his. fraieid  &#xD;<pb n="72-73" xml:id="VAC7466-00000037"/> 72      --EMMA BARTleTT':-, OR, 'a[Yt , as he familiarly called him.

"Not to-night I imagine; arrangements must first be made; that 's where I need your assistance," said Dare, giving his companion a significant -look. "Halloa, Adam! turn round, there's a lady speaking to you." Dare did as he was desired, but started back in amazement, as he perceived amid the gathering gloom, the form of Rosalie;. he passed his hand across his eyes, evidently believing he labored under an-illu- sion. The poor girl could not speak; for hours her search had been fruitless, and, at last, coming in sight of the ocean, she had determined to seek among the ships.

Mr. Dare was not grieved to learn Rosahe had wandered all day in the streets. "Experience is a good teacher," he said, as she tobk his proffered arm without hesitation. "It was well you found me before night came on," he added. i Rosalie shuddered as she thought of the narrow escape she had made, for even then night's sable cur- tain rendered surrounding objects indistinct. And so you couldn't find the hotel again," he said, laying his hand softly Uipon the one that trembled on his arm. "No," she replied, "and your name, I had never heard it ;[it is strange I had not asked you what it was.' "My name! ah yes ; so you do not know it yet-it is anusipg that I should have endeavored to persuade you to change yours without offering you another. lMy name is Adams.

' Harry" went round after tea, as he had promised; Dare met him on the steps, and, drawing him aside from the crowd loitering round the door, revealed his plan; his proposal had been acceded to, and he could consummate his plans sooner than he anticipated. It was a fortunate thing for him, he said, that the girl had taken the notion to go round that day and convince herself that no one elee would take care of her. "Was that the one you met coming from the ship?" asked his friend, evincing some surprise. "Yes, to. be sure, a rare chance. Darned good-look- ing, aint she?" Harry did not reply for several seconds ; he seemed revolving the subject in his mind. They stood in the shadow of the house, and Dare could not see the effect his disclosure produced." "And so you want me to act as parson," he said, at length, taking a survey of his portly person.

"Well now, look here, Adam, I never did the like ip my life; I aint the proper person, for the fact is, I don't know how; she'd suspect me right straight off, and then all your pains would be for nothin'; but if you say so, I 'll bring a man round in a jiffy that 'll do the thing right up; one that looks for all the world like a preacher." "You needn't go to that trouble, you '1l do just as well: she'll not understand a word you say." "Yes, but, Adam,\it will be better to have two- lots better," he repeated, impressively, laying his hand on Dare's shoulder as he spoke, f' because then she 'll think you brought me as a witness, don't you see?" "Well," said Dare, rather reluctantly, "only be sure you don't get a real minister; that might play the devil." "Never fear," was the reply. "You know I am not a particular friend of the clergy." "Bring him up to No. 50, in the third story, and be quick as you can," said Dare, as the other turned away. As the conversation ceased, the chief cook of the hotel, who'had been busied beside the open window of the cellar kitchen, near which the two stood, preparing hash for the morrow's breakfast, suddenly drew aside the curtain concealing him from view, as though anx- ious to get a glimpse of the speakers, of whose secret   PREJUDICE AND FANATICISM.     7 plans he had had an uninterrupted hearing; but the movement was too late; they were gone. "Eh! bien! Ils ont a116!" exclaimed the Frenchman, resuming his meat-mincing. "Yes, I'll be quick," mused Henry Stanley, as he hurried on. I'll fix the chap for once; he calculates I haint got no better principles than he has, but he'll find, before long, he has missed his guess. Harry Stanley don't forget he has a mother who raised him up for something better than to deceive unprotected orphans; one who told him, when he started out in the world to shift for himself, that she'd sooner bury him forty feet under ground than ever to hear he had t'ied to lead one of her sex astray. All mothers don't talk plain that way to their sons; they consider it improper, but I calculate it would be a plagued sight better to throw way their over-nicety, and give them timely words of caution on such matters.

"But maybe," he continued, thruting his hands into his pockets, and increasing his pace, " if she knew it, she wouldn't approve of what I'm going to do. Yes she would though," he added quickly, "if she knew what Maggy told me when she came home from :.v...  &#xD;<pb n="78-79" xml:id="VAC7466-00000040"/> 8       B' MMAA BARLTT: OR, the Reverend's last summer, and would not go back there to sew any more.

"The young Judge," as Harry called him, sat in his office with a pile of papers before him. He was not reading, however, but thinking, when Stanley knocked for admittance. His face was one of those on which the eye never wearies of gazing; lofty intellect and prfound thought were interwoven with every feature. On this particular evening that noble countenance was clouded, a great sorrow was pressing on his heart; though he had struggled bravely, and in a great mea- sure succeeded inwconcealing the intensity of his grief from the eye of the world, when alone, the strong man became weak; reason and will relinquished their reign, and lovein triumph held the mastery. A. fortnight before, he had seen arrayed for its last resting place the form of one before whom his heart had long knelt in silent adoration; all his future hopes were concentrated in her; that she might be proud of him, had he burned the midnight mp and spurred himself on to distinc- tion. But the destroyer came and robbed him of his treasure. The very evening on which we introduce him to our readers was-to have witnessed the consunl- mation of their union, had not his rival, death, cheated him of his bride. Agonizing, fearfully agonizing, was this his first heart-sorrow, and had it, not been for the  &#xD;<pb n="80-81" xml:id="VAC7466-00000041"/> 80  \    EMMA BARTLETT: OR, dying entreaties of the idolized one, to struggle for the mastery, it might have pverwhelmed him. He seemed unwilling to accompany him, when Stan- ley first related the object of his visit. It would be hard, on the eve to which he had looked forward with such fond expectancy, to join others in the holy bands which he had hoped would link his fate with that of his lost Adelia; but, after a little reflection, he seemed seized with a sudden resolution. She had begged him to lie strong, and he would make the effort. Rising abruptly, he informed Stanley he was ready. / "But the certificate; you musn't forget to make that out." "True," said the other, resuming his seat, and selecting one from a pile of papers he 'took from a drawer. "The names of the parties?" he asked. "Adam Dare and Rosalie Hutten," was the reply. The blanks were filled, and the certificate carefully deposited in his pocket. It was the first time he had been called to perform a marriage ceremony, and he wished to retain it in remembrance of that event. After this he took a book from his desk, placed it under his arm, and accompanied. Stanley to the hotel. On entering the apartment, the judge seemed deeply struck with the appearance of the bride. The wild brilliancy of her eye, the deathly pallor of her face, except the scarlet flush resting on either cheek, her timid, child-like manner, and the convulsive way in *    PREJUDICE AND FANATICISM     81 which she clasped the arm that supported her, made him forget, for a time, the crushing weight on his heart. Every thing, was in readiness when they entered, and Stanley informed him it was the' ridegroom's wish that he should proceed immediately with the ceremony. He opened the book and began. A violent tremor shook Rosalie's frame as those unintelligible words fell upon her ear; she knew they were uniting her to a man toward whom she had experienced no deeper feel- ing than gratitude. By association, her fervent love for Roderic was recalled; his wild devotion and vows of eternal constancy, and then the terrible news of his death. Her gaze was fixed intently upon the face of him she had been told was a minister, and when he asked, raising his eyes from the book and directing them. toward her, "Do you promise," etc., while an expression of unutterable woe overspread her features, she bowed her head and repeated the lesson she had that evening learned from her betrayer's lips-the sin- gle woed, "yes." He had told her when the minister looked toward her, she must reply with the only English word she had ever attempted to pronounce, and she had obeyed. When Dare, the cool, calculating deceiver, who was first asked the solemn question, replied with well- assumed sincerity, he little dreamed that the one who stood up to unite them was legally authorized to do so.  &#xD;<pb n="82-83" xml:id="VAC7466-00000042"/> 82       EMMA BARTLETT: ORB Yet so it happened and Rosalie became his lawfully wedded wife. His work accomplished, the judge saw no further need of his services, and bowing politely, withdrew. Stanley joined him in the hall.

I'll call and explain this mat- ter in a few days; you've helped me to thwart some devilish planning to-night," and with these words he returned to the room, leaving the judge to wonder at his remarks, and entirely incapable of solving the mys- tery surrounding this singular marriage. The man, however, had promised to call; per!laps then he would explain as he had said. But Stanley never called, n'or did he ever again on earth behold the mother whose counsel and advice had been to him a safeguard and bencon-light whenever temptation lured him from the beaten track. On that very night, as he hurried over the neck leading to Rox- bury, where his mother and sister resided, a heavy blow from an unseen hands (tile ruffian evidently mis- taking him for the one for whom he had lain in wait), descended with full force upon his head, killing -him instantly.

And what's more, you couldn't under- stand her ayther, for she talks with her mouth instead of her nose." The Frenchman didn't exactly like the girl's com- parison ; being accustomed, however, to her odd expres- a sions, he let it pass without comment. "What's ze number of her chambre?" .he asked, his thoughts instantly reverting to the words that had fallen on his ear a few evenings previous. "No. 50," was the reply.  "Eh, bien! Oui, oui!" he exclaimed, abstractedly, "i ze same," he added, turning to the girl. "Faith, sir, -and you're mistaken," returned that individual, misinterpreting the first part of his excla- mation, "I she aint from your counthry, so you needn't say we ;' didn't I tell ye she' spakes with her mouth-?  :'The cook smiled good-humoredly, and then- -went" on   to relate theonver sation had overhear  the to relate the -conversation Xfe had overheard-at the window.

Rosahe was sitting with her face buried in her hands when the two servants entered; she had been weeping. All day an unwonted sadness had. oppressed her, partly occasioned by a dream she had on the previous night, partly by Mr. Dare's manner toward her that morning. She had dreamed Roderic came to her, and, taking her hand gently in ihis, as was his wont in former days, had pointed with the other to Dare, and gazing at her with a melancholy smile, had uttered the single word, "Beware." Never since they parted had those features seemed so distinct; -never had hie voice sounded so ear- nest, so full of tender anxiety.

MMA -&amp;WF!u. : 03, strange, sad smile resting on those phantom features haunt her memory. Before Dare left that morning, she had asked about a   EKarl, and reminded him of his promise. He had replied in a tone somewhat abrupt, and had given her to understand she must not expect such a thing; the child was better off wher'e he was, he said; besides, business would call him away from the city in a few days; he had no time to look after the child,and would probably be absent several weeks. The implicit confidence she had hitherto placed in him was for the first time shaken, when she heard him refuse to comply with his promise; still she could not feel wholly discouraged. Again she ventured to ask if at some future period she might not hope :to have her brother with her. When, a second time, she was positively denied, and told never to expect any thing of the kind, a vague suspicion -that he was about to abandon her passed through her mind. One that could so easily forget such a promise, might not consider any binding that fell from his lips. Besides, he had spoken of leaving the city in a few days.  She was startled from these reflections by the en- trance of the servants. The Irish girl advanced as usual, with a smile; and, as Rosalie looked up, she pointed toward the cook. Imagining from the girl's movement that he could speak German, the orphan addressed him in her own language.   PREJUDICE AND FANATIISM.      87 But the Frenchman shook his head, saying, "Je no comprend."  "Fpanzosich!" she exclaimed, brighten- ing; "Vous parlez Frangois?"  He had touched the right key this time, for Rosalie, like most of the educated -Germans, spoke the French readily, and to Biddy's infi- nite satisfaction they were soon busily engaged "spakin' with their noses."' "Shure, and '1ll ventur to say that he'slUin' her now how the dirty scamp decayed her intirely," solilo- quized Biddy, watching narrowly the changing expres- sion of Rosalie's features. "Och, but its dhreadful to see her look so disthressed like." Yes, Rosalie listened, and though she would fain have disbelieved the words, the conviction seemed to fasten itself on her, that they were true. The deep concern, too, visible on the Irish girls face, went to coufirm her in the belief. Then, as she recalled his words with regard to Karl, his avowed intentionto be absent several weeks, and finally, that strange mysterious dream, that ever kept flitting through her brain, they all seemed to convince her of the fact. With her eyes fixed on the floor, she sat silently musing for some minutes; on arousing from her revery she found herself alone. The servants, having nothing  further to conmmunicate, had noiselessly zrtired, leaving her to poader on the information they had brought. And with this conviction of the truth came an utter loathing of her betrayer; an earnest wish, never to  &#xD;<pb n="88-89" xml:id="VAC7466-00000045"/> 88        EMMA BARTLETT: OR, behold him again ; a strong desire to flee from his grasp, to escape from his power, and go anywhere that might rid her of his presence. Recollecting it was at about that time of evening he generally came, she started up, determined, if possible, to escape; life was nothing to her now; bereft of all her friends, and betrayed by a villain, she could think of nothing worse that could befall her, and opening her chamber door she stepped into the hall, and looked down t he winding stair-way; the vestibule bel6w was brilliantly lighted, and filled with moving forms; should she dare to escape through it, she might. fall into the hands of some other unprincipled fellow, or perhaps meet the very one from whom   she wished to escape. That thought increased her terror.  Quickly retracing her steps, she hurried to a back window of the chamber leading out on to a gallery running the whole length of the house, meeting another extending its breadth at right angles, raised the sash and stepped out; without any more definite motive than that she wished to widen the distance between herself and the chamber he would enter, she hurried along the gallery until she reached the farthest extremity; there was not a single light in the rooms she passed, the occupants having col- lected in the different parlors, nearer the'front of the building. The new moon had just emerged from some dark clouds, which till then had concealed it, and, bend- ing:-over the railing, by its faint light she discovered a :similar gallery below; could that be reached, it would, e'"f   PREJUDICEB AMDT FANATICISM.     89 bring her within one story of the ground; this, she saw after further investigation, could only be effected in one way- by sliding down the outside pillar. It would be a dangerous undertaking, but desperation gave her strength of purpose, and she resolved to attempt it. Had the full glare of day revealed the fearful hight she looked down from, her head might have grown dizzy; but the glimmering moon-light partially concealed the distance; as it was, she did not shrink; the timidity of her nature seemed in that -moment changed to iron resolution. Climbing to the outside, she clasped her hands firmly round the post and resigned herself to her fate. Her courage did not fail until iner hands touched the lower railing; she had -descended more rapidly than was expected, and instead of alighting, her feet had slid- den beyond. 'And thus suspended by her hands, and unable to render. herself the least assistance, she hung. What a multitude of thoughts thronged her brain at that instant! Her mother's dying words, her father's burial, Roderic's parting embrace, all passed like a flash before her, and, as she felt herself gradually growing weaker, she commended herself to heaven, and allowed her cramped fingers to Irelax their hold. 8  &#xD;<pb n="90-91" xml:id="VAC7466-00000046"/> -CHAPTER IX CHAPTER I]:.

IT was the eve of Mr. Mitchell's marriage: although always fastidious with regard to dress, he had consumed a much longer period of time in arranging his toilette than usual; this done, he drew his chair out on the second gallery, upon which the back door of his chamber opened, and taking from its case an exquisitely flavored cigar, threw himself into the chair, tilted it back, and gave himself up to meditation. His thoughts did not take precisely the same turn they had some yeartspre- vious, when in a state of unusual perturbation he had entered the carriage that was to convey him to the home of his southern bride. The inward joy he felt' might have been as'deep and pure as the love that had first been awakened in his bosom; but experience had taught rm    PRJUDBIC  Am  rFANATICrSM.     9 him to take things more calmly now-to wait compo. sedly until the important moment came. The young moon, but faintly visible, had glided from her bed of clouds to steal a glance earthward ; as his eye caught her dimly, defined disk, association carried his thoughts to his southern home. With his mind's eye he could see Deerwood, as it was called., with its noble mansion, verdant lawns dotted with  white cabins, and shady groves stretching away in the distance; he could see the dark forms moving to and fro, and hear the occasional snatches of song bursting from hearts unbur, dened by care. Then from   the group of dark faces assembled near the threshold of thei main building, a fairy form seemed to rise; a soft baby face, dimpled with sunny smiles, met .his view; and, as two chubby hands were held out imploringly, from its coral lips fell, in broken accents, the first Word they had learned to lisp-"Pa-pa!" Half forgetting that scores of mile! separated him from his treasure, Mr. Mitchell bent forward, and as the look of paternal love beaming from his eye broke over his fine features in a radiant smile, he exclaimed, in a tone eloquent of the tender feelings stirring his bosom - "Darling Pussy!"I   . As he thus mused, with his gaze fixed above him, his attention was arrested by the neatest foot imaginable protruding from the upper gallery; its mate quickly fol- lowed, and, before the gazer had time to recover from his A' 'I  &#xD;<pb n="92-93" xml:id="VAC7466-00000047"/> 2       EMMA BARTLETT: OR, surprise, he perceived a figure gliding down: the tall pil- lar; he rose to his feet, and by the glimmering light saw it was a woman. What could it mean?   He moved toward it ; but ere he had reached the spot it had stopped; the next instant he discovered her perilous condition. A moment's hesitation would have rendered assistance use- less; grasping the suspended form instantly, he lifted it over the railings and laid it on the floor. His next movement was to hasten to his room, ring for a servant, and order a light. His summons was obeyed without delay. Snatching the lamp from the servant's hand, he hurried back to the figure he had rescued, leaving Biddy standing in the door-way waiting further orders. Although prostrated in strength, Rosalie remained perfectly conscious, and her first impression on beholding Mr. Mitchells face, was, that her betrayer must be near. It was a just inference, for had she not seen them together on the ship? Gathering up her little remaining strength, as she saw him turn and beckon some one to approach, she gained her feet, rushed pastthe astonished Irish girl, through the'room into the hall, and from thence down the stair-way; pushing her way through the throng surrounding the outer door, she hurried on as though super-human strength was given her. On, on she went, and when at length exhausted, by the extraordinary effort, she was compelled to slacken her pace, with a weary step she moved along, unheeding the crowds shej passed, and never daring to look back; all the timidity   PREJUIDICE AND FANATICISM.     93 of her nature seemed condensed in the one great fear,. that the person who had snatched her from the pillar, might be in pursuit, for the purpose of taking her back to him who had robbed her life of allits sunshine; for the orphan, by a quick --process of reasoning, had conclu- :ded that they were intimate friends. Twas a pity she did the Southerner such gross injustice, and never learned the falsity of her opinion. After wandering about for an hour, over-taxed nature at length gave way, and, pausing in front of a row of buildings, she looked wist- fully up. The broad stone steps leading to the entrance were environed by a light railing of wrought iron, sur- mounted by highly, polished brass knobs. Should she seek admittance, and endeavor by signs to appeal to the charities of its inmates?  Like her former efforts, this might prove fruitless; yet she would make the trial. I  Slowly ascending the steps she applied her hand to the bell-knob and ventured to ring; she waited a full minute, but no reply came to her summons; again and again it was repeated, with no better success; at last, utterly dis- couraged, she sank, faint and exhausted, on the steps, every hope of relief quenched by the dark despair that took possession of her spirit. Meanwhile, Mr. Mitchell, who had recognized those features the instant he beheld them, stood lost in aston- ishment, as the' flying figure passed from his sight, while Biddy, with eyes dilated and lips apart, remained transfixed to the spot until Rosalie's form was lost from  &#xD;<pb n="94-95" xml:id="VAC7466-00000048"/> 4        BEMMA BARTLETT: OR, y4w, and then, with the exclamatioi; "It's the poor young craythur a-thryin' to make way wit herself!" she followed in pursuit.

"Did you ever hear her name?" asked the South- erner, his thoughts turning in. disgust from t he' men- tion of one who could so coolly work out and execute such a fiendish plan.

I Thank ye, sir," said the girl, hastening to the kitchen to relate the circumstance to the cook. It was an impressively solemn scene, that marriage ceremony. Miss Bartlett's beauty and amiability had made her a favorite with all--not her wealth. Her aged parents, with whom she resided, had never boasted more tihal an ordinary share of worldly goods; yet, ,though lacking in earthly possessions, the wealth of affection lavished upon them by the two heart-jewels shin- ing in the home-casket, had made life beautiful to them. Years before, their eldest born and only son had left the paternal roof to brighten by his presence another fireside; to sit down with his laughing, blue-eyed bride, and with the true, abiding love that had mingled their kindred spirits together, to lay the foundation for:  little Eden at home,just as the aged ones, now trem. bling on the verge of the grave, had done 'in life's young Spring.

And now Anna, the gentle, loving daughter was about, to leave, them - the pet of the household, the child of their old age. Truly did it-seem to them the severest trial of their lives to give her up. If she were going to settle among them, as their son had done, it might have been easier to bear ; but her home would be away, far away, and, stricken in years as they were, their summons might come ere she returned to her native home. They had been urged to" accompany the -bride, but they shook their silvered locks and said, with a sad smile, that they could never leave Boston, the dear old spot hallowed by a thousand tender memories. No place on earth would seem like it to them, yet would they raise no objection to the Southerners claim when he asked for their Anna, for: they knew she loved him; and they had only to look in each other's eyes, old and dim as they were, or upon the furrowed cheeks, where time's fingers had left their traces, to recall a host: of fond recollections that even then warmed the blood 'flowing languidly through their veins.

It made an interesting picture, the group assembled on the evening of which we write. It was pleasant to let the eye rove from one face to another, and to watch the varied expressions of the different countenances. The minister's face had a something so fascinating in it you could not pass it by with a single glance; around his benevolent features a holy light seemed to play as he advanced to meet the two who presented themselvps before him. His rich accents grew tremulous as the ceremony proceeded; and as the stifled sobs of his mother fell upon his ear, they sank almost to a whisper. It was touching to see them; that family band, assembled perhaps for the last time on earth, to resign to another's keeping the one who had so long gladdened their hearthstone.

Emma Bartlett, the minister's wife, was the last of the family to offer her congratulations. With her sunny disposition, she could not long endure an atomos. phere of sadness, and, like some light-footed fairy, she kept scattering sunbeams wherever she went. "'You have my sincere wishes for your happiness, Anna, dear," she said, as her coral lips touched those of-the bride; then, as a mischievous smile played around the corner of her mouth, she added, in a tone just loud enough to be heard by the newly wedded pair, " but I am afraid my sister's mind will be seri- ously exercised with regard to the darkies; she is, I believe, the only abolitionist our family can boast." The bride blushed a little but did not deny the charge. "We will not undertake to argue the point with her,". interposed Mr. Mitchell, "but wait and see if a few years' residence in the South pwill not change her opinion.". 'Twould be of little use to open a discussion now," returned Mrs. Bartlett, laughing, "for Anna and I have worn the subject threadbare long ago; you can't imagine what profound reasoners we are." "Talking politics, Emma?" asked the minister join. ing the trio.  '?

"When two such eminent logicians call on me to den cide the respective merits of their arguments, the honor thus conferred so overpowers me, it renders me unfit to be a competent judge," he returned, with a bow and a -pleasant smile. An hour afterward, as the minister sat trying to divert his parent's thoughts from the parting that would come with the morrow, he received a hasty ^ummons to attend the dying-bed of one of his parishioners; as the invalid resided only a few doors from their dwelling, his wife concluded to accompa y him, thus saving him a walk back.'       6 "It 'scloudy to-night, isn't it?" she asked, as they reached their steps.

Yes, Rdsalie slept; and in light-winged dreams she was back in the Fatherland; sh. was a child again, roaming along the beautiful Main, gazing on the varied foliage, and mocking the birds with her silvery voice. Roderic was by her side, wreathing in her sunny tresses the flowers he loved the best, and repeating to her lis- tening ear a legend of love in the olden time. Thus had she slumbered and dreamed for hour after hour, and more than once had the young moon looked wonderingly down, as though loth to believe that the fair creature lying there on the cold stone, destitute, friendless, and alone, was the same free, laughing maiden she had seen in other years, sportively reaching her hand from the casement of her father's mansion to catch the golden beams. that came trembling through the foliage. As the gates of dream-land opened to release her spell-bound senses, the silken cord of remeni- brance binding her to the past snapped suddenly, and with a, smile upon her lips the sleeper awoke. This sudden dissolving of a blissful dream-this  arousing to consciousness, and life's stern realities - how bitter it is at times! A keen pang shot through the orphan's heart as the dream faded, and her true position flashed across her.    PREJITDlECE AND FANATIISM.  Noticing her bewildered gaze, the minister asked kindly, "What has brought you here, my poor child?" Rosalie shook her head, and replied in her mother tongue. "A German!" exclaimed Emma, in' surprise, "who would have thought it." "We will take her in, Emma, and when Lena comes we will hear her story;" and with this he unlocked the door, and beckoned Rosalie to follow. And thus it happened that the orphan at last found a shelter. The good man did not doubt her story, as many more cautious might have done; he had witnessed all kinds of vice and deception in that populous city, and experience had taught him not to credit the words of all who appealed to his benevolence. In this case, however, he acted without hesitation; the quivering of that slight frame, the tear-dimmed eye, the choking sobs, all told him, before the interpretation reached his ear, that no mask concealed her real character.

It was amusing to follow her wondering glance as she entered her Southern home. The cordial reception she received astonished her; first, as the heavy gate leading into the avenue was swung open, and her ear caught the pleasant "Welcome back, Mas'r Charles," from the venerable negro who stood with head uncovered until the carriage passed through: then the array of curious black faces, peering from the gallery as she ascended the steps, all radiant with good-humor, and every one seeming -equally- anxious to be the first to say, "How d'ye," to Mas'r Charles. Then the pleasure beaming from their eyes, when, after she was seated, they came in separately and in order to get an in- troduction to "Mas'r Charles' new wife."  She took reluctantly the preferred hand of the first who presented herself, for she could not help feeling a repugnance to touching the "black creatures," but her husband did not seem afraid of the contact, and overcoming her aversion with a strong effort, she returned their greet- ing with as gEod a grace as -possible.

"Ah! I beg pardon, aunty ; meant to have done it, by all means.

"Yes, dat I has!" chimed in Aunt Milly, encircling Katy with one arm, and extending the disengaged hand  to her new mistress. "I tell you Miss  what's de  r fust name?" "Anna," said Mr. Mitchell. -"I tell you, Miss Anna," she continued, pointing to her master; "( he was a prime boy when he was young; many's de time he has cried to sleep with Aunt Milly; dat he has," she repeated, hugging Katy closer. How strangely this all seemed. to the bride ; the negro talking in that familiar way, and caressing the child as if it were her own! She had seen nothing of the kind at the North, where thousands were daily "commisera- ting the condition of this oppressed race." Even then the scales were beginning to fall from her eyes. t "I will leave you for a little while, Anna," said Mr. Mitchell," advancing toward the door; then turning to the negro, he said, "You will see your Miss Anna wants for nothing," and passed out.

"She seetned so weary I thought she had better retire; and,'" she continued, approaching him, "you may say I acted foolishy, but she and Lena are so entirely different, I could not bear the thought of her sharing Lena's lodgings, below, so I put her in Nellie's room."

But who, the reader may ask, was Nellie, the one of whom they had spoken? Only a baby, when Mr. Bartlett found her one morn- ing on- the door-step, just where Rosahe had been dis- covered. Neither husband or wife paused to inquire how she came there, but, following the generous impul- ses of their natures, they had taken the helpless little innocent to their hearts, ministered to its wants, and watched over it with the tenderest care.

Mrs. Bartlett was not long in learning that her pro tegd needed no instruction in needle-work. "In fact," she said to her husband, when speaking of their charge, "her needle-work excels every thing of the kind I have ever seen.

For the love then awakened, had not grown old with time.  "A letter for Rosalie," said Mr. Bartlett, entering his wife's apartment a month after the orphan made her appearance among them. "From Germany, too," he added, handing it to his wife; "I just happened to think some one might have written, and so asked for her. Judging from the date, it has lain in the office some time.".  "Here is something for you, Rosalie," said Mrs. Bartlett, opening her chamber door; "something you did not expect,. I guess." Rosalie looked up from her sewing, and extending her hand, said, "I t'ank, you;" putting the limited  knowledge she had acquired into practice. The door closed; she glanced at the superscription; her eye, as if caught by magic, seemed riveted on the hand-writing. Surely, she could not be mistaken; it must be Roderic's! Yet, how could it be? Was he not dead? With a shudder she broke the seal; something fell out as she unfolded the missive, but she did not per- ceive it. With a quivering hand and an eager eye she turned to the signature, and as the closing words, "Your own Roderic," met her gaze, her cheek blanched, her brain grew dizzy, and inthe bewilderment of the moment remembrance was blotted out. -The letter dropped from 10  &#xD;<pb n="114-115" xml:id="VAC7466-00000058"/> Ift  In 1l1    .

She replied in the negative; she had looked repeatedly for it, after recovering from the sudden shock caused by the news of her lover's death, but to no purpose. "As I expected; then this Adams, as he called him- self, forged it, and fearing your suspicions might be   PRBJUDIOR AND RACN4ICISM.

"Poor child!" he added, turning to his wife, "she did not dream of such intrigue and villainy." When, at length, left alone, the contending emotions aroused within the bosom of the orphan, made her slight frame tremble. To her it was joy unspeakable to know that Roderic still lived: yet the thought was terrible, A that an insuperable gulf had been placed between them - that she could never be his. Bat why need this torture her? she asked, looking at her thin, almost trans- parent hand and emaciated arm; 'twoud only be a little while, she knew, until the spirit burst its fetters. But, O! to see him once more; to feel his touch upon her brow; to look into his eyes, and hear him softly breathe her name, as he had in the days gone by. As the wish grew into a wild, earnest longing, it took the form of a resolution, and to herself she promised, as she stood with the letter pressed fondly to her lips, that if life's span were lengthened out until the Summer came; and her strength revived with its genial breath, she would go back to the Fatherland, and, after gazing once more on him who had ever been faithful to her, she would lie down on her native shoies, and die. The money he had sent would be sufficient to take her back, and for that purpose it should be preserved.  &#xD;<pb n="116-117" xml:id="VAC7466-00000059"/> 1:1'6      EMMA BARTLETT: OR,9 The October moon, that had witnessed the orphan's! escape, waxed, waned and disappeared- from view, then the Night Queen again came forth with her golden seep. ter to hold her sway over the dreamy November; and as she vanished, old Winter stole on apace with his piercing blasts and glittering frost - gems, to give way  in turn to the smiling, gladsome Spring, when earth's bosom was again covered with verdure, and the stream- lets in the meadows leaped upfor very joy. Then, as the sunbeams deepened, lavishing warmer kisses eon the blossoms faint and weary, the young Spring bowed her head, and expired in the arms of Summer. On the evening of a sultry day, toward the latter part of June, stifled sobs might have been heard to proceed from one apartment in the minister's dwelling. It was the room occupied by his aged parents. The venerable father, who hadio long set them a pattern of Christian excellence, 1. breathing his last.

Thus was a new life placed upon the stage of action just as the last sands of an old one had dropped from the hour-glass of time. A child was born, an old veteran taken, and when the morning sun arose, that household numbered as many souls as when it sank, on the evening previous, beneath the western horizon. Perhaps it is often thus that the messengers who come, undiscerned, to rob one hearth-stone, bring to another a young existence, yet seldom do they set in the -bosom of .the same family a new gem ere the faded jewel is removed from the household casket. L Weeks flew by; the young mother, worn to a sha i:  ;" by constant grief and anxiet, sat with her i her knee, gazing on its fac with a sad tenthdi    - while ever and anon, as she asked herself the question, "What will become of it when I am taken?" a sigh would escape ,her lips. Lena had repeatedly told Mrs. Bartlett that Rosalie had often expressed a strong desire to breathe her last on her native shore, and.^even when the little stranger came, twining its love-tendrils around her heart, she had said, if the- good lady would promise to become a vmther to her balie, for its sake she would resign it to her keeping, go back to the Fatherland, and die in peace.

Deep as was his interest in the orphan, she remembered he had more than once remarked that her anxiety on Rosalie's account had paled the roses on her cheek, and nights of watchfulness with the child, he would argue, -would have no tendency to restore their bloom. However, when Rosalie signified  her intention of I returning, and taking the  little one with her, when Emma looked at the shadowy form that in a few months at most would be straightened for the grave, and thought how. unprotected and friendless the infant. would be, the sympathy that stirred  her bosom caused her to  make an open effort to gain her husband's consent.  One evening, after musing over the matter, she arose, opened :a bureau drawer, and took therefrom a small bundle, carefully wrapped up; after selecting several articles from the number, she rang for Lena, and gave them into her charge with directions to press them out very nicely. This done, she sought Rosalie's side, received front her arms the babe, and returned to- her own chamber.  Then began the process of arraying the * little one in these carefully preserved garments.

Another fell on the plump neckl as the little slip was fastened, and the coral ties clasped over the looped sleeves.- When its toilet was completed the infant fell asleep, and thus- arrayed, on Emma's lap the husband found it on his return from a pastoral call. She'pointed to the sleeper as he entered, but did not speak, hoping the picture might bring to his mind the lost one, and thus make a mute appeal to his sympathy. "It is a dear little thing," he said, approaching and bending over it. Don't it remind you of Nellie?" she asked, gently laying its tiny hands in his.  "Almost too young to ;race any resemblance yet'" he returned. "Well/' she said, drawing it closer to her bosom, "I'm like Lena, I love it already.; I wish we could keep it," she added, glancing up into his face. "'Twould be too .much care, Emma," he replied regarding it tenderly. "And yet such care always brings with it a recom- pense, I think." "So it does," said a voice near them. "A child in a house is a well-spring of happiness." 'Ah, mother, is it you?" asked Emma, looking up. the minister, too, bent his gaze on that aged form, had in the weeds of mourning, and, as she laid her &#xD;<pb n="120-121" xml:id="VAC7466-00000061"/> I20       EMMA, BARTLET-: O -, shriveled hand upon his shoulder, and said, in a deeply a impressive voice, "Keep the baby, my son, it may prove a blessing to you both yet," he turned his eye from her furrowed brow to his wife's face, and then, as lie touched his lips to the' soft, waxen cheek of the sleeper on her knee, he said, "Let it be as mother says,  Emma, and may Heaven enable us to rear it in the way it should, go." When Lena learned they had concluded to keep the babe, provided the mother relinquished all claims to it, she imparted the information to Rosalie, and the orphan murmured her thanks. Yet, when the servant left her presence, she folded the little one wildly to her bosom, while the low, scarce audible moan that escaped her i lips, told that her heart, lacerated and torn as it was, could give forth but a feeble wail in token of its an- 1 guish. It was as if a long-deserted harp, whose strings had one by one been sundered by successive blasts, had essayed to tune its shattered voice into a sad requiem for the melody that had departed.

IT was a pleasant afternoon, on the 4th of July; the minister and his wife were out attending a Sabbath- school celebration; the aged mother had souglit Ro- salie's room to hold, for a while, the babe, of which she daily appeared to grow more fond. "Go down stairs, child, and take the fresh air; you look as though you were dying for the want of it." Rosalie obeyed; descending by a back stair-way to the kitchen. Excepting her own and iMrs. Barllett's apartment, this was the only portion of the building she could ever be persuaded to enter, and so secluded had she kept herself, very few, even of their most intimate friends, knew of her existence. Lena was absent when she went down, but soon made her appearance.  She found Rosalie standing in the back door, looking out.

The orphan shook her head. "Do come!" plead the girl; " the children look so  pretty; nobody will see you; the blinds are down; it ; will do you good!' "Well!" said Rosalie, somewhat reluctantly, as she  turned to follow her conductor. "We must go in through the hall," Lena said, on reaching the head of the stairs. "The Sunday-school  children are coming to-night, and the back parlor is I darkened and ready for them; he has a miagic lantern  in there, and is going to show them pictures with it.  The room is locked, so just come along this way." The orphan obeyed, and soon found herself in the front parlor. Afterl gazing for some minutes at the moving forms in the street, she ventured to turn her head and look timidly around the room. Her eye caught thte piano; in an instant she was seized with an uncontrollable desire to play some of the wild strains Roderic had taught her. After exacting 'a promise from Lena to stand as sentinel at the door, she opened the instrument, and, running her fingers over the keys, began a deep, soul-thrilling strain, that made the servant, forgetful of her promise, start for- ward in wonder. This was followed by an air of touching pathos, contrasting so strikingly with the first, that   PREJUDICE AND/ PANASM.        32SM8  her single auditor unconsciously drew nearer, and stood breathless behind the performer's chair. The air died away, and then came a low prelude to a sweet, pathetic song; the music and words were beautifully adapted to each rcer, and the soft, clear voice of the singer, tremulous at first, gained strength as she-proceeded.  Lena seemed transported, as she listened; they, or rather the tune, had awakened a remembrance of her early. home; she had heard it hummed at the hearth-stone when a child, and it brought before her vision faces that had long before passed away.  It was no wonder, then, that her eye was dimmed by moisture as she listened to the follow- ing words: "Fremd bin ich hier, Und ach! ntir zu Dir, Freundlicher Abendstern, Wendet mein Blick sich gem Blinkest rmir, Ruh' Von Oben zu! Doch du bist fern, Du freundlicher Stern I Ach! und im fremdem Land. Reicht dir kein Freund die Hand. Waer' ich ein Stern Ich thaet' es gem, Gott ist nicht fern; SBi er dein Stern!

WMMA, BARTLETT: OR, ; ' There, Nellie, if you could sing in that style, father would have no reason to complain of the expense your musical instruction incurs. That is decidedly the finest voice I ever heard. Who can it be? - Mrs. Bart- lett can not sing so! Suppose we stop in; it is not too late, and you said this morning you owed her a call." "Well, Adam, if you desire it," replied Nellie Dare, for she knew how passionately fond of music her brother was. Ascending the steps, Dare applied his hand to the bell-knob; -his summons was unanswered, and a second time he rang. Louder and fuller rose the voice within; every thought seemed absorbed by the sentiments to which the singer gave utterance; and Lena, enchanted as she was by what she heard, stood with her capacious mouth apart, as though to drink in those rich, inspir- ing strains. A third peal aroused her from her trance. Rosalie started at the same instant. "Don't go!"said Lena, grasping her arm; "Ill tell whoever it is that the lady and gentleman are out, and they will go away; then you can play more. Step behind the door there!" she said, as she passed into the hall. Rosalie tremblingly obeyed; her first impulse had been to hasten into the room adjoining; but the door, as Lena had said, was fastened, and refused her admit- tance. Great Heavens! what a shudder passed through   PREUtIOt0I AND FANArTICSM. m the orphan's frame when, as Lena opened' the street door, she peered through the crevice of the one behind which she stood and recognized those features. The very life-blood seemed freezing in her veins. It was a full minute after his sister had written his name upon her card and handed it to the servant, on being told that Mrs. Bartlett was not at home, before Mr. Dare turned to leave. So intent had he been on getting a glimpse of the performer, he had stood peering with curious eyes through the open door into the parlor. That look of inquiry, perchance, would have been exchanged for one of dismay and astonishment had he caught a glimpse of that wan face. "O! Lena," she gasped, as the servant returned to the room, , that was he! The one who caused all my misery and shame!" "You must be mistaken," returned the girl, in amazement; it could not be. That was Mr. Dare, the minister's son! See, here is the name! You can spell Roman letters, can't you?" "Yes/' said Rosalie, grasping the card. "'Twa he, though; I know, I'm sure of it." "We will tell them, then," said the girl, "just as soon as they come home." "O, no, no!" cried Rosalie "don't, Lena! promise me you never will!" "Why?" asked the servant, in surprise.

Yes, Rosalie went back; the parting from her babe well-nigh shattered the little strength she had, gath- ered; compared with it, her other trials seemed  but light, and nothing save the certainty of her approach- ing dissolution urged her to make the sacrifice. She i was sure she could find  no warmer hearts in the Fatherland, than those who had taken her in and administered to her wants, and to them she chose to consign her offspring. The journey was tedious and wearying, and when her foot touched the-soil of her native land, her heart was even sadder than when she set sail from America. Her spirit shrank from the thought of meeting R eoderic, and yet her heart so yearned for sympathy-for just one single glance' of his eye, before the light faded from her own, she felt that she could not lie down to her last sleep without seeing him again. Yet, ere she reached her destination, she wrote him a letter, informing him, for the first time, of all that had befallen her; she had repeatedly attempted to do this before, but each time her courage had failed. She had, however, at last nerved herself for the effort, and written.  &#xD;<pb n="128-129" xml:id="VAC7466-00000065"/> 12S      EMMA BARTLETT: OR, the whole; telling him, at the close, th]t her only wish was to see him once more, and then lie down by her mother's grave, and die. Two days after the missive was placed in his hands, Rosalie-reached the spot that had witnessed their parting  it was here she had promised to meet him, and, as she sank down on the green-sward at her feet, and let her  eye wander to the blue waters of the Main, she could perceive but little change in the surrounding objects from the time she had sat there a twelve-month before. Yet, O! how fearfully changed was she! Could she but  blot out the remembrance of the last year, she might look forward with some hope of future happiness; but that was impossible, and the great grief at her heart, like a canker-worm, seemed eating away her life. As she sat gazing eagerly round, all the associations con- nected with their last interview rushed across her mind. Would he recognize her, faded, haggard, and changed as she was? While musing thus an approaching footstep fell upon her ear; a visible agitation shook her frame; and, as it drew nearer, she involuntarily pressehAer hands over her face, and bowed her head on her bosom. She had not seen the form, but her heart told her who it was. At that moment an inward conflict raged in her bosom; a struggle between love and shame.  She longed to feel the warm pressure of his lips to her own, yet, like a hideous dream, with frightful distinctness the   PREJUDICE AND FANATICISM.     1.Q9 past came before her, and her head was bowed lower as she thought. Roderic was little changed! The fleeting year had made no perceptible impress on his brow, nor dimmed in the least the flash of his dark eye. His thin, lithe figure had rounded perhaps a little, but his step was as light and buoyant as ever. Astonishment and incredulity were depicted on his countenance, as he for an instant gazed on the bent form of her who had once been his heart's idol. Could this. indeed be she, wasted to a skeleton, with sunken cheeks, that the attenuated fingers tried in vain to cover?"Yes, it is the same," he exclaimed mentally, "for the light golden ringlets have undergone no change." He might not have thought so, had he seen her an hour earlier, with her tresses combed carelessly back, and fastened in an unbecoming knot behind. Yet she remembered he had always admired her curls, and had taken the pains, on removing her comb, to twine them around her finger as of yore. Gathering'in his hand the flowing mass that partially concealed her features, Roderic bent over her, and softly breathed her name. No answer came. "Rosalie!) he repeated, gently removing her hands, "will you not allow me to welcome you back?" A stifled sob was the only reply. "Have you ceased to love me, Rosalie?" he asked in a reproachful-tone.   &#xD;<pb n="130-131" xml:id="VAC7466-00000066"/> 150      - 1f-MA BARTECT: BR, $- "O, Roderic! burst from her lips ; but her full eart choked the remaining words she would have uttered, Very tenderly he drew her head to his bosom, and as a mother soothes her infant, did he with words of love and sympathy cause the wild conflict to subside.

Would to God we had never been separated," he added earnestly, noticing the cloud that flitted over her face. ' May I see the card, of which you/wrote?" he asked.

"Never, unless I could find the counterpart of my Rosalie; a being as like her as are twin-cherries to each other; one in whom the resemblance would be perfect enough to deceive my eyes into the belief that it was Rosalie's self. Think you I will ever meet such an one?" he asked, with an incredulous smile. , It is not likely," she replied; but you must not pass through life alone and uncared for."

As a beautiful flowel, brought to perfection by the genial breath of Summer, withers when the chilling Autumn-winds lay their icy fingers upon its delicate petals, so this fragile human flower, almost perfect in its loveliness, passed to the land of shadows. In vain did the still devoted lover endeavor to biot'the past from her remembrance; as foot-marks of pollution leave. their impress on the pure snow they deface, and are only erased when the snow itself melts, so was it with Rosalie; the stain seemed stamped upon her memory, only to fade when death should dissolve her being. How inexpressibly dear the two became to each other, as life's sands were waning with her.

How like a worshiper before his shrine did he seem, as he knelt there with his head bowed as though in adoration over his idol, while from the altar of his heart arose the incense of love as an offering to heaven for the precious gift bestowed! How tenderly he lifted the tiny form and pressed it to his bosom 1 How often he laid its soft cheek to his in silent rapture.

He 12  &#xD;<pb n="138-139" xml:id="VAC7466-00000070"/> 38       EMMA BARTLeETTS OB - had learned, before he started, the probable location of a contemplated railroad, and had purchased, at a reduced price, much of the land of the owners, who had not been informed of the anticipated project; In less than a year, he had received .four-fold for his invest, ment, and with this capital began business for himself in his native city. , Shrewd, active, and ever ready to take the advan.  tage, he made a very successful merchant, and at the time of which we write, was doing business on a scale! sufficiently large to justify his em'ployin 'a half dozen  clerks.  On the evening in question, Dare was accompanied by one of his clerks; a young gentleman by the name of Murphy. His name was all that indicated his Irish descent, for neither his language nor appearance would have led one to believe him to be a descendant of a son of Erin. On the whole, his features were almost too effeminate to be called handsome, yet when his soft hazel eyes kindled with a meteoric' flash, as a finer passage of music than usual fell upon his ear, the light that overspread his countenance made it appear beau- tiful. His dark chestnut hair, which seemed inclined to curl, was thrown carelessly back from the forehead of almost marble whiteness, all except a little stray lock, that despite his efforts, would coil itself in a spiral form and nestle on his brow. He was apparently not more than twenty-one, and had been employed  y lir.   PREJUDICE AND FANATICISM.      139 Dare a year before; his steady conduct and strict atten- tion to business, had so far won the confidence of his employer, he had often been entrusted with the most important business transactions. To encourage him to persevere, had been Dare's motive in showing him some attention, and, on the evening we introduce him to our readers, his employer had, at the minister's request, invited him  to accompany him.  He had observed that the young man exhibited a decided par- tiality for music, and determined that for once he shoutl be gratified. His employer was greatly surprised to mark the effect the music had upon him; from the moment the -young girl took her seat and ran her fingers over the keys, his eyes seemed riveted upon her, and more than once he passed his hand across his forehead in a sin- gular manner. Did the strains affect him painfully because the inexperienced performer did not give to the notes precisely the proper accent, or touch the ivory with the ease and grace of a master?  Had he been accustomed to listen to melodies so nearly perfedc, that the least discord grated harshy on his ear? Thus soliloquized Mr. Adam Dare, as he stood watch- ing narrowly the various changes of his young friend's features, for though he had been acquainted with him a twelve-month, he knew nothing of his previous his- tory ; whether a sudden reverse of fortune or inherited poverty forced him to seek a situation as a clerk.  &#xD;<pb n="140-141" xml:id="VAC7466-00000071"/> "O      RMMA BARTLETT: OR, Within the last month, Mr. Murphy had been pro- moted to the station of book-keeper, for two reasons: First, his employer discovered that he possessed an extraordinary degree of conscientiousness, which pre- vented him from extolling an article he knew to be inferior. Secondly, he was more careful in calculation than Mr. Porter, the former- book-keeper. The latter was a tall, pompous looking fellow, boasting considerable self-esteem, and a large portion of prejudice against certain nations. He prided himself on being a native born American, and was sure to devise some means to show thbse around him, how greatly superior he felt himself to any , importations" that crossed his path. There was much in his character that Mr. Murphy did not admire; he therefore kept him at a respectful distance. Porter, on the contrary, seemed to court his friendship more than the rest of his companions, and though all his advances toward intimacy had been repulsed in a decided yet courteous manner, still he did not seem to despair. Murphy had expected to have some trouble with him when an exchange of places was proposed; but, to his surprise, he seemed perfectly willing to resign. Perhaps it was his employer's well-timed remark, that palliated the disappointment that otherwise might have found utterance. "I shall expect you to keep an eye- on the other clerks," said Dare, when he mentioned the subject, well   PREJUDICE AND FANATICISM.     141 knowing his propensity to rule whenever he was per- mitted.    But we left young Murphy gazing intently on Emma Bartlett, and his employer speculating about his sin- gular manner.  Finally, a new thought seemed to strike Dare, and he began to questid n himself as to whether he -had done exactly right in bringing him along. He himself had been dazzled by the surpass- ing beauty of the young girl, and as the thought flashed across -him, that admiration of the musician instead of the music had so entranced his young friend, he secretly upbraided himself for the step he had talr: ;. True, he was nothing but a poor clerk, could boast nod wealthy connections, (for he had told Dare he was an orphan), but then that gentleman had been witness to many singular feats of the blind-god, and might he not in this instance try the dexterity of his bow and quiver? There was at least a possibility of it, and would it be anything more than natural for a young romanticgirl' of Miss Bartlett's age, to give the preference to a hand- some gentleman of twenty-one instead of a rich mer- chant of forty? Our hero was fast merging   toward the shades of bachelorhood; until within a year, business and "( phi- lanthropic projects for the amelioration of the condition of his colored brethren " had so occupied his thoughts as to leave  them  no time to revert to matrimony.

Since boyhood, until he -took kis trip " out west " (which event occurred fifteen yeasbefore, and to which he referred when he told Rosalie business would call him away from .the city a few weeks), he had been a constant visitor at the minister's ;- after his return, however, the perplexities of his avocation had so absorbed his attention as to leave him but few leisure moments; for this reason, his visits at Mr. Bartlett's had-- been rare; and thus years passed without his knowing of the existence of such a being as Emma Bartlett.

Impelled by curiosity, he renewed his acquaintance, and was welcomed- as an old friend b both parents. When first introduced-to the daughter, he started with surprise; his usual self-possession left him, and as the young girl advanced to meet him, he returned her greeting with an awkwardness of manner that his friends had never before seen him exhibit. Recovering from his embarrassment, he made a hasty apology, by assuring the minister and his wife" that he was e:ntirely ignorant of this addition to their family circle; it was somewhat of an equivocation, but, being   PRlEJUDICE ANU F NATICISM.    14-  so Suddenly thrown off his guard, it wtas necessary to offer some explanation, and he did not scruple to make use of the first that presented itself. It was no wonder he turned pale, when she burst upon his sight; the striking resemblance that Emma bore to her lhe had-betrayed, was enough to curdle the blood in his veins. Truly hadl Rosahe said to Lena, "My picture is all the legacy I' have to leave my child." Yet, when these words were uttered, little did she dreiam'her offspring would possess form and features so similar that those who gazed upon her, and then, after a lapse of time, upon ler child, could scarcely believe they were different beings.

The same golden ringlets seemed to fall over a brow as spotlessly white as the one his perfidy had clouded with grief. The same slight, graceful form that had stood by his side when the trembling "Yes" was pronounced, seemed again to draw riear. Was it marvelous, then, that his presence of mind forsook. him-? That he was, for an instant, entirely thrown off his guard? Or that re- peatedly, during that first' interview, he found himself wondering that two utter strangers, natives of different. countries, should be so strangely similar? Before theq had met, when the report of her wondrous beauty had reached his ear, he had inquired' about her origin; and been told that a friend of Mrs. Bartlett's had consigned  &#xD;<pb n="144-145" xml:id="VAC7466-00000073"/> -t 44       EMMA BAERRET: OR, the child to her keeping; with this information, he had not the slightest clue to suspect her German descent. The evening on which young Murphy accompanied him, was the third he had passed in her company. After playing the pieces her father desired, Emma arose from the piano and took a seat by his side; when the music ceased, the guests began conversing on vari- ous subjects. Mrs. Bartlett had drawn young Murphy into conversation, while Mr. Dare joined the minister and said, as he cast his eye on the daughter, "If sister Nelhe had been with us, I should not have been kept in ignorance of Miss Bartlett's existence so long as I was .  "Your sister married a gentleman from Illinois, I believe? "Yes! I visited her while passing through that State, some ten years since." "Has she been married so long?" asked- the minis- ter, in some surprise. "Yes, and longer too., Don't you reollect? It was just after my return from my first trip, over fourteen years ago." "True; how time flies! Nellie is changed, no doubt, from the light-hearted girl she used to be." "Yes, but her husband is a noble fellow, Mr. Bartlett! a true philanthropist.

But it was ordered for the best, I suppose: he moved to one of our glorious free States, where no such miserable distinction as master and slave exists." "Was it not rather strange, that he, with his peculiar views on that subject, should choose a slave State for his home?" asked the minister. "Not at all, my dear sjr! not at all! He felt that he had his mission to-fulfil, and he hoped, by strewing the good seed broadcast in their midst, to see the fruit spring up and yield a plenteous harvest. But you know, my friend, that the Good Book tells us, ' None so blind as those that will not see,' and so he found it; though only receiving a small remuneration for the great work he had undertaken, he was willing to labor for a mere pittance, that posterity might reap the benefit. And how was he rewarded for his generous self-sacrifice? For straining every nerve in the cause of liberty? Why, he was seized by the ungrateful, benighted rabble, and held in custody to await a trial for nego-stealing, as they term it; and it was by the merest accident, or I should rather say a singular interposition of Providence, that he made his escape. "But he has settled in the right place now, Mr. Bart- lett; I never saw more zealous workers in the cause of freedom! Their minister is a firm, decided man!

Mr. Bartlett, it would have refreshed you to have heard the good Par- son Bruce talk on this subject! He took such a firm stand. Why, once, on a sacraigntal occasion, while speaking of this curse, he raised lhi- hands, and thanked his God that no slaveholder had ever partaken of the blessed rite at his table, or stood within his sacred desk to utter the truths of the inspired volume." '"And did he think," asked the young Emma, that all slaveholders are excluded from the kingdom of' heaven?            ..'- --  Dare hesitated; helld not expected an interrogation from that quarter. ' "Why does my daughter ask?" asked Mr. Bart- lett. I did not know you took an interest in such subjects."

' "I had no thought of objecting;" she returned, color. ing; " nor the least desire to aspire to so important a position; I merely asked for information." Neither did Mr. Dare seem anxious to pursue the sub. ject further, but adroitly turned the conversation into another channel. "Now our friend, Mr. Dare, entertains some strange views with regard to slavery, father," said Emma, after the company had dispersed. "Yes, my dear," he replied; "he always was some- what fanatical on that point; when he introduces the subject I seldom object to what he says, as any argu- ment I might bring forward in favor of slavery, would only irritate him."  "And what do you think about it, father?" asked Emma, raising hereyes inquiringly to his face. "It would take more time than I can spare, to-night, to tell you, dear.

" "Wont -you tell me, father," she asked with a mis- chievous smile, "in what part of the Bible Mr. Dare found the quotation he made: 'None so blind as those who will not see'?" "You're just like your mother," he said, patting her cheek;" nothing escapes you. We are all liable to errors, you know, and my friend was so interested in his subject he mistook his authority." "What did you think of Mr. Dare's young friend, Emmna?" asked Mrs. Bartlett, entering the room. "I thought him rather handsome, did'nt you? "Yes, but with regard to his conversational powers. Should you judge he possessed any depth of character?" "If silence be indicative of profundity, I should say yes; for I did not hear him utter a single syllable," was the laughing rejoinder.

A MONTH prior to the events narrated in the preced- ing: chapter, a person of apparently five and thirty might have been seen to enter one of the Boston read- ing-rooms, and seating himself by a table, pick up one of the daily papers and glance over it. His finely-cut features were full of expression, yet on the high forehead a shadow seemed to linger. It was Roderic Sundahl; changed, greatly changed. Yet the eloquent features, where thought had set its seal, were scarcely less hand- some than they had been in the dawn of his manhood. Not only had time's fingers wrought a change there, but his whole nature seemed changed. It was at Rosa- lie's bedside his heart had been baptized with the holy- baptism of Christianity; there he first felt inspired with a new life, a strong, earnest desire to possess more of  &#xD;<pb n="150-151" xml:id="VAC7466-00000076"/> 4a0      BMMA - eETT :- 9OB,  that spirit of meekness and forgiveness that had char- acterized the gentle being he had adored. It was thi% that prevented him, when the stunning blow fell, from becicoing gloomy,nmorose and misanthropic. The quick flash of his dark eye plainly indicat that if not held in constant restraint, his temper might gain the mas- tery: for this reason he kept a strict watch over him- self, and each year that hurried on to the great ocean of-Eternity but strengthened the resolve he 'made by her dying bed to prepare to meet his spirit-bride, whom he confidently believed would be waiting at the emerald gates to receive him. To us there is no grander sight, nor one deserving hiigher commendation, than to see man, created as he is in the god-like image of his M1aker, and occupying the highest position in the universe, standing as it were impregnable to the shafts of the Evil One; repelling, with the sword 'of the spirit, all, attempts to rob -him of his peace, thus elevating himself above those petty weaknesses that mar the happiness. of those who have not girded on 'the Christian's armor, and securing that pure and perfect'peace the. world can neither give nor take away. -Thus had it been with Roderic. Leaning on the Rock of Ages, he had stemmed the current and comne 'off victorious. To his aged father he had devoted him- self during the fourteen years succeeding Rosalie's death, and,. then, when he saw the cold hands folded meekly   IREEJtDICE AND FANATICISM.     1 on his bosom, and the cherished formn resigned to its last resting-place, he had turned his face to the setting- sun, in order to redeem his promise to the dead -to search for the two his lost Rosahe had left behind her in America. As he glanced from column to column, his eye was caught by an advertisement headed, "A German clerk  wanted," and all applicants were requested to call at the store of Adam Dare, Jr., on --   street. Rodetic started as he read that name, and some of the fire' that lighted his eyes in other years, flashed from beneath the dark lashes. His lips were comnpressed tightly, as tloughl to crush back the exclamation that involun- tarilv arose. Drawing from  his pocket a case, he opened it and took threfrom a card on which were printed the words "Miss Nellie Dare," and underneath, in pencil marks, -was written the niame of Adam Dare, Jr. -"I had not expected to trace him  so soon,l' he at length mused aloud.

Suppose he were accepted, it would be a severe trial to be thrown daily into the presence of one, the thought of whom almost made his heart rebel against the promise he had breathed into the ear of the dying. While his bosomn was thus wrung by contend- ing emotions, he offered up a silent prayer for Divine assistance, and passed out into the street. Well had it been for Rozahe had she been able to speak our language as well as he. She might have done so, had she made it the stud of years, as her lover had done. Mr. Sundahl was not long in finding the merchant's place of business, or in making application. A single glance at Dare's face, convinced him that he was the man Rosahe had so minutely described. The merchant eyed him suspiciously for a moment; then, after asking him how long he had been in this country, what brought him over, and a variety of ques- tions foreign to the point, said he wouldn't mind taking him on trial; he couldn't give the usual salary, he said, until he had tested his capabilities. His foreign customers were increasing, and in his absence he found it would be requisite to have one in his place who under-' stood the language. If he was willing to accede to his terms, they would enter into an agreement without delay. The applicant assented.

Mr. Dare congratulated himself that he had "struck a good bargain."  His gentlemanly bearing and quick perceptions were not long in attracting his notice. "What a fine eye he has," thought Mr. Murphy, as he stood at his desk in the counting room, and returned the very polite bow of the stranger, to whom he had just been introduced. - "Porter will have his hands full, if he undertakes to' break him in.' Perhaps he will not attempt it, as he seems his equal in both age and experience." But Porter did make the attempt. In a Variety of ways he annoyed the stranger for the first few days. He began by attempting to make himself familiar, and although he found him as unapproachable as he had Mr. Murphy, he did not desist. Supposing it did annoy him, he said in answer to a remark made by i fellow clerk, "What was he but a Dutchman?" One morning, as the new clerk stood with his eyes fixed on the floor; apparently absorbed in deep thought, Porter approached him- and with a loud slap on the shoulder, said, "How  do you feel this morning, old fellow?" Fire flashed from the stranger's eye, as he turned his glance upon his companion; his lips parted as  &#xD;<pb n="154-155" xml:id="VAC7466-00000078"/> 84e      Wt tA -iBARLET: O1, though to reply, but instead, he threw upon him a wither- inglook, and then turning aside, resumed his meditations. Porter felt the"silent rebuke, but determined not to be thwarted; muttering something about the arrogance of foreigners, he walked behind the counter. On the afternoon of the same day, Porter overtook the newly-installed book-keeper on his way from dinner to the store. "What do you think of our new acquisition, Iur- phy?" he asked. "Do you refer to the new clerk? interrogated the other. "Yes, of course. He is very pompous and conse- quential, but I'm determined to see if hle' got any fight in him. I'm going to make him mad this very day; see if I dont." "What motive have you in view, Mr. Porter?-" "O, none in particular," he replied, carelessly. "It always does my soul good to torment these fresh impor- tations; and to tell the truth, Murphy, I always hated a Dutchman as I do a rattlesnake." "Why?" asked the other, in surprise. "O, because-well, really I never asked myself the qunstion," said the other, after thinking a moment. "I believe the hatred was b3rn with me, for'I can remember when I was a boy, i've followed Dutchmen a dozen squares merely for the gratification of throwing  d .

Mr. Porter enjoyed his laugh alone, while his com- panion quietly remarked, "I must say, sir, that I consider it a very silly weakness, and one you should by all means endeavor to overcome." "By no means! not in these times!" returned the other in a significant tone. "I'm down on foreigners more than ever, now. D'ye understand? eh?" Mr, Murphy did not. "What! Mr. Dare has not taken you through, then? Well, I guess he will before long, so it will be no harm to forestall him a little. I have understood that you are an American, Mr. Murphy; inherit nothing from foreign nations except your name. You have every reason to be proud of your country, and no doubt are. But," he said, pausing abruptly, " perhaps I am betrays ing confidence, by broaching this subject. It would probably be better to wait and let Mr. Dare enlighten you. I might not have been posted so soon had it not been for him, but you see his father is a minister, and preaches-there, I won't say any more; you'll be apt to know all in the course of a few months."

If so, I must say, I do not at all admire the principle that actuates either of you." ' This was spoken in a calm, gentlemanly way, and Porter replied dryly, "Self-interest was all that prompted him to employ a foreigner,. but the time will come when even that will cease to be an inducement, for Mr. Dare is a true patriot, and would not even allow self-aggrandizement to stand in the way of his  country's welfare. You will have occasion to remember my words hereafter," he said, in a tone of importance.  The remainder of the way was traversed in silence; Mr. Murphy revolving in his mind what he had heard, and Mr. Porter evidently vexed with himself for hav- ing said what he did, especially as lie found it met with such a cool reception. He had hoped his confiden- tial manner would break down the barrier of reserve existing between himself and the young book-keeper, but had, as usual, met with a signal failure. On entering the store they found it devoid of custom- ers; only their fellow clerks were in attendance. The German sat beside the stove, reading a paper; the rest were behind the counter.

A loud laugh rang from behind the counter as Porter gathered himself up and prepared to fight. The scene brought forcibly to one's mind the picture of David and Goliah; the tall six-footer, straitening up to his full hight, and the man of slender proportions standing fearlessly before him. "I 'll allow no man to strike me,"' said the German, as the former doubled up his fists for combat; then, imitating his example, he began with inconceivable rapidity, to pass his clenched digits, with a circular movement, directly under the pompous Goliah's nose, following him closely as he receded. In vain did the baffled giant seek an opportunity to display the power of his stalwart arm; the unabated swiftness of those dexterously-turned hands, in frightful proximity to his olfactory nerves, made him beat a retreat without being able to charge upon his opponent. "Holler enough, Porter!" cried one of the clerks, convulsed with laughter. "I ill pay the d--d Dutchman," he began, making a desperate. effort to pause in his retrograde motion, "' 11 ---" At that moment the door opened, and some ladies entered..

It was not strange that the two clerks, Murphy and 'Porter had never Lecome intimate friends, for it was as impossible for natures as entirely different as were theirs to assimilate, as it is for oil and water to unite. Neither was it strange that Roderic Sundahl's and the young book-keeper's acquaintance soon ripened into intimacy. They were alike in many respects. Mr. Murphy soon learned his friend possessed a fine appre- ciation of the beautiful both in nature and art, was exceedingly fond of music, and an ardent admirer of painting. Although more than a half a score of years his senior, he preferred his company to those nearer his own age, and at his request they occupied the same room, in order to have the more uninterrupted intercourse.  On the evening Mr. Murphy *as invited to accom- pany his employer to the minister'PA house, he longed to be permitted to ask his German friend to join them. But delicacy forbade, for Dare himself would have mentioned it had it been his desire.

Roderic had waited patiently for an opportunity to behold the adopted member of the minister's family, ,but as yet none had offered. And now his young friend was going to gaze upon what he had so long desired to see. Had he not feared they would have doubted his story, or at least have imagined he had come to rob them of their child, he would at once hlave made him- self known, but even when he asked himself in what way lie could benefit her, now that he had crossed the sea for that putipose, the question remained unanswered. She had been and wasitill cherished with the tenderest care by her devoted guardians, and what more was needed? Roderic sighed as he mused thus; since his father's death he had experienced that feeling that makes the heart yearning for love and sympathy, turn sick with despondency-- the feeling of utter loneliness--the want of something to love and care for. Had he found Rosalie's offspring destitute, in want of a protector, how gladly would he have taken her back to the Father- land, and devoted his remaining years to rearing and v instructing the little one she had left behind. Little one! yes, he thought of the child in no other light; he forgot years had flown by, transforming the infant to a beautiful being, just entering the first stages of womanhood.

There was a dreamy softness in those full hazel eyes; a something familiar the gazer seemed for the first time to discover. The thoughtful expression that settled about the mouth s seemed to share a portion of his scrutiny.

We are an excitable people; easily carried to extremes, and I can readily imagine how those of my countrynren, who are inclined to be fanatical, would be so zealous in the cause they have espoused as to look upon all foreigners as belonging to one of the two sects, and consequently turn their faces against all who are not American born. "It would not be fair to treat them thus, Karl; for we all know that Catholicism has its bitterest enemies in the old countries, where its cruelties have been the most severely felt; and it is for this very reason that many seek Columbia's shores ; 'twas this that made your father so desire to leave his native land; and for expressing his views with regard to religious proscription he was impris- oned.

And again, Karl, this using secret arms against an order that we believe to be guided by the Prince of Darkness, seems like fighting the Evil One with his own weapons. Would it not be wiser to use: the 'two-edged sword,' and step boldly out to combat?  To preach Christ add him cruci- fied, and thus with,the Word of -God put the armies of the enemy to flight?

"You took her name, Karl." "Yes. I did not know, until to-night, but that it was my own, although, as I said before, I had a faint idea of some previous life, as it were.

He was standing enraptured  ) Again by the side Of the one he had worshipped-- His long-promised bride. IT was a beautiful Sabbath morning in December. The golden sunbeams, as they fell upon the light frost- work that covered surrounding objects, glittered with a wild splendor that dazzled the eyes. Great multitudes of diamonds hung suspended from the branches of the trtes, and shrubs that decorated the mall. Scores of bells chimed the hour of worship, while -hundreds of - willing feet answered their cal!. Among the rest were our two friends, both wending their way, for the same :purpose, to the sanctuary entrusted to Mr.: Bartlett's care.         * The elder seemed occupied with his own thoughts, as he followed his companion up the broad aisle and then into the pew that was opened to receive him. : "Would she, whom  he desired to behold, indeed   PREJUDICE AND FANATICISM.     17 resemble his lost Ros alie?-' Could it be possible that the similarity would seem to him as striking -as it had to the brother?" As he thus mused, the object of his thoughts sat in a side pew with her foster mother; her eyes were- fixed full upon the pulpit, as, though eager to catch the first, glimpse of the minister as he arose, for seldom is more fervent love, or rather reverence, bestowed upon a parent,  than the gentle,*loving Emma felt flowing con- tinually from her heart toward him who occupied that sacred desk. Only one other flame burned with an intenser light in her bosom; and that was the deeper and more confiding love she bore her mothex. Truly had Mrs. Bartlett received four-foldfor the good seed she had endeavored to sow in life's early spring on the fallow soil of that young heart. Truly had she felt the fulfillment of the words uttered by the aged one when the little stranger lay upon her knee, "( Keep the babe; it may prove a blessing to you both yet." The petit bonnet of velvet and lace, so unbecoming to many faces, was peculiarly adapted to her style of beauty; and revealing, as it did, the greater portion of her face, Mr. Sundahl might have been enabled to get a side view had it not been for the head directly in front of him, which boasted no ordinary proportions, and seemed to change places with every movement of Miss Bartlett.

Emma's face was turned at that instant toward the congregation, and, as his eye, for the first time rested on those features, so faultless in symmetry, so-wondrous in beauty, he' mentally. ejaculated, "It is she! It is Rosalie's self!" Then, involuntarily grasp- ing his companion's arm, he kept his gaze fixed full upon her face, while his whole frame shivered from emotion. A death-like paor had overspread his fea- tures, while his lips were of an ashy whiteness. "Karl," he whispered, tightening his- grasp upon his young friend's arm, "I must go; come with me, and help me home."   The two arose, and an observant eye might have noticed that the step of the elder was unsteady, and .his lips tightly compressed, as though forcing back a something his heart would have poured into words. Their sudden movement interrupted for a; moment the unbroken stillness that had reigned throughout the church; and as Emma's eye followed the retreating forms, little did the unconscious girl think that she had been the cause of the agitation that so unnerved the elder. Roderic leaned heavily on the proffered arm of his I companion as they reached the door, and together they hurried to their lodgings.  -"I did not think any thing could so affect me, Karl," he said,. wiping the perspiration from his brow, "but   PREJUDICE AND FANATICISM.     175 had Rosalif risen from her grave and stood before me, I could not nave been more overpowered.

I remembered then how, as we sat together one lovely evening, she said, ' You must try to forget me, Roderic; in coming years another will fill my place.' And Karl," he continued, while his eye beamed with unwonted brightness, "I remember my answer as thoughll it were yesterday. 'Never,' I replied, ' unless I should find the counterpart of my Rosalie; a being as like her as are twin cherries to each other! One in whom the resemblance would be striking enough to deceive my eyes into the belief that it was Rosalie's self.' With fearful distinctness did those words ring in my ears when that vision burst upon my view.  I felt them to be a prophesy, even then fulfilled before me. O! Karl," he continued, wringing the young man's hand as he spoke, "'you loved her only as a brother, and for but a short period; but to me she was infinitely more, and I feel that this young creature, her own dear self in seeming, would have the same power to fascinate, were I permitted to approach her.

It was no longer a smiling blue-eyed infant that his heart yearned to enfold, but a bright, glorious creature, a second Rosalie, for which it kept yearning with as t'intense a desire as had stirred its depths in other years. As the limpid' waters of the bubbling stream that flows tranquilly on through the forest whose foliage the sunlight may not penetrate, dreaming ever of the golden beams that warmed its bosom ere it entered the wilderness of shadows, will, when the 'gorgeous sun again bursts upon its sighti, sparkle with renewed brightness and leap up for very gladness, so was it with the waves of feeling in Ro-deric's bosom. The flame that for long years had been smouldering, the deep abiding love he had imagined had settled down into a sweet sad memory of the departed, came burst- ing up in a mighty torrent that neither his habitual self-control, the voice of reason, nor iron resolution could hold in restraint. He thought not of Emma Bartlett as another being, the child he had come to- watch over, but as Rosalie's second self. He no longer felt the desire that she should look to him as to a parent or guardian, but that she should become something dearer--a portion of himself-his own.  And then,   PREJUDICE AND FANATICISM.     1" too, he resolved that she should never know what had brought him to America, until he had endeavored to woo her for his bride. There were many obstacles in his way; of that he was well aware; he was a foreigner, and if her adopted parents -partook of the prejudice existing in the minds of many against his countrymen, that in itself might prove an insuperable barrier to even an intimate acquaintance. Beside, what reason had he to hope the young lady her- self would be pleased with him. The quiet, hidden grief he had carried in his bosom; had, he knew, left its traces on his brow, and years of anxiety had robbed his step of its lightness. Involuntarily he arose and glanced in the mirror, and for the-first time seemed fully to realize the change time had effected. "All is changed," he murmured, " except my heart: that throbs just the same. Karl," he said aloud, turning suddenly to the young man, who sat revolving in his mind all that he had lately learned with regard to his early history, and thinking how passing strange it was, that one habitually so calm and collected, should so sud- denly have lost all power of control-"Karl," he repeated, laying a  hand on his shoulder, " you have the advan- tage of me; you -have youth and beauty on your side, just as I had when I won the fair enchantress of my boyish dreams."

I know my position too well; for what am I, but a poor clerk?"-he asked, with a slight bitterness of tone. "You are not poor!" was the expression that arose to Roderic's lips; but he crushed it back; for the time had not come to tell him that all the possessions that had been confiscated by the government, during the reign of the tyrant Karl Ludwich, had been restored to their rightful, owners, or their descendants, by the just -and lenient sovereign then on the throne; and that he had nothing to do, but to cross the Ocean, prove his identity, and assert his claim, in order to have the beautiful home of his ancestors pass into his possession. Roderic had forborne to mention this at first, because of his great desire to accompany his friend back; and with his mission but half fulfilled, he would not be ready to return immediately. Karl's first impulse, he thought, on learning the, good fortune that awaited him, would be to go without delay and assert his claim; and, until he had seen " the child," he would not be ready to bear him company. And now he had seen her whom he had so desired to   PREJITDICE AIM FANATICISM.     179 gaze upon; yet still another motive kept him pilent- on the subject. Selfish, it might have been, but we will not censure him; true love is sometimes exacting. His only hope of becoming acquainted with the stranger maiden, was through Karl, and this was why he refrained from imparting to him, that which would send him from his presence. "Have I wounded your feelings, my friend? ' asked Karl, fearing that his companion had applied his last remark with regard to position and wealth to himself.- "I did not intend what I said to be personal, I assure you," he added, misconstruing Roderic's silence.. The latter smiled. "I did not take it so; not at all. As to position we both stood as high in our native land as she does here; and as far as wealth is concerned, my mother's fortune passed into my hands years ago, and that, believe me, was a goodly inheritance." "Then why," asked the other, in a tone of surprise, "have you sought for employment, here in America?^' Roderic bit his lip. He was not prepared for this interrogation. "I have always felt better when engaged in some business that would divert my thoughts from the past," he said; then blushing at what sounded to himself like equivocation,' he added, "I had another motive in view, Karl, which I will explain to you at some future time."    &#xD;<pb n="180-181" xml:id="VAC7466-00000091"/> %180     ' aMMA mBAMA: OR, Fully aware -that his own recommendation would have little- weight with his new acquaintances, lir.

Accordingly, as they sat. one evening in the counting-room, the book-keeper dex- terously turned the conversation upon the subject of music, a theme of which he knew the merchant was fond. In the course of his remarks he made several allusions to his friend's proficiency and excellent taste in that science. Mr. Dare was not aware of the fact, he said, though - he might have known he possessed some knowledge of it, as he seldom met educated Germans who did not. Mr. Murphy here took occasion to'say that for many years his friend had devoted a greater portion of his time to perfecting himself in his favorite pursuit, and it was his opinion, from what opportunity he had of judging, that his efforts had been crowned with success. Mr. Dare was delighted to hear this. It set him to, thinking; and after a short silence, he wondered if he could not be prevailed upon to impart instruction, if informed that he would confer a great favor by so doing. Mr. Murphy did not know that his friend would care to change his occupation, but would mention the sub- ject to him he said.   PREJTDICE AND BFANATICISM.    181 He was, however, informed that his- employer would not, for any consideration, lose Mr. Sundahl's services. He was only thinking he would confer a great obliga- tion on a particular friend, could he prevail on him to give his daughter farther instruction in music, "You have had an opportunity to judge of her acquirements in that branch of science," he said, "I refer to Miss Bartlett."'  Mr. Murphy bowed, and said he would mention the subject to his friend, inwardly delighted that fortune had so unexpectedly favored him. "'My friend may have one objection to offer," said his employer, after a slight pause, " that is, that he is a foreigner. You are aware," he added, after several protracted alhems, " that in these times -Native Ameri- cans are to be preferred in all cases." Mr. Murphy did not see why it-should be so. Dare expressed surprise. "Why, sir, you are behind the times; decidedly so!" he repeated, with emphasis, "Have you heard nothing of the great. political move- ment now going on? the last resort that freedmen have been obliged to fly to, in order to free their beloved country from the presumptuous grasp of foreign power?" Mr. Murphy had merely heard something of the kind intimated. "Well, sir," continued his informant, " you will hear sooner or later.

"To teach all usurpers the force and beauty of that glorious motto, ' Americans shall rule America,' to keep these foreign aspirants in subjection; to wrest our republic from the threatening danger that surrounds it. It has a direct tendency to check the spurious reli- gion that has increased to so alarming an extent within the last few years, to combat with and overthrow Cath- olicism, and thus, by stemming the current on one side, to increase the true religion of the Bible." "It strikes me, Mr. Dare, that if this is their design, they had better not use force-work to execute their plans. Zealots in former ages tried the experiment, but met with little success.

"If I am to understand from that, that you wish to know whether I favor Catholicism, I answer, No, sir! I was brought up in the Presbyterian faith, bus thanks to the one who reared me, I am free from the prejudices trammeling many of my brethren. I do believe with you, that danger is to be apprehended. from the rapid increase of Catholicism in our midst, but can not think   PREJUDICE AND FANATICISM.      183 that such opposition as you refer to, will check it in the least; Instead of such measures let the Protestant por- tion'of community be as vigilant in the cause of religion as are their Catholic brethren. Let them redouble their efforts to instil into the minds of their offspring the truths of the Divine volume. Let as great exertions be made by them to build up institutions of learning, aX are used by their Catholic friends to establish nunneries and convents. Let the same gentle means be used to win the hearts of those committed to their charge: the same uniform kindness and untiring devotion. This, sir, I believe to be the great secret of- their success. How many instances can you recall, where a child, placed at a convent at an early age,.and allowed to remain there until the age of maturity, will leave the institution frni choice?  And whence comnes this mysterious influence? Surely it is no supernatural power, confined to the walls of the convent. No, it is the stronger influence of love; the unequalled strength of the golden band of affection, that mlakes them linger at the threshold, loth to pro- nounce the parting word. I will not take it upon myself to say, whether these sisters are sincere in their conduct, or not, but will leave that to Him who seeth not as man man seeth But allowing that they are only actuated by sinister motives, and put on the garb of sanctity to hide them, we will at least do them  the justice to say, that they manifest both wisdom and forethought in their actions.

With such assistants they have little fear of failure, for are they not thus laying the foundation of future success? Are they not educa- ting the wives and mothers of the future generation, who in their turn will exert an infinitely greater influence upon the male portion of community, than if the latter were themselves brought under the Papists' control? Is it anything but natural that these same mothers, impressed as they were with the influences brought to bear on their minds, should in their turn hold up to their children, as patterns of excellence, those who watched over them in- youth." Mr. Dare made no reply, and his young friend con- tinued: "Now, instead of patronizing a system we fear will gain the ascendancy, would it not be better to estab: lish schools of a high moral and religious 4one, through- out the length and breadth of our land, appointing those to superintend them whose sincere piety and practical lives will lure those committed to their charge to follow their example'?

As was usual on such occasions, the audience became weary before the speaker had reached the middle of his discourse; but, with commendable perseverance, that individual labored untiringly, hoping ^by frequent repe- tition to impress the assertions on his single auditory's- mind, that lacked both the force of argument and the power of conviction to make them effective. Mr. Murphy's penetration enabled him to see at once, what Mr. Bartlett had learned by experience, viz: that to enter into a discussion would only- irritate Dare, who seemed to have ithO 'hde -plan of redemptioin (as :he 16  &#xD;<pb n="186-187" xml:id="VAC7466-00000094"/> 188      .

"Am I to understand it is your desire that I mention  the subject to mny friend Sundahl?" he asked, as his employer arose-to leave. "To Mr. Sundahl!" exclaimed the other in surprise. "By no means! Why should you?  He is a foreigner, and they -? "' Pardon me for interrupting you, Mr. Dare, but you did not understand me.

It was very evident that the philanthropist did not relish the latter remark, for with a formal bow he abruptly took his departure. t  &#xD;<pb n="188-189" xml:id="VAC7466-00000095"/> 188       BMMA BARTLETT: OR, WHAT was it that moved his being With a wild, magnetic thrill, Causing even his heart's tumultiios Throbbing to grow strangely still?

"Perhaps," said Mr. Sundahl, and a dark cloud passed over his face as he spoke, perhaps lie is interested in the young girl, herself."

However," he added, in a -lighter tone, I wont get disheartened before I make the attempt." It was a clear, cold morning in January. Emma Bartlett sat before the piano, moving her taper fingers listlessly over the ivory, when her father entered, accompanied by the two gentlemen, Dare and Sundahl. "My daughter, Mr. Sundahl," he said, presenting her; then added, "This is the gentleman who is to give you further instruction in music, my dear."  Miss Bartlett bowed slightly, and then turning to  &#xD;<pb n="190-191" xml:id="VAC7466-00000096"/> 190      EMMA BARTLETI: OR, Mr. Dare, made some playful remark, referring to a previous conversation. Although after the conversation in which Miss Bart- lett expressed a difference of opinion on the subject of slavery, Mr. Dare had scrupulously avoided reverting, to any thing he thought calculated to meet with her disapprobations his efforts seemed entirely unapprecia- ted by his fair friend. The spirit of opposition she had first manifested was not at all diminished on fur- ther acquaintance. As time passed on he became accustomed to this, and so, by mutual consent, the con- versation was always opened wFith some sportive remark, referring to a previous dispute. Mr. Dare had several times endeavored to compliment Miss Bartlett on her personal appearance, and that entitled her to express herself unreservedly with regard to his features. His nose, particularly, seemed the object of her uinbounded' admiration. Now, this. was rather unfortunate, as it was the only feature with which our self-complacent hero was not wholly satisfied. It had, he informed her, too much the appearance of a long slender exclamation point, turned up suddenly at the end. Emma affirmed that she could always tell a person's most prominent traits of character by the end of his nose, and the extreme sharpness of the extremity of his olfactory, she informed him, indicated a great deal of sarcasm, combined with an extraordinary degree of shrewdness.   PREJUDICE AND FANATICISM.     19j ;"MissaBartlett is very. industrious," he remarked, in reply to her first sally. "I admire to see such habits in a young lady." ' I can not imagine to what you refer," she replied. "Why, do I not find you here, poring over your music at this early hour?" "Mr. Dare is inclined to be complimentary, this morning," she replied, bowing. "Miss Bartlett will return it by congratulating her friend on the remark- ably fine appearance of that point of his features she so admires. It seems to be enjoying a good state of health." Mr. Dare was happy to assure her of the fact. He was glad, too, that she continued to admire that very important feature. Were it not absolutely indispensa- ble, he would have it amputated aind present it to her. The young lady regretted exceedingly that such a thing was impossible. Could he be prevailed upon to gratify her, she would lose no time in planting it, with the hope that it would yield a plentiful harvest. While the two carried on their railery, the minister and Mr. Sundahl sat apart, engaged in conversation. At her father's request, Emma turned to the piano, and performed several pieces, in order that her new eacher might judge of her progress. She was sue- eeded by Mr. Sundahl, who swept over the keys with l master hand.

How his heart throlb bed as he approached the instrument where the young girl sat.! How like the beautiful, vanished past did the present seem then! Could it be a reality? Were not all the intervening years but a dream, and was he not standing, as of old, beside his betrothed, his Rosa- lie? Were not those the same tresses rippling over the snowy brow? Unconsciously he moved his hand toward his bosom, as though to draw from its resting place the sacred tress that had slumbered there for yeams. "What is to be my first lesson?" asked Emma; and as she turned over the leaves of her music book, she looked up inquiringly at her teacher. Surely those soft cerulean orbs, whose glance thrilled every fibre of his frame, could be none other than those that had so often and confidingly been upturned to his own! and even the fairy iAngers, that fluttered through the music leaves, seemed the very counterparts of those, which, like frightened doves, had lain tremb- ling in his hand when, for the first time, his softly breathed. wowswfellp onp Rosalie's;war,. 3i.- a '   PREJUDICE AND FANATICISM.     1 '" Give me a song. first, please!" said Emma, won- dering at his protradted silence.

"Well!" replied the teacher, roused by her voice from his revery, what shall it be? " "O ! I don't know," she returned; " anything that's new. I'd like to learn something I never heard before. Something you used to sing in Germany; a song every- body don't know.    Father says I am   full of oddities, and I presume you will indorse his opinion. Allow me to resign~ my seat to you that you may recall some old familiar tune. What is old to you will be new to me, remember." Mr. Sundahl took fie proffered seat, and, after run- ning through a short prelude, began Rosalie's favorite: fremd bin ich hier tnd ach! nur zu Dir " etc. The earnest pathos of his voice, added to the sad, sweet mournfulness of the tune, gave' it a-peculiarly touching effect.  Emma    thought she had never heard anything so full of tenderness as was that rich, clear, and at times tremulous voice; and though- the words were perfectly unintelligible, she  exclaimed, as he ended,   "0!  I  thank 'you! it is so sweet t  the air, I mean. But I        could never learn those words," she added, with a smile. 17&#xD;<pb n="194-195" xml:id="VAC7466-00000098"/> 194      EMMA BARTLETT: OR, "I will translate it and arrange the music for you," he said. "In the meantime you can practice some of these time exercises; there is little fear of your being too thoroughly drilled on them, you know." Enmma willingly assented, and after an hour spent in instruction, the teacher took his departure. A month afterward, Miss Bartlett sat in the parlor alone. Her teacher had just left; they had been prac- tising a duett together, and in one passage, where their arms crossed, his hand had accidentally touched her own. A sudden tremor passed through her frame at the touch; an indescribable feeling she had never before experienced; all power of execution seemed to have fled, and after making several errors, she ceased playing, and without raising her eyes said: Indeed, Mr. Sundahl, I can not play this morning! Please excuse me." No reply came and she added, fearing by his silence that he was displeased, "I hope you will not be vexed with me; I made a great effort to keep the time." As she spoke, she raised her eyes and encountered his gaze fixed full upon her; there was a strange fasci- nation in the earnest glance of those large, eloquent orbs, * depth of feeling in his tone, as he replied, "Vexed; O! no! We will lay the duett aside and take the song. You can sing that for me this morning, can you not?    PRJUDIC:E AND FANATICISM.       95 The pupil signified her willingness to make the attempt. Tremulous as the aspen leaf that quivers at the slightest breath was the voice that arose, and a whole stanza was sung ere the tone became more con- fident. Perhaps the teacher's reason for giving his pupil the following words was, because he felt them to be applicable to himself: Strange I am here And thou still so near, Thou beautiful Evening Star My eye loves to turn To thee while I yearn For the country afar. Still from on high Beams thy friendly eye, And when in this stranger land  Gives me no friend the hand, Then would I rise To thee in the skies," etc The teacher did not join as was hi? wont. He stood there, gazing intently on the fair creature he so longed to clasp to his bosom, to call his own. There she sat, the 4very image of her who had received his heart's first homage; giving utterance to the same words that had so often burst from the lips of his own Rosalie. As the listener stood spell-bound, he felt a wild yearn- ing within him, a strong desire to tell the lovely being before him some portions of his past life.

And finally of the all-absorbing desire, since the first mo- ment he had gazed upon her, of taking her to himself, not as the child he hacdimagined, but even asV e would have taken his heart's first idol, to be his companion, his stay, his comforter. These thoughts passed rapidly through his mind, but, with the self-control he habit- ually practiced, he restrained the desire and remained silent. In the back parlor, which; during the winter season, was generally used as a sitting-room, Mrs. Bartlett was busily edngged assisting Lena in cleaning out the thina-closet, a piece of work which even the careful Lena had never been trusted to perform alonej for more than one piece of old-fashioned china-ware, handed down to the son and daughter by departed loved ones, were there sacredly preserved, and valued beyond all price from the hallowed associations lingering round them.

But Lena neither heard nor obeyed the summons. "( What is it, Lena? What do you hear?" asked the lady of the house, changing her attitude, and regard- ing the girl with a look of inquiry. Still no reply came, for as the voice increased in strength and -firmness, the servant became more ab- sorbed, and not until the last strain died away, did she arouse from her revery. Then, turning to Mrs. Bartlett, she asked, as the pearly drops chased each other down her cheeks, "Do   you remember Rosalie?" "'Yes," replied the lady, somewhat startleV by the question, it being the first time she had heard Lena mention that name for many long years. "Well," continued the girl, wiping her byes with her sleeve, " that is the very song she sang one day when you were out. I persuaded her to come to the parlor and look out of the front window, and when she saw the piano, she sat down and sang that. I thought then I would never forget it.

Unconscious maiden! she did not know that the depths within, the waves of feeling that had hitherto moved quietly on, had at length been stirred; that the great chord of her heart had been suddenly touched, and had given forth a responsive tone!

Mr. Bartlett sat in his pleas- ant study preparing his sermon for the ensuing Sabbath, when word was brought him that the Rev. Josiah Dare wished to have a conversation of a strictly private nature with him. "You will have to take French leave, Emma, he said, addressing his wife, who was removing the dust from the books and papers on 'his table. Then-? turning to Lena, he said, "Ask him up." "I wish he had postponed his visit an hour later! I was just waiting for a leisure moment to say a few words myself. However, it can be deferred.

It-was with regard to Emma and his son I wished to speak. If the old gentleman mentions it, please say we will let our daughter decide for herself in this matter: won't you George? The child seemed dis- tressed, when she told me, this morning, of his proposal, for fear that we would not only sanction it, but urge her to accept. She likes him well enough, but I'm sure she has never thought seriously of marriage, in her life." This was said very hurriedly, for the wife heard the measured tread of their friend approaching, and with a hasty, "It will be time enough half-a-dozen years hence to think of parting with our treasure," she closed the door leading to their chamber. Mrs. Bartlett had been somewhat surprised on learn- ing, an hour previous, that the evening before, Mr. Adam Dare had offered her daughter his hand, heart and for- tune. True, she had observed his deepening interest in Emma, and had more than once said, laughingly, to her husband, that at some future day they might hear their child announced as Mrs. A. Dare; but then, at that early period, the information was so sudden, so unexpected, she was niot Iat all prepared for it. Emma, too, when she imparted it, seemed deeply distressed-and that increased her solicitude.

But the good lady had mistaken the object of the senior Dare's morning call; it was to discuss an entirely different subject. "Good morning, brother Bartlett!" said the little clergyman, shaking his friend's hand with considerable warmth. "I have come to converse with you on a theme of the greatest importance; one that possesses the deepest interest to me at the presentjuncture of time," he added, depositing his cane and removing his overcoat as he spoke. Then adjusting his spectacles, (which he always wore,) he settled himself down in 'the comfortable rocking-chair his "brother" had drawn up to the fire for his accommo- dation. "About this political movement?' hebegan in his emphatic way. "I think it high time, my brother, that we clergymen were taking this matter into serious and prayerful consideration. The time is coming when church and state united will form an impregnable barrier against the inroads of Catholicism. The people of the South seem willing to join hands with us against this common evil, and if, sir, we can gain our point in this direction, it will be of infinite service in another; for can not our people, after driving the frightful monster, Popery, from our shores, with their concentrated strength *  '         y /  &#xD;<pb n="202-203" xml:id="VAC7466-00000102"/> 2032      EMMA BARTLETT: OR,    " and combined forces, carry on the warfare against slavery with renewed vigor?" I never approved of force 'work; it don't do well, particularly where matters of conscience are concerned." "Well, but, my brother, this hideous Catholicism must be checked; prompt, active measures must be taken to arrest its prosperous career. You must take this subject into serious, prayerful consideration, as I have done. I believe, sir, after much careful and deliberate thought on the subject, that this is the only way in which the prosperity of this priest-serving peo. pie can be interrupted. We must all go .earnestly to work and establish an American Church?bthat's the thing!" and he brought his finger down in his deter- mined, emphatic way. "Ah, my friend, that will never do! Never," he repeated, shaking his head. "An American Church! Why, sir," continued Mr. Bartlett, with more than usual warmth, 1" by the same process of reasoning, you might as consistently say,' We must have an American God!   How shocking, how blasphemous it sounds! No, no, brother Dare, Heaven will never prosper such proceedings. Why, the greatest charm  our earthly sanctuaries have, is that they are open to all ; rich and poor, Jew and Gentile, bond and free; all may come and worship in their courts.

Environ your church with the walls of prejudice, and she will cease to prosper. The'Spirit of God will cease to strive with the people." "But how, then, are we to put a stop to this wide- spread evil?" "Surely not by establishing a church that would, perhaps, be more despotic in its sway than the one you endeavor to subdue, brother Dare." "But why do you suppose this new movement will develop such traits?" "Because I have understood that before the appli- cants can become members of the Order, they have to declare on oath that they have not been reared by Cath- olic parents or guardians. In case they can not do this, even although they may be thoroughly Protestant in their views, they are not only excluded from the organization, but, with the tendency it has, all their aspirations for honor and distinction will be crushed; for if this new movement triumph, will they not be told that it is useless for them to aspire to any promi- nent position in the state?

Brother Dare, we have all the germs of despotism in us, and if these are notkept in check by other and kindlier sympathies, the consequences might be fearful. - You speak of the willingness of the people of the South to join hands with you in this mat ter. I believe you are in error there, especially if you refer to this forming an American Church. You are the second person I have heard advance that idea; your views on this point are peculiar, and I feel convinced that, generally speaking, the members of this new Order would not concur with you. If I understand their views aright, it is they who fear the union of church and state among those of the Catholic faith ; not that they so much dread that doctrine as the increase of its votaries, who, were they ever to outnumber those of the Protestant faith, might again manifest that spirit of persecution and cruelty that characterized their forefathers. I believe there are many, very many; noble, high-minded men belonging to the organization, who have attached themselves to it with none but the purest motives, and with the hope of advancing the inter- ests of their country.

"Ah, my brother," said Dare, shaking his head as he spoke, " you have not teken the subject into prayer- ful consideration, or you would not view it in the light you do. Those you choose to term fanatics are earnest workers in a good cause, allowing conscience to be their guide in whatever they do."

Experience has also shown the human family that a well-regulated government, with good and whole- some laws, contributes greatly to the prosperity and happiness of mankind. In such a government, the wicked are punished, the strong kept in subjection, and the weak protected. Virtue is rewarded, while vice and immorality are punished. The arts and sciences are encouraged; the husbandman is induced to plow, and sow, and reap, and in undisturbed repose to enjoy the fruits of his labor. The man of science gladly trims the midnight lamp, in order to make some new discovery for the common benefit of all. No country under Heaven enjoys greater peace and prosperity than ours; and only when her laws are disregarded and abused, will her happiness cease." "But, brother Bartlett, this moral law, traced on the tablet of every human heart-neither should it be disregarded, but held infinitely above all earthly codes.   PREJUDICE AND FANATICISM.    207 "My friend," returned the other, "I acknowledge no higher law than that declared in God's holy Word; and there I learn that he gave laws to His children, and expected them to abide by them. He established a patriarchal government, such as Abraham's, to which He required ilplicit- obedience. 'And God said unto Abraham, thou shalt keep my covenant, therefore, thou and thy seed after thee, in their generations.' Gen. xvii, 9. And again, 'And ye shall make no league with the inhabitants of this land; ye shall throw down their altars; but ye have not obeyed my voice. Why have ye done this?' Judges ii, 3.. Even monarchical and despotic governments are of His appointment. We are not to attribute it to chance that a Nero was per- mitted -to ascend the throne, or a Caligula to hold tyrannic sway! Believing such dispensations to be a portion of the Divine plan that is unsearchable and past finding out, we have only to look back and learn that the people were enjoined to yield strict obedience to those who held sway over them. "The children of Israel, too, were required by the law of God to bend their neck to the Egyptian yoke. On their return from Egypt, they were enjoined to obey the law of Moses, and by that law they were even to shed the blood of their enemies. They were told to exterminate the inhabitants of the Promised Land, not even sparing women or helpless children.

Joshua i, 18. "When Nebuchadnezzar took the Jews captive, and carried them to Babylon, even of the captive king he required obedience to the heathen laws. He said, 'Bring your neck under the yoke of the king of Babylon, and serve him and his people, and live,'- Jer. xxvii, 12. Again, Joseph, who was the servant of the true God, ruled over Egypt according to the decrees of- a heathen king. ' Brother Bartlett," said the other, leaning forward, while a self-complacent smile flitted over his face, '" you forget that those were Jews, and all this of which you have spoken was in -the olden time, under the Old Dis- pensation; we live in a more enlightened period, under a New Dispensation, and need not, as did they, subject ourselves ttjudges, kings and potentates." "And with what, let me ask you, does the New Tes- tament or New Dispensation begin? Is it not with a beautiful evidence of obedience to the laws of a heathen tyrant oil the part of Joseph and Mary?

'Render unto Ceesar the things which are Csesar's,' was the reply. Paul pre- sents the whole subject in a clear light;, he knew no higher law-religion, when he said, 'Let every soul be subject to the higher powers. For there is no power but of God; the powers- that be are ordained of God. Whosoever, therefore, resisteth the power, resisteth the ordinance of God, and they that resist, shall receive to themselves damnation. For rulers are not a terror to good works but to evil. Will thou then not be afraid of the power? Do that which is good, and thou shalt have praise for the same.' To me, brother Dare, it sounds perfectly absurd, to talk of being guided by conscience, instead of quietly acquiescing, in what our laws, enacted as they are by a free, independent people, exact. It is admitted that every one has a conscience, and that this silent monitor is capable' of being trained, as are the other faculties. The heathen mother, reared as she is in the school of idolatry, obeys the dictates. of her conscience, when she allows the infant that nes- tles on her bosom to pass from her arms, and be crushed by the fearful wheels of Juggernaut; or consigns the helpless innocent to the rushing waters of the Ganges, as a sacrifice to dumb idols.  "But, brother Bartlett," interposed the other, thiere  is little danger of our going to such extremes; they ar in heathen darkness, without the blessed light ofdfe Word-to guide them." 18  &#xD;<pb n="210-211" xml:id="VAC7466-00000106"/> 210       EMMA BARTLETr: OR, -( True, but your' higher law men' propose to adopt the self-same principles; and by so doing to disregard the teachings of the inspired volume, which, as you say, should be a ' light to their feet, and a lamp to their path,' My brother, we need not go so far as Heathen. dom to see this principle put in practice;- even in our own enlightened land, where you seem to think there is little danger of extremes, innumerable instances may be found. Take, for instance, a disciple of the late Joe Smith, as he is familiarly called. Ask the Mormon his reasons for adhering to the faith he has adopted, and he will profess to be guided by a sense of duty; he will tell you, also, that he had no conscientious scruples when he made choice of a score of wives, instead of one. He acts on the higher law principle, and one has only to visit the spot where these deluded people have resided for years, to learn to what outrages such perverted views, when put into practice, will lead.

I tell you, brother Bartlett," he continued, waxing eloquent in his turn, " there wh be no redemption for those who barter in flesh and blood, unless the enormity of their transgressions is impressed upon their minds, until they are persuaded to turn from the error of their ways; this is the very thing they need ; that their consciences should speak right out, and warn them to wash their hands of the awful curse." "-Brother Dare," returned his friend, smiling at his increasing warmth; " you should have been a politician ; I've thought so more than once; and supposing you were," he added, " and filled the most prominent office in our Union, what great evil would your conscience; first 'speak out against,' as you choose to term it? Would it not be slavery?  "It would, indeed," was the reply. "I should feel in duty bound to put forth every effort for its abolition; and if it were in my power, compulsory means should be resorted to, when all else failed. I should feel conscien- tiously right in taking such a step--for in such extreme cases I hold that the end justifies the means." "And yet, my brother, would not such an act be a species of despotism? Would it not be developing one of the very traits you so detested in your Catholic brethren.  &#xD;<pb n="212-213" xml:id="VAC7466-00000107"/> 212       EMMA BARTLETT: -OR, Were not many of the early Christians persecuted and tortured by them, with the hope of forcing those heroic martyrs into their way of thinking? I repeat what I said before: this force-work will never do. Why not, instead of ' keeping the subject agitated,' as you feel in duty bound to do, propose some reasonable plan for the gradual emancipation of the blacks- something to which you think the Southerners will be likely to accede.

"(Higher Law' again, brother Dare. Did you ever think,' he asked, after a few moments' reflection, "what a beautiful example of personal obedience to law Socrates has given us? How-when condemned by a most unjust sentence to die, when urged for his child- re ns sake to avail himself of the proffered assistance of his numerous friends; when reminded what Athens and his country would lose by his death-how gently, yet firmly he replied to their entreaties by saying sim- ply, that the laws must be obeyed." "Well, but, brother Bartlett, it was not intended by the frameors of the Constitution that slavery should spread; hence we need not consider that portion of it relating to slavery binding." "That is your understanding of it, but recollect   PREJUDICE AND FANATICISM.     213 others may think differently. But to speak plainly, brother Dare, I really think I have enough to do to preach the religion of the Gospel, and let politics alone. We can read for ourselves, and draw our own conclusions; but let us neither drag politics up to the pulpit, nor religion down to politics. Depend upon it, my brother, our manner of proceeding must, in some respects, seem strangely. inconsistent to our Southern friends. I was reading this morning some remarks in the Tribune with regard to white- labor among us. Just let me read it to you, to show how grossly incon- sistent it sounds for a person like Horace Greeley, who so denounces the practical operations of slavery in the South, to calumniate the institution as he does, and then publicly make this acknowledgment." Having said this, Mr. Bartlett proceeded to read the following' "We have a word to say to you, Messrs. Farmers, for which we ask your very earnest attention. We ask it both for your-own interest and the interest of our over-burdened, pauper-ridden city. You  are in the regular practice of hiring, in Summer, laborers from the city, both men and women, at such wages as you may, and of this we do not complain; it is your right. But it is not right that you should employ them at such wages as only serve to feed and clothe their fam- ilies during the warmnweather, and as soon as Winter approaches, send them' back for us to feed here in the  &#xD;<pb n="214-215" xml:id="VAC7466-00000108"/> 214       EMMA BARTLTT: OR, city until Spring. Such is the case, and ever has beenl since the great influx of foreign immigration has cen- tered in New York. We have no doubt that ten thou- sand persons who have labored in the country the past Summer,- will return here-to winter-to freeze or starve, or live as best they can on charity, soup, and ward reliefs. Many of them must so live or die." "Now, my friend," said Mr. Bartlett, laying the Tribune aside and picking up another paper, " is it any wonder that Mr. Prentice, of the Journal, after quoting the above paragraph, asks: ( "' With what color of fairness, with what possible show of candor or justice, can that editor, while exhort- ing the farmers of the North to mitigate their habit- ual and notorious cruelty to white laborers, denounce the cruelty of the farmers of the South, who, he well knows, would spurn such inhuman treatment of their slaves with indignant and manly scorn?

He would be an object of universal disdain and execration. The whole South would be too. narrow and too hot with scorn to hold him. And yet, here is a Northern editor, a deadly enemy of the South, who imputes a like degree of heartlessness to the farmers of the North, and who, nevertheless, in, the blindness of his bitterness, talks and even raves at the cold-blooded inhumanities of slavery.' "There, brother Dare, I have ventured to read the article through without your permission, because I think it worth a hearing." "But you can't eny," returned the other, promptly, "that there is inhutnanity practiced in the South; that such masters as Legree are to be found." "I doubt it, my friend, or if so, they are rare excep' tions, instead of true representatives of masters in general.  I do not pretend to deny that cruel masters may be found; exacting, selfish men, who allow passion to gain the mastery; who sometimes, when enraged, commit acts of violence which they afterward regret. But are such individuals confined to the  South?  Is not human nature the same the world over? Would a bad man in the South become entirely transformed, if transported to the North, or vice versa .  Did you never hear of cruel husbands in free states abusing, nay; even whipping their wives?

Wherever he is, he will find something' upon which to vent his rage. Did you ever think of the difference in social relatioins, North and South? I believe I can safely say, if yon examine the statistics, you- will find there are ten divorces annually in a free state, to one win a slave state, and- it is a fact worthy of notice, -that since she has been admitted into the Union as a state, Louis- ana has had few if any divorces placed upon her records. With regard to exceptions of cruelty, as T said before, they may be found. While visiting a friend in Mary- land, years ago, a report was circulated that a man on an adjoining plantation had whipped a servant to death; the other negroes said he had sworn he would whip her if she did not perform some required duty during his absence; that he had returned in the evening, and, on learning she had disregarded his authority, had sent for her, at the same time ordering large stick to be given him; that he had appeared very angry when it was handed to him, and had commanded the rest of the servants 'to go and attend to their business.' The servant girl died that night, and was buried on the plantation next day, and the current report was that she was whipped to death. The whole neighborhood was aroused, and with the proper authorities they sought the grave, disinterred the body, but found no marks of violence upon her person, except in one place, on the rid of the head. The, coroner's verdict was that slo   PREJUDICE AND FANATICISM.      21T came to her death by a blow dealt upon the head, and the master was sent to the State's Prison. NJ w, what does this argue? That he was a violent, -pssionate man-, and, provoked by a disregard of his aut ority, in the heat of anger struck her a bl6w which deprived her of life, instead of calmly and deliberately whipping her to death. You may say: that this was terrible, and I grant it, but-how far from Boston need we go for a similar instance of passionate violence? Was this more. criminal in the master to whom I refer than for Pro- fessor Webster-to take the life of Parkman, and delib. erately butcher him afterward? And now that I have given you an example of extreme violence, let me cite' to you one of excessive indulgence. The friend whom I visited jin Maryland had a maiden sister, who had been an invalid all her life, She her- self owned quite a number of; servants, among whom was a girl some twelve years old. Now, this child she had taken the entire charge of from the titne of its birth, and so attached had she become to it, she would scarcely allow it to leave her presence. It slept with her, sat on her knee, kissed her, and seemed to regard her as its mother. You may say this was fooli  as did many who witnessed her attachment fhechafe, and assert that such instances of indulgence are exceed- ingly rare. So was the example of rashness I men- tioned; and yet both are equally true, for I was an :eye-witness of these facts.

Now, brother Dare, let me ask you, do you consider it just that either of these should be held up as a fair representative of the owners of slaves through the South generally? No more than a common drunkard, or a silly, romantic girl would do justice to the true men and women of America, were they sent as representatives of our nation, to a foreign Court." Mr. Bartlett paused to hear what his "brother" had to say in reply, but that gentleman would neither admit the truth of his remarks, nor offer any arguments against them. Suddenly referring to his watch, he declared he had overstaid his time, and hurriedly took his departure. 'if     .    PBRZD o k AB- FANATCISM.     219 CHAPTER XIX. H0OWMSS BARTLETT INTRODUCES MR.

"I must hear first, Enmma,. before I deeide."

"Well, my dear, I have only to reply to you in the words of a cant saying, that you must remember 'there is such a thing as carrying the joke too far.'  [Had the same person gazed on Mr. Mitchell sixteen years before, as he sat in the reading-room, on  street, and then again on his open, manly countenance as he followed his wife and daughter into the ministers dwelling, and was ushered into the parlor by the ever- smiling Lena, he would have been led to remark that time had dealt lightly with the Southerner. An inti- mate friend might have observed a more perceptible change in her who had left her native home as his bride.

And the little Katie, aunt Milly's pet, the cherished bud that had given promise of such rare beauty, had expanded to a perfect blossom. It was a pleasant sight to behold the cousins, an hour after the arrival of the Mitchells, as they stood in Emmals room with their arms twined lovingly around each other, as though they had been acquainted for years. There was a fascinating brilliancy in the dark lustrous eye of the Southern beauty, a conscious superiority in her digni- fied bearing, and, in the expression of the full pouting lips, a something bordering on hauteur. As they stood there, the ethereal beauty of Emma seemed heightened by the contrast. It had caught Mr. Mitchell's eye as they ascended the stairs together; and when those soft blue orbs had been turned to his face, an old memory, aroused as it were from the buried past, had come float- ing up, but so dimmed had it been by intervening years, it seemed almost indistinct, and all he could recall was, that those features reminded him of some one he had seen before, but of whom he could not telL Mr. Mitchell had been elected as Representative to Congress and was then on his way to the Capitol.

Accordingly, after persuading her mother to accompany them, they had started without further delay, and on reaching a Southern sea-port had coasted it round. It had been arranged that Mrs. Mitchell and Kate should remain -in Boston, and when Congress adjourned, Mr. Mikthell would rejoin them. Scarcely had the latter allowed himself time to exchange greetings with his relatives before he was off to Washington City, leaving his wife and daughter behind.

What if Kate should get angry! She would not like to encounter an angry glance from those flashing eyes. Yet she did so want to carry out the joke. "What is the failing, Emma? I am anxious to know; you had better put me on my guard, and then I'll be, prepared for it." "Well," returned her cousin, without further hesita- tion, " all you have to do, when thrown into his company, is to speak tolerably loud." , And Emma withdrew her arm from her cousin's as she said this, pretending to busy herself in another direction, to conceal the blush that these words, which sounded so like equivocation, had painted on her cheek. What if it were only a joke? It seemed to her like a falsehood, and something within told her she had done wrong. "Deaf! is he? ' exclaimed Kate, not noticing her embarrassment, "1 poor fellow! 'I pity him. I'll certainly endeavor to raise my voice to a hearing key." The afternoon passed away, and with the evening came the expected beau. Mr. Bartlett, his wife and sister, sat talking about " auld lang syne,"' while Kate was giving Emma a history of her old nurse, aunt Milly, on whose many excellencies the young lady dwelt with considerable warmth. While thus engaged the front- door bell rang, and the next moment Lena appeared announcing Mr. Dare. There was a peculiar expression on the servant's face as she pronounced that name; Emma had observed it more than once, and wondered  &#xD;<pb n="224-225" xml:id="VAC7466-00000113"/> 24      .EtRMMA BARThmTT: OR,  what it meant. That the girl disliked him, she was certain, for not long before, when he had called and asked for "Miss Bartlett," Emma, who had just ascended the front stairs, heard her tell the gentleman, that "Miss Bartlett was not at home." Now, this was remarkable for Lena, for she had always been proverbial for her strict adherence to truth; and when Emma. interrogated her concerning it, the girl had seemed greatly agitated, and burst into tears, but refused to explain her conduct. Emma had attributed her emotion to the fear and shame that had overpowered her on being detected in a false- hood, and for this reason she had forborne to mention the circumstance to her parents. But on this particular eve- ning, Emma thought it seemed absolutely painful for the servant to give utterance to the word that passed her . lips. "Excuse me a minute, Kate," she said, and then entering the front parlor, she met her guest with a pleasant "Good evening."  After interchanging a few remarks, she informed him her friends had come, and before introducing her cousin to him she wished to request him to raise his voice, and speak very distinctly when he addressed her; adding that he would find her intelligent and agreeable if he could succeed in making her under- stand. With this, she begged him to be seated, and seeking her cousin, requested her to return with her.

"Mr. Dare," said Emma, elevating her voice to a high pitch, " allow me to introduce to you my cousin, Miss Mitchell." "Am happy to make your acqaintance," said Kate, pitching her voice some two notes above her cousin's. "This is an unexpected pleasure," said the gentle- man, in a still higher key than either of the ladies. 'I was not aware Miss Bartlett expected a visit from a friend," raising his voice still higher as he proceeded. "I thought I would take you by surprise," said Emma, in the same tone in which she had first spoken, and with this she suddenly disappeared from the room. "Mother," she said, repressing her merriment with a great effort, "my friends in the next room are labor- ing under a slight mistake; each imagines the other is troubled with deafness. Do listen! they are almost screaming at each other." Mrs. Bartlett laughed, patted her cheek, and called her a mischief. Mrs. Mitchell, too, seemed to enjoy the joke, but Emma thought her father looked rather serious, which, added to the scruples she had -felt  &#xD;<pb n="226-227" xml:id="VAC7466-00000114"/> 22A      r-MMA BARTLETT: OR, about putting it into execution, made her feel uncom. f0ortable. "'Was it wrong, Father?" she asked, moving quickly to his side, and laying her hand on his shoulder. "Yes," he replied gravely, " for although you had nothing in view but amusement, you should have recol- lected that it was a species of deception; and beside, you have laid yourself liable to forfeit the friendship of both your friends, or at least to incur their displea sure. How do you intend to undeceive them?" Emma did not know; she had not thought of that, and now began to be seriously alarmed about the result. "You needn't worry yourself about Kate," said Mrs. Miitchell? coming to her relief. "She'll relish it, and no doubt retaliate the first opportunity that offers." "You had better spend no further time in consider- ing, Emma, for it only makes the matter worse. Hark! they are talking at the top of their voices yet." The young girl now seemecd really frightened, and turning with a beseeching look to her father, she said, imploringly, "Do, Father, please help me out of this, and I '1 promise hereafter to have done with jokes." As the minister arose to acquiesce, he could hardly repress a smile. The noisy occupants of the adjoining room seemed equally desirous of demonstrating to each other the unlimited compass of their respective voices.   PREJUODICOB A-M.

Mr. Bartlett explained immediately, chiding Emma It the same time for perpetrating her jokes without first consulting either himself or her mother. Kate looked perplexed for a moment, then laughing heartily, and shaking her finger at her cousin, she promised to pay her up with interest. It was quite amusing to watch the various expres- sions of Mr. Dare's countenance. First a flush of anger passed over his face; this was quickly supplanted by a look of indignation, which said as plainly as words, "How dare you trifle with as august a personage as myself." And then succeeded an attempt at a smile, while from his lips he forced the twords, "( An excellent joke!"   Emma watched all this narrowly, and ven- tured to hope Mr. Dare would pardon her; they were so in the habit of jesting, she had little fear that he would take it seriously.

It was evident, he said, that he had not relished the joke. "What do you think of Mr. Dare?" asked Emma, when the two were left alone in the parlor. !"I hardly know," said Kate, laughing. "He did not make a very favorable impression, but that was your fault, for you know I thought the poor man was deaf." I'm really sorry I acted as I did; first, because it was wrong, and then it seemed to trouble Father so. He has a very high opinion of Mr. Dare, and I saw in an instant that he thought I was not treating him with the respect due to him." "Does he come often," asked Kate, running her fin- gers lightly over the keys of the instrument near ewhich she stood. "Yes, sometimes." "A devoted beau?" questioned the cousin, looking up inquisitively. "Then I must learn to like him for your sake," she said, significantly. "If you had said in my stead, you would have pleased me better," she replied, without the least embarrass; ment.  "I have wished more than once, for Fatheris   PREJUDICE AND- VANATrIrSM.    229 sake, I could entertain a somewhat higher regard for his friend." "You are like me, Emma, I expect; it would take an entirely different looking person to strike your fancy. One with soft hazel eyes and a wealth of chest- nut hair, with a slight inclination to curl. Ma often laughs at me, and says the original of my beau ideal would be an effeminate creature, whose girlish appear- ance would fail to command my admiration. She calls it a romantic freak, not at all in keeping with my ideas of pomp and grandeur.  But why do you smile, Emma?" "Because I was just thinking I knew of a gentleman who exactly suits your description. He is any thing but pompous, though! On the contrary, he is entirely unassuming, both in manners and conversation." "Well, Emma, I do admire a haughty bearing, when it sits gracefully on a person. But who is this original of my beau ideal? I am crazy to know." "A young gentleman by the name of Murphy, who - "What a shocking name!"   interrupted Kate. "Decidedly low, and Irish too! Pshaw, Emma; you don't suppose I could fancy a person bearing such a cog- nomen?" and before her cousin had time to reply, Kate swept her fingers over the piano keys, and as though carried off to the Emerald isle by the mention of that name, she struck up the tune of Rory O'More. &#xD;<pb n="230-231" xml:id="VAC7466-00000116"/> 2S0      -X3B  ABTBt AnL - i A1g have a queer way -of associating, things in my mind," she said, as the last strain died away. :Pota toes and Rory- O'More came into my mind as soon aa you said Murphy."

SELF-EXAMNATION.          - As she breathed his name, from her breast there came A sigh for the fate before her; And she bent her ear, for she longed to hear What her heart would say to the sudden fear That had swept like a tempest o'er her. IT was the hour for her teacher's arrival; Emma sat waiting impatiently for the well-known step. What if he should not come that morning? how disappointed she would feel! True, she had her cousin with her to while away the time, 'but, strange to say, her heart yearned for something more. Presently a step sounded in the hall, and she heard Lena, who stood polishing the knobs adorning the iron railing, invite some one to walk in. "That's he," she exclaimed, starting at the sound. Then advancing to the door, she opened it, saying, as she did so, "Good morning, Mr. Sun---  OO! Mr. Mur- phy! I thought it was my teacher." "I came in his stead, said that gentleman, bowing, "or rather, to say that indisposition renders it impossi- ble for him to fulfil his engagement."   PREJUDICE AND FANATICISM.    83 Emma looked disappointed, and her informant did not fail to notice the shade of anxiety that flitted over her countenance. He remained but a few moments; as he arose to go she ventured to ask, "Do you think he will be sick long? I will not know when to expect him." "I will keep you advised of his state of health; in the mean time, he hopes you will not neglect your prac- tiqing. Good morning." And he turned to depart. "Mr. Murphy,-"Emma hesitated an instant, and then added, "If Mr. Sundahl should be sick long, and want anything mother or myself could prepare - nourish- ment of any kind, it would gratify us to do it. He is, I believe, a stranger here, and might need such little attentions." This was said with some trepidation, and the person addressed marked her hightened color as she spoke. Thanking her in his friend's name, he promised to call on her if necessary, and took his departure. Throwing herself on the sofa, Emma gave vent to her surcharged feelings by sobbing convulsively; her agita- tion seemed painful in the extreme, and not until a half- hour had elapsed did she, in any degree, regain her composure. Then, although the tears had vanished, an ashy paleness overspread her features; and, as she sat, with her hands clasped convulsively, the wan despair pictured on her countenance told that the deep waters of her heart had been troubled, and though the waves of 20  &#xD;<pb n="234-235" xml:id="VAC7466-00000118"/> 234       EMMA BARTLETT: OR, feeling had ceased their commotion, the calm that fol- low6d was even more fearful than their sudden out-burst had been. "What did all this mean?" she thought. "Did she love Mr. Sundahl, and he a German?" And then the haughty curl of her cousin's lip was recalled. Could it be love? She did not know, for never before had she experienced such emotions. What would her parents say, were they aware of it? For the first time she felt that she could not go to her mother and make confession: heretofore, all her petty joys and griefs had been poured into that ear, but. now, to unburden her heart would be to banish the object, toward which it yearned, forever from her presence. Never until that morning had she fully realized the depth of her attachment; the intense pain occasioned by the fear that he might not recover, had first convinced her of the depth of her, feelings. Her thoughts again reverted 'to Kate; could she only confide in her it, might lighten the load; but then the words, (" preposterous, perfectly absurd," rang in her ears, and she abandoned the idea. Day after day did Emma endeavor to subdue her feel- ings, and, although she succeeded in a measure, the inward struggle made very perceptible inroads upon her health. The lustre of her eye was diminished, the bloom faded from her cheek, her step lost its lightness, and the merry tones that were wont to fall like glad music on he. parent's ear, were seldom heard.      .   PREJUDICE AND FANATICISM.     235 A week flew by, and although indisposition prevented her from receiving the word Mr. Murphy brought, she learned from Kate's lips that her teacher was growing worse daily. Kate had made the acquaintance of the former gentleman accidentally, which suited her all the better with her romantic views. Lena had ushered him into the parlor one morning when Miss Mitchell was the only occupant; from Emma's description she surmised instantly who it was, and with her habitual ease of man- ners introduced herself. Mr. Murphy was charmed both with her dazzling beauty, and sparkling conversation, and had made his friend's illness a pretext for calling oftener than he might have done had it not been for this accidental meeting. "Mr. Murphy just stepped in a minute, while- you were out with uncle, Emma; he said he wished to see your father; he will call round again this evening; he wants to speak to him," "What about ? " asked the cousin, anxiously " How should I know, child? I)idn't really think to ask him: I only promised myself the exquisite pleasure of seeing him again. But how white you are! You have over-taxed your strength by accompanying uncle on his visits of charity, to-day. I thought you were not well enough when you started. Come up stairs, and lie down." " How was Mr. Sundahl, did he say?"

Her anxiety was in no way relieved by Kate's reply, "Well really, Emma, I forgot to ask."  "Mr. Dare, too, is coming round to-night," said Emma, endeavoring to smile, "father and I met him on the street." "Indeed! well, do get rested and cheer up, Emma! You have looked dolefully for a few days, and it is my firm conviction, it is because you exact too many duties of yourself. Surely there are others in the city stronger and more able to supply the wants of the needy this cold weather. You are too zealous in good works, coz." "If Mr. Murphy does come for father he will not see him. He met a messenger at the front door, who came to take him to Charlestown, and he said he would probably not be back until very late, if at all to-night." Well, to-morrow will do as well I suppose, Ernma." Mr. Dare was conversing in an animated' style that evening, when the young book-keeper called. "4How does your friend seem  now?" asked the merchant, with great apparent concern. "He is no better," was the reply. "$Did you say he was no better?" asked Miss Bart-   PRBJUDICE AND FANATICISM.     237 lett, who, although she had listened attentively, failed to catch the words. "(I consider him much worse this evening; he is en- tirely delirious, and I called to say that it will not be necessary to have Mr. Bartlett come round, as he is now incapable of talking rationally, and could not com- municate what he wished to." t Father would have gone round immediately, had he been in the city. He will regret it when he returns, I am sure." "I must call round and see him," said Dare, " have been intending to for several days past, but business was pressing, and I could not possibly get away." Fearing to trust his friend long in any other hands than his own, Mr. Murphy hastened back. "Your teacher's illiness interferes with your music," said Dare, observing Emma's abstracted manner after his clerk's departure. "From what Dr. Graham tells    ' me, there is -little hope of his recovery," he added, fixing " his gaze on her. The young girl started slightly ; those words seemed but the utterance of the fears that took possession of her when. Kate mentioned the object of young Murphy's visit. "You liked him as a teacher?" continued the mer- chant, still regarding her attentively. "Very much," she returned, ("I admire him, too, as a gentleman," she added, without appearing to notice his searching scrutiny.  &#xD;<pb n="238-239" xml:id="VAC7466-00000120"/> 3^J      NENMMA -BARTLETT : O-01 A flush passed over Dare's face at these words, then compressing his lips after the fashion of his father, when he determined to carry out some design, he remained silent. In fact, Mr. Dare had- at that moment resolved on something, the execution of which he concluded, after thinking the matter over, might not result beneficially to himself. When Emma spoke in such high terms of her teacher, the thought had occurred to him thllat there was at least a possibility of her becoming interested in him, and he had come to a sudden determination to inform her father of his suspicions. -But Emma was far-seeing; she had evinced that on several occasions, and should she suspect his motive, all his hopes for the future would be blasted; therefore he wisely chose to desist. True, his first advances had been met coldly, but what of that? he had been too hasty in his avowal, and he flattered himself that when his hand and for- tune were again offered, it would not be in vain. True, her manner toward him had undergone a percep- tible change; she was more reserved in his presence, had-ceased her- playful badinage and quick repartee, and often when he addressed her, she had -seemed pain- fully embarrassed. Did not all this argue in his favor? Had not his professed attachment awakened a respon- sive cord-in her bosom, and was- it not the deepening Of -this new, mysterious feeling to which she had- hith- . erto been  a stranger, that sealed her lips- in his   PREJUDICE AND FANATICISM.     239 presence? Thus he had chosen to interpret it, and not until he heard her earnest inquiry after another's wel- fare, did- a cloud of doubt arise to mar his tranquillity. The girls had retired that night long before the minis- ter returned. Kate was slumbering sweetly as he as- cended the stairs, but Emma's ear caught his foot-fall, for her eyes had not closed, nor-did they through the long, weary. watches of the night. Very quietly she lay, for she did not wish to disturb the sleeper at her side; yet despite her efforts, she" could not still the tumultuous throbbing of her heart, nor check th sigh that arose involuntarily to her lips. The Igolden chariot of Aurora had just begun to climb ! the amarynthine steeps, when, feverish and unrefreshed, the young girl arose, and after gazing for an instant on her cousin's features, beautiful even in repose, she hastily completed her toilet and glided from the room; "Why, daughter, are you up so early'?" exclaimed her father, whom  she met ascending the steps on his way from the kitchen. "Yes," she replied, smiling, " you know we promised each other yesterday to continue our round of visiting, and I have arisen to prepare for an early start. You did not get much sleep, did you, father?  You had not returned when I retired.,  - "Not a great deal last night, Emma; and I could have prolonged my morning's nap without any   . com punctions had I not been compelled too arise and attend  &#xD;<pb n="240-241" xml:id="VAC7466-00000121"/> 240      'EMMA BARTLETT: OR, to the solid comforts;" and he pointed to the basket on his arm, as he spoke. "Going to market, aint you?  I believe the walk would do me good; have a good mind to go along, just for a freak." "-Well, get your bonnet and shawl. 1'll wait.". Emma flew Btck to her room, and soon returned, equipped for the walk. "Mr. Murphy called round twice to see you yester. day, father," she ventured to sav, as they walked along. "I should rather imagine his visits were intended for the young ladies," he said, pleasantly. "No, father, you're mistaken. Mr. Sundahl is very sick, and it is he who wanted you." "Mr. Sundahl! your teacher?  I was not aware of that. What's the matter?" "Fever, I believe he said. Why, he has been sick these two weeks, father. I have not taken a lesson for that length of time." "Indeed! My absence from home has kept me in ignorance of the fact. If you had just thought to have spoken of it yesterday, I would have called; however, -it is not yet, I trust, too late." "I told Mr. Murphy I thought you would call to-day. It must be hard to be sick in a strange land, away from kindred and friends." "Yes, my dear; but I trust he has learned to lean   PREJUDICE AND FANATICISM.     241 on his truest Friend in his affliction. Did his young friend leave his address?"

We are directly in front of it; how strange!" ( Suppose you stop and inquire how he feels this morning, father. You could make a longer visit at a later period." Emma waited breathlessly for her father's reply, and when he said, in his quiet, gentle way, (' I think we had better, love, it might gratify him to see his pupil as much as myself;" he did not know how that young heart leapt up at his words, or what a mighty effort she made to still its tumultuous beatings. On entering the sick-chamber they found young Mur- phy bending over his friend's couch. Flushed with fever, Mr. Sundahl lay upon the bed, gazing wildly around. Surprise was depicted on the minister's face as he gazed at the prostrate form; it was evident he had not expected to find him so low. He laid his hand gently upon the burning temples, and breathed the sufferer's name; but ndo look of recognition came as a reply. The vacant eye rested for-a moment on the good man's countenance, then wandering away to where Emma stood, it seemed riv- eted on her face. 21  &#xD;<pb n="242-243" xml:id="VAC7466-00000122"/> i 4e       CM2 e,3A BARTLETT: OR, OC1me hither, my daughter; he recognizes you, I think," said Mr. Bartlett, observing the glance. The young girl tremblingly approached. Still the fixed glare seemed riveted on her face, and as she reached her father's side, the parched lips opened suddenly, and in a dry, husky voice the sick man mur- mured, "Rosalie, meine Rosalie!"   Then outstretching his arms, in a tone of mournful tenderness he added, "Ist meine Rosalie zurich gekommen? Wo bist du so lange geweson, meine seuszes maedchen?"   A faint, sickening feeling crept to Emma's heart, as she heard him, in- his, delirium, call her by another name. The other words were in a foreign tongue, yet, though unin- telligible to her, she knew from the tone that they were endearing accents.  And who was Rosalie?  She knew not; cared not to know then; it was agony enough to learn that he, to whom-she had given her heart unasked, bowed at another shrine, and even then, in her presence was repeating the name of the adored one.  We may not pause to describe the intense torture of that brief period, when the truth first flashed upon her mind, nor to portray  her thoughts when she recalled the deep interest he had manifested in her progress, the approving smiles he had given her, the softly breathed words that had fallen on her ear, all- of which she had attributed to a  deeper feeling- than mere regard, but which she not was forced to believe was nothing more. f   PREJVODICE AND FANATICIS.      2,43 As she thus mused her teacher again repeated the name that sent a pang through her bosom, and he once more held out his hands imploringly. But Emma moved not; the vacant stare of those midnight orbs, appalled her, and grasping her father's arm convulsively, she said, in a scarcely articulate whisper, ," Take me away; I am afraid." Mr. Bartlett aroused himself, for he, too, had been thinking-thinking back to the days of other years; that name had called up a host of memories that long had slumbered. The orphan that he had protected in the years agone, seemed to rise before his mental view; pale, atten- uated, and care-worn, were the features; yet the resem. blance to his Emma was startlingly striking. He had thought of it often as his daughter approached the age of womanhood: and now, as she stood by his side, and a stranger a  native of the same land as was Rosalie, was, in the delirium of fever, repeating the very name the orphan  bore, a sudden fear took possession of him, a panful suspicion that he who lay there, prostrated by sickness, had left his native shores in order to seek for the child, and perhaps rob him of his treasure. Perhaps Rosalie, herself, had sent him; and as the latter idea suggested itself to his mind, he involuntarily passed his arm around the fair being who trembled beside him, as though he feared that even then she might he snatched from his embrace.

But Emma seemed deaf to every sound, save the soft, persuasive tone that kept pleading for her to approach. She did not hear her father's whispered inquiry, "T( whom belongs the name he keeps repeating?" nor note young Murphy's manner as he gave the laconic answer, "A sister." Had her ear caught that last word, the keen anguish she then suffered might have vanished instantly, and many a long, weary hour passed in fearful solicitude, have been spared her. Neither did she observe the shade"deepen on the minister's brow, -when that reply was given ; his worst fears seemed confirmed ; a brothel had been sent to reclaim the charge consigned to their keeping. The mother's heart had yearned toward her offspring, and forgetful of her promise, she had sent tk demand her child.

"Yes, love, instantly," he replied, and then promis- ing Mr. Murphy to call again, he turned his steps to the door. "Fort, fort! meine Rosalie ist fort!" said the sick man, in a mournful tone, as his eye followed the reced- ing figures. On reaching the street, the two traversed several squares in silence, both fully occupied with their own thoughts. The mninister's musings seemed to perplex him, and several times he turned abruptly, as though to speak to his daughter. It would be but natural, he thought, for her to mention to her mother the name she had heard her teacher repeat, and nothing more than probable that his wife's worst fears would be aroused, as had been his own, were she to associate that name with the German who had frequented their house. This suspicion might be groundless, and unless it was absolutely necessary that his wife should share them, he would rather not awaken her anxiety by mentioning the interview.  He wished, for this reason, to request his daughter not to speak of the call they had made; yet being unable to give her a reason for so doing, he hesitated.

"He came to say that my services would no longer be required at Mr. Bartlett's; that gentleman himself had requested him to say so. He gave no reason for this unceremonious dismissal; but, as he offered me wages in compensation for my services, I saw a gleam of triumph in his eye, and I believed then, as I do now, that he was the instigator of this movement.

"You have just informed me of a visitor I was not aware had been here; and now let me return the favor by telling you that Miss Bartlett herself came to see you during your sickness."

Did they come more than once?" "No, she did not; the minister made several short calls before you took a turn for the better. You fright- ened the poor girl so, I expect she was afraid to repeat her visit. You were delirious, and kept calling for Rosalie all the time she stayed." "[For Rosalie!" said the other dreamily; 'well, no wonder. But what led you to think she cares for me?" "I thought when you mentioned that name she seemed pained, and I imagined a cloud of jealousy flitted over her face. However, my fancy may have deceived me. But if she has any deep regard for you, her worst fears would. be aroused when she heard you call upon another in your delirium." His companion was silent for a few minutes; then, shaking his head doubtingly, he said, "I am almost afraid to hope, Earl; the disappointment will be bitter enough, but I must know the worst!

"Is Mr. Bartlett at home?" he asked of Lena, hav- ing resolved to see that gentleman, and inquire whether he had been correctly informed by his employer; for once his suspicions of Dare were wrong, for, though nothing but the fear of detection had prevented the merchant from intimating that the German's assistance was bestowed from interested motives, still, as we have seen, he was innocent of that with which Mr. Sundahl charged him. He himself was as much surprised as the teacher had been when Mr. Bartlett took him aside, and, without assigning any reason for his conduct, had requested him to deliver the message to his clerk. "No, sir," was the servant's reply; " he went to -- early this morning, and will not be back till night." "Miss Bartlett, then, can I see her?" he asked, with some trepidation. "I will inquire.

Still as her eye was fixed on the needle she plied so industriously, more than once she found herself wondering who Rosahe was. "Does she live away over the blue ocean, in his native land? Is she very beautiful? Does she love him devotedly? Will the days of his absence drag wearily on to her, and will she count the moments till he returns? When he reaches her side, will that dear familiar voice make her spirit leap up within her, and will the sound of his approaching footstep send the blood tingling through her veins?" "Mr. Sundahl wishes to know if he can see Miss Bartlett," said Lena, appearing at the chamber door. "Mr. Sundahl?" said Emma, starting, then recover- ing her self-possession, she added, "is it possible he is able to be out so soon?" "What is it? ' asked Mrs. Bartlett, looking up from the paper that had so entirely absorbed her attention. "Mr. Sundahl, my teacher, is down stairs and wishes to see me. I suppose there is no need of asking to- be excused, for you and aunt are so fully occupied you   PREJUDICE AND-' FANATICISM.    258 won't miss me, and Kate has-paid my powers of enter- tainment a high compliment by falling asleep," said Emma, risingo to go. "Ask him when he will be able to resume his instruc- tions, dear," said the mother, as she left the apartment. It was well for him the minister was not at home, for had that been the case, this interview might not have been granted. As it was, Mr. Bartlett had not as yet told hip wife and daughter of his determination to dispense with the German's services; not wishing to give his reasons he had refrained from broaching the subject, believing it would be time enough to speak of his design at any time before the invalid's recovery, and that, judging from the severity of the attack, would not probably be effected for a fortnight to come. Emma was, therefore, entirely ignorant of the message her teacher had received when she entered the -parlor, and extending her hand congratulated him on his recov- ery. "My manner toward him shall not change," she thought, " because another's image is enshrined in his heart. Neither shall he- suspect what an effort it has cost me to subdue my feelings." But if Roderic did not suspCt, he knew by the pallid features of her who stood before him, that something had wrought a change in the young being who had here- tofore -been so full of buoyancy and life. He felt the waxen fingers, as they touched his emaciated palm, tremble, and as with a nervous grasp he involuntarily  &#xD;<pb n="254-255" xml:id="VAC7466-00000128"/> ;       EMMA BPAimLBE: 'R retained her hand, he marked the hightened color of her cheek. "Mr. Sundahl!" burst from Emma's lips, while a look of displeasure darkened her face. The thought that he suspected her feelings, and was attempting to trifle with her love, rushed through her mind; for what other motive had he, could he have? Was not Rosalie the idol before which his heart did homage? Drawing her- self proudly back, as these thoughts suggested themselves to her mind, she stood with her eyes bent upon the floor; for, although she had endeavored to meet the glance bent upon her, the mantling flush that she felt had suf- fused her temples, told her the repetition of such an attempt might betray what she most wished to conceal. Roderic stood as though transfixed, gazing admiringly upon those faultless features, which, at that moment, seemed more transcendently beautiful than ever before. He had been unprepared for this sudden rebuff, and, had not Dare's words been recalled, and with themn the thought that this might be his last opportunity of unbur- dening himself, he might have desisted, for the proud manner in which she had turned from him, gave him but little hope. However, he must speak, let the conse- quences be what they might. While wending his way to the minister's dwelling he had arranged methodically his manner of proceeding; had repeated to himself more than a score of times, just what he intended to say. He would begin by giving her a description of his home in   PREJUDICE AND FANATICISM.      255 the Fatherland, and then tell her how lonely he found it without a gentle being to share it with him; and from this he would go on to mention his hopes and fears, and finally end with an eloquent, touching appeal to her to become his wife. Poor Roderic! mistaken man! with him it was as with thousands of his fellows. He forgot every word of his studied oration ; did not even once refer to his wealth or possessions, and, worst of all, began at the very point he intended to leave for his closing remarks. "Emma Bartlett," he began in a quivering tone, "I love you; from the first moment my eyes rested on you I have felt- a wild worship for you; a great, yearning desire to call you my own. I am a foreigner, and am aware of the prejudices existing in the minds of your countrymen against us, as a nation; your parents proba- bly share this national trait; and you, perhaps, are pos- sessed of the same feelings. Be that as it may, you have become indescribably dear to me, and something here," pointing to his bosom, " tells me I may not return to the Fatherland, without first removing the screen from my heart, and asking you to examine its secret workings; without entreating you, first to behold whose image is indelibly engraved there?" As the speaker paused to mark the effect of his words, the fair girl raised her soft, full orbs to his, while from her parted lips came the question, "And Rosalie --what 'will become of her?"

" Was ! " exclaimed Emma, in undisguised astonish- ment, a sudden light overspreading her features, "is she not yet alive ? " " No," he returned, looking fondly into her upturned face. O! how like the glorious creature of his youth- ful days did she then seem! how he longed to clasp her to his bosom !  Only venturing to take the snowy hand that was now allowed to lay passively in his, he leaned against a chair for support, and said, as he watched the various expressions that flitted over the face of the wondering girl, " Rosalie was what Emma is; she was just like your own dear self, wondrous fair, and I loved her with all the fervor of an ardent nature. She was the guiding star of my youth, and when she was taken, a starless night followed. Life seemed a dreary waste, a gloomy, barren wilderness. For fifteen years I strug- gled on in the path of duty, and when- my aged father was called to go, and I alone remained of the whole family, I left my native land, and- here, in a foreign clime, among strangers, have I been sojourning for months. It seems strange to myself that I linger away from my home, especially when I find America so different from what I supposed. It took me but a short time to learn that I was looked on suspiciously because I am a foreigner.

The result I can plainly foresee, and my hope is that the ocean may roll between me and Colum- bia before such a state of things is brought about. Yes, Emma," he went on, ( you are all the one that binds me here now. From the time I first gazed upon that brow, the old flame that had been crushed for years burst forth with renewed brightness, my boy- hood's dreams have all come back. I almost fear to ask whether you return my love. You are so like the gentle being I once hoped to call mine, that an assu- rance from your lips that this love is inrequited, would send a death-like chill to my heart, and almost make me believe that she had arisen from her grave to say the vows she once breathed were false. No, no, Em- ma, and he wiped the moisture from his eye as he spoke, "if you can not return what I offer, do not tell me so; keep silence. Cold words from you would freeze the life-blood in my veins." And, overpowered by his emotions, he sank into a chair. Emma, who had not moved, scarce breathed, during his- recital, now raised her eyes, dewy with tear-drops, to his face, and as her slight frame quivered, she replied, in a deep, earnest voice, "I cap not keep silence." Dear girl! she made a narrow escape, for though her heart. prompted a whale volume of words, her lips  &#xD;<pb n="258-259" xml:id="VAC7466-00000130"/> biS8      EMMA BARTLETT:  R, refused to give them utterance. She longed to tell him how fully she returned his heart's free offering. Yet, though the ruby portals unclosed, and the ivory gates flew back at her command, her voice, overwhelmed as it were by the great waves of feeling within, refused to do its office. Yes, she did keep silence, but the absence of words -did not deceive the dark orbs bent upon her, or prevent the hand that clasped her own from pressing the trea- sure it held to lips whose crimson tips were all ready to syllable the endearing terms that a moment after- ward fell upon her ear; nor prevent him from drawing that fair head to his bosom, and laying his cheek to hers. The tenderness of a father and the rapture of a lover were mingled in-that first embrace. Was she not Rosalie's child, and had she not tacitly assured him his love was reciprocated? With him it was a second attachment, but with- her, affection's waters had for the first time bubbled up, and drowned remembrance in a flood of ccstacy. She forgot, in that moment of rap. ture, that innumerable barriers divided their destinies. It mattered not to her then that another land had given him birth.

They think you an Ameri- can; so you will not have the prejudice against your native land to overcome."

The woman who accepts my hand must know as much of my early history as I do myself." "Your father was a proud man, Karl Hutten; he was a baron, and you have good reasons to be proud of your ancestry," said Roderic, not wholly satisfied with his answer. The Fatherland, too, is beautiful, my friend. No portion of America that I have seen can compare with it." "You have had little opportunity of judging of the rich and varied scenery in many parts of the Union; her sparkling waterfalls- and vast rolling prairies," re- turned his young friend, with animation. "And you, Karl, can form but a faint conception of th6 picturesque beauty of our rural districts.

If your identity can be proved, you may boast an inheritance there, only in a few respects inferior to my own; the homestead in which you drew your first breath." "What mean you?" cried the other, in astonish- ment. Mr. Sundahl went on to explain in a few words, and then added, "I had a reason for withholding this information until now, which I will explain when we reach our native- land'." "' Then will you indeed accompany me?" cried Karl, grasping his hand. "This is proffering much." "You might have difficulty in proving your identity without me; and even without taking this into consid- eration, did I not promise the lost one to be to you as a brother? This alone, aside from the love I bear you, would urge me-to attend your steps." '"But your --- second Rosalie?" he suggested, for an instant at a- loss how to mention the fair girl's name.

No, Karl, we have only to wait. If, on my return, her feelings toward me are unchanged, I shall openly ask, their consent, and if they refuse, why, then Emma shall decide for herself. We will do nothing hastily, and I trust will have no cause to repent.

"Would you advise me to mention it before we start?" A"Yes, surely; there is nothing more unpleasant than suspense. The minister, as you say, looks favorably on you; he has not sent you word that your visits at the house are no longer required. As for me, I may not indulge in the hope of seeing Emma more than once till I return. She told me at our last interview that she thought her father suspected an interest had sprung up between us, for he had inquired if [ had been there since my sickness, and on being answered in the affirmative, had expressed dissatisfaction, and hoped my visits would not be renewed.

"' Why, Katie dear, I don't profess to be gifted with the faculty of reading hearts; how could you imagine such a thing?" "There's no use, Emma; you do surmise the truth, and I might as well confess, at once. - They say, that sympathy sometimes assuages grief, and I'll try the experiment by confiding all.

And then, too, as Kate's head rested on her breast, Emma placed her lips close to her cousin's ear, and whispered a full confession of her own hopes and fears. Then, for the first time, did they both truly feel that sympathy was sweet; and, as their hearts kept beating with the same tumultuous throbs, a new link seemed added to the love-chain that before united them. "O! Emma, Emma!" said Kate, raising her head as though suddenly recollecting something, "I forgot to tell you; it is the best of all, too! his name isn't Mur- phy!

"That is a joke," said Emma, laughing; "forgotten the name of your enchanter!'" "Why, pshaw! how dull I am. It is something like beef, or mutton, I really believe."

A soft carnation stole into Emma's cheek, when, for the first time, she heard herself breathe that name aloud. "It may be so in your case, for uncle is more liberal in his views than pa; he might be wrought upon and finally persuaded to give his consent; but I've heard pa express himself with regard to foreigners too often; he absolutely dislikes them." "Why?" asked Emma   "Have they ever injured him in any way?" "No: but it is the way with many in the South; they never put foreigners on an equal footing with Americans; always seem to consider them a step below." "That's ungenerous, Kate." "Yes, I know; and yet I have imbibed many of their notionsa It is really inexplicable! perfectly marvelous that my heart should have chosen one of these same people, above all others."

The two went round and found the merchant alone in the counting-room. He regretted exceedingly the loss of Mr. Murphy's services; had flattered himself that he had given entire satisfaction. The ex-book-keeper had nothing to complain of; he was about to leave. the city, to be absent some months, and on his return might not want a situation. "So you have lost your pupil!" said the merchant, turning to Mr. Sundahl, with a malicious smile. The person addressed colored slightly, as he bowed assent, and then informed Dare that he hoped to resume his instructions at some future period. "Then you have forgotten the message I brought. Let me assure you that such an attempt would incur the. displeasure of the family'," said Dare, without endeav- oring to conceal the irritation his words had ocasioned. "But not of the fair pupil herself," suggested the German, with a provoking smile.. This was the one drop too much. Dare's indignation seemed unbounded.   "Sir," he said, in a voice trem- bling with rage and excitement, " you forget who you are.  Like many of your countrymen, you come to our shores and aspire to be equal to any in the land.

Dare was entirely unprepared for this. It made him perfectly furious. Such impudence, and from a Dutch- man, was not to be borne! Yet, how could he resent it? With as great an antipathy as he had for single combat, he could not think of fighting. He had always been too careful of his precious life to risk it in a scuffle ; and even in his boyhood had chosen to endure the jeers of his companions, rather than make any pugnacious display of his strength. He was equally opposed to using weapons of defense, and often was heard to hold forth on the "terrible state of things in the South, where men shot each other down like wild beasts, if they dared to address one another in language other than respectful." We agree with Mr. Dare, that it is certainly unfor- tunate and lhuch to be regretted, that our Southern brethren are so hasty and passionate as in an unguarded moment to take the lives of their fellow men merely for a trifling misunderstanding, but we must confess that we would infinitely prefer to live in a community  &#xD;<pb n="274-275" xml:id="VAC7466-00000138"/> 27?A       MMA BARTLETT: OR, where men feel that they are not allowed to use those low, contemptible inuendoes that frequently arouse the worst passions of our nature; where one man can open- ly insult another, often with the design of provoking his victim to make a personal attack on him, which he leaves unresented, and then goes to law about it, with the hope of recovering the pitiful sum of a few dollars, and afterward secretly congratulates himself on his cuteness. But we left Mr. Dare in a dilemma, from which there seemed little hope of his extricating himself. All at once a thought struck him. He could not resent the insult offered to his dignity, but Porter, that great six-footer, could. Beside, it would do his soul good to devil the Dutchman, for he (Porter), had often told him he hated the whole set, like rattlesnakes.

"Excuse me, Mr. Dare," said the summoned assistant, a sudden vision of two tightly clenched hands, threaten- ing instant destruction to his proboscis if he offered the least resistance, bursting quickly on his mental view. "Excuse me," he repeated, as his employer looked the   - PREJUDICE AND BANATTA5SM.    276 picture of offended dignity; "Mr. Sundahl and myself are upon the most amicable terms; it is out of my power to comply with your request, and bowing politely he took leave of the trio.

"I will seek an interview with you on my return. We will meet again," he said, accenting every word clearly, and with a peculiar emphasis ; " good morning," and he passed into the store, answered one of the clerk's interrogation as to how long he would he absent, and passed out, followed by Karl. "Two months," soliloquized Dare, who had heard his reply. "It may be a subterfuge, and who knows but he may lie in wait for, and assassinate me. It is just like these foreigners; they are so blood-thirsty and revenge- ful; , and the surmise in which he had indulged caused a cold shudder to pass over him. Three days afterward the farewells, lingering, sad, and tender, had been spoken, and Roderic and Karl were on the blue ocean, every moment widening the space between them and those to whom their hearts had been entrusted until their return.  &#xD;<pb n="276-277" xml:id="VAC7466-00000139"/> 276       ElMMA BARTLET: OR, CHAPTER XXIII. THE  WIFE'S   TRIAL.

By the unbeliever, by hint who has little reliance on the all-sufficient Arm, little faith in the promises of the blessed Word, afflictions are met with murmurings and repinings; but when the good man is called to endure, it is beautiful to see with what child-like submission he yields to the Father's decree; with what a patievpt and uncomplaining spirit he acknowledges the justice of the stroke. Mr. Bartlett was ill very ill; it was an alarming attack, and threatened a speedy termination if not instantly relieved. The devoted wife and daughter stood motionless by the bed-side, with blanched cheeks and tearful eyes, as they heard the physician say, hopelessly,   PREJUDICE AND FANATICISM.     2" that he had tried the last remedy.

All night they watched by his bed-side, and, when orning came, the disease took a turn, and though he lay entirely insensible to pain, the symptoms were none the less fatal. "Dear father, are you not better?" asked Emma, passing her hand gently over his brow. "No, love, I fear not." "You will not leave us, George! No, no, we could not do without you!" and the wife buried her head in the pillows beside him. "If it is the Lord's will, we should not murmur, Emma," he said, laying his hand caressingly on the bowed form. "I know, I know! but O! it is terrible, terrible to think of losing you." "Remember the promise  I will be a father to the fatherless, and the widow's stay.' A word with you alone," he added. The daughter withdrew.

He has some peculiar views, but I think he is actuated by what he conceives to be right; his motives I believe are good, and he will doubtless make her a kind, affectionate husband. Your future home, my love, must be with her; you know I have been no financier, and have always spent what I made in my Master's vineyard, in feeding and clothing the needy of His flock, trusting He would provide for the lambs of my household, should 'they be bereft of my care and protection.

You have exhausted yourself already; we can speak of this at another time." "Another time might be too late," he said in a fee- ble whisper, closing his eyes wearily. Yes, it was well that he had spoken ; for in the silent watches- of the night, the white-winged messengers, many of them we doubt not the departed souls of those he had toiled to save, glided earthward, and entering the household of faith bore to the mansions prepared in his Father's kingdom the disembodied spirit of the good and faithful shepherd. Ah, what a void, what a great, aching void was then created in two loving hearts! In two did we say? yes, in three, for Anna Mitchell loved her brother with all the fervor an only sister feels, and as they consigned him to the tomb, she remembered that she was the only remaining one of the dear family band gathered under the roof 'tree of home in by-gone years. And now the recent bereavement seemed to link the sorrowing widow and only sister more closely toge- ther. On hearing of the sad event, Mr. Mitchell had hastened to Boston, and after passing several days in earnest solicitation with Mrs. Bartlett, urging herself and Emma to prepare to accompany them South in the course of a fortnight, he had returned to Washington to wait until Congress adjourned. Poor Emma! for the first time her eyes were open -to the painful fact  &#xD;<pb n="280-281" xml:id="VAC7466-00000141"/> 280      EOMMA BARTLETT: OR, that she stood alone in the world. Her father had been so devoted to her happiness, so regardful of her every wish, and she had learned to look up to him with such perfect, child-like confidence, the thought of pass. ing along without a protector seemed fearful to her. Then she thought of Roderic, and the impulse was strong within her to await his return, and take shelter in his protecting arms. But could she do this, and leave -her mother, the dear gentle being who had watched over her through years of helpless infancy and tender youth? Who had passed so many sleepless nights over her pillow, when sickness laid her low? Should she forsake her' now in her deep affliction? "No, no," she thought, " love is strong, but duty must triumph here." Then remembrance reverted to Mr. Dare; she recalled the protestations of undying love to which he had forced her to listen; and called to mind his circumstances. An alliance with him would render her independent, and afford her an opportunity of offering her dear mother a home in the place of her nativity? Did duty call upon her to make the sacri- fice? Her heart sickened at the thought. "O! I can not do this," she murmured, ' mother would not ask it, would not allow it!" Then again her thoughts went back -to Roderic. She had looked forward with such joyful expectation to the time when she would welcome him back; but now, ere he again crossed the threshold, she would be far away   PREJUDICE AND FANATICISM.     281 in the sunnyv South, among the very people Kate had said were so prejudiced against her lover's countrymen; and even if he should seek her there on his return; would he iot meet with more violent opposition from her uncle than her father: would have shown him? Pained by these reflections, Emma arose and bent her steps toward her chamber. On passing the study, she thought she heard a low sob; the door was ajar,-and she looked in. There sat her mother in the easyvchair so often occupied by the departed; her head rested on one hand, and with the other she clasped a Bible - his Bible. The daughter's heart was touched; she could not pass on. Entering noiselessly, she stole to the mourner's side, and kneeling down, by her, buried her face in her lap, sobbing aloud, "O! mother, mother, mother! how can we endure this?" That-low wail of anguish aroused the bereaved wife from the great- storm of grief sweeping over- her. Folding her daughter tenderly to her bosom, she said, in broken accents, "We've one another left, darlng. O! Emma, my child, had/ you not been sent, I must have borne this affliction alone!"-  And now, as the fair girl rested her head on that, bosom that had so often pillowed it, she repeated the words that had so ofteni before passed her lips, "I will never be separated from you, mother, never." "I -can not ask that, dear; it is too much.

"So they were; but, though II can not understand why your father spoke in this manner, IFms sure he had good reasons for it; for he never was one to let trifles change his regard for a friend. and I know he esteemed Mr, Sundahl highly until after he recovered from that attack of fever. I've thought that, perhaps, during his sickness, your father might have heard him express his views on religion, or rather against it, for you know there are many infidels in those foreign countries." O! mother, he is not an infidel," exclaimed Emma, unable longer to listen silently to false suspicions, "Your surmise doeis him gross injustice. He believes as much in the protecting care of our Heavenly Father as you or I,; or even father could have done. Blame him no more than he deserves.- Let us try to remem- ber the command, t Be merciful.'

Is it not plau- sible, dear?" 6Yes. . 4"However, I shall have no fears," she continued, looking steadily at Emma as she spoke. "Even if an interest has sprung up in this young bosom, I'm sure    my daughter would bend-every effort to crush it, now that she has learned the last words her father ever uttered with regard to her, were,' Tell her to beware of the German.'  Emma only wept; she saw plainly to make a full ac- knowledgment would be of no avail. Therefore she remained silent., At length she spoke-: "Do you think, mother, that these impulses of the heart can be controlled, or rather, guided by our will, and forced into different channels?" 'Yes, sometimes, I suppose." Yet even while the parent spoke, her thoughts wandered off to the past, when many of her intimate friends raised objections to the youth of her choice, because he was so "sober and grave," and shaking their heads ominously, prophesied that he would " crush her flow of spirits and make an  &#xD;<pb n="286-287" xml:id="VAC7466-00000144"/> 288        a   BBARTLETT: OR, old woman of her in a few years." Still, forsaking all others, she had chosen to cleave unto him. And then, too, she remembered how cloudless had been the years of her wedded life. How often she had had reason to return thanks to Heaven for providing her that ark of safety, and permitting her to rest undisturbed in its shadow. "I believe, Emma, this was the reason your dear father so often said, not to urge you; to let your heart guide you in this matter, providing the object upon which you bestowed it, was worthy of the precious boon." "What was the reason?"  Ah, I forgot myself! I was thinking. But never mind, dear. All I have to say," she went on, rising and laying both hands solemnly on her daughter's head, "is, that if ever this warm, trusting heart of yours, bestows its wealth of affection on any one, may he be all a fond parent ean desire." And with this she pressed the weep- ing girl close to her bosom, imprinting, as she did so, a warm, loving kiss upon her brow Emma sobbed convulsively. "He is worthy of me, more than worthy," a voice within kept repeating, yet her lips dared not give utterance to what she felt.   PREJIPCToi AND FANTWACISM.  CHAPTER XXIV. MR. DARE'S PARTING     CALL.

From the apartment in which the little group was gathered, not an article of furniture had been removed, for the house had been rented, ready furnished. It was only from the study- and sleeping apartments, that little sacred mementoes had been taken to preserve. Emma and- Kate sat silently thinking, while their elders conversed in subdued tones. The front-door bell rang, and a moment afterward Lena announced Mr. Dare. Emnma did not move; she had heard neither the bell, nor the servant. "Emma, love!" said Mrs. Bartlett, rising and approaching her. What- is it, mother?" she asked, arousing, herself. "Mr. Dare wishes to see you." "Mr. Dare!" she repeated; starting slightly, "Must  I go in, mother?"  "You had better, dear; don't be. ash," she added- in a low tone: " remember your father's words." --- Emma looked appealingly toward- Kate, as she pre- pared to leave the room. The latter: answered the look with a significant glance, and, when the door: cosed; on -her coUsin's retreating form, and her' mother an; aut F ;   PREJUDICE AND FANATICISM.-     289 resumed their conversation, she arose and noiselessly made her exit through the door leading into the hall. A close observer might have detectced a gleam of tri- umph in the visitor's eye as Emma Bartlett came for- ward to greet him. He had been not a little piqued on receiving a cold and decided refusal once, and had resolved that his second proposal should meet with a more favorable reception. For this purpose he had denied himself the pleasure of being accepted until the evening of their stay. He felt confident an affirmative answer would this time be given, for he was aware Emma possessed an independent spirit, and would not care to throw herself on the charity of her friends. Beside, the feelings of jealousy Mr. Sundahl's last remarks had excited had died out; for, portionless as Emma was, he felt sure her mother would never con- sent to her union with a poor clerk, depending on a meager salary for a support; and, aside from this, he imagined his German origin would be a serious objection, and he had every reason to believe Emma would unite herself to no one without her mother's full approbation. With these convictions he opened the subject on the evening in question with but little undue ceremony. That she did not love him he knew, for she had not been backward in informing him of the fact; but as to this loving, it was a "mnere matter of fancy after all; enough of that would come afterward," he said to himself. 25  &#xD;<pb n="290-291" xml:id="VAC7466-00000146"/> 21      '"EMMA BARTLET:T O,- - When, therefore, the all-important question was again propounded, he was wholly unprepared for the same calm, decided refusal that had greeted his ear on a for- mer occasion. In vain he warned her to reflect before she thlrew away this last opportunity of sharing his hand and fortune, in vain he reminded her, (just as he. had Rosalie before her,) how- pleasant it would be to have a home to which she could invite the one she so dearly loved, and there administer to her every comfort.  The young girl was inflexible; she felt that she could not consent to force her lips to utter a promise at which her lheart revolted. All lihe could effect was to exact from her a promise that she would allow him to visit her in her Sonuthern horne in the course of six months, and then for the last tilne learn her final deci- sion. Even this privilege would have been denied him, had she not remembered her mother's words, "Don't be rash, dear."' While this scene was being enacted .below, Kate saat in her chamber alone, occasionally starting from her seat with a gesture of impatience. Suddenly she sprang to her feet, exclaiming, as- she paced the room several times, "(I can't stand it any longer! he's had time enough to have said it all!

"O! I beg pardon! ' she exclaimed, with admirable naivete, looking the picture of astonishment on seeing the parlor occupied. 'What an unceremonious intru- der I am!" she added, turning as though to retrace her steps. "Come back, cousin Kate; I'm sure Mr. Dare will consider your company quite an acquisition, for I am exceedingly dull this evening." "Not exactly that," returned Dare, in a confused manner; "but Miss Mitchell's presence is certainly desirable whenever' she -sees fit to honor her friends with it." Kate bowed. "If those be your sentiments, gallant sir, I will remain, to prove to you that your compli- ment was- not thrown away;" and she seated herself as she spoke. Dare was provoked, and he took little pains to dis- guise his feelings. However, an approving smile from her cousin, made it all right with Kate. Turning to Emma, he asked if she would favor him with a song.  &#xD;<pb n="292-293" xml:id="VAC7466-00000147"/> SSA dEMMA BASTLES: - 06, Miss Bartlett begged to be excused, without assign. ing any reason for her refusal. "If he has neither discrimination nor tact enough to know that it would be painful in the extreme for me to move those strings, and thus to call forth a host of :tender memories on this last evening I will ever spend at home, he don t deserve an explanation. A moment's Consideration ought to suggest to him how trying it would be to pass my fingers over the keys so soon after dear father's death. I have always believed, and I do still, that-he is destitute of the finer feelings that a rightly cultivated mind possesses." While Emma soliloquized thus, Kate had begun a spirited attack upon their guest. The cousin did not hear the remarks that had aroused Kate's ire. The first sentence that arrested her attention was,'"Yes, sir, there is even a greater difference between the edu- cated and ignorant classes of Germans than between Americans. You acknowledge that, don't you?" "Well, yes; though they all -Seem to murder our language pretty much in- the same way, when they first begin to speak it.

Dare had an inimitable faculty of mimicking, and, des. pite her efforts to the contrary, Kate could not refrain from a hearty laugh. Emma did not join in their mer. riment; she could not; she felt his jesting was ill-timed, and much as she usually enjoyed a joke, this failed to bring a smile to her features. An hour later, Emma sat alone in her chamber, with pen, ink, and paper before her. She was going to write to Roderic; it was her first letter, and might be her last. He had been absent nearly a month, and would probably be back by the time another moon had risen and set. She would leave the letter in the office there for him, and not run the risk of sending it. With a quivering hand she wrote the words, "Dear Roderic," and then came a wild burst of feeling that for a time unnerved her. Again she grew calm, and the moments flew unheeded by: still she wrote, allowing her heart to dictate what it would. So absorbed was she, Kate's step was unheard vhen she entered the room, and seated herself by the window, where, pressing her hand hard against her forehead, she tried to still the tumult within. Although the younger of the two, Emma found this a less difficult task than her cousin. She had been reared and educated in the North, where the female mind is much more rigidly disciplined than in the South, where I   PREJUDICE AND FANATICISM.     295 the feelings are allowed to effervesce without restraint. We can. see the effect of this strict, careful training in the Yankee women, as we term them, who leave their homes and journey to all parts of the Union, to earn their own livelihood; to rely upon tlemselves, to exercise the self-control they learned at their mother's knee, and thus become qualified for greater usefulness in later life. We have a warm corner in our heart for the South, and her gallant sons; but they, like ourself, have their weak- nesses. We once heard a proud Southerner, with whom "pride of family, and wealthy connexions," seemed a favorite hobby, say, sneeringly, that, during one year, over three hundred young ladies had been imported from one of the New England States to different parts of the South, as teachers and governesses. We agreed with him, that it was an underhand piece of business, in those who sent that number for the purpose of secretly instil- ling into the minds of the youth, anti-slavery notions, and our private opinion was, that those zealous " philan- thropists" would find an ample field of labor in which to exercise their excessive benevolence, if they would just devote themselves to home missions; but, when our Southern brother spoke contemptuously of the females, themselves, and termed the noble sacrifices they made, for the purpose of maintaining themselves, and perhaps assisting the loved-ones at home, " masculine prefer-  &#xD;<pb n="296-297" xml:id="VAC7466-00000149"/> 29$8      EMMA BARTLETT: OR,  enees," we needed nothing further to convince us, that he was incapable Of appreciating the disinterested motives that actuated them. An hour passed away, and as Emma folded her letter a few stray beams from the lamp before her fell on some- thing in her cousin's hand. -While Kate's dark eye was fixed upon this, Emma's hand glided through her own sunny curls, and dissevering one from its sisters, she laid it in the missive, then moistening the envelop she pressed it together. This accomplished, she turned to make some preparations for the morrow, but on discover- ing her cousin she hastened to her side. "Why, Katie dear, I did not know you were here," she began; then perceiving the miniature, she delicately drew back. "Come here, Emma, and bring the lamp," said her cousin, in a voice husky with emotion. Emma obeyed. "Is it his picture?" she asked, kneeling down by her side. Kate did not reply, but concealing one part of the daguerreotype with her hand, she pointed to the other. "Roderic!" burst from Emma's lips, as she started back.  "How came you with this?" A  faint smile played over Kate's features, as slie removed her hand and pointed again. ai He had sev- eral taken alone, but this was much the best, and I preferred it, both on that account, and because I knew ,i- ,   PREJUDICE AND FANATICISM.     297' you were so eautious you would be afraid to' carry one concealed about your person.

Kate, Kate," said Emma, without noticing her remark, "we are idolators, all of us! What heart ia it that has not its shrine before which it kneels in ado- ration ?

"Were you to lose him, Emma, think you you could still place your reliance in your heavenly Father, and bow to the stroke without murmuring? " "O yes," was the reply, while a holy confidence illuminated those beautiful features. "It would cost a struggle, though; and you have but to ask your own heart, to know how severe would be the trial. But I would not- allow myself , to brood over my sorrow; I never have done so.

" He deceived your mother, innocent girl that she was, and now comes pretending to be a gentleman, and tries to coax his own daughter to marry him, for what all I know. He comes often enough for that anyhow." Lena paused abruptly, reminded, when too late, of:the dreadful consequences that might follow this revelation, by the death-like pallor of the features before her. Yet Emma neither fainted nor shrieked, but standing immov- able as a statue, her large, full eyes riveted on the servant's face, she asked in a low, hollow whisper, " Does he know he is my father ? " "No, indeed ! your mother became his victim before Providence directed her steps to our door; I can not tell how. God forgive me if I have done wrong in saying this, but I have always been so afraid the villain would carry you off." Still Emma did not move.

"And they know nothing of it?" she inquired for the first time, moving her head in the direction of the door. "  No; they do not dream of such a thing; not a soul." Emma!" cried Kate, from'the top of the stairs, " the carriage is waiting; why don't you come?" "In a moment," she replied in a slightly tremulous voice. Then concealing the picture about her persons - she grasped Lena's extended hand, and with a scarcely articulate "Good-by," and "God bless you," she hurried away. "Why, daughter, how pale you are!" exclaimed Mrs. Bartlett, as Emma ascended the steps of the carriage that was to convey them to the depot. "Do not let this parting from home overcome you. Be brave for my sake! "I'll try, mother!" was the reply, in a quivering voice. O  ! the bitterness of the hour succeeding that revela- tion! Life seemed almost insupportable to the young creature. Years ago, when she first learned that the dear ones who had lavished their affections upon her, were not her parents, she had felt a load of grief at her heart, such as never before had oppressed it. Then her foster-mother had soothed her, gently, and had carefully concealed from her all the circumstances connected with her birth. As Lena had said, Mrs. Bartlett had wished Emma to look upon her husband and herself as the only ones who had a right to call ha 4dughter; and when one    PREJUDIICE AND FANATICISM.      t0o day a visitor, an old friend of the family, inadvertently referred to her adoption, in her presence, the poor child for a time seemed heart-broken. Yet the information she had that morning gained, was more intensely painful than her first sorrow had been; and worst of all she must bear it alone; for, to reveal what Lena had told, to her mother, would only add to , the grief then pressing upon her. Then her thoughts flew off to her lover. "I must give him up forever, now; he knows I am not the daugh- ter of them that reared me, for I told him that; but of my parentage he does not dream. He would shrink from me if he did. How kind, how good he is! 'Tis hard to think of losing him. It would have been better had I not left that letter; I never spoke so freely to him as I wrote last night. We could have been happy together; but alas, the dream is over. Dear Roderic, farewell. You will be mine above." A few rebellious tears welled up from their source, and dewed her cheek) others would have followed, but she forced them back, Finally her thoughts turned to Dare, and all the resent; ment, all the ill-feeling a nature like her's was capable of possessing, were aroused as she pondered. A visible agitation swept over her as she put the question to her- self: ", What if I had consented to become his?"

It was a mystery then, but she understood all now; and though awakened to the fearful certainty that Roderic could never be her's, the knowledge she had obtained also put it into her power to spurn any advances that might in future be made, by one whose name she now loathed. From her uncle's family, as well as from her mother, she would carefully guard her secret; if communicated to the for." mer it might change their feelings toward her, and the latter was too deeply concerned in her happiness to treat the matter with indifference .While Emma mused thus, the other occupants of the carriage remained silent, all apparently communing with their own thoughts. - Once only had the silence been broken. Mr. Mitch. ell, who had seen but very little of his niece, after regarding her attentively for a time, had turned to Mrs. Bartlett with the remark, (I have seen a face just like Emma's somewhere, and have been trying to ecollect the person to whom it belongs, but I can re. iethe r nothing, except that I have seen some person she resembles."

She sat alone- in her berth, and, by the dim light cast from the chandelier in the ladies' cabin, she was gazing at something she held carefully in her hand.  At the slightest noise or sound of an approaching footstep, the young girl hastily concealed the treasure in her bosom, then, as the echo died away, she would draw it from its hiding-place, and continue her steadfast gaze. Once,. in her trepidation, it slipped from her fingers-and fell to the floor. As she stooped to pick it up, she per- ceived that the picture had become loosened from the case, and fallen partly out. On trying to readjust it, she noticed a small piece of paper, carefully folded, fas- tened to one corner. She touched it; it evidently con- tained something. She removed it from  its hiding place, and unfastened the string with which it was bound. She unfolded it with a feeling akin to rever- ence; for had not a mother's touch hallowed the sacred relic? With increasing agitation, the paper was laid open; a golden tress fell out. She laid it on her hand, gazed at it a moment, pressed it to her lips, and then, unbinding her own sunny tresses, laid it beside them. "Just alike," she murmured, "I scarce can tell-it from my ownn." A slight noise startled her;'gathering all up hastily, she placed them r under the pillow, and sat down to compose herself. Presently all was still again, and as her-eye happened to rest upon the carpet, she espied the paper that had contained.. the tress. She  &#xD;<pb n="308-309" xml:id="VAC7466-00000155"/> O80       EMMA BARTLETT: ORB picked it up. There was writing upon it.+ Bending eagerly toward the light, she fixed her eyes upon it, with the hope of learning something more- But alas! the characters were unintelligible to' her, written, as they were, in German. "O! what would I not glve to make out just a lit- tle - only one single word -her name; what was it? Why did I not think to ask. Lena that?" Turning the paper over, she looked wistfully at the termination; there was a word apart from the rest, and evidently the signature, but the letters were strange, and she could not make them out. She counted themn. "Seven," she said, "just the number his name contains." As she spoke, she arose, and with a sigh restored the ring- let to its resting-place; then as she held the picture in one hand, with the other she drew from her bosom a small locket, touched a secret spring, and held it up open to the light. There they were, the counterparts of the two, who had been all in all to each other in the years that had flown by. Little thought the gazer, who was the daughter of the -one, and the affianced bride of the other, that the soft spiritual eyes which even then seemed to look lovingly in her face, had ever veiled their liquid light beneath their silken lashes, when -the dark orbs of her Roderic had rested on those features. Little dreamed she that his fingers had ever wandered through those sunny ringlets, or that his lips had ever touched-the soft white hand half concealed by   PREJUDICE AND FANATICISM.     830 bolds of drapery. And, had those crimson lips parted, to assure her that vows of eternal constancy had passed between the originals of those lifeless pictures, sooner would she have doubted her senses than have believed. Placing these representatives of the living and the dead side by side, she gazed from one to the other. "Roderic," she murmured, as her eye rested on his, "we will meet again. In the bright Heaven above you will be mine." Then turning her gaze to the other, she said, "my mother! my beautiful, misguided pa- rent, if ere this thy weary spirit has found the haven of rest, if ever thou art permitted to visit the loved ones below, O! mayest thou wander down the aisles of light, and spread thy guardian wings around thy child; thus forming a shield impregnable to the shafts of the Evil One." And even while she prayed, the answer, came. Though she knew it not, a presence was near; a spirit hovered o'er her; and as its snowy wings encir- cled her, an angel's eye was turned to the image of hiti she adored; a seraphic bosom filled with a holy joy, a shining countenance radiant with a heavenly smile. And though she heard it not, a voice from the angelic choir breathed softly in her ear, "I am with thee, my daughter."  &#xD;<pb n="310-311" xml:id="VAC7466-00000156"/> 810     .

But others have reached this spot before us. See! there are the outlines of two forms; but we need have no fear; they are our old, friends Roderic and Karl, who, having succeeded in- proving the latter's identity, and in recovering the old homestead, (provided either the inheritor or his heirs make their home there,) are all ready to sail on the morrow, and this evening have come to make a parting visit to Rosalie's tomb. Though Karl is not allowed to sell .the property he had hoped might make him independent, he is neither hopeless or sad; for Roderic, noble and self-sacrificing as he is, has assured him that if on his return, his suit should be favorably received, and his chosen one should be unwil- ling to accompany him to a foreign land-why then he, Roderic, would part with his own home, the old family mansion, every portion of which was- endeared to him from association, and remitting him the proceeds would allow Karl to appoint him his heir, and take possession of the homestead of the Huttens. It would indeed be hard for him to give up the home of his forefathers, but he would relinquish even that to advance the hap- piness of one- he had promised to watch over and care 27  &#xD;<pb n="314-315" xml:id="VAC7466-00000158"/> 3s^%.    }EMMA BARTLETT: OR, for. And then could Emma become his own, why what mattered it where they dwelt? Her presence would make him an Eden anywhere, and to see her airy form flitting through the old halls and along the galleries her mother's feet had trodden, would be a pleasant sight. 'Twould seem like Rosalie's self! Listen! Roderic is speaking.  "My heart is strangely soft to-night, Karl. There is a tender feeling about my bosom that quite unmans me. I've been thinking of the absent and the lost ones, and as I thought, their images seemed blended into one, and I could not distinguish which name she bore. Have I been dreaming since we sat here?" "I don't know," said Karl, looking up. "It was a pleasant illusion, at least. Rosalie and Emma seemed mingled in one, and that one smiled sweetly on me. Perhaps my fair pupil was thinking of me at the time. I believe kindred spirits act upon e' each other, even when far away. Did you ever wonder, Karl, why Emma was so like the departed one whose ashes rest beside us?" Roderic took the young man's hand in both his as he spoke. "I never thought there, could be any cause for the resemblance," was the reply. "Or wonder," continued the other, " when I told you I had another object in view than seeking you in jour- neying to America,-what it was?

"Yes, that seemed incomprehensible to me, but why do your ask?" "Karl, Karl Hutten," he said, rising and retaining his hands, " you had a sister once, almost too beautiful for earth.

"Yes, 'twas grief that killed her; but you must for- get that, and only remember that if she were yet with us, she would entreat you to spare your hand, as I have done. But my other reason for crossing the ocean-  'twas to search for the child.

TAKING into consideration the facilities for traveling, in this progressive age, our party had a somewhat tedious journey; a fortnight passed away before they reached their destination. The great Eye of Day had traversed its accustomed rounds, now sending its beams to dissolve the snow- flakes still lingering on the Northern hills, now diffusing warmth into the fallow earth from whence a few early Southern plants had ventured to burst, preferring unin- tercepted light and warmth to the prison-house that had held them, and now transforming the smooth, glittering surface of the shallow, frost-bound Western streams into a transparent fluid; this Eye had become weary of its constant gaze,'and was now closing dreamily, and appa- rently sinking to slumber in the arms of a snowy cloud, just as the carriage that had been procured at F--, to convey them to the plantation, neared the gate that led into the avenue.

"Do you really love her, Kate?" asked Emma, won., dering at the great interest her cousin took in the negro. "To be sure I do," returned Kate, warmly. "She's been like a mother to me, all my life." A  few moment's drive brought them to the house. Emma stood   close beside her, mother as they dis- mounted. The many   black aces: and shining eyes peering at her, made her flinch a little. Wishing to evade their scrutinizing glances she looked around: "What a  lovely spot," she exclaimed, mentally, "I did not dream Deerwood was half so beautiful. Why, it looks like a miniature city, with all these houses," she contin- ued, running her eyes all along the rows of negro cabins.

There was an air of neatness in the room they entered, Emma had not expected to see. A good Grag carpet covered the floor ; in one corner stood a bureau, on which was a clock, and in the other was a table cov- - ered with little trinkets, "' the gifts of the ladies who had, at different times, visited at' the house."'  Over these was carefully spread some, white ghze, the re- mains of one of Kate's party dresses, which had been, as was all her cast-off finery, handed over to her nurse. But- not long did these things engage Emma's atten- tion. In the center of the room stood a bed, perfectly clean in appearance, on which lay the old negro, prop- ped up by pillows. Kate was bending over her; one jeweled hand supported the aged sufferer's head, while the other lay clasped in both hers. Aunt Milly did not notice the entrance of the two; all her thoughts were concentrated on her "young   PREJUDICE AND FANATICISM.      825 mist'ess."

O! it was a beautiful sight, and one upon which the angels might well have smiled.  Emma stood trans- fixed with wonder and admiration.  Never had she dreamed that such depth of affection existed between the two races, and she felt silently rebuked, as she gazed, for something within told her that she would have shrunk from so close contact with one of a differ- ent color. Noiselessly Mr. Mitchell approached. "Make way, my daughter," he said, in a whisper, gently pushing Kate aside.  "Aunt Milly, do you know me?"

Aunt Milly sank back exhausted, and long after she ceased speaking, the two stood there gazing sorrowfully on her shriveled features. Emma stood a silent ob- server, until Bob's step startled her.

"Please excuse me, pa; I'd rather remain here." " As you like, my love," he returned. " Come, Ems ma; or if you prefer it, remain with your cousin till I return," and with that Mr. Mitchell passed out.

"Well, aunt Milly, what shall it be?" asked Kate, rejoiced to do anything that would prevent her talking in her weak state. "De psalm dat begins, De Lord is my Shepherd.'" Kate drew a small table to the bedside, placed a light upon it, and shading it with her handkerchief, took the Bible aunt Milly always kept under her pillow, and turning to the 23rd psalm, which she found marked with a bit of ribbon, read it in a clear, distinct voice. "Dat's refreshin'; truly refreshin';" said the negro, as she finished. "Now, honey, ef you only could pray wid your ole aunty, once afore she leaves ye." Kate hesitated, and looked at Emma.

Unconsciously she adopted the language she had heard the good minister use at family worship; gaining courage as she proceeded, she threw all the fer- vor of her young soil into those words; and even before half the thoughts she would have breathed were uttered, the aged negro, carried away by the feelings her impres- sive manner had awakened, clapped her attenuated hands together, and throwing into her voice all the strength she could summon, shouted, "Glory! Hallelu- jah! I'se so happy! I can see de angels! I can hear de music! O! I only wants de wings to fly! Glory, glory! ' Emma arose, her eyes suffused with tears.

DARE'S  VISIT. SUCH a haunting fear oppressed him That the echo of a sound Made him slink among the shadows, And gaze stealthily around. And so strong were his misgivings, They constrained him to depart, With the hope that change would banish This dark terror from his heart. "THE wicked flee when no man pursueth," saith the Proverb, and most strikingly was it exemplified in the case of the merchant Dare. The parting words of the German rang in his ear, and though weeks had flown by without his- crossing his path, still the secret fear that " the Dutch devil" would lay wait for him, and perhaps in an unguarded moment rob him of that life he had up to that moment taken every precaution to preserve, gradually shaped itself into a presentment that haunted, like an incubus, both his sleeping and waking dreams.  This constant dread prevented him from venturing out at night without being accompanied by a friend; or, if compelled to do so, he moved along     PREJUDICE AND FANATCISM.      33 at a hurried pace, a womanly fear seizing him when- ever the slightest noise was heard in his immediate neighborhood. For this reason -he accepted, without hesitation, his father's invitation to accompany him on a visit to Illi- nois, to pass a few weeks with his sister. On arriving at their destination, Mr. Dare was much surprised to see that the village of Brighton had under- gone so little change from the time of his first visit. In so new and thriving a State, he had expected to dis- cover vast improvements, but instead, the town, if at all changed, had performed a retrograde motion, for the dwellings had a more dilapidated look, and no percepti- ble increase in number. "The fact is," said his brother-in-law, in reply to his queries, "the California emigration killed our place; if it had not been for that, we might have had quite a city by this time." But the greatest change Dare perceived was in his sister. The gay, thoughtless girl was not only trans- formed into the calm, sedate woman, but weary years of care, anxiety and manual labor had not passed by without leaving a furrow here and. there on her brow, or a very perceptible bend in her back; without meta- morphosing the once soft, delicate hands on which she had prided herself when a girl, and which her brother had always told her was one of her greatest weaknesses, into those as brown and hard as a day-laborer'.  &#xD;<pb n="334-335" xml:id="VAC7466-00000168"/> 8MX      EMSMA BARTLETT: O, With a family of six children, the two youngest twin babes, all of whom looked to " mother " to supply their numerous wants, besides her household cares, and trh duties of tie wife of a man whose attention -was too much occupied with philanthropic schemes to allow his thoughts to be diverted by the immediate wants of those dependent upon him-she had been obliged to use the most rigid economy, in order to make all ends meet. Her husband had manifested his propensity to "be. come important and rule," by aspiring to fill several of the petty offices of the town; and what with his slim salary, together with the game he brought home from his -weekly hunts, besides what the wife added to the general stock by improving every spare moment with her needle, they had managed to get along after a fashion. The Rev.

Mr. Gardiner, she was sure, would go, for though he knew that neither of the babies was well, and that she- had coughed almost incessantly the previ- ous night, she was sure that nothing could keep him I away from a Know Nothing meeting. It was by the merest accident in the world that. Mrs. Gardiner learned her husband belonged to this " secret order." She had often wondered where he went and stayed so late on a certain night in every week. At -first he had intimated that he had been to a temperance lecture, at anotlher time to an anti-slavery discussion, and on the third at the Odd Fellow's Lodge; but after- a while it got to be an old thing, and he ceased making excuses, and as Nelhe was not one of the ;'storming" kind, he was allowed to pursue the even tenor of his way without remonstrance. Had he told her at first the object of the clique with which he had connected himself, she would not lrave thought of objecting, for, reared as she had been in the school of abolitionism, he could soon have convinced her that a party was needed to enforce their principles,fto stemin all opposition, and declare their indomitable will was law.

Although not in the least meddlesome, a pattern wife and mother, an excellent house-keeper, (as Yankee women generally are), frugal, neat and industrious, still she learned this piece of news, and we will just take time here, reader, to tell you how. Mrs. Jenkins, her neighbor, had been sick, very sick; indeed, her recovery had for many days been considered doubtful. Her devoted spouse had -bent over her pil- low night and day in deep distress on account of her intense suffering, until, on one memorable eve, after she had been pronounced convalescent, he had taken advantage of a moment when she slept, and had hur- ried over to Mrs. Gardiner's to beg her to spend an hour- or two with the invalid. He had some very urgent business to transact, which, if neglected, might result in great personal loss. Mrs. Gardiner signified her willingness to comply, provided her husband were wil- ling to remain at home and take care of the children. He i-neighbor did - not eem fullyatisfied-: ith -her -   PREJUDICE AND FANATICISM.      337 provision, and ventured to suggest that if Mr. Gardi- ner, or " the 'Squire," as he called him, couldn't con- veniently stay, he would send their Sally Ann over to see to the little folks.               - To this the mother agreed; and it was well for him- self that Mr. Jenkins had thought of this arrangement, for had i" the 'Squire " been consulted, he could not pos- sibly have remained; it would have been entirely out of the question. When the neighbor went in, the sick woman was inter- rogating her daughter Sally about her father's wherea- bouts. The girl didn't know where he went; ' pap never told her." She informed her mother, howeyer, that " pap had said, that Mrs. Gardiner would stay there until he came back; " and then, on seeing that lady, she hurried off to the adjoining abode, to " see that Prudy and Tempy didn't wake up while mother was gone." Mrs. Jenkius put the same question to her neighbor that her daughter had failed to answer, and Mrs. Gardi- ner informed her that the absconded   spouse had requested -her to come in and sit till his return, which would be at the earliest opportunity. Urgent business compelled him to absent himself a while. "Urgent business!" cried Mrs. Jenkins, her piercing black eyes flashing as she spoke (she was one of the fire and tow kind). "Urgent business, indeed! it's them sneaking Know Nothings he's after!

Just to think, that he is willing to risk my life in the hands of a jackass, because he's one of the secret clique, who go prowling about at night, in cellars and garrets, and goodness knows where else, like so many sheep-thieves. I tell you, Mrs. Gardiner, it is too much for any one woman to bear!" and the speaker looked the picture of an injured wife. "When he comes back he shall have a piece of my mind; see if he dont. The Dr. will be with him maybe, and I dont care if he is. I'll speak my mind once before I die; and that I know I'll have to do, if that green- horn continues his gas-baths, and forty other ridiculous things. It is my opinion he is a puff of gas himself, and will evaporate, tetotally, one of these days." Utterly exhausted, Mrs. Jenkins became silent, and, with her emaciated fingers, wiped the indignant tears from her eyes. The neighbor thought by this time that Prudy or Tempy might be awake, so she just stepped over to see how Sally was getting along. As we have said before, she was not a meddlesome woman, and, of all things dis- liked playing the part of listener, when two of one flesh disagreed. She, therefore, made it a point to avoid the domestic storm, when, an hour later, she heard approach- ing footsteps, by beating a hasty retreat. As the cautious   PREJUDICE AND FANATICISM.     838 husband softly opened the front-door, she effected her escape through the back portal; yet, ere she could close it behind her, she caught the words, "A pretty time of night, this, Mr. Sneakabout, to be coming home from -."  The good neighbor was out of hearing ere the sentence was completed. Scarcely had she seated herself by the cradle ere her own philanthropic spouse made his appearance; but not a word did she dare utter to him, having learned by sad experience, that a word of censure from her was some-  thing he did not allow; " he had no notion of subjecting himself to petticoat government." So the wife locked her secret in her bosom, and wisely kept silence. S It was a month previous to her relatives' arrival that the above occurred; on the evening to which we have referred, as she stood washing up the tea-things and rocking the cradle with her foot, Mrs. Jenkins, who had recovered despite her asseverations to the contrary, came in with her knitting to chat a while. "Your friends have come," she said, drawing out her work. "I wouldn't have ventured over this evening, but Sally Ann told me she saw them go down street with the 'Squire, and I thought maybe you'd be alone." Mrs. Gardiner said " she was glad to have company, for she didn't expect the gentlemen home till late." "Well, I'm just in yeur fix;" said Mrs. Jenkinq. "Ephraim, yeu know, is gone too.

But he can't ogle round me in that way; I wont be still" "Why are you so violently opposed to the society, Mrs. Jenkins?" "Why, because I don't think they are right. I don't approve of their principles. Now, I'm nothing but a poor, weak woman, as the lords of creation call us fe- males, and I don't possess the power of reasoning to any great extent, but this much I do know, that as warm, true hearts emigrate from other countries as our own America can boast. I am a native of Columbia, and of course feel proud of it, but I don't forget that my mother was Irish. It is true, most of her life was spent in this country, but her eye would always spar- kle, and her face would glow with animation, when her thoughts wandered off to the home of her childhood, and to the day of her death she could not hear the song, ' There came to the beach a poor Exile of Erin,' without wiping the tears from her eyes. When I think of all this, it's enough to vex me for Ephraim to per- sist in going with that 'set.' I most candidly believe, Mrs. Gardiner, that this movement will cause more   PRBEUDICB ANTD FBANAISM.     41 'family breezes' than any thing that was ever gotten up.

"You can't certainly understand their motives, Mrs. Jenkins, or you wouldn't feel so. Their cause must really be a good one, and one every American should feel himself in duty bound to espouse, or my father, who is a minister, would never countenance it." "I agree with you, Mrs. Gardiner, that the good and noble-minded of our land may be actuated by the purest motives in taking this step, without foreseeing the con- sequences; without pausing to think to what an extent the unprincipled and power-seeking who attach them- selves to the party may carry it, or into what excesses they may run. I believe there are men in our Union who have as inordinate a desire to become rulers, to wield the scepter of authority over their fellow-men, as any that may be found in the Old World. I sometimes think there are few of us who would not abuse certain prerogatives if we only had the power. For instance, myself. There's Ephraim insists on being a warm friend of 'Sam's,' as they call it, while I desire that he should let' Sam alone.

"You are better versed in this matter than I am," said Mrs. Gardiner, smiling. "I understand it a good deal better than I can ex- press myself. Yeu see, my last resort has been to read the newspapers, every thing I can get my hands on, and in that way I keep posted so as to be prepared to carry on a dispute with Ephraim. He told me this morning I was a ' perfect team' to argue, and offered me a quarter to hush. "But as I remarked," she went on, after stopping to pick up a " drop stitch " which, in the heat of her argu- ment, had taken the opportunity to slip from her nee- dle, " there are many noble-minded -men among  the set. We had an example of that right here in town, at the trial yesterday; the one between Abram  Skin- flint and the poor German. Now, we both know Skin- flint is a  slippery fellow; at least you ought to, for your husband had trouble enough in settling with him. And what's more, we both know he's a  member of the church, or, as uncle Davy says, 'the church itself,' be- cause he pays the preacher more than the rest.

"I overheard some men talking with Mr. Gardiner yester- day, and they said he did not meet with their ' set.'  "( They probably meant Isaac, his brother; or if Abram don't meet with them, he and the parson probably have a separate lodge to themselves, for if they aint both Know-Nothings to the back-bone I'm greatly mistaken; they may not feel like condescending to meet with the common rabble, and so hold their sessions apart; 'But as I was going to-'say, the first jury summoned was composed of Know-Nothings to a man. The case was something like this. The German had been working for Skinflint for several months and had opened an account at his store. When they came to settle, the workman's bill overbalanced the amount due him for his labor. The German was dissatisfied, and insisted on investigating the matter; lie affirmed, as you know others before him have done, that many of the credits in his favor were missing. When the trial was opened the book-keeper first swore that the credits were correct, and afterward, when they pinned him down, that he had forgotten something. He is young, you know, and did not stop to think how it would sound to give in con- tradictory evidence. Well, the long and short of it is, that the first jury hung, and a second one was sum- moned, all Know-Nothings too, but they were Ameri- cans of the right stamp.

Only I do think, when foreigners come to our shores and peace-  fully settle down among us, make honest, industrious, worthy inhabitants, they should be entitled to the same rights their adopted country guarantees to her native sons. In my opinion it is to the freedom of her institu- tions, and the privileges the Constitution guarantees to all who come, that the present prosperity of our Union is to b- attributed. Of course all who come are not patterns of excellence; but should those who are truly worthy be avoided or treated as strangers, simply be-   PREJUDIOE AND FANATICISM.

"And another thing: why on earth are they making such a terrible hellibaloo about foreigners at this time of day? Now if any person were to drop down from the Moon or any-other planet out of our hearing, he would suppose, on hearing this continual clamor, that a cargo of foreigners had for the first time landed on our shores. It would never occur to him that these people had been among us since our Union was first formed; or that, during,the Revolution, the patriots who fought so bravely in the cause of freedom were both foreign and native born, and no man paused to inquire whence another came. He wouldn't think that these adopted citizens had been increasing ever since, manifesting a common interest in our country's welfare. I say, he wouldn't dream of such a thing. I told Ephraim that this morning, and he never even opened his mouth to deny it. He didn't know, though, that I got my idea out of an anti-Know-Nothing speech uncle Davy lent me yesterday." The neighbor paused to give Mrs. Gardiner a chance to say something, but if that lady had any objections to offer she did not' give them utterance. After a brief silence Mrs. Jenkins asked, "Of what denomination is your father a minister?"  &#xD;<pb n="346-347" xml:id="VAC7466-00000174"/> 836       EMMA BARTLETT: OR, "Of the -- church," was the reply. "The same Skinflint belongs ,to! Well, I only wish some members of that faith would come and settle down among us, who would show by their works that they really are Christians! That Skinflint has cast a reproach upon the church here; the people have lost all confi- dence in him, and I dont believe it ever will flourish, when such persons as he are the chief pillars. I believe parson Bruce does what he conceives to be right; but then, as uncle Davy says, he never hears of any of Skin- y flint's proceedings, and, of course, wouldn't turn him oug without cause. Did you ever hear the good parson talk on the subject of slavery?" "Yes, often." "Aint he a real fanatic; a perfect monomaniac on that point?" Mrs. Jenkins had, at last, struck against a breaker. Her neighbor did not hesitate an instant to express her opinion now. "He's not a whit too zealous, Mrs. Jenkins. -He la- bors in a good cause, and the Lord will prosper his efforts." "Why, really, my friend, I beg pardon!" Was not aware that you held to those views!

"To be sure I was; I lived several years in Kentucky, before I was married." "And were not your feelings daily outraged by seeing the cruelty and oppression to which the poor blacks were subjected? ' "No," returned her neighbor, laughing. "Your ques- tion convinces me that but a small portion, if any, of your days were spent in the South." "We lived a short time in Missouri before we came here." "And do tell me, Mrs. Gardiner, did you see any of this cruelty of which you speak?" "Well, no, not exactly," she replied, after some hesi- tation; "-but I heard of it. How they were tied up, like wild beasts, and whipped till the blood ran." "Where?  Where did this happen?" asked Mrs. Jenkins, with an incredulous smile. "Why, down South, where there are a great many more slaves than in Missouri." "Exactly," returned her neighbor, patting her foot and looking the very picture of incredulity.

"And aside from my conscientious scruples," she went on, "if I were obliged to live in the South, it would keep me in a perfect 'stew' all the time. I couldn't bear to have those nasty black creatures about me. Ugh!" "The good Lord made us all, neighbor; and I don't think we should so despise them on account of their color." "No, nor oppress them either," interposed the now interested friend. "There's just the point." "What would you have done, then?" "Why, send them all to their own country." "And who would defray their expenses? Surely not the Southerners, for they would sustain loss enough in giving up their property." "Property! how that word sounds, applied to human beings!

That the Yankee boys are *" some," IT was quite late when the gentleman returned. Mrs. Gardiner, wearied from her day's labor, together with the unusual excitement of meeting her friends, after putting the spare chamber in - perfect order, had disrobed herself, and laying her babes beside her, had yielded to the drowsiness that overpowered her. Hav- ing slept little the night before, she soon sank into a heavy slumber, which the entrance of the trio did not disturb. "Why, Ellen! in bed already i" said the husband, in a tone indicative of displeasure. "It seems to me you might have waited till we came."  Seeing that his words failed to arouse her, he advanced toward the bed, for the purpose of waking her. i"Donrt disturb her," said the father, laying his hand on Gardiner's arm, "she looks badly."   PREJUDICE AND FANATICISM.      851 The care-worn features of his child, so death-like as she slept, had awakened in the father's bosom a keen sense of pity. ( She hasn't been well for a week or two," said the husband, by wav of apology, as he turned aside. "But come, sit down by the stove for a little while before you retire; it is chilly for a Spring evening." The father and brother obeyed, and drawing their chairs closely together, began conversing in a low tone. Put the sleeper, whom neither approaching footsteps nor the sound of familiar voices had disturbed, was sud- denly aroused to consciousness by the gentlest move- ment in the world; one so slight as not'to be heard by the group around the fire. Yet, unnoticed as it was, the mother's heart perceived it. The little one on her arm stirred, and with the quickness of a magnetic flash, the beautiful love-angel, that continually keeps watch in a mother's bosom while she slumbers, unlocked the golden gates of dream-land, and gliding noiselessly to the- windows of her soul, looked out. Very tenderly was the tiny form drawn closer, and as the velvet cheek was pressed to her bosom, she was again sinking to slumber, when the murmur of voices attracted her ear. Her father's was the first she dis- tinguished. It seemed so natural, so like old times to hear it again! She wanted to turn her head and speak to him, but the babe seemed uneasy, and she must be careful and not rouse it. Next her brother's voice was  &#xD;<pb n="352-353" xml:id="VAC7466-00000177"/> 852      EMMA BARTLETT: OR,  recognized,. Who was that gentleman with black whiskers and a little bald?  The one who officiated when the new members were installed?" "That was General Mephistopheles, and a very zeal- ous, member he is, too; ready to go to any lengths. He is not a very popular man here; folks say he will stoop to do very small things, but people, you know, will talk sometimes just to hear themselves." "Your minister was not there!  How does that happen?   Don't your ministers here in Illinois medt with the people? I believe you said yours was a friend of Sam's." "Yes, indeed, but I don't just know what his reasons are for keeping himself aloof. Neither he nor Abram Skinflint meet with us, though I'm sure they will both vote our ticket out and out at the election. Many of our brethren think General Mephistopheles is governed entirely by their directions; in other words, is their tool." "Who was the tall, thin man they initiated to-night? . "That was Benjamin Cadaverous, the strongest pro- slavery man in our community.  Now, I'm opposed to admitting such persons as he, for I think this great movement and abolitionism should go hand in hand." "And so it will after a while; there's the policy of getting these pro-slavery men in. You are not posted. I must enlighten you," and Dare, Jr., prepared forth- with to explain.   PR1EJUDICE AND FANATICISM.     868 "But -I can't see how the enlisting of their forces first; will render it easier to conquer afterward." "Why, my son, here's the point," began the Rever- end, forestalling Dare, Jr.'s forthcoming speech, to that individual's evident discomfiture, " it is an undisputed fact, that two-thirds of the foreigners who come over vote the Democratic ticket., They have several reasons for this. One is the name. They have always had an idea in their native country, that any thing democratic is opposed to monarchy, and flying, as they are, from the latter, it is but natural that they should attach them- selves to the Locofoco party. Then again, although instinctively opposed to slavery, they feel it to be their duty to respect the laws of the country they have adopted; this the Democrats tell them when they read to them that -clause in our Constitution which says: "No person held in labor or service in one State, under the laws thereof, escaping into another, shall in consequence of any law or regulation therein, be dis- charged from such service or labor; but shall be deliv- ered up on claim of the party to whom such service or labor may be due.' "Now, the Southerners are, and always have been, greatly prejudiced against foreigners, and they take little pains to conceal their aversion; so, don't you see, if we can get them enlisted in this 'great movement' against the latter, they -will -be fighting against their 30  &#xD;<pb n="354-355" xml:id="VAC7466-00000178"/> h4^       EMMA BARTLETT: OF, qwn party?  Impulsive and hot-headed as they are, they will take no pains to hide from the foreigners that they are up in arms against them; and will not the latter, finding those they went hand in hand with be- fore, attaching themselves to an order whose design is to keep them in subjection, in the end turn round and vote with the anti-slavery men? Why, my -son, we want the pro-slavery men to join us; yes, the whole South, if it were possible. It is the only sure way of incensing the foreigners against them, and of forcing the hosts that were wont to enter the Democratic ranks on their arrival, to espouse the right cause at once; to come boldly forward and enlist under the banner of freedom." "But the abolitibnists of the North belong to the 'new party ' too; how then could the foreigners join them? pare, Jr., smiled one of his self-complacent smiles, and while the old gentleman was taking -breath he stole a march on him by replying: "The Southerners don't know this is our design; they are- not as far-seeing as us Yankees, or they would never be caught in such a trap ; you see, brother Gard- iner, we lie perfectly still, make no noise, and let them do the talking. The foreigners, not understanding our game of ( possum,' think we take no sides on the ques- tion, and wishing to escape from those they consider enewies, they fly to our ranlk.   PREJUDICE AND FANATICISM.     855 "Now this is just what we want. Let the South boil up and-effervesce if she will; all the better, we'll be be the gainelrs. All we have to do is to ' lie low' until just before the election, and get all the votes we can. Then will be the time to strike; to throw off our masks, and stepping boldly forward to elect our President." "A capital idea! I see it now! 7! exclaimed Gardiner. "Of course it does not do to explain this to every one; it might reach the pro-slavery men's ears, and we want to keep the dust in their eyes, so that they may do the wind-work. You'll see at the coming Spring elections there will be ten times more fussing in the South than at the North; that's the time they will ex- asperate the foreigners. O! we'll ogle round this hard-headed rebellions people, and the first thing they know, they'll be so completely in our power there will be no way of getting out. Future generations will thank us, if they in their blindness do call us schem- ing, meddlesome, etc., for concocting plans to rid our glorious country of the vile curse of slavery." "Yes, we'll do it," chimed in Dare, Sen., thinking his illustrious son had made a sufficient display of his eloquence to allow him a turn, " we'll elect an anti- slavery President and an anti-slavery Congress, if we can, and vote the South down! it's the only way," and he brought his forefinger down in his emphatic manner, which said as plainly as words, "It must be."  &#xD;<pb n="356-357" xml:id="VAC7466-00000179"/> 356       EMMA BARTLETT: OR, "Won't that be a glorious time!  said Dare, Jr., rising to his full hight,- pulling up his shirt-collar, and assuming an air of importance the interpretation of which was, "Wouldn't I like to fill the Presidential chair, and lord it over them!" Mrs. Gardiner heard no more; drowsiness again overpowered her, and yielding to its influence, she sank into the arms of Morplleus a confirmed Know-Nothing; her father said it was to accomplish the abolition of slavery, and where that great work was involved, she believed with the JReverend gentleman, that " the end justifies the means."

AT an early hour on the following afternoon, the members of the sewing-circle began to drop in. Mrs. Gardiner, who had been hindered with her baking dur- ing the morning by an unusually long crying spell of one of the babes, did not get her clean dress on in time, she was therefore obliged to request her kind neighbor Mrs. Jenkins to receive the company. The three gentlemen had " gone down town to reconnoiter," or in other words that the two visitors might pursue their acquaintance with the brethren they had met on the previous night, and seek an introduction to those who were compelled by sickness and other interferences to absent themselves. As yet no one in the village had openly avowed himself a Know-Nothing; conse- quently many not belonging to the order had been charged with membership, often by the brethren them- selves, who seemed to take particular pains to accuse  &#xD;<pb n="358-359" xml:id="VAC7466-00000180"/> 358      .EMMA BARTLETT: OR, those of being ring-leaders whom they knew were most opposed to the movement. Some said it was for the purpose of irritating their opponents; others to ward suspicion from themselves. "Good afternoon, Patience," said Mrs. Jenkins to a pretty Quakeress, who entered among the first. "How does thee do, friend Rachel," she said, extending her hand; "thee is entirely well again, is thee not?" "Yes, thank you, my health is perfectly restored." "And the family - how are they?  "Reasonably well, I thank you; why did not your sister come?  This is fourth-day; our monthly meeting holds to-day, and they could hardly spare me." How pretty she looked, as she stood untying her neat Quaker hood, and speaking in her simple dialect! With her perfectly plain dress of drab colored delaine, and small India book collar! Her light brown hair was combed back entirely plain, and confined behind by a small comb; yet even this seemed becoming, for it showed off to better advantage the ever-blooming roses on her cheeks. And then there seemed such a soft, mellow light in her laughing blue eyes when she spoke. She made a " pretty picture." Other maidens soon arrived, with their gaudy dresses and flaunting ribbons, but, like the modest violet that springs up beside a bed of flaming poppies, she lost none of her charms by the contrast.   PREJUDICE AND FANATOISM.     3$t It was a full hour before all assembled. Mrs. Smith was the last to make her appearance. She was a large, ecorpulent woman, who came in puffing and blowing, and declaring she was almost out of breath. "I'd almost given out coming!" she said, sinking into a chair, and fanning herself with her sun-bonnet. "But being as it is the last time I'll meet with you, I thought I'd strain a point to come." ' The last time!"cried several voices at once. "Why? where on earth are you going, Mrs. Smith?" "Going to move to Lockport, as soon as Mr. Smith gets well enough; and that, I trust, will be befoi4 another two weeks roll round." "To Lockport! What for?" asked Mrs. Jenkins. "And even if you do," interposed Mrs. Pratt, "you can meet with us still. Lockport isn't over half a- mile from here." "Yes, but it will be too far for me to slip off, as I have been doing." "But why-are-you going?" persisted Mrs. Jenkins. "Because Dr. Catnip says, if we dont move right straight off, my husband will die: he says there is an internal stream of water running right under the house we are living in, and that's what keeps him sick." "What a yarn!" cried Mrs, Jenkins very uncere- moniously. "Didn't the Prices live there for years and years, without haing a  sdy's sickness? Dr. Catnip  &#xD;<pb n="360-361" xml:id="VAC7466-00000181"/> 860     - EMMA BARTLETT: OR, fabbled that up for some purpose, ma}ay   words! Maybe he wants the house himself." "Why, Mrs. Jenkins! How can you talk so about the Doctor, after his raising you from death's door?" "Precious little he had to do with raising me! He took me there, that's certain ; but it was a merciful Provi- dence that brought me back. Why, if I had not posi- tively refused to take his villainous stuff, I'd have been as dead as a door-nail before this. It was all Abram Skinflint's doings. He bragged him up as such great shakes, just because he happened to cure a pain in his great toe." "Have you heard how Skinflint has been acting with the widow Martin, up our way?" asked Mrs. Grey, as she arose to cut out some work for Patience Hargraves. "No, what was it?" asked several, simultaneously. "Some new rascality, I'll warrant," put in Mrs. Jen- kins. "Let us hear it, Mrs. Grey." "Well," began the informant, as she showed Patience how wide to nake the hem, " the night before Martin died, he took his clerk and went over, and when the poor man was lying in a stupor, the hard-hearted wretch weynt up to the bed and shook him, telling him he must have a bill of sale of his property, consisting of cattle, etc." OO! Pshaw! Mrs. Grey, I dont believe it. Why, -Mr. Skinflint is a member of our church!" "Yes, I know he is," said Mrs. Grey, with a leer,   PREJUDICE AND FANATICISM.     8B and what's more, he stopped it the other Sunday, after church, and tried to coax Mrs. Martin to sell him the 'hogs, and wanted to make her believe that if she didn't strike a bargain with him, right then, Dr. Brown would take them every one as soon as her husband died." O! shame, shame!" cried a dozen voices. "And as I was going to say," she went on, " he went there the night before he died, and every time he suo- ceeded in arousing Mr. Martin a little, he would ask him if he mightent have this cow, or that heifer. He kept on that way till 10 or 11 o'clock at night; and Mrs. Martin told me, with her own mouth, that it made her husband delirious, and he kept begging her to let him get up, and go to Skinflint, to have a settlement." "It is perfectly outrageous for as rich a man as he is to act so!" said Mrs. Summers. "He always makes me think of what the Bible says about a camel going through the eye of a needle." 4' Yes, and that's not the worst of it! Mrs. Martin says they dont owe him a cent, because she boarded his work-hands long enough to pay the rent. But you know they say he never keeps credits." "Was it for the rent?" asked Mrs. tSmith, in some alarm. "Why, I'll be afraid to move into his house; for if the Lord should deprive me of my husband, there is no knowing what he might do." "Is it into one of his houses you intend moving;?' asked Mrs. Jenkins, eagerly. 81  &#xD;<pb n="362-363" xml:id="VAC7466-00000182"/> 36532      TF MMA BARTLETT: OR, "Yes, and the very one the widow Martin occupies. He said he wanted us to come right away; to-morrow, if possible ;-said she wouldn't probably move out for a week, but that bur moving in would hurry her.' "Didn't I tell you?" cried Mrs. Jenkins, a light breaking over her features. "Dont you see it, plain as day? Didn't I say he had some design in advising you to move?" "It was Dr. Catnip advised us, though," said Mrs. Smith. W "Well, it's all the same. Dr. Catnip is as much Skinflint's tool as General Mephistopheles is parson Bruce's. It was the easiest thing in the world for him to intimate to Dr. Catnip that he wished you to move into the house up yonder, and push poor Mrs. Martin out. Dont you see?" she asked, letting her scissors fall as she enforced her assertion with an emphatic gesture. "I believe it. I believe it!" cried the now wide awake Mrs. Smith; " because Skinflint promised my husband work as soon as he was able to be about. O! it's awful to think of a professor of religion acting so." "But I didn't get through what I was telling," con- tinued Mrs. Grey, taking a fresh start,. "On the very day Mr. Martin wasg buried, Skinflint went over and had all the cattle driven away to his pasture. When Mrs. Martin found it out, Skinflint told her he had done it to keep Dr. Brown from tating them. The widow seemed to know who was her true friend, so she told the Doctor,   PREJUDICE AND FANATICISM.     863 and he told lawyer Bliss to send up and have them driven right straight back. Well, dont you think, ladies, Skinflint sent and had them taken away again." "Why, I never heard of such proceedings!" said Mrs. Jenkins. "It is the town's talk up there; and every body says, if it was any other member parson Bruce would turn him out of the church, or ' excommunicate him,' as the -parson says. By the way, did you hear his sermon last Sunday on the loss of the Arctic?" "No, I wasn't there; what did -he make of it?" "A dispensation of Providence - -" "( Just the same as the great fire at Harper &amp; Bro's. establishment, a year ago. That, he said, was a judg ment of the Almighty, visited upon them in consequence of the great amount of trash annually issued from their press.

I've heard him say, in a rather disparaging way, that they held to the Methodist doctrine." "I've always looked upon him as a bundle of preju. dice tied together with a string of self-conceit," spoke up Mrs. Jenkins. "I don't know though but a contradiction of terms would be a more appropriate cognomen, for with all his preaching against the vile trash of the Harpers I never in my life saw any one enjoy the wood-cuts more.

But here comes old uncle :Davy; let's call him in. Poor old man! he likes to talk with the women!" "Uncle Davy," as he was familiarly called by almost every one, had not always been the poor cripple they then saw; the time was when he could run as fast as the spriest of them. He was a thick, heavy-set, jolly kind of a creature, but unfortunately learned to love his cups too well; friends had tried in vain to persuade him to abstain, but not until felled by a paralytic stroke was he forced to desist. For a time his life was despaired of, but gradually he regained a partial use of his limbs. and, by the aid of a cane, he was enabled to hobble along, speaking to everybody he met, and stopping wherevbr he was invited. There was one thing throughout all his afflictions uncle Davy never loust that was his merry, ringing laugh; it was a fore- runner of his approach; you might always know when he was coming, for this signal seldom failed to herald his arrival. Uncle Davy was a staunch Democrat, He had been so all his life, and when Whiggery began to be merged into Know-Nothingism, he clung more steadfastly than ever to his party. The old man often informed his friends that he had many failings, but among the num- ber he had always protested " unfair dealings" could not be reckoned; for he "4ad never, to the best of his   PREJUDICE AND FANA4TcSM.     865 recollection, cheated any man out of the first red cent," and nothing seemed to incense him more than to hear of fraud in others. It seems that he, in common with the rest of the vil- lagers, had had good reasons for bringing complaints against the Skinflints for forgetting the credits, and you had only to mention one of these individuals' names, or ask 'him if he were a Know-Nothing, in order to hear him hold forth. When Mrs. Jenkins had remarked that uncle Davy was coming, she had no ocular proof of her assertion. It was his laugh that had caught her ear. On opening the door to invite him in, she heard him say to Deacon Moore, who always wore very long, heavy whiskers, and prided himself not a little thereon: "Look here, Deacon, if I was a louse, I'd be willin' to swim the Massessippi clear across to git to live in that hair on your chin; 'twould be enough to keep me warm." "How do you do, uncle Davy?" asked Mrs. Jenkins, as the old man hobbled up to the door. "Have they made a Know-Nothing of you yet?" "Ha, ha, ha! Mrs. Jenkins, how you talk!   Why I've been swopping the Know-Nothin's off down street; I give two on 'em for a Dutchman, and three for an Irishman!"

Come now, Mrs. Jenkins, would you be willing to give as good, honest, gentlemanly a little fellow as Frederic Trau for a dozen sich as Skinflint? Now we all kno? Mr. Trau would sooner lose ten dollars any day than cheat: a man out of a single cent. He's a foreigner, but aint he twice as much an honor to the country he lives in as any of these pesky Know-Nothin's?" A dozen heads were raised at this speech, and a dozen defenses trembled on- as many tongues when the old man said " pesky Know-Nothin's," for let the wife say what she will against her liege lord, if another assail even the party to which he belongs, without making him an exception, her ire is that instant aroused. Even Mrs. Jenkin's eye flashed fire as she replied quickly, ," All Know-Nothings are not pesky, as you call them, uncle Davy." "Ha, ha, ha!" laughed the old man, striking his cane on the floor, " how she does take it to heart! To be sure there's good Know-Nothin's, but I meant the Skinflints, and sich like."

"Have you heard what's been going on at Lockport?" asked Mrs. Smith, "( Mrs. Grey has just been telling us." "Yes, and I just heard one of the best things, yester day!

' Well, you know Abram Skinflint and Mr. Moreton had a fuss some time ago; and you know, too, what the folks generally think of the transaction.

(Now, mind ye, ladies, the stranger hadn't heard Miss Moreton's name; only knew her as the young lady from Brighton, El.) Well, you may be sure Miss Moreton spoke right straight up, and told him it was no such thing; that Skinflint was the rascal. i( 'Ah, but,' said the stranger, who had seemed uneasy when the young lady talked so hard against his debtor, 'you must not be too hard on him, Miss. te is my brother.

After this remark the Messrs. Dare received a general introduction to the company, and, leaving the three gen- tlemen to entertain the rest of the ladies, uncle Davy devoted himself to the pretty Quakeress, evidently to the discomfiture of Dare, Jr., who, on entering the room, had been struck by her peculiarly attractive face. "I know who isn't a Know-Nothin'," began the old man, in a loud whisper. "Does thee mean me?" asked Patience, looking up.

Then Sam replied, while chuckling low, ' It makes no diff'ence whar you go, You'll be de same as when you hoe, A nigger still!" WHILE Mr. Adam Dare amused himself at the sew- ing circle in Brighton, Emma Bartlett sat all alone in the handsomely furnished chamber of her uncle's dwellk ing which she had been told to call her own. Dreamily her eye wandered over the broad landscape before her. It was pleasant to gaze on the white cabins bathed in the mellow moonlight, and to feel the soft breath of early Spring fanning 'her cheek. An unusual quiet reigned over the plantation on this particular eve, no snatches of 1"Uncle Ned," or "Carry me back" broke the stillness at intervals; no merry laugh or answering shout. A cloud of sadness hung over the inhabitants at Deerwood; one of their number had that day been called to her reward: Aunt Milly was dead.  &#xD;<pb n="374-375" xml:id="VAC7466-00000188"/> 374       MMA BARTLEO:. OROl . Emma, who had been all day with Kate at the cabin, had vainly besought her, as the evening shades closed in, to accompany her to the house. "Not yet, Emma; let me stay a little longer," was / her only reply, and so, finding her, entreaties unavail- ing, she had sought her chamber alone. Long and dreamily she gazed, and as she trieato- look into the future, a deep-drawn sigh escaped her, "Roderic can never be mine!"  She tried to r  Vepait those words calmly to herself, as though anxious:to "become accus- tomed to the sound; she had never dared to weave any bright dreams-for the future, yet his oft-repeated words, that if they tried to do their duty all would yet be right, had inspired her with a confidence, a trust, it was hard to shake off now.

"But O! to see him once more; only once," urged the yearning heart over which: she had- struggled so unceasingly to gain the mastery. ,4'Yet why do you wish it?" asked Reason, and the - fluttering prisoner in her bosom again spoke out, "Because, because I love him and can not help it." "There would 'be more pain than pleasure at such a meeting," said Reason ; " you could -never summon the courage to divulge the secret, and a steadfast refusal without explanation would make him doubt your con- stancy.

A half hour was spent thus in self-examination, and then, turning from the window, she seated herself be- side her writing-desk, snatched a pen, and began wri- ting. Emma had not vanity enough to believe she could write poetry, but when her heart was full, it had always seemed natural for her to pour its contents out in verse. No eye save her own had ever scanned her effusions, for aliways, after she had read them, they were s committed to the flames.  Imagining that they could possess little interest to others, she had chosen this mode of commiuning with herself, without once dream- ing others might be gratified by a perusal. She be- stowed little thought or mental, labor on  these im- promptu verses,-but simply wrote to relieve a surcharged heart. On finishing, she picked them up and read them over: O! I'm lonely, sad and weary, And the secret in my breast Robs my eye of peaceful slumber, Fills me with a wild unrest. Memory now seems ever casting Earnest, longing lookls behind, As though searching for a treasure, She, alas! may never find. O!

After a little delay, Emmra began arranging her toi- let, for though in no mood to see a stranger, she could not disregard her uncle's request.

Then withdrawing the comb from her'sunny tresses, she watched them falling luxuriantly over her neck, and bidding the fair girl to be seated, she began combing them out and rolling them around her finger.         -  "I like best to see these ringlets unconfined, Emma," she said,' " and would sooner let my own hand wander among them than another's."

A dimness came over Mrs. Bartlett's eyes. u "In the Paradise above our little band will be reunited, my sweet child," she said, again bending her lips to the brow that now, as the golden durls c[ircled it round, seemed bathed in liquid light.

Mr. Selgrove was a fine, noble-looking gentlenlan of about forty. He was one who always entered into the spirit of any thing he took up, and now, on -his first call after several months' absence, Mr. Mitehcell and himself fell to discussing politics. Mr. Selglove had been a Whig, and a staunch upholder of his party as lonlg as any vestige of it remained  After its decease, he had remained neutral for a time, but being of too decided a turn of mind to be- satisfied with that posi- tion long, he had, as he laughingly remarked, chosen the lesser of two evils, and embraced the Democratic doctrine. It had required more of a struggle for him to take this step than it would for a more versa- tile person; but, as whiggery then existed only in name, he had come out boldly, as the thirty thousand in 'Virginia have since done, and declared himself a Democrat. ",I really believe," said Mr. Mitchell, on hearing him express himself with regard to slavery, "you are more of a pro-slavery'man than when you left us." "I am indeed, sir; I've witnessed so much inconsis- tency on this point since I have been gone, it has made me ultra, both on this subject and another that now agitates our land.

On my way to my brother's I passed several days with an old friend, residing in one of the towns on the West- ern Reserve. I had lived there several years, when a boy, and had a curiosity to see what changes time had produced." The speaker was here interrupted by the entrance of the two young ladies. A beautiful contrast the cousins presented, as they burst on Mr. Selgrove's view. Kate had chosen to array herself in a rich black silk, and with her raven tresses arranged with exquisite taste one could scarcely think of her as any other than the bright reality she was. But when the visitors eye rested on Emma's fairy-like form clad in unsullied white, the matchless beauty of her face, that secret grief had only rendered more ethereal, the pensive, yet earnest expres- sion of her soft blue eyes, he felt constrained to believe that some bright, glorious being, from a loftier sphere, had strayed from her native home, and wandered down to' earth.  On entering the room, Kate stepped forward and wel- zomed their visitor with a cordial shake of the hand. When Emma was presented, she did not extend her hand, as the gentleman, by his manner, evidently expected, but merely returned his salutation by a slight o..   . *      -    PREJUDICE AND FANATICISM.     385 bow.

After replying to several of Kate's inquiries with regard to his trip, Mr. Selgrove said, "I was just about to relate to your father, as you came in, an instance of the consistent conduct of some of our Northern' philanthro- pists with regard to runaway negroes. With your per- mission, ladies, I will continue." Both bowed an affirmative. "I was just saying, on my route I stopped a short time in a town on the Western Reserve; I had been there years before, and the greatest perceptible improve- ment I perceived, was the great acquisition made to the abolition army; almost every voice that met my ears was raised against slaveholders and foreigners. I happened to find one man who had not been carried away by fanati- cism, and who, like myself, had become so thoroughly disgusted with their continual outcry, he had gone gver to the enemy's quarters, or in other words, had settled in the South. He had been there some two weeks when I arrived, taking items of their manner of proceeding. He assured me, that it was an every day's occurrence for the abolitionists, when a runaway negro came among them, to persuade him to settle down right there, promise 33  &#xD;<pb n="386-387" xml:id="VAC7466-00000194"/> 386       EMMA BARTLETT: OR,  him good wages, get several months' hard work out of him, and then, just about the time for a settlement, to take him aside and say.'

Here are a couple of dollars; every cent I have by me; it will take you to the next town, and you can work your way after that. Good-by, old fellow! I'm sorry to part with you.' Thus they frighten the poor negro, who, having heard marvelous stories of the glories of freedom, risks- his master's displeasure by deserting his Southern home, and, on learning he has been followed thus far, dreads the infliction of punishment, and taking the advice of those he believes has his interest at heart, journeys on as far as his limited means will carry him, and then is obliged to stop several months longer among another set of swindlers, only to be duped by some similar artifice.

"What queer compliments the gentlemen pay us sometimes," said Kate, laughing.

"How do you like our friend Selgrove?" asked Kate, when the cousins were again alone. "I liked him much on the whole, and was charmed with his views on one particular subject." "And so was I, Emma.

He has been here a great number of years, though, and now is decidedly Southern in all his thoughts and feelings.

He accordingly en- trusted the entire management of his estate to his brother William, whose views were entirely opposite to his own."

"ETTERS. rTHEY had waited for a letter since the Summer 'gan to dawn, Until hope began to waver as the weary days dragged on, Till the bitter disappointment that their sad hearts dared not speak, Fell, condensed in dewy brightness, and lay glittering on each cheek. APRIL passed with her sunshine and showers, May with her buds and blossoms, and frbm nature's lap dropped the smiling June; then, as she vanished, July, with her warm, sultry days drew on apace. Still no news of the absent ones came to cheer the waiting hearts. They must certainly have returned to Boston weeks-before, and there have heard of their removal. Emma's letter, which she herself had dropped in the post-office the morning of their departure, would tell Roderic of their where-a-bouts. "Then why had he not written?" Thus would Kate ,query, without re- ceiving any satisfactory reply. As the weeks rolled on, a very perceptible change might have been observed in both our heroines. Over Emma the hidden grief had cast a quiet, pensive melancholy, and one would scarce believe, while gazing on those features, so faultless in  &#xD;<pb n="394-395" xml:id="VAC7466-00000198"/> 894      EMMA BARTLETT: OR, symmetry, that a great heart-sorrow was wearing her young life away. With Kate it was different; with a restless step she would wander about the house, while her eye beamed with an unnatural brightness, and when the evening shades closed around her, in the solitude of her, cham- ber she would sit and weep till her brain grew dizzy, and her forehead burned. "Think you we will ever hear from them again?" she asked, as Emma and herself sat, one afternoon, to- ward the latter part of July, beneath the spreading branches of one of the trees that lined the avenue. Emma did not know. "Mr. Hutten said he would not write, lest his letters might betray us; but being denied that privilege, it would hasten his return. Yet he surely has returned to Boston long ere this. Why then has he not written?" and Kate looked inquiringly at her cousin, as though expecting to gain the desired information of her. - Dear Kate, how should I know? Is it -not as much a mysteryto me as to yourself? But supposingihe should come in person, (for true love will venture much,) and confessing his attachment for you, should be promptly refused by your father, what then?"

"Did the mail bring us any thing to-day, uncle Jim?" asked the ladies in a breath.

She picked it up and read the name on the back. ( Here, Kate," she cried, joyfully, "here is some- thing for you, too." ) Kate, who had, with a native delicacy, arisen hastily and sought the shade of an adjoining tree, that her cousin might uninterruptedly enjoy the perusal of her first missive from her lover, quickly retraced her steps, and reached eagerly forward for the note.

Roderic's letter convinced Emma-he was suffering under the most harrowing suspense - He had just arrived in Boston, it said; had been obliged to remain in Ger- many- six weeks longer than he had anticipated, in con. sequence of the sickness of his friend, Karl. - He had been taken. the very day they were to have started back; the-attack had been severe as the one that pros- trated him some months before, and it had enabled him, (Roderic), to repay the kind, unwearying attention his young: friend had bestowed upon him when sick in a strange land. The trip across had taxed the little strength he had gathered, and for this reason they would be obliged to defer starting South for a fortnight. "Judge of my surprise and disappointment," he went on, " when, on reaching Boston, I hastened to your old home, and with a heart bounding with hope and expeec :tancy, I waited on the doorstep, expecting Lena to answer my summons, and usher me into your presence.

Had it not been for your letter, I should have been kept in entire ignorance of your where-a-bouts, and now, as I learn from it that during my absence you have been bereft of your parent and guardian, my bosom seems filled with alarm; perhaps Mare has superseded me; he may even now be with you.

That even should they meet, the terrible truth of her origin would be an insuperable barrier to their union!"But why not keep him in ignorance of it?" plead Love; and Con- science simply answered, "It would be wrong."

"No, no, not that!" she cried, passionately; ," don't ask me, Kate! I can't tell; indeed I can not! You wont feel hurt if I leave you a little! I must seek composure in solitude;" and rising hastily, she bent her steps to the house and sought her chamber. "I must write it now; now,', she said, firmly com- pressing her lips, " before my eyes rest on those words again, or my heart becomes too weak for the task." Seating herself at her writing-desk, witl an unsteady hand she put her resolve into execution, and though the scalding drops that fell upon the paper almost blinded her, still she wrote on. An hour later the letter, in which she had given a full statement of all she had gathered from Lena, was sealed and directed, and with the words, "Farewell for- ever, dear, dear Roderic," she arose, snatched her sun- bonnet, and hurried down stairs. "Uncle Jim, are you busy this evening?" she asked, stopping before that negro's cabin. "Only doin' nothin', Miss Emma," he replied bowing. "Could I get you to go to town for me?

"Thankee, Miss Emma; never fear uncle Jih." Not until a half hour after the negro's departure, did Emma allow herself to peruse Roderic's letter a second time. Love might make her falter in her pur- pose, and so she deemed it best to wait until it was impossible to recall the letter-bearer. But now that he was beyond her reach, she opened and read again and again the closing words. On the whole the letter was not as affectionate as she had expected, but she could see the reason. He feared that during his protracted delay, his rival Dare might have pressed his suit a second time, (she had told him ere he left that the merchant had offered hinself once,) and that, through the persuasion of friends, she might have given an unwilling consent, imagining, from his unexpected stay, that he had for gotten her. This, she felt sure was the cause of his uneasiness, and in this way she accounted satisfactorily for the lack of the tenderness she had expected to find.

Who was Rosalie? She had never but once mentioned that name to him, and that was-she remembered the time. Often had she felt a strong desire to ask him all about her, but when in his presence she could not- something in her bosom withheld her; she seemed afraid he would again revert to the past, when Rosalie was the "guiding star of his youth," and to hear him repeat that another had received the same homage his heart had given her, even though the cherished one had  &#xD;<pb n="404-405" xml:id="VAC7466-00000203"/> 404      B tMMA BARTLETT: OR, passed away, would cause her the same heart-pang she had felt when he told her Rosahe had once been so dear.

"I do respect and esteem him, highly," was Kate's reply; "but how can I love him? We cannot divide the affections in that way, coz."

She  looked again, but the figure had disappeared from view; so imagining it must have been one of the servants, instead of a visitor as she first thought, she let her -eye wander in another direction. Mr. Mitchell was reclining on a lounge, with an open paper in his hand, the contents of which he was endeav- oring to glean, during the intervals between his dozing.

The pedestrian -carried in his hand a small carpet-bag; his boots and clothes were covered with dust, and, altogether, his tout ensemble was not calculated to make a very favorable impression. "There is a stranger coming up the avenue, pa,-' said Kate, again interrupting the reader; '" he is walking, too." "What does he look like?" asked Mr. Mitchell, laying down his paper.  s"He looks as though he was tired to death, and ready to evaporate," she replied, as she saw the unknown one draw his handkerchief from his pocket, and wipe the moisture from his face; then, as he removed it and advanced a few steps, she exclaimed,' its Mr. Dare, as sure as can be! I'll run straight and tell Emma." i'-Hold on, Pussy. You must wait and give me an introduction. Remember, I am not acquainted with your friend." "Sure enough! you never met while we were in Boston! What an interesting spectacle he makes now!" "Hush, child! He might hear you." In fact, Mr. Dare's appearance was- rather striking when he reached the piazza, and returned Miss Mitehell's greeting; after which he was presented to her father. fHe had met with a rather unfortunate accident on the way, which was only one of a series of misfortunes that had befallti himn since he left Boston.  &#xD;<pb n="408-409" xml:id="VAC7466-00000205"/> 408       EMMA BARTLETT: OR, In the first place, he had taken ship to New Qrleans, for the purpose of disposing of the pork he had pur- chased and forwarded during his visit to Brighton. He had sent it " subject to further orders," and although the commission merchants had- written him, as the season advanced, that there was little prospect of its " going up," still, possessing, as he did, but a limited share of confi- dence in mankind generally, he had imagined his presence was necessary to effect the sale, and bring the sum at which he valued it. Far-seeing as he was, he was for once mistaken; for instead of making a (' snug little pile " by the investment, beside defraying the expense his anticipated visit to Miss Bartlett would incur, he was obliged to sell his pork at a reduced price, and in the end find himself '" out of pocket." He was, there- fore, in no enviable frame of mind, when, on reaching Lawrence by cars, he took his small portmanteau on his arm, determined to " foot it " to T-- , in order to save "unnecessary expense." He " could not afford to sus- tain his recent loss, unless he economized in little matters for a twelvemonth to-come." But the most mortifying accident befel him when about a mile from Deerwood. In -crossing a meadow, which cut off a considerable portion of the main road, he came very suddenly to a small stream which the sur- rounding blue grass had concealed from view, until his foot sunk in the mire.

Now this was truly a lamentable affair, for he had brought but a scanty supply of clothes with him, as he did not " wish to bo looking after baggage, and the like." Moreover, he had that morning made use of the last clean linen his port- manteau contained, with the hope of making a favorable impression, on his arrival. His outer garments did not suffer materially from his sudden prostration, for after sitting in the sun an hour, he had succeeded in removing the lmud as it dried; but the bosom of his shirt gave indisputable evidence of Adam's fall. After introducing him to her father, Kate hastened to inform Emma of his arrival. Mr. Dare took this oppor- tunity of relating his adventure to the Southerner, for he felt not a little embarrassed when, on taking the prof- fered chair in the sitting room, he caught a glimpse of himself in an opposite mirror, and then cast a hasty glance at Mr. Mitchell's spotless garments. The latter showed him to a spare chamber, and with- out delay furnished him with one of the needed articles from his own wardrobe.

A little timne was spent in pain/ r eflection, and then Emma sought her mother's chamber. I  e time had come when she must make a full confession, or force herself into the presence of one whose name made her shudder when she heard it. Her gentle knock was unanswered, and pushing, the or open, she went ill. There lay Mrs. Bartlett, fast asleep. Recent grief had left their traces on the features now resting, in repose. "It will but add another pang to the already sur- charged heart," she thought, looking fondly in her face, "I had hoped nothing would ever compel me- to impart this to her, she has always been so regardful of my happiness. I wished to spare- her this. But why awake her from this quiet slumber to impart to her a painful reality?' I have said I would not see him till to-morrow, and to-night will be time enough to tell her." Then, with the words " dear mother " trembling on her lips, she stole noiselessly away. Wandering out into the garden, she opened a gate and passed into a narrow path which,- after various windings, led to a shady grove about a quarter of a mile from the main building. This was a favorite re- treat of the young girl, when she wished to indulge in   PREJUDICE AND FANATICISM.     413 an hour of uninterrupted thought. A grassy knoll hard by'a bubbling stream-was her seat, and thither she bent her steps. On reaching this spot she breathed more freely, and involuntarily ejaculated, "Thank Heaven, my eye. may not chance to fall upon him here. O! how can I ever-acknowledge to any one- that heis my father?"  Then carefully withdrawing from her bosom the picture she always carried about her, she said, "He deceived you, my mother, and to-morrow, if the strength be given me, let the struggle cost what it will I will seek him alone, and holding this before his eyes, ask him if he knew the original. He may deny it with his lips, but I will watch his features narrowly, and if guilt be depicted there, it will banish from my mind every shadow of doubt. It will be a bitter trial for me to remain among them after uncle's family has learned the history of my birth. O! could I but fly to some remote, obscure spot, where none would point the finger of scorn at me! ,Ah, me!" Bitter indeed were the poor girl's reflections, as she sat there, and not until she had knelt on the grassy sod and lifted up her crushed heart in prayer, 'did the calm come, Then, as she arose, with a look of resignation she re-seated herself, and let her thoughts wander off to Roderic.  Had he received her letter?  Was he even then striving to forget her?  Would he return to his native land, and  never again set foot on Columbia's soil?  Would she ever hear from him  again'?

'tis hard, to banish from the mind one to whom the whole heart turns with such perfect confiding trust! Emma truly felt it so. Had he ever in any way proved himself unworthy of her love, the trial might have been less severe. But to resign entirely one who was so good, so noble, so wor. thy, had, and she felt would still, cost her many a heart-ache. "O! Roderic!" she cried, despairingly, s" would we had never met!" With her eyes fixed upon the ground, ana wholly ab- sorbed by these reflections, it was not strange she did not perceive a figure winding along the narrow foot. path leading to the main road. It was evident that the traveler was striving to regain theghigh-way, which he had left to shorten distance, for he peered cautiously around, and often came to a dead halt, as though uncer- tain about the direction he wished to take. His light Panama was pushed back, that- it might not interfere with his search; the road, he thought, could not be far off; he had entered the grove but a short time before, anul the path would certainly not mislead him far. By waiting an hour he could have been conveyed in the coach to within a hundred yards of his destination, for it passed by Deerwood daily, but, though an hour flies quickly, it seemed an interminable period to him just then, and warm  as it was, he preferred hurrying on. He was, too much engaged with his own musings   PRrEJUPPIC AND FANATICISM.    416 to notice the young girl; and crossing the stream at a bound, was llhrying on, when his ear was arrested by her last exclamation. The foliage concealed her from view, but that voice-he knew it better than any other sound on earth. A quick movement on his part re- vealed her features. Springing lightly forward he reached her side in an instant. . The noise arrested her attention, and she looked up. A supernatural fear took possession of her. Was it the spirit of her lover she beheld? Could it be himself? Starting suddenly to her feet, she stood transfixed with alarm. - It was all so sudden, she could not believe it was reality. "Emma!" There was no mistaking that voice! Those we;e no phantomz fingers that-clasped themselves around her trembling hand! The dark eyes bent upon her were none other than Roderic's own. "Emma!" the voice was low and full of tenderness. He drew closer as he repeated the name, and opened his arms to receive her. Still she did not move. Her lips, too, seemed petrified. "Will you not speak to me, Emma? Have you no welcome for your Roderic?" O! how she longed to throw herself on his bosom! There he stood, the one to whom her heart turned with all the fervor of an ardent, loving nature; yet all her yearnings 'must be forced back.

The dark suspicion that had haunted Roderic's mind since he first learned Dare had preceded him to the South, now began to assume the form of a terrible truth. Dare had been there; she had consented; had become his wife! And now, as he stood gazing ou her death- like features, he reproached himself for not turning a deaf ear to Karl's entreaties to remain with him till his strength was recovered, instead of starting instantly for the South.  And had the villain, indeed, a second time robbed him of his treasure?  The thought was tortur- ing; it forced him to speak out.' "IEmma," he began, in a fearfully earnest tone, sunk to a hollow whisper, ', is it as I feared? Has Dare sup- planted me?"  He leaned against a tree as he spoke, for the struggle he was called to endure unmanned him. "I have not seen Mr. Dare since we left Boston,;" she replied; II he is - "  "Thank Heaven!" burst from the lover's lips, and he again extended his arms, as a sudden light broke over his face.  But Emmas drew back, repeating mournfully, "I am   not worthy, Roderic! I can never be your's! You did not get my letter!" "Yes, the day before I  started," he returned, now fully comprehending her words. A thrill of joy awoke in the young girl's bosom as he   PREJUDICE AND FANATICISM,     417 spoke. Then he had come despite the revelation she had made.  "And yet you came?" she said, lifting the trembling lids that she might steal a second glance at that face, whose image was so indelibly impressed upon her memory. '( Yes," he replied, again clasping her fluttering hand in his own, ,( and you have refused me a cordial greeting. I'have looked forward to this moment, and fancied it would be one of rapture; but alas! I am ever doomed to disappointment. Sit down by my side, Emma," he went on without appearing to notice the pain his reproachful tone had caused, " and I will tell you of some one who loved me in my youth."   Tremblingly she complied. Painful as she felt it would be to listen, she seemed incapable of refusing, "It is little less than a score of years ago that I loved a gentle being, not unlike you; from childhood our hearts had, as it were, grown together; she was dear to-m e as the apple of my eye; her presence made life beautiful to me, but stern necessity forced us to separate; duty called her to a foreign clime, where I intended joining her as soon as I became of age.

As she ceased speaking, she essayed to rise to conceal the gath- ering moistur6 in her eye. "Not yet, Emma; hear me through," he said, gently drawing her back. There was magnetism in that touch, and she could not disregard it. "Am I then so dear to you, Emma?" he said, tenderly. "Well, hear me through, and, if you desire it, the name shall never again be mentioned in your presence. I loved her. Yes, 'tis true, and I must repeat it, but as I said, she left my side and accompanied her father and brother to a distant clime. Her father, I said; but I am mistaken. He died on shipboard, leaving herself and little brother, orphans, and alone. They reached the foreign -port penniless. I can not tell you all. Suffice it to say, she was deceived by a villain, who urged her to become his wife. After robbing her of her little brother, he engaged an accomplice to perform a mock marriage; after which she accidentally learned the truth and made her escape. And then, Emma, at the expira- tion of a twelve month, she returned to her native land, destitute, forsaken, and heart-broken, just in time to tell me all she had endured, and expire in my arms." "Poor thing!" exclaimed Emma, herformer jeal- ousy crushed by the kindlier sympathies his story had aroused. A smile flitted over those fine features, as he marked C           ,               '   PREUTDIVX AI M-1TAH OISM.    419 the deep interest depicted on the sweet face upturned to his. "And, Emma," he continued, in the same low bne, "When she told me the name of her deceiver, I raised my hand to swear vengeance upon him, but she laid her attenuated fingers on my arm, and begged me to leave that to Heaven." She was right," said the soft voice, solemnly, "you know;, Vengeance is mine, and I will repay, saith the Lord.' You gave heed to her words, did you not, Roderic?" Those earnest orbs were raised full of inquiry now. "Yes, sweet monitor, I did, and more. I promised her that if life were spared, I would leave my native land, and search diligently for the lost brother and her offspring, and when found, I would devote my remain- ing days to their happiness." "And did you, Roderic, did you keep your promise?  The maiden's gaze was fastened on him now; she seemed so eager to hear all he had to say. "Years passed," he went on," I came to America--. " ' To America! was that the foreign country?" she asked, with a look of wonder and surprise. "Yes, 'twas here they were left; I found the boy grown to manhood. .It was Karl Hutten, Emma." -The listener would have started to her feet, but she seemed riveted to the spot. "Was it indeed he?" she cried, in astonishment, "and the other, Roderic?" she added, breathlessly.  \  &#xD;<pb n="420-421" xml:id="VAC7466-00000211"/> 420       EMMA BARTLEM: OR, "She, too, was ripening into womanhood; the per- fect semblance of her mother.

And she--am I wrong in thinking she returns my love as fully as the -gentle being who brought her into existence?" While Roderic spoke, a light broke over Emma's countenance, and the mingled surprise- and rapture beaming from her eyes, seemed to form a halo of glory and encircle her brow. When he ceased, with a wild burst of jov,.she threw herself into his extended arms, exclaiming, in a voice tremulous and broken, "O! Rod- eric! Roderic! it is I! Rosahe was my mother!

WHLE the lovers thus talked, another guest had joined the trio in the sitting-room. Mr. Selgrove had dropped in, and while Miss Mitchell monopolized his thoughts, the father directed Mr. Dare's attention to the column that had arrested his eye before their guest's arrival. That gentleman had seen no account of the riot, and was soon absorbed in its perusal. As he sat thus engaged, the Southerner had ample time to scrutinize his features witho. appearing rude. Mrs. Bartlett had told him of the interest this person had manifested in Emma; he had learned, through her, that Dare contemplated visiting Deerwood, and for what purpose. His lovely niece, with her winning manners, and gentle ways had already endeared her- self to him, and he felt that before he'could consent to resign her to any one, the claimant must first prove himself every way worthy of her. There was some. thing, he hardly kne v what, about Dare's face he did not like; perhaps it was the expression of self-compla. cency that lingered about his mouth; but what puzzled   him most was the resemblance he bore to some one he had seen at some former period. Who or where he  tried in vain to recall. Indeed, so striking seemed the similarity, at one time he felt almost convinced he had seen that face before. "They had quite a time," said the guet, laying the paper down; " but that's nothing to what we'll see at the Presidential election; that, sir, will be the most intensely exciting time our country has ever known. Mark my words, sir, blood will be spilled! And even if it is, why I say, 'Let it flow.' It will never be poured forth in a better cause. We must maintain our rights, and let these foreign usurpers feel it to be a terrible thing to dare resist the native born sons of freedom." "You have more trouble with foreigners in your East- ern cities than we have here," Mr. Mitchell remarked. "Oh, yes, a hundred fold more. There, their arro- gance is at times insufferable. Why, sir," continued Dare, drawing nearer, and assuming a confidential air, it was but a short time before your friend, the Rev. George Bartlett, died, that one of these presumptuous creatures intimated to me, that he hoped, at some future time, to aspire to the hand of your niece, Miss Bartlett." "Ah, indeed! how came that? Was Emma aware of his aspirations?  "I am uninformed on that point; he had been giving her instruction in music, and I have every reason to be- lieve Mr. Bartlett suspected his intention, for he sent 36   &#xD;<pb n="426-427" xml:id="VAC7466-00000214"/> 426       AWMA BAtTELET: OR, Mr. Duichy word by me, that his services were no loner needed. It was so preposterous --so perfectly absurd, to think of such assumption!" Dare had unconsciously raised his voice at the last exclamation, and Kate, who sat directly opposite the- speaker, caught the last sentence. It called to mind the time she had used those self-same words, and she delayed the reply she was about to make to Mr. Selgrove's remark, with the hope of hearing her father's answer. It came. My brother-in-law acted just as I would have done, nuder similar circumstances," he said. "I confess, I always have had an inherent prejudice against foreigners, and nothing could ever induce me to entrust a daughter of mine to their keeping." "Mas'r Charles, could you please step into de lib'ary, a minit? You's wanted." The Southerner arose, and asked to be excused, while Bob returned to the lawn, continuing a wonderful display of agility, by substituting his head and hands for his heels. "Jane," he said, hailing that individual as she crossed the yard with a tub on her head, "I say, Jane, I makes my head more 'count dan you does your'n; I rests my heels, dis way." "So I see." ' But look yer," he said, suddenly performing an evo. lution, which brought his feet to the ground, " did you aef Miss Emma, a minit ago; afore she went in de house" A. *   PREJUDICE AND FANATICISM.     427 "No, Bob; why?"

"Come up to my room, Kate,' she said, passing her arm round her waist, "I have something to tell you." "Grieving yet because your beau has come, coz?" she asked. "My beau, Kate?" "Yes, Mr. Dare. You have summoned me away from mine too. Mr. Selgrove is down stairs." "Katie, dlear, have you examined your heart thor. oughly? Are you right sure you don't love Mr. Sel- grove a little?" "Quite sure, Emma," she returned, seating herself on a lounge beside her cousin. "He is every way worthy of you, Kate."

"The very mention of such a thing blanclies your cheeks, yet you can give no reason for your lack of love for him. Aunt thinks well of him, and so did your other friends in Boston; yet all this does not change your feelings toward him in the least. It is thus with me. Mr. Selgrove I ad- mire and esteem, but the love-chamber within is occu- pied by another's image."

Painful indeed was it for the cousin to see her suffer thus, -yet she had thought it would be so. That strong, earnest nature was stirred as are the ocean waves when the whirlwind passes over them. An hour passed away, yet still the cousins sat there. Kate's full, lustrous eyes had twice unclosed, but she shut them   quickly, as though  to dispel some hideous dream.    f Emma watched in vain for the tears. The agony, she, feared, might set fire to her brain, and reason might thus be dethroned.

"You are probably both surprised and indignant," he began, noticing the look with which Mr. Mitchell regarded him, " that I, a stranger and a foreigner, should come, uninvited, to your house, and demand one of its inmates But listen to my story, before you censure." And he went on .to speak of his deep attachment to Rosalie, of their separation, of all she passed through during their sojourn in America, and then, after she was taken, how he had resolved that the great object of his life should be to seek and protect the two she had left behind; how he had searched till he had found them, and how, when his eyes first rested upon Emma, the o4d flame burst forth afresh, and all the ardent attachment of yore seemed to revive. The lover did not hurry over the recital; he dwelt long and passionately on it, for he saw the Southerner's heart was touched; the incredulity he had expected him to evince, was not discernible; and more than once while he was speaking, Mr. Mitchell essayed to interrupt him. At length he said: "You may think it strange that I do not doubt what you have related to me, for to other ears it would seem more like a fabrication than reality; but by a singular coincidence I am led -to believe your words are strictly  &#xD;<pb n="432-433" xml:id="VAC7466-00000217"/> 432       EMMA BARTLETT: OR, true. The name you have mentioned, and the relation you intimate my niece bears to that individual, has recalled an incident to which I was an eye-witness, eigh- teen years ago, while in Boston. I there chanced to meet the man, who, you say, now comes to my house as a suitor to his own child. I am convinced you are cor- rect in this, for I traced a resemblance in his face to some one I had seen, and I now believe it mist have been himself. Tlhis Dare was then, and I presume is yet, very enthusiastic on the slavery question; at his request I accompanied him to a ship, one evening, to see for myself, the number of emigrants it contained, and while there my eye was arrested by a beautiful girl, who seemed to be without a protector. I mentioned it to my new acquaintance, and he said she should be pro- vided for. I left her in his charge, and only once after- ward did I see that face again. It was on the night she made her escape. It was I who snatched her from the pillar ere she fell." "Impossible!" cried Roderic, grasping the South- erner's hand. "It is even so; and this is why I cannot doubt your story. I learned then, from a slip of paper the servant, had in her possession, that her name was Rosalie. She recognized' me, and probably thinking I was Dare's accomplice, having seen me in his company- on ship-board, ih'e fled before I could -proffer my assistauee.

But, Mr. Mitchell," he added, " about Emma, your niece; is your answer still the same? Place your- self in my position, and let me ask you, what you should do?  "Take her, take her to yourself. I have neither the right nor inclination to urge any objections now. Your untiring devotion deserves a life-time of happiness, and I sincerely trust sir, it may be yours." ' I thank you for your generous conduct and kind wishes," said, Roderic, feelingly. "But this Dare-what will you do with him?" "What would you advise, under the circumstances?" "Shoot him, sir! he deserves it richly," exclaimed the Southerner, indignantly. "Heaven must mete out his punishment, not I," was the calm reply. "I have promised, and his blood shall never stain my hands. He shall be exposed, however, and with your consent I will seek his presence instantly. Will you accompany me?"  Mr. Mitchell signified his willingness, and together they entered the sitting room. Mr. Dare was its only occupant; he had resumed his reading as soon as Mr. Mitchell left, for Mr. Selgrove had shown no disposition to cultivate his acquaintance, having strolled out upon the piazza to await the return of either the ,father or daughter. Like Mr. Mitcholl, he too seemed to have an indistinct recollection of having 37  &#xD;<pb n="434-435" xml:id="VAC7466-00000218"/> 434      EMMA BARTLETT: OR, seen that face before.. Mr. Selgrove was in no very amiable mood as he waited on the piazza. "Was Miss Mitchell's protracted stay intentional?" he asked him- self. Did she absent herself because his visit was not agreeable to her? He had felt a growing interest in her for a year past, and at times had thought it was returned, but of late he had little to hope from her manner. It was not desperation made him resolve to end the suspense by offering himself. In the years that were past, this feeling had been awakened in his bosom, and utter despair had succeeded it, for his heart had been denied the treasure it had coveted; and now, when a second interest was felt, it was a calm, quiet affection that could not subject him to the disappoint- ment he had once experienced. "Good evening, Mr. Dare," said Mr. Sundahl, ap- proaching his former employer, "( We have met agaiw." Dare looked up from his paper in surprise. At first, the recollection of their parting words made him quake a little, but quickly banishing his fears, he said, with a slight curl of his lip, ,I did not- expect to meet you here, sir, and have no desire to renew your acquain- tance." "I came," said Roderic, without noticing his remark, "with the hope of finding favor in the eyes of the fair girl to whose hand you once thought it would be pre- sumptuous for me. to aspire." "My convictions on that point are the samenow, sir,"   PREJUDICE :AND FANATfTSM.    435 retorted Dare, quickly, irritated by what he considered "cool impudence in the Dutchman."  "Don't flatter yourself that no opposition will be offered." The speaker glanced significantly at Mr. Mitchell. as he said this. ', The very fact that my rival has preceded me ought, I know, to fill my breast with alarm. It seems strange that I should doubt the success of one so per- fectly. irresistible," he said, in a cutting, sarcastic tone. "Sir, such insolence is absolutely insupportable!" cried Dare, rising and standing before him the very picture of offended dignity. "What do you mean, sir?" "Simply," said Roderic, calmly, " that you, who have come as a suitor for Emma Bartlett's hand; never can, never shall be her protector. Protector," he repeated, with a look of contempt, " you a protector! Sir, you're a villain!" "How?" cried Dare, passing his hand through his hair rapidly, evidently determined to do something des- perate, though he didn't just know how to go about it. "You undertook to protect an innocent girl once," he went on, drawing something from his pocket. "My friend, Mr. Mitchell here, was with you when you met her on- the ship; you planned her ruin. By the aid of an accomplice, you had a ceremony performed which she believed was legal. She- afterward learned the truth, and fled from your presence. She escaped narrowly with her life.

But you needn't tremble or cringe now! Crush back your cowardly fear! ---arl is dead." "Indeed!" said Mr. Mitchell, in a tone of regret, while Dare breathed more freely. "He was' killed in the Louisville riot; but," he con-. tinued, looking Dare full in the face; {" though she daying his hand upon the picture), is taken, and Karl is gone, her child is left -Emma remains to me!  "Her child!" burst from Dare's lips. They were the first words he had uttered. "Yes Adam Dare, Emma Bartlett, to whom you have come in the character of a suitor, is your own daughter ; yet she blushes to own. the relationship. It is her wish never to see your face again.

Roderic bent on him a look of in- quiry,but did not comply. ' I have the best of reasons for asking it, my good sir," he said in his rich, clear voice; " if I mistake not, I -have something in my possession that may throw some light on this matter." "We- want no further proof. A    guilty conscience needs no accuser, said Roderic, pointing to Dare. "I perceive ; but you do not understand me. Hold it if you will, but Vet me see the picture." Roderic obeyed. Mr. Selgrove gazed intently for a moment, then said, It is the same. I was correct in my conjecture." Then -turning to the discomfited merchant, he asked, "Do you recollect of ever having seen me before?" Dare shook his'-head. "Well, sir, this -is not our first me-eting.

Your accomplice. must have proved treacher- ous, for I remember, when the ceremony was ended, he followed me out, and said I had helped him thwart some devilish planning. He promised to call and explain afterward, but he never came." The climax of mortification was reached. Dare could stand no more; he hurried abruptly from  the room. It was quite dark when he emerged from  the outer door, yet by the faint glimmer of the stars he made his way to the main road. This was traversed as fast as his feet could carry him, and an hour afterward found him safely seated in one of the packets that plow the waters of the Tennessee river. He did not care to return Immediately to Boston. Mr. Sundahl, he thought, would not rest until he had exposed him, and he had no desire to be in-his native-city when that gentleman passed through with his bride. He hoped not to meet that personage again, and so, by a little delay, he im- agined he could avoid him. He should not feel easy - again until time enough had elapsed for-them to em- bark for Germany.

But unforeseen events frustrated his designs.

He found Brighton as dull and quiet as when he left. One late occurrence, however, seemed to give general satisfaction to the villagers. Skinflint and the widow Martin had "gone to law," and the widow had gained the suit. "And what's more," said uncle Davy, who recognized our hero on the street, and took it upon him- self to inform him of all that had transpired during his absence, , it made Skinflint so all-fired mad he went and scratched his name  off the railroad- subscription list, giving  as his reason for so doing, that 'there were not ten men in Brighton who would not ruin him if they could.' Wasn't that bitin' off his own nose to spite his face? Ha, ha, ha!"And the old man brought his cane down on the pavement with a loud report. "How changed Nellie is since Spring," said Dare to his brother-in-law, "I don't believe she'll stand it long. Have you consulted a  physician about her?" The husband had not. It was only a severe cold, he said; it would pass off after a while. If it troubled her much she would say more about it, but she went about and did not complain a great deal. No, she did not complain much, for where was the             .   PREJUDICE AND FANATICISM     441 use? With no regular salary, she knew her husband could not afford to hire help, and the children must ie seen to, even though her wasting strength should ex- haust itself in the effort, their wants must be supplied. Or! there is nothing more pure or deep or holy than a mother's love; unwearying, exhaustless and steadfast unto death, it ielinquishes not its devotion while the frail tenement remains. It is interwoven with every fiber of the being, and only releases its watchful care when the clay returns to dust. Mrs. Gardiner felt that she was passing away, and she would clasp her babes convulsively to her bosom, as she thought how soon they would be motherless. The little ones, as they gathered round her knee at night to receive the'kiss to which they had ever been accustomed, didn't know why she held their tiny hands longer than had been her wont, or why her voice trembled so when she said "Good-night, darlings." They could not tell why she often let her sewing drop from her hands to talk to them of Heaven, the beautiful place they would all go to if they were good. Once she had told them she thought she would soon have to leave them and go up there; and Jany, the three years old lisper had laid her chubby hand, on her baby sister's head4 saying, "You'll take us along, -moder. Paty, Prudy and Jany too 'ittle to stay." Dare had been but a few days at his sister's, when he was attacked with typhoid fever, the prevailing J               &#xD;<pb n="442-443" xml:id="VAC7466-00000222"/> "2      RMMA BARTLEI   R, sickness in Brighton during the fall. Weeks rolled away, and when in the delirium of fever the thin, wasted form of his sister bent above him, moistening his parched lips, or cooling his burning brow, the sick man would imagine it was the one who had watched over his infant years, the guardian angel of his child- hood; and when his wild, wandering gaze settled upon her face, he would repeat in almost childish accents, - "Mother! mother!" And then the tears would well up to the sister's eyes, both because that name took her back to her youth, when she was happy in the innocence of childhood-to the days when Adam would take her on his knee and tell her of their mother who died when she was a babe, who was so kind and gentle and good, and because it made her think how soon her own little ones would grow up and call for "mother" in vain. When the crisis was passed, and the disease took a turn for the better, the sister's form was missing from his bedside; her strength had at length given way, and she grew Worse rapidly. Dare recovered slowly. - The first visit he made on leaving his room was to his sis- ter's chamber. The wasted form was arrayed for its alast resting place, the hands meekly folded on the cold bosom, the eyes closed in death. The twin babes were asleep in their crib near her. Little Jany, too, had sobbed herself asleep in Mrs. Jenkins' arms. Dare was touched by the picture. Those rigid features brought   PRE-UDICOi AM A"NATAOCISM.    448 forcibly to his mind his dead mother; their little Nellie was just about-the age of the slumberers in the crib when the destroyer entered their household; and now there she lay, leaving behind her, little tender blos- soms to be reared by stranger hands. "How they will miss her love and care," thought the brother, for he remembered back, beyond the dark years of sin and recklessness through which he had wandered, to the time when he was the recipient of a mother's love; for, throughout his headlong career, thoughts of her had been the one pure remembrance looming up through the surrounding gloom. Con- science began to chide as he stood gazing there, and many good resolves were formed which he determined should not be transient as the morning dew.  Mrs. Gardiner was consigned to her last resting place; the hearth-stone was desolate, for what is home with- out woman's presence?"Mr. Gardiner wrote to a brother in Missouri, requesting him to take the two oldest boys. The brother acquiesced, and as the father could not leave the younger children, Dare offered to escort them to their new home, "To be sure, I have .some scruples about sending them to Missouri, for it is a slave State, and it is not improbable that they may grow up pro-slavery men, but in cases of necessity, one can not stop for such con- siderations," said the philanthropic father.

Like many of those who went out, he stepped into the cars little dreaming of the terrible accident that was to follow. Yet, though he knew it not, the last day of his earthly career had come, for among the mutilated bodies extracted from the living piles, the remains of Adam Dare were found. His friend had shared his fate, and when conveyed with the rest to the depot, no weeping relatives came to claim the clay; its receptacle bore, no name, for none knew who he was, or whence be came. Thus passed away, in the meridian of life, one who was lamented by none, except his aged father; one who, having made mammon the god before whom he bowed, left no good deeds behind to show the purpose for which he had been. . But we will not dwell upon his faults, Like Roderic, we will leave it to a higher power to mete out his deserts, and kindly draw the veil of charity over his many vices.

"Such promises as that comfort my drooping spirit. I will be calmer by and by." "Yes," returned Emma, in a low, solemn tone, "the morning will dawn anon; the light will break; this is the only true anchor for the soul, Kate, the only sure dependence" "If the world did not appear so void, and life so dark, Emma, I could better endure it." "We need surrounding darkness to bring out the star-light of Heaven, Kate. If life's pathway were cloudless, we would look no higher for light." "True, true," said Kate, resting her head on her cousin's shoulder. "Think of mother," the latter went on; "she was devotedly attached to father, and yet she was called to give him up.

"Yes, Emma, read on; I feel as aunt Milly used to, I can't hear enough."' Emma had truly said the light would break. Days passed; the conflict was severe; 'twas hard for that proud spirit to yield, to become humble and obedient to the Divine Will, to acknowledge with child-like meek. ness the wisdom of a higher power, to cast her burden upon the mighty One, and implore His assistance. And when the morning, as LEmma had prophesied, dawned upon her soul, though mists of doubt and des- pondency would at times flit across her mental horizon, they soon passed away, for she had learned, "When the heart is full, when bitter thoughts Come crowding thickly up for utterance, And the poor common words of courtesy Are such a very mockery-how much The bursting heart may pour itself in prayer." And thus, gradually, Kate Mitchell became a changed being. To her father it was a source of regret, for he mistook her habitual calmness for a settled melancholy, which he said the "sad affair" had thrown over her. He had always been proud of her queenly bearing and haughty spirit, and it pained him to see it broken. He knew not that the good seed dropped by his. gentle niece in due season was taking root, and in the future might spring up and bear an hundred fold; that she 38 .*  &#xD;<pb n="450-451" xml:id="VAC7466-00000226"/> - - H:- EMMA BA  yMATtlt , OR' had liid aside:the pomp and vanities of the world; and was beginning to enjoy that peace which passeth all understanding.

Thus was the good minister, although dead,:-on- tinually speaking, -for the pious teachings of the- wife 'and daughter showed plainly that his words had been carefully garnered in their memories.

"O! there's not much form    about it. She is of a poetic nature, and I hoped it might touch her. Read it, if you wish; its nothing  but some rhymes I strung together during a leisure moment.     There," she said, laughingly handing him    the paper, "you are the first person I have ever honored with a perusal of one of my weighty productions."

"What's the matter, Roderic?     Can't you read it? 'Is it not fair writ,' as Shakspeare says?" she asked, after waiting, as she thought, long enough for him to peruse it. "Yes, I can read it, Emma,"-he replied, turning his full dark eyes upon her, and regarding her with a look of pride, "give- it to your mother by all means.    She can not resist that."  &#xD;<pb n="454-455" xml:id="VAC7466-00000228"/> 454      EMMA BARTLETT: OR, "Fie, fie!.Mr. Flatterer! don't try to impress me with the belief that there is any intrinsic merit in the piece. You must learn to bestow praise where it is deserved." "Must I?" he said, smiling. "Well, give it to your mother immediately; it will help her decide," and again his eyes sought her face. "Emma, true love never flatters designedly; don't you know that?" "It may err, though, at times, Roderic, by having too exalted an opinion of something very ordinary. Did you never hear that Cupid was blind?" Thus the lovers talked until the evening shades gathered, and then they bent' their steps toward the house, where Roderic requested Emnma to sing his old favorite for him. The fair pupil complied. Seated at the exquisitely wrought piano that graced the elegant parlor of Mr, Mitchell, with her taper fingers gliding over the keys. and her face lit up with- the love-light of a happy heart, Emrma looked the personification of youth and loveli- ness. The tall, graceful figure of Roderic stood by her side; his finely-cut features were aglow with anima- tion, and his full, deep, musical voice joined harmoni- ously in the chorus. Absorbed as they were by the music, they did-not observe a door open noiselessly and a figure glide in. It was Kate.  Her wealth of raver tresses were 'thrown  carelessly back, her dark eyes seemed swollen from recent weeping, and the -shadow   PREJUDICE AND PANATiCISM.     455 on her brow told of the struggle through which she was passing. Roderic had not seen her since his arri- val, for, until now she had preferred the solitude of her own chamber.  "Emma, dear," she said, approaching the performer, and laying her hand upon her arm, "( please don't sing that; it hurts me. I can hear it up stairs. It takes my thoughts back, you know." She was turfing to depart, when her eye fell upon Rod- eric; she offered him her hand, and tried to smile, but the effort was vain. The song had called up some ten- der memories, and now, as she gazed upon the two, she thought of the missing one, of the parting scene, and the hours she had spent picturing the joy of the re-uu- 1 ion. With a trembling step she left the apartment to conceal her agitation, and returned to the solitude of her chamber. "It was the song, Roderic.. He was near when we sang it last.  I didn't think. Poor Kate! ' That evening, ere Emma sought her own room, she stole to her mother's, which she knew was unoccupied at that moment, and laying a small note on her dress- ing-case, quickly withdrew. And there Mrs. Bartlett found it. The mother was deeply affected when she read those simple stanzas. To her they spoke volumes; coming fresh and warm from her daughter's heart, they found a response in her own.

Never was daughlter dearer to parent than was the gentle Emma to her adopted mother, and though it might cost her a struggle to leave her native land, she would not mar the dear child's happiness by a refusal. After a half hour spent in reflection, she snatched her pen and replied: I will go with thee Emma, my beautiful one, From the clime where I first drew my breath, And will with thee remain till life's conflict is done- Until called by the angel of death. Thou hast said, and most truly, his spirit can come From the glorious regions of day As soon, on light wings to our far distant home, As if we were never to stray. I will go with thee, Emma; for reft of thy smile Would life seem a wild desert track, And nought would my sad heart of sorrow beguile, Save when Memory kept drawing it back To the years when thy presence was sunlight to me, Whenr my ear caught thy light, joyous tone; And oft would my spirit keep yearning for thee As I finished life's journey alone. I will go with thee, Emma; in Ruth's living words, Where thou goest my footsteps will hie; Thy people are mine, where thou lodgest, I lodge- Where thou diest, O! there let me die. O! ne'er may the chain that has bound us so long By Fate's fingers be ruthlessly riven Till life's dream is ended, and quitting earth's throng I ascend toethe loved one in Heaven.     .    .

THmnRE was something good and noble In those features in repose, When at intervals you watched them Through the clouds of smoke that rose. WRAPPED in profound musings, with the light smoke of his cigar curling gracefully about his head, Mr. Mitchell sat on the piazza with his chair tilted back, gazing on the tall, majestic oaks that lined the avenue, whose leaves of green and scarlet were illuminated by the golden light of a Southern sunset. It was Sabbath evening; the merry hum of voices that usually rose when the evening shades closed in upon a day of toil, was hushed; no wild snatches of song echoed through the meadows of blue grass; the cotton fields were deserted; the moist earth around the emerald stalks had been undisturbed during the day, and the dark green pods had not once been rustled by a passing form. The yard seemed alive with dark shadows, flitting hither and thither, arrayed in every variety-of color; some sat in the low cabin doors, talking in suppressed whispers of "' de awful misfortunate affa'r 39  &#xD;<pb n="458-459" xml:id="VAC7466-00000230"/> 458      EWMA BAARTLET:  OR, dat made their young mist'ess so diff'ent from what she uster be. So quiet and sad like."  While a band of " little niggers " were collected around Miss Emma on the front gallery, listening with beaming eyes to the words that fell from her lips. It had been her wont to congregate these juveniles every Sunday eve- ning for the purpose of instructing them, and it was no unusual thing to see many of the older ones join that youthful circle, and, with mouth apart, assume an attitude of profound thought. There was a greater earnestness than usual, in Emma's tone, on this particular evening, for before another Sab- bath's sun arose she would be far away. It was a pleas- ant sight'-- that fair young creature, with her lithe form swaying to and fro, as she tried to impress some impor- tant truth on those infant minds, her soft blue eyes beaming with interest, her coral lips apart, repeating to that listening group the passages of Holy Writ com- mitted when a child, at the good minister's knee. Pleas- ant to hear her relate to them, how the dear Saviour-took little children 'in his arms, and blessed them, bidding them to come to Him, 1" for of such is the kingdom of Heaven," and though she could not refrain from a smile, when Bob, all alive with curiosity, grasped the folds of her dress, and looking eagerly into her face, interrupted her with, ," Did he mean us niggers, too? I still the smile was so sweet and serious, it took away none of the impres- siveness of her words.  Kate sat on the gallery near   PREJUDICE AND FANATICISM.     459 her cousin, giving earnest heed to all she said. She had promised Emma she would try to fill her place, when she left, and keep her advised by letter of the progress of her class. Roderic, too, was near. At the open window of the drawing room, his figure screened by the drapery, he sat, gazing intently on 'the features of the fair teacher. He had chosen this position that she might not observe him, for his presence at such a time might embarrass her.. It was hard for him to realize, even then, that she would soon be indeed his; so many misfortunes had befallen him, he scarcely allowed himself to look forward to anything with certainty. Meanwhile, the older darkies were holding forth in uncle Jim's cabin ; the domicil farthest removed from the main building. A "revival" had been going on at an African church in the neighborhood for a week past, and a few of the " brethren and sisters" had assembled for the purpose of holding class-meeting. A new preacher, whom the negroes addressed as Mr. Betts, opened the servioes by, the reading of a hymn. ,i Mr. Betts" was not ashamed to acknowledge that he had no " book lear in' "; he had often been heard to declare, "dat edeqbtion was not needed to change de heart,"' and, although deficient on that point himself, and seldom ashamed to confess his ignorance, he Always held the book before him, when giving out a hymn he knew by heart. "Mr. Betts'" had a large stock of originality about  &#xD;<pb n="460-461" xml:id="VAC7466-00000231"/> 4'60      EMMA BARTLETT: OR, him; and for this reason he found some difficulty in remembering the exact words of anything he undertook to quote. Those of his hearers who boasted retentive memories, often smiled when he undertook to "line " the verses. On this occasion he rose with great solemnity, settled on his nose the spectacles he never wore except when officiating in a ministerial capacity, gave three protracted a-hems, directed his gaze to the book he held bottom upward, and in a sepulchral tone gave out: "God moves in a susterious way, His wonders to a fo 'm; He plants one foot on de sandy sea-sho'e, And the other away 'out in de warter." Uncle Jim struck up the tune, and the rest joined in without delay; their rich, full voices gave a sweet mel- ody to those words, perverted as they were.   Several successive verses were sung, and then "Mr. Betts" arose to relate his experience. "Beloved brethren and sisters," he began, "I've hearn folks say, dey wasn't :called to preach, but my hearers, it is a lie, 'cause here I stands a livin' sample of de truf: In fo'mer years I was a ba'ber, followin' my profession in an unpretendin' way, but one night, arter I'd done shot up my shop, and laid down, all 'lone by myse'f, I hearn a voice callin', I John Boler Betts.'

De third time it spoke, 'John Boler Betts, de ba'ber, I commands you to go and preach de Gospel.' I felt de ha'r stand straight up on my head, when it said dat, and I sez, ' Yes Lo'd' cause I knowd it was me den. Mr. Betts sat down, overpowered by what he had said, while one of the congregation struck up a favor- ite melody, the words of which seemed familiar to all. ,'O! dis is a tryin' time, O! dis is a tryin' time, O! dis is a tryin' time, O!. dis is a tryin' time, my Lo'd, To set all aroun' de throne.

She had been a "wild harum-scarum thing," as aunt Molly said, "(-never taking time to attend to de interests of her soul." But now the poor creature seemed really in earnest. With a New Testament in her hand, given her the day before by "Mas'r Charles,' she was poring intently over the first passage to which she had opened. Never having been an extensive reader, she had not advanced far in that department of science; she had, moreover, a habit of putting her own construction on  every thing she read. After gazing fixedly at the verse for several min- utes, she read aloud with considerable facility, "And there was war in' Heaven; Mitchell and his angels fought against the dragon; and the dragon fought and his angels, and prevailed not." "Hi!" cried the reader, dropping the hand that held the book, "I knows what dat means, jis' perzac'ly, only de las' part,' and prevailed not.' Now, which does dat mean, de Mitchell it speaks of, or de devil? I be. lieve, yes," she added, emphatically, scratching her head, "dis nigger knows he couldn't have whipped any of our family, 'cause dey allers had de clean grit. But maybe," she went on, thoughtfully, "de dragon don't meanl de ole boy-here.

After a little hesitation the negro began, "And there was war in heaven; Mitchell -" "Michael, aunt Edny, Michael." "Lor', no 'taint, Mas'r Charles, is it?" burst from her lips, while the deepest disappointment was depicted on her dark face. ,' Wasn't it some of your family that lived far back?" A smile lit up Mr. Mitchell's handsome features. ' So you thought some of our folks had been fighting there, did you?" "Yes, I was shore of it; and Mas'r Charles, I b'lieve it yit, only de folks dat wrote dis did'nt know how to spell your name," and without waiting to hear his hardly probable, aunty," she quickly retraced her steps.  &#xD;<pb n="464-465" xml:id="VAC7466-00000233"/> "4      EMMA BARTLETT: OR, An hour passed away; still Mr. Mitchell sat there, absorbed in his own meditations. "Uncle," said a soft voice near him. He started and looked round; Emma was at his side. "What is it, love?" he asked, with a father's ten- derness.   . "Roderic and' have been talking-about Kate," she added after pausing a moment, as though doubtful about Mr. Mitchell's approval of what she wanted to propose. "Well, Emma, what of her?" "We want you to let her go with us, uncle! Away over the blue ocean to Roderic's home. O! I'm sure it would do her good." The enthusiastic girl looked beseechingly in his face as she spoke, but he only shook his head, saying he could not trust his daughter so far away from him. Emma saw by his manner that entreaty would be use- less, and urged no further. "But another thing, uncle," she went on, "I want to request. Will you promise to comply this time? it is with regard to myself." "If possible." "Didn't I hear you say Mr. Selgrove had been 'Squire since 'Squire Thornton moved away?" "It is very probable, for such is the case."

"Why, what's the matter, Emma, what can it be that embarrasses you so??" "Hold your ear, uncle, and I can whisper it." Mr. Mitchell obeyed; the ruby lips were pressed close to his cheek, and in the softest of whispers Emma brought her sentence to a close. "Officiate at your marriage!" exclaimed the listener. "H-u-s-h, uncle, how loud you speak," she said, play- fully putting her hand over his mouth. "You should have a minister, child!" were the words that, despite her strenuous efforts, glided through the snowy fingers. "Yes, but this is why I want him," and again the coral lips approached his ear. "If I can gain his consent, it shall be as you desire," was the- reply.  &#xD;<pb n="466-467" xml:id="VAC7466-00000234"/>      EMMA BARTLETT: OR, CHAPTER XXXVII. THE  WEDDING. IT was dreamy, calm, beautiful Autumn The birds were asleep in their nest; The breeze, gliding off to the brookside, Lay down on the pebbles to rest. When Emma stood trembling before them, A blushing, a beautiful bride, Her vail making softer the blushes It vainly endeavored to hide. From her lips, that were parted so slightly A thought could scarce flit through the space Came a sound that they fancied resembled The joy that illumined her face. Her soft eyes reminded the gazer Who drank in their soul-cheering beams, Of beings created by fancy, Or only beheld in our dreams. IT was on one of those deliciously cool evenings in the beginning of September, that come gliding into the sul- try season, as a forerunner of the approaching autumn, that Emma Bartlett gently threw aside the bridal veil that fluttered over her cheek, and, taking the proffered arm of her lover, came flitting into the presence of the assembled company, seeming more like a spiritual form from  a loftier sphere, than the bright reality she was. S   PREJUDIC AE D FANATIOISM.     467 Brilliantly illuminated were those spacious parlors, with their rich velvet carpets, and blossom-crowded vases. Old and young were there; for, although but a limited number had been invited, the rooms seemed fall to over- flowing. The walls were literally lined with dark figures, whose glistening eyes and white turbans formed a stri- king contrast with the ebony heads and faces they adorned. Aunt Edny was there, with her plethoric form encased in a new gingham, gaudy as a butterfly and boasting every color of the rainbow. Uncle Jim, too, occupied a conspicuous place, and, as usual, exhibited his wealth of ivory whenever it was practicable. Occasionally, how- ever, an expression of deep concern would rest on his dark features, for he was full of apprehensions about Molly, his wife. He had communicated his fears to aunt Jinny, after this wise, before the company began to gather: Molly, allers would shout," he said, when- ever she heard a good pra'r; she'd shouted de day Miss Mary was buried. When de preacher had said de serv- ants would meet their mistress in de Kingdom 'bove, Molly had clapped her han's and shouted, (Yes, bress de Lo'd, we'll all be white thar'!' and he thought then it had hurt Mas'r Charles' feelin's to see her takin' on so. An' now, aunt Jinny," he went on, " she'll be shore to make a fuss at de weddin', ef we don't keep her down." Aunt Jinny, cross and ill-natured as she was, had deigned to honor the assembly with her presence.

Bob can't! She's too good for any one " then covering, his distorted features with his stubby fingers, he sobbed convulsively. Aunt Jinny, who had kept "t clost to Molly," at uncle Jim's request, now shifted her position into Bob's neigh- borhood. , "Hush up, yer fool nigger!" she whispered, giving him a vigorous shake. ' You'll spile it all!" But- Bob, poor soul, couldn't; the fountain of feeling had been stirred, and in spite of himself, its waters would gush forth. Although aunt Jinny's threatening look might annihilate him, he could not wholly suppress his grief. Mr. Mitchell was toodeeply affected by what was transpiring, to observe Bob's trouble.' Even had his gaze been attracted downward he-might not have noticed the boy, for -the moisture in his own eye rendered every- thing indistinct. There was something wanting in that assembled group; an absent form; a missing voice. Kate, the cherished daughter, the only child, was not there. She- had begged Fmma -to excuse her, when urged to be in attendance; she felt she -was not strong enough to witness such a scene.  It, would bring: painful o   PRBEJEDICE AND FANATICIM.     469 associations back, and 'twas better that- they should slumber, she said, with the sweet smile of resignation that of late had often lighted up her features. Mrs. Bartlett never looked more tranquilly happy than upon: Emmlnas -bridal eve. The fair girl had seemed doubly dear to her since the evening of Rode- ric's arrival, when, after communicating to Kate -the painful intelligence of her lover's death, and waiting till she grew calmer, she had hastened to her mother's side, and nestling close to her bosom, like a frightened bird, had confessed to her all she had suffered since the dawn of love's first dream; how often she had yearned to unbosom herself, yet dared not, on account of the prejudice she feared existed in her mother's mind against the nation to which he belonged; how painful had been the revelation Lena had made; how, after she had learned it, she had striven to forget Roderic; how she had written and told him all; and how, when at length Dare arrived, she had postponed relating it all to her till she awoke, and had wandered off alone to collect her perturbed thoughts, and ask for Divine assistance, and then how Roderic had found her there, and explained every thing. Mrs. Bartlett had wept as-she listened to these heart- struggles, and when Emma then, for the first time related the visit the minister and she had made during Roderic's sickness, in order to tell her when she first heard him  repeat Rosalie's name, the foster mother  &#xD;<pb n="470-471" xml:id="VAC7466-00000236"/> 47Q0      EMMA BARTLETT: OB, understood at length why it was that her husbaznd had learned to regard Mr. Sundahl suspiciously, and why he had said, "I Beware of the German."- And, on the very eveningh Emma had made a full confession, Mrs. Bartlett had hadl the extreme pleasure of adding the last drop to the cup of happiness her daughter had begun to quaff, by communicating to her what Mr, Mitchell had learned of Mr. Selgrove with regard to the ceremony that united Rosalie to Adam Dare; and furthermore, by placing in Emma's hands the marriage certificate that the " young Judge " of former years had little difficulty in procuring, inasmuch as it had been carefully preserved, not only because it reminded him of the first two he had ever pronounced one, but because looking upon it he could recall the night on which he aroused from the lethargy into which he had fallen, and, urged on by the dying words of his lost Adelia, he had determined to suffer and be strong. Mr. Selgrove looked unusually pale, as he repeated the ceremony that joined the kindred spirits of Roderic Sundahl and Emma Bartlett together. It was not from choice that he stood up in that capacity; Emma had urged her request until he consented to officiate. - Very impressively did he utter those words, for with start- ling  distinctness did the past come up, when one as young and beautiful as the bride presented herself for the same purpose. How strange that, after so many years, -he should   PREJUDICE AND FANATICISM.     471 perform the same ofifce toward two so closely related! There was something more than the solemnity of the occasion that caused a shadow to linger on that high intellectual forehead. He, too, missed the absent one, and having by experience learned the same sad lesson, a deep sympathy was awakened in his bosom; and he found himself more than once during the evening, fra- ming words of comfort he longed to breathe into her ear. The- ceremony ended, a venerable minister offered up a fervent prayer for the prosperity and happiness of the two just beginning to tread life's paths together. As he touched on the approaching separation from friends, broken sobs were heard in different parts of the room. Bob's grief burst out at length in a deep wail, which aunt Jinny tried in vain to quiet. Shet up, Bob!" she whispered, " aint ye 'shamed pesterin' de whole comp'ny? Ef ye dont hush, I pitch ye clean o0t of doo's;" and aunt Jinny partly arose from her knees to execute her threat. "'Do, aunt Jinny, do!" came from the quivering lips of the sobbing one, "tote me anywhar," 'he added, beseechingly, wiping his eyes with his apron sleeve. Yes, poor little fellow, he was willing to go any- where, that the pent up tears might flow freely. We have both felt so, many a time when children, reader, you and I.

Bob thought so, especially when he found aunt Jinny had no idea of either ,' pitchin' " or "' packin " him out, and -when, after a short time, he ventured to raise his head, and peep through his fingers, he discovered she was not there. Uncle Jim's worst fears were about to be-realized. He had watched Molly narrowly from the time she kneeled down; -and now, as her body began to sway backward and forward, he knew well what was coming. "Glory! "Molly, Molly! hush!" said uncle Jim, the deepest anxiety depicted on his face. "Glory, glory!" shouted Molly, increasing the mo- tion of her body; and bringing her hands together. - "Mas'r Charles lookin'," persisted Jim. "Glory, glory, glory!" shouted Molly. "Let: me thar," said aunt Jinny, sliding round to the side of the rejoicing one. "She's-only a pertendin'!'" That insinuation was enough; it was more than Molly could endure. Suddenly ceasing her rapid mo- tion, she dropped her hands, unclosed her eyes, and looking indignantly at her accuser, was about to deny the charge, when the "amen " was spoken, and the assembly arose from their knees, The prayer ended and congratulations over, the com- pany began to disperse themselves in groups, and   PREJUDICE AND FANATICISM.     48 engage in conversation.; A band of smiling faces col- lected around the bride, and each in turn propounded some query with regard to her anticipated journey. "What in the world was she going to do when she got over there?  She would be obliged to confine her remarks to her husband and mother for a season, for was she not entirely unacquainted with the language? Would she set to work in good earnest, when she arrived, and study unremittingly until she had mas- tered it?" While engaged in pleasant badinage with the gayest of them, Emma suddenly arose, hurried to the opposite side of the room, where a young girl had seated her- self at the piano, and was just in the act of running her fingers over the keys, laid her hand upon her arm, and said, "' Not any music to-night, Bettie; Kate can hear it in her room, and- it affects her painfully." "O! exclaimed the young girl, rising, "Fm glad you interrupted me." And thus it happened that the hours of Emma's bri- dal eve were not whiled away by the gushes of music or of song. But the fair bride heeded it not! The love- light in her eye burned just as brightly, and, to the bridegroom, the soft accents to which she gave utterance were just as sweet as if they had been syllabled in song. Unutterably happy was he as he sat by her side, and said to his heart, that still beat half doubtingly, "She is indeed mine.! my long coveted treasure."

And which of us, reader, shall say he was not right? Who shall say, that the disembodied spirit of his lost Rosalie, was not permitted by the Mighty One, to become the guardian angel of her child, and from the moment the marriage vow was breathed, was commissioned to extend her pro- tecting wings over both; thus keeping a holy charge over her two earthly jewels, until commanded to trans- port them to the diadem above. Roderic forgot, as he sat musing, that his youth had fled, leaving him with -the seal of two score years upon his brow; and when Emma, who had for the first time during the evening been left alone with him, leaned forward, and softly asked, , Are you-happy, Roderie?" the warm blood stirred about his heart, just as it would have done had he but just entered the first stages of manhood, The warm, trusting, loving heart never grows old  Care and anxiety may come, aad change the exterior, but, like the ocean, when the storm makes wild havo with its surface, the waters far down in its hidden doepth flow on as tranquilly as if the tempest had not swept by.

This we will imitate; this we will hold As a boon we esteem far more precious than goid. THERE was much more hurry and activity among the servants at Deerwood than usual, on the morning fol- lowing the wedding. Each one seemed intent on per- forming some little-act of kindness for the bride, before she took her departure ; for, aside from the regard they felt, each one had in turn received some little parting gift. Emma had separately taken every dark palm in her own, and turning to her uncle and aunt had breathed a tearful good-by, before she ascended to Kate's chamber. "Kate, darling!" she saidextending her arms. "Dear Emma!" sobbed the cousin, convulsively, rushing into them. ',O! Emma, Emma! this is ter- rible! Shall we never meet again?" '; Yes, Katie, we will meet again!" The voice was scarcely audibl. "Look above dear cousin t  Do not despond.

Emma strained that dear form close to her bosom, pushed back her wealth of raven hair, pressed one long fervent kiss upon her lips, and gently releasing herself, hurried away. She was just ascending the carriage steps when a hand was laid on her dress. Dashing the moisture from her eyes, she looked round. "Far'well, Miss Emma! I wants to be de las' to say it to yer," and Bobis streaming eyes were bent earnestly upon her face. 6"Good-by, Bob; be a good boy," was all she could say. A moment afterward, with her head buried on her hus- band's shoulder, she gave vent to her surcharged feelings. Mr. Mitchell had suggested that they. should set sail from a Southern port, but Roderic had objected, for two reasons.  One was, he knew Mrs. Bartlett would be anxious to make a parting visit to her husband's grave, and the other he promised to explain when they reached the ship. "It was so thoughtful of Roderic," said Mrs. Bartlett, with the bright tear-drops glistening in her eyes, as, on the afternoon of the same day on which they arrived in Boston, herself and daughter emerged from- the shades of Mount Auburn, that beautiful resting place for the dead, where they had stood hand in hand beside the spot where reposed the' sacred ashes of the departed, and murmured their farewells. Roderic had not accompanied them out, but entrusting them to the care of an experi-    PREJUDICE AND FANATICISM.    4" fenced driver, had taken that opportunity of transacting some business of importance in Boston. 4 There were two promises he 'was bent on fulfilling that afternoon; one had been made to aunt Edny, before he left the South, the other he had exacted of himself. He resolved to execute aunt Edny's commission first, and accordingly took from his trunk a small bundle, placed it under his arm, and wended his way to the store of Mr. Adam  Dare. The merchant was not at home; he accordingly presented himself before the Rev. Josiah Dare, who had taken charge of his son's business during his absence. But the message he would have delivered to his former employer was suppressed, for he had no desire to wound the feelings of the white haired sire who stood in his place. He merely -said, as he handed him the bun- dle, that there were some shirts of his son's, he had been requested to leave at the store, and turned to take his departure. But the father called him back. --"Have you seen Adam?  Did you come from  Brighton?" he asked, anxiously. Mr. Sundahl replied in the negative. "I had a letter yesterday, and it said he was very low with fever. I thought you might have brought later news," he added, with the deepest concern. "No," replied Roderic, touched by   the father's  &#xD;<pb n="478-479" xml:id="VAC7466-00000240"/> 48     - -BMMA BARTLETT: OR, anxious manner; "I have not seen him for a month. He left these while in the Southl" "Then you don't know where he is? ' said Mr. Dare, in a disappointtone.  "No," was the reply; , I wish it were in my power to relieve your anxiety; but I am unable to do so," and turuing away he left the poor old gentleman in as much suspense as when he came.  Not until a month had passed away was that suspense ended by the startling news that Adam was no more. It -was hard for him to. realize this fearful certainty at the time, for the letter received only a few days previous, informing him of Nellie's death, had stated that his son had recovered. He was, therefore, wholly unprepared for this double affliction, that rendered him, all at once, as it were, childless; and many painful regrets mingled themselves with his reflections, that he had not been a more devoted father to the two entrusted to his care. When he looked back, and recollected how much of his time had been spent in schemes of philanthropy, espe- cially during those years when the minds of his children were developing, and'how little care and instruction they had received, he felt that, could they be restored for a little time, he would freely dismiss from his thoughts all his plans for the amelioration of his colored brethren, ink order to make some reparation for his past neglect. "And yet," he mused, ,s with all my remissneqs, Adam   PREJUDICE AND FANATICISM.     479 turned out well I He. was strictly temperate, moral, and virtuous. His conduct, -as far as I ever learned, was always exemplary. It is true, I did not notice him much after he was grown, but then I was very rigid in my discipline when his habits were forming, That accounts for it all." And, after administering this palliative to his Conscience, the father set about winding up the busi- ness of the deceased. A leaving the minister, Mr. Sundahl proceeded to execute his self-exacted promise. This was, to find Mrs. Bartlett's former servant, Lena, and request her to accompany the m. It proved more of an undertaking than he anticipated; but finally, after an hour's faithful search, she was found. Lena, who had never been satisfied since she left Mrs. Bartlett's service, joyfiully acceded, especially when she learned the good lady herself was to bear them company, She readily assented to Mr. Sundahl's proposition i which was, that she should be in readiness early next morning, in order that he might take her to the ship, before he amxmpanied his, wife and mother there. They would both feel sad on leaving their native land, and he wished it as a surprise. "We are almost ready, Roderic,' said Eimma, that evening on his return, as she hastened forward to meet him. "There is one thing more mother and I do so desire,.

"We are both so anxious to see Lena," she said, re- turning his look of love. "Do you think it would be difficult to find her?" It is rather late, love, I am afraid." A peculiar s  eplayed over his handsome features as he spoke. "Well, then, in the morning," she suggested, while a slight shade of disappointment was discernible on her face. "Yes, in the morning," he repeated, without seeming to notice her expression of countenance. But when morning came Roderic appeared to forget; at least he did not mentions Lena's name; and, as he was so busy making preparations for departure, Mrs. Bart- lett begged Elmma not to refer to it again. Neither, however, felt wholly satisfied when they- found themselves on shipboard; they had hoped to the last that he would recollect it; but now it was too late, and theyI must become reconciled, for -they would probably never again behold their faithful servant. "Whereis Roderic, mother?" asked Trmma, anxiously, as sihe for the first time missed himfrom her side. Mrs. Bartlett did not know. "( Is it not possible he may have gone on shore, and may e .left?" she asked, alarmed at his sudden disap pearance., "No, dear! don't allow yourself to be needlessly fig*htenedx   PREJWDICIE AND FANATICISM.    481 But look, mother! they are preparing to sail, and he-  - where can he be?" and second time she looked earnestly around. "Here, Emma, look!"   As the bride turned to behold her husband, Mrs. Bartlett started forward, exclaiming, "Can it be-can it be possible! why, Lena." The merry sparkle in Lena's eyes had not been dimmed for months, until that moment; but then a mist came over them, as she grasped Mrs. Bartlett's extended hand. - "Dear Roderic, how you frightened me!"cried the bride, who only saw her husband, just then; but in the same breath she exclaimed, "Lena, Lena! is it indeed you? How came you to kntw we were here?" Lena could not reply; offering Emma the disengaged hand she nodded to Mr. Sundahl.' "He found you, then?" she ejaculated, turning to Roderic, who bad stepped back. "But see," she con- tinued, as the ship began to move, " they have started. O! Lena, you will never get back." i, She has -no desire to, Emma; she is\ going with us." It was Roderic's low voice that said this. The mother and daughter both looked at him an instant; they saw a smile play about his mouth, and understood it all. Releasing Lena's hand, they both grasped his. Tears of gratitude arose to Mrs. Bartlett's eyes, and she said, "  &#xD;<pb n="482-483" xml:id="VAC7466-00000242"/> S9      - - 'oIFM I A BARNBS': OlR, .- in a voice hoarse with feeling, "God bless you for this, my son." "Dear Roderic, how kind!" burst from Emma's lips, as she clasped her hand in his. The fond husband quickly returned the pressure of the waxen fingers that fluttered in his own, and placing A: j his lips close to her ear, he whispered softly, "This was why I insisted on coming by the way of Boston, dear." "Was it?"Emma's eyes were raised lovingly and wonderingly to his face. Mrs. Bartlett and Lena found much to talk about,' and drawing his fair bride aside, Roderic pointed to the receding shore. "Look, Emma, you can now say with Byron- ' Adieu, adieu! my native land Fades o'er the waters blue.'" Emma gazed in silence. There was a strange tumult in her bosom she could not exactly define. After all, it was a greater trial than she had anticipated to see her native shores recede. She had imagined with Rod- eric and. her mother near her, she could breathe fare-, well to Columbia 'without a struggle. But she was mistaken. Although her young heart was full of hap piness, and although the two dearest on earth were with, her, still the patriotic fire that warms the breast of every true American, burned brightly in her bosom,   PRBE llIEB B A"T FANMSM.     481 and as she watched the distant church tops until they disappeared in the distance, with Byron she could also say, "Their spires were scarcely seen through a tear." "It is a beautiful country, Emma," said Roderic, passing his arm around her, "you have given up much." 4"And have found more," she quickly replied, resting her head on his bosom, " infinitely more," she repeated, with emphasis, "( henceforth my home is here," anrid she nestled closer as she spoke. "I shall always love America above any other coun- try, - Roderic," she said, after a short silence, as she lifted her head from its resting place, " it is my native clime;. the land of liberty, the birth-place of our im- mortal Washington. I shall never have cause to be ashamed to acknowledge this." "God grant that it may be so!" said the husband, ernestfly, " that no party faction may arise to dishonor the name of freedom's sons, or rend that glorious stluab tare of freedom in twain. You have lived both it the North and South, Emma. Would it not pain you, if at some future day you should hear that the Union was dissolved?  "It would, indeed," she returned seriously. "Do yotu, like Mr. Selgrove, apprehend any danger?" "There are influences at work, Emma, that may iead to it.

If I could only talk like a man, I would give you my-rsentiments. But wait a minute. If you will give me a little time to think, and then furnish me with paper and pencil, I'll write some impromptu verses right here, while a -faint outline of old Boston is still in view." "Bravo! my bonnie bride, do! and if you'll allow it, I'll be your amanuensis." "No, thank you," she returned, bowing, ' I have a way of my own when I compose. I always play with the edge of my paper, and bite at the end of my pencil. "By way of eliciting ideas," interposed Roderic, smiling.  "Put whatever construction on it you choose, only promise -to stand near me, ready to hold mne back if I should be seized with a sudden desire to plunge-into the water. There always was a fascination to me in gazing into the watery depths, and often when a child, on my way from  school, I've wandered down to the beach, watching steadfastly the bubbling waves and longing to plunge into the, sparkling foam at- my feet."

I would not give way to such feelings for all the world.   But now for this mighty production. You must keep a profound silence while I invoke the muses. Now I've begun." As the fair speaker said this, she placed herself in an attitude of thinking, and after I a protracted silence, produced the following: O! talk not to me of disunion and strife In the land I with pride call my own! Far sooner, I ween, would each son risk his life, Than to see that great fabric overthrown. For deep in the heart of each patriot one Has an altar to freedom been reared; - And a fire there burneth unceasingly on, That all thoughts of disunion has seared.

Yes, farewell forever! Your Webster hath spoke, And prophesy's words will prove true; For once let the chalice of Union be broke, And contention will scatter the dew That peace and good feeling so long have distilled From the blossoms of brotherly love; - Whose nectarine sweetness your bosoms has filled, And warmed like the nest ofe ah dove. b . w^  &#xD;<pb n="486-487" xml:id="VAC7466-00000244"/> B  Diasev, the Union!

Dissever the Union! No, sooner by far Let sweet harmony join them in one; Let the spirit that made them the nation they are, Impel and encourage them on. Let the wings of our eagle flap proudly the while, As he steadfastly soars toward the sun  And the Goddess of Liberty watch with a smile O'er the head of each patriot one. / "There, Roderic, my patriotism    has well nigh  ex- hausted itself.

EMMA S LETTER. IT was Christmas morning, and the cheerful blaze from the hickory logs that lay on the andirons threw a genial light over the sitting-room at Deerwood. Mr. Selgrove was its only occupant. He had called over to wish his friends a happy Christmas; but finding Mr. and Mrs. Mitchell had gone to town, with the intention, however, of return- ing very soon, he threw himself upon the lounge with the familiarity of an old friend, and took up a newspaper to while away the time. He had not asked for- Miss Mitchell; he seldom did now; several times, when he had called she had been present, and he had experi- enced the same quit joy in her society that her presence had always produce&amp;. If anything, he seemed to admire her more, for the proud, haughty curl of her lip had passed away, leaving in its stead a calm, sweet smile, that softened the whole countenance. But William Sel- grove understood and appreciated her sorrow too fully to obtrude himself on her notice. Not for the universe would he, by word or action, pain her, while this cloud of grief hung over her; he would wait patiently, and if., as time dragged on, she should continue to brood over   -                  f PREJUDICE AND FANATICISM.     489 this, her first heart-trial, why then he must relinquish t  all hope of gaining her affections. Mr. Selgrove glanced at the paper he had picked up, read the name first, and then the motto underneath: "Put none but Americans on guard to-night," then with an air of impatience tossed it aside. "Fiddlesticks! what an idea to be harping on! How preposterous for a party to bring this\up against foreigners! What unpre- judiced mind can take into consideration the time at which that was spoken, and say our immortal Washing- ton was actuated by motives as contracted as those by whichh this ' new organization' is governed! What a per- version of words! Was not that injunction intended to apply as much to the (native born) tories, as to a foreign enemy? Who can doubt, had the gallant La Fayette, or any of those brave French volunteers proffered to stand onguard, tht the Commander-in chief would have gladly accepted (heir services.

While Mr. Selfrove soliloquized thus in the sitting, room, Katihe   ll sat in her own chamber alone, with an open letter in her hand.

A long-drawn sigh followed these words, and raising the letter from- her lap, she re-read several paragraphs: "I wish you had been with us, Katie, when we first visited the old family mansion. It was on the day after our arrival. Mother went with us, of course, and she seemed to listen with as much pleasure as myself to Roderic's glowing description of the girlish form that once flitted through its ancient halls. He spoke, too, (Katie, darling, I do not fear to write his name now, for I know you have learned to rely on the Rock of Ages), of a beautiful boy with nut-brown hair, whose childish gambols so often made those old corridors ring; whose wonder-waking eyes, during his early years, were so often peering curiously among the surrounding ver- dure, when his notice was attracted by some  modest flower half hidden in its emerald couch ; whose listening ear was forever snatching up some of the whispered words of love that the evening  zephyrs are wont to breathe to the timid birds while dreaming in the tree tops.  Roderic described it all in his fascinating, poetic way; (he's a dear, precious fellow, Katie ; the best hus- band in the world, coz!) and  then at the soft, dewy twilight hour he led us to the resting place of his   PREJUDICE AND' FANATICISM.     491 betrothed, his Rosalie. I was strangely affected as I stood there. Beneath my feet rested the sacred dust of my own mother, and at my side stood my dear foster-parent. To me, Rosalie, (I always think of her by that name, because it is the one Roderic applies to her), seemed some bright ideality, the seraphic creature of some beautiful, half-remembered dream, and because she was my mother, and because Roderic loved her, I felt a quiet, holy love flowing out as it were to her memory. But when I turned to the dear form that had bent over me since infancy, and saw the soft blue eye, dimmed by a tear, I felt that my darling, living mother possessed a far greater portion of my heart than any one else, except my Roderic. And when for the first time I saw him take her hand, and controlling the visible emotion that agitated him, pour into her ear a whole volume of thanks for the tender care bestowed on ' his Rosalie and Emma,' and when in return, I for the first time heard her speak of the strange interest she felt in the unprotected orphan whom Providence had directed to her door, and of the deep, abiding love that sprang up in her bosom for the babe she entrusted to her keeping- I couldn't restrain myself a minute- longer, Kate! I just wound my arms around both their necks, and drawing their faces close to mine, I managed to kiss them both at once. Then we all three sat down on Rosalie's tomb and mingled our tears together.

I felt that blessed twilight eve that Heaven was nearer earth than ever before. "But I have not told you all. When we went back to our own dear home, Roderic escorted us to his own private study, (Ptwas the only room in the vast building I hadn't peeped into), and as we entered, he drew aside some gauze suspended from the side of the wall, reveal- ing--what think you, Katie?-why, two of the most beautiful pictures I ever beheld. They were set in massive gilt frames and hung side by side. Mother uttered an exclamation of surprise, and sprang forward; Istood transfixed. I knew, from the resemblance to the daguerreotype in my possession, that one was Rosa-. lie. Roderic passed his arm around me, and we both remained speechless. There they were-my two moth- ers, gazing at each other; both with soft, meek, loving blue eyes, and a smile of ineffable sweetness playing about their lips. And when mother turned with a radi- ant countenance to me, I hardly knew which was the lovelier; the departed parent with her wealth of gol- den ringlets, her lithe, girlish figure, and the sweet   PREJUDICE AND FANATICISM.     493 v .      r expression of her face as she looked down at me; or the living mother, with her light brown tresses, a few of which had been silvered by the one great sorrow of her life; her matronly form and the look of unutter- able love she gave me, illuminating her features with a holy light. "The other picture represented a child of some five Summers. The soft white brow, the peachy cheeks, the full red lips, must have been very beautiful, Kate. But I will write no further about this, dear one. You will come to Germany one of these days, wont you? And then I will take you to Roderic's study, where you can gaze upon the little Karl as long as you desire." A knock at the door interrupted the reader. It was answered, and Bob presented himself. Well, Bob, what is it?" Bob's eyes were fairly dancing with delight. "O! Miss Kate, I couldn't hold in no longer, I couldn't!" "Why, what is it, Bob? What pleases you so?

True, he had not asked for her, and at a former period her pride would have scoffed at the idea of presenting herself without a desire having been expressed, but was it niot her own indifferent manner that had caused Mr. Selgrove to cease. inquiring? When she began to review her conduct toward him for some time- past, she was not sure that that gentleman did not positively dis-. like her; she had taken so little pains to preserve his regard.  This thought was painful to her, for she respected her father's friend too much to be willing to lose his esteem, There was but one thing left that she could do, and that was to make reparation. She would go directly down, tell him she had heard from her cousin and aunt, and if he desired it, would read to him the legend Emma had related. Full of these resolutions, she descended to the sitting-room. Mr. Selgrove was agreeably surprised at her unex- pected appearance. He had thrown aside the paperl taken a chair nearer the mantle-piece, tipped it back, (Southern fashion), and sent his thoughts off to the past.

This must serve as an apology for my apparent neglect. I wish you a merry Christmas." "The same to you, Miss Kate," he returned, bowing as he took the extended hand. "I have just been thinking," he went on, resuming his seat, "of the merry Christmases I used to pass when a boy in New England. Your parents are out, I learned." "Yes, and it just occurred to me that I might enter- tain you until father's return, by reading to- you one part of a letter I received to-day from Emma." "Ah! indeed! How does she like her new home? ' "O! she is charmed--perfectly delighted with every thing.  If you think it will interest you, I will read you a brief description of one of her jaunts since her arrival,' Mr. Selgrove said he would be delighted to hear it, and Miss Mitchell forthwith begun: "O!  Kate, we had such a pleasant jaunt yesterday to an old fortress, called Plassenburg! It is situated in the beautiful valley of the Mai'n, and commands an extended view of the surrounding country. You can see from  its top, towns, valleys, mountains, meadows, forests, and the sparkling waters of the Main winding in every direction.

As I have prom- ised to communicate to you ' every thing I see and hear,' I feel it 'eumbent on me,' (as aunt Jinny used to say), to relate this to the best of my ability. You tnustl know, first, that all these old castles have one or more legends connected with them. Well, as the story books begin,' once upon a time' George the first of Culen- bach, a kind-hearted sovereign, married the proud prin- ciss Matilda of-Fulda. They had two children, who are said to have been exceedingly beautiful. George the First died when the eldest was four years old, the youngest two. Matilda, more after the fashions of the times, than for any sincere regret, (for her husband and self were but illy suited to each other), put on mourning alnd kept herself in seclusion for a whole year. "Some time afterward, a tournament was held, at the suggestion of Albrecht, Burgrave of Nuremberg, one of the bravest and handsomest men of his time. To this exciting festival all the beauty and valor of 3ranconia,and Saxony had been invited. Matilda had once before met the brave Albrecht, and fully conscious of her surpassing beauty and elegance, had made sure of making a conquest. But a girl of Saxon origin was- destined to gain without artifice the heart of Albrecht. She possessed neither the beauty nor position ofI Matilda, but greatly surpassed her both in intelli- gence and goodness. EMany were the plots the latter wove -in order to draw Albrecht from his purpose.

Matilda,how. ever, interpreted this as objecting to her two children. Although she had always evinced an excessive fondness for them, she resolved to sacrifice them rather than have her wishes frustrated. A number of times she attempted the direful deed before she accomplished it. Finally the two children died upon the sami night, without previous sickness. A waiting lady suspected the foul deed, and on examination found that the child- ren had been killed by pins being pierced near the eyes into the brain. The priest was forthwith acquainted with the fact, and when questioned with regard to it, the culprit, overpowered by remorse, confessed all. "A committee of investigation was appointed by the Emperor, but Matilda, being of an ancient princely house, and withall, sincerely penitent, was permitted to live, on condition that she would travel on her knees from her castle of Plassenberg to the convent of Him- melkron, some eight miles distant, and enrol her name among the nuns. This arduous journey was cheerfully performed, and she remained there until her death. "After that event, a lady dressed in black was seen at the hour of midnight wandering through the apawt. ments of the castle. Gradually, the dress became lighter, until at last it was perfectly white; and at length he ceased altogether to make her -appearance   PREJUDICE AND FANA TIOISM.    499  "From this circumstance she received- the name of the White Lady. "The legend says this apparition was the once haughty Matilda, who, on account of her deep guiltand sinfulness, first appeared in black, but being gradually drawn to God, and her iniquities washed away, she was at length, when purified and. made mete for His king- dom, allowed to enter the heaven of rest." "What wild, beautiful ideas we may sometimes gather from those German legends," said Mr. Selgrove, as the reader finished. "I have always said, I should never be satisfied until I made a tour of the continent, and I shall certainly take the 'Fatherland' in my rounds, when I go. Who knows but I may meet your cousin again, Miss Kate?" "It w6uld not be improbable.  Mr. Selgrove, I believe my cousin is as near perfection as we poor mor- tals ever attain here. I am so rejoiced to learn that she is happy. ! I wish I could more closely imitate her example!" "And can you not," asked the other, in a low, earnest voice, "strive, as she did, to be cheerful and happy " "O! I did not mean that!" returned Kate, quickly, "I meant I wished to be good like her ." "Yes, of course," he returned; "and then the hap- piness will follow as a natural consequence.

"It is otherwise with woman. Her habits give her many solitary hours for reflection, and unconsciously, though she battles hard against it, she finds herself brooding over the shadow that has fallen across her path. Washington Irving has beautifully said, 'As the dove will clap its wing to its side, and cover and conceal the arrow that is preying upon its vitals, so it is the - nature -of wo-man to' hid'e from the world the pangs of wounded affection; with her the desires of the   PRMtUDICS AND FANATICISM.     601 heart have failed; she neglects all the-cheerful exer- cises that gladden- the spirits, quicken the pulse, and send the tide of life in healthful currents throughi the veins.

Do not imagine, from this, that I consider the struggle through which you have lately been called to pass, ' an idle whim' or foolish conceit.' No, no!

The speaker paused, overcome by his feelings, and as two large, pearly drops fell from the dark lashes that swept over Kate's downcast eyes, Bob presented him- self at the sitting-room door, and announced abruptly, that "Mas'r Charles and Miss Anna had done come." "Please, excuse me, Mr. Selgrove; they will notice these traces of weakness. I thank you very much for your kind sympathy," and laying her hand in his ex- tended palm, she quickly returned the sympathetic pressure, and hurriedly left the apartment. Kind reader, a few words of prophesy and we are done. Though Emma Sundahl has only ventured to hope cousin Kate will visit Germany at some future pe- riod, we are bold enough to predict with certainty that if life be spared, she will, for although at the present time she regards Mr. Selgrove as a " particular friend of the family," the time will come when the sweet angel of sympathy will draw her heart nearer his own, and with her silken fetters bind them in one; and when next the spacious parlors of Deerwood are thrown open to wedding guests, one whose proud spirit has been chastened by sorrow, and whose heart has been purified byAffliction, as was the White Lady of Plassenburg, will stand in the place the gentle Emma once occupied; and, as Mr. Mitchell looks upon the broad intellectual fore- ead of the noble bridegroom, with pride and pleasure will he resign to his keeping 4: only bcil, his idolized daughter, "aunt Milly's pet,"   &#xD;</p>
