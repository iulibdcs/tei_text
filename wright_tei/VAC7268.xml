I HAVE taken the plot and the characters of this nar-&#xD;
rative from the midst of New York life, where they pre-&#xD;
sented themselves to me in a manner undoubtedly more&#xD;
striking and interesting than my talents permit of por-&#xD;
traying. My object, however, is rather to tell a story,&#xD;
than to present a line moral picture with all the proper&#xD;
light and  shade-contrasts between    high  and  low  life.&#xD;
Should any of my characters be recognized by my fellow-&#xD;
citizens, or by the originals themselves, I can only claim&#xD;
that I have attempted to remember their noble and good&#xD;
qualities as well as their vices, and if I have committed&#xD;
injustice, I have erred on the side of good will toward&#xD;
them, and confidence in the better and     purer  side of&#xD;
human nature in general.&#xD;

CHAPTER I.&#xD;
THE MANIAC'S STORY.&#xD;
" Whose horrid image doth unfix my hair,&#xD;
And make my seated heart knock at my ribs,&#xD;
Against the use of nature? Present fears&#xD;
Are lees than horrible imaginings."&#xD;
MACBETH.&#xD;
NEAR the center of the Black Forest in Ger-&#xD;
many, in a wild and remote spot, stands the&#xD;
old, half-crumbled castle of Unkstein, which&#xD;
for many generations had been the home of my&#xD;
ancestors; and my father, the count of Unk-&#xD;
stein, after having lost his fortune, found him-&#xD;
self obliged to choose this, the remnant of his&#xD;
former estates, for a home, where his scant in-&#xD;
come would maintain him, though sparingly&#xD;
indeed. My mother died while I was yet in&#xD;
the cradle. I was an only child, and without&#xD;
a relative in the world, when my father also&#xD;
died, about the time I arrived at the age of&#xD;
manhood.&#xD;
I was a sad enough boy. The influence of&#xD;
my surroundings did not fail to tinge my grow-&#xD;
ing mind with their own characteristics. The&#xD;
gigantic black trees, from which the forest de-&#xD;
rives its dark name, the terrors of the wilder-&#xD;
ness, the awful loneliness of nature, the old&#xD;
castle, my melancholy father, the old house-&#xD;
keeper dressed in black and looking like a&#xD;
ghost,-with such companions what could be&#xD;
more natural than that I should grow up a&#xD;
morose, ill-tempered man, unfit for that bright&#xD;
world which lay somewhere beyond my black&#xD;
trees, and even without desire to go forth and&#xD;
seek society.&#xD;
Superstition and religion meant the same to&#xD;
me. My few servants and poor retainers were&#xD;
under the reign of a rogue of a priest who&#xD;
gleaned my domain and swayed the scepter of&#xD;
his accursed craft without opposition.  My&#xD;
days were spent in praying and eating, and I&#xD;
was fast sinking into a state of imbecility,&#xD;
when an event occurred which woke up my&#xD;
latent mental powers and stirred them to ac-&#xD;
tivity, bringing me an amount of knowledge&#xD;
which has been mistaken for madness, and&#xD;
which has brought me to this prison, where I&#xD;
linger, without hope of release, without one&#xD;
ray of joy. and yet in the perfbet possession&#xD;
&#xD;
of my senses, as this manuscript must show&#xD;
the world.&#xD;
If she would only not come here I Can I&#xD;
never convince the doctor that he and the rest&#xD;
of them are wrong on this one point? Should&#xD;
I not know, I, who have held her a thousand&#xD;
times in these arms; should I not know if her&#xD;
face is a WOlf's instead of a woman's, as it was&#xD;
when I first saw her? But I cannot make&#xD;
them believe it, and they send her to me again&#xD;
and again until I have raved myself sick, until&#xD;
the terror of her white tooth has nearly eaten&#xD;
my life away; until I tried to kill her; and&#xD;
now she only dares to come and grin at me&#xD;
through these bars. Oh, at such times I feel&#xD;
my brain whirl and a living, roaring fire just&#xD;
underneath my skull.&#xD;
It was in the Black Forest, three years ago,&#xD;
that I had the first warning of my life's curse.&#xD;
I had been hunting, and was returning home&#xD;
with an old gamekeeper and my dogs. The&#xD;
sun was setting as we gained the crest of a&#xD;
mountain, whence we could see my castle tow-&#xD;
ering above the trees on an opposite hill. Twi-&#xD;
light and hazy mists were fast obscuring fa-&#xD;
miliar objects as we descended into the valley.&#xD;
The path was narrow, through the black trees,&#xD;
somber and silent like huge monsters at rest,&#xD;
while a shadowy crowd of shapeless things&#xD;
seemed to dodge around their sturdy trunks&#xD;
and flit across our way.&#xD;
Hark ! a rustling of the .leaves; a low&#xD;
growl, a loud bark, and my dogs are off like a&#xD;
flash into the depths of the forest.&#xD;
" What is it,'Hans ?"&#xD;
" A wolf, sir; let's after him," he cried, and&#xD;
hardly could Ilkeep him in sight, so dexterously&#xD;
did lie glide through bush, and branch, and&#xD;
briar, following the baying of the dogs.&#xD;
An exclamation of pity from Hans brought&#xD;
me to where he had just stumbled over the&#xD;
body of my favorite hound. We hurried on,&#xD;
even my slow blood was roused with the de-&#xD;
sire for revenge of my pet.&#xD;
" On, on," cried Hans, brave always, but&#xD;
rarely impetuous ;" we must have him to pay&#xD;
for this!" Ai, it cost him his life, and me&#xD;
more than a thousand lives!&#xD;
We pushed on, recklessly, madly,-losing&#xD;
all sense of fear or danger. We reached an&#xD;
opening in the woods; a flat meadow lay be-&#xD;

R&#xD;
L#&#xD;
&#xD;
fore me, inclosed on every side by a wall of&#xD;
black trees, and with a strange shudder I saw&#xD;
that, though I had known the woods from my&#xD;
boyhood, I had never before come to this&#xD;
clearing.&#xD;
"I hope we have him I" cried Hans, and&#xD;
spoke the last words that ever passed his lips.&#xD;
A wild shriek-a shriek that rings in my ears&#xD;
now-a shriek so terrible that the woods re-&#xD;
echoed it as did my heart-and I saw Hans on&#xD;
the ground, his throat in the huge mouth of a&#xD;
monstrous black wolf.&#xD;
At a distance of about ten feet I fired, without&#xD;
causing the brute to change his murderous po-&#xD;
sition. I made another step, and discharged&#xD;
the other barrel, with the muzzle almost touch-&#xD;
ing his shaggy coat;-he did not seem aware&#xD;
of my presence. It was then that an awful,&#xD;
superhuman fear, came over me; then I became&#xD;
certain that the tales of spirits in the Black&#xD;
Forest were true, and that I now stood face to&#xD;
face with a creature of hell. Spell-bound, I&#xD;
watched that horrid monster with straining&#xD;
eyes, every faculty obscured by terror except&#xD;
that of sight. Vainly endeavoring to rouse&#xD;
myself and flee away, I saw the white teeth&#xD;
leave the throat of my poor Hans, and with a&#xD;
sickening, craunching noise, bury themselves&#xD;
in his breast, and tear out his heart. In un-&#xD;
conscious fulfillment of my destiny, I drew a&#xD;
small pistol, loaded with silver balls by the&#xD;
priest, who assured me that no evil spirit was&#xD;
proof against them, and fired full at the de-&#xD;
mon. With a human groan the wolf bounded&#xD;
into the air and fell-a sudden gust of wind&#xD;
filled the clearing with a dense black fog-it&#xD;
shaped itself-it approached me, and I heard&#xD;
a voice like that of the storm  which now&#xD;
howled around me, shrieking,-&#xD;
" Thou Last killed my son! but I will avenge&#xD;
him."&#xD;
I fled-fled through the woods which all&#xD;
around seemed strange to rae; fled through the&#xD;
storm, and the rain, and the lightning and&#xD;
thunder, which had all awakened as at the call&#xD;
of a master spirit; I thought I heard the wild&#xD;
huntsman riding on the shaggy clouds as they&#xD;
flew before the gale, following close, and spirits&#xD;
innumerable, in hideous shapes, barking and&#xD;
yelling behind me in pursuit. Next morning&#xD;
I was found, by the aid of my faithful hounds,&#xD;
insensible, bruised, and battered by my wild&#xD;
race through the forest, and with scarce a&#xD;
shred of clothing. Yet the bodies of llans,&#xD;
the black wolf, and the dog, could not be&#xD;
found; nor could any one recognize, from my&#xD;
description, the clearing in the woods that had&#xD;
been the.scene of that night's terrors.&#xD;
* * * * * * *&#xD;
My illness was the more distressing, that the&#xD;
specters of this awful tragedy nightly visited&#xD;
my brain, and there held high carnival, feasting&#xD;
on my life-blood until my strong constitution&#xD;
prevailed, and health, the most potent charmer&#xD;
of wicked fancies, drove them out, and made&#xD;
me for awhile a different man. For the first&#xD;
and only time in my life, did I feel a desire to&#xD;
see the world; so the next summer found me&#xD;
at Baden-Baden, with such money as I could&#xD;
raise from a Jew by mortgage upon my castle.&#xD;
From the world of the Black Forest, with its&#xD;
&#xD;
specters and horrors (which do exist in spite&#xD;
of all the teachings of all philosophers),-out&#xD;
from the world of my own gloom and melan-&#xD;
choly-out of my routine and acquaintance. I&#xD;
emerged into the center of high life and&#xD;
gayety, frivolous bon-ton and all that induces&#xD;
men and women to live for the hour alone.&#xD;
The scenery around Baden-Baden helped to&#xD;
infuse a new spirit into my distracted mind,&#xD;
and but little did the gay throng, with whom I&#xD;
mingled, imagine that the pale man who walked&#xD;
in their midst had. deep experience with spirits&#xD;
so dread and terrible that their simple appear-&#xD;
ance in the sparkling ball-room, as they had&#xD;
appeared to me in the forest wilderness, would&#xD;
pale every cheek, and turn all the hilarity of&#xD;
the place into dismay and horror.&#xD;
But the pale and silent man changed. For&#xD;
the genius of that gay watering-place, the ir-&#xD;
resistible force of example and association&#xD;
held their sway over him, and the more en-&#xD;
tirely, that his previous life had been one of&#xD;
utter seclusion, was he now carried away by&#xD;
the world of music and laughter, of dancing&#xD;
and gaming, of voluptuousness and high life in&#xD;
all its customs. And thus I plunged headlong&#xD;
into the world of dissipation, and with my&#xD;
noble name and better gold, I soon found my-&#xD;
self a lion at Baden, courted by the men and&#xD;
not disliked by the women.&#xD;
And I gambled. The green-table-the crou-&#xD;
pier with his marble face-the diabolical chink&#xD;
of gold-the distant music calling to pleasures&#xD;
and charms which gold alone can procure-the&#xD;
sparkling wine and glaring eyes ; all the ap-&#xD;
pendages of this shrine of gold drew me on,&#xD;
and Iplayed,&#xD;
I played-played with success-played on;&#xD;
on, on-lost. Lost heavily, lost again, lost all&#xD;
I had in the world but a few hundreds. Won&#xD;
again; played on like a maniac. I concentrated&#xD;
my whole being upon the game and won more.&#xD;
I was chained to the table by as irresistible a&#xD;
power as that which nailed me t: the ground&#xD;
while I saw my huntsman torn into shreds by&#xD;
the wolf-fiend; now, as then, I was under the&#xD;
control of Satan, but how different the circum-&#xD;
stancesI Instead of wind. and horror, and de-&#xD;
mons, a paradise of light, and music, and&#xD;
beauty, and gold flowing instead of the blood&#xD;
of my poor Hans!I&#xD;
And gold I am winning, that gold which holds&#xD;
you all, men and women of Baden, in deepest&#xD;
bondage, and though I am mad, yes, raving&#xD;
mad, there is a system in my madness, and I&#xD;
shall win more, until I am acknowledged king&#xD;
of Baden's gaming-tables.&#xD;
Yes, you are right; I will stop-I will be&#xD;
cool-yes, cold and hard as fashionable charity&#xD;
itself. I will strip. I rise from the table and&#xD;
bear my winnings home. Was it not Satan,&#xD;
whose money I won and whose counsel I fol-&#xD;
lowed in carrying away my ill-gotten treasure?&#xD;
Truly the money won in a gambling hell is but&#xD;
a curse, and will be a curse as long as God in&#xD;
Heaven reigns high above the Arch-fiendl&#xD;

&#xD;
sun before he set, and the gathering dark-&#xD;
ness, from its melancholy associations, brought&#xD;
back at once a sickening revulsion of feeling.&#xD;
The excitement of the chase having passed&#xD;
away, my sorrows returned, and settled like&#xD;
a huge black cloud upon my breast, heavy as&#xD;
lead.&#xD;
We emerged from the woods, and found&#xD;
ourselves upon the crest of a hill; under our&#xD;
feet lay a valley, buried in thick woods, and&#xD;
over yonder, on the next hill, I saw the castle&#xD;
of Unkstein.&#xD;
My heart knew the spot, and stood still,&#xD;
while an icy chill drove the blood back upon&#xD;
it. Yes, I knew the spot well; I turned to my&#xD;
companion-he shrank from me with an ex-&#xD;
pression of fear on his face.&#xD;
" What day of the month is it," Iasked him&#xD;
and though I knew the answer, when he re-&#xD;
plied,'&#xD;
"The thirteenth day of May, dear master,"&#xD;
the answer made me tremble like ansaspen, for,&#xD;
two years ago on this very day Hans had met&#xD;
his death.&#xD;
As if these words had aroused the fury of&#xD;
the elements, the storm-king 'woke with a roar&#xD;
and a shriek ; the rocks and mountains caught&#xD;
the sound and hurled it through the forest,&#xD;
while the distant thunder answered the sum-&#xD;
mons with a fierce growl. Up rose the pile of&#xD;
clouds in mad fantastic shapes, and sped across&#xD;
the sky, to cover it in an instant with a waving&#xD;
angry chaos, like a tempestuous sea.&#xD;
11Home !" I cried, in an agony of fearful ap-&#xD;
prehension. "Home! for God's sake, if you&#xD;
love your life!"&#xD;
We ran at full speed, pursued by the storm&#xD;
with blinding flashes of lightning, and pelted&#xD;
by rain. Again I heard theild huntsman&#xD;
careering madly onward   *    *    *   *&#xD;
"Lord have mercy upon us, we have lost the&#xD;
path I"&#xD;
Night had closed around us as if sent down&#xD;
from heaven or sent up from hell in an instant:&#xD;
but there-was I mad, or was I dreaming a hor-&#xD;
rible dream ? There, a clearing in the woods,&#xD;
I knew it well; there a black heap on the&#xD;
ground, a groan, a growl. Hans writhing in&#xD;
mortal agony under the teeth and claws of th&#xD;
black wofl/ I stood spell-bound for a moment,&#xD;
it seemed ages. Fear, mortal fear possessed&#xD;
me, and increasing, still mounting higher, it&#xD;
well-nigh snapped the thread of life. The phan-&#xD;
tom stayed, it was there before my eyes, it was&#xD;
real; but thank God, I found strength to break&#xD;
the spell of the fiend and flee away, to rush&#xD;
through the woods as I had done two years&#xD;
before.&#xD;
My brain did not do it, for I had no brain&#xD;
then; my heart did not do it, for it was like a&#xD;
lump of ice in my bosom; by the power of in-&#xD;
stinct alone I found my way to the castle, to&#xD;
my own room, I burst open the door, and there&#xD;
stood, not my wife, but the wolf, dressed as a&#xD;
woman.   I receded, appalled  she advanced.&#xD;
I saw the hungry eyes; I heard a snarling&#xD;
growl, such as was etill in my ears; she threw&#xD;
herself upon me; a faint struggle.; her teeth&#xD;
were in my heart and 1 knew no more.&#xD;
This is my story-after a long night of&#xD;
&#xD;
blissful oblivion. I awoke in this cell, the cell&#xD;
of a mad-house. I do not wish to leave it, for&#xD;
it protects me. If I went abroad she would&#xD;
follow me and get my heart, though now&#xD;
when she comes, and she will come, she snarls&#xD;
words of treacherous kindness to me.&#xD;
If they would only leave me in peace ! Oh,&#xD;
if she would only die ! But the insatiable&#xD;
spirit of the Black Forest would send another&#xD;
instrument of his vengeance, and it is better&#xD;
that I should end my miserable existence&#xD;
here.&#xD;
And if the reader of this, should hear that&#xD;
the noble Count of Unkstein died a maniac,&#xD;
raving, laughing, and cursing, let him reflect&#xD;
on my dreadful condition, and consider what&#xD;
his own conduct would be were he subjected&#xD;
to similar horrors. I am not mad. This is&#xD;
what I ask the world to concede, and in un-&#xD;
swerving faith I point to this manuscript as a&#xD;
witness.&#xD;
CHAPTER II&#xD;
GOING.&#xD;
"I have a mind presages me such thrift,&#xD;
That I should questionless be fortunate."&#xD;
MIEenCANT OF VENICE.&#xD;
THE wind was on the beam, and blowing&#xD;
fresh. and the "Glad Tidings" was plunging&#xD;
along through the billows of the Atlantic. On&#xD;
her deck were two young men, sitting in&#xD;
chairs propped and braced to defy the law of&#xD;
gravitation, so often embarrassing to the ship-&#xD;
passenger.&#xD;
Judging from their plain attire, neither&#xD;
seemed to belong to the wealthier class of&#xD;
society; but the refined and intelligent face of&#xD;
the younger (he might have barely reached&#xD;
his majority) at a glance told you that he was&#xD;
a gentleman. The other contrasted strongly&#xD;
with his companion; but especially in the ex-&#xD;
pression of his face. He was short and slim,&#xD;
while his countenance, though intelligent and&#xD;
of an efeminate regularity bore the stamp of'&#xD;
craftiness, and perhaps deceit. He might have&#xD;
been his companion's senior by some ten years.&#xD;
They discussedthe future which lay before&#xD;
them in the new   world-for the "Glad&#xD;
Tidings" was bound for New     York, and&#xD;
another day of fair weather would bring them&#xD;
within sight of the promised land.&#xD;
"Stilletto,"lsaid Ernest Montant, for that was&#xD;
the name of the younger; "4it is my firm con-&#xD;
viction that I will succeed in America."&#xD;
"Quite a natural sentiment at your age," said&#xD;
Stiletto, dryly; and you have a great advantage&#xD;
in speaking English as well as you do."&#xD;
"why, as to that, although I am a German,&#xD;
as you know very well, and born and brought&#xD;
up in Hamburgh, my mother was an English&#xD;
lady, and my father, one of those intellectual&#xD;
Germans whose only fault is their ill-fortune,&#xD;
after having lost all his money, is now living in&#xD;
mnglandnn my mother's estates. But I asked&#xD;
my parnt   or, a hunde  pounds and a few&#xD;
letters to parties in New York, and here I&#xD;

FANTASY.&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
"You are certain of a situation upon your&#xD;
arrival?"&#xD;
"Yes: the arrangements were made before&#xD;
I left London, and there seems no doubt about&#xD;
the high standing and respectability of the firm&#xD;
of Going &amp;amp; Son, Bankers and Commission&#xD;
merchants, New York."&#xD;
" American business-houses are not founded&#xD;
upon rocks."&#xD;
"I must take my chances;'I am young, and&#xD;
have no apprehension for my own future.&#xD;
" I have told you that this is not my first visit&#xD;
to America," continued Stilletto, "and to the&#xD;
little information [ have given you, I will add&#xD;
a good deal after our arrival. As for me, I like&#xD;
New York. The women are beautiful."&#xD;
Montant's face colored slightly as he an-&#xD;
swered half audibly,-&#xD;
"I am glad of it. More than most men, I&#xD;
think, I am inclined to admire and appreciate&#xD;
female beauty. I love a beautiful woman, for&#xD;
to me she is the master-piece of God's crea-&#xD;
tion."&#xD;
" You speak too hotly for one of your age,"&#xD;
said Stilletto, sneeringly. "Let us return to&#xD;
the considerarion of your future, which seems&#xD;
altogether in your own hands. For your own&#xD;
good, I tell you that New York is a very queer&#xD;
place. All the old teachings of conservatism,&#xD;
the 'systems' of the old world, fall to the&#xD;
ground there. We find variety and pleasure&#xD;
in being rich to-day and poor to-morrow; we&#xD;
make a fortune in a day and spend it in a&#xD;
week, and our business principles do not savor&#xD;
of great nicety, or of what the old world calls&#xD;
'strict honesty.' Smartness is our watchword,&#xD;
and our foremost men have a better reputation&#xD;
than their consciences will warrant."&#xD;
" I have heard this before," answered the&#xD;
German, "but I don't, can't, and won't believe&#xD;
it."&#xD;
That is the answer of youth and inexperi-&#xD;
ence ! In New York we only laugh at your&#xD;
old-fogy routine.  And why not?  D'Israeli&#xD;
somewhere says of the English that they think&#xD;
too much of system and too little of men.&#xD;
You will find that the American idea of busi-&#xD;
ness is-a great struggle among individuals,&#xD;
and that struggle is pushed to the utmost&#xD;
limits of the common law, without reference&#xD;
to any rules of hackneyed propriety or over-&#xD;
strained conscientiousness. This is the world&#xD;
into which you are stepping, so you may as&#xD;
well make up your mind to it."&#xD;
"My   mind is made up"-answered the&#xD;
other, gravely. " I intend to stand above all&#xD;
your irregularities, nor will I work for any&#xD;
man, though he be the wealthiest in that great&#xD;
city, who is not strictly conscientious in all his&#xD;
dealings."&#xD;
Stilletto paused for a moment ; but finally&#xD;
said, quietly,-&#xD;
" You are twenty-one."&#xD;
"True, but I lay this down as my law and&#xD;
mean to stick to it. I know that I am young;&#xD;
but I have left my home, with all its luxuries,&#xD;
because my pride would not let me be a&#xD;
pensioner. I have proved that I am old&#xD;
enough to choose my own road through the&#xD;
world, arid I have the example of my father's&#xD;
failure before me. Hie was honest at heart,&#xD;
&#xD;
but too generous and confiding. As a conse-&#xD;
quence he reaps a sad harvest in his old age,&#xD;
I mean to do differently."&#xD;
He arose and walked away. Stilletto, deem-&#xD;
ing it best to drop the subject, went below to&#xD;
amuse himself by tormenting a little monkey,&#xD;
which he kept to vent his spite upon, when&#xD;
his fellow-men objected too strenuously to his&#xD;
efforts in that line on themselves.&#xD;
*    *    *    *    *    *    *    *&#xD;
" How different are the faces I meet, to those&#xD;
in Europe," thought Ernest Montant to him-&#xD;
self, as he made the best of his way to the&#xD;
office of Messrs. Going &amp;amp; Son, in Exchange&#xD;
Place, New York City, to pay his respects to&#xD;
that firm, for thefirst time. "There seems to&#xD;
be much more life, wit, and intelligence in the&#xD;
faces of these men. Each seems to be thinking&#xD;
and acting for himself, regardless of others,"&#xD;
he added, as a bank-messenger darted from an&#xD;
office door and nearly knocked him down,&#xD;
without ever stopping to apologize. "I don't&#xD;
see any human machines, and I should not won-&#xD;
der if Stilletto was right in saying that here is&#xD;
a constant strife for individual superiority."&#xD;
So meditating, he reached a fine building,&#xD;
over whose door was suspended a black and&#xD;
gold sign, Going &amp;amp; Sox.  A highly ornate&#xD;
carriage drove up as he read the name and he&#xD;
saw two gentlemen descend, whom he correct-&#xD;
ly surmised to be his future employers, Mr.&#xD;
Charles W. Going and his son Walter. The&#xD;
former was a remarkably handsome gentleman,&#xD;
about sixty years old, with a noble head, a&#xD;
hale, stout figure, and venerable white hair.&#xD;
His son, taller, and perhaps thirty years his&#xD;
junior, resembled his father in manly attract-&#xD;
iveness, but his gait, as he walked into the&#xD;
office, told of a reckless boldness, which might&#xD;
become offensive.&#xD;
"They must be a monstrously wealthy&#xD;
house," thought he. "But few London mer-&#xD;
chants would be seen driving to their places of&#xD;
business in such a dashing equipage."&#xD;
He entered the office; but not with beating&#xD;
heart, for Ernest Montant knew nothing of&#xD;
trepidation, although his quiet, self-reliance&#xD;
was entirely free from the taint of arrogance.&#xD;
He entered-the floor was inlaid with a mo-&#xD;
saie of tiles, the doors and furniture were of&#xD;
black walnut, the counters topped with very&#xD;
tine French plate glass. Elegantly dressed&#xD;
clerks were moving around, trying to look&#xD;
busy, and a scornful expression on each&#xD;
seemed to proclaim that they considered them-&#xD;
selves part of the great house of Going &amp;amp; Son.&#xD;
"Is Mr. Going in, sir ?"&#xD;
" Engaged, sir,-can't you tell me what you&#xD;
want?"&#xD;
Our hero did not relish the tone in which&#xD;
the reply was made, so he said, rather per-&#xD;
emptorily,-&#xD;
" Take this note in to him."  The boy in&#xD;
man's clothes made an impudent bow and&#xD;
turned to deliver the note. At this moment,&#xD;
Mr. Walter Going stepped out of the private&#xD;
office, and noticing Montant, said carelessly-&#xD;
" Why don't you sit down?" but our hero&#xD;
thought to himself, " Either pay no attention&#xD;
to me at all, or else be courteous."&#xD;
Mr. Walter Going disappeared with the note&#xD;
&#xD;

GOING AND SON.&#xD;
&#xD;
I-&#xD;
&#xD;
FANTASY.&#xD;
&#xD;
and soon there came a summons for the new-&#xD;
comer to the private office. As he entered, its&#xD;
appointments impressed him with the idea of&#xD;
a dandified nobleman's study, modified by fem-&#xD;
inine tastes into a lady's boudoir. were it not&#xD;
for a large, double desk, which occupied the&#xD;
center of the room, where sat Mr. Going and&#xD;
his son.&#xD;
Mr. Going's face assumed a pleasant look as&#xD;
he arose slowly, drawing himself up to his&#xD;
full height, and held out his hand with grace-&#xD;
ful, dignified cordiality.&#xD;
"My dear Mr. Montant," he said, "1 wel-&#xD;
come you here and to my house, with the as-&#xD;
surance that I am most pleased to see you."&#xD;
There was no pomposity in the tone or man-&#xD;
ner, though, perhaps, too much dignity; but&#xD;
when Mr. Montant took the proffered hand,&#xD;
and looked its owner full in the face, he&#xD;
found him so highly bred, yet so kind and gen-&#xD;
tle, that his own heart beat warmly and grate-&#xD;
fully in response.&#xD;
"Walter," said Mr. Going, "this is Mr.&#xD;
Ernest Montant, the son of a gentleman I once&#xD;
knew very well, inHamburg. He is here as a&#xD;
clerk in our house."&#xD;
"IHallool " sail Walter, looking up from the&#xD;
newspaper, which he had been reading care.&#xD;
fully, and, rising with a sigh at the effort, he&#xD;
shook our hero roughly by the hand, adding,&#xD;
in a reckless, but not unkind manner, " How&#xD;
are you, sir ? Well "-taking a good look at&#xD;
him from top to toe-"you'd better go and&#xD;
see my tailor. Of course, we don't care how&#xD;
a man is dressed; but for your own sake I&#xD;
must tell you that your appearance, at the&#xD;
present moment, is a little verdant."&#xD;
A glance from his father caused him to turn&#xD;
away with a shrug of the shoulder, and resume&#xD;
his newspaper and cigar, whose flavor had&#xD;
somewhat astonished our hero when he en-&#xD;
tered the room, fur in English otfices such&#xD;
luxuries are generally considered irreverent.&#xD;
"Mr. Montant," said Mr. Going, senior,&#xD;
upon resuming his seat, and motioning the&#xD;
new clerk to a chair, "I remember your father&#xD;
as an honorable gentleman, and a remarkably&#xD;
clever business man."&#xD;
H His success in life seems hardly to warrant&#xD;
the latter compliment, Mr. Going," he replied,&#xD;
with a sigh.&#xD;
I know of his misfortunes;" replied the&#xD;
merchant, "but these may happen to any&#xD;
man.' (This was spoken so earnestly, that our&#xD;
hero noticed itdwith some wonder.) "Success&#xD;
in life is accidental, and knowing what are&#xD;
your father's talents and principles, I can not&#xD;
blame him for what, as I said before, may&#xD;
happen to any one."&#xD;
Montant felt that he would like to argue the&#xD;
point; but, young as he was, lie had already&#xD;
learned that it is sometimes best to hold one's&#xD;
tongue, so he merely bowed an assent.&#xD;
GI have a situation for you," continued Mr.&#xD;
Going, but I can not promise to make it a&#xD;
permanent one until we have tried what you&#xD;
can do. You shall be the Assistant Cashier&#xD;
and Book-keeper. As you speak English per-&#xD;
fectly you have every chance of success, and&#xD;
since you are recommended so highly, I will&#xD;
give you a thousand dollars a year."&#xD;
&#xD;
" I am very much obliged to you, sir," said&#xD;
our hero, honestly; "it is more than I had any&#xD;
right to expect."&#xD;
Mr. Going nodded graciously, and added :&#xD;
" We have a little German correspondence, if&#xD;
you feel competent, I will make this a part of&#xD;
your duty."&#xD;
"Very well, sir," he replied; but thought&#xD;
what a strange system there must be in the&#xD;
house where one young man was intrusted&#xD;
with being assistant cashier, book-keeper, and&#xD;
corresponding clerk.&#xD;
The door opened without an announcing&#xD;
knock, which seemed very strange to our hero,&#xD;
and when a gentleman entered (without taking&#xD;
off his hat), the new clerk naturally arose to&#xD;
leave the room; but Mr. Going told him to&#xD;
keep his seat, which seemed stranger yet.&#xD;
" What a country I" he thought.&#xD;
The new-comer was very young, and either&#xD;
employed an excellent barber, or had no need&#xD;
to be shaved. He was dressed like a coxcomb&#xD;
prepared for a promenade, and wore diamond&#xD;
studs. He looked like a Jew, he spoke like a&#xD;
Jew, and, in fact, he was a Jew. Mr. Walter&#xD;
Going immediately asked him:&#xD;
" How is Pumpernickle Mining, Solomon ?"&#xD;
"I'll sell at four'n'af, buy at three-eighths,&#xD;
give you a good option at three-quarters, or sell,&#xD;
you buyer three at live-eighths, sellyoua put for&#xD;
a thous ad, for two thousand shares at a half,&#xD;
buy you a call at the same price for five hun-&#xD;
dred, market going down, corner in it, think&#xD;
they'll danirew the stock, just bought three&#xD;
thousand at an eighth cash."&#xD;
Montant looked at him in astonishment,&#xD;
for all this had been said in one breath, and&#xD;
with a rapidity which seemed perfectly mar-&#xD;
velous.&#xD;
" Well," said Walter, leaning back and&#xD;
lighting a fresh cigar, "how is Melodram&#xD;
Quickstilver ?"&#xD;
"Just sold two thousand shares at an eighth,&#xD;
market strong, bulls buying up all they can&#xD;
lay their hands on. I'll sell at three-sixteenths,&#xD;
buy at a quarter, sixty days' margin, ten per&#xD;
cent, no puts in the market, calls plenty at a&#xD;
quarter a share; think I'll sell another thou-&#xD;
sand at a quarter cash."&#xD;
"He always ends with 'Cash,'" thought&#xD;
our hero, biting his lips to keep from laughing&#xD;
outright. "It seems to be the 'Amen.' I&#xD;
wonder if all the stock-brokers in New York&#xD;
resemble this one, in having an enlargement&#xD;
of his windpipe and the St. Vitus' dance in&#xD;
his jaws."&#xD;
"Come here," said Walter to Mr. Solomon,&#xD;
and they retired into a corner of the room. As&#xD;
Montant now rose to leave, he heard the Jew&#xD;
say, with a suppressed vehemence, which&#xD;
made his voice sound like a distant crackling:&#xD;
"Bet you two to one Erie ain't going up;&#xD;
ten to one, gold will be lower ; even, that&#xD;
Blackhead &amp;amp; Co. are busted higher than a kite,&#xD;
and Whitefoot made piles of greenbacks. So&#xD;
you see I'm right, you're wrong always. So&#xD;
don't believe it? Stake your money, here's&#xD;
mine Cash "&#xD;
Mr. Going accompanied our hero to the&#xD;
door.&#xD;
"I fancy that you would prefer to comn-&#xD;
&#xD;
11&#xD;
&#xD;
mence work to-morrow," he said. "We count&#xD;
upon seeing you to-night, at dinner-Number&#xD;
up Fifth Avenue, at six, punctually."&#xD;
As Ernest thanked him, he continued, "An-&#xD;
other point,-Walter shall look into your per-&#xD;
sonal comforts. Have you found a respecta-&#xD;
ble boarding-house and reasonable prices? A&#xD;
stranger, you know-"&#xD;
" Through the introduction of a fellow-pas-&#xD;
senger I am comfortably quartered in Brooklyn,&#xD;
at five dollars a week."&#xD;
"I am glad to see you begin by living within&#xD;
your means. Few young men stick to that&#xD;
principle in this city, Mr. Montant, and now&#xD;
let me ask, are you provided with ready mnoy ?&#xD;
If not, I'will allow you to draw a month's&#xD;
salary in advance." ,&#xD;
"I have yet a hundred pounds, so I do not&#xD;
need it; but, believe me, sir, I appreciate your&#xD;
kind offer. I do not intend to draw my salary&#xD;
for the first year."&#xD;
"You will find it a hard task."&#xD;
"I have done harder things than that, sir.&#xD;
Again I thank you for your kindness. It is&#xD;
greater than I dreamed of. Good morning,&#xD;
sir."&#xD;
'To-night, at six-Remember!,"&#xD;
When our hero reached his boarding-house&#xD;
he partook of his luncheon and philosophized&#xD;
over the events of the day.&#xD;
" It is all very strange, this house of Going&#xD;
&amp;amp; Son," he soliloquized.  "They volunteer&#xD;
more salary than I could expect-they drive&#xD;
to their office in a dashing carriage--and that&#xD;
heavy compromise between a swell and a lout,&#xD;
YTalter Going. By St. George, an English papa&#xD;
would send him off shooting, racing, betting,&#xD;
any thing to keep him out of his counting-&#xD;
house ! And this sandy-haired lion domineers&#xD;
over the coxcomb clerks, and is a full, active&#xD;
partner withal ! But Mr. Going-I would like&#xD;
to put him in the center of the London mer-&#xD;
chant-princes and say to them, 'Gentlemen,&#xD;
here is a specimen I caught in America; but&#xD;
I will match him against any of you I'  But&#xD;
only personally--yes, only personally I His&#xD;
business principles--(and here the young sage&#xD;
shook his head)--well, they are not mine; and&#xD;
as long as-they are not mine of course I can&#xD;
not admire them. And how singular that a&#xD;
man in his position should say, ' A merchant's&#xD;
success is accidental!' Indeed I do not think&#xD;
so. But, come what may, I mean to rise in&#xD;
that house, and anyway I shall never forget'&#xD;
my reception by an American gentleman in New&#xD;
YorkI"&#xD;
Punctually at six o'clock he arrived at the&#xD;
superb mansion of Mr. Going in Fifth Avenue.&#xD;
He had crawled into his full dress suit, made&#xD;
by a London artist, and looked graceful, re-&#xD;
fined, and even captivating, when he toet the&#xD;
members of Mr. Going's family. le returned&#xD;
to his boarding-house about midnight ; but&#xD;
was in dreamland long before he could get to&#xD;
sleep&#xD;
" Her face-her figure-her speech-every&#xD;
thing," he cried, as ho paced the room.&#xD;
"She is the most beautiful girl tinder the&#xD;
sun-she must be the most beautiful girl&#xD;
under the siun! I am not in love-that would&#xD;
be imnousible, so soon; but, as the Maniac&#xD;
&#xD;
10&#xD;
&#xD;
says, ' I soon shall be, if I go there often.&#xD;
What a pretty name,  Jessie Going.' She will&#xD;
be gone soon, doubtless, for half New York&#xD;
must be running after her."&#xD;
He was quite excited by the impression&#xD;
made upon him by Mr. Going's only daughter,&#xD;
whose name, perhaps not so pretty as our&#xD;
friend then imagined it, was, as we have just&#xD;
heard, neither Angelica, nor Evangeline, nor&#xD;
yet Madeleine, but simply Jessie, which, being&#xD;
considered too long by her father and brother,&#xD;
called for abbreviation into Jess. And as our&#xD;
hero called that name to memory, there seemed&#xD;
a heavenly melody in the monosyllable, which&#xD;
must have originated in his own brains.&#xD;
"Such splendid black hair-what a contrast&#xD;
to her yellow brother! Such eyes-and the&#xD;
classic face! I can draw it from memory-&#xD;
and the graceful yet stately figure-such a&#xD;
neck! and-aand-1'll go to bed," he cried, an-&#xD;
gry with himself; but, before he commenced&#xD;
that action. lost himself in dismal reflections.&#xD;
"She is rich and at the top of the ladder, and&#xD;
I am poor and at the very bottom, what can&#xD;
she be to me," &amp;amp;c., &amp;amp;c. But suddenly recall-&#xD;
ing Stiletto's assertion, that business in Amer-&#xD;
ica was a strife amongst individuals, he con-&#xD;
soled himself with the thought so common to&#xD;
youth-" Perhaps I have just as good a chance&#xD;
as any one."&#xD;
CHAPTER III.&#xD;
MR. STILLETTO'S ABODE.&#xD;
"If thou wert honorable,&#xD;
Thou wouladst have told this tale for virtue, not&#xD;
For such an end thou semek'st, as base as strange."&#xD;
CYMBEmLtE.&#xD;
ERNEST MONTANT made his appearance at the&#xD;
office at eight o'clock next morning, but found&#xD;
that at this hour the porter was wont to begim&#xD;
sweeping the rooms, with his mind perfectly&#xD;
easy as to the arrival of the gentlemanly&#xD;
clerks.&#xD;
Somewhat astonished at this discovery, al-&#xD;
though it seemed in perfect keeping with the&#xD;
general style of matters in the house of Going&#xD;
&amp;amp; Son, our hero determined not to make&#xD;
that mistake again. So he passed the time as&#xD;
well as he could out of doors until the sweep-&#xD;
ing was finished, when he learned from a lit-&#xD;
tle chat with the porter, that Mr. Going was&#xD;
the finest gentleman in America, Mr. Walter&#xD;
a born prince, and Miss Jessie, an angel, body&#xD;
and soul.&#xD;
" How coarsely these uneducated people&#xD;
pronounce names," thought our hero, in&#xD;
whose ears that word Jessie, was ringing and&#xD;
re-echoing in accents of heavenly music as&#xD;
performed by his enthusiasm, with a chorus&#xD;
of angels.&#xD;
The clerks, as he soon discovered, were in&#xD;
the habit of " coming down" at half-past nine&#xD;
to ten, the cashier at half-past ten exactly,&#xD;
and the partners in their carriage at eleven&#xD;
o'clock. The hour of leaving was not less&#xD;
peculiar, but more- on a par between the&#xD;
" castes " of the office, for the partners would&#xD;
leave at four o'clock; and five minutes later,&#xD;

all the clerks would follow, which made things&#xD;
very pleasant for the porter and janitor, with&#xD;
their various friends, who would hold conver-&#xD;
saziones in the offices during the balance of&#xD;
the afternoon.&#xD;
At first, the porter resented the imperti-&#xD;
nence of the new clerk, in "coming down" alto-&#xD;
gether too early," whereupon the insulted one&#xD;
narrowly escaped being knocked down, and&#xD;
only got a lecture.&#xD;
"My good friend, if I were Mr. Going, I&#xD;
I should tell you that this is not early enough ;&#xD;
but quite late enough for you to find another&#xD;
situation. Besides, I intend to stand no im-&#xD;
pertinences from you, and if you differ from&#xD;
me, we will argue the point in the private of-&#xD;
fice as soon as the firm arrive."&#xD;
To which the porter made no reply; but in-&#xD;
formed his wife that afternoon, that Mr.&#xD;
Mountain was an aristocrat, and no mistake.&#xD;
But his silence at the- moment calmed the ris-&#xD;
ing choler of our hero, and by a little general-.&#xD;
ship, he won the porter's confidence (although&#xD;
he remained an aristocrat in the honest man's&#xD;
eyes all his life), and the friendly conversation&#xD;
brought about the first-quoted outbursts of&#xD;
eloquence on the subject of the Messrs. Going&#xD;
and Miss Jessie.&#xD;
During the day our hero had but little&#xD;
to do, as usual on first appearances; but he&#xD;
saw a good deal. Ile saw that Mr. Solomon&#xD;
was sent for twice, and that his lightning-like&#xD;
eloquence exceeded yesterday's, that bank-&#xD;
messengers were received and dispatched -&#xD;
that Mr. Going's face was troubled-that the&#xD;
old cashier frowned and figured away violent-&#xD;
ly all day-that Walter swore great oaths at&#xD;
somebody and at the bank-that said bank had&#xD;
refused a discount, although Mr. Going was&#xD;
one of the directors-in short, that the tirm&#xD;
was pressed for money and did not make up&#xD;
its balance at the bank-all of which seemed&#xD;
more and more strange in so large a house, for&#xD;
he did not read in the newspapers that money&#xD;
was " tight "in the market.&#xD;
But he also had reason, even that day, to be-&#xD;
lieve that the firm was largely and handsomely&#xD;
connected-that Mr. Going stood very high-&#xD;
that his private property was comparatively&#xD;
immense, though somewhat encumbered, and&#xD;
to come to th'e conclusion that it was good-&#xD;
hearted confidence in his employees, and want&#xD;
of management on their part, which so put&#xD;
matters out of shape. His final resolve was&#xD;
-I shall stand by the old gentleman until I&#xD;
can be of service to him, and as long there-&#xD;
after as God pliasos."&#xD;
So he went home to his modest dinner at&#xD;
his quiet boarding-house, and then, in accord-&#xD;
ance with at promise given on board ship, he&#xD;
went out to hunt up Stilletto's present place&#xD;
of abode.&#xD;
Somewhere in the suburbs he found a neat&#xD;
house, in a quiet street, over whose door was&#xD;
the sign "August Muller, Attorney and Coun-&#xD;
sellor at Law." As this corresponded with&#xD;
the address given him by his friend, he rang&#xD;
the bell.&#xD;
A bright boy, with blue eyes, flaxen hair,&#xD;
and German physiognomy-, loened the door,&#xD;
and, upon inouiry, said that his papa and Mr.&#xD;
&#xD;
Stilletto had just finished supper, and would&#xD;
be found in the parlor.&#xD;
He entered the designated room; but it was&#xD;
so filled with smoke, that at first he could not&#xD;
distinguish the inmates. By advancing toward&#xD;
the center of the room, and straining his eyes,&#xD;
he discovered first a nose, which was red'&#xD;
then some disheveled hair, and a long goatee,&#xD;
-also red, then a long attenuated face, which&#xD;
was pale, then a pair of mischievously blink-&#xD;
ing eyes,, which were of no color at all, and,&#xD;
finally, when he had wiped away the tears&#xD;
that the acrid fumes had brought, he found 'a&#xD;
long, bony body of a man, which, together&#xD;
with the clothing thereon, gave a general im-&#xD;
pression of dirt.&#xD;
All these articles joined together constituted&#xD;
a human shape, which was - sitting up at a&#xD;
table playing cards, supported by a glass of&#xD;
lager-bier and a pipe, and confronted by Mr.&#xD;
Stilletto, with his sallow  and treacherous-&#xD;
regular face, with his piercing impudent eyes,&#xD;
and his small body curled up like a snake.&#xD;
At the sight of our hero, the mysterious&#xD;
philosophy of the cards was left to itself, and&#xD;
the itroduction by Stilletto of "his esteemed&#xD;
friend and fellow-passenger, Mr. Montaut, son&#xD;
of Mr. and Lady Montait, of London," to the&#xD;
red nose and appendages of his "old and inti-&#xD;
mate friend, August Muller, late of the Court&#xD;
of Wumtemburg, and now lawyer by profes-&#xD;
sion and philosopher by inspiration."&#xD;
"Mr. Montant," said the philosopher, in a&#xD;
voice like a cracked kettle-drum,  Mr. Mon-&#xD;
tant, you are welcome! when August Muller&#xD;
says, welcome, he means not the hackneyed&#xD;
term of hypocritical worldliness, he means not&#xD;
a hollow sound, an empty, shallow epithet, he&#xD;
means welcome to his heart and to his home,&#xD;
now and hereafter. I can not ?/et call yotn&#xD;
friend (holding the guest's hand in his own,&#xD;
which was rather moist and slightly clammy),&#xD;
for a friend of August Miller has to earn his&#xD;
spurs--but you are a friend of mayIfriend, and&#xD;
therefore, I repeat to you now and forever-&#xD;
welcome!"&#xD;
Mr. Muller was, to all appearances, intoxi-&#xD;
cated.,&#xD;
"So you are living here, Stilletto," said our&#xD;
hero, in want of a remark that would not&#xD;
show his disgust, but a slight stress of voice&#xD;
on the last word of the sentence betrayed&#xD;
hinn.&#xD;
"Yes, sir. I am living here, and very com-&#xD;
fortably. You must excuse my friend" (with&#xD;
his usual blunt impudence), "for he has&#xD;
drunk too much beer."&#xD;
"I like it," seid Muller, coming from  the&#xD;
sublime to the ridiculous; "it makes me sleep&#xD;
well."&#xD;
" Do drunken men dream? " asked Stilletto,&#xD;
maliciously.&#xD;
" I am not drunk," remonstrated the philos-&#xD;
opher. " I shall repose to-night by the side&#xD;
of my beloved wife-an angel who conde-&#xD;
scends to perambulate the rough path of life&#xD;
with&#xD;
" A drunkard, who beats her occasionally,"&#xD;
interposed Stilletto, dryly.&#xD;
"'Thiat, Mr. Stilletto," replied Mr. Muller,&#xD;
gravely, " is not so much a mistake of yours,&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
as the result of the vile tongues of this world,&#xD;
who delight in calumniating a man who des-&#xD;
pises it."&#xD;
" And the world returns the compliment, 1&#xD;
hey ?"&#xD;
"I' The world is hard, very hard on the&#xD;
poor," said Mr. Muller.  "The world hast&#xD;
driven me from posts of honor to the dens of&#xD;
misery; from the service and confidence of a&#xD;
king to the vocation of a Tombs lawyer,a&#xD;
whose humiliating  profession consists in&#xD;
snatching criminals from the grip of the law.&#xD;
But my family must have bread, sir, and I-"4&#xD;
"Must have whisky and beer," interposed&#xD;
Stilletto, disagreeably. (It was evident that&#xD;
the monkey would rest in peace that night.)&#xD;
Then he added, seriously,-&#xD;
"My friend Muller is an excellent man at&#xD;
heart, and you can trust him. I am very glad&#xD;
that you came in, as I want to speak to you&#xD;
on a matter of business, which will give you&#xD;
a big chance to make money-more money in&#xD;
six months than you can save from your&#xD;
salary in six years, in the meek and lowly&#xD;
capacity of an honorable, half-paid, kicked-&#xD;
and-cuffed clerk."&#xD;
"Stay," said Mr. Muller, "stay but a mo-&#xD;
ment, and allow me to introduce my family to&#xD;
the friend of my friend, for greater title than&#xD;
that I would not give to the Emperor of all&#xD;
the Russias, were he now present."&#xD;
" Which he is not," interposed the genial&#xD;
Mr. Stilletto.&#xD;
Mfr. Muller went to the door, and bawled at&#xD;
somebody to come in, "and quick at that."&#xD;
-"Now you will see some fun," said Sti!-&#xD;
letto.&#xD;
In came a woman, a neat, docile creature,&#xD;
who might once have been possessed of char-&#xD;
acter and beauty. The former had turned to&#xD;
total apathy ; the latter still remained visible&#xD;
in her face and figure, for physical beauty&#xD;
often is ineradicable.&#xD;
,With her were three boys, in one of whom,&#xD;
our hero recognized the lad who had opened&#xD;
the door for him. But the bright, childlike&#xD;
cheeriness which had struckhim at first was&#xD;
now gone-chilled into submissive fear in the&#xD;
presence of his father,&#xD;
After Mrs. Muller had been introduced as&#xD;
the philosopher's "loving and adored better-&#xD;
half," she retired to a far corner of the room,&#xD;
and sat down near a table.&#xD;
"Now, boys!1" cried Muller; "Attention!1"&#xD;
The boys stood like leaden soldiers.&#xD;
" Forward, march 1"&#xD;
They marched as if their lives depended on&#xD;
their accuracy.&#xD;
" By the right flank I" - "By the left&#xD;
flank I" -  " Right face!" -  " Left face!"&#xD;
-"About face I" &amp;amp;c., all was done as if by&#xD;
puppets moved with wires. No animation, no&#xD;
childlike pleasure, no soul in the presence of&#xD;
the great philosopher.&#xD;
" halt I"&#xD;
There they stood, immovable--a piteous&#xD;
sight.&#xD;
" Karl, who is the god of the Jews ?"&#xD;
" Moses," was the half-unconscious answer.&#xD;
"Friederich, who is the god of the Turks ?"&#xD;
"Mohammed," was the parrot-like reply,.&#xD;
&#xD;
12&#xD;
&#xD;
"Now look out, gentlemen ItGeorge! who&#xD;
is the god of the Christians ?"&#xD;
" Blockhead," replied the youngest, with a&#xD;
listlessness, as though he intuitively felt the&#xD;
monstrosity of the answer.&#xD;
" Hal hal hal" laughed Muller, and Stillet-&#xD;
to joined in; but our hero looked toward the&#xD;
mother, who sat at the end of the room-not&#xD;
mechanically, as at first, but with bowed head,&#xD;
and weeping bitterly.&#xD;
In a few moments, however, she arose, and&#xD;
stepped boldly up to her children, kissing&#xD;
every one in quick succession, and hurried&#xD;
them to the door ; but Muller interfered, in a'&#xD;
vindictive tone,-&#xD;
" Mariana, I am not done."&#xD;
She tried to turn around in defiance, but her&#xD;
spirit was broken; she could not confront&#xD;
him; yet her motherly instinct to save her&#xD;
children prevailed, and in spite of him she&#xD;
pushed them out of the room, and followed&#xD;
them without a word.&#xD;
" My wife, like all good women, is religious,&#xD;
you know.    But this-this that you have&#xD;
heard, Mr. Montant, is my teaching, and the&#xD;
teaching of our present enlightened German&#xD;
philosophers."&#xD;
" Mr. Muller," said Ernest, unable to control&#xD;
his contempt, "you are my countryman, and I&#xD;
shall not accuse you of a desire to belittle and&#xD;
disgrace German philosophy; but if you were&#xD;
a stranger and a foreigner, and told me what&#xD;
has just past was German, in any sense of&#xD;
the word, I would give you the lie, as plumply&#xD;
and as broadly as you could wish." Mr. Mul-&#xD;
ler was not prepared to do battle with his&#xD;
equals; so he took some more beer.&#xD;
" Come, now, let us have a sociable talk&#xD;
about the business project I mentioned, which&#xD;
originated in the philosophic brain of Mr.&#xD;
Muller, and which is to be given to the wqrld&#xD;
by the practical ingenuity of Antonio Stilletto,&#xD;
now pauper; but millionaire 'in spe,' which&#xD;
being latin, is to be translated for friend Mul-&#xD;
ler's benefit. It means, in the future, Au-&#xD;
gust."&#xD;
" My education, sir," commenced the injured&#xD;
philosopher.&#xD;
" Go on with our business," interrupted&#xD;
Stilletto, impatiently.&#xD;
" Well, sir, in the weste  part of this State&#xD;
there is a county called Hocus County. One&#xD;
of its townships, called Pocus Township, con-&#xD;
tains the Ilobgoblin farm. This farm is owned&#xD;
by August Muller, and August Muller pro-&#xD;
poses to sell the said Hobgoblin farm to the&#xD;
Hobgoblin Mining and Manufacturing Com-&#xD;
pany, for the sum of fifty thousand dollars,&#xD;
in cash, and three hundred thousand dollars&#xD;
in shares of the capital stock of said company,&#xD;
taken, of course, at their par value. Antonio&#xD;
Stilletto will, on his part, sell and convey cer-&#xD;
tain patents he holds, to said company; patents&#xD;
which will enable them to utilize the mined&#xD;
material, for the sum of twenty-five thousand&#xD;
dollars, in cash, and two hundred thousand&#xD;
dollars, in stock."&#xD;
'Is the company to know what you paid&#xD;
for these lands, Mr. Muller ?" asked our here.&#xD;
" August Muller's affairs are open to the&#xD;
world," was the pompous answer. " He&#xD;

knows not what it is to conceal, unless it&#xD;
becomes his solemn duty towards his friends,&#xD;
and humanity in general, to do so. On this&#xD;
point, then, I feel obliged to answer you by a&#xD;
courteous negative."&#xD;
While Montant moralized over this strange&#xD;
speech, and its unexpected finale, Mr. Mul-&#xD;
ler descanted on the great benefits to' be&#xD;
derived by wandering underneath the surface&#xD;
of the Hobgoblin farm, and of the immense&#xD;
obligation to himself and Stilletto, humanity in&#xD;
general would stagger under, all of which, as&#xD;
Ernest Montant did, we shall pass over, as&#xD;
being of no possible interest.&#xD;
" The capital stock of the company is to be&#xD;
two millions of dollars," concluded Mr. Muller.&#xD;
"You will see that of this, one quarter must&#xD;
be transferred to Mr. Stilletto and myself.&#xD;
This would leave a million and a half to the&#xD;
subscribers. Of course some money must be&#xD;
raised at once-at least two hundred thousand&#xD;
dollars; for I must have my fifty thousand,&#xD;
cash, and my friend twenty-five thousand, and&#xD;
then one hundred thousand must be spent on&#xD;
the farm, in mining, and building the factory.&#xD;
The remaining twenty-five thousand will do&#xD;
for minor expenses, such as fitting up a&#xD;
splendid office, advertising, and feeing edit-&#xD;
ors, &amp;amp;c.&#xD;
"And how do you expect to pay a respecta-&#xD;
ble dividend on such an enormous sum as two&#xD;
millions of dollars ?" asked our hero in aston-&#xD;
ishment.&#xD;
"I confess that I miss my accustomed con-&#xD;
fidence in my plans, on that little point," an-&#xD;
swered the philosopher, with a slightly trou-&#xD;
bled look.  "It is true, that though our&#xD;
profits will be immense, I can not see that we&#xD;
can possibly pay more than seven per cent."&#xD;
"Why," cried Montant quickly, "if they&#xD;
would be satisfied with calling the capital&#xD;
stock a million, the dividend would be four-&#xD;
teen per cent., and the shares would be worth&#xD;
double as much."&#xD;
"My dear friend Stilletto and I will be in&#xD;
the ring, and we shall want all that stock to&#xD;
operate with. It is absolutely necessary to&#xD;
make a large show ; we shall lend the company&#xD;
money, if necessary, to declare one or two&#xD;
la)ge dividends, and quietly work off our stock&#xD;
during the excitement."&#xD;
"I see it all now," said our hero, with ill-&#xD;
concealed sarcasm. "It is a beautiful idea.&#xD;
I suppose poor tradespeople, tailors and shoe-&#xD;
makers, will buy that stock and pay their hard-&#xD;
earned money into your hands. Of course it&#xD;
will be a safe investment for them," he added,&#xD;
bitterly.&#xD;
" I have told you before," interposed Stil-&#xD;
letto, dryly, " that moralizing is not a word in&#xD;
the American vocabulary."&#xD;
" And I have told you that you are mistaken&#xD;
in your one-sided view of the American char-&#xD;
acter," cried Montant, angrily, but he con-&#xD;
trolled himself, and, as he had no objection to&#xD;
hear more of the scheme, he submitted to a&#xD;
long and minute disclosure of one of the most&#xD;
intricate and deeply laid plans for defrauding&#xD;
the public, imaginable.&#xD;
The result was that he left the house, hay-&#xD;
ig promptly refused to mix himself up -svith&#xD;
&#xD;
Hobgoblin or to bring it to the notice of his&#xD;
employers, whose capital and influential name&#xD;
were coveted by this worthy pair. From his&#xD;
immediate acceptance by one of the wealthiest&#xD;
firms in New York, Stilletto believed our hero&#xD;
possessed a great hold over the firm of Going&#xD;
&amp;amp; Son, and tried hard to coax him to exert his&#xD;
influence in favor of Hobgoblin.&#xD;
As he walked home that night from August&#xD;
Muller's house, he thought to himself, won-&#xD;
deringly, "How can these men be so absurd&#xD;
as to expect me, a young fellow just entering&#xD;
an office, to have such an influence with the&#xD;
principals as to be able to induce them to enter&#xD;
on such a vast enterprise upon my recommen-&#xD;
dation."&#xD;
But he did not know Stilletto's ideas on that&#xD;
subject, or that men remote from such society&#xD;
as that in which Mr. Going moved, are only&#xD;
too apt to overrate all those who seem to them&#xD;
on an equality with the coveted aristocrats, or&#xD;
he would not have been surprised at Messrs.&#xD;
Muller and Stilletto for grasping eagerly at the&#xD;
slightest chance of opening negotiations with&#xD;
Going &amp;amp; Son, and entirely overestimating his&#xD;
influence with that firm, from their ignorance&#xD;
of all above their own low Cunning.&#xD;
A few days after our hero's interview with&#xD;
Messrs. Stilletto and Muller, Mr. Stilletto, who&#xD;
seemed to have forgotten the rather sharp re-&#xD;
marks of Ernest Montant, prevailed upon the&#xD;
latter to accompany him to the house of a&#xD;
friend, in fact, a relation.-&#xD;
Not yet acquainted with the different locali-&#xD;
ties of the city, our hero was not aware that&#xD;
Antonio led him toward the lowest, vilest&#xD;
neighborhood, until the character of the streets,&#xD;
and the people they encountered, reminded&#xD;
him of similar sights in London, and he recog-&#xD;
nized that class of dens which resemble each&#xD;
other the world over-sailors' dance-houses.&#xD;
It was a scene not without a sort of fascina-&#xD;
tion for those who like to study the different&#xD;
phases of human society without stopping at&#xD;
what offends delicate taste. The streets were&#xD;
alive with a queer company of men and women,&#xD;
many of them inebriated, some singing, others&#xD;
talking very loud. Glaring lights streamed&#xD;
from the windows of the tottering houses,&#xD;
from the unobstructed hallways, from the old-&#xD;
fashioned half-doors. Sounds of shrill music&#xD;
and coarse laughter filled the air, which&#xD;
seemed to roll sluggishly in this conglomera-&#xD;
tion of dens of vice and crime, while mocking&#xD;
hilarity marked the wretches that only came&#xD;
forth in the night like wicked owls.&#xD;
Many a shadow flitted by, once filled with&#xD;
sound flesh and quick blood, but long ago&#xD;
shrunk into a grim ghost of its former self;&#xD;
in many a face, haggard despair and awful&#xD;
depravity struggled for mastery. In that queer&#xD;
and shocking crowd there glittered many uni-&#xD;
forms in dignified contrast, for the police had&#xD;
perfect control of this ward, as Stilletto in-&#xD;
formed our friend.&#xD;
"I am glad of it," said Montant, somewhat&#xD;
relieved.&#xD;
" Do you know why?" asked the Italian.&#xD;
"I dare say, New York is becoming civil-&#xD;
ized."&#xD;
." That is not the reason. The police are in-&#xD;
&#xD;
efficient and corrupt enough, but in this Fourth&#xD;
Ward they are absolutely forced to be masters&#xD;
or they would be annihilated in a week."&#xD;
" I am not surprised at that," said Montant,&#xD;
and yet I like to observe these people at&#xD;
times. I dare say, there are many among&#xD;
them who deal out much charity to their&#xD;
wretched neighbors. And a certain joviality&#xD;
is not to be mistaken. True, that the misery&#xD;
and terrible vulgarity staring out at every cor-&#xD;
ner are horrible, but there is a quaintness in the&#xD;
whole lively scene that stands in interesting&#xD;
contrast to the gilded high-life of fashionable&#xD;
quarters."&#xD;
"You see, people are more Parisian here!&#xD;
They live more in the streets than up-town&#xD;
folks."&#xD;
" I prefer even these crooked and tumble-&#xD;
down streets to the interior of those houses,&#xD;
each looking like a tottering temple of iniquity,&#xD;
rotten with the excess of depravity. But since&#xD;
you have brought me here, where are you&#xD;
going to take me? Although a visit to such&#xD;
quarters can not be misinterpreted as a tour of&#xD;
dissipation, yet I confess that another place&#xD;
might be deemed mdee fit for a young clerk---&#xD;
"Here!" interrupted Stilletto, as they now&#xD;
stood at the door of a crooked dwelling, all&#xD;
lighted up within, and strains of confused&#xD;
music bewildering the visitors, whom it was&#xD;
calculated to entice.&#xD;
" I won't go in here ! What place is it ?"&#xD;
" The Countess," answered Stilletto. " It&#xD;
is the most noted among the Italian boarding-&#xD;
houses in the city."&#xD;
'  And does your relative live here ?"&#xD;
" No," answered the other, after a moment's&#xD;
consideration.&#xD;
" Then, where lives your friend?"  -&#xD;
"We shan't go to see her-or him to-night.&#xD;
Come in."&#xD;
Montant, with the imprudence of youth,&#xD;
entered. It was a queer place. A spacious&#xD;
room filled with wild dancers; the women all&#xD;
old and homely, dressed in very short frocks,&#xD;
and atrociously painted, and without youthful&#xD;
appearance in spite of gay ribbons and luring,&#xD;
indecent behavior ; the men mostly belonging&#xD;
to the nautical persuasion and all inebriated;&#xD;
the room hung around with queer ornaments,&#xD;
consisting in endless strips of yellow and red&#xD;
papers pinned up to the ceiling in the form of&#xD;
hanging baskets and large stars.&#xD;
On one side there was a platform, perched&#xD;
upon which an old maestro was fiddling away,&#xD;
his gray hair nearly gone with dissipation,&#xD;
his toothless mouth grinning demonlike, his&#xD;
cadaverous face in ugly grimaces, and his lean&#xD;
body distorted like a Pickwickian goblin on&#xD;
a tombstone. Near him a lad was playing the&#xD;
tamborine, holding it in a dozen places at&#xD;
once--over his head, under his feet, on his&#xD;
back, and everywhere except in a natural&#xD;
position.&#xD;
But the most interesting personage was the&#xD;
countess. She looked tall, behind the bar&#xD;
over which she sold vile liquors to the reeling&#xD;
guests.&#xD;
When Montant had been told by his com-&#xD;
panion that she was the titled mistress of the&#xD;
-house, he remarked,-  '&#xD;
&#xD;
"What a strange face! Although she is an&#xD;
old and withered hag, I am certain she must&#xD;
have been beautiful. But what a mouth she&#xD;
has!"&#xD;
" What is the matter with her mouth?" ask.&#xD;
ed Stilletto, quickly.&#xD;
" When she laughs her coarse. laugh, she&#xD;
looks like a-"&#xD;
" Like a what ?"&#xD;
"Like some snarling animal. Like a&#xD;
wolf!"&#xD;
Stilletto started. Grasping his companion's&#xD;
arm, he cried, fiercely:&#xD;
"1 Have you-do you know-"&#xD;
"Let me go I" replied our hero, shaking&#xD;
him off, "What has possessed you?    She&#xD;
does look like a wolf, and this place has satia-&#xD;
ted my desire to see low life. Let us go."&#xD;
At this moment one of the dancers pushed&#xD;
violently and intentionally against Montant,&#xD;
who was neither difficult to irritate nor slow&#xD;
in action, so he knocked his assailant, a dirty-&#xD;
looking but broad-shouldered fellow, into the&#xD;
middle of the room. In an instant an ugly&#xD;
crowd threatened our hero.  The countess&#xD;
jumped into the midst of it, and Montant no-&#xD;
ticed that she was a small woman, for she&#xD;
habitually stood upon a bench behind the&#xD;
counter. A little man, very round and short-&#xD;
haired, also interfered, and, although-he wore&#xD;
no weapon or emblem of authority, the assail-&#xD;
ants recoiled from him.&#xD;
" You're a gintleman," said the little man&#xD;
quickly, to Montant, "Come out o' this. This&#xD;
ain't no place for yoa/"&#xD;
And, before he knew it, he found himself in&#xD;
the street with the little man by his side.&#xD;
" Now you're out of it-cut /" said the lat-&#xD;
ter.&#xD;
"You are a police officer ?"&#xD;
" Yes, and can tell a gintleman. You're a&#xD;
stranger here ?"&#xD;
" Yes, and would like to know the nearest&#xD;
way to a hack-stand."&#xD;
"Come along, then: I'll show you."&#xD;
" My friend has remained in there," said&#xD;
Montant, whose quick eyes the fact had not&#xD;
escaped, that Stilletto had slipped away behind&#xD;
the counter as soon as symptoms of a disturb-&#xD;
ance occurred.&#xD;
" Let him go," said the little man, and as they&#xD;
walked on briskly, he asked,-&#xD;
" What the devil makes you come to sich&#xD;
places ?"&#xD;
"My friend-"&#xD;
"Yes-I forgot your friend !"&#xD;
After a short walk, during which neither&#xD;
spoke, they reached a place where they found&#xD;
a carriage.&#xD;
Montant comprehended the policeman's mo-&#xD;
tives quite easily. He had indeed recognized&#xD;
in him a gentleman, and had taken him out of&#xD;
that "no-torious den of stubborn thiefs and&#xD;
mankillers," as he called it, with a view to&#xD;
earn a good fee. After our hero had volun-&#xD;
teered the latter, he asked,-&#xD;
"What is your name, sir ?"&#xD;
" Mr. Stump, sir-of the Metropolitan head-&#xD;
quarters in Mulberry Street."&#xD;
" Well, good night, Mr. Stump !"&#xD;
" Good night sir and thankee."&#xD;

FANTASY.&#xD;
&#xD;
As our hero- rode home, he came to the!&#xD;
conclusion that Stilletto had taken him to the&#xD;
" Countess," for the purpose of drawing him&#xD;
into a row, and probably with the hope that&#xD;
his late traveling companion, who had given&#xD;
his views too plainly during the interview at.&#xD;
Mr. Muller's, would receive a good thrashing.&#xD;
" What a fool I was to be led away in this&#xD;
manner," soliloquized Montant. " I think,&#xD;
however, that this experience will suffice to&#xD;
make me wiser."&#xD;
CHAPTER IV.&#xD;
THE PRIORY.&#xD;
There's nothing ill can dwell in such a temple;&#xD;
If the ill spirit have so fair a house,&#xD;
Good things will strive to dwell with it."&#xD;
TEMPEST.&#xD;
Miss JESSIE GoING might have commenced&#xD;
it, or the old gentleman might have brought&#xD;
it about, or Walter Going might have been&#xD;
the cause ; but the fact is, that after a few&#xD;
months our hero found himself not only a&#xD;
personal friend, but an always welcome guest&#xD;
at the grand house in Fifth Avenue.&#xD;
Miss Jessie decided that she liked him be-&#xD;
cause he was so different from other gentle-&#xD;
men she had met. Mr. Going, for reasons of&#xD;
his own, had, at first, treated him with more&#xD;
consideration than the other clerks, and soon&#xD;
became convinced that, in business or away&#xD;
from the office, he was in every -way their&#xD;
superior; and even Walter, after finding out&#xD;
that the new clerk would not allow him to&#xD;
patronize or tyrannize, treated him first as his&#xD;
equal, then as a first-rate fellow, and finally&#xD;
selected him as his especial friend and coin-&#xD;
panion.&#xD;
It would have been unnatural had so young&#xD;
a man as Ernest Montantt not been gratified&#xD;
and proud at his personal success with people&#xD;
who, in point of education, name, wealth, and&#xD;
position, were among the tip-top aristocracy&#xD;
of New York ; but he tried hard so to shape&#xD;
his conduct toward his fellow-clerks, as to&#xD;
allow them to forget as much as possible that&#xD;
he was an object for envy. But he did not&#xD;
entirely succeed, for he was never admitted&#xD;
into that sort of masonry which always exists&#xD;
among the clerks in one office.&#xD;
Mr. Going, with the fine instincts of a true&#xD;
gentleman, observed and appreciated his ef-&#xD;
forts to overcome the prejudices of his col-&#xD;
leagues. Walter Going laughingly advised&#xD;
him to let them go to the devil, and promised&#xD;
to clear them all out, if he found cause for&#xD;
serious complaint, while Miss Jessie declared&#xD;
that he was the only gentleman from the&#xD;
office that she ever could endure.&#xD;
So it will not surprise us very much to see,&#xD;
in this phaeton, just driving away from the&#xD;
door of the house in Fifth Avenue, Ernest&#xD;
Montant, seated by Walter Going, who was&#xD;
driving four-in-hand, while Mr. Going occupied&#xD;
the back scat with another gentleman. This&#xD;
other gentleman was very fat, and his face&#xD;
was very red. and his head very bald uinder-&#xD;
&#xD;
neath his pompous, broad-brimmed hat. His&#xD;
features were good-even attractive to some;&#xD;
but the close observer noticed something disa-&#xD;
greeable in his expression. Was it selfishness?&#xD;
Was it sensuality? Was it brutality? Was it&#xD;
conceit ? But his acts and words, as recorded in&#xD;
this veracious narrative, will tell us plainly&#xD;
the character of Mr. Christian Fatman. the&#xD;
great banker and financial man of Broad Street.&#xD;
He was well dressed, even foppish in his ap-&#xD;
pearance, and had a fat laugh that sounded&#xD;
fatly good-natured.&#xD;
Away they went on that fine, bracing&#xD;
spring morning. It was one of the few holi-&#xD;
days permitted in New York, and the party&#xD;
were going to visit a large estate fifteen or&#xD;
twenty miles from the city, which Mr. Going&#xD;
contemplated purchasing. The four splendid&#xD;
bays, well handled, danced through the city,&#xD;
through the park, out on the wide smooth road&#xD;
in the welcome sunlight, where Walter cracked&#xD;
his whip, and away they-flew, while everybody&#xD;
looked out as they passed, some admiring, some&#xD;
envying, some even scowling; but the boys on&#xD;
the road-side cheered then vociferously.&#xD;
"It is a palatial residence, the ' Priory,'-a&#xD;
palatial' residence, Mr. Going," said Mr. Fat-&#xD;
man. "I would like to buy it myself, if I&#xD;
could afford it."&#xD;
I am not so sure that I can afford it," said&#xD;
Mr. Going, gravely. " And then the expense&#xD;
of keeping up such an establishment."-&#xD;
" You may get it for two hundred thousand,"&#xD;
replied Mr. Fatman."  " And, besides, they&#xD;
will leave one hundred and fifty on mortgage."&#xD;
Our hero pricked up his ears at the word&#xD;
"mortgage," and ruminated gravely. "When&#xD;
I buy a palatial residence, I shall pay cash for&#xD;
it. Mortgages are the first underminers of a&#xD;
house, and betoken a poor foundation."&#xD;
" The property is sure to rise in value," said&#xD;
Mr. Fatman, " and I expect to see the day&#xD;
when that two hundred acres will be worth&#xD;
double what you will have to pay for them.&#xD;
If I understand the matter, old John Jacob&#xD;
Van Strom would never sell it, if his son were&#xD;
not a sort of cross between an idiot and a&#xD;
maniac."&#xD;
" He has been in the lunatic asylum. once&#xD;
already, has he not ?" asked Walter Going.&#xD;
"Yes; and should be there now. It is a&#xD;
great pity that the elder son, George, died of&#xD;
drink. He was a fine fellow, and I knew him&#xD;
well. What in the world made him, rich as he&#xD;
was, and married to a beautiful woman, go to&#xD;
the dogs, I can not imagine."&#xD;
"She is very handsome, eh ?" asked Walter.&#xD;
"Superb! A figure like Venus; in fact.&#xD;
the most voluptuous woman I ever saw-ex-&#xD;
cuse the expression, Mr. Going. Look to your&#xD;
heart, Walter; and you too, Mr. Montant."&#xD;
Walter whipped up his horses, and made no&#xD;
reply; except an incredulous smile, which our&#xD;
hero seemed to understand, for he half-smiled&#xD;
himself.&#xD;
" The old fellow, you know, is a queer&#xD;
fish," said Mr. Fatman. "His son's craziness&#xD;
is not altogether an original accomplishment,&#xD;
and old Van Strom, for some reason or other,-&#xD;
'pen my word I don't believe he knows him-&#xD;
self,-hates this young widow, this -Joseuhineo&#xD;
&#xD;
17&#xD;
&#xD;
Van Strom. He barely permits her to live at&#xD;
the 'Priory,' although she is as poor as Job's&#xD;
turkey, having only a few hundreds a year&#xD;
from the estate of her father, General McLane.&#xD;
I wonder what she will do when the place is&#xD;
sold, for the old man intends to take John to&#xD;
Europe, immediately, I understand?"&#xD;
"Old Mrs. Van Strom is dead, and young&#xD;
John unmarried?" asked Mr. Going.&#xD;
"John Jacob is a widower," answered Mr.&#xD;
Fatman. Mr. Going heaved a sigh, for a few&#xD;
years ago he had buried his own wife.&#xD;
"I am quite interested in all this, Mr. Fat-&#xD;
man," said the old gentleman, "for, though I&#xD;
have met Mr. Van Strom, I never heard his&#xD;
family history. I wonder if I could not make&#xD;
some arrangements for the comfort of the&#xD;
- young widow, in case I buy the estate."&#xD;
'Always chivalrous, father," laughed Wal-&#xD;
ter.&#xD;
"Yes, as an old man should be. You, young&#xD;
gentlemen, as a rule, are chivalrous only to&#xD;
the young and fascinating; I endeavor to pro-&#xD;
tect and assist all the sex, young or old, hand-&#xD;
some or homely." He said this quietly, with-&#xD;
out ostentation, and many of his friends knew&#xD;
that it was true.&#xD;
Time passes rapidly when one is in motion,&#xD;
and the square, fast gait of the horses short-&#xD;
ened the tedium of the long drive. Walter&#xD;
Going and our hero kept up a conversation in&#xD;
a confidential undertone, probably on a confi-&#xD;
dential subject, for they had become intimate&#xD;
friends since Ernest had showed that he&#xD;
loved cricket and played it well. "No man&#xD;
who is fond of violent exercise can be an en-&#xD;
tire fool," reasoned Mr. Walter, and upon&#xD;
coming more in contact with his friend, he&#xD;
found that he was the most taciturn man lie&#xD;
ever had met, with reference to his own or&#xD;
other people's affairs, so he gradually unfolded&#xD;
to him a secret, a great secret-that which had&#xD;
made our hero smile when Mr. Fatman cau-&#xD;
tioned Walter to look to his heart when in&#xD;
Josephine Van Strom's presence. This secret&#xD;
we must leave unraveled for the present, for&#xD;
here we are at the "Priory." "Turn to the&#xD;
right, Walter, over' that bridge, for Van&#xD;
Strom's estate consists of that island, and this&#xD;
bridge spanning that small arm of Long Island&#xD;
Sound, connects it to the main-land, and West-&#xD;
chester County."&#xD;
"Splendid trees!" said Mr. Going.&#xD;
"Noble, royal trees!" added Mr. Fatman.&#xD;
"So far the thing is glorious I" cried Walter,&#xD;
as they dashed along a winding road through&#xD;
the park.&#xD;
"List to the rooks," quoted Mr. Fatman,&#xD;
laughing, as they startled some old crows&#xD;
overhead.&#xD;
"Swell place this," said Walter.&#xD;
"A palatial residence," corroborated Mr.&#xD;
Fatman, leaning back in style and comfort, as&#xD;
theyemerged from the woods, and a long curve&#xD;
arGund a beautifully sloping lawn brought&#xD;
them to the door of the house, massive and&#xD;
noble in its appearance.&#xD;
"Good architecture, good walls, no humbug&#xD;
about this," said Mr. Fatman, gathering up his-&#xD;
fatness to alight.&#xD;
"Woodbine and honeysuckle to the very&#xD;
2&#xD;
&#xD;
roof. This is indeed a place after my own&#xD;
heart!t" said old Mr. Going, with real enthu-&#xD;
siasm.&#xD;
" A palatial residence, indeed," said Mr.&#xD;
Fatman.&#xD;
They were met at the door by a small old&#xD;
man, with thin legs and a bald head, who&#xD;
bade them welcome in a whining voice. This&#xD;
was John Jacob Van Strom. Behind him, in&#xD;
the doorway, loomed up a shadow-a creature&#xD;
of the imagination, a lank creature, an awk-&#xD;
ward creature, whose arms were too long,&#xD;
whose forehead was too low, whose eyes were&#xD;
too small, and whose nose and jaws were too&#xD;
protuberant.  This was John Jacob Van&#xD;
Strom, Junior.&#xD;
Leaving the horses to the care of the&#xD;
groom, the party went into the house, where&#xD;
they were expected. Mr. Going, Mr. Fatman,&#xD;
and Mr. Van Strom walked together, and&#xD;
John Jacob, Junior, followed his father like&#xD;
a cur, with a vapid grin, leaving Walter and&#xD;
our hero to make observations to each&#xD;
other.&#xD;
" The very doors have a port-wine look&#xD;
about them; see how the old varnish has&#xD;
become crusty. This is the place for a gentle-&#xD;
man to live in. What dinners could be given&#xD;
in this dining hall! Do you see these oak&#xD;
panels? - these old carved side-boards?-&#xD;
this grand old table ?-And can't you imagine&#xD;
my father sitting at the head of it, a large&#xD;
company around it, and the dinner arranged&#xD;
by me ?  By George! we must buy the place!&#xD;
And then the view from this bow-window !&#xD;
Look at the Sound, and the boats, and think&#xD;
of fishing, and yachting, and smoking a fine&#xD;
cigar in this back piazza after dinner, hey, my&#xD;
boy!"&#xD;
They walked back into the great hall, which&#xD;
reached up to the very roof of the house.&#xD;
" Look at these confounded old family por.&#xD;
traits," said Walter. "I dare say they are&#xD;
the old Van Stroms; but if the old fellows&#xD;
were as ugly as they now look, all covered&#xD;
with dust and cob-webs, I do not wonder at&#xD;
the physical attractions of their last edition,&#xD;
J. J., Jr."&#xD;
" I see you can become quite enthusiastic,&#xD;
Walter."&#xD;
"About a place like this, certainly. Like a&#xD;
fine old English gentleman, all of the olden&#xD;
time," he hummed gayly in response.&#xD;
They visited the bedrooms up stairs and the&#xD;
billiard-room, and the picture gallery (without&#xD;
any pictures.) Walter decided that it would&#xD;
make a capital ball-room, and so they finally&#xD;
came down stairs to the reception room,&#xD;
where a lady awaited them. She had superb&#xD;
golden hair, framing a face of exquisite com-&#xD;
plexion, and a softness, of manner, an un-&#xD;
speakable delicacy,. and yet warmth, in all&#xD;
that she said and did, which especially&#xD;
charmed the young men.&#xD;
" This, gentlemen," said old Mr. Van Strom,&#xD;
in his cracked voice, "is my daughter-in-law,&#xD;
Mrs. G. Van Strom, with whom I am not on&#xD;
very good terms."&#xD;
She colored deeply; but her features re-&#xD;
mained unmoved, and with downcast eyes&#xD;
she made a courtesy.-&#xD;

&#xD;
jf&#xD;
&#xD;
"Madame," said old Mr. Going, coming&#xD;
heartily over toward her, "I am half ashamed to&#xD;
force so many gentlemen upon your solitude&#xD;
at once; but I hope you will excuse us, and&#xD;
believe that we are doubly honored by your&#xD;
father-in-law's kind introduction."&#xD;
Mr. Van Strom did not notice this well-&#xD;
merited rebuke.&#xD;
"This'gentleman, who is so kind to you,&#xD;
Josephine," he continued, brusquely, "is Mr.&#xD;
Going, who will probably buy the place, and&#xD;
this, is my friend Mr. Fatman."&#xD;
Mr. Fatman spoke out hastily: "Madame,&#xD;
I am quite sure that were I your father-in-&#xD;
law, my taste is sufficiently cultivated to ap-&#xD;
preciate you, and remain on the best terms&#xD;
with you."&#xD;
Mr. Fatman meant well enough; but his&#xD;
coarse nature prevented him from seeing that&#xD;
he only brought up the unpleasantness again,&#xD;
and in far worse taste. Josephine, after hav-&#xD;
ing bowed to the gentlemen, said softly, but&#xD;
in a pained voice,-&#xD;
"It seems strange to me to receive you,&#xD;
gentlemen, in this house; but being the only&#xD;
lady here, I must do the honors, and welcome&#xD;
you all, as though it were mine, for to-day."&#xD;
" Come along to the stables," cried Mr. Van&#xD;
Strom.&#xD;
So they left the poor. widow in the draw-&#xD;
ing-room and inspected the stables and pad-&#xD;
docks in which some ancestorial Van Strom&#xD;
had once kept his racers, perhaps with a crazy&#xD;
idea of introducing the " Derby" into America&#xD;
before America was sufficiently civilized for&#xD;
that amusement, as Walter Going remarked&#xD;
to his companion.&#xD;
At all events, the stables were now empty&#xD;
and dilapidated, and the paddocks resembled&#xD;
the ruins of some field fortification, interest-&#xD;
ing, perhaps, to the antiquarian, but not in&#xD;
the least to a horseman.&#xD;
"I shall repair the inclosures, take out the&#xD;
stones and rocks, rebuild the stables, and&#xD;
make a place of it that will challenge all&#xD;
England!1" cried Walter, who this day seemed&#xD;
to have exchanged his usual dull and blase&#xD;
manner for the merry fire of a school-boy.&#xD;
"Do you keep no horses, Van Strom?"&#xD;
asked Mr. Fatman.&#xD;
"Yes, sir," was the reply, as he led the way&#xD;
to a tumble-down barn, standing separate from&#xD;
the stables. "Ikeep a pair of carriage horses,&#xD;
and my son has a light mare,"&#xD;
" The best mare in the country," said John&#xD;
J., Junior, smiling timidly.&#xD;
" Let us see them," suggested Walter ; and&#xD;
after groping amongst hay and dirt, and the&#xD;
rotten remnants of stalls, they discovered two&#xD;
black animals, and one yellow one.&#xD;
" These black ones are the carriage horses,"&#xD;
said the lord of the "Priory," "they were&#xD;
bought-"&#xD;
"By your grandfather, sir ?" queried Wal-&#xD;
ter, dryly, as he examined hem.&#xD;
"By my father, sir," answered the other, a&#xD;
little severely. "They are only about twenty&#xD;
years old."&#xD;
Walter nodded his unqualified belief in the&#xD;
statement, and proceeded to look at the appa-&#xD;
rition in the third stall.&#xD;
&#xD;
"I'll lead her out, sir," said John J, Junior,&#xD;
mildly; and by a good deal of " Whoa, pet1"&#xD;
and " Come, girl," and great exertion, he finally&#xD;
produced the creature to full view.&#xD;
"That's a noble mare," said Walter, biting&#xD;
his lips.&#xD;
"I thought you were a horseman!" cried&#xD;
John, with delight. "You look like a horse-&#xD;
man, give us your hand, sir. Indeed, you are&#xD;
a judge of a horse. Now, this mare, gentle-&#xD;
men, I love. Sho is the dearest, faithfullest&#xD;
creature in the world, and unless she stands&#xD;
still, I tell you she can go!"&#xD;
"You don't say!1 That's wonderful," cried&#xD;
Walter, much amused.&#xD;
" What I mean by standing still is this, that&#xD;
sometimes she takes a notion to stop short on&#xD;
the road, and when she does, I don't attempt&#xD;
to make her go."&#xD;
"I would not if I were you," said Walter,&#xD;
sagely; and so the mare was dismissed, and&#xD;
the party turned toward the house once more.&#xD;
"These lawns remind    me   of  'merry&#xD;
England," said Mr. Going, "and the trees are&#xD;
the finest I have seen on any gentleman's&#xD;
place this side of the Atlantic."&#xD;
Mr. Van Strom looked pleased, as though he&#xD;
thought the price of his estate was growing&#xD;
larger in his guest's mind, and led the way to&#xD;
the gardens, graperies, and hot-houses. Mr.&#xD;
Going enjoyed the examination exceedingly,&#xD;
and busied his imagination with planning the&#xD;
improvements he would make after he had&#xD;
bought the "Priory."&#xD;
"IIow did the name originate ?" he asked.&#xD;
"The 'Priory?' Oh, there is a long story&#xD;
connected with that," said old Van Strom.&#xD;
"Tell us the story," suggested Mr. Fatman,&#xD;
but the lowering brow and melancholy ex-&#xD;
pression of Mr. Van Strom's face forbade fur.&#xD;
other questioning, as lie said,-&#xD;
"I would rather not. It is an old family&#xD;
legend, and discusses subjects which, at my&#xD;
age, I should shrink from approaching, lest I&#xD;
arouse the dead too soon to receive me among&#xD;
them. Let it pass, and I will show you the&#xD;
last vestige of the actual 'Priory."'&#xD;
By this time they had walked entirely&#xD;
around the house, and reached an old but&#xD;
still mighty elm, upon one of whose branches&#xD;
hung a large bell. It was a very curious bell,&#xD;
of a yellow composition, and not unartistically&#xD;
decorated with bas-reliefs, representing de-&#xD;
formed human figures, such as monks, with&#xD;
dwarfed legs and wooden coats, and women,&#xD;
with outlandish noses and horrible mouths.&#xD;
" Its proper place is in the turret on the&#xD;
roof," explained Van Strom, "but I had it&#xD;
taken down and put here for convenience&#xD;
sake, as I use it to call the men from the field&#xD;
at dinner-time."&#xD;
" And they say-"&#xD;
" Never mind it, John," said his father. "It&#xD;
can not interest the gentlemen."&#xD;
But Mr. Fatman was not to be balked thus;&#xD;
so, with an engaging smile, he encouraged the&#xD;
young man to continue.&#xD;
" They say, that whenever any of the family&#xD;
are going to be very sick or die, or something&#xD;
dreadful is going to happen, that bell rings oni&#xD;
the night before, and, if it happens only the&#xD;
&#xD;
next night instead of the next morning, it&#xD;
rings again while things are going on."&#xD;
" This is indeed the story, gentlemen," said&#xD;
old Van Strom, " but, of course, we can not&#xD;
expect you to believe it."&#xD;
"Why, everybody must believe it, father,"&#xD;
said John, fearful lest his wonder should lack&#xD;
credence, " for it rang the night before mother&#xD;
died, and the night before George died, and&#xD;
the night before Joe's little girl died, and the&#xD;
night-,,."&#xD;
"Never mind, John," said the old man, dis-&#xD;
mally, "this is not a pleasing subject anyway,&#xD;
and the bell can only ring twice more and then&#xD;
it may burst."&#xD;
"These are cheerful specimens of humani-&#xD;
ty," said Walter Going, im the ear of Ernest.&#xD;
"I think they have a couple of ghostly bells&#xD;
ringing in each of their monstrous ears."&#xD;
-       may I inquire," lie said aloud, " who it is&#xD;
that rings this instrument on such occasions."&#xD;
"God only knows,'t replied the old man,&#xD;
looking upward."&#xD;
"If my father buys the place, I shall make&#xD;
a vigorous attempt to share that knowledge,&#xD;
and if I find a human brute at the rope, I'll&#xD;
lower the bell, just over his head, and ring him&#xD;
deaf and dumb," said Walter, decidedly.&#xD;
From the dissension of this mystery they&#xD;
were called to lunch, which was served in the&#xD;
dining-room and presided over by Mrs. Van&#xD;
Strom. As the three elder men had now ar-&#xD;
rived at the question of price and terms of&#xD;
payment, they, with young John, occupied one&#xD;
end of the table, so that Walter Going and our&#xD;
hero found their places on either side of the&#xD;
fair widow.&#xD;
"We shall have the pleasure of your com-&#xD;
pany till evening,' gentlemen, I hope," she&#xD;
said, in her rich, deep voice, that had withal a&#xD;
sort of metallic tone, indicative of a very warm&#xD;
heart. Our hero, too, watched her closely,&#xD;
and admired her considerably.&#xD;
Yes, madam," replied Walter, " we will&#xD;
take the liberty of resting till four o'clock,&#xD;
and, as it is only half-past twelve now, you&#xD;
will have to put up with us for some hours yet."&#xD;
"It is quite a change, and a real pleasure&#xD;
for me, to see any one nowadays," she said,&#xD;
with a sad smile. "This place, which, with&#xD;
hospitality and good company, could be made&#xD;
all that is delightful, is dreary and lonely&#xD;
enough for the solitary woman incarcerated&#xD;
here."&#xD;
Although the words glided from her lips in&#xD;
a half whisper, old Van Strom had, in all like-&#xD;
lihood, overheard them, for, when luncheon&#xD;
wis barely finished, he said with an angry&#xD;
scowl.&#xD;
Josephine, my dear, coffee and cigars are&#xD;
not generally graced with ladies' society, as&#xD;
you should know by this time."&#xD;
She arose and moved to the door, but all&#xD;
the guests arose with her. In their respectful&#xD;
manner she recognized that-they felt for her,&#xD;
and as old Mr. Going shook her by the hand,&#xD;
with that kindness and delicacy which every&#xD;
woman appreciates, and thus manifested his&#xD;
sympathy; she felt the tears starting to her&#xD;
eysand was forced to leave the room ab-&#xD;
&#xD;
18&#xD;
&#xD;
Mr. Fatman could not restrain himself&#xD;
"Van Strom," he- said, angrily, "I have&#xD;
known you many years, and I take the liberty&#xD;
of telling you plainly, that your treatment of&#xD;
your daughter-in-law is a disgrace to your&#xD;
good name."&#xD;
"No, no, no, my friend," answered the half-&#xD;
witted old man, " You don't understand the&#xD;
case - I have remembered her handsomely&#xD;
in my will," and he winked at the young men,&#xD;
aind smiled cunningly.&#xD;
" I bet he lies," whispered Walter to his&#xD;
companion, and we may as well inform the&#xD;
reader that his opinion proved correct. John&#xD;
Jacob Van Strom, among other freaks of ec-&#xD;
centricity, had taken such a dislike to his fair&#xD;
relative, that he indeed denied her all assist-&#xD;
ance during his life and after his death, be-&#xD;
yond the bare permission to remain under his&#xD;
roof.  Even this was so much accompanied&#xD;
with coarse insult, such as we have witnessed,&#xD;
that she only staid there for a few weeks at a&#xD;
time, preferring to live as she might, on her&#xD;
almost beggarly means, than to submit and&#xD;
endure, where submission and endurance be-&#xD;
came revolting.&#xD;
No definite result, with regard to the pur-&#xD;
chase of the property, could quickly be reach-&#xD;
ed with so whimsical a character as old Van&#xD;
Strom. One moment he would be ready to&#xD;
close the bargain, but the next would sudden-&#xD;
ly change it to the conclusion that, after all,&#xD;
he would keep the estate, were it only out of&#xD;
respect to the seedy-looking, ancestorial assem-&#xD;
blage in the hall.&#xD;
After coffee, cigars, and petits verres, they&#xD;
inspected the wine cellars, closets, and plate,&#xD;
finding many treasures laid up by the great-&#xD;
grandfathers of the present owner,,probably&#xD;
unknown, and certainly unappreciated  by&#xD;
him.&#xD;
Finally, they resolved to spend the remain-&#xD;
ing hours before their departure in the open&#xD;
air, so they sallied forth in a body into the park.&#xD;
As the conversation still ran upon matters of&#xD;
business uninteresting to our hero, he saunter-&#xD;
ed apart to enjoy an uninterrupted soliloquy.&#xD;
The sky being very blue and the air very&#xD;
balmy, his heart warmed to a sunny object-&#xD;
and he thought of Jessie Going.&#xD;
" Am I in love with her or not ?" he asked&#xD;
himself, thoughtfully, "I hope not," he con-&#xD;
tinued, sagely, and after considering all the&#xD;
pros and cons with care and close scrutiny of&#xD;
his heart, he finally came to the conclusion,&#xD;
that, although he might be 'smitten,' yet there&#xD;
was nothing like a settled passion--a hove,&#xD;
which, if disappointed, would interfere with&#xD;
his peace of mind.&#xD;
" It is certainly quite natural that I should&#xD;
be fascinated by a beautiful and accomplished&#xD;
woman in a station above me, who has shown,&#xD;
by many kindnesses and little marks of atten-&#xD;
tion, if not decided preference, at least hearty,&#xD;
goodwill toward me. On the other hand, I am&#xD;
convinced, after cool deliberation, that I am not&#xD;
in love, which shows that I am not so very easily&#xD;
won, and that I possess quite a modicum of&#xD;
independence. The conquest of a weak heart&#xD;
cnnot givecy.a woman much satisfaction, I&#xD;

Losing himself in thought, he also lost his&#xD;
way in the park, and was wandering whither&#xD;
his rambling would lead him, when a few&#xD;
steps brought him out of the trees, and show-&#xD;
ed him a fine view of the Sound. Within a&#xD;
stone's throw stood a summer-house, fantasti-&#xD;
cally built upon a rock. and, approaching it, he&#xD;
found himself in the presence of Josephine&#xD;
Van Strom.&#xD;
CHAPTER V.&#xD;
JOSEPHINE VAN STROM.&#xD;
"I am too fond; and therefore thou may'st think&#xD;
ty 'haviour light,&#xD;
But trust me, gentleman, I'l1 prove more true&#xD;
Than thnse that have more cunning to be strange.',&#xD;
RMoEo AND .ULIET.&#xD;
SHE was reclining in a rustic arm-chair, ap-&#xD;
parently unconscious of her surroundings,&#xD;
and lost in thought. Though her gaze was&#xD;
directed toward the extended view of the&#xD;
Sound, there appeared no enthusiasm in her&#xD;
dreamily lustrous eyes for the beautiful&#xD;
scene. Our hero did not wish to disturb her,&#xD;
but could not forego the pleasure of watching&#xD;
her, unobserved himself. At this moment of&#xD;
supreme repose, her purely classic face pre-&#xD;
sented to his enthusiastic mind, a living&#xD;
image of the Queen of Heaven, as painted by&#xD;
Raphael; with womanly holiness; but also&#xD;
the passions and sufferings of her sex written&#xD;
in it, all framed in the golden glory of her&#xD;
hair. The beautiful contour of her figure was&#xD;
half hidden, half indicated by her loose sum-&#xD;
mer dress, her round and snowy arm peeping&#xD;
out of the white folds, and her hand, itself a&#xD;
gem of soft perfection, rested upon a little&#xD;
table beside her, where she had laid her straw&#xD;
hat and some wild flowers.&#xD;
Ernest Montant was not bashful nor yet&#xD;
systematically bold, and gazing, he finally&#xD;
made up his mind to speak to her.&#xD;
"iMrs. Van Strom," he said,. when he found&#xD;
that she had not heard his approach, "I hope&#xD;
you will pardon me for this interruption."&#xD;
She started at his unexpected voice, and&#xD;
with a woman's instinct turned full upon him&#xD;
to judge his motive.  The inspection was&#xD;
satisfactory, for she smiled, a smile which&#xD;
blended the little stray wrinkles of care and&#xD;
sorrow about her full and charming mouth&#xD;
into the loveliness of youth and beauty to&#xD;
which her years entitled her, though the&#xD;
littleness of man had imbittered her short&#xD;
life.&#xD;
And indeed she was not the only woman&#xD;
who would have graciously smiled upon him as&#xD;
he stood in the vigor of young manhood, with&#xD;
his clear red and white complexion, his eyes&#xD;
sparkling, perhaps with admiration for her, his&#xD;
attitude graceful, and his voice deep and melo-&#xD;
dious. Long afterward, Josephine acknowl-&#xD;
edged~ that the strength of will he uncon-&#xD;
sciously displayed, in trifles as in more&#xD;
eventful moments, formed his greatest charm&#xD;
for a woman, and on his forehead seenmedl&#xD;
written :-Indomitable moral courage, un-&#xD;
&#xD;
faltering, inflexible integrity of character;&#xD;
and through every change of his dark blue&#xD;
eyes there shone an earnestness, which&#xD;
proved none the lest powerful because often&#xD;
softened and diverted by the sprightliness of&#xD;
his youth.&#xD;
" No interruption, sir," she said, gathering&#xD;
her light shawl around her shoulders, "for&#xD;
I was doing nothing in the fullest sense of the&#xD;
word. Will you take a seat ?"&#xD;
So he took a seat, and, when invited by her,&#xD;
he produced his cigar-case and lighted a fra-&#xD;
grant Havana.&#xD;
" My husband was a great smoker," she&#xD;
said, with a sigh, "so I am accustomed to it."&#xD;
"1I have heard of your misfortunes and with&#xD;
deep regret Madam," replied our hero.&#xD;
" They have been great, sir, and you will&#xD;
find in me a very lonely woman, and much to&#xD;
be pitied, for I am only twenty-one."&#xD;
There was a charming navietd in her man-&#xD;
ner of speaking.&#xD;
"Do you not go into society, Mrs. Van&#xD;
Strom ?" he asked.&#xD;
"My father-in-law," she replied, coloring&#xD;
slightly, "does not see fit to permit me any&#xD;
pleasures, with the exception of tolerating me&#xD;
here for a few months in the year. Now that&#xD;
the place is to be sold, even that comfort will&#xD;
be denied me."&#xD;
She said. all this very simply and uncom-&#xD;
plainingly, and then, changing her tone,&#xD;
added,-&#xD;
" I do not know what makes me speak of"&#xD;
myself to a stranger, as if I could expect him&#xD;
to find it interestin'."&#xD;
"Perhaps he is finding it more so than some&#xD;
of your nearest friends," said he, smiling.&#xD;
" I know to what you allude; but I am so&#xD;
resigned to what I have to undergo, at the&#xD;
hands of my father-in-law, that my feelings&#xD;
have become blunted."   Something in her&#xD;
tone contradicted this assertion, and as she&#xD;
rapidly turned her gaze to the endless watery&#xD;
waste of the Sound, there ensued a pause.&#xD;
"Do you know, sir, that I have not yet&#xD;
become acquainted with your name ?" she said&#xD;
after awhile.&#xD;
"My name is Ernest Montant,"-ho answered&#xD;
promptly. " I am a clerk with the house of&#xD;
Going &amp;amp; Son. My father is in England,&#xD;
and is a former friend of our senior partner."&#xD;
" In England ? But I should have taken you&#xD;
to be a German."&#xD;
" I am German," was the answer ; " German&#xD;
by birth, half German by blood, and entirely&#xD;
German by persuasion. if I may so call it;"&#xD;
"I like Germans," was her reply. "They&#xD;
are more intelligent than other people, and&#xD;
have more heart, I think."&#xD;
" If I were not a German I would venture&#xD;
to say you are right."&#xD;
"I can not bear people who seem to have&#xD;
no heart," said Josephine, warmly.&#xD;
"-Because you have a very warm one your-&#xD;
self," cried our hero, boldly, for her simplicity&#xD;
and artlessness seemed so genuine that her&#xD;
words went to his heart, and he felt impelled&#xD;
to speak without restraint.&#xD;
" Do you think so?" she asked, coquettishly,&#xD;
and looking him full in the face with her&#xD;
&#xD;
great blue eyes. He could scarcely meet her&#xD;
gaze unflinchingly, so he answered,-&#xD;
"I can only tell you, Mrs. Van Strom, that,&#xD;
in my humble opinion, you would command the&#xD;
devotion of many, so that I think you should&#xD;
not be altogether dissatisfied with the lot ac-&#xD;
corded you. Call this flattery, if you choose.&#xD;
I never flatter, and seldom speak as plainly,&#xD;
I assure you, as I have just spoken to you."&#xD;
"I believe you are sincere, Mr. Montant,&#xD;
and it would be absurd and untruthful in a&#xD;
woman like me to deny being truly gratified&#xD;
by your praise."&#xD;
It would be hard to tell how it came about,&#xD;
but rarely do two people approach intimacy&#xD;
as rapidly as did our hero and the lovely&#xD;
widow. They arose to take a walk.&#xD;
" There is another little island, quite stony&#xD;
and deserted, connected with, this one by a&#xD;
sort of dilapidated dam or mole-if you are&#xD;
not too fatigued I will show it to you." So&#xD;
said Mrs. Van Strom, and our hero followed&#xD;
her most willingly. The wind was fresh, and&#xD;
blew the folds of Josephine's light summer-&#xD;
dress tightly around her. Hers companion&#xD;
possessed a high and manly purity which we&#xD;
shall always find in him, but he could not help&#xD;
wondering, as the spring breezes revealed&#xD;
to him more of the widow's palpable charms,&#xD;
that George Van Strom should have been&#xD;
such a fool as to kill himself by drinking.&#xD;
They stood upon the rocks which reached&#xD;
boldly out into the sound, and watched the&#xD;
waves breaking at their feet with useless per-&#xD;
severance. le spread her shawl out upon&#xD;
the sunny stones, and sat at her feet. - As he&#xD;
looked at the water, and the sky, and at her&#xD;
face, and into her eyes, the genial sun shone&#xD;
into his heart; and she-had she not, at their&#xD;
very first meeting, felt that sympathy toward&#xD;
him, that confidence, that budding affection,&#xD;
which knows no cause or reason, but is one&#xD;
of the mysterious works of Nature ?&#xD;
" Near this place," she said, " I first heard&#xD;
the vows of my husband. I was then but&#xD;
seventeen, and I believe I was so inexperienced&#xD;
and impressible that any man whom I did not&#xD;
positively dislike could have prevailed upon&#xD;
me to accept him. The moon was shining&#xD;
brightly and the night was divine. He was a&#xD;
handsome, good-hearted fellow, and I was a&#xD;
foolish child.- I accepted him-we were mar-&#xD;
ried that same summer, and before my childI&#xD;
was born I was a widow. My happiness had&#xD;
been buried long before the grave received&#xD;
the remains of his weakness and folly. This&#xD;
is my history."&#xD;
"And it is a history," said he, gravely,&#xD;
"which, though its outlines be before the&#xD;
world, can not be understood by a soul on&#xD;
earth but yourself. A loving heart forced to&#xD;
witness the gradual living decay of the being&#xD;
it most cherished. Oh. Mrs. Van Strom! I&#xD;
can not mention but I can go ans at the details&#xD;
of your sufferings, and if, to- lay, you were to&#xD;
be married to a friend of mine, I would take&#xD;
him aside and say to him, ' From the moment&#xD;
you claim her as your wife, you should con-&#xD;
sider yourself the means selected by Provi-&#xD;
dence to reward her for her trials. 11cr suf-&#xD;
ferings in times past must be present with you&#xD;
&#xD;
always; they must stand between you and&#xD;
your faults, between you and all temper and&#xD;
discord; and they should inspire you with the&#xD;
sacred duty of living for her happiness to the&#xD;
latest breath of your existence!'"&#xD;
He did not know why he thus spoke to her.&#xD;
She did not know why it was, that, although&#xD;
he raked up the buried past, his words did not&#xD;
wound her, but solaced and comforted her be-&#xD;
yond measure.   She looked at him-in her&#xD;
eyes there stood sacred tears.&#xD;
"Speak on," she said, softly. "I could lis-&#xD;
ten to you forever."&#xD;
Beware, Ernest Montant !  You and this&#xD;
woman are on dangerous ground; and if you&#xD;
had more experience with the sex, you would&#xD;
read danger in the throbbing of your own&#xD;
heart, danger in the expression of that Madon-&#xD;
na-like face, danger to you and your prospects&#xD;
with Jessie.&#xD;
But he talked away, in manly and yet sympa-&#xD;
thetic accents, until the bright tears streamed,&#xD;
unchecked, down her cheek. He arose, took&#xD;
her hand and begged her pardon.&#xD;
"Pardon? For what, my friend," she said,&#xD;
composing herself. "This conversation has&#xD;
been like a sunbeam in my dreary life, and yet&#xD;
I never knew you before to-day. It is very&#xD;
singular-" she ended, shaking her head&#xD;
dreamily; and he echoed the sentiment, and&#xD;
the drowsy trees heard it and rustled it to&#xD;
each other, and the zephyrs breathed it over&#xD;
the silver ripples of the water-all nature&#xD;
heard it and knew it before. "Singular," and&#xD;
yet not new.&#xD;
" Well," he said, in an altered, manner.&#xD;
"Well, I suppose that this gentleman, to&#xD;
whom I was going to give all this wholesome&#xD;
advice, with such astounding impudence, will&#xD;
soon make his appearance."&#xD;
Josephine shook her head with a smile.&#xD;
"No," she said, "I have not been in love&#xD;
since I was a widow. I don't know how it is,&#xD;
but my heart has become unimpressible."&#xD;
Ile stole a sly but searching look at her&#xD;
face as she said the last words, and said,&#xD;
laughing,-&#xD;
"I believe, if the right man should come&#xD;
along, your stoicism would melt away like&#xD;
snow in the sun."&#xD;
"Quite possible," she answered, coquettish-&#xD;
.y, " but the right man has not come, as yet."&#xD;
What a fool Ernest Montant is making of&#xD;
himself. Those words "not come as yet'" have&#xD;
vexed him as though he had thought he might&#xD;
be the right man.&#xD;
"Mrs. Van Strom," he said, "I must ap-&#xD;
pear very impertinent. Tell me, is it really a&#xD;
fact that you have not been in love since your&#xD;
widowhood, or are you politely telling me that&#xD;
the atairs of your heart are no business of&#xD;
mine,- and that you have no intention of mak-&#xD;
ing a confidant of an entire stranger ?"&#xD;
" What I have told you is true," she an-&#xD;
swered. "I Ihave been free from even a pass-&#xD;
ing fancy for any one, and for that matter-"&#xD;
"Well, for that matter ?"&#xD;
" I do not know why I should thus confide&#xD;
in you. Do you believe that some natuires are&#xD;
wrought in shapes of sympathy with each&#xD;
other so that when they meet there is a sort&#xD;

of instinctive freemasonry established at once&#xD;
-a confidence which is from God ?"&#xD;
" Indeed I do," he replied earnestly. " Have&#xD;
you read Goethe's Wahlverwandtschaften ?"&#xD;
"Yes, that is, a translation of it, for my&#xD;
acquaintance with German is limited. I think&#xD;
the English title, ' Elective Affinities,' does not&#xD;
quite express the meaning; but the novel is&#xD;
superb, and I have pondered over it often.&#xD;
Well, then," she continued, "I think that our&#xD;
meeting has proved the truth of Goethe's be-&#xD;
lief, that the mysterious affinity between hu-&#xD;
man natures will have its way in spite of con-&#xD;
ventionality and the natural distrust of new&#xD;
acquaintances."&#xD;
"And upon that theory, which I joyfully,&#xD;
thankfully accept," said he, "you base the de-&#xD;
sire of telling me-what ?"&#xD;
" I was going to tell you that I have only lov-&#xD;
ed once, in my whole life, and that was a school-&#xD;
girl's whim, which fortunately resulted in-&#xD;
nothing."&#xD;
"And your husband ?" 'he asked, almost&#xD;
appalled by the manner in which this lovely,&#xD;
guileless woman was opening her secret heart.&#xD;
"I never loved him," said Josephine, so&#xD;
softly that the manner in which it was utter-&#xD;
ed, almost hid the awful significance of the&#xD;
speech: "I never loved him."&#xD;
Ho remained silent.&#xD;
" Do you see those waves, swelling and&#xD;
surging, and beating against this rock? They&#xD;
have probably bathed it, embraced it, .and&#xD;
rested by its side for centuries ; but there is&#xD;
no love in their contiguity, their natures are&#xD;
different, there is no affinity between them,&#xD;
and though the rock may sink into the sea, or,&#xD;
the sea rise up and cover the rock from view,&#xD;
they will be enemies forever.  Though the&#xD;
rock may conceal a handful of water in a&#xD;
crevice, though the water may wash away&#xD;
particles of the stone, the stone will return to&#xD;
stone again, and the water to water, at the&#xD;
first opportunity. They never may unite.&#xD;
Such has been my married life."&#xD;
"And yet," continued the widow, dream-&#xD;
ily, " I think I know what love is, though&#xD;
it has not fallen to my lot, as yet. I am sure&#xD;
that I could be so enwrapped in love that my&#xD;
individual existence would be entirely lost&#xD;
sight of. It may be that my guardian angel&#xD;
has kept me from this danger, knowing that&#xD;
it might destroy me."&#xD;
With these words she arose'; something, it&#xD;
might have been that guardian angel, told her&#xD;
that she was going too far. le followed her,&#xD;
respectful and self-possessed.&#xD;
By a mutual impulse they took a silent fare-&#xD;
well of the spot where Josephine's husband&#xD;
had first plead his cause so successfully, and&#xD;
where she had this day formed a new friend-&#xD;
ship, and, perhaps,-but who can tell?&#xD;
Mrs. Josephine Van Strom has been placed&#xD;
before the reader, in a very peculiar position,&#xD;
and one which might lead to a hasty decision&#xD;
that she was a very weak and silly woman,&#xD;
yet h  -unrestrained, impulsive, and, may be,&#xD;
unwise   k king, arose from no weakness, no&#xD;
sill iess, no levity, or lack of modesty. She&#xD;
had tasted too deeply of the fountain of disap-&#xD;
Doinltment to be easily lead to unveil her heart,&#xD;
&#xD;
but when the outside covering of reserve was-&#xD;
once cast aside from her, the warmth of her&#xD;
nature gushed over all bounds of worldly-wise&#xD;
caution. Yet so correct is the intuition of&#xD;
such passionate hearts, that it preserved her&#xD;
from misplacing confidence, and the extraor-&#xD;
dinary intimacy sprung up between themas just&#xD;
narrated, astonished her thoroughly, as she&#xD;
thought it over. Still, her heart had dictated&#xD;
it; her heart, in spite of reason, approved it,&#xD;
and her heart, that sole authority in a woman's&#xD;
breast, was full of the image of Ernest Montant,&#xD;
with his earnest face and musical voice.&#xD;
They walked together over the meadows&#xD;
toward the house, with its massive pillars and&#xD;
stately air, arm-in-arm, and conversing on the&#xD;
topics of the day. They lingered, and their&#xD;
footsteps dragged as they approached the&#xD;
door where they must part.&#xD;
" When car I see you again ?" he asked,&#xD;
eagerly.&#xD;
"When you wish. It will give me great&#xD;
pleasure to see you soon."&#xD;
" And should this house be sold, Mrs. Van&#xD;
Strom'?"&#xD;
"Then I shall move into a quiet cottage,&#xD;
somewhere in New England. I like the&#xD;
country and the people there, and have many&#xD;
friends among them. You know my father,&#xD;
Gen. McLane, although a Southerner, married&#xD;
a Boston lady, and lived in Boston after going&#xD;
on the retired list. Besides, I think I can&#xD;
make a cheap arrangement, and yet live respec-&#xD;
tably, near that city; and I assure you that&#xD;
money is a great consideration with me."&#xD;
Ernest Montant'sthoughts instantly went&#xD;
out toward this lady's needs. "So young, so&#xD;
beautiful, and so poor," he thought, "how I&#xD;
wish I could do something for her."&#xD;
"How can I make an excuse to come here ?"&#xD;
he said, dolefully. " Mr. Van Strom would&#xD;
certainly never invite me."&#xD;
" And I can not; so here it can not be, unless&#xD;
some business matters between Mr. Going and&#xD;
my father-in-law should require a messenger,"&#xD;
she said, slily.&#xD;
" Oh ! the ingenuity of woman," cried our&#xD;
hero, laughing. "I can easily arrange that,&#xD;
even though the business were only of suffi-&#xD;
cient importance to save my dignity as em--&#xD;
bassador. I know Walter Going so intimately,&#xD;
that I am sure of a satisfactory result there.&#xD;
But; suppose you should be away when I&#xD;
come," he suggested.&#xD;
" Well, perhaps you had better send me&#xD;
word,-a card or note."&#xD;
"And suppose you could not stay at home&#xD;
on the day that I appoint, or should be indis-&#xD;
posed. You know that I could not come here on&#xD;
business very often. Will you answer my note ?"&#xD;
"Well-as it seems necessary-yes."&#xD;
He took her hand and kissed it. She left it&#xD;
in his listlessly for a moment, and looked at&#xD;
him tenderly, with her glorious eyes. It was&#xD;
a dangerous moment. She broke the spell by&#xD;
giving him a slight tap on his cheek.&#xD;
" After all," she said, "you are only a boy."&#xD;
And yet Josephine Van Strom was not a&#xD;
coquette. Never in her previous experience&#xD;
.had she permitted a flirtation like this, amid&#xD;
certainly this sudden attack seems rather&#xD;
&#xD;
severe. So, at least, thought our hero, as he&#xD;
turned the matter over in his mind afterward;&#xD;
and he even reproached himself severely for&#xD;
having carried matters so far. So chivalric&#xD;
and high-minded was he, that he never&#xD;
thought of attributing part of the blame to&#xD;
her; but accused himself of having perhaps&#xD;
convinced her that he had fallen desperately&#xD;
in love with her, which, as he assured him-&#xD;
self, was a mistaken impression.&#xD;
He had been many times enraptured with&#xD;
Jessie Going ; we have seen him fascinated&#xD;
by Josephine Van Strom; but he loved&#xD;
neither the one nor the other.&#xD;
Mr. Van Strom, with his guests, were now&#xD;
coming over the lawn, still in earnest conver-&#xD;
sation, and the first words we overhear are&#xD;
from the old gentleman.&#xD;
" Well, Mr. Going, in a week from to-day I&#xD;
will give you a definite answer whether I will&#xD;
sell the Priory, or not. Mark you, two&#xD;
hundred and twenty-five thousand dollars is&#xD;
the price, two-thirds to remain on bond and&#xD;
mortgage, five thousand cash on the day of&#xD;
sale, when we sign the papers, and the bal-&#xD;
ance after the title is searched out, and the&#xD;
deed is delivered into your hands.&#xD;
"Exactly so," replied Mr. Going; " and now&#xD;
we must ask for our carriage, to return, for it&#xD;
is five o'clock."&#xD;
So the horses came up with a great deal of&#xD;
unnecessary stamping, and rearing, and neigh-&#xD;
ing, and snorting, and after the usual amount&#xD;
of hand-shaking had been done, and Mr.&#xD;
Going had almost affectionately bidden Jose-&#xD;
phine good-bye, and after that lady's soft little&#xD;
fingers had given our hero's hand a little soft&#xD;
squeeze, which he did not forget'immediately,&#xD;
there cane a crack of the whip, a general&#xD;
farewell, and away they went, all too soon outo&#xD;
of the widow's sight, who stood watching&#xD;
them to the last. And when the rattle of the&#xD;
wheels had died away, she felt that the load&#xD;
she had carried so long, though lifted off for&#xD;
one bright afternoon, had fallen back upon her&#xD;
heart, heavier than ever.&#xD;
She sank into one of the chairs on the front&#xD;
piazza, and wondered why the gentle breezes,&#xD;
coming freshly from the hills of Westchester&#xD;
County, did not waft to her listening ear even&#xD;
an echo of those noisy wheels, which had&#xD;
seemed to fairly fly away from her-perhaps&#xD;
forever.&#xD;
Before her lay the flower-beds surrounding&#xD;
the house, and yonder was the lawn falling&#xD;
away in gradual slopes. As she looked atten-&#xD;
tively at the little flowers and grasses, it&#xD;
seemed to her dreamy imagination, that they&#xD;
were crowding and jostling each other in&#xD;
dwarfish disturbance, trying to get a last&#xD;
look at the fast dying sun in the West. At&#xD;
the foot of the lawn, the grand group of dark&#xD;
and silent trees, tinged by the sun, wore gold-&#xD;
en-crowns and the hills and rocks were light-&#xD;
ed up by his last rays with an infinity of colors.&#xD;
What a study for the painter. The hovering&#xD;
shadows rolling over the green hillsides, the&#xD;
granite rocks shining now in silver, now&#xD;
19&#xD;
&#xD;
fading  away  to  blue, now    to  violet;&#xD;
the gray-blue clouds towering in massive&#xD;
shapes, while the little white ones clustered&#xD;
around like effigies of cherubim upon a back-&#xD;
ground of endless blue, shaded by the last&#xD;
rays of the sun to gold, as though the fields&#xD;
of heaven lay there, according to the teach-&#xD;
ings of our childhood.&#xD;
Josephine Van Strom watched the scenery&#xD;
till her eyes moistened and the little tears&#xD;
stole out to catch the sunbeams like the flow-&#xD;
ers at her feet. Her heart throbbed and her&#xD;
face glowed as if a meteor had arisen on the&#xD;
horizon of her soul, while the sun was sinking&#xD;
yonder. Was it so? Had the morning dawned&#xD;
upon her which brings to woman new light,&#xD;
new life?&#xD;
She laid her hands on her throbbing breast:&#xD;
had the stranger only stimulated a fleeting&#xD;
fancy, or had she already, in one of those&#xD;
moments upon which hangs a lifetime, set her&#xD;
heart upon his image, clutching it firmly to&#xD;
have and to hold till death should part them?&#xD;
As yet there is but a zephyr astir in her heart,&#xD;
as in the air around her rippling the water&#xD;
but gently and only rustling softly the leaves&#xD;
of the trees ; but, it may soon increase to a&#xD;
gale and arouse the horrors of the tempest. It&#xD;
may grudge the moon to the patient earth this&#xD;
very night, it may hang this beautiful world&#xD;
now spread before her admiring gaze, in cheer-&#xD;
less mourning, and sleep may be banished from&#xD;
your couch before you thiik it possible-poor&#xD;
Josephine.&#xD;
Already the breeze becomes stronger, and&#xD;
now that'the sun has fairly set, it brings with&#xD;
it a warning chill. A change comes over the&#xD;
scene ; but, what is that streak of pale gold&#xD;
glinting through the trees? It spreads .its&#xD;
luster and expands like magic over the lawn,&#xD;
it trembles from leaf to leaf, from flower to&#xD;
flower, and-coats the dark trees with silver, it&#xD;
lies on the roads, runs along the fences; light-&#xD;
ens the whole country in an instant, it flashes&#xD;
up the water and glitters greeting from the&#xD;
distant hills-it is the new moon.&#xD;
" Welcome, oh star of love!" said Josephine,&#xD;
from the depth of her passionate soul. " Light&#xD;
up his pathway wherever he goes ; shine into&#xD;
his heart and bring him tidings of what you&#xD;
have read in mine own, for-God help me-&#xD;
I love him I"&#xD;
&#xD;
*      *     *&#xD;
&#xD;
*&#xD;
&#xD;
And, meanwhile, the four bays were scam-&#xD;
pering along the ioad and stamping through&#xD;
Central Park, and rattling over the pavements&#xD;
to the house where Jessie Going awaited the&#xD;
compamty to a late- dinner. Ernest Montant&#xD;
did not speak a word during the whole ride,&#xD;
but sat biting his lips and comparing Jessie&#xD;
Going and Mrs. Josephine Van Strom, repeat-&#xD;
ing to himself again and again, that, since he&#xD;
did not love both (of that he was quite cer-&#xD;
tain), and was unable to decide upon a prefer-&#xD;
rence, he therefore loved neither of them,&#xD;
which conclusion invariably proved very pro-&#xD;
vokingly unsatisfactory.&#xD;

CHAPTER VI.&#xD;
HOW JOHN JACOB VAN STROM, JR., GOT MAR-&#xD;
RIED.&#xD;
" If thou wilt needs marry, marry a fool."&#xD;
HAMLET.&#xD;
JOHN JACoBVAN STROM, Junior, was, as we&#xD;
have seen, the happy proprietor of a yellow&#xD;
mare. Her poetical name was "Bella." She&#xD;
was not quite sound in body ; but, in the&#xD;
language of her owner, "she knew as much as&#xD;
any human being," which might have been&#xD;
correct had John considered his own mental&#xD;
caliber as the standard.&#xD;
Like most of her gender she was born with&#xD;
a strong will, and had never quietly submitted&#xD;
to the humiliation of having her mouth pulled&#xD;
to the right or left by the degrading machinery&#xD;
called reins and bit. She only tolerated a&#xD;
bridle upon the condition that it should be&#xD;
strictly considered as a head ornament, and&#xD;
she alone decided upon the road to be traveled&#xD;
upon, the speed adopted, and upon the proper&#xD;
moment and place to turn her yellow nose&#xD;
homeward for dinner. John's greatest amuse-&#xD;
ment was to harness this strong-minded&#xD;
female, sit lazily in his rickety wagon, and&#xD;
leave it to her superior judgment to decide&#xD;
upon a pleasant excursion for the day. Enter-&#xD;
taining himself then by conversing with the&#xD;
mare, he was dragged along as resistlessly as&#xD;
a child in a baby-wagon, and great was his&#xD;
delight whenever his motor made an unex-&#xD;
pected turn and varied the more familiar&#xD;
drives, by attempting short cuts through the&#xD;
woods or other unfrequented places. It must&#xD;
not, however, be omitted that when " Bella"&#xD;
came jogging back through the park, John&#xD;
made a pretense of handling the reins in fine&#xD;
style, and when she considerately stopped for&#xD;
him to alight, he always cried " whoa " very&#xD;
imperiously, just as other folks with more&#xD;
sense are apt to do, when wishing to hide&#xD;
their incapacity before a criticizing world.&#xD;
On -a fine afternoon, not many days after&#xD;
the events chronicled in the last chapter, John&#xD;
and Bella were peacefully traveling along the&#xD;
high road, when suddenly the mare shook her&#xD;
head, gave a saucy little kick at the traces,&#xD;
and stood still.&#xD;
Hallo !" said John to himself, "there is a&#xD;
reason for this; she never stops unless some-&#xD;
thing is in the wind. I shall wait and see."&#xD;
It so happened that close by the road there&#xD;
stood a rustic tailor's shop; but John took no&#xD;
notice of his surroundings, being too busily&#xD;
engaged watching the mare with intense ex-&#xD;
pectation of a denouement. There he sat, the&#xD;
reins thrown over Bella's back, curved like a&#xD;
cat on a grindstone, his thin, smooth chin, and&#xD;
protruding jaws resting on his bony hands,&#xD;
his sharp elbows braced upon his angular&#xD;
knees, his attenuated legs drawn up under&#xD;
him, and his low, narrow forehead wrinkled&#xD;
in wonder, for he was thoroughly convinced&#xD;
that something remarkable was certain to&#xD;
happen soon; when the door of the shop&#xD;
opened and out stepped the tailor's daughter,&#xD;
tolerably good-looking, robust, sprighmtly, neat,&#xD;
and clever&#xD;
&#xD;
"Good morning, ma'am," said John, touch.&#xD;
ing his hat.&#xD;
"Good morning, Mr. Van Strom."&#xD;
"Eh ! you know    my name?     What is&#xD;
yours ?"&#xD;
"They call me Bella."&#xD;
" The devil," cried he, " and don't you&#xD;
know, my pretty girl, that I call my mare,&#xD;
this mare, Bella, too."&#xD;
"You surprise me, sir," she said, amused.&#xD;
" And as your name is Bella, and the mare's&#xD;
name is Bella, too, you must take a ride with&#xD;
me. Don't object, jump in just as you are,&#xD;
right off. I tell you, a Van Strom don't wait&#xD;
for any one."   -&#xD;
" I'll ask father," she commenced.&#xD;
"Ask fiddlesticks !" he interrupted, angrily.&#xD;
" Come this instant. The mare might start&#xD;
if you don't hurry." he added, under his&#xD;
breath, with a troubled glance at that animal,&#xD;
who certainly seemed to have awakened from&#xD;
her recent nap.&#xD;
Bella had but little desire to avoid the frolic&#xD;
offered her, and when he answered her sug-&#xD;
gestion of the propriety of dressing up by an&#xD;
impatient "Now or never," she jumped up&#xD;
alongside him with an alacrity that threatened&#xD;
to dislocate the springs, and the old mare,&#xD;
seeing her namesake finally bagged, started&#xD;
with a jerk that threw the still unseated fair&#xD;
one upon the willing support of John's ex-&#xD;
tended arm.&#xD;
The laborers in the field stopped their work&#xD;
to see the strange couple. Stragglers and&#xD;
country folk whom they met, laughed and&#xD;
passed impertinent jokes in a half-audible&#xD;
tone as they passed; but "lie laughs best&#xD;
who laughs last," and, before half an hour&#xD;
Bella, the tailor's daughter, had the best of&#xD;
the joke, for the sole heir of the wealthiest&#xD;
man in the county had made her a declara-&#xD;
tion of love.&#xD;
Without waiting for an answer he took her&#xD;
to his " throbbing heart," thus saving her a&#xD;
world of remonstrance, gradual yielding,&#xD;
blushing, and all other fine effects of pro-&#xD;
priety used by maids in such cases--all of&#xD;
which could so advantageously be dispensed&#xD;
with, according to John's example.&#xD;
" Bella, you don't speak, you don't answer,"&#xD;
he cried, agitated by his rapidly changing&#xD;
whims. " But let us leave the answer to your&#xD;
noble namesake! Look there, my darling, see&#xD;
yonder is the cross-road!1 My mare was never&#xD;
guided by a strip of leather since I had her.&#xD;
Now, if she turns to the right, we will be&#xD;
married at once, within the hour. If she&#xD;
turns to the left, we are parted forever 1n -&#xD;
Bella agreed to this arrangement by which&#xD;
the whim of an animal was to decide her des-&#xD;
tiny; but, as they neared the spot, she deter.&#xD;
mined upon trying a plan of her own to secure&#xD;
the fortunes of the day. It was very deceit-&#xD;
ful, doubtless very wicked; but did not the&#xD;
prize at stake warrant the action, and was she&#xD;
not a woman ? Blinding John with caresses,&#xD;
she softly put out her hand toward the reins&#xD;
and grasping one, gave one little but decided&#xD;
pull to the right ; hlt all I there she missed&#xD;
it. The mare, totally unaccustomed to siuch&#xD;
liberties, stood still with amazement; then in-&#xD;
&#xD;
dignation filled her soul, and, with a snake of&#xD;
her head and a defiant whisk of her tail, with&#xD;
true feminine contrariness, she wheeled to the&#xD;
--left, and jogged-on leisurely in that direction.&#xD;
Ha, Bella, woman !" .cried John, in great&#xD;
excitement, " would you try to deceive me ?&#xD;
Its foul-didn't I see you pull that left line?&#xD;
Its awfully mean, I say. Oh, ye women, ye&#xD;
women!"&#xD;
Delighted at his mistake. Bella proposed to&#xD;
try another experiment. But it proved not so&#xD;
easy to suit John's whim. He suggested that&#xD;
the next trial should be the first fowl that&#xD;
crossed the road. If it should prove a rooster&#xD;
-but she stopped him right there, and some-&#xD;
thir else had to be thought of.&#xD;
While he sat musing, almost in despair, her&#xD;
quick eye saw a team approaching in the dis-&#xD;
tance. " I have it," she cried, instantly. " If&#xD;
the first team we meet is a double one, two&#xD;
horses, you know, I will consent to-never&#xD;
mind what, L oily one horse, farewell happi.&#xD;
ness!"&#xD;
Agreed.   The team    approaches, nearer,&#xD;
nearer -two horses, of course, as Bella&#xD;
thought, but when she prepared for a final&#xD;
embrace, she was startled by the look of utter&#xD;
misery which overspread his countenance.&#xD;
"Bella," he sighed, "it's all over. It is of&#xD;
no use tempting the fates any more, so let us&#xD;
be resigned!"&#xD;
"Oh, wretched tailor's daughter ! Oh, dis-&#xD;
consolate Bella!"&#xD;
"What can be the matter now ?" she gasped.&#xD;
" Oh, darling of my heart," he cried, mourn-&#xD;
fully, "that team, that team."&#xD;
" Well, those two horses- "&#xD;
" There were not two horses. Oh, my dear,&#xD;
my sweet, my-there was but one horse ! The&#xD;
other was a mule!"&#xD;
For a moment the temptation to laugh out-&#xD;
right at the intensely comical expression of his&#xD;
face nearly overcame her, then her good sense&#xD;
prompted her to end the farce at once, but she&#xD;
acted differently. Like a good general, who&#xD;
keeps his presence of mind on a battle-field&#xD;
half lost, and knows how to turn the scale to&#xD;
victory at an opportune moment, she was equal&#xD;
to the emergency and sent her tears, -as light&#xD;
troops, in advance, to gain time.&#xD;
" Oh! you bad man," she sobbed, "you, to&#xD;
talk of love. Oh, you deceiving, two-faced,&#xD;
deep-plotting, scandalous wretch-Oh, you&#xD;
heartless, mean, low, false, unprincipled-oh !&#xD;
oh ! oh !" (Strong symptoms of hysterics.)&#xD;
" Thus to treat me (gasps and sobs), thus to-&#xD;
trifle with ale-such merciless tor-rr-ture from&#xD;
one I loved so well !"  Here came a perfect&#xD;
cataract of tears. -&#xD;
"Don't cry, Bella," he blubbered, in implor-&#xD;
ing tones. "It is not my fault. Have I cre-&#xD;
ated that cursed mule ?  Can I help it that&#xD;
his father was an ass?"&#xD;
"lHe was not," she cried, vehemently, "the&#xD;
thing's father was a horse!"&#xD;
"But his mother was an ass !" he suggest-&#xD;
ed, mildly.&#xD;
"I tell you, John, the animal is a horse. I&#xD;
know his father is a horse!1 Ask old Ben&#xD;
Smith, who owns him; he lives next deer to&#xD;
us, and I k-n-o-w it is a horse, a sweet, little,&#xD;

_      '&#xD;
i    i&#xD;
&#xD;
black horse, with a star in its forehead, right&#xD;
here !" and she pointed at her own forehead,&#xD;
to prove this an accurate description of the&#xD;
sweet, black, little horse.&#xD;
" I admit that, darling, I admit that, but&#xD;
that does not prove him a horse. For his&#xD;
mother must have been-must, you know-"&#xD;
"If your mother," she interrupted, hope-&#xD;
fully, "if your mother was Miss Jones, and&#xD;
your father Mr. Van Strom, what are you?&#xD;
Answer me thatI"&#xD;
"My name is Van Strom," he conceded,&#xD;
puzzled.&#xD;
" Then that beast is a horse," she cried, tri-&#xD;
umphantly (" and you are the ass," she added,&#xD;
good-humoredly, to herself).&#xD;
So, proving her superior knowledge to his&#xD;
utter discomfiture, she took advantage of his&#xD;
amazement and addressed herself to his affee-&#xD;
tions, for he really seemed to love her, and&#xD;
finally he gave up the point.&#xD;
The mare proved to be an inconsidered,&#xD;
though not inconsiderable, ally, and just then&#xD;
helped matters amazingly by coming to a&#xD;
standstill just in front of a little country&#xD;
meeting-house on the road-side.&#xD;
" When she decides, it is all right." said&#xD;
John, with a sigh of relief; and they alighted&#xD;
without hesitation on finding the door open, to&#xD;
be married on the spot. They found the min-&#xD;
ister inside, engaged in patching up a broken&#xD;
window with an old newspaper, so before&#xD;
long they wore standing before him, in front&#xD;
of the great pulpit.&#xD;
While the parson was going through the&#xD;
ceremony with great pleasure,- for lie knew&#xD;
both parties, and was very fond of Bella, John&#xD;
began to grow absent-ibinded and restless.&#xD;
le wiped the cold perspiration from his brow;&#xD;
he looked around with a vacant stare, as if in&#xD;
great perplexity; he shifted- nervously from&#xD;
one foot to the other ; and finally turned very&#xD;
pale, when he was asked if he would " tako&#xD;
this woman to be," &amp;amp;c., and bellowing a&#xD;
frantic " No " before the question was finished,&#xD;
he suddenly turned away, with a distorting&#xD;
convulsion of his lean body, bolted out of the&#xD;
church at the top of his speed, and made for&#xD;
his wagon as if for his life.&#xD;
A word from Bella kept the minister at his&#xD;
post, and she went after her escaping fortune,&#xD;
running faster than he ; but laughing in spite&#xD;
of herself.&#xD;
" Go along, get up I" John shouted to the&#xD;
mare ; but she shook her head, laid one ear&#xD;
back, and turning her head slowly around,&#xD;
looked at her master, with a sort of grin, as&#xD;
one who would. say, "I am acting for your&#xD;
good, though you don't seem to appreciate it."&#xD;
John gave it up, and was -sitting in his seat,&#xD;
a picture of misery, when Bella reached him.&#xD;
After much parley the truth came out.&#xD;
"Bella," he confessed, "a Van Strom can&#xD;
not act against his conscience: and as I stood&#xD;
before the .parson with you, there came into&#xD;
my mind, destroying all my happiness, fresh&#xD;
reasons why a mule is not a horse. After all,&#xD;
you see-"&#xD;
She thought of an old remedy, and inter-&#xD;
rupted his logic with the representation that&#xD;
in order to redeem her character, he must go&#xD;

i&#xD;
&#xD;
back and say "yes " the next time, and allow&#xD;
her to refuse him. As John acknowledged&#xD;
that it was the lady's place to refuse a gentle-&#xD;
man, he agreed to return ; but he could hardly&#xD;
believe his ears, when, after he had said "I&#xD;
will," according to agreement, she also said " I&#xD;
will. He started back, and looked at her with&#xD;
mouth and eyes wide open. It was a critical&#xD;
moment. She smiled upon him such a winning&#xD;
smile, that he laughed, embraced her heartily,&#xD;
and went through the rest of-the service like&#xD;
a lamb.&#xD;
So, they say, John Jacob Van Strom, Junior,&#xD;
was married mal grd lui, as the French have&#xD;
it; and although he was very happy when the&#xD;
trouble was all over, he little thought that&#xD;
that was the most sensible action of his whole&#xD;
life.&#xD;
With his usual pertinacity, he insisted upon&#xD;
taking her immediately to the Priory ; she&#xD;
objected, he proved his authority as her hus-&#xD;
band. As they went through the Park the&#xD;
old trees frowned on the intruder, and as they&#xD;
approached the stately house, which was now&#xD;
to be her -home, her courage failed her. At&#xD;
last she realized what she had done, and what&#xD;
serious results might accrue. She felt that&#xD;
the crazy doings of a crazy gentleman might&#xD;
involve a poor tailor's daughter in disgrace and&#xD;
misery. True, she held her marriage certificate&#xD;
tightly in her hand ; but she feared lest her&#xD;
comedy should turn to tragedy, and her farce&#xD;
change to a curse to both of them. The feverish&#xD;
energy of her spouse had brought her to, the&#xD;
door of the house, and she plucked up courage&#xD;
to enter, resolving to crown her coup with&#xD;
complete success or know the worst.&#xD;
And when, before old Mr. Van Strom, the&#xD;
crazy son told the crazy father the crazy&#xD;
news, her pride upheld her, by the self-con-&#xD;
sciousness that she was the only rational&#xD;
creature of the three.&#xD;
And old Mr. Van Strom did what some&#xD;
highly intelligent old gentlemen would not&#xD;
have been sufficiently intelligent 'to do ; he&#xD;
gave his consent and blessing, instead of try-&#xD;
ing to undo what could not be undone, or&#xD;
making worse what could not be mended,&#xD;
thereby saving himself a deal of trouble,&#xD;
expense, vexation, and perhaps ultimate re-&#xD;
morse, and so making two others very happy&#xD;
instead of miserable. He embraced his new&#xD;
daughter-in-law, and John capered about the&#xD;
room in an ecstasy of delight at his father's&#xD;
kindness, for he had rather feared the old&#xD;
gentleman might object. The servants were&#xD;
called in, and the news announced to them ;&#xD;
the butler looked blank, and the cook made a&#xD;
face ; but they all bowed and courtesied to the&#xD;
new mistress, who looked resolved to stand&#xD;
her ground, and not quite so credulous as&#xD;
certain simple-minded folk who had attempted&#xD;
to rule them heretofore.&#xD;
"1I think," she soliloquized the next morn-&#xD;
ing, while dressing in a room which seemed a&#xD;
palace to her untutored eyes, "I think I see&#xD;
my duty here pretty plainly. My poor hus-&#xD;
eand loves me truly, beyond a doubt, and he&#xD;
will love me always if I choose. To him I&#xD;
owe this sudden change of fortune, and I will&#xD;
repay him by watching his interests, and&#xD;
&#xD;
caring for him who needs it so much. Yes !&#xD;
he shall find a prop and a comfort in his wife,&#xD;
so long as I retain my sound sense and hon-&#xD;
esty of purpose."&#xD;
And where was Josephine Van Strom?&#xD;
Her maid informed her of the news, and her&#xD;
description of John's wife was not sufficiently&#xD;
flattering to cause lively joy to the widow.&#xD;
She was at first indignant, then inclined to&#xD;
weep and lament ; but soon became resigned,&#xD;
and simply shrugged her beautiful shoulders.&#xD;
" Here's  news, Mrs. Van Strom," Jane&#xD;
had cried, rushing in without her usual knock,&#xD;
for Jane was a well-behaved girl.&#xD;
" What in the world has happened ?" asked&#xD;
Josephine, with some alarm, on beholding&#xD;
Jane's excitement.&#xD;
"Mr. John has been and gone and done&#xD;
it 1"&#xD;
"Done what? Speak sensibly, Jane," said&#xD;
the widow, expecting to hear of some mnfor-&#xD;
tunate relapse in John's mental condition.&#xD;
Had he committed murder, arson, or suicide?&#xD;
" ie's been down in the village, mum, and&#xD;
carted off Bell, the darter of Smith, the tail-&#xD;
or, and's married her right straight off, and&#xD;
brought her home, and she be down below&#xD;
now, mum, a-huggin' and a-kissin', and the&#xD;
divil to pay, savin' your presence, mumn, her&#xD;
and Mister John and the old gintleman, so&#xD;
ye'd think they'd all three gone stark mad and&#xD;
no mistake this time."&#xD;
Which classic recital had the effect. of&#xD;
keeping Mrs. Van Strom in her room until the&#xD;
next morning. " Nobody sends for me," she&#xD;
sighed to herself. "I am not thought worthy&#xD;
to receive even a wanton hussy, in this&#xD;
house."&#xD;
She determined to leave the house imme-&#xD;
diately, and gave the necessary orders to&#xD;
Jane and the coachman, both of whom, and&#xD;
in fact all the servants, were devoted to her,&#xD;
although they fooled, cheated, plundered, and&#xD;
at times even insulted Mr. Van Strom and&#xD;
John Jacob, Junior.&#xD;
She dressed herself carefully and very&#xD;
tastefully before leaving her room, and her&#xD;
mirror gave her courage as it told her how&#xD;
charming she was. Her curiosity led her to seek&#xD;
the nouvelle arrive before taking her leave, so&#xD;
she entered the drawing-room softly, and, on&#xD;
discovering a female figure at the other end&#xD;
of the room, retired, unobserved, into a bow-&#xD;
window.&#xD;
"Is this my sister-in-law," she wondered.&#xD;
"Is this the tailor's daughter turned lady in&#xD;
two hours? Why she is actually at work.&#xD;
This at least speaks well for her,  Some&#xD;
women in her circumstances would at once&#xD;
play the great lady, but here she is dusting&#xD;
and arranging the furniture.  And she is&#xD;
neither awkward nor homely. Her figure is&#xD;
comely'and her face seems pleasing, though&#xD;
not handsome.   I know  some ladies who&#xD;
would give a great deal for that complexion&#xD;
and those round arms."&#xD;
At this moment, the butler, whom Bella&#xD;
had summoned, entered the room without&#xD;
knoeking at the door, and showing defiance&#xD;
in his bearing, rather than deference or respect.&#xD;
"James," said his new mistress. turning&#xD;
&#xD;
upon him authoritatively, "how long does it fc&#xD;
take you to answer the bell?"             t&#xD;
" Well, ma'am, the cook axed me to-."&#xD;
"I want you to understand, James," said v&#xD;
Mrs. John Van Strom, "that hereafter, the o&#xD;
servant who is wanting in respect or atten- l&#xD;
tion, will be dismissed at once. Do you S&#xD;
hear ?"                                   t&#xD;
"I have been in the family, ma'am," com- p&#xD;
menced the old rascal, whining-&#xD;
"I don't care how long you have been in f&#xD;
the family," she interrupted, in the same-&#xD;
calm, decisive tone, "but I warn you, that,p&#xD;
although I can appreciate an old servant, and i&#xD;
will do every thing reasonable to render him&#xD;
comfortable, he must do his duty, or walk off.Y&#xD;
Now go, I don't need you here, for I haveJ&#xD;
done the work myself."&#xD;
The servant peered keenly into her face for"&#xD;
a moment, finding there nothing but decision&#xD;
and calm consciousness of power, so he made 1&#xD;
his exit quite humbly.I&#xD;
Josephine, in her corner, opened her eyes&#xD;
at the dignity of this new matron, and could&#xD;
but acknowledge that the butler had wellI&#xD;
deserved all he got, so she silently compli-&#xD;
mented Bella, and emerged from her hiding&#xD;
place.&#xD;
Mrs. John started a little on perceiving her;4&#xD;
but as her nerves were not yet fashionably&#xD;
unstrung, the neither shrieked nor trembled&#xD;
at the sudden apparition, but said, with a mod-&#xD;
esty of tone, which pleasantly contrasted with&#xD;
her manner toward James--&#xD;
" Excuse me, madam, I did not know you&#xD;
were here; may I ask whom I have the honor&#xD;
to address ?"&#xD;
" My name is Josephine Van Strom," an-&#xD;
swered the widow. " I am the widow of your&#xD;
husband's brother."&#xD;
My sister-in-law." was on Bella's tongue&#xD;
but she shrank back timidly when she saw no&#xD;
encouragement in Josephine's unmoved'face&#xD;
and distant manner. After an instant of&#xD;
hesitation, she again approached and shyly&#xD;
held out her hand.&#xD;
Josephine's warm heart smote her because&#xD;
of her impoliteness, and she took the offered&#xD;
hand cordially, drew Bella close to her, and&#xD;
with the words, "Yes, my dear, your sister,&#xD;
Josephine," kissed her on both cheeks.&#xD;
As John had accompanied his father on&#xD;
some errand, the two were left to themselves,&#xD;
and soon after their first meeting they were&#xD;
sitting in Josephine's room, Bella on a low&#xD;
stool at the other's feet, her hands clasped in&#xD;
her lap, and looking up into Josephine's face&#xD;
with admiration and tenderness.&#xD;
" How beautiful you are, sister Josephine,"&#xD;
said the tailor's daughter, artlessly, and how&#xD;
strange it is that the gentlemen have not made&#xD;
you a pet, a dear mistress, a-sort of goddess.&#xD;
I can hardly believe it, though you have just&#xD;
told me so."&#xD;
" And yet it is so, my dear," she answered,&#xD;
with a sad smile, " and for that reason, I am&#xD;
determined to leave the house to-day."&#xD;
"No! nol no!"&#xD;
" I must! Although I feel that I could love&#xD;
you dearly and tenderly, my pride has been&#xD;
too deeply wounded in this house to remain&#xD;
&#xD;
20&#xD;
&#xD;
or your sake alone, for I have pride, Bella,&#xD;
hough it may be wrong."&#xD;
" It is not wrong in you, it would be very,&#xD;
'ery wrong in me ! Do you know that I ani half&#xD;
ut of my mind? Such a change! A care-&#xD;
ess, poor girl yesterday, and to-day, Mrs. Van&#xD;
Strom. Why, we children were brought up&#xD;
o regard this house as a fairy castle, a royal&#xD;
palace, every thing that was grand and beyond&#xD;
ur sphere. Can't you imagine, then, that I&#xD;
eel like a thief, like a bold and shameess&#xD;
woman to have usurped this place because my&#xD;
poor husband was sufficiently imbecile to take&#xD;
me?"&#xD;
"You have accomplished the most re-&#xD;
markable feat that I ever heard of," replied&#xD;
Josephine, smiling " but I can not say that&#xD;
what you have done is bad or contemptible.&#xD;
You have fallen in with what some might call&#xD;
miraculous good fortune ; but be warned in&#xD;
time against the harshness and unmerciful&#xD;
prejudice you will meet in this new world,&#xD;
which now seems to you all sunshine. This&#xD;
fne society will cost you many a tear-this&#xD;
high station, many a heart-ache; but trust in&#xD;
God and preserve your self-respect. All will be&#xD;
right, and John may thank heaven for his wife."&#xD;
She kissed her forehead and took her hands&#xD;
caressingly. Bella laid her head on the wid-&#xD;
ow's lap and sobbed bitterly.&#xD;
" Why do you cry, dear ?" asked Josephinc.&#xD;
"I did not mean to frighten you, much less to&#xD;
wound you. Look up and take courage. I&#xD;
repeat that I think John has made a better&#xD;
bargain than you have."&#xD;
"I will be cheerful, and happy, and strong,&#xD;
and any thing else you wish, if you will do me&#xD;
a favor."&#xD;
" And that is-"&#xD;
"Will you promise ?"&#xD;
" I will not deny you, if I can help it,"&#xD;
" Remain here. If not for years, stay for&#xD;
months, or, at any rate, do not speak of leaving&#xD;
at present."&#xD;
" Ask any thing but this, dear Bella."&#xD;
"Just try us for a little while. Iam mis-&#xD;
tress of this house, and my husband and&#xD;
father-in-law shall act like sensible people, I&#xD;
promise you. You are in a strange position;&#xD;
your rights are disregarded; your name, your&#xD;
husband's name is dishonored by the treat-&#xD;
ment you receive; but if you, beautiful and&#xD;
accomplished as you are, can condescend to&#xD;
let poor me manage affairs-if you will be my&#xD;
ally as I shall be yours-we shall be able to&#xD;
maintain our position together against the&#xD;
whims of our relatives, against the attacks of&#xD;
that society you spoke of, and against all other&#xD;
obstacles. You are no stranger, no guest, no&#xD;
mendicant in this house. It belongs to you as&#xD;
much as to my husband, and I repeat that you&#xD;
forget the name which you bear, if you do not&#xD;
assert yourself. On the other hand, what&#xD;
comfort, what help can I find, but in you ? If&#xD;
you are sincere in what you say, you must&#xD;
feel willing to stand by me and to advise me.&#xD;
If I can not coax you, I must appeal to your&#xD;
heart. Can you really pity me or love me,&#xD;
and yet leave me so?&#xD;
IIt was a hard struggle; but Della's common&#xD;
sense and tact won the day. Josephine had&#xD;

never before viewed her position at the Prior&#xD;
in the light presented by the tailor's daughter&#xD;
A gentle, loving, passionate, tender- woman&#xD;
she was born to be cared for by others, an&#xD;
when neglected would retreat timidly, uncom&#xD;
plainingly like a wounded bird to its nest&#xD;
there to mourn and helplessly die. She hat&#xD;
never even thought of asserting herself, a&#xD;
Bella now called upon her to do, and it wa&#xD;
only because the latter's straightforward en&#xD;
ergy gave her hope and strength, that sh(&#xD;
finally consented.&#xD;
"And if the place is sold, Bella ?" she asked&#xD;
after the question was settled.&#xD;
"You shall still remain with us wherever&#xD;
we go," cried Bella. " The fact is, I shal&#xD;
make John's father sell the place. It is too&#xD;
large."&#xD;
"You seem to have great confidence in your&#xD;
powers over Mr. Van Strom."&#xD;
"Yes, I have, though I don't know why,&#xD;
exactly. You will see that the place will 1,o&#xD;
sold before the week is out, provided Mr.&#xD;
Going sticks to his bargain."&#xD;
"You know    about that already," said&#xD;
Josephine, much astonished. " You surprise&#xD;
me !&#xD;
"I am a business woman, dear," answered&#xD;
Bella, laughing, "and, I think, much more&#xD;
competent than two certain gentlemen we&#xD;
know of."&#xD;
At this moment John and his father came&#xD;
in sight, driving toward the house.&#xD;
"Bella," asked Josephine, softly stroking&#xD;
her new sister's hair, "Bellal tell me one thing,&#xD;
we are both women, you know: Do you love&#xD;
your husband?"&#xD;
"So help me God, I love him dutifully as a&#xD;
wife should," answered the wife, solemnly.&#xD;
"Then all will be well."&#xD;
CHAPTER VII.&#xD;
HOBGOBLIN.&#xD;
Kxor alENRY "Ynu have good leave to leave us:&#xD;
when we need&#xD;
Your use and counsel, we shall send for oi,,"&#xD;
KING HENRY IV&#xD;
SEVERAL weeks elapsed before Mr. Van&#xD;
Strom could bring himself to announce to Mr.&#xD;
Going that he had determined to' sell the&#xD;
Priory. Walter fretted mightily at the delay,&#xD;
and favored a second visit to the old man, to&#xD;
compel him to sell at once ; but his father felt&#xD;
grave about buying such a costly place, giv-&#xD;
ing a mortgage on it, and sustaining the in-&#xD;
evitably heavy expenditures of so large an&#xD;
establishment. Report called him  an im-&#xD;
mensely wealthy man, and his credit was un-&#xD;
impeachable; but what his property would&#xD;
amount to, if his business were suddenly&#xD;
closed, must remain as dubious to us, for&#xD;
awhile, as it was to his friends and enemies in&#xD;
the commercial world of New York.&#xD;
"If the Priory comes into my hands with-&#xD;
out any further exertion on my part, w eli and&#xD;
good," he said to Walter ; " if not, we will let&#xD;
&#xD;
29&#xD;
&#xD;
y it go, and I confess, I shall not feel any the&#xD;
r. less secure, for not owning a princely estate,&#xD;
, with a princely mortgage on it."&#xD;
d    In the meanwhile our hero was working&#xD;
- hard and gaining golden opinions. Already&#xD;
, he had proved that his business capacity was&#xD;
d of no common order, and it had been noticed&#xD;
s and even mentioned to Mr. Going by outside&#xD;
s parties. The old gentleman was pleased by&#xD;
- the discovery, and liked to hear eulogies of&#xD;
e his new clerk. "I must say that it is very&#xD;
gratifying to see a young man winning his&#xD;
, way without help," he said to Walter one&#xD;
day.&#xD;
r " Which is not my case," replied the young&#xD;
I man, lazily.&#xD;
" I fear that I made a mistake in smoothing&#xD;
your road too much, Walter," said his father,&#xD;
gravely. " You have never known .care, and&#xD;
your energies have never been called upon by&#xD;
harsh necessity. Let us hope that you will&#xD;
not have to face troubles in your maturer life,&#xD;
which will require the energy and elasticity&#xD;
only to be gained by youthful struggles."&#xD;
Walter made   no reply, but echoed his&#xD;
father's wish, in his inmost heart, and listened&#xD;
dutifully and attentively to his words, uttered&#xD;
more seriously than usual. The firm had lost&#xD;
money heavily and steadily for several months&#xD;
past.&#xD;
Mr. Montant made his appearance in the&#xD;
private oflice.&#xD;
" Mr. Going," he said, " a certain Mr. Stil-&#xD;
letto and a - friend of his, by the name of~&#xD;
Muller, are without and desire an interview&#xD;
with you. I understand their object is to&#xD;
propose to ~you an undertaking, a sort of&#xD;
scheme, the value of which it is not my place&#xD;
to determine. -But I desire to explain to you&#xD;
that I came across the ocean in company with&#xD;
Mr. Stilletto, and he may possibly refer you&#xD;
to me. Should he do so, believe me it is en-&#xD;
tirely unwarranted, for I know but little about&#xD;
him, and besides I think I understand my&#xD;
position here, as your clerk, too well to use it&#xD;
for the introduction of strangers to my em-&#xD;
ployers."&#xD;
" Very good, Mr. Montant," said Mr. Going.&#xD;
"You are quite right to notify me of this, to&#xD;
prevent any misunderstanding. But as I have&#xD;
leisure for half an hour, I will receive them.&#xD;
I like to hear of new enterprises."&#xD;
" This one," said Montant, lightly, as he&#xD;
was passing out, " has been explained to me&#xD;
before, with the proposition that I should&#xD;
bring it before your notice!t I would not&#xD;
have done so in this case, even had it been&#xD;
within my province!"&#xD;
" It seems to me, father," suggested Walter,&#xD;
when they were again alone, "as if Ernest&#xD;
gave you a bit of advice there, in a delicate&#xD;
and inoffensive manner. It will be quite in-&#xD;
teresting to see what sort of a speculation it&#xD;
is that our noble German friend will not re-&#xD;
commend."&#xD;
The door opened, and two creatures entered&#xD;
whose low bows suggested at once a great&#xD;
lack of good-breeding or of self-respect.&#xD;
normal  position  and  the  th a es   heame&#xD;
visible Walter was forced t tur ir beck to&#xD;
&#xD;
conceal his merriment. Muller's eyes were&#xD;
blinking in an extraordinary manner. He had&#xD;
fortified himself by an extra dose of invig-&#xD;
orating beverages  before  venturing  upon&#xD;
the errand. He told Stilletto that he was1&#xD;
not abashed in the presence of kings, and&#xD;
much less would he feel embarrassed when&#xD;
business called him to the office of a merchants&#xD;
prince.&#xD;
I have before this visited merchant princes.&#xD;
What are they, these merchant princes ? They&#xD;
have money, very much money; but not&#xD;
enough to buy for themselves a friendship in&#xD;
August Muller's soul. And shall , who stands&#xD;
far above them in education ; I, who am their&#xD;
superior in every point or phase of intellect,&#xD;
shall I cringe before - them?  Or shall I step&#xD;
up boldly and let them read in my face that I&#xD;
am more than their equal? Let them only&#xD;
hear me speak," cried he, "and if they are&#xD;
not amazed at the force of my intellect, my&#xD;
name is not Muller. I have more brains than&#xD;
these people, and they will see it; they will re-&#xD;
cognize it; they will, one day, point at me as&#xD;
I pass in the street and say, there goes Au-&#xD;
gust Muller, who knows more than we all put&#xD;
together."&#xD;
" Stop your gas," said Stilletto, nervously.&#xD;
"Your pompous nonsense will turn to meek-&#xD;
ness unexampled before we are ten minutes&#xD;
older. You will, see that money is a king&#xD;
before whom intelligence and education are&#xD;
very slaves."&#xD;
Stilletto was right, for Muller now presented&#xD;
an incarnation of meekness and timidity. He&#xD;
tried to smile pleasantly; but only succeeded in&#xD;
grinning deferentially, while his long lean body&#xD;
was bent in fawning suppliance, and his face&#xD;
grew redder than potations could have made&#xD;
it. Stilletto, however, seemed any thing but&#xD;
abashed. Indeed, that gentleman's self-assur-&#xD;
ance was little less than miraculous.  He&#xD;
drew up his little figure complacently , and&#xD;
took a deliberate survey of the premises with&#xD;
a critical eye, as though he were upon the&#xD;
point of making an offer for the whole, Walter&#xD;
Going included.&#xD;
"Your name is Stilletto ?" said Walter,&#xD;
addressing the owner of this critical eye.&#xD;
"Yes, sir," was the dry response ; and then&#xD;
the little man, seeing no sign of being invited&#xD;
to sit down, deliberately selected a chair,&#xD;
placed it to suit himself, and sat down.&#xD;
"Cool," muttered Walter Going.&#xD;
"Take a seat, Mr. Muller," said Mr. Going,&#xD;
courteously. The great philosopher colored&#xD;
redder than- ever, stammered out that he&#xD;
would prefer to stand, and immediately con-&#xD;
tradicted the assertion by staggering back-&#xD;
ward and forward in search of a chair, drop-&#xD;
ping his hat, knocking his head against the&#xD;
desk in picking it up, and, finally, by the&#xD;
interposition of an ever-watchful providence,&#xD;
ran aground on the sofa, one corner of which&#xD;
tripped him as he was backing away from the&#xD;
desk, and he came to an unexpected seat with&#xD;
a violence which cost the sofa a leg. Here-&#xD;
upon the philosopher was taken with a second&#xD;
nervous attack, and had to be pacified with&#xD;
great energy, on the part of Mr. Going, while&#xD;
Walter laughed outright, and Stilletto looked&#xD;
&#xD;
daggers of vexation and contempt at his&#xD;
miserable companion.&#xD;
" My friend, sir," said Stilletto, with a sneer,&#xD;
"is a philosopher. He is grand in solitude;&#xD;
but, as you see, rather awkward in the&#xD;
world."&#xD;
"I think more of a man who is too timid,&#xD;
than of one who is too bold," said Walter,&#xD;
carelessly. "I think it makes a better im-&#xD;
pression."&#xD;
" You are right, sir," said Mr. Muller, stim-&#xD;
ulated into self-possession by his friend's&#xD;
rebuke. " True intelligence scorns the appro-&#xD;
bation of finery and accomplished manner.&#xD;
True intelligence has been my watchword in&#xD;
life, and I mean to stand upon that platform&#xD;
only."&#xD;
'' To business, gentlemen," suggested Mr.&#xD;
Going.&#xD;
" Commence, my friend," said Mr. Muller,&#xD;
mildly.&#xD;
" Don't make a fool of yourself, if you can&#xD;
help it," Stilletto whispered. "Be a- man,&#xD;
and speak out. Is this your boasted cour-&#xD;
age?"&#xD;
" Well, then," commenced Mr. Muller, taking&#xD;
an imaginary pipe fremui his lips,-somehow&#xD;
the movement gave hiiii confidence,-" Gentle-&#xD;
men, I stand before a great house ! A noble,&#xD;
an affluent house, a mighty firm, based upon&#xD;
high  respectability, guided  by  wisdom,&#xD;
prompted in all its dealings by the mighty&#xD;
intellect of its members, inspired by the prin-&#xD;
ciples of integrity and honor, and influenced&#xD;
by that high ambition which sees in the accu-&#xD;
mulation of wealth but the means of accom-&#xD;
plishing worthier objects. To your desire-of&#xD;
assisting enterprise ; to your ambition to be&#xD;
pillars of the temple of intelligence which this&#xD;
century is proudly erecting; to your appre-&#xD;
ciation of new and advanced ideas, and to your&#xD;
heartfelt wish for the promotion of the welfare&#xD;
of your fellow-men, do I appeal (though I&#xD;
shall also.point out to you an almost princely&#xD;
remuneration), for the assistance which I,&#xD;
August Muller, have come to ask."&#xD;
The great man looked around for approba-&#xD;
tion.  Mr. Going was leaning back in his&#xD;
chair, looking blandly before him, and balanc-&#xD;
ing his paper-knife, with one hand resting on&#xD;
the desk. Walter yawned once or twice, and&#xD;
said, "Nearly time to go on 'change, father."&#xD;
Stilletto was shifting nervously on his chair&#xD;
and frowning disapproval at the philosopher's&#xD;
prolixity.&#xD;
" If I understand my friend correctly," he&#xD;
interposed, immediately, "he thinks our under-&#xD;
taking sure to yield an immense fortune to&#xD;
those who will have spunk enough to go into&#xD;
it. I would suggest, Muller, that these gen-&#xD;
tlemen's time is valuable, and that you may&#xD;
get them to listen to plain statements, but not&#xD;
to half-witted harrangues, such as you have&#xD;
just given them."&#xD;
"Quite right, my noble, foreign friend,"&#xD;
said Walter, approvingly, " I suggest that yon&#xD;
take the floor; for if your clever friend does&#xD;
the talking, we shall not soon come to the'&#xD;
end. That end, I confess, I look forward to,&#xD;
with enthusiasm."&#xD;
Walter's suggestion was favorably received,&#xD;

30                   GOING AND SON.&#xD;
&#xD;
and Mr. Stilletto told the wondrous tale. So&#xD;
much of it as belongs to this narrative has&#xD;
been explained in a previous chapter.&#xD;
Between Stilletto's concise and very credi-&#xD;
ble statements, and Mr. Muller's eloquent and&#xD;
enthusiastic interruptions, corrections, and&#xD;
enlargements on the subject, considerable&#xD;
time was consumed. From the beginning of&#xD;
the interview, the firm determined to have&#xD;
nothing to do with such a seedy-looking man&#xD;
as the philosopher, or such an unmistakable&#xD;
sharper as Antonio Stilletto. Yet a fortune&#xD;
seemed within the grasp of any man of means&#xD;
and enterprise, and, for a moment, Mr. Going&#xD;
felt strongly tempted to say, "Yes, we will go&#xD;
in I" But the twinkling eyes and red nose of&#xD;
the philosopher, his sycophantic smile and&#xD;
forlorn tout ensemble, and the uncomfortable&#xD;
shrewdness which characterized Mr. Stilletto,&#xD;
restrained father and son. When the matter&#xD;
had been fully disclosed in all its fascinating,&#xD;
though, perhaps, delusive details, Mr. Going&#xD;
said :-&#xD;
"Well, gentlemen, this certainly sounds&#xD;
very well, but my business-life has taught me&#xD;
caution. I hardly know you, and know noth-&#xD;
ing at all of your personal standing."&#xD;
"As for me, sir," said Stilletto, "I would&#xD;
beg to refer to my friend and traveling com-&#xD;
panion, Mr. Ernest Montant.&#xD;
"We will waive that subject," said the old&#xD;
gentleman, with a smile at this fulfillment of&#xD;
Montant's suspicion; "for it is my duty to&#xD;
positively refuse your proffer. The undertak-&#xD;
ing is entirely out of our lime of business, and&#xD;
we do not choose to change. We have given&#xD;
you a patient hearing, because you desired it,&#xD;
but I believe that it was thoroughly under-&#xD;
stood at the beginning, that we did not hold&#xD;
out the slightest encouragement to warrant&#xD;
tie trouble you have taken."&#xD;
The philosopher's face fell, and it wvas witlh&#xD;
difficulty that his friend suppressed his vexation.&#xD;
"In that case," said Mr. Muller, rising,&#xD;
"there is nothing to detain us any longer.&#xD;
Good morning, gentlemen, and pardon me for&#xD;
saying, as I take mny leave, that I am disap-&#xD;
pointed, even dismayed at my failure to touch&#xD;
a responsive chord in your hearts, which I&#xD;
imagined would throb in unison with my views&#xD;
and ambitions. You will hear again of August&#xD;
Muller."&#xD;
" God forbid," interrupted Walter, face-&#xD;
tiously.&#xD;
"He is not a man to be utterly disheartened&#xD;
by the failure of his maiden effort. I have&#xD;
laid before you a grand undertaking. I had&#xD;
chosen you as my stepping-stone to the exalt-&#xD;
ed position which I am certain, yes, gentlemen,&#xD;
certain to occupy. You should feel flattered,&#xD;
complimented, and proud of August Muller's&#xD;
choice, for his choice is not that of an ordinary&#xD;
man ! You have discarded hin, you close&#xD;
your ears and purse against him, look you that&#xD;
the time may not come when you shall envy&#xD;
him."&#xD;
" Fiddlesticks," said Stilletto, angrily, "I&#xD;
must apologize for my friend here, for I verily&#xD;
believe that if he had stayed at home, we&#xD;
would now have been in a very different situ-&#xD;
ation."&#xD;
&#xD;
"Stilletto," quoth the other, turning grand-&#xD;
ly toward him, " your remarks can not offend&#xD;
me. Your meaning is too contemptible, and&#xD;
your expressions are too coarse for me to&#xD;
notice."&#xD;
Stiletto took his hat and walked to the&#xD;
door, rudely pushing Muller out of his way.&#xD;
With his hand on the knob, he looked impu-&#xD;
dently at old Mr. Going, who had taken up the&#xD;
newspaper, and at Walter, who did not at-&#xD;
tempt to conceal his merriment, and said,&#xD;
" Good morning."&#xD;
He was gone; but that last look of his re-&#xD;
mained. That devilish, mocking " Good morn-&#xD;
ing " rang in their ears some time, though&#xD;
neither Mr. Going nor his son were easilyin-&#xD;
timidated, the presence of Stilletto seemed&#xD;
to have infected the very air of the room, and&#xD;
recurrently wrought the  impression  that&#xD;
something repulsive had crossed their path&#xD;
and brushed closely enough by them to leave&#xD;
its mark. After Stilletto's sudden exit, the&#xD;
philosopher quickly wilted ; his self-assertion&#xD;
completely left him. Hardly could he re-&#xD;
member that his hat was still in his hand.&#xD;
The blood rushed to his face as he turned to&#xD;
wish a good day to the gentlemen, and met&#xD;
Walter's laughing gaze, and muttering an un-&#xD;
intelligible something, he rushed out of the.&#xD;
room, stumbling over the threshold of the&#xD;
door and nearly demolishing a clerk who hap-&#xD;
pened to be near.&#xD;
Our hero was to dine at the house in Fifth&#xD;
Avenue that night, and when business was&#xD;
over he walked up town with Walter Going.&#xD;
"You have all the particulars of this Hob-&#xD;
goblin Mining and Manufacturing Company,&#xD;
you said ?" asked the latter.&#xD;
-' Yes," replied the other, curtly.&#xD;
"What do you think of it ?"&#xD;
I would prefer to keep my opinion to my-&#xD;
self, if you will allow me."&#xD;
" May I ask why, sir?"&#xD;
" Because I am your youngest clerk, and I&#xD;
think it would be out of place for me to dis-&#xD;
cuss matters which can only be settled by the&#xD;
firm."&#xD;
" This is some of your imported German&#xD;
cant," said Walter, impatiently.  " Perhaps,&#xD;
in your superior wisdom, you would conde-&#xD;
scend to benefit me with your ideas, if I&#xD;
were to inform you beforehand, that father&#xD;
and I gave the seedy gentlemen the grand&#xD;
shake, untanimnously."&#xD;
"In that case," replied ourhero, calmly, "I&#xD;
have no objection to allow that I think you&#xD;
have done very rightly." L&#xD;
The conversation then turned on other mat-&#xD;
ters until they had reached the house, and,&#xD;
after preparing themselves for dinner in Wal-&#xD;
ter's room, descended to the parlor.&#xD;
" Jessie is in there," said Walter. "You&#xD;
have my permission to go in and say good&#xD;
evening, while I make a desperate attempt to&#xD;
infuse some system into the waiter's bead.&#xD;
By Jove, he is such a dunce, this sweet son&#xD;
of Erin, that, were it not for me, I think he&#xD;
would bring us our claret in champagne cool-&#xD;
ers and put the champagne on the kitchen&#xD;
range to give it the proper temperature."&#xD;
So our friend entered the drawing-room&#xD;
&#xD;
alone. It was a dark and stately room, with&#xD;
bronzes and statuary, rich carpets and costly&#xD;
mrrnzes fine pictures and fancy ornaments,&#xD;
carved furniture and massive chandeliers. The&#xD;
blinds were closed to exclude the plebeian&#xD;
light of day from all this luxury, so he could&#xD;
scarcely recognize Jessie Going, until she had&#xD;
approached him, extending her little hand&#xD;
graciously.&#xD;
She was taller than Josephine Van Strom,&#xD;
and comparatively slender.  Her figure was&#xD;
not less graceful and elegant, while her face,&#xD;
set off by luxurious  black  hair, seemed&#xD;
molded into the most refined and delicate&#xD;
lines of beauty. She was then but in her&#xD;
eighteenth year, and was naturally very lively,&#xD;
lacking entirely that passionate earnestness&#xD;
which was the most dangerous charm    of&#xD;
Josephine Van Strom. Jessie Going was&#xD;
called a coquette by some; but she was en-&#xD;
tirely too good-hearted to go far in that line.&#xD;
A great belle in society, she was still a great&#xD;
home-body, and was entirely wrapped up in&#xD;
her love for her father.&#xD;
When he first heard the rustle of her heavy&#xD;
blue dress, knowing that she was in the room,&#xD;
lie felt half bewitched, spell-bound, and obli-&#xD;
vious of all the rest of the world. No matter&#xD;
what doubts and inconsistencies controlled or&#xD;
agitated him when away from her, when in&#xD;
her presence he was her captive.&#xD;
He took her hand and looked at her with&#xD;
wonder and admiration. In those black eyes&#xD;
and arched brows, in that delicate nose and&#xD;
those charming lips there was no hint of&#xD;
Josephine, and Josephine is forgotte  ' the&#xD;
presence of this supernaturally hands&#xD;
brunette.&#xD;
"I am very glad to see you," she said, in a&#xD;
charmingly musical voice, "for I expect some&#xD;
gentlemen to dinner whom I want you to&#xD;
know."&#xD;
"Are they fashionable young men ?"&#xD;
"Quite so.  One has a gallant mustache&#xD;
and eagle-eyes, and his name is Faro. The&#xD;
other is small, but graceful; dances superbly,&#xD;
and his name is Willy Wheeler. You will&#xD;
have a chance to judge of our New York&#xD;
lions."&#xD;
" I am not very anxious to meet the lions,&#xD;
neither do I feel in the least inclined to shun&#xD;
their acquaintance," said he, dryly.&#xD;
"Mr. Faro is very conceited," said Miss&#xD;
Jessie, " but I don't object to that. I like a&#xD;
man to be somewhat conceited."&#xD;
'-Do I suit you in this respect," he asked,&#xD;
smiling.&#xD;
"Yes, you are certainly conceited, but you&#xD;
are not flat and stupid, like some I know, and&#xD;
therefore your conceit meets with my appro-&#xD;
bation, which I herewith bestow upon you.&#xD;
But I wish to have a few moments of serious&#xD;
conversation with you," she added, changing&#xD;
her tone and manner; " How is papa's busi-&#xD;
ness going on?"&#xD;
"How little you must know of business to&#xD;
select me, a junior clerk for your informant.&#xD;
Walter will tell you; for, indeed, I have but a&#xD;
small chance to find out. To be honest, even&#xD;
if h ad--",&#xD;
"You would not tell me ? That is the old&#xD;
&#xD;
story. None of you consider me competent to&#xD;
receive even a few hints about papa's business.&#xD;
And yet, Mr. Montant, I do not consider this&#xD;
fair, not even wise. I know that I am very&#xD;
young, and utterly incapable of understanding.&#xD;
some, things in detail; but, I think, that if pa-&#xD;
pa and Walter had consulted me upon certain&#xD;
important questions, which I only heard of&#xD;
when it was too late, they would have been&#xD;
better off to-day."&#xD;
I quite agree with you, Miss Jessie," said&#xD;
our hero, gravely. "I think that a husband,&#xD;
for example, should always inform and consult&#xD;
his wife upon very important questions of&#xD;
business. I believe that a woman's intuition,&#xD;
i many cases, is capable of great, almost&#xD;
N onderful accuracy and soundness of judg-&#xD;
ment."&#xD;
"I am glad to .hear you say that, and I am&#xD;
sure it will make your wife very happy to be&#xD;
treated a little better than a doll 1" she cried,&#xD;
artlessly. " Yet you will not tell me how papa&#xD;
is prospering; and yet, what do I really desire&#xD;
to know? Whether cotton, or oil, or coal, or&#xD;
hides, or any other nasty thing, is up or down,&#xD;
may be of little moment to me when I am con-&#xD;
vinced, and convinced I am, that the firm has&#xD;
lost mmey heavily of late. I see it in my&#xD;
father's fahe, when he wants to appear merri-&#xD;
er than ever. I see it in Walter's restless,&#xD;
irritable mood. I feel it," she said, shaking&#xD;
her little head, "and when a woman feels the&#xD;
truth of any thing, no assertion, reasoning, or&#xD;
argument, can convince her to the contrary."&#xD;
" I do not for a moment imagine that any&#xD;
thing has happened to give your father seri-&#xD;
ous apprehensions. Your name is a good one,&#xD;
Miss'Goingandso long as it remains intact, there&#xD;
may be fortunes lost under its protecting wing,&#xD;
and fortunes regained by its unbroken strength,&#xD;
without the outer world being much the wiser.&#xD;
I am inclined to think that your father is&#xD;
merely a little troubled about the propriety,&#xD;
at this moment, of buying the 'Priory.' It&#xD;
is a great extravagance, and if you wish to&#xD;
exercise your foresight-you understand me ?&#xD;
"Yes, and I heartily thank you for the&#xD;
suggestion. The Priory shall not be bought&#xD;
if I can help it! How are you getting along&#xD;
in the office?"&#xD;
" I am trying hard to rise, and make myself&#xD;
more useful than I can in my present inferior&#xD;
position."&#xD;
" Walter has told me much about you, which&#xD;
I will not repeat, because it would be a breach&#xD;
of confidence, and besides it might increase&#xD;
your self-conceit beyond the limits which I&#xD;
consider suitable to your character. You have&#xD;
enough already."&#xD;
Ernest laughed. "You are taking quite a&#xD;
motherly interest in me," he said. "I feel&#xD;
flattered by the attention with which you have&#xD;
investigated my character."&#xD;
" Seriously speaking, I think that you will&#xD;
be placed in a much more responsible position&#xD;
before long, and here is the point of my re-&#xD;
mark. I want you to make me a promise.&#xD;
It seems odd to you, I know, for me to ask&#xD;
such a thing; but I have learned to look at&#xD;
you with Walter's eyes; will you make me&#xD;
this promise ?"&#xD;
&#xD;

Our hero looked at her face, all glowing&#xD;
with fixedness of purpose, and felt that he&#xD;
could refuse her nothing; "even a promise&#xD;
of marriage," he thought to himself.&#xD;
"Let us sit in this corner," said Miss Jessie,&#xD;
with importance. " I do not want any one&#xD;
to listen, and leading the way to a sofa in the&#xD;
farthest corner of the room, she continued,&#xD;
with more earnestness in her tone and&#xD;
manner than before."&#xD;
" Mr. Montant, from various sources I have&#xD;
gathered the knowledge that you have won&#xD;
the good opinion of all your mercantile ac-&#xD;
quaintances. They are unanimous in the an-&#xD;
nouncernent of your reliability.  Now Mr.&#xD;
Montant, you know that we are a very extrav-&#xD;
agant family. I know what we spend every&#xD;
year, and it worries me. I have thought the&#xD;
matter all over, and this is my conclusion,&#xD;
plain though startling. That no success in&#xD;
legitimate business can support such extrava-&#xD;
gance, and it must cease or-" she paused an&#xD;
instant.&#xD;
Ernest did not say a word.&#xD;
" Your silence tells me that I am right,"&#xD;
continued the young girl; "and now comes&#xD;
the promise. If real danger should come,-&#xD;
if ever you should see that the threatening&#xD;
storm must wreck us, and that ruin and dis-&#xD;
honor stare my poor father in the face, will&#xD;
you then, at such an hour, remember that we&#xD;
were your first, your best friends in a strange&#xD;
country ? - Will you stand by us if the world&#xD;
turn its back? Will you devote yourself to&#xD;
my father, save him if possible, sink with him&#xD;
if necessary, even at the cost of refusing the&#xD;
splendid offers that may be made to you to&#xD;
leave him?"        .&#xD;
She ceased, breathless. Long concealed ex-&#xD;
citement, suddenly burst forth, seemed to have&#xD;
changed her very nature.&#xD;
" One word," said he, scarcely able to sup-&#xD;
press his emotion at the spectacle of this&#xD;
beautiful creature pleading so eloquently for&#xD;
her father. " Why do you ask this?  What&#xD;
has put such fancies into your head ?"&#xD;
" Intuition, foreboding, call it what you&#xD;
please! Will you promise ?" ie thought a&#xD;
moment, and then said, deliberately,-&#xD;
S I promise."&#xD;
"Thank you, thank you!" she said, holding&#xD;
out both hands to him. "I shall never forget&#xD;
it"&#xD;
" And I," he replied, looking into the depths&#xD;
of her dark eyes, and holding her soft, warm&#xD;
hands in his, "I shall never forget-my pro-&#xD;
mise."&#xD;
" Dinner is ready," said Walter, entering,&#xD;
and to dinner they went, where Miss Jessie&#xD;
flirted so outrageously with Mr. Faro and&#xD;
Wheeler, and so completely ignored our hero,&#xD;
that on his way home that night he muttered&#xD;
angrily,-&#xD;
I must be mistaken in her ! She is a&#xD;
heartless coquette, and no woman for Ernest&#xD;
Montant to love! But that promise I shall&#xD;
keep however it turns out."&#xD;

CHAPTER VIII,&#xD;
MASQUERADE.&#xD;
"Now, this overdone, or come tardy off, though it&#xD;
make the unskillful laugh, can not but make the judi-&#xD;
cious grieve."--HAMrET.&#xD;
Two months or so passed by and Mr. Going&#xD;
did not receive any message from Mr. Van&#xD;
Strom, with reference to the sale of the Priory.&#xD;
He had dismissed the subject from his mind,&#xD;
and was heartily glad that the temptation to&#xD;
commit so great an act of extravagance had&#xD;
passed. His daughter, by well chosen hints,&#xD;
and the general tone of conversation had&#xD;
helped his second thoughts on the matter; and&#xD;
Walter, even, moved by the eloquence of his&#xD;
sweet sister, had ceased to mention the subject,&#xD;
when, one day their father came home look-&#xD;
ing troubled and yet amused at something&#xD;
which had occurred. He handed his daughter&#xD;
a note which he had just received, and she&#xD;
read with a mixture of vexation and merri-&#xD;
ment, as follows:-&#xD;
MR. GoING-DEAR SIR:-&#xD;
I have concluded to cede you my country&#xD;
place, known as the Priory, with two hun-&#xD;
dred acres of land, comprised in what is known&#xD;
as the Priory Islands, for the sum of two&#xD;
hundred and twenty-five thousand dollars, to&#xD;
wit; five thousand cash, upon signing the con-&#xD;
tract, the balance of one-third of the whole&#xD;
upon my signing the deed, in cash, and two-&#xD;
thirds to remain on bond and mortgage. My&#xD;
lawyer, Mr. Rivulette has put himself in coin-&#xD;
munication with your attorneys. Messrs. Grave&#xD;
&amp;amp; Paradise, so that the title will be searched&#xD;
at once. I shall call at your office this week&#xD;
to sign the preliminary contract, and I propose&#xD;
to give you possession in one week from this&#xD;
date.&#xD;
I take pleasure in announcing to you the&#xD;
marriage of my son John to Miss Bella Smith,&#xD;
the daughter of Nehemiah Smith, manufacturer&#xD;
of gentleman's outer garments, in the village&#xD;
of New Rocket. The young and happy couple&#xD;
desire to say farewell to the Priory, in a man-&#xD;
ner suited to the position my family have al-&#xD;
ways occupied, and you, your son, and Miss&#xD;
Going, are hereby cordially invited to assist&#xD;
at the last festivity at the old place. Your&#xD;
company is respectfully requested, at eight&#xD;
o'clock, punctually, on Thursday evening next,&#xD;
in fancy dress.&#xD;
Yours, respectfully,&#xD;
JoN' JAcon VAN STRoM.&#xD;
P.S.-I will be dressed as Napoleon the&#xD;
First; will you allow me to suggest that you&#xD;
should assume the costume of old Blucher.&#xD;
I think, as you are driving me from house and&#xD;
home, this would be appropriate. Or Welling-&#xD;
ton would do as well. Miss Going might then&#xD;
appear as the Goddess of War.&#xD;
"I can not see my way clear to refuse." said&#xD;
Mr. Going, much perplexed.&#xD;
" What do you mean ?" cried Miss Jessie,&#xD;
horrified. "You are never going as Blucher&#xD;
or Wellington, I hope?"&#xD;
"Not quite,"' answered her father, smiling;&#xD;
&#xD;
FANTASY.&#xD;
&#xD;
"but I suppose I must buy the place, and I&#xD;
think we had better go to the party, provided&#xD;
David Worth will allow us to stay at his villa&#xD;
after the ball."&#xD;
"But, surely, you don't think any of us had&#xD;
better go in fancy dress ?"&#xD;
"No; we must arrange about that."&#xD;
"It would be impolite not to comply with&#xD;
the wishes of our host," suggested the young&#xD;
lady.&#xD;
"I think we had better let Mr. Montant&#xD;
arrange it for us," said her father. "I shall&#xD;
have to send him up at all events, for, although&#xD;
I mean to adhere to my agreement about the&#xD;
place, yet I can not pay him the money until a&#xD;
couple of weeks from to-day. I have no doubt&#xD;
that this will suit him as well."&#xD;
"I hope lie will refuse, the condition,"&#xD;
thought Miss Jessie; but she was not one of&#xD;
those who talk when the time for words has&#xD;
passed, and so the conversation dropped.&#xD;
The next day our hero went to the Priory,&#xD;
where Josephine had watched and waited in&#xD;
the true sense of the term. They had corre-&#xD;
sponded; yes, they were so foolish and impru-&#xD;
dent as to correspond; and when they now&#xD;
met they felt as though they had known each&#xD;
other for years. They had another long walk&#xD;
to the shore of the Sound; more conversations&#xD;
on serious and solemn subjects took place, and&#xD;
IMiss Jessie Going, by her preference of the&#xD;
gallant Mr.-Faro, and charming Willy Wheeler;&#xD;
had accomplished what, perhaps, she did not&#xD;
wish to accomplish, the alienation of our hero,&#xD;
and the opening of the door for a rival to step&#xD;
into his affections.&#xD;
Mr. Van Strom accepted the propositions&#xD;
made to him; gracefully excused the Goings&#xD;
from wearing francy dresses, and extended a&#xD;
pressing invitation to our hero, which he ac&#xD;
eepted with pleasure, and Mr. David Worth,&#xD;
on receiving Mr. Going's note, professed him-&#xD;
self delighted at the prospect of entertaining&#xD;
the whole party after the ball. So every thing&#xD;
was satisfactorily arranged, and on the ap-&#xD;
pointed Thursday Mr. Going, with his son and&#xD;
daughter, and Ernest Montant, made their&#xD;
appearance at Mr. Worth's villa. After a jolly&#xD;
reception, and-a good dinner, they dressed (but&#xD;
not in fiancy costume) for the ball, and finally&#xD;
arrived at the Priory at a quarter past eight.&#xD;
*    *    *    *    *    *    *&#xD;
The Priory did not present a very festive&#xD;
appearance. The moon was at the full, and&#xD;
perhaps earthly illuminations grew dim in her&#xD;
bright rays; but the windows, certainly, did&#xD;
not seem lighted up brilliantly, the glare from&#xD;
the hall did not dazzle the eye when the door&#xD;
was opened, nor was the ear saluted with&#xD;
heavenly strains of music as one entered the&#xD;
grounds. Perhaps they were drowned by the&#xD;
low moaning of the wind, which was sighing&#xD;
in the trees. It had a desolate tone, as though&#xD;
portentous of a change in the weather, or&#xD;
other mischief; and, hark!1 there is a strange,&#xD;
unearthly note, sounding near, sounding far&#xD;
ol, changing, swelling, dying away-distinct,&#xD;
yet ghostly. The old bell, hanging upon that&#xD;
old em, is slowly tolling! They heard it as&#xD;
they appi-oached, but comment was stopped,&#xD;
fr now they stood in the great hall.&#xD;
3&#xD;
&#xD;
33&#xD;
&#xD;
One long chandelier, apparently suspended&#xD;
from the clouds, distributed a doubtful luster&#xD;
on the assemblage of Van Strom portraiture, in&#xD;
their moldy frames. In the flickering, smoky&#xD;
light, they seemed frowning upon the un-&#xD;
accustomed revelry below. In the *orners&#xD;
and niches of the vaulted ceiling there reigned&#xD;
a confusion of darkness, suggestive of spiders&#xD;
and cobwebs. In one corner of the room a&#xD;
little platform could be dimly descried, on&#xD;
which were perched four American citizens of&#xD;
African descent, fiddling away with such&#xD;
rapidity, and such utter disregard for harmony,&#xD;
that it was really astonishing that the platform&#xD;
could stand up under it. They were shaking&#xD;
their woolly heads as they sawed away, and&#xD;
stamping their feet, rolling their eyes, and&#xD;
showing their teeth, while their shrill voices&#xD;
rang out like the shrieks of agonized demons,&#xD;
as they called the figures of the dance.&#xD;
"lForwart two! Jeinmens to do ri-i-i-ght!&#xD;
All jassay acrosst."&#xD;
Near the door stood the master of the house,&#xD;
in the dress of the exile of Elba, if the con-&#xD;
queror of empires got his clothing when young,&#xD;
and wore the same suit until he grew stout,&#xD;
the appearance of Mr. Van Strom was his-&#xD;
torically correct, except that he added to the&#xD;
"little corporal's" taste by mounting a great&#xD;
powdered wig.&#xD;
John was already dancing at the head of a&#xD;
quadrille. Like his father, lie, too, wore a&#xD;
white horse-hair wig, and the miraculous lean-&#xD;
ness of his body was displayed to advantage&#xD;
by a tight-fitting green jacket, which disdained&#xD;
to keep company with the knee-breeches,&#xD;
which encumbered his lower limbs. His mis-&#xD;
erable calves were stuffed out to an impossible&#xD;
size; but the plated buckles on his square-&#xD;
toed shoes were his pride and delight. He&#xD;
could not refrain from stealing an occasional&#xD;
glance of admiration at them whenever the&#xD;
dance allowed him an opportunity. He ideal-&#xD;
ized the plain steps which we ordinary mortals&#xD;
take in a plain quadrille, into such swings, and&#xD;
twists, and hops. and shuffles, that lie bore an&#xD;
extraordinary resemblance to a deranged frog,&#xD;
or an inspired monkey.   His grins would&#xD;
rather incline one to place him among the lat-&#xD;
ter, were it not for an ornament which lie&#xD;
wore proudly, and which was a source of&#xD;
anxiety to those who knew him best. This&#xD;
was a real old-fashioned broad-sword he had&#xD;
discovered among the family relics, probably&#xD;
handed down by a certain warlike grandsire,&#xD;
whose portrait hung in a conspicuous place in&#xD;
the gallery overhead, and frowned grimly&#xD;
down on his audacious descendant. Ile was&#xD;
dancing with his wife. Bella had insisted&#xD;
upon appearing in ordinary costume, and, after&#xD;
a long struggle, carried her point. She ap-&#xD;
peared unabashed, but nervous and pre-oc-&#xD;
cupied. .&#xD;
"Who is that humpback, dancing opposite&#xD;
Mr. and Mrs. Van Strom ?" asked Montant,&#xD;
as they watched that curious assembly, with&#xD;
wonder.&#xD;
" That is Mr. Paradise, of the firm of Grave&#xD;
&amp;amp; Paradise, our lawyers," answered Walter&#xD;
Going.&#xD;
" He is joining in with everybody, odd and&#xD;

&#xD;
absurd as ever," criticized Miss Jessie. Look&#xD;
at him, laughing and capering about, like a&#xD;
deformed goblin. He seems to have left all~&#xD;
pride and dignity in his office, as usual."&#xD;
" And yet he is one of the most clear-headed&#xD;
men Ieknow," said old Mr. Going.&#xD;
" His hunchback has demoralized and im-&#xD;
bittered him to such an extent that he discards&#xD;
dignity, and sometimes even decency, to save&#xD;
himself from entire apathy and utter despair."&#xD;
" He may certainly thank his deformity for&#xD;
protecting him." said Miss Jessie. "If it were&#xD;
not for pity's sake, he would have received&#xD;
many a sound beating for his insulting way&#xD;
to ladies."&#xD;
" He would just as lief go into a lady's bed-&#xD;
room as not, without even knocking at the&#xD;
door," said Walter, " and his conversation is&#xD;
so gross that it exceeds all limit."&#xD;
"And his sarcasm is as bad," added his&#xD;
sister.  " He puts in a disagreeable speech&#xD;
whenever he can, and the only way to meet&#xD;
him. or gain immunity from him, is to pay him&#xD;
back in his own coin. I have done so without&#xD;
scruple, and, I assure you, he likes me for it."&#xD;
Mr. Paradise was dancing with a spinster,&#xD;
who represented Night by the addition to her&#xD;
costume of a bunch of feathers on one shoulder,&#xD;
which might have belonged to a pre-Adamite&#xD;
owl, and a circle of little rents in her dress,&#xD;
through which shone her white petticoat like&#xD;
stars.&#xD;
Bella's father appeared as Hamlet, in his&#xD;
most despondent mood.&#xD;
He seemed ready, to be or not to be, any&#xD;
thing that might be desired by the company&#xD;
or by the enthusiastic black fiddlers, if he could&#xD;
only understand what would be required of him&#xD;
next.&#xD;
To our hero's great surprise, he soon dis-&#xD;
covered Antonio Stilletto among the dancers.&#xD;
and he was footing it as confidently as though&#xD;
the costume of a Prince of Wales in the good&#xD;
old days, which he wore jauntily, indicated his&#xD;
real social status. How he could have ob-&#xD;
tained an invitation to the ball was the ques-&#xD;
tion. He had expressed his great desire to be&#xD;
introduced into good society several times, and&#xD;
our hero felt sure that some hidden history at.&#xD;
tacked to his presence.&#xD;
" Who is that lady dancing with the little&#xD;
Prince of Wales," he inquired.&#xD;
' That is Mrs. Fatman," Miss Jessie answer-&#xD;
ed. "They call her handsome: but I can not&#xD;
see the beauty. She was a buxom, red-faced&#xD;
girl, and the daughter of a baker before she&#xD;
was married. Now, just look at her-thin, and&#xD;
unhealthy, all dress and show, and very little&#xD;
foundation on which to build, I should imag.&#xD;
ine."&#xD;
"Birds of a feather flock together," thought&#xD;
he. "If the lady is a parvenue, I am not sur-&#xD;
prised at seeingher with my worthy friend."&#xD;
"Fatman must be here," said Mr. Going,&#xD;
looking around upon the crowd that by this&#xD;
time had nearly tilled the hall. Yes, and a&#xD;
goodly crowd of people it was. The best, the&#xD;
proudest families were there, for Van Strom&#xD;
was a fine old name, and those who did not&#xD;
respect the present generation, had come to&#xD;
pay their tribute to the generations which had&#xD;
&#xD;
lived and died in the noble old Priory, and had&#xD;
not been forgotten.&#xD;
" Here I am," said Mr. Fatman, stepping up.&#xD;
After he had greeted the party, he added&#xD;
" Everybody seems to know already that this&#xD;
place is virtually yours. I can not help envy.&#xD;
ing you. for your future neighbors are de-&#xD;
lighted, and anxious to welcome you, with the&#xD;
exception of a few old cronies who prefer the&#xD;
society of cobwebs upon the walls, and cob-&#xD;
webs in certain brains we know of, hey! to life,&#xD;
and youth, and beauty."- Upon which he made&#xD;
a profound bow to Jessie.&#xD;
Our hero soon found his way to the side of&#xD;
Josephine.&#xD;
"Do you believe in forbodings ?" asked the&#xD;
widow, clinging tightly to his arm as they&#xD;
walked apart from  the crowd in a compara.&#xD;
tively deserted part of the hall.&#xD;
' Why do you ask the question, Mrs. Van&#xD;
Strom ?"&#xD;
"Because, in my heart, I am certain that&#xD;
something is going to happen to-night. It may&#xD;
be a foolish fancy; but it agrees with another&#xD;
circumstance of no cheerful nature."&#xD;
" And what may that be," said, he carelessly;&#xD;
for our hero was proof against superstition.&#xD;
" The bell rang last night," she replied, not&#xD;
much reassured. "I heard it in my room."&#xD;
"It was the wind. Have you heard it to-&#xD;
night."&#xD;
"No, let us step on the back piazza and&#xD;
listen."&#xD;
So they walked out through the door into&#xD;
the night and listened.  The wind had in-&#xD;
creased somewhat; but it was warm as in&#xD;
midsummer. For several minutes they hardly&#xD;
breathed, straining their ears to the utmost,&#xD;
when-there was no mistake here-the sound&#xD;
of the bell came to them as distinctly as reality&#xD;
personified. First low and scarcely audible,&#xD;
then with a clear but doleful peal, slowly re-&#xD;
turning, with terrible regularity. The fatal&#xD;
bell was tolling.&#xD;
" Let us go in," gasped Josephine, in genii-&#xD;
ine alarm.&#xD;
"I am going to see who is ringing that&#xD;
bell," said her companion, resolutely.&#xD;
" Pray don't--not now. There might be&#xD;
danger," she urged, clinging closer to him.&#xD;
"Danger or not, I will solve this mystery if&#xD;
possible. I will be back in a moment."&#xD;
"Stay. For my sake stay," she pleaded,&#xD;
imploringly, with a tone of voice which caused&#xD;
him to look for a moment into her eyes as if&#xD;
he would search her inmost soul for an expla-&#xD;
nation.&#xD;
"I can not, for I owe it to my manhood&#xD;
not to be frightened at such a scarecrow as&#xD;
this."&#xD;
There was no chance for further resistance&#xD;
to his determination, so she said quickly,-&#xD;
"I will go with you."&#xD;
"I advise you to stay where you are," he&#xD;
answered, shrugging his shoulders. "If you&#xD;
do not follow my advice, I have at all events&#xD;
done my duty in warning you."&#xD;
Instead of an answer, she sprang down the&#xD;
steps after him, and they two silently and&#xD;
cautiously approached the old elm on which&#xD;
the bell was suspended. At every step they&#xD;
&#xD;
expected to hear another peal, and even our&#xD;
hero's heart beat faster than usual, while Jo-&#xD;
sephine trembled like an aspen leaf till she&#xD;
could hardly sustain herself. The night was&#xD;
almost as light as day, so bright were the&#xD;
moonbeams.&#xD;
In a few minutes they saw the bell plainly&#xD;
and distinctly.  It was perfectly quiet. Not a&#xD;
sound, not a vibration, not a trace of motion&#xD;
could be recognized. Around was silence and&#xD;
solitude, and it hung there like a dead thing.&#xD;
They returned to the piazza, laughing at their&#xD;
temporary agitation, when  suddenly there&#xD;
came another peal, a loud, angry note, which&#xD;
seemed to vibrate through their frames like a&#xD;
shock of electricity. For an instant Ernest&#xD;
stood spell-bound, then he darted off toward&#xD;
the old tree, while Josephine stood with&#xD;
clasped hands, not daring to follow him. He&#xD;
returned in a few moments. No further sound&#xD;
had been heard by either, and he had been&#xD;
utterly unable to find any sign around the&#xD;
mysterious metal.&#xD;
Josephine shook her head gravely.  " What&#xD;
do you think of it?"&#xD;
" I am convinced it is either a serious joke&#xD;
played upon the family, or the effect of the wind,&#xD;
or the old tree is shaken by subterranean causes.&#xD;
Otherwise, I prefer to disbelieve my senses, to&#xD;
believing in that species of madness called&#xD;
superstition."&#xD;
" Huh," whispered Josephine; "do not&#xD;
speak so positively. There are powers we&#xD;
must not evoke by defying them entirely."&#xD;
".And yet I do defy them," answered he, de-&#xD;
liberately. "As long as God continues to me&#xD;
the full possession of the faculties he has given&#xD;
me, 1 intend to use them in spite of all bells&#xD;
and ghosts and goblins, or other creatures of&#xD;
superstition.&#xD;
They waited some minutes, and as no fur-&#xD;
ther sound was heard, they went back again in-&#xD;
to the house. Supper had just been announced,&#xD;
and a very agreeable change was noticeable in&#xD;
the ceasing of those intolerable fiddles.&#xD;
'he supper-room presented a great improve-&#xD;
ment over the scene in the dancing-hall. Here,&#xD;
at last, the old splendor of the family shone&#xD;
again. It was not the dining-room, but the&#xD;
large, empty picture gallery, .in which the ban-&#xD;
quet was served. The plate, the glasses, the&#xD;
table ornaments, were magnificent, and the&#xD;
name of Delmonico was stamped more legibly&#xD;
than lItters could have written it, on the dish-&#xD;
es themselves, and in the style of the numer-&#xD;
ois waiters, by the perfection of every item,&#xD;
and the correctness of the tout ensemble." -&#xD;
Time guests, although numerous for a coun-&#xD;
try ball, could each find a seat at this princely&#xD;
table, where the Emperor Napoleon Bonaparte&#xD;
presided at one head of it, and the tailor's&#xD;
daughter at the other. Our hero found him-&#xD;
self seated between Josephine Van Strom and&#xD;
Jessie Going. These young ladies had known&#xD;
each other for some time, and conversed freely&#xD;
across his plate, which situation he enjoyed im-&#xD;
mensely, drawing elaborate parallels between&#xD;
them in the privacy of his own thoughts. The&#xD;
influence of Miss Jessie's sweet presence Was&#xD;
Over him, and could he, then and there, have&#xD;
had the privilege of choosing his life's partner,&#xD;
&#xD;
he would have discarded the heart full of pas-&#xD;
sionate love and unqualified devotion, and taken&#xD;
the one not yet proven by the fiery test of life's&#xD;
great struggles, not yet in condition for one to&#xD;
coufidentlysay of it, that it was good, noble, and&#xD;
faithful.&#xD;
The wine began to circulate freely, and as&#xD;
it disappeared, glass by glass, and bottle by&#xD;
bottle, it came again to view in the suddenly&#xD;
flushed faces and sparkling eyes. To some of&#xD;
the guests, the decanters and dishes, the pyra-&#xD;
mids of confectionery, and bouquets of flowers,&#xD;
began to lose their distinctive shades, and&#xD;
stagger around the table as if they, and not&#xD;
the gentlemen, were intoxicated. Laughter&#xD;
grew louder and more unmeaning.   Conver-&#xD;
sation became a medley in which each speaker&#xD;
listened only to himself, and the noise and donfu-&#xD;
sion grew louder and higher. There was  any&#xD;
a wanton leer in that array of faces, and. eyes&#xD;
were glowing in the misty heat of wine. The&#xD;
manner of well-drilled waiters is a fair criterion&#xD;
by which to estimate the condition of the guests.&#xD;
As the latter become noisy and clamorous for a&#xD;
score of things which are not touched when&#xD;
received, they become more mechanical, more&#xD;
respectful, more decorous, and more thorough-&#xD;
ly blind to the follies of their superiors.&#xD;
The revelry increased. There were many&#xD;
country gentlemen present, who had inherited&#xD;
the hard heads of their Dutch ancestors with&#xD;
their appetites, and who did not object to deep&#xD;
potations on an occasion like this, and their&#xD;
willing competitors were some that young men&#xD;
from New York. You fast young men of New&#xD;
York I It is you, of high-bred families and&#xD;
low-bred tastes, it is you that a City Recorder&#xD;
alluded to, when he said from his bench of&#xD;
justice: "Thhere is a class of young men in&#xD;
this city who vie with each other in setting at&#xD;
defiance alike the laws of God Iand man."&#xD;
The atmosphere of the room was growing&#xD;
thick, and the lights turned red and assumed&#xD;
the shapes of drunken goblins imprisoned in&#xD;
the glass-chimneys of the lamps, where before&#xD;
were seen only the patient tongues of flame.&#xD;
The genial- Goildess of Plenty exhausted, gave&#xD;
place to the Demon of Debauch, incarnate in&#xD;
the person of Mr. Paradise, who now rose- to&#xD;
make an address.   It was witty, vile, and&#xD;
reckless, in all its bearing upon subjects of re-&#xD;
finemnt, and it was the signal for the revelry&#xD;
to degenerate into a bacchanalian orgy.&#xD;
John Van Strom's seat was next his wife.&#xD;
So far he had behaved well, although all Bella's&#xD;
efforts and entreaties to restrain him from&#xD;
drinking to excess had been of no avail. He&#xD;
was all smiles and tenderness for her; but&#xD;
nothing would keep him from excess. Follow-&#xD;
ing .Josephine, who thought it high time for&#xD;
the ladies to retire, they all arose, but John&#xD;
kept his wife at his side. She looked at him.&#xD;
All his good-humor was gone.&#xD;
"You stay where you are," hp muttered,&#xD;
gruffly.&#xD;
That gaze told her the truth. His eyes were&#xD;
bloodshot. The expression of his face un-&#xD;
speakably drunken, and, more than this; for,&#xD;
when Bella huimbly took her seat again, at his&#xD;
command, she knew that her husband was a&#xD;
raving maniac, ready to show it at any moment.&#xD;

Many gentlemen, among whom were Mr.&#xD;
Going and our hero, followed the ladies, who&#xD;
either loitered about the hall or sent for their&#xD;
shawls and strolled about the grounds and&#xD;
gardens on the side of the house opposite the&#xD;
fatal bell.&#xD;
.  Whither are you bound, Mr. Montant ?"&#xD;
asked Miss Jessie Going, as she passed our&#xD;
hero on his way to join Josephine Van Strom.&#xD;
"I am going to join- " Miss Jessie guessed&#xD;
the state of the case, and interposed artlessly:&#xD;
"I have something to tell you. Will you&#xD;
wait here, while I go up-stairs and get my&#xD;
shawl ?"&#xD;
He hesitated. There was a queer enticing&#xD;
smile on her face.&#xD;
:. Certainly," he said, and Miss Going swept&#xD;
proudly up-stairs as if she had done something&#xD;
great, and fully conscious of having " cut out "&#xD;
the widow. The latter, being near enough to&#xD;
hear the dialogue, showed her appreciation of&#xD;
the incident by turning her back very deci-&#xD;
sively, while le bit his lips and felt vexed with&#xD;
her, Miss Going, and himself.&#xD;
In a few moments the young lady tripped&#xD;
up to him, enveloped in a shawl, and took his&#xD;
arm without ceremony.&#xD;
"iWhat can you have to say to me, Mademoi-&#xD;
selle ?" asked Montaut, when they had stepped&#xD;
out upon the piazza and were marching up and&#xD;
down sedately.&#xD;
"The weather has changed. What has be-&#xD;
come of the moon, I wonder?" said the young&#xD;
lady.&#xD;
" Is that all? What an interesting remark&#xD;
that is, Miss Going!"&#xD;
"I did wish to see you about something,"&#xD;
said she, with a certain levity of tone which&#xD;
displeased him, " but I have really forgotten&#xD;
what it wvas about."&#xD;
iDo you know," he said, gravely, "that you&#xD;
are too much inclined to tread the path of life&#xD;
lightly? After your good sense prompts you&#xD;
to think and act with that sincerity and firm-&#xD;
ness of which you are capable, you are liable,&#xD;
the very next moment, to destroy what you&#xD;
have so well begun."&#xD;
"Have I shown myself in that light to&#xD;
you ?"&#xD;
"" Yes."&#xD;
"And may I ask when and in what way ?"&#xD;
Our hero seemed puzzled. He did not wish&#xD;
to upbraid her for ignoring him and devoting&#xD;
herself to Messrs. Faro and Willie.Wheeler,&#xD;
at that dinner in Fifth Avenue, immediately&#xD;
after having appealed so strongly to him to be&#xD;
her friend forever, and exacted, almost forcibly,&#xD;
a very serious promise from him. lie did not&#xD;
wish to let her know that he thought her in-&#xD;
considerate as well as too light-hearted, and&#xD;
he said, impatiently.-&#xD;
"With your permission we will change the&#xD;
subject."&#xD;
Jessie Going probably knew well enough&#xD;
to what her companion had referred, in his&#xD;
thoughts, and there ensued a somewhat em&#xD;
barassing pause.&#xD;
"What do you think of Mrs. Van Strom,'&#xD;
she asked, after awhile.&#xD;
" I think she is a splendid, nole-hearted(&#xD;
woman, who has not merited her sad trials&#xD;
&#xD;
I think she is one of the few who ask from the&#xD;
world, nothing but love and sympathy, and&#xD;
who would rather die for a friend than injure&#xD;
him."&#xD;
Miss Jessie bit her lips. She was beginning&#xD;
to understand that this foreigner did not intend&#xD;
to be a plaything for a girl's whims, and though&#xD;
conscious of her power over him, as all women&#xD;
are to some extent, she was a little bit afraid&#xD;
of him. That speech about Josephine con-&#xD;
tained a rebuke which he did not care to con-&#xD;
teal, and it stung her to the quick.&#xD;
" Perhaps you would prefer to join the lady&#xD;
who seems so to excite your enthusiasm," she&#xD;
said, languidly.&#xD;
"As you wish, mademoiselle," he replied,&#xD;
coldly. "I am at your service during your&#xD;
good pleasure."&#xD;
" Then let us go in, for the night is too damp&#xD;
to be pleasant."&#xD;
These were the last words they exchanged&#xD;
that evening, and, as he left her to the society&#xD;
of Mr. Fatman, in the hall, and she turned her&#xD;
back upon hin as if he had been a perfect&#xD;
stranger, a great bitterness surged up and&#xD;
filled his heart.&#xD;
CHAPTER IX.&#xD;
WhAT THE OLD BELL MEANT BY RINGING. -&#xD;
"Hear it not, Duncan, for It is a knell&#xD;
Which summons thee to heaven or to hell.'&#xD;
MAc1iaTr.&#xD;
IT took but a minute for our hero to find and&#xD;
join Mrs. Van  Strom, and  soon they were&#xD;
walking in the grounds, and strolling through&#xD;
the flower-garden, with its graveled walks and&#xD;
artistic box-hiedges.&#xD;
She took his arm, and, after a few minutes&#xD;
conversation, every trace of jealousy left her.&#xD;
It is true that she had angrily turned her back&#xD;
upon him, when a simple word from Miss&#xD;
Going had proven sufficient to keep him from&#xD;
her side, and what woman would not have done&#xD;
so? But when, after a very short walk widli&#xD;
her, he returned, and as she now held posses-&#xD;
sion of him, and he addressed her as waraly&#xD;
and devotedly as over, she forgot all but her&#xD;
great love for him, and what woman would&#xD;
have done otherwise?&#xD;
Miss Going's remark on the weather, was&#xD;
none the less true for its 'want of originality.&#xD;
The heavens had darkened and the feeling of&#xD;
rain was in the air. It was a warni night. and&#xD;
though the moon had veiled her face, there,&#xD;
were millions of glow worms astir in the&#xD;
shrubbery, swarming to and fro in sparkling&#xD;
affection, finding each other by the light of&#xD;
love.. The air resounded with the lively, never-&#xD;
tiring chorus of katy-dids, and out-doors&#xD;
seemed the workshop of legions of dwarfish&#xD;
spirits, each busy in his peculiar way, glitter-&#xD;
ing, chirping, working  with indefatigable&#xD;
- energy, concocting magical wonders in Nature.&#xD;
There !  a streak  of lightning.  A another I&#xD;
The insects fly about in excitement, the katy-&#xD;
dids join afresh in a grand allegro, as if te&#xD;
master were approaching and the little people&#xD;
.were hurried in their work.&#xD;
&#xD;
The music in the hall ceased, the fiddles&#xD;
lay on the little platform unmolested, for the&#xD;
darkeys were -walking into the good things&#xD;
that had been undemolished by the guests.&#xD;
Occasionally a peal of laughter, a boisterous&#xD;
speech-makers voice, a round of cheers. or a&#xD;
confusion of wanton sound, broke upon the ears&#xD;
of the two strollers, disturbing their serene&#xD;
enjoyment of the most enchanting of nights,&#xD;
alive with all the creatures of a midsummer&#xD;
night's dream.&#xD;
"What a wondrous, magic scene," said&#xD;
Josephine. "How distorted, almost unrecog-&#xD;
nizable, these familiar objects around us ap-&#xD;
pear.-&#xD;
"Something is in the wind," said -he,&#xD;
absently.&#xD;
"Yes; and who knows what the next hour&#xD;
may bring to any of us ? This grand house&#xD;
may be struck by lightning, and a circle of&#xD;
corpses confront each other in ghastly silence&#xD;
around the table, where they are now chal-&#xD;
lenging the justice of Heaven by their reckless&#xD;
.debauch. And, should the storm burst forth,&#xD;
they would still remain there in drunken defi-&#xD;
ance of its dread powers."&#xD;
" This is a strange but pertinent fancy of&#xD;
yours, Mrs. Van Strom," he answered, gloom-&#xD;
ily. " Were their eyes -opened, this moment,&#xD;
they would recognize grim death beneath each&#xD;
others' masks of joviality, and with horror they&#xD;
would see that the skeleton is growing in size&#xD;
and strength with every glass they empty."&#xD;
"Why do men drink?"     asked Josephine,&#xD;
sadly. "My experience of its effects on the&#xD;
best and most generous of natures is so sor-&#xD;
rowful that I hate the very sight of wine."&#xD;
'Naturally.  But your question    applies&#xD;
equally to all the sins committed here below,&#xD;
which are permitted that the righteous may be&#xD;
separated from the vicious in the sight of God&#xD;
and roan.  These sins are generally an out-&#xD;
growth of refinement and luxury. Excess is the&#xD;
name for them, and moderation is the great&#xD;
virtue. I do not believe in total abstinence."&#xD;
"Why are not all men like you ?" said&#xD;
Josephine, warmly.&#xD;
SBecause, said he, smiling, "they have&#xD;
not all been thrown upon their resources early&#xD;
enough, or under such circumstances as to&#xD;
force them to cultivate habitual caution, self-&#xD;
restraint, and firmness of will. Early indul-&#xD;
gence breaks their strength of mind, and when&#xD;
the time comes that they need to rely upon&#xD;
it, it shows itself rotten at tihe core."&#xD;
"Could wiu--would you love beyond self.&#xD;
control, without reservation, unconditionally,&#xD;
and i'nrnoderatelypr"&#xD;
It Was a queer question, and her tone and&#xD;
manner on asking it were queerer.  Hesita-&#xD;
tingly', timidly, but breathlessly waiting for his&#xD;
answer.&#xD;
"I do not know. A$ far as my experience&#xD;
goes--ino."&#xD;
"Look at the fire-flies," saidJosephmine, dream-&#xD;
ily. "Ordinary affections resemble their tiny&#xD;
flickering lights. They illuminate for an instant&#xD;
the dark corners of the foliage around us, fly&#xD;
fro  spot to spot, staying inone, lighting up&#xD;
lhevdffrent places they are in for the time,&#xD;
btlaete entire scene in darkness.  So&#xD;
&#xD;
36&#xD;
&#xD;
with the recesses of the human heart until the&#xD;
great light comes like a flash; yes, like that&#xD;
flash of lightning which has just darted its&#xD;
livid flame around, illuminating the whole scene,&#xD;
the whole heart."&#xD;
" Ard sometimes, too, brings death."&#xD;
"Yes. And when it does, God pity the&#xD;
sufferers."&#xD;
" And you ask me whether I could love as&#xD;
you say ?"&#xD;
"Yes," murmured Josephine.    "Tell me&#xD;
whether you can so love. Here in the sight&#xD;
of nature, in its mysterious workings ; here in&#xD;
the sight of all its majesty, in the presence of&#xD;
the spirit that governs this hour, tell me if you&#xD;
can."&#xD;
There was a solemn appeal in these words,&#xD;
not in accordance with her naturally enthu-&#xD;
siastic, but timid character. Our hero helt it,&#xD;
and all-at once the scales fell from his eyes,&#xD;
Like a shock, the knowledge, the conviction,&#xD;
came to him, and almost overpowered him.&#xD;
Yes, he now knew that she loved him, he felt&#xD;
it in the throbbing of her heart as she clung&#xD;
closely to his arma, he felt it in the trembling of&#xD;
her arm which clung to him as if for life, lie&#xD;
heard it in that passionate voice, and he saw&#xD;
it even through the darkness in the wonderful&#xD;
glow of her languishing eyes. With a great&#xD;
effort he gathered his best, his strongest, his&#xD;
purest impulses, and the integrity of his&#xD;
character was prominent in his reply.&#xD;
" I think I can so love. But I do not think&#xD;
it will come to me as a flash; but rather like&#xD;
the dawn of day which is heralded by a&#xD;
faint and struggling ray, to grow by nature's&#xD;
almighty laws, slowly -but surely, into the&#xD;
bright and overwheming beauty of tienoon-&#xD;
day. That light, Mrs. Van Strom, will not&#xD;
suddenly vanihm into the darkness whence it&#xD;
sprang, like your lightning, but it will remain,&#xD;
grand and omnipotent, till the close of life's&#xD;
day, when the night cometh, and we can bid&#xD;
it farewell contentedly.&#xD;
"Let it come as it may," cried Josephine,&#xD;
passionately ; '"but when it has come," and she&#xD;
pulled her arm from him and pressed both&#xD;
hands on her tempestuous heart, "there is no&#xD;
power in heaven or earth that can control it."&#xD;
In a state of agitation heretofore totally un-&#xD;
known to him, he took a step toward her. The&#xD;
lightning's brilhiant glare showed her to him, as&#xD;
she stood with her hands on her breast and her&#xD;
face upturned to him--the face of Raphael's&#xD;
Madonna. Reader, if you desire a superhuman&#xD;
hero, close the book here. Our hero was&#xD;
human, and, at this moment, all strength of will,&#xD;
all thought of consequences, all scruples, and&#xD;
all presence of mind vanished. His arm was&#xD;
around her; the soft, full, trembling form, as&#xD;
perfect as was ever given to woman, sank into&#xD;
his embrace and she sought, instead of re-&#xD;
sisting, the passionate kiss which affianced&#xD;
them.&#xD;
Upon a friendly garden bench, they sat in&#xD;
tender embrace, lost in the intoxication of love.&#xD;
The fire-flies peeped at them, and flew back to&#xD;
their mates in the bushes to tell them what they&#xD;
saw. The katy-dids struck up the old love&#xD;
song, telling time world what the world knows&#xD;
very well; yet, is anxious to learn again, a&#xD;

seemed to rule the summer night with loving&#xD;
sway, as though great " Nature rejoicedin the&#xD;
bliss of two of her noblest children."&#xD;
Called back to a sense of fleeting time, they&#xD;
sauntered back to the house, she lost in him&#xD;
and delirious with happiness; he proud, and&#xD;
joyously excited, and already making plans for&#xD;
the future, and trying to foresee the possible&#xD;
ends of this night work.&#xD;
They found the piazza deserted, and took&#xD;
the opportunity for a long, parting kiss, and as&#xD;
he held her tightly to his breast, feeling every&#xD;
pulsation of her heart vibrating through his&#xD;
frame, she whispered softly,-&#xD;
" Ernest, darling, tell me, once more before&#xD;
we part, do you love me with all your heart?"&#xD;
The words seemed to stick in his throat,&#xD;
but he would not hesitate, could not be so cruel&#xD;
as to say "no " to her at this moment were it&#xD;
the greatest lie of his life.&#xD;
"I love you, indeed I love you 1"  And&#xD;
though at a later day, when, in cold blood he&#xD;
reviews that speech, conscience might tell&#xD;
him he had lied to her, yet when he spoke the&#xD;
words, and received his reward, he thought&#xD;
he had spoken the truth.&#xD;
When they entered the hall, the scene they&#xD;
beheld startled them considerably. Many had&#xD;
gone home, the ladies that were left. wrapped&#xD;
in their shawls and cloaks were huddled in a&#xD;
corner. Most of the gentlemen, with their&#xD;
hats in their hands, kept close by them as if&#xD;
for their protection, and in thecenter of the room&#xD;
John Van Strom was dancing a sort of pus de&#xD;
deux with his wife. She kept a steady, un-&#xD;
flinching gaze upon him, dancing as little as&#xD;
possible, moving closely to him like a snake-&#xD;
charmer, for at this moment John was a manic&#xD;
on the verge of raving violence.&#xD;
Mr Paradise, the hunchback, was applaud-&#xD;
ing with a shrill voice. and looked like an in-&#xD;
sane fiend, striving with Pella for the mastery&#xD;
over this weak intellect, while some intoxicated&#xD;
fools were laughing and dancing about the&#xD;
group, and the Cimmerian Quaternion were&#xD;
fiddling away with accompanying contortions,&#xD;
"'Twas a scene from a madhouse."&#xD;
"Dance, gentlemen," roared John, his voice&#xD;
rising above the tumult.  "Why the devil&#xD;
don't you dance. Who won't dance ?"&#xD;
With a shriek and a rush John was left in&#xD;
the center of a wide open space, were his&#xD;
grinning admirers had just stood. his clothes&#xD;
torn, his hair disheveled, his face distorted, and&#xD;
his eyes on fire, brandishing the naked broad-&#xD;
sword once worthily wielded by his grandsire,&#xD;
and bellowing like a wild beast.&#xD;
" Who won't dance?  Show me the fellow.&#xD;
I'll have his blood I I'll have his blood any&#xD;
way I"&#xD;
And there stood his wife, the color all gone&#xD;
from her face, within reach of his weapon.&#xD;
The drunken musicians played faster and faster&#xD;
their fiddles squeaking, tittering, and shriek-&#xD;
ing as though hell had set loose a band of&#xD;
howling devils.&#xD;
"Stop those crazy fools," some one at length&#xD;
cried, and when it was done a dead silence&#xD;
prevailed, broken only by the heavy breathing&#xD;
&#xD;
blessing of oblivion on his distracted brain,&#xD;
and the bonds of sleep on his boiling veins.&#xD;
The old butler, sitting, at his bedside, thinks&#xD;
of the great changes he has seen in the family,&#xD;
and of his dead master. and weeps bitterly.&#xD;
And peeping through another window.she&#xD;
sees the wife of low degree pacing the room.&#xD;
Her wound is not severe, but its pain and the&#xD;
excitement of the evening have kept her from&#xD;
her bed. She is planning out the future&#xD;
bravely, and only sobs when the present dis-&#xD;
tress comes to her mind overwhelmingly.&#xD;
And below stairs there lies the. old man's'&#xD;
body, stark and stiff, for him the patient moon&#xD;
hides her face, and the pitying clouds drop&#xD;
tears again.&#xD;
Josephine has done her part nobly. She&#xD;
&#xD;
of the maniac as he stood rolling his eyes&#xD;
around the room, trying to choose a victim.&#xD;
Bella approached him fearlessly.&#xD;
"For God's sake, don't;" said some, trying&#xD;
to keep her back.&#xD;
"If any one has to die by those hands it&#xD;
must be I," was the answer. Then she said,&#xD;
firmly.&#xD;
"John, give me that sword I"&#xD;
But it was too late. The wine had intense.&#xD;
fled him to a paroxysm of fury which defied&#xD;
restraint.  A cry was heard as the sword&#xD;
flashed through the air, and the bleeding form&#xD;
of the faithful wife sank to the floor.&#xD;
Though wounded, she clung to him tightly,&#xD;
and he, maddened still more by the sight of&#xD;
blood, was raging and tearing himself from&#xD;
her grasp, when a little man coolly stepped up&#xD;
behind him, and catching one of his feet, quickly&#xD;
upset him on the floor. It was our acquaint-&#xD;
ance, Antonio Stilletto, and now, yes, now, the&#xD;
gentlemen rushed to his assistance, and John&#xD;
was secured.&#xD;
Then came the senseless chatter of "what&#xD;
a dreadful thing ;" ".perfectly shocking ;" "he&#xD;
ought to be kept in an asylum;" "poor thing,"&#xD;
she's dead ;" " what a pity ;" " what a shame&#xD;
that he should be at large," &amp;amp;c., &amp;amp;c., ad nac'-&#xD;
seam; but what was that crowd in the corner?&#xD;
Was there to be another horror to mark this&#xD;
eventful night?  Was it a visitation on the&#xD;
family, some curse, the fulfillment of sofne&#xD;
dark prophecy, an atonement for some hidden&#xD;
crime ?  What was it they were carrying out&#xD;
so carefully, from the place where it had&#xD;
fallen, unperceived in the great excitement.&#xD;
It was dressed in the costume of the great&#xD;
emperor, but the wig had slipped off. It was&#xD;
the body of old John Jacob Van Strom, killed&#xD;
by a stroke of apoplexy.&#xD;
It had grown late when those guests left&#xD;
the Priory, and they were in a far different&#xD;
mood than when they had come. When the&#xD;
last of the carriages rolled away, a gentle rain&#xD;
was falling as though heaven would wash away&#xD;
the traces of that night's doings. As the merci-&#xD;
ful drops rustle through the weeping willows&#xD;
and through the park, the wind sighs in the&#xD;
trees, shaking their heads over the hurrying&#xD;
coaches; there is many a man on whom the&#xD;
voice of Heaven, which called so suddenly&#xD;
upon Van Strom, has not been lost, and many&#xD;
a disconcerted face, many a compressed lip,&#xD;
tells of an uneasy conscience and a heavy&#xD;
heart.            .&#xD;
And when the last sound of the departing&#xD;
wheels has died away, the moon breaks&#xD;
through the clouds and looks down upon the&#xD;
house of death, with the willows weeping in&#xD;
front of it, and the old bell tolling a funeral&#xD;
chime. The house lies dark and cold as though&#xD;
hung in crape for the death of its master, and&#xD;
the tire-flies shine no more, and the k aty-dids&#xD;
are mute. And the moon looked within the&#xD;
house and peeped curiously around the cbam-&#xD;
ber where but lately license held high carnival.&#xD;
The rats were undisturbed in their disputing&#xD;
over the remnants of the, feast, and the instrl'-&#xD;
ments of music were lying, still and dumb,&#xD;
on the little platform. ~And in another rootS&#xD;
she saw the form of a shattered man, with the&#xD;
&#xD;
wept at first, wept on the breast of the man&#xD;
who will give strength and comfort to her in&#xD;
all her future trials, and then rose and took&#xD;
the head of the household, helping here, direct-&#xD;
ing there, and working wherever work was to&#xD;
be done.&#xD;
Now she sleeps, and, smiling in her sleep,&#xD;
dreams but the one sweet dream, while her&#xD;
lover watches the body of John Jacob Van&#xD;
Strom, till broad day.&#xD;
And at last the moon sends a parting glance&#xD;
at the desolate house and sinks to rest. The&#xD;
old bell rings no more, though the morning&#xD;
breezes are coming merrily along.  They can&#xD;
not awaken the ghost, the bell finds no life in&#xD;
their fresh breaths, for they herald a dawning&#xD;
day which will bring a change over the Priory.&#xD;
&#xD;
" And so I will, my lad," answered the old&#xD;
man, staring vacantly into the air from his&#xD;
high stool, where lie was perched, as usual. in&#xD;
a confusion of angles. " Wait till we find an&#xD;
unoccupied evening, a quiet room, some good&#xD;
beef, and a respectable jug of ale., My wants&#xD;
have been modified to a charming simplicity in&#xD;
the course of my life."&#xD;
" And yet you can not deny that you are still&#xD;
extravagant in some matters," answered Mon-&#xD;
tant, eagerly-" the poor call you princely in&#xD;
your charities, and I heard an old woman say&#xD;
you were the best and kindest man that ever&#xD;
lived."&#xD;
"No more on this subject," said Martin&#xD;
Bates, hurriedly, and blushing all over his sal-&#xD;
low face. ' It belongs to the Lord of Heaven,&#xD;
alone, with all its pro's and con's."&#xD;
Our hero looked up ini astonishment at his&#xD;
unnecessary vehemence, and equivocal lan-&#xD;
guage. He could not imagine what the old&#xD;
fellow meant, so like a wise man, he held his&#xD;
tongue. Through the open window the tedi-&#xD;
ous strains of a hand-organ broke jarringly on&#xD;
their ears. Martin Bates looked up. his face&#xD;
flushed again; this time with expectation. The&#xD;
door opened and in came one of those Italian&#xD;
girls who are a distinct, and not over-respect-&#xD;
able part of the city's manifold population.&#xD;
She was pretty, might have reached the age of&#xD;
seventeen antidher neatness and evident modes-&#xD;
ty presented an agreeable contrast to the rest&#xD;
of her class.&#xD;
Ernest Montant had seen her on many pro-&#xD;
vious occasions, and withdrew, as usual, leaving&#xD;
her alone with old Martin hBttes, who was her&#xD;
friend and protector. It did not astonish any&#xD;
one that they conversed in a whisper nor that&#xD;
Martin caine to the cash drawer, and got a&#xD;
twenty dollar bill, which he gave to the girl.&#xD;
This had happened before, and, just as before,&#xD;
nobody knew what to make of it.&#xD;

CHAPTER I.&#xD;
MARTIN BATES.&#xD;
"Soe sins do bear their privilege on earth."&#xD;
Km s Joas&#xD;
" Yxe young man, thirty years in this office !&#xD;
No wonder that every one knows old Martin&#xD;
Bates; but a great wonder that so few people&#xD;
speak ill of him. Long in the service, sir, and&#xD;
prepared to die in it."&#xD;
And had he not one foot already on the&#xD;
verge of the grave ? Several bunches of white&#xD;
hair hung around his well-nigh bald head, and&#xD;
as he sat perched upon his high stool, there&#xD;
u-as a cadaverous look about him. His high&#xD;
cheek bones protruded in sharp angles, each&#xD;
overlooked by a very light-colored. unexpress-&#xD;
ive eye  Martin's single fault was chewing&#xD;
tobace , and he had a very peculiar way of&#xD;
rolling his quid into his right cheek whenever&#xD;
he entered a "credit" item in his books, then,&#xD;
with a frightful grimace, rolling it back again&#xD;
to the left side when he wrote a "debit."  If&#xD;
Mr. Going wished to know whether money&#xD;
was Cminiug in or going out of the house, he&#xD;
had only to look at his head cashier, old Mar-&#xD;
tin Bates, and observe the protuberance on&#xD;
the cheek of that gentleman's square face.&#xD;
"Thirty years winh Going &amp;amp; Son 1 An errand&#xD;
boy under Walter's grandfather and slowly&#xD;
riig to be the head of the outer office. Do&#xD;
l expect to become a partner? No, sir ! Mar-&#xD;
tin Bates was born to ill-luck, and Fortune has&#xD;
kicked him and snarled at him all his life."&#xD;
The old cashier had taken a great fancy to&#xD;
Our hero, and often, after the members of the&#xD;
firm had gone home, lie would talk to Ernest&#xD;
Montant, who liked him for his good-natured&#xD;
but melancholy originality.&#xD;
You have often promised to tell me of&#xD;
your past life, Mr. Bates," said our hero.&#xD;

FACT.&#xD;
&#xD;
Weeks rolled on, and Mr. Going had the old&#xD;
Priory put in complete repair, and then the&#xD;
whole family moved out there to spend the&#xD;
summer in their newly-acquired property. The&#xD;
house in Fifth Avenue was closed and became&#xD;
a subject of speculation for the burglars of the&#xD;
city. Weeks rolled on, the business did not&#xD;
prosper as it should, heavy losses had to be&#xD;
met and old Martin Bates chewed his tobacco&#xD;
on the credit side of his face, with a determin-&#xD;
ed air, and an occasional scowl. The Italian&#xD;
girl continued her visits and received so many&#xD;
twenty-dollar bills that Montant wondered at&#xD;
the amount of the cashier's salary which could&#xD;
warrant such liberality. But then Martin&#xD;
Bates was the managing clerk, and with his&#xD;
modest personal wants, he could afford it with-&#xD;
out a doubt. His preference for our hero in-&#xD;
creased, and the latter asked himself with&#xD;
wonder how it was that the best, the kindest&#xD;
people so courted his friendship. It is true&#xD;
that he had enemies. Stilletto did not like him,&#xD;
Solomons, the Jew broker, never spoke to him&#xD;
as he did to the rest of the clerks, and Mr. Fat-&#xD;
man ignored him in a marked manner, when&#xD;
they happened to encounter each other; but&#xD;
these men and others, belonged to those who&#xD;
had themselves impressed him with dislike, and&#xD;
he could easily imagine that something in his&#xD;
own manner, incapable of hypocrisy as he was,&#xD;
had  prevented any approach to cordiality.&#xD;
And, again, Miss Jessie Going had not treated&#xD;
him quite satisfactorily-but had he not the&#xD;
lore of Josephine Van Strom?&#xD;
Weeks rolled on, and one evening we find&#xD;
Martin Bates and Ernest Montant at the club"&#xD;
of the former  Not a fashionable club. Oh,&#xD;
no 1 The roast beef was excellent, the ale capi-&#xD;
tal and a good old Engl;sh cheer prevailed&#xD;
through this retreat for cricketers and English&#xD;
clerks, who here could almost fancy themselves&#xD;
away from New York and once more within&#xD;
the sound of Bow-bells.&#xD;
" English filberts, my boy I" said Martin,&#xD;
"and some very respectable port. Take plenty&#xD;
of the nuts, they make your plate look cheer-&#xD;
ful. But what are you doing?   Why, man,&#xD;
you must scrape them carefully with that silver&#xD;
knife until they are as smooth and white as in-&#xD;
nocence itself. There is a soul in a filbert, a&#xD;
true British soul, if you only know how to find&#xD;
it under the rough rind."&#xD;
Then Ishouldcall some Englishmenflberti,"&#xD;
said Ernest, smiling, carefully peeling one of&#xD;
the nuts.&#xD;
True enoughl" said Martin Bates, " Al-&#xD;
though I would rather undertake to peel a&#xD;
filbert than some of my countrymen. Perhaps&#xD;
even that beast called the world has a heart&#xD;
under its snarling exterior; but heaven knows&#xD;
I have never found it out. And now let us&#xD;
hive another bottle of port and I will tell you&#xD;
a few brief incidents of my life which I have&#xD;
never mentioned, although I have often wanted&#xD;
to tell them to some one."&#xD;
The waiter was a German, who tried to press&#xD;
himself off as an Englishman by duly dropping&#xD;
his h's, adding them where they did not belong,&#xD;
andl interspersing his few words with "sir,"&#xD;
with a liberality which outshone all the waiters&#xD;
of Pickwick. Having dismissed this wor thy&#xD;
&#xD;
Anglo-Saxon, Martin Bates related the following&#xD;
story:-&#xD;
"I am the younger son of an English gen-&#xD;
tleman, who lived upon a more ancient than&#xD;
valuable estate, not many hours from London.&#xD;
My' elder-'brother, Ebenezer Bates, the heir of-&#xD;
my father's little fortune, the pet of the house,&#xD;
the pride of the family, became a lawyer, say-&#xD;
ing that wealth could not warrant his idleness.&#xD;
He is a proud, cold man, a strict Protestant, a&#xD;
pillar of the church, bearing a spotless char-&#xD;
acter and standing high in the community."&#xD;
Martin Bates spoke the last words with&#xD;
scarce concealed bitterness. He paused a mo-&#xD;
ment to compose his feelings and tien pro-&#xD;
ceeded.-&#xD;
" I grew up, an impetuous boy, ready at&#xD;
any moment for a game of cricket, for a foot-&#xD;
race. a frolic, or a fight, and my father reluc-&#xD;
tantly acceded to my importunity and purchased&#xD;
me a commission in the British army. The&#xD;
world smiled on Martin Bates then, my debts&#xD;
were paid by my brother who raised the funds&#xD;
for rue without my father's knowledge. I&#xD;
thanked him, and yet I could not love him for&#xD;
it."&#xD;
"Why ?"&#xD;
"lBecause he accompanied each gift with a&#xD;
scowl and a sermon. lie had no consideration,&#xD;
no sympathy for me, and I saw, only too&#xD;
plainly, that it was just his selfish pride which&#xD;
prompted him to save the family name from&#xD;
disgrace, not brotherly love."&#xD;
" Mr. Bates," said Ernest, "did you never&#xD;
meet men who, considering themselves mc-h&#xD;
injured by the harsh opinions of the world,&#xD;
nevertheless judged others as harshly?  After&#xD;
all, your brother seems to have acted toward&#xD;
you in a manner which would ordinarily call&#xD;
for-"&#xD;
" Let me finish," interrupted the other.&#xD;
heaven knows, he owes all his grand posi-&#xD;
tion and good name to those kind acts. I only&#xD;
gave him credit for them. I never balanced&#xD;
any gratitude by such reflections as have forced&#xD;
themselves upon me at a much later period,&#xD;
and, when the time came, I sacrificed myself&#xD;
to save him."&#xD;
"Now listen. My brother Eben and I, re-&#xD;
sembled each other to such a degree, that&#xD;
casual acquaintances were apt to mistake our&#xD;
identity. My face is haggard now, While lie is&#xD;
still a handsome man; but you must remem-&#xD;
ber that I have sat on an office-stool like a par-&#xD;
rot in his cage for the past thirty years. con-&#xD;
demned to be a senseless debit and credit&#xD;
machine, while smiling fortune took him to her&#xD;
soft bosom and nursed him to a handsome, and&#xD;
vigorous old age. Thirty years ago he was,&#xD;
rising barrister of Lincoln's Inn Fields, and I&#xD;
exerted my influence among my fellow-officers&#xD;
to bring clients to him."&#xD;
"Among others, I succeeded with my colonel,&#xD;
who soon placed the utmost confidence in hiu.&#xD;
and at whose house he shortly became a wel-&#xD;
come and frequent guest. The colonel was so&#xD;
pleased with him. whom he called, ' a man of&#xD;
rare dignity and integrity of character,' that&#xD;
soumeof his flavor even reached me; and though&#xD;
onily a lieutenant, without a family title. I&#xD;
also was well received at his house. Now&#xD;
&#xD;
41&#xD;
&#xD;
comes the case which shall decide who is the&#xD;
better man. Eben, who has preserved his 'rare&#xD;
dignity and integrity' to this day, in the eyes&#xD;
of the world, or poor old Martin, disgraced,&#xD;
discarded, and condemned to the pillory of an&#xD;
otlice-stool, for such would I have regarded it&#xD;
thirty years ago when I was a gentleman, and&#xD;
an officer."&#xD;
Martin Bates paused, and wiped away the&#xD;
perspiration from his square forehead. He&#xD;
had already imbibed freely, and now poured&#xD;
down several glasses of port-wine, like a man&#xD;
who feels suddenly weak and needs a stimu-&#xD;
lus.&#xD;
' The colonel's wife, Lady - , belonged to&#xD;
one of those proud families in England that are&#xD;
descended from some king's left-handed marri-&#xD;
age, and feel highly honored by such a record.&#xD;
She was a handsome woman, though already&#xD;
past that bloom of life which ever alone could&#xD;
attract me. I rather admired her for her re-&#xD;
finement and dignity; but not a word even of&#xD;
intimacy ever passed between us.&#xD;
" Itogine my surprise, when, one morning&#xD;
I was placed under arrest, then in close con-&#xD;
fiuemneit, and finally summoned before a&#xD;
court-martial !  I was conscious of neither&#xD;
crime nor misdemeanor; but what was my&#xD;
utter consternation when I read the charges&#xD;
preferred against me! I was accused of con-&#xD;
duct unbecoming an officer and a gentleman,&#xD;
in that I had grossly and criminally insulted&#xD;
Litly -  , my colonel's wife. The specifica-&#xD;
tions of the charges related that I was discov-&#xD;
ered one evening in the garden where my lady&#xD;
had been walking, with my arms around her&#xD;
and attempting to kiss lips sacred to the col-&#xD;
onel. Her husband arrived. on the scene-at&#xD;
his approach I had fled-and she, breathless&#xD;
with agitation, stated that she had been as-&#xD;
saulted by an unknown person, and confirmed&#xD;
the statement by going into hysterics. But&#xD;
the colonel had recognized me, not only by my&#xD;
uniform, but by my face! Recognized me&#xD;
with sullicient certainty to be able to swear&#xD;
to my identity.&#xD;
'-At first, I was bewildered, almost to in-&#xD;
sanity-but finally, my boy-finally the truth&#xD;
struck me like a thunderbolt! Yes, the col-&#xD;
ouel had recognized the face, though in the&#xD;
twilight. le had recognized my uniform, and&#xD;
I knew that my brother had borrowed one of&#xD;
mite some months previously for private theatri-&#xD;
cals, and had never returned it. All was now&#xD;
clear. My lady had made a desperate effort at&#xD;
a moment when all seemed lost, and had told&#xD;
a lie to gain time. I saw that this lie would&#xD;
prove successful.  At my court-martial she&#xD;
would not be summoned as a witness, and had&#xD;
I accused my brother, all he had to do was to&#xD;
treat the charge with indignant silence, and&#xD;
fall back on his 'rare dignity and integrity of&#xD;
character.' My lady had only to perjure her-&#xD;
self anid who could doubt that the charge&#xD;
would return to me with crushing weight."&#xD;
" Perjure herself I" cried our hero. "Would&#xD;
she have  dared to do that?    Could  she&#xD;
have unflinchingly faced a cross-examina-&#xD;
tion ?"&#xD;
- 'Cross-examination!I" exclaimed Martin&#xD;
Bates, with a sneer. " How extremely verdant&#xD;
&#xD;
you must be ! Don't you remember she was&#xD;
Lady       ? Do you suppose that in Eng-&#xD;
land ladyships are bantered on a witness-stand&#xD;
like kitchen-maids? And as to her willing.&#xD;
ness to perjure herself, what else could she&#xD;
have done ? Here was her own and her&#xD;
husband's name in'the scale against a junior&#xD;
officer's honor; could there be a question that&#xD;
the occasion demanded a lie? I may be mis-&#xD;
taken, but I felt myself lost, and accepted my&#xD;
doom with as good a grace as possible."&#xD;
"And your brother ?"&#xD;
"He visited me once. I can see him now,&#xD;
as he stood in my cell. His handsome face,&#xD;
austere and grandly dignified as ever, until the&#xD;
turnkey had left us alone. Then he wept, and&#xD;
begged my pardon-d-n him I"&#xD;
There was a hardness in his voice that did&#xD;
not please his listener.&#xD;
If he repented, and felt for you-"&#xD;
" Repeated and felt for me " cried Martin&#xD;
Bates, furiously. "le was dismayed at the&#xD;
dishonor which I was sure to bring upon his&#xD;
name; he was trembling with the weight of&#xD;
his guilty conscience, afraid lest I should at-&#xD;
tempt to show the truth to the world ; he was&#xD;
bent upon securing my self-sacriilce by his&#xD;
damnable show of remorse and sympathy.&#xD;
He confessed the intrigue, swore that that&#xD;
meeting in the garden was to be their last;&#xD;
that he was engaged to be married to a sweet&#xD;
girl, whose heart would break if he were dis-&#xD;
covered, and finally-the villain-implored my&#xD;
forgiveness; and yet I know that had I ac-&#xD;
cused him before the bar, he would have sworn,&#xD;
with two fingers uplifted to God, that he was&#xD;
not guilty."&#xD;
Montant   shook  his  head, doubtfully.&#xD;
Martin Bates-took no notice of the gesture;&#xD;
but continued:&#xD;
" I spurned him, telling him that he could&#xD;
not deceive me by his hypocrisy ; but I assured&#xD;
him that he might feel .safe, that I would&#xD;
quietly submit to my fate. I was court-&#xD;
martialed, dishonorably dismissed the service,&#xD;
and drummed out of my regiment." It was a&#xD;
neat ceremony, by God I"&#xD;
His passion almost choked him.&#xD;
" I was a ruined man," he continued,&#xD;
hoarsely. "My friends cut me; no lady would&#xD;
speak to me ; but every one pitied my poor&#xD;
brother I Aye, how kind in him to visit his&#xD;
disgraced brother in prison, and finally to give&#xD;
him money to' go and hide his disgrace in&#xD;
America. And how natural that the sweet&#xD;
girl to whom he was engaged, did not break&#xD;
off the match on my account; but married the&#xD;
kind, the noble-hearted man, with such rare&#xD;
dignity and integrity of character, without&#xD;
heeding what was not his fault-oh, no, not&#xD;
his fault, but only his misfortune-which he&#xD;
regretted sorely, but bore with that equanimity&#xD;
and calmness for which lie was so duly&#xD;
praised.&#xD;
" And when we parted, how edifying was&#xD;
his stately, studied kindness, his condescending&#xD;
sympathy, not unmixed with forbearing re-&#xD;
proach. How different all this from the&#xD;
craven sulbmissiveness with which he threw&#xD;
himself at my feet in the cell, weeping anid&#xD;
Groaning as a miserable sinner should do,-only&#xD;

-What, have you not seen your brother&#xD;
these many years ?"&#xD;
Martin Bates never heard or ignored this ques-&#xD;
tion, and continued, --He is also in this country.&#xD;
Despite all Lady -   's finesse, some queer&#xD;
rumors got afloat in London. Heaven knows&#xD;
whether the colonel did not suspect his wife,&#xD;
and cross-question her. Might it not be that&#xD;
my misfortune was the result of a full con-&#xD;
fession on her part, and a preconcerted plan&#xD;
among themselves to - save their spotless&#xD;
names?   At all events, they say that when&#xD;
the colonel surprisel his wife in the garden,&#xD;
that eventful night, a scene ensued, the noise&#xD;
of which attracted the servants. And yet, I&#xD;
doubt that he prosecuted me under false pre-&#xD;
tenses. A colonel in the British army, and&#xD;
perjury I No; that is impossible "&#xD;
"For what reason do you suppose your&#xD;
brother wore your uniform?" said our hero.&#xD;
" I hardly ever gave it a thought. I do not&#xD;
think that lie could have foreseen the conse-&#xD;
quences; so I suppose that he chose to wear&#xD;
the uniform merely because it fitted him well,&#xD;
and displayed his figure to advantage."&#xD;
" Is this brother of yours," said Montant,&#xD;
hastily, as if suddenly impressed with a coin-&#xD;
cidence of names; " that is, are you any rela-&#xD;
tion to Judge Bates, of Massachusetts?"&#xD;
" Judge Bates is my brother Eben," replied&#xD;
old Martin, drily.&#xD;
If he had not been absorbed in his own&#xD;
thoughts, Martin Bates could not have failed to'&#xD;
notice that this information affected his com-&#xD;
panion very strongly. Our hero's face flushed&#xD;
-he bit his lips, and endeavored to regain his&#xD;
composure. In a few moments he was able to&#xD;
remark, in an apparently unconcerned man-&#xD;
ner-&#xD;
"I understand that he holds a high position&#xD;
in his profession, and is much respected by&#xD;
the community."&#xD;
" ie is a man of rare dignity and integrity&#xD;
of character," quoth Martin Bates, with a sar-&#xD;
donic laugh.&#xD;
" And he has a beautiful daughter," added&#xD;
our hero, almost below his breath.&#xD;
" You know him ?" asked the old cashier,&#xD;
casting a quick, searching look upon his inter-&#xD;
locutor.&#xD;
"1osaw him  and his daughter when Mr.&#xD;
Walter Going and I were last in Boston,"&#xD;
answered our hero, quickly.&#xD;
"Did I not understand that he knows my&#xD;
niece pretty well ?" asked Martin Bates, slily.&#xD;
1 I don't know the extent of their acquaint-&#xD;
ance," answered Ernest, composedly. "But&#xD;
to resume our subject," lie added, with anima-&#xD;
tiou, - I feel at liberty to tell you that you are&#xD;
not quite so kind-hearted in your judgment of&#xD;
your brother, as in many other matters that&#xD;
have come to my knowledge. You are called&#xD;
the most charitable of meon. Does this charity&#xD;
only concern your purse ? Does it leave voui&#xD;
heart, whenice it should arise, cold and uniconi&#xD;
&#xD;
FACT.&#xD;
&#xD;
cerned ? Have you not sufficient justice to&#xD;
concede that your brother had to consider the&#xD;
reputation of a noble lady, and the happiness&#xD;
of his betrothed; and that he sacrificed your&#xD;
honor only with a bleeding heart?  Are you&#xD;
certain that your own behavior did not alitn.&#xD;
ate him from you? Can you deny that after&#xD;
all he did what he could to make up-the great&#xD;
wrong which you suffered-not so much at his&#xD;
hands as from cruel destiny?  Your own state.&#xD;
ments exculpate him in a great measure."&#xD;
" Do you expect me to kiss the rod, like a&#xD;
woman ?" asked Martin Bates, with a dark look.&#xD;
"No; but I am certain that if you ap-&#xD;
proached your brother to-day: if you would&#xD;
seek him in an hour of adversity, you would&#xD;
find a shelter under his roof, and a home in&#xD;
his household."&#xD;
" Like a stray dog, that would find a kennel&#xD;
in some dirty corner of his barn; and that only -&#xD;
because Eben Bates must keep up his charac-&#xD;
ter for charity."&#xD;
 "Is it a worthy practice to attribute a man's&#xD;
acts of kindness to motives of pure selfish.&#xD;
ness?"&#xD;
-' No; unless you know your man as I know&#xD;
mine. But no more of this. I want to make&#xD;
you my confidant, for I am sure you are not&#xD;
one of the world that snarls at old Martin&#xD;
Bates. Besides, I want your aid in a personal&#xD;
matter, provided you feel disposed to aid me."&#xD;
Ernest was not at all anxious to possess his&#xD;
secrets; but being willing to befriend this oldj&#xD;
man, left by all, gave him an encouraging nod,&#xD;
as one tlat would say,-&#xD;
" Proceed at your pleasure; but at your&#xD;
pleasure only."&#xD;
" Know then," said the ex-lieutenant, "know&#xD;
then-that Martin Bates, the old tool, is in&#xD;
love !"&#xD;
The other did not, attempt to suppress a&#xD;
smile.&#xD;
"Smile away, young man, for well you may.&#xD;
Here I am, with gray hair and the experience&#xD;
of half a century to cool my blood a-nd teach&#xD;
me wisdom ;-here I am confessing this idiocy&#xD;
to a man not much over twenty, although I&#xD;
am well convinced that you would not have&#xD;
sunk so low in the rank of fools as I am. No&#xD;
wonder that I doubt all the world when I have&#xD;
to despise myself."&#xD;
Did the old cashier despise himself only for&#xD;
weakness toward the fair sex? Ile had used&#xD;
the term in a manner which did not exclusive-&#xD;
ly refer to that particular point of self-accusa-&#xD;
tion.&#xD;
"oYou have seen the Italian girl who comes&#xD;
into our office, and receives money from tie?&#xD;
She-'&#xD;
" Wehat?  I hope-"&#xD;
"Hope or no hope," he interrupted. "11er I&#xD;
love, and her I intend to marry-"&#xD;
Our hero was speechless.    Ile simply&#xD;
stared at the old man.&#xD;
"She is a gentle, good creature. and I want-&#xD;
her to comfort inc in my last days. I have a&#xD;
little property-a little property," he repeit-&#xD;
ed, as though mentally reckoning the net pro-&#xD;
ceeds. "' which I shall make over to her iumne-&#xD;
diately, and then we shall go to Italy. There I&#xD;
will end my days, solaced and attended by her.&#xD;
&#xD;
43&#xD;
&#xD;
"Leave our house ?" cried Ernest.&#xD;
" Yes," said the other, quietly, " aria yotu&#xD;
will have the best chance for my vacant stool.&#xD;
Will you promise not to tell Mr. Going of this-&#xD;
until I go?  And will you assist me a little&#xD;
hi completing my arrangements ?"&#xD;
'Providing I can do so without breaking my&#xD;
allegiance to my employers, yes."&#xD;
" Of course, with that proviso, certainly,"&#xD;
said the old man, intrenching himself behind&#xD;
a thick cloud of smoke.&#xD;
- Though, naturally, there is no doubt but&#xD;
that iy duty to my principals would not inter-&#xD;
fere with any thing that you could desire of&#xD;
aie."&#xD;
Naturally, no doubt," corroborated Martin&#xD;
Bates, looking up at the ceiling. "And what&#xD;
is imore, I will teach you so much of my pres-&#xD;
eat duties as will make it convenient for Mr.&#xD;
Going to dispense with my services at any&#xD;
moment. This will almost insure your suc-&#xD;
ceeding mie, for no one else will be capable of&#xD;
stepping into my place. after I have quietly&#xD;
prepared you for it."&#xD;
" I don't like that," answered  Montant,&#xD;
uneasily. " It will look as if I had been in-&#xD;
triguing and planning selfishly for my advance-&#xD;
ne" t.''&#xD;
Not at all," answered the cashier, imupa-&#xD;
tiently. " You are not so slow a man as to&#xD;
hesitate at tritles like this when your success&#xD;
in life is in your own hands."&#xD;
But it goes against my grain, and with all&#xD;
thanks to you, I shall not attempt to force Mr.&#xD;
Going into appointing nme to a placesof extra-&#xD;
ordinary trust and responsibility."&#xD;
Well, then, he must do the best he can&#xD;
after I have gone. I merely tried to save hlii1&#xD;
any inconvenience, when I shall have left hint&#xD;
suddenly.&#xD;
"Why not give him notice now ?" said our&#xD;
hero. puzzled and annoyed.&#xD;
" Because I do not wish to be cross-ques-&#xD;
tioned and pressed to stay, or have this folly&#xD;
of my marriage discovered, and so be turned&#xD;
imto the laughing-stock of the office, and per-&#xD;
haps half the town."&#xD;
" Is the gi willing ?"&#xD;
"Yes; but she is surrounded by a vaga-&#xD;
bondset of friends or relatives, or perhaps&#xD;
lovers. Among them all I expect to have a&#xD;
hard mine of it. Yet, if she does not change&#xD;
her m   aindl intend to run off with her in spite&#xD;
ofo them  ill, and that is another vital reason&#xD;
for keeping the matter quiet. You know that&#xD;
these Italians are a spying, treacherous set.&#xD;
Already the suspect me of worse intentions&#xD;
than I deserve, and should they hear, as well&#xD;
they might, that 1 had given Mr. Going notice,&#xD;
they might place her out of my reach."&#xD;
"And what do yotu want mle to do for you?",&#xD;
"Have a carriage ready for meto-morrow.&#xD;
night, at twelve o'clock, in ChathaniSquare.&#xD;
I mean to ask them honorably for her hand;&#xD;
but if they refuse to let her go, she will steal&#xD;
out of the house and joine in. After I find&#xD;
'O1, I would like you to see tao off at the sta-&#xD;
tiu, take a letter frona ueto Mr. Goiig, amd&#xD;
&#xD;
execute a few trifling commissions for me after&#xD;
I have gone."&#xD;
The old man's plan was so immediate and&#xD;
imperative that his hearer was rather bewil-&#xD;
dered. Something urged him to accept the&#xD;
service asked of him. His own ways had al-&#xD;
ways been, as he meant they always should&#xD;
be, open and straightforward, and this queer,&#xD;
almost insane freak of the trusted cashier&#xD;
alarmed him. He scanned the old man's face&#xD;
closely. Martin's eyes were unsteady ; he had&#xD;
laid down his cigar and was chewing tobacco,&#xD;
rolling his quid from side to side, never leav-&#xD;
ing it on either the Credit or Debit side, and&#xD;
our hero thought to himself, is money com-&#xD;
ing into the house, or is money going out of it?&#xD;
Although Martin Bates, thirty years in the&#xD;
service, and considered the most honest of old&#xD;
souls, could not be really suspected of embez-&#xD;
zing money, yet he thought that. question&#xD;
worthy of after-consideration, and not to be&#xD;
dogmatically dismissed.&#xD;
-This love of yours seems half ridiculous,&#xD;
ialf fabulous, Mr. Bates," he said, hiding his&#xD;
uneasiness under a smile; "but as long as it&#xD;
exists, I do not wonder at the queer manner&#xD;
in which you mean to carry out your plans for&#xD;
happiness. I will be there to-morrow, with&#xD;
the carriage. Midnight-to-morrow-say at&#xD;
the southeast corner, where Chatham Street&#xD;
runs into Chatham Square."&#xD;
"Thank you. .And you will swear upon the&#xD;
Bible that you will not breathe a word of this&#xD;
to Mr. Going or any one else. Swear that&#xD;
here, and now, if you please."&#xD;
There was something over-anxious in his&#xD;
tone, as if' it had suddenly occurred to hini&#xD;
that he should have sworn in his confidant be-&#xD;
fore he entrusted him with so many secrets.&#xD;
The other thought a moment, and then&#xD;
said:-&#xD;
"Mr. Bates I am a queer fellow I can only&#xD;
promise tis with a-reservation, which amounts&#xD;
to this. I will give you my word as a gentle-&#xD;
man to keep this matter secret unless my duty&#xD;
to Mr. Going demands otherwise.. This clause&#xD;
is so harmless that I hope it will pass as a&#xD;
mere eccentricity, for I can solemnly assure&#xD;
you that I have po doubt that what you are&#xD;
doing is merely something very odd. And&#xD;
nothing can be imagined likely to happen be-&#xD;
tween this and to-morrow that would absolve&#xD;
me from my promise."&#xD;
"Of course not," said Martin Bates.&#xD;
"'Then with that proviso, I here give you&#xD;
my hand and my word as a gentleman."&#xD;
" Done," said Martin Bates, and they shook&#xD;
hands..&#xD;
"And now, as the clock has struck nine, I&#xD;
must go and prepare for the party at r.&#xD;
Going's. You are not coming?" asked our&#xD;
hero.&#xD;
" to, I sent a regret," replied the other, and&#xD;
so they parted.&#xD;
When the old man was left to himself his&#xD;
ihoe changed. With a grim look he asked&#xD;
himself,&#xD;
-- Have I made another blunder to-night ?"&#xD;

CHAPTER II.&#xD;
DEBIT AND CREDIT.&#xD;
"Screw your courage to the sticking point, and&#xD;
we'i not tail."-MACBETH.&#xD;
A rrER our hero had polished a little, he&#xD;
made the best of his way to Mr. Going's house&#xD;
in Fifth Avenue.  He walked steadily and&#xD;
firmly, every step, midicating a determined&#xD;
state of mind, and surely iv was not child's&#xD;
play which occupied him. He had resolved&#xD;
upon undertaking a dangerous task. Danger-&#xD;
ens, because it might bring him in the way of&#xD;
committing great injustice to another, and,&#xD;
perhaps evil consequences to himself should&#xD;
he prove to be in error. He ran the risk of&#xD;
losing the respect and confidence of his em-&#xD;
ployers, perhaps of ruining his prospects for&#xD;
life. He might be misunderstood and blamed&#xD;
for over-zealousness, so alienating his best&#xD;
friends or even accused of intent to criminate&#xD;
old Martin Bates from a selfish motive.&#xD;
Yet lie wavered not an instant; had his life&#xD;
been the stake he would have proceeded as&#xD;
directly as he now walked straight to Mr.&#xD;
Goimg's house, thinking, as he walked of the&#xD;
best method (f accomplishing his object.&#xD;
Ile reached the house. A carpet was laid&#xD;
from the door to the curb-stone, that the daimty&#xD;
feet of the ladies might tread upon soft dry&#xD;
ground. On either side stood an uncouth as-&#xD;
semblage of the curious poor, anxious for a&#xD;
giupse at the great people.  Seamstresses&#xD;
were theme watching their own work as it&#xD;
squeezed out of the carriages, swept past, and&#xD;
vanished within the door. Beggars eyed the&#xD;
vision of luxury with hungry eyes, wondering&#xD;
how many loaves of bread this dress or the&#xD;
one yonder would buy. Paupers where there&#xD;
who had once been actors in Vanity Fair, and&#xD;
had now sunk to be mere envious spectators&#xD;
of the gay scene. And the flare of the light&#xD;
within shone queerly upon that crowd, and&#xD;
the music of the dance broke upon their ears&#xD;
like a mockery.&#xD;
Our hero entered, and after a short sojourn&#xD;
in the gentlemen's dressing-room, came into&#xD;
the parlor. Miss Jessie, as charming as ever,&#xD;
was, as usual surrounded by the proper multi.&#xD;
tude of admirers. Mr. Faro had just danced&#xD;
with her, and now relinquished his fair partner&#xD;
to Mr. Wheeler, with a suicidal sigh. She&#xD;
scarcely found time to welcome Ernest,. and,&#xD;
alter a few common-place remarks, ignored&#xD;
him completely.  The deferential crowd of&#xD;
admirers saw at once that he was not in high&#xD;
favor with the goddess, and tried hard to&#xD;
look as if they did not consider the new-comer&#xD;
a donkey and a dunce from principle.&#xD;
Before long our hero found an opportunity&#xD;
to dance a waltz with her.&#xD;
""Miss Going," lie said in her ear, "I must&#xD;
have a few words with you this evening, and&#xD;
as you are very much in demand, I would&#xD;
suggest that you dance the next quadrille with&#xD;
me, to give me an opportunity."&#xD;
"Very well, Mr. Montaut, only don't let it&#xD;
be any thing serious I1 don't heel in the humor&#xD;
for it."&#xD;
&#xD;
"As you wish," he answered, "then we&#xD;
shall not dance the next quadrille."&#xD;
" Why, yes, we will," cried the young girl.&#xD;
"To be sure, I will be most happy, Mr. Mon.&#xD;
tant," so saying she bowed her readiness to&#xD;
-nish the dance with Mr. Fate, who stood'by,&#xD;
waiting in delicious suspense as if he looked&#xD;
for an appointment in the seventh heaven.&#xD;
Montant bit his lips as ha turned away.&#xD;
" Humor or no-humor," he muttered, "I mean&#xD;
to say a word or two which she may forget if&#xD;
she can."&#xD;
The quadrille came. Miss Jessie seemed un-&#xD;
conscious of her partner, except as an auxiliary&#xD;
machine in going through the figures. In&#xD;
one of the pauses of the dance, he whispered&#xD;
to her,-&#xD;
" Do you remember a promise which you&#xD;
exacted from me some months ago in this very&#xD;
room ?"&#xD;
She looked at him with apparently'genuine&#xD;
inquisitiveness.&#xD;
" A promise,".he continued, gravely, " that I&#xD;
would devote myself, both unfluicingly and&#xD;
loyally, to-"&#xD;
" Don't speak so loud," she interposed, evi-&#xD;
dently ill-pleased with the subject. " I do re-&#xD;
member some remarks I made. And what&#xD;
can have occurred to rerr ind you of them ?"&#xD;
" I have not ecme to bother you wih such&#xD;
matters," answered our heroic urtly, "I only&#xD;
wish to exact a promise from you ii return."&#xD;
She looked up at him with arch wonder.&#xD;
Fascinated as usual in her presence, his voice&#xD;
trembled tomrewhat as he continued,-&#xD;
"Promise me that if from to-night my re-&#xD;
lations wih your father and brother should-&#xD;
change; if I should be blamed, and accused&#xD;
of apparently unwarranted acts, you will never&#xD;
doubt me; but believe me, that what 1 do,&#xD;
is the inspiration of my duty to them, and the&#xD;
conscientious fulfillment of my promise to you,&#xD;
that I would not desert them  i an hour of&#xD;
danger even at my own peil."I&#xD;
The figures of the dance separated them be-&#xD;
fore she could reply; but although she flirted&#xD;
with the irrepressible Mr. Faro, and the grace-&#xD;
ful Mr. Wheeler. she seemed thoughtful and&#xD;
preoccupied. When they paused again, she&#xD;
said, all too lightly to please him,- .&#xD;
" Certainly, I will promise, and I am quite&#xD;
sure that what you do will be all right. But&#xD;
won't you tell me what is this mysterious&#xD;
transaction that makes you look as solemn as&#xD;
an owl?"&#xD;
" No," he replied, disappointed at her flip-&#xD;
pant reply, "I am sorry that I can not satisfy&#xD;
your curiosity about business matters. I re-&#xD;
commend you to dismiss the subject from your&#xD;
mind. Forget that I mentioned it at all."&#xD;
" I hope for your-for our sakes, that the&#xD;
matter is not as serious as you seem to think&#xD;
it is. Are you certain that it is not a fancied&#xD;
danger only ?  'There was some anxiety&#xD;
expressed im the last sentence, and she looked&#xD;
earnestly at him for a moment. Yet he was&#xD;
not satisfied, and only replied, dryly,-&#xD;
oIn all probability, onmly a fancied danger.&#xD;
The dance having ended, he left her abruptly',&#xD;
but Fare and Mr. Wheeler and their attendant&#xD;
cherubs in swallow-tailed coats, remarked that&#xD;
&#xD;
Miss Going seemed to have suddenly lost her&#xD;
exuberant spirits to a noticeable degree. Par-&#xD;
ticularly when, after supper, she noticed her&#xD;
brother stealing away from the room and&#xD;
leaving the house in company with Ernest&#xD;
Montant, she utterly ruined their happiness by&#xD;
absent-mindedness, and preoccupation, so that&#xD;
they began to consider the propriety of ex-&#xD;
tinguishing their bright lights by gracefully&#xD;
committing suicide.&#xD;
" Are you ready to stay up all night, Wal-&#xD;
ter ?" said Montant, when they reached the&#xD;
sidewalk.&#xD;
"I have a bottle of brandy, a brace of pis-&#xD;
tols, and plenty of cigars," was the conclusive&#xD;
answer.&#xD;
" Then let us take a carriage."&#xD;
Reader, have you a correct idea of a night-&#xD;
owl? If not, you have only to hail a hack in&#xD;
New York at midnight, and, something will&#xD;
approach you which would furnish an appro-&#xD;
priate triumphal chariot for King Plague, were&#xD;
Death to hold a carnival procession. With&#xD;
two skeletons for horses, with two yellow&#xD;
struggling lamps, like wanton, distempered&#xD;
eyes, with a drunken heap of rags on the&#xD;
box for a driver, with an unwholesome noise&#xD;
like the death-rattle of.a cholera patient, with&#xD;
the dank odor of the grave filling the interior,&#xD;
and the lining of the seats spotted like the&#xD;
eruptive ,stage of, the small-pox; thus will it&#xD;
lurch and totter up to you, one of a whole&#xD;
legion, not one of which dares to stir out in&#xD;
the light of day, but which prowl about at&#xD;
night only. This is a night-owl.&#xD;
Directions were given to the driver, and the&#xD;
two gentlemen were soon on their way rat-&#xD;
tling along as fast as they could be expected&#xD;
under the circumstances.&#xD;
'- And now," said Walter _Going, "may I&#xD;
ask where we are bound to?"&#xD;
'- To your office."&#xD;
" I must confess. Ernie," said Walter, after&#xD;
a pace, "I think it is best that you should tell&#xD;
me all about the circumstances which have&#xD;
brought about this strange behavior of yours.&#xD;
You are not the man to act in this way with-&#xD;
out good reasons, or I would not have followed&#xD;
you to-night. What do you propose to do at&#xD;
the office ?"&#xD;
" Look over the books," replied lie, quietly.&#xD;
" Whom do you suspect?" asked Walter,&#xD;
plumply.&#xD;
"I take the responsibility of this little ex-&#xD;
pedition, and you agreed to go with me as a&#xD;
personal favor only, so you can not insist upon&#xD;
an answer. I am not sure of my case, not at&#xD;
all sure, and I run a risk which appears more&#xD;
and more dangerous as I approach it nearer,{&#xD;
and full of threatening consequence's."&#xD;
'. And why not share the responsibility ? If&#xD;
you advise with me, if we work together, then&#xD;
no blame can attach to you. I think you owe&#xD;
it to yourself to avoid this risk if possible."&#xD;
"I am quite sensible of all you say," replied&#xD;
the other, gravely. "iBut I have given my&#xD;
word of honor as a gentleman, not to reveal&#xD;
the secret which has led to my suspicions,&#xD;
unless my duty to your house demanded it.&#xD;
eo you see becomes my dity to see with my&#xD;
On eyes whether the secret is to be revealed&#xD;
&#xD;
44&#xD;
&#xD;
or not, and for this reason I have called you&#xD;
out to-night, and this it is which forbids my&#xD;
sharing the responsibility."&#xD;
Walter could not answer this, and his com-&#xD;
panion vouchsafed no further explanation.&#xD;
As the old coach' rumbled noisily through the&#xD;
streets he fell into a brown study. His whole&#xD;
life passed in review before him, and lie real-&#xD;
ized his present position with painful accuracy.&#xD;
He had decided upon a bold lead, and he knew&#xD;
full well that this mysterious way of going&#xD;
about it would tell heavily against him should&#xD;
he prove to be mistaken.&#xD;
"If Mr. Going hears of it, he will not doubt&#xD;
my honesty of purpose, but he will come to&#xD;
the conclusion that I am a very young and&#xD;
very foolish boy, who, in future, had better&#xD;
accustom himself not to look beyond his daily&#xD;
duties Now I do hate to be considered a busy&#xD;
body and a spyi And as for Miss Jessie, if&#xD;
she hears of it, she will smile with a mixture&#xD;
of good-nature and pity, and will never respect&#xD;
me."&#xD;
He thought bitterly of what lie had to ex-&#xD;
pect, and how little the purity of his motives&#xD;
would help or excuse him.&#xD;
however," he thought again, " there is&#xD;
one woman who will not misunderstand me."&#xD;
Josephine Van Strom was in his mind. He&#xD;
had not seen her for some weeks, for his dirdu-&#xD;
ous duties at the office had not permitted him&#xD;
to make a trip to Massachusetts, where John&#xD;
Van Strom, Bella, and Josephine had settled&#xD;
soon after old Van Strom's death. They had&#xD;
been in constant correspondence, and our hero&#xD;
was comforting himself by recalling some of&#xD;
the glowing words in which she had assured&#xD;
him of her unbounded love for him, when the&#xD;
carriage stopped opposite the tall door, over&#xD;
which the gilded sign " Going &amp;amp; Son," was&#xD;
just distinguishable in the doubtful light of the&#xD;
street lamps.&#xD;
Meanwhile, all was dark and still in the of-&#xD;
fice. The desk of the old cashier, with its&#xD;
high stool, was standing massive and silent,&#xD;
and if a few little mice were about, they must&#xD;
have already caught the sound of approaching&#xD;
footsteps and have scampered away, for when&#xD;
the gentlemen entered there was not a sound&#xD;
in the room.&#xD;
The bronze figure of "Justice" holding the&#xD;
scales out at arm's length on Martin's inkstand,&#xD;
had gone to rest long ago, if Justice ever sleeps.&#xD;
Perhaps she had laid down the scales and&#xD;
sword, tired of holding them all day long, and&#xD;
slept with her head resting on them. Perhaps&#xD;
there was a soul in the little bronze, and when&#xD;
darkness prevailed, who knows but what the&#xD;
little image told stories to the mice, describing&#xD;
how Martin Bites rolled his tobacco from one&#xD;
side of his capacious mouth to the other, as&#xD;
he wrote "debit," or "credit" in the books, and&#xD;
how she had watched him many years, and&#xD;
knew him better than any one else, and could&#xD;
tell a secret, oh, a deep secret, only he was&#xD;
such an old friend, she could not betray him&#xD;
unless-unless-&#xD;
But when thme deer creaked and two men&#xD;

&#xD;
private office, and books from old Martin's desk,&#xD;
the little figure of Justice was standing up and&#xD;
holding out her scales vigorously, with a strange&#xD;
light in her bronze eyes, which shone through&#xD;
the bandage. But there seemed a vigor in the&#xD;
old attitude, and perhaps she would have liked&#xD;
to say: " He is a friend, an old friend of mine.&#xD;
I have known him thirty years; but let him be&#xD;
judged, let him be judged, whoever he may be."&#xD;
And the flicker of the light danced up and&#xD;
down the polished wainscoting, and peeped&#xD;
into the corners of the room. The mice watched&#xD;
the two men from their hiples while they&#xD;
ciphered, and reckoned. and calculated, and&#xD;
compared Martin Bates's accounts, while Jus-&#xD;
tice overlooked the whole proceeding with great&#xD;
interest.&#xD;
So they sat and worked away, talking in&#xD;
whispers, scribbling and checking off, while&#xD;
the office clock ticked itself to one o'clock,&#xD;
which it struck so loudly as to startle them for&#xD;
a moment, and then to two o'clock which star-&#xD;
tled them twice more.&#xD;
Ernest Montant's face was calm, and did not&#xD;
express the agitation of his mind. He knew full&#xD;
well what was making Walter bite his lips and&#xD;
frown ; he knew why Walter looked pale, and&#xD;
worked in a nervous, fidgety manner. le&#xD;
knew how a true man feels when he must play&#xD;
the part of a sneak and a spy, for his own&#xD;
self-respect was fast leaving him over that&#xD;
night's occupation.&#xD;
" This book will be the last," said he, when&#xD;
the hands of the clock had moved far on the&#xD;
road to three o'clock. " If we find all correct&#xD;
here, as in the others, I will desist."&#xD;
" You'd better," said Walter Going, in a&#xD;
tone of mingled reproach and weariness. "This&#xD;
whole business puts you in a false light. It&#xD;
was wrong and unwarrantable for you to take&#xD;
all this upon yourself!"&#xD;
It was our hero's turn to grow pale-pale as&#xD;
death.&#xD;
After all, he had not realized how bitter, how&#xD;
very bitter would be his reward, should all be&#xD;
found correct, nor how soon he would begin to&#xD;
receive it.&#xD;
'Your suspicions-" continued Walter Going&#xD;
without looking at him.&#xD;
" That term, is not a just one," interrupted&#xD;
the other, hoarsely. " You don't know that I&#xD;
harbored any, and, indeed, unless' the exami-&#xD;
nation of these books should warrant it, which&#xD;
it seems they do not, I should harbor no sus-&#xD;
picion of any one. I merely ask you to look&#xD;
over them, and my reasons for doing so are my&#xD;
own and mine only. This was our bargain be-&#xD;
fore we left the house."&#xD;
" Well; and now that we are as certain of&#xD;
his innocence as I have been from the begin-&#xD;
ning, are you going to justify yourself in my&#xD;
eyes at least. by telling me all about it."&#xD;
" I do not break my word quite so easily as&#xD;
that." he replied, "I only ask you now to&#xD;
finish this work, and then  you may think&#xD;
what you please. Here is the last hook."&#xD;
Walter was checking off the figures as they&#xD;
were called off to him in an undertone, and&#xD;
yawning ill-temnperedly over the task, when,&#xD;
all at once, he opened his eyes wider, ie did&#xD;
not check off that figure. No; how was that ?&#xD;
&#xD;
Could they believe their eyes ? Yes, here, at&#xD;
last Martin Bates had made afalse and fraudu-&#xD;
lent entry!/&#xD;
They looked at each other in dumb amaze.&#xD;
meant for a moment. The color rose to their&#xD;
cheeks as if they blushed at the manner in&#xD;
which they had made this discovery, and the&#xD;
little bronze Justice held out her scales in a&#xD;
commanding manner, seeming ready to uplift&#xD;
her sword and cry aloud for judgment.&#xD;
Are you asleep, Martin Bates, dreaming of&#xD;
your Italian bride with whom you are to leave&#xD;
the country to-morrow for a retreat of love&#xD;
and luxury. and all with stolen money?  Or&#xD;
does a vision trouble your sleep, showing you&#xD;
two men with flashing eyes and busy pens&#xD;
sitting at your desk until the clock strikes five&#xD;
-until it strikes six'? Do you notice that one&#xD;
of them has a small piece of paper by his side&#xD;
on which he occasionly notes a few figures?&#xD;
They increase slowly, those figures. Each one&#xD;
is the result of a long calculation; but they&#xD;
increase too  rapidly for your sake, Martin&#xD;
Bates, for they sum up already to thirty thou.&#xD;
sand! thirty thousand dollars, Martin Bales;&#xD;
Are not the figures engraven upon your heart.&#xD;
written deep into its tenderest flesh with " red-&#xD;
hot pen, never to be erased, but to bear&#xD;
witness against you before the tribunal of God ?&#xD;
"I think that is all," says Montant, in a&#xD;
scarcely audible whisper, as the clock strikes&#xD;
six, and wiping his forehead--&#xD;
"I think that is all," corroborates Walter&#xD;
Going, mechanically, and covers his face with&#xD;
his hands. " And now," he added, without&#xD;
altering his position, "now, are you disposed&#xD;
to tell me all?"&#xD;
"Now," replied Ernest, "my duty compels&#xD;
me to give you a full statement, and I an ab-&#xD;
solved from my promise of secrecy."&#xD;
" Poor fellow," said Walter Going. feelingly.&#xD;
"Thirty years in the house, and a defaulter.&#xD;
I think that if we were to look back through&#xD;
the books, we should discover that this has&#xD;
been going on for years !"&#xD;
"It is for you to decide whether an account-&#xD;
ant shall be employed for that purpose.'&#xD;
" Let us go and tell my father. It will he&#xD;
hard to make him believe it. Upon my word&#xD;
I expect him to disbelieve his eyes rather than&#xD;
to distrust old Bates."&#xD;
" And yet he must face the truth. As for&#xD;
me, by the living God, I wish I had been mis-&#xD;
taken," said Montant, solemnly.&#xD;
Walter Going extended his hand, which was&#xD;
taken warmlv by the other, and a ray of satis.&#xD;
faction overspread the face of our hero. Yet&#xD;
that feeling could not triumph at the expense&#xD;
of another's guilt and consequent inisery, and&#xD;
when they drove back to Fifth Avenue, they&#xD;
were a sad and silent pair.&#xD;
"I am tired and sleepy and as stupid as a&#xD;
fish," said Walter, as they alighted. " Here it&#xD;
is broad daylight and we have been dancing&#xD;
and cyphering all night. I say, a refreshing&#xD;
trip down town is just the thing after a party,&#xD;
isn't it, especially when it leads to such de-&#xD;
lightful discoveries?"&#xD;
" Yet you must listen to my story," said&#xD;
Ernest, for we have no time to lose m&#xD;
sleep."&#xD;
&#xD;
Walter went up stairs and aroused his&#xD;
father, and while the old gentleman was dress.&#xD;
ing, the young men refreshed themselves, so&#xD;
that it was still early in the morning when the&#xD;
three met in the library.&#xD;
Mr. Going's astonishment and dismay were&#xD;
not demonstrative but most painful to the un-&#xD;
willing informers.&#xD;
" At my age," said the old gentleman finally,&#xD;
in a low voice, evidently much moved, "at my&#xD;
age, boys, a man is not adapted to receive les.&#xD;
sons in the school of life. That Martin Bates&#xD;
should be a scoundrel disproves all my knowl-&#xD;
edge and experience. His motives I can not&#xD;
divine, his hypocrisy I can not fathom, his&#xD;
whole character has become a myth, and yet I&#xD;
have known him thirty years lIf he wanted&#xD;
money, even large sums, I would have lent it&#xD;
to him  on  his word   alone. Why could&#xD;
he not borrow, then, even if he never repaid&#xD;
mie? That, though bad enough, would not&#xD;
have amounted to crime, for which I eaot&#xD;
prosecute hin!"&#xD;
So true it is that thousands might avoid&#xD;
crime, for in nearly every case ,honest and&#xD;
open means would secure for them what they&#xD;
so much desire.&#xD;
Surely, if an employer have sufficient conti-&#xD;
dence in a clerk, to put him in a position where&#xD;
there is a possibility for theft to a large&#xD;
amount, he would be willing to lend a smaller&#xD;
amount to his employee to save him from the&#xD;
temptation of stealing.&#xD;
And then our hero told the partners all&#xD;
he had learned from Martin Bates's own lips&#xD;
the night before at dinner, the love athir with&#xD;
the Italian girl included.  He went into all&#xD;
the particulars of this last item, concluding&#xD;
with his  appointment with   a carriage in&#xD;
Clathan Square.&#xD;
"It may seem  unjust to him," he added,&#xD;
"to tell all his personal secrets; but I have no&#xD;
choice in the matter, for I suppose this girl&#xD;
must be arrested too. She may have the&#xD;
money, which imay thus be recovered."&#xD;
Mr Going nodded assent.&#xD;
This morning, at the office, he is to tell&#xD;
me whether he has been able to obtain her&#xD;
family's consent to the marriage. If not, I&#xD;
must, of course, be on hand with the carriage,&#xD;
and we will catch them both at once. In the&#xD;
aiean time, of course, you know best how to&#xD;
prevent any further theft, during to-day. I&#xD;
must acknowledge that I think lie intended to&#xD;
add to his plunder before leaving; but good&#xD;
fortniie--&#xD;
"Or rather your remarkable energy, fore-&#xD;
siht, and courage," cried Mr. Going. "Why,&#xD;
but for you, Heaven only knows to what ex-&#xD;
tent this might have gone."&#xD;
ir. Going," said  Montant, gravely, "I&#xD;
have been playing the part of a detective&#xD;
policeman, and can assure you that my boyish&#xD;
admiration for the pursuit has been entirely&#xD;
tone away by this night's work. I would not&#xD;
steal my way into a man's confidence, and&#xD;
then, saving myself from n'rral perjury only&#xD;
ba mental hair's breadth, betray him to the&#xD;
rerbution lhe merited, no, not .for all the&#xD;
rih eo h world I"&#xD;
"Ad yet you have done your duty!" cried&#xD;
&#xD;
Mr. Going. "How can I reward you for all&#xD;
this?"&#xD;
" Dont speak to me of reward," answered&#xD;
the young man, quickly. "For such work as&#xD;
last night's, I don't know of any."&#xD;
"Will you accept the position of head-&#xD;
cashier ? I offer it to you. Don't start. I do&#xD;
so, not only because I want to pay you; but&#xD;
because I am convinced that it is important&#xD;
for me to retain your services in a higher&#xD;
place." The old gentleman, seeing that Ernest&#xD;
had colored crimson, arose and gave him his&#xD;
hand, saying, as he lid so,-&#xD;
As long as I live, I shall not forget what&#xD;
you have done. I know that no desire of sup-&#xD;
planting him has prompted you. I know that&#xD;
no consideration save your warm attachnient&#xD;
to us all, could have induced you to run the&#xD;
risk which you did, so I want no overstrained&#xD;
sensitiveness, when I offer you this well-&#xD;
(aried advanceiment. Had Martin Bates died&#xD;
an honest man, last night, and better it had&#xD;
been for hiim, I would have selected you as his&#xD;
successor, just the same."&#xD;
Montant shook his head.  The pride which&#xD;
drove the bright color to his face at first&#xD;
was melted by the kind words just chronicled;&#xD;
but he answered decisively,-.&#xD;
I aii very grateful, and under other cir-&#xD;
cumostances should be proud and happy at this&#xD;
distinction. As matters stand I ask you as a&#xD;
great favor to allow me to remain at my pre-&#xD;
sent employment until the impressions of this&#xD;
night have left niy heart, if they ever will."&#xD;
As you wish, of course," - answered Mr.&#xD;
Going, much disappointed, and the subject&#xD;
dropped.&#xD;
Our   hero  concluded  his narrative by&#xD;
showing in a perfectly cool and impassionate&#xD;
manner, that a man who has been drummed&#xD;
out of the British army, car not, as a rule, be&#xD;
trusted implicitly and of course, in the narrative,&#xD;
the name of Judge Eben Bates of Massachusetta&#xD;
was mentioned.&#xD;
iHere Walter became interested in the con.&#xD;
templation of the sidewalk, just -beneath the&#xD;
library window.&#xD;
" You know this Judge Bates, don't you,&#xD;
Walter?" asked his father.&#xD;
" Yes, sir," was the laconic reply; and Walter&#xD;
began to count the bricks in the opposite&#xD;
house.&#xD;
" Has he not a daughter, a very charming&#xD;
girl. whom you once pointed out to me in Bos-&#xD;
ton ?&#xD;
Yes, sir."&#xD;
" They are undoubtedly very respectable&#xD;
people, and this disgrace will be very hard on&#xD;
them. Very hard. indeed, on them," mused the&#xD;
kind-hearted old gentleman. In a moment or&#xD;
two he looked ip, and said,-&#xD;
"Boys, we will keep this thing quiet."&#xD;
" That is what I thought best. sir," said&#xD;
Walter, still looking out of the window.,&#xD;
" If he gives up what he may have left of&#xD;
the thirty thousand dollars, we will let him&#xD;
off and end the matter, without a public&#xD;
show."&#xD;
" Very good idea, sir," said Walter. and then&#xD;
they consulted as to the best means of accoma-&#xD;
plishing this end.&#xD;

Walter Going and Ernest Montant drove&#xD;
down to the office together, leaving Mr. Geing&#xD;
at home. During the whole of the preceding&#xD;
evening, while engaged in overhauling old&#xD;
Martin's books, neither of them had mentioned&#xD;
Judge Bates or his daughter whom Walter&#xD;
"knew;" but now they spoke of no one else&#xD;
but this Miss Bates, whom Walter now called&#xD;
Bessy, until the carriage stopped at the office&#xD;
door.&#xD;
They entered the outer office; there stood&#xD;
old Martin Bates already at his desk, and,&#xD;
confronting him, was the little bronze figure,&#xD;
holding her scales in his very face. Truly,&#xD;
Justice had not slept that night.&#xD;
CHAPTER III.&#xD;
MR. STUMP.&#xD;
"Read this and know I know your worthiness."&#xD;
KING HENRY V.&#xD;
" MR. WALTER GOING sends word that he&#xD;
would like to see you in the private office,&#xD;
sir."&#xD;
So spoke one of the younger clerks to Martin&#xD;
Bates, and the summons was immediately&#xD;
obeyed by the old cashier. When he entered,&#xD;
he found our hero and another gentleman, with&#xD;
his younger principal. Walter immediately&#xD;
arose in a nervous manner, closed the door, and&#xD;
bolted it.&#xD;
" Let me introduce Mr. Stump to you, Mr.&#xD;
Bates."  Whereupon the stranger said, "your&#xD;
most obedient, sir." He was short, quite fat,&#xD;
red-faced, clean shaved, and wore his red hair&#xD;
closely cropped His eyes were small; but&#xD;
exceedingly sharp, and constantly wandering&#xD;
from one object to another; he was carefully,&#xD;
but vulgarly dressed, and   although  his&#xD;
round face suggested good-nature, with a ten-&#xD;
dency to fun, his tout ensemble was decidedly&#xD;
coarse.&#xD;
"Your most obedient, sir," repeated Mr.&#xD;
Stump, with emphasis, and took up a newspa&#xD;
per, from behind which he amused himself&#xD;
by taking a mental photograph of Mr. Bates.&#xD;
"And now that we are all seated, Mr&#xD;
Bates," said Walter Going, " and as there is no&#xD;
body present who should not listen, let me as!&#xD;
you at once: What did you do with the money?'&#xD;
Martin Bates started, and his color changed&#xD;
He looked from one to the other. bit his lips&#xD;
and did not reply for a moment. Strange t4&#xD;
say, there was no dismay, and but very littl&#xD;
agitation manifest in his voice when he re&#xD;
plied:-&#xD;
"Fifteen thousand I can account for and yo&#xD;
will not lose it. The other fifteen thousand i&#xD;
a dead loss. I can not, will not say, how, o&#xD;
where, even should torture be revived once&#xD;
more for old-Martin Bates's especial benefit-&#xD;
which would not surprise me in the least. A&#xD;
for you, sir,' turning to our hero, "I am ver&#xD;
much obliged to you for the part you have acted&#xD;
and as for you, sir," accosting Mr. Stump, "&#xD;
suppose I may consider myself your prisoner&#xD;
and so ends the first scena of the last act&#xD;
&#xD;
that great authentic tragedy called 'The Life of&#xD;
Martin Bates."&#xD;
Not until the last sentence did he evince any&#xD;
emotion, seeming to attribute it all to his usual&#xD;
ill-luck, but the last words were given with&#xD;
indescribable bitterness.&#xD;
" You are wonderful sharp, sir," interposA&#xD;
Mr. Stump, after a pause. '"First, to know what&#xD;
money Mr. Going' means, and second, to guess,&#xD;
(and quite right tool) that it was this 'ere Mr.&#xD;
Mountain which fetched you up with notorious&#xD;
genius, and last of all to see right through my&#xD;
swell clothes and reckernize the policeman I&#xD;
And all as true as Gospel, sir ! You have stated&#xD;
the case in fewer and couciser words than I&#xD;
could myself."&#xD;
"Has this Italian girl got possession of any&#xD;
large sums?" asked Walter Going.&#xD;
." Aha I" cried Bates, turning upon our hero&#xD;
with a grim smile, "I see that my friend,&#xD;
according to his word of honor given to me, has&#xD;
favored you with the whole of my personal&#xD;
history !"&#xD;
Ernest felt the reproach, but said nothing.&#xD;
"1I suppose" continued the old man, sardonic.&#xD;
cally, " that any one having the faculty of con.&#xD;
necting two ideas in his mind could name my&#xD;
successor in the office ?I"&#xD;
Montant thought as he turned away, (for&#xD;
defense was useless) that even had lie ac-&#xD;
cepted Mr. Going's offer of the head cashier's&#xD;
desk, he would now have resigned it at any&#xD;
cost. He felt that he could not have borne the&#xD;
old man's sarcasm had he consented to profit&#xD;
by his fall.&#xD;
" I dare say," continued Bates, with biting&#xD;
irony, " that there was a clause in that promise&#xD;
upon honor, a loop-hole, through which my&#xD;
highly honorable friend slipped while his ac-&#xD;
commodating conscience acquitted him of per-&#xD;
jury. Of course gentlemen can not break their&#xD;
words of honor l How     fortunate that this&#xD;
loop-hole existed ! He never thought of it_&#xD;
until afterwards. Oh, no. 1e, did not mean&#xD;
r to slip through it at the time he insisted upon&#xD;
putting in that clause in which lie promised se.&#xD;
crecy unless some danger to the firm should com-&#xD;
pel him to break the trust. What danger has&#xD;
f befallen the firm since eight o'clock yesterday&#xD;
evening ?"&#xD;
"'Mr. Bates," said our hero, with as much&#xD;
composure as he could muster, "I did not say&#xD;
k one word of what you confided to me, until&#xD;
" after I had discovered the deficiency in the&#xD;
. books. Mr. Going is my witness to this."&#xD;
, All right, sir! It is of course very just&#xD;
o  that a man's character should be picked to&#xD;
e pieces, and his past history used to criminate&#xD;
him before he has been tr.ed or even heard&#xD;
upon the charges against him r"&#xD;
u " We are ready to hear you now," said Wal-&#xD;
s ter, " or we can send for my father, who pre-&#xD;
r ferred not to meet you unless you desired to&#xD;
e  speak to him."&#xD;
- " No!t no 1" cried the old man, hastily. "Mr.&#xD;
s Going has been very kind to me! I know that&#xD;
y his heart is bleeding from this blow, for it is&#xD;
I; a blow to an honest man to find that an old&#xD;
I friend has become a villain. I would not se&#xD;
;him now. I would not accept Ihis pity and&#xD;
of forgiveness should he offer it to me, and if lhe&#xD;
&#xD;
too has turned against me. I could not boor&#xD;
the reproaches of the one who has for thirty&#xD;
years been my only friend, besides your&#xD;
lamented grandfather."&#xD;
His voice quavered and broke down, he&#xD;
made an effort to subdue his emotion, but&#xD;
with a convulsive sob, it broke restraint, and&#xD;
le hid his thee to conceal his tears.&#xD;
"Come, come," said    Mr. Stump, good-&#xD;
naturedly.&#xD;
This Come, come," is quite a by-word with&#xD;
the noble profession of detectives. It is in-&#xD;
tended to express pity, and to make a show of&#xD;
a soft heart, but its real meaning might be put&#xD;
in these words:&#xD;
"Caome, come, don't cry, for it's no use, and&#xD;
I'm not to'be humbugged. Don't make any&#xD;
disturbance or I'll handcuff you-don't waste&#xD;
my valuable time    by making    a  scene.&#xD;
That is quite played out with me, I have seen&#xD;
it tried on too often."&#xD;
All this lurks behind those little words, and&#xD;
much depends upon the tone in which they&#xD;
are said. If spoken in warning accents, and&#xD;
rather stern, they portend prospects of club-&#xD;
bing; but Mr. Stump had a good job on hand,&#xD;
a job which was bound to pay him, hand-&#xD;
somely, and he felt that he could afford to be&#xD;
good-natured.  His "Come, come," might be&#xD;
translated as follows :-&#xD;
"My dear fellow, the circumstances sur-&#xD;
rounding this melancholy event are very touch-&#xD;
ing. They touch my pocket, and your feelings,&#xD;
so cry away and lose my time so much as you&#xD;
think proper."&#xD;
"Has the Italian girl received large sums&#xD;
asked Walter Going, again. after a pause, in-&#xD;
tentionally disregarding the old man's dis-&#xD;
tress.&#xD;
"She has not," was the reply.&#xD;
"Which statement is corporate by herself,"&#xD;
corroborated Mr. Stumps, who had wasted time&#xD;
on neither grammar nor dictionary.&#xD;
"So you have arrested her, too ?" asked&#xD;
Martin Bates, raising his head.&#xD;
"Not at all, sirl" Why you hadn't ought to&#xD;
think me so unpolite!I 1 only had a leetle&#xD;
friendly chat with her this morning."&#xD;
"Poor Simonetta!" sighed the ex-cashier.&#xD;
"Poor what?" said   Mr. Stump.   "The&#xD;
Eye-talian gal I know of goes by the name of&#xD;
Net Mariner or Meriny, and lives near the&#xD;
'Dirty Spoon,' in Cherry street, so it can't be&#xD;
the same name"&#xD;
It is the same one," said Martin Bates,&#xD;
wearily. Her name is Maria Simonetta Marini,&#xD;
and her father is an organ-grinder."&#xD;
"I knowed he was a musical man," an-&#xD;
swered Mr. Stump, somewhat puzzled " but&#xD;
that Net was christened all what your call her,&#xD;
I didn't know. Well she swears she has no&#xD;
money, and cries because somebody won't&#xD;
let her marry you. She's a pretty girl, that&#xD;
Net!"&#xD;
While rattling away, Mr. Stump has his&#xD;
sharp eyes fastened on Martin's face. The&#xD;
old man'seemed rapidly sinking into a state of&#xD;
apathy; Montant could not bear to look at&#xD;
him. Disappointed in love at the moment&#xD;
ef apparent success, ruined in every sense ; his&#xD;
only friends changed into prosecutors, this&#xD;
4&#xD;
&#xD;
was his situation is the world, the world that&#xD;
had snarled at him all his life.&#xD;
" And who has the fifteen thousand dollars,&#xD;
which you say we can recover ?" asked Walter&#xD;
Going.&#xD;
" That Mr. Muller, who proposed to sell you&#xD;
his farm in Hocus County. Do you remember&#xD;
when he and Mr. Stilletto came here to lay the&#xD;
project of forming a mining and manufacturing&#xD;
company before you and your father ?"&#xD;
Certainly."&#xD;
" Well sir, I advanced August Muller fifteen&#xD;
thousand dollars upon the Hobgoblin farm,&#xD;
thinking it would be quickly sold for an enor-&#xD;
mous sum, in which case I would have doubled&#xD;
my money, and have repaid you the whole&#xD;
thirty thousand dollars. You may believe&#xD;
this-you may not. Every thing is immaterial&#xD;
to me now l"&#xD;
There was an utter despondency in his quiet&#xD;
monotonous voice that carried conviction with&#xD;
it.&#xD;
" And the other fifteen thousand," said&#xD;
Walter.&#xD;
"I have answered that question before,"&#xD;
said Martin,.doggedly. The other fifteen thou-&#xD;
sand dollars were taken before I knew August&#xD;
Muller, and it has simply gone-gone, forever,&#xD;
sir. If you are wise you will buy that Hob-&#xD;
goblin farm, and carry out August Muller's&#xD;
projects. It will cost you but little more than&#xD;
the lien you will have on it through the money&#xD;
I stole from you. But you will make an im-&#xD;
mense fortune out of it. This, gentlemen, is&#xD;
all the confession I have to make. You have&#xD;
lost fifteen thousand dollars through me, and&#xD;
I am prepared to serve out the punishment&#xD;
for my crime. The only favor Lask is never&#xD;
to be confronted with Air. Going."&#xD;
" And how have your books been kept for-&#xD;
merly ?" asked Walter Going, with a dark look.&#xD;
" We had no time last night to examine very&#xD;
far back."&#xD;
" Thirty thousand is all, sir," answered Mar-&#xD;
tin Bates. "Of course, I can not expect you&#xD;
to believe my word. I have believed gentle-&#xD;
men's words, gentlemen, who were not felons,&#xD;
and even then I have been deceived. Never-&#xD;
theless, I repeat, that up to a very few years&#xD;
ago, your books and cash were kept lion,&#xD;
estly."&#xD;
*      *      *      *      *&#xD;
One of the results of the interview just de-&#xD;
scribed, was that Ernest Montant felt very&#xD;
blue and despondent, and he accused himself&#xD;
bitterly to the junior partner.&#xD;
" If my sense of duty is to be so exacting as&#xD;
to turn me into a sneaking busybody, a spy&#xD;
and general informer, and if this ismy nature,&#xD;
I believe that earnest, straightforward villainy&#xD;
would win me more respect."&#xD;
" Perhaps you would have preferred the&#xD;
whole thing to remain undiscovered, and to&#xD;
have had another fifty added to this thirty&#xD;
thousand dollars ?"&#xD;
"You do not mean that question seriously,"&#xD;
answered the other, "but I can assure you&#xD;
that I would give much had I baffled him in&#xD;
an open fight instead of such strategy as I have&#xD;
employed against him."&#xD;
"I will be honest with you," replied Walter&#xD;

Going, with a pleased expression. " I think&#xD;
that, after the risk you have run, no one can&#xD;
impugn your courage. From my own feelings,&#xD;
which were none of the pleasantest, while we&#xD;
were engaged in that night expedition, behind&#xD;
the old man's back, I can believe that it was&#xD;
as unpleasant as dangerous. We would not&#xD;
have done it; but for our duty toward my&#xD;
father, so let us comfort ourselves with the&#xD;
result which shows its necessity."&#xD;
Montant accepted this conclusion, for his&#xD;
good sense forbade his giving way to over-&#xD;
strained scruples ; but, this was another ex-&#xD;
perience in life, and taught him that one's&#xD;
best instincts may so clash with the highest&#xD;
duties as to threaten our peace of mind like&#xD;
the pangs of wounded conscience.&#xD;
We shall again hear of Martin Bates, and per.&#xD;
haps the old man may appear in a better light.&#xD;
According to Mr. Going's express wishes,&#xD;
his crime was kept quiet, and after the firm&#xD;
had recovered what they could of the thirty&#xD;
thousand dollars, he was allowed to leave the&#xD;
city, to vanish, in fact, no one knowing where&#xD;
he had gone, or expecting to see him again.&#xD;
It will be remembered that Martin Bates,&#xD;
according to his confession, had advanced fif-&#xD;
teen thousand dollars to August Muller, taking&#xD;
as security a transfer of the Iobgoblin farm in&#xD;
Pocus township, county of Hocus, State of&#xD;
New York.&#xD;
"I shouldn't wonder if it was at Martin&#xD;
Bates's suggestion, that Muller and Stilletto&#xD;
first sought my services to induce you to buy&#xD;
this farm," said Ernest to Walter, " and if he&#xD;
then urged them, to call in person."&#xD;
" Most likely," answered Walter, " for if&#xD;
we had bought it, Bates would have got his&#xD;
money back, and could have repaid us half&#xD;
our loss. Or if Muller had allowed him to&#xD;
double his money, he might have refunded the&#xD;
whole amount. This is about what lie said&#xD;
his intentions were, I believe. But what do&#xD;
you suppose made him advance this money to&#xD;
Muller in the first place ?"&#xD;
"Muller is a very plausible man, and I have&#xD;
no doubt that Bates thought he saw his way&#xD;
plainly certain to bring him out of his difficul-&#xD;
ties. I believe he honestly thought that lie&#xD;
would double his last venture and then repay&#xD;
the whole."&#xD;
"So do I; and now we will try to get Mul-&#xD;
ler to sign that farm over to us. I have just&#xD;
received a note from Mr. Paradise, to whom&#xD;
I sent the securities given to Martin Bates, in&#xD;
which lie says that they are not in proper&#xD;
shape; that we should have a trust-deed di-&#xD;
rect from Muller. I think we will let Mr.&#xD;
Stump pay a visit to our noble knight of the&#xD;
red nose, who is probably not the most honest&#xD;
man in the world, and see if we can not fright-&#xD;
en him into refunding us the cash, instead of&#xD;
saddling us with the property. If we get the&#xD;
farm, I suppose we shall have to build a small&#xD;
factory, and then we may work the thing to&#xD;
advantage."&#xD;
"I would rather lose the whole amount,&#xD;
than enter upon the most expensive, and most&#xD;
tantalizing of all business enterprises," saig&#xD;
our hero, quickly. "And that is, buildind&#xD;
a factory outside of your kegitimate businressl A&#xD;
&#xD;
practical man, who works himself, and knows&#xD;
his trade thoroughly, may, in a course of years,&#xD;
see his shanty grow into a huge palace of la-&#xD;
bor, for he is the soul of his shop, and his&#xD;
shop may grow as the boy into manhood; but if&#xD;
you want to ruin a commercial house, induce&#xD;
them to undertake building a factory and go&#xD;
into manufacturing without knowing any thing&#xD;
about the business."&#xD;
Walter said nothing. Never before had his&#xD;
young friend offered advice or even volun-&#xD;
teered an opinion upon business matters, so&#xD;
he was the more astonished at this rapid&#xD;
speech and the energy with which it was&#xD;
enunciated. Though nothing further on the&#xD;
subject was said at the time, he never forgot&#xD;
it, and, in after years, saw the wisdom of Er.&#xD;
nest Montant's opinion.&#xD;
Mr. August Muller was inhaling the aroma&#xD;
of his coffee, sipping a little now and then, and&#xD;
convincing himself that his hand was not shak-&#xD;
ing as he lifted the cup; though the cup cer-&#xD;
tainly did shake violently.&#xD;
His costume consisted of a dressing-gown&#xD;
and smoking-cap, and he was smoking a long&#xD;
pipe, with a tassel dangling from the stem,&#xD;
precisely like that which ornamented the cen-&#xD;
ter button of his smoking-cap. The philoso-&#xD;
pher was pale this morning, and the seediness&#xD;
of his garb did not misrepresent the state of&#xD;
his health and spirits. "I must raise money,"&#xD;
he soliloquized.  "Yes, money is the only&#xD;
doctor that can cure my complaint, but when&#xD;
you send for him lie don't come, having too&#xD;
many patients on hand, I presume, and, when&#xD;
he does come, he does not stay long enough&#xD;
to do much good by his benign presence. This&#xD;
is a very passable simile," he continued, much&#xD;
pleased with himself. "I must write it down&#xD;
somewhere. What a man is lost to thee, oh,&#xD;
thou frivolous world, in August Muller ! Does&#xD;
any one know    his talents?  Has he been&#xD;
brought forward to fame and greatness as he&#xD;
deserved?   No, he is allowed to sink lower&#xD;
and lower into slow-killing poverty, and to&#xD;
fade away. Yes, indeed, I am sick, dying! I&#xD;
think half a glass of that fine-" he rises,&#xD;
trembling, from his chair, and gazes eagerly&#xD;
about the room. " I certainly think a glass or&#xD;
two of bitter beer-they brew it quite drink-&#xD;
able in Philadelphia now-Where is it? Has&#xD;
my darling wife- " bere he smiled viciously,&#xD;
'has she hidden the bottles? Not here-not&#xD;
there." And after looking awhile longer, still&#xD;
in vain, his face changes and he mutters some-&#xD;
thing in which the emphasis falls somehow on&#xD;
"darling wife," "a stout club," and "a good&#xD;
thrashing," in strange connection. He was- is&#xD;
terrupted by the ringing of the door-bell, and&#xD;
stepped into the hall to admit the visitor.&#xD;
"Mr. Miller, celebrated as the great philoso-&#xD;
pher of the present risin' gineration ?" asked&#xD;
a little, stout man, with a round, smooth face,&#xD;
in a pleasant voice, as he removed his bran-&#xD;
new beaver, and entered the front door.&#xD;
"If you are not attempting to be witty, Sir,&#xD;
you are perfectly correct," answered Muller,&#xD;
grandly. "If you presume to attempt to ridi-&#xD;
cule rne I scorn the effort and its author."&#xD;
"Jokin' is jokin' and business is busmess,'&#xD;
said the little man, soothingly. "Now I have&#xD;
&#xD;
come on business and I would like to have a&#xD;
talk with you. My name is Stump."&#xD;
"Walk in, Mr. Stump, and partake of Au-&#xD;
gust Muller's hospitality. Your offense is for-&#xD;
given. August Muller is easily won over. It&#xD;
is his nature to be easily won over."&#xD;
They were seated in the little parlor, the&#xD;
same in which, on a previous occasion, the&#xD;
philosopher exhibited his educational prac-&#xD;
tices in the persons of his children.&#xD;
"Will you have a glass of bitter Philadel-&#xD;
phia ale, Mr. Stump?" asked the host. "I do&#xD;
not feel quite well this morning-and-I-"&#xD;
" All right, Mr. Intellect, I'm agreeable,"&#xD;
said Mr. Stump, who was surveying the room&#xD;
and its owner with great curiosity. So the&#xD;
ale was brought by the " darling wife," who&#xD;
had red eyes, as though from recent weeping;&#xD;
but August Muller looked at her with a con-&#xD;
trolling energy, which had the effect of mak-&#xD;
ing her quail and tremble and smile.&#xD;
" That smile looks bad," thought Mr. Stump..&#xD;
"That 'ere smile," lie repeated to himself with&#xD;
great energy, "means brutal, beastly treat-&#xD;
ment, and total subjugation of that female, by&#xD;
means of physical force," which eloquent and&#xD;
finely-rounded sentence pleased Mr. Stump to&#xD;
that degree that lie smiled himself into the&#xD;
best of humors.&#xD;
After they had drank their beer, Mr. Stump&#xD;
said:-&#xD;
"1 might make a long introduction and I&#xD;
feel some like it, because the words come to&#xD;
mae somehow this imornin'. My head is clear,&#xD;
just the same as yours, which is the result of&#xD;
not having a drop to drink in twenty-four&#xD;
hours or so, I suppose."&#xD;
Mr. Stump was looking up at the ceiling&#xD;
and Muller scanned his complacent face in vain&#xD;
to see whether this was meant for sarcasm;&#xD;
but-he answered curtly,-&#xD;
" To business, if you are ready. My time&#xD;
is- '&#xD;
" Exactly." interposed Mr. Stump, pleasant-&#xD;
ly. " Which reminds me of what my father&#xD;
once told me. Father was a farmer, lived&#xD;
away out back here in New York State. Well,&#xD;
father always said, 'talking is talking, but&#xD;
money buys the land,' and, speaking of-land,&#xD;
tell rme what about that emoneyl which bought that&#xD;
land, giner'lly known as the Hobgoblin frsn, sit-&#xD;
ywasted in Hocus County, Empire State."&#xD;
In speaking the last words, his whole man-&#xD;
ner changed. His round, smiling face grew&#xD;
rigid and hard; his little blinking eyes settled&#xD;
Upon the other's face as if they would bore&#xD;
into Iis skull; and he suddenly leaned forward&#xD;
toward Mr. Muller, to watch him more closely.&#xD;
The latter, alarmed by the sudden change and&#xD;
approach, started back so as to nearly overturn&#xD;
his chair; yet his countenance did not betray&#xD;
any guilty fear, and, after recovering from the&#xD;
slight Shock to his weakened nerves, he said,&#xD;
with his old, sickly smile.-&#xD;
"I can not discuss business matters of such&#xD;
a nature with one, who though a guest at my&#xD;
table, is a total stranger to me. Mr. Stump, I&#xD;
must decline to answer until I have the pleas-&#xD;
uire of 'making your acquaintance, as Mr. Toots&#xD;
save in Dombey."'        --.&#xD;
"Well, then, Mr. Miller, let me tell you the&#xD;
&#xD;
50&#xD;
&#xD;
FACT.&#xD;
&#xD;
whole story in two words, and then we'll un-&#xD;
derstand each other. Listen. There was an&#xD;
old man, one Martin Bates-"&#xD;
"I do not think that name is altogether&#xD;
unfamiliar to my ears," murmured the&#xD;
philosopher, with a twist of his head as&#xD;
though he would be delighted to hear the sound&#xD;
again.&#xD;
"'Nor I," cried Mr. Stump, with a knowing&#xD;
wink. " Well, this old man stole fifteen thou-&#xD;
sand dollars from his employers."&#xD;
" Dear me!" exclaimed Mr. Muller, raising&#xD;
his eyebrows in apparent astonishment.&#xD;
"And you knew it!" continued Mr. Stump,&#xD;
with a friendly nod and smile.&#xD;
"Sir, do not insult me I" said the philoso-&#xD;
pher, "I knew nothing of the sort. August&#xD;
Muller's name and reputation-&#xD;
" Did not prevent him from selling to this&#xD;
Martin Bates, Esquire, cashier of Messrs. Go-&#xD;
ing &amp;amp; Son, this 'ere Hobgoblin farm for fifteen&#xD;
thousand dollars, when he, the said August&#xD;
Miller, knew that said Martin Bates was poor,&#xD;
and, consequently, could not have raised the&#xD;
soap by honest and square dealing." This was&#xD;
said with great determination and in a single&#xD;
breath, after which he favored Mr. Muller with&#xD;
some more friendly nods and knowing winks,&#xD;
and waited for a reply.&#xD;
Mr. Muller thought a long while and then&#xD;
said:-&#xD;
"I have studied the law, Mr. Stump, and&#xD;
can inform you, with great certainty, that&#xD;
should your design and intention be to indict&#xD;
me for receiving stolen goods, or money fraud-&#xD;
ulently obtained, or embezzled-should you&#xD;
attempt to prove this you have no case! In&#xD;
the language of the law, you have no case, sir."&#xD;
"Now listen," resumed Mr. Stump. "After&#xD;
August Miller has obtained this money, he dis-&#xD;
covers that one of Mr. Going's clerks, Moun-&#xD;
tain by name-"&#xD;
" Montant," corrected the philosopher,&#xD;
" Well, then, Mongtang," continued Mr.&#xD;
Stump, "is a friend of a certain Mr. Staletoe."&#xD;
" Mr. who ?" asked Muller, in genuine doubt.&#xD;
" Mr. Staletoe, or Stealto, or-"&#xD;
"I presume, Mr. Stump," said the philos-&#xD;
opher, patronizingly, " that, in consequence of&#xD;
the failure of those whose duty and privilege&#xD;
it was to watch over the years of your youth,&#xD;
to make your education a specialty, you are&#xD;
rather unfinished, if I may so express it, in&#xD;
your capacity for pronouncing foreign names.&#xD;
I will help you. You mean Mr. Stilletto."&#xD;
"Just so. Well, you and Mr. Stilletto tried&#xD;
to get Mr. Mongtang to help you to persuade&#xD;
the Goin's to buy this Hobgoblin farm, in&#xD;
which case Mr. Bates would have got his&#xD;
money back."&#xD;
"And quite an honorable dealing it would&#xD;
have been."&#xD;
"Yes; but this young Mongtang didn't&#xD;
quite see it in, that light, nor wouldn't have&#xD;
nothing to do with you, nor would the Mes-&#xD;
seoors Goin' see it in that light, nor would they&#xD;
have nothing to do with you when you and&#xD;
Staletoe went and tried it on with them at&#xD;
their office."&#xD;
Muller nodded.&#xD;

scowl, gradually fell into these regular habits&#xD;
of work, and it was principally he, assisted&#xD;
heartily by our hero, who performed the duties&#xD;
of head-cashier.&#xD;
The old gentleman's face grew care-worn,&#xD;
and his son displayed an energy, born of grave&#xD;
necessity, for the house was laboring through&#xD;
a period of heavy losses and great expenditure.&#xD;
Disaster crowded in from all sides, while the&#xD;
ready cash they could procure was steadily&#xD;
absorbed in a new enterprise of such magni-&#xD;
tude that the solvency of the house depended&#xD;
upon its ultimate success.&#xD;
Messrs. Going &amp;amp; Son had bought the Hob-&#xD;
goblin farm in Hocus County, township of&#xD;
Pocus. They had bought Stilletto's patents&#xD;
and had almost completed a large factory. The&#xD;
construction of this factory had already cost&#xD;
four times the original estimate, and was still&#xD;
only a huge bill of expense; but the prospect-&#xD;
ive profits were--unprecedented.&#xD;
And for this, they had neglected their legit-&#xD;
imate, safe business, almost ontire4y. One of&#xD;
the most respectable houses in the city, they&#xD;
had been inveigled into this wild scheme by&#xD;
such men as Stilletto, Muller, and Stump, and&#xD;
only one man, and lie too young to be heeded,&#xD;
had protested against it. When the transac.&#xD;
tion was completed, Ernest Montant felt that he&#xD;
had no object left, but to do hi~s share toward&#xD;
weathering the storm he had so -clearly fore-&#xD;
seeB.&#xD;
But now we find the family enjoying a day of&#xD;
rest, a glorious September Sunday, at the&#xD;
Priory.&#xD;
Good luck to you, Mr. Going, presiding over&#xD;
your guests' entertainment. The golden sun&#xD;
streaming in at the bow window and shedding&#xD;
lus or around your venerable silvered head the&#xD;
while. The gracious spirit of hospitality is en-&#xD;
t ironed upon your forehead ; kindliness and&#xD;
god-willto all men shine in your eyes, as you&#xD;
survey the good gifts before you, for which you&#xD;
have just thanked God with a few simple, but&#xD;
heart-felt words of grace.&#xD;
As his eves wander with satisfaction over&#xD;
the shining 'plate and sparkling glasses, they&#xD;
send a glance of recognition to each decanter,&#xD;
holding different colored wines, glowing in the&#xD;
light oftthe September sun, that originally&#xD;
gave thr growth and warmth and strength&#xD;
while yet in the bosom of their beautiful&#xD;
nether, the grape. But his eyes rest upon&#xD;
the fairer face of his daughter, at the opposite&#xD;
end of the table, and they exchange a look of&#xD;
love and affection, in which the soul comes&#xD;
forh and gives a new expression to his face.&#xD;
A, Ms5 Jeasie, may it be many happy years&#xD;
&#xD;
before your father's chair stand empty in your&#xD;
sight i&#xD;
Mr. Fatman, the banker, is here, apparently&#xD;
glorying in his Falstatllan proportions, for he&#xD;
is in a good humor. A dozen tiInesthis morn-&#xD;
ing has lie repeated that the Priory is a "pala-&#xD;
tial residence, truly a palatial residence, Mr.&#xD;
Going," and then, to himself, that he would&#xD;
really like to own the Priory, just as if lie did&#xD;
not consider it quite beyond the range of&#xD;
possibility that he should own it some day 1&#xD;
Mr. Paradise, the hunchbacked lawyer, was&#xD;
also present. His Mephistophelean face wore&#xD;
an expression of epicurian satisfaction, and his&#xD;
remarks were almost polite.&#xD;
Walter Going twisted his long whiskers and&#xD;
signified his physical happiness by sipping his&#xD;
wine with extra gusto and telling stories of&#xD;
racing, boxing, and hunting, until Miss Jessie&#xD;
begged to be informed if lie knew of no sub-&#xD;
ject more generally interesting.&#xD;
Qn either side of Miss Going, sat Mr. Faro&#xD;
and Ernest Montant, but to-day she favored&#xD;
the latter so markedly that Mr. Faro was&#xD;
dumb, and wondered in his inmost soul if he&#xD;
were ever to smile again.&#xD;
Mrs. Fatman, late the baker's daughter, was&#xD;
the only lady present besides Miss Jessie.&#xD;
The dinner went off pleasantly, and the&#xD;
ladies retired, later than is usual, for Miss&#xD;
Jessie enjoyed sitting with her father and&#xD;
brother while they were smoking, and as for&#xD;
Mrs. Fatman, she became accustomed to man's&#xD;
vices ong ago. Finally the two ladies arose&#xD;
and were followed by our hero, who had re-&#xD;
ceived notice of a prospective walk im the&#xD;
garden with Miss Jessie, and by Mr. Faro,&#xD;
who had determined to revenge himself by&#xD;
withdrawing his superb attentions from Jessie,&#xD;
and flirting with Mirs. Fatman.&#xD;
Thus Mr. Paradise and Mr. Fatman were&#xD;
left alone with Going aiid Son. These two&#xD;
were among the few of the mercantile world&#xD;
who knew of Martin Bates's embezzlement, arid&#xD;
of his sudden disappearance.&#xD;
" What has become of him any way ?" asked&#xD;
Mr. Fatman.&#xD;
" At last accounts, and those reached me&#xD;
only casually, he had gone to Massachusetts&#xD;
on a visit to his brother, Judge Bates," replied&#xD;
Mr. Going.&#xD;
"I never understood that fellow," said Mr.&#xD;
Fatman.&#xD;
" I understand him very well," said the&#xD;
'hunchback, tersely.&#xD;
" Then you are wiser than I," growled Mr.&#xD;
Fatman.&#xD;
"Which is neither improbable nor very&#xD;
complimentary," replied Mr. Paradise. " From&#xD;
their profession, lawyers are accustomed to&#xD;
look a little deeper and read a little further in&#xD;
the difficult book of men's characters."&#xD;
"And also to investigate the contents of&#xD;
their purses less disinterestedly," returned&#xD;
Mr. Fatman, who knew that his only safety&#xD;
consisted in giving the hunchback a " broad-&#xD;
side" whenever a chance offered.&#xD;
" Quite, right," the latter" answered, dryly,&#xD;
and not at all displeased. " What a charming&#xD;
repartee! So very witty i Well, I have come&#xD;
to the conclusion that Bates stole the first&#xD;

FACT.&#xD;
&#xD;
fifteen thousand, to give to somebody else. I&#xD;
am quite certain of it."&#xD;
The other gentlemen looked at him in in-&#xD;
quiring wonder.&#xD;
" Don't stare at me so," cried Mr. Paradise,&#xD;
ill-humoredly. "I know I'm a curiosity, but&#xD;
I won't be stared at, especially when you want&#xD;
to stare me into telling you what I haven't the&#xD;
least idea of telling any one. So please pass&#xD;
the wine, Going, and don't be ridiculous.  I&#xD;
shan't tell you another word."&#xD;
"I believe you have been my counselor for&#xD;
twenty years, Paradise," said Mr. Going,&#xD;
gravely ; "and it occurs to me that we might&#xD;
recover that money yet, if a third party-"&#xD;
" Twenty years your counselor, and yet&#xD;
I won't say another word about it; no, nor&#xD;
wouldn't if it was a hundred and fifty years,"&#xD;
interrupted the hunchback, with offensive&#xD;
sharpness. "If you think that I would with-&#xD;
hold the name of this third party when the&#xD;
money could be recovered, well and good. In&#xD;
that case you had better take your business&#xD;
away from Graves and Paradise and give it to&#xD;
Van Sachenach, Precedent and Bailiff, that's&#xD;
all."&#xD;
Mr. Going made no reply. He was accus-&#xD;
tomed to the usual acerbity of the hunchback,&#xD;
and knew well enough that, could it promote his&#xD;
interest, his lawyer, who was at the head of&#xD;
his profession, would have told him all about&#xD;
the matter without the asking.&#xD;
Mr. Fatman was less easily satisfied; but as&#xD;
he knew that nothing could open the lawyer's&#xD;
lips when once closed, he snuffed and turned&#xD;
up his nose with disgust and changed the&#xD;
subject.&#xD;
" How about Hobgoblin, Mr. Going," he&#xD;
asked.&#xD;
" hobgoblin," replied the old gentleman,&#xD;
with a forced smile, which did not conceal the&#xD;
nature of his thoughts, seemss to me like a&#xD;
dog given to a poor man. He may be but a&#xD;
puppy at the time, but he grows, gentlemen,&#xD;
he grows larger and larger, and finally eats&#xD;
his owner out of house and home. Now I do&#xD;
not mean to say that I expect to find this&#xD;
creature called lobgoblin, possessed of such&#xD;
an appetite as to eat me out of house and&#xD;
home ; but-"&#xD;
"I should think not," said old Fatman,&#xD;
leaning - back in his chair, and complacently&#xD;
viewing the scene around him.    "For a&#xD;
place like this, a truly palatial residence, sir,&#xD;
as I have before remarked, is not so easily&#xD;
swallowed."&#xD;
" And not so easily digested after you have&#xD;
swallowed it," said Mr. Paradise, attentively&#xD;
examining his napkin ring.&#xD;
" You are right, Paradise," replied Mr.&#xD;
Going, biting his lips. "It is a place which&#xD;
may ruin the financial health of its possessor&#xD;
forever 1"&#xD;
" A palatial residence," murmured Mr. Fat-&#xD;
ham, sotto voce. thinking to himself, "I would&#xD;
like to have it. I could digest it, and perhaps&#xD;
-perhaps I will have it some day !"&#xD;
" But as I intenfted to say," continued their&#xD;
host, ".when I bought that farm and the mines,&#xD;
I thought I was only reimbursing myself. It&#xD;
only cost me ten thousand, cash!'&#xD;
&#xD;
" A mere trifle," said Mr. Fatman, ab.&#xD;
stractedly.&#xD;
"A mere drop in the bucket," added the&#xD;
lawyer.&#xD;
"Right again," said Mr. Going, with anoth-&#xD;
er forced smile, "A mere drop in the bucket&#xD;
to what I have paid out on it since ! I calcu-&#xD;
lated that I would build a little factory as an&#xD;
experiment, and the little factory has grown&#xD;
like the poor man's dog-grown over my&#xD;
head-"&#xD;
"Keep your head above it at all costs," cried&#xD;
Mr. Paradise, striking the table with his fist,&#xD;
for beneath all his sarcasm he was a true&#xD;
friend of his client.&#xD;
" I have thrown so much good money after&#xD;
bad," said Mr. Going, gloomily, " that I may&#xD;
as well try it a little longer. I shall not go&#xD;
too far, rely upon it, and besides, in a short&#xD;
time there will be an income.from the sale of&#xD;
our manufactures."&#xD;
"Yes," cried Mr. Paradise, " and for every&#xD;
dollar that goes into your pocket, two or three,&#xD;
or a dozen, will come out of it. That's my&#xD;
opinion.&#xD;
" Why don't you employ'that man Stilletto,&#xD;
Mr. Going?" asked Mr. Fatman, " I under-&#xD;
stand you have paid him thousands of dollars&#xD;
for his patents, and now you employ another&#xD;
superintendent. I should think he, the in-&#xD;
ventor, would be the proper man to work his&#xD;
own machinery."&#xD;
"I can not endure the man," answered Mr.&#xD;
Going. "lie is coarse, a libertine, and exceed.&#xD;
ingly loose in money matters. I acknowledge&#xD;
that his talents are considerable ; but you&#xD;
know the proverb, 'le that meddles with&#xD;
pitch is certain of defilement.' His very na-&#xD;
ture is too foreign to mine to admit of his em-&#xD;
ployment by me."&#xD;
" Pooh, pooh !" said Mr. Fatman, "Don't&#xD;
you employ dirty brokers and dirty agents&#xD;
every day of your life?"&#xD;
" Yes-but that is only in isolated cases.&#xD;
Here. I will be almost obliged to associate&#xD;
with a man who has not the first quality of a&#xD;
gentleman, neither has he the worthy simplic-&#xD;
ity and exceeding honesty which alone make&#xD;
men of low degree my moral equals and&#xD;
worthy of my confidence. We have a mon-&#xD;
strous undertaking on our hands, and the re-&#xD;
suilts may not only be very profitable, but suc-&#xD;
cess will couple my name honorably with the&#xD;
advancement of enterprise and civilization. To&#xD;
obtain these objects, you will readily believe&#xD;
that I would bend all my energies and sacrifice&#xD;
my personal inclinations ; but, I will not em-&#xD;
ploy a man whose very name is sufficient to&#xD;
bring disrepute upon the whole establish-&#xD;
ment."&#xD;
"I would employ him if his services were&#xD;
likely to help the business, and I would not&#xD;
if they were not," said Mr. Fatman, curtly.&#xD;
There was a pause in the conversation.&#xD;
Every one seemed to be in a bad humor. Sud.&#xD;
denly, Mr Fatman cried,--&#xD;
" I have an idea."&#xD;
" A miserable one, I'll wager," said the law-&#xD;
yer.&#xD;
" Make a stock company of the whole e0n-&#xD;
cern; sell your shares and come out whole&#xD;
&#xD;
55&#xD;
&#xD;
and hearty," cried Fatman, without heeding&#xD;
the interruption.&#xD;
"Limited liability, of course !" sneered the&#xD;
hunchback. "Oh, yes. Capital ideal  Lim-&#xD;
ited liability, limited capacity, limited capital,&#xD;
limited attention on the part of one half of&#xD;
the directors, limited understanding on the&#xD;
part of the other half, and limited honesty on&#xD;
the part of the promoters and managers. Fin-&#xD;
ally, very limited success, and not a cent in&#xD;
the end for the shareholders That is the true&#xD;
English for that great national English word&#xD;
which you see stuck up on half the sign-boards&#xD;
in LondonI"&#xD;
They all laughed ; but Mr. Going thought&#xD;
it need not be so in all cases, and Mr. Fatman's&#xD;
idea was not negatived by the lawyer's sharp&#xD;
scrutiny. Finally, they all agreed to meet&#xD;
somewhere in town and talk the matter over&#xD;
more fully.&#xD;
In the meanwhile, our hero and Miss Jessie&#xD;
were strolling along the beach. The young&#xD;
lady had been talking very seriously, and the&#xD;
old spell was upon him as he watched her in&#xD;
the beautiful splendor of her youth, graced&#xD;
by the mild earnestness of what she had been&#xD;
saying.&#xD;
" What a wondrous world of variety lies&#xD;
hidden in this young breast," he thought to&#xD;
himself. "Flirting and trifling with the host&#xD;
of her admirers,,neglecting, almost ignoring&#xD;
mae, she repels ip at one moment, only to at-&#xD;
tract me more irresistibly at another. A hus-&#xD;
band with a strong will and possessed of her&#xD;
love, would find an endless field in molding&#xD;
her character to what it can and should be.&#xD;
If he could command her emotions and whims&#xD;
so as to call out each in its place, what a deli-&#xD;
cious treat, what a sweetly interesting life he&#xD;
would have before him; for she would never&#xD;
tire him with a flood of vapid sentimentality.&#xD;
In serious moments all trilling and frivolity&#xD;
would vanish away in the generous outbursts&#xD;
of her great heart, while in lighter moments&#xD;
she would charm, fascinate, and bewitch him&#xD;
by her pretty, harmless coquetry."&#xD;
"So you will do it, Mr. Montant ?" she ask-&#xD;
ed, statiding still, and looking imploringly into&#xD;
his eyes.&#xD;
"I don't know what to say," ie answered.&#xD;
unable to bear her gaze. "I feel as if it were&#xD;
a question of manly dignity, and that I ought&#xD;
not to step higher over the body of man&#xD;
whom my craftiness has brought low."&#xD;
"I can not understand how a proud man&#xD;
can stop half-way at any thing. If it was not&#xD;
wrong ,to bring a dishonest man to justice, and,&#xD;
perhaps, save my father from complete ruin,&#xD;
how can it be wrong to step into his place and&#xD;
do right where he has been doing wrong."&#xD;
- "What makes you speak that wayto me ?"&#xD;
asked our hero, perplexed. "It seems strange&#xD;
that you--"&#xD;
"Certainly strange," she replied, "and,&#xD;
probably it is  also  forward, immodest,&#xD;
and, it may be, unwomanly; but my love&#xD;
for papa makes me bold sometimes, and I&#xD;
have often uplifted my little voice in busi-&#xD;
ness matters. I opposed the extravagance&#xD;
of buying the Priory, although it see-ms&#xD;
like pam adise to me. I also opposed this new&#xD;
&#xD;
enterprise, this monstrous, ridiculous Hobgob-&#xD;
lin factory-"&#xD;
" Right - quite right," interrupted  our&#xD;
hero.&#xD;
" If some gray-headed old stick could hear&#xD;
us talking," said Jessie, smiling, "lie might&#xD;
fancy we were children trying to talk wisely ;&#xD;
but I think young people have good ideas,&#xD;
sometimes, as well as the old. But to return&#xD;
to the subject. You once promised me your&#xD;
aid when the time should come.      Look&#xD;
in my father's care-worn face, and tell me-has&#xD;
it come ?"&#xD;
He could not answer her.&#xD;
" You asked me why I spoke thus to you.&#xD;
A woman has no reasons for her action. I&#xD;
have confidence in you-why, I don't know;&#xD;
perhaps, because I know my father has. At&#xD;
any rate, I want to see whether I can accom-&#xD;
plish what I know lie failed to do several&#xD;
months ago. He wants you to be the head-&#xD;
cashier. I ask you to accept. Will you ?"&#xD;
Oh. that " Will you ?" with an encouraging&#xD;
smile, and an enticing toss of the head, and&#xD;
the enrapturing glance of her earnest eyes.&#xD;
Could lie resist? Ifad he, the strong-willed.&#xD;
self-reliant, indomitable man that he thought&#xD;
lie could be,---had he so far resisted the entreaty&#xD;
:f a friend, and must lie yield to the pleading of&#xD;
a woman ? Ile could not conceal from him-&#xD;
ielf that her eloquence, joined to the magic&#xD;
spell of her presence, had melted his strong&#xD;
resolutions long ago, andl he consented to her&#xD;
request. She was grateful, and bestowed upon&#xD;
him such little marks of favor and preference&#xD;
that afternoon, that Mr. Faro vowed revenge&#xD;
weere hope seemed dead, and to induce other&#xD;
fashionable people in Now York to cut the&#xD;
Going's hereafter.&#xD;
CHAPTER V.&#xD;
THE G1I$EN-EYED MONSTER.&#xD;
"Oh! beware, miy lord of jealousy, etc."&#xD;
01u1 LLo.&#xD;
Orn hero had filled the office of cashier in the&#xD;
great house for but a little while, before the&#xD;
friends and business connections of Messrs. Go-&#xD;
ing &amp;amp; Son knew him and respected him in his&#xD;
new capacity. Naturally modest of demeanor,&#xD;
his calm self-reliance was not betrayed into&#xD;
ostentation or arrogance, and as his manner&#xD;
invited confidence, which was never abused,&#xD;
he soon controlled the finances of the house&#xD;
almost entirely. When he first seized the&#xD;
helm, the finances had never been in a worse&#xD;
condition, yet the credit of the old house&#xD;
soon became better than ever. The Goings&#xD;
were considered flsh (as NewYork merchants&#xD;
call it), though they were, in reality, poorer&#xD;
than they had been for many years. Many&#xD;
days there were, when both Walter and his&#xD;
father wore anxious faces as the dreaded&#xD;
hour of three, when the banks close, drew&#xD;
nigh; but the new cashier sent Walter away&#xD;
to "' go imp town," and enjoy himself arid leave&#xD;
the bank account to him. Walter generally&#xD;

56                    GOING AND SON.&#xD;
&#xD;
took the advice, trying to cover his admiration&#xD;
with a scowl; but his confidence in our hero&#xD;
was never impaired. And if the large re-&#xD;
sources of the house would not always come to&#xD;
the rescue; if all foresight and management&#xD;
failed to prevent a short period of great strain&#xD;
and alarming pecuniary pressure, there was no&#xD;
one better adapted to step into a neighbor's&#xD;
office and solicit a loan or obtain a favor from&#xD;
the banks, than Mr. Montant, the cashier, for&#xD;
every one liked him, and every one knew that&#xD;
his word was as good as security. It would&#xD;
have looked strange had Mr. Going personally&#xD;
called for favors, for then people would have&#xD;
magnified the importance of the case, while, on&#xD;
the other hand, Walter was not the man for&#xD;
borrowing. So it was that the finances of the&#xD;
house, the bone and sinew of its existence, de-&#xD;
volved more and more upon Montant, who, as&#xD;
was his nature, bent his whole mind and ener-&#xD;
gy to the task.&#xD;
Meanwhile the Hobgoblin factory was grow-&#xD;
ing and still growing, like the poor man's dog;&#xD;
like some financial monster whose appetite for&#xD;
money increases by what it feeds on, never&#xD;
satisfied, ever hungry, and not to be put oft.&#xD;
People even began to believe in the wisdom&#xD;
of the enterprise. The outwardly prosperous&#xD;
condition of the house, under Montant's man-&#xD;
agement, deadened all unfavorable reports,&#xD;
and before long Mr. Going was believed to&#xD;
have added another gold mine to those which&#xD;
had yielded the material for the structure of&#xD;
the good old house of Going &amp;amp; Son.&#xD;
And while the factory is growing and people&#xD;
are talking and the new cashier is doing finely,&#xD;
just as we should have expected from Ernest&#xD;
Montant, we will take another look at the&#xD;
Priory and see how matters are going on&#xD;
there.&#xD;
A carriage, driving over the bridge, through&#xD;
the park, up to the grand front piazza, with&#xD;
the columns reaching up to the roof and the&#xD;
graceful woodbine encircling and twisting and&#xD;
twining and struggling up along the walls in&#xD;
classic arabesques. Two gentlemen in the&#xD;
carriage and two ladies; two young and pretty&#xD;
ladies, and yet Miss Jessie Going is not there,&#xD;
although the gentlemen we can now recog-&#xD;
nise as her brother Walter and Ernest Mon-&#xD;
tant.&#xD;
Miss Jessie was at the door to welcome&#xD;
them; and her father, with the old chivalresque&#xD;
spirit which but rarely looms up in some spe-&#xD;
cimen of the true gentleman, nowadays,&#xD;
stepped to the carriage to assist them in&#xD;
alighting.&#xD;
"Mrs. Van Strom," he said, as he kissed&#xD;
her softly and affectionately on the forehead,&#xD;
t you are, indeed, a dear and welcome guest&#xD;
here ! and this. I presume, is Miss Bates" (as&#xD;
lie extended his hand cordially to the other),&#xD;
"whom I also greet most heartily. We ofe&#xD;
her kind visit to your persuasions, Mrs. Van&#xD;
Strom, and can only thank you for your friend,&#xD;
madam!l"&#xD;
"Here is the baggage, struggling up the&#xD;
hill," cried Walter, *ho was in high glee. "It&#xD;
may as well take its time about getting here,&#xD;
for I assure you it won't leave us for a good&#xD;
while to come."&#xD;
&#xD;
"I am not so sure, sir," said Josephine Van&#xD;
Strom, with a smile. "We must-"&#xD;
"We must what ?" cried Walter. "Return&#xD;
soon?  Do not lay that flattering unction to&#xD;
your soul, Mrs. Van Strom."&#xD;
"I surely do not wish to speak of leaving&#xD;
this spot, where so much is dear to me," an-&#xD;
swered the widow, and now, the young mistress&#xD;
of the house claimed her greeting with many&#xD;
kisses and welcomes, and they adjourned up-&#xD;
stairs, which brought with it a temporary sep-&#xD;
aration of the male and female constituents of&#xD;
the party.&#xD;
"Who is this coming?" said Walter, as he&#xD;
and our hero were lighting their cigars, prepa-&#xD;
ratory for a stroll to the stables before dinner.&#xD;
"Upon my word it is Faro and Wheeler."&#xD;
And sure enough, those two gentlemen&#xD;
drove up in a dog-cart, drawn by a tandem&#xD;
team, half smothered with harness.&#xD;
" Where did you get that coat, Wheeler ?"&#xD;
asked Walter, when the new visitors joined&#xD;
them, after consigning their horses to the care&#xD;
of a groom.&#xD;
"Ah-Pool and Co.-      ah     London ye&#xD;
knaw     awfully jolly coat, isn't it?  The&#xD;
beastly tailors in this blarsted country can't&#xD;
make a coat to save your life, yo knaw,-&#xD;
ah- '&#xD;
" Wheeler," said Walter, who could not bear&#xD;
him, "you should not talk that way, or'some&#xD;
people might think you were an English-&#xD;
man."&#xD;
"indeed-ahr-been told so-look English&#xD;
ye knaw-parents Britishers ye knaw,"&#xD;
"Yes, your parents were English, only they&#xD;
have lived in New York for two hundred years&#xD;
at least," answered Walter, dryly.&#xD;
"Severe-my friend, severe," conceded Mr.&#xD;
Wheeler, whose great air and object in life&#xD;
was to be mistaken for an Englishman.&#xD;
But never mind, Wheeler," added Walter,&#xD;
"no man of sense will ever take you for an&#xD;
Englishman. Let's go into the house, I'm sure&#xD;
you gentlemen must want something to clear&#xD;
the dust out of your throats."&#xD;
When the ladies had made themselves charm-&#xD;
ing after their long trip (for Josephine Van&#xD;
Strom and Bessie Bates had traveled from Mas-&#xD;
sachusetts that day), they assembled at the&#xD;
dinner-table, and those to whom Miss Bessie&#xD;
Bates was a stranger had an opportunity of&#xD;
examining her closely. A young girl of eight-&#xD;
een.  Not so pretty as finely molded, and&#xD;
thoroughly English in her countenance, she&#xD;
was one of those to whom belong curls, and a&#xD;
dress made more for comfort than for fashion.&#xD;
Blue eyes, auburn hair, and features rather&#xD;
placid and classic than piquant. Ernest Mon-&#xD;
tant compared the three at his leisure.&#xD;
There was Josephine Van Strom, with her&#xD;
golden hair and almost divine eyes; with her&#xD;
superb figure and passionate impulses in every&#xD;
look, every move, every word of her deep alto&#xD;

There was Jessie Going, the picture of a New&#xD;
York belle, all grace and "chic," as the French&#xD;
say. Pretty in every motion, all life and glow-&#xD;
i-g beauty in her black hnir and splendid eyes,&#xD;
while Miss Bates, the least attractive at first-&#xD;

&#xD;
have told that this was nothing new; that it&#xD;
had been going on for months. Yes, and that&#xD;
they were even engaged; but Judge Bates, on&#xD;
one cold and dreary winter's day, objected to&#xD;
the match, and Walter was too proud and an-&#xD;
gry to ask any questions. Miss Bessie thought&#xD;
that her father, who was a rigid Puritan, giv-&#xD;
en to total abstinence, probably found it im-&#xD;
possible to give his daughter to a man of the&#xD;
world, whose very manner showed that he was&#xD;
not a saint. Thus thought Miss Bessie, and&#xD;
as Judge Bates had not -fancied the dashing&#xD;
New Yorker from the outset, it is probable&#xD;
that his daughter was correct in her opinion.&#xD;
But another couple are often found in each&#xD;
other's society during that month of October,&#xD;
at the Priory, and they do not seem to care&#xD;
for other companionship. Our hero and Jo-&#xD;
sephine have found each other after a long&#xD;
absence.&#xD;
"Which seemed longer to me than it could&#xD;
have seemed to any man," said the widow,&#xD;
softly, as they wandered along the beach,&#xD;
where the sand lay bleaching in the moon-&#xD;
light, and the autumn wind blew fresh over&#xD;
the swelling waters of Long Island Sound.&#xD;
"I question it," replied our hero, with a&#xD;
happy smile. "I have been- very busy, it is&#xD;
true, and have not been able to write to you&#xD;
as often as I would; but the thought of you&#xD;
has been with all the operations of my mind,&#xD;
and when I have not written as often as I,&#xD;
perhaps, ought, it was because I can not bear&#xD;
to scribble hurried nonsense to you."&#xD;
They visited the rock, where they had been&#xD;
seated on that bright afternoon in the spring,&#xD;
when they met for the first time. They spoke&#xD;
of their engagement.&#xD;
"I would be proud and happy to have our&#xD;
love acknowledged before the world," he said,&#xD;
" but I have reasons which move me to pre-&#xD;
fer, for the present, that we should keep it a&#xD;
secret. You do not doubt my love for you,&#xD;
Josephine?  You should not doubt."&#xD;
"No," answered Josephine, hesitatingly,&#xD;
"not if I were once for all certain-"&#xD;
le stopped her by a rapid motion, seizing&#xD;
her hands, a nd held her in front of him, while&#xD;
his eyes flashed.&#xD;
" Do not look at me like that," she implored.&#xD;
" I do not mean-I do not know-oh, 1 am a&#xD;
foolish woman;" and instead of explaining&#xD;
herself, the fondness of her heart overwhelm-&#xD;
ed her, and she laid her head on his shoulder.&#xD;
She nestled there for some time and neither&#xD;
of them spoke. Closer and closer she clung&#xD;
to him, and at last he felt her convulsive&#xD;
sobs on his breast.&#xD;
" What is this, Josephine ?" he asked, with&#xD;
evident emotion. " Have I occasioned your&#xD;
sorrow ?"&#xD;
"No," she murmured, "but the fear comes&#xD;
over me that I may lose you! And if I do,"&#xD;
she cried, in agony at the very thought, "God&#xD;
is neither just nor mercifulI"&#xD;
Montant was appalled. His conscience was&#xD;
not altogether clear, and he decided in a mo-&#xD;
ment.&#xD;
" Josephine, let us declare our engagement&#xD;
at once. Let the whole world know it. I am&#xD;
ready."&#xD;
&#xD;
She looked up at him, the tears still in her&#xD;
eyes. The old Madonna face!1&#xD;
" And now," he added, affectionately and&#xD;
soothingly, "tell me what has put that non-&#xD;
sense into your head."&#xD;
She placed her lips close to his ear, and whis-&#xD;
pered as though even Nature might hear it, and&#xD;
betray the secret,-&#xD;
"She is jealous of you!"&#xD;
" Who ?" asked our hero, thanking his lucky&#xD;
stars that it was not daylight, for his face&#xD;
flushed crimson.&#xD;
"Jessie Going."&#xD;
"Nonsense, my dear."&#xD;
" Say nonsense as long as you please," she&#xD;
answered; "but I tell you the eyes of love&#xD;
can see through every thing! She watches&#xD;
you, she watches me, is absent-minded and&#xD;
pale.  When you speak to her, her face&#xD;
lights up with smiles; but if any one else&#xD;
addresses her,.she is almost cross. To me&#xD;
she is studiously polite and cheerful; but I&#xD;
can see through it all-see through it all."&#xD;
Well for you Josephine, that you could not&#xD;
see his face. Well for you that his knitted&#xD;
brow, his firm-set lips are hidden from you by&#xD;
the merciful shadow in which he stands,&#xD;
while he reads your face upturned to his in&#xD;
the full moonlight.&#xD;
With an almost superhuman effort of re-&#xD;
pression, he'stopped the tumultuous beatings&#xD;
of his heart. Yes he knew it was true ! He&#xD;
knew it now, although his modesty had here-&#xD;
tofore prevented him from reading the signs&#xD;
Josephine now   so mercilessly pointed out.&#xD;
Hundreds of little incidents, unnoticed at the&#xD;
time, now came to his mind in a clamorous&#xD;
crowd, each corroborating the other's evidence,&#xD;
each crying out " Jessie Going loves you, and&#xD;
you, fool, have been blind to it."&#xD;
With a sickening sensation as if some&#xD;
cherished thing were torn from him by the&#xD;
act, he drove away the image which the&#xD;
mouth of another had thus brought before him ;&#xD;
showing it in enticing proximity, within his&#xD;
grasp, but yet lost forever. With a hoarse&#xD;
voice, which no effort could soften immedi-&#xD;
ately, he said,-&#xD;
" Let's cut this foolery all short; to-morrow&#xD;
we'll tell the world that we love each other,&#xD;
and then our road must be clear I"&#xD;
After this speech he found it possible to be&#xD;
calm, and they strolled about until very late.&#xD;
Could any man hear her speak, laying her&#xD;
heart open before him with all its boundless&#xD;
wealth of affection; could any man see her,&#xD;
in her beauty, ready to give to him body and&#xD;
soul, and not be-reconciled to his lot ?&#xD;
He became satisfied, and she doubted him no&#xD;
longer. Of her own free will she proposed&#xD;
that they should still keep their secret, rather&#xD;
than hasten a public engagement, when he had&#xD;
reasons for postponing it.&#xD;
And so it happened, that, although his heart,&#xD;
had warned him that he was playing a danger-&#xD;
ous game, they determined finally to adhere to&#xD;
secrecy. If he had seen as they reached the&#xD;
house at a late hour, if he had heard a window&#xD;
overhead close softly, as they stepped upon the&#xD;
piazza, perhaps he would have had more mis-&#xD;
givings as to the proof his heart was to under-&#xD;
&#xD;
go. But had he known that a woman left the&#xD;
window, where she had sat all the evening wait-&#xD;
ing for them, and thrown herself upon her bed&#xD;
and wept bitterly, he would have made his en-&#xD;
gagement public at once, or renounced osephine&#xD;
then and there.&#xD;
But who would have thought it of Jessie&#xD;
Going, the light-hearted belle of the city, the&#xD;
happy young girl of seventeen, who had such&#xD;
a host of admirers?&#xD;
Next morning broke in a flood of autumnal&#xD;
glory. It was Sunday, and Mr. Fatman and&#xD;
Mr. Paradise drove out to take dinner at the&#xD;
Priory, which, with the two lady guests made&#xD;
up a pleasant party, and merriment ran high.&#xD;
The widow, Miss Jessie, and Miss Bates looked&#xD;
charming, and, for some reason, Miss Jessie&#xD;
was in the best of spirits, flirting with Faro&#xD;
and Wheeler, and .exchanging repartees with&#xD;
Mr. Paradise.&#xD;
So the dinner went off sparklingly, and the&#xD;
younger people went out on the lawn, while&#xD;
the elders talked business over their wine.&#xD;
That day it was decided, in a short final dis-&#xD;
cussion, that Hobgoblin should be turned into&#xD;
a stock company. Further, that Mr. Fatman&#xD;
should be president. Mr. Paradise'a trustee,&#xD;
and Mr. Stilletto, manager of the factory, with&#xD;
Mr. August Muller for engineer. Mr. Going&#xD;
was to remain in the back ground, because, as&#xD;
the selling party it was considered advisable&#xD;
that his name should not appear.&#xD;
"But then," said Mr. Fatman, with fat in-&#xD;
tensity, " we will go hand in hand, Mr. Going,&#xD;
hand in hand, you know!1"&#xD;
And after Mr. Fatman had delivered himself&#xD;
of that great sentiment he leaned back in his&#xD;
chair and surveyed the room at his leisure,&#xD;
muttering to himself. " A palatial residence!&#xD;
Indeed, a palatial residence l" And then, he&#xD;
added in the faintest of whispers, hardly formed&#xD;
in the deepest recesses of his fat heart, " I&#xD;
would like to have this place ! I may yet have&#xD;
this place!/ I THINK  I WILL HAVE TnIs&#xD;
PLACE I"&#xD;
"Now it is all settled, and I am glad of it,"&#xD;
said Mr. Going, rising. Followed by his guests,&#xD;
he stepped out upon the piazza, where a que-er&#xD;
sight awaited them.&#xD;
Sounds of laughter and merriment reached&#xD;
them from the lawn, where the three ladies&#xD;
and four gentlemen were having a grand jolli-&#xD;
fieation as if they were again irresponsible&#xD;
children. Some time previous Miss Jessie had&#xD;
received from her brother a present of two&#xD;
very small and very shaggy black ponies, and&#xD;
they furnished the means for this extraordinary&#xD;
hilarity.  At Walter's suggestion they were&#xD;
brought from the stable, hurdles were made of&#xD;
ropes and boards, and a hurdle race was in-&#xD;
augurated, Walter and Ernest volunteering to&#xD;
act as jockeys. Owing to the diminutive size&#xD;
of the steeds, they could not ride them, so each&#xD;
seized the bridle of his nag, and at the word&#xD;
'go," they started, the young men doing their&#xD;
best, and the ponies, excited by the noise,&#xD;
stretching their legs to the utmost. Amid&#xD;
the laughter and shouts of their admirers, they&#xD;
dashed across the lawn-now Walter ahead ;&#xD;
now our hero; now Walter strumbles and rolls&#xD;
on the grass, nearly capsizing his pony; but&#xD;
&#xD;
there! he is up again in time to leap the hurdle,&#xD;
which costs the' pony a violent effort, and&#xD;
away they go again after the other. And so&#xD;
they go over the hurdles, sometimes one a head,&#xD;
sometimes the other, till, after a close home-&#xD;
stretch, Walter is declared the winner by a&#xD;
neck," amidst great applause and waving&#xD;
of handkerchiefs. Bets were now made, the&#xD;
race repeated, and the ladies became quite ex-&#xD;
cited over their favorites, so finally a " flat "&#xD;
race, without hurdles, was arranged between&#xD;
Miss Bates and Jessie, which Miss Bates won&#xD;
in fine style, much to her gratification, and to&#xD;
the honor of her pony.&#xD;
The autumn wind made free with the loose&#xD;
tresses of the ladies, and their faces were in a&#xD;
ruddy glow with the exercise, so that when&#xD;
the ponies were led away there was a healthy,&#xD;
happy air about the whole party, making a&#xD;
pretty picture with their many-colored dresses&#xD;
on the bright green lawn.&#xD;
Mr. Going stood at the door and watched&#xD;
them for a long time. His eyes passed from&#xD;
one graceful form to another, from one radi-&#xD;
ant, lovely face to another; but dark and un-&#xD;
pleasant thoughts crowded upon him, and&#xD;
silent tears gathered unbidden, as he gloomily&#xD;
fancied how soon this scene of grace and hap-&#xD;
piness might close or change to one of bitter&#xD;
tribulation. And he lifted his heart to God in&#xD;
silent prayer, that he might be permitted to&#xD;
leave a home like this, secured to his children&#xD;
when his time to bid the world a lasting fare-&#xD;
well should come.&#xD;
And again the thought of the dangers now&#xD;
surrounding him, surged through his brain,&#xD;
and a deep gloom overshadowed his soul.&#xD;
CHAPTER VI.&#xD;
BORN A VAGABOND.&#xD;
*what the devil art tho ?"&#xD;
One that will play the devil."&#xD;
Kise Joani.&#xD;
Ma. ANTONIO STILLETTO was alone in his&#xD;
room, whose only article of elegance was a&#xD;
large mirror in an ostentatious gilt frame.&#xD;
The carpet shone in a variety of loud colors,&#xD;
but the material was inferior. The furniture&#xD;
had once been fine, but it was now broken and&#xD;
dirty, and the linen on the pretentious bed was&#xD;
soiled. The whole suited well its occupant ;&#xD;
as lie sat musing by the window, dressed in a&#xD;
velvet coat, which showed only a sad want of&#xD;
brushing, shirt, collar and culls nearly black,&#xD;
while his torn slippers revealed a pair of stock-&#xD;
ings in a most uninviting condition.  His&#xD;
hands seemed to beg for soap and water, his&#xD;
finger nails needed a hoe, though his hair had&#xD;
been dyed a glossy brown that very morning,&#xD;
giving his head that peculiarly vulgar, barber-&#xD;
shop appearance, which distinguishes the true&#xD;
New   York snob.   The room   was strewn&#xD;
around with broken trinkets, old combs and&#xD;
brushes, opened letters, half-torn and crumple.I&#xD;
papers, sine of them very yellow, others of&#xD;
rosy liue and exhibiting femintine handwriting,&#xD;
while here and there was a carpet-bag or port-&#xD;

manteau, which looked as if broken open by&#xD;
burglars and rifled of their valuables, so con-&#xD;
fused were the heaps of wearing apparel of&#xD;
all sorts and stages of filthiness which appear-&#xD;
ed at their gaping mouths.&#xD;
So the room and its contents suited well&#xD;
the man, and his soliloquy was of a piece with&#xD;
the rest. Mr. Stilletto had the blues, and as&#xD;
he racked his brains to find a way out of his&#xD;
present condition, his sharp face wore a look&#xD;
of unmistakable villainy, which might have led&#xD;
a casual observer to imagine that the plans&#xD;
contemplated by him savored of treacherous&#xD;
craftiness. He had not yet been informed of&#xD;
his appointment as superintendent of the&#xD;
Iiobgoblin Manufactory, by its president, Mr.&#xD;
Fatman.&#xD;
"I wonder what reasons the old fool has,"&#xD;
mused Mr. Stilletto, meaning, by that compli-&#xD;
mentary term, Mr. Goimg. " I wonder what&#xD;
that old fool has against me! le buys my&#xD;
patents and then refuses to employ me to run&#xD;
the factory. And here I am, all the money&#xD;
spent, and no income to keep me alive. Some-&#xD;
thing must be done, and that soon, for here is&#xD;
that old hag bothering my life out, for my board,&#xD;
and I do hate to leave these fashionable quar-&#xD;
ters! I suppose old Muller would take me in&#xD;
again; but what would some of my friends say&#xD;
if they discovered that this house does not be-.&#xD;
long to me, as they are fools enough to believe.&#xD;
Tradespeople, women, gamblers, horsemen,&#xD;
and all trust me because they think the house&#xD;
belongs to me, and my debts are of a na-&#xD;
ture which requires coaxing and some harmless&#xD;
white lies. Still, what fun it would be to&#xD;
clear out and leave them to open their eyes,&#xD;
and rub their noses, and scratch their heads!1&#xD;
But it is not time for that yet. No! no! When&#xD;
the time comes to give them the grand shake, I&#xD;
know somebody who will make a, big haul be-&#xD;
fore he bids an affectionate farewell to this&#xD;
great city of New York I At the same time,&#xD;
what is to be done now ?" he asked himself in&#xD;
great perplexity. "Dress myself in style I"&#xD;
was the answer.   "Whereupon I shall feel&#xD;
more like myself and show a bold front. Noth-&#xD;
ing in the world like a bold front when the&#xD;
main army is weak and the enemy strong,&#xD;
though easily humbugged."&#xD;
So he commenced his process of Adonizing.&#xD;
He washed himself, that is his ablution began&#xD;
with his hands, and-ended there, for the very&#xD;
excellent reason that his hands alone could be&#xD;
seen besides his face, which had already been&#xD;
treated with eau de cologne and bay rum at the&#xD;
barber-shop. Ile next kicked his slippers into&#xD;
one corner of the room and pulled on his pat-&#xD;
ent-leather boots without even giving a thought&#xD;
to his stockings-for who cares what is under-&#xD;
sseath a shining boot in this world of outward&#xD;
display?  Then came a search for something&#xD;
which necessitated a general overhauling of&#xD;
portmanteaus and drawers, and a wild scatter-&#xD;
ing of articles which should have been consign-&#xD;
ed to the washerwoman long before. Mr.&#xD;
Stilletto searched and swore, and swore and&#xD;
searched, until the major part of the carpet was&#xD;
covered with the subsur~face part oflhis wardrobe.&#xD;
Finally, he was successful in his search and&#xD;
triumphantly produced a '"dickeg," i.e. so much&#xD;
&#xD;
of a shirt as appears to the public from under&#xD;
a vest, and which only is a brevet shirt. This&#xD;
adjusted to his liking, a paper collar, the sur-&#xD;
face enameled to resemble, linen, was pinned&#xD;
on. Then came some more searching and&#xD;
some more swearing until he found his cravat,&#xD;
of the genius "butterfly," consisting of a piece&#xD;
of yellow satin, ready made into a bow. This&#xD;
piece of false pretence he adorned with a very&#xD;
large California diamond pin, but his panta-&#xD;
loons were immaculate, his vest was simply&#xD;
sublime, and his enormous watch-chain very&#xD;
well gilt (the watch was silver, but kept well&#xD;
out of sight). When he had brushed his vel-&#xD;
vet coat lie was was ready for a promenade.&#xD;
A knock at the door. Mr. Stilletto paid no&#xD;
attention to it, for lie was giving the "finish-&#xD;
ing touch "in front of the pier glass in the&#xD;
gilded frame. A double knock. Mr. Stilletto,&#xD;
lost im admiration of himself, disdained to heed&#xD;
it. Three distinct, sharp, angry raps. Mr.&#xD;
Stilletto evidently heard them and also recog-&#xD;
mzed the outsider, for his eyes sparkled with&#xD;
anger and his under lip began to quiver. His&#xD;
finely cut mouth could assume a pleasant, al-&#xD;
most fascinating smile when be chose ; but now&#xD;
lie did not feel very amiable.&#xD;
"I know you are inI" said a sharp, unmusi-&#xD;
cal voice, through the key-hole.&#xD;
"Why the devil don't you come in, then ?"&#xD;
retorted Mr. Stilletto, with a sneer. " You&#xD;
don't suppose I lock my door against such as&#xD;
you, do you, Mrs. Hart ?''&#xD;
The door was opened violently, Mrs. Hart&#xD;
stepped in determinedly, stood still, cast her&#xD;
eyes about the room, and slammed the door&#xD;
behind her. Stilletto had not honored her&#xD;
with a look, but continued the review of his&#xD;
toilet at the mirror. Mrs. Hart was a tall,&#xD;
gaunt creature of fifty, with a very yellow&#xD;
complexion, very black eyes, false curls, and a&#xD;
black lace cap. Determination was her forte.&#xD;
Determination spoke in her voice, flashed in&#xD;
her eyes, and marked her manner, as she now&#xD;
took a chair unbidden.&#xD;
"Do sit down, Mrs. Hart," sneered Stilletto,&#xD;
his back still turned to her, while he watched&#xD;
her through the looking-glass.&#xD;
" Thank you, I am seated, sir, and, what is&#xD;
more, I intend to keep my seat."&#xD;
"I think I will change my dress, after all,"&#xD;
muttered Stilletto, quite loud enough for her&#xD;
to hear. "These pantaloons are too heavy for&#xD;
this weather."&#xD;
"I hope you don't mean-" cried Mrs. Hart,&#xD;
bouncing to her feet.&#xD;
"To use my room when I want to, in spite&#xD;
of an impudent hussy ?" asked Stilletto, turn-&#xD;
ing upon her with an ugly grin. " Why, cer-&#xD;
tainly I mean to."&#xD;
" Your room, is it? Where is my money? It&#xD;
is not your room until you pay your rent,'&#xD;
you-"&#xD;
"No impudence. Mrs. Hart, or you will make&#xD;
me mad, and then I'll break your neck."&#xD;
" Pay your rent. I want my money."&#xD;
"Go to hell," said Stilletto, quietly producing&#xD;
his cigar case.&#xD;
"I1 won t stand it any longer," cried Mrs.&#xD;
Hart, livid with rage. "You are being the&#xD;
death of me ! This room is like a pig-styc.&#xD;
&#xD;
All sorts of disreputable characters sneak in&#xD;
here to see you and ruin my reputation."  t&#xD;
" Your reputation !" said Stilletto, lighting a t&#xD;
cigar.&#xD;
"Yes, sir, I am a respectable woman, and t&#xD;
ry daughter's grown up, and I have respecta-i&#xD;
ble people living in my house-"&#xD;
"Ad you want me to marry your daughter,&#xD;
and I won't do it," interrupted Stilletto, in-the&#xD;
same quiet tone. As his landlady grew more&#xD;
wrathful he assumed an air of unspeakably&#xD;
calm impertinence, though his under lip quiv-&#xD;
ered more and more, and his color changed&#xD;
somewhat in the course of this conversation.&#xD;
"You lie," shrieked Mrs. Hart, whereupon&#xD;
Stilletto, without moving a muscle of his face,&#xD;
stepped to the door, turned the key, put it in&#xD;
his pocket, and took a heavy walking cane&#xD;
from a corner. Then he sat down in a chair,&#xD;
facing Mrs. Hart, laid the weapon across his&#xD;
knees and continued smoking, staring directly&#xD;
into her eyes. le had queer eyes. Bold be-&#xD;
yond description, shameless beyond concep-&#xD;
tion, crafty and cruel beyond imagination, they&#xD;
spoke his real nature in moments like the&#xD;
present.&#xD;
Mrs. Hart resumed her seat, as if pushed&#xD;
suddenly by a force she could not resist, and,&#xD;
wavering between fear arjd rage, gave vent to&#xD;
her mingled emotions by the womanly expo-&#xD;
nent of both, a copious flood of tears. Stilletto,&#xD;
no whit moved by this display, looked up at&#xD;
the ceiling as if lie preferred that view to the&#xD;
one before him.    -&#xD;
" You almost choked me in this very room&#xD;
once," blubbered Mrs. Hart, "and I have no&#xD;
doubt you would like to give me an unmerci-&#xD;
ful beating, though I am only a weak wo-&#xD;
"Certainly," admitted Stilletto, nodding -as-&#xD;
sent. "'Unmerciful beating' is good, and quite&#xD;
appropriate."   -&#xD;
And then," said Mrs. Hart, ceasing her&#xD;
crying and grinding her teeth, " if I had you&#xD;
arrested and sued you for assault and battery,&#xD;
you would bring that nasty Dutchman, that&#xD;
Tombs lawyer, to help you out, and it would&#xD;
cost me money instead of yourself. He is the&#xD;
man that wrote out that accursed lease--"&#xD;
"According to which you lease meo this room&#xD;
for a year, so that you can't kick me out as&#xD;
long as I pay my rent every month."&#xD;
"Yes, and how have you paid it?  You are-&#xD;
fused to pay-I sued you-got a warrant, and&#xD;
when the thing had cost me twenty dollars,-&#xD;
just as I was going to have you 'kicked out,'&#xD;
as you say, and well you deserve it-you paid&#xD;
up! Oh, oh, my heart is broke with you I"&#xD;
and here the woman, who was generally an&#xD;
imperious, self-willed creature, being entirely&#xD;
conquered by heriamiable lodger, burst into a&#xD;
-piteotis fit of crying.&#xD;
" If you don't stop that I'll choke you worse&#xD;
than the first time."&#xD;
" Mrs. Hart, wmo was a powerful woman,&#xD;
and at least a head taller than Stilletto, became&#xD;
desperate at this inhuman threat. She sprang&#xD;
from her chair and seized the first thing within&#xD;
her reach. It happened to be an empty cham-&#xD;
pagne bottle, for Mr. Stilletto amid hsis friends&#xD;
were fond of that beverage, when in posses-&#xD;
&#xD;
sion of sufficient funds to purchase it. With&#xD;
this weapon she was about to make a fierce at-&#xD;
tack upon him, when loud knocks wore heard&#xD;
at the door. With a look of intense malice at&#xD;
the woman, Stilletto jumped to the door and&#xD;
unlocked it to admit witnesses to the scene-&#xD;
which was just what he wanted. Mrs. Hart,&#xD;
comnprehiending his motives, was incensed to&#xD;
perfect fury, and threw the bottle at his head.&#xD;
He escaped by dexterous dodging, and the bot-&#xD;
tle grazed the head of Mr. August Muller, the&#xD;
"Dutch Tombs lawyer," of Mrs. Hart's pre-&#xD;
vious sorry acquaintane, who was just enter-&#xD;
ing the room. The philosopher, with a cry of&#xD;
fear, retreated so suddenly that he knocked&#xD;
against the detective, Mr Stump, who was&#xD;
closely following him, and they both rolled on&#xD;
the floor, while Mrs. Hart stood trembling from&#xD;
the effects of her passion; but appalled by the&#xD;
mischief she had done. Stilletto threw himself&#xD;
into a chair and burst into a peal of laughter.&#xD;
" Gentlemen," stammered Mrs. Hart, " real-&#xD;
ly, gentlemen, I must beg your pardon-"&#xD;
 "Which I aint a-going for to grant, for one,"&#xD;
cried Mr. Stump, in a rage, as he picked him-&#xD;
self up and seized her by the arm. " You air&#xD;
my priz'ner, marm, that's what you air." At&#xD;
which Stilletto laughed again; nor (lid the&#xD;
sight of Mr. Muller, unable to recover his per-&#xD;
pendicular immediately, cause his hilarity to&#xD;
cease.&#xD;
Mrs. Hart expostulated ; but for a long while&#xD;
in vain. Mr. Stump declared himself to be an&#xD;
assaulted officer, and showed his badge, and&#xD;
badgered the poor woman until Stilletto felt&#xD;
exhausted with laughter, and stepped up,&#xD;
saying.-&#xD;
"Stump, let me speak to her a moment." HiO&#xD;
took her aside, and whispered in his most&#xD;
threatening manner:-&#xD;
" Now look you! You have insulted me&#xD;
this morning. If I let that policeman take you&#xD;
to the station house, you can just bet it 'will&#xD;
cost you a hundred dollars to get out again;&#xD;
for you know me, don't you? and with my&#xD;
lawyer for a witness against you, I will make&#xD;
you pay handsomely for your impudence to&#xD;
me. But I'll not be too rough on you. You just&#xD;
sign your name to this bill for last month's&#xD;
rent, and I'll let you oft. It's only thirty dol-&#xD;
lars, so don't be long about it!"&#xD;
"I'd rather go to state's prison, you-" cried&#xD;
the outraged landlady.&#xD;
"Stump," said Stilletto, "arrest this woman.&#xD;
Muller and I will appear against her to-nor-&#xD;
row. 'Till then, she can sleep in the station&#xD;
house."&#xD;
" Mercy !" shrieked the poor woman. "Mer-&#xD;
cy! gentlemen. I'm innocent. Oh! oh ! the&#xD;
villain-the brute is going to be the death of&#xD;
me!"&#xD;
e "Will you sign?" whispered Stilletto, fiercely.&#xD;
"No!" cried Mrs. Iart; but when Mr.&#xD;
Stump approached, she whispered a hurried&#xD;
" Yes! yes! Any thing-my life if you like-&#xD;
and you're sure to have thatin the end;" and&#xD;
thus Mr. Stilletto paid his rent, in a mariner at&#xD;
once novel, and highly satisfactory to his purse&#xD;
and his self-esteem.&#xD;
-" And now," said Mr. Muller, after Mrs.&#xD;
Hart had frantically rushed down stairs-a few&#xD;

GOING AND SON.&#xD;
&#xD;
words from Stilletto had changed the anger of&#xD;
the new-comers into merriment-" I will tell&#xD;
you what brought us here. It is all right."&#xD;
"What is all right, you idiot ?" asked Mr.&#xD;
Stilletto, impatiently. "Instead of ogling me&#xD;
in that manner, and grinning like a goblin,&#xD;
damn it. I wish that you would explain your-&#xD;
self at once as sensibly as you can."&#xD;
"IHobgoblin is all right," grinned Mr. Muller.&#xD;
"It's all a Limited Liability," explained Mr.&#xD;
Stump, wisely.&#xD;
" A  Joint Stock  Company," cried  Mr.&#xD;
Muller.&#xD;
"And Fatman is President, and Anthony&#xD;
Staletoe is Manager," added Mr. Stump.&#xD;
" Do you mean me, by that vulgar name ?"&#xD;
"I do," replied Mr. Stump, "and I wish you&#xD;
many congratulations."&#xD;
With a cry of joy, Stilletto rang the bell&#xD;
violently; and after a few more hurried partie-&#xD;
ulars had been given him, the servant made&#xD;
her appearance. With the first impulse of men&#xD;
of his stamp upon receiving good news, he&#xD;
cried:-&#xD;
" Run around to Delmonico's, and buy me&#xD;
three bottles of champagne: here is the memo-&#xD;
randum on this bit of paper."&#xD;
" Yis, sur; but sure, sur, where's the money&#xD;
to pay for it, sur?"&#xD;
" That's a fact; I forgot that. Here, con-&#xD;
found it, I haven't got any money. Muller,&#xD;
lend me twenty dollars."&#xD;
"Come to August Muller for friendship, for&#xD;
advice, for sympathy in affliction or in joy;&#xD;
but co're not to him for money, for he has&#xD;
none."&#xD;
" You are always poor," said Stilletto, with&#xD;
an oath. "Stump, lend me twenty dollars."&#xD;
" Detective  officers are  always flushI"&#xD;
answered that worthy, producing a well-&#xD;
rounded pocket-book. " The trade brings it."&#xD;
"I dare say it does," answered Stilletto, with&#xD;
a sneer, as lie took the note from his fat&#xD;
fingers. "Now run, Bridget, and bring me&#xD;
back the change, or I'll wring your neck first,&#xD;
and Mrs. Hart's afterward."&#xD;
The girl left hurriedly, and soon returned.&#xD;
Stilletto threw off his coat, and the three were&#xD;
soon deep in the more detailed discussion of&#xD;
Hobgoblin and iced champagne. Stilletto's&#xD;
spirits rose.&#xD;
"Now, then, my star is in the ascendency,"&#xD;
he cried. " And we will see if I can't make&#xD;
that old fool of a Going pay for what he has&#xD;
done to me!I"&#xD;
The discussion lasted till daylight began to&#xD;
fade away, when Mr. Muller said:-&#xD;
" At nine o'clock to-night we are to be at the&#xD;
house of Mr. Fatman, the President."&#xD;
" I will meet you there, but I have an en-&#xD;
gagement first. It suits me quite well to go,&#xD;
for my engagement is right on the way."&#xD;
" What sort of an engagement may this be,&#xD;
you wild youth?' asked the philosopher.&#xD;
The " wild youth" laughed a coarsely insin-&#xD;
uating laugh; but vouchsafed no further expla-&#xD;
nation.&#xD;
*    *    *    *    *    *     *&#xD;
Mr. Fatman's hobby was, giving expensive&#xD;
dinners to a few very select friends. Although&#xD;
&#xD;
he knew ow to knit his brows, be imperious,&#xD;
overbearhg, and pompous to people below him&#xD;
in station, or at his mercy in the course of&#xD;
business, yet few more jovial hosts could be&#xD;
found.&#xD;
About seven o'clock, of the evening in which&#xD;
he expected Stilletto, Muller, and Stump, to&#xD;
discuss "lHobgoblin," he was entertaining Mr.&#xD;
Paradise, the hunchback, and another gentle-&#xD;
man, Mr. Chip, at dinner.&#xD;
Mr. Chip, familiarly styled "old Moneybags,"&#xD;
by his numerous friends and acquaintances, on&#xD;
account of his immense wealth, was a meek&#xD;
little man, and sat at the table more like a&#xD;
tolerated poor relation than a millionaire, whom&#xD;
Fatman was determined to court and fawn&#xD;
upon.&#xD;
Mrs. Fatman was dressed ip splendidly,&#xD;
with her best set of teeth, and newly-arranged&#xD;
false hair-her figure stuffed out and hemmed&#xD;
in, and laced and screwed up to perfection--&#xD;
her eyes sparkling and large, from a judicious&#xD;
combination of belladonna and eau-dc-cologne,&#xD;
altogether presenting the semblance of the&#xD;
handsome woman she had been ten years ago.&#xD;
She was the only lady present, and was seated&#xD;
as hostess, opposite her liege lord, whose god-&#xD;
his stomach-pressed lovingly against the&#xD;
table, forgetting entirely about the legs, dang.&#xD;
ling somewhere underneath.&#xD;
Those poor legs! A life of gluttony had&#xD;
long ago slackened their muscles; and yet they&#xD;
had to carry that lump of a stomach from the&#xD;
house to the carriage, from the carriage to the&#xD;
office, and from one desk in his counting-house&#xD;
to another;-poor legs!&#xD;
And yet over that stomach there sat a head&#xD;
whose brain had not yet died from overfeeding,&#xD;
a head that was a match for most heads that&#xD;
were based on healthier bodies ; and as its&#xD;
owner entertained his company, this head&#xD;
rolled about on its invisible neck, with a pe-&#xD;
culiarly good-natured expression.&#xD;
" Moneybags" was eating with an anxious&#xD;
face, slowly and carefully, being painfully&#xD;
aware of the road to dyspepsia, which lie was&#xD;
traveling. When his enemy warned him of&#xD;
its near approach by a nervous pang, he would&#xD;
quickly gulp some olives or liqueur or some&#xD;
other delicacy to "help the digestion," which&#xD;
generally results in adding to the misery the&#xD;
morrow must bring.&#xD;
Paradise was in high spirits, and conse-&#xD;
quently more impertinent than ever. As his&#xD;
friends did not enjoy a vast amount of intelli-&#xD;
gence, unless on business topics, he would not&#xD;
deign to sharpen his sarcasm on their dull&#xD;
hides ; but concentrated his efforts on Mrs.&#xD;
Fatman whom he had always hated.&#xD;
" I am glad to inform you, gentlemen," cried&#xD;
the fat host, "that I have here some English&#xD;
hare which I imported lately.   They are&#xD;
capital. My dear, will you taste some ?"&#xD;
She did taste some.&#xD;
" Have you not hair enough already, Mrs.&#xD;
Fatman ?" asked the humpback, maliciously.&#xD;
The lady colored a little, but said nothing,&#xD;
venting her anger on a bone of the hare.&#xD;
Paradise, vexed at not having received an an.-&#xD;
swer, returned to the charge. .&#xD;
" Do not bite so hard, I beg of you, Mrs,.&#xD;
&#xD;
Fatman. You might break those pretty teeth&#xD;
of yours I"&#xD;
Enraged at this second attack on her weak&#xD;
points, Mrs. Fatman retorted.&#xD;
"It is safe enough to insult a lady, when&#xD;
her husband is not man enough to chastise the&#xD;
offender."&#xD;
"My darling," cried Fatman, in perfect good&#xD;
humor, " if I did, I might break his back you&#xD;
know, and that would be-"&#xD;
" Sad," interrupted Paradise, " for my back&#xD;
hurts when flogged, I tell you. That is the&#xD;
difference between my humpback and your&#xD;
beautiful bosom, Mrs. Fatman, mine is gen-&#xD;
ulne !"&#xD;
" By-, Paradise," cried Fatman, who prided&#xD;
himself on the good looks of his wife. " That&#xD;
is too much even from you! I .remember that&#xD;
if you rouse me, I might use my powers as&#xD;
master of this house, and give you more than&#xD;
you could swallow."&#xD;
" Well, now, really I do not feel like leaving&#xD;
this comfortable seat," said the humpback, seri-&#xD;
ously, " so we will change the subject. Let&#xD;
us talk about business. Tell me, Mr. Fatman,"&#xD;
he added, with mock gravity, "what are the&#xD;
real prospects of the Hobgoblin Company ? I&#xD;
am to own some of the shares you know, and&#xD;
would sell them if I could get a good price for&#xD;
them."&#xD;
Fatman laughed. Old Moneybags smiled;&#xD;
but an uncomfortable expression came over his&#xD;
timid face.  A  few  sneering remarks were&#xD;
passed on the subject; and then it was dis-&#xD;
missed with universal levity.&#xD;
The dinner progressed, dessert was brought&#xD;
on and removed, and Mrs. Fatman arose to&#xD;
leave the gentlemen to their cigars.&#xD;
"Good evening, gentlemen."&#xD;
" Why do you go so soon, Madam," queried&#xD;
Paradise. " Is it an appointment with a&#xD;
lover ?"&#xD;
How   is this?  Why did she start, turn&#xD;
scarlet, and dart him a look which was full of&#xD;
malice? Had his Parthian arrow struck an-&#xD;
other weak point? In a moment she had&#xD;
swept from the room. Paradise was taken&#xD;
aback. This time he had intended no mis-&#xD;
chief; but his random shot suggested a good&#xD;
deal of mischief to his fertile brain.  He&#xD;
glanced sharply at the two others, and saw&#xD;
they had noticed nothing, and then inwardly&#xD;
chuckled over his new discovery.&#xD;
Mrs. Fatman went down into the kitchen.&#xD;
A man cook, and two waiters, who had been&#xD;
ordered from Delmonico's along with the din-&#xD;
ner, were just preparing to leave the house.&#xD;
" How did Madame like ze deenay?" asked&#xD;
the cook, pulling off his cap.&#xD;
" Oh, very well-are you all through ?"&#xD;
" Oui, madame. Zeese man will come in ze&#xD;
morning to wash ze deeshes.      Bon  soir&#xD;
madame."&#xD;
When the men had closed the door behind&#xD;
them, Mrs. Fatman turned to a tidy looking&#xD;
girl who stood by,-&#xD;
" Maggy; I suppose the other girls have allj&#xD;
gone out, as I gave them leave ?"&#xD;
" Yes, mum."&#xD;
-" Then you can go up stairs to see that the&#xD;
gentlemen have all-they want."'&#xD;
&#xD;
"Yes, mum. He is in the closet." Off she&#xD;
went, with a serene countenance.&#xD;
What did Maggy mean ? Mrs. Fatman did not&#xD;
seem surprised or puzzled by the information;&#xD;
perhaps she had heard that expression before.&#xD;
At all events she looked carefully around,&#xD;
opened the closet door, and out stepped Mr.&#xD;
Antonio Stilletto, quite cheerfully, and as bold,&#xD;
as ever.   Throwing his arms around the&#xD;
banker's wife, he kissed her again and again,&#xD;
without ceremony.&#xD;
But we will not dwell upon the scene.&#xD;
Stilletto sneaked out, after awhile as hie had&#xD;
sneaked in-as he always sneaked through life&#xD;
like an evil spirit of darkness, with all that is&#xD;
contemptible in his character, except cowardice,&#xD;
for his unmeasured boldness, saved him at&#xD;
least from that meanest of vices.&#xD;
Ihardly had Mrs. Fatman readjusted her&#xD;
head-dress and collar, which had suffered some&#xD;
derangement, when there came a very light&#xD;
knock at the door, followed almost instantane-&#xD;
ously by the entrance of Mr. Paradise.&#xD;
"I beg your pardon, madam," he said, "I&#xD;
hope I am not disturbing you." As he spoke&#xD;
he glanced in every corner, and under the&#xD;
table.&#xD;
What do you mean, sir ?" she asked, with&#xD;
assumed haughtiness, though she could not re-&#xD;
press the color that rose to her cheeks, or&#xD;
raise her eyes to meet his piercing gaze.&#xD;
Oh, nothing at all, nothing at till," ho ro-&#xD;
plied, in an off-hand manner, entirely unnatural&#xD;
in hima, for his remarks were generally very&#xD;
pointed. "I only wanted to get some Italian&#xD;
nuts, for the girl up stairs don't know where&#xD;
they are, and she told us the cook was out, so&#xD;
I came for them because I happen to know&#xD;
the little place where they are kept."&#xD;
Whereupon he advaincecd to the closet,&#xD;
whence Stilletto had issueil, and procured what&#xD;
he wanted, while Mrs. Fatruan, stood by in&#xD;
speechless fear doubting in her bad conscience,&#xD;
that he might know all about her secret. But&#xD;
1no course was left to her but to speak him fair,&#xD;
while he in his turn was qmite polite, which&#xD;
was a very suspicious sign in him.&#xD;
Half an hour later, Mr. Muller arrived, and&#xD;
Stilletto followed him, little suspected of his&#xD;
previous visit to the house. These worthies&#xD;
discussed Hobgoblin in earnest with Mr. Fat-&#xD;
man, old Moneybags and Mr. Paradise, and made&#xD;
plans and settled aflairs, although neither Mr.&#xD;
Going or his son had been notilled of the&#xD;
meeting. But then Fatman had said they&#xD;
were going " hand in hand you know I"&#xD;

GOING AND SON.&#xD;
&#xD;
eration, some pleasant, others more threaten-&#xD;
ing.&#xD;
He was not busy, the firm had not been busy&#xD;
for many weeks; indeed the old and reliable&#xD;
banking and commission business had been&#xD;
neglected since all their energy and means had&#xD;
been concentrated upon the giant enterprise&#xD;
that was to determine the fate of the house&#xD;
and of the family-Hobgoblin.&#xD;
It may appear strange; but many business&#xD;
men can corroborate its probability from their&#xD;
own experience-from the time that their legit-&#xD;
imate business was neglected, barely looked&#xD;
after when it demanded attention, every ven-&#xD;
ture connected with it, seemed charged with&#xD;
disaster. Without fault or special neglect of&#xD;
any particular person, losses continued to come&#xD;
in until father and son, in a fit of despondency,&#xD;
determined to wind up their affairs and devote&#xD;
themselves entirely to the Hobgoblin factory.&#xD;
Mr. Going sat musing alone in his private&#xD;
room. This manufacturing business required&#xD;
but little office-work, so the old gentleman&#xD;
watched his cashier, who could be seen at his&#xD;
desk in the next room, working away most&#xD;
assiduously.  Knowing that but little work&#xD;
was necessary at the time, he became curious,&#xD;
and finally stepped up to him and tapped him&#xD;
lightly on the shoulder.&#xD;
"What are you so busy about, Mr. Mon-&#xD;
tant ?" he asked, smiling. " In  these dull&#xD;
times it is quite mysterious to see you so hard&#xD;
at work."&#xD;
"I am making out a complete statement of&#xD;
the affairs of the house, Mr. Going," replied our&#xD;
hero.&#xD;
" What for. For me 7"&#xD;
"Yes, sir, for you.  I have to ask your&#xD;
pardon for presuming to undertake it without&#xD;
orders; but, in the face of the great change&#xD;
about taking place, I am sure you will be&#xD;
pleased to know exactly how you stand, on&#xD;
leaving the old regie."&#xD;
" On leaving the old regime I" repeated Mr.&#xD;
Going, to himself, and after he had gone to&#xD;
rest that night, the dream-god troubled him by&#xD;
putting that sentence into the mouths of&#xD;
hideous monsters, who kept repeating in&#xD;
warning chorus: "On leaving the old regime."&#xD;
"It is all right, Mr. Montant, and I am&#xD;
obliged to you for your attention."  '&#xD;
So saying, Mr. Going once more retired into&#xD;
privacy. le felt very gloomy this morning.&#xD;
The office was unusually still and deserted.&#xD;
Besides the cashier, but one clerk was present&#xD;
and endeavoring to banish sleep by making a&#xD;
list of some papers which did not at all require&#xD;
that operation. The vicious clock in the outer&#xD;
office ticked away determinedly and far too&#xD;
loudly to be pleasant. Where was the life of&#xD;
the once great house?  Where were the nu-&#xD;
merous clerks; where, the constant stream of&#xD;
messengers; where, the prosperous, never-&#xD;
ceasing activity, which had made office hours&#xD;
delightful to him? Martin Bates had proved a&#xD;
traitor to him, and in his place sat a man,&#xD;
whom the old gentleman liked ; but also, it&#xD;
must be acknowledged, feared a little. Yes, he&#xD;
feared him, for he knew that Ernest Montant&#xD;
was bitterly opposed to this Hobgobhin scheme1&#xD;
which was swallowiug the whole firm. And&#xD;
&#xD;
Mr. Going, beneath all his self-imposed hope-&#xD;
fulness and confidence in the mining and man.&#xD;
ufacturing company, felt deep in his heart that&#xD;
his cashier was right."&#xD;
A meek little man, in a plain coat, stepped in.&#xD;
"Good morning, Mr. Chip," said the old gen.&#xD;
tleman, rising, with great politeness. I am most&#xD;
delighted to see you!"&#xD;
"Thank you. Busy ?" asked little " Money.&#xD;
bags," whose acquaintance we made in&#xD;
the last chapter, as one of Mr. Fatman's&#xD;
guests, a millionaire, interested in the projected&#xD;
Hobgoblin Mining and Manufacturing Com-&#xD;
pany.&#xD;
"Not at all, Mr. Chip," said Mr. Going.&#xD;
' " Just now business is very dull."&#xD;
"So I see," replied old "Moneybags," look-&#xD;
ing about hin in an uncomfortable, shy man-&#xD;
ner. "So I see."&#xD;
There ensued an awkward pause. Mr. Going&#xD;
became aware that there was an object in this&#xD;
visit. Mr. Chip fully aware of that object, but&#xD;
not exactly equal to its fulfillment, was silently&#xD;
embarrassed. He rubbed his thin knees, he&#xD;
coughed, drew his handkerchief, employed all&#xD;
the expedients he could think of to gain time;&#xD;
but finally, was completely at a loss, and sat&#xD;
there staring before him, a most discomfited&#xD;
individual.&#xD;
"Dull times, eh !" he suddenly said, in a fit&#xD;
of desperation.&#xD;
"Yes, sir," answered Mr. Going, who was&#xD;
painfully aware of the little man's perplexity.&#xD;
" You see, my old commission business has&#xD;
slackened considerably of late-in fact-"&#xD;
"In fact," interposed Mr. Chip, seeing that&#xD;
Mr. Going was brought to a full stop, "in fact,&#xD;
you have neglected it a little.".&#xD;
" I am afraid so," answered the other, with&#xD;
a sigh.&#xD;
"And you have devoted yourself to the&#xD;
manufacturing business instead ?" asked Mr.&#xD;
Chip, briskly. The ice was thus broken, for&#xD;
this was the subject which he wished to dis-&#xD;
cuss with Mr. Going.&#xD;
" Yes, sir," said the latter, with another&#xD;
sigh.&#xD;
" You know that Fatman has got me to in-&#xD;
vest two hundred thousand dollars in this new&#xD;
company," said the millionaire again, in a hesi-&#xD;
tating voice, and looking at every thing in&#xD;
the room except Mr. Going, " and I wish to ask&#xD;
you plainly, before we sign the final papers,&#xD;
whether-ahem--whether--"&#xD;
" Well, sir?" asked Mr. Going, with a smile.&#xD;
" Whether it might not result more to the&#xD;
credit of us both if we should let the whole&#xD;
thing go back. Nothing is signed yet, you&#xD;
know-"&#xD;
Mr. Going looked earnestly at him for a mo-&#xD;
ment. Something told him that Mr. Chip was&#xD;
not prompted by any selfish motives in coming&#xD;
to him with this new proposition; but he an-&#xD;
swered, cautiously,--&#xD;
"I would not entertain such an idea for a&#xD;
moment, had it come from any one else. There&#xD;
is, undoubtedly, a large fortune in this under-&#xD;
taking."&#xD;
" Yes, as you say-a large fortune," said&#xD;
" Moneybags,". absent-miadedly ; " of course&#xD;
there is-at least it is so supposed."&#xD;
&#xD;
"For we can certainly sell the shares in&#xD;
these speculative times," said Mr. Going, in a&#xD;
tone as if he doubted his own assertion very&#xD;
strongly.&#xD;
. Mr. Chip's manner changed somewhat. He&#xD;
turned his eyes full upon Mr. Going, and bend-&#xD;
ing forward a little, spoke very clearly and de-&#xD;
cisively.&#xD;
"The capital -stock of the company is two&#xD;
millions of dollars. These two millions of dol-&#xD;
lars are all placed in my hands as a security&#xD;
for the advance I make to the company. The&#xD;
two hundred thousand dollars which I ad-&#xD;
vance go toward enlarging your factory, with&#xD;
the exception of fifty thousand dollars which&#xD;
you receive in cash at once. Besides this sum,&#xD;
you receive notes of the company for which&#xD;
no individual is responsible, to the amount of&#xD;
one hundred thousand dollars. These notes&#xD;
may be paid, these notes may not be paid. I&#xD;
decline to be a trustee, preferring to act only&#xD;
as an outside capitalist. As soon as enough&#xD;
stock is sold to repay me my capital, I relin-&#xD;
quish the balance and you get half the shares&#xD;
left. It is to be hoped that the company will&#xD;
pay me my two hundred thousand, and you&#xD;
your one hundred thousand dollars; it is to be&#xD;
hoped that all the shares will be sold, ultimate-&#xD;
ly, in which case you will, make nearly a mil-&#xD;
lion by the transaction; but we had a meeting&#xD;
at Mr. Fatman's house a few nights ago, and&#xD;
that young loafer Stilletto was there, while&#xD;
you were not even invited to look on, Mr. Go-&#xD;
ing, and, to tell you the truth, I don't like the&#xD;
looks of the whole thing. Shall we withdraw ?"&#xD;
It is doubtful whether Mr. Moneybags ever&#xD;
spoke so courageously on a subject which was&#xD;
not an ordinary business transaction. He was&#xD;
always sharp, concise, and clear when he defin.&#xD;
ed any thing'connected with dollars and cents,&#xD;
but he rarely appealed to principles or cau-&#xD;
tioned any one. With him it was "yes" or&#xD;
"no," and what he had settled in his mind was&#xD;
"signed, sealed, and delivered" beyond appeal;&#xD;
but his better feelings had been aroused in be-&#xD;
half of his old friend Going, whom he had&#xD;
always respected very highly. Had he been a&#xD;
man of moral courage and strength of charac-&#xD;
ter he would not have been satisfied with a&#xD;
mere caution. He would have showed Mr.&#xD;
Going all that his clear and impassionate dis-&#xD;
crimination foresaw in this Hobgoblin business,&#xD;
and while denouncing the whole plan in the&#xD;
strong terms it deserved, would have called&#xD;
upon him to keep himself free from the impend-&#xD;
ing danger and possible disgrace.&#xD;
A powerful, fearless appeal like this, and&#xD;
from such a source, would have decided Mr.&#xD;
Going at once, for already he felt worried,&#xD;
anxious, and distrustful, and the right word in&#xD;
the right place only was necessary to root him&#xD;
to the right spot. But Mr. Chip was too timid&#xD;
and weak to speak that word or to give it&#xD;
weight, so when Mr. Going simply said that,&#xD;
"after all, there seems no doubt that the stock&#xD;
will be sold," and that he was certain Mr. Fat-&#xD;
man would really go "hand-in-hand" with him,&#xD;
the millionaire dismissed the subject, thinking&#xD;
that he had done his duty, and after a few ti-&#xD;
rial remarks took a frigid leave.'&#xD;
Mr. Going had no time to consider well this&#xD;
&#xD;
"warning voice" which had spoken but half&#xD;
its import, before another visitor arrived.&#xD;
" Good morning, Paradise" said Mr. Going,&#xD;
extending his hand to the hunchback.&#xD;
" I have that agreement.  Will you sign&#xD;
it?" asked the lawyer with his usual abrupt-&#xD;
nees.&#xD;
" There is no great hurry, I suppose ?" said&#xD;
Mr. Going, with a troubled air, taking the pa.&#xD;
pers from his hands.&#xD;
"If there is any sense in postponing it, you&#xD;
may do so," replied Mr. Paradise, ill-humored-&#xD;
ly. " But since you have gone into this thing&#xD;
against my advice, you may as well sign and&#xD;
be done with it."&#xD;
"Against your advice ?" cried Mr. Going,&#xD;
amazed.&#xD;
"Why, certainly," replied the other, with a&#xD;
sneer, "and allow me to remark one thing&#xD;
which you ought to have learned long ago from&#xD;
its frequent repetition. I know that I am a&#xD;
natural curiosity, but I object to be stared at&#xD;
like a deformed monkey in a show-shop I"&#xD;
"You can not put me off with your non-&#xD;
sense," said Mr. Going, good-naturedly, " so&#xD;
have the kindness to tell ie when and where&#xD;
you honored me with your advice."&#xD;
" Were I dealing with a school-boy, I might&#xD;
assume the warning-cane and mount gold-&#xD;
rimmed spectacles, but when I want to cau-&#xD;
tion you, in respect to your gray hairs, I can not&#xD;
speak so directly. Ridicule suffices to show&#xD;
you the weak points in a clear light without&#xD;
subjecting me to the set phrase of thanks for&#xD;
good advice, which means simply derision or&#xD;
insult, or, at the best, contempt."&#xD;
In the meanwhile, Mr. Going had found a&#xD;
letter inclosed in ,the agreement papers, and&#xD;
opened it for perusal. It was penned in a large,&#xD;
firm handwriting, and read as follows,-&#xD;
"HoBGoBLIN.&#xD;
Messrs. Going &amp;amp; Son-&#xD;
" DEAR Smrs,--Our mutual friend and coun-&#xD;
selor, Mr. Paradise, will deliver you the con-&#xD;
tract upon which we have already agreed, for&#xD;
your signature. I beg of you not to delay this&#xD;
last and consummating act, for we are losing&#xD;
precious time. People's minds are speculative&#xD;
at present. There is an almost unprecedented&#xD;
abundance of money in commercial circles.&#xD;
We must declare a dividend very soon, and&#xD;
sell our stock like hot cakes. Rely on me.&#xD;
We will go hand-in-hand,&#xD;
Yours, very truly,&#xD;
"FATrMAN."&#xD;
"He is a clever, energetic man," said Mr.&#xD;
Going, considerably elated and quite reassur-&#xD;
ed by the tone of the, letter. " I can hardly&#xD;
withdraw with any decency now, even if I&#xD;
wanted to; and I confess that I have as much&#xD;
confidence in this undertaking as ever, in spite&#xD;
of my good counselor's previous advice, and&#xD;
my friend Chip's caution this morning,"&#xD;
" So Moneybag's has been here too ?" asked&#xD;
the hunchback. "Now it might look to an out-&#xD;
sider as if he and I were anxious to wash our&#xD;
hands in innocence, and be able to sa'y, in case&#xD;
the thing should go wrong, ' We told him so&#xD;

&#xD;
before he went into it; but he would not listen&#xD;
to us.' '&#xD;
This inconsiderate, reckless speech, quite&#xD;
characteristic of the lawyer, struck Mr. Going&#xD;
very forcibly; but he had fully determined to&#xD;
persist in Hobgoblin, and did not choose to&#xD;
worry himself any longer about the final re-&#xD;
sult.&#xD;
" I will sign these to-morrow morning," he&#xD;
said, "unless I should find some objectionable&#xD;
points in the wording of the document."&#xD;
"Read it now, and sign it," said Mr. Para-&#xD;
dise.&#xD;
"I do not see the necessity for this great&#xD;
haste," rejoined Mr. Going, calmly.&#xD;
"I am here now to correct any thing which&#xD;
may be wrong," persisted the lawyer. "Do&#xD;
you suppose that I have nothing to do but to&#xD;
wait upon gentlemen's leisure and to be sent&#xD;
away to call again, like a tailor's apprentice ?"&#xD;
"I have no time at present," said Mr. Going,,&#xD;
"and I prefer any way to go over the agree-&#xD;
ment and contract with Walter, before bring-&#xD;
ing any possible defects to your notice."&#xD;
"All right," said the lawyer, rising in his&#xD;
quick, impulsive manner. "Good day. You&#xD;
can send it signed to my office, to-morrow&#xD;
morning, or you can leave it unsigned and&#xD;
throw it into the waste-basket. Fatman, for&#xD;
one, will be very angry, for lie wants to go to&#xD;
work at once. Moneybags is ready to pay his&#xD;
little two hundred thousand to-day, and is go-&#xD;
ing to leave town to-morrow, so you see what&#xD;
your obstinacy is going to do for us in the&#xD;
shape of delay."&#xD;
" Mr. Paradise," answered the ol gentleman,&#xD;
with dignity, "I can not be badgered into com-&#xD;
mitting myself rashly in a matter all-important&#xD;
as this. Your attempt to force me into this&#xD;
signature is not calculated to increase my con-&#xD;
fidence in the wisdom of signing, or in your&#xD;
friendship for inc."&#xD;
"All right, I repeat," answered the hunch-&#xD;
back, opening the door. "You had better let&#xD;
the whole thing go, and back out boldly !"&#xD;
"Your insults I am accustomed to," re-&#xD;
plied Mr. Going, proudly, "but you should&#xD;
know, from your experience in this commu-&#xD;
nity, that no one who respects himself conde-&#xD;
scends to he offended by them."&#xD;
"Good day," said the lawyer, spitefully, and&#xD;
slammed the door after him.&#xD;
" And this is the beginning of this great&#xD;
company" thought the old gentleman, bitterly.&#xD;
"Mr. Chip comes here with an honest warning&#xD;
and proposes that we withdraw. The result&#xD;
is that we part considerably estranged. I ere's&#xD;
Paradise, who spoke truth when he said he&#xD;
had given me proper advice in his peculiar&#xD;
way, leaves me in a manner which may break&#xD;
an intimacy of twenty years. Fatman himself,&#xD;
I suppose, will no longer be on terms of cor-&#xD;
diality with me. God grant that I have not&#xD;
initiated my -uin i"&#xD;
His eyes, wandering in restless doubt and&#xD;
perplexity from one object to another, finally&#xD;
rested upon his cashier, now visible through&#xD;
the door which Mi-, Going had opened again&#xD;
when his visitors had departed.&#xD;
" Mr. Montant 1" called the old gentleman.&#xD;
The cashier approached with several envelopes&#xD;
&#xD;
in his hand. His principal motioned him to&#xD;
close the door and then said:-&#xD;
"Mr. Montant, you know every item of my&#xD;
business affairs, in the firm and out of it. I&#xD;
wish you now to read over this contract and&#xD;
agreement and give me your opinion of it."&#xD;
He took it and read the title indorsed on the&#xD;
last sheet:-&#xD;
"Contract between Going &amp;amp; Son and the&#xD;
Hobgoblin Mining and Manufacturing Com.&#xD;
pany."?&#xD;
Without any change of expression, he gave&#xD;
in return three large envelopes to Mr. Going.&#xD;
They were marked respectively-&#xD;
"Trial Balance," Schedule of Assets, Com-&#xD;
mercial and Personal," and "List of Personal&#xD;
and Commercial Liabilities."&#xD;
"I completed these this morning, sir," he&#xD;
said, calmly, "and I would beg of you to look&#xD;
over them and pardon the liberty I took in&#xD;
making them out. I had a reason for doing&#xD;
so."&#xD;
Mr. Goiig looked at him attentively for a&#xD;
moment.&#xD;
"Mr. Montant," he asked, almost in a whis.&#xD;
per, his voice trembling a little, "you have&#xD;
been my confidential clerk, and there need be&#xD;
no disguises between us. Tell me: after the&#xD;
great losses we have had, the heavy personal&#xD;
outlays I have made, and especially after the&#xD;
sums which the factory has absorbed, do these&#xD;
papers show that we are perfectly solvent ?'"&#xD;
" Mr. Going, unless secret liabilities have&#xD;
been incurred, of which I know nothing, you&#xD;
are solvent, without a doubt," said the cashier,&#xD;
d decisively. "I have estimated your personal&#xD;
property- very low, and, I am  certain, that&#xD;
should you wind up your affairs, you would&#xD;
come out worth, at least, fifty thousand dol-&#xD;
lars."&#xD;
"That is, if I sold my houses and my count.&#xD;
try place ?"&#xD;
"Yes, sir."&#xD;
"And without that?"&#xD;
The other said nothing. There was some.&#xD;
thing unspeakably sorrowful in the old gentle-&#xD;
man's voice as lie said:-&#xD;
"I need no answer. I knew it long ago&#xD;
And not a dollar settled upon .e-"&#xD;
He ceased abruptly. Our hero understood&#xD;
him. In the days of his great wealth he had&#xD;
not provided for his daughter.&#xD;
"Read that document, Mr. Montant,' he re-&#xD;
sumed, in a changed manner. "I only wish&#xD;
to know whether you find any trivial objec-&#xD;
tions in it."&#xD;
Later in the day Montant returned the con-&#xD;
tract with a bland face. Walter had come in,&#xD;
and, as it happened, all three were too busy to&#xD;
comment at length upon Hobgoblin ; but be-&#xD;
fore the principals left the office, our hero said&#xD;
to the old gentleman:-&#xD;
"Will you allow me to pay you a visit in&#xD;
Fifth Avenue, to-night? I would respectfully&#xD;
ask a private interview with you of some half&#xD;
an hour's duration."&#xD;
" Certainly," replied Mr. Going, in a tone as&#xD;
if he would prefer to say "certainly not."--&#xD;
"Only you know that we have just moved&#xD;
down from the Priory, and you will flnd the&#xD;
house in disorder. Will you dine with us ?"&#xD;
&#xD;
" You are very kind, sir, but I can not. If&#xD;
you will permit, I will be there at eight."&#xD;
CHAPTER VIII.&#xD;
THE LAST APPEAL.&#xD;
"Look, what I will not,&#xD;
That I can not do."&#xD;
MEASURE FOR MRAQuRL.&#xD;
THE energetic clock struck six before Ernest&#xD;
Montant laid down his pen and said to him-&#xD;
self,--" Through."&#xD;
Ile had finished many a trivial task, which,&#xD;
on other days, would not have required com-&#xD;
pletion. He had squared accounts and made&#xD;
memoranda ; in fact, put affairs im a condition&#xD;
to be continued by a successor. "Who knows&#xD;
but what this may be my last day in this of-&#xD;
flee ?" he said to himself before he left the&#xD;
desk, and he took an affectionate farewell of&#xD;
the little figure of Justice, still standing in&#xD;
front of his portfolio.&#xD;
The little bronze had seen many a face&#xD;
since it first looked upon Martin Bates, long&#xD;
years ago, but! upon none had its metal eyes&#xD;
beamed more kindly than upon the young cash-&#xD;
ier, for this man, at least, had done his duty&#xD;
to his employers and to himself. It was his&#xD;
duty to himself that led him to seek Mr. Going&#xD;
to-night, and little Justice knew it, and held&#xD;
out her little scales toward him affectionately,&#xD;
as if to encourage him. But lie felt as if it&#xD;
was bidding him farewell forever.&#xD;
Our hero took a plain, substantial dinner&#xD;
before he walked up town. A man bent upon&#xD;
important business must be particular as re-&#xD;
gards his feeding. le wants a beefsteak or a&#xD;
chop, and a mug of good ale, and perhaps a&#xD;
thimble-full of something stronger, that his&#xD;
flesh may not cloud or embarrass his spirit by&#xD;
becoming weak. So, at all events, our hero&#xD;
thought, and so lie acted. Starting, then, for&#xD;
his walk, lhe lighted a cigar, to aid digestion,&#xD;
and proceeded up Broadway.&#xD;
"I am not quite easy in my mind about&#xD;
this," he soliloquized. " It looks well,.don't it,&#xD;
for a mere boy-andh he a comparative stranger&#xD;
-to be showing an old New York merchant&#xD;
his duty and-his own interest. The result may&#xD;
bring me to grief in more ways than one. What&#xD;
if I should make an ass of myself. besides&#xD;
losing a good place, with first-rate prospects for&#xD;
the future."&#xD;
But no after scruples could change his firm-&#xD;
set purpose; nor could lie argue himself into&#xD;
the belief that he was not acting up to all his&#xD;
knowledgeof truth, right, and justice.&#xD;
As ho ascended the steps in front of Mr.&#xD;
Going's house, a strange desire came over him.&#xD;
A desire to take particular notice of all trifling&#xD;
objects; of the architectural points of the&#xD;
stoop, of the door, of the windows, as if lie&#xD;
should never again cross the threshold. -He&#xD;
rang the bell, noticing the shape of the knob,&#xD;
and when admitted by the man-servant, he&#xD;
said "Good evening, James," i a tone which&#xD;
would have suited "Good-bye, James," far&#xD;
better. The hat-stand in the hall, the ban -&#xD;
&#xD;
isters of the wide staircase, the few objects lie&#xD;
could see through the open door of the par-&#xD;
lors-each seemed worthy of his especial&#xD;
notice to-day, and when he was informed that&#xD;
Mr. Going awaited him in the library, down&#xD;
stairs, he counted the steps as he descended,&#xD;
and was surprised to see how high was the&#xD;
ceiling of the basement, and what an extraor-&#xD;
dinary fine basement it was, as if lie had not&#xD;
seen it before.&#xD;
He found his employer alone, reading the&#xD;
newspapers. As he entered the room he&#xD;
glanced around, and made a rough estimate of&#xD;
the number of books contained in the shelves&#xD;
that lined its walls, and the price they might&#xD;
bring at an auction. But Mr. Going's kind&#xD;
greeting, and invitation to an arm-chair, and a&#xD;
glass of sherry, brought him to his senses,&#xD;
nd he gathered his wits to say well and con-&#xD;
cisely what lie had come to say.&#xD;
" Mr. Going," he commenced, without hesi-&#xD;
tancy, "my object is so serious that I had&#xD;
better state it at once. I am compelled to re-&#xD;
sign my situation in your office."&#xD;
Mr. Going started ; but coniposing himself,&#xD;
remained silent.&#xD;
" I have left matters in such a condition,&#xD;
that my successor will find no difficulty in&#xD;
going right on. It was to accomplish this that&#xD;
I made out those statements I handed to you&#xD;
this afternoon. Walter knows that my ac-&#xD;
counts are correct, for he has not left me as&#xD;
much to myself as he did my unfortunate pre-&#xD;
decessor. I hope there can be no doubt of the&#xD;
purity of my motives, or of my most heartfelt&#xD;
regret at leaving you. I wish to express my&#xD;
Gratitude for all the kindness  you have&#xD;
showered upon me, and now I have only to&#xD;
receive your permission to leave, which 1 am&#xD;
sure you will not fail to grant me in a kindly&#xD;
spirit, though  my request is sudden and'&#xD;
anomalous."&#xD;
"Quite sudden and anomalous," repeated&#xD;
Mr. Going. with a hoarseness in his voice.&#xD;
" And yet it is necessity alone that prompts&#xD;
me," said our hero.&#xD;
" Mr. Montant," said the old gentleman,&#xD;
after a pause, and with that dignity of tone&#xD;
and manner which never forsook him, " we&#xD;
have known each other well enough, known&#xD;
each other as friends well enough, to permit an&#xD;
old man like me to ask your reasons. Of&#xD;
course I should be delighted to hear that you&#xD;
can better your condition; hut you are yet&#xD;
very young; and as you probably know no one&#xD;
in this city better able or more willing to ad-&#xD;
vise you, I would ask  you, for your own&#xD;
interest, to consult me upon so important a&#xD;
step. Still, I do not press this upon you;&#xD;
and if you think best to let the matter rest&#xD;
here, we have nothing to do but part without&#xD;
enmity."&#xD;
" Mr. Going," said our hero, slowly, "I dare&#xD;
not give you my reasons, unless you-first of&#xD;
all-assure me that you will not be offended.&#xD;
And you can not well promise that in advance."&#xD;
"I am quite certain that you will not say&#xD;
any thing to offend me."&#xD;
" Will you then promise me, in the event of&#xD;
my remarks meeting with your disapprobation,&#xD;
that you will try to forget this interview, and,&#xD;

GOING AND SON.&#xD;
&#xD;
if you think of me at all, remember only the&#xD;
past, striking from your memory the words&#xD;
which I indeed wish to say to-night ?"&#xD;
There was an anxious earnestness in his&#xD;
tone which, perhaps, warned Mr. Going what&#xD;
was coming; but seemingly determined to hear&#xD;
him out, the old gentleman only knit his&#xD;
brows a little, and answered gravely-&#xD;
"That I can and will promise ; I will only&#xD;
think of you as a faithful and most valued&#xD;
assistant in my office, and an esteemed guest at&#xD;
my house. What you have to say, say frankly,&#xD;
and exhaust the subject, that we may dismiss&#xD;
and erase it forever, if we see fit to do so."&#xD;
"Very well, sir, I will now speak my whole&#xD;
mind. I came here a poor, friendless boy.&#xD;
The world was all darkness to me, and I had&#xD;
nothing but a deep religious principle-to do&#xD;
right always-and a strong faith that God&#xD;
would help me. I was, and still am, deter-&#xD;
mined to act according to the teachings of my&#xD;
conscience, be the cost what it may.&#xD;
" Alone and inexperienced, without a bond&#xD;
of sympathy between me and another being on&#xD;
this side of the Atlantic, I came into your&#xD;
office, and from the first moment you showed&#xD;
yourself, what you ever since have been, the&#xD;
kindest, the most generous of men. You&#xD;
bound me to you for life. This debt I can&#xD;
never discharge; but if ever the time shall&#xD;
come when I can serve you, you shall find me&#xD;
ready and glad of the opportunity."&#xD;
The evident reality of the young man's senti-&#xD;
ments did not fall unheeded upon Mr. Going's&#xD;
ears. Unable to repress his feelings, lie said,&#xD;
sadly:-&#xD;
" And you prove this by leaving me at a&#xD;
time when you know well that I urn in need&#xD;
of your help ?"&#xD;
"That help, sir, should be yours were I&#xD;
never to receive a dollar of remuneration ; but&#xD;
well and faithfully as I would serve you, I&#xD;
can not serve under the llohgoblin Company I"&#xD;
" And may I ask, why not, sir ?" inquired&#xD;
Mr. Going, coldly.&#xD;
"I think, sir," answered our hero, after&#xD;
a moment's reflection, "that since we have&#xD;
entered upon this discussion, I had better un-&#xD;
burden myself completely, at once and forever,&#xD;
of all that clouds my affection for you.&#xD;
" You propose to sell to the Hohgoblin&#xD;
Mining and Manufacturing Company your farm,&#xD;
factory, and patents, for which they will give&#xD;
you only fifty thousand dollars, in cash. You&#xD;
have already expended several times that&#xD;
amount upon the enterprise, so that this fifty&#xD;
thousand dollars does not make your losses&#xD;
good to any material extent. Besides, you&#xD;
hold the company's notes for one hundred&#xD;
thousand dollars. These notes, however, you&#xD;
will soon see, are perfectly worthless. You&#xD;
dare not sue the company for the value of&#xD;
them, should they never be paid, for a lawsuit&#xD;
would be noised abroad, and stop all sales of&#xD;
shares. None of the trustees have indorsed&#xD;
them, and you can only look.for their payment&#xD;
to that misty creature-the company. Finally,&#xD;
you pledge all your shares to Mr. Chip for the&#xD;
payment of his loan of two hundred thousand&#xD;
dollars. This money is not loaned to you, and&#xD;
yet you have to give security for its repay-.&#xD;
&#xD;
meant. On the other hand, you make over to&#xD;
the company a large amount of merchantable&#xD;
property-buildings, and real estate, and ma.&#xD;
chinery-all of which has a fixed value. You&#xD;
receive therefor, what?   Not even these&#xD;
doubtful shares, for they are in Mr. Chip's&#xD;
hands, and if the trustees choose to treat you&#xD;
wrongfully, it is in their power to keep from&#xD;
paying him his money for years, thus depriv-&#xD;
ing you of your stock, while they can sell off&#xD;
their own stock at their pleasure. You may say&#xD;
that they have agreed to hold their stock till&#xD;
you and Mr. Chip are paid every dollar ; but,&#xD;
sir, you must know better than that; many&#xD;
pleasant little secret arrangements can be&#xD;
made, which will never reach your ears, by&#xD;
virtue of which they can really sell their stock,&#xD;
and yet prove in a court of law that no acteual&#xD;
bonafide sale ever took place. I have read the&#xD;
contract carefully, and I say that it is a&#xD;
villainous attempt to place you entirely at their&#xD;
tender mercies. But this is not all."&#xD;
So far he had spoken in a quiet, dispas-&#xD;
sionate, but most decided manner. In the quiet.&#xD;
ness of the room every word fell with telling&#xD;
effect upon Mr. Going's car,- and impressed&#xD;
itself upon his mind with the irresistible force&#xD;
of sober truth. He felt uneasy and distressed,&#xD;
and at the last sentence looked quickly at&#xD;
Montant, as if to say, "Is it not enough ?"&#xD;
" This is not all," continued the latter,&#xD;
quickly, though without raising his voice.&#xD;
" There is also a moral reason why I can not be&#xD;
the servant of the house which allows itself to&#xD;
be inveigled into a complication of such a&#xD;
nature. The public, Mr. Going, will think&#xD;
that the company pays you two millions of dol-&#xD;
lars for a property which in reality has cost&#xD;
at the most only three hundred and fifty thou-&#xD;
sand dollars-first cost, improvements, and all.&#xD;
The trustees give you very little cash, and only&#xD;
one million in stock, and the other one million&#xD;
these trustees put in their pockets ! Now, sir,&#xD;
if a poor tailor or shoemaker invests his hard-&#xD;
earned savings in Iobgoblin, he buys an in-&#xD;
terest in what has only cost half what he is&#xD;
told it cost. This I boldly brand as obtaining&#xD;
money fraudulently, and I am sure if these&#xD;
trustees were hauled up before a jury, their&#xD;
action would be called robbery. Of course I&#xD;
know that these things are done every day,&#xD;
and by men of the highest standing in society;&#xD;
but, poor and friendless as I am, I decline to'be&#xD;
connected with any such operations. If I re-&#xD;
mained in your service I should only be a hin-&#xD;
derance to you, for if any one asked me about&#xD;
this Hobgoblin Company, I should feel it my&#xD;
duty to tell the truth about it, so I should do&#xD;
better to go away."&#xD;
" At your age, Mr. Montant," said the old&#xD;
gentleman, still kindly, one is apt to speak cick&#xD;
words hastily. I do not feel offended by your&#xD;
freedom, but I deem it useless to argue the&#xD;
point, for your resolution is evidently taken.&#xD;
And now that we have done with that subject,&#xD;
will you tell me what your plans are for the&#xD;
future ?"&#xD;
" I don't know, sir," answered our hero,&#xD;
sadly, " I had almost hoped--"&#xD;
" To shake me in my determination to ful-&#xD;
fill an agreement into which I entered, ver.-&#xD;
&#xD;
bally long ago, by telling me that my oldest&#xD;
and best friends in business-"&#xD;
"Oh, Mr. Going!" cried the other, " they 1&#xD;
will not be friends any longer. From  the&#xD;
moment that contract is signed, you will see aI&#xD;
change in them allI"e&#xD;
The old gentleman bit his lips. Here his&#xD;
young clerk was certainly right. Had he notr&#xD;
already noticed this change in Fatman, Chip,f&#xD;
and Paradise?&#xD;
" I wish," continued Ernest Montant, now&#xD;
pleading his cause with all the fervid energy&#xD;
he could command, " I wish my hair were grayE&#xD;
and my head bowed down by the experienceI&#xD;
of old age, that you might heed my voice! If&#xD;
you draw a line through that hideous page in&#xD;
your ledger, headed Hlobgoblin-if you decide&#xD;
to lose every cent it has cost you, you are still&#xD;
solvent, still well off. Thea, sir, give Walter&#xD;
-and, let me say it-give me a chance to]&#xD;
work for you. With the glorious old name of&#xD;
your house, sir, we can do any thing! I will&#xD;
work as a broker, as a clerk, in any honorable&#xD;
capacity, and I will not ask you for a dollar&#xD;
but what is absolutely necessary for my liveli-&#xD;
hood!"&#xD;
The old gentleman was not unmoved by this&#xD;
speech. Its wisdom was not lost upon him,&#xD;
nor did the glowing enthusiasm of the speaker&#xD;
fail to impress him.&#xD;
"You seem very warmly attached to this&#xD;
house, Mr. Montant," he said, looking him full&#xD;
in the face.&#xD;
Our hero colored violently. Perhaps he&#xD;
had misunderstood hin, perhaps not, but he&#xD;
answered very promptly,-&#xD;
"I do not quite comprehend your meaning,&#xD;
sir, but I will anticipate any equivocation by&#xD;
assuring you that my motives are in no respect&#xD;
selfish. Even had I ever presumed to aspire&#xD;
to a closer connection with you; even had I&#xD;
been fool enough to hope for a social distinc-&#xD;
tion entirely above my own condition, all auch&#xD;
dreams would long since have ceased, for I am&#xD;
at present engaged to be married."&#xD;
Mr. Going received this communication,&#xD;
made in self defense, with genuine astonish-&#xD;
ment, but like the delicately refined gentleman&#xD;
that he was, he made a slight bow in acknowl-&#xD;
edgment of the information, and said nothing.&#xD;
"At the same time," continued our: hero, I&#xD;
would not allow this or any other tie to keep&#xD;
me from serving you, if I could but be allowed&#xD;
to work in the way my inmost - soul has&#xD;
prompted me to point out to you. If I leave&#xD;
this house to-night, without gaining my object,&#xD;
I leave it a poor and lonely wanderer, without&#xD;
a friend in the world but a woman as poor&#xD;
and lonely as I am.  If I go it is not sel-&#xD;
fishness, surely which sends me from you-"&#xD;
" What is it, then, Mr. Montant ?" interupted&#xD;
the old gentleman. " It is stubbornness. Nay,&#xD;
do not interrupt me, for as you have spoken&#xD;
plainly to me, I should think I might express&#xD;
my opinions too. You have scarce attained the&#xD;
age of manhood, sir, and you tell me that what&#xD;
I can sanction, what my good name can agree&#xD;
to is not worthy of your simple co-operation!&#xD;
I can not argue such a point with you. I can&#xD;
only say that such is not my view of the case,&#xD;
and I appeal to the commercial world of this&#xD;
&#xD;
city, whether a young man like you may or&#xD;
may not allow himself to follow where I&#xD;
ead!"&#xD;
He paused a moment. Montant felt what&#xD;
would be the unanimous reply of the thou-&#xD;
sands down town who look up to this man&#xD;
with envy, admiration, timidity, or simple&#xD;
respect, and that in their view, he was now&#xD;
acting a very strange part in refusing to be&#xD;
convinced by Mr. Going's kindness and con-&#xD;
descension, for it was nothing less for him to&#xD;
listen to such a conversation. But call it&#xD;
eccentric, call it boyish, call it what you pleasd,&#xD;
he stuck to his point, keeping a stern silence&#xD;
after Mr. Going's last words.&#xD;
" Ernest," continued Mr. Going, in a changed&#xD;
tone and manner, " stay with me! Do not&#xD;
leave me, for if you do, we shall both regret&#xD;
it! I have opened to you my heart and my&#xD;
house ; I have treated you as a friend, almost&#xD;
as a son! And now, when I want help, you&#xD;
desert me, and spoil your own career. You&#xD;
are throwing away your best opportunities,&#xD;
and alienating those who should have become&#xD;
dear to you."&#xD;
Never before had he called our hero by&#xD;
his first name, and there was a something in&#xD;
his voice, that showed that.he was growing&#xD;
weak, that he wanted help; that he had leaned&#xD;
upon and cherished this boy, and the loss of&#xD;
him was a pang which he had no longer the&#xD;
power to hide beneath his grand dignity.&#xD;
Ernest Montant's eyes tilled with tears. Ho&#xD;
knew that argument had lost its power; that&#xD;
by no human means could he prevail upon his&#xD;
venerated friend to give up. this accursed&#xD;
scheme, which alone kept them asunder, and&#xD;
lie was much moved by this appeal made to&#xD;
his heart. He arose quickly, agitated beyond&#xD;
mere conventionality, seized Mr. Going's hand,&#xD;
and with a faltering voice, said:-&#xD;
"The time will come when I can prove to&#xD;
you that those last words of yours conic home&#xD;
to my heart, and then will I serve you faith-&#xD;
fully. But stay with you in this damnable&#xD;
enterprise, I can not. I have seen my father&#xD;
ruined, worse than ruined, and I have sworn to&#xD;
choose a different path in life from that which&#xD;
led him to misery, as little deserved, as you in&#xD;
your kindliness and generosity, deserve the&#xD;
fate which I see gathering like a black cloud&#xD;
over your future. Since we cannot agree, let me&#xD;
say farewell, and believe me when I say, that,&#xD;
next my own father, I love and honor you."&#xD;
He turned to the door. Mr. Going's face&#xD;
had resumed its expression of calm, self-reli-&#xD;
ance. le arose stiffly from his chair.&#xD;
"Since it must be, farewell. Shall we see you&#xD;
to-morrow ?"&#xD;
"I think not, sir. I shall stay in New York&#xD;
a few days, and will be on hand should my&#xD;
successor require help or explanation, which,&#xD;
however, I can not imagine he will."-&#xD;
" And about your salary?     Have you&#xD;
drawn it?" asked Mr. Going, in his business&#xD;
tone.&#xD;
' I have addressed a few lines to Walter,&#xD;
asking him to send the amount due me, as soon&#xD;
as he has examined my accounts. Good night,&#xD;
sir !"&#xD;
"Good night, Mr. Montant I"&#xD;

&#xD;
FACT.                            71&#xD;
&#xD;
Our hero was gone. Mr. Going listened&#xD;
to his quick steps up-stairs, and sank back ex-&#xD;
hausted into his chair.&#xD;
" They all leave me," he muttered. "Old&#xD;
Chip, then Paradise, followed by Fatman, and&#xD;
finally, this strange boy !  I don't know&#xD;
why, but this last loss seems the heaviest I"&#xD;
Thoughts fly quickly while the mind is on&#xD;
the wing, and as Ernest Montant strode to-&#xD;
ward the door which was to close on him for-&#xD;
ever, he thought bitterly:-&#xD;
"Accursed be this craving for riches, which&#xD;
distorts honor and integrity. Twice accursed&#xD;
be the evil genius of this age, which leads men&#xD;
to strive for a fortune in a day, or to retrieve&#xD;
lost wealth by luck instead of work!/ Thrice&#xD;
accursed be the spirits of wanton speculation,&#xD;
luxury, and recklessness, which are undermin-&#xD;
ing all respectability and clearing the way for&#xD;
King Hazard to hold high rule I"&#xD;
He reached the parlor door, which stood&#xD;
wide open. He looked in, and there she sat,&#xD;
waiting for him perhaps all this time. There&#xD;
she was, in the beauty of her youth, with her&#xD;
black hair surrounding her marvelously lovely&#xD;
face, with a light in her eyes as she advanced&#xD;
toward him.&#xD;
"Miss Jessie," he said, hurriedly, "I really&#xD;
did not expect to meet you here."&#xD;
She was trembling violently ; her look, her&#xD;
voice, her gestures betrayed her emotion.&#xD;
" You have been talking with papa," she&#xD;
said. "I heard the voices. You have had a&#xD;
quarrel. You are going to leave us. I know&#xD;
it all."&#xD;
"You are right, Miss Jessie," he answered,&#xD;
sadly. "I must say, good-bye !"&#xD;
"And all about llobgobhin, is it not?" she&#xD;
asked, despondingly.&#xD;
"All about hobgoblin,"   he  answered,&#xD;
fiercely.&#xD;
"Can it not be mended ?" she cried, impa-&#xD;
tiently. "Remember your promise to me ! I&#xD;
feel im my heart that all is going on wrong,---&#xD;
all is black, black as night ! Remember your&#xD;
promise to stay by papa in the hour of need."&#xD;
"I keep human promises, humanly," he an-&#xD;
swered, bitterly. "I have gone the length of&#xD;
my rope. I can do no more."&#xD;
For an instant, one only, she looked him full&#xD;
in the face with her large black eyes, her&#xD;
color all gone from her, and then she turned&#xD;
away.&#xD;
"Can you forgive me ?" he cried, no longer&#xD;
master of himself.&#xD;
"(Go," she muttered, her face still averted.&#xD;
" Can you send me thus from you," he asked,&#xD;
in despair, " without a word of kindness, or of&#xD;
comfort, when, God knows, I need it."&#xD;
No human eye saw her face, as she ex-&#xD;
tended her hand to him    without turning&#xD;
around.&#xD;
"If you mean what you say, stay.     I&#xD;
know papa has not been unkind to you."&#xD;
"Indeed, indeed, no!" he cried, "but yet&#xD;
there are differences-"&#xD;
"Go, then,". she repeated, bitterly, at the&#xD;
same time withdrawing her hand.&#xD;
He stood a moment, concentrated all his&#xD;
will-power in one grand effort to for-ce her to&#xD;
turn her face to him; hesitated, wavered, and&#xD;
&#xD;
then seized his hat, and was gone in an in.&#xD;
stant.&#xD;
The sound of the closing front door seemed&#xD;
to rouse her from her attitude of repression.&#xD;
She stood a moment unmoved, then rushed&#xD;
toward the door, and with a love that knew no&#xD;
more control, cried,--&#xD;
"No! no! no!"&#xD;
She.checked herself. Her own violence had&#xD;
brought her to her senses. She turned round&#xD;
with alarm and dread, and there-there, not&#xD;
five feet from her, stood her father, with his&#xD;
face as pale as death.&#xD;
With a loud sob she threw herself into her&#xD;
father's arms, and they held each other in such&#xD;
an embrace as would have moved even Ernest&#xD;
Montant, could he have seen it.&#xD;
The skies were draped in the black gar-&#xD;
ments of the first wintry storm. The streets&#xD;
were cheerless and deserted, while the cold&#xD;
blast and icy-penetrating drizzle suited well&#xD;
the emotions which agitated our hero's breast&#xD;
as he left that house. In one short hour he&#xD;
had again become a wanderer, an outcast from&#xD;
what had been a bright and cherished home&#xD;
to him, just as he had once, left the house of&#xD;
his father and mother.&#xD;
He felt miserable and dejected, absolutely&#xD;
friendless and homeless as the veriest vagrant,&#xD;
and yet he should not have felt so. As lie be-&#xD;
came calmer, there came to him the thought&#xD;
of Josephine. Had he not an asylum then?&#xD;
Ue who called himself homeless-he who&#xD;
called himself friendless-did lie not possess a&#xD;
woman's heart, and possess it entirely ? Was&#xD;
there not one breast which beat for him and&#xD;
him alone who thought himnselfforsaken. And&#xD;
the more lie thought of Josephine Van Strom,&#xD;
the more settled became his purpose to seek&#xD;
her in his misery, and never to part from her&#xD;
again.&#xD;
CHAPTER IX.&#xD;
REUNION.&#xD;
My life upon her faith."&#xD;
OTELLO.&#xD;
READER, have you been in the State of Mas-&#xD;
sachusetts, and are the charms of her scenery&#xD;
familiar to you?  Have you roamed through&#xD;
the woods and over the hills, along the streams&#xD;
and through the fields, fascinated by those&#xD;
charms of nature that do not aspire to the&#xD;
awful, but content themselves with enchanting&#xD;
one by their soft and smiling loveliness ?&#xD;
On a high bluff which broke the onward&#xD;
course of one of those rivers and turned it&#xD;
aside by a sharp curve, so that the view on&#xD;
all sides was varied and picturesque, there&#xD;
stood a large wooden house, somewhat preten-&#xD;
tious in its architecture, and well suited to the&#xD;
grotesque beauty of the spot. This was the&#xD;
home of John Jacob Van Strom, Junior, and&#xD;
had been purchased by him as a retreat where&#xD;
he could live very quietly amid modestly with&#xD;
his faithful wife, our old friend Della, and his&#xD;
sister-in-law the handsome widow.&#xD;
&#xD;
On an afternoon, late in the fall, an after-&#xD;
noon glowing in the last effort of nature to&#xD;
make the earth beautiful once more before&#xD;
resigning it to the cold embrace of winter, we&#xD;
find the two sisters-for sisters they were-in&#xD;
law, in sympathy, in confidence, and in love,&#xD;
sitting upon the veranda and enjoying the&#xD;
view.&#xD;
"The village looks charming from here,"&#xD;
said Josephine. "The little white houses&#xD;
peeping out between the trees or standing in&#xD;
clusters, scattered over the landscape like in-&#xD;
nocent sheep in a green meadow, and the&#xD;
church with its belfry and little gothic windows&#xD;
shining in the sunlight, an emblem of sweet&#xD;
simplicity."&#xD;
suAre you happy here, Josephine ?" asked&#xD;
Bella, looking wistfully at her sister. The&#xD;
widow had not changed, only the old expres-&#xD;
sion of Raphael's Madonna came over her no-&#xD;
ble face oftener than before. And now, as she&#xD;
gazed upon the village, and out into the blue&#xD;
hazy distance beyond, and watched the current&#xD;
of the river as it flowed away from her, this&#xD;
peculiar resemblance to the Madonna was very&#xD;
noticeable. " That river flows to the sea," she&#xD;
thought, 4 and on that sea there is a certain&#xD;
port, a city of a million or more inhabitants,&#xD;
and of that million I know  one," and the&#xD;
thought gave her life, hope, happiness.&#xD;
"Shall I guess what you are thinking of?"&#xD;
asked Bella, gently, stealing Josephine's warm&#xD;
hand avay from her lap and holding it in her&#xD;
own.&#xD;
The handsome widow smiled and colored,&#xD;
but answered in the deep metallic-voice we&#xD;
have heard before,-&#xD;
"I don't deny it, dear; I am thinking of&#xD;
him, but not now, only, always! So you see&#xD;
there is nothing so wonderful in my present&#xD;
dreaming."&#xD;
" Josie," said Bella, softly, " do you think he&#xD;
will come to you soon?"&#xD;
"1I don't know, dear. I am anxious, worried&#xD;
beyond description. He has not written to&#xD;
me in some time, and there was more of busi-&#xD;
ness than of love in his last letter. Bella, I&#xD;
think it looks dubious when our lovers write&#xD;
to us that business is so absorbing. It may be&#xD;
that business does increase to monstrous pro-&#xD;
portions; but it looks as though love had dwin-&#xD;
dled correspondingly, till it has become a more&#xD;
secondary consideration."&#xD;
"Very true," said Bella, with a strange&#xD;
smile.&#xD;
" And I can't feel as confident of his love,&#xD;
as-reliant as-I would like, somehow," said&#xD;
Josephine, with a sigh.&#xD;
" And so you don't think he will come," said&#xD;
Bella, mischievously.&#xD;
" What should make him come ?" asked Jo-&#xD;
sephine sadly, " He is a beggar and I-"&#xD;
"And you are the sister of an immensely&#xD;
rich woman," said Bella, in the best of good&#xD;
humors.&#xD;
" What do you mean me to understand by&#xD;
such a change in the tone of your remarks ?"&#xD;
said Josephine, turning her eyes full upon her&#xD;
sister-in-law. "This is the first time that you&#xD;
have ever favored this love affair of mine with&#xD;
encouraging remarks. You used to scold me,&#xD;
&#xD;
call me a rash, impetuous creature, and tell ie&#xD;
that I ought to be ashamed to bestow my love&#xD;
so soon, and prate away about my attractions&#xD;
and fascinations, which, practically, do not lay&#xD;
the world at my feet or even the smallest&#xD;
part of it I"&#xD;
"Is he not even a small part of the world ?"&#xD;
asked Bella, merrily. -' You strange woman !&#xD;
To love a man who is nobody. lie is not a&#xD;
part of the world?   Oh! Josie, is he an&#xD;
angel?"&#xD;
Josephine leaned over to her and gave her&#xD;
a warm kiss.&#xD;
" Now just hear this," continued Bella, in&#xD;
the same tone. " This woman is trying to&#xD;
make me believe that she does not know how&#xD;
beautiful and bewitching she is."&#xD;
"Scoff away," said Josephine, laughingly.&#xD;
" I am going to speak seriously now," rejoin-&#xD;
ed the tailor's daughter with a sedate face. " I&#xD;
have come to the conclusion that you two love&#xD;
each other sincerely and truly, and my&#xD;
majesty is graciously inclined to favor the&#xD;
match."&#xD;
"Have you news from him ?" asked Joseph-&#xD;
ine, quickly. Her face colored crimson in an&#xD;
instant.  She aproached Bella, put her arms&#xD;
around her, kissed he, and with tears already&#xD;
starting to her eyes, repeated in passionate&#xD;
entreaty,-&#xD;
" Have you news from him? Tell me; oh,&#xD;
tell me. Do not keep mae in this suspense.&#xD;
Something tells nie you have !"&#xD;
" I have," answered Bella, calmly.&#xD;
"Then tell me - oh, how can you be so&#xD;
cruel!"&#xD;
" Do you think he will come to you soon ?"&#xD;
asked Bella, looking slyly aside from where&#xD;
they were sitting.&#xD;
Josephine, whose intuition told her instantly&#xD;
that something was coming, became suddenly&#xD;
pale, a vague fear possessed her heart, and al-&#xD;
most stifled her voice as she gasped,-&#xD;
"Is the news bad. Tell me, for heaven's&#xD;
sake. I can bear it. Is lie-"&#xD;
"Sit down, you little goosy, and compose&#xD;
yourself," answered Bella, smiling, " for you&#xD;
may as well. Ile wrote me that lie was com-&#xD;
ing on here."&#xD;
" Thank God, cried Josephine, tears of joy&#xD;
and gratitude streaming down her cheeks.&#xD;
"But why didn't he write to me ?"&#xD;
" Because lie had a vague idea that I was a&#xD;
sensible, honest woman, and he first wished to&#xD;
be informed whether he had any rivals to fear,&#xD;
or whether your heart was still all his own, so&#xD;
that he might receive it at your hands with-&#xD;
out a hinderance."&#xD;
" le, rivals " cried Josephine, clasping her&#xD;
hands, over her face, " a hinderance, between&#xD;
him and my heart I"&#xD;
- Touched by the earnestness of her excla-&#xD;
mations, Bella now approached, and kissed her&#xD;
warmly.&#xD;
" Tut, tut," she said, "I understand you now&#xD;
and I am satisfied. Compose yourself, for lie&#xD;
may be coming soon."&#xD;
"Soon?".cried Josephine, radiant with joy,&#xD;
" Tell me, tell me quickly, darling, when is he&#xD;
coming?"&#xD;
" You must not speak so loud, Josie," an-&#xD;

swered Bella, with a bright and happy face&#xD;
"for some one may be listening," and again&#xD;
she cast a sly glance behind her.&#xD;
Josephine followed the look. The form of&#xD;
a man had emerged from the house, and now&#xD;
stood a few feet from them. She started to her&#xD;
feet, looked at him for a moment, and with a&#xD;
cry of ecstasy. rushed into his arms.&#xD;
"My darling, my own lover !" was all she&#xD;
could mutter, as she nestled her head upon his&#xD;
breast and wound her arms around him, hold-&#xD;
ing him in a passionate embrace, as if never&#xD;
again to release him.&#xD;
He could not say a word. He had heard&#xD;
the latter part of their conversation, and all&#xD;
his sorrows, doubts, and fears vanished in the&#xD;
presence of such love as this woman had con-&#xD;
fessed for him. The gallant tailor's daughter,&#xD;
she of low degree, but high and noble mind,&#xD;
stood by with moistened eyes and a smile so&#xD;
bright and happy, that it lent radiance and&#xD;
even beauty to her plain face.&#xD;

Bella Van Strom loved her husband, not po-&#xD;
etically, not romantically, but with the whole&#xD;
integrity of her honest soul. Her great trials&#xD;
had wrought a great change in her character,&#xD;
She had been a wild, ambitious, venturesome&#xD;

freak, her marriage, as recorded in the early&#xD;
part of this book, had forced her to face such&#xD;
consequences as the fatal masquerade at the&#xD;
Priory, her gratitude to him who had made&#xD;
her life more than she had ever expected it&#xD;
could be, and her sense of duty developed&#xD;
traits of character heretofore unknown, and,&#xD;
as we have seen, she bravely, did what she&#xD;
could, becoming the most devoted of wives,&#xD;
the most careful of nurses, the most faithful&#xD;
of friends, and the most conscientious manager&#xD;
of her husband's affairs.&#xD;
As she had risen, so her unfortunate hus-&#xD;
band, John Van Strom, declined, sunk into&#xD;
&#xD;
and half delirious with joy. "Will you, can&#xD;
you again leave me, darling ?"&#xD;
"No," said Ernest Montant, kissing her up.&#xD;
turned lips and drinking in the luxury of love in&#xD;
the looks they exchanged. "You may take me&#xD;
as I am, cast away by the world; forsaken and&#xD;
alone, a wanderer and a stranger to all but you."&#xD;
"And me," said the tailor's daughter, softly.&#xD;
"Bella," cried Josephine, in the fullness of&#xD;
her heart, extending one hand to her, while,&#xD;
with the other, she still clung to him, " as I&#xD;
pray for all that I need and receive, so shall I&#xD;
pray to God, all the rest of my life, that he&#xD;
may bless you forever I" '&#xD;
" Amen," said our hero, solemnly, and&#xD;
the three sat down together and watched the&#xD;
sun sinking in the west, and the moon rise&#xD;
softly over the hills. They talked of all that&#xD;
friendship and hearty good-will gave them in&#xD;
common, until Bella said that she had to go in&#xD;
and see her husband. So at last the lovers&#xD;
were left alone to enjoy the beauty of the&#xD;
earth, this glorious night, and the bliss of the&#xD;
heaven which was in their hearts.&#xD;
&#xD;
perfect subserviency to her stronger organiza-&#xD;
tion, became like a doll, seemed to have no in-&#xD;
tellect of his own where mind should compete&#xD;
for the mastery. Yet John had not lost his&#xD;
mind, but, by the time we again meet them,&#xD;
Bella had succeeded in gaining complete con-&#xD;
trol over it, repressing its mischievous out.&#xD;
bursts, while encouraging all that was left him&#xD;
of reason and sentiment. Nor was she afraid&#xD;
of a return of the frenzy of intoxication to&#xD;
which we have seen him subject, for she had&#xD;
invented a harmless but effectual remedy, in.&#xD;
case entreaty was too weak or circumstances&#xD;
too unfortunate, to prevent his inebriation. She&#xD;
provided herself with a harmless narcotic which&#xD;
she mixed in a glass of wine when lie insisted&#xD;
on taking too much, and so stole away' his&#xD;
senses while she watched by his side until he&#xD;
awoke, a weaker and a wiser man. But these&#xD;
occasions grew more and more unfrequent, and&#xD;
we find them a most peaceable and well-be-&#xD;
haved couple, "the gray mare proving the&#xD;
better horse," as John, in his more lucid mo-&#xD;
ments, knew perfectly well, and admitted with&#xD;
a contented laugh, for lie loved his wife, and,&#xD;
unlike many people of more wits, was not&#xD;
ashamed to acknowledge her superiority.&#xD;
The day after the arrival of Ernest Montant&#xD;
at Van Strom's, they were a merry party at the&#xD;
breakfast table. John, presiding as host, pre-&#xD;
sented no very imposing or dignified appearance,&#xD;
but he was cheerful and comparatively bright in&#xD;
&#xD;
his mind. Our hero noticed that he had grown&#xD;
much older in his face since his father's death,&#xD;
and really, to judge by his scant and fast-&#xD;
blanching hair, his sunken cheeks, his sallow&#xD;
complexion, the wrinkles that seamed his face&#xD;
and surrounded his shapeless mouth, he might&#xD;
have been considered an old man. Though&#xD;
much thinner in flesh than ever before, and&#xD;
though he stooped very much, he rarely com-&#xD;
plained of bad health; while Bella was too&#xD;
much occupied in watching his mental im.&#xD;
provement to see that, judging from externals,&#xD;
she might expect to be a widow before many&#xD;
years had elapsed. John had no idea of the&#xD;
true state of affairs between Josephine and his&#xD;
new guest, but, as he really liked them both,&#xD;
it seemed the proper thing to chaff them all&#xD;
through breakfast; which the handsome wid-&#xD;
ow, radiant with beauty and sparkling with&#xD;
joy, accepted very graciously, to the evident&#xD;
enjoyment of Bella and our hero, so that John,&#xD;
delighted at his success, felt highly pleased&#xD;
with every one else, Ile called Josephine&#xD;
"my dear sister," and our hero "my esteemed&#xD;
fridd," and his wife " my darling girl," and was&#xD;
so lively and amiable that, before breakfast&#xD;
was over, Bella had tears of joy and gratitude&#xD;
in her eyes.&#xD;
After the meal was concluded, Josephine&#xD;
and her lover decided to take a walk, leaving&#xD;
the master of the house alone with his wife,&#xD;
thus giving Bella an opportunity which she&#xD;
had eagerly watched for-a chance to talk&#xD;
half an hour with him; while he was in the&#xD;
best possible humor, on a subject of great im-&#xD;
portance.&#xD;
They were sitting by the window. She was&#xD;
leaning her head on his shoulder and had tak-&#xD;
en his hand, while an expression of cheerful&#xD;
contentedness softened his worn features.&#xD;
"John," she said, after thinking in silence a&#xD;
few moments how best to approach the sub-&#xD;
ject, "John, I want to talk business."&#xD;
" Talk any thing you like, Bella," he replied,&#xD;
kindly. ",Upon business, any how, I can an-&#xD;
swer you in a manner worthy of your great&#xD;
talents and intelligence, for I know something&#xD;
about business,"&#xD;
Now, although he said this with a childish&#xD;
pride, it was not untrue. Notwithstanding&#xD;
his shortcomings on other points, John was&#xD;
what might be called a naturally shrewd busi-&#xD;
ness man, and in matters where dollars and&#xD;
cents alone were concerned, he rarely went&#xD;
wrong or was deceived.&#xD;
"Well, then, John, you know that you are&#xD;
very richI" said Bella, without changing her&#xD;
position, and speaking in a certain affectionate&#xD;
and soothing tone to which he could listen for&#xD;
hours without becoming wearied.&#xD;
"Yes," said he, "I would not be surprised&#xD;
if I could sell my property, real and personal,&#xD;
for something over two millions of dollars.&#xD;
That is, my mortgages, my railroad bonds, my&#xD;
houses in town and my place here, besides my&#xD;
silver and your diamonds."&#xD;
"Which I never wesr," said Bella, laugh-&#xD;
ing. " But never mind that, I appreciate your&#xD;
kindness just as much. Well, now, John, I&#xD;
wish you would make a will."&#xD;
" What for, Bella ? We have no children ;&#xD;
&#xD;
Oh, if you could only have a boy to inherit&#xD;
the old name and all this money I"&#xD;
" You know that is impossible, John," re-&#xD;
plied Bella, gently, " so let us be thankful for&#xD;
such happiness as God has given us, without&#xD;
hankering after the impossible."&#xD;
He said nothing.&#xD;
S" Will you make your will, John ?" she&#xD;
asked, after a pause.&#xD;
" I don't see what you want with a will, I&#xD;
don't mean to die, and the property will all go&#xD;
to you anyway. Do you want me to die right&#xD;
away, and do you want to be sure of the-?"&#xD;
" John," she interrupted, seeing that he was&#xD;
growing ill-tempered, rapidly, " John," taking&#xD;
both his hands and catching his eye, in an im-&#xD;
ploring, kind but steady glance, "you don't&#xD;
mean what you say!"&#xD;
He looked at her a moment. Even to him,&#xD;
those eyes full of tenderness, spoke convinc-&#xD;
ingly, and his rising choler was exorcised.&#xD;
He took her to his heart and held her there in&#xD;
a long embrace which reassured her.&#xD;
" I want you, John, to leave half of all your&#xD;
property to Josephine I"&#xD;
He stared at her in utter bewilderment,&#xD;
but she continued, quietly,-&#xD;
" You know how your father treated her all&#xD;
his life, and finally left her penniless, although&#xD;
the widow of his first-born. Will you make&#xD;
up for the error of your father?  This is&#xD;
the, reason why I want you to make a will.&#xD;
You have made her a small allowance now,&#xD;
and I can not for the life of me see why she is&#xD;
not entitled to half your father's estate. Mind&#xD;
I don't ask you to give her any thing now,&#xD;
unless-"&#xD;
"Unless what?" said John, slightly be-&#xD;
wildered.&#xD;
"Unless she should marry I" said Bella,&#xD;
slyly.&#xD;
"'Well, when she gets married, we'll talk&#xD;
about it," said John, assuming a business tone,&#xD;
" and I can not see why I should leave her&#xD;
any property in my will, because if I die-nay,&#xD;
don't be distressed, I am talking business now&#xD;
-if I should die, then you can give her what&#xD;
you choose, you know."&#xD;
" But I would rather have it the other way,"&#xD;
said Bella, " because she is entitled to her por-&#xD;
tion, and I would much rather she should re-&#xD;
ceive it at your hands than from my charity.&#xD;
I would give it to her any way."       -&#xD;
" Well, it is all the same, one way or the&#xD;
other" rejoined John, slightly impatient.&#xD;
" Yes, dear, but is it not right for you to do as&#xD;
I say? John, remember that we must all die,&#xD;
and do not leave an act of justice undone when&#xD;
opportunity offers you the chance to do it."&#xD;
" And do you think, Bella," asked John,&#xD;
simply, "that we can die the more easily for&#xD;
doing what is right ?"&#xD;
"Indeed I know    it I" she replied, fer-&#xD;
vently.&#xD;
" And have I always tried to do right by&#xD;
you, Bella ?" he asked with a trembling voice&#xD;
and quivering lip. " You know that I love&#xD;
you dearly, but have I always tried to do right&#xD;
by you ?"&#xD;
" You have been nothing but kind, and gen-&#xD;
erous and noble-hearted to me," she answered,&#xD;

GOING AND SON.&#xD;
&#xD;
weeping, "and I shall pray to God all my&#xD;
days to reward you for it !"&#xD;
Again for some time they were silent, but&#xD;
Bella, as she held his poor weak head to her j&#xD;
bosom, prayed an earnest prayer, a prayer of&#xD;
faith and hope, that she might see the day&#xD;
when the darkness should be lifted from his&#xD;
soul, which in moments like the present one&#xD;
seemed not far distant, and from that day&#xD;
John seemed more docile and manageable. In&#xD;
the meanwhile, before that interview ended&#xD;
she carried her point, and after lunch (which&#xD;
they eat alone, the two lovers being still away&#xD;
in heaven knows what part of the country) a&#xD;
messenger was dispatched to somebody who&#xD;
lived within half an hour's ride, and two hours&#xD;
later a tall form darkened the doorway of the&#xD;
library where John and his wife awaited him.&#xD;
It was their legal adviser, none other than ex-&#xD;
Judge Bates, the brother of the disgraced and&#xD;
discharged cashier of Messrs. Going &amp;amp; Son.&#xD;
lie was reputed the handsomest man of his&#xD;
age in all the country round. Very tall and&#xD;
well proportioned, his imposing figure was&#xD;
well sustained by a stateliness of manner al-&#xD;
most too aristocratic for a citizen of this free&#xD;
and democratic country. lie wore no beard,&#xD;
his features were finely cut in a noble mold,&#xD;
his complexion exceedingly delicate, piercing&#xD;
black eyes and long snow-white locks, falling&#xD;
down to his coat collar, intelligence enthroned&#xD;
upon his lofty forehead, austerly dignified,&#xD;
calm pride, and self-reliance in every gesture,&#xD;
and every slow spoken word of his clear ring-&#xD;
ing voice ; this was Judge Eben Bates of Mas-&#xD;
sachusetts.&#xD;
"Judge," said John Van Strom, after the&#xD;
usual greetings, " I have asked you to step up&#xD;
here because I want to make my will."&#xD;
" I am at your service, sir," answered the&#xD;
lawyer. " Do you wish your wife to be pre-&#xD;
sent ?"&#xD;
" I think the law does not prohibit her at-&#xD;
tendance ?" said John, sharply.&#xD;
"Not that I am aware of, sir."  So they&#xD;
proceeded to business, John had prepared a&#xD;
list of his property, and divided it equally be-&#xD;
tween his wife and Josephine Van Strom.&#xD;
Judge Bates, at this point, opened his eyes as&#xD;
wide as his dignity permitted and glanced side-&#xD;
ways at Bella with strange and irrepressible&#xD;
wonder at her happy smile.&#xD;
" According to this document, sir," said&#xD;
Judge Bates, sonorously, "your wife receives&#xD;
only half your property."&#xD;
"Quite right, old gentleman,=' said John&#xD;
leaning back into Bella's arms, which awaited&#xD;
him.&#xD;
"Quite right, and very satisfactory, sir,"&#xD;
corroborated Bella, tersely.&#xD;
"Before it escapes my memory," said Judge&#xD;
Bates, laying down his pen (for he had been&#xD;
taking notes), with apparent indifference, " I&#xD;
would beg leave to interrupt you a moment.&#xD;
You remember that matter of fifteen thousand&#xD;
dollars, which you were good enough to ad-&#xD;
vance me upon a second mortgage upon my&#xD;
house ?"&#xD;
" A second mortgage, sir ?" asked John,&#xD;
quickly, coloring with sudden astonishment.&#xD;
" I thought it was a first mortgage."&#xD;
&#xD;
" I told you distinctly, sir, that I had already&#xD;
given a first mortgage on my house to another&#xD;
party," said the old lawyer, in a tone of in-&#xD;
ured innocence.&#xD;
"I did not understand it that way, sir,"&#xD;
rejoined John, sharply. " You said that you&#xD;
were about paying off a mortgage which had&#xD;
become due, and out of respect to you, I did&#xD;
not have the county records examined t" and&#xD;
John would have said more had not his&#xD;
wife nudged him to control himself. Ever&#xD;
sensible to her admonitions he stopped here,&#xD;
though his face betrayed his angry feelings on&#xD;
the subject.&#xD;
"I am astonished at your misinterpretation,&#xD;
sir," answered Judge Bates.   " That first&#xD;
mortgage is going to be paid off and you may&#xD;
consider yours a first mortgage with impunity,&#xD;
I used the term second for the sake of adhering&#xD;
to the present legal condition of the caseI"&#xD;
All right," said John, ill-humoredly. " Let&#xD;
us resume our business."&#xD;
" You do not wish to leave any thing to any&#xD;
one else f" asked Eben Bates, pointedly, peer-&#xD;
ing out from beneath his bushy white eye.&#xD;
brows at his client.&#xD;
With a woman's quick     intuition Bella&#xD;
thought that he was fishing for something to&#xD;
be left to him-perhaps fifteen thousand dol-&#xD;
lars to pay off his own mortgage, and at the&#xD;
thought she could hardly conceal her anger&#xD;
and loathing for the old lawyer, in spite of his&#xD;
white hair and venerable countenance.&#xD;
"Nothing to any one else," said John,&#xD;
dryly.&#xD;
" Now please to name your executors,"'said&#xD;
Judge Bates, resuming his pen without be-&#xD;
traying any feeling of disappointment.&#xD;
"For executrix, Bella Van Strom, my wife,&#xD;
for executor, added as an assistant and adviser&#xD;
to her, Ernest Montant of New York."&#xD;
"How do you spell that name ?" asked&#xD;
Judge Bates, between his teeth, as he bent&#xD;
over his paper to write it down; and after it&#xD;
was correctly written, he said-&#xD;
" May I be permitted to ask, considering my&#xD;
many yaars'and professional experience, who&#xD;
is this Mr. Montant ? Considering my posi-&#xD;
tion as your solicitor, sir, I think it my duty&#xD;
to advise you to appoint some lawyer, one in&#xD;
whom you repose trust and confidence, to the&#xD;
all important office of executor I"&#xD;
"Mr. Bates," answered John, quickly, "you&#xD;
may either write out my last will and testa-&#xD;
ment, or you can leave it alone. I have not&#xD;
asked any counsel from you, and if you think&#xD;
you can push yourself into this position of&#xD;
executor, you have got into the wrong box&#xD;
with me, I assure you."&#xD;
"Such words as those you have spoken,&#xD;
sir," said Judge Bates, with an angry flash of&#xD;
his black eyes, "are unbecoming for you to&#xD;
utter, or for me to hear I I trust my age and&#xD;
reputation will sufficiently protect me from&#xD;
such vile accusations as you have taken the&#xD;
liberty to express. Were it not for the respect&#xD;
I have for your old name, and the mem-&#xD;
ory of your father, I should certainly leave&#xD;
this room at once, never to return."&#xD;
Again Bella had to interfere, and make&#xD;
peace between them. As the old lawyer was&#xD;
&#xD;
not really anxious to make good his declara-&#xD;
tion of war, and John's rising temper was&#xD;
easily repressed by her experience, she suc-&#xD;
ceeded.  The consequence was that Judge&#xD;
Bates exhibited once more his better nature,&#xD;
and John regained his good humor, even&#xD;
inviting his late opponent to stay to dinner,&#xD;
which the old lawyer gladly accepted. And&#xD;
so John Van Strom's will was made.&#xD;
"I am really glad to accept your invitation,"&#xD;
said Judge Bates; " for my daughter Bessie is&#xD;
not at home to-day, and I am miserable with-&#xD;
out her company."&#xD;
" Your brother, Mr. Martin Bates, is at your&#xD;
house, I believe," said Bella, carelessly.&#xD;
" Yes, ma'am; but he and I have never been&#xD;
of the same tastes or dispositions. I gave&#xD;
him an asylum at my house because he was&#xD;
poor and friendless. I will always extend&#xD;
hpitality to those who are in need; but sym-&#xD;
pathy and affection can not be bestowed from&#xD;
a mere sense of duty upon objects of general&#xD;
charity."&#xD;
Josephine Van Strom and our hero came&#xD;
home to dinner. The blush caused by fresh&#xD;
air and exercise was on her cheeks ; certainly&#xD;
it was only the blush of healthy exertion out&#xD;
of doors. Maybe her face unconsciously be-&#xD;
trayed the raptures of love which had been&#xD;
hers this happy day. Bella alone knew the&#xD;
real cause that made her eyes brighter, her&#xD;
cheeks redder, and her expression so radiant&#xD;
with happiness, for their engagement, their&#xD;
love was not as yet promulgated. So, when&#xD;
Bella wicked at Josephine in her mischievously&#xD;
sly manner, the fair widow could not choose&#xD;
but blush, while Ernest Montant vainly en-&#xD;
deavored to conceal the fact that lie was in&#xD;
very high spirits, and mightily proud of some&#xD;
new thing. He soon found an opportunity to&#xD;
take Bella aside and whisper to her:-&#xD;
"Good luck, sister-in-law ! I am poor, and&#xD;
deserted by nearly all my old friends; but to-&#xD;
day I feel able to fight the whole world I"&#xD;
Isere John Van Strom came up with Judge&#xD;
Bates, and imtrosduced the gentlemen to each&#xD;
other. When this little ceremony was over,&#xD;
the old lawyer turned to his host, with a look&#xD;
of astonishment, at the evident youth of the&#xD;
appointed executor, and asked:&#xD;
"Is it possible that this gentleman is Mr.&#xD;
Ernest Montant, sir ?"&#xD;
John Van Strom looked a moment at our&#xD;
hero, as though to be sure of his identity;&#xD;
then placing both hands behind his back,&#xD;
answered, with a decided bow and decisive&#xD;
tone, Yes, sir."&#xD;
The old lawyer did not seem inclined to&#xD;
court the acquaintance of John Van Strom's&#xD;
executor, in future, and  Ernest Montant,&#xD;
although much impressed by the noble ap-&#xD;
pearance of the old gentleman, was not the&#xD;
nan to make advances without encouragement.&#xD;
All the more did Judge Bates devote himself&#xD;
to Josephine Van Strom at dinner, bestowing&#xD;
upon her a hundred little marks of attention&#xD;
and gallantry, which she, being in a very&#xD;
good humor, received very graciously. Our'&#xD;
hero muttered,-&#xD;
"Hang his extraordinary politeness. If he&#xD;
Were twenty years younger, upon my word I'd&#xD;
&#xD;
be jealous. Of course gallantry in old gentle-&#xD;
men is very well to a certain extent, but I&#xD;
rather think Judge Bates carries it a little&#xD;
further than any one else I ever saw. Posi-&#xD;
tively, it seems to me more like foppishness."&#xD;
And then Martin Bates. cane before his&#xD;
memory's gaze, as he had sat opposite him in&#xD;
the English club-house, when narrating the&#xD;
scenes of his life, given in a previous chapter;&#xD;
and with the voice of the old cashier still ring-&#xD;
ing in his ears, as he execrated his heartless&#xD;
brother, he gazed upon the judge's innocent&#xD;
face, and said to himself,-&#xD;
" This is the man who is accused of betraying&#xD;
his brother,-this man, with every mark of&#xD;
high-toned dignity,-of having permitted that&#xD;
brother to suffer a terrible disgrace for crime&#xD;
which he, this white-haired emblem of virtue&#xD;
and honor, had committed. Is it possible ?&#xD;
Did Martin lie?"&#xD;
And as lie contemplated the stately figure&#xD;
before him, and noted the expression of the&#xD;
noble face, he doubted no longer but that&#xD;
Martin had indeed lied.&#xD;
CHAPTER II.&#xD;

"I know her answer."&#xD;
.Whast?"&#xD;
" She will net."&#xD;
"The fouler fortune mine, and there an end."&#xD;
''AMING OF THE SHEEW.&#xD;
Wiax Martin Bates left the office of Going&#xD;
&amp;amp; Son he felt as though every door was&#xD;
closed to him that might have led another to&#xD;
competence or support, and wandered around&#xD;
the city like an accursed spirit.&#xD;
Several days afterward Judge BaM      all&#xD;
unconscious of his brother's ill-fortune, was&#xD;
sitting at tea with his daughter, at his own&#xD;
house, in Massachusetts. Miss Bessie, only&#xD;
child of his first wife, whom he had married in&#xD;
England, under the circumstances related by&#xD;
Martin in his confidential mood, to our hero,&#xD;
assumed the duties of housewife. In these&#xD;
duties she was assisted by an old housekeeper,&#xD;
well-bred, and deeply attached to the family.&#xD;
No wonder, then, that Miss Bessie's father&#xD;
was loath to encourage her marriage. No&#xD;
wonder that when Walter Going paid his ad-&#xD;
dresses to her the old lawyer was glad to find&#xD;
in the young gentleman's acknowledged reck-&#xD;
lessness, rather wild manner, and loose views,&#xD;
a valid excuse to oppose the match. But&#xD;
reason proposes and love disposes, and the two&#xD;
had secretly reached the relationship in which&#xD;
we have seen them at the Priory; in fact, they&#xD;
were engaged without her father's knowledge,&#xD;
or slightest suspicion.&#xD;
Judge Bates was the most rigid observer of&#xD;
moral principles in the village, and said a long&#xD;
extempore grace befot-e each meal. In this&#xD;
exemplary devotion he was this night inter-&#xD;
rupted by a ring at the front door. The ser-&#xD;
vant entered with a perplexed face.&#xD;
"An old man outside, sir. I don't know&#xD;
who lie is ; sure. he don't look like a gentle-&#xD;

man, and" not like a blag-gard, saving your&#xD;
presence ; and he want's to see the Jidge,&#xD;
ma'am." So Judge Bates forgot the half-fin-&#xD;
ished grace, and went to the door.&#xD;
He staid away five minutes, ten minutes,&#xD;
half an hour. Miss Bessie had tea removed.&#xD;
She then sat down by the fire-still necessary&#xD;
in the evening, though by the calendar it was&#xD;
almost summer-and listened to the storm&#xD;
which was howling around the house, and rat-&#xD;
tling in the chimney. Still her father did not&#xD;
return. A horrible feeling of anxiety came&#xD;
over her; but she did not deem it prudent to&#xD;
go and search him out; so, still she waited and&#xD;
listened. It seemed to her that there were un-&#xD;
wholesome voices in the air; a vague presenti-&#xD;
ment of evil possessed her; by degrees she&#xD;
grew nervous, and finally decided to go and see&#xD;
what was keeping him so long ; but as she&#xD;
arose to go to the door, it opened, and her&#xD;
father appeared, pale and agitated. le was&#xD;
not alone; an old man followed him, with tot-&#xD;
tering steps, who, without speaking a word,&#xD;
or raising his downcast eyes, seemed to grope&#xD;
his way to the fire, and there crouched,&#xD;
shivering. Bessie looked at him with a strange&#xD;
awe. His sunken eyes, his attenuated fea-&#xD;
tures, his shreds of uncombed gray hair, his&#xD;
trembling limbs, his shabby coat, wet with&#xD;
rain, his whole appearance repulsive, frightened&#xD;
her; but there was something familiar in it&#xD;
all. She stood, affrighted, gazing and wonder-&#xD;
ing, until her father, who had regarded the&#xD;
stranger with a cold, disdainful look, broke the&#xD;
spell by saying, sternly:-&#xD;
"This is your Uncle Martin, Bessie, of&#xD;
whom I have sometimes spoken to you. You&#xD;
can make his acquaintance to-morrow; at pres-&#xD;
ent you will oblige us by leaving the room,&#xD;
for we have business of importance to dis-&#xD;
cuss."&#xD;
She advanced a step as if to welcome her&#xD;
uncle; but Martin Bates did not look up, or&#xD;
seem to be aware of her presence. So she&#xD;
timidly left the room to spend the rest of the&#xD;
evening in fear and anxiety, and then to bed,&#xD;
to dream of Uncle Martin, in the most horri-&#xD;
ble manner, for he appeared to her in the&#xD;
most un-uncle-like shapes, and oppressed her&#xD;
with the most ingenious tortures of dream-land.&#xD;
Judge Bates took a seat opposite his bro-&#xD;
ther, and both stared silently into the fire for&#xD;
a long while until the servant brought in a&#xD;
bottle of brandy and some hot water, which&#xD;
she placed upon a table between the two and&#xD;
left the room.&#xD;
"I had to send to the village for this," said&#xD;
Eben Bates, ill-humoredly, " for not a drop&#xD;
of the vile stuff is ever kept in my house,&#xD;
sir.s&#xD;
"I would not have asked for it, brother,&#xD;
were I not chilled through and totally ex-&#xD;
hausted. Although I habitually use spirits, yet&#xD;
I respect your abstinence."&#xD;
" Which should be made law1" said Judge&#xD;
Bates, sternly. Martin nodded demurely.&#xD;
" You are celebrated for all the virtues," he&#xD;
said, slowly, still keeping his gaze fixed on the&#xD;
fire. "Whether you .have true charity in&#xD;
your heart, is a question between you and&#xD;
your God!"&#xD;
&#xD;
"We are judged by what we do," answered&#xD;
the elder brother. "I have devoted myself to&#xD;
the promulgation of high moral ideas."&#xD;
" Promulgation by force ?" queried Martin, in&#xD;
a low voice.&#xD;
"If necessary, yes !"  "I would make total&#xD;
abstinence a law ! At any cost I would make&#xD;
slavery illegal! I would-"&#xD;
"Stop; would you break the chains of the&#xD;
slave, knowing that he would die under the&#xD;
operation ?"&#xD;
"Dead or alive, slavery must cease to pol-&#xD;
lute this free soilI"&#xD;
"The liberty of the grave," said Martin. " Do&#xD;
you know, Eben, I sometimes doubt that you&#xD;
have true charity, true love for poor hu-&#xD;
manity?"&#xD;
"I am a man of principle I" answered the&#xD;
other. " My life .is devoted to religion and to&#xD;
the improvement of the public morality."&#xD;
" And how about the correction of private&#xD;
immorality ?"&#xD;
" I wash my hands of it. Let those who fall&#xD;
from grace look to themselves"&#xD;
" Eben," said Martin, impetuously, " what&#xD;
I hear from you is the cant of religion based&#xD;
on heartlessness. We can dispense with the&#xD;
mask when we are alone, for I know you well-&#xD;
You speak of charity? You may subscribe to&#xD;
the meeting-house and abolition societies ; you&#xD;
may be at the head of the poor-houses and&#xD;
prisons; but I know you would have turned&#xD;
your poor brother away from your door this&#xD;
night had you been sure the world should never&#xD;
have known it."&#xD;
Judge Bates's dark looks were confirmation&#xD;
strong enough; but he said with some vexa-&#xD;
ation,-I&#xD;
" You come to my unpolluted house branded&#xD;
as a thief! If the world knew of your crime,&#xD;
surely, I could not have subjected myself to&#xD;
public disgrace, by giving you aid and comfort&#xD;
under my own roof."&#xD;
"Eben," said Martin, deadly pale, but very&#xD;
calm, ''did I not steal that money for you?&#xD;
Did you not receive the fifteen thousand dol-&#xD;
lars out of my employer's coffers ?"&#xD;
"It seems so, indeed; but at the time I did&#xD;
not know that it was stolen! I had fifteen&#xD;
thousand dollars ready to repay them, which I&#xD;
borrowed of John Van Strom upon a mortgage&#xD;
on my house."&#xD;
"At last," said Martin, with open contempt,&#xD;
"at last you have forgotten yourself, and show&#xD;
your true character. In other words, you pro-&#xD;
vided yourself with money to repay me in case&#xD;
I should tell people you received it, and owe it&#xD;
to Mr. Going. But since it all remains on my&#xD;
shoulders, you never mean to restore what you&#xD;
have received!"&#xD;
"Put it in that light !" cried Judge Bates.&#xD;
"Make me give my last penny away, because&#xD;
you gave me-it was not a loan, sir-because&#xD;
you gave me some money once upon a time!&#xD;
Tell every one the secret ! Make me a pauper,&#xD;
ruin me, drive me to the grave, and blast my&#xD;
daughter's happiness for ever! It would not&#xD;
astonish me in you !"&#xD;
" Eben," answered Martin, solemnly, "do I&#xD;
deserve this, after having sacrificed my honor&#xD;
for you these two times, first in England, and&#xD;
&#xD;
then here, when you wrote to me that you&#xD;
must have money?"&#xD;
"The old story," said Judge Bates, who was&#xD;
fast losing his dignity of. speech and manner&#xD;
in the conversation. " Thirty years ago, you&#xD;
and I were boys. I committed a piece of boy-&#xD;
ish folly; had an intrigue with your colonel's&#xD;
wife, and by a strange combination of circum-&#xD;
stances, you were suspected in place of me.&#xD;
You had nothing to lose but your commission,&#xD;
while I was engaged to be married; you good-&#xD;
naturedly consented to leave the world unde-&#xD;
ceived. Luck was against you, and you were&#xD;
condemned to a great disgrace, and yet you&#xD;
charge me, thirty years afterward, with your&#xD;
misfortunes. It is absurd!"&#xD;
"Be it absurd," said Martin, drearily. " At&#xD;
all events this is a strange version of that story.&#xD;
I have suffered for your sins ever since we&#xD;
were at school, and I only wonder for what&#xD;
purpose you, with your high position at the&#xD;
bar, required money so badly as to induce me,&#xD;
poor fool, to steal it for you! With the first&#xD;
five hundred you- asked of me, came a most&#xD;
earnest appeal to my brotherly love; but the&#xD;
more I sent, the more you wanted, until&#xD;
with that and my own extravagance, I became&#xD;
pressed for cash-went into speculations-&#xD;
lost more, and finally stole money to make it&#xD;
up ! You owe Going &amp;amp; Son fifteen thousand&#xD;
dollars, Judge Bates!1"&#xD;
" And I tell you that this is a falsehood, sir.&#xD;
What I wanted with the money, is my affair;&#xD;
and, as I never promised to repay it, I would&#xD;
like to see the court of justice which would&#xD;
give decision against me I"&#xD;
."Eben," cried his brother, "when people&#xD;
are thoroughly dishonest, they always have&#xD;
the law in their mouths. But be that as it may,&#xD;
I have served you all my life, and the conse-&#xD;
quence is, that the world has always smiled&#xD;
upon you, while it only snarls at me like a&#xD;
wild beast, and shows its teeth at every step I&#xD;
take."&#xD;
"Do I snarl at you and show my teeth ?"&#xD;
asked Judge Bates, in a changed tone. There&#xD;
was a soft affection shadowed in his voice, a&#xD;
kindness and persuasive unction, whose value&#xD;
with a jury he well know. Was he now more&#xD;
sincere than when in the exercise of his pro-&#xD;
fessiona? God and he only knew ; but Martin&#xD;
was moved by the simplest show of sympathy&#xD;
from his elder brother-moved to tears.&#xD;
"OhI" he cried, "this is the voice, Eben,&#xD;
which appealed to me in the barracks prison&#xD;
thirty years ago. Against the voice of nature&#xD;
I have no weapons, and I belong to you, body&#xD;
and soul, when you approach me thus. Let&#xD;
the world go. I love you, Eben, and you can&#xD;
reward me for all I have suffered by an hour&#xD;
of kindness !"&#xD;
The old man bowed his head and wept.&#xD;
"Let us be friends, then," continued the elder&#xD;
brother, in the same smooth, caressing voice.&#xD;
"Take my hand, Martin ! I will not forsake&#xD;
you. Live in my house, and call it your home&#xD;
for the rest of your life."&#xD;
ArAd old Martin Bates, broken-down in body&#xD;
andspirit by the consequences, not of an evil,&#xD;
but of an almost crazy transaction, took the&#xD;
proffered hand, the hand of the man that owed&#xD;
&#xD;
him every thing, caught it eagerly as though&#xD;
it were the greatest condescension of some&#xD;
superior being.&#xD;
So the two old men, each queer in his way,&#xD;
and together exemplifying how craftiness can&#xD;
take advantage of brotherly love combined&#xD;
with a weak character, sat late into the night&#xD;
speaking of various subjects. Martin was all&#xD;
confiding, all affectionate. Eben reserved all&#xD;
his secrets, and his manner toward his brother&#xD;
soon fell back into the stately dignity, for&#xD;
which he was so celebrated. Their heads were&#xD;
white; whether they thought of death, and af-&#xD;
ter death, the judgment, or, from other reasons,&#xD;
they henceforward lived in apparent peace and&#xD;
happiness, Eben displaying a high-toned kind-&#xD;
Jiness to his brother, Martin sinking each day&#xD;
into a fixed melancholy, each day shrinking&#xD;
together in body and soul.&#xD;
He would sit mute and lost in vague&#xD;
thoughts for hours, and at such times his face&#xD;
wore the livid hue of death. Like a thing&#xD;
half-defunct already, he moved ghostily around&#xD;
the house; but he was most affectionate to his&#xD;
niece, Bessie. Ilow little did she dream of the&#xD;
character of his thoughts toward her ; how&#xD;
little could she interpret his soliloquy when she&#xD;
saw his lips move silently; and how distressed&#xD;
and terrified she would have been had she&#xD;
heard the words formed by those pale lips,-&#xD;
"God, if a felon's prayer can find grace with&#xD;
thee, let her father's sins not be visited upon&#xD;
her innocent head 1"&#xD;
*      *      *      *      *&#xD;
A few days after our hero's arrival at John&#xD;
Van Strom's house, Judge Bates appeared&#xD;
very much pre-occupied one morning, and par-&#xD;
took of his breakfast without a word for any&#xD;
one. He was dressed with such care that his&#xD;
daughter remarked it, and asked, smiling,-&#xD;
" Is there a great law-case on hand to-day,&#xD;
papa, or, are you going to make love to one of&#xD;
your numerous lady admirers '"&#xD;
To which " papa" replied with a monosyl-&#xD;
lable, and remained intrenched behind his&#xD;
stately reserve. As it was such beautiful&#xD;
weather, lae did not order his carriage, but&#xD;
told Bessie, with a ceremonious kiss, that she&#xD;
need not expect him before evening, though he&#xD;
might return much sooner, and then he strode&#xD;
out of the door. Bessie went to the window&#xD;
and followed him with her eyes, as he walked,&#xD;
tall and erect, toward Mr. Van Strom's house.&#xD;
He was so lost in thought that a beggar-wo-&#xD;
man on the roadside failed to attract his atten-&#xD;
tion. His handsome face, his snowy-hair, each&#xD;
seemed to have received particular attention&#xD;
this morning, and never had the handsome old&#xD;
gentleman looked handsomer.&#xD;
Active, and in full possession of his bodily&#xD;
strength, he covered the distance, some three&#xD;
miles, within an hour, and rang the bell at&#xD;
Van Strom's door. The servant informed him&#xD;
that Mr. and Mrs. Van Strom were out ; but&#xD;
when he looked through the open door, he saw&#xD;
Josephine with a book in her hand sit-&#xD;
ting in the drawing-room. An expression of&#xD;
satisfaction overspread his countenance, and&#xD;
he stepped in quickly. She arose and held out&#xD;
her hand ; ho looked at her for a moment with&#xD;
undisguised adgiiration, struck by her charm-&#xD;

GOING AND SON.&#xD;
&#xD;
ing appearance in a morning dress, with her&#xD;
golden hair fallen about her in loosely-gathered&#xD;
braids.&#xD;
" Excuse my appearance, Judge Bates," she&#xD;
said, in her deep, melodious voice, " I am&#xD;
hardly presentable."&#xD;
" I am too old for compliments, madam," he&#xD;
answered, " or I would assure you of the con-&#xD;
trary. Do I find you alone ?"&#xD;
" Yes, I'am sorry to say. Bella and John&#xD;
have driven out, and our guest, Mr. Montant,&#xD;
went to the village about some business, I be-&#xD;
lieve."&#xD;
"Mrs. Van Strom," said he, after they were&#xD;
seated, " I am delighted to meet you alone, for&#xD;
I want to speak to you on a matter of some&#xD;
importance."&#xD;
She looked at him expectant-&#xD;
" I am fifty-seven years of age, and I have&#xD;
agrown-up daughter," said Judge Bates, slight-&#xD;
ly flushed, in spite of his determination to ap-&#xD;
pear at his ease. "I have a name second to none&#xD;
in the State, and the question is, whether I&#xD;
can still call myself young enough to harbor&#xD;
any thoughts of marriage."&#xD;
Not dreaming of what this was the perora-&#xD;
tion, she answered naively,-&#xD;
I think, sir, that you are younger than&#xD;
most gentlemen of forty, and although I don't&#xD;
feel competent to give any valuable opinion on&#xD;
a matter of such importance. I should say that&#xD;
there would be nothing extraordinary in your&#xD;
marrying again. But why -sk me such a ques-&#xD;
tion, sir?  Do you contemplate-"&#xD;
" I do, Mrs. Van Strom." he answered, red-&#xD;
der than before, because he thought lie was&#xD;
sure.of his case. "And let me plead my cause&#xD;
like ,a man, old enough to be your father, and&#xD;
not like a young and fiery lover. for that I can&#xD;
not be. I believe you are without means, I&#xD;
know at least that John's father did not pro-&#xD;
vide for you, and I do not suppose that John&#xD;
has settled any estate on you, since his father's&#xD;
death. Therefore I have hopes that you will&#xD;
incline a favorable ear to the offer I have come&#xD;
to make to you to-day. I will give you a home,&#xD;
a good name, and all the love that is left in&#xD;
my old heart. If you will think of it, let rea-&#xD;
son and prudence urge my suit, and be assured&#xD;
that I have all the affection for yon that is&#xD;
requisite to make you happy. Remember that&#xD;
you have experienced the happiness and the&#xD;
misery of marrying a man whom you loved,&#xD;
but whose character was not yet fornmed, and&#xD;
who disappointed you in the end, and consider&#xD;
that it may be most advisable for you, in your&#xD;
condition, to form an alliance which may make&#xD;
up by safety, peace, and a happy home, for&#xD;
the lack of an intensity of love which I ann not&#xD;
fool enough to expect."&#xD;
Ile paused. She had listened with growing&#xD;
astonishment, and colored crimson; not from&#xD;
what he thought agitated her, but from shame&#xD;
at having hastily made a speech which could&#xD;
not fail to encourage him to speak out. It&#xD;
took some time for her to regain her presence&#xD;
of mind, so the Judge gained the opportunity&#xD;
to plead his cause; but when ie finished, her&#xD;
answer, as the reader may imagine, caused&#xD;
Judge Bates to leave the house, a throrouighly&#xD;
disappointed man, and Josephine, when she&#xD;
&#xD;
was left alone, cried a little, but laughed a&#xD;
little also. While she was thus innocently&#xD;
amusing herself a wagon drove up. It was&#xD;
Bella and John returning from their drive, and&#xD;
mirabile diciea/ the same yellow mare, Bella,&#xD;
that had dragged John into his marriage, was&#xD;
she, that John was now leading to the stable,&#xD;
followed, at a respectful distance, by the groom&#xD;
who had been in waiting.&#xD;
" What is the matter, Josephine ?" asked&#xD;
Bella, as she embraced her sister. "We just&#xD;
met old Mr. Bates walking rapidly away and&#xD;
looking much agitated. Has he been here ?"&#xD;
Josephine answered evasively under her&#xD;
sister's sharp scrutiny and close questioning.&#xD;
" I believe he has been here."&#xD;
"And what have you been talking about?"&#xD;
pursued Bella.&#xD;
"I promised not to tell," answered Joseph.&#xD;
ine, innocently, whereupon Bella sat down.&#xD;
opened her eyes as widely as possible, and&#xD;
burst into a peal of laughter, in which Joseph.&#xD;
ine could not help joining.&#xD;
"So he actually proposed?  Did you accept&#xD;
him ?" and again Bella gave way to her merri.&#xD;
ment.&#xD;
" I never could keep a secret !" cried Joseph.&#xD;
ine, in dismay. " The harder I try the sooner&#xD;
it is discovered! Well, since you have guessed&#xD;
it, he told me that since he was rich and I was&#xD;
poor-"&#xD;
" What?" cried Bella, very earnestly, all of&#xD;
a sudden.   "le told you that since you&#xD;
were-"&#xD;
" Poor--" repeated Josephine. " and-"&#xD;
The villain!" muttered the tailor's daugh-&#xD;
ter. "I can see now what he is after."&#xD;
" What do you mean, Bella?"&#xD;
"What do I mean ?" she cried, in a rage.&#xD;
"I mean that he has just drawn up John's&#xD;
last will, and that he knows, as well as I do,&#xD;
that John has left you very rich. That's what&#xD;
he wants to marry you for!"&#xD;
The news that she would be rich some day&#xD;
could not but till the widow's brain with the&#xD;
brightest and happiest thoughts, for her lover&#xD;
came to her mind in an instant. She had not&#xD;
expected it. Her innocence in worldly matters&#xD;
had made it easy for her to accustom herself&#xD;
to the thought that the Van Strom property&#xD;
was never to benefit her, and, so far, her wild-&#xD;
est hopes had not reached beyond a wished-for&#xD;
loan from John to start her future husband in&#xD;
business.  This news, therefore, well-nigh&#xD;
overpowered her; but, before she could real-&#xD;
ize it, the door opened and our hero entered.&#xD;
With a cry of joy, she rushed into his arms&#xD;
and they had a good long embrace.&#xD;
"Why did you stay so long, Ernest?" she&#xD;
asked, when she could free her lovely lips from&#xD;
his, so as to speak at all.&#xD;
" Couldn't help it, baby," replied he, but the&#xD;
conversation was always apt to proceed under&#xD;
continued interruptions, until they could so far&#xD;
accustom themselves to the delight of being&#xD;
together as to speak like sensible people,---and&#xD;
then Josephine imparted to her lover the good&#xD;
news, that she was a "rich woman, and all&#xD;
was now clear before them."&#xD;
" However that may be," he answered, "I&#xD;
do not desire to investigate matters which bue-&#xD;
&#xD;
long to the future, especially as it is my inten-'&#xD;
tion to rely upon my own strength and labor&#xD;
alone, accepting what may, in the course of&#xD;
kind providence, be in store for you, as a gift&#xD;
of fortune unloolged for.'1&#xD;
CHAPTER III.&#xD;
THE ITALIAN   GIRL.&#xD;
"P'ots have I laid, inductions dangerous."&#xD;
Kise RICHARD III.&#xD;
OUa esteemed acquaintance, Mr. Antonio&#xD;
Stilletto, found himself called to Boston and&#xD;
decided to make the journey in company with&#xD;
his faithful ally, the great German philosopher,&#xD;
Mr. August Muller, and also a young lady,&#xD;
dressed in black and secluded from the vulgar&#xD;
gaze by an impenetrable veil. When this wor-&#xD;
shipful company found themselves at the New&#xD;
Haven depot in New York, Stilletto made ar-&#xD;
rangements with the conductor for the exclu-&#xD;
sive use of one of the compartments of the&#xD;
new-fashioned cars, paying therefor somewhat&#xD;
toward that official's house-rent.&#xD;
So they soon settled themselves comfortably,&#xD;
in anticipation of the long ride before them,&#xD;
Mr. Muller in one corner of the back seat, Mr.&#xD;
Stilletto in the other, and the veiled lady&#xD;
couched upon the front sofa, seemingly regard-&#xD;
less of appearances.&#xD;
Mr. Muller's philosophy teaches that it is a&#xD;
needless expense to shave when traveling, and&#xD;
as he considers himself a traveler, from the&#xD;
time he makes up his mind to start until he&#xD;
arrives at his destination, his growth of beard&#xD;
does not improve the appearance of his thin&#xD;
red face or conceal the perpetual sneer. Mr.&#xD;
Stilletto's chin is, on the contrary, just from&#xD;
the hands of the barber, his whiskers are dyed&#xD;
a jetty black, and a beautiful color; not the&#xD;
hue of youth, not the blush of health, but&#xD;
the rosy tint of " rouge," graces his sharp&#xD;
face. In fact, lie has made an exquisitely-vul-&#xD;
gar or vulgarly-exquisite toilet, and his shining&#xD;
silk hat and his immaculate gloves are calcula-&#xD;
ted to attract attention. Go where he may,&#xD;
written plainly on every inch of his bran-new&#xD;
exterior, are the words-- here goes a snob."&#xD;
These two worthies are smoking, and upon&#xD;
the vacant seat between them recline two bot-&#xD;
tles, whose appearance seems to please Mr.&#xD;
Muller, for he steals an affectionate glance to-&#xD;
ward them with his little blinking eyes, and&#xD;
the restlessness so noticeable in his move-&#xD;
ments would fully justify one in expecting the&#xD;
question which has been assuming to itself&#xD;
shape and words in his classic brain, voiding&#xD;
itself thus:--&#xD;
"Why is it that railroad-traveling makes&#xD;
one so thirsty?"&#xD;
"Because," answered Stilletto, "one hap-&#xD;
pens to be a drunkard, and a coward besides,&#xD;
who seeks excuses instead of coming out bold-&#xD;
ly and acknowledging the fact."-&#xD;
" Stilletto," began Muller,. proudly, sitting&#xD;
bolt upright, "my standing and intellect-"&#xD;
" Please don't," said Stilletto, disdainfully,.&#xD;
&#xD;
" Take your drink and stimulate yourself into&#xD;
a reasonable frame of mind if that is possible.&#xD;
I have something to say to you."&#xD;
The train had now left the suburbs of New&#xD;
York, and was dashing along on its smooth and&#xD;
firmset path in the open country, noiselessly&#xD;
enough to permit conversation in a half under-&#xD;
tone.&#xD;
Muller took the bottle, uncorked it. almost&#xD;
filled a cup which he produced from his&#xD;
pocket,.and cocking his little eye at the veiled&#xD;
lady, eried, " Here's a health to all good lasses I"&#xD;
The lady took no notice of his politeness, nor&#xD;
indeed had she appeared conscious of the&#xD;
existence of her fellow-passengers since she&#xD;
had first settled herself in her corner.&#xD;
"Now, then, Muller," commenced Stilletto,&#xD;
" the llobgoblin enterprise seems to be a fail-&#xD;
ure, hey ? The company is now fairly started;&#xD;
but while under Mr. Going's management of&#xD;
the factory, there really were some profits&#xD;
realized, yet under my management and yours,&#xD;
things go wrong."&#xD;
"Because you, my young friend, have not&#xD;
yet arrived at the age when we leave off all&#xD;
the pardonably easy ways of youth and attend&#xD;
to business."&#xD;
"It is true that I have a good deal of fun,&#xD;
and have not confined myself altogether to&#xD;
that accursed factory.  True, the foremen&#xD;
have cheated us, paying large wages to men&#xD;
that have done no work. True, my inventions&#xD;
and patents are not what old Fatman thinks&#xD;
they are. But then-"&#xD;
" But then," put in Mr. Muller, with an&#xD;
abstracted air, " we expected to make money&#xD;
anyhow, even tinder these untoward circum-&#xD;
stances, yet we have not made money."&#xD;
"-And we want money."&#xD;
"Precisely so," corroborated the philoso-&#xD;
pher with an approving nod. Whereupon a&#xD;
silence ensued as if their intellects required&#xD;
rest, after the laborious task of reaching this&#xD;
conclusion.&#xD;
" Mr. Going," continued Stilletto, after a&#xD;
pause, "has made a mistake, and is daily add-&#xD;
ing  to the proportions of that mistake. Ile&#xD;
holds the notes of the company to a large&#xD;
amount, and has pledged his shares in it to&#xD;
Mr. Chip, old Moneybags, you know, as secur-&#xD;
ity for the money lent to the company. Now,&#xD;
if the company fails to meet its engagements&#xD;
his notes become worthless and old Money-&#xD;
bags gets his shares. So you see, in helping&#xD;
the miserable concern along, hoping to bring&#xD;
it into a condition where his claims upon it&#xD;
would he met, he has just thrown good money&#xD;
after bad."&#xD;
" You state the case clearly, and with acute&#xD;
comprehension seldom found in one of your&#xD;
tender years, and therefore I find it the more&#xD;
astonishing."&#xD;
"Take another drink, Muller! you deserve&#xD;
one after that," said Stilletto.&#xD;
" Proceed," said the philosopher, after hav-&#xD;
ing helped himself most liberally.&#xD;
" Fatman," continued Stilletto, "has been&#xD;
obliged to invest some money in Hobgoblin,&#xD;
though sorely against his will, and the trustees&#xD;
have likewise had to lighten their purses hav-&#xD;
ing found out that, after all, a trustee, even&#xD;

though it be inconvenient, is expected to do&#xD;
something for the company that has purchased&#xD;
his great name to deceive the public with, so&#xD;
these have all bought some shares in addition&#xD;
to what was presented to them. Finally, oh&#xD;
great philosopher, every one will be the loser&#xD;
by Hobgoblin, though as yet nobody knows&#xD;
it but old Fatman, you and I, and Mr. Going.&#xD;
At least, if the latter don't know it now, he&#xD;
soon will, when his notes become due and are&#xD;
not paid. Then he will fail, Hobgoblin will&#xD;
suddenly be dead, the trustees will open their&#xD;
eyes and retire in disgust, and among the&#xD;
shareholders there will be weeping and gnash-&#xD;

but will they not make an effort to sell the&#xD;
shares at the Stock Exchange, and inaugurate&#xD;
such a speculation in them as to enable us all to&#xD;
realize before the final death of Hobgoblin ?"&#xD;
"That is only a chance. In the meanwhile&#xD;
we can not seil our shares, and having both&#xD;
been very extravagant, you as well as 1, want&#xD;
money."&#xD;
" Precisely so," repeated Muller ; and again&#xD;
there was a silence.&#xD;
"I am sorry for Mr. Going, after all," said&#xD;
Stilletto, in a sincere tone.&#xD;
"My young friend," said the philosopher,&#xD;
grandly, " God has instilled in our breasts the&#xD;
instinct of self-preservation by which alone we&#xD;
exist. though it must be confessed, to the de-&#xD;
triment of man and material around us.&#xD;
Therefore I beg leave to vary your words&#xD;
somewhat im clothing the sentiments of my&#xD;
soul and will say, I am sorry for ourselves."&#xD;
Without replying to these sublime words,&#xD;
Stilletto said, in a quick and altered manner,-&#xD;
"But we will get money where we are now&#xD;
bound to."&#xD;
" So you told me ; but-how ?"&#xD;
Stilletto was about to explain something&#xD;
which, to judge by the working of his counte-&#xD;
nance exercised his brain mightily, when he sud-&#xD;
denly chocked himself, and with an expression&#xD;
of doubt and distrust turned to the veiled&#xD;
lady. Ile had noticed, out of a corner of his&#xD;
sharp eye that she had altered her position&#xD;
slightly, and he saw even through her thick&#xD;
veil that her dark eyes of unusual luster and&#xD;
penetration were at this moment turned upon&#xD;
him. In a half-annoyed half-angry tone, he&#xD;
asked her abruptly,-&#xD;
"Simonetta, do you want any thing to eat&#xD;
or drink ?"'&#xD;
There was a strange constraint in her tone,&#xD;
as she answered, not very promptly,-&#xD;
" Non ho capito ci6 ie mi hai detto, caro&#xD;
mio."&#xD;
" Don't you really understand English,&#xD;
Netty ?" again inquired Stilletto, only half&#xD;
satisfied.&#xD;
She merely shook her head, and told him&#xD;
in Italian, that since he did not choose to ad-&#xD;
dress her in her native language she was un.&#xD;
able to understand or answer him. Stilletto&#xD;
was now satisfied, and after a few remarks&#xD;
exchanged between them in Italian, the lady&#xD;
turned her face away and seemed to settle her-&#xD;
self for a nap.&#xD;
"I can hardly bring my mind to believe&#xD;
&#xD;
FELONY.                        81&#xD;
&#xD;
LND SON.&#xD;
&#xD;
that she is deceiving you," said Muller to&#xD;
Stilletto. "I know that when that poor mis-&#xD;
guided creature, Martin Bates, was courting&#xD;
her, she had to teach him Italian before he&#xD;
could make much headway in conversation.&#xD;
Strange and incomprehensible fancy of an old&#xD;
man like him to propose honorable marriage&#xD;
to an organ-grinder's girl l And I believe, from&#xD;
my knowledge of the man, yes, I am certain&#xD;
that he was sincere. And then to have been&#xD;
circumvented at the last moment by her&#xD;
friends!I"&#xD;
" No, Muller. She had promised to meet him&#xD;
at Chatham Square, where he was to have a&#xD;
carriage in waiting, on the night of the very&#xD;
day his rather funny little transactions in&#xD;
Going's were discovered by that beloved&#xD;
friend of mine, Earnest Montant."&#xD;
" What about him?" asked Muller, who&#xD;
noticed that Stilletto showed malicious pro-&#xD;
pensities on pronouncing the name of our hero.&#xD;
" I have an old grudge against him," said&#xD;
the little man, "which old grudge may be set-&#xD;
tled in a new way in New England, where I&#xD;
expect to meet the gentleman. But to return&#xD;
to the girl opposite (she is asleep!); it was I&#xD;
who kept her from meeting Martin Bates. She&#xD;
did me the honor to prefer me to him, and the&#xD;
fierce brother who served as a mysterious and&#xD;
ever invisible bugbear to scare Martin, never&#xD;
existed, except in the person of myself. We&#xD;
loved each other then already," added Stilletto,&#xD;
with a coarse levity. .&#xD;
"But," said the philosopher, "let me ask&#xD;
you how a gentleman of your standing and&#xD;
prudence can expose himself to the merciless&#xD;
attacks of this gossiping, scandal-loving, and&#xD;
unjust world, by carrying his-well his mis-&#xD;
tress all over the country with him ? I must&#xD;
confess that August Muller, as husband to a&#xD;
sweet and pure wife, and as father to an inno-&#xD;
cent and growing family, can barely tolerate&#xD;
such company, and would not have tolerated&#xD;
it had you previously apprised me that the&#xD;
lady you intended to escort, was Simonetta&#xD;
Marini, the daughter of an organ-grinder, and&#xD;
your-"&#xD;
" I want amusement," said Stilletto, careless-&#xD;
ly, " and as far as the injustice of the world is&#xD;
concerned, I do not understand what you mean.&#xD;
If any one is sharp enough to recognize in my&#xD;
pretended sister the real character of that lady,&#xD;
I can see no injustice in his saying so where&#xD;
and when he chooses."&#xD;
"How if Mrs. Fatman should hear of it?"&#xD;
asked the philosopher, slyly.&#xD;
" I don't care a snap," was the impatient&#xD;
answer. " Women must have cause for jeal-&#xD;
ousy, flying into passions, bursting into tears,&#xD;
and considering themselves dreadfully injured&#xD;
by us men before they go crazy over us, as&#xD;
they should."&#xD;
Before this cool speech, when the name of&#xD;
Mrs. Fatman was mentioned, the veiled lady&#xD;
started as if something had disturbed her sleep.&#xD;
But then she was asleep, of course ! And&#xD;
even had she been awake, she could not un-&#xD;
derstand a word of English-had she not said&#xD;
so, and was it not true ?&#xD;
Is it possible that even the shrewdness ot&#xD;
Antonio Stilletto has been deceived by a&#xD;
&#xD;
woman? Is it possible that Simonetta Marini&#xD;
the outcast Italian girl, does understand En-&#xD;
glish ? If so, she has heard words which may&#xD;
fill a woman of her character with such hate&#xD;
as to employ the arts of a demon, poison, or&#xD;
a dagger to revenge herself.&#xD;
" My dear friend," resumed the philosopher,&#xD;
you have enticed this girl away from house&#xD;
and home. You have betrayed her, and intend&#xD;
to discard her when you become tired of her.&#xD;
I am certain you are her seducer."&#xD;
"I hope so," said Stilletto, boldly.&#xD;
" And do you not fear her friends ?  These&#xD;
Italians are insane in their revenge, and quick&#xD;
with the dirk."&#xD;
" So am I," answered Stilletto, who, as we&#xD;
have seen, was not a coward. "But, old fellow,&#xD;
I have done wonders in my time, by what you,&#xD;
in your philosophy, might call ' brass,' and&#xD;
how could I have achieved it if my courage&#xD;
had been tamed by that most disheartening&#xD;
feeling, called the fear of consequences ?"&#xD;
"Then, you stick at nothing ?" asked Muller,&#xD;
in a tone of undisguised awe.&#xD;
."Ilow does that follow ?" asked Stilletto,&#xD;
with a sneer.&#xD;
"'Because," replied the great philosopher,&#xD;
"when you fear no consequences, what is&#xD;
there to keep you from all manner of crimes&#xD;
when you can gain any thing by their perpe-&#xD;
tration ?"&#xD;
"My conscience, I suppose," said Stilletto,&#xD;
languidly.&#xD;
Muller looked attentively at him for a mo.&#xD;
nent, and failing to grow wiser by attempting&#xD;
to read that face, he gave up the argument&#xD;
with a sigh, and took some more whisky.&#xD;
Both drank freely, and it was not until dark-&#xD;
ness closed in that they fairly entered upon a&#xD;
discussion of what they expected to do in Mas-&#xD;
sachusetts.  The names- of Judge Bates and&#xD;
John Van Strom, of old Martin, and of Ernest&#xD;
Montant, were frequently mentioned, and Stil-&#xD;
letto's plans thoroughly'ventilated. Whether&#xD;
she understood English or not, every word of&#xD;
the conversation reached Simonetta's ears ;&#xD;
whether she understood English or not, her&#xD;
black eyes flashed fire, underneath her veil. She&#xD;
did not move a muscle for hours daring that&#xD;
conversation, but had darkness and the veil&#xD;
been lifted from her face, even the courage of&#xD;
a Stilletto might have failed him at the sight&#xD;
of her clenched teeth and flashing eyes. But&#xD;
then she does not understand English I Wheth-&#xD;
er or not, her hand has clutched the dagger&#xD;
she wears in her bosom; and thus the three&#xD;
pas ed- the greater part of that night in the&#xD;
train, which is steaming, and flying, and rat-&#xD;
tling through the darkness which lies over the&#xD;
lovely landscapes of New England.&#xD;
CHAPTER IV.&#xD;
MARTIN BATES PUZZLED.&#xD;
"Now I see the bottom of your purpose,"&#xD;
ALL's WELL THAT ENas WELL.&#xD;
JUDGE BATES'S residence, like most of the&#xD;
nrlas in the vicinity, was situated on a hill,&#xD;
6&#xD;
&#xD;
and surrounded-with gardens, orchards, arbors,&#xD;
and groves, the whole enclosed by a stout,&#xD;
rough stone wall. This wall, in front, was of&#xD;
dressed stone, to correspond with the facade&#xD;
of the house, and a handsome iron gate ad-&#xD;
mitted one to a wide, straight gravel walk,&#xD;
lined on either side with arbors, leading to the&#xD;
front door.&#xD;
The sun was setting at the lose of a bril-&#xD;
liaut day, when the two brothers, Eben, erect&#xD;
and stately, Martin, half crouching by his side,&#xD;
lingered near the gate on -returning from a&#xD;
walk through the distant fields.&#xD;
" Eben," said Martin, as they strolled along&#xD;
and into oneof the arbors, where the shadows&#xD;
of night had already stalked in under the som-&#xD;
ber roof of foliage, " Eben," said the old man,&#xD;
mournfully, "does it not seem incompatible with&#xD;
the wisdom of God that there should be even&#xD;
one existence on earth which is not only a&#xD;
burden and a weariness, oh, so inexpressibly&#xD;
tiresome to the one who should enjoy his life,&#xD;
but to every one else around him. 'Yet this&#xD;
is my sad case. Sometimes I have a forebod-&#xD;
ing, a presentiment that the eternal Providence&#xD;
has spared me for another task in life, that I&#xD;
am still to be a useful tool in the hands of fate.&#xD;
If this be so, if my work here be not yet com-&#xD;
plete, chance must direct the affair, for I no&#xD;
longer possess any energy. I am fast rust-&#xD;
ing away and sinking into that complete apathy&#xD;
which is akin to death."&#xD;
"Your life, Martin," answered the old&#xD;
judge, in a kind, almost tender voice, "has&#xD;
been a most useful one. You have saved a&#xD;
brother from the punishment which the sins&#xD;
of former years had called down upon his&#xD;
head; you have enabled him to become a good&#xD;
man and a useful citizen, and to hold his head&#xD;
high in the community, occupying a proud&#xD;
position, indeed !"&#xD;
" But, Eben," replied Martin, thoughtfully,&#xD;
"you are still in the toils of some dark mys-&#xD;
tery. To this day I am ignorant of the pur-&#xD;
pose for which you required the money I ob-&#xD;
tained for you by crime.   How  can you,&#xD;
therefore, hold your head high while this&#xD;
matter can not bear daylight?"&#xD;
" This point, Martin," said the judge, coldly,&#xD;
was long ago settled between us as forbidden&#xD;
ground. I can not explain. Your crime was&#xD;
not my fault. I asked -assistance from a bro-&#xD;
ther. le procured that assistatiee in his own&#xD;
way. Do his ways therefore become mine ?"&#xD;
Martin sighed. Oh, the power which that&#xD;
strong, proud man exerted over his weak-&#xD;
minded but affectionate brother! Like the dog&#xD;
that licks the hand that lately struck the cruel&#xD;
blow; like the slave, who clings to his master&#xD;
whose fetters weigh him to the ground so&#xD;
this strange creature, Martin Bates, loved his&#xD;
terrible brother.&#xD;
A footstep on the walk,-some one humming&#xD;
a song, and the brothers, looking out from&#xD;
the arbor to see who the intruder could be,&#xD;
beheld a little man, strolling aldng, smoking a&#xD;
cigar, with an air as if he owned an indefinite&#xD;
number of other rural residences infinitely&#xD;
superior to this one. The sun was now some'&#xD;
time at rest, and the stranger approached&#xD;
them closely .before they recognized him.&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb  n="82-83" xml:id="VAC7268-00000042"/>&#xD;
FELONY.                          83&#xD;
&#xD;
Judge Bates, with an altered manner, stared&#xD;
hard at the sharpface and shiny hat, as though&#xD;
he doubted the testimony of his eyes, but the&#xD;
disagreeable, bold voice that now accosted&#xD;
him, settled all his remaining doubts, and he&#xD;
started back with an exclamation of dismay,&#xD;
only half concealed by apparent indignation.&#xD;
"Good evening, Judge Bates," said our&#xD;
worthy friend, Antonio Stilletto. "I have&#xD;
been looking for you all over the place."&#xD;
" Have you, indeed ?" muttered the old man,&#xD;
between his teeth.&#xD;
" Ah," continued the little man, "I see my&#xD;
old friend, and your dear brother, Martin is&#xD;
with you. low-do you find yourself, my dear&#xD;
Martin," taking the old cashier's hand by force,&#xD;
and shaking it with an air of impudent famili-&#xD;
arity.&#xD;
" You here again," gasped the judge, still&#xD;
unable to control his vexation.&#xD;
"Yes, my dear Judge," answered Stilletto,&#xD;
apparently in an excellent humor, "and of&#xD;
course you will ask me to take a walk with you&#xD;
just outside the gate, and of course old Martin&#xD;
here will excuse us, and ofjcourse I will not&#xD;
stay to supper with you although you press&#xD;
me so kindly to do so, and, in short, you will,&#xD;
without the slightest doubt, do your best to&#xD;
accommodate your welcome guest." .&#xD;
Eben seemed irresolute. Here was a mo-&#xD;
ment in which the net that had entangled him&#xD;
for years, seemed capable of being torn to&#xD;
shreds by one bold action which only -required&#xD;
courage, for his reason had long ago pro-&#xD;
nounced in its favor. Then, weak irresolution&#xD;
with her thousand doubts and fears for the&#xD;
future, disarmed his reason, and he know no&#xD;
longer what he would or would not. lie&#xD;
glanced around him; he loved his gardens, his&#xD;
walks, his flowers. He looked toward the&#xD;
house on the hill; it was a monument of his&#xD;
high respectability; and a ray of light from one&#xD;
window fell upon his agonized eye. le knew&#xD;
whose window it was; lie knew his daughter&#xD;
Bessie was there, and he loved her l With a&#xD;
quick, impatient gesture, he bade Martin await&#xD;
him, and strode rapidly toward the gate, while&#xD;
Stilletto followed him with swaggering, rapid&#xD;
strides, noiseless as a cat.&#xD;
Martin remained rooted to the spot. He had&#xD;
not been aware that his brother knew Stilletto,&#xD;
whom he remembered well as the projector of&#xD;
Hobgoblin, and disliked accordingly. While&#xD;
he thus stood, bewildered and alarmed by&#xD;
doubts and fears for his brother, his eye fell&#xD;
upon a white object upon the ground.&#xD;
"Stilletto surely dropped  it out of his&#xD;
pocket," he soliloquized. "He is the most&#xD;
disorderly vagabond I ever saw, and I am&#xD;
sure he'll uin some grandsecheme yet by some&#xD;
act of petty carelessness."  So musing, the old&#xD;
man stooped and picked up the object, which&#xD;
proved to be a small package of papers, and&#xD;
instead of calling to the probable loser, who,&#xD;
with Eben, was just at the gate, Martin quickly&#xD;
concealed the bundle in the inner pocket of his&#xD;
coat, with a feeling of some satisfaction, for&#xD;
now, he doubted not, the mystery of Eben's&#xD;
life in America was to be solved.&#xD;
From a feeling of caution and the poses-&#xD;
sion of a bad conscience, he looked around and&#xD;
&#xD;
listened attentively to be certain that his action&#xD;
had not been perceived; when, hark! a noise&#xD;
as if of a rustling dress in the arbor. He held his&#xD;
breath and heard it again close to him, and yet&#xD;
the darkness concealed the moving object from&#xD;
his view. Cold perspiration stood upon his&#xD;
forehead, not from bodily fear, for Martin&#xD;
Bates would long ago have welcomed'danger&#xD;
of life; but now he feared lest he had been&#xD;
seen to take the papers from the ground.&#xD;
Again he hears the rustling of the dress&#xD;
against the foliage of the arbor, close to him,&#xD;
and the crunching of the gravel on the walk&#xD;
under a light, hasty footstep. Suddenly he be.&#xD;
held a dark object flitting by, and with a bound&#xD;
he gained the entrance of the arbor and barred&#xD;
the way out.&#xD;
With a suppressed scream, a woman dressed&#xD;
in black recoiled from his very arms. There&#xD;
was light enough, now that they met face to&#xD;
face out of the shadows of the dark arbor, for&#xD;
them to recognize each other.&#xD;
Martin Bates I" she exclaimed, in surprise.&#xD;
" Simonetta MariniI" cried Martin, wonder-&#xD;
ingly.&#xD;
" Perhaps the good God has made- that we&#xD;
meet," continued the Italian girl in quick pas-&#xD;
sionate accents. "1I am not your enemy, Sig-&#xD;
nor Bates, I ani your friend if I may be it.'&#xD;
" Friend I" cried Martin Bates, bitterly.&#xD;
"Praise the virgin who has saved you front&#xD;
the misery of calling me your wife," answered&#xD;
Simonetta, in her hurried, vehement manner.&#xD;
"Your gray hair should have bleached with&#xD;
thoughts of wisdom and not the passions&#xD;
of youth, for the two go not together."&#xD;
" Ilike to hear you speak again, Simonetta,"&#xD;
cried Martin, " your half Italian-English used&#xD;
always to soothe my misery."&#xD;
The girl seemed newly agitated by Martin's&#xD;
speech. After a moment's hesitation, she ap-&#xD;
proached him, and laying her hand upon his&#xD;
arm, said in a whisper,--&#xD;
" Will the best friend of my life make me&#xD;
a promise?"&#xD;
"What is it, Simonetta ?"&#xD;
"Never tell that I speak English."&#xD;
"Why? all your friends know it !"&#xD;
" All that are my friends in New York, yes.&#xD;
But one man, he that can look into woman's&#xD;
soul and hear the talking of her heart, he has&#xD;
been blind and deaf with me. le thinks I do&#xD;
not understand a word of English, and he has&#xD;
spoken words in my presence that are burned&#xD;
into the flesh of my heart, to stay there till I&#xD;
die 1"&#xD;
Martin began to understand. With a ques-&#xD;
tioning gesture he pointed to the gate, and by&#xD;
her assenting nod kney that she referred to&#xD;
Stilletto.           I&#xD;
"And what has he to do with you," he&#xD;
asked, eagerly. " Has he-?"&#xD;
" Yes," she answered fiercely, comprehend-&#xD;
ing his hesitancy. " Yes, he has, and he must&#xD;
die for itI"&#xD;
Martin felt a deathly sickness coming over&#xD;
him. He had loved this woman truly-and&#xD;
now-and now! And that brute Stilletto,&#xD;
too!&#xD;
"You have been to me a kind and generous&#xD;
friend always," continued Simonetta. "To&#xD;
&#xD;
your kind sight my innocence of thought was&#xD;
seen though my dress was rags, and you be-&#xD;
lieved in me. Never did you approach me&#xD;
with baseness of man ; but it had to come as a&#xD;
snake in the night. And when I pray to the&#xD;
Holy Virgin now, I only ask her for ven-&#xD;
gence."&#xD;
' Hold I Simonetta." cried Martin, appalled;&#xD;
"by your religion, which is mightier than ours,&#xD;
I warn you from further sin."&#xD;
Sle has beaten me," gasped the girl, in&#xD;
answer, Martin shuddered.&#xD;
" Beaten me cruelly," repeated the furious&#xD;
woman; "but that is not all. Blows do not&#xD;
sting like jealousy. Will you promise not to&#xD;
tell that him I speak English ?"&#xD;
"Yes, yes I" muttered Martin. "But what&#xD;
are the secrets you have learned through his&#xD;
imprudence."&#xD;
" When God's time comes you shall hear all.&#xD;
There are steps coming this way.  They are&#xD;
returning. Away with you. . I must return&#xD;
to him I"&#xD;
" When will I see you again ?" whispered&#xD;
Martin; for by the closing of the gate, some&#xD;
one was approaching.&#xD;
"When I want you I will find you. You&#xD;
forgive me?"&#xD;
In heaven, poor girl, I will, on earth it is&#xD;
impossible," answered  Martin  Bates, tear-&#xD;
f"lly.&#xD;
"We are friends in this one cause&#xD;
"I do not know what it is," answered Mar-&#xD;
tin, bewildered, " but I suppose I shall find&#xD;
out." And he thought of the papers he had&#xD;
picked up.&#xD;
Simonetta  glided away  as  though   she&#xD;
had melted into the surrounding darkness,&#xD;
and he now saw his brother approaching with&#xD;
an unsteady, wavering step. When Judge&#xD;
Bates perceived Martin still waiting, he mas-&#xD;
tered himself and walked firmly as ever.&#xD;
"I have been keeping you long, brother?"&#xD;
"I have beguiled myself with my fancies,"&#xD;
answered Martin, as they sauntered toward&#xD;
the house together.&#xD;
"You ask me no questions about that man,&#xD;
who came so boldly into my premises, and&#xD;
whom I followed so readily, " said Eben, cast-&#xD;
ing a sharp, suspicious glance upon his bro-&#xD;
ther.&#xD;
"I believe," said Martin. solemnly, "that&#xD;
your business with that men belongs to you&#xD;
two, and God, only."&#xD;
Eben was silent.&#xD;
" And why should men pry into secrets&#xD;
that do not concern them. It may be, that&#xD;
should I lift this veil of mystery, thle disclosure&#xD;
would blind my moral sight for ever!"&#xD;
Still Eben  remained  silent; but Martin&#xD;
heard him breathing heavily, as one that en-&#xD;
deavors to master his emotions, and when&#xD;
they reached the house, Eben said in a hoarse&#xD;
voice --&#xD;
" Go in and talk to Bessie, make her happy,&#xD;
for my mind is heavy with care this evening.&#xD;
I will be in directly.",     .&#xD;
Martin paused. A vague fear crept through&#xD;
his nerves.&#xD;
"lEben !" lie cried, tears rolling down his&#xD;
withered cheeks, " Eben!I" taking his brother's&#xD;
&#xD;
hand, " God keep'you from any thing wicked!&#xD;
Come in now, I am afraid to leave you alone."&#xD;
" Fear not," answered the Judge, quietly.&#xD;
"Do you think that I would heap disgrace&#xD;
upon my name and family by committing sui-&#xD;
cide ?"&#xD;
Martin, reassured by the import of the&#xD;
speech rather that the droll, almost jocular,&#xD;
tone in which it was spoken, obeyed his bro-&#xD;
ther's request without another word.&#xD;
" Ie will not heap disgrace upon his name,"&#xD;
he muttered, as lie entered the house. "lHe&#xD;
will live-live a life of hypocrisy ! As long as&#xD;
the world can not look on his real face, dis-&#xD;
torted by the anguish of guilt, as long as it&#xD;
only beholds his outward face, where virtue and&#xD;
digity sit enthroned, so long lie will bear tip,&#xD;
so long he will be as happy as God will allow&#xD;
him to be. I will leave him to recover the&#xD;
mask which is intended to be gazed upon !"&#xD;
Martin soon retired to his room. He locked&#xD;
the door and closed the window blinds. By&#xD;
the light of a solitary candle he produced his&#xD;
half-stolen treasure, those papers he had found&#xD;
on the walk im the arbor. If one could only&#xD;
have seen him  His cheeks were even more&#xD;
sunken, his hair scantier, and his complexion&#xD;
more ashy pal3 than when we first met him&#xD;
confronting the small but ominous statuette&#xD;
of Justice, at his desk in the office of Messrs.&#xD;
Going &amp;amp; Son.   The light of his gray eyes&#xD;
was unsteady, but now as he read the first&#xD;
words of the captured documents, he seem-&#xD;
ed to shrink into himself -with a feeling&#xD;
of awe that made him shudder in that dis-&#xD;
mal room where he sat alone with an overbur-&#xD;
dened conscience, and only the dim and flick-&#xD;
ering rays of a candle to illumine the title&#xD;
page.&#xD;
TIIE MANIAC's STORY.&#xD;
. So Martin  rates read the story which foams&#xD;
the opening chapter of this book, and as he&#xD;
went on, his interest rose to intense fascination,&#xD;
as if there was a mystic link which connected&#xD;
him with the strange confessions of the lunatic&#xD;
Count of Unkstein. The spirits of the Black&#xD;
Forest seemed to till the air of Martin Bates's&#xD;
lone room ; the gradually increasing mania of&#xD;
the count, atlecting his eyes and ears, until ho&#xD;
actually beheld a material wolf's head in the&#xD;
countenance of his once beautiful wife; the&#xD;
precision with which the apparition of the&#xD;
black wolf and the spectral reproduction of&#xD;
that awful tragedy in the woods were depicted;&#xD;
the terrible earnestness of the whole account,&#xD;
and the evident wish of the imaniac to prove&#xD;
that lie was perfectly sane, and telling the un-&#xD;
varnished truth, all these elements combined&#xD;
to make the crazy story assume a superhuman&#xD;
aspect and similate the truth. Martin's few&#xD;
locks of thin hair uprose in horror, large drops&#xD;
of perspiration hung upon his wrinkled brow,&#xD;
though he was chilled to the very marrow with&#xD;
overpowering, causeless fear, and he would&#xD;
have given much had he never seen the man-&#xD;
uscript.  Even the dead paper, after he had&#xD;
finished reading and had folded it again,&#xD;
seemed inspired with an awful individuality,&#xD;
as though especially sent from the kingdom of&#xD;
spectues to appall human kind.&#xD;

peared, to give a clue ; no testimony save the&#xD;
bare fact of its existence, told of its produc-&#xD;
tion; yet there it was, a living, speaking thing,&#xD;
when once opened.&#xD;
It took some time for Martin's nervous agi-&#xD;
tation to subside sufficiently for him to answer&#xD;
the question that kept recurring to his mind,&#xD;
" What has all this to do with Stilletto?"&#xD;
For a few moments he was strongly inclined&#xD;
to think that it had nothing to do with him or&#xD;
any other human being, but had fallen into his&#xD;
hands through'the agency of some evil spirit.&#xD;
But what is this on the floor?  What ! more&#xD;
papers thrown into Martin's path by-Heaven&#xD;
knows who? Ile picks it up. It has evidently&#xD;
dropped out of the manuscript he has been&#xD;
reading, between the leaves of which it has&#xD;
been carelessly left. It is a letter, unsealed,&#xD;
and addressed to Judge Bates. Martin read as&#xD;
follows:-&#xD;
"1Copy of letter wen to Eben Bates.&#xD;
"I inelose you herewith a copy of the MS.&#xD;
which will show you that I am in full posses-&#xD;
sion of the facts regarding the earlier history&#xD;
of your lovely Countess of Unkstein, which&#xD;
lady has the honor of being my mother. Other&#xD;
papers (such as letters from you to her, dated&#xD;
thirty years ago), and her own written confes-&#xD;
sions, must establish the fact pretty thorough-&#xD;
ly that I am your beloved son ; but, also, that&#xD;
when you did me the kindness to father&#xD;
me, you and my worthy mother most unac-&#xD;
countably omitted the marriage ceremony.&#xD;
" Now I think that a father is expected in&#xD;
this world to support his children, and I am&#xD;
happy to inform you that I am very extrava-&#xD;
gant, so as to al'ord you plenty of opportunity&#xD;
to practice that heaven-born virtue called gen-&#xD;
erosity.&#xD;
" Understand me thoroughly. I am a gen-&#xD;
tleman, but in reduced circumstances, and you&#xD;
know what m n will do when they are reduced.&#xD;
If you do not pay me ten thousand dollars&#xD;
within six days from this, I shall proclaim to&#xD;
the world that you. the high-toned, pious judge.&#xD;
have an illegitimate son living in, New York,&#xD;
and I can not imagine that a gentleman of&#xD;
your wealth should think that a large sum to&#xD;
give to your own son.&#xD;
" I expect an answer to-morrow, and re-&#xD;
main,&#xD;
"iYour obedient son and servant,&#xD;
" ANTONIO STILLETO.&#xD;
(" Which name I adopted because you had&#xD;
not the kindness to leave me reasons to prefer&#xD;
any particular name 1")&#xD;
" Now I see it all I" exclaimed Martin Bates.&#xD;
" This letter is dated three years ago to-day.&#xD;
This whelp is-must be-really Eben's son.&#xD;
And now-now," continued the old man, pacing&#xD;
the room and rubbing his forehead, "I remem-&#xD;
ber a rumor that Eben had an intrigue&#xD;
with a German or Italian countess on the Con-&#xD;
tinent. This must have been about thirty&#xD;
years ago, and this woman doubtless was the&#xD;
&#xD;
unfortunate but villainous wife of this poor&#xD;
German nobleman."&#xD;
" There is not a doubt left," continued Mar-&#xD;
tin, in soliloquy, "or why has Stilletto such&#xD;
an influence over Eben?    And I -can see&#xD;
plainly that this terrible living punishment for&#xD;
an old sin, is the cause of Eben's pecuniary&#xD;
embarrassments. From what I know of that&#xD;
brute, he is capable of tormenting any one&#xD;
to the very confines of the grave for money.&#xD;
And this ten thousand dollars demanded so&#xD;
boldly three years ago, was doubtless but the&#xD;
preliminary to greater requisitions.&#xD;
" Three years 1" he mused. "has not Stil-&#xD;
letto been to Europe since then ? Yes; but&#xD;
he is just the man to make a pleasure-trip at&#xD;
the expense of my poor brother ! Poor Eben,"&#xD;
cried Martin, beating his forehead with his&#xD;
hand, "how the grace of your body has defiled&#xD;
the grace of your soul! Who would recog-&#xD;
nize in the noble judge, the former rake,&#xD;
the  liar, the  hypocrite,  the  remorseless&#xD;
egotist, that I know  lie was!  I say poor&#xD;
Eben -I that have suffered more than any&#xD;
other human being by his deceit and sel-&#xD;
fishness-I that have lost all for him-hon-.&#xD;
or, virtue, peace of ind, forever more! Yet&#xD;
notwithstanding all this, I love him still, and&#xD;
vould die for him ."&#xD;
"     .ow strange," he continued, after he had&#xD;
calmed himself somewhat, ' how strange that&#xD;
Stilletto lost these papers, copies of those&#xD;
sent my brother three years ago. Thus does&#xD;
Providence spoil the nets of villainy by lettig&#xD;
one thread break-and, lo! the whole is de-&#xD;
stroyed. This planning, cunning, cruel devil,&#xD;
this fiend, Stilletto, is, by the direction of a&#xD;
merciful God, born with one great failing-&#xD;
carelessness, want of order. The consequence&#xD;
of a small, thoughtless act, such as carrying&#xD;
these papers in the same pocket with his pocket.&#xD;
handkerchief, the dropping them  at my feet,&#xD;
spoils all his calculations.&#xD;
.But how does it spoil them?  How can I&#xD;
help Eben in this dilemma?" he asked hirn-&#xD;
self in sudden perplexity. And though lie&#xD;
could not immediately answer these queries,&#xD;
he laid awake for the balance of the night&#xD;
thinking about it.&#xD;
CHAPTER V.&#xD;
HAND-IN-HAND.&#xD;
"This cunning cardinal,&#xD;
The articles o' the combination drew&#xD;
As himself pleased.'-KIsNo ENRY VII.&#xD;
HAPPY the man who owns the ground upon&#xD;
which-his house is built, and the house itself,&#xD;
from the foundation to the roof as an unen-&#xD;
cumbered property, for only then may it be&#xD;
called his home in the fullest sense of the&#xD;
word.&#xD;
Mr. Going, as we know,. was the reputed&#xD;
owner of two homes-one in town, and one&#xD;
(the newly-acq~uired Priory) in the country.&#xD;
But were they unencumbered ? No: that first&#xD;
and greatest underminer of a man's personal&#xD;
&#xD;
solvency, a mortgage, rested like a curse upon&#xD;
the Priory, and vitiated the anxious mind of&#xD;
the merchant with every enjoyment of his&#xD;
beautiful country-seat. Besides this, a mort-&#xD;
gage had long since been placed upon the&#xD;
house in Fifth Avenue, so the old gentleman&#xD;
was really in a doubtful and false position.&#xD;
Did he own his houses? Yes: the world&#xD;
thought so; envy proclaimed the fact-malice&#xD;
mentioned the extravagance-and yet, in his&#xD;
communings with himself, he could not say,&#xD;
"This property is mine !"&#xD;
The office of Going &amp;amp; Son seemed to grow&#xD;
more desolate and become more forsaken as&#xD;
relentless Time advanced with steady, meas-&#xD;
ured stride, removinga veil here and there,&#xD;
and developing matters as they approached&#xD;
their consummation. He touched the old busi-&#xD;
ness of the house and it turned to nothing but&#xD;
an empty name, the office no longer presented&#xD;
a scene of well-regulated activity; but rather&#xD;
the unwholesome, mysterious bustle which&#xD;
precedes the consummation of a great under-&#xD;
taking, an enterprise upon which hangs repu-&#xD;
tation or disgrace.&#xD;
The little figure of Justice on the cashier's&#xD;
desk still held out its scales at arm's length,&#xD;
though the dust lay thick upon it in the&#xD;
ghostly luster of the setting sun, as it peered&#xD;
through the windows arid then departed with&#xD;
another day, leaving one day less of the few&#xD;
which would accomplish what was but a ques-&#xD;
tion of time; one day less of weary endeavor&#xD;
and self-mocking hope; one day less of morbid&#xD;
energy and despairing strife to avoid what&#xD;
Mr. Going felt in his inmost soul could not be&#xD;
aroidec.&#xD;
Yes, the house must fall Like a ship whose&#xD;
every timber, to her very keel, is rotten and&#xD;
worm-eaten, the firm must founder and go&#xD;
down in the troubled waves of the financial&#xD;
storm that rose higher and higher, breaking&#xD;
over its fast shattering hulk.&#xD;
Fatman had gone hand in hand with them&#xD;
until'they were fairly launched on the sea of&#xD;
destruction.&#xD;
"Mr. Going," said Mr. Solomons, the Jew,&#xD;
on entering the office one morning, to find&#xD;
father and son in gloomy, indolent reverie,&#xD;
staring on the void that now reigned upon their&#xD;
writing desks, while at the further end of the&#xD;
outer office, a lonely clerk was perched upon&#xD;
a high  stool like a melancholy crow on a&#xD;
withered branch.&#xD;
" Mr. Going, sir," said Mr. Solomons, taking&#xD;
an uuproffered seat, "lHobgoblin is sick. Fat-&#xD;
man got it on the board, youk now. I bid for&#xD;
it every day to keep up prices, but it amounts&#xD;
to nothing but wash sales."&#xD;
"What do you call wash sales ?" asked Mr.&#xD;
Going, rather sharply. " I should very much&#xD;
prefer that you would divest your language of&#xD;
your stock-board slang when you come to talk&#xD;
to ame, and use terms calculated for the com-&#xD;
prehension of a plain merchant."&#xD;
Wash sales," answered   Mr. Solomons,&#xD;
"are sales made for show, you know. In-&#xD;
stance, Hobgobhlin is called at the board. All&#xD;
brokers present; I offer twenty-five; Walter,&#xD;
quuick as lightning, you know, takesit. Folks&#xD;
think stock sold. Papers quote, Hobgobimn&#xD;
&#xD;
twenty-five. After board closes, I go to Wal-&#xD;
ter and say, 'Walter, this is wash,' you know,&#xD;
which means the stock ain't sold. I don't pay&#xD;
twenty-five for it. But in the meanwhile, if an&#xD;
outsider offers twenty-five or twenty in the&#xD;
board, Walter takes that, too, and the outsider&#xD;
has to pay. Do you see ? In other words, we&#xD;
keep up a fictitious market to rope in the&#xD;
greens! Understand ?"&#xD;
"1I understand," said Mr. Going, showing in&#xD;
his tone and .manner the humiliation and dis-&#xD;
gust that he felt; "and I would give a great&#xD;
deal if I need never hear of such transactions&#xD;
in connection with my affairs I"&#xD;
"Pooh, pooh i" said Mr. Solomons, pity-&#xD;
ingly. "But I wanted to tell you that "Hob-&#xD;
goblin is very sick. Dying fast, sir, is Hobgob-&#xD;
lin. Folks beginning to see that two millions&#xD;
is rather a large capital for a company owning&#xD;
nothing but a factory, which stops work pretty&#xD;
often, and a few acres of mining lands. which&#xD;
nobody knows the value of, only folks begin&#xD;
to wonder if the whole concern could have cost&#xD;
more than fifty thousand dollars"&#xD;
" Mr. Solomons," said Mr. Going, with an&#xD;
effort, "I am not very well this morning, in&#xD;
fact my head does not feel strong enough for&#xD;
a business talk."&#xD;
Walter looked up at his father. The old&#xD;
gentleman's face was haggard and mournful in&#xD;
the extreme. His son could there read the&#xD;
pain, the anguish, inflicted by the broker's friv-&#xD;
olous remarks, and with his old brusqueness&#xD;
toward Mr. Solomons, lie said:-&#xD;
"You better go and sell a thousand shares&#xD;
of Erie for us, and hurry up about it, too. We&#xD;
have had enough of your twaddle about our&#xD;
own stock!"&#xD;
" Erie !  Yes, sir. Now there is a stock&#xD;
worth talking about. Erie closed at twenty-live&#xD;
last night, sixty this morning, and Files ,&#xD;
Banker made a million, old Scudder lost about&#xD;
as much, and busted ! I'll buy you Erie at&#xD;
fifty-nine and half-buyer three, or I'll sell you&#xD;
at fifty-nine and half cash !"&#xD;
As soon as llobgoblin yielded the floor to&#xD;
Erie, Mr. Solomons resumed his accustomed&#xD;
flow of language, becoming quite enthusiastic,&#xD;
and this change Mr. Going noticed with a feel-&#xD;
ing of great despondency as a proof that his&#xD;
cherished Hobgoblin had sunk very low in the&#xD;
estimation of such men as the broker, who will&#xD;
praise the most worthless stock as long as&#xD;
there is a shadow of a chance of inducing the&#xD;
ignorant public to deal in it.&#xD;
When Mr. Solomons had left the partners&#xD;
once more alone, Mr. Going said to Wal-&#xD;
ter,-&#xD;
-If the company does not pay us the notes&#xD;
which-mature to-morrow, we will have a hard&#xD;
day, my son. I do not see how we can manage&#xD;
to get along without that money."&#xD;
" They must pay them," cried Walter.&#xD;
"That is the question," answered the old&#xD;
gentleman, sadly. " The notes are given by a&#xD;
limited corporation. Not a trustee, not an in-&#xD;
dividual is responsible for them. And we do&#xD;
not dare to sue the company for payment, lest&#xD;
the whole enterprise tumble about orur ears,&#xD;
and all our stock become valtreless I And still&#xD;
I think we had better make an end of every&#xD;
&#xD;
FELONY.                        8j&#xD;

GOING AND SON.&#xD;
&#xD;
thing. If the company does not pay us, sus-&#xD;
pend payment ourselves; make an assignment&#xD;
and let the trustees answer for their con-&#xD;
duct before the public and the law courts I"&#xD;
" Father," cried Walter, "how can you speak&#xD;
that way. We must not suspend! It would&#xD;
break your heart I"&#xD;
The old gentleman involuntarily looked up&#xD;
toward heaven and laid his hand upon his&#xD;
heart. Was it not broken already? Was not'&#xD;
his calmness that of despair?  Walter did not&#xD;
perceive the agony to which that quick ges-&#xD;
ture bore witness, for lie was pacing the room&#xD;
like an imprisoned wild beast; still protesting&#xD;
against suspension and trying to persuade&#xD;
himself that this step would not be necessary.&#xD;
The clerk brought in a letter. With a fore-&#xD;
boding of evil the old gentleman broke the&#xD;
seal:-&#xD;
"IIoBGOBLIN.&#xD;
"Messrs. Going &amp;amp; Son:-&#xD;
"Dear Sirs,--I regret that it is necessary,&#xD;
in my capacity as Treasurer of the Hobgoblin&#xD;
Mining and Manufacturing Company, to notify&#xD;
you that it will be impossible to meet the notes&#xD;
of the company, which fall due to-morrow, at&#xD;
maturity. After much trouble and the exer-&#xD;
cise of powerful influence we succeeded, as&#xD;
you know, in getting Itobgoblin added to the&#xD;
list of stocks, which are sold at tho board of&#xD;
brokers. I have no doubt that Mr. Solomons,&#xD;
whom we selected as the fittest party to man-&#xD;
age the sale of the stock, has already informed&#xD;
you of the total failure of the enterprise at&#xD;
the board. We can sell no stock, and we hold&#xD;
no funds to pay off the notes you hold. I am&#xD;
sorry to be obliged to further inform you that&#xD;
we begin to see what an exorbitant price we&#xD;
have paid for the llobgoblin. You are much&#xD;
to blame for having attempted to make such&#xD;
an enormous profit out of your manufactur-&#xD;
ing enterprise, and we have more to complain&#xD;
of than you. However, we will still go hand&#xD;
in hand and endeavor to make the best of a&#xD;
bad bargain. Unless you commit the very&#xD;
evident mistake of suing the company (in&#xD;
which case all of us would be heavy losers,&#xD;
for the stock would sink at once to the value&#xD;
of waste paper), I still offer you my aid, and&#xD;
we will fight It out, going hand in hand, as I&#xD;
mentioned before. Yours, truly,&#xD;
"FATMAN."&#xD;
"Hand in hand to the devil," cried Walter,&#xD;
in a rage.&#xD;
"Compose yourself," said his father, trem-&#xD;
bling like a leaf.&#xD;
"Father," said Walter, beside himself, and&#xD;
walking up to Mr. Going with tears in his&#xD;
honest eves and a husky voice, "Father, I&#xD;
swear that Fatman shall suffer for this before&#xD;
he gets through with-us."&#xD;
"In the meanwhile we are ruined," said&#xD;
the old gentleman, with unnatural quietness&#xD;
of voice and manner.&#xD;
"Can we not work through?" asked Walter,&#xD;
composing himself.&#xD;
"Yes; but I feel as though an honorable&#xD;
failure were better than a dishonorable solvcn-&#xD;
ev. I know a man wvhose advice I would like&#xD;
to have just new," This last sentence was&#xD;
&#xD;
not addressed to Walter, but was spoken al.&#xD;
most in a whisper, as though he were comnmu.&#xD;
nicating with his own thoughts. Yet Walter's&#xD;
attentive ears heard the words, and he said,&#xD;
abruptly, as usual:-&#xD;
"I know whom you mean; but Ernest Mon.&#xD;
tant is not worthy your regard. He left you,&#xD;
his benefactor, at a time when he knew that&#xD;
you required the best of help. No clerk, no&#xD;
employee, that has a spark of honor left, de-&#xD;
serts a house in the time of severe trial, such&#xD;
as we have experienced, and, if he should do&#xD;
so, it is often a black mark against him in the&#xD;
business world. We only humiliate ourselves&#xD;
by regretting his loss!"&#xD;
"No, Walter," answered his father, sadly.&#xD;
"le was right. In his mind the events which&#xD;
are now crushing us were clearly foreseen, and&#xD;
his prophecies have come as true as Scripture.&#xD;
He knew that mere seamanship could not save&#xD;
a rotten vessel, and he left our undertaking-&#xD;
not our friendship, for, should a time con e&#xD;
when we need his aid, he will stand by us as&#xD;
of old.  But this accursed stock company&#xD;
must cease to exist before we can again stand&#xD;
clear and unsullied in the eyes of good men or&#xD;
even in the light of our own consciences, so&#xD;
let tus take the bitter pill at once, Walter, let&#xD;
us-ffail."  The last word cost him an effort.&#xD;
It almost choked him.&#xD;
"' This Fatmuan !" cried Walter, rising to his&#xD;
feet again as his anger returned,-&#xD;
" To dare. to write us such a letter. He is&#xD;
indeed perfidious," said the old gentleman,&#xD;
picking up the document to peruse it again.&#xD;
"After telling me again and again," coutin-&#xD;
tnd Walter, "that those notes would certainly&#xD;
be paid, he now, at the eleventh hour--"&#xD;
"The notice is too short," said Mr. Going,&#xD;
dolefully. " I have never heard of such do-&#xD;
ings before. It seems as if his intention was&#xD;
to lure us on into feeling perfectly secure and&#xD;
to strike the blow when it was too late to-&#xD;
ward it off!"&#xD;
"Perhaps he wants us to suspend payment,&#xD;
so as to throw the blame of the Hobgoblin&#xD;
failure upon us.",said Walter.&#xD;
"I can not see the reason for his treach-&#xD;
ery;" said Mr. Going. "It may be the inborn&#xD;
hatred which naturally exists between a black-&#xD;
guard and a gentleman!"&#xD;
It was but rarely that Mr. Going permitted&#xD;
himself to use violent or inelegant expressions;&#xD;
but his just indignation spoke in the last sen-&#xD;
tence, as well as the proud consciousness of&#xD;
his own superiority, which he did not care to&#xD;
disguise.&#xD;
"'We can sell no stock, and we have no&#xD;
roney to pay the notes you hold,"' quoted&#xD;
Walter, between his teeth, as he was re-read-&#xD;
ing Mr. Fatman's letter.&#xD;
" It is perfectly outrageous," said Mr. Going.&#xD;
" As if they had not received merchandise&#xD;
for those notes I And then to dare to-tell us&#xD;
that they have paid too much for the proper-&#xD;
" Nothing but those shares, which seem val-&#xD;
ueless, or very nearly so."&#xD;
'"Wasn't it they that insisted upon issuing&#xD;
two millions of shares, so as to enrich theniu-&#xD;
selves, I should like to know ?" said Walter,&#xD;
&#xD;
bitterly. "Wasn't it against our opinion, ad-&#xD;
vice, and warning, that they, who now accused&#xD;
us, attempted-to realize these immense profits?&#xD;
And now, when they find out that their de-&#xD;
signs upon the public are of no account, they&#xD;
refuse us our money and throw their own vii-I&#xD;
lainies into our faces for an excuse I"1&#xD;
"I have deserved it," muttered Mr. Going.t&#xD;
"I was warned.   Chip, Paradise and others&#xD;
warned me ; -but I could not believe that they&#xD;
were right, and now I must suffer the penalty I"&#xD;
"But, father," said Walter, resuming his&#xD;
seat, "we must not fail. Whatever we do,&#xD;
whatever we may have to sacrifice, let us keep&#xD;
up our good name."&#xD;
And although the old gentleman heard a&#xD;
warning voice, in his heart, which told him&#xD;
that a man who is not solvent has no right to&#xD;
keep his state a secret,--although his experi-&#xD;
ence told him of hundreds of houses that had&#xD;
made honorable bankruptcies, and so preserved&#xD;
the respect of the community, which soon&#xD;
brought there back to better fortunes,-yet&#xD;
the sound of his good name was too precious&#xD;
for him to insist on couplig it with that ugly&#xD;
word, and he yielded to his son.&#xD;
He yielded, and the anxiety of every day&#xD;
through which they had to struggle increased;&#xD;
they  no longer  knew, experientially, the&#xD;
meaning of undisturbed sleep, or peace of&#xD;
mind. And thus the two merchants kept up&#xD;
the tottering firm at all hazards-at all sacri-&#xD;
fices; through weeks of disheartening toil,&#xD;
through  months  of thankless endurance,&#xD;
through periods when all seemed lost, and&#xD;
only miracle could save them, only to remain&#xD;
in the midst of a never-ending battle with&#xD;
fresh uncertainties and agonizimg doubts, to&#xD;
enter upon new labors without end; and all&#xD;
this to keep alive a phantom, a creature of the&#xD;
mind, a reputation undeserved, an honor based&#xD;
upon deceit. And, at the same time, they&#xD;
knew that they were only postponing the&#xD;
catastrophe. All these horrors, agonies, and&#xD;
labors, for no other purpose than postponement.&#xD;
And during this season of trial what of the&#xD;
gay life which had filled ie halls, and en-&#xD;
livened the grounds of the  ately old Priory?&#xD;
What had become of the grand magnificence&#xD;
of the house in Fifth Avenue, and what was&#xD;
the condition of our dear friend, Miss Jessie&#xD;
Going? Did she know what was passing in&#xD;
her father's office?  Did she know the trials&#xD;
of his mind? Let us see what the envied&#xD;
belle of New York thinks in her youthful heart,&#xD;
though she betrays no sign in her gay exterior.&#xD;
After the day's toil, the throng of working&#xD;
men amd women moves away from that part&#xD;
of the city where their daily bread is earned,-&#xD;
their daily bread, and perhaps not a penny to&#xD;
spare for years,-away toward their homes,&#xD;
to sleep until the morning light shall bring the&#xD;
unwelcome summons to another day of labor.&#xD;
But few of these elect to choose the more&#xD;
fashionable thoroughfares for their daily walks,&#xD;
the majority preferring those streets more&#xD;
suited to their station; streets which connect&#xD;
their homes with their workshops, in one un-&#xD;
relieved line of mediocrity. But the few who&#xD;
do venture on a timid walk past the domains&#xD;
of weadlth, stare at the palace-hameas of that&#xD;
&#xD;
class of humanity which, by its superiority to&#xD;
their own fondest dreams or aspirations, seems&#xD;
so far beyond them as almost to partake of the&#xD;
divine.&#xD;
Doubtless, then, there had been many&#xD;
hungry and covetous looks cast upon that&#xD;
mansion in Fifth Avenue, where Miss Jessie&#xD;
Going, on this bright Indian-summer afternoon,&#xD;
is watching the passers-by, from the window&#xD;
of her room.&#xD;
" Who lives in this splendid house ?"&#xD;
" Mr. Going, the great merchant."&#xD;
"Immensely rich, I suppose ?"&#xD;
" Immensely rich-yes (with a sigh).&#xD;
"has he a daughter ?"&#xD;
" Yes, one (what an neiress !); and they say&#xD;
that she is more beautiful and accomplished&#xD;
than any other young lady in New York. She&#xD;
is the reigning belle."&#xD;
The speakers might have been poor work-&#xD;
ing girls.&#xD;
Two gentlemen, of unpretentious appear-&#xD;
ance, are walking home on the other side of&#xD;
the street. No one imagines that they pur-&#xD;
posely avoid passing that envied house; yet it&#xD;
is so. Mr. Chip and Mr. Fatmnan, the two&#xD;
millionaires, no longer wish to approach the&#xD;
house of their former fiend. Miss Jessie, at&#xD;
her window, recognizes themi at a glance, and&#xD;
with womanly pride, retreats for a moment&#xD;
from view, that she may not appear to seek&#xD;
recognition, since it is evident they no longer&#xD;
seek it. She lowers the blind, and when thus&#xD;
in the solitude of her room, her face and man-&#xD;
ner are relieved of all constraimt. On the side&#xD;
of her bed-that virgin sanctum whither she&#xD;
has often retired when her heart beat high&#xD;
with an exultation too strong to be exposed to&#xD;
the scrutiny of society; where the brightest&#xD;
and fondest dreams-sleepimg and waking-&#xD;
have beguiled ler; where her tears have&#xD;
fallen, gently, joyously, or bitterly, according&#xD;
to their cause-there she sits, with her hands&#xD;
in her lap, and her hair dishieveled, misery in&#xD;
her face and a void im her heart, while her&#xD;
young and inexperienced brain is in a whirl&#xD;
with a thousand agomies.&#xD;
Ah, now she realizes the truth! The world&#xD;
has turned against her father. His friends&#xD;
have fled with his wealth, and now enemies&#xD;
lurk in every corner. The truth is not yet&#xD;
known by all. Ie decaying skeleton of what&#xD;
was once the great house, the great family, is&#xD;
closed yet from general scrutiny; but a few&#xD;
have lifted a corner of the covering, and&#xD;
peeped under, and those few show in their&#xD;
faces what they have sen. Appearances are&#xD;
still kept up, fostering ucrvy, but ,better envy&#xD;
than that treacherous, smooth-tongued, villain-&#xD;
ous thing, called sympathy. how can any one&#xD;
sympathize with her? Who but she knows&#xD;
that each hair of her father's venerable white&#xD;
head is an inestimable treasure, to be saeredly&#xD;

is harder to bear up against than would be the&#xD;

"If it were only over !" cries the young&#xD;
girl. "How these articles of luxury by which&#xD;
I am surrounded mock me. I feel as if. the&#xD;
fiends animated the finery of this house; as if&#xD;
the bronzes and pictures sneered at us; as if'&#xD;

mockery, selected by fate to sentinel our mis-&#xD;

unmitigated misery, is all that life has now in&#xD;

But youthful vitality revolts against despair,&#xD;
such as was enveloping her meditations, and&#xD;
with the intention of changing her train of&#xD;
thought she approached the window once&#xD;
more, gazing out upon the little piece of dark&#xD;
gold blue sky over the house-tops yonder.&#xD;
That sky reminded her of many an hour of&#xD;
happy exhilaration. She thought of the fields&#xD;
and woodlands glowing in the bright colors of&#xD;
autumn; where the wind blew fresh and the&#xD;
air was luxurious; and the memory of many&#xD;
a face and many a happiness lost forever now&#xD;
(so she thought, poor child), crowded upon her.&#xD;
Many a face ! Was it not rate rone thee?&#xD;
She pressed her hands to her heart,-to her&#xD;
heart which enshrined but one image, and yet&#xD;
was desolate, because the image was only a&#xD;

her, to be only too soon removed. Her imagina-&#xD;
tion places before her the form of the man she&#xD;
loves. All her sense of admiration for the&#xD;
beautiful and the graceful do homage before&#xD;
it; all her thoughts of what is good and noble&#xD;
crowd around it; and, from the depths of her&#xD;

places upon its head a crown of glory ; and&#xD;
thus it stands before her mind,-and her mind&#xD;
tells her that he belongs to another.&#xD;

beautiful head in the pillows. Let us draw a&#xD;
veil over her weak moments, when utter des-&#xD;

mood, she raises her eyes for the comfort,&#xD;
which, since earth is dead, heaven must accord&#xD;

On her knees, praying for her cherished&#xD;
father, imploring the divine grace by all that&#xD;
is good and sweet on earth and holy in heaven,&#xD;

CHAPTER VI.&#xD;
GOING, GOING, GONE.&#xD;
" How goes the world, that I am thus encountered&#xD;
With clamorous debt-"&#xD;
TIMON OF ATIHENs.&#xD;
THE Priory is sold ; Mr. Christian Fatman has&#xD;
bought it, and Mr. Going has submitted to the&#xD;
publicity of his comparative poverty only after&#xD;
many an ineffectual struggle. What neces.&#xD;
sarily had to come, sooner- or later, occurred&#xD;
in the following manner :-&#xD;
On a December day, marked by the first&#xD;
snow of the season, Mr. Going and Walter&#xD;
were occupying the dreary quiet of their office,&#xD;
in moody silence, when the door opened. A&#xD;
fur coat, loaded with snowflakes, entered, and,&#xD;
after unbuttoning itself and opening its wings,&#xD;
graciously permitted the exquisite Mr. Solo-&#xD;
mons to step forth into the outer world.&#xD;
" This is a rare favor nowadays," said Mr.-&#xD;
Going, greeting him. "I am much afraid that&#xD;
Mr. Solomons, like the rest of the world, does&#xD;
not fancy paying visits to this office, since it&#xD;
is known that we have suffered severe losses&#xD;
and are retrenching in all directions."&#xD;
"Mr. Going," answered the Jew, "that is&#xD;
not deserved, sir; and to show you that it is&#xD;
not deserved, and that I don't mean to deserve&#xD;
it, I have come to propose a great business to&#xD;
you." With these words he produced a card&#xD;
and handed it to the old gentleman.&#xD;
" How is this ?" asked Walter, moderately&#xD;
astonished, "'NATHAN SoLoMONs, Auc'rioN-&#xD;
EER'? So you have left the stock business,&#xD;
hey ?"&#xD;
"I have. No money in it. If you lose, you&#xD;
pay ; if you make, nobody pays you. Money is&#xD;
tight when you're hard up, and when youhave&#xD;
any, you can1' get  ee  pershent. Losing,&#xD;
business, sir; all credit and no cash."&#xD;
"Well, sir," said Mr. Going, with a smile,&#xD;
after they had seated themselves, and an awk-&#xD;
ward pause ensued since the last sentence of&#xD;
Mr. Solomons' valuable wisdom. "As it is&#xD;
easy to perceive that you have business to&#xD;
propose, speak it out."&#xD;
"Our mutual friend, Mr. Fatman-"&#xD;
Here Walter muttered an oath which start-&#xD;
led the late stock-broker so considerably, that&#xD;
Mr. Going had some trouble to persuade him&#xD;
to continue his remarks.&#xD;
" Well, sir, Mr. Fatman sent me here," ejacu-&#xD;
lated Mr. Solomons, coloring violently.&#xD;
"For what purpose?" said Mr. Going,&#xD;
coldly.&#xD;
"To see whether you would not-"&#xD;
"Speak, man !" cried Walter, impatiently, as&#xD;
the broker stopped once more in utter comn-&#xD;
fusion.&#xD;
"Would, not.-" Here he actually stam.&#xD;
mered.&#xD;
" Another pull, my man, and you'll fetch&#xD;
it I" cried Walter, laughing at the sight of tlite&#xD;
Jew's helpless confusion. He was shifting&#xD;
about on his chair as if it was uncomfortably&#xD;
hot for him, and his face expressed mingled&#xD;
reluctance and fear.- Finally ihe seemneri o)&#xD;

GOING AND SON.&#xD;
&#xD;
the city had been induced to attend the sale&#xD;
by Mr. Solomon's glowing advertisements in&#xD;
the daily newspapers. Dame Rumor had also&#xD;
gratuitously advertised the sale, telling far and&#xD;
near that Going &amp;amp; Son-the great firm-had&#xD;
been compelled to sell their celebrated coun-&#xD;
try-place, and that, on such a day, the furni-&#xD;
ture, which was quite princely for a citizen of&#xD;
a republic, would be sold to the highest bidder&#xD;
at public auction.&#xD;
Miss Jessie had insisted upon attending at&#xD;
the sale; but when she and Walter were treat-&#xD;
ed like strangers by the horde of vandals which-&#xD;
had invaded their home,-when they had to&#xD;
pick their way through the confused heaps of&#xD;
furniture, now piled up into "lots," and she&#xD;
recognized many a cherished object, and many&#xD;
a household god now dethroned and strewn&#xD;
about like the corpses on a battle-field,-when&#xD;
she heard Mr. Solomon's voice shrieking and&#xD;
yelling, and rattling away, as if he were pos.&#xD;
sessed by a demon, as lie rapidly sold off to&#xD;
the highest bidder many a thing become price-&#xD;
less to her from associations.-when the un-&#xD;
ceasing " Going, going, goneI" smote her ear&#xD;
vith increasing pain, and Walter made a grim&#xD;
joke on the analogy of their own good name,&#xD;
to the irrepressible refrain of the auctioneer,--&#xD;
when she finally realized that here a home was&#xD;
being desolated and demolished, cruelly strip-&#xD;
ped of the cherished though inanimate com-&#xD;
panions of many a happy hour long past,-&#xD;
when these reflections pressed themselves up-&#xD;
on her consideration her spirit broke down,&#xD;
she felt that she was being driven away from&#xD;
a happy home by that yelling clown of a Jew,&#xD;
and she hurried her brother away from time&#xD;
scene. Like a fugitive, she sought a retreat&#xD;
in that house where she had once enjoyed all&#xD;
that comfort and luxury can command, and&#xD;
there she found none. From the inquisitive&#xD;
gaze of strangers she again fled away, and&#xD;
this time found shelter in the same summer-&#xD;
house where Ernest Montant had first con-&#xD;
versed with Josephine Van Strom, long ago.&#xD;
As Walter's presence was needed elsewhere,&#xD;
he left her there in the still powerful beams&#xD;
of the winter's sun, and there, protected by&#xD;
thick shawls, she found an hour of solitude&#xD;
and contemplation. .&#xD;
She was disturbed by some one's approach,&#xD;
and a respectful voice said&#xD;
" I have been searching high and low for&#xD;
you, Mks Going. I have something to say to&#xD;
vou, and, if you will allow me, I will say it&#xD;
here."&#xD;
Miss Jessie lifted her eyes and beheld before&#xD;
her the elegantly attired form of Mr. Wheeler.&#xD;
We must remember that he and Mr. Faro were&#xD;
two gentlemen distinguished for their wealth,&#xD;
fashionably good standing in New York soci-&#xD;
ety, and intimacy at Mr. Going's house. Both&#xD;
of them had often excited our hero's deep con-&#xD;
tempt and animosity by their inanity and&#xD;
claims upon Miss Going's preference, claims&#xD;
which were honored with a sincerity of which&#xD;
we are well able to judge..&#xD;
Mr. Wheeler then lifted his hat and for one&#xD;
gracious moment exhibited to her delighted&#xD;
gaze his exquisitely-dressed hair, parted ex-&#xD;
actly in the center and nearly touching his&#xD;
&#xD;
eyebrows, since his noble forehead had been&#xD;
molded very low by "dissembling nature."&#xD;
At all events, there he stood. his mustache.&#xD;
crowned lips parted, and his eyes dilated, while&#xD;
his delicate right hand entertained its white&#xD;
fingers by allowing them an unrestrained free-&#xD;
dom in pulling and twisting his whisker.&#xD;
" Miss Going," he said, still at a respectful&#xD;
distance, "Faro told me-"&#xD;
" Well, what did Mr. Faro tell you ?" asked&#xD;
Miss Jessie, the slight tears with which her&#xD;
gloomy reflections had moistened her black&#xD;
eyes, giving place to a coquettish glance.&#xD;
" He advised me-in fact-"&#xD;
"Did he advise you to stop short in the&#xD;
middle of every sentence, Mr. Wheeler?"&#xD;
asked the young lady, laughing.&#xD;
"No-no. But he thought that since my&#xD;
uncle died-" explained the gentleman.&#xD;
" What a dismal subject I" cried Miss Jessie.&#xD;
" Well, now, it isn't dismal, at all," said Mr.&#xD;
Wheeler, with a grin.&#xD;
" Why, Mr. Wheeler 1" cried Miss Jessie, in&#xD;
amused wonder. "XWho would have thought&#xD;
you so heartless as to make merry at your&#xD;
uncle's death"&#xD;
"No, but it isn't that."&#xD;
" Well, then, what is it ?"&#xD;
"He left me a great deal of money, Miss&#xD;
Going-and-in fact-Faro thought-"&#xD;
"Mr. Wheeler 1" said the young lady, some.&#xD;
what alarmed by his continued grins and the&#xD;
incoherence of his language, "I sincerely hope&#xD;
that your newly-acquired wealth has neither&#xD;
turned your brain nor made you a victim of&#xD;
that disgusting habit-drinking, you know."&#xD;
Having said this with due emphasis, a pause&#xD;
ensued, during which the young man rolled&#xD;
his eyes around desperately, as if in search of&#xD;
some relief; but none was forthcoming, the&#xD;
silence was becoming unbearable, and lie&#xD;
finally found courage to reply, looking at any&#xD;
thing rather than the person addressed:-&#xD;
"It isn't that at all, Miss Going, but you see&#xD;
the Priory is sold."&#xD;
Miss Jessie nodded, an intimation that she&#xD;
had heard something of the kind before.&#xD;
" And--you see-Faro thought you were&#xD;
poorI"&#xD;
It is impossible to describe the grimace&#xD;
which accompanied this happy delivery of his&#xD;
inmost thoughts. His listener, however, was&#xD;
very much startled by the remark, and the&#xD;
suspicion of what was most likely to follow&#xD;
only increased her amazement.&#xD;
" Mr. Faro is perfectly correct. I am poor."&#xD;
" And, therefore," continued Mr. Wheeler,&#xD;
apparently addressing the ornament on the&#xD;
roof of the summer-house, "and, therefore,&#xD;
Faro thought-that---that since I was rich and&#xD;
-you were poor-" The perspiration stood&#xD;
in beads on his face, he trembled violently,&#xD;
and, with a convulsive effort (now that he&#xD;
could not retreat), he gasped out,-&#xD;
"Faro thought that, since I love you, and&#xD;
you were poor and I rich - in fact, Faro&#xD;
thought that if I asked you to marry me, you&#xD;
would do it." He retreated a step as if horri-&#xD;
fied by his own speech, and stood before her&#xD;
with eyes fastened upon the ground, thme pic-&#xD;
ture of complete confusion, muttering to h~iim-&#xD;
&#xD;
self. "Well, if it's all wrong, I have put it&#xD;
off on Faro, anyhow I"&#xD;
But Jessie Going felt no inclination to laugh&#xD;
at him. With a worhan's correct intuition, she&#xD;
recognized and appreciated the kindliness of&#xD;
heart which was prompting this man to offer&#xD;
himself to her, and she was too good and kind&#xD;
and gentle, not to feel very, very sorry for&#xD;
him! In the opinion of every one, Mr. Wheel-&#xD;
er was a fop, and was called a fool by many.&#xD;
What little brains he possessed were seldom&#xD;
exercised except-on petty affairs of amusement&#xD;
or dress, yet it seems that lie had a large heart&#xD;
beneath his immaculate shirt-bosom, and it is&#xD;
an open question whether he was not more&#xD;
prompted by generosity, ia this offer of mar-&#xD;
riage, than by pure selfishness. His simplicity&#xD;
(oh1 how very simple, reputed men of the&#xD;
world are at times) led him into this error,&#xD;
but his noble intention made him worthy of&#xD;
consideration. So thought Miss Jessie Going&#xD;
as she heard the ludicrous utterance of Mr.&#xD;
Wheeler's feelings, and instead of derision she&#xD;
gave him pity. It is hardly necessary to say&#xD;
that she refused him, but the manner in which&#xD;
she (lid it proved her soul as true as steel and&#xD;
her heart to be of pure gold.&#xD;
In spite of the severe disappointment, in the&#xD;
course of a long conversation, she succeeded&#xD;
in soothing him considerably. Before they&#xD;
parted, she had brought him back to common&#xD;
sense, and to his great astonishment he soon&#xD;
found himself in a smiling, good humor, and&#xD;
is happy as if Faro had not played him this&#xD;
trick.&#xD;
On the whole however, the effect upon Miss&#xD;
Jessie was very beneficial, for although she&#xD;
was very sorry for Mr. Wheeler, yet she was&#xD;
gratified at the thought that such friends were&#xD;
to be found among her least-esteemed acquaint-&#xD;
ance, and as she had learned to esteem Mr.&#xD;
Wheeler more than she had thought possible,&#xD;
her views of the false world that had educated&#xD;
her were correspondingly elevated, and she&#xD;
felt new energy and new confidence in herself&#xD;
and her fellow-creatures.&#xD;
Miss Jessie would not relapse Mr. Wheeler,&#xD;
and he accompanied them back to town, while&#xD;
the whole trio were in far better spirits than&#xD;
Walter had expected they would be after say-&#xD;
ing farewell to the Priory.&#xD;
*     i*      *       *     .*&#xD;
" A palatial residence-it is indeed a noble&#xD;
place-a regal place, Mr. Paradise," said Mr.&#xD;
Christian Fatman, to the hunchbacked lawyer,&#xD;
as they sat down to the first dinner in the&#xD;
newly - furnished dining-hall.  Mr. Fatman&#xD;
rubbed  his hands delightedly, and  looked&#xD;
around the table. Mrs. Fatman sat opposite&#xD;
him, and the rest of the company of ladies and&#xD;
gentlemen were all from the city, and had join-&#xD;
ed in a midwinter excursion into the country&#xD;
for the purpose of doing justice to the sleighing,&#xD;
skating, and hospitality which they had been&#xD;
promised by their host.&#xD;
As usual, Mr. Paradise had to make a disa-&#xD;
greeable remark.&#xD;
" Well, Mr. Fatman," he sneered, "if it is a&#xD;
regat place, you certainly did not get posses-&#xD;
sion of it by kingly means I"&#xD;
An awkward silence ensued. Each one&#xD;
&#xD;
looked at Mr. Fatman, and then at Mr. Para-&#xD;
dise, and then at his neighbor, finally, con-&#xD;
centrating his attention on the good things&#xD;
before him. Mr. Fatman looked very uncom-&#xD;
fortable, but did not conclude to take up the&#xD;
gage of battle.&#xD;
When the old port wine was brought out of&#xD;
the closet, the door of which looked crusty and&#xD;
like port wine, as Walter Going had noticed&#xD;
when they first visited old John Jacob Van&#xD;
Strom-when the wine was brought on the&#xD;
table, and had been poured out-Mr. Paradise&#xD;
arose and gave a toast:-&#xD;
"To the late owner of this noble house.&#xD;
May our present host prove us kind and hos-&#xD;
pitable as my old friend Going; and when he&#xD;
fails may he be hoisted out by as sharp practice&#xD;
as was measured out to Going I"&#xD;
But then Mr. Paradise was deformed, and&#xD;
pity gave him license to make disagreeable&#xD;
speeches.  He had long known that Mr. Fat-&#xD;
man had set his heart on obtaining the Priory,&#xD;
and understood perfectly well all the maueuv-&#xD;
ers he had used to satisfy his desires. And&#xD;
now the lawyer grudged the success which&#xD;
had'crowed the rich man's schemes.&#xD;
CHAPTER VII.&#xD;
SO FAR, SO GOOD--nUT, HOW NOW?&#xD;
"Thou wron'st a gentleman who is as far&#xD;
From thy report its thou from honorr'&#xD;
CYunauIsL.&#xD;
WINTER had come with frost and snow,&#xD;
bringing desolation to nature, and ice-cold&#xD;
chills upon all the North. The airy situation&#xD;
of John Van Strom's house gave freedom for&#xD;
the i december gales to play their storm games&#xD;
upon the trembling frame of the building, and&#xD;
although Bella had the means and the taste to&#xD;
make the interior comfortable, the voices of&#xD;
the wild blast without put a damper upon her&#xD;
fireside as well as upon those not so well defend-&#xD;
ed, and the proposition of moving to town for a&#xD;
few months of winter enjoyment was often ad-&#xD;
vanced, and more and more favorably received-&#xD;
John's moods had lately assumed a more mel-&#xD;
ancholy turn, aid as his wife watched him,&#xD;
crouched by the fire and staring vacantly in-&#xD;
to the dancing flames on those dreary winter&#xD;
nights, she felt sad and oppressed.&#xD;
It was generally in the cosy dining-room,&#xD;
and with a great wood tire roaring merrily, that&#xD;
the married couple spent those winter evenings&#xD;
in the quietest manner, and with a tinge of&#xD;
irrepressible melancholy, while the lovers,&#xD;
Josephine and our hero, after diligent search,&#xD;
might have been discovered snugly ensconced&#xD;
in some corner, screened from observation and&#xD;
exiting, during those precious moments, for&#xD;
and in themselves alone.&#xD;
But they did not forget their duties as guests,&#xD;
in return for the hospitality and kindness&#xD;
which they received, and they were always&#xD;
ready for a game of whist, or to engage in anmy&#xD;
oihe-r amusement agreeable to their simple&#xD;
host. They also made it a point to keep up&#xD;

92                   GOING AND SON.&#xD;
&#xD;
John's interest in ordinary matters, by con-&#xD;
versing freely at the table and elsewhere upon&#xD;
topics of general interest--discussing questions&#xD;
of the day and commenting upon the latest&#xD;
news. Thus they were seated together one&#xD;
evening, John, for once in a good humor, with&#xD;
Bella on the sofa near the fire, his arm wound&#xD;
lightly around her substantial waist, and the&#xD;
lovers opposite in a more demonstrative atti-&#xD;
tude of affection. No longer was their engage-&#xD;
ment a secret, and John had given his consent&#xD;
in terms of most extravagant'approbation and&#xD;
delight.&#xD;
"1 have advices from town to-day," said&#xD;
our hero, "and I am sorry to say that I hear&#xD;
bad news of my former employers, Messrs.&#xD;
Going &amp;amp; Son. It seems evident that they are&#xD;
struggling hard to avoid what can not be&#xD;
avoided, instead of making an honorable re-&#xD;
treat from their lost position, acknowledging&#xD;
their defeat, but saving their honor."&#xD;
"Has Walter written to you ?" asked Jose-&#xD;
phine, turning her face toward him, for, we&#xD;
may as well admit it, her lovely head was re-&#xD;
clining on his shoulder, while his arm encircled&#xD;
her figure, not quite so lightly as the arm&#xD;
which embraced Bella.&#xD;
"No, dear," answered Ernest; "some one&#xD;
one has written to me whose confidence is too&#xD;
sacred to be revealed, even to you."&#xD;
Josephine was satisfied, and resumed her&#xD;
former position in entire acquiescence with his&#xD;
better judgment.&#xD;
" Mr. Van Strom," continued our hero, " far&#xD;
be it from me to presume upon meddling with&#xD;
your affairs; but I was sorry that you did not&#xD;
send an agent to bid on the Priory furniture.&#xD;
By the way, why could you not have repur-&#xD;
chased the old place? It was sold for less&#xD;
than it is worth at any moment."&#xD;
"I have no money," answered John, seri-&#xD;
ously. "Do you suppose I ain rolling in&#xD;
wealth ?"&#xD;
"Really, I never investigated the subject,"&#xD;
answered Montant, with a quiet smile.&#xD;
" Honestly, haven't you ?" asked John, ea-&#xD;
gerly, and fixing a sharp look upon his guest.&#xD;
"It would have been contrary to my char.&#xD;
acter and habit of mind had I done so," an-&#xD;
swered Ernest, with some dignity; and as&#xD;
Josephine nestled closer to him as he spoke,&#xD;
he pressed her tighter to his breast.&#xD;
" Mr. Montant," said John Van Strom, after a&#xD;
pause, " I hope and think you speak the truth,&#xD;
and as that is my opinion, I, to-night, invite you&#xD;
to leave those disagreeable lodgings in the&#xD;
village, and come to live altogether with me.&#xD;
If I thought you were hankering after my&#xD;
money, like everybody else in this accursed&#xD;
world of greediness, I would hate you; but as&#xD;
I believe you are honest, I love you. Take my&#xD;
advice and marry that girl there as soon as&#xD;
possible. Marry her, I say. John Van Strom&#xD;
tells you to MARRY HER, sir," he continued,&#xD;
with great energy, "and that same gentleman&#xD;
means what he says I"&#xD;
"I accept your invitation, with gratitude,"&#xD;
answered our hero, looking into Josephine's&#xD;
lace, as it was turned to meet his gaze, all ra-&#xD;
diant with loving entreaty and hope and hap-&#xD;
piness, "and as for marrying this girl here, I&#xD;
&#xD;
mean to do that- very thing in less than two&#xD;
weeks; that is, unless she objects."&#xD;
" Of which there is great probability," in-&#xD;
terposed Bella, laughing.&#xD;
" And now, sir," continued John, with dig.&#xD;
nity, "let us talk business, in spite of the girls'&#xD;
listening. They'll find it all out, any way, yot&#xD;
know."&#xD;
D o you think we would, Josie ?" asked&#xD;
Bella.&#xD;
"If it is to be interesting," answered Jo.&#xD;
sephine, "I don't so' much mind listening; but&#xD;
if it is going to be dry and long-winded and&#xD;
horrid, I would rather be excused."&#xD;
" Well, sir,"  continued  John, without&#xD;
heeding the interruption, "you are, I believe,&#xD;
poor."&#xD;
" Your belief, sir," answered our hero, good-&#xD;
naturedly, although firmly, " is entirely wrong.&#xD;
I am the undisputed possessor of nearly two&#xD;
thousand dollars, and I have brains and arms&#xD;
fully capable of more than supporting a wife.&#xD;
If you call that poor, our ideas on the subject&#xD;
differ. I ask no one's assistance, because, in&#xD;
the first place, I don't need it, and secondly,&#xD;
the idea of assistance is distasteful to nie."&#xD;
" But," cried John, in some excitement,&#xD;
".just because you do not ask it, I am going to&#xD;
offer it to you! how much capital do you&#xD;
want to go into business?"&#xD;
"I thought you had no money!" said our&#xD;
hero, laughing.&#xD;
"Nonsense !   Tell me how    much you&#xD;
wantI"&#xD;
" Upon my word, that is hard to say," an-&#xD;
swered our hero, cautiously.  "Wait till I&#xD;
have a business, and then I will tell you. It&#xD;
may be any imaginable sum that niy future&#xD;
business will warrant me in borrowing, or it&#xD;
may be not one cent."&#xD;
" But I want it to be something,' cried John,&#xD;
angrily. "Do you think a Van Strom can be&#xD;
put off in this contemptuous manner, sir?&#xD;
Do you think it is thingsg to have me, ,John&#xD;
Jacob Van Strom, make you such an offer? I&#xD;
will not be contradicted in this way I"&#xD;
Bella gave our hero an anxious, pleading&#xD;
look, for John was working himself up into&#xD;
one of those fits of passion which she still&#xD;
feared and strove to avoid; so Montant, catch-&#xD;
ing her meaning, said, quickly,-&#xD;
"You misunderstand me, and although I&#xD;
can not mention a sum at present, I promise&#xD;
you that I will call upon you at an early day&#xD;
for what I may require."&#xD;
" And that will be something," persisted&#xD;
John. " Not a few hundreds, nor only a few&#xD;
thousands, mind youI!"&#xD;
" It will be quite enough, I assure you," re-&#xD;
plied our hero.&#xD;
"And you will stay at my house to-night,&#xD;
and remain until you marry that girl ?"&#xD;
"I will, with great pleasure."&#xD;
"And you will marry her this month ?"&#xD;
" Here is the bargain sealed," replied Mon-&#xD;
tant, laughing, and kissing Josephine's lips.&#xD;
John gave vent to an exclamation of enthusi-&#xD;
asm, and running like a child to Josephine,&#xD;
kissed her on both cheeks.&#xD;
" Good-luck to you, sister-in-law !" he cried, ,&#xD;
in the best humor. lHe then rang the bell, and&#xD;
&#xD;
upon the appearance of the same old butler&#xD;
who had been "in the family forty years," he&#xD;
ordered a bottle of champagne. When he had&#xD;
composed himself somewhat, he said, with&#xD;
that singular acuteness in judging himself&#xD;
which often characterizes people of contracted&#xD;
intellect,-&#xD;
"I am astonished at my liberality, to-night,&#xD;
because, even though I am a fool, I am close&#xD;
in money matters and shrewd in business. I&#xD;
am the last man to take out my purse ; but&#xD;
when I once have confidence in a man, he&#xD;
aight rob me of my last dollar, and I would&#xD;
give the last as readily as the first. This comes&#xD;
from my stupidity, I suppose, which allows me&#xD;
only one idea in my head.   But that idea,&#xD;
sir," and he struck his fist on the table, "that&#xD;
idea, sir, must be carried out, sir, at all&#xD;
hazards I"&#xD;
Hlereupon the toast of the new couple was&#xD;
pledged in a merry bumper, and John heaped&#xD;
the most affectionate attentions upon Bella,&#xD;
showing so much sprightliness and loving&#xD;
kindness, that tears of gratitude and happiness&#xD;
stood in her honest eyes,&#xD;
A ring at the door-bell interrupted this&#xD;
friendly and interesting family party, and the&#xD;
unusual event of a visitor to the lonely country-&#xD;
house at this unpropitious hour (for half-past-&#xD;
eight had been announced some time before&#xD;
by the pretty little French clock) could but&#xD;
create a sensation of half-anxious curiosity as&#xD;
to the character of the one asking for admis-&#xD;
si*t-&#xD;
"-Mr. Stilletto, from New YorkI" announced&#xD;
the old butler, who, to his disgust, was com-&#xD;
pelled to answer the hall-door; which duty, he&#xD;
opined, belonged to '"ordinary waiters," but&#xD;
riot to such as he.&#xD;
Not one of our four friends failed to expe-&#xD;
riene a sort of disagreeable sensation at the&#xD;
mere sound of the name. They all knew Stil-&#xD;
letto. Our hero knew himintimately, as we&#xD;
have seen, and the others, since the evening&#xD;
when Mr. Fatman introduced his protegc inito&#xD;
"good society," to the infinite gratification of'&#xD;
the protege.&#xD;
"I must beg pardon for this late call," sail&#xD;
Mr Stilletto, with perft et self-reliance, as he&#xD;
greeted the party. '"Good-evening, Mrs. Van&#xD;
Strom," bowing to Bella. entirely too low to be&#xD;
in good taste. "Mr. Van- Strom, your most&#xD;
obedient, sir,"-" Madam " (to Josephine) "I&#xD;
see you are as beautiful as ever ; and Montant,&#xD;
old fellow," shaking hands with our hero, and&#xD;
affecting a very cordial intimacy with him, " I&#xD;
am glad to see you; but of course (with&#xD;
an ,insolent leer which was intended for shy-&#xD;
ness), that might have been expected." Jo-&#xD;
sephine. for whose benefit this refined speech&#xD;
was made, turned away with an expression of&#xD;
intense annoyance, and all but John treated&#xD;
the intruder with marked coldness, from the&#xD;
very beginning,&#xD;
With an acuteness worthy of better motives,&#xD;
Stilletto saw at once how matters stood here,&#xD;
and if any one could have read his heart, it&#xD;
would have been perceived that the situation&#xD;
was entiretly satisfactory to the wily Italian--&#xD;
for what reasons, remains to be seen., He lead&#xD;
not displeased John, though he might well&#xD;
&#xD;
have feared lest he should.. He was a disa-&#xD;
greeable object to the ladies and to Montant,&#xD;
-this he had foreseen, and he did not care a&#xD;
straw about it. John's excellent humor had&#xD;
opened his simple heart to the ready welcome&#xD;
of any one, and he had not brain enough to&#xD;
detect the innate coarseness of the unexpected&#xD;
guest.&#xD;
But the favorable opening presented to Mr.&#xD;
Stiletto's maneuvers, was not allowed to re-&#xD;
main unimproved for a moment. That he had&#xD;
some object in view was especially apparent&#xD;
to the quick perception and sound judgment&#xD;
of Bella Van Strom, and she had not watchedd&#xD;
his cat-like movements, around the room, his&#xD;
cunning ever-watchful looks, his alertness and&#xD;
sharp speeches, for many moments, before she&#xD;
said to herself': "This man has' an aim in in-&#xD;
flicting his vulgarity on us. le is entering&#xD;
upon a planned series of operations, and&#xD;
I would give much to know what it is all&#xD;
about."&#xD;
Stilletto strained every faculty of his fertile&#xD;
brain to entertain John Van Strom. ie flatter-&#xD;
ed hin and drew him out until John conmmnened&#xD;
to talk loudly about his own alf'irs and make&#xD;
a complete fool of himself. But he had an at-&#xD;
tentive and obsequious listener, and not until&#xD;
he had exhausted his stock of weak, though&#xD;
pardonable conceit, and had come to the end&#xD;
of his conversational powers, udid Stilletto talk&#xD;
more than his fascinated host. Then he comi-&#xD;
inenced to tell anecdotes which aroused John's&#xD;
mirth to the pitch of' boisterousness, until the&#xD;
ladies, annoyed and thoroughly disgusted.&#xD;
rose to retire. John bowed them- out, nuch&#xD;
discontented at their coldness and scant pourt-&#xD;
esy toward Stilletto; but the latter, whemn the&#xD;
three gentlemen were left alone. quickly re-&#xD;
stored him to good humor, by showering&#xD;
praises upon Bella.&#xD;
"Montant, old fellow," cried the Italian, "I&#xD;
see you are at homeo uhre I how hospitable&#xD;
you are, Mr. Van Strom. But then there are&#xD;
reasons-of course, good reasons l"&#xD;
Our hero gave hiun a look which should&#xD;
have cautioned him somewhat, but he went&#xD;
ou:-&#xD;
"You have not re-entered business, have&#xD;
you, Montant, since you were discharged-&#xD;
beg pardon-I mean since you fell out with&#xD;
Mr. Going?"&#xD;
Our hero did not answer a syllable; but&#xD;
with compressed lips kept his eyes fixed upon&#xD;
the fellow with a strange light in them, which&#xD;
should again have warned Stilletto; but either&#xD;
hue welcomrued a possible altercation, or his&#xD;
natural courage made him defiant, for lie went&#xD;
on, in a sneering, imsulting tone,-&#xD;
"Is it not pleasant for broken-down men to&#xD;
find friends to sponge upon? I wish poor&#xD;
Stilletto could find a great- gentleman to feed&#xD;
and lodge him for months at a time, with a&#xD;
beautiful, near relative of that same great and&#xD;
rich gentleman, to marry into the bargain."&#xD;
In an instant Montant was on his feet. For&#xD;
one moment Stilletto seemed doomed to a ter-&#xD;
rible visitation of a just wrath, and the livid&#xD;
paler which suddenly overspread his face, as&#xD;
he made a hasty movement behind thme table,&#xD;
showed that the flashing eyes, the tharious Ire-&#xD;
&#xD;
FELONY.                        93&#xD;

94                    GOING AND SON.&#xD;
&#xD;
mor of Montant's whole frame, had not escaped&#xD;
his notice.  But at the right moment our&#xD;
hero mastered himself, though only after a&#xD;
severe struggle, and saying, between his&#xD;
teeth,-&#xD;
"Thank your stars that this is not my&#xD;
house," strode to the door, and left the room.&#xD;
"His house I" snarled Stilletto, more in-&#xD;
censet by the fright lie had suffered, and by&#xD;
the contemptuous tone, than by tue import of&#xD;
the words he had just heard. "1 dare say he&#xD;
thinks it is almost his already, intriguing pau-&#xD;
per that he is. I do not pretend to offer any&#xD;
advice to you, Mr. Van Strom, but it was very&#xD;
kind in.your guest to say that this was not&#xD;
his house ! A stranger might have supposed&#xD;
from his general manner that lie was master&#xD;
here already l"&#xD;
The manner in which John had borne him-&#xD;
self during the quarrel, showed how well&#xD;
Stilletto had studied the ground before pro-&#xD;
voking the quarrel.  lis most sanguine&#xD;
expectations had been realized. and that, not&#xD;
after weeks of careful strategy, but on his very&#xD;
first visit. He hadt dared to throw the gatnt-&#xD;
let of defiance at Eriest Montant, ane gJohn&#xD;
Van Strom had taken sides with him. What&#xD;
could follow, but that the two ladies would&#xD;
take Motait's part, discord would reign be-&#xD;
theen Motiait and the ladies, against Jotn.&#xD;
Then was it not within le range of proba-&#xD;
bility that John would need an ally, and by&#xD;
proper management, why should there not be&#xD;
a firm alliance between the " great and rch&#xD;
gentleman" and Antonio Stilletto?&#xD;
Yes, Johin's fickle, unstable mind, worked&#xD;
upon by tme etniing remarks of the intruder,&#xD;
had imstantaneously changed against our hero,&#xD;
the man upon whom, but half an hour pro-&#xD;
vutsly, lie had lavished everyyianifestationi&#xD;
of friendship and good will. Stilletto had made a&#xD;
masterly attack.  le had opened the way to&#xD;
John's good will by amusing him, and then,&#xD;
when lie had gained his confidence, launched&#xD;
into his weak and impressible mid the&#xD;
poisoned arrows of suspicion, upon which base&#xD;
the crafty villain designed to erect the super-&#xD;
structure of his intrigue.&#xD;
John Van Strom had not only failed to re-&#xD;
sent the impertineices offered to his guest by&#xD;
Stiletto. but had maintained a dogged silence,&#xD;
which encouraged the bold offender. John,&#xD;
however, seemed satisfied when Montant had&#xD;
lef, the room, and said,-&#xD;
Let us have a social glass of wine, Stil-&#xD;
lmtto I  We can be merrier without that&#xD;
solemn chap's companionship.&#xD;
"Cote, sirs, let us drink,&#xD;
While the glasses chink," &amp;amp;c.,&#xD;
he roared, at the top of his voice, as if pos-&#xD;
sessed. by some demon, while lie filled both&#xD;
glasses to the brim, and emptied his at one&#xD;
gulp. Stilletto was not slow in following his&#xD;
example, and another bottle of champagne&#xD;
having been called for, the neo friends be-&#xD;
came more and more charmed with each other.&#xD;
Such au ,acute general as the Italian had&#xD;
proved himself, would not lose this golden&#xD;
opportunity for defaming the character of&#xD;
Montant, and lie accordingly put in many&#xD;
&#xD;
severe and cutting remarks about that gentle-&#xD;
man, until, at a late hour, good or evil fortune&#xD;
brought the latter into thne room.&#xD;
He had just left Josephine and Bella, to&#xD;
whom lie had complained, in a manly, dignifiedi&#xD;
way, of the manner in which John had pr-&#xD;
mitted the almost incredible insolence of Mr.&#xD;
Stilletto, and he informed them that lie would&#xD;
not consent to remain under their roof that&#xD;
night. unless amends were made to him fhr&#xD;
the insults he had received. To Bella's sot-&#xD;
rowful prediction, that such a demand would&#xD;
only lead to general discord, our hero quietly&#xD;
assured her that he would bear the conse-&#xD;
quences alone; that his action was dictated by&#xD;
his manhood and sense of honor, and he re-&#xD;
mained deaf to their entreaties for peace. "I&#xD;
think I need not ask him for the privilege of&#xD;
marrying you, my dear Josephine; and I nun&#xD;
quite sure that I am independent of him, or his&#xD;
pecuniary assistance, as I told him very&#xD;
distinctly."&#xD;
So he came back to the room where the new&#xD;
friends were enjoying themselves, and imme-&#xD;
diately upon encountering their more curious&#xD;
than leased glances, informed them of his&#xD;
erraitd.&#xD;
"Mr. Van Strom, after recovering from my&#xD;
momentary anger, I have returned to ask you,&#xD;
as host here, whether you will kindly hint to&#xD;
Mr. Stilletto, that in choosing the protecion&#xD;
of your roof, from which to safely attack me,&#xD;
lie has made a mistake; and that in insulting&#xD;
me, lie has insulted you--my host -anI ldt&#xD;
you require an apology made to me at once&#xD;
inst nel of answering, Join, with a malicious&#xD;
grin, turned to Stilletto and said,-&#xD;
Answer, friend."&#xD;
" Do not open your lips I" cried our hero,&#xD;
trembling with the rage which was fast gaining&#xD;
the utmstery-. "Not a word from  you," lie&#xD;
added, between his teeth, turning so squarely&#xD;
upon Stilletto, that the latter, borne back by&#xD;
that fiery glance, recoiled to the very wall.&#xD;
"Not one word, at your perilI"&#xD;
" Well, then," cried John, with a red face,&#xD;
and flashing eyes, "I'l answer you&#xD;
But at this moment Bella appeared at the&#xD;
door. She had no sooner cast one look at her&#xD;
husband, than she was at his side. Half a&#xD;
year ago he might have east her from him in&#xD;
contemptuous fury, as lie had done at the&#xD;
Priory; but she had not made himt her study&#xD;
and sole object in life without gaining more&#xD;
power over him than she then possessed&#xD;
Power of what kind ? Call it magnetism; call&#xD;
it cunning; call it will-power, or love, or the&#xD;
influence of one human soul upon another;&#xD;
but it was a power sufficient to lead him out&#xD;
of that room, in spite of the mad attack that&#xD;
was upon him, and which in another moment&#xD;
would have carried him beyond control.&#xD;
White as death, his under-lip quivering, as&#xD;
we have seen it before, Stilletto stood, his&#xD;
eyes flashing forth a world of hatred, confront-&#xD;
ing our hero in the impotent fury of a chained&#xD;
dog.   He knew that he    had   no chance&#xD;
against that man, as he stood with his arms&#xD;
folded, his -eyes riveted on him, his breast&#xD;
heaving, and his lips drawn tight, in the effort&#xD;
to be eahlm; but Stilletto's evil genius drowned&#xD;
&#xD;
his prudence in the mad boiling of his South-&#xD;
ern blood, and although his physical instinct&#xD;
kept him from attempting violence, his ungov-&#xD;
ernable tongue hissed.these fatal words,-&#xD;
"Where is your hussy?   Why don't she&#xD;
come and take you up-stairs ?"&#xD;
The words had hardly escaped his white&#xD;
lips, when every fiber of his mind and body&#xD;
thrilled with fear for the consequences. An&#xD;
arm of iron was upon him. Blows that knew&#xD;
no moderating restraint showered upon him,&#xD;
marking his villainous face and body, and he&#xD;
felt himself dragged through the hall, knew&#xD;
that the front door was opened, and with a&#xD;
quick succession of parting blows, he rolled&#xD;
down the steps upon the grass, in front of the&#xD;
piazza, and heard the door close behind him,&#xD;
leaving him alone with darkness,-and no in-&#xD;
considerable amount of pain, from the punish-&#xD;
ment received. It took him some time to&#xD;
recover any thing like composure. Ils first&#xD;
thought was to ring the door-bell, and ask for&#xD;
his hat, which had been forgotten in his hasty&#xD;
exit; but he did not dare to confront that man&#xD;
again. In the midst of his dismay, and mad&#xD;
vexation, and pain, and confusion, lie reinem-&#xD;
bered that at the first onset he had given up&#xD;
his life as lost; but that our hero had stud-&#xD;
denly ceased his blows, and contented-himself&#xD;
with k'eking him out like a dog, evidently de-&#xD;
siring to spare his life. So Stilletto came to&#xD;
the conclusion that he had got off pretty well,&#xD;
all things considered; and thinking to himself;&#xD;
"the next time he might finish nc entirely,"&#xD;
he sneaked away from the house, out into the&#xD;
road and darkness, with thoughts that will be&#xD;
umderstood'when we see to what actions they&#xD;
brought him.&#xD;
In the meanwhile, our hero had sunk into a&#xD;
hall chair, exhausted, not by his physical&#xD;
efforts, but by the frenzy Which had mastered&#xD;
him.&#xD;
et he felt relieved, and when' one or two&#xD;
frightened servants appeared, he laughed and&#xD;
told them the circumstances in a few words.&#xD;
Josephine had heard the noise, slight as it was,&#xD;
for Stilletto had not called for help, he belong-&#xD;
ed to a more dangerous class of dogs than&#xD;
those that bark.  The widow had retired ;&#xD;
but, hastily throwing a wrapper around her,&#xD;
came down stairs, pale and frightened at all&#xD;
sorts of dangers which had suggested them-&#xD;
selves to her imagination. Her lover caught&#xD;
her in his arms, and reassured her. Bella now&#xD;
appeared from her room, which was situated&#xD;
in another part of the house.&#xD;
" What happened ?" she inquired, anxiously.&#xD;
"I heard noises, though John only asked who&#xD;
had left, when he heard the hall door closed.&#xD;
I can imagine all," she added, looking atten-&#xD;
tively at our hero. "You have treated the&#xD;
fellow as he deserved, and he left alone instead&#xD;
of with you, as I'told my husband to keep him&#xD;
quiet. I am very glad indeed that the wine&#xD;
had somewhat blunted John's sense of hear.&#xD;
ing !"&#xD;
They then held a council of war. At first&#xD;
our hero insisted upon leaving the house that&#xD;
night, as usual, and going to his lodgings&#xD;
at tie village hoteL. But the earnest prayers&#xD;
of his fair friends prevailed upon him to&#xD;
&#xD;
remain, lest Stilletto, who might be lying&#xD;
in ambush for him, should seek his revenge&#xD;
by striking at his life from some dark cor-&#xD;
ner.&#xD;
So he spent the whole night in the dark&#xD;
parlor, without closing h-s eyes in sleep, think-&#xD;
ing over the occurenees of the evening and of&#xD;
all the possible consequences; and at the first&#xD;
peep of dawn he left the house, whose host,&#xD;
but a few hours previous had offered hin&#xD;
unbounded hospitality, with the firm resolve&#xD;
never to enter it again.&#xD;
CHAPTER VIII.&#xD;
GREAT SUcCESS.&#xD;
"I'l pour this pestilence into his ear."&#xD;
OTHELLO.&#xD;
Ma. STILLETTo had 'laid out a grand and&#xD;
comprehensive plan of action, with a definite&#xD;
object in view.&#xD;
Although unexpected success, as already&#xD;
stated, had crowned his first interview with&#xD;
John Van Strom, it was not pride that now&#xD;
inspired him as lie strode rapidly along, enter-&#xD;
taining himself by violent gesticula tions, hrry-&#xD;
ing through the black night away from toh&#xD;
scene of his late degradation and well-imeri ted&#xD;
punishment. Without his hat, and his coat&#xD;
torn, his whole attire and his hair no less dis-&#xD;
ordered than was his mind, by the sudden vio-&#xD;
lent stop put upon his promising imtrigues, lie&#xD;
sought among the scattered buildings of the&#xD;
village, the house were lie and Mr. Muller had&#xD;
taken up their quarters, and whither we will&#xD;
now precede him, and pay a respectful visit&#xD;
to the great philosopher.&#xD;
Oh, for philosophy and a pipetI What a&#xD;
great man 1err Muller thought himself as lie&#xD;
allowed the fire in the stove before him to ir-&#xD;
radiate its rays of heat upon his lean body?&#xD;
How disdainful of all other worldly wisdom&#xD;
than his own, was the egotistical sneer on his&#xD;
lip, and how compassionately he mentally re-&#xD;
garded that poor humanity which did not&#xD;
appreciate his grand philosophy 1 But with&#xD;
all his superiority, there was one tender spot&#xD;
in that great soul, there was one weakness, a&#xD;
strong weakness, and it took the name of beer.&#xD;
Beer it was that enlivened the companionship&#xD;
of his pipe, beer it was that changed the roar-&#xD;
ing of the storm out doors into soothing music&#xD;
to his ears, and it was beer that beguiled the&#xD;
time of waiting for the return of Stilletto, who&#xD;
had gone through the rain and wind to pay&#xD;
his first visit to John Van Strom and to play&#xD;
the first move in the game those two acute&#xD;
intellects had planned-out.&#xD;
The room in which they sat was one of a&#xD;
suite which they had hired in an tincomfort-&#xD;
able summer boarding-house. The furniture&#xD;
was uncomfortable in shape, while imposing&#xD;
in color, the walls were bare, and the lamp&#xD;
dim. In a remote corner the Italian girl re-&#xD;
t clined on a lounge, mute and motionless. She&#xD;
hardly ever -addressed her conversation to&#xD;
Muller, for she hated him. In fact site hated&#xD;
most people, and especially herself.&#xD;

96                    GOING AND SON.&#xD;
&#xD;
When the lights in the village had all dis.&#xD;
appeared, and honest people had gone to bed,&#xD;
there they still remained in perfect silence,&#xD;
with nothing but their own reflections to break&#xD;
the dreary monotony of the storm without,&#xD;
until they finally heard a noise at the door, and&#xD;
rapid steps in the hall and on the staircase&#xD;
forwarning them of the arrival of Mr. Stilletto.&#xD;
Muller, with his usual dignity, did not change&#xD;
his position, or even turn his head when his&#xD;
chum  entered.  Simonetta being "in the&#xD;
sulks," as Stilletto would say, did not seem&#xD;
aware of his presence, until he cried, angrily,-&#xD;
"Can't you look up, you cursed   fools?&#xD;
Here I come half beside myself with fury, and&#xD;
you dare to run the risk'of turning it to mad-&#xD;
ness ! Look to your rotten bones, you drunken&#xD;
devil; and you, hussy, in the corner, come&#xD;
out into the light or 1'll leave my mark on&#xD;
you I"&#xD;
Simonetta remained motionless until he ad-&#xD;
dressed her in Italian, when she arose and went&#xD;
toward him reluctantly enough. Muller now&#xD;
deigned to turn around, and raised his eye-&#xD;
brows, while he took a survey of Stilletto's&#xD;
condition.&#xD;
"Sit -down," he said, deliberately, pointing&#xD;
to a chair. Stilletto,- upon whom exhaustion&#xD;
and vexation began to have an effect, obeyed.&#xD;
"So lie beat you, I see," said the philoso-&#xD;
pher, crossing one leg over the other, and&#xD;
lighting a fresh pipe.&#xD;
" Who beat me, you drunkard," snarled&#xD;
Stilletto.&#xD;
" Mr. Stilletto," replied the other, loftily,&#xD;
" August Muller can not, must not, will not con-&#xD;
descend to be insulted by the vulgar epithets&#xD;
suggested to your vile lips ,by your innate&#xD;
coarseness ! Fit your tongue to my dignity,&#xD;
sir, and we will further discuss the accident&#xD;
which has befallen you, if I may judge by your&#xD;
disheveled hair, your bleeding countenance,&#xD;
and withal the vehemence of your manner."&#xD;
"'The English of which is, I suppose, that&#xD;
I look as if I had got a good thrashing. Well,&#xD;
it is true."&#xD;
" Candor graces the hero and removes the&#xD;
stain from the coward," said Mr. Muller, with&#xD;
a sneer.&#xD;
Without regaining his temper, Stilletto re-&#xD;
lated what we already know of his visit&#xD;
to John Van Strom. Muller's face brightened&#xD;
with an unwholesome satisfaction as he heard&#xD;
of Stilletto's success-that the seed of discord&#xD;
had been already sown in that quiet house-&#xD;
hold, and that, at that moment, the Italian&#xD;
probably stood higher than any one else in&#xD;
Van Strom's confidence. Stilletto's ejaculations&#xD;
of hate, and threats of revenge, with which he&#xD;
accompanied his narrative failed to disturb the&#xD;
serenity which beamed from the philosopher's&#xD;
countenance, and when all had been told, and&#xD;
Stilletto, worked up into a snarling fury, fin-&#xD;
ally ceased, exhausted, Muller answered,-&#xD;
" All is well, my worthyfriend! The cam-&#xD;
paign has opened gloriously."&#xD;
" The devil it has I That-"&#xD;
" Don't waste your time on eloquence," in-&#xD;
terrupted Muller. "Revenge thou shalt have.&#xD;
Be patient and wait till the time comes."&#xD;
" How shall I have my revenge ?"&#xD;
&#xD;
" Not by dirk or dagger-not by suit or&#xD;
libel-not by any of those mad proceedings by&#xD;
which people heap additional trouble on their&#xD;
stupid heads I Be calm and we will consult."&#xD;
"But revenge I will have, even to his&#xD;
death," cried Stilletto.&#xD;
"Well, we'lltry to have his life for it,"&#xD;
whispered Muller. mysteriously. " But not&#xD;
by murdering him! Oh, no !"&#xD;
" I promise to be quiet and wait patiently,&#xD;
if I can be certain that he will have to drain&#xD;
a bitter cup for this."&#xD;
At this moment Stillett-happened to glance&#xD;
at the Italian girl. She had taken a seat near&#xD;
them and was gazing steadily upon his face.&#xD;
There was a something in her look that did&#xD;
,not suit him, and he told her, angrily, to leave&#xD;
the room. She compelled him to repeat the&#xD;
order in Italian. and then slowly rose to obey.&#xD;
With a defiant air, she was passing through&#xD;
the door, when he, dying to revenge himself&#xD;
on somebody for his hurts, ran after her and&#xD;
actually kicked her.&#xD;
It was more the insult than the violence of&#xD;
the blow that sent the blood to her face, leav-&#xD;
ing it an instant after, deathly pale. Her eyes&#xD;
flashed, her lips quivered, and with a quick&#xD;
movement, her hand sought something hidden&#xD;
in her bosom. Stilletto knew her, and recoiled&#xD;
a step, searching for the weapon he was ac-&#xD;
customed to wear concealed about his person,&#xD;
but, with an exclamation-of fear, he discovered&#xD;
that it was lost. She did not draw, however, but&#xD;
turned away and sought her own chamber after&#xD;
darting one look of scorn and hatred at him.&#xD;
"I promise to wait patiently if I can be&#xD;
certain he will have to drain a bitter cup," she&#xD;
soliloquized, repeating his last remark. "That&#xD;
fool ! He knows what revenge means, and&#xD;
swears his soul away to obtain it, and yet he&#xD;
is not afraid of me."&#xD;
" I have lost my dirk 1" said Stilletto, when&#xD;
he had closed the door upon her. "I must&#xD;
have lost it in the fight I had up there, for I&#xD;
know I grabbed it."&#xD;
"Then it must be in Van Strom's house&#xD;
now," said Muller, sagely, and meeting no&#xD;
contradiction, the philosopher added, thought-&#xD;
fully,-&#xD;
" None but an idiot disdains to use the little&#xD;
incidents which chance throws in the way1"&#xD;
We shall see before very long what re-&#xD;
sulted from this dirk left in Van Strom's house&#xD;
and will leave these two to prolong their con-&#xD;
sultation, which did not treat exclusively of&#xD;
holy subjects, to the small hours of the night.&#xD;
*      *    ,*        *      *&#xD;
After this Stilletto frequently repeated his&#xD;
visits to John, and a change came over&#xD;
the household at Van Strom's. The mental&#xD;
condition of poor John, approaching to posses-&#xD;
sion of perfect reason, reached to a state of&#xD;
gloom, varying with irritation. Dark thoughts&#xD;
and evil suspicions, oppressed him too pal-&#xD;
pably to escape the anxious solicitude of his&#xD;
faithful wife, who now saw reason to fear that&#xD;
the results of her unflinching energy, constant&#xD;
attention, and intelligent treatment would be&#xD;
lost entirely. Her husband, whom shea had&#xD;
accustomed to regard her in the spirit of an&#xD;
obedient, confiding child, became sometimes&#xD;
&#xD;
perfectly obdurate to all her best timed and&#xD;
most skillfully contrived blandishments and&#xD;
counsels. He even repelled her attentions as&#xD;
he had not done since the dark days that had&#xD;
now nearly passed away from her memory,&#xD;
and at such times, his look and manner warn-&#xD;
ed her of actual danger. In former paroxysms,&#xD;
his sullenness or anger were only momentary,&#xD;
evincing no malice whatever; but now his&#xD;
monomania was too well defined to be name-&#xD;
less. The demons of distrust and suspicions,&#xD;
galled him and fevered his ill-balanced brain,&#xD;
constantly gaining strength from him who had&#xD;
first planted those devilish passions in his soul.&#xD;
He thought that he had been blind before,&#xD;
and knew not, poor fool, how utterly pervert-&#xD;
ed his sight had now become; that he thought&#xD;
he perceived what did not exist at all; that&#xD;
he was stimulating every faculty by frantic&#xD;
efforts to detect what only existed in his own&#xD;
poisoned imagination; while, at the same time,&#xD;
he could not recognize that the devil, in hu-&#xD;
man guise, was his teacher.&#xD;
Stilletto's plan, that this poor, rich man&#xD;
should suspect his wife of being leagued with&#xD;
Montant and Josephine in designs upon his&#xD;
money, had succeeded marvelously well, and&#xD;
much sooner than he had hoped for. Intelli-&#xD;
gence and bravery are closely allied in human&#xD;
nature-men of small intellect are cowards!1&#xD;
John had not the courage to confront his&#xD;
wife with open accusations; but he distressed&#xD;
and offended her by ill-humor and petty in-&#xD;
sults, and availed himself of every opportunity&#xD;
to wound her by malcious hints too coarse to&#xD;
be misunderstood.&#xD;
"John," she saidone morning,whenbreakfast&#xD;
had been removed. "John," she repeated, strug-&#xD;
gling between tears and well-founded anger,&#xD;
"I can not pretend not to see the recent&#xD;
change in your tone and manner to me. It&#xD;
would be a strange woman that would not&#xD;
seek an explanation. I ask only for justice.&#xD;
As your wife, as a lady, I ask for kindness&#xD;
and love from you. You have banished Jo-&#xD;
sephine from the table by your rudeness,&#xD;
which you no longer care to restrain. Where&#xD;
is your manliness, your chivalry, that you can&#xD;
not a treat a lady, a guest, your own sister-in-&#xD;
law with respect, while you know that she&#xD;
can not yet leave your house ! I have borne&#xD;
in silence what I have tried to attribute to&#xD;
some passing eccentricity-but, I must speak&#xD;
plainly at last, as your loving, faithful -wife&#xD;
always, and also as a woman determined to&#xD;
preserve her own dignity."&#xD;
It was true that John had become so point-&#xD;
edly insulting in his remarks to Josephine, in-&#xD;
timating no less than that her lover was a&#xD;
needy adventurer, intriguing  for pecuniary&#xD;
gain, that she refused to meet him any more,&#xD;
even at meals. When his wife had concluded,-&#xD;
John had not the hardihood to reply angrily.&#xD;
Distrust and cowardice are awkward compan-&#xD;
ions in a man's mind, and forced him to sullen,&#xD;
and obstinate silence like a spoiled child. Bel-&#xD;
la's power was great, and she knew it well;&#xD;
but with a pang of despair she felt that she&#xD;
-had to fight against a concealed foe, and that&#xD;
her straightforward appeal fell upon a ground&#xD;
all undermined by treachery and fiendish cun-&#xD;
7'I&#xD;
&#xD;
ning. So successfully had Stilletto prepared&#xD;
him against scenes like this, which he had&#xD;
foreseen must occur between the husband and&#xD;
his wife, that with the little Satan's teachings&#xD;
fresh in his mind, he turned a deaf ear to her,&#xD;
determined not to be deceived and coaxed over&#xD;
though, at the same time, he was morally&#xD;
powerless to give expression to his distorted&#xD;
sentiments.&#xD;
The door-bell rang.- With an ill-tempered&#xD;
scowl, he rose in silence, like a whipped cur, to&#xD;
leave the room.&#xD;
" John," said Bella, agitated, in a pleading&#xD;
tone, "my heart tells me that something evil&#xD;
is approaching. If Mr. Stilletto is at the door,&#xD;
do not see him. For the love of God and your&#xD;
poor wife, my dear, dear husband, do not listen&#xD;
to him."&#xD;
This earnest pleading, amounting almost to&#xD;
an agony, penetrated his soul. For a. moment&#xD;
he wavered; for a moment he looked at her&#xD;
like a penitent child; but as she was about&#xD;
throwing her loving arms around him to se-&#xD;
cure her, as yet, doubtful victory, the door&#xD;
opened--Stilletto entered, and, as if his pres-&#xD;
ence dissolved at once the newly-woven tie&#xD;
between them, Van Strom recoiled from his&#xD;
wife's embrace, and welcomed his visitor with&#xD;
a grin of delight.&#xD;
With a low mean bursting from her anguish-&#xD;
ed heart at this her latest and most lamentable&#xD;
defeat, Bella stood for a moment motionless,&#xD;
and then dropped into a chair and averted her&#xD;
face from her cruel enemy.&#xD;
"Good morning, madam," said Stilletto,&#xD;
with unmistakable impertinence of tone, cast-&#xD;
ing upon her repelling attitude a glance of&#xD;
unspeakable impudence, which revealed his&#xD;
whole nature. "I trustyou are as well as the&#xD;
bright look on your face would seem to indi-&#xD;
cate, this morning."&#xD;
As Bella did not choose to notice him in&#xD;
the  least, John, still without the cour-&#xD;
age or desire to upbraid her, took Stilletto by&#xD;
the arm familiarly, and led him out of the&#xD;
room and away from the house.&#xD;
Hours elapsed before Bella left the seat at&#xD;
the window in which she had taken refuge,&#xD;
thence she watched her husband walking, arm-&#xD;
in-arm with the Italian, away across the fields&#xD;
toward the village.&#xD;
" He is taking him to his lodgings, doubt-&#xD;
less," conjectured Bella.  " There they will&#xD;
ply him with drink and thus prepare him to&#xD;
believe all kinds of falsities. Where can. I&#xD;
find counsel? where can I took for hope or&#xD;
for help in this terrible danger? I am seeing&#xD;
him being ruined, body and soul, and I, his&#xD;
wife, am powerless, powerless as a stranger, to&#xD;
rescue him from his peril t"&#xD;
" A change must come," she sighed, ile-&#xD;
spondingly. "This can not go on forever. A&#xD;
change must, must take place I" and a hundred&#xD;
times that day did her prophetic soul re-echo&#xD;
the words, " A great change will come, may&#xD;
come soon, and God grant his aid when it is&#xD;
at handle"&#xD;
*      *      *      *       *      *&#xD;
" I tell you what it is, Stilletto," said John,&#xD;
as the two ill-assorted friends crossed the&#xD;
fields, on their way to the village. "I tell you&#xD;

All right, then. Nothing for us, hey?"&#xD;
Ten thousand each for our valuable ser-&#xD;
vices as trustees; that's all," said Muller.&#xD;
" That all. hey ?" asked Stilletto, with a&#xD;
truly satanic expression. " But of course it is&#xD;
an honor to be trustees l"&#xD;
"He wanted to make it more," said Muller,&#xD;
"but I entreated hinm not to do so. I told him&#xD;
that to prove our disinterested  friendship,&#xD;
with the honor we attain, is worth more than&#xD;
mere money."&#xD;
" We will take care of his property, won't&#xD;
we?"_&#xD;
" We will, sir."&#xD;
A nd  that of the widow, too," cried&#xD;
Stilletto.&#xD;
Which widow ?" asked Muller, sharply.&#xD;
" Oh, she is not a widow yet I" sighed Stil-&#xD;
letto. "I wish she were."&#xD;
For her sake, 1 join in the wish,." answered&#xD;
Muller, with benevolence, pullinig away at his&#xD;
pipe. " Ilie can not make her happy, and it is&#xD;
pure charity to wish lie were dead. But now&#xD;
I will depart to seek my associate in the suit&#xD;
against Judge Bates."&#xD;
low about Montant, the superseded exe-&#xD;
entor ?" hissed Stilletto, detaining himi. "lBow&#xD;
about my'revenge ?"&#xD;
All in good time," said Muller, and having&#xD;
now  worried on his overchat, he left the&#xD;
house.&#xD;
The interview  with Van Strom and the&#xD;
above conversation took place in the front&#xD;
parlor, which was separated from the back&#xD;
parlor by a sliding door, closed when Van&#xD;
Strom  first arrived.  When Mr. Muller set&#xD;
fittth on his professional mission, Stilletto&#xD;
walked to this door and opened it. 11is tove-&#xD;
mnttts were always quick and noiseless, and as&#xD;
he had not tarried in approaching the sliding&#xD;
dlootr, lie opened it almost simultaneously with&#xD;
tle philosopher's ftrewell sentence.&#xD;
ie stood motionless-Simotetta was in the&#xD;
room, and his experienced eye at once con-&#xD;
vineetl him that she had been listening, though&#xD;
she had made a hasty retreat, the instant she&#xD;
saw  the door move. Stilletto's eyes darted&#xD;
fire. Livid, trembling, frenzied with rage, he&#xD;
stood like a tiger ready to spring upon his vic-&#xD;
tim, his head and chest bent forward, his&#xD;
under-lip quivering, and such madness in his&#xD;
face that the girl, in turn, changed color, seri-&#xD;
ously alarmed.&#xD;
"You have been listening!l What did you&#xD;
hear?   Confesss" hissed Stilletto, int a voice&#xD;
she hardly recogntized.&#xD;
"Nothing! May thie .Uoly Virgin forsake&#xD;
me-" shte faltered arid stopped, arrested by&#xD;
the expression of that demoniac white face&#xD;
before her. With a benumbing sensation, she&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb  n="100-101" xml:id="VAC7268-00000051"/>&#xD;
GOING AND SON.&#xD;
&#xD;
FELONY.&#xD;
&#xD;
read in the amazemont on that face what she&#xD;
had done. She had spoken English!/ At this&#xD;
moment she gave herself up as lost, she knew&#xD;
he would kill her. In a moment of terror she&#xD;
had betrayed her secret, shown him that she&#xD;
knew, that she must know many of his secrets ;&#xD;
that though she had loved him, she had never&#xD;
trusted him; but had acted a double part to&#xD;
gain power over him. She knew that there&#xD;
was no hope of his mercy.&#xD;
His fury, violent enough to fetter him for a&#xD;
moment, soon burst forth. He made a rush&#xD;
at the door, to lock it. She knew that if he&#xD;
succeeded, her life was lost.  Mortal fear&#xD;
breaks the paralytic spell of despair, she&#xD;
reaches the door before lie does; she is in the&#xD;
hall; he seizes her hair flowing behind and&#xD;
drags her to the ground. Foaming at the&#xD;
mouth, every feature savagely distorted, every&#xD;
muscle swelled to iron strength, he beats her&#xD;
unmercifully, while with agonizing cries she&#xD;
struggles to make her escape. Finally she&#xD;
manages to reach the hilt of her concealed&#xD;
dagger with one hand; the steel is bare, the&#xD;
point is toward his heart, he forces it from&#xD;
her hand,tbut in the struggle for its possession&#xD;
she breaks away from his grasp.&#xD;
Great philosophers are-apt to be absent.&#xD;
minded in small matters: Muller has left the&#xD;
door open. With one last piercing cry she&#xD;
rushed out of the house and fled away across&#xD;
country as if pursued by the furies.&#xD;
Stilletto found pursuit unadvisable (for sev-&#xD;
eral laborers were in the field at work, in the&#xD;
direction she had taken), so lie took a position&#xD;
at one of the windows whence lie could watch&#xD;
her course, and contemplated the situation. 1&#xD;
His anger subsided, and, singular contrast, lie&#xD;
began to feel sorry for her, and to wish it&#xD;
never had happened.&#xD;
"Such forms is her's are not intended to be&#xD;
thrashed, after all,'' he muttered, "and yet I&#xD;
would have killed her, if she had not got&#xD;
away! She has saved her life and niy neck&#xD;
from a hempen cravat I" le thought of her&#xD;
deceit, of his unaccountable obtuseness in not&#xD;
suspecting that she understood English, d'ur-&#xD;
ing his constant intercourse with her. He re-&#xD;
membered their first meeting, and how it had&#xD;
astonished hini that she could not speak the&#xD;
prevailing language, how  he  had  hardly&#xD;
credited it, but had finally believed, it to this&#xD;
day. le admired her for her craftness and&#xD;
self-control, and now that she was gone, he&#xD;
told himself that ho had almost loved her.&#xD;
"The only woman in the world that I ever&#xD;
really loved has been a lurking enemy, a spy&#xD;
upon all my actions," lie continued, bitterly,&#xD;
and with this reflection, lie threw away the last&#xD;
regret for her loss. The fierceness of his anger&#xD;
returned, in some measure, and it is certain&#xD;
that the treachery of this woman made even&#xD;
such a wicked man worse than he had been.&#xD;
The brutality of his nature, awakened by&#xD;
his cruelty to her, took a firmer hold of him&#xD;
than ever, after he had east away all his for-&#xD;
mer affection for her, and when he left the&#xD;
house soon after, for the purpose of dogging&#xD;
her steps to see what mischief she might be&#xD;
up to (for did she not carry his secrets and an&#xD;
Italian woman's revenge'in her heart ?), his&#xD;
&#xD;
determination might have been correctly ex.&#xD;
pressed by those terrible words of Glou-&#xD;
cester:-&#xD;
"And since I find I can not prove a lover,&#xD;
I am determined to prove a villain I"&#xD;
When August Muller returned, he found.&#xD;
instead of Stilletto, a few lines left for him&#xD;
by that gentleman.&#xD;
" See no one. Hold on to the will at all haz.&#xD;
ards. Get our money and portable valuables&#xD;
together and wait in the house or in the neigh.:&#xD;
hood till I return."&#xD;
.So the great philosopher waited.&#xD;
CHAPTER IX.&#xD;
CROUCHING FOR THE SPRING.&#xD;
" Time, thou anticipat'st my dread exploits;&#xD;
Te fhiem ty purpose never is o'ertook,&#xD;
Unless the deed go with it."-MACBETH.'&#xD;
WHEN John Van Strom, in company with&#xD;
his delightful friend, Stilletto, left his wife to&#xD;
solitude and the discomforts which mark a&#xD;
household immediately after breakfast has beei&#xD;
removed, Bella found herself in a more thotu&#xD;
unhappy mood. The routine of housekeeping,&#xD;
so satisfactory to all womanly women, iulel&#xD;
to divert her mind from anxiety, and-she soon&#xD;
found her way back to the window and passed&#xD;
through one of those hours in life when we&#xD;
realize our utter helplessness, and appeal to&#xD;
God for aid and comfort. A complication of&#xD;
dangers and sorrows was crowding around&#xD;
her; she saw her husband ensnared in the nets&#xD;
of a fiend, her cherished sister, in a most hu-&#xD;
miliating situation, and her friend Montant,&#xD;
thwarted in his hopes and enterprises; Joseph-&#xD;
ine's happiness and very existence jeopardized,&#xD;
and all because a contemptible villain hald&#xD;
wrenched from her the influence over her&#xD;
husband which she had attained as thereward&#xD;
of her unbounded devotion to him and her un-&#xD;
faltering persistency in serving and watching&#xD;
over him.&#xD;
As John, returning from Stilletto's, passed&#xD;
by the stable on his way to the house, the&#xD;
same old coachman who had once driven the car-&#xD;
riage that took him to be christened, approach-&#xD;
ed him with a dismal expression. John's heart&#xD;
was filled with apprehensions, which, after a&#xD;
few words, culminated -in great grief. They&#xD;
reached the stable-door. Open it softly, you&#xD;
old servant, enter with an awe-inspired tread,&#xD;
bereaved master, and let your sorrow speak&#xD;
but in whispers, for the presence of death is&#xD;
here. Stiff and cold, felled to the earth by&#xD;
quick and cruel disease, John's adored mare&#xD;
lies in her stall. Her wondrous spirit has&#xD;
gone to await him on the road to heaven, pro.&#xD;
bably with the faithful intention of dragging&#xD;
him up to St. Peter's porch in some spirit char-&#xD;
iot. Good-bye to your ladvhood, poor Bella!&#xD;
Your eccentricities have been exceeded by&#xD;
your fidelity, and Johan Van Strom forgives&#xD;
them all and bemoans your good qualities.&#xD;
|Your memory wvill be more honored than that&#xD;
&#xD;
of many human beings who live and pass&#xD;
away unappreciated by men that probably&#xD;
think themselves sages, compared with John&#xD;
Van Strom.&#xD;
But John, in his simplicity, bewails his loss,&#xD;
and great, honest tears trickle down his home-&#xD;
ly face. His mind and nervous system had&#xD;
undergone many trials since his acquaintance&#xD;
with Stilletto. His wavering reason had not&#xD;
been perverted without many a torturing&#xD;
doubt and fear, and his temper, leading him on&#xD;
to crazy haste of action, had destroyed his&#xD;
peace. Utterly at war with himself, despond-&#xD;
ent, stung by remorse, still unyielding in his&#xD;
morbid tenacity, and withal, as weak in mid&#xD;
and body as a child, it took but some definite&#xD;
emotion, such as the loss of his mare, to un-&#xD;
string him  completely. In this condition lie&#xD;
entered the house to find his wife still at her&#xD;
window, staring into the void of her thoughts&#xD;
in listless dejection.&#xD;
Ile sank into a chair, and a sob burst from&#xD;
him, which startled Bella into a consciousness&#xD;
of his presence, for she had not heard him enter.&#xD;
"What does    this mean, husband ?" she&#xD;
asked, rising from her chair and approaching&#xD;
him.&#xD;
" It means that I have lost the only thing I&#xD;
loved on earth. My mare is dead i"&#xD;
She stopped short. This was too much.&#xD;
At first hot anger,. even hatred, surged up&#xD;
from her heart, and choked her utterance, but&#xD;
they gave way before the utter misery wrought&#xD;
by his idiotic ingratitude and cruelty, and re-&#xD;
gaining her seat she sank back into it and&#xD;
burst into tears. He misunderstood the cause&#xD;
of her emotion entirely, and said, softly,---&#xD;
"That's right, my love. Weep for her, for&#xD;
she was true to me, and now poor John has&#xD;
not a friend left in the world." -&#xD;
She came to his side, she knelt by him, she&#xD;
encircled him with her arms, and laid her head&#xD;
on his breast.&#xD;
"And have I not been true to you, John, and&#xD;
am I nothing left to you?"&#xD;
"You have, indeed, you have, Belle," he&#xD;
answered, somewhat incoherently, not resist-&#xD;
ing her embrace, and laying his hands on her&#xD;
devoted head. "  And you see it was she that&#xD;
won you, it is to her that I am indebted for my&#xD;
darling wife, and that made her holy to me."&#xD;
Still his wife clung to him.&#xD;
" lla," he continued, almost in a whisper,&#xD;
a strange feeling possesses me. It seems to&#xD;
me as if my head was free from confusion and&#xD;
my thoughts clear. Have I not been an idiot'&#xD;
all my life, my dear wife ?"&#xD;
There was something in his simplicity and&#xD;
Soothing tone that made Bella's heart swell&#xD;
with regained hope.&#xD;
"Answer me, Bella," said John, drawing&#xD;
her toward him with a right smile, which&#xD;
broke like a ray of light through all the heavy&#xD;
clouds which had darkened his soul. " An-&#xD;
swer me, Bella, have I not always been an&#xD;
idt ?"-&#xD;
She was on his knees, and through tears of&#xD;
happiness, looked in his face. And though he&#xD;
here marks of' the strain of his mental disord-&#xD;
ers, yet at this moment, the bright, intelligent&#xD;
liht of hais eyes cast an appearance alnaost of&#xD;
&#xD;
beauty over his countenance. She saw it, and&#xD;
knew for the first time, that she was capable&#xD;
of loving him more than the nurse loves the&#xD;
child entrusted to her care, more than the&#xD;
coldness of mere duty demanded. This sud-&#xD;
den awakening of a hundred new voices in her&#xD;
heart, this precipitate happiness nearly over-&#xD;
whelmed her senses, and in passionate accents&#xD;
she assured him of her love. His face grew&#xD;
brighter and brighter, and they exchanged&#xD;
vows and pledges of an aflection, which, in&#xD;
many an hour of bitterness, she had consider-&#xD;
ed but a mocking farce, the enactment of a&#xD;
blasphemous lie. Finally, he said to her,-&#xD;
" Now, Bella, since we have. found more in&#xD;
each other than we have ever sought for, I&#xD;
wish to speak to you on a grave subject. Be&#xD;
assured that I shall speak plain, common&#xD;
sense to you, for my past follies seem reveal-&#xD;
ed to me as if by a miracle. That dear old&#xD;
horse must have been a minister of heaven,&#xD;
ugly as her form was-for she first got ame a&#xD;
wife, and then died just at the right moment&#xD;
to bring me to my senses."&#xD;
Dear wife,"he continued, when they were&#xD;
seated side by side, " I hope that a foreboding,&#xD;
which is strongly impressed uponi me now, is&#xD;
part of my late distraction; but I fancy that I&#xD;
dn not to live long. Therefore (it is only a&#xD;
fancy, dear. wife) it becomes me to use the&#xD;
few hours still remaining to me to set my&#xD;
house in order. Oh, that I had a son to in-&#xD;
herit ad keep alive the old name of Van&#xD;
Strom I"&#xD;
" Don't talk that way," answered Bella. " Do&#xD;
not demoralize yourself by a morbid contem-&#xD;
plation of death. I am not so weak as to&#xD;
shiver at the more sounl of that word ; but I&#xD;
thank heaven that, so far as my husband is&#xD;
concerned, it has no meaning for me I John,&#xD;
I have a hope which tells of many happy years&#xD;
in store for you and me; and who knows but&#xD;
what, in the mercy o nature's Omnipotent&#xD;
Master, a time may come in which you will&#xD;
have to set in order a larger household than&#xD;
this, which only numbers your poor but loving&#xD;
wife 1"&#xD;
She kissed him affectionately, and then said,&#xD;
archly,-&#xD;
" What did you say to me ? You had some-&#xD;
thing practical on your hips, when you launch-&#xD;
ed off into those dismal fiantasies which I do&#xD;
not choose to encourage."&#xD;
His countenance fell, and his thoughts seem-&#xD;
ed to grow unpleasant, but he replied by ask-&#xD;
ing the plump question,-&#xD;
"Bella, no matter how much you love the&#xD;
now, as you say you do, but did you not marry&#xD;
me for my money ?"&#xD;
This was entering upon dangerous ground,&#xD;
and she quickly summoned all her wits to her&#xD;
aid; for, knowing very well that here was a&#xD;
great opportunity, she determined to gain the&#xD;
day over all the powers of darkness which&#xD;
disputed her mastery over him; and to lose&#xD;
no time about it either. Her intuition prompt.&#xD;
ed her, and she immediately replied:-&#xD;
"When you came, a stranger, to our door, I&#xD;
only gratified may ambition by accepting you.&#xD;
I hope you do not think your good looks cap-&#xD;
tured mc; do you, dear ?" shte added, laughing,&#xD;

GOING AND SON.&#xD;
&#xD;
and stroking his stubborn hair; "although,&#xD;
I must confess, you look quite handsome this&#xD;
morning. But when I first married you, I&#xD;
certainly took you for your money, please&#xD;
your conceit !"&#xD;
John laughed qptright. Mr. Stilletto, so far&#xD;
the woman has the best of it; only it was not&#xD;
your intention that she should have a fair&#xD;
chance.&#xD;
"Now, hear this," cried John, putting his&#xD;
arms around her waist, "she acknowledges&#xD;
herself, the saucy little witch, the very thing&#xD;
which that scoundrel tells me she is doing her&#xD;
best to conceal."&#xD;
" I know the scoundrel you speak of," cried&#xD;
Bella, fixing her flashing eyes on him, "and I&#xD;
mean to have my say now !"&#xD;
" And yet," interrupted John, with sudden-&#xD;
ly-knit brows, " your own words indorse that&#xD;
scoundrel's accusation."&#xD;
"Listen to me, John." said Bella, very ear-&#xD;
nestly. "Did you marry me for love ?"&#xD;
John was puzzled.&#xD;
Well," he answered, " I thought you were&#xD;
good-looking, had a good figure, and, on the&#xD;
spur of the moment, I took you. But, of&#xD;
course, I did not love you as I do now."&#xD;
" And I," rejoined Bella, dryly, " thought&#xD;
you were so-so, and rich, and I took you on&#xD;
the spur of the moment. But. of course, I did&#xD;
not love you as I do now! We are quits, my&#xD;
dear!"&#xD;
"But, Bella, what have been your feelings&#xD;
since then ? Have you not plotted for rmy&#xD;
money, and hoped for my death? Have you&#xD;
not intrigued, and joined others, to take advan-&#xD;
tage of me ?  Do I not owe your attention&#xD;
and fidelity to my fortune ? Answer, woman !"&#xD;
he cried, almost fiercely, " and justify yourself&#xD;
if you can."&#xD;
"'Tlhat I will," she answered. " You ask&#xD;
me whether you owe my love to your money?&#xD;
I answer, that if love can be purchased with&#xD;
money, God in heaven nvay also be bought, for&#xD;
God is Love. Buy a woman, body and soul ;&#xD;
but you receive your purchase with love, the&#xD;
holiest attribute, left out; save her from star-&#xD;
vation-deliver her from torture-take her&#xD;
soul out of the jaws of destruction, and, al-&#xD;
though she can thank you with her life, if you&#xD;
neetl its sacrifice, yet the bestowal of her love&#xD;
rests with God alone."&#xD;
Ie made no reply, and she continued, so-&#xD;
lemnly raising her voice,-&#xD;
" As regards the charge of intriguing against&#xD;
you, in league with your sister Josephine and&#xD;
her lover (don't think I am too dull to compre-&#xD;
hend the whole of this vile calumny), I ask&#xD;
you to consider, for a moment, the baseness&#xD;
of those that accuse ine. You lend an ear to&#xD;
the scum of humanity, you listen to the ven-&#xD;
omous slurs of a man, whose soul is a spring&#xD;
of villainy, and whose very breath is corrup-&#xD;
tion; but, John Van Strom, I am your wife!&#xD;
You hope, some happy day, that I may bear&#xD;
you children, and, when you swore to love and&#xD;
honor me, you made my name yours, my&#xD;
honor the honor of your family, of your home.&#xD;
Name, home, family, yes, even Christianity it-.&#xD;
eelf, and all our civilization, all our respecta-&#xD;
bility, are founded upon marriage, and your&#xD;
&#xD;
wife is the corner-stone of your house. Re.&#xD;
posing entire faith in her, you preserve your&#xD;
own dignity and integrity. Let me beg yo,&#xD;
then, not to heap shame upon yourself, not to&#xD;
degrade yourself by allowing a greedy vagp.&#xD;
bond to dispossess me of your heart,-y-vour&#xD;
heart, John, which is mine, which, to-day , I&#xD;
have received anew from the merciful Father&#xD;
of us all, to hold and keep forever!"&#xD;
She threw herself into his arms, crying like&#xD;
a child. John Van Strom held her tightly to&#xD;
his breast, and there was no more question as&#xD;
to her truth in his mind. He confessed all&#xD;
he had done that morning, and, she helping&#xD;
him to comprehend the craftiness of Mr. Still.&#xD;
letto, he resolved promptly to baffle the plot-&#xD;
ters against his peace without an hour's delay.&#xD;
In the meanwhile, as we already know, Mr.&#xD;
Stilletto had quitted the house in the village,&#xD;
honored or dishonored by his sojourn and that&#xD;
of the great philosopher, for the purpose of&#xD;
watching Simonetta's movements.&#xD;
. Between the house of John Van Strom and&#xD;
the village, the contour of the landscape, mark-&#xD;
ed by bold undulations, was of a somewhat&#xD;
wild character. Ravines and rocks obstructed&#xD;
the road, forcing it into curves hard by perilous&#xD;
descents, and cutting into the hillsides, whose&#xD;
crumbling walls endangered the safety of the&#xD;
thoroughfare. It becomes necessary for ums to&#xD;
pay some attention to a particular point on this&#xD;
road, where a footpath led over a steep hill,&#xD;
around the foot of which the road lay in a long&#xD;
curve.&#xD;
The slope of this hill had been selected by&#xD;
the scanty Roman Catholic part of the neigh.&#xD;
borhmood as a site for a modest little church or&#xD;
chapel, which, small and unpretending as it&#xD;
was, had its share of the ornamental and sen-&#xD;
sual, so peculiar to Rome, in the shape of an&#xD;
audacious plaster-east caricature of the irre-&#xD;
pressible Virgin, standing in a niche on the&#xD;
fagiade next the road.   It was, however, a&#xD;
pretty little chapel, in a romantic spot, half-&#xD;
buried in the pines which studded the hill, and&#xD;
yet not quite shut out from  the view of the&#xD;
surrounding country.&#xD;
The day, which had begun so brightly.&#xD;
changed its mood in the afternoon.   It hed&#xD;
been unusually warm for December; but now&#xD;
Heaven began to knit his brows and closed&#xD;
his golden eye. The winds awoke and began&#xD;
to chase the multiplying clouds, and a chill was&#xD;
flt in the air, foretelling heavy weather.&#xD;
The pines which sentin'eled the lonely ciap-&#xD;
el shook their heads and rocked about with&#xD;
wild gestures; but there was a creature of&#xD;
flesh, benea t them, prostrate before the effigy&#xD;
of the Virgin, not heeding the warning voices&#xD;
of the approaching tempest which moaned in&#xD;
the tree-tops, unconscious of all save her own&#xD;
misery. On her knees, and praying to the&#xD;
Holy Mother with the fervor of despair, Simo-&#xD;
netta Marini long remained perfectly absorbed&#xD;
by the horrors she - had so lately pas-cd&#xD;
through. She knew not that she was watch-&#xD;
ed, but, had she scrutinized one of those som.-&#xD;
ber groves, she might have seen. with terror,&#xD;
a pair of vicious eves. whose piercing glane&#xD;
was riveted on lhen.' After she had uandem'gonme&#xD;
Heaven onhy knows, what agony of soul, amid&#xD;
&#xD;
derived, Heaven only knows, what comfort,-&#xD;
she arose with the energy of one in whoil re-&#xD;
solution has been born of despair. The thick,&#xD;
heavy tresses of her raven hair were her only&#xD;
covering, her simple dress, all torn and Ilut-&#xD;
tering in the wind, her only shelter, as she de-&#xD;
scended the hill with hasty steps, and, gaining&#xD;
the highway, hastened on toward her destina-&#xD;
tion without a backward glance.&#xD;
"By Jove," quoth Stilletto, stepping out&#xD;
from the trees, "she is handsomer than ever.&#xD;
I am afraid I was a fool to lose my temper,&#xD;
and her, together! A  man should not get&#xD;
angry at a woman's treachery. Had I been&#xD;
wise, 1 would have paid her a great compli-&#xD;
inent on her smartness, and flattered her a&#xD;
little, and so I would have saved all."&#xD;
Thus did Mr. Stilletto reason with-himself,&#xD;
keeping the object of his watch in view the&#xD;
while, following her cautiously, and not sur-&#xD;
prised when. she took the direction toward&#xD;
Eben Bates's house. " As I thought," he mut-&#xD;
tered to himself.  "She is going there to get&#xD;
old Martin Bates to help her mar our whole&#xD;
affair. One of them, or both, or all three (if'&#xD;
they can frighten my dear father into joining&#xD;
tlieii), will put in an appearance at John Van&#xD;
Strom's house, not many hours hence. Then&#xD;
will come a great assault on his better nature,&#xD;
Madam Bella in the heat of the battle. They&#xD;
will show him what a black devil 1 am, and&#xD;
what a legion of holy angels surrounds him.&#xD;
Then comes a scene, Judge Ehen Bates peni-&#xD;
tent and forgiven, by-John, may be; Bella and&#xD;
her constituents reinstated in all their lost&#xD;
power; Siionetta sainted even in this life&#xD;
having acted the part of the virtuous sinner,&#xD;
who saves a world of trouble by timely re-&#xD;
forn; and the drama will close with an affect-&#xD;
ing tableau of virtue, generally triumphant.&#xD;
.ohn grinning in the center, Bella weeping on&#xD;
his neck, that cursed dog, Montant, laughing&#xD;
in his sleeve, and poor Stilletto left out in the&#xD;
cold,.with John's latest will more lately re-&#xD;
voked, an i August Muller clearly showing by&#xD;
all philosophy that the miscarrying of our&#xD;
plans is entirely my fault, to comfort him.&#xD;
But wait, adies and gentlemen, I'm not dead&#xD;
yet 1" From the crest of a hill he gained a&#xD;
view of the judge's house, and saw the Italian&#xD;
girl, like a flitting shadow in the distance,&#xD;
open the gate, and hurry up the path to the&#xD;
door.&#xD;
"Now, what shall I do?" said he. "Juwe&#xD;
Eben, even if he is persuaded to side with&#xD;
them, can not harm me very much. No: the&#xD;
real danger lies with John, and to him I'll&#xD;
hasten, and prepare him for the attack."&#xD;
As he crossed the fields on his way thither,&#xD;
it blew so hard that he could scarce keep his&#xD;
feet, frail little monster that lie was. He&#xD;
passed many hamlets, and saw the horses&#xD;
brought in from their work with their manes&#xD;
and tails streaming in the wind. Although it&#xD;
was not raining yet, such a blast filled the air&#xD;
that the anxious faces at the windows told him&#xD;
the inmates feared for the safety of their&#xD;
roofs. It was growing dark fast, though the&#xD;
afternoon wvas still young, and the mad clouds&#xD;
seemed ready to discharge themselves but for&#xD;
the violence of the hurricane, which chased&#xD;
&#xD;
the very rain so fast along, that not a drop&#xD;
reached the ground.&#xD;
"This will be a queer night," thought Stil-&#xD;
letto, making laborious headway, while the&#xD;
favorite cloak he wore on his shoulders, made&#xD;
frantic efforts to escape from  him and elope&#xD;
with its lover, the wind. "A queer night,"&#xD;
he repeated, and the awful roar that greeted&#xD;
him from the woods as he approached the&#xD;
litto chapel, which he had to pass, on his way&#xD;
to Van Strom's house, seemed to chant an&#xD;
angry " Amen" to the sentiment.&#xD;
" What is this ? Were it not for the color&#xD;
of the horse, I should say, that here comes Joln&#xD;
Van Strom, driving to the village in his light&#xD;
wagoni Strange that lie should be out; but,&#xD;
although his yellow mare must have turned&#xD;
gray or died, this is certainly lie."&#xD;
le was not in error. Apparently in danger&#xD;
of being upset by the violence of the wind,&#xD;
John was driving along, and being hailed by&#xD;
Stilletto. stopped his horse.&#xD;
"Hlas Bella turned gray'?" asked Stilletto,&#xD;
with a sneer.&#xD;
" She (died this monuing," : answered John,&#xD;
unueoncernedly, which astonished the Italian&#xD;
still more, and he wondered at the change ap-&#xD;
pareut in John's whole manner. 11lis gloomy&#xD;
and awkward eccentricity seemed to have left&#xD;
him, and there' was a wide-awake intelligence&#xD;
in the glance that met Stilletto's little eyes.&#xD;
Where are you going," asked the latter,&#xD;
imiipudently.&#xD;
To the village to see that lawyer. I want&#xD;
Bates to be prosecuted at once, for what 1&#xD;
begun this morning must be finished, cut and&#xD;
dried, before the end of the week !" Ife spoke&#xD;
with suavity, and seemed to consider this frank&#xD;
explanation a duty to a friend.&#xD;
But it blows hard enough to make one&#xD;
ride on the clouds," cried Stilletto.&#xD;
" You should know that what I do, I do&#xD;
quickly " answered Van Strom, looking to his&#xD;
horse, who would not stand quietly in that&#xD;
wind.    Will you jump in ?"&#xD;
How I would like to go; but t dhare not&#xD;
leave that girl unobserved," thought Stilletto.&#xD;
No, I thank you," lie answered, aloud,'but be&#xD;
careful ; you are alone, and it will be dark&#xD;
when you return!"&#xD;
" I have your dirk with me, which you left&#xD;
at my house seia  days ago," answered Van&#xD;
Strom.&#xD;
" 1lave you?"   cried  Stilletto, quickly.&#xD;
Then I wish you would give it to me ! I will&#xD;
make you a present of this one."  Here he&#xD;
produced Simonetta's handsome weapon from&#xD;
his breast pocket. "The one you have, was&#xD;
given to me by my dear mother, and I hate to&#xD;
part with it."&#xD;
As there seemed nothing unreasonable in&#xD;
tl is, John exchanged weapons.&#xD;
"Does your dear wife know that you are&#xD;
armed?" asked he, carelessly.&#xD;
"she handed me the dirk herself," was the&#xD;
answer.&#xD;
With some trivial remark, they parted, John&#xD;
letting his horse have his own way, and saying&#xD;
m hfirsef:-&#xD;
"It wvas a good idea to treat him politely.&#xD;
lie has nao stuspicion that I am going to the&#xD;

GOING AND SON.&#xD;
&#xD;
village to make a legal and thoroughly com-&#xD;
petent instrument that will revoke my will of&#xD;
this morning. I am glad he did not come&#xD;
along, for I would have been obliged to get&#xD;
rid of him some way, or else to postpone what&#xD;
should not be postponed."&#xD;
Stilletto turned back and entered a little&#xD;
country hotel which lay on the road to Judge&#xD;
Bates's house. Men and women were sitting&#xD;
around the stove, and talking about the fearful&#xD;
gale that was blowing. Being not very far&#xD;
from the sea-coast, there were many relatives&#xD;
of mariners and fishermen among the people&#xD;
who discussed the danger of such a hurri-&#xD;
cane, "and blowing right in shore, too," with&#xD;
troubled looks, and hearts heavy with fear for&#xD;
some friend or relative.&#xD;
Stilletto asked for something to eat, but&#xD;
when it was served, his under-lip, that great&#xD;
indicator of his mental condition, quivered so&#xD;
that he could hardly perform the task. After&#xD;
swallowing a few morsels, he again set forth&#xD;
toward  the village.  Near that part of&#xD;
the road before described, where the little&#xD;
chapel crowned the hill among the trees, lie&#xD;
paused on noticing that a streamlet in a ravine&#xD;
crossed the road, being bridged over by a few&#xD;
timbers rudely laid, and planks placed cross-&#xD;
wise over them. Ie stooped to examine this&#xD;
sort of bridge.&#xD;
" It is easy to tear up one of these planks,"&#xD;
he muttered, " and if some one should do so,&#xD;
and if some one should drive by in a dark&#xD;
night, the horse would probably step into the&#xD;
hole and break his legs."  After having as-&#xD;
sured himself of this fact, he went on in his&#xD;
soliloquy:-&#xD;
" So far, John is evidently all right."  He&#xD;
-little thought that the interference of Martin&#xD;
Bates and the revengeful accusations of the&#xD;
Italian girl were no longer -necessary to undo&#xD;
his intrigues, which seemed to him so wonder-&#xD;
fully successful.&#xD;
A clatter of hoofs reached his ears, and he&#xD;
was delighted to recognize old Judge Bates&#xD;
riding along at a rapid pace, little heeding the&#xD;
wild storm.&#xD;
" Hold, father I" cried Stilletto, jumping in&#xD;
front of the horse's head, and seizing the&#xD;
bridle. "Dismount, for I have to confer with&#xD;
you."&#xD;
The horse shied at the flapping coat worn&#xD;
by the little man, and Judge Bates came near&#xD;
losing his seat. This did not improve his tem-&#xD;
per, and although, after a moment's hesitation,&#xD;
lie did alight, he accosted Stilletto furiously,-&#xD;
" How dare you stop me on the highway,&#xD;
you high-handed bandit ! Had I fallen from&#xD;
my horse, I would have had you arrested for&#xD;
waylaying-"&#xD;
" Stop,"ecried Stilletto. "Don't cry shame on&#xD;
criminals, for you are going to add another&#xD;
crime to your list before many days are over !&#xD;
I want to see you very particularly, and how&#xD;
lucky it is that I meet you by chance. You&#xD;
have been at the village to see Van Strom's&#xD;
great lawyer, August Muller, trying to stave&#xD;
off the suit which is pending against you for&#xD;
raising money under false pretences, to wit,"&#xD;
he added deliberately, " pretending to a cap-&#xD;
italist that a mortgage on which he advanced&#xD;
&#xD;
you money, was a first lien upon your proper.&#xD;
ty, while, in reality another mortgage on the&#xD;
same property was in existence. Am I&#xD;
right ?"&#xD;
"You   barefaced, brutal scoundrel!  For&#xD;
you only did I commit this crime. and from&#xD;
what I learned to-day, I shall probably have to&#xD;
suffer for it."&#xD;
"Look here, father.  If you could make&#xD;
John Van Strom die, by accident, and could&#xD;
make me trustee of his estates, having power&#xD;
to stop or compromise that suit against you-.&#xD;
would you, to save your honor, make a false&#xD;
oath ?"&#xD;
The handsome face of the old judge was flush.&#xD;
ed with riding in the wind; but the blush that&#xD;
now suffused it seemed as'if all the blood&#xD;
in his  body had mounted to     his head.&#xD;
What lie then and there spoke, confront-&#xD;
ing his fiendish son while the storm was rag.&#xD;
ing around them, while the wild voices of&#xD;
nature drowned their own, and the blast chill.&#xD;
ed them to the marrow,-what he said and&#xD;
then revoked,-what he swore and then gain-&#xD;
said,-how lie struggled and then succumbed,&#xD;
-all this must be left to oblivion, even as each&#xD;
word that escaped their lips was snatched&#xD;
away by the fury of the winds and hurled&#xD;
away to empty space. But, on their parting&#xD;
these words were heard,-&#xD;
" I will do it because I must, but heaven&#xD;
grant that you get no opportunity !"&#xD;
The judge did not know that it was growing&#xD;
darker very fast, that it was beginning to rain,-&#xD;
or that a night was coming when the elements&#xD;
were to exhibit their foulest behavior. le&#xD;
was only conscious of a tumult in his breast&#xD;
and a darkness in his soul which was never&#xD;
to know the dawn of day again.-      ."&#xD;
His horse took him home on a run, more&#xD;
anxious to reach it than his master, and the&#xD;
latter was somewhat relieved to find that Mar-&#xD;
tin had gone out, leaving word that, if it&#xD;
should rain hard he might not return that&#xD;
night. They also told him that a strange wo-&#xD;
man had called for his brother, and that they&#xD;
had left the house together. Eben scarcely&#xD;
heard the latter intelligence, but pleading ex-&#xD;
haustion lie retired early, though lie knew he&#xD;
could not sleep; though he knew that he&#xD;
was doomed to watch this dreadful night,&#xD;
and to wait for morning, without closing an&#xD;
eye. And so Judge Eben Bates waited.&#xD;
CHAPTER X.&#xD;
THE MURDER.&#xD;
" Yonder's foul murder done."&#xD;
OTELLO.&#xD;
"I WILL move to town next week,".said&#xD;
Mrs. Van Strom to herself, when John had left&#xD;
her to have his horse (alas no more the gentle&#xD;
and elover Bella) put to the carriage. " I will&#xD;
certainly move to town," she repeated, seated&#xD;
by the fire and enjoying the warmth of its&#xD;
cheerful blaze. Had she not reason to he&#xD;
happy? More than happy--she was grateful&#xD;
to heaven for having given her a husband sihe&#xD;
&#xD;
could love, for one she could only pity. Now,a&#xD;
since John had been reborn to reason by what I&#xD;
might almost be called a miracle of mental de-i&#xD;
velopment, now, since in her own heart also a&#xD;
new day had dawned, now she realized their&#xD;
immense difference between loyalty and love.,&#xD;
Loyalty, the noblest issue of the mind-love,&#xD;
the very life of the heart.&#xD;
Oh, what a Lappy day had she spent! John&#xD;
had been affectionate and reasonable. Was not&#xD;
that enough to make a wife love her husband?&#xD;
How niany women in the wide world could&#xD;
say this moment: " My husband has been ami-&#xD;
able and reasonable all day ?" And now John&#xD;
had gone to undo with one stroke of his pen,I&#xD;
all the machinations of her enemies, and the&#xD;
great change that she had hoped and prayed&#xD;
for, had come to pass. Josephine was saved,&#xD;
restored to her lawful inheritance, and a future&#xD;
spread before her which was almost too glori-&#xD;
ous to be believed entirely.            .&#xD;
" I will move to town next week I" said Bel-&#xD;
~a, for the third time, " I can stand a good deal&#xD;
of country life, but when the wind blows so&#xD;
hard as to shake the marrow of my bones, I&#xD;
would rather be excused from living right on&#xD;
the top of the highest hill in the country.&#xD;
Doesn't it seem as if some calamity was piling&#xD;
up over our heads ? These fearful noises,&#xD;
this appalling commotion outdoors as if heaven&#xD;
and earth were being hurled at each other to&#xD;
form a new chaos ! I wish John had come&#xD;
back again."-&#xD;
She listened. The dismal howl in the flue&#xD;
and the confused roar of the storm without,&#xD;
alone gave answer to her listening ear.  A&#xD;
hundred times she imagined that she heard&#xD;
wheels. It was but the battering of the rain&#xD;
against the windows, or a fresh blast gaining&#xD;
strength in the distance to sweep down upon&#xD;
the house with such a mad violence, that the&#xD;
very earth seemed to tremble with the exer-&#xD;
tion of holding the foundations firmly in their&#xD;
places, to save the tottering masonry. Bella&#xD;
grew restless, then fearful, and finally, appall-&#xD;
ed by nameless apprehension. Perhaps the&#xD;
blessedness of to-day was too much for fate to&#xD;
allot without admixture; perhaps the ' cruel&#xD;
gods would wrest from her this very night&#xD;
what they had given with mocking kindness ;&#xD;
perhaps heaven had vouchsafed to John one ray&#xD;
of its glorious light, only, as it were, on his&#xD;
death--day-perhaps Eternal Justice would en-&#xD;
hance her punishment for a giddy deed, by&#xD;
showing her a happy change in that which&#xD;
she was to lose, that her loss might be the&#xD;
heavier.&#xD;
Her nervous system, usually so firm and&#xD;
so impassive, gave way to an excitement she&#xD;
had not known before. Her discomfort as-&#xD;
sumed imaginary shapes. Was John dead?&#xD;
Was his bodydistorted by the pangs of death,&#xD;
lying somewhere out in the black night, feel-_&#xD;
ing no longer the storm which rages round&#xD;
him, hearing no more the voice of the ele-&#xD;
ments? " John, John I" she cried aloud, jump-&#xD;
ing up, and clasping her hands. "John where&#xD;
are you? Speak to me ! Give me some token&#xD;
of your presence, speak bunt one word!" But&#xD;
as she listened, the eonly reply was a hollowv&#xD;
moan of desolation, which arose far, far away,&#xD;
&#xD;
and swelled as it came nearer into a fearful&#xD;
howl, striking the house as if it would sweep&#xD;
it from the face of the earth.&#xD;
But what is this? She feels that some one&#xD;
is approaching the house. The bell rings, she&#xD;
rushes to the chamber door, delighted, " John,&#xD;
John, where have you been so late, husband ?"&#xD;
escapes from her lips before she can see who&#xD;
is at the dooi-. There is no response; but the&#xD;
old butler comes half-way up the stairs with&#xD;
a face as long as a barometer, indicating foul&#xD;
weather, and says:-&#xD;
" Mr. Bates, ma'am, Mr. Martin Bates, and a&#xD;
young woman with him, ma'am, as I doesn't&#xD;
know, and doesn't want to know, if you please,&#xD;
ma'am."&#xD;
Bella immediately descended to the parlor,&#xD;
and there found Martin Bates, and a woman&#xD;
dressed in black. Too nervous to pay much&#xD;
attention to what they had to say, she hardly&#xD;
noticed the careful recital of Martin Bates,&#xD;
occasionally interrupted by the vehement&#xD;
ejaculations of the Italian girl; for ehe knows&#xD;
all; knows of Stilletto's artifices-Muller's&#xD;
nice calculations,--John's 'temporary halluci-&#xD;
nations.&#xD;
" I do not desire to hear my husband's weak-&#xD;
ness enlarged upon by those that are not friend-&#xD;
ly to him," she said proudly. "What you have&#xD;
told me I know, for I am the wife of John&#xD;
Van Strom."&#xD;
Martin Bates sits at the table where the&#xD;
lamp burns, fretfully, as if the storm had&#xD;
frightened its strength and vigor away. The&#xD;
face of the old man is more haggard and death-&#xD;
like than ever, and if you look closely at his&#xD;
dull eyes, it seems as if death had east a fore-&#xD;
running shadow over his soul, and his features&#xD;
are shrunken and corpse-like. The Italian&#xD;
woman sits in the shade, and though her face&#xD;
can not be seen, the very air around her trem-&#xD;
bles with her suppressed passion, and her&#xD;
voice, when she speaks resembles the sub-&#xD;
dued voice of a charmed fury.&#xD;
" As usual, my kindness is returned by in-&#xD;
gratitude," said Martin Bates. " I have dis-&#xD;
closed the plans of a devil to you, showed you&#xD;
the brutality of a hog and the viciousness of&#xD;
a monster, yet you shut your ears to the&#xD;
counsel of a friend."&#xD;
" My ears, old man," cried Bella, " are wide&#xD;
open to hear news of my husband 1 I have&#xD;
watched for him until I am nearly distracted.&#xD;
With him. I fear neither devil, beast, nor mon-&#xD;
ster. If he die, let the whole world surrender&#xD;
to Satan, I don't care '"&#xD;
" He will murder him!1" hissed Simonetta.&#xD;
- Bella turned fiercely upon her. "Do you&#xD;
wish to call forth curses on your lips, with&#xD;
your foul prophecies? Haven't you known all&#xD;
this and held your tongue until he cast you off&#xD;
-until he ceased to keep you as his dear mis-&#xD;
tress, and most likely, willing accomplice.&#xD;
Your vengeance, not your honor speaks, young&#xD;
woman; and had I known all I now know,&#xD;
John would not be out to-night. I have been&#xD;
listening for the sound of his wheels while&#xD;
you were telling your story, and did not gather&#xD;
more than half of what you said; but new, all&#xD;
at once, I see the whole danger. He has gone&#xD;
out alone into the night to save a miserable&#xD;

&#xD;
fortune. God knows I would willingly pay&#xD;
my last dollar to see him home again in&#xD;
safety."&#xD;
The door opened, and Josephine appeared,&#xD;
Bella rushing toward her and threw her arms&#xD;
around her. "Josie," she cried, "save me&#xD;
from these people!l"&#xD;
"Why, Bella, you must be seriously sick,"&#xD;
answered the widow. "I never thought you&#xD;
could be agitated like this. What ! my strong,&#xD;
self-reliant sister carrying on like a child !&#xD;
What is the matter?"&#xD;
"I am worried about John," Bella whispered&#xD;
in her ear.&#xD;
" How absurd," answered Josephine. " It&#xD;
is only just dark. and he can not get back so&#xD;
quickly.  Besides." she added, with a calm&#xD;
smile, " Ernest is returning with him, you&#xD;
know."&#xD;
Her soothing, confident tone did not fail to&#xD;
have an effect on Bella. With a manner no&#xD;
one would have thought her capable of she&#xD;
turned to Martin Bates, and said:-&#xD;
"1Mr. Bates, the night is more than danger-&#xD;
ous for travelers. 'T'hink not that because I&#xD;
spoke hastily, I have forgotten the duties of&#xD;
hostess or the teachings of hospitality, and let&#xD;
me entreat you and that lady to spend the&#xD;
night here."&#xD;
Another ring of the bell prevented Martin's&#xD;
reply. Bella flew to the door and there&#xD;
stood still as if turned to marble. -White as a&#xD;
sheet, site held her hands to her heart ; some-&#xD;
thing, God only knows what, had given her a&#xD;
shock. Josephine rushed to the hall door.&#xD;
Bella heard a smothered bustle, confused, but&#xD;
hushed voices reached her car. The front&#xD;
door was opened wide-they were carrying&#xD;
something in. A word-a whispered word-&#xD;
was spoken ; but had it been breathed by a&#xD;
zephyr in the midst of the Great Desert, her&#xD;
ears would have caught it. With a low moan,&#xD;
she sank senseless into the arms of Martin&#xD;
Bates, who bent over her with a face like&#xD;
living death.&#xD;
*    *    *    *    *    *    *&#xD;
John had finished his business. The will&#xD;
was "1 Made. signed, sealed, and delivered "&#xD;
safely, and the friends were recoiled. John&#xD;
and our hero climbed into the light wagon to&#xD;
drive back to the house, which Montant did&#xD;
not intend to leave again until he should take&#xD;
his bride with him.   Premature darkness&#xD;
covered the road and made it almost undis-&#xD;
tinguishable.&#xD;
I wish we were at home," said John.&#xD;
"So do others besides us," answered our&#xD;
hero. " The horse can hardly face this ter-&#xD;
rible gale. In such a night, folks should stay&#xD;
at home in mere gratitude for having a home&#xD;
to stay in."&#xD;
 In such a night," said John, "the angel&#xD;
of death rides upon the clouds, and frightens&#xD;
away the angel of life."&#xD;
" In such a night," continued our hero, to&#xD;
kill time, "love seeks his mate and people&#xD;
bless the warmth of their hearths and hearts&#xD;
which keeps out the blast."&#xD;
"In such a night." said John, "human mis-&#xD;
ery cries out to heaven and despairs at the&#xD;
angry answerss"&#xD;
&#xD;
" And religion bends the knee and trembles&#xD;
before the power of God."&#xD;
"In such a night " continued John, in a hol-&#xD;
low voice, " heaven and hell sweep close to the&#xD;
earth."_&#xD;
"And Nemesis watches for victims."&#xD;
"It is easy for a man to die in his bed when&#xD;
God calls him away, but I would not like to&#xD;
die when all is dreary, and bleak, and deso.&#xD;
late around its 1"&#xD;
"Iold!" cried our hero. "Is that a man by&#xD;
the roadside ?"&#xD;
Was it a specter that danced across the&#xD;
road, making the horse stop and snort with&#xD;
fear, or was it a weird shadow of the night&#xD;
which had flitted by under the trees. Surely&#xD;
a hundred spirits seemed hovering about ; but&#xD;
this was a tuan.&#xD;
"Ite is gone !" said our hero, who had&#xD;
drawn a dagger which John had given hin,&#xD;
le being the better man to carry it, "but I am&#xD;
certain it was a man standmg close to the&#xD;
wheel as we passed. When the gale rips up&#xD;
the ground it sounds as if there were steps he.&#xD;
hind us and beside us; but my eyes are good&#xD;
and I will trust them, even when I know that&#xD;
my other senses are deceived."&#xD;
4" There are voices in the air," cried Van&#xD;
Strom. "Perhaps they warn us of danger. I&#xD;
wish we were home."&#xD;
Ernest Montant seconde the wish in his in-&#xD;
most heart but they had( slow work before&#xD;
them. The horse struggled bravely against&#xD;
the piercing rain and the terriffie gale; but on&#xD;
the slippery, undulating ground, little niore&#xD;
than a brisk walk could le obtained. Stud-&#xD;
donly, they both felt a shock, and, before their&#xD;
eyes, the horse seemed to sink into the ground.&#xD;
A strange and supernatural cry chilled their&#xD;
hearts, and made their hair stand on end.&#xD;
"Great God!" cried John, "this is an evil&#xD;
spirit's voice."&#xD;
"No !"cried Montant, jumpingto the groumel,&#xD;
"I have heard that cry before. It comes from&#xD;
our poor horse. I am afraid he has broken a&#xD;
leo-"&#xD;
They examined the struggling brute, and&#xD;
found that his leg was indeed broken. as our&#xD;
hero had surmised. le had stepped into a&#xD;
hole where t plank had been removed fromt&#xD;
the little bridge we know of, and there had&#xD;
snapped the bone of his leg.&#xD;
" Here is foul play," cried Montant. "We&#xD;
do not know who may be at our backs. Let's&#xD;
leave the horse and trudge on. We are not far&#xD;
from hiote 1"&#xD;
Look 1" said John, pointing tap the hill by&#xD;
the roadside. " Isn't there a light in the old&#xD;
chapel?"&#xD;
The reader knows the spot where this acci-&#xD;
dent had befallen them. Right above them&#xD;
stood the Roman Catholic chapel, and by one&#xD;
of those strange phenomena of a stormy night,&#xD;
it seemed indeed as if a light shone from it.&#xD;
" It does seem so," answered Montant, pos-&#xD;
sessed with a fear, a nameless dread that he&#xD;
could neither account for nor shake off. " Hurry&#xD;
ip-come on. If this means murder, I shall&#xD;
sell my hife deamrly I"&#xD;
" Lord have mercy on my soul!"&#xD;
Wild was the cry which accompanied these&#xD;
&#xD;
words, the last that John Van Strom uttered'&#xD;
in this world, a cry that burst from a heart&#xD;
laid open by a foul blow. He fell-a man was&#xD;
struggling with our hero over his body, the&#xD;
assassin broke away almost immediately and&#xD;
lied through the woods as if already pursued&#xD;
by the avenger.   The leaves start from the&#xD;
ground and flee after him-lie hears pursuing&#xD;
steps in their rustling. The shadows of the&#xD;
night crowd around him and lay a hundred&#xD;
traps for his perdition; but he clears them&#xD;
and rushes away. On, away, with the foul&#xD;
deed on his heart, with the stamp of murderer&#xD;
on every line of his face wherever he goes,&#xD;
with the ghost of the murdered man linked to&#xD;
him for all eternity. Flying with him-sinking&#xD;
to the ground with him when he falls from&#xD;
slicer exhaustion-talking with huti when he&#xD;
soliloquizes-dining byhis side when lie eats-&#xD;
laughing at him when lie forces a smile, but&#xD;
not sleeping when he sleeps. No, no, never&#xD;
sleeping to give the murderer rest until Eter-&#xD;
nal Justice has been satisfied.&#xD;
The furiously raging storm sends the fallen&#xD;
leaves in all directions from the spot where&#xD;
the corpse lies to proclaim the deed of horror.&#xD;
The trees hear of it and shake their heads,moan-&#xD;
ing aloud, so that the few remaining birds start&#xD;
&#xD;
from their sleep with horrid, monstrous night-&#xD;
mares. A ghost sweeps. through the house&#xD;
where Bella is watching, and in its presence&#xD;
the flame of the lantern over the gate expires&#xD;
with a ghostly grimace like the last quiver of&#xD;
a criminal on the gallows.&#xD;
The wind tolls the bell on the little Roman&#xD;
Catholic chapel as if a shadowy congregation&#xD;
were summoned by that funeral knell to sing&#xD;

forth from its gothic interior. Perhaps, far oil'&#xD;
at the Priory, the wind is tolling that old&#xD;
monkish bell at this same moment in honor of&#xD;
the last Van Stronh, as it did at the death of&#xD;
his father.&#xD;
From the thousand dumb witnesses the&#xD;
news ascends to the skies, and the moon parts&#xD;
the ragged clouds to see if it can be true, and&#xD;
looking down suddenly coats the little chapel&#xD;
with silver. There in the middle of the road,&#xD;
right near the house of God, half buried al-&#xD;
ready in the mud of mother earth, which will&#xD;
soon claim his body wholly,-there within his&#xD;
face all white and limbs distorted, lies the holy&#xD;
of poor John Van Strom, each lineament softly&#xD;
visited by the tender rays of the moon, with&#xD;
Stilletto's dagger in his heart and its hilt glit-&#xD;
tering in the silvery light.&#xD;

GOING AND SON.&#xD;
&#xD;
On his right, "IHobgoblin " awaits him, on&#xD;
his left, "Hobgoblin" asks his attention; be-&#xD;
hind his back, "Hobgoblin " stands out in im-&#xD;
pudent relief. " Hobgoblin " confronts him in&#xD;
a hundred different handwritings; it meets his&#xD;
eye at every turn, and flows mockingly from&#xD;
his pen when he commences to write. His&#xD;
sharp, sallow face, his piercing black eyes, his&#xD;
homely mouth with the bitter sneer set -in&#xD;
withered wrinkles, show plainly in the circle&#xD;
of light cast by the lamps, while darkness&#xD;
crowds around him, and ugly shadows dance&#xD;
attendance on him, and sit upon his crooked&#xD;
back. Thus, like a master goblin banished&#xD;
from the Christian world, and concocting some&#xD;
horrid scheme of mischief, the great lawyer&#xD;
spends Christmas-eve working up the defence&#xD;
in the great suit of Going versus The Trust-&#xD;
ees of the Hobgoblin Mining and Manufactur-&#xD;
ing Company.&#xD;
A knock at the door. Mr. Paradise takes no&#xD;
notice of it. Another, and a third, with the&#xD;
same result, and the visitor, perhaps, accus-&#xD;
tomed to the lawyer's manner, considers the&#xD;
notice sufficient and enters.&#xD;
"What do you want ?" asked Mr. Paradise,&#xD;
gruffly. le has not turned his face toward&#xD;
the intruder; but knows that it is old Smiles,&#xD;
the most faithful and the most dismal of ser-&#xD;
vants. Smiles, in the days of his youth, thought&#xD;
he would be a lawyer, and to that end com-&#xD;
menced reading law and copying law. Upon&#xD;
abandoning the reading as hopeless, he had&#xD;
"coped law these thirty years, sir," a state-&#xD;
ment which unfailingly drew tears from him&#xD;
whenever he told any one his story; but finally'&#xD;
he had changed his condition of semi-starva-&#xD;
tion and the profession of law-copyist, to be-&#xD;
come special attendant, door-keeper, messenger,&#xD;
and factotum of a lower grade, in the office&#xD;
of Messrs. Graves &amp;amp; Paradise. Thus, from&#xD;
the funeral of his ambition, though it left him&#xD;
in perpetual melancholy, arose an humble post&#xD;
of ease, good pay, and comfort, in his old&#xD;
age.&#xD;
"I crave your pardon, sir," said the sepul-&#xD;
chral voice of Mr.Smiles, from the dark depths&#xD;
of the room ; "a lady wants to see you. She&#xD;
is veiled in black, she has come through the&#xD;
storm in the night, alone and unprotected. It&#xD;
is a case of-of-in fact it must be a case of&#xD;
murder or crim-"&#xD;
Mr. Paradise would have interrupted him&#xD;
sooner, but he was for once, very much&#xD;
astonished at the announcement, and the ejac-&#xD;
ulation which now escaped him, was instantly&#xD;
followed by another still more significant of&#xD;
amazement, when the lady, "veiled in black,"&#xD;
having followed upon the heels of Mr. Smiles,&#xD;
stepped into the circle of light which fell from&#xD;
the students' lamps in the center of the room,&#xD;
and presented to the astonished gaze of the&#xD;
hunchback, a graceful figure robed in heavy&#xD;
mourning.&#xD;
"You may well be surprised at seeing me&#xD;
here at this most singular time and hour," she&#xD;
said, in a rich, deep voice, which trembled&#xD;
with agitation, "but I drove to your house in&#xD;
Washington Square, and was there advised to&#xD;
look for you here. I, must see youm at once&#xD;
upon business of such importance as no earthly&#xD;
&#xD;
interest can divert meI" and she took off her&#xD;
veil.&#xD;
" Mrs. Van Strom !" cried Paradise, quite be-&#xD;
wildered, "you are the last person I expected&#xD;
peeled out of this black husk. Smiles, leave&#xD;
us."&#xD;
' And bid the carriage wait-two hours if&#xD;
necessary," added Josephine Van Strom. "I&#xD;
will pay the man well for it."&#xD;
"What in the world gives me this honor,&#xD;
Madam ?" asked the lawyer, not very respect-&#xD;
fully. "You have hunted me out in rather an&#xD;
inopportune moment, and I have not the time&#xD;
to gratify women's whims on Christmas-eve,&#xD;
which should be a time of respite even for&#xD;
lawyers I"&#xD;
"Mr. Paradise, I am past being offended at&#xD;
your insults, past heeding any one's anger,"&#xD;
said Josephine, having sunk into a chair near&#xD;
him. "I have come to you on a matter of life&#xD;
and death, and though it be Christmas-eve, I&#xD;
want your services instantly, for you, I believe&#xD;
to be the fittest person to help me. Here is&#xD;
your retainder or retaining fee, whichever you&#xD;
call it."&#xD;
Mr. Paradise glanced at the thousand dol-&#xD;
lar bill she had placed upon his table, and then&#xD;
at her. In her face, beautiful as ever, he saw&#xD;
the traces of such suffering, that he relented ;&#xD;
and settling lumself for a patient and most&#xD;
thorough hearing of the case, he returned her&#xD;
the bill, saying, with a touch of respect in his&#xD;
voice,--&#xD;
" Take it back for the present. We will first&#xD;
hear what you have to say."&#xD;
She received the note again, half uncon-&#xD;
sciously, and crumpled it up nervously in her&#xD;
soft, white hand; but before she spoke again,&#xD;
the color rose to her cheek, and her eyes were&#xD;
downcast.&#xD;
"Mr. Paradise," she commenced, timidly,&#xD;
yet determined to lose no time in entering&#xD;
upon the subject, " I have laid myself open to&#xD;
your censure; nay, placed myself at the mercy&#xD;
of your ridicule, in coming to you alone at&#xD;
might, and in this strange manner; but there is&#xD;
one in danger, who, perhaps, has no other&#xD;
friend than me."&#xD;
"Fiend/" repeated Mr. Paradise, with an&#xD;
involuntary relapse into sarcasm. "I assume&#xD;
that this friend is of the masculine gender, and&#xD;
wonder whether your legal adviser may be in-&#xD;
formed of the nature of your attachment. Is&#xD;
it platonic ?"&#xD;
" Ie is a friend," answered Josephine, with&#xD;
that gentle majesty so peculiar to some women,&#xD;
" to whom I am betrothed."&#xD;
There was something in that simple answer&#xD;
which  touched   the  humpback, and    he&#xD;
said:-&#xD;
" Well, well, don't be offended, but let me&#xD;
know the trouble.'"&#xD;
" Ile is accused of murder." She stopped as&#xD;
if the word choked her. The lawyer gave her&#xD;
time to continue.&#xD;
." He is ;n prison at this moment," continued&#xD;
Josephine, hoarsely, "and, as I verily believe,&#xD;
I am his only friend on'this continent, the duty&#xD;
of saving him devolves upon me. You," she&#xD;
added, with a sudden change of tOne,&#xD;

GOING AND SON.&#xD;
&#xD;
Visions of the misery on earth, of dingy&#xD;
rooms, haggard faces, sickness, and death, and&#xD;
the appalling anguish of mothers who can not&#xD;
appease the plaintive cry of childhood for bread&#xD;
even this hallowed night ;-poverty in all its&#xD;
horrible shapes crowding the streets and curs-&#xD;
ing the illumined palaces of the rich with&#xD;
hungry covetous glaring at the bright win-&#xD;
dows.&#xD;
There came to her a vision of sin; of women&#xD;
dressed in silk, with wanton faces painted into&#xD;
a similitude of freshness. She thought of the&#xD;
hearts heavy, on such a night, with the loss&#xD;
of innocence ; of the millions of lonely tears&#xD;
which wash away the gaudy paint, and of the&#xD;
terrible remorse which cones all too late,-so&#xD;
late that it has to seek solitude to escape ridi-&#xD;
cule in that demi-monde which has east away&#xD;
the better half of life and soul. And the eyes&#xD;
of her mind penetrated prison walls and watch-&#xD;
ed the agony of crime detected, and heartily&#xD;
she pitied every wretched prisoner for being&#xD;
unable to "trust in God an'l fear nothing," as&#xD;
her lover could.&#xD;
And as the lawyer still was reading and&#xD;
making notes, her own life passed before her;&#xD;
the Christmas night of her childhood, when&#xD;
every pulsation of her youthful heart told only&#xD;
of joy and pleasure; a vision of Christmas&#xD;
trees and candles, neither brighter nor more&#xD;
beautiful than the happy faces which crowded&#xD;
around ; remembrances of her solemn happi-&#xD;
ness, when, on this great festival of all ('iris-&#xD;
tendom, she first pledged her troth to her ius-&#xD;
band, and the holy exaltation which tilled her&#xD;
maiden heart, as she bound herself to be a&#xD;
wife according to the teaeings of that Christ&#xD;
whose nativity was then celebrated. Then she&#xD;
thought of the joyous day when her child&#xD;
crowed in her arms, and the world and life&#xD;
seemed to her one endless blessing.&#xD;
The fire was smoldering away into ashes,&#xD;
anl, as the last glow expired on the ernbling&#xD;
heaps, she thought of her husband, of her&#xD;
child, long buriedr--ashes to ashes ; and of&#xD;
herself, left a lonely widow, with naught but&#xD;
two graves in her heart until new life came to&#xD;
her from the mercy of God-new life, new&#xD;
love; and, though she was sad this night, faith&#xD;
in God made harmony between her sweet and&#xD;
bitter thoughts.&#xD;
As the ragged and black and broken surface&#xD;
of this polluted earth is often made clean and&#xD;
smooth aid beautiful by old Winter's festive&#xD;
white robs, so the holy spirit of Christmas&#xD;
descended-upon her bruised and wounded soul&#xD;
and she prayed fervently that " Peace on earth&#xD;
and good will toward men" might be realized&#xD;
as fully as -"Glory to God in the Ilighest."&#xD;
She lost herself in what might be called a&#xD;
trance of devotion, which is not often experi-&#xD;
eneed in our churches. Iler surroundings melt-&#xD;
ed away, the dingy room expanded to a temple&#xD;
of worship, and her immortal soul, unfettered,&#xD;
brought sacrifice of prayer and thanksgiving&#xD;
to the Father above. In her ears a chorus of&#xD;
angels chanted a Christmas carol; with the&#xD;
swelling of the joyful music she felt that some-&#xD;
tiring united hrer heart with a countless nurm-&#xD;
ber of other hearts, lifted rrp to the Divine&#xD;
sourrce of all good irr adoration, and delicIously&#xD;
&#xD;
intoxicating to her devout soul was the exult-&#xD;
ation of being at this moment one step nearer&#xD;
heaven. A sharp though calm voice broke in&#xD;
upon her ecstasy and brought her to herself.&#xD;
"I am done," said the lawyer. She did not&#xD;
immediately answer. When he approached&#xD;
her he found her weeping.&#xD;
" Leave your tears at home, when you come&#xD;
on such serious business as this," said Mr. Par.&#xD;
adise, coldly. She came to her senses at once,&#xD;
and, taking a seat at the table, showed him a&#xD;
resolute face, though full of intense anxiety.&#xD;
"Mrs. Van Strom," said he, "this is a very&#xD;
serious case. His life is in danger."&#xD;
He was startled by the expression of her&#xD;
face. Not a vestige of color was there; -but,&#xD;
through her eyes, he could look in and see the&#xD;
wound she had received by the sudden thrust&#xD;
of those words.&#xD;
"But then," she gasped, " can you, you think&#xD;
for a moment that-Oh, God-no I"&#xD;
"No,"he answered, promptly. "I do not for&#xD;
a moment think that he is guilty. The evidence&#xD;
is cooked uip by some great master of cunning,&#xD;
though, and unless we can find more flaws in&#xD;
it thun I can discern at present, we hardly have&#xD;
a case!"&#xD;
" But, merciful IHeavens ! how can he be in&#xD;
danger while he is innocent?"&#xD;
" We will save our time for business," he&#xD;
answered, "and leave out philosophical puz-&#xD;
zles. This master rind. Do you know who&#xD;
is its happy owner?  Is it the little Italian,&#xD;
Stilletto; whose afidavit fills up so completely&#xD;
this prettily-arranged testimony?  It is, hey?&#xD;

of his name,'that I am right. Now, be a sen-&#xD;

try with his presence. I know a good deal&#xD;
:.about him already, from his connection with&#xD;
the Hlobgolin company, and this knowledge&#xD;
may help is considerably. Proceed."&#xD;
nis unpassionate, practical manner helped&#xD;
her to gather the powers of her nemoiy, while&#xD;
the terrible danger, which seemed to threaten,&#xD;
made her calm   and concise in her account.&#xD;
She told hirmabout Stilletto's visits to John&#xD;
Van Strom, how he had stolen into his good&#xD;
graces, and had finally prevailed upon him to&#xD;
make a will, appointing him and Muller exe-&#xD;
cutors. how DBella had brought John back to&#xD;
his senses, so that, on the day of the murder,&#xD;
he had gone to the village, determined to undo&#xD;
the intriguers, and had succeeded in complet-&#xD;
ing a document, in which ie divided his for-&#xD;
tune equally between ,Bella and herself, and&#xD;
reappointed Ernest Montant to be executor.&#xD;
"Hold   on, there !" interrupted  Paradise.&#xD;
" Stilletto did not know that this last testa-&#xD;
ment, which upset his intrigues, had just been&#xD;
consummated at the time of the murder ?"&#xD;
" lie could not have known it."&#xD;
The lawyer once more referred to the docu-&#xD;
ments. " I see here that the strongest afmida-&#xD;
vit is that of Antonio Stilletto. He says that&#xD;
he heard the accused expressing strong enmity,&#xD;
and distinctly threatening the murdered man.&#xD;
One remark'is qunotei: 'If I can only get hris&#xD;

GOING AND SON.&#xD;
&#xD;
brought up under the kind influences of home&#xD;
and friendship, nor had her dreary experience&#xD;
accustomed her to dependence upon compan-&#xD;
ions. What would have driven a creature of&#xD;
delicate mold to complete despair only inten-&#xD;
sified the bitterness of her fierce nature, steel-&#xD;
ed by the experiences of her hardening life.&#xD;
She resumed her way without an aim or set-&#xD;
tled plan, except a vague determination to be,&#xD;
henceforth. not a wretched creature of misery,&#xD;
but hardened, bold, shameless. The night,&#xD;
filled with the howls and shrieks and dismal&#xD;
moans of the gale, was not so dark, nor was&#xD;
the rage:of the elements so infuriated as the&#xD;
thoughts which chased every vestige of decen-&#xD;
cy from her heart. Suddenly, as she was men-&#xD;
tally surrendering body and soul to the fiend&#xD;
which seemed let loose upon the patient earth&#xD;
on this fearful night, while she was groping&#xD;
her way, she knew not whither and cared less,&#xD;
she felt that some one was behind her, and&#xD;
approaching rapidly. Frightened, she turned&#xD;
quickly, and just escaped a collision with a man&#xD;
who was hurrying along the road. Had the&#xD;
darkness trebled in intensity, and the rain-&#xD;
cloud madly flying along overhead shed a&#xD;
hundred drops for each one, had the deaf-&#xD;
ening, blinding, confusing hurricane, sum-&#xD;
moned a world of additional force, no fury of&#xD;
the elements could have hindered the in-&#xD;
stinctive recognition of those two as they now&#xD;
met.&#xD;
The wild shriek which rose to Simonetta's&#xD;
lips was instantaneously stifled by a sharp and&#xD;
cruel blow, and as a grip of iron closed on her&#xD;
throat, she heard a hissing voice she knew&#xD;
too well:-&#xD;
"Out with your dagger!   You or I, this&#xD;
time I"&#xD;
She had no weapon with her; but even if&#xD;
she had, she did not possess sufficient courage&#xD;
or presence of mind to use it. And as she&#xD;
felt herself growing giddy, the blood filling&#xD;
her head near to bursting, the voice of her heart&#xD;
cried to the Virgin for mercy and pity, and&#xD;
death stood before her dulling eyes, ready to&#xD;
grasp her in another instant.&#xD;
Whether reassured by her being unarmed,&#xD;
or whether some other impulse checked his&#xD;
fury, Stilletto suddenly relaxed  his hold,&#xD;
allowing her freedom enough to breathe, and&#xD;
then drew a dirk, forced its point with a know-&#xD;
ing thrust, just through her dress, until a ter-&#xD;
rified shriek announced that it pricked her&#xD;
breast, and said, quickly,-&#xD;
"I don't want to kill you.  I'll forgive you&#xD;
all if you'll swear to return to the countess&#xD;
immediately, and never tell that you saw me&#xD;
this day-never repeat what you know about&#xD;
John Van Str-"&#xD;
He paused, and, for a second, her intensified&#xD;
senses told her of a shuddering which seemed&#xD;
to run through him, and relax his hold on&#xD;
her throat so materially that she might have&#xD;
escaped, but that she was spellbound by&#xD;
terror.&#xD;
" About that will, Muller and I made out to-&#xD;
day," he continued, "or about any thing that&#xD;
has transpired to-day."&#xD;
" I promise-I promise I" she gasped. " Let&#xD;
me loose. God help me I'&#xD;
&#xD;
But the wily Italian was not to be pacified&#xD;
by a mere promise, and he continued,-&#xD;
"I want you to bind yourself by an oath&#xD;
which will send your soul to hell if you&#xD;
break it I"&#xD;
And in the midst of that terrible night, to&#xD;
the accompaniment of the moans of the wind&#xD;
which seemed to come from men in agony far,&#xD;
far away; in the midst of that night's unfath-&#xD;
omable darkness, Simonetta repeated after&#xD;
him words of such dreadful import as would&#xD;
seal the lips of a superstitious soul, close as&#xD;
the tomb. When the appalling formula of that&#xD;
oath had been spoken twice over by the half.&#xD;
crazed girl, Stilletto, feeling quite certain that&#xD;
she would never break it, just as she, in her&#xD;
Romish superstition, was certain in her own&#xD;
heart, that she never could break it without&#xD;
being struck dead to the ground, Stilletto,&#xD;
satisfied, released her, and said, more light-&#xD;
ly,-&#xD;
"I forgive you all the harm you have done&#xD;
me, Nettie, and if you want a friend, come to&#xD;
me ! So you will go straight off to the countess,&#xD;
and stay there, will you ?"&#xD;
"Yes, yes, I will."&#xD;
" Here is money to take you to New York."&#xD;
She took it. It seemed to burn her hands,&#xD;
and with a sharp cry she flung it from her.&#xD;
" What is the matter now " ho exclaimed,&#xD;
fiercely.&#xD;
" I don't know," replied the trembling girl.&#xD;
"It burned me! I am sure it burned me!&#xD;
Holy Virgin have pity on me I" and she burst&#xD;
into a fit of tears. lie, trembling violently him-&#xD;
self, tried to soothe her, but it was of no avail.&#xD;
She pushed him away, andcrying more bitterly,&#xD;
sank to the ground in a fit of hysterics. For&#xD;
a moment he stood irresolute ; perhaps he was&#xD;
moved, perhaps he would have liked to stay&#xD;
by her, perhaps he wanted such a friend as&#xD;
she might still prove; but stronger motives&#xD;
drove him onward."&#xD;
" She will keep her oath," he muttered.&#xD;
" and she is smart enough to take care of her-&#xD;
self any way. Farewell, remember what you&#xD;
have sworn to me," he cried aloud, and hurried&#xD;
on through the darkness, leaving her to the&#xD;
mercy of the elements, and also to the mercy&#xD;
of their Ruler. The soft moon broke through&#xD;
the clouds and looked down on her, just as a&#xD;
half hour previously she looked down upon&#xD;
another shape, not writhing like hers, but stilf&#xD;
and motionless, not half a mile distant. At&#xD;
this first sight the Queen of Heaven had veiled&#xD;
herself in horror, yielding the supremacy once&#xD;
more to the wild storm; but now she held her&#xD;
sway, and when Simonetta returned to con-&#xD;
sciousness the world lay bright before her,&#xD;
the skies were starry above, and she could&#xD;
look up for consolation and be answered by&#xD;
the rays of hope.&#xD;

But the grounds upon which Martin Bates&#xD;
brooded until he entertained terrible suspicions&#xD;
against his brother, were partly known to him-&#xD;
self alone. The whole of his knowledge and&#xD;
suspicions were as follows:-&#xD;
Josephine has told us that Ernest Montant&#xD;
was arrested on the charge of having mur-&#xD;
dered his friend, John Van Strom. Martin&#xD;
&#xD;
112&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb  n="-113" xml:id="VAC7268-00000058"/>&#xD;
Bates, from his acquaintance with both parties,&#xD;
was convinced that Stilletto was the guilty man,&#xD;
and nothing would have prevented him from&#xD;
putting his own worthless self into jeopardy,&#xD;
by making the accusation publicly, without&#xD;
out any evidence to sustain the charge, had he&#xD;
he not noticed a certain change in his brother.&#xD;
Eben was restless, nervous at times, confined to&#xD;
his room by illness. When the affidavits upon&#xD;
which Ernest Montant was arrested, reached&#xD;
the Judge's hands he showed them to Martin.&#xD;
With great care he dwelt upon the conclusive-&#xD;
ness of.the preliminary evidence, and although&#xD;
he paled visibly, when he read the Italian's&#xD;
testimony aloud to Martin, yet lie enlarged&#xD;
upon it with great legal precision, and tried to&#xD;
show his brother how it seemed impossible&#xD;
that Stilletto could have accomplished such&#xD;
an extensive and intricate statement had it&#xD;
been perjury.-&#xD;
" Where was Stilletto at the time of the&#xD;
murder?  Oh, I forgot he was here!"&#xD;
"Yes, at this house," answered Eben,&#xD;
quickly.&#xD;
" Strange that no one knew it," said&#xD;
Martin, with a thousand distracted emotions&#xD;
in his heart.&#xD;
"He was here. That is enough. I can&#xD;
testify to that, again in court," answered the&#xD;
judge, calmly, but paler still.&#xD;
Martin said no more, turning away to think,&#xD;
heaven knows what.&#xD;
The date of the trial of Ernest Montant, for&#xD;
the horrible crime ofmurder had now been fixed,&#xD;
and was not many days distant. Martin Bates&#xD;
became gloomier and sadder all the time,&#xD;
waiting for fate to prepare his last task on&#xD;
earth, the duty for which his life had been&#xD;
prolonged. The tragedy had made a terrible&#xD;
sensation. Not only the neighborhood, but&#xD;
the whole country was aroused, the detectives&#xD;
from the great cities were at work, the bar&#xD;
was in a flutter of expectation, and prominent&#xD;
among the attorneys who had been engaged,&#xD;
stood Mr. Paradise (who fortunately was a&#xD;
member of the Massachusetts bar) to conduct&#xD;
the defense of the accused. It was generally&#xD;
understood that the trial would go hard with&#xD;
the prisoner, but the activity of the detectives&#xD;
and the extensive employment of spies, private&#xD;
agents, and attorneys showed that some per.&#xD;
son of means and influence had befriended him.&#xD;
As to the prisoner, Montant, immediately&#xD;
after the murder, he had accused Stilletto&#xD;
of the deed. He swore he had recognized&#xD;
him--he described the dreadful occurrence&#xD;
with startling circumstantiality, and on his&#xD;
affidavit Stilletto was arrested. But by the&#xD;
testimony of Judge Eben Bates, who swore to&#xD;
Stiletto's presence at his house, before, during,&#xD;
and after the time when the murder must have&#xD;
been committed, an alibi was proved so clearly&#xD;
that he was immediately discharged. Then&#xD;
came Stilletto's affidavit regarding threats&#xD;
made by Montant, against John Van Strom's&#xD;
life, the circumstance of Montant's charge&#xD;
against Stilletto began to look as if he had&#xD;
desired to shut the latter's mouth by putting&#xD;
him in jeopardy, the undeniable fact that&#xD;
Montant was the only person known to have&#xD;
been present at the murder, and, finally, the&#xD;
8&#xD;
&#xD;
testimony concerning the dagger, with other&#xD;
circumstantial evidence, all combined with&#xD;
singular fallacy to make up the situation which&#xD;
had inspired Mr. Paradise with the most seri.&#xD;
ous apprehensions. As Martin Bates thought&#xD;
it all over, he trembled, not so much for the&#xD;
life of a man who had not shown himself to be&#xD;
a friend of his, as for the probable escape of&#xD;
the real criminal, who, he was positive, was&#xD;
Stilletto, in spite of his brother's oath, proving&#xD;
the alibi.&#xD;
" If that oath was false, Eben is accessory,"&#xD;
soliloquized Martin, and while he was tortur-&#xD;
ing himself about this question, he received the&#xD;
following letter, postmarked, New York, and&#xD;
written in Italian by the Countess, for Simon-&#xD;
etta herself was not mistress of the pen:&#xD;
"SIGNoR MARTIN BATES:-Will you be so&#xD;
kind as to favor me with a call on the day before&#xD;
the trial. Ask the countess, who is writing this&#xD;
for me, if I am within, and if she says yes, wait&#xD;
for me by the great stove in the dancing hail.&#xD;
I shall come there by eight o'clock in the even-&#xD;
ing. If I may be absolved from an awful oath&#xD;
I will show the world where a certain person&#xD;
was, at a certain time, and the lies that have&#xD;
been told will be blown to the four corners of&#xD;
the earth. If I can not be absolved from this&#xD;
oath, human kind shall no more know Simon-&#xD;
etta. Try not to seek me, keep the officers&#xD;
away from my path. At the first sign of pur-&#xD;
suit I will fly away beyond their reach, where&#xD;
I can spend the rest of my life in better ways.&#xD;
I know all the evidence that has appeared in&#xD;
the newspapers, and it is all false, but unless&#xD;
God commands me to break my oath I must&#xD;
let it stand. Remember that no friendship, no&#xD;
relationship should prevent bringing the real&#xD;
murderer to justice. Murder strikes at the&#xD;
core of life, whence friendship and love arise,&#xD;
and necessarily severs them.&#xD;
" SIMONETTA."&#xD;
After the two sleepless nights which fol-&#xD;
lowed the receipt of that letter, Martin put to&#xD;
his brother that dread question which heads&#xD;
this chapter.&#xD;
He had made up his mind to steal away from&#xD;
the house, the next morning before daybreak,&#xD;
go to New York and confer with Mr. Paradise&#xD;
or any other of the counsel for the defense, that&#xD;
he could readily find before going to see the&#xD;
Italian gill. As he was retiring to his room,&#xD;
his heart sank with the fear that he might not&#xD;
again see his brother until--He stopped at&#xD;
Eben's door. He heard his brother's voice low,&#xD;
moaning in agonized prayer. He opened the&#xD;
door noiselessly. There was the stately judge,&#xD;
a pitiable wreck of manhood, on his knees, in&#xD;
anguish, as if tortured by an accusing con-&#xD;
science.&#xD;
Martin laid his hand on his shoulder.&#xD;
"Brother, dear brother," burst from the old&#xD;
man, in faint accents, "tell me what is troub-&#xD;
ling you!1, I know your secret. I know Stil-&#xD;
letto is your son, and that it was he for whom&#xD;
I brought you the sacrifice of my honor. If&#xD;
he has forced you into denying your knowledge&#xD;
of his crime-if he hiss drawn you into-ger-&#xD;

the diabolical net of lies which has been spread&#xD;
for the life of an innocent man, throw yourself&#xD;
upon the mercy of man, law, and God, and&#xD;
confess."&#xD;
Taken unawares by the sudden interruption,&#xD;
Eben had needed time to recover himself.&#xD;
"Martin," he said, furious with shame and&#xD;
confusion, "you are no longer addressing your&#xD;
brother, but Judge Eben Bates."&#xD;
"Then I charge you, Judge Eben Bates,"&#xD;
cried Martin, with flashing eyes, "you, who&#xD;
have preserved your dignity by my crimes,&#xD;
you, who have purchased your honor with my&#xD;
shame, I ask you, in the name of the Judge&#xD;
whom no affidavits can pervert, I charge you&#xD;
on your immortal soul, in the name of truth,&#xD;
life, and death, by heaven and hell, and the&#xD;
eternal God, to tell me, Are you guilty 7"&#xD;
Judge Bates stood grandly towering. His&#xD;
face showed more of death than of life. Only&#xD;
one motion did he make, no syllable passed&#xD;
his firm-set lips. He pointed to the door. The&#xD;
majesty of innocence offended, or a giant at&#xD;
bay?&#xD;
Without another word, Martin retired to his&#xD;
own room. . "No friendship, no relationship,&#xD;
should prevent bringing the real murderer to&#xD;
justice," he quoted from Simonetta's letter, as,&#xD;
a few hours later, he quit the house, never to&#xD;
enter it again.&#xD;
CHAPTER III&#xD;
"LA PERFECT STRANGER."&#xD;
"When fortune in her shift and change of mood&#xD;
Spurns down her late beloved, all his dependents,&#xD;
Let him slip down.&#xD;
Not one accompanying his declining foot."  -&#xD;
TIMON oF ATHENs.&#xD;
THERE is an intoxication, an egotistical sat-&#xD;
isfaction, a luxury in the excess of grief. The&#xD;
condition of overwhelming frenzied suffering&#xD;
brings with it an elation, during which the&#xD;
strong man calls upon his manhood and his&#xD;
religion to bear him up, and his spirits revel&#xD;
in an intensity of feeling and a depth of&#xD;
thought which raise him into closer proximity&#xD;
to God.&#xD;
But when we have to face slow, lingering&#xD;
tortures; when we have to live through tribu-&#xD;
lations which do not engage our whole mind,&#xD;
but give us breathing spells of treacherous&#xD;
happiness, only to be succeeded again and&#xD;
again by lower descents; when these trials are&#xD;
of a nature to destroy pride, self-reliance, and&#xD;
strength of purpose; when we see those de-&#xD;
pending upon us, whom we love and cherish,&#xD;
and find ourselves powerless to help them,-&#xD;
then do we suffer a thousand pangs in one;&#xD;
then do our multiplied afflictions break down&#xD;
our strength and blight our life, and Hope and&#xD;
Faith die a lingering death. Such is the down-&#xD;
fall into poverty!/&#xD;
Do you see that old man, with but the rem-&#xD;
nants of grace and beauty, walking the streets&#xD;
of New York? lie has lost his wife in the&#xD;
prime of manhood, and his God helped him&#xD;
through that agony ; he has seen two children&#xD;
&#xD;
ND SON.&#xD;
&#xD;
die in his arms, and he recovered from the&#xD;
shock with unbroken faith ; he has known&#xD;
false friends, but his belief in human nature&#xD;
was not shaken. Now he is poor, and, in his&#xD;
old age, he has to taste the bitterest gall; he&#xD;
is poor, and now only does he hang his head&#xD;
and succumb to grief.&#xD;
Thus do we find old Mr. Going, his name&#xD;
still untarnished, though a thousand tongues&#xD;
heap suspicion on it, his credit not yet forfeit.&#xD;
ed, though virtually gone, his house, the good&#xD;
old house of Going &amp;amp; Son, still standing, but&#xD;
rotten and tottering, so that the whole cruel&#xD;
world can see its decay.. Thus he goes forth&#xD;
one morning, with a face where grief and&#xD;
shame have set their seal, with a step which&#xD;
nas become feeble and wavering, with a heart&#xD;
broken long, long ago-to borrow money!&#xD;
Yes, to borrow. Heaven knows what that&#xD;
word means to an honest man, when he no&#xD;
longer applies for an accommodation. or asks&#xD;
a favor, but has to beg it as a charity!&#xD;
He goes to seek Mr. Chip, " Old Moneybags,"&#xD;
as he was called by half New York. Oh ! the&#xD;
sigh which escaped the old man, as he entered&#xD;
the banking-house, with the clerks bustling&#xD;
about, and an intimation of wealth and solidity&#xD;
pervading the very air of the stately counting-&#xD;
room. It was so with him once !&#xD;
He asks for Mr. Chip, and, upon sending in&#xD;
his name, is informed that Mr. Chip is busy;&#xD;
but will see him in a few moments. He takes&#xD;
a chair and waits humbly.&#xD;
" He has dined at my table," soliloquized&#xD;
Mr. Going, "and, although with the exception&#xD;
of Hobgoblin, we have had no business transac-&#xD;
tions together, he can not refuse me."&#xD;
Finally, he was admitted to Mr. Chip, who&#xD;
received him with studied politeness, an ex.&#xD;
pression on his thin, fishy face the while&#xD;
which might have meant, "I would be de-&#xD;
lighted to see you, were I quite certain that&#xD;
you did not come for money."&#xD;
" Mr. Chip," said Mr. Going, in an unsteady&#xD;
voice, "I have come to ask you a question."&#xD;
" I am bus- that is, I am at your service,&#xD;
my dear sir," answered Mr. Chip, nervously;&#xD;
adding, with a sudden inspiration of decisive-&#xD;
ness, "I hope it is not about Hobgoblin! I&#xD;
have resigned my trusteeship in the com-&#xD;
pany, as you know very well, and I really&#xD;
must decline to enter into any conversation on&#xD;
that subject."&#xD;
"It is not Hobgoblin," said Mr. Going, qui-&#xD;
etly. Mr. Chip wheeled around on his chair,&#xD;
like a weathercock, and examined the ceiling&#xD;
as if he had never seen it before.&#xD;
"Well, what is it ?" he asked, growing fidg-&#xD;
etty.&#xD;
"Mr. Chip," said Mr. Going, trembling in&#xD;
every limb from timidity and humiliation; but&#xD;
proceeding, because he must, "you know that&#xD;
I have lost my fortune. Still, I am, I hope,&#xD;
not a bankrupt, and when I now ask you to&#xD;
kindly loan me a few thousand dollars, to make&#xD;
my family comfortable-to make my family&#xD;
comfortable," repeated the old gentleman, in a&#xD;
thick voice, "I can assure you that I will re-&#xD;
pay you, and I must also confess that I need&#xD;
this assistance very much-very much, in-&#xD;
deed."&#xD;

FORTUNE.&#xD;
&#xD;
The human race has produced brutes,-&#xD;
heartless, cruel, savage creatures,-but there&#xD;
are many hardened felons, who, had they pos-&#xD;
sessed the money, would have spoken cheer-&#xD;
ingly to Mr. Going and helped him willingly.&#xD;
Mr. Chip was reputed to be an accommoda-&#xD;
ting man, an easy-going, rather good-tempered&#xD;
fellow. Hear him answer:-&#xD;
"Mr. Going-ahem 1 I am sorry, very sorry&#xD;
for your difficulties-but why do you come to&#xD;
me for assistance ? To me, a perfect stranger ?&#xD;
A perfect stranger," he repeated, with empha-&#xD;
sis, so as to express, with all the refined&#xD;
cruelty of which this cold age is capable, that&#xD;
the world of selfishness, which is composed&#xD;
of wealth, had cast him out, that he was&#xD;
now an unknown, unpitied stranger, and that&#xD;
he was thrown to the mercy of God knows&#xD;
what!&#xD;
And yet, Mr. Chip was not a harsh man.&#xD;
The word stung Mr. Going to the quick. At&#xD;
first, an angry rejoinder rose to his lips; but&#xD;
the pain of the .rebuff, the cruel thrust at his&#xD;
noble heart, took the last remnant of strength&#xD;
from him. For a moment he thought of the&#xD;
bitter lesson he now, in his sixtieth year, had&#xD;
been taught ; he remembered how often this&#xD;
man, that called him stranger now, had en-&#xD;
joyed his hospitality, and he became proudly&#xD;
aware that the creature was not worthy a re-&#xD;
ply. With a cold " Good morning, sir," he&#xD;
moved to the door.&#xD;
"Wait a moment, Mr. Going," stammered&#xD;
Mr. Chip, seriously discomfited, "I did not&#xD;
mean to offend you, sir."&#xD;
" You did not offend me, sir," replied Mr.&#xD;
Going, with a bow.&#xD;
"But, just wait a moment," cried Mr. Chip,&#xD;
in some alarm. "If it must be done, we will&#xD;
try to arrange-only-you know-I am sorry&#xD;
that I myself can not-just now."&#xD;
" I believe that I did not ask you a second&#xD;
time. My first request you have answered&#xD;
with a single word. Good morning."&#xD;
He left Mr. Chip in as uneasy a frame of&#xD;
mind as possible from so trifling an occasion.&#xD;
The little millionaire had not intended to be&#xD;
harsh. His narrow views could not take in the&#xD;
misery which the mere uttering of the request&#xD;
caused the old gentleman, much less what had&#xD;
brought him to that necessity. Could he have&#xD;
correctly interpreted the expression in that&#xD;
plaintive bright eye, could he have understood&#xD;
the language of that haggard though still&#xD;
handsome countenance, had he reflected upon&#xD;
the sanctity of those silver locks, upon which&#xD;
the hand of Heaven was now so heavily laid,&#xD;
perhaps he would have acted differently;-&#xD;
and perhaps he would not.&#xD;
Mr. Chip had occasion to meet Mr. Paradise&#xD;
that day. The lawyer, whom  every one dis-&#xD;
liked, and who had wrung respect for his&#xD;
ability from the scoffing world by sheer power&#xD;
of intellect, was a liberal, off-hand man in&#xD;
money matters. Mr. Chip related to him the&#xD;
circumstance of Mr. Going's visit.&#xD;
"The old man never knew how to borrow,"&#xD;
said the hunchback, laughing, "and fortu-&#xD;
bately for him it was no great loss heretofore.&#xD;
I like people who do not know how to bor-&#xD;
row, and I have half a mind to go to the old&#xD;
&#xD;
115&#xD;
&#xD;
gentleman and help him out from sheer friend-&#xD;
ship."&#xD;
He was a man that might have assisted Mr.&#xD;
Going in the hour of his need-but then again&#xD;
he might have changed his mind, for money&#xD;
means treachery personified all through this&#xD;
world. And it happened that Mr. Going, sick at&#xD;
heart, did not renew his attempts to borrow;&#xD;
and it also happened that Mr. Paradise, al-&#xD;
though a liberal, off-hand man in money mat-&#xD;
ters, forgot all about his generous impulse, and&#xD;
did not assist his old client, from whom he had&#xD;
received a fortune in fees, and through whose&#xD;
patronage he had acquired a great portion of&#xD;
his practice and standing.&#xD;
When Mr. Going reached his office, he&#xD;
found Walter awaiting him anxiously. On this&#xD;
paltry sum of a few thousand dollars, de-&#xD;
pended a world of vital issues, embodying the&#xD;
safety, comfort, and serenity of the family.&#xD;
When, a man is harassed for money, he is in&#xD;
no condition to grapple with other questions,&#xD;
even though vital to his future welfare. One&#xD;
look at his father, showed Walter, only too&#xD;
plainly, that another effort had failed, that an-&#xD;
other humiliation had been undergone, and&#xD;
that another day had been sadly inaugurated&#xD;
fmr them. Without asking a question, or sub-&#xD;
jecting his father to the additional sorrow and&#xD;
vexation of discussing what had happened,&#xD;
Walter put on his hat, and with a defiant swag-&#xD;
ger, left the counting-room. In an hour he&#xD;
returned with so much money as was actually&#xD;
needed; but how he had obtained it, what des-&#xD;
perate efforts had been required to wring the&#xD;
small sum from the merciless multitude of&#xD;
friends, that were friends no longer, how&#xD;
much  sacrifice of pride it had cost, and&#xD;
how he had been obliged to screw his courage&#xD;
to that unnatural sticking-point, vulgarly called&#xD;
" brass," no one ever could learn from him.&#xD;
When Walter Going left the office to saunter&#xD;
up town, he met Mr. Solomong at the corner&#xD;
of the street. TheJew looked as brightly pol-&#xD;
ished as ever, but his diamond buttons, his&#xD;
watch and chain had disappeared.&#xD;
"Solomons, what is the matter with you?&#xD;
Where are your diamonds and your watch,&#xD;
hey ?"&#xD;
The sad face of the stockbroker and auc-&#xD;
tioneer gave sufficient answer.  His salloyw&#xD;
countenance was drawn to that length and&#xD;
had assumed that expression which ir human&#xD;
physiognomy denotes extreme depression.&#xD;
Walter had not seen him for some weeks,&#xD;
having been so entirely occupied with his own&#xD;
troubles that the doings of others necessarily&#xD;
escaped his attention. Therefore he had not&#xD;
known that Mr. Solomons had lost all his&#xD;
money, and indeed many times more than he&#xD;
had ever possessed,&#xD;
" Mr. Going, sir," said Mr. Solomons, "I am&#xD;
ruined. I was an ass. I did not stick to my&#xD;
regular business, went speculating again, ay&#xD;
vollaw law raysoultaw I"&#xD;
With a smile at the Israelitic French, Wal-&#xD;
ter said,-&#xD;
"Why don't you end your sentences with&#xD;
Cash any more, Solomons ?"&#xD;
" The day of cash is done," answered Solo-&#xD;
mons, dolefully. " Cash is dead, it has taken&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb  n="116" xml:id="VAC7268-00000061"/>&#xD;
GOING AND SON.&#xD;
&#xD;
wings and fled. My diamonds and watch are&#xD;
learning Hebrew."&#xD;
"Doing what ?"&#xD;
"Learning Hebrew at the house of an&#xD;
esteemed countryman of mine. I mean that&#xD;
they are pawned."&#xD;
" Well, let them rest," said Walter, laughing.&#xD;
"We are well met; being both poor, we are&#xD;
good company, and I propose that we walk up&#xD;
town together. You see the great thing is&#xD;
that neither of us will be afraid that the otlier&#xD;
will borrow money from him ! How delight-&#xD;
ful, and how much more comfortable that is&#xD;
than when a rich man and a beggar meet I"&#xD;
Mr. Solomons explained that he was com-&#xD;
pletely ruined, and absolutely without credit&#xD;
at any shop, hotel, or restaurant. He lived&#xD;
" by the grace of God," as he said, but how he&#xD;
managed to keep from utter destitution, he&#xD;
was no more able to relate than any student&#xD;
of social science can account for the existence&#xD;
of thousands like him.&#xD;
As they walked up town, Walter realized,&#xD;
with a disagreeable sensation, that his situa-&#xD;
tion was more analogous to that of Mr. Solo-&#xD;
mons than he would have desired.&#xD;
" Let us cross over the street," said the Jew,&#xD;
when they had got pretty well up Broad-&#xD;
way.&#xD;
" Why?" asked Walter, following him.&#xD;
" My tailor lives hard by," answered the&#xD;
other, "and I have secret reasons which impel&#xD;
me to avoid his door."&#xD;
Solomons laughed, but Walter did not.&#xD;
" My tailor lives right here," he said, "but I&#xD;
have not gone so far quite yet, as to be afraid&#xD;
of him."&#xD;
" Do you owe him a bill ?"&#xD;
"Yes, what of that ?"&#xD;
" How long has it run?"&#xD;
"About a year."&#xD;
"Do you expect to be able to pay him in&#xD;
the course of this year?"&#xD;
Walter bit his lips. "I hope so," he an-&#xD;
swered.&#xD;
" Well, so did I hope, a year ago," rejoined&#xD;
the Jew, dryly. "But my hopes proved vain,&#xD;
and let me tell you my proud friend that if&#xD;
you do not pay him, you will shun your tailor's&#xD;
door next year, as I do mine to-day."&#xD;
Walter would have been angry, but he had&#xD;
not the heart to take offense at this shrewd&#xD;
and unanswerable piece of philosophy.&#xD;
" Let's take a glass of wine, Solomons, and&#xD;
drop the subject," he said, sharply.&#xD;
" With pleasure," answered Mr. Solomons.&#xD;
"But not in there," he added, pulling his&#xD;
friend away from a door he was on the point&#xD;
of opening. "I owe that fellow money, and&#xD;
don't want to be seen."&#xD;
"Solomons," cried Walter, "It is not respect-&#xD;
able to be in debt all over town."&#xD;
"Is it respectable to be hungry and thirsty,&#xD;
and see your clothes wear to threads? I tell&#xD;
you, sir, this town owes me a living. I have&#xD;
spent thousands with these traders, and they&#xD;
can afford to trust me a few hundred for a&#xD;
year or two."&#xD;
" Thea why don't you tell them so, and keep&#xD;
out of the disgraceful position of shunning&#xD;
them."&#xD;
&#xD;
"Because they would not trust me ai all&#xD;
if I explained to them. Tradespeople are a&#xD;
mysterious set of characters. They form a&#xD;
study for a man, and he must know how&#xD;
to handle them."&#xD;
"God keep me from that science !" cried&#xD;
Walter.&#xD;
" That science has kept me alive," answered&#xD;
the Jew, quietly; "and live I must and shall,&#xD;
in spite of all your high moral ideas! Be.&#xD;
sides, I do nothing dishonest,. I mean to pay&#xD;
them some day. The worst of it is that I can.&#xD;
not economize ! I can get a Delmonico dinner&#xD;
and a bottle of claret on trust; but if I stopped&#xD;
in a Bowery cellar and begged for a bit of&#xD;
bread and cheese, they would kick me out.&#xD;
By the way, I want to go in here to buy a&#xD;
cravat."&#xD;
"Never mind," said Walter, "I have no&#xD;
time; it is late."&#xD;
"Is that the only reason ?" asked the Jew,&#xD;
scrutinizing his face.&#xD;
"1 None of your business," answered Walter,&#xD;
angrily. "If you are so anxious, let us go&#xD;
They entered the gentlemen's furnishing&#xD;
store. One of the proprietors of the estab-&#xD;
lishment immediately stepped up to Mr.&#xD;
Going, and, rubbing his hands, said, what a.&#xD;
fine day it was, and inquired why he had been&#xD;
such a stranger of late.&#xD;
Walter, under the continued observation of&#xD;
Mr. Solomons, turned red, and after displaying&#xD;
considerable of nervousness, said, with an&#xD;
effort,-&#xD;
"Muggins, I owe you a bill. Let me know&#xD;
how much it is, and I will write you a check."&#xD;
Mr. Muggins, all smiles and   politeness,&#xD;
brought forth his account, and the check was&#xD;
given.&#xD;
"Aha !" said the Jew, when they had re-&#xD;
gained the street. "So I was right in suspect-&#xD;
ing a reason for your unwillingness to enter&#xD;
that shop! But what a lucky man you are to&#xD;
be able to write him a check !"&#xD;
" Solomons," said Walter, gloomily, "I will&#xD;
confess to you that my cheek is not good until&#xD;
we make it so, by a deposit to-morrow."&#xD;
" Then you were a fool to give it. The idea&#xD;
of allowing a fellow like that to put you to&#xD;
such inconvenience, or even danger of con-&#xD;
siderable annoyance !"&#xD;
" The bank will pay it, of course, good or&#xD;
not," answered Walter; vexed with himself,&#xD;
and all the world. "But you are right ; I&#xD;
should not have given it."&#xD;
" Cheer up, my dear fellow," said Mr. Solo-&#xD;
mons, soothingly, "I am a thousand times-&#xD;
worse off than you; but that does not change&#xD;
one fact, which, with your permission, I will&#xD;
state frankly. You are on that sort of a road&#xD;
to poverty where nothing but a large amount&#xD;
of ready money can save you."&#xD;
Walter thought of those words long after&#xD;
they were spoken, and with a heavy heart was&#xD;
forced to admit their truth. A few months&#xD;
longer of this state of affairs would reduce him&#xD;
to Mr. Solomons' - level, and that was not&#xD;
respectability.&#xD;

Avenue; but it appeared to them as if they&#xD;
enjoyed the fine residence only as tenants,&#xD;
simply tolerated out of charity by those who&#xD;
owned the heavy mortgages which had long&#xD;
ago been given upon it.&#xD;
She received them with a smile,-a smile&#xD;
that was born from a day of tears-a smile so&#xD;
forced and unnatural that it was not recipro-&#xD;
cated by her father. The old gentleman had&#xD;
not laughed for months. His whole face was&#xD;
changed, she thought, and she felt as if she&#xD;
would have given all she possessed in the&#xD;
world to see once more a happy smile upon it.&#xD;
No more friends at that hospitable board.&#xD;
JTo more cheerfulness in that house. Thus&#xD;
they had lived through the heavy days, in&#xD;
gloom, anxiety, and misery, and for what was&#xD;
it all ? Was there any visible cause ? Surely,&#xD;
the poor work-people, who daily passed the&#xD;
house, did not dream of this, yet the curse of&#xD;
poverty was upon them; and its fangs are&#xD;
keenest where least apparent.&#xD;
"Jessie," said Mr. Going, when dinner had&#xD;
been removed, and Walter had strolled out,&#xD;
"I hear that Paradise is engaged for the de-&#xD;
fence of Ernest Montant. I hope and trust&#xD;
that he will procure his acquittal. I can not&#xD;
imagine that he is guilty."&#xD;
"I know he is not," answered she, brightly&#xD;
and cheerfully.&#xD;
Her father, astonished at her tone, looked at&#xD;
her closely. Our hero's name had not been&#xD;
mentioned between them since that day he had&#xD;
left the house, after making his last appeal to&#xD;
Mr. Going, when the father had read in his&#xD;
daughter's face the story of her love and&#xD;
struggle. Like a wise man, he had determined&#xD;
to let her fight alone, where no help could avail,&#xD;
and, until this instance, Montant's name had&#xD;
remained unspoken by mutual consent. He&#xD;
was, therefore, astonished at her open and&#xD;
hearty answer, which, although so confident,&#xD;
of the prisoner's innocence, yet showed none&#xD;
of that confusion he had feared would over-&#xD;
come her.. He, however, continued without&#xD;
betraying his astonishment,-&#xD;
"I most certainly agree with you, and I am&#xD;
glad you think so well of him."&#xD;
"He is a good, fine fellow," answered Miss&#xD;
Jessie, unhesitatingly. "And I like him as a&#xD;
brother. I suppose there is no doubt about&#xD;
his engagement to Josephine Van Strom ?"&#xD;
" I think not. It was she that employed&#xD;
Mr. Paradise. Jessie," continued the old gen-&#xD;
tleman, drawing nearer to her, "do not think&#xD;
that I am desirous of forcing myself into such&#xD;
of your confidences as even a father can not&#xD;
share. But I must confess my astonishment&#xD;
that you can speak with such nonchalance of&#xD;
these things, and-&#xD;
"I know what you mean," she answered,&#xD;
with a smile. "I had a foolish fancy once;&#xD;
but the great cares and great anxieties be-&#xD;
longing to the practical, have quite satisfied&#xD;
my ideal requirements."&#xD;
Mr. Going kissed his daughter, and he&#xD;
sighed, though he was glad to hear it.&#xD;
"Do not despair, father," said Jessie, lov-&#xD;
ingly. "If my plans of a cottage in the&#xD;
Country, and a total change in our manner of&#xD;
tife, are carried out, all will be well. As for&#xD;
&#xD;
me, do not believe that an evanescent attach-&#xD;
ment can make me unhappy any more. I&#xD;
only hope and pray to see you free from care,&#xD;
and as for our friend, I am certain he will not&#xD;
suffer for a crime of which he is innocent. I&#xD;
can pray for his welfare, for he is true and&#xD;
noble-but nothing more to me.&#xD;
CHAPTER IV.&#xD;
STRANGE cONvERsATIONs.&#xD;
" How much had I to do to calm his rage 1&#xD;
Now fear I this will give it start again."&#xD;
HAMLET.&#xD;
BELLA VAN STROM'S grief was terrible.&#xD;
It never gave her a moment's respite. She&#xD;
paced up and down the piazza of her dwelling&#xD;
while the snow and the thaw rendered the&#xD;
garden paths unpleasant, for she could not&#xD;
endure the idea of sitting down quietly in the&#xD;
house. She watched the sun as it sunk into&#xD;
the embrace of the gilded hills, and light-&#xD;
ed up the winter landscape with dazzling splen-&#xD;
dor. To her the world was empty. She had&#xD;
withdrawn within herself, and had dropped a&#xD;
black veil between herself and the " outer&#xD;
world.&#xD;
Well might that world envy her and won-&#xD;
der at her "luck." She had married an idiot&#xD;
for his money-the idiot was dead, and the&#xD;
money her's. All the pleasures of the earth&#xD;
lay before her, with plenty of good, handsome,&#xD;
well-bred fellows, apt to like her well enough&#xD;
and her fortune better. And yet her grief&#xD;
was terrible !&#xD;
She had learned to love that idiot before he&#xD;
died.&#xD;
Bella is walking up and down the piazza,&#xD;
heedless of the wind which is beginning to&#xD;
blow sharp and cold ~ as evening shadows&#xD;
stretch over the country. A carriage drives&#xD;
through the gate up to the house. A lady in&#xD;
black alights and runs up to Bella.  She&#xD;
throws back her veil and kisses her; Bella re-&#xD;
turns the kiss affectionately, but without&#xD;
enthusiasm. Josephine's nature demands en-&#xD;
thusiasm, requires warm impulses. The hasty,&#xD;
joyous words which trembled on her lips, die&#xD;
away and she recoils a step:-&#xD;
Josephine (half-timidly, half-angrily). " Par-&#xD;
don me, I forgot that we are sisters no&#xD;
longer."&#xD;
Bella (quietly). "We are sisters in law,&#xD;
Josephine, and sisters in affection as well. I&#xD;
never gave you reason to doubt it."&#xD;
Josephine. " Where there is a change in&#xD;
manner, there must be a change in the sen-&#xD;
timents which dictate that manner 1  Ever&#xD;
since that awful visitation of God's wrath&#xD;
which widowed you, and desolated my life,&#xD;
you have treated me like a stranger."&#xD;
Bella. "No. But I feel as if we two should&#xD;
let Time and Truth do their work before we&#xD;
force each other to profess a contentment and&#xD;
pleasure in each other's society which can not&#xD;
really exist until the shadow which stands be-&#xD;
tween us now is removed."&#xD;
Josephine. " And what have you done to&#xD;

remove it? -Have you taken that interest,&#xD;
have you shown that anxiety, have you acted&#xD;
with that sisterly love which you have just&#xD;
professed?"&#xD;
Bella (calmly). " I have done my duty. As&#xD;
your fortune is not yet available to you, I&#xD;
have, by my own free will, out of my private&#xD;
purse, supplied you with the means of procur-&#xD;
ing for your lover the best defense in the&#xD;
country."       -&#xD;
Josephine. " And have you given me your&#xD;
advice-have you stood by me, that am so&#xD;
weak, with your strength and power of mind&#xD;
and will?  Oh, it is cruel to find that when&#xD;
you most need them, your best, your only&#xD;
friends grow cold as ice I"&#xD;
Bella. Josephine, I love justice well enough&#xD;
to see justice, and nothing but justice, done. I&#xD;
have love for nothing else until time and na-&#xD;
ture restore me to a semblance of my former&#xD;
self."&#xD;
Josephine. "You suspect him of being guil-&#xD;
ty?"&#xD;
Bella. "I suspect the whole world and yet&#xD;
suspect no one. I-have aid for the accused,&#xD;
that his cause may be so protected as to in-&#xD;
sure impartial justice. I have zeal to assist&#xD;
the law in all its just prosecution ; but I have&#xD;
pity for no one until his innocence becomes as&#xD;
clear as that sun now saying good-night to&#xD;
us."&#xD;
Josephine. " Oh, how hard it is for a woman&#xD;
to be alone."&#xD;
Bella. "I am alone-forever /"&#xD;
Josephine. " And is this the sisterhood to&#xD;
which we are pledged by our holiest resolves?&#xD;
Do not our destiny, the name we bear in com-&#xD;
mon, the sympathies which have interwoven&#xD;
our very souls, teach us to seek comfort in&#xD;
each other, to bear up and strengthen each&#xD;
other now that we stand apart from the whole&#xD;
world ?"&#xD;
Bella. " My grief is selfish. It will endure&#xD;
no helpmate. I have to fight a sacred battle,&#xD;
and no human eye may profane it by any in-&#xD;
trusion."&#xD;
Josephine. "Did I so spurn you from me&#xD;
when you came to me at the Priory a frighten-&#xD;
ed, miserable being, not knowing where to&#xD;
turn for a word of encouragement, a ray of&#xD;
sympathy, a look of love! Oh, I see that I&#xD;
was mistaken when I said to myself, 'Poor&#xD;
John's intuition has got him a nobler wife&#xD;
than all the wisdom of the wise could have&#xD;
selected for him. Really, we know the human&#xD;
heart only when the hour of trial brings it out&#xD;
in its true light I"&#xD;
Bella. "What would you have me do?&#xD;
Condole with you, before I can know that a&#xD;
heavier blow is not in store for you ? 1 will&#xD;
save my consolations till then. Do you ex-&#xD;
pect me to speak sisterly words to you while&#xD;
a specter stands between us, whose ghastly&#xD;
wounds cry to Heaven for retribution? Do&#xD;
you think I can weep for you, while my own&#xD;
tears are petrified, making my heart cold and&#xD;
heavy as lead? I have not yet shed a tear for&#xD;
my own loss.  When I see the guilty man&#xD;
brought to justice, I shall be clear in my con-&#xD;
science, and then, perhaps, God, in mercy, will&#xD;
vouchsafe me tears."&#xD;
&#xD;
Josephine. "You wrong yourself-you wrong&#xD;
him, me, cruelly; oh, how cruelly!"&#xD;
Bella. "I wrong no one. I am ice-bound in&#xD;
a remorseless mission of duty. That will I&#xD;
fulfill, though each unrelenting step should&#xD;
crush a world. I feel as if that alone could&#xD;
give me peace ; I feel as if that alone could&#xD;
restore me to the favor of heaven, from which&#xD;
I am now shut out. That accomplished, I&#xD;
feel that I could be a woman once more and&#xD;
weep, while now I am but a cold, dead instru-&#xD;
ment, animated by the god of vengeance to&#xD;
fulfill his purpose."&#xD;
Josephine. " This language is unwomanly,&#xD;
unchristian, ungodly, and unworthy of your&#xD;
better self."&#xD;
Bella. "Yet so you find me now. Come into&#xD;
the house. Although I can not keep you com-&#xD;
pany, you will find hospitality. I have no&#xD;
merit in that ; the house belongs half to you,&#xD;
half to me. Through my instrumentality you&#xD;
have recovered the one-half of the Van Strom&#xD;
fortune which belongs to'you. In this I have&#xD;
done my duty, and claim no praise for it.&#xD;
Only when I continue henceforward to do my&#xD;
duty, I will not be upbraided."&#xD;
Josephine. "Bella, God help you and me!&#xD;
What do your words mean ? Do you-can&#xD;
you suspect me ?"&#xD;
Josephine, utterly unstrung, burst into a&#xD;
passionate fit of crying.&#xD;
Bella, with a look of amazement, said,-&#xD;
"This, at least, I was not prepared for!&#xD;
Fool that I am, how have I conveyed such a&#xD;
meaning?"&#xD;
She assisted Josephine into the house, and&#xD;
reassured her, when the latter had become&#xD;
somewhat calm.&#xD;
"I call Heaven to witness that the faintest&#xD;
idea of such a cruel wrong was furthest from&#xD;
my mind. Compose yourself on this point any&#xD;
way, and rest assured that I will help you as&#xD;
I did before, though I can not counsel you.&#xD;
God grant that the day may soon come, when&#xD;
I shall be able to make atonement for my&#xD;
harshness to you, but I can not do so now-not&#xD;
now. There is nothing in my heart that&#xD;
speaks against you-no, indeed! But I am&#xD;
become a stone and I can not speak even to&#xD;
you as I should. So let time develop the&#xD;
change I know must come over me, living or&#xD;
dying, and till then bear with me, and hope&#xD;
that you will regain your loving sister ere long.&#xD;
Good night."&#xD;
She kissed the weeping woman and disap-&#xD;
peared.&#xD;
Josephine, though somewhat comforted,&#xD;
spent many hours of sleepless sorrow, be-&#xD;
wailing the awful phase her sister's grief had&#xD;
assumed, but her thoughts would still turn&#xD;
back to her lover and to the grave doubts Mr.&#xD;
Paradise continued to express. So near the&#xD;
trial, so very near-only a few days !&#xD;
And now we will leave her and listen to&#xD;
what two gentlemen have to say, who are&#xD;
troubled almost as much as she, though from&#xD;
slightly different causes.&#xD;
We left our highly philosophic friend, Mr.&#xD;
Muller, waiting for his friend Antonio Stilletto.&#xD;
He could wait ; he knew how to wait, which&#xD;
is a great science. He had plenty of beer and&#xD;

FORT&#xD;
tobacco, and the flight of time was to him only&#xD;
the source of a majestic contentment as he&#xD;
smoked his pipe and drank his beer.&#xD;
But when noon had faded away into eve-&#xD;
ning, when night put in her black appearance,&#xD;
accompanied by such a tempest as threatened&#xD;
to disturb the balance of this mundane sphere,&#xD;
and, finally, when the beer and the pipe, those&#xD;
two mainstays of true philosophy, began to pall&#xD;
upon the palate, and taste bitter from unlimited&#xD;
abuse, then did the philosopher almost lose his&#xD;
serenity; he began to wish that Stilletto had&#xD;
kept his marching orders in his pocket, and,&#xD;
to his shame be it. confessed, swore great&#xD;
polysyllablic oaths, in German, at the Italian.&#xD;
When finally a ring at the door, sounded&#xD;
clear and startling, and when Stilletto made&#xD;
his appearance, dripping wet, shivering and&#xD;
shaking with extraordinary excitement and a&#xD;
sort of wild look in his eye, Mr. Muller felt a&#xD;
vague instinct of repugnance, and wished, as we&#xD;
often do in life, that the person whose advent&#xD;
was so much desired had staid away indefinitely.&#xD;
Muller. " Where have you been ?" ,&#xD;
Stilletto. "I was at Judge Bates's from three&#xD;
o'clock till now. Just come from there. What&#xD;
is the exact time ?"&#xD;
Muller. " Nine o'clock."&#xD;
"From three till nine, from three till nine,"&#xD;
repeated Stilletto, mechanically, and finding&#xD;
It a difficult and thankless task to start any&#xD;
further conversation, the two friends went to&#xD;
bed in the worst possible humor. Muller was&#xD;
too lofty to ask why he had been kept waiting,&#xD;
all ready to start at a moment's notice, and felt&#xD;
injured at Stilletto's silence on that subject,&#xD;
while the cunning Italian was afraid to say any&#xD;
thing near the truth, for fear of betraying his&#xD;
night's work.&#xD;
We find them again, some time after the&#xD;
murder, and after Stilletto had been arrested&#xD;
and released upon proving an alibi by Judge&#xD;
Bates's testimony.&#xD;
The philosopher was enjoying the solitude&#xD;
of his room and the anticipation of the glori-&#xD;
ous success of their scheme, which would come&#xD;
to light as soon as John Van Strom's will&#xD;
should be admitted to probate, when Stilletto&#xD;
burst violently into the room and seriously dis-&#xD;
turbed his equanimity, by conduct worthy of&#xD;
an escaped bedlamite, while he explained in&#xD;
accents hardly intelligible, from excitement)&#xD;
and oaths in all languages, that John's will had&#xD;
been opened, and that it utterly demolished and&#xD;
ruined all their fond hopes, and further, that&#xD;
the will which they had so cunningly got out&#xD;
of him was canceled, revoked, and made worth-&#xD;
less, in the most positive legal language that&#xD;
could be employed, and all this by a will made&#xD;
in the village on the afternoon of the day of&#xD;
his murder. A will which complied with the&#xD;
)minutest requirements of the law, without a&#xD;
ghost of a chance for them if they undertook&#xD;
to dispute it,.&#xD;
. Muller (dejectedly). " The great boss devil&#xD;
18against us."      '        .&#xD;
Stiletto (almost foaming at the mouth). "Non-&#xD;
Sense! I know who is at the bottom of it all.&#xD;
Those two women worked upon the idiot and&#xD;
hie confessed to them, the cursed fool, what I&#xD;
was moving heaven and earth to keep from&#xD;
&#xD;
rUNE.&#xD;
&#xD;
119&#xD;
&#xD;
their ears until I had--" Here he stopped&#xD;
short, and, growing pale, scrutinized the phi-&#xD;
losopher's countenance, as if anxious to see&#xD;
whether he showed any suspicions of what he&#xD;
was about to confess in the madness of his&#xD;
temper. But Mr. Muller was simply paralyzed&#xD;
and livid from this most unlooked-for news.&#xD;
He could not speak, but sat as if a thunder-&#xD;
bolt had descended upon him on a clear, sunny&#xD;
day.&#xD;
Stiletto (pacing the room). " But there is&#xD;
money enough yet in the country for a smart&#xD;
man, and, although we can not now hope to&#xD;
control millions, I mean to get enough though&#xD;
I have to tear it from the jaws of hell I Re-&#xD;
venge is the word! One of the dirty wenches&#xD;
is a widow already, the other shall see her&#xD;
lover hanged, unless Antonio Stilletto becomes&#xD;
crazy over night !"&#xD;
Muller (in utter despair). "Thus does Desti-&#xD;
ny bring us within sight of the goal, thus she&#xD;
dazzles our eyes and captivates our souls with&#xD;
a foretaste of what we covet, only to snatch&#xD;
it from us at the eleventh hour. I shall go&#xD;
teaching school !"&#xD;
Stilletto (sneeringly). "With your sentiments&#xD;
I'd turn priest."&#xD;
Muller. "No, no! I can train the young and&#xD;
budding mind and rear a full glorious plant of&#xD;
human intellect.  I can humble myself and&#xD;
starve for that purpose; but I Can not serve&#xD;
in the ranks of bigotry or hypocrisy. Reason&#xD;
is my god and I am her priest. Take a note&#xD;
of it, young man,-thus- speaks August Mul-&#xD;
ler."&#xD;
Stilletto. " Thus speaks an ass,.who has done&#xD;
me more harm than good all the time I have&#xD;
known him."&#xD;
Muller. "Young man, your intellect is but&#xD;
a small degree above that of the brute, and&#xD;
your impulses are on a level with your intel-&#xD;
lect! Do not make yourself ridiculous or pro-&#xD;
voke my just wrath by such foul language !"&#xD;
Stilletto. " Go to hell!"&#xD;
Muller (pale with rage). " I wish I never had&#xD;
met you, you villainous, mongrel dog! Another&#xD;
word, and I will proclaim to the world what I&#xD;
know of you."&#xD;
Stilletto hesitated a moment. There was a&#xD;
dangerous flash in his treacherous eye; lie&#xD;
made a movement toward Muller, so threaten-&#xD;
ing, that the latter recoiled in terror, but sud-&#xD;
denly checking himself, he remembered that if&#xD;
his relationship to Judge Bates should come&#xD;
out, his father might, in a moment of despair,&#xD;
say some thing about that alibi, which would&#xD;
be very undesirable. True, it is not pleasant&#xD;
to confess the crime of perjury, but when a&#xD;
man is once thoroughly disgraced, he generally&#xD;
unburdens his whole conscience to make a&#xD;
clear breast of it.&#xD;
Stilletto (coldly). "Neither you nor I can af-&#xD;
ford to quarrel, so stop your nonsense. I have&#xD;
nothing against you; but your senseless chat-&#xD;
ter about philosophy vexes mg at times. Let&#xD;
us consult about the next thing to be done."&#xD;
Muller. "August Muller is easily won over,&#xD;
especially by a friend. Let us pledge this new&#xD;
alliance in a bumper of malt."&#xD;
SStiletto. " Well, take it down until you burst&#xD;
your-self, if you want to: but excuse me."&#xD;

GOING AND SON.&#xD;
&#xD;
Muller. " To-day I was subpoenaed for the&#xD;
trial as. a witness, and I don't regret it. I like&#xD;
to talk in public, for a man of superior mind&#xD;
should not always remain unnoticed. In my&#xD;
testimony, sir, I mean to argue-"&#xD;
Stilletto (interrupting). "I tell you what&#xD;
you'd better do. Make up your mind to say&#xD;
as little as possible-only 'yes' or 'no,' when&#xD;
they will be sufficient. Paradise is engaged&#xD;
for the defense, and if you give him a chance,&#xD;
by talking too much, he will make you say&#xD;
things that will astonish you when you see&#xD;
them on paper afterward, and hear what a&#xD;
nice thing he will make out of them in his&#xD;
pleading. No, no! The great point is, that&#xD;
you and I must not contradict each other, and&#xD;
to prevent that, we must talk it all over be-&#xD;
tween ourselves."&#xD;
Muller. " But the truth needs no prepara-&#xD;
tion before it is given in evidence."&#xD;
Stiletto. "I say it does."&#xD;
Muller (thoughtfully). "My friend, do you&#xD;
really think that this countryman of mine, this&#xD;
lad whom I once came near taking to my bo-&#xD;
som as a friend, this intelligent, well-born, and&#xD;
educated person, whom August Muller, yes,&#xD;
sir, August Muller received at his house?"-&#xD;
do you-can you think that he is really&#xD;
guilty?"&#xD;
Stiletto. "We will. see at the trial whether&#xD;
he is or not. I hope he'll be hanged, that's&#xD;
all."&#xD;
Muller. "I hope not, if he is innocent."&#xD;
Stilletto. "You have promised me my re-&#xD;
venge upon him, remember. Now that I have&#xD;
a chance, I mean to improve it."&#xD;
Muller. " Do not speak thus. The utterance&#xD;
of such sentiments is an ill omen."&#xD;
Stilletto, (turning pale). "Do you believe in&#xD;
omens ?"&#xD;
Muller. "Yes, sir, for philosophy teaches us&#xD;
that there is a mysterious connection between&#xD;
the past, present, and future, and that great&#xD;
events are often foreshadowed in a hundred&#xD;
trifling occurrences."&#xD;
Stilletto. "And do you believe in dreams,&#xD;
too?"&#xD;
Muller. "Yes, sir. Sleep presents two as-&#xD;
pects. One is the near approach to death&#xD;
when the mind slumbers with the body; in the&#xD;
other, the mind freed from the grossness of&#xD;
the body, becomes etherealized, and travels&#xD;
through the land of spirits, accomplishing&#xD;
mysterious wonders. Spiritualism, my friend,&#xD;
will grow into a great science, just as astrol-&#xD;
ogy was the mother of astronomy, and alchemy&#xD;
the predecessor of chemistry."&#xD;
Stilletto. " You always have your mouth full&#xD;
of big words, but their meaning is either hack-&#xD;
neyed or utterly absurd."&#xD;
Muller. "I tell you dreams have a relation&#xD;
to the past and future."&#xD;
Stilletto. "I don't care if they have. If I&#xD;
believed in them, I should be scared out of my&#xD;
wits, for I have had vile ones lately."&#xD;
Muller. " Who do you think can be the real&#xD;
murderer ?"&#xD;
Stiletto (jumping up). "What do you mean&#xD;
by asking me such a question? If you dare&#xD;
suspect-Well, well, Muller, don't mind me,&#xD;
I am going to New York to-morrow to see the&#xD;
&#xD;
countess, and will not be back until the day   A&#xD;
of the trial."                                 en&#xD;
The philosopher was delighted to hear it,    si&#xD;
for in truth Stilletto frightened him terribly. O&#xD;
Stilletto. "By the way, do you know that     aE&#xD;
Stump is in this part of the country. I have&#xD;
seen him several times. He tells me that he    ti&#xD;
has made lots of money, and from an old liking fC&#xD;
for the business, he has just taken a look into ci&#xD;
this murder affair. He has some relatives here a&#xD;
whom he is visiting. If I had not seed them    el&#xD;
myself, personally, I should be almost- afraid w&#xD;
that he was hired by the defense to--to-.."    w&#xD;
Muller. " To what? Why should you be&#xD;
afraid?  Now that I think of it, he has been   N&#xD;
here twice during your absence, and I had a    ti&#xD;
long talk-"                                     g&#xD;
Stilletto (frenzied with rage). " The devil il&#xD;
you did?  You drunken old idiot, why did not   t&#xD;
you tell me so before ?"                       h&#xD;
Muller. "Because, whenever we meet, you&#xD;
indulge in such gusts of temper, and assail mek&#xD;
with such invectives and threats, that I forget&#xD;
to tell you trifling news, being altogether en. I&#xD;
grossed with solicitude for your peace of mind,&#xD;
and always fearing lest some hasty mood of      f&#xD;
yours may breed an eternal breach of friend.    t&#xD;
ship between us."&#xD;
Stilletto's lynx eyes rested long upo the&#xD;
philosopher's face, and  he relapsed into a    a&#xD;
gloomy silence, during which he seemed to be&#xD;
reflecting and weighing something in his mind I&#xD;
with great attention.                           I&#xD;
*       *      *       *      *&#xD;
Mr. Paradise did. not lose an hour, nor did   I&#xD;
he overlook the most trifling aspect of the de-&#xD;
fense he had undertaken. Josephine had I&#xD;
parted from him that Christmas-eve with grave 1&#xD;
fears, and yet the hunchback, his heart moved&#xD;
for once, had endeavored to reassure her,&#xD;
rather than to lay the fullest stress upon the&#xD;
dangers that threatened Montant. Before the&#xD;
lawyer thought of his night's rest, he had&#xD;
written several notes, intrusted to the parti-&#xD;
cular care and despatch of Mr. Smiles, and in.&#xD;
tended to summon immediately to his aid such&#xD;
assistance as he knew, from his great expe.&#xD;
rience, the affair demanded. One of these let-&#xD;
ters was addressed to Mr. Stump, our old&#xD;
friend and ex-detective; and sure enough, the&#xD;
next morning, though it was Christmas-day,&#xD;
the little man with the short hair and dump-&#xD;
ling proportions, made his appearance in&#xD;
Washington Square.&#xD;
Mr. Paradise received him en deshabille, and&#xD;
not in a very encouraging humor.&#xD;
Paradise. "Stump, if you will see that the&#xD;
next room is empty, and then lock the door of&#xD;
it, I will talk to you."&#xD;
Stump (obeying with alacrity). "Thank'ee,&#xD;
sir."&#xD;
Paradise. "Now, Stump, I hear that you&#xD;
want to re-enter the secret service.&#xD;
Stump. " Yes, sir. Being as I didn't agree&#xD;
with the gentleman that owns my grocery, so.&#xD;
he has now shut down on me, and shut up the&#xD;
shop."&#xD;
Paradise. "You mean you did not pay the&#xD;
rent, you vagabond, and your landlord kicked&#xD;
you out. Is that it ?"&#xD;
Stump. " Just as you please sir."&#xD;
&#xD;
120&#xD;
&#xD;

FORTUNE.&#xD;
&#xD;
Paradise. "And since you want to re-enter&#xD;
the service, I suppose you would like me to&#xD;
use my influence with -the police commission-&#xD;
ers in your favor?"&#xD;
Stump   (grinning  sweetly). "Indeed, I&#xD;
would be proud of it, Gov'n'r."&#xD;
Paradise (curtly). "We'll see. You know&#xD;
a man by the name of Stilletto ?"&#xD;
Stump. "Antony Staletoe ? I know him, as&#xD;
if we'd been raised by one hand." ,&#xD;
Paradise. "Have you read the evidence in&#xD;
the Van Strom murder ?"&#xD;
Stump. "No, sir."&#xD;
Paradise. "Read it, then, while I finish my&#xD;
toilet."&#xD;
He handed the necessary papers over to the&#xD;
little man, who read the affidavits quickly; but&#xD;
with that prompt insight which he had acquired&#xD;
in his profession.&#xD;
Paradise. "What do you think of it ?".&#xD;
Stump (rising to go). "Nothing."&#xD;
Paradise. (amazed). "What do you mean,&#xD;
sir?"&#xD;
Stump (doggedly). "Nothing."&#xD;
Paradise. "Explain yourself, or take the con-&#xD;
sequences."&#xD;
Stump. " I'll take the consequences, sir. I&#xD;
said nothing.  I mean nothing, and NOTHR4G&#xD;
will I have to do with this case."&#xD;
Paradise. "For the last time, Why ?"&#xD;
Stump. "Because Antony Staletoe is a&#xD;
friend of mine, and if it's so as you want me&#xD;
to dodge him, as I can see plain you want me&#xD;
to, I'll say this. Police commissioners or no&#xD;
police commissioners-sitoowation or no sitoo-&#xD;
wation, I won't dodge a friend that's always&#xD;
treated me square."&#xD;
Paradise. "Stump, you are a sharp fellow&#xD;
for guessing just what I want of you; but you&#xD;
are obtuse in another direction."&#xD;
Stump. "What does that word mean, sir."&#xD;
Paradise. "It means that you have told me&#xD;
something I did want to know-your opinion&#xD;
of the case."&#xD;
Stump (aghast). )"I expressed no opinion&#xD;
of the case, sir."&#xD;
Paradise. " You have as much as told me&#xD;
that you think Antonio Stilletto murdered that&#xD;
man, and that Judge Bates committed perjury&#xD;
when he swore to, the alibi. What else made&#xD;
you think of dodging Stilletto, and what&#xD;
harm can you do your friend if he has done no&#xD;
wrong ?"&#xD;
Stump (admiringly). "You are the great-&#xD;
est lawyer in the country, sir."&#xD;
Paradise (disdainfully). " And since it pleases&#xD;
me to employ you, and no one else but you, I&#xD;
herewith assign to you all that interesting&#xD;
work which consists in laying, spying, and&#xD;
tale-telling, which- you call dodging your&#xD;
friend."&#xD;
Stump (very decidedly, and again rising to&#xD;
go). " And I, sir, with all respect and regard&#xD;
for you, must say I can't do it, and what's&#xD;
more, I won't.&#xD;
Paradise. "Stump ?"&#xD;
Stump, " Sir."&#xD;
Paradise. "How about Hobgoblin ?"&#xD;
Stump. "About what? Ohf! you mean-"&#xD;
Paradise. "Yes, I mean to refresh your&#xD;
-memory a little on certain joint transactions&#xD;
&#xD;
121&#xD;
&#xD;
which you engaged in with that German&#xD;
drunkard, Muller, and your friend Stilletto."&#xD;
Mr. Stump looked first puzzled, then fright-&#xD;
ened, and finally resumed his seat, demurely,&#xD;
and looked foolish. Mr. Paradise proceeded to&#xD;
do as he had promised, viz.-to recall to his&#xD;
mind the fact that he had been connected with&#xD;
Hobgoblin, in a manner which had better not&#xD;
be inquired into (which the reader may re-&#xD;
member was detailed in book I). When the&#xD;
lawyer had proved that he had been remark-&#xD;
ably well posted on that affair, and knowrL the&#xD;
parts taken by Martin Bates, Muller, Stilletto,&#xD;
and Stump, the latter gentleman looked crest-&#xD;
fallen, but his admiration for the lawyer in-&#xD;
creased.&#xD;
Paradise (firmly). " And now, all I have&#xD;
to say is that you will do as I bid you. I can&#xD;
employ no regular detective, for I am afraid&#xD;
Stilletto is sharp enough to penetrate any dis-&#xD;
guise, while you are his friend, and besides,&#xD;
quite sharp enough to manage it."&#xD;
Stump (despondingly). "Well, sir, I'll do&#xD;
it; but I swear it is the meanest, most sneak-&#xD;
ing, villainous act of my whole life ! To dodge&#xD;
a man's friend what he's borrowed money&#xD;
fromI"&#xD;
Paradise. "I'll pay you well for it, and we&#xD;
Vill make the bargain as soon as you receive&#xD;
1hy instructions. You must start for Boston&#xD;
to-night."&#xD;
Stump (meekly). "I'll do it, sir."&#xD;
Paradise. " And you must look sharp."&#xD;
Stump. "If I must do it, I'll do it well,&#xD;
sir."&#xD;
The day before the trial had arrived, and&#xD;
Mr. Paradise was just preparing to leave New&#xD;
York for the scene of action by the afternoon&#xD;
train, when the door of his private office was&#xD;
opened violently by a man, followed by the&#xD;
astonished servant. The man was old and&#xD;
bald, and bony, and breathless with haste. " I&#xD;
came here on an inspiration," he gasped.&#xD;
"Thank God I find you!"&#xD;
Paradise (staring). "Martin Bates ?"&#xD;
Martin. "Yes, and here is something of&#xD;
more importance than old Martin Bates."&#xD;
The lawyer glanced over the paper which&#xD;
Martin handed him.    It was Simonetta's&#xD;
letter, with a translation appended, to which&#xD;
Paradise referred from time to time. His face&#xD;
brightened.&#xD;
Paradise. " Why there is more hope in this&#xD;
than in all the eloquence of a Demosthenes !&#xD;
Do you think she saw Stilletto about the time&#xD;
of the murder?"&#xD;
Martin. " I am certain of it."&#xD;
Paradise. "Now sit down here and tell me&#xD;
why you are certain of it. If we can upset&#xD;
your brother's alibi, the whole case falls to&#xD;
the ground, and Montant and Stilletto change&#xD;
places. But hold on a moment, Stilletto is in {&#xD;
town."&#xD;
Martin. " Aha I Then we will want help at&#xD;
the countess's to-night, or at least we will have&#xD;
to play a sharp game if Stilletto happens to be&#xD;
there."&#xD;
Paradise..." So I think. I will send for&#xD;
Stump at once. He is our man."&#xD;

GOING AND SON.&#xD;
&#xD;
CHAPTER V.&#xD;
THE COUNTESS.&#xD;
" fy hair does stand on end to hear her curses."&#xD;
KING RICHARD III.&#xD;
THEY were a queer couple, crouching close&#xD;
to the large fireplace in the dance hall of the&#xD;
Italian boarding-house.&#xD;
And this was the countess, the ignoble&#xD;
proprietress of the ignoble den, with a yellow&#xD;
turban crowning her wrinkled wicked face, and&#xD;
her vicious black eyes gleaming like will-o'-the-&#xD;
wisps in a dangerous swamp.&#xD;
And by her side, Stilletto, his demoniac&#xD;
face unmasked of hypocrisy-that was useless&#xD;
here-and yet not open and honest, for that it&#xD;
could not be. The conversation was carried&#xD;
on in Italian.&#xD;
"Well, my son," said the countess.&#xD;
" Hold on a momentI Do you know it has&#xD;
often occurred to me that you are not so cer-&#xD;
tain about this mother and son business !"&#xD;
"Ain't I," chuckled the old hag. "A man&#xD;
may never be sure that he has fathered a&#xD;
child, but the mother that bore it-no mistake&#xD;
there, sweetness."&#xD;
"I can't say that I am proud of my ances-&#xD;
tress, though you claim to be of noble family.&#xD;
A nice place this, for aristocratic people," said&#xD;
Stilletto, glancing around the room.&#xD;
The dull light of the leaden day did not add&#xD;
fascinations to the coarsely-painted walls or the&#xD;
queer, many colored paper ornaments adorn-&#xD;
ing the ceiling. There was that about the&#xD;
room which reminds one of the seediness that&#xD;
follows upon dissipation.&#xD;
" Wait till the lamps are lit," said the coun-&#xD;
tess, following his eyes, and noticing the im-&#xD;
pression made upon him.&#xD;
" Yes," answered Stilletto, with more truth&#xD;
than grace, "the lamps will be lighted, but&#xD;
to-morrow this same damnable shabbiness&#xD;
will come out again and again and again, until&#xD;
the rotten shanty falls to pieces, just like you,&#xD;
my lovely mother !"&#xD;
"Well, it's true," said the countess, with an&#xD;
oath, "it does seem strange for Angelica,&#xD;
Countess of Unkstein, to be what I am."&#xD;
Stilletto did not appreciate the touch of&#xD;
sentiment and remorse that spoke in her&#xD;
words, and dejected tone. "Do you know,"&#xD;
he cried, " that I have in some way lost that&#xD;
sweet little autobiography of your lamented&#xD;
husband ?"&#xD;
" What ! the Maniac's Story ?"&#xD;
" Yes, along with the copy of some letters&#xD;
I wrote to my father. I must have dropped&#xD;
them, some months ago, when I called upon&#xD;
the honorable Judge in Massachusetts."&#xD;
" You always were a careless, harum-scarum&#xD;
dog !" said the countess, with more pride than&#xD;
derision.&#xD;
"No wonder I'm a dog, being born of a she&#xD;
wolf."&#xD;
"Don't say thatI By the Virgin! I shud-&#xD;
der when I think of that crazy man in the&#xD;
Black Forest, and read his half-reasonable&#xD;
story." -&#xD;
" You've led a queer life, mother !"&#xD;
&#xD;
"Yes, yes. The difference between Baden.&#xD;
Baden and the Fourth Ward is considerable!&#xD;
I was a good enough girl when I first saw the&#xD;
count. He was a sinister, half-cracked man&#xD;
then, but he was rich. God help me forget the&#xD;
years I spent at that castle in the Black&#xD;
Forest. A dreary, lonely spot it was, a morose&#xD;
half-spectral husband to make it lively, ha!&#xD;
ha! Still I liked him well enough, and when,&#xD;
on returning late one night from the hunt, he&#xD;
recoiled from me as I met him at my door,&#xD;
thinking, idiot that he was, I had turned into&#xD;
a wolf-"&#xD;
" Well, mother, I'll be cursed if you don't&#xD;
look like one at times !"&#xD;
" Do I ?" snarled the countess, showing her&#xD;
teeth savagely.&#xD;
" Don't !" shrieked Stilletto, in genuine&#xD;
alarm. "You know I can't bear that look. I&#xD;
don't blame the count for seeing the bloody&#xD;
brute stick right out in you I"&#xD;
"You damned, crazy vagabond !"&#xD;
"Now, don't, and talk reasonably."&#xD;
"What shall I talk about ?" asked the&#xD;
countess, with a bitter expression on her&#xD;
vicious face. "Shall I describe to you how I&#xD;
was an innocent girl once? Shall I tell you&#xD;
that I had a happy home and have experienced&#xD;
the old story of virtue, love, sin, despair, all&#xD;
in due rotation ? Would you like to know&#xD;
how I became your mother? Well, after&#xD;
the count died in the asylum, I had some&#xD;
money and some respectability left. I met&#xD;
your father, Eben Bates, who was making the&#xD;
tour of the Continent to allow some British&#xD;
scandal to grow cold in his absence. He left&#xD;
me a wretch, dishonored and forsaken, expect-&#xD;
ing to give birth to his child. That child&#xD;
turned out to be a hideous monster. That&#xD;
child was called Antonio Stiletto. After giving&#xD;
you an education, and discovering that you&#xD;
were a born vagabond, sharper, and thorough&#xD;
scoundrel, I brought you to America to pester&#xD;
your father, who had taken his wife to this side&#xD;
of the sea to escape the consequences of his ac-&#xD;
tions in England. What wonder that, in spite of&#xD;
all the money you got from him, I found myself&#xD;
as poor as a rat when my own money was&#xD;
gone ! No wonder you allowed your mother&#xD;
to sink down to this filthy profession, for you&#xD;
are a dirty, greedy, cruel brute, and you know&#xD;
it."&#xD;
"Well, I suppose I am," conceded Stilletto,&#xD;
soothingly.&#xD;
" What villainies you have committed dur-&#xD;

never know, nor any one else, for a cur like&#xD;
you will be a mystery to his own mother and&#xD;
to the whole world forever. I wouldn't, be&#xD;
surprised had you murdered Van Strom your-&#xD;
self, you unconscionable, cold-blooded, hellish&#xD;
dog !"&#xD;
Stilletto had suddenly grown a sickly yel-&#xD;
low.&#xD;
"Don't say too much, mother," he cried. "I&#xD;
have always helped you when I could, and&#xD;
have often come to you for advice like a duti-&#xD;
ful son; but I won't have such words as&#xD;
those!i Mind-I'm dangerous if you rouse&#xD;
me&#xD;
" So is a cowardly, carrion-fed hyena; but&#xD;

&#xD;
there is no fght .in him when he meets his&#xD;
master. Just try to bite me, you-"&#xD;
" Hold-I say ! I have made up my mind&#xD;
not to get mad, but don't tempt me ! Let us&#xD;
be friends, mother, and tell me how to act at&#xD;
that trial to-morrow. Come, come, I'll treat to&#xD;
a bottle of wine if you'll be reasonable."&#xD;
The countess relented, and after she had&#xD;
filled the glasses, threw one dirty-stockinged,&#xD;
slip-shod foot over the other, leaned back in&#xD;
her chair, and said, affably,-&#xD;
" After all, I have some pride in you, and&#xD;
if you tell me all about your scrape, I'll tell&#xD;
you what to do."&#xD;
"In the first place, where is this girl Simo-&#xD;
netta ?"&#xD;
" What's that to you ?"&#xD;
" I want to see her."&#xD;
"What for?   Isn't it enough that you se-&#xD;
duced her, then kept her from marrying that&#xD;
good old fool Martin Bates, and then got her&#xD;
into-God knows what scrapes, down in Mas-&#xD;
sachusetts ?"&#xD;
4 This is a tender spot in your shriveled old&#xD;
heart, mother."&#xD;
"Yes-and it always will be. Look through&#xD;
this ward; see the drunken dogs and sluts,&#xD;
the thieves, murderers, and scabby reprobates&#xD;
of all kinds, and I'll tell you something the&#xD;
police don't know, and the charity folk don't&#xD;
dream of. They all have a tender spot. Now,&#xD;
then, my tender spot is that girl."&#xD;
"Damn her !"&#xD;
" That's a blessing on her," said the count-&#xD;
ess, almost devoutly, and her face assumed a&#xD;
kind, half-tender expression. " She was poor&#xD;
when I first know her. Her father, the or-&#xD;
gan-grinder, was a servant in our house in&#xD;
Italy, long, long ago. He lived next door&#xD;
here, and when he died, I took her entirely&#xD;
under my protection."&#xD;
"A nice protection," sneered Stilletto. "I&#xD;
had a hand in it, mother."&#xD;
"So many more curses, on you, then-but&#xD;
that is passed. You have ruined her and&#xD;
prevented that marriage-"&#xD;
" Martin Bates is a thief; but I suppose&#xD;
that's what you looked for in your darling's&#xD;
husband."&#xD;
" Thief or no thief, he is a kind-hearted&#xD;
man."&#xD;
" Enough of him. Where is. she ?"&#xD;
"What do you want of her ?"&#xD;
" I want to make sure that she won't turn&#xD;
against me to-morrow."&#xD;
"Ha! ha ! ha !" laughed the hag, with such&#xD;
demoniac glee that Stilletto shuddered.&#xD;
-" What are you laughing at ?"&#xD;
"Because, fool that you are, you have let&#xD;
out that she can turn against you if she wants&#xD;
to! So you're in a scrape about that trial, are&#xD;
you, my precious chick ? How smart to tell&#xD;
me so!"&#xD;
" Mother ! or, rather, hellish old hussy that&#xD;
you are-"&#xD;
"Ware I" she cried, flaring up. " Though&#xD;
they call me the countess, only as anickname,&#xD;
I have more power than many a duchess ! I&#xD;
am queen in this-neighborhood, and I won't be&#xD;
the first queen that saw her son hanged for&#xD;
insulting herI"&#xD;
&#xD;
123&#xD;
&#xD;
"Where is she ?" demanded Stilletto, livid&#xD;
and trembling with rage.&#xD;
" I won't tell you!"&#xD;
"So you know?"&#xD;
"Yes, and she's safe from you."&#xD;
"Don't go too far," said he, hoarsely, ad-&#xD;
vancing toward her.&#xD;
"None of those looks. They won't do here!"&#xD;
cried the countess. She drew a dirk and re-&#xD;
treated a step in defense. At the same time&#xD;
she stamped upon the floor, and in an instant&#xD;
Stilletto saw a vicious, dogged fellow by his&#xD;
side, whose broad shoulders and dangerous eye&#xD;
told him that he was foiled.&#xD;
" Ha! ha! ha !" again laughed the countess,&#xD;
with a more hideously, shrill voice than ever.&#xD;
" Your tricks won't do here, my pet. Teach&#xD;
your own mother to play points, hey?  Get&#xD;
out you white-livered,black-souled,ill-begotten,&#xD;
murderous hound, or you'll be sorry for it I"&#xD;
" You'll suffer for this if that girl comes to&#xD;
the trial to-morrow," snarled Stilletto, and left&#xD;
the house in impotent wrath.&#xD;
* -    *      *      *      *&#xD;
The lamps were illuminating the flimsy or-&#xD;
naments of the dance-hall, and shedding an&#xD;
artificial glare upon the painted faces of the&#xD;
girls in short dresses as they hung around&#xD;
listlessly awaiting the company which had not&#xD;
yet arrived.&#xD;
The shriveled old mistress of iniquity, the&#xD;
countess, sat by the great fire and smoked a&#xD;
cigarette. She was expecting some one with&#xD;
a nervous agitation she strove to conceal.&#xD;
When the old clock struck the hour viciously,&#xD;
the expected visitors, punctual to the lain-&#xD;
ute, entered. One was a withered old man,&#xD;
in a shabby coat, his square features working&#xD;
excitedly. We know him by the name of&#xD;
Martin Bates. The other, a short, old gentle-&#xD;
man with a flowing white beard, we can not&#xD;
recognize but the countess sees through the&#xD;
disguise in a moment.&#xD;
" Mr. Stump," she says, quietly, in English,&#xD;
"all them air masks of yourn are played!&#xD;
That's what they be. Prayed1"&#xD;
"Keep steady, melady," replied Mr. Stump,&#xD;
"Keep steady to-night, and stand by us, or by&#xD;
- you'll make an enemy o' mine, an' of all&#xD;
Mulberry street besides."&#xD;
"Where is the girl?  Where is Simonetta ?"&#xD;
inquired Martin, hastily.&#xD;
" What s that to you ?" retorted the woman,&#xD;
sharply. " They don't want to hang you to-&#xD;
morrow, do they ?"&#xD;
"No; but I have determined to save the in-&#xD;
nocent, at all. hazards; even should it cost a&#xD;
brother's life, and I mean to leave no stone&#xD;
unturned."&#xD;
" A new character for Martin Bates,"&#xD;
" Where is the girl ?" persisted he.&#xD;
" In her stockin's, I s'pose!"&#xD;
"Now, mistress melady, countess-" be-&#xD;
gan Mr. Stump.&#xD;
" Hold'your noise !" interrupted the mistress,&#xD;
"or you will make me hold mine, that's all.&#xD;
Before we go any further, I want to tell you&#xD;
something, Martin Bates. You say that you&#xD;
want to rescue the innocent, although it cost a&#xD;
brother's life, or happiness, or virtue, or honor,&#xD;
or what you may call all the cursed things.&#xD;
&#xD;

GOING AND SON.&#xD;
&#xD;
Now, what harm has that brother done to you&#xD;
to make you act so ?"&#xD;
"The harm that he has done to me is as&#xD;
nothing-"&#xD;
"But the harm he has done to me is some-&#xD;
thing," interrupted the hag, viciously. "Do&#xD;
you know who I am ?"&#xD;
" No-but where is the -"&#xD;
"Let me finish. I want you to know that&#xD;
I'm a real countess, though my noble count did&#xD;
go mad, and though I am more of a wolf than&#xD;
some people might think if they read a certain&#xD;
eloquent description of me, which he wrote in&#xD;
a Dutch mad-house before he died."&#xD;
" You don't mean to say-" cried Martin, in&#xD;
astonishment.&#xD;
"Well!"&#xD;
" Are you-can you be the Countess of&#xD;
Unkstein ?"&#xD;
It was the hag's turn to be astonished.&#xD;
" What do you know about Unkstein ?"&#xD;
"I found a paper. Stilletto dropped it in&#xD;
my brother's garden. I read it-can it be ?"&#xD;
" Oh, you found the paper," said the count-&#xD;
ess, again resuming  her disdainful tone.&#xD;
" Give it back to me."&#xD;
Martin had not allowed the paper to leave&#xD;
his pocket, and he handed it over me-&#xD;
chanically. As he did so he stepped close to&#xD;
her. She looked up at him, and with a snarl,&#xD;
showed him her teeth. He recoiled, terrified,&#xD;
and staring at her, cried,-&#xD;
" I think the maniac was not all wrong !"&#xD;
The countess laughed a peculiar chuckling&#xD;
laugh, and said:-&#xD;
"Now I'll tell you something else. If Eben&#xD;
Bates is shown up as a perjurer, lie is a broken&#xD;
man. You lose a brother, I lose a lover ;" and&#xD;
again she laughed in a manner resembling the&#xD;
bark of a dog.&#xD;
" What!1 are you- ?"&#xD;
"Yes, I am."&#xD;
" I begin to see the truth ! You are the&#xD;
same countess with whom my brother had an&#xD;
intrigue on the continent, thirty years ago,&#xD;
and-but what else are you, for heaven's&#xD;
sake ?"&#xD;
"Stilletto's mother," she said, quietly.&#xD;
" And you have set him on to extort money&#xD;
from his father?" cried Martin, fiercely.&#xD;
"Just so."&#xD;
" And you are the torturer that tormented&#xD;
him till he left the path of honor and virtue,&#xD;
and became what he is ?"&#xD;
"Yes, my dear."&#xD;
"You have been the evil spirit of his life,&#xD;
working through the instrumentality of his&#xD;
bastard son," continued Martin, livid with&#xD;
rage, becoming more and more excited by his&#xD;
own invective and her cool replies. "You are&#xD;
the ugly, foul nightmare, that has banished&#xD;
sleep from him, and you have poisoned his life&#xD;
until it became saturated with the pestilence&#xD;
of your own black soul."&#xD;
" Don't talk so loud, brother-in-law; the&#xD;
girls will hear you," replied the countess,&#xD;
lighting a fresh cigarette.&#xD;
"You have distressed and harassed him,&#xD;
driven him to despair. Look at the result,&#xD;
you-hellish slut!"&#xD;
" I'm looken at it," said the countess, with&#xD;
&#xD;
a yawn, crossing her legs, as she leaned back&#xD;
in her chair." I'm looken at it; and I say, he&#xD;
hasn't come down enough yet.    So well&#xD;
bring him down to-morrow. He has brought&#xD;
me to what I am."&#xD;
"A lump of filthI"&#xD;
"Exactly; and that's what he has got to&#xD;
come to before we are even. Blood for blood&#xD;
you know, brother-in-law."&#xD;
" Don't call me by that name again," cried&#xD;
Martin, beside himself with fury.&#xD;
" Why hear thisI Because Eben did not&#xD;
marry me, as he promised he would, is that&#xD;
any reason why you are not my brother-in-law&#xD;
Martin, dear?"&#xD;
"Well, call me what you like. You have&#xD;
dragged me, too, down to destruction. Do you&#xD;
know that I stole money to help Eben in his&#xD;
troubles, and that my perdition is on your&#xD;
soul,-if you have any ?"&#xD;
" Well, if it was'nt, it would be on some one&#xD;
else's! Nobody can tell me that a man'llsteal&#xD;
unless it's in him/1"&#xD;
" Enough of such plagues as you I" cried&#xD;
Martin. "I'll not go to the trial to-morrow.&#xD;
Let the innocent suffer, but you shall not suc-&#xD;
ceed in your designs against my brother."&#xD;
" Allow me," said Mr. Stump, "allow me, in&#xD;
a mild way, to interrupt this much interestin'&#xD;
and piuss confabulation. May I ask your lady.&#xD;
ship how it is as you knows so much about&#xD;
this 'ere murder, and about the honorable&#xD;
judge's lying perjury ?"&#xD;
"I'd as lief tell you," said the countess,&#xD;
languidly. "Simonetta has told me more than&#xD;
both of you, and all the lawyers in the land,&#xD;
know. You only guess, while I know all about&#xD;
it."&#xD;
"So she has broken the awful vow about&#xD;
which she wrote me ?" queried Martin.&#xD;
" I made her do it. I got a priest to absolve&#xD;
her, for ten dollars, and spent the money&#xD;
willingly. I might as well have been there, so&#xD;
well am [ posted on all that happened. The&#xD;
girl saw my dear boy just about the time that&#xD;
the crazy Van Strom was killed, so this Stil-&#xD;
letto, son of mine, was not at his father's house&#xD;
that afternoon. You may draw your own con-&#xD;
clusions."&#xD;
"But this will bring your son-your own&#xD;
son -to the gallows," cried Martin.&#xD;
"He's been a disobedient, burdensome,&#xD;
white-livered whelp; so I've about concluded&#xD;
to let the father hang the son, and the son&#xD;
send the father to State's prison or suicide, I&#xD;
don't care which. I am sick of the whole&#xD;
tribe."&#xD;
" Can you expect mercy in heaven ?"&#xD;
"Leave me alone," she replied, with more&#xD;
animation. "A queer story might be told of&#xD;
how I changed from an innocent girl, in an&#xD;
Italian home, to the old hag, keeping the lowest&#xD;
den in New York. But the story has all hap-&#xD;
pened, the change has taken place, and damn&#xD;
all those that helped to kick me down."&#xD;
" Oh, God !" murmured Martin Bates, "canst&#xD;
Thou look upon such as these and not blush&#xD;
at thy handiwork !"&#xD;
" Don't blarstpheematize," admonished, Mr.&#xD;
Stump, shocked at Martin's ejaculation.&#xD;
" But to come to business," said the coun-&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
tess, in a whisper. "My son, Stilletto, Mar-&#xD;
tin's precious nephew, paid me a visit this&#xD;
afternoon. He seemed afraid of the girl-lie&#xD;
tried to get at her through me."&#xD;
" Did he succeed ?"&#xD;
" No: I love that girl."&#xD;
"Where is she ?" again, asked Martin, en-&#xD;
treatingly.&#xD;
" Up-stairs. I am afraid to let her come&#xD;
down, for. I'm never sure of my dear son's&#xD;
whereabouts."&#xD;
"I'll take care of her," said Mr. Stump,&#xD;
with the majesty reflected from the law.&#xD;
"I have ten men outside. We'll see her all&#xD;
safe."     -&#xD;
" After all, the police is a great institution,"&#xD;
cried the countess. " But ain't it queer that&#xD;
the life of that gentleman, who is accused of&#xD;
the murder, should be saved just because a&#xD;
creature like me wants revenge upon a son&#xD;
and that son's father! Is that the way inno-&#xD;
cence should be saved ?"&#xD;
" No,' replied Mr. Stump, blandly ; "inno-&#xD;
cence in this case is saved by the circumspec-&#xD;
tion of-"&#xD;
"God," said old Martin Bates, fervently.&#xD;
"Of the Police," corrected Mr. Stump, and&#xD;
then he added with some heartiness,-" I have&#xD;
not been an officer all my life for nothing,&#xD;
Missus Countess, and I see that I can trust&#xD;
you. Now there is a lawyer by name of Pary-&#xD;
dise up town that is the shrewdest man born.&#xD;
He has paid enough to surround this 'ere&#xD;
house of yours with picked men, and not a&#xD;
mouse can leave it nohow, without that mouse is&#xD;
diskivert. Now you know the ward police all&#xD;
know this Netty Merino, and in case she ain't&#xD;
produced, we'll have her out by force. I&#xD;
never axed you where she was, did I? Why?&#xD;
'cause I knowed she was here. I never meant&#xD;
to go up town to watch for my friend Staletoe.&#xD;
Why? 'cause he started for Bostin four hours&#xD;
ago. Now, then, I have told you all about it&#xD;
because I think I can trust you, and I've&#xD;
throwed off all disguise, and here I be a tellin'&#xD;
the truth for oncet."&#xD;
" But suppose she refuses to go with you ?"&#xD;
asked the countess, ill-pleased.&#xD;
" We'd kidnap her and gag her, and make&#xD;
her go, though it cost Mister Parydise a thou-&#xD;
sand dollars damiges-or five thousand."&#xD;
" And suppose I hadn't make her break her&#xD;
oath ?"&#xD;
" Put her on that air witness stand, and put&#xD;
old Parydise in front of her, and I'll bet my&#xD;
bottom dollar he'll worm the oaths all out of her&#xD;
like your picken the seeds out of an Eyetalian&#xD;
orange with a sharp blade."&#xD;
Not unimpressed by this glowing account&#xD;
of Mr. Paradise's talents, the countess said,&#xD;
after a pause,-  .&#xD;
"Well, you'll have her for a witness any&#xD;
how, and she'll speak fair and full what she&#xD;
knows."&#xD;
" So although your highness has fussilotated&#xD;
things," said Mr. Stump, in all the dignity of&#xD;
a big word, " still the rescue of the blameless&#xD;
ain't no result of your stubborn vengeance&#xD;
and bloodthirsty spirrut."&#xD;
"For which God be praised," said Martin,&#xD;
devoutly.&#xD;

CHAPTER VI.&#xD;
THE TRIAL.&#xD;
"Heaven is above all yet: There sits a judge&#xD;
That no king can corrupt I"&#xD;
KING HENRY VIII.&#xD;
" I do beseech you,&#xD;
Make no more offers, use no further means,&#xD;
But with all brief and plain conveniency,&#xD;
Let me have judgment,"&#xD;
MERCHANT o VENICE.&#xD;
THIs is not a Pickwickian scene. Intelligence&#xD;
speaks in almost every face of the assem-&#xD;
blage which throngs the entrance and the pas-&#xD;
sage of the court-house ; while the confined&#xD;
space of the modest little court-room is&#xD;
crowded almost to suffocation. We are not in&#xD;
London, where a quaint originality must be&#xD;
employed by an author, to cover the absolute&#xD;
stupidity of the mob, to hide the absence of&#xD;
real intelligence by depicting a humorous in-&#xD;
dividuality.&#xD;
But we are in the State of Massachusetts,&#xD;
and despite the fanaticism which characterizes&#xD;
it as a community, one need only glance at&#xD;
the calm, sharp faces of those twelve jurymen&#xD;
to be satisfied that he would rather submit&#xD;
his case to them than to be judged by twelve&#xD;
peers of England, for here we can recognize&#xD;
acuteness and integrity of mind without pre-&#xD;
judice.&#xD;
The judge wears no wig, and sleep is far&#xD;
from his thoughts. He is humble enough to&#xD;
be zealous in his work, he is bold enough to&#xD;
be honest ; and yet he is only a simple country-&#xD;
man, with an education barely sufficient, and&#xD;
with only as much dignity as his own merits&#xD;
and his position inspire. What he lacks in&#xD;
idle pomposity he makes up by mother-wit,&#xD;
and his fidelity to the cause of justice, has&#xD;
acquired for him a modest but solid reputa-&#xD;
tion in his limited sphere of action.&#xD;
Here comes the prisoner, at whose sight&#xD;
there ensues that awful silence in the court-&#xD;
room, which is a dumb plaudit suited to the&#xD;
occasion. Some experience a sensation as if&#xD;
the eralvat were too tight, others feel their&#xD;
hearts cease beating, all are impressed by the&#xD;
situation of the man who attracts so much at-&#xD;
tention, and yet not greeted by one friendly&#xD;
face in all that crowd, who stare upon him as&#xD;
it were 'with a thousand basilisk eyes.&#xD;
This is the first act of that drama of real&#xD;
death, at the close of which, instead of drop-&#xD;
ping an innocent curtain, they often drop the&#xD;
body of the star actor in a manner rather dis-&#xD;
agreeable to him, though it hands his name&#xD;
down to the admiration of impressible school-&#xD;
boys and ambitious criminals.&#xD;
Ernest Montant looked pale, but not agi-&#xD;
tated. He had been hard at work with&#xD;
his counsel, preparing for the defense, and al-&#xD;
though he knew his danger, he was more en-&#xD;
grossed in his efforts to save himself, than&#xD;
haunted by fears of the result.&#xD;
When Mr. Paradise entered the court-room,&#xD;
he created a peculiar sensation. "This is the&#xD;
great New York lawyer," was whispered&#xD;
through the audience, and the intelligence of&#xD;
his marked features, and the brightness of his&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb  n="126" xml:id="VAC7268-00000071"/>&#xD;
GOING AND SON.&#xD;
&#xD;
eyes received a dumb tribute from these rus-&#xD;
tics while pity prevented the derision his&#xD;
deformity might otherwise have excited.&#xD;
The court being duly opened, and the case&#xD;
called, Mr. Paradise immediately stepped to&#xD;
the judge's bench, and said in a low, clear&#xD;
voice.&#xD;
" It becomes necessary for me to ask your&#xD;
honor for a postponement of the trial until to-&#xD;
morrow. We are not yet quite ready."&#xD;
A murmur of disapprobation ran through&#xD;
the audience which so increased as to compel&#xD;
the judge to call them to order, and threaten&#xD;
to have the room cleared if the court was to&#xD;
be interrupted in this manner.&#xD;
The district attorney, a fine-looking man,&#xD;
with a large head and a deep voice, arose and&#xD;
said,-&#xD;
" I beg to remind your honor that we have&#xD;
already consented to previous postponements.&#xD;
We can not understand why the defense&#xD;
should thus abuse the leniency of the court."&#xD;
"Upon what grounds do you request this&#xD;
postponement, Mr. Paradise ?" asked the&#xD;
judge. "Haven't you procured all your wit-&#xD;
nesses yet ?"&#xD;
"Our witnesses are here; but my associ-&#xD;
ates and I have not had the time to consult&#xD;
sufficiently. You know my practice is not a&#xD;
small one-"&#xD;
"I am afraid Mr. Paradise has not found&#xD;
this defense a very delightful undertaking I"&#xD;
cried the district attorney, with a sneer.&#xD;
" Am I to be interrupted in this discourteous&#xD;
manner?" asked Mr. Paradise, warming.&#xD;
" We mean to treat you with all due cour-&#xD;
tesy," answered the judge, "and we do not&#xD;
forget your extensive practice and pressing&#xD;
occupations; but I must decide that you have&#xD;
had ample time to prepare, and I can not&#xD;
grant the postponement unless you have other&#xD;
reasons for asking it."&#xD;
For a moment Mr. Paradise seemed to hesi-&#xD;
tate, and then begged leave to consult with&#xD;
his client and his associates. After a few&#xD;
whispered words, the prisoner shook his head&#xD;
resolutely, and the lawyer said, turning to the&#xD;
judge,-&#xD;
" We have no other grounds for a delay,&#xD;
and since your honor has overruled them, I&#xD;
suppose we must say that we are ready."&#xD;
" Go on, then," said the judge.&#xD;
An irrepressible though faint murmur of&#xD;
applause ran through the room. A celebrated&#xD;
lawyer from New York is always at a disad-&#xD;
'antage in country courts, for every one&#xD;
thinks that he is trying to control matters and&#xD;
despises the provincial institutions. It is&#xD;
therefore a satisfaction to the jury and all&#xD;
present, if the judge puts down some celebrity&#xD;
from the metropolis, and Paradise glancing&#xD;
around him, knew full well that the case had&#xD;
opened badly for him so far.&#xD;
After the clerk had read the indictment, by&#xD;
which the people of the Commonwealth of&#xD;
Massachusetts, on complaint of Bella Van&#xD;
Strom, accused Ernest Montant, of London,&#xD;
England, and late of New York, of the murder&#xD;
of John Jacob Van Strom, end the prisoner&#xD;
had put in a plea of "Not guilty," the district&#xD;
attorney, amidst breathless silence and univer-&#xD;
&#xD;
sal straining of eyes, necks, and ears, opened&#xD;
the case for the prosecution.&#xD;
This was a peculiar case (as it generally is),&#xD;
and bearing within its issues the bringing to&#xD;
justice of one who had committed the most&#xD;
heinous crime known to social laws or to&#xD;
God's records of human depravity. This pe.&#xD;
culiarity would be found in the action of the&#xD;
prisoner at the bar, who, when first the foul&#xD;
deed was discovered, when the bleeding body&#xD;
of his wretched victim was brought to light,&#xD;
with barefaced villainy, accused another and&#xD;
an innocent man of the awful deed. That man&#xD;
was then arrested upon the false affidavits of&#xD;
the real culprit, but fortune, who protects&#xD;
the innocent, had directed his footsteps to&#xD;
the residence of one of our most respected&#xD;
citizens where he peacefully remained during&#xD;
the time when the murder must have been&#xD;
committed. That honored citizen, our vener-&#xD;
able friend and colleague, Judge Eben Bates,&#xD;
by his testimony, proved so clearly a case of&#xD;
alibi, that the wrongly-accused was discharg-&#xD;
ed immediately and stands now in this room,&#xD;
ready to bring forth crushing evidence in just&#xD;
defense of himself and to the certain doom of&#xD;
the prisoner at the bar. Although he (the&#xD;
district attorney) might dwell longer on the&#xD;
forthcoming evidence, he found it so clear,&#xD;
and if he might be allowed to say it, so easy&#xD;
a case, that he would yield the floor at once&#xD;
to the witnesses, who would speedily consum-&#xD;
mate the prisoner's conviction and brand him&#xD;
with the disgraceful mark of perjurer, for hav-&#xD;
ing borne false witness against his neighbor&#xD;
to hide his own guilt. His own guilt, gentle-&#xD;
men of the jury, which will shortly be made&#xD;
as clear to the abhorrent sight of man as it is&#xD;
clear at this moment to the frowning eye of&#xD;
God (which was telling).&#xD;
Mr Paradise now arose to admit, without&#xD;
necessitating superfluous evidence, that the&#xD;
deceased had come to his death by violence,&#xD;
and that the dagger found buried in his breast&#xD;
was the instrument by which death had been&#xD;
caused at the hand of the murderer. After&#xD;
examining witnesses of purely technical im-&#xD;
portance, the prosecution called Bella Van&#xD;
Strom.&#xD;
Disdaining to retain her veil, the witness&#xD;
told the court and the jury in a resolute, dis-&#xD;
passionate way, that her deceased husband&#xD;
and the prisoner had been great friends at one&#xD;
time, but that serious altercations had taken&#xD;
place between them shortly before the murder.&#xD;
Also, that the deceased had made a will, be-&#xD;
queathing half of his estate to witness, the&#xD;
other half to Josephine Van Strom, his sister-&#xD;
in-law, to whom the prisoner was engaged to&#xD;
be married, appointing the prisoner trustee&#xD;
and executor of the whole estate. That, sub-&#xD;
sequently, deceased had altered this will, dis-&#xD;
inheriting Josephine Van Strom, and taking&#xD;
from the prisoner the trusteeship. That,&#xD;
finally, and principally at the instigation of&#xD;
witness, deceased had again changed the will&#xD;
in favor of Josephine and the prisoner, and&#xD;
that this final will was made and filed, to the&#xD;
knowledge of the prisoner, on the very day of&#xD;
the murder.&#xD;
Here the district attorney put the question'&#xD;
&#xD;
120&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb  n="-127" xml:id="VAC7268-00000072"/>&#xD;
FORTUNE.&#xD;
&#xD;
" Was not your husband's mind of that&#xD;
wavering, unsettled character, that, in your&#xD;
opinion, the prisoner had reason to fear lest&#xD;
deceased might again revoke the will at some&#xD;
future day?"&#xD;
Mr. Paradise objected to the question. The&#xD;
court, after some pleading, sustained the ques-&#xD;
tion, and Bella answered:--&#xD;
" Undoubtedly."&#xD;
Mr. Paradise bit his lips. After fruitless&#xD;
cross-examination, during which Bella remain-&#xD;
ed imperturbable and entirely impassionate,&#xD;
the prosecution called Antonio Stilletto. The&#xD;
Italian's under-lip quivered so violently that he&#xD;
could scarcely articulate his answers to the&#xD;
questions put. It seemed to require an effort&#xD;
whenever he raised his eyes, and when he&#xD;
succeeded there was a malicious and bold impu-&#xD;
dence in them which resembled the desperate&#xD;
courage of falsehood more than the serenity&#xD;
of truth. Mr. Paradise never took his piercing&#xD;
eyes from him, and the prisoner, who hereto-&#xD;
fore had kept his glance quietly lowered, look-&#xD;
ed full into the face of this witness. Although&#xD;
Stilletto occasionally presented a bold face to&#xD;
the district attorney, judge, and jury, he found&#xD;
it inconvenient to stand this double tire of&#xD;
searching glances, the one suspicious and&#xD;
threatening, the other bitterly reproachful and&#xD;
indignant.&#xD;
Mr. Stilletto repeated boldly what he had&#xD;
already sworn to in his written affidavit, and&#xD;
so terribly telling was his testimony against&#xD;
the prisoner, that the triumphant face of the&#xD;
district attorney, and the loud mutterings&#xD;
around the room compelling the judge to en-&#xD;
force silence, showed Mr. Paradise very clearly&#xD;
that there was no sympathy for his client in&#xD;
that audience. After Mr. Paradise had made&#xD;
the best of a fruitless cross-examination use-&#xD;
lessly hurledCagainst the brazen consistency'&#xD;
of the witnes ,a lawyer residing in the village,&#xD;
to whose lodging John had driven on the last&#xD;
day of his -life, was placed in the witness-&#xD;
box.&#xD;
He had drawn up the last will of the de-&#xD;
ceased, and could testify that the prisoner was&#xD;
cognizant of its provisions, which reinstated&#xD;
him as trustee and again bequeathed half of&#xD;
the estate to prisoner's betrothed wife, Joseph-&#xD;
ine Van Strom. But the most important point&#xD;
to which he deposed, was that he had been&#xD;
present when prisoner and deceased entered&#xD;
the wagon to return to Van Strom's house.&#xD;
Deceased handed prisoner a dagger, with the&#xD;
words-"You had better carry this. It is&#xD;
.near dark, and if we are stopped, you are bet-&#xD;
ter able to use it than I."&#xD;
" Can you swear that it was the same dag-&#xD;
ger which is now in court?" asked Mr. Para-&#xD;
dise. The witness could not swear that it was,&#xD;
but thought it was the same.&#xD;
" Leave your opinions at home," said the&#xD;
hunchback, angrily.&#xD;
" Not at all," interrupted the district attor-&#xD;
ney. "Opinions regarding ocular observations&#xD;
are admissible as evidence."&#xD;
" There is no proof that the daggers are&#xD;
identical," said Mr. Paradise, " and I beg your&#xD;
honor and the gentlemen of the jury, not to&#xD;
forget this flaw in the prosecution."&#xD;
&#xD;
127&#xD;
&#xD;
The district attorney begged the privilege&#xD;
of recalling Bella Van Strom, and she identi-&#xD;
fied the dagger in court as that which her hus-&#xD;
had taken with him when he left the house&#xD;
before the murder.&#xD;
"Now   then," said the district attorney,&#xD;
with a bow, " I am only surprised that so&#xD;
eminent a lawyer should advance such trifling&#xD;
quibbles in court. Here we have proof that&#xD;
the dagger which deceased took with him is&#xD;
identical with that which pierced his heart,&#xD;
Here again we have proof that deceased, half&#xD;
an hour before the murder was committed,&#xD;
handed a dagger to the only man known to&#xD;
have been present at the time of the murder.&#xD;
Is this enough ?"&#xD;
"pNo," said Mr. Paradise; "fbr the prisoner&#xD;
had another dagger, unspotted by blood, in his&#xD;
possession a few moments after the murder.&#xD;
This was the dagger which deceased handed&#xD;
him at the village, and that which Van Strom&#xD;
originally took with him, and which is now in&#xD;
court, he must have exchanged for the one&#xD;
which he gave to the prisoner. This is the&#xD;
theory which makes proof impossible "&#xD;
"It is too thin, Mr. P.," said the district&#xD;
attorney, sneeringly. "This theory of yours&#xD;
is indeed too thin."&#xD;
" We will see how thin it is when we got&#xD;
well into the defense," replied Mr. Paradise ;&#xD;
but he knew, as well as every one present, that&#xD;
the prosecution had as strong a case as can&#xD;
well be made of circumstantial evidence ; and&#xD;
all hope seemed lost.&#xD;
Mr. Paradise glanced nervously to the door,&#xD;
and consulted his watch repeatedly before he&#xD;
opened for the defense. He knew what the&#xD;
impatience on all faces around meant. He&#xD;
knew that judge and jury had already con-&#xD;
demned his client; but it was now his object&#xD;
to protract the trial, for what purpose we shall&#xD;
soon see, and he made a long and able speech.&#xD;
In the first place, he said, that he would&#xD;
admit the motive for the murder, just as he or&#xD;
any one else must admit the occurrence of mil-&#xD;
lions of similar temptations in life; but he&#xD;
meant to bring witnesses who would testify&#xD;
so strongly to the prisoner's good character&#xD;
that it would appear self-evident how far even&#xD;
the thought of a dastardly crime must have&#xD;
been from his mind.&#xD;
Secondly, it was his purpose to show that&#xD;
Stilletto was a liar, a villain, and a perjurer, a&#xD;
vagabond adventurer living on his wits, and a&#xD;
perfectly reckless man ; and that this was a&#xD;
conspiracy against the innocent, a vile scheme&#xD;
to exculpate the real murderer. Mr. Paradise&#xD;
had taken a bold stand, and he would have&#xD;
met derision at every turn had not his 'elo-&#xD;
quence, his power of mind and will made a&#xD;
deep impression upon his hearers. The judge&#xD;
grew nervous, the jury opened their eyes&#xD;
wider, and the audience strained every sense&#xD;
to hear and understand.&#xD;
"Your honor," said the hunchback, " I repeat&#xD;
that I mean to show this Stilletto to be a per-&#xD;
jured scoundrel, a vagabond, and a villain well&#xD;
known in New York, and I advise the sheriff&#xD;
to keep his eye on him, for he will be wanted&#xD;
very much, when this trial is closed, and I amn&#xD;
sure he will not be here then if he is allowed&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb  n="128" xml:id="VAC7268-00000073"/>&#xD;
GOING AND SON.&#xD;
&#xD;
a chance to escape." Under the spell of the&#xD;
hunchback's eloquence, the sheriff actually&#xD;
sent his deputy to find Stilletto; but he had&#xD;
already vanished.&#xD;
Mr. Paradise continued:&#xD;
" I mean to show that his testimony, which&#xD;
is the main reliance of the learned district at-&#xD;
torney, is false-false as malice can dictate,&#xD;
false as cunning can invent, false as brazen de-&#xD;
ceit can utter, false as the fiend of hell, backed&#xD;
up by all his hellish array, could make it, if he&#xD;
stood in the place of that vile man."&#xD;
Then followed a sketch of the incidents of&#xD;
that day, with all of which the reader is famil-&#xD;
iar, and showed from them, and the position of&#xD;
the wagon, horse, and corpse, that a third party&#xD;
must have been engaged in the deed, so that&#xD;
the assertion that the prisoner was the only&#xD;
man known to have been present, fails of sig-&#xD;
nificance.&#xD;
" By what witnesses do you mean to assail&#xD;
Stilletto's character so as to cast doubts on his&#xD;
testimony?" asked the district attorney.&#xD;
" If I can not do it, sir, my case is a weak&#xD;
one," replied Mr. Paradise, confidently.&#xD;
"I understand that you have subpoenaed&#xD;
Judge Bates," said the district attorney.&#xD;
" I have."&#xD;
The first witness called for the defense now&#xD;
made his way to the box. He was an old gentle-&#xD;
man, with an air of dignity and refinement&#xD;
that commanded attention and respect.&#xD;
"What is your name ?" asked Mr. Paradise.&#xD;
" Charles William Going."&#xD;
- " You reside in New York ?"&#xD;
"Yes, sir."&#xD;
"And what is your business ?"&#xD;
" A merchant, sir."&#xD;
"Do you know the prisoner at the bar ?"&#xD;
"I know him very well." And then fol-&#xD;
lowed a brief account of our hero's parentage,&#xD;
standing and character, which caused all pres-&#xD;
ent to feel a new interest in the accused.&#xD;
The impression left by the district attorney,&#xD;
when he pronounced the words, "this is my&#xD;
case," began to change, and the general idea&#xD;
that the prisoner's doom was sealed, gave way&#xD;
to a doubt which increased the excitement and&#xD;
created a feeling of sympathy for our hero.&#xD;
When Mr. Going left the stand, and in an un-&#xD;
ostentatious but hearty manner, shook hands&#xD;
with Montant, the change in the countenances&#xD;
of the jury did not esegpe Mr. Paradise, but&#xD;
he knew better than they, that what had been&#xD;
gained was but the result of his own talents&#xD;
and favorable appearances; he knew that in&#xD;
reality his case was as desperate as ever, and&#xD;
that unless he could make good his bold as-&#xD;
sertions about Stilletto's bad character and&#xD;
perjury-all these outward signs of a favor-&#xD;
able turn would melt under the rigor of the&#xD;
law. Again did he consult his watch, and&#xD;
great impatience seemed to possess him. He&#xD;
glanced at his client, and something like sym-&#xD;
pathy softened his features. He whispered to&#xD;
his associates and his impatience increased to&#xD;
trepidation. At this moment Eben Bates was&#xD;
called, and as he stepped into the box every&#xD;
eye in the room was charmed by his noble&#xD;
and commanding presence ; the intelligence in&#xD;
his face, and the dignity, more pompous than&#xD;
&#xD;
that of Mr. Going, which characterized the&#xD;
man from his venerable locks to his firm&#xD;
planted feet. He was universally known, and&#xD;
everywhere respected. The tongue of suspi.&#xD;
cion had never dared to assail his good name, and&#xD;
he was credited with every trait of character&#xD;
which belongs to a noble, pious, highly culti-&#xD;
vated gentleman. He had sat on the judge's.&#xD;
bench many a year, and he fully understood&#xD;
the importance of a case like this. He looked&#xD;
more like the judge than a witness, and at his&#xD;
presence a hush of involuntary homage fell&#xD;
upon the audience, two only excepted. One&#xD;
was - Mr. Paradise, whose eyes were now&#xD;
kindled and his nostrils expanded, scenting&#xD;
his prey. He knew that the turning point of&#xD;
the case had arrived. From Ernest Montant&#xD;
he had learned the judge's history, and the&#xD;
prisoner himself now lifted his piercing gaze,&#xD;
full of anger and loathing, to that of the proud&#xD;
witness. The old judge caught his glance&#xD;
only once, and then quailed before him and&#xD;
turned deadly pale.&#xD;
" Your honor," said Mr. Paradise, " I would&#xD;
respectfully request you to admonish this&#xD;
witness against the crime of perjury. I may&#xD;
as well here intimate that I know all his&#xD;
secrets, and that it would be unpleasant for&#xD;
him should I reveal them."&#xD;
The district attorney rose angrily, but was&#xD;
involuntarily checked by the change in Eben's&#xD;
face. Already pale, it became livid, the quiv-&#xD;
ering of its muscles changed all its dignity into&#xD;
miserable fear, but he recovered himself so&#xD;
quickly, that probably no one but the two&#xD;
lawyers noticed it.&#xD;
" Hold," cried the old judge, in a loud, clear&#xD;
voice, waving his hand majestically ; "my&#xD;
learned friend, the district attorney, must per-&#xD;
mit me to speak for myself. I am here as a&#xD;
witness only, but I know the law, and I pro-&#xD;
test against counsel attempting to intimidate&#xD;
any witness by subtle threats. Another word&#xD;
of that sort to me, Mr. Paradise, and I shall&#xD;
not open my lips again. I defy the court,&#xD;
with all proper respect, to compel me to testify&#xD;
under such circumstances I"&#xD;
He well knew whom he was addressing,&#xD;
Every eye flashed with indignation against the&#xD;
hunchback ; and as he called on the support of&#xD;
the audience, by a look which contained whole&#xD;
volumes, and with a gesture that waved the&#xD;
judge out of existence, Eben read assurance&#xD;
in the thousand recognizing and sympathizing&#xD;
faces which his fiery eye encountered.&#xD;
"Your honor," he continued, proudly, turn-&#xD;
ing towards the judge, "shall I be respected&#xD;
in this court, or shall I leave the stand?"&#xD;
"Mr. Paradise," said the judge, frowning,&#xD;
"I can not allow browbeating in this court.&#xD;
If you design to coerce this witness, by threat-&#xD;
ening the exposure of such matters as belong&#xD;
to a man's sacred privacy, you must be warned&#xD;
to desist from such practice or lose your&#xD;
witness."&#xD;
Mr. Paradise made a wicked bow, and&#xD;
sneered sardonically. Then he put the ques-&#xD;
tion, plumply,-&#xD;
"Judge Bates, was Stilletto at your hens.&#xD;
at the time the murder was committed ?"&#xD;
The district attorney objected. He saw no&#xD;
&#xD;
128&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb  n="-129" xml:id="VAC7268-00000074"/>&#xD;
FORTUNE.&#xD;
&#xD;
sense in losing time by' compelling witnesses&#xD;
to reiterate what they had previously sworn&#xD;
to in written affidavits, as long as such ques.&#xD;
tions were entirely irrelevant.&#xD;
"The question is not irrelevant," said Mr.&#xD;
Paradise. "1I want to impugn Stilletto's evi-&#xD;
dence against the prisoner.  To that end I&#xD;
must catch him in a previous falsehood."&#xD;
The district attorney answered the argu-&#xD;
ment, the hunchback replied, and both held&#xD;
their original positions with great tenacity ;&#xD;
finally Mr. Paradise, who saw the disadvan-&#xD;
tageous position he occupied, warmed up&#xD;
into such power and eloquence, that every one&#xD;
listened in wonder.&#xD;
Suddenly the lawyer ceased in the midst of&#xD;
his powerful address in support of the question&#xD;
to witness, and his face relaxed into a joyous&#xD;
expression of great satisfaction, as his sharp&#xD;
eyes espied two persons who were forcing&#xD;
their way through the packed audience.&#xD;
During this sudden pause, Judge Bates&#xD;
gathered all his strength. Advancing one&#xD;
foot firmly, he held his head haughtily erect,&#xD;
one hand was uplifted solemnly, his features&#xD;
although bleached by some deadly agitation,&#xD;
were firm set and terribly resolute, his flash-&#xD;
ing eyes seat fear into the hearts of those that&#xD;
confronted him, and his commanding voice&#xD;
rose high above the tumult occasioned by&#xD;
the persistency of those new comers to reach&#xD;
the front.&#xD;
"I will cut short this disgraceful quibble&#xD;
and answer the question voluntarily. Antonio&#xD;
Stilletto was at my house at the time when&#xD;
the murder must have been committed."&#xD;
Instantly the prisoner sprang up. His face,&#xD;
hitherto calm and resolute, showed a rage that&#xD;
knew no bounds.&#xD;
"Eben Bates," he cried, beside himself, and&#xD;
his voice rang in every heart. " Eben Bates,&#xD;
you lie ! and I call upon God this moment&#xD;
that he may strike to the ground that one of&#xD;
us two which has dared to call on Him to wit-&#xD;
ness a falsehood I"&#xD;
For a moment the old judge shook with a&#xD;
passion which seemed equal to crushing the&#xD;
world. With clenched fists and quivering lips&#xD;
he was about to hurl defiance at the unex-&#xD;
pected voice that had so indecorously inter-&#xD;
rupted proceedings, when suddenly a change&#xD;
came over him. As if his heart's pulsations&#xD;
had failed him in the moment of need, as if an&#xD;
electric shock had unnerved him, as if a spel&#xD;
of witchery had fettered his utterance and&#xD;
shattered his frame ; like a tiger who receives&#xD;
the deadly bullet in the moment of his leap&#xD;
like a ship which strikes the jagged rock, just&#xD;
as it is rising proudly to master another billow&#xD;
thus as if God had already heard the voice of&#xD;
the prisoner at the bar, and in answer had&#xD;
sent a thunderbolt to crush the perjurer-he&#xD;
faltered, staggered, and staring as though his&#xD;
eyes would burst from their sockets, was&#xD;
speechless, paralyzed. His brother Martin&#xD;
stood before him!/&#xD;
His brother Martin-in whose glowing eyes&#xD;
he read what soon must be heard by the whole&#xD;
world. His brother Martin-in whose face ha&#xD;
saw the determination which knew no mercy&#xD;
andtoldhinztoo plainly to need words: "Murdei&#xD;
.&#xD;
&#xD;
129&#xD;
&#xD;
breaks all bonds. I am your brother no&#xD;
longer, but your accuser only."&#xD;
The Italian girl stood beside him. Her face&#xD;
wild with excitement, she commenced to speak.&#xD;
Eben knew every word before she articulated&#xD;
a syllable. With the power that comes to us&#xD;
in such moments, God alone knows whence,&#xD;
he read in the souls, of these two new witnesses&#xD;
his inevitable fate. One glance at the faces&#xD;
around him where singular confusion prevailed,&#xD;
a second of time passed (it seemed an age) in&#xD;
which he heard the judge calling order, saw&#xD;
Martin uplifting one lean and withered hand&#xD;
toward him, heard Simonetta's shrieking&#xD;
speech, and he cried in a voice which re-echoed&#xD;
in the breast of every hearer for years after-&#xD;
ward,-&#xD;
" Iconfess my perjury!/ Stiletto was not at&#xD;
my house!/ He is the murderer!"&#xD;
And like an oak struck by the flaming&#xD;
arrow of Heaven, filled by the angel of ven-&#xD;
geance sent by God in answer to the prisoner's&#xD;
cry, he sank to the floor a shattered, lifeless&#xD;
wreck.&#xD;

"I can hardly realize what has occurred."&#xD;
"Tell me about the horrid trial, Ernest."&#xD;

"Was not I right in. securing Paradise ?"&#xD;
asked Josephine, proudly.&#xD;
"I think no one could have defended me&#xD;

"Did you not feel terribly ashamed when&#xD;
you entered the court?" asked Josephine.&#xD;
"No: I felt very serious, as a man upon an&#xD;
errand of life and death would feel. It is the&#xD;
guilt that makes shame. But a shudder came&#xD;
over me at one thought-"&#xD;
"And what was that?"&#xD;
"As I encountered the curious looks of the&#xD;
audience, the stern face of the judge, and the&#xD;
cold, searching row of countenances in the&#xD;
jury box, a grim fancy presented itself to my&#xD;
imagination. How, if at this moment I stood&#xD;
here guilty instead of innocent ? I tell you&#xD;
Josephine, the thought alone   made  me&#xD;
shiver."&#xD;
"But you were innocent-innocent, as I&#xD;
could have told them without that cruel trial&#xD;
had I been the judge!"'&#xD;
" Still," continued Montant, "I knew my&#xD;
danger, knew that Stilletto's testimony had to&#xD;
be disproved, and evidence pointing to him as&#xD;
the murderer had to be procured. And I tell&#xD;
you, Josephine, when Eben Bates broke down&#xD;
at the mere sight of his brother and accused&#xD;
himself as well as Stilletto, I became&#xD;
nearly overpowered.  From the gloom and&#xD;
horror of standing as a murderer before the&#xD;
world, from the awful danger of an ignom.&#xD;
inous death, I found myself in one brief&#xD;
moment saved, and that by an enemy. I&#xD;
was congratulated on all sides; my hands,&#xD;
which just before they had abhorred as&#xD;
blood-staimed, were shaken by a hundred&#xD;
sudden friends, and my innocence was acknowl-&#xD;
edged by acclamation."&#xD;
" It must have been grand I Had I not pro-&#xD;
mised Bella so faithfully to remain at home,&#xD;
I should have been present in spite of her&#xD;
advice and warning."&#xD;
"Scarcely had the old man sunk, a senseless&#xD;
heap, on the floor," continued Montant, with&#xD;
animation, "than the Italian woman rushed&#xD;
forward, and, after imprecating a volun.&#xD;
tary but truly terrifying oath, declared that&#xD;
she had seen Antonio Stilletto not half a mile&#xD;
away from the place of the murder, about the&#xD;
time that the crime was committed, and that&#xD;
he was running at the top of his speed away&#xD;
from the direction of the bridge. This, with&#xD;
the old judge's self-accusation, made too clear&#xD;
a case for doubt, and the jury returned a ver-&#xD;
dict of ' not guilty' without leaving their seats.&#xD;
God knows that those two words were music&#xD;
to me. They brought me back to certainty&#xD;
of life and honor unimpaired and my happy&#xD;
mind reverted instantly to you I"&#xD;
He took her to his heart with emotion, and&#xD;
added, in a low, tender voice,--&#xD;
"And although I positively knew my own&#xD;
innocence, Who was it that stood by me-when&#xD;
I was forsaken, and helpless, in prison, and&#xD;
thought well of me while they were prepari g&#xD;
to hand my name down to disgraceful oblivion?&#xD;
Who watched for me, while Justice slept, and&#xD;
never doubted, never lost faith in me? You&#xD;
did this, Josephine. The woman I love, and&#xD;
who loves me, did it all. God bless herI"&#xD;
It was a solemn moment. A tribute paid by&#xD;
a strong man to the noble loyalty of a woman.&#xD;
She replied by assurances of unbounded fidelity&#xD;
to his loving words of praise, while both felt&#xD;
&#xD;
more confidence in the other from this inci.&#xD;
dent.&#xD;
" And is Stilletto in prison ?" asked Joseph-&#xD;
ine.&#xD;
'-No; he could not be found. He must have&#xD;
escaped quietly when Martin Bates and the&#xD;
Italian girl first approached the court-roon,&#xD;
Paradise had given orders to the officers to&#xD;
keep an eye upon him; but, he succeeded in&#xD;
giving them the slip, though I don't understand&#xD;
how, and he is gone."&#xD;
"I don't like that," said Josephine, anx-&#xD;
iously.&#xD;
" I don't, either," replied Montant, gloomily.&#xD;
At this moment the door opened noiselessly&#xD;
and Bella Van Strom entered. Deep mourning&#xD;
did not become her, and there was nothing&#xD;
fascinating in her pale face. Still she bore an&#xD;
air of calm refinement gained since her mar-&#xD;
riage by contact with the educated world, and&#xD;
not the result of her previous accomplishments.&#xD;
$he had not seen our hero since the trial, and&#xD;
Josephine' showed her apprehensions of an&#xD;
embarassing scene by turning nervously to the&#xD;
fire, and watching the flames with' marked&#xD;
discomfort.&#xD;
Montant immediately arose, and took the&#xD;
proffered hand of Mrs. John Van Strom quite&#xD;
calmly. Bella was equally undemonstrative,&#xD;
and her speech showed more frankness and&#xD;
honesty than warmth of feeling.&#xD;
" I need hardly tell you, Mr. Montant. that&#xD;
I congratulate you with sincerity upon the re-&#xD;
sult of the trial."&#xD;
"Allow me to thank you for your polite-&#xD;
ness," answered our hero, with dignity. " Of&#xD;
course my delight at the result is limited, be-&#xD;
cause I at least could have had no doubt of my&#xD;
ultimate delivery. You also are now convinced&#xD;
of my innocence, and I thank you for bestow.&#xD;
ing upon me the acknowledgment of my un-&#xD;
blemished integrity."&#xD;
Bella looked him straight in the eyes as she&#xD;
rejoined, with imperturbable calmness, -&#xD;
" The reproach contained in your speech is&#xD;
no less pointed for being couched in delicate&#xD;
language. Yet I can not say that I repent my&#xD;
course of action in unflinchingly, perhaps in-&#xD;
considerately, assisting justice in its stern pur-&#xD;
suits. I stand before my husband's fresh-made&#xD;
grave as his sole representative on earth, and&#xD;
surely it becomes me to east away false deli-&#xD;
cacy, and treat the whole world as my enemy&#xD;
until an individual can be found to bear the&#xD;
load of this monstrous guilt. That person&#xD;
probably is now discovered; humanity has&#xD;
again become human in my eyes, and my old-&#xD;
time friends are now friends once more. If&#xD;
you have candor enough to acknowledge that&#xD;
I could not, like this loving heart, divine your&#xD;
innocence and trust to it by inspiration, nor&#xD;
did I accuse you blindly, as I did not blindly&#xD;
acquit you-and if you can pardon me when I&#xD;
make no apology for doing my duty without&#xD;
fear of consequences, then let us shake hands&#xD;
.honestly, and believe me that I am happy to&#xD;
welcome you again to this house."&#xD;
There was more warmth in her last words,&#xD;
and her voice trembled somewhat. Josephine&#xD;
arose, with moist eyes, and held out both her&#xD;
soft hands to her sister-in-law, who took her in&#xD;
&#xD;
130&#xD;
&#xD;
her arms and kissed her affectionately. Yet, af-&#xD;
ter good feeling had been restored, it was plain&#xD;
to both of them that the newly-made widow had&#xD;
altered. What mental changes were produced&#xD;
by the terrible shock, what work a review of&#xD;
her past life, accompanied by humiliation and&#xD;
perhaps remorse, had accomplished, besides&#xD;
the ravages of her great grief, let psycholo-&#xD;
gists determine; but no longer was there any&#xD;
of the sprightliness or vivacity, once so notice-&#xD;
able in her manner; with her husband's death&#xD;
the light within her soul had been extinguish-&#xD;
ed, and she sat in the darkness of the tomb,&#xD;
cold and emotionless as a statue.&#xD;
"I wish to speak to you about a matter&#xD;
which it becomes me to broach," said Bella,&#xD;
after awhile. " I can imagine that both of&#xD;
you intend to postpone your wedding, perhaps&#xD;
for months, on account of me; but I must not&#xD;
allow any such consideration. Life is so closely&#xD;
interwoven with death, that we calculate in&#xD;
vain upon any respite, even in the circle of our&#xD;
nearest friends, from the dreadful monster.&#xD;
Therefore, I consider it man's duty and wo-&#xD;
man's wisdom to get married while they can,&#xD;
and not wait until another summons may sever&#xD;
you, perhaps, forever."&#xD;
Josephine glanced timidly at her lover, who&#xD;
said, quietly,-" You are perfectly right."&#xD;
" Then, when shall it be, since'it seems that&#xD;
I must arrange for you?" asked Bella.&#xD;
"We will dutifully consider the question,"&#xD;
answered our hero, "and report to-morrow.&#xD;
There is one obstacle, though."&#xD;
"What ?" cried Josephine, with a start.&#xD;
" Until I have a business, 1 can not support&#xD;
a wife."&#xD;
"Such a scruple, it seems to me, is out of&#xD;
place," said Bella. " You are sole executor of&#xD;
our estate, are you not?"&#xD;
"Yes; since my acquittal, I am restored to&#xD;
that duty; that is, your lamented husband, at&#xD;
my request, appointed Mr. Paradise my col-&#xD;
league, to share the responsibility vith me."&#xD;
" True !" said Bella. I had forgotten that.&#xD;
At all events, our wealth is large; is it not,&#xD;
Mr. Montant ?"&#xD;
"I think," said Montant, with a strange hes-&#xD;
itancy, which betrayed his aversion to the sub-&#xD;
ject, " I think that the estate might safely be&#xD;
estimated at a value of two millions of dollars.&#xD;
For generations back, your husband's ancestors&#xD;
habitually invested their surplus income in&#xD;
real estate, in and around New York City.&#xD;
This property has increased in value rapidly,&#xD;
and prices are now advancing fabulously, so I&#xD;
may venture the opinion, that, at no distant&#xD;
day, the sum I have mentioned, as the present&#xD;
cash value, will be largely increased."&#xD;
" Then, why do you not devote your entire&#xD;
time to the administration of this property ?"&#xD;
asked Bella. " I suppose that the law allows&#xD;
a trustee a sufficient percentage to insure you&#xD;
a good living, and, in my ignorance of business,&#xD;
I do not see what more lucrative pursuit a man&#xD;
can follow, than taking care of a very rich&#xD;
wife's property. I do not pretend to give any&#xD;
advice; but since you intend to marry Joseph-&#xD;
ine, you can not well leave her property be-&#xD;
hind, and I can not see any cormmron sense inr&#xD;
refusing to let well-enough alone. Our prop-.&#xD;
&#xD;
erty requires some one's undivided attention,&#xD;
and, were I in your place, I should be satisfied&#xD;
with filling that post."&#xD;
"I suppose I will have to come to it!1" said&#xD;
Montant, not at all delighted with the pros-&#xD;
pect.&#xD;
"Really," cried Bella, "I am beginning to&#xD;
lose all confidence in the wisdom of the strong-&#xD;
er sex i They devote all their best energies&#xD;
to the acquisition of money, and here I find&#xD;
you accepting a million of dollars as if it were&#xD;
a bitter pill, as hard to swallow as any sour-&#xD;
faced druggist could make it I"&#xD;
" You are right, Mrs. Van Strom, but there&#xD;
is one thing you leave out of consideration. It&#xD;
is manly pride ! It is not so much the posses.&#xD;
sion as the making of wealth which delights&#xD;
us! I came to this country poor enough to&#xD;
accept, with thanks, the lowest situation that-&#xD;
would gain me my daily bread, and suddenly,&#xD;
from no merit of mine, from no work, no hard&#xD;
struggle, I find myself with a million of dol-&#xD;
lars on my hands. This wealth I receive from&#xD;
a woman-a woman I love, it is true, but&#xD;
whose care and support would make me a&#xD;
happy and contented man. I now receive, as&#xD;
a gift, what I intended to work for, and  my&#xD;
ambition is gone, my strength wasted, and m'y&#xD;
pride humbled !"&#xD;
Josephine felt hurt at this strong language,&#xD;
and it was not immediately that peace reigned&#xD;
among the trio. She could not understand&#xD;
how ie could aspire to any thing beyond her&#xD;
love and the means to enjoy it in comfort and.&#xD;
luxury. And she had plumed herself not a&#xD;
little on being able to give him all this wealth,&#xD;
and to say that he need not work and plan and&#xD;
contrive and worry about "down town,"-&#xD;
which phrase represented to her mind some&#xD;
wonderful method by which ships, hogsheads,&#xD;
and bales produced endless labor and sour&#xD;
faces at home.&#xD;
At this pause in the conversation, Bella's&#xD;
thoughts reverted once more to her own at-&#xD;
fairs, and the hard look settled again around&#xD;
her expressive mouth.&#xD;
" Mr. Montant, I would thank you to cause&#xD;
a reward to be offered for the arrest of Anto-&#xD;
nio Stilletto, the murderer of my husband."&#xD;
h low much shall I make it ?  I suppose&#xD;
we had better simply give notice to the de-&#xD;
tective department in -New York. Money is&#xD;
the oil to grease that machinery, and a reward&#xD;
is the whetstone which sharpens a detective's&#xD;
wits."&#xD;
" Very well, how much shall we offer those&#xD;
gentlemen ?"&#xD;
"I would say, five thousand dollars," said&#xD;
ho, after reflection. " It is a large amount;&#xD;
but I think you desire me to advise you on&#xD;
the safe side."&#xD;
" Double it," said Bella, between her teeth.&#xD;
"I can scarcely sanction that," ventured&#xD;
our hero.&#xD;
"Ten thousand is the reward," said Bella,&#xD;
savagely.&#xD;
" Bella!I" cried Josephine, approaching her&#xD;
with an imploring gesture, "the wrong you&#xD;
have suffered is great, the crime committed is&#xD;
uappallimmg; but remember that God has brand-&#xD;
ed revenge as a crime, that-"&#xD;

&#xD;
GOING AND SON.&#xD;
&#xD;
"I am not seeking revenge," interrupted&#xD;
Bella. "Revenge and justice are as tar apart&#xD;
as hatred from well-grounded aversion, steal-&#xD;
ing from prudence, superstitious bigotry from&#xD;
religion. The one is from heaven, the other&#xD;
from hell. I seek but justice.-Ten thousand&#xD;
is the reward, Mr. Montant I"&#xD;
" As you wish."&#xD;
When Bella had left the room, Josephine&#xD;
burst into tears.&#xD;
" Oh, she is so changed--so changedI Her&#xD;
heart is not broken! It is worse, much worse;&#xD;
it is turned into stone I"&#xD;
Montant soothed and comforted her, and&#xD;
they finally began discussing a secret and se-&#xD;
rious affair-the name of Going &amp;amp; Son was&#xD;
mentioned, and a consultation followed about&#xD;
some great things they intended to accom-&#xD;
plish.&#xD;
*      *      *      *      *      *&#xD;
On a dismal, rainy, nasty day in March, Er-&#xD;
nest Montant arrived, in a very bad humor, at&#xD;
the New Haven railroad depot, in New York&#xD;
City, from Boston. He was tired and hungry,&#xD;
and, to add to his discomfort, he got wet&#xD;
through before he had time to select the least&#xD;
villainous-looking from among the hackdrivers,&#xD;
who surrounded him like fierce hyenas fight-&#xD;
ing for their prey. He directed the driver to&#xD;
convey him to Delmonico's. At the sight of&#xD;
the luxury, characterizing the place, he real-&#xD;
ized, for the first time, that he had plenty of&#xD;
money, and ordered a bottle of champagne&#xD;
with his dinner, which extravagance .afforded&#xD;
him neither pleasure nor remorse, and he sea-&#xD;
soned his sumptuous repast with a train of&#xD;
thought, not calculated to improve the flavor&#xD;
of the fish or the condition of the Stilton.&#xD;
" I suppose that I am a fool for not feeling&#xD;
as happy as a king," he soliliquized, shoving&#xD;
away an unoffending dish in a manner which&#xD;
impressed the bland waiter with the idea that&#xD;
" Monsieur is either an aristocrat or an upstart."&#xD;
"As 1 look around me, I see care and anx-&#xD;
iety peeping out on every face, in spite of the&#xD;
assumed cheerfulness, while 1, suddenly raised&#xD;
from a suspected murderer to the possessor&#xD;
of a million of dollars, a lovely wife, excellent&#xD;
health, untainted honor, and, on the whole, a&#xD;
tolerably good conscience. What more is&#xD;
there for me to covet ?"&#xD;
Such questions he asked himself, and in-&#xD;
stead of answering them, he reverted again&#xD;
and again, like a woman, to the words, " And&#xD;
yet I am not happy. What is there left for&#xD;
my ambition? What pleasure can I expect&#xD;
Trom labor during the smooth and luxurious&#xD;
life I see before me. I will write," he mutter-&#xD;
ed fiercely, as he dashed out the last of the&#xD;
champagne into his glass. "I will become&#xD;
an author or something of that sort. I could&#xD;
begin as an editor and work my way up, I&#xD;
know. Something I must have to aspire to&#xD;
beyond mere good luck, for I am now at the&#xD;
top of the wheel without having earned a&#xD;
cent of my wealth, or really deserved a kiss&#xD;
from my Venus."&#xD;
Mr. Ernest Montant, you, too, have a skel-&#xD;
eton in the house. You have a thought, a&#xD;
desire, a secret hope. you would fain hide even&#xD;
from yourself.&#xD;
&#xD;
FORTUNE.&#xD;
&#xD;
The contemplation of his own breast sought&#xD;
utterance in the most distorted philosophy,&#xD;
and rather than dwell upon and acknowledge to&#xD;
himself the truth, he preferred a general&#xD;
grumbling at all destiny had bestowed. lie&#xD;
had come to New York, not only on important&#xD;
business relative to the Van Strom estate, not&#xD;
only to confer with Mr. Paradise, his co-ex-&#xD;
ecutor, but also to pay a visit at a house in&#xD;
Fifth Avenue, whither his heart drew him&#xD;
irresistibly. He had not seen the old gentle.&#xD;
man since the day of the trial, after which he&#xD;
had returned home without giving Montant a&#xD;
chance for a conversation. Things were not&#xD;
improving with Going &amp;amp; Son, the firm was&#xD;
faring badly, very badly ; the world knew it&#xD;
and Montant knew it, and Mr. Going was too&#xD;
proud to seek the sympathy and consolation&#xD;
of a man who had left him in the hour of&#xD;
need, nor had made any advances since that&#xD;
time.&#xD;
Tlis very night he had determined to call&#xD;
on his old friends. le lingered a full hour&#xD;
over his coffee, and had a long argument with&#xD;
himself. Perhaps the skeleton stood out in&#xD;
bolder relief, warning him-perhaps his coin.&#xD;
men sense gained the victory-at all events,&#xD;
lie determined to wait a few days before grati.&#xD;
fying himself with the promised visit, anld&#xD;
suddenly called for pen, ink, and paper, and&#xD;
wrote the following letter to Mrs. Bella Van&#xD;
Strom:&#xD;
"Although the result of our recent consul-&#xD;
tation was a determination on my part, to&#xD;
(kvote my whole time to the. adnuistrtio&#xD;
of the estate, more mature considerations have&#xD;
determined me to re-enter business. My rea-&#xD;
sons you will readily dicern when you reflect&#xD;
upon what you know of my character.-&#xD;
'I desire to join the firm of my late employ-&#xD;
ers-Messrs. Going &amp;amp; Son-and it is my in-&#xD;
tention to ask Josephine for a special capital&#xD;
to invest in the house. If they are willing to&#xD;
accept me, I shall examine the present stand-&#xD;
ing .of the firm before concluding any arrange-&#xD;
ment, because I would not willingly risk Jo.&#xD;
sephins money. In the matter of deternin-&#xD;
ing the safety of the investment, I feel perfect&#xD;
confidence in my own ability and honesty of&#xD;
purpose, and I write you on the subject be-&#xD;
cause I desire your sanction of so important a&#xD;
step, and because your approval and encourage-&#xD;
ment would be a pledge of our future mutual&#xD;
confidence and good understanding."&#xD;
After finishing this letter, he wrote a long&#xD;
epistle to Josephine, full of love and of his plan&#xD;
to re-enter business as above mentioned.&#xD;
After a few days he received a reply from&#xD;
Josephine, in which, despite all the affection&#xD;
and devotion therein contained, there was a&#xD;
flavor he did not relish. She wrote that, of&#xD;
course, she had no desire but to carry out he&#xD;
part of his plans, no will but his-no arge -&#xD;
ment other than his reasoning-but that&#xD;
Bella had looked sour over his letter to her,&#xD;
and hinted that it was not gratitude alone&#xD;
which impelled him to come to the relief of&#xD;
Messrs. Going &amp;amp; Sen. TIe letter closed with&#xD;
the assurance that the writer had no fear or&#xD;
doubt of hrer lover, but it was not quite as&#xD;
&#xD;
1 3&#xD;
&#xD;
strongly worded as he could wish. What did&#xD;
she mean? Was she jealous?     Could she&#xD;
doubt him? Did the skeleton rattle its&#xD;
bones?&#xD;
On the same day he received the following-&#xD;
lines from Bella :-&#xD;
"SIR:-I will reply to your favor in a busi-&#xD;
ness tone, for it was a business letter. I take&#xD;
the liberty of saying that I do not sanction&#xD;
your enterprise at all; but, on the contrary,&#xD;
from what I know of the extravagance of a cer-&#xD;
tain family, I have no confidence in the safety&#xD;
of a certain firm. I trust that you will not&#xD;
permit your judgment to be biassed by a grat-&#xD;
itude, the causes for which I acknowledge&#xD;
are not quite clear to my inexperienced mind,&#xD;
and I respectfully inform you that, should&#xD;
your resolution remain unchanged, and you&#xD;
form new ties, I would prefer the whole es-&#xD;
tate to be wound up as soon as possible, the&#xD;
division made, and the control of my portion&#xD;
be left to me alone.&#xD;
" Before I close, and having said what I&#xD;
had to say, I must assure you of more friend-&#xD;
ship than these lines may convey at present.&#xD;
"I remain, truly yours,&#xD;
"BELLA VAN STRoM."&#xD;
Montant read it twice, and pondered over&#xD;
it contents for hours in a brown study, biting&#xD;
his lips more than once.&#xD;
CHAPTER    VIII.&#xD;
SAVED.&#xD;
"I am not of that feather to shake off&#xD;
My friend when he most ide ne."&#xD;
Tusos of ATIIENS.&#xD;
His own resolve, alone, and contrary to such&#xD;
advice as he had solicited, made him do it.&#xD;
When matters connected with the estate&#xD;
brought him back to spend a day in Massa-&#xD;
chusetts, Josephine, in an interview which&#xD;
marked their first difference of opinion, had&#xD;
departed somewhat from the tone of her first&#xD;
letter, and employed all her powers to dissuade&#xD;
him from an alliance which she dreaded-why&#xD;
she knew not, but she had said to him,---&#xD;
"Take what money you choose, and help'&#xD;
them, By so doing, you satisfy all the claims&#xD;
of friendship and gratitude; but do not form&#xD;
a connection which must more or less alienate&#xD;
you from Bella certainly, and perhaps from&#xD;
me."&#xD;
" They can not take the money, unless I, my-&#xD;
self, bring it into the firm," was the answer;&#xD;
and his resolution remained unaltered. On his&#xD;
return .to New York, he had consulted Mr.&#xD;
Paradise, who said, with a sneer, that such&#xD;
instances of gratitude were rare in the world,&#xD;
and coolly added, that he would make an ass of&#xD;
himself if he persisted.&#xD;
So his own resolve alone made him do -it.&#xD;
He approached the house. Uncertainty,&#xD;
fear of a hundred things, had kept him from&#xD;
making a visit sooner. They knew that he&#xD;
was coming. A card, sent up by him during&#xD;
&#xD;
the day, had advised them of his intention;&#xD;
yet now, that it was evening, his mind fluc-&#xD;
tuated between resolution and hesitancy.&#xD;
"I know not why a strife seems to be going&#xD;
on in my breast," he murmured, walking&#xD;
faster. "Something tells me that I am about&#xD;
to do the best action of my whole life, and yet&#xD;
I have a foreboding of danger. Well, what&#xD;
generosity dictates, and conscience sanctions,&#xD;
can not be wrong, and nothing but cowardice&#xD;
hinders its fulfillment." Again his thoughts&#xD;
recurred to Josephine's view of the case, and&#xD;
when the well-known house loomed up in his&#xD;
sight, he experienced a sensation which did&#xD;
not altogether contradict the lovely widow's&#xD;
jealous uneasiness. " But what matters it&#xD;
all?" soliloquized our hero, as he rang the&#xD;
bell. "I shall marry Josephine next month,&#xD;
and I do not see what difference it can make&#xD;
if I happen to meet what I might call an old&#xD;
fame ! Remote, indeed, from me, is any feel-&#xD;
ing for Jessie Going, other than friendshipI"&#xD;
In the meanwhile Miss Jessie Going waa alone&#xD;
in the parlor, and she listened to every footstep&#xD;
on the sidewalk. Her heart throbbed quicker&#xD;
when some step approached the .house, and&#xD;
when it had passed the door, to die away again,&#xD;
relapsed into resigned patience. For many a&#xD;
weary month this had been the first happy day&#xD;
to her. That name on the card hid inspired&#xD;
her with a hope, which must be referred to&#xD;
intuition as a-cause, that the promised visit&#xD;
might perhaps open the way through a recon-&#xD;
ciliation between her father and our hero, to&#xD;
the renewed acquisition of his inestimable (so&#xD;
she thought) advice and assistance in her&#xD;
father's business.  He was engaged to be&#xD;
married. This she knew; but that made no&#xD;
difference. Had she not told her father that&#xD;
the girlish fancy she once betrayed had been&#xD;
effaced by the serious, alt-absorbing struggles&#xD;
which the family had undergone ? The feeling&#xD;
which now made her listen to every sound in&#xD;
the street, was nothing akin to love. Oh, no!&#xD;
only friendship, and anxiety for her father.&#xD;
But how could he assist-&#xD;
Here the bell rang; with a smothered ex-&#xD;
clamation, she sprang to her feet. The hall&#xD;
door is opened by the servant, while Jessie&#xD;
stands, holding her breath, and clasping her&#xD;
hands, her composure gone, though she knew&#xD;
it not.  She hears a familiar voice, and a&#xD;
familiar tread approaches the parlor door.&#xD;
She rushes forward, unconscious of her haste.&#xD;
She beholds him coming rapidly toward her,&#xD;
and a warm blush overspreading her beautiful&#xD;
face, she holds out both hands to him, unable&#xD;
to utter a word.&#xD;
He has her hands in his; he sees the color&#xD;
rising from her fluttering heart; he looks into&#xD;
her eyes, moist with tears, and unstrung,&#xD;
overpowered by the old influence of her pres-&#xD;
ence, and by her emotion, which strikes home&#xD;
to his heart's core, he presses her hand to his&#xD;
lips, and then turning suddenly away, clenches&#xD;
his fist, and bites his lips savagely. At the&#xD;
movement, her color fled. What her face be-&#xD;
trayed while his eyes were averted from her&#xD;
he know not ; but when, after an immense&#xD;
effort, he again turned to her, sire was pale,&#xD;
and calm, and stately.&#xD;
&#xD;

GOING AND SON.&#xD;
&#xD;
"I am truly glad to see you, Mr. Montant,"&#xD;
she said, and invited him to take a chair, by&#xD;
seating herself with the air of a princess.&#xD;
"What an absurdity it is in me," she quietly&#xD;
thought to herself, "to get into such aflutter!&#xD;
Did I not tell papa that he is no more than a&#xD;
friend to me now? And I know I spoke the&#xD;
truth when I said it !" But how now, Jessie&#xD;
Going?&#xD;
" This is contemptible in me," soliloquized&#xD;
Ernest Montant, at the same time. "An en-&#xD;
gaged man can greet a sweet friend without&#xD;
acting first like a lover, and then like a fool,&#xD;
I hope! There shall be no repetition of this&#xD;
scene !" Are you certain of that Ernest Mon-&#xD;
tant?&#xD;
While both were holding these secret con-&#xD;
versations, a few every-day commonplaces&#xD;
passed between them to prevent embarrass-&#xD;
ment, and Miss Going's father entered, and&#xD;
shaking our hero by the hand, said, heartily,-&#xD;
"So we have you back again at least for one&#xD;
evening, you runaway! Welcome here, my&#xD;
dear friend! Forgotten be the past, and the&#xD;
future untroubled while we make the best of&#xD;
the present."&#xD;
Montant heard the voice with a pang. It&#xD;
was not soafull and ringing as of old. Age&#xD;
and sorrow had weakened its full vibration,&#xD;
while furlrowing his venerable brow, and&#xD;
bowing down the proudly erect form of-the&#xD;
merchant.&#xD;
"Mr. Going," said our hero, after the first&#xD;
greetings had been exchanged, "although I am&#xD;
delighted at seeing you all again, after so long&#xD;
a separation, I may as well acknowledge at&#xD;
once that I have not come on an errand of&#xD;
pleasure only. I much desire to have a&#xD;
business talk with you and Walter, if Miss&#xD;
Going will excuse us. I would respectfully&#xD;
suggest that we get.over the laborious part of&#xD;
my visit as soon as convenient to you."&#xD;
The old gentleman's face assumed a more&#xD;
troubled expression, as lie at once assented,&#xD;
and led the way down stairs, to the library,&#xD;
where our hero had been on more than one&#xD;
occasion. This was the room where lie had&#xD;
taken leave of his employer, and as he entered&#xD;
it again, and considered the difference in his&#xD;
circumstances, between then and now, he felt&#xD;
perhaps for the first time, the proud conscious-&#xD;
ness of power which is conferred by the&#xD;
possession of wealth.&#xD;
Jessie remained alone in the parlor. She&#xD;
heard Walter inquiring of the servant where&#xD;
Mr. Montant had gone ; she heard him de-&#xD;
scending the stairs; and through the opening&#xD;
library door the hearty words of welcome&#xD;
reached her ears. She laid her head on her&#xD;
hands, and became lost in thought.&#xD;
*    *    *    *    *    *    *&#xD;
"And now," said Mr. Going, after having&#xD;
related what had occurred in the firm while&#xD;
Montant had been away, " I have voluntarily&#xD;
given you an account of the past, and you can&#xD;
now see what an infamous intrigue it was into&#xD;
which I was coaxed. You see how our Board&#xD;
of Trustees, composed of some of the first&#xD;
merchants of New York, proved to be the&#xD;
very worst selection that could have been&#xD;
made. Respectability is one thing, work is&#xD;
&#xD;
quite another, and no benefit arises from pro.&#xD;
curing big-sounding names, when their owners&#xD;
have not the time to attend to their business.&#xD;
These high-toned gentlemen left every thing&#xD;
in the hands of Fatman, and Fatman has&#xD;
ruined me. Even without Stilletto, who for-&#xD;
sook his post at the factory some months ago;&#xD;
even after the perfect fiasco which that&#xD;
scoundrel made of the manufacturing portion&#xD;
of the business, there was no reason why a&#xD;
sufficient amount should not have been real.&#xD;
ized out of the company's property to make an&#xD;
honorable settlement with the shareholders,&#xD;
and to leave me enough to discharge my&#xD;
pressing liabilities. As it is, Fatman sold his&#xD;
shares secretly, and many of the -trustees were&#xD;
enabled by him to do the same, on the strength&#xD;
of a dividend which he caused to be declared,&#xD;
and which created a short-lived demand for&#xD;
the stock. I could not sell any of my interest,&#xD;
because it was all pledged to Mr. Chip, as se-&#xD;
curity for his loan of two hundred thousand&#xD;
dollars, and as soon as the public began to&#xD;
suspect that the dividend was paid with&#xD;
borrowed money, and not from the legitimate&#xD;
earnings, the  stock depreciated almost to&#xD;
nothing, and I finally resolved to commence a&#xD;
suit against the company, which suit is now&#xD;
pending, and does not look unfavorable for us,&#xD;
In the meanwhile--"&#xD;
" In the meanwhile," cried Walter. " In&#xD;
the meanwhile, we must fail !"&#xD;
It was an ugly word, and familiar as was&#xD;
its import to Mr. Going, our hero saw him&#xD;
wince at the sound. He contemplated the old&#xD;
gentleman's countenance, and reflected upon&#xD;
the humiliation it must be to him to acknowl-&#xD;
edge now, and in this very room, to him, what&#xD;
he as a young clerk had predicted last year.&#xD;
Terribly true was the prophecy the gray-haired&#xD;
merchant had disregarded ! At the last speech&#xD;
of Walter's, Montant asked, eagerly,--&#xD;
"There is an end to delicacy, Mr. Going,&#xD;
and since I know this much. I would thank&#xD;
you to answer me a few questions ?"&#xD;
" Ask away," cried Walter, in despair, walk-&#xD;
ing up and down the room. " If father does&#xD;
not answer you, I will."&#xD;
" What, then, is the immediate cause of your&#xD;
embarrassment ?"&#xD;
" The notes which you will remember the&#xD;
company gave us for our merchantable prop-&#xD;
erty have now been twice renewed, and the&#xD;
last time Fatman promised me faithfully they&#xD;
should be paid."&#xD;
"But he did not pledge himself personally&#xD;
to their redemption ?" interposed Montant.&#xD;
"Of course not," answered Walter, bitterly.&#xD;
"I'll give that man a thrashing yet, some&#xD;
day !"&#xD;
"Well, and these notes, Mr. Going?'"&#xD;
"These notes, sir, are due day after to-mor-&#xD;
row," answered Mr. Going, despondently, "and&#xD;
this afternoon, in spite of a thousand fair prom-&#xD;
ises which he made to me before I instituted&#xD;
the suit against the company-this afternoon,&#xD;
sir, I received word from Fatman that, under&#xD;
the circumstances, meaning the law-suit, the&#xD;
company did not feel inclined to pay the&#xD;
notes, and that even if they had felt so inclin.-&#xD;
ed, there was not a cent in the exchequer."&#xD;
&#xD;
134&#xD;
&#xD;
"Then the company will break."&#xD;
"And we, with it. I have borrowed money&#xD;
upon those notes, and if they are not paid,&#xD;
the lenders will come back on us, and I can&#xD;
not pay. There is no sense in attempting to&#xD;
work through. My shares will be worth ab-&#xD;
solutely, nothing. Mr. Chip will lose a large&#xD;
suim, and the trustees will have to content&#xD;
themselves with what they have made out of,&#xD;
it. So far, I am perfectly certain that Fatman&#xD;
has realized a great deal of money ; but why&#xD;
he has assumed such a hostile position toward&#xD;
me-why he appears to have forgotten all his&#xD;
former friendship, and is determined to ruin&#xD;
me, I do not know, I am sure."&#xD;
"I know," cried Walter. " He was always&#xD;
jealous of us, and I believe Mrs. Fatmnan has&#xD;
urged him on, because on some occasions I did&#xD;
not feel inclined to be quite as attentive to her&#xD;
as she was graciously inclined to permit."&#xD;
" He certainly grudged me the Priory,"&#xD;
continued his father, without appearing to&#xD;
notice the import of Walter's words, "and be-&#xD;
sides he has shrewdly stepped into a- great&#xD;
portion of my former business connection in&#xD;
the banking and commission line."&#xD;
"All of which can be recovered from him&#xD;
again," said Montant, quietly.&#xD;
"A beggar is a child in business, no matter&#xD;
how many years of prosperity and mercantile&#xD;
fame have passed over his head," retorted Mr.&#xD;
Going, sorrowfully.&#xD;
"Well, then," said Walter throwing himself&#xD;
into ar arm-chair, "let us give up the ship&#xD;
gracefully. I have struggled the very life out&#xD;
of ne, since you left, Montant, and even if I&#xD;
thought we could stave it off for another six&#xD;
months, I would advise father, in view of the&#xD;
infamous treatment he has received, to declare&#xD;
the truth."&#xD;
" The public," said the old gentleman,&#xD;
" should know how some of our celebrated mer-&#xD;
chants do business, and those gentlemen&#xD;
themselves, should be made to understand the&#xD;
duties of a trustee, aid that it is not doing&#xD;
what the poor shareholders expect of them-&#xD;
to attend one or two meetings, pocket theI&#xD;
price paid- for their great names, and then&#xD;
leave all the management to unscrupulous&#xD;
parties, without consulting the public in the&#xD;
matter."&#xD;
" Mr. Going," said Montant, in the calm,&#xD;
measured voice, he had heard from    him&#xD;
once before in this room, " I can not imagine&#xD;
that your firm is insolvent to-day. Am I&#xD;
right in thinking that with the assistance of a&#xD;
large sum in cash, you could, in all likelihood,&#xD;
arrange matters advantageously with the com-&#xD;
pany, and also save much of your property&#xD;
which I know to be scattered far and wide,&#xD;
from sacrifice."&#xD;
"1 I think that the company still owns much&#xD;
property of actual mercantile value. This I&#xD;
could undoubtedly recover if I could offer to&#xD;
Chip and others a comparatively small amount&#xD;
in cash. Their eyes are now opened, and I&#xD;
think they would consent to lose a large sum&#xD;
for a small cash percentage. Besides, I have&#xD;
hypothecated a good deal of real estate and&#xD;
other property of my own, which, if I could&#xD;
only redeem at once, could be ultimately, well&#xD;
&#xD;
FORTUNE.&#xD;
&#xD;
135&#xD;
&#xD;
sold, waiting my time for disposing of it. But&#xD;
this money I can not raise. It is impossi-&#xD;
ble !"&#xD;
"Father is quite right," growled Walter.&#xD;
" We are not actually insolvent, and yet if we&#xD;
are forced to suspend payment all will go by&#xD;
the board and it will be an ugly failure.&#xD;
Every thing will melt away. for those that own&#xD;
our mortgages will sell for just enough to&#xD;
cover themselves."&#xD;
" Impossible to help it," said the old gentle-&#xD;
man, and when with those words he finished&#xD;
the recital of his trials and present situation,&#xD;
he fell back in his chair the picture of hope-&#xD;
less dejection. Montant felt that it would be&#xD;
inhuman and barbarous cruelty to longer&#xD;
withhold the aid that was at his command.&#xD;
Yet he reflected one moment. Josephine&#xD;
had given him full power, and he was free to&#xD;
act as his consciepce dictated. He reflected&#xD;
whether it was possible that Mr. Going and&#xD;
his son had been over-sanguine in estimating&#xD;
that the firm was not intrinsically insolvent, and&#xD;
he made up his mind that he could take the&#xD;
risk. le arose, stepped up to Mmr. Going, and&#xD;
said, in a voice that trembled  a little at&#xD;
first:-&#xD;
"A year ago, I made a promise to your&#xD;
daughter. I have come to-night to redeem it.&#xD;
Both of you, gentlemen, know of my engage-&#xD;
ment to Josephine Van Strom. After proper&#xD;
consultation with her, I have determined to&#xD;
make yon the offer, that, should you accept&#xD;
me as a partner in your house, I will see the&#xD;
firm through if it cost a hundred or even two&#xD;
hundred thousand dollars."&#xD;
le was a boy no longer, and his face show-&#xD;
ed the change worked by his recent and&#xD;
severe experience. A man who has look-&#xD;
ed death in the face in as cold-blooded shape&#xD;
as he had encountered it in the form of an&#xD;
indictment for murder Is not apt to be timid&#xD;
or to hesitate on assuming a position of power&#xD;
and in calmly asserting it. So be stood before&#xD;
his old principal in a new character as a man&#xD;
to be respected, not alone for the power of&#xD;
the wealth which he wielded, but also for his&#xD;
personal worth.&#xD;
Mr. Going was too much surprised to im-&#xD;
mediately recover his equanimity, while Wal-&#xD;
ter sprang to his feet; and seizing our hero by&#xD;
the hand, exclaimed, with impulsive joy,-&#xD;
" You bring us new life, and we must never&#xD;
be separated any more. You are a noble fel-&#xD;
low, Ernest, and we alone can ever appreciate&#xD;
what you have done for us."&#xD;
" Provided we can accept the offer, inter-&#xD;
posed Mr. Going, in a low voice, in which&#xD;
hope did not speak.&#xD;
"Of course we must accept," said Walter,&#xD;
.impatiently.&#xD;
" We will accept if we are solvent, other-&#xD;
wise, not."&#xD;
" My conviction is, that the capital will be&#xD;
safe," said our hero, quietly. " Of course you&#xD;
would shrink as much from accepting my pro-&#xD;
position, as I v ould be loath to risk another&#xD;
person's capital if there existed any danger for&#xD;
the security of this money. I would suggest&#xD;
that we immediately look inao the condition of&#xD;
your affairs provided you have the requisite&#xD;

A health then once more to the new house of a&#xD;
Going, Montant &amp;amp; Company, and let no one, 0&#xD;
not here present, ever know how great our-&#xD;

At this moment our hero looked up. A S&#xD;
heightened color overspread his face, and in his t&#xD;
eyes there glowed a fire as of a mind made up s&#xD;
and resolute, a heart that has dispelled the&#xD;
clouds of doubt, and conquered in a struggle. h&#xD;
His eyes no more shunned those of the beauti- J&#xD;
ful girl. He seemed to shake off with an im- t&#xD;
patient gesture what hesitancy still encum-i&#xD;
bered the victory he had Wvon, and a warm 1&#xD;
emotion softened his voice, as he said:;-'&#xD;
. And, may I here pledge a health to the&#xD;
woman whose great love for me is the caused&#xD;
of this, to me, unspeakably happy hour.; Let l&#xD;
me ask you all to Join me in remembering&#xD;

danger and tribulation-she, that is as noble&#xD;
aind true as can be born on earth and inspired&#xD;
by heaven, does not deserve to be forgotten,&#xD;
and let me at this time form in her name a tie&#xD;
of friendship and, affection between you andI&#xD;
her."r&#xD;
Cheerfully and heartily did he seek Jessie's&#xD;
eyes, as she joined in the sincere response of&#xD;
the others. She saw that all strife (if strife&#xD;
there had been) had ceased in his strong heart,&#xD;
and impelled by curiosity, or solicitude, or ego-&#xD;
tism, he attempted to read in her face what&#xD;
she thought of it.&#xD;
lie could read nothing.&#xD;
Finally they parted, to meet again to-morrow.&#xD;
A hearty "Good-night," a shaking of hands all&#xD;
around, a half-laughing "Remember our bar-&#xD;
gain as to sisterly affection, Miss Jessie," and&#xD;
he was gone.,&#xD;
"My dear father," said that young lady,&#xD;
when they were alone again in the parlor,&#xD;
" has he brought a sacrifice to us ?"&#xD;
"No," answered Mr. Going. "The money&#xD;
lie will invest is safe in our house. Many&#xD;
wealthy men would have given their sons&#xD;
-much greater sums to invest with me on those&#xD;
terms."&#xD;
"In former times ?" suggested Jessie, wisely.&#xD;
" Yes, but nevertheless he knows full well&#xD;
that his connection with me gives him a stand.&#xD;
ing and position which wealth can rarely buy."&#xD;
' Does he know that ?" asked.Jessie, doubt-&#xD;
fully.-&#xD;
" Most certainly. He has said so, and he is&#xD;
too intelligert not to know it, and too candid&#xD;
not to have meant it."&#xD;
&#xD;
" I am glad of it. I do not like being under&#xD;
obligations to any one," said the young lady, de-&#xD;
dedly, but satisfied.&#xD;
Who is that man walking along the dimly&#xD;
ghted street with a bounding step and a&#xD;
eart as happy as heart can be ? Why does&#xD;
e hold his head so high and feel as if he were&#xD;
,he inferior of no creature on earth? "lie&#xD;
as done his duty, and he can look straight and&#xD;
earlessly into the eyes of all mankind; yes,&#xD;
nd lift his eyes to the eternal heavens with-&#xD;

trom he can look and laugh, telling her the&#xD;
while how he stood by her nobly, who nobly&#xD;

He has broken the spell. His strong will&#xD;
has gained the victory over the witchery of&#xD;
ressie's presence. He has severed the cord&#xD;
hat threatened to tear him away from Joseph-&#xD;
ne, regardless of all that she had done for&#xD;
him, forsaking her like a knave, and leaving&#xD;
her to perdition.&#xD;
No more doubt, no more wavering, no more&#xD;
strife between passion and conscience 1lIe&#xD;
aughed to himself, so light was he at heart,&#xD;
and he wrote a letter to Josephine that night&#xD;
which made her weep with joy.&#xD;
In fact, our hero was excited and delighted&#xD;
with himself, and felt certain that in all human&#xD;
probability his happiness. was assured for a&#xD;
good long comfortable time to come. How,&#xD;
now, Bella Van Strom?&#xD;
Where are your scruples and warnings and&#xD;
predictions and fancies? You did not know&#xD;
this nian when you instilled into Josephine's&#xD;
timid and susceptible soul a fear of that alliance&#xD;
with the Goings. In fact, you have shown&#xD;
yourself to be an unbelieving, suspicious&#xD;
wretch, and were it not that we can excuse&#xD;
you on account of your recent afflictions, the&#xD;
breach ;n our friendship would become irre-&#xD;
parable I&#xD;
So Josephine told her when she perused&#xD;
Moutant's letter, although the lovely widow&#xD;
did not use just those harsh expressions.&#xD;
Bella read the letter, listened calmly to the&#xD;
enthusiastic eulogies which her sister-in-law&#xD;
pronounced on her lover, and retired unfeel-&#xD;
ingly to her room without speaking a word in&#xD;
reply.&#xD;
CHAPTER IX.&#xD;
MONEY.&#xD;
"One business does command us all,&#xD;
For mine is money"&#xD;
TiMON OF ATHENs.&#xD;
THAr creature of modern times, the honest,&#xD;
honorable, and honored merchant, dates from&#xD;
England's rise among the nations of the earth&#xD;
as a commercial power.   Before that day,&#xD;
trade, money-lending, and negotiations of every&#xD;
kind were confined to Jews and people of the&#xD;
lower classes, and such pursuits were despised&#xD;
&#xD;
137&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb  n="138-139" xml:id="VAC7268-00000079"/>&#xD;
138                             GOING&#xD;
and looked down upon by those of gentle&#xD;
breeding, whose ancestry had for generations&#xD;
lived upon the possession of large estates, and&#xD;
gains in foreign wars. But from the time that&#xD;
England began to be counted among the com-&#xD;
mercial nations, of which she now stands at&#xD;
the head, the merchants became a power in&#xD;
the community, a pillar of the State, the pulse&#xD;
of the nation's life, the extenders of civilization&#xD;
and home respectability. And the American&#xD;
merchant is taking a stand which calls forth&#xD;
the bewildered admiration of old Europe, and&#xD;
in New York the American merchant is to be&#xD;
seen in his greatest power and pride. Among&#xD;
these New York merchants Mr. Going had&#xD;
held his head high, and his position was the&#xD;
reward of his untold labor in the.earlier part&#xD;
of his career. And the community knew it,&#xD;
and respected him for it.&#xD;
But to-day he was expected to fail! Mr.&#xD;
Chip said so as he and the other directors of&#xD;
a certain bank had a friendly confab at their&#xD;
regular weekly meeting, at which meeting&#xD;
the wise gray-haired gentlemen are apt to&#xD;
indulge in scandal and gossip to an extent&#xD;
worthy of equally aged worthies of the other&#xD;
sex.&#xD;
Mr. Fatman thought so, and the arrange-&#xD;
ment of "hand-in-hand " with Mr. Going had&#xD;
bean out of his recollection for some time&#xD;
previous. lie was certain "they could not&#xD;
work through" any longer, and he did not at-&#xD;
tempt to assume an expression of wnourning&#xD;
on his half-jovial, half-vicious countenance.&#xD;
There were few that did not know it, and&#xD;
the commercial world in general prepared&#xD;
themselves for the ceremony of mourning the&#xD;
event. Many studied pretty speeches, express-&#xD;
lve of sympathy, and a great lamentation,&#xD;
suited to the former high standing of the&#xD;
house, was everywhere expected, though the&#xD;
future of the bankrupts was to be forgotten, as&#xD;
speedily as possible, just as if it was a ques-&#xD;
tion of the funeral, instead of the failure of&#xD;
Going &amp;amp; Son.&#xD;
The directors of the bank had all assembled,&#xD;
and Mr. Chip had just concluded a feeling&#xD;
speech about his old friend Going, when he&#xD;
exclaimed to the cashier,-&#xD;
"Here is Mr. Going himself. le seems to&#xD;
be coming in; but I suppose it is time for us&#xD;
to adjourn up stairs, is it not, gentlemen ?"&#xD;
So the gentlemanly directors suddenly dis-&#xD;
covered that half-past ten, the hour for their&#xD;
official meeting, had arrived twenty minutes&#xD;
ago, and they adjourned to the room above in&#xD;
some haste.&#xD;
Mr. Going very well understood their spon-&#xD;
taneous exit as he approached. Nearly every&#xD;
one of the directors had once been his personal&#xD;
friends, and now they shunned him like an&#xD;
outcast, since he was known to have lost his&#xD;
money!1&#xD;
The old gentleman had to pause a second,&#xD;
so appalled was he by this heartless affront,&#xD;
and the companion who accompanied him, had&#xD;
to whisper in his ear,-&#xD;
"What they have been to you in the past,&#xD;
they will be again in two short hours. There-&#xD;
fore you have only temporarily lost their&#xD;
contemptible friendship.'&#xD;
&#xD;

Mr. Going recovered himself. Thank God, it&#xD;
was the last bitterness.&#xD;
" Mr. Countebank," said Mr. Going to the&#xD;
withered little cashier, "I have come to in.&#xD;
troduce to you my new partner, Mr. Ernest&#xD;
Montant, who will leave his signature with&#xD;
you, and in future will attend to the finances&#xD;
of my new firm-Going, Montant &amp;amp; Con-&#xD;
pany."&#xD;
The cashier looked up a moment with&#xD;
that presumption, bordering upon impudence,&#xD;
which our bank officers (in reality our most&#xD;
dependent servants) are allowed to assume,&#xD;
and said, somewhat puzzled,-&#xD;
" You were a clerk in the house before, I&#xD;
remember you. All right. The paying-teller&#xD;
will show you where to write your sig.&#xD;
nature, and now excuse me, I have to attend&#xD;
the meeting of the directors up-stairs."&#xD;
Mr. Going had left immediately after irtro.&#xD;
during his new partner. The latter had made&#xD;
no bow, because the cashier had not vol.&#xD;
untered a like courtesy, and he now stood&#xD;
before him without removing his hat.&#xD;
"You will stay a moment, if you please,"&#xD;
he said, very quietly, but with evident deter.&#xD;
mination to be obeyed.&#xD;
Mr. Countebank had his hand on the door.&#xD;
knob; but turned around with the air of a&#xD;
millionaire accosted by a beggar.&#xD;
" My time, sir,-" he began sharply.&#xD;
"Of course I know your time is valuable,"&#xD;
interrupted our hero, "and the directors have&#xD;
already postponed the meeting twenty min.&#xD;
utes; but I request you to give rue three&#xD;
minutes more. Mr. Going's firm has deposited&#xD;
in this bank for nearly a century, and 1 insist&#xD;
upon your attention for the time I stated."&#xD;
He took out his watch, noted the time, and&#xD;
took a seat near Mr. Countebank's desk. The&#xD;
latter looked bewildered, hesitated a moment,&#xD;
and before our hero had produced some papers&#xD;
from his pocket-book, was again seated at his&#xD;
desk.&#xD;
" Three minutes," repeated the cashier,&#xD;
gruffly.&#xD;
" Mr. Countebank," said Montant, without&#xD;
heeding the affront, "our payments are heavy&#xD;
to-day. We have over fifty thousand dollars&#xD;
coming due at your bank alone, and the col.&#xD;
laterals which you hold are partly worthless.&#xD;
I refer to the notes of the Hobgoblin Com-&#xD;
pany."&#xD;
"Well, and what do you propose ?"&#xD;
"I propose," said Montant, slowly,-" to con-&#xD;
tinue to keep an account here, provided-you&#xD;
continue to treat us with the courtesy which&#xD;
our old, name deserves, and will grant us&#xD;
additional accommodations, should we need&#xD;
them."&#xD;
"But you are insolvent/1" cried the cashier,&#xD;
hardly knowing what lie said from perplexity.&#xD;
Montant colored with anger at the ugly&#xD;
wordl, but, controlling himself, answered, with&#xD;
cutting distinctness,-*-&#xD;
" These two checks, each for one hundred&#xD;
thousand dollars, will give you the lie more&#xD;
flatly than I can. You will please put theme&#xD;
to our credit, and charge what is due to-day&#xD;
to our account. You will also oblige me by&#xD;
kindly contradicting all absurd reports con.-&#xD;
&#xD;
FORTUNE.&#xD;
&#xD;
cerning our insolvency, there being no founda-&#xD;
tion for such scandal, except in the malice of&#xD;
some evil-minded enemies of Mr. Going. Good-&#xD;
morning, sir."&#xD;
The tactics pursued by Mr. Going and our&#xD;
hero were to prove most telling and success-&#xD;
ful. He had advised his new partners to keep&#xD;
the change a profound secret. His motives&#xD;
were twofold. In the first place he wanted to&#xD;
see how far the credit of the house could be&#xD;
stretched, and found, that in spite of rumor,&#xD;
and finally, a prevailing certainty of their&#xD;
failure, the personal credit of Mr. Going was&#xD;
not entirely lost. He had sent Walter to bor-&#xD;
row small amounts from the brokers, and&#xD;
other small men that were under obligations&#xD;
to the house, and they found that these small&#xD;
men responded to the call without hesitation.&#xD;
Unlike the millionaires, such as Chip, to whom&#xD;
Mr. Going had applied for aid, the poorer class&#xD;
came to the rescue, relying on his honor to re-&#xD;
pay them, even in case of a failure. He was&#xD;
not "a perfect stranger," except to the im-&#xD;
mensely wealthy.&#xD;
The other reason for deferring the vindica-&#xD;
tion of the firm was, that Montant thought as&#xD;
much eclat as possible was advisAe under the&#xD;
circumstances. A gradual improvement in the&#xD;
affairs of the house would have dispelled the&#xD;
floating rumors, and general doubt by degrees;&#xD;
but he knew that a sudden display of power&#xD;
that no one dreamed of, just on the last day,&#xD;
would be noised abroad in the most exagger-&#xD;
ated manner, and it needed a trumpet-tone to&#xD;
silence the wide-spread whisperings.&#xD;
He did not look back when lie left Mr.&#xD;
Countebank, to watch the effect lie had in-&#xD;
tended to -produce, for lie was certain what&#xD;
that effect would be. Mr. Countebank held&#xD;
the checks in his hands, and examined them a&#xD;
moment, not knowing what to think, so well&#xD;
had the busy tongue of Mr. Fatman succeeded&#xD;
in impressing the minds of all he could reach,&#xD;
with regard to the fihilure of Going &amp;amp; Son.&#xD;
One hundred and fifty thousand dollars in ex-&#xD;
cess of what they had to pay! And notwith-&#xD;
standing- a loss of nearly fifty thousand dollars&#xD;
just incurred by the notes of Hobgolblin be-&#xD;
coming worthless! But there was no mistake.&#xD;
There were the checks, signed by Mr. Chip, him-&#xD;
self, and they were certified by the Bank of Com-&#xD;
meree. The astounded cashier called a clerk.&#xD;
" Change the heading of Going &amp;amp; Son's ac-&#xD;
count, to Going, Montant &amp;amp; Company, and give&#xD;
them credit for two hundred thousand dollars,&#xD;
charging their notes in account !" lie almost&#xD;
shrieked, and then fairly flew up the stairs, two&#xD;
steps at a leap, to tell the sage directors&#xD;
the news.&#xD;
"Let me see the checks," said Mr. Chip.&#xD;
"As I supposed," he added, looking around&#xD;
wnh genuine satisfaction.  " These are my&#xD;
checks, and this is money, belonging to the&#xD;
Van Strom estate; but since Paradise and&#xD;
Montant borrowed it, as executors of the es-&#xD;
tate, upon collateral security, I am certain that&#xD;
Going did not get them out of charity. Gentle-&#xD;
men, he has had more resources than any of&#xD;
us dreamed of! I am heartily glad of it."&#xD;
" A clever old gentleman," said one director.&#xD;
" Can't put haim down," said another.&#xD;
&#xD;
139&#xD;
&#xD;
" They were always a strong house," testi-&#xD;
fled a third.&#xD;
" And will remain so; for, by Jove, any firm&#xD;
that can lose money steadily, as they have&#xD;
done, expend whole fortunes in private ex-&#xD;
travagances, get taken in by such a business as&#xD;
that Hobgoblin affair, and then come out with&#xD;
a hundred and fifty thousand balance in bank&#xD;
the very day we all expected them to fail-&#xD;
such a house, gentlemen, can be relied on."&#xD;
"I am very glad of it," repeated Mr. Chip,&#xD;
softly.&#xD;
"Going is a noble, honorable, charitable&#xD;
man," continued another speaker, in the&#xD;
general ecology, "and I mean to go and tell&#xD;
him so to-day."&#xD;
"I always thought he would come out right.&#xD;
Ile is as smart a man as we have among us."&#xD;
Oh, the change produced by those two slips&#xD;
of paper! But though the tribute paid by&#xD;
these gray-haired merchants was caused by&#xD;
mammon, and not by true friendship, yet, to&#xD;
be just to human nature, now that all was&#xD;
right again with their former friend, without&#xD;
their aid, probably there was not one in the&#xD;
assembly not honestly glad at heart for&#xD;
what had occurred.  ]iaean was not among&#xD;
them!&#xD;
Mr. Going sat in his private office that day&#xD;
a proud and happy man. Honor to the weak-&#xD;
ness that made him derive pleasure from&#xD;
vanity ! As to a soldier, so is honor dear to a&#xD;
merchant, and be it sustained as it may, it&#xD;
gladdens the heart and instills new life. And&#xD;
besides, in his happiness, Mr. Going looked&#xD;
back upon the humiliations he had suffered&#xD;
forgivingly. He knew there must be a bar-&#xD;
rier between the rich and the poor in a country&#xD;
where every man carries his fortune in his own&#xD;
head and hands. He knew that without that&#xD;
barrier, surmountable in this happy land by&#xD;
energy and perseverance, the ambition of the&#xD;
individual would slacken, and the progress of&#xD;
the nation be impeded, and lie accepted the&#xD;
good luck that had befallen him with humble&#xD;
thanks, like a Christian gentleman, forgetting&#xD;
the harshness of the world which but a few&#xD;
weeks ago had bowed his head, and almost&#xD;
broken his heart. '&#xD;
Rich men, who saw in him a friend regained,&#xD;
poor men, who saw in him their kind and mu-&#xD;
nificent protector once more, old mcn, who&#xD;
joyed at a bright spot in human destiny, young&#xD;
men, aspiring to equal such an example of&#xD;
victory in the midst of defeat-all crowded&#xD;
around him, and when Ernest Montant saw&#xD;
the heightened color in his face, and the&#xD;
brilliant light in his eye, he had the blissful&#xD;
satisfaction, so rarely accorded to mortals, of&#xD;
having been the creator of happiness-blissful&#xD;
because Deitic.&#xD;
Then, with a shudder, he thought of what&#xD;
would have occurred had ie been unable to&#xD;
help. For a moment his imagination showed&#xD;
him that old man, tottering to his grave with&#xD;
his pride broken and his heart desolate.&#xD;
Perhaps compelled to - work for his daily&#xD;
bread, mingling his bitter tears with the sweat&#xD;
of his brow.&#xD;
And there are such men in the world!I&#xD;
They are groping in the night of despair while&#xD;

GOING AND SON.&#xD;

the sun is shedding golden beams upon the&#xD;
laughing world.  And as Ernest Moritant&#xD;
finished his reverie, lie could have thrown his&#xD;
arms around that old man, who was saved now&#xD;
and called him father, defying all the smooth-&#xD;
faced tigers of the gay world in his defence.&#xD;
"Father !" he could have spoken the word&#xD;
aloud, but it died on his lips, in his heart be-&#xD;
fore it was uttered. It haunted him, it staid&#xD;
in his mind, rung in his ears all that day, and&#xD;
as he strolled up town he confessed to him-&#xD;
self,--&#xD;
"Yes: hang all doubts and fears-let me&#xD;
tell the truth to myself at least, though never&#xD;
to another. I would rather carl that old gen-&#xD;
tleman by that heavenly name, though he&#xD;
were a beggar, than to be as I am, the praised&#xD;
and honored merchant, the almost idolized&#xD;
friend of those I love, and the possessor of the&#xD;
Venus to whom I owe it all."&#xD;
He was unhappy. Mark, the man who has&#xD;
an abundance of money, and all that wealth&#xD;

CHAPTER I.&#xD;
WALTER IS REED.&#xD;
" Is this the promised end ?"&#xD;
KIse LEA.&#xD;
JOSEPHINE VAN STROM was visiting a friend&#xD;
1n New York. She that bud once been lonely&#xD;
and forsaken, now found no lack of acquaint-&#xD;
ances, charmed into sudden existence by that&#xD;
sorcerer, money. Perhaps, many a gallant, first&#xD;
attracted by the well-founded report of her&#xD;
wealth alone, found more than wealth to fasci-&#xD;
nate him in the beautiful widow. Our hero&#xD;
called upon her as often as his arduous duties&#xD;
permitted.&#xD;
"Late, again," she would say, rising with a&#xD;
joyous start to greet him. "Do you know,&#xD;
Ernest, that I can not help wishing you had&#xD;
never entered into that copartnership which&#xD;
keeps you from me so much."&#xD;
"I think a man can never remain attractive&#xD;
to a woman unless he has a regular occupation.&#xD;
He must be employed during some hours of the&#xD;
day, if it is only to keep him out of the way at&#xD;
home. If he remains with his wife all the&#xD;
time, he becomes the housekeeper's drudge."&#xD;
" But I am not a housekeeper, you know I"&#xD;
"But soon shall be," returned Montant,&#xD;
gayly.&#xD;
" How soon ?" she asked, in a whisper.&#xD;
"Whenever my darling gives the 'word.&#xD;
Shall it be a month from to-day ?"&#xD;
&#xD;
can procure, and who has used his means right.&#xD;
eously and nobly-is unhappy still.&#xD;
*      *      *      **   *&#xD;
A few days after the fame of the old house&#xD;
had taken another flight upward in the manner&#xD;
just narrated, the door of Going, Montant &amp;amp;&#xD;
Co.'s private office was opened softly.&#xD;
" Good morning, gentlemen," said Mr. Sole.&#xD;
mons all smile "I am happy to inform yen&#xD;
that I'm in the stock board again. Debtsyall&#xD;
paid-old uncle died-rich-miser, you know.&#xD;
Market steady-all stocks in for a rise--bulls&#xD;
victorious. Give me an order-Erie is low,&#xD;
have you any ? I'll sell at three a quarter re-&#xD;
gular-buy three an eighth regular, or I'll give&#xD;
three an eighth sixteenth off cash."&#xD;
"Hurrah l" cried Walter, "cash is come to&#xD;
life again, hey, Solomons."&#xD;
" Cash, sir," answered the Jew, stepping&#xD;
into the room re-adorned with his diamonds&#xD;
cash is re-born, and long life to it."&#xD;
"Amen," added Montant, laughing.&#xD;
&#xD;
"Do you think that by that time your busi-&#xD;
ness will graciously yield you up to me for a&#xD;
few weeks ?"&#xD;
" Yes. It seems ridiculous to say, one is&#xD;
too busy to get married. Yet such has been&#xD;
my case. There is an amount of enterprise&#xD;
and activity in the commerce of this city, per-&#xD;
haps unparalleled in the history of trade. A&#xD;
man must devote every moment of time and&#xD;
every faculty of his brain to his business, or&#xD;
he can not keep up with the rest."&#xD;
"But you are independent," she pleaded.&#xD;
" Not, until that two hundred thousand dol-&#xD;
lars is returned."&#xD;
" Oh, you foolish, silly fellow. Isn't it all&#xD;
yours ?"&#xD;
"I might almost call it mine, but as a part-&#xD;
ner of Going, Montant &amp;amp; Co., I feel the ne-&#xD;
cessity of paying it back to the estate of John&#xD;
Van Strom. I lent the firm that money on my&#xD;
responsibility as trustee, and I must see to&#xD;
its repayment."&#xD;
"I hate money !" she cried.&#xD;
" Do not speak so foolishly, Josephine," he&#xD;
replied, gravely. " Money has made us what&#xD;
we are to-day. Money has brought happiness&#xD;
back to Mr. Going's sad and oppressed heart.&#xD;
How can you then speak in derision of this&#xD;
great benefactor ?"&#xD;
" But I want you to leave business, and de-&#xD;
vote yourself to me."&#xD;
" There is a time of unexampled prosperity&#xD;
in store for us," continued Montant. "I can&#xD;
name the day when Mr. Going and Walter&#xD;
will be able to discharge all their debts; for the&#xD;
&#xD;
war, which is threatening the life of the coun-&#xD;
try, is rolling wealth into our coffers."&#xD;
" I thought times were dreadfully hard."&#xD;
" No; at least not to merchants removed&#xD;
from the immediate scenes of wvar."&#xD;
" And if you continue to prosper in business&#xD;
will you promise me to retire as soon as Mr.&#xD;
Going has no more need of you ?"&#xD;
" What on earth would I do all day long ?"&#xD;
" Love me I" she answered, looking up in his&#xD;
face with the old Madonna expression. He did&#xD;
not answer. After a pause--&#xD;
"I have a piece of news to tell you, Joseph-&#xD;
ine," he said. " Mr. Going has bought the&#xD;
Priory again."&#xD;
" How could they-"&#xD;
".Commit such an extravagance ? I myself&#xD;
advised the old gentleman to do it.  The&#xD;
house in Fifth Avenue will be sold, and their&#xD;
expenses will be comparatively small in the&#xD;
country."&#xD;
" It seems very strange to me," said Joseph-&#xD;
ine.&#xD;
" There was a time when we all thought a&#xD;
reconciliation with Mr. Fatman was out of the&#xD;
question, and yet he and Mr. Going have made&#xD;
it all up, and now that we have gained the&#xD;
day, he seems sorry that he ever opposed us.&#xD;
More than that, our old enemy is a guest at&#xD;
the Priory. Mr. Going requested immediate&#xD;
possession of the house, and Mr. Fatman con-&#xD;
sented to the request, on condition that he&#xD;
should be permitted to remain a few weeks&#xD;
as a guest."&#xD;
"I don't understand it," said Josephine.&#xD;
" Nor do I ; so let us place it among those&#xD;
queer freaks of fortune which we will not&#xD;
attempt to fathom. But there is something&#xD;
more I have to tell you."              ,&#xD;
" What a day of wonders. Well what is,&#xD;
it ?"&#xD;
" It is a case for you to decide alone. - I&#xD;
merely -want to know whether you do not&#xD;
think, that, since the Goings owe so much to&#xD;
you, it would be but ordinary delicacy to ac-&#xD;
cept the invitation Miss Jessie extends to&#xD;
you, to spend a few days at the Priory ?"&#xD;
Josephine started with dismay; but in his&#xD;
calm, serene, face, she read no justification for&#xD;
the strange doubts and jealous fears that pos-&#xD;
sessed her at his words, and, having reflected,&#xD;
she said, honestly:-&#xD;
' I do not like to go; but if you think a re-&#xD;
fusal would look haughty, or, in any way&#xD;
overbearing, I quite agree with you that good&#xD;
taste bids us become their guests if they ex-&#xD;
pect us to come."&#xD;
" Here is a letter from Miss Going. Walter&#xD;
informed me of its import when he gave it to&#xD;
me."-&#xD;
"So, after some further conversation, the&#xD;
visit was decided on, and the next fine day&#xD;
they rode to Harlem, where Walter, by ap-&#xD;
pointment, awaited them with his little yacht&#xD;
to take advantage of the fine breeze and sail&#xD;
up.&#xD;
" I think few ladies would venture upon&#xD;
such a trip. Miss Jessie certainly showed&#xD;
that she was cautious," said the hand-&#xD;
some widow, who was watching with some&#xD;
anxiety the stiffening breeze, swelling the can-&#xD;
&#xD;
vas and forcing the little vessel pretty well&#xD;
over on its side.&#xD;
" No danger," cried Walter, at the helm. "I&#xD;
have been at this business all my life. Jessie&#xD;
is unwell, or she would have come with me as&#xD;
I told you."&#xD;
Now, no matter how true this boast might&#xD;
have been, the wind, coming down in puffs&#xD;
and squalls, seemed determined to test his&#xD;
seamanship, and one particular gust (probably&#xD;
made up on purpose in the clouds), struck&#xD;
them very suddenly. The boat careened over,&#xD;
hesitated a moment while the water gushed&#xD;
over the rail, and then capsized in the most&#xD;
deliberate manner. A loud shriek, an oath&#xD;
from Walter. and Mrs. Van Strom, the gentle-&#xD;
men, and the two sailors, found themselves&#xD;
sprawling in the Sound.&#xD;
Fortunately, none of them became entang-&#xD;
led in the rigging, and since there was but one&#xD;
woman in the party they could all combine in&#xD;
their efforts to save her. Clinging to the keel&#xD;
of the vessel, Walter and Ernest held Joseph-&#xD;
ine up between them, but the shock addegl to&#xD;
the precarious position in which they were&#xD;
placed. The widow was nearly senseless, and&#xD;
Walter and Ernest had a hard struggle until,&#xD;
to their unspeakable joy, a fishing-smack bore&#xD;
down to their relief. With the help of the&#xD;
sturdy fishermen, they were pulled on board&#xD;
in safety, amid odd queries of " Was your&#xD;
sheet jammed ?" &amp;amp;c. Though neither the&#xD;
appearance, nor the odor of the boat and its&#xD;
finny freight were enticing it may be question-&#xD;
ed if that great sailor Walter was ever so lit-&#xD;
tle curious as to what sort of a keel was un-&#xD;
der him, as he felt that a great responsibility&#xD;
rested on him for the mishap, and, indeed,&#xD;
they were all thoroughly grateful for their de-&#xD;
liverance. Finally, a friendly yacht came with-&#xD;
in speaking-distance, and, by dint of some&#xD;
exertion, they were all transhipped to that&#xD;
more comfortable craft.&#xD;
" What a superb figure she has," whisper-&#xD;
ed Walter to our hero, when the widow was&#xD;
being wrapped up in an infinity of blankets in&#xD;
the cabin of their friend's yacht.&#xD;
Little did they dream of the consequences&#xD;
of this accident. Josephine had caught a&#xD;
cold that was to prolong her few days' stay at&#xD;
the Priory, to weeks, and perhaps months.&#xD;
Men's lives have turned on a smaller pivot&#xD;
than this. Who can tell what will be the con-&#xD;
squences ?&#xD;
And now we must turn our attention to an-&#xD;
other scene for a moment, while it is being&#xD;
enacted, and then let it pass away from mem-&#xD;
ory with all its sickening horrors.&#xD;
A mad-house in New England; a gloomy&#xD;
company of men and women about the grounds,&#xD;
a blank look in every eye, in every face.&#xD;
As you enter, the air seems uncomfortably&#xD;
still, as if some dread spell was in it. The&#xD;
forms that flit by are like so many pale and&#xD;
restless ghosts - but, instead of the spirit&#xD;
without the body, we have here the body de-&#xD;
void of the mind.&#xD;
What wonder the young and timid girl,&#xD;
dressed in black and deeply veiled, trembles&#xD;
and shudders at the threshold of this dread&#xD;
abode !&#xD;

142                   GOING AND SON.&#xD;
&#xD;
The kind manner of the doctor reassured&#xD;
her ; butas he led her along the lane of blub-&#xD;
bering, senseless creatures that crowded up to&#xD;
see the new arrival, she realized, with a sick-&#xD;
ening terror, that these were the best of those&#xD;
confined in the asylum, and her way led to&#xD;
the place where the worst cases were imprison-&#xD;
ed, and it was there she expected to see her&#xD;
father.&#xD;
Let us not describe the man with the shat-&#xD;
tered, tottering frame, the wild, blood-shot&#xD;
eye, hands bleeding with the marks of vio-&#xD;
lence, and the teeth set upon the lacerated&#xD;
lips ; and this was once Eben Bates.&#xD;
He had just recovered from an attack of&#xD;
frenzy. His daughter had visited him before&#xD;
his removal to the State Asylum, and the&#xD;
effects had been soothing, even productive of&#xD;
a glimpse of reason. So the doctor caused his&#xD;
fetters to be removed while he led her near&#xD;
him.&#xD;
The doctor made a mistake.&#xD;
"Father, do you know me ?' Oh, if all was&#xD;
not darkness in that soul, those heart-rending,&#xD;
broken accents would have reawakened him&#xD;
to light.&#xD;
"Are you the daughter of Judge Bates?"&#xD;
asked a voice unnatural to her ears, and yet it&#xD;
came from her father !&#xD;
"Father I" she cried aloud, advancing to-&#xD;
ward him. " Father look at me-oh, it can&#xD;
not, can not be that you don't know me."&#xD;
"What are you to me ?" asked the maniac,&#xD;
with mock grandeur, drawing himself up into&#xD;
a shocking caricature of his former dignity.&#xD;
" Go away ! You are the daughter of a crimi-&#xD;
nall  You are dishonored, an outcast, I 'll&#xD;
none of you I"&#xD;
" Oh, why have I lived to see this," mur-&#xD;
mured the poor girl, scarcely able to bear&#xD;
up.&#xD;
" That is the question," he cried, fiercely,&#xD;
having caught her words.&#xD;
The doctor's practiced ear caught the change&#xD;
in the maniacs voice, and he stepped in sight&#xD;
of the cell. Immediately her father's manner&#xD;
became quiet, and in low, measured tones he&#xD;
said:-&#xD;
" Why should you live? If you were to die,&#xD;
Eben Bates would have a free conscience and&#xD;
you would be saved from disgrace. I know&#xD;
Eben Bates well-"&#xD;
Reassured by the change in the patient's&#xD;
demeanor the doctor stepped aside to attend a&#xD;
raving maniac, who seemed determined to win&#xD;
his freedom by battering down his cell door&#xD;
with his thick skull.&#xD;
"I'll kill you," shouted Bates. A spring,&#xD;
a moan of terror and agony, and the daughter&#xD;
lay on the ground writhing in the iron clutch&#xD;
of her father. He had seized her by the&#xD;
throat and dashed her once-cherished head&#xD;
against the iron-bound walls and flagged pave-&#xD;
ment, again and again. Before the terrified&#xD;
attendants could interfere, the last prayer of&#xD;
pretty, gentle, loving Bessie Bates had been&#xD;
breathed, and her soul had followed it on to&#xD;
heaven.&#xD;
They removed the body, a piteous sight,&#xD;
and from the surrounding cells went up such&#xD;
howling, shrieking, curses, and yells as if the&#xD;
&#xD;
demons of hell, rejoicing at the awful tragedy,&#xD;
were incarcerated there instead of human&#xD;
effigies, and the thunder tones of Eben Bates&#xD;
were heard over all as he struggled with the&#xD;
keepers. It seemed impossible to master him.&#xD;
With the strength of a dozen giants, he at-&#xD;
tempted to free himself, and, whenever lie&#xD;
could, he struck his head with unmerciful&#xD;
violence against the bars of his cell.&#xD;
At last, when exhaustion overpowered him&#xD;
the reaction came. Unable to stand now, his&#xD;
face became deathly pale, except where the&#xD;
blood flowed freely from the self-inflicted&#xD;
wounds on his forehead. He looked about&#xD;
with strange, wild eyes. His chest heaved un-&#xD;
steadily. Suddenly the life-current gushed&#xD;
from his lips, and he sank to the ground by&#xD;
the side of his daughter, with the light of&#xD;
his immortal soul restored to him, if it so&#xD;
pleased the infinite mercy of God.&#xD;
CHAPTER II.&#xD;
ONCE MORE AT THE PRIORY.&#xD;
"How brooks your grace the air,&#xD;
After tossing on the breaking seas?"&#xD;
" Needs must I like it well."&#xD;
KING RICHARD II.&#xD;
THE morning after the funeral of Bessie Bates,&#xD;
Montant was sitting by the window of his&#xD;
room watching the white clouds that chased&#xD;
each other in the distance. Apollo was hat-&#xD;
tling for the mastery of the sky against the&#xD;
hosts of Jupiter Pluvius, and the result seemed&#xD;
doubtful. The broad expanse of the Sound&#xD;
upon which the shadows sailed in ghostly&#xD;
etigies of the clouds above, was hardly dis.&#xD;
turbed by a ripple. He was contemplating the&#xD;
late events, as detailed in the last chapter,&#xD;
and blessing the kindness of Providence in&#xD;
sparing Josephine.- while she who had been&#xD;
laid in the grave but the day before had no&#xD;
happiness in store for her, and could part with&#xD;
life as a loathsome burden.&#xD;
Bessie's funeral was unostentatious, and no&#xD;
relative of the poor girl appeared to act as&#xD;
chief mourner. Thus alone, though not un-&#xD;
pitied, nor friendless, she was carried to a&#xD;
hallowed resting-place, and no remembrance of&#xD;
her father's crimes or uncle's iniquities marked&#xD;
the mound that covered her remains, or em-&#xD;
bittered her memory, among those who had&#xD;
known and loved her.&#xD;
It was Sunday morning, and Ernest had&#xD;
before him a day free of business cares,&#xD;
though his mind was full of anxiety. Joseph-&#xD;
ine was sick, very sick, indeed. The shock&#xD;
of Bessie's horrible death, following close upon&#xD;
her own narrow escape, produced a fever so&#xD;
alarming that physicians of the greatest repute&#xD;
were summoned from the city to rub their&#xD;
golden spectacles, and decide that it was best&#xD;
to leave nature to work the cure alone, with-&#xD;
out being weakened by drugging, and further&#xD;
that they all and severally agreed that the&#xD;
attendant physician was perfectly correct in&#xD;
his mode of treatment.&#xD;
As our hero arose with   sigh, to join the&#xD;
&#xD;
family below, Walter stepped in, silent and&#xD;
downcast. He had seen very little of Bessie&#xD;
of late, and though they were engaged, as we&#xD;
knew, their affection had never grown into&#xD;
that closer and ide4tifyiig union of heart&#xD;
and soul which is the result of long intimacy&#xD;
between lovers. Perhaps his late trials had&#xD;
somewhat hardened him against immoderate&#xD;
grief, for we find him 'mourning his loss with&#xD;
quiet resignation, and looking upon it more as&#xD;
the merciful ending of a terrible existence, than&#xD;
as a cruel bereavement.&#xD;
After discussing the sad subject, the friends&#xD;
descended to find Mr. Going at the breakfast&#xD;
table, and Miss Jessie presiding over the tea&#xD;
and coffee.&#xD;
"I have been to Josephine's room," said&#xD;
she, "and am happy to announce that she&#xD;
finds herself much better. Have you seen her,&#xD;
Mr. Montant ?"&#xD;
"Yes," answered ,our hero, " I think we&#xD;
may consider the danger has passed."&#xD;
" Do you visit ladies in bed ?" asked Walter,&#xD;
with a smile.&#xD;
"She was up," answered the other, "and&#xD;
lying on a sofa, and she had done this only&#xD;
to enable her to receive my visit. Not alto-&#xD;
gether according to the directions of the doc-&#xD;
tor, I am afraid, but I am proud of this mark&#xD;
of her affection, and I am sure it seems to me&#xD;
that sha never looked handsomer."&#xD;
"'Will you have tea or coffee this morning,&#xD;
Walter ?" asked his sister.&#xD;
" I think," said Mr. Going, " that the habits&#xD;
of our other guests are intolerable. It is not&#xD;
often that I speak harshly of any one, but this&#xD;
vice of lying in bed till late in the morning&#xD;
is, in my mind, an offense against decency and&#xD;
respectability."&#xD;
"I do not think that I should submit to it&#xD;
for more than the few days we are compelled to&#xD;
grant thpm," said the young housekeeper. " I&#xD;
can understand that Mr. Fatman should be&#xD;
fond of sleeping late, and take plenty of time&#xD;
for his toilet, but I am certain his wife only&#xD;
affects the weakness from a desire to ape&#xD;
French manners."&#xD;
" As for me," rejoined her father, "I can for-&#xD;
give a woman sooner than a business man and&#xD;
head of a family, for if the master of the house&#xD;
does not sit at the head of the breakfast-table,&#xD;
family and house become demoralized."&#xD;
"Mr. Going." asked Montant, "does it not&#xD;
seem certain that Fatman has lost heavily in&#xD;
his late business transactions ?"&#xD;
"Yes," answered the old gentleman, "and&#xD;
this, added to his much criticised connection&#xD;
with Hobgoblin, seems to be weakening his&#xD;
credit considerably. At least, so I am told in&#xD;
the city."&#xD;
"1How strange that you made friends with&#xD;
him again!1" cried Miss Jessie.&#xD;
Her father shrugged his shoulders.&#xD;
"This reconciliation," he answered, "brought&#xD;
about, as you all know, by Mr. Paradise, has&#xD;
not been without benefit to us. The suit of my&#xD;
old firm against the trustees has been far more&#xD;
satisfactorily arranged since Mr. Fatman goes&#xD;
"hand-in-hand" with me now, ia good ear-&#xD;
.nest."&#xD;
"And mall your old friends have returned to&#xD;
&#xD;
you," cried the young lady.  "I understand&#xD;
that Mr. Paradise has promised to spend next&#xD;
Sunday with us."&#xD;
" Yes, my child. He has never given me&#xD;
cause for complaint, and 'the services he ren-&#xD;
dered to Ernest should alone entitle him to a&#xD;
place in our hearts."&#xD;
" Do these old friends esteem you or your&#xD;
money?" persisted Miss Jessie. "While ruin-&#xD;
ation threatened you, they treated you like a&#xD;
stranger, as you told me yourself."&#xD;
"There are always two phases of a ques-&#xD;
tion," answered the old gentleman, with a smile,&#xD;
" and it is wiser to choose the pleasanter one.&#xD;
I might give it as my opinion that these friends&#xD;
returned to m, not only on account of my&#xD;
regained position, but, also, as a tribute to my&#xD;
supposed sagacity displayed in preserving that&#xD;
position triumphantly in spite of the danger.&#xD;
if they knew how much is due to our good&#xD;
friend here, they might think differeutly."&#xD;
The young housekeeper pouted slightly at&#xD;
the mention of Montant's services to the firm,&#xD;
and, rising from the table, busied herself about&#xD;
the room, apparently unconscious of his pres-&#xD;
enee.&#xD;
Our hero arose from the table and went up-&#xD;
stairs to pay another visit to Josephine.  As&#xD;
he entered the room, she was seated on her&#xD;
sofa, a little breakfast-table before heer, and&#xD;
the words, " Come in," in answer to his knock,&#xD;
were somewhat interfered with by a piece of the&#xD;
cutlet to which she was doing justice. As he&#xD;
approached her, she had justsucceeded in swal-&#xD;
lowing her mouthful, and looked up to him,&#xD;
laughing, and showing an array of beautiful&#xD;
teeth, half-concealed, half-disclosed by her full,&#xD;
rosy lips.  11er mouth belonged rather to the&#xD;
ample and luxurious, than to the delicate order,&#xD;
and when a laugh extended over her fair fea-&#xD;
tures, she presented such a picture as the god&#xD;
of pleasure would have painted to beguile weary&#xD;
man into forgetfulness of the harsh world.&#xD;
Montant imifrinted a warm kiss upon that&#xD;
upturned laughing mouth, and felt more satis-&#xD;
lied than ever with his choice.&#xD;
" How long do you intend to remain at the&#xD;
Priory ?"&#xD;
"Until my lord and master that is to be bids&#xD;
me leave," she answered, mischievously.&#xD;
"And how much longer ?" he asked, laugh-&#xD;
ing.&#xD;
" As long as I please "&#xD;
"' But seriously, do you not think we had bet-&#xD;
ter leave here as soon you are able to travel ?"&#xD;
" Are you afraid of falling in love with Jes-&#xD;
sie ? Does your prudence dictate this precau-&#xD;
tion ?"&#xD;
He drew her toward him, and kissing her&#xD;
again, replied, with singular emphasis, "No."&#xD;
"Then, why are you so anxious to leave ?"&#xD;
she asked.  "I like this place. I am very&#xD;
happy with the associations of this dear old&#xD;
Priory."&#xD;
" Do you remember the masquerade ?" he&#xD;
asked, maliciously, "and our walk in the gar-&#xD;
den, when you proposed to me?"&#xD;
"I remember that a saucy boy enticed me&#xD;
away from the house, and acted very foolishmly,&#xD;
persisting in his nonsense until I engaged&#xD;
myself to him to get rid of him."&#xD;
&#xD;

GOING AND SON.&#xD;
&#xD;
" You have not got rid of me yet," he cried.&#xD;
"No, and I don't wish to 1" she answered,&#xD;
with a look that caused him to repeat a certain&#xD;
ceremony previously described. There is no&#xD;
known method of ascertaining the exact num-&#xD;
ber to which these repetitions might have&#xD;
increased, had not the door opened, and a lady&#xD;
stepped in hastily.&#xD;
.I want to bid you good-bye, Mrs. Van&#xD;
Strom," she said, hurriedly. "I am going to&#xD;
church in the -illage."&#xD;
Mrs. Fatman was muffled up in spite of the&#xD;
warm spring weather, and though a veil cov-&#xD;
ered her face, it did not escape Josephine that&#xD;
she was excited.&#xD;
"Why, what is the matter with you, Mrs.&#xD;
Fatman ?" she asked, somewhat perplexed.&#xD;
"Has any thimghappened?"&#xD;
"Oh, no! only I am in a hurry, for it is get-&#xD;
ting late!1"&#xD;
"Are you going alone ?" asked the widow,&#xD;
after the lady had kissed her with a warmth&#xD;
too unlike her usual nonchalance not to startle&#xD;
the recipient a little.&#xD;
"Yes, my husband is just completing his&#xD;
toilet, Jessie pleads a headache, Mr. Going&#xD;
seems fatigued, Walter is still too melancholy&#xD;
to show himself among people, and unless Mr.&#xD;
Montant displays ordinary politeness and offers&#xD;
to escort me, I must go alone."&#xD;
"With your kind permission, Mr. Montant&#xD;
will stay where he is," said Josephine.&#xD;
"I must confess, I think this lady more in&#xD;
need of company than you, Mrs. Fatman," said&#xD;
our hero, smiling. "So, since I must choose&#xD;
where my knightly services are most needed,&#xD;
I am compelled to say that my duty keeps me&#xD;
here."&#xD;
"Oh, irksome duty! How you must suffer&#xD;
under your cruel fetters!" cried Mrs. Fatman,&#xD;
turning to leave the room. Montant assisted&#xD;
her to the carriage, which was waiting at the&#xD;
door, and returned to his lady-love.  They&#xD;
were having a glorious good time, when Walter&#xD;
sauntered in.&#xD;
"iDo you know where Jessie is ?"&#xD;
"I have not seen her since breakfast,"&#xD;
replied our hero, "nor has Josephine, for I&#xD;
have been bothering her with my company&#xD;
ever since."&#xD;
"Your calling Mrs. Van Strom by her Chris-&#xD;
tian narve reminds me tlfat I have never con-&#xD;
gratulated you, you vagabond I Here is my&#xD;
hand, old fellow, and allow me to say I con-&#xD;
sider you about as lucky a dog as I ever knew&#xD;
in my life."&#xD;
"If you want to tell me sweet things, it is&#xD;
not necessary that you should speak through&#xD;
him," said Josephine, blushing a little, but&#xD;
very happy.&#xD;
"I have only to say to you," he replied,&#xD;
"that, although he hardly deserves his good&#xD;
luck, you have no reason to complain, and I&#xD;
wish you all happiness-more happiness than&#xD;
is in store for me."&#xD;
After a few minutes of desultory conversa-&#xD;
tion, Walter cried, suddenly:&#xD;
I have something to tell you, Ernest, that&#xD;
I could not recall unti, just now."&#xD;
"Well, what is it ?"&#xD;
.I saw a friend of yours at the village yes-&#xD;
&#xD;
terday, unless my eyes deceived me most won-&#xD;
derfully."&#xD;
" And who may that be ?"&#xD;
" Stilletto."&#xD;
Montant looked at him in amazement. The&#xD;
widow was frightened.&#xD;
"He was dressed like a farmer," continued&#xD;
Walter,. " but his is one of those marked coun-&#xD;
tenances difficult to forget."&#xD;
" Did you speak to him?  If you were cer-&#xD;
tain of the man, why did you allow him to es-&#xD;
cape ?"&#xD;
"A man in my present state of mind may be&#xD;
excused for slowness of action," replied Walter,&#xD;
gloomily. "He must have recognized me long&#xD;
before I saw through his disguise, for hardly&#xD;
had I noticed his peculiar face, than he quickly&#xD;
turned a corner ; and, though I pursued him,&#xD;
seemed to have stink into the ground, for he&#xD;
was nowhere to be seen."&#xD;
"You don't know how it frightens me to&#xD;
hear that dreadful man is in the neighborhood,"&#xD;
said Josephine, with a dismal face.&#xD;
"I do not think he will dare do more than&#xD;
sneak around for some object he has in view,&#xD;
and that object, I can't imagine to concern our-&#xD;
selves or this house," said her lover.&#xD;
" Iow do you suppose he got away from the&#xD;
court-room in time to avoid a re-arrest after the&#xD;
trial ?" asked Walter.&#xD;
"I think Stump gave him warning that Mar-&#xD;
tin Bates and the Italian girl were-coming,"&#xD;
answered our hero.&#xD;
"But Paradise had given this very man,&#xD;
Stump, secret instructions not to lose sight of&#xD;
him, and to prevent his escape at all hazards."&#xD;
" True. But, for once, Paradise mistook his&#xD;
man," said Montant. " At all events, a mystery&#xD;
still envelops the whole proceeding."&#xD;
"I hope he will leave us alone for the fu-&#xD;
ture," whispered Josephine.&#xD;
" If he molests us again, I hope I may be&#xD;
awake and present when he appears," cried&#xD;
Walter. "We have all been too good-hearted&#xD;
and too easy of approach by ill-meaning ras-&#xD;
cals. But, Mrs. Van Strom, let me assure you,&#xD;
that as long as my dogs, my pistols, and myself&#xD;
remain in good condition, Stilletto shall not en-&#xD;
ter this house without paying for it. Now,&#xD;
don't you think I deserve a kiss for this gallant&#xD;
speech ?"&#xD;
" You do," answered Josephine, laughing,&#xD;
but as we must all wait for our rewards, I&#xD;
shall postpone yours till my wedding-day."&#xD;
" When will that be?" asked Walter.&#xD;
"In a month from now, I hope," answered&#xD;
Montant. "We have postponed it, I might al-&#xD;
most say, from week to week ; but I do not be-&#xD;
lieve in abusing good fortune, or in trusting too&#xD;
long to the jealous gods."&#xD;
"Superstitious people say, that a wedding&#xD;
several times postponed is postponed forever,"&#xD;
said Walter; ard, as his remark was not re-&#xD;
ceived with enthusiasm, he chirruped to a dog&#xD;
that had accompanied him on his visit, and left&#xD;
the room.&#xD;
"Ours won't be postponed forever, will it,&#xD;
darling ?" cried Josephine, the tears starting to&#xD;
her eyes-.&#xD;
" No," he answered, firmly. "Not unless&#xD;
Heaven puts in a veto."&#xD;

GOING AND SON.&#xD;
&#xD;
In an excited-almost angry manner, she&#xD;
handed him the note, and he read the follow-&#xD;
ing:-&#xD;
" DEAR JoSEPHINE'-&#xD;
" It seems that the hand of fate has decided&#xD;
to throw you into the bosom of your present&#xD;
hosts. If you find them desirous of a pro-&#xD;
tracted stay, I would suggest that you had&#xD;
better enjoy yourself at the Priory a little&#xD;
while longer, as I am house-cleaning, and can not&#xD;
offer you the comforts or the pleasures you are&#xD;
now enjoying. Perhaps Mr. Montant will&#xD;
agree with me that it is better to defer your&#xD;
return until after the wedding, whenever that&#xD;
may be."-&#xD;
" Your faithful sister,&#xD;
"BELLA."&#xD;
Josephine, in turn, observed him closely&#xD;
until he finished the note, and he did not&#xD;
attempt to disguise his disapproval and vexa-&#xD;
tion.&#xD;
"I declare," said Josephine, "if this was&#xD;
not written in Bella's round handwriting, I&#xD;
would never believe she could have written to&#xD;
me so cold and disagreeable a letter."&#xD;
" Well, we can't help it now," he replied, in&#xD;
a peculiar tone.&#xD;
"; Can it be that you prefer to remain here ?&#xD;
That in spite of all our vows and our ap-&#xD;
proaching marriage, there is something in your&#xD;
heart which ties you to this spot, to this&#xD;
family-to some one besides myself2"&#xD;
She had clasped her hands, and looked up to&#xD;
him imploringly. He replied, almost sternly:-&#xD;
"There is one duty you seem to have for-&#xD;
gotten, and upon it all other duties are based.&#xD;
It is confidence. If you wish to preserve my&#xD;
affection and loyalty to you, let me never&#xD;
again hear a question like this, or discover in&#xD;
you a shadow of such feelings as prompted it.&#xD;
I believe that she who doubts loves perfectly&#xD;
no longer."&#xD;
le arose, angry and perturbed. Miserably&#xD;
frightened, she threw her arms around him,&#xD;
and implored his forgiveness.&#xD;
"Bella is the cause of it all," he said, not at&#xD;
all modified. "I expected that the simplicity&#xD;
of her mind would keep her from such suspi-&#xD;
cions and hints as are contained in that letter.&#xD;
As it is, I can not help seeing that she has&#xD;
estranged herself from us in a manner that&#xD;
hardly admits of an effectual reconciliation."&#xD;
Josephine was unhappy for the rest of the&#xD;
day, and though she did her best to make him&#xD;
forget her ill-timed speech of the morning,&#xD;
while he endeavored to be as affectionate-as&#xD;
of old, there was a something between them&#xD;
which was not there before, and they both&#xD;
knew it.&#xD;
In this unpleasant frame of mind we find&#xD;
him sauntering alone through the park.&#xD;
Though night was fast approaching, he walked&#xD;
to the extreme point of the island; though the&#xD;
dark clouds were hanging low over the black-&#xD;
ening waters, he walked along the beach,&#xD;
where jagged rocks were strewn like old weird&#xD;
tombstones.&#xD;
His soul, agitated with conflicting emotions,&#xD;
took refuge in memory. Looking out over the&#xD;
waves which broke at his feet, the song of&#xD;
&#xD;
the great German poet, Heine, came to his&#xD;
mind, and ie quoted to himself:--&#xD;
"Oh, solve me the riddle of life I&#xD;
That tortimrin riddle of oldI&#xD;
Ohint temi me what sigaifies man ?"&#xD;

"The billows are breaking high up on the beach&#xD;
The inds bow freshla nditie waves flow fast&#xD;
The stars are shining, unfeeline and coli, '&#xD;
And a fool may await the answer!"&#xD;
But the powers of the night answered him-&#xD;
in his solitude, the voices of the dark waves&#xD;
spoke to him.   le listened, and  was an-&#xD;
swered:-&#xD;
" Man is the crowning work of the Almighty,&#xD;
and we are created to struggle through life,&#xD;
and conquer the storms and dangers of our&#xD;
existence, just as the tree vegetates into its&#xD;
prime, healing the wound where a lib has&#xD;
been - lopped, and resisting the destructive&#xD;
storm. When a tree stands with its leafy&#xD;
head proudly erect, it has fulfilled its mission,&#xD;
and when a human soul conquers the trials of&#xD;
life's rough changes, that soul has done its&#xD;
duty and the Creator is proud of his work.&#xD;
This is the teaching of nature."&#xD;
"But what sphere is assigned to me? Shall&#xD;
I follow the dictates of my heart, or the cold&#xD;
conchusions of reason. Which points out the'&#xD;
path of duty ? May not human reason be mis-&#xD;
taken, and through a mistaken view of duty&#xD;
lead to ultimate mischief?   May it not be&#xD;
safer to trust to the heart alone ?"&#xD;
le retraced his steps toward the house, and&#xD;
from afar, the lighted windows guided him&#xD;
through the quickly increasing darkness.&#xD;
Sounds of music greeted him, and as he ap-&#xD;
proached, the front of the grand old mansion,&#xD;
with its columns, broad steps, and substantial&#xD;
balustrades, impressed him with the stateliness&#xD;
of an old chateau.&#xD;
lie entered. Through the thick walls and&#xD;
closed doors the sounds of music had reached&#xD;
him but indistinctly. le now heard Jessie's&#xD;
sweet, sympathetic voice singing an old ballad&#xD;
-a German ballad. le listened a moment,&#xD;
and then stepped softly into the drawing-room.&#xD;
The young lady, though not alone, seemed to&#xD;
be singing for her own amusement, for her&#xD;
father, interested in his newspaper, at the&#xD;
other end of the room, as well as Josephine,&#xD;
reclining on a sofa, seemed unconscious of the&#xD;
fair performance of the fairer performer.&#xD;
" If I were a sensual man, when it comes to&#xD;
the question  of a love which    is to last&#xD;
through life, and as long after life as Heaven&#xD;
permits, I would choose that Venus on the sofa,&#xD;
did the choice lay between these two. But in-&#xD;
nocence and purity alone can kindle true ethe-&#xD;
real love in a man's breast, and though, per-&#xD;
haps, the woman is not born who holds a&#xD;
fairer virtue than Josephine-"&#xD;
At this moment the widow changed her&#xD;
position, and noticing him, arose with a flushed&#xD;
face and an anxious, tenderly   reproachful&#xD;
look in her eye.&#xD;
"Where have you been, Ernest?" she whis-&#xD;
pered. "Oh, if you knew what a miserable&#xD;
day I have spent!"&#xD;
Jessie had finished her song, and when she&#xD;
&#xD;
left the piano, she cast a casual, indifferent&#xD;
look on the lovers,-then joined her father,&#xD;
and drawing a chair to sit near him, said:-&#xD;
" I wish Walter would return. I am nerv-&#xD;
ons about him, for who knows what bad men&#xD;
he may meet. Besides, I do not feel safe here&#xD;
without him." -&#xD;
Montant followed her with his eyes, and&#xD;
felt mortified at her last speech.. Josephine&#xD;
clung to him, awaiting his answer, and with&#xD;
a great effort .to speak kindly, he answer-&#xD;
ed:-&#xD;
"You must not be too exacting, Josephine!&#xD;
I have been out of sorts to-day, so give inc&#xD;
until to-morrow to become myself again. I&#xD;
will be all right to-morrow. And now let&#xD;
me go.   I must talk business with Mr.&#xD;
Going."&#xD;
She looked at him in astonishment; but he&#xD;
had already left her side. le read in her face&#xD;
how deeply his slight and unintentional rebuff&#xD;
had wounded her, so he led her into the hall,&#xD;
and as she passively allowed him. to kiss her&#xD;
(she did not seek or return it as usual), he&#xD;
whispered:-&#xD;
" You are a child. You must not be so sen-&#xD;
sitive, or how shall we ever get through life,&#xD;
which does not always keep a man loviiig and&#xD;
smooth-tempered. Excuse me to-day, and to-&#xD;
morrow I will make up for my ill-humor."&#xD;
" Good-night, then.  I am going to my&#xD;
room. I don't feel strong."&#xD;
He bent over to kiss her "good-night,"&#xD;
when her dejected, apathetic iannirer suddenly&#xD;
changed, and throwing her arms around him,&#xD;
she burst into tears.&#xD;
"Josephine," he murmured, with surprise&#xD;
and annoyance, " Josephine, do not take my&#xD;
whims to heart.  Surely, I have not been&#xD;
guilty of unkindness to you. Not one woman&#xD;
in a tiousanl would have found cause for sor-&#xD;
row in any thing that I have said to you."&#xD;
He led her gently up-stairs to the door of her&#xD;
room, and they parted with mutual assurances&#xD;
of love; she to remain sleepless with an ach-&#xD;
ing head and heart for many hours,-he to&#xD;
commune angrily with himself, pacing the hall,&#xD;
while Jessie was talking to her father in the&#xD;
drawing-room.&#xD;
" 'Ntlerose sans spines,'" he quoted. " If a&#xD;
man finds a wife who loves him passionately&#xD;
with all her warm and sensitive heart, he must&#xD;
expect to be scolded and accused of heaven&#xD;
knows what nonsense whenever he frowns or&#xD;
speaks an impatient word. 'No rose without&#xD;
a thorn.'"&#xD;
Then he stepped into the drawing-room to&#xD;
talk about business with Mr. Going.&#xD;
- No sooner had he taken a seat near them,&#xD;
than Miss Jessie arose to leave the room.&#xD;
" You had better remain, mademoiselle," he&#xD;
said, without looking up from some papers he&#xD;
was examining.   " Your father has always&#xD;
confided in you, and I believe has consulted&#xD;
you on some occasions. What we mean to&#xD;
discuss to-night regards some property which&#xD;
your father desires to transfer to your name:&#xD;
so, you see,-you are interested."&#xD;
"My advice, when given, has never beenr&#xD;
followed," she replied, arresting her -stepm&#xD;
without condescending to turn back, " and&#xD;
&#xD;
am tired of exerting my wisdom to no purpose ;&#xD;
so, good-night I"&#xD;
"As you wish, of course" said Montant.&#xD;
" The only desire I would express before&#xD;
resigning my position of confidential adviser&#xD;
to the house of Going," she said, languidly,&#xD;
"is that all debts and burdensome obligations&#xD;
be discharged as soon as possible. 1 think&#xD;
nothing should be given to me until we are mre-&#xD;
lieved from the humiliating debt of gratitude&#xD;
which we now owe to an outside party."&#xD;
"You owe it to me alone," said Montant,&#xD;
quickly, but repented the words when she&#xD;
replied, quietly,-&#xD;
"No matter to whom we owe it. I told&#xD;
-papa, long ago, that I can't bear to be under&#xD;
obligations to any one, and instead of consent-&#xD;
ing to have property transferred to me at pres-&#xD;
ent, I would far rather be permitted to work&#xD;
with  my hands    until that disagreeable,&#xD;
odious debt be discharged." With these&#xD;
words, she left the room.&#xD;
Unobserved by the old gentleman, who&#xD;
seemed vexed and nervous at his daughter's&#xD;
speech, Montant changed color and thought,&#xD;
bitterly,-&#xD;
"She actually hates me. Calls me an out-&#xD;
side party, and my loan-odious!  Ier pride&#xD;
inspires her with dislike toward those to&#xD;
whom she owes gratitude. H1er injustice is a&#xD;
strange reward for my friendship."&#xD;
CHAPTER IV.&#xD;
A VISIT TO THE GREAT PHILOSOPHER.&#xD;
" Oh, how comes it that thou art those stranded from&#xD;

MoNrrANT's conversation concerning  mat-&#xD;
ters of business resulted in his leaving the&#xD;
Priory very early next morning to allow hium-&#xD;
self the requisite time to attend to what they&#xD;
had decided should be done, so Josephine,&#xD;
who was not dressed in time to see him before&#xD;
he started, spent another miserable day.&#xD;
lie came back from the city quite late, and&#xD;
found that after an absence of three days,&#xD;
Walter and Mr. Fatnman had returned from&#xD;
their search after the eloped lady.&#xD;
" Ernest," said Walter, " we have company&#xD;
in the house, to wit: our two old friends, who&#xD;
have recently received the distinguished title&#xD;
of the Daumon and Pythias of New York, be-&#xD;
cause they are inseparable companions. You&#xD;
may guess that we have the honor of enter-&#xD;
taitning Faro and Wheeler within these justly&#xD;
proud walls. But, eat your dinner, we are&#xD;

presence to begin."&#xD;

"No; and yes. Go in and eat your din-&#xD;

In spite of our most untiring efforts, we have  "I would like to go," she replied, coloring&#xD;

raven tresses,,loosely confined in a long, grace-&#xD;
fully-arranged net.&#xD;
He turned away. She had not noticed him,&#xD;
and he was the last of the gentlemen as they&#xD;
escorted her to her horse in a body. Walter&#xD;
lifted her into the saddle. A few moments of&#xD;
bustle and merry confusion, and away they&#xD;
went, Jessie in front, Faro, Wheeler, and Wal-&#xD;
ter close to her. while Montant, who had been&#xD;
used to the saddle from childhood, curbed his&#xD;
impatient horse to keep pace with Mr. Fatman's&#xD;
heavy cob, imported from England on purpose&#xD;
to carry his bulky weight with ease and&#xD;
safety.&#xD;
After a sharp ride, they reached a point on&#xD;
the road where Walter commanded a halt, which&#xD;
soon brought the horses' heads together, and a&#xD;
consultation ensued.&#xD;
" Well," said Mr. Wheeler, " since you three&#xD;
must tear yourselves away, I'mean to propose-&#xD;
that is, if Miss Jessie is willing-that we ride&#xD;
on to my father's place, not two miles off. I&#xD;
know my sister Sallie will be-alh-delighted&#xD;
to see you, Miss Going, and if Walter says there&#xD;
is nothing-ah---improper, and as a rest won't&#xD;
hurt the horses-I do, in fact, inviteyou to come;&#xD;
and the others can call for us when they get&#xD;
through."&#xD;
All agreed, and a moment later Montant&#xD;
watched them ride off at a hand-gallop, Jessie&#xD;
in the midst, faithfully supported on the right&#xD;
and left by her old admirers.&#xD;
"Talk about vanity," he muttered. " I do&#xD;
not blame any man for aspiring to the vanity&#xD;
of showing the world such a wife as that I By&#xD;
heaven t she is a perfect queen, and he who&#xD;
possesses her,-the first and only man privileg-&#xD;
ed to kiss those proud lips, and receive the&#xD;
homage that meets her at every turn as half&#xD;
his own due,-he will be a lucky man. I won-&#xD;
der whether one of those old beaux will not&#xD;
get her finally, stupid and shallow though they&#xD;
be. I don't think she can love any one, so I&#xD;
suppose she will take it into her head some&#xD;
day to thow herself away, and she will easily&#xD;
succeed."&#xD;
They reached the cottage described by Wal-&#xD;
ter as the philosopher's home. A neat, well.&#xD;
kept plat of grass covered the slight ascent&#xD;
from'the road to Mr. Muller's modest door, and&#xD;
there they beheld the great thinker, basking in&#xD;
the sunlight that shone in under the roof of a&#xD;
neat porch. He had his beer before him on a&#xD;
little round table, and from his pipe ascended&#xD;
the smoke-wreaths of peace, and completed the&#xD;
majestic tranquillity of Mr. August Muller.&#xD;
"Welcome to my house, welcome to my&#xD;
heart and to my bhore," ie said, risig.&#xD;
"Rarely doesAugust Muller, in the seclusion&#xD;
from the world. which lie has of late chosen&#xD;
enjoy the gratification of receiving so distin&#xD;
guished a trio.  Here we have the young&#xD;
merchant, with the good old name (shaking&#xD;
hands with Walter). IIere we have the young&#xD;
merchant with an old head (greeting our hero)&#xD;
and here we have the tower of strength an&#xD;
substantiality, bodily, financially, and charac&#xD;
teristically, if I may so express-myself."&#xD;
" You may," answered Fatman;- " but let u:&#xD;
find a place to tie our horses." '&#xD;
&#xD;
" This post is not bulky, but it is true&#xD;
wood," said the philosopher.   " Truth is&#xD;
mighty, though it be slim (with a glance at Mr.&#xD;
Fatman's 'corpulence and at his own meager-&#xD;
ness); but to come to business; let me ask&#xD;
you, Mr. Going, and you, Mr. Fatman, to con-&#xD;
tent yourselves with these two chairs, while I&#xD;
take this young gentleman into the house, to&#xD;
speak with him upon matters of some import-&#xD;
ance."&#xD;
When they found themselves alone in the&#xD;
parlor, Muller addressed  our hero in  a&#xD;
whisper:-&#xD;
" Will you lend me an ear, if I make one&#xD;
preliminary remark before entering upon this&#xD;
sad subject of Mrs. Fatman's strange halluci-&#xD;
nation, and her unjustifiable elopement with&#xD;
my late friend, Stilletto'?"&#xD;
"So, you know all about it?" cried Montant.&#xD;
" I do."&#xD;
" Have they gone very far ; and is she de-&#xD;
termined to stick to her vile paramour ?"&#xD;
" Let me suggest that the latter of your&#xD;
questions be reversed; and permit tme to con-&#xD;
sider that you have asked me, Will he stick to&#xD;
her ?"&#xD;
Montant looked at the lawyer inquiringly.&#xD;
"It is even so," said the philosopher. "'The&#xD;
question is, will he stick to her who has been&#xD;
another's wife?  It is rare that men fall truly&#xD;
in love with others' wives. Generally, such&#xD;
love is based upon a passion which my good&#xD;
taste -forbids me to name. I pretend to be&#xD;
able to prove that even a widow can not, and&#xD;
should not, so fascinate-"&#xD;
" Enough of that," cried Montant, flushed&#xD;
and angry. " Come to business."&#xD;
" But I must first ask you this question.&#xD;
Are you convinced that August Muller is to-&#xD;
tally innocent of any knowledge, conniving, or&#xD;
assisting in the murder of John Van Strom?"&#xD;
lie asked the question in a trembling voice.&#xD;
A feeling nobler than his wretched conceit&#xD;
prompted him, and the " August Muller " came&#xD;
with a sad-almost anguished--tone, from his&#xD;
lips; not at all like his usual sonorous poin-&#xD;
posity.&#xD;
Montant was moved to acknowledge to him&#xD;
his convictions. The fact was apparent, and&#xD;
had been clearly developed in the inquiries&#xD;
made by the authorities, after Stilletto was&#xD;
proved the murderer, that Muller was per-&#xD;
fectly innocent of the murder, or of any pre-&#xD;
vious knowledge of it.&#xD;
"I thank you," said the philosopher, and his&#xD;
face was distorted by a more honest than fas-&#xD;
cinating twitching around the corners of his&#xD;
homely mouth. "I am truly grateful to you&#xD;
for this satisfaction. It is the only pleasure I&#xD;
have enjoyed for a long while, Mr. Montant. I&#xD;
once hated you; but you see, I am poor now,&#xD;
and poor men seek every one's friendship."&#xD;
"I thought you owned this house ?"&#xD;
"I do, sir; but I must sell it again. My&#xD;
creditors have taken a great fancy to cultivate&#xD;
my acquaintance, Mr. Montant, and the enthu-&#xD;
 siastic manner in which they admire my house&#xD;
- when they call to see me, is a subject for any&#xD;
student of human nature."&#xD;
sThe philosopher looked very much crest-&#xD;
fallen, and as the twitching of his mouth, by&#xD;

GOING AND SON.&#xD;

FATE.                         151&#xD;
&#xD;
some physiognomical mechanism, forced the&#xD;
tears into his little red eyes, Montant felt&#xD;
heartily sorry for him.&#xD;
" Well, what do you want of me ?" he asked,&#xD;
not wishing to yield to his pity for a man he&#xD;
knew to be, if not a criminal, at least a very&#xD;
questionable character.&#xD;
"I sent for you," replied Mr. Muller, "be-&#xD;
cause you are the most reliable man among&#xD;
those who interest themselves in this elope-&#xD;
ment. I want to obtain your word that I am&#xD;
to receive a thousand dollars if I bring Mrs.&#xD;
Fatman face to face with the man of her pre-&#xD;
vious choice; in fact, with her husband."&#xD;
Montant seemed to consider the matter.&#xD;
"My study of human nature," continued the&#xD;
philosopher, "has always dwelt with peculiar&#xD;
interest upon the subject of self-preservation.&#xD;
It is strange how this heaven-born faculty, or&#xD;
instinct, or, if I may so express it, this purely&#xD;
subjective mental moving power is connected&#xD;
with all our nobler attributes. Honesty, piety,&#xD;
virtue, self-control, moderation, abstenious-&#xD;
ness, and all their train of dependent virtues.&#xD;
Thus you see that I combine iy instinct of&#xD;
self-preservation with the desire to be honest,&#xD;
and help my neighbors. What say you to the&#xD;
thousand dollars ?"&#xD;
" Honesty is its own reward, I have heard&#xD;
say."&#xD;
" A mere perversion of an old proverb, I&#xD;
assure you. Now-"&#xD;
" You shall have the money," interrupted&#xD;
our hero, who knew Mr. Fatman's anxiety to&#xD;
behold his wife would not hesitate at such an&#xD;
obstacle. " And, now, where is she ?"&#xD;
"I am to receive that sun whether Mr. Fat-&#xD;
man induces her to return home, or not?"&#xD;
" Yes."&#xD;
"When?    Now ?" he asked, greedily.&#xD;
"No. As soon as he has met her; and that&#xD;
must be in a place where he has control over&#xD;
her movements."&#xD;
The philosopher nodded.&#xD;
"You see I trust you," he said. "I wanted&#xD;
to deal with some one whose word would he&#xD;
reliable. Besides, I feel like a happier, aye,&#xD;
and a better nan, since you, that have sutffered&#xD;
so much from Stilletto, have acknowledged to&#xD;
me that I am innocent."&#xD;
"Where is she?"&#xD;
" Here, in this house."&#xD;
Montant started.&#xD;
"And Stilletto?" he asked.&#xD;
Away ; I don't know where," replied the&#xD;
philosopher. ''But send Mr. Fatman in, and&#xD;
promise to remain outside, to see that I get my&#xD;
thousand dollars."&#xD;
"I will give you my check for it if all is as&#xD;
you say."&#xD;
"I am satisfied."&#xD;
So our hero went to the front door, and&#xD;
without further explanation, requested Mr.&#xD;
Fatman to step in.&#xD;
Walter and Montant waited half-an-hour-&#xD;
an hour. The philosopher joined them, re-&#xD;
porting that "they are engaged in the deepest&#xD;
kind of soul-engaging discourse"&#xD;
Finally, Mr. Fatman came out of the house-&#xD;
Muller, with some tact, withdrew. Hot tears&#xD;
relied down the afflicted husband's round&#xD;
&#xD;
cheeks, and sobs agitated him, so that it was&#xD;
some time before he could tell them,-&#xD;
"She loves the scoundrel. She consented&#xD;
to this interview, because she wanted us to&#xD;
understand each other. She has robbed ate&#xD;
of thousands, and has turned the money over&#xD;
to Stilletto. She says the rack could not make&#xD;
her disclose his whereabouts; but--hear this,&#xD;
gentlemen! She means to rejoin him unless I&#xD;
prefer to take her, who has robbed and dis-&#xD;
honored me, back to my house."&#xD;
"Cool," cried Walter.&#xD;
" She says she married me for my money&#xD;
only-I married her from love!"&#xD;
Mr. Fatmnan was deeply affected.&#xD;
"A good riddance, I should say," muttered&#xD;
Walter.&#xD;
"She says that I need not expect her ever&#xD;
to love me, even if I choose to receive her&#xD;
again, and that only her respect for decency&#xD;
induces her to consent to it."&#xD;
"Do you suppose this cool effrontery is&#xD;
natural to her character, or has her sweet friend&#xD;
probably taught her all this nice lesson?"&#xD;
"I don't know. I do not understand her.&#xD;
I can not and will not believe that she was&#xD;
always as bad as this at heart."&#xD;
" Couldn't you have used your riding-whip&#xD;
in there to advantage?" asked Walter, pacing&#xD;
the lawn.&#xD;
"No. I do not know why I felt nothing like&#xD;
anger-only intolerable gr'ief as she spoke&#xD;
thus to me.'-&#xD;
"Now, here we have an instance of the&#xD;
truth that no human being is entirely hard.&#xD;
hearted," soliloquized our hero. " Who would&#xD;
have thought Fatman capable of this 9"&#xD;
" Now, gentlemen, what shall I do ?" asked&#xD;
the disconsolate man.&#xD;
"Let her go 1" cried Walter.&#xD;
" I have children by her!"&#xD;
" Your fatherly duty compels you to keep&#xD;
them away from such a mother."&#xD;
" My name will be dishonored I"&#xD;
"Better your name than your home, your&#xD;
house, your bed, and good conscience!1" cried&#xD;
Walter.&#xD;
"Well, I will--hut, though a higher power&#xD;
will punish her, if I catch Stilletto-"&#xD;
" Don't kill him," interrupted Walter. " If&#xD;
Madame has only tenacity enough to stick to&#xD;
him well, she will be quite sutlicient punish-&#xD;
ment. As far as the money is concerned-is&#xD;
it cash, or checks, or bonds, or what ?"&#xD;
" Mostly railroad bonds, I only happened to&#xD;
carry in my pocket-book over Sunday. I had&#xD;
not thought of them since."&#xD;
"Then it is possible to recover a portion.&#xD;
The detectives are on his track any way to&#xD;
earn the tea thousand dollars reward offered&#xD;
for his apprehension as the murderer of John&#xD;
Van Strom. If you advertise the numbers of&#xD;
the bonds-"&#xD;
"She took the leaf out of my book whee I&#xD;
had a list of the numbers, so that is impossible.&#xD;
That devil's whelp told her how to make all&#xD;
safe."&#xD;
'A wonderful fellow is this Stilletto." ex-&#xD;
claimed Walter.&#xD;
And so Mr. Fatman got rid of his wife.&#xD;
A fter another conversation with Mrs. Fat.-&#xD;
&#xD;
man, her husband turned his cob's head home. s&#xD;
ward, alone and in deep melancholy, while theg&#xD;
others rode on to find the rest of the party at&#xD;
Mr. Wheeler's house. This family belonged tov&#xD;
the old settlers, very nice people, who abound I&#xD;
in Westchester County, and they knew how&#xD;
to entertain their guests so well that it wasr&#xD;
late before the latter found themselves on I&#xD;
their homeward road.&#xD;
Miss Jessie, surrounded by her four cav- I&#xD;
aliers, directed the order of the march.&#xD;
" We have only a few minutes of good day-&#xD;
light left," she said, to Mr. Faro, " so let us.&#xD;
have some excitement before darkness sets in.&#xD;
I propose that Mr. Wheeler and Mr. Montantt&#xD;
have a race from here to where yonder treeI&#xD;
marks the- foot °of the hill. On, gentlemen1"I&#xD;
she cried with animation. " The winner shall&#xD;
kiss my hand."&#xD;
"Well, I suppose that Mademoiselle must&#xD;
be humored," said Montaut, who was riding&#xD;
behind her.&#xD;
" Mademoiselle is accustomed to being hu-I&#xD;
mored," she replied, turning toward him, and&#xD;
laughing merrily. "Now, then! Walter and&#xD;
1 will be judges."&#xD;
Off they started. Montant had so far had&#xD;
trouble in restraining his horse, which now&#xD;
darted off with frantic delight.&#xD;
" flow well Ernest rides," exclaimed Walter,&#xD;
in honest admiration.&#xD;
" Splendidly,".corroborated his sister, with&#xD;
sparkling eyes. "Let's after them."&#xD;
They galloped on, and were near enough to&#xD;
the tree to distinguish Montant as the winner.&#xD;
" You may touch your lips to my hand, you&#xD;
most fortunate of knights," said Miss Jessie,&#xD;
blushing considerably through her hilarity,&#xD;
and proceeded to extract said hand from her&#xD;
riding gauntlet. He rode up close to her, and&#xD;
bending low, that no one else could understand&#xD;
his words, he said,-&#xD;
"You do not like to be under obligations. I&#xD;
do not like to receive rewards."&#xD;
He dropped her little hand, and resumed his&#xD;
old place by Walter, just behind icr.&#xD;
Miss Jessie flushed with vexation.&#xD;
For awhile they rode at a rapidpace, which&#xD;
the lady selected, and in consequence but few&#xD;
words were exchanged. The sun was down, and&#xD;
the new moon stood bright in the sky. Ihalf&#xD;
the homeward road had yet to be passed, when&#xD;
Miss Jessie checked her horse, and said:-&#xD;
"Gentlemen, I think I have done my duty&#xD;
to you as your hostess, and have entertained&#xD;
you splendidly all day. You must now excuse&#xD;
me. I want to speak to our dumb friend,&#xD;
whom Walter seems quite incapable of cheer-&#xD;
ing into a sign of life."&#xD;
So saying, she deliberately reined in her&#xD;
horse to Montant's side, and Walter, accus-&#xD;
tomed from boyhood to humor his sister, rode&#xD;
on with the disconsolate Wheeler and the in-&#xD;
vective Faro.&#xD;
'" Mr. Montant," said Jessie, " I have been,&#xD;
and am still, a wayward, spoiled child. The&#xD;
hard lessons of life found mae unprepared to&#xD;
meet them as I should, amnd they have per-&#xD;
verted runny of my better impulses. Especially&#xD;
in speaking and acting when with my friends,&#xD;
on trivial occasionis, have I been more than&#xD;
&#xD;
illy-often very, very wrong. Will you for-&#xD;
give me ?"&#xD;
This was one of her moods-the only mood&#xD;
worthy of her real character. Her noble heart,&#xD;
her good sense, and generous disposition, spoke&#xD;
when she accosted him in this strain, and the&#xD;
maidenly modesty, the holy purity of the girl,&#xD;
ent her a fascination he knew of old, and no&#xD;
vow, no duty, no strength of will could enable&#xD;
him to shake it off now.&#xD;
He' answered her with a fervor to which&#xD;
she listened with downcast eyes and halt-&#xD;
averted face.&#xD;
They spoke of the days that were gone. Of&#xD;
the Priory-as it was when old Mr. Van Strom&#xD;
held his crazy revelries-of the jolly times&#xD;
they had enjoyed in the Fifth Avenue house,&#xD;
and the merry dances they had danced to-&#xD;
gether. The moon, which stood high and&#xD;
shone into their hearts, had before this been&#xD;
the only witness of many an earnest, many an&#xD;
enthusiastic exchange of thoughts between&#xD;
them. Their conversation turned upon the&#xD;
deeper and holier subjects of life, and Montant,&#xD;
inspired by the genius of the hour, spoke with&#xD;
an eloquence he rarely felt disposed to develop.&#xD;
And she replied with all the warmth of her&#xD;
young heart, filled with a sense of the intelli-&#xD;
gence, the worth, and the power of the man&#xD;
at her side. Completely lost in -each other,&#xD;
they rode on, while their horses seemed to un-&#xD;
derstand that the riders were in no hurry, and&#xD;
crept on slowly as docile lambs. 11er rich&#xD;
and manifold character, her loyal and devout&#xD;
soul, and her warni, generous heart, disclosed&#xD;
themselves to him, while she realized his&#xD;
whole excellence. Once sie had loved him,&#xD;
but never had she understood him as to-day.&#xD;
It was an hour in which they forgot the whole&#xD;
world; it was an hour to remain in their mem-&#xD;
ories for ever!1&#xD;
" I wish," he said, as they approached the&#xD;
Priory bridge, "I wish I had always known&#xD;
you as I know you now. My confidence in&#xD;
human nature would have suffered less.&#xD;
"'Tis woman's part to .increase that confi-&#xD;
dence, by showing that hnman nature is n or-&#xD;
thy of trust and belief."&#xD;
" If I had always known you as well as&#xD;
this," he began. "If Ilhad-read you better-"&#xD;
iHe ceased.&#xD;
What, then ?" she asked, in a whisper,&#xD;
trembling violently. "Would you have left&#xD;
us in the hour of need? Would you have re-&#xD;
maned, out of friendship for me .&#xD;
"Yes, I would," lie answered. Ile felt a&#xD;
strange dizziness, and had to gather all his&#xD;
strength to retain his self-possession. A few&#xD;
moments passed in silence, when the horses,&#xD;
with a sudden affection for the stable, gave a&#xD;
jump, and dashed over the Priory bridge.&#xD;
They rode through the woods.&#xD;
" Why, the others have been out of sight a&#xD;
long while," said Miss Jessie, anxiously.&#xD;
" Yes, too long," he said, quite as anxiously;&#xD;
and added, in a tone she could not or would&#xD;
not understand, "Josephie will be worried.'&#xD;
" Walter always plays me stch tricks," she&#xD;
exclaimed, with a feehimg akin to alarm, and&#xD;
giving her horse the lash..f           d&#xD;
When they rode up to the house, they found&#xD;

GOING AND -SON.&#xD;
&#xD;
that the three gentlemen, who, instigated by&#xD;
Walter, had spurred on, were, indeed, in the&#xD;
parlor, having sent their horses to the stable&#xD;
some time before. -Walter cane out to meet&#xD;
them. Montant called out for him to help his&#xD;
sister from her horse, saying that he could not&#xD;
hold his own nag and attend her also. He for-&#xD;
got that the groom was in waiting.&#xD;
They stepped into the hall. Without turn-&#xD;
ing to the right or left, Jessie ran up-stairs.&#xD;
Later she sent an apology that a headache&#xD;
would not permit her to descend.&#xD;
As Montant entered, he saw Josephine. As&#xD;
he approached, he noticed that she was pale,&#xD;
and trembling, and now, in the glaring light,&#xD;
she could see his flushed face and unsteady,&#xD;
feverish eye. She watched him in spell-bound&#xD;
misery for a moment, and then, rising with an&#xD;
effort, greeted him as usual, though not quite&#xD;
so enthusiastically. She did not say a word&#xD;
about his late return and in whose company ;&#xD;
and he, grateful for her forbearance, devoted&#xD;
himself to her all the evening, and they tried&#xD;
to be once more the lovers of old I&#xD;
CHAPTER V.&#xD;
SIMONETTA'S INHERITANCE.&#xD;
"Nature her custom holds.&#xD;
Let shame say what it will."&#xD;
HAMLET.&#xD;
THE flimsy ornaments adorning the ceiling&#xD;
of the Italian dance-hall do not bear a death-&#xD;
lier yellow hue, than the face of the countess,&#xD;
as she lies on a faded lounge where they have&#xD;
carried her, in a sudden attack of illness. Iher&#xD;
wicked heart is fighting its last struggle, her&#xD;
wrinkled, sallow face, shows the contortions&#xD;
which forebode the end.&#xD;
In one convulsive hand, she holds the man-&#xD;
uscript of the "Maniac's Story;" in the other,&#xD;
she clutches the newspaper report of the&#xD;
"Horrible tragedy in a New-England mad-&#xD;
house," where the end of her lover, Judge&#xD;
Bates, is recorded with all the sensational ex-&#xD;
travagance of a reporter, and yet only a faith-&#xD;
ful record of the terrible event.&#xD;
She was comparing the two. and laughing at&#xD;
the analogy. It had been her last laugh, for,&#xD;
in the very midst of the exultation which fill-&#xD;
ed her Satanic soul, the avenging angel had&#xD;
sent a thunderbolt and felled her to the earth.&#xD;
The dancing-girls etand around. They are&#xD;
not attired in their glittering, evening costumes,&#xD;
for the sun has not set, and the afternoon&#xD;
bangs dull and leaden over the scene, showing,&#xD;
in its blank light, the creatures of sin and the&#xD;
abode of vice in all their repulsiveness, in their&#xD;
natural decay. The wantorn faces have lost&#xD;
their leer; appalled and frightened, they stand,&#xD;
about their dying mistress; not a tear softens&#xD;
their hollow eyes, only fear-terror, and the&#xD;
knowledge that they, also, must come to this.&#xD;
And, besides these women, other persons are&#xD;
in the room and surround the countess. They&#xD;
are police officers-they have come to close up&#xD;
*  the den. They have come, to find that, in an-&#xD;
&#xD;
other hour, it will be closed without their aid;&#xD;
for, as soon as the countess has breathed her&#xD;
last foul breath unto the world, her companions&#xD;
and followers will scatter to the winds. Poor&#xD;
winds     -&#xD;
But, there is one face in the crowd which&#xD;
tells a different story. By the side of the rag.&#xD;
ged couch. a woman kneels, weeping. The offs.&#xD;
cers ask her how it is, that she seems to be-&#xD;
wail the loss of one so depraved, and what their&#xD;
relationship has been.&#xD;
"She has been kind to me !" answers Si.&#xD;
monetta Marini, and truly, in this place and&#xD;
associations, there is enough relationship ex.&#xD;
pressed in those words. Yes, the withered hag&#xD;
had been kind to her, and now her glazing eye&#xD;
rests with fond sorrow upon the still attractive&#xD;
face of the girl. Here is the "tender spot " of&#xD;
which the countess told Martin Bates. A nd if a&#xD;
prayer can rise in that heart, it is in thanking&#xD;
God, whose awful presence is before her now, for&#xD;
the mercy of bringing to her death-bed the'one&#xD;
creature upon whom had centered all that was&#xD;
left in her of love and tenderness.&#xD;
The countess, speechless and almost paralyz.&#xD;
ed. made a desperate effort for some purpose&#xD;
which seemed to veigh heavily in her fast-de-&#xD;
parting soul. With great difficulty she made&#xD;
Simonetta understand, and the girl opened the&#xD;
dying woman's dress, and procured two doc-&#xD;
ments, sealed, and addressed to "Simonetta&#xD;
Marini," which the hag had secreted near her&#xD;
bosom. This accomplished, the countess, with&#xD;
a gasp and a grimace, gave up the ghost.&#xD;
The police officers surrounded the corpse,&#xD;
while the dancing-girls stole a last ind awe-&#xD;
stricken view of their late mistress.  Only&#xD;
Simonetta bewailed the hag's death, and her&#xD;
hand closed the stiffening eyelids. Then the girl&#xD;
realized with a pang and a shudder, that she&#xD;
was lonely arid deserted in such a crowd as&#xD;
this, and she tried to make her way to the door.&#xD;
Hlalf-bewildered and truly aiTeeted, she seemed&#xD;
scarcely conscious of her movements, when a&#xD;
friendly hand touched her shoulder. She looked&#xD;
up, and saw Martin Bates. The old man's face&#xD;
almost expressed the resignation, of despair,&#xD;
but a pitying, friendly light shone in his eye as&#xD;
he said, simply, "Come with mer!"&#xD;
She hesitated a moment, and then followed&#xD;
him, willingly. They reached the street, and&#xD;
forced their way through the multitude of&#xD;
queer people fast assembling to gaze upon the&#xD;
remains of the countess-the news -having&#xD;
spread ii an instant over the Fourth Ward.&#xD;
Martin (walking hurriedly). "Let is get to&#xD;
some quiet place as soon as possible ; I have&#xD;
much to say to you."&#xD;
The girl. "It seems wonderful to me that&#xD;
you should seek me out, after what has hap-&#xD;
pened between us."&#xD;
Martin. "All is forgotten,-all forgiven.&#xD;
I am now alone in the world, alone with the&#xD;
burden of my memory, which is haunted by&#xD;
hi ous shapes of sin and misery and horror.'&#xD;
Simonetta (bitterly). " And you have come&#xD;
ack to me because no one else would keep,&#xD;
you company I"&#xD;
Martin. " Not so. I have come to you be-&#xD;
cause you are the one living being that is not&#xD;
&#xD;
associated with my shame and crimes, the one&#xD;
being whom I can look in the eyes and say,&#xD;
honestly: ' Old Martin Bates has been a&#xD;
friend and a comforter to you."'&#xD;
Simonetta. " It is true. No one can deny it;&#xD;
and as I also am without a kindly being to&#xD;
help me, except yourself, I will once more con-&#xD;
fide in you, and consult you about what is to&#xD;
become of me."&#xD;
They reached a place where abrupt stairs&#xD;
led down from the street, into one of those&#xD;
dens known as " music halls," and by mutual&#xD;
consent they descended.  The rooms were&#xD;
nearly deserted at this hour, and they easily&#xD;
found a corner where they could converse&#xD;
without fear of eavesdropping.&#xD;
" Let us examine these papers which the&#xD;
countess gave me before her 'soul fled to the&#xD;
clouds," said the girl, producing one envelope,&#xD;
upon which was marked, " Simonetta's inheri-&#xD;
tance, number 1," and a second bearing the&#xD;
title, "Simonetta's inheritance, number 2."&#xD;
Martin (having opened the first, greedily).&#xD;
" This is her last will. She leaves all to you,&#xD;
her house, her money in bank, her bonds,&#xD;
stocks, and all other property. I knew she&#xD;
must have. saved something, but I did not&#xD;
think it would be as much. Simonetta, you&#xD;
are almost rich."&#xD;
The girl (disdainfully). " Open the second&#xD;
envelope."&#xD;
Martin. " Here is a letter addressed to An-&#xD;
tonio Stilletto, and you are directed to read it&#xD;
before delivering it. Listen: 'Son and villain, if&#xD;
ever you dare to touch a hair of Simonetta's, after&#xD;
I am dead, my ghost will haunt the life out of&#xD;
your black heart. Mark this: a curse be upon&#xD;
all you undertake, withered and blighted wil&#xD;
be all your future life, and eternal damnation&#xD;
shall receive you, unless you leave her un&#xD;
niolested, unscathed by your foul revenge o&#xD;
pestilent approaches of any sort. But before&#xD;
you die, you'll stiffer tenfold the tortures of&#xD;
hell, for my spirit will be like the furies of old&#xD;
and you'll not have an hour's rest unless you&#xD;
obey my last command. You knew me in life&#xD;
You know that I was not to be turned from&#xD;
any purpose. Know, then, that after death]&#xD;
xwill keep my resolves with tenfold vigor, si&#xD;
heed what I say, because dead or alive, I an&#xD;
determined to save that girl from you. Fea&#xD;
me, obey mae, or go hang-'"&#xD;
Martin ceased.&#xD;
Simonetta (after a pause). "The second in&#xD;
heritance is more a kindness to me than th&#xD;
first !"&#xD;
Martin. " Oh, no I Nothing like money I no&#xD;
thing like money !"&#xD;
Simnonetta. "What is the blessing of mono&#xD;
to me if he kills me."&#xD;
Martin. " Do you fear that ?"&#xD;
Simonetta. " I did fear it until I read thi&#xD;
admonishing message."&#xD;
Martin. - "So you think that he will b&#xD;
frightened."._&#xD;
Simonetta. "Most miserably frightened. Thi&#xD;
countess knew him, knew   the weakness o&#xD;
his superstition, and she has drawn a circle o&#xD;
&#xD;
witchcraft around me which will protect me.&#xD;
May the Virgin reward her for it."&#xD;
Martin. " Still I would not suppose that one&#xD;
so hardened in sin should be so much the&#xD;
slave of the most miserable of human weak-&#xD;
nesses."&#xD;
Simonetta. " What bad man is not?"&#xD;
Martin (with a sigh). "I am bad enough,&#xD;
but-"&#xD;
"You are not bad," cried the girl, suddenly,&#xD;
and stretching both her hands out toward&#xD;
him. "Let the world and the law say what&#xD;
they will, I say you are a good, kind, generous&#xD;
man. Take this money. You are poor and&#xD;
old. I do not want it as much as you."&#xD;
le looked at her intently for a moment.&#xD;
His hard, square, cadaverous face softened&#xD;
with emotion, and a ray of hope. With tears&#xD;
streaming faster and faster down his bony&#xD;
cheeks, he said,-&#xD;
" Simonetta, I found you a poor organ-grinder&#xD;
girl. I attempted to draw you away from the&#xD;
brink of the abyss whose hungry jaws were&#xD;
ravenous for another victim. You despised,&#xD;
betrayed me."&#xD;
"But I was not ungratefulI" cried the&#xD;
girl.&#xD;
"Betrayed me," repeated Martin, "but you&#xD;
can make it all up if you will go with me,&#xD;
away from this land of iniquity, away to the&#xD;
far hills of Scotland-"&#xD;
"As your wife?" asked the girl, bewildered.&#xD;
"As my wife, until a few short years shall&#xD;
free you."&#xD;
" And do you know   what I am ?" cried&#xD;
Simonetta.  Do you forget that Stilletto-"&#xD;
" I forget every thing-I forgive every thing.&#xD;
l You have sinned-so have I. Neither can take&#xD;
the responsibility of forming any ties with&#xD;
pure and blameless people, without heaping&#xD;
r another and far greater sin upon our heads.&#xD;
e But let me tell you, Simonetta, that since we&#xD;
f both know every crime which rests upon our&#xD;
, consciences, we can best regain peace by unit-&#xD;
u ing in the task of repentance and reform.&#xD;
Then do not hesitate. Let people talk as they&#xD;
n will, let them sneer in derision, let the world&#xD;
I continue to snarl at us like the wild beast-&#xD;
o we will go among new people, seek a new&#xD;
n world."&#xD;
r    "When shall we go ?" cried Simonetta,&#xD;
jumping to her feet.&#xD;
"1At once, at once 1 Oh, that old Martin&#xD;
- should be happy once more."&#xD;
e    "As soon as we can turn into hard money&#xD;
the inheritance of my benefactress ?"&#xD;
"Yes, yes.  I also have realized a little&#xD;
fortune out of poor Eben's estate, so we are&#xD;
y  comfortable, all comfortable, my dear girl. I&#xD;
feel that my crimes,committed from brotherly&#xD;
love, which had grown-into the infatuation of&#xD;
s a madman, are all forgiven, and you also will&#xD;
leave behind you the dirt and dishonor which&#xD;
e this vile town and that murderous Stilletto have&#xD;
cast upon you. Will you not, carissima?"&#xD;
e    " If the Virgin lends a gracious ear to my&#xD;
f prayers, she can cleanse the worst of us,"&#xD;
f replied Simonetta, devoutly.&#xD;

CHAPTER VI.&#xD;
A VOICE FROM HEINE.&#xD;
"Shall I hear more, or shall I speak at this?"&#xD;
ROMEO AND JULIET.&#xD;
Fon several days Jessie kept her room, de-&#xD;
scending only for a short time in the middle of&#xD;
the day; though remaining longer when her&#xD;
father's business permitted him to spend the&#xD;
day with her. She was invisible when the&#xD;
gentlemen left the house in the morning, and&#xD;
when they returned from the city, she had&#xD;
already retired, pleading a continuation of&#xD;
headaches.&#xD;
Montant was very busy for the week follow-&#xD;
ing the holiday described in a previous chapter,&#xD;
and his relations with Josephime remained the&#xD;
same as on that evening. They conversed con-&#xD;
stantly, but he was so much engrossed by busi-&#xD;
ness that he was more desirous cf rest and en-&#xD;
tertainment than of the passionate love pre-&#xD;
viously characterizing their private moments.&#xD;
Josephine was kinder and more studiously&#xD;
affectionate than ever, but through it all there&#xD;
appeared a languishing weariness in her look&#xD;
and manner. It was an important week for&#xD;
Going, Montant &amp;amp; Co., and at its close they&#xD;
repaid to the estate of John Van Strom, or&#xD;
rather to Josephine, the two-hundred thousand&#xD;
dollars Montant had borrowed.   He seemed&#xD;
relieved of a burden after the transaction had&#xD;
been completed, and Josephine was delighted&#xD;
with his animated spirits. For the first time&#xD;
since a cloud overshadowed the serenity of&#xD;
their affection, the subject of their marriage I&#xD;
was discussed.&#xD;
"No more postponement of that day," said&#xD;
Montant, more firmly thanenthusiastically. "In&#xD;
ten days all will be fixed."&#xD;
"Shall we stay here till then ?" she asked,&#xD;
somewhat startled by his tone.&#xD;
"As you desire, my darling I" he cried, more&#xD;
heartily than before. ' I am yours already,&#xD;
and will follow your wishes in all such trivial&#xD;
matters."&#xD;
"Well, then, let us have the wedding here, ac-&#xD;
cording to Mr. Going's pressing invitation. It&#xD;
will be a very quiet one. No show, or white&#xD;
dresses for met"&#xD;
Montant's face fell, but she failed to notice it,&#xD;
and they agreed that the wedding should be in&#xD;
ten days, at the Priory, and only a few of their&#xD;
most intimate friends were to be invited.&#xD;
"Will Bella come ?" asked Moutant.&#xD;
"I think so."&#xD;
ttIt does not seem likely, from the tone of her&#xD;
letters."&#xD;
"That tone will change when she sees -"&#xD;
"What?"&#xD;
That we are really to be married, dear."&#xD;
Sunday came, and Mr. Paradise, who had&#xD;
promised and postponed his visit, finally arrived.&#xD;
He brought Mr. Goimig a letter from a gentle-&#xD;
man in New York, which he read carefully and&#xD;
xvith a thoughtful brow.  The subject treated&#xD;
in the letter seemed very important and worthy&#xD;
of deep consideration, for his looks rested pen-&#xD;
+     sivehy upon his daughter, whose improved&#xD;
health permitted her to join the family again,&#xD;
&#xD;
and then wandered with the same thoughtful.&#xD;
ness to Montant and Josephine. Something&#xD;
occupied his mind which probably caused him&#xD;
many a doubt and struggle, and he was absent-&#xD;
minded even during dinner, the time of all&#xD;
others when he was wont to be scrupulously&#xD;
attentive in his manners.&#xD;
It was a Sunday dinner, so like the olden&#xD;
times, with the sunbeams dancing on the richly-&#xD;
papered walls, and the old air of refinement,&#xD;
elegance, and stateliness marking all that was&#xD;
done or spoken, always excepting Mr. Para-&#xD;
dise, who sneered as usual at every one. though&#xD;
in truth his sarcasm was not so biting por his&#xD;
sar donic taunts so bitter as of old.&#xD;
" Walter seems to enjoy this new state of&#xD;
affairs," he said.&#xD;
" Yes," replied that gentleman. "Fatman&#xD;
has now left us; but the port wine crust re-&#xD;
mains on the doors and the honeysuckle is on&#xD;
the walls. I will live and die in this place."&#xD;
" A palatial residence, Mr. Going," said the&#xD;
hunchback, imitating Fatmar. "But, speaking&#xD;
seriously, I would as soon have expected to&#xD;
see the dog kiss the cat, or a Prussian embrace&#xD;
a Frenchman, as to find you two reconciled. I&#xD;
thought the feud between you and my fat&#xD;
friend was too deep to be easily bridged over."&#xD;
" When kind fortune smiles on a man al-&#xD;
ready prepared for an old age embittered by&#xD;
poverty, perhaps disgrace, lie is readily dispos-&#xD;
ed to forgiveness," replied the old gentleman.&#xD;
"Although friends spring up to greet the for-&#xD;
tunate as quickly as they forsake the unlucky,&#xD;
yet they are always welcome. To-day I feel as&#xD;
if I never had cause to complain."&#xD;
Paradise was silent. When het father had&#xD;
concluded, Jessie raised her eyes to Montant.&#xD;
to send him a look of gratitude; but finding&#xD;
his gaze riveted upon her face with an ex-&#xD;
pression of which perhaps he himself was not&#xD;
conscious, her eyes were hastily cast down and&#xD;
she colored crimson. Josephine noticed and&#xD;
read him; but she concealed her impressions&#xD;
under the guise of unusual good humor, and&#xD;
became quite hilarious.&#xD;
Neither the shadow of pecuniary cares, nor&#xD;
the business anxiety which had dampened&#xD;
many a family party-in the old house, nosy&#xD;
rested upon them, but a more threatening bur-&#xD;
den was on their hearts, though they attempted&#xD;
to laugh it off succeeding-remarkably well, if&#xD;
the general merriment could be considered a&#xD;
criterion.&#xD;
" By Jove, she is a lovely--a superb woman,"&#xD;
said Walter to himself, referring to his fair&#xD;
neighbor, Josephine Van Strom, who showed&#xD;
to advantage in her ripe, glowing beauty, when&#xD;
intentionally sprightly, entertaining, and fas-&#xD;
cinating.&#xD;
When the ladies retired, it happened that&#xD;
Mr. Going was talking to Montant, and both re-&#xD;
moved themselves and their cigars to the bow-&#xD;
window, leaving Walter and tne hunchback&#xD;
alone at the table.&#xD;
Walter!"&#xD;
" Well, your honor?"&#xD;
"Why the devil don't you marry that&#xD;
widowv ?"&#xD;
Walter starell-&#xD;
"That's pretty good," he cried.&#xD;
&#xD;
' Have you never thought of it ?"&#xD;
It was impossible to say whether he had or a&#xD;
not, since lie did not answer the question.  V&#xD;
She has a million of dollars. She is young. V&#xD;
She is iiot only passionate, but as true a woman&#xD;
,s ever lived; to which I can testify. She is&#xD;
as handsome as I am homely (which is saying  c&#xD;
a good deal); you are young-"&#xD;
" But what are you talking about ?" said&#xD;
Walter, lowering his voice that the others s&#xD;
nmiglht not hear. " You know she is engaged&#xD;
to Montant. What would he do ?"            r&#xD;
" iniuph I" growled the hunchback, andf&#xD;
quickly changed the subject,               i&#xD;
They soon rejoined the ladies, and a walk k&#xD;
was proposed.&#xD;
"I do not feel well, Ernest," said Josephine.c&#xD;
"I ani afraid I left my room too soon after my -i&#xD;
sickness. I feel oppressed, as if another illness&#xD;
were in store for me, so I think I will remain&#xD;
at home. Will you keep me company ?"&#xD;
" Of course."&#xD;
" Montant I" called Mr. Paradise.&#xD;
WellI"&#xD;
" Walk with me, I have something to tell&#xD;
you."&#xD;
" I am going to remain at the house with&#xD;
Mrs. Van Strom."&#xD;
" Can't let you off. I am compelled to ask&#xD;
you to hreak the Sabbath with me and talk&#xD;
business, offending this glorious sunny after-&#xD;
noon by speaking of dusty agreements, moldy&#xD;
records, and other nasty law documents. As1&#xD;
it is all for the benefit of our fair client there,&#xD;
I call upon you, by your duty as trustee, to&#xD;
obey, for I will not soon have another oppor.&#xD;
tunity."    '&#xD;
" What a burden too much wealth is,"&#xD;
sighed Josephine. "But go, Ernest, since Mr.&#xD;
Paradise will have it so."&#xD;
Why was it that the business talk did not&#xD;
last long-how  came it that Montant and&#xD;
Jessie walked together along the little beach,&#xD;
while Mr. Going, Walter, kind the .lawyer&#xD;
strayed far behind?&#xD;
In the course f tihe conversation-that free&#xD;
causerie characterizing the idle moments of old&#xD;
friends-they spoke of German philosophy.&#xD;
"I believe it is all nonsense-that is-I&#xD;
think there is some sense at the bottom of it ;&#xD;
but carried to a point above the sphere of&#xD;
ordinary life where alone it can be made&#xD;
useful," said Miss Jessie, wisely.&#xD;
"You commenced a very intelligent speech&#xD;
by a 'very hasty sentence," he replied, smiling.&#xD;
"Nonsense it certainly is not, and though you&#xD;
are correct in praising the philosophy of life,&#xD;
the most abstract teachings of the German&#xD;
school (not so the French) can be applied to&#xD;
the most obscure lesson of life, because logic is&#xD;
the life of German intelligence, and logic&#xD;
can not lose itself in vague speculation."&#xD;
" Why do they indulge in-all those dreadful&#xD;
half Latin appellatives, though, making their&#xD;
books horribly unintelligible, to mme at least ?"&#xD;
"It is a fact," he answered, "that when-&#xD;
Emanuel Kant speaks of his Kategorische&#xD;
Iauperat vus he might possibly have couched&#xD;
the same idea in terms comprehensible to all!"&#xD;
" lie was a great man, I uindemrstand."&#xD;
"-Yes,'nd do you know why ?"&#xD;
&#xD;
No. If you want to tell me, let's rest&#xD;
while. Here is a seat between two trees,&#xD;
where we can see the Sound as well as by&#xD;
fading in the sand."&#xD;
" I will tell you in a very few words."&#xD;
" That's right. Philoso iy should be la-&#xD;
onic," said the young lady, decidedly.&#xD;
" He was great," lie continued, when they&#xD;
were comfortably seated, with only a small&#xD;
pace of the rustic bench separating them.&#xD;
"He was great because he established a&#xD;
eason for votue. IIe selected human conscience&#xD;
for his subject, and made of that mysterious&#xD;
intuitive monitor a definite, tangible principle,&#xD;
based on irresistible logic, proving its cause&#xD;
and strengthening its existence by the pillars&#xD;
of reason, absolute argument, and clearly de-&#xD;
fined and logically derived truths."&#xD;
"But does not religion serve the same pur-&#xD;
pose ?" she asked.&#xD;
" Reason and religion serve in reality one&#xD;
and the same purpose. They both come from&#xD;
God, and to-day Emanuel Kant stands as the&#xD;
savior of many who are convinced by reason;&#xD;
but would not be converted by religion,&#xD;
Happy are those who can combine the two I"&#xD;
" Can you?"&#xD;
Ile looked into her eyes, which spoke more&#xD;
than interest,-nmore than attention to what lie&#xD;
had just said, or what his answer might be.&#xD;
Even her beauty, calculated to thrill the breast-&#xD;
of any man, was not so fascinating as the&#xD;
bright intelligence and depth of mind that&#xD;
shone in her when the mood permitted, and he&#xD;
was delighted above measure.&#xD;
" I can try," lie said, with a smile.&#xD;
"You laugh at my earnestness I" she cried,&#xD;
disappointed. "'Talk to me more about your&#xD;
German philosophy."&#xD;
"I must nake it short, then," lie answered,&#xD;
for there is no telling how long you will be&#xD;
pleased with the subject. In a minute you&#xD;
will be wanting to see which of us can thiow&#xD;
a white pebble to the greater distance over the&#xD;
water."&#xD;
'low does Kant establish the logic of our&#xD;
conscience ?" she asked, persistently .&#xD;
" I aii not sufficiently learned in his doctrines&#xD;
to answer that question satisfactorily, but I&#xD;
know that lie entirely separates the inner man&#xD;
from the outer world. All objects he treats as&#xD;
impressions only, and even demonstrates our&#xD;
inability to prove their existence. We think&#xD;
that is the Sound before us, but we can not&#xD;
prove that it is. This is one of his f midaiental&#xD;
theories which aids himi in showing us our&#xD;
individual self in contrast to all the rest of&#xD;
creation."&#xD;
"Or what we consider creation."&#xD;
"Thank you," lie replied, with a quiet smile.&#xD;
"From this isolation of Self, lie shows the&#xD;
grandeur, the majesty of the self-sufficient&#xD;
soul, and consequently the dependent anid i-&#xD;
fei-ior importance of the outer world.  Ile&#xD;
teaches us to judge the objects around us, not&#xD;
by their own, but by cur own light, and, ma be-&#xD;
littling their importance, elevates our.individ-&#xD;
ual soul to the place where it belongs."&#xD;
"'hen, in subjecting the otiter world to the&#xD;
individual aiid self-existent sul. lie must also&#xD;
think less of the mind, which judges from&#xD;

&#xD;
outside objects entirely, than of the heart&#xD;
whose mysterious intuition is the life of th&#xD;
soul. It is a doctrine which centers upon th(&#xD;
heart, Mr. Montant I" she cried, with enthu&#xD;
siasm.&#xD;
"But the mind brings the heart (as you cal&#xD;
his JIrnpes-elivus) to a disciplined knowledge of&#xD;
its true worth"&#xD;
"Does not this theory affect the abstract&#xD;
outer world as well as the material? Can we&#xD;
prove that a recognized law, a signed pledge, a&#xD;
given vow, is our duty any more than that a&#xD;
horse is absolutely, and beyond doubt, a horse&#xD;
Does he not subject the tangible duties of life&#xD;
to his Imperativus as well? lie must l"&#xD;
"tYes," answered Montant, if you put it in&#xD;
that light, I can not but admit that if I under-&#xD;
stand him correctly, a law, a pledge, or a vow,&#xD;
should be sanctioned by the Kategornsche Im-&#xD;
perativus, else it is not right to keep it-for the&#xD;
hrperwtivua is the highest, holiest judge I"&#xD;
"The heart, you mean," she said, slowly, as&#xD;
if to take im the whole meaning of the sen-&#xD;
tence as she amended it. "The heart must&#xD;
approve, or the law, the pledge, the vow, is&#xD;
unholy!1"&#xD;
He looked at her as though he had received&#xD;
a shock! Did she think,-could she know&#xD;
what she was saying? Did she purposely&#xD;
throw the firebrand into his inflammable soul,&#xD;
to kindle there an unquenchable flame ?&#xD;
She saw his agitation, which was indeed in-&#xD;
capable of control or suppression, and suddenly&#xD;
burst upon her the meaning which might be&#xD;
put upon her words. Coloring deeply with&#xD;
confusion and alarm, she abruptly rose, and it&#xD;
was some moments before she could call a&#xD;
woman's weapon to her aid. Changing her&#xD;
manner, she cried, coquettishly,-&#xD;
"I am tired of philosophy. Let me fulfill&#xD;
your prophecy. I dare you to throw white&#xD;
pebbles into the dear blue water against me."&#xD;
When the rest of the party joined them in&#xD;
that innocent amusement, Montant stepped&#xD;
aside and watched her, Iiseinated more than&#xD;
ever, as he saw her laughing and dancing&#xD;
around with all the gayety of a perfect child.&#xD;
11er hair had escaped from its confinement,&#xD;
and the merry wind played in the waving&#xD;
tresses-a fresh bloom was on her face, and&#xD;
the sprightliness of youth sparkled in her&#xD;
bright eyes.&#xD;
Who would think that this girl could talk&#xD;
as she has just talked to me ?" he said to him-&#xD;
self, and a rebellious evil voice in his heart&#xD;
whispered, "Josephine, with all her charms,&#xD;
can neither talk philosophy nor run along the&#xD;
beach like this girl ;" but he silenced the&#xD;
voice, and, with a conscience that would not&#xD;
be silenced, walked to the house to hear,.with&#xD;
a sharp pang of distress and self-denunciation,&#xD;
that Josephine was quite ill again with a re-'&#xD;
lapse of fever.&#xD;
After whispering a few loyal and loving&#xD;
words through the half-opened door, he van-&#xD;
dered around the house, lonely and disconso-&#xD;
late, until tea was served, upon the return of&#xD;
the strollers. The rays of the sinking sun&#xD;
gilded the dining-room and shed a beauteous&#xD;
light ever that fhee, from which he could not&#xD;
always avert his looks. Miss Jessie had en-&#xD;
&#xD;
tirely recovered her self-possession, and the&#xD;
e delicate tint upon her cheeks was the hue of&#xD;
e health only. After tea, as they were sitting&#xD;
- a quiet family party in the drawing-room,...&#xD;
"I do not think it would disturb Mrs. Van&#xD;
I Strom if you were to sing, Jessie," said her&#xD;
f father.&#xD;
" I have studied those songs you brought&#xD;
t me, Mr. Montant," said the young lady.&#xD;
I am glad of it. In my humble opinion,&#xD;
t they were composed by the' greatest master&#xD;
that ever wrote a note."&#xD;
" Schuman ?" she said, reading the name on&#xD;
the title-page.&#xD;
"Yes."&#xD;
"I wish Germans would adopt musical&#xD;
narnes, also," said Miss Jessie.&#xD;
She arranged the notes before her by his&#xD;
assistance, and, while she was singing, he re-&#xD;
mained in such a position as to cormuand a&#xD;
partial view of her face.&#xD;
Indeed, she had studied the songs! Al-&#xD;
though her voice was not remarkably power-&#xD;
ful, it was very sympathetic, and as she sang&#xD;
the magnificent melodies correctly, the feeling&#xD;
with which she was inspired was sufficient to&#xD;
interpret correctly the great composer's ih-&#xD;
mortal thoughts.&#xD;
Ile had selected the celebrated series of&#xD;
Schuman's songs, with words by Heine. They&#xD;
are short, but precious bijoux, and as she sang&#xD;
one after the other, she entered more and more&#xD;
into the spirit of love, longing, and complaint,&#xD;
her eyes grew moist and were cast down when&#xD;
he stepped up to lay another of the songs be-&#xD;
fore her. Unfortunately, she was obliged to&#xD;
sing the Eiglisli translation, but borne up by&#xD;
the sublime strain of the melody, the plaintive,&#xD;
passionate words spoke to every heart among&#xD;
her few listeners.&#xD;
"What is.this ?" she asked Montant, irn an&#xD;
uncertain voice, as lie laid the last of the songs&#xD;
before her. Ile read the first line:-&#xD;
" Warur sind den die rosen so blass."&#xD;
She began the song. As the music and&#xD;
words wailed forth the lament of a blighted&#xD;
love, her emotion became more and more ap-&#xD;
parent. The last words:-&#xD;
"Why am I sick and sad at heart,&#xD;
Oh, darling, answer me I&#xD;
Oh. tell mne, ay sweet love, wherefore&#xD;
//eat thou forsuken te I"&#xD;
fell from her lips in trembling, thrilling accents.&#xD;
She ceased. Not a sound broke the silence,&#xD;
She lifted her brimming eyes and met the gaze&#xD;
of' Montant bent upon her with the full agony&#xD;
of love that knew no more reason or control.&#xD;
For a moment she returned the gaze, though&#xD;
it burned her eyes like fire; for a moment she&#xD;
trembled like a leaf, and her bosom heaved con-&#xD;
vulsively, then she arose and glided hastily&#xD;
from the room.&#xD;
What she said to herself and to her God, as&#xD;
she stood on the dark piazza, leaning her&#xD;
aching head against a massive pillar-what&#xD;
her thoughts were and what a struggle she&#xD;
had to undergo, none knew, and no one offered&#xD;
to intrude upon her moment of weakness.&#xD;
After a few minutes, during which those&#xD;
that remained in the drawing-rooma kept an&#xD;
&#xD;
awkward silence (even Paradise was speech-&#xD;
less), she returned, calm and collected, and&#xD;
said, in a firm, clear voice:-&#xD;
i Papa, I want to speak to you in the li-&#xD;
brary."&#xD;
Moantant had left the room, unwilling and&#xD;
unable to encounter the wondering glances of&#xD;
the others, and paced the hall like one steeling&#xD;
his iron will in the white heat of the furnace&#xD;
of tribulation. Jessie entered the drawing-&#xD;
room by a door which opened directly upon the&#xD;
piazza, so he had not seen her re-enter. But&#xD;
lie was very much astonished to see Josephine&#xD;
descend the stairs soon after the music had&#xD;
ceased, and approached her to expostulate.&#xD;
She looked flushed with fever, and excused&#xD;
herself in advance.&#xD;
"1 could not bear that dreary room any&#xD;
longer, and I have been separated from you so&#xD;
long already, dear, so I made an effort, wrap-&#xD;
ped myself up well, and came to look for&#xD;
you.,,&#xD;
Although he was not satisfied that it was&#xD;
not imprudence, he was glad to have her near&#xD;
him, and he consented that she should stay&#xD;
long enough for a good walk in the hall.&#xD;
"I want a glass of water," said Josephine,&#xD;
finally, so they stepped into the dining-room&#xD;
and procured the refreshment. The sound of&#xD;
voices from the library reached them through&#xD;
the door which separated the two rooms, and&#xD;
as lie had not heard Miss Jessie asking for a&#xD;
private interview with her father, it did not&#xD;
suggest itself to him that they might be in-&#xD;
voluitary eavesdroppers.&#xD;
"Then I will answer Mr. Van IHagen's letter&#xD;
to-morrow," said the voice of old Mr. Going.&#xD;
" Although his age is an objection, his high&#xD;
respectability, his excellent name and family,&#xD;
together with all that accomplishments, edu-&#xD;
cation, and wealth can do to make a gentleman&#xD;
a desirable connection, prevent me from gain-&#xD;
saying your decision."&#xD;
"It is not a decision yet," answered Jessie,&#xD;
in a distinct, composed voice, " but you may&#xD;
tell him, that, in your opinion, I will accept&#xD;
him."'&#xD;
Iontant staggered to the wall. A suffocat-&#xD;
ing pain almost mastered his senses, and fal-&#xD;
tering the broken words, "0, ay God!" he&#xD;
pressed his hands to his temples, trying in&#xD;
vain to recover himself,~ When he succeccdted&#xD;
(in a moment, which seemed to him ages), Jo-&#xD;
sephine stood before him without a sign of&#xD;
the feverish flush upon her face. 11er eyes&#xD;
met his, and he saw her anguish, her deathly&#xD;
suffering. With her hands clasped against her&#xD;
heart, she stood motionless, petrified, and her&#xD;
face, from which no suffering could banish the&#xD;
Madonna expression, resembled that of the&#xD;
Virgin when she looked upon the Cross where&#xD;
all her hopes were crucified.&#xD;
"Josephine," he said, huskily, in his agony&#xD;
and sinking upon his knees, a thoroughly&#xD;
wretched man, "Josephine, can you forgiv&#xD;
me?"&#xD;
"Forgive you," she muttered, and it seeme&#xD;
to him that he heard a stranger's voice. "For&#xD;
give you? Yes, yes, all is forgiven." An&#xD;
now the fever sent the blood boiling to he&#xD;
temples, and with a low moan, she sank to th&#xD;
&#xD;
flop r. She was carried up-stairs to her room,&#xD;
and laid upon her bed, from which she did not&#xD;
rise for weeks.&#xD;
CHAPTER VII.&#xD;
THE BALL.&#xD;
" Was't you that did so oft contrive to kill him?"&#xD;
As You LKE IT.&#xD;
DREARY days passed at the Priory while Jo-&#xD;
sephine was ill--too ill to be visible to any&#xD;
one but those two grim guardians of the sick,&#xD;
the doctor and the nurse.&#xD;
The scene at the library door so vitally af-&#xD;
fected Josephine, as to cause a relapse of brain-&#xD;
fever. Montant refused to explain, and an-&#xD;
swered all queries of " How did it happen?" by&#xD;
a shrug of the shoulder and a frown, which&#xD;
ill became his open and habitually serene&#xD;
countenance.&#xD;
From that hour he avoided Jessie, who re-&#xD;
turned the compliment with a frigidity her&#xD;
experience in society had taught her to sus-&#xD;
tain to perfection. Thus separated from Jo-&#xD;
sephine, and further than ever removed from&#xD;
Jessie, Montant began to find his stay at the'&#xD;
Priory intolerable; so he concluded to remam&#xD;
in town, devoting himself exclusively to busi-&#xD;
ness, until Josephine should be sufficiently re-&#xD;
covered to receive him. Miss Jessie seemed&#xD;
to suspect that both her father and brother&#xD;
believed her to be very unhappy, and to evade&#xD;
their sympathy, she intrenched herself behind&#xD;
a wall of imperturbable indifference, or a cold&#xD;
serenity that must have appeared strange in&#xD;
one so young ; but the gentlemen recognized&#xD;
her quiet determination~ to settle matters by&#xD;
herself alone, and left her undisturbed. Under&#xD;
these circumstances, neither Walter nor his&#xD;
father enjoyed the best of spirits, and when at&#xD;
home, escheved conversation and society.&#xD;
" I have not yet written to Mr. Van Iaigen,"&#xD;
said her father, one morning, as he was break-&#xD;
fasting with his daughter alotne.&#xD;
Why not?   I thought that point was set-&#xD;
tied," replied the young lady, carelessly.&#xD;
" Well, but we were interrupted that eve-&#xD;
ning, you know!1" said he, looking out of the&#xD;
window, and feeling  uncomfortably embar-&#xD;
rassed.&#xD;
Miss Jessie shrugged her shoulders, and re-&#xD;
plied: "Do as you wish, papa. I have told&#xD;
you that I am willing to encourage him, so the&#xD;
r matter rests entirely in your hands."&#xD;
"I think that since we owe so much to Mrs.&#xD;
Van Strom, and considering that she is to be&#xD;
connected with us by every tie except blood-&#xD;
relation, we owe it to ordinary delicacy to&#xD;
postpone a step like this until she is well,&#xD;
or at least out of danger."&#xD;
y  " I am satisfied. if you are," said Miss Jessie,&#xD;
e and the subject was dismissed.&#xD;
Not many days after Josephine had been&#xD;
d rudely hurled back into the horrors of a sick-&#xD;
ness from whose perils she had just emerged,&#xD;
I a carriage drove imp to the house from the&#xD;
r railroad-station, containing a lady in deep&#xD;
o mourning, who alighted, and was greeted with&#xD;
&#xD;
FATE.                       157&#xD;

GOING AND SON.&#xD;
&#xD;
some surprise on the part of Mr. Going and&#xD;
his daughter. When she threw back her&#xD;
veil, her :ace, pale and stoical, with her mono-&#xD;
tonous tone and impassive manners, were&#xD;
those of a person having lost all interest in&#xD;
life. It was Bella Van Strom, whom Mr.&#xD;
Going had informed of Josephine's illness, and&#xD;
who had come to nurse her. After several&#xD;
days of calm consideration, Bella had deliber-&#xD;
ately arrived at her conclusion, but when she&#xD;
entered the sick-room of the fair patient whose&#xD;
beauty no fever could distort, her heart melt-&#xD;
ed, and she was happier than before.&#xD;
During the whole of that anxious time&#xD;
which preceded her convalescence. Montant&#xD;
remained away, and Bella stayed with her&#xD;
charge day and night, her only relaxation&#xD;
being an occasional walk when she visited her&#xD;
parents. Smith, the tailor, was still residing&#xD;
with his worthy spouse, in the same house&#xD;
whore the mare had paused to meditate,&#xD;
though he had abandoned his trade. living in&#xD;
the ease and comfort provided by Bella.&#xD;
Josephine's convalescence, depending fully&#xD;
as much upon regaining her peace of mind as&#xD;
upon her physical recuperative powers, was.&#xD;
perhaps, due in the greatest measure to Bella.&#xD;
We will not inquire by what means or by&#xD;
what arguments the tailor's daughter succeed-&#xD;
ed in bringing peace to that storum-tossed soul;&#xD;
but with the regained bloom of health, serene&#xD;
tranquillity begau to subdue the strife which&#xD;
had heightened the ravages of the fever, and&#xD;
toward the end of May, she was in full pos'es-&#xD;
sion of health and beauty, her figure a little&#xD;
less luxurious, her face a shade paler than of&#xD;
old, but altogether--charming. Thus Moutant&#xD;
found her when lie returned from the city,&#xD;
with stronger resolutions than ever, aiid coui-&#xD;
sequently far happier than while his doubts&#xD;
and struggles threatened to master him.&#xD;
His tirst conversation with Josephine took&#xD;
place in Bella's presence, and she noticed that&#xD;
they talked more like friends than lovers.&#xD;
Montant offered to kiss her-she refused, haltf&#xD;
laugljing, half seriously.&#xD;
" Not before a certain day !" she cried.&#xD;
"Then let us fix the day for good this time,"&#xD;
he said, with slight impatience.&#xD;
So they fixed the day which they had so&#xD;
often appointed before. Was this arrange-&#xD;
ment to fare better than the last?&#xD;
It soon became known to the small company&#xD;
that Jessie desired to give a ball, and although&#xD;
Bella's presence, and recent widowhood, made&#xD;
the originators of the idea hesitate about car-&#xD;
rying it out, Bella spoke to Jessie as soon as&#xD;
she heard of it.&#xD;
" Nothing would trouble me more than to&#xD;
have you postpone your party on my account.&#xD;
If I thought I could not prevail on you to ig-&#xD;
nore me, I would at once take my leave. I&#xD;
would much prefer to remain a few (lays&#xD;
longer, and if you desire my acceptance of&#xD;
your hospitality, give your party by all means.&#xD;
I will simply remain up-stairs for that eve-&#xD;
ning. And so the f/te was decided upon.&#xD;
What a difference there was between the&#xD;
Priory of to-day and when old John Jacob Van&#xD;
Strom gave his masquerade ball. where carica-&#xD;
ture seemed the order of the day, or rather, of&#xD;
&#xD;
the night, and the house haunted by a ghost.&#xD;
The dismal lamp which then scarce disturbed&#xD;
the darkness around the gallery of Van&#xD;
Strom portraits was replaced by a gas chan.&#xD;
delier (for the gas-mains had reached even the&#xD;
Priory), and the walls-once so. dark--were&#xD;
frescoed in the day when Fatman was lord of&#xD;
the manor, so that now it resembled a grand&#xD;
salon more than a tomb-like vault.&#xD;
And the company attending Miss Going's&#xD;
ball were very unlike the fantastic mixture of&#xD;
unadorned old-fogyism, and grotesque fancy,&#xD;
that then thronged the hall. A good band&#xD;
played for the dance, instead of the four negro&#xD;
fiddlers who then   stamped the floor, and&#xD;
shrieked out the figures of the quadrille, and&#xD;
tortured their poor fiddles until they squeaked&#xD;
like so many demons, regardless of the dread-&#xD;
ful scene of lunacy and death there enacted&#xD;
before them.&#xD;
The company now present was elegant, and&#xD;
the arrangements for the ball corresponded.&#xD;
True, those tasty ball costumes, those excru-&#xD;
ciating toilets, those ladies and gentlemen, at-&#xD;
tired in their best, moving among their friends,&#xD;
and conversing  so delightfully, were only&#xD;
component parts of Vanity Fair; but many a&#xD;
real intellect was there, and many a stout heart&#xD;
beat within a lace-covered bosoii. Not all&#xD;
vanity in Vanity Fair.&#xD;
" What a delightful house for a ball!1" Such&#xD;
was the universal verdict, as the spacious&#xD;
apartments received the brilliant concourse of&#xD;
guests; and few of those who had come from&#xD;
the city on purpose to attend, regretted the&#xD;
exertion.&#xD;
Soon the ball opened, and the dancers began&#xD;
to flit through the hall, and around the parlors,&#xD;
while the graver portion of the company-the&#xD;
solid men and heavy fathers-congregated in&#xD;
the library and dining-room, where supper was&#xD;
to ho laid later in the evening.&#xD;
Mr. Paradise was there, of course. Strange&#xD;
as it may seem, Mr. Going liked the hunch-&#xD;
back beyond merely paying the ordinary tribute&#xD;
to his talents and powerful intellect. But&#xD;
to-night the lawyer seemed to have something&#xD;
to do, besides conversing with his host and&#xD;
the elderly gentlemen who crowded around&#xD;
him,-gentlenien of wealth and influence, and&#xD;
among them Mr. Chip, who looked quite re-&#xD;
fined, in his dress suit; but his white cravat&#xD;
was too tight, giving him a flushed face, that&#xD;
reminded one of the symptoms that accompany&#xD;
human choking.&#xD;
Mr. Paradise was preoccupied. The reader&#xD;
must have noticed, in the course of his expe-&#xD;
rience, that during a ball at a country house,&#xD;
there is always a multitude, composed of' the&#xD;
servants and their friends, who throng the&#xD;
piazzas, and peep in at every window, to catch&#xD;
a glimpse of the gay world within. Now, Mr.&#xD;
Paradise thought it fit to mingle with these&#xD;
outsiders, and, in fact, appeared to pay more&#xD;
attention to them, or rather to one person&#xD;
among them, than to the brilliant company&#xD;
who were dancing and laughing, unconscious,&#xD;
of the person who had captivated the great&#xD;
lawyer. This one person amused himself by&#xD;
sneaking around the house, and tixing a pair&#xD;
of lynix-eyes upon every individual within and&#xD;
&#xD;
without the illumined mansion. le was a&#xD;
little man, with a conspicuous black beard,&#xD;
having the air and dress of a foreigner.&#xD;
Finally, Mr. Paradise requested the foreign-&#xD;
looking gentleman to step into the drawing-&#xD;
room, and there introduced him as,-&#xD;
" My friend. Baron de Stombe. Mr. Going.&#xD;
I have taken the liberty of bringing the baron&#xD;
along with me, because I wanted him to see&#xD;
something of American society."&#xD;
Mr. Going, considerably astonished at this&#xD;
late introduction (for the lawyer had not men-&#xD;
tionied his friend before), made a bow, without&#xD;
exactly knowing what to say.&#xD;
" Your most obedient, sir," said the baron,&#xD;
displaying more vulgarity than foreign accent,&#xD;
and making an awkward, low bow.&#xD;
" Have you arrived in this country lately,&#xD;
sir?" said Mr. Going; and arming himself with&#xD;
studious politeness, ie added, "I am most&#xD;
happy to receive you, or any other friends of&#xD;
Mr. Paradise, at my house."&#xD;
"Sir," answered the baron, with another&#xD;
bow, " my cratitude is only excelled by my-"&#xD;
"Beauty," suggested Mr. Paradise, who&#xD;
stood neat him, biting his lips.&#xD;
Whereupon the foreigner grew very red, and&#xD;
Mr. (oing, quite perplexed; but the lawyer'&#xD;
came to the rescue, and took his friend away.&#xD;
-  Well, Stump," he asked, laughing, "how&#xD;
do you like fashionable society ?"&#xD;
"It is beautiful," replied the detective,&#xD;
whom it was next to impossible to recognize,&#xD;
so carefully had he disguised himself. " Beauti-&#xD;
fuil," he repeated, looking around him. "Sich&#xD;
lovely gals, and sich music. It's bully, sir I"&#xD;
" Do you see the mlan you want ?"&#xD;
"No, sir; but I think I will 'fore mornin'."&#xD;
 You are sure lie's here?"&#xD;
"Miller swears that our mutual friend, Sta-&#xD;
letoe, has confided in him in privit. He has&#xD;
got Mrs. Fatman and lots o' chink, all stowed&#xD;
away safe in Canady, waitin' for him to go to&#xD;
Europe, but lie wants to be r'venged on Moun-&#xD;
taii 'fore lie goes to rest in the buzzumn of&#xD;
Venus, and. take the donations of Mercoory.&#xD;
R'venge is strong, Mr. Paradise, and when&#xD;
Miller told him of this 'ore party here to-night,&#xD;
Staletoe straightways axed him sichi questions,&#xD;
and in sich a way, that I'm sure lie's here, or&#xD;
means to be."&#xD;
"No letting him off this time!" said Mr.&#xD;
Paradise, in a threatening tone.&#xD;
Oh, no I no, no I".&#xD;
"I am certain that it was you who got him&#xD;
out of that court-room before the judge had&#xD;
time to issue a bench-warrant for his arrestI"&#xD;
Oh, tno! no, no !"&#xD;
" But mind you, if you don't arrest him to-&#xD;
night, and that before he does any mischief,&#xD;
dye hear?   If you don't, you'll have a fight&#xD;
with me, and you know I don't joke when I&#xD;
say fight!"&#xD;
" Rely on me, guv'ner."&#xD;
"Can't you .imagine in what disguise lie&#xD;
means to appear?"&#xD;
"No. You see, all I know is what I've told&#xD;
yer. Miller was scared out of his wits, and&#xD;
the strangest thing is that I found it out at all.&#xD;
The .way of it was this yer: I had to see Mil-&#xD;
Ier on a matter of business, which was IHob-&#xD;
&#xD;
goblin. I wanted to see if my shares was any&#xD;
good, so up I goes to Miller, and on my way,&#xD;
thinks I, there is a reward of ten thousand&#xD;
set on John Van Strom's murderer. Now,&#xD;
what a nice thing that'ere ten thousand 'ud be&#xD;
for my family in my old age. I have three,&#xD;
and the old woman, Mr. Paradise. So knowing'&#xD;
Miller was more like to be awears of Staletoe&#xD;
nor any one else, I eross-questions him a bit,&#xD;
and got out of him what I told yer. lIe said,&#xD;
too, that since Mr. Mountain had been very&#xD;
kind to him, he'd like to keep danger away&#xD;
from that gentleman's head ; so he told ue all&#xD;
that Staletoe had told him, which I have told&#xD;
you, and I made up my mind that our Eyetalian&#xD;
friend will be here to-night."&#xD;
"No letting off, nowI"&#xD;
"Rely on me," said Mr. Stump, honestly.&#xD;
" Tie was an old friend of mine, but now&#xD;
there's an end to all that. Ten thousand in&#xD;
money and a bully newspaper notice is worth&#xD;
more than friendship with a mankiller."&#xD;
In the ball-room; Miss Jessie queened it&#xD;
without a rival. Never was her beauty more&#xD;
radiant, never did her spirits flow merrier,&#xD;
never had she been so sprightly, lovely. fas-&#xD;
cinating. Mr. Faro and Mr. Wheeler were&#xD;
but diminutive objects in the host of adorers&#xD;
gathered around tihe young lady; and among the&#xD;
gossip enlivenmig the party, the report (true for&#xD;
once) was prominent, that she probably was&#xD;
as great an heiress this night as before tho&#xD;
time when the world considered Going &amp;amp; Son&#xD;
doomed to poverty.&#xD;
Miss Jessie had granted to every one of her&#xD;
friends a lively turn around the room,-every&#xD;
one except Montant, who had not asked the&#xD;
honor, so, at last, she became quite exhausted,&#xD;
and requested Walter to take her to the dining.&#xD;
room for a glass of lemonade. The elderly&#xD;
gentlemen, who had first taken refuge hero,&#xD;
had just been requested to leave, that the&#xD;
waiters might prepare supper, so the room&#xD;
was deserted.&#xD;
" I don't like negroes around the house, Wal-&#xD;
ter, and you know it," said Miss Jessie. "Why&#xD;
did you order black waiters ?"&#xD;
"Because I thought it better tact to order&#xD;
most of the supper from the village than to&#xD;
have the whole brought out from Dtlmtonico's&#xD;
at an absurd expense.   Of course, I was&#xD;
obliged to take what waiters these people&#xD;
could give me, and they a're lamentably, though&#xD;
unmistakably, black."&#xD;
"Get me the lemonade, like a good fellow,"&#xD;
said his sister.&#xD;
" Why don't you dance with-your lover? it will&#xD;
be his last ciiane," suddenly whispered a voice&#xD;
behind her, with marvelous rapidity, yet per-&#xD;
fect distinctness.&#xD;
She turned around, with a start, so fright-&#xD;
ened that her heart stood still; but no one&#xD;
was near except a black waiter, busy at the&#xD;
sideboard, which stood not far from her chair.&#xD;
She scanned him closely. He was apparently&#xD;
an old.darky, with gray wool, and stooping&#xD;
considerably.  le quietly followed his occu-&#xD;
pation, without noticing her motions.&#xD;
"Did you dare to speak to me ?" inquired&#xD;
the young lady. sternly.&#xD;
" What did you command, Miss ?" inquired&#xD;

"Did you speak to me?"'&#xD;
"I want to know whether you spoke to&#xD;
me ?"&#xD;
" Oh, no, ma'am," answered he, with hum-&#xD;
ble surprise.&#xD;
"All right, then," said Miss Jessie; but&#xD;
when Walter returned with the lemonade, she&#xD;
related the queer circumstance to him.&#xD;
The consequence was, that. Walter took oc-&#xD;
casion to watch the old negro whenever he&#xD;
could do so unobserved by the latter. Then&#xD;
he drew the attention of Mr. Paradise to some-&#xD;
thing indefinitely strange in the man's.appear-&#xD;
ance, when closely watched, and finally, the&#xD;
Baron de Stombe was advised by Mr. Para-&#xD;
dise to favor the same individual with his&#xD;
regards.&#xD;
"Can it be he ?" inquired the hunchback.&#xD;
"'Pon my word," replied Mr. Stump. "with&#xD;
all due respect to my friend Staletoe, I don't&#xD;
believe he is cunning and bold enough to&#xD;
come in here, and in that rig. No, no, it ain't&#xD;
him."&#xD;
CHAPTER VIII.&#xD;
A BROKEN HEART.&#xD;
"Like the lily.&#xD;
That once was mistress of the field and flourish'd,&#xD;
I'll hang my head and perish."&#xD;
Kira HENI-Y VIII.&#xD;
THE small conservatory which, as in most&#xD;
American country mansions, adjoined  the&#xD;
dining-room, was illumined by Chinese lan-&#xD;
terns, whose colored lights gave the room and&#xD;
the flowers around a fantastic appearance.&#xD;
here, a few couples sought refuge, when the&#xD;
dining-room was thronged with guests, and&#xD;
among them were Miss Jessie Going and her&#xD;
cavalier, the fortunate and envied Mr. Wheeler.&#xD;
Miss Jessie, who had not deigned to invite our&#xD;
hero's attention to her any more than he had&#xD;
volunteered to approach her, seemed, never-&#xD;
theless, to keep him slightly in sight, and&#xD;
when she noticed him in company with Mr.&#xD;
Paradise, walking through the conservatory in&#xD;
whispered but earnest conversation, she con-&#xD;
eluded to seat herself there among   the&#xD;
flowers.&#xD;
"You may bring me an ice into the con-&#xD;
servatory," she said, to her escort.&#xD;
She could not see Montant and Paradise,&#xD;
though she knew they were on the other side&#xD;
of the stand on which the flower-pots were&#xD;
placed; but being seated near the door, could&#xD;
see who entered or left the room.&#xD;
Presently Mr. Paradise stepped out. Then&#xD;
she knew that Montant was. there alone, and&#xD;
surmising that he might soon follow, and on&#xD;
his way out, find her alone, she arose to meet&#xD;
the gallant Mr. Wheeler half-way, when the&#xD;
old negro waiter, who she was certain had&#xD;
made that queer speech to her, in the early&#xD;
part of the evening, appeared at the door of&#xD;
the conservatory. In his hand was a bottle&#xD;
of champagne, and he seemed to be looking&#xD;
for some one lhe could help to wine.&#xD;
" Waiter," called Montant, from the other&#xD;
&#xD;
FATE.                         161&#xD;
&#xD;
end of the conservatory behind the fragrant&#xD;
partition, "I wish you would bring me a glass&#xD;
of champagne."&#xD;
His tone was weary, as if he had seated&#xD;
himself to rest, and was loath to go after the&#xD;
desired refreshment in person.&#xD;
"Yes, sir," replied the waiter, with great&#xD;
alacrity, and turned to the table to get a&#xD;
clean glass. Miss Jessie watched him from&#xD;
simple desire to keep out of his way; while&#xD;
the darky was too much occupied with some-&#xD;
thing that seemed greatly to excite him to&#xD;
notice her in the nook where she had again&#xD;
retired immediately upon noticing his hateful&#xD;
face. ie was doing something to that bottle&#xD;
In another moment he hastened away to bring&#xD;
Montant his glass of wine, and as he passed&#xD;
her a small crumpled piece of white paper&#xD;
came out of his pocket as he withdrew his&#xD;
hand therefrom. Intuition suggested drug-&#xD;
Montant-and danger. At this moment Mr.&#xD;
Wheeler brought her the ice, and was hor-&#xD;
rified at the treatment he received. She&#xD;
pushed him violently aside, and hastily turning&#xD;
the corner, saw Montant at the other end of&#xD;
the room, alone with the waiter, who was&#xD;
just filling his glass. Our hero held it in his&#xD;
hand, and in another moment would have&#xD;
swallowed the contents, when the glass was&#xD;
snatched from him, and while it fell to the&#xD;
floor in fragments, a voice he knew well,&#xD;
gasped:-&#xD;
"It is poisoned! I saw him pour it in I",&#xD;
And there stood Jessie, white, and shaking&#xD;
with emotion. Montant sprang to his feet ; he&#xD;
seized the negro by the throat, and cried,-&#xD;
" Confess, or I'll throttle you I"&#xD;
In an instant the conservatory was filled&#xD;
with people from the dining-room. Montant,&#xD;
fast losing control of himself, perhaps would&#xD;
have made his threat good, but the darky,&#xD;
with great dexterity, drew a dagger. A shriek&#xD;
from the ladies, a stampede among the gentle-&#xD;
men who stood around, as usual, with open&#xD;
mouths-yet Montant was saved from the&#xD;
murderous weapon, for a little man with a&#xD;
black beard and foreign appearance intercepted&#xD;
the threatened stroke, disarmed the assassin,&#xD;
and handcuffed him in a instant. Then the&#xD;
guests saw with astonishment that the skillful&#xD;
foreigner was Mr. Paradise's friend, the Baron&#xD;
do Stombe.   The baron clutched his long&#xD;
beard, it came away, disclosing the bland and&#xD;
smiling face of Mr.'Stump, and pointing to the&#xD;
handcuffed prisoner, with all the delight of a&#xD;
showman exhibiting a gorilla, he exclaimed,-&#xD;
" You knows me, Mr. Mountain; but do you&#xD;
know your sweet black friend?"&#xD;
Our hero suddenly guessed the truth.&#xD;
" If I could only get a leetle soap and water,"&#xD;
continued Mr. Stump, amiably, "I would show&#xD;
the ladies and gentlemen here assembled the&#xD;
white face of Mr. Antony Staletoe, the most&#xD;
no-to-ryus falsefire, stubborn thief, and man-&#xD;
killer in all this enlightened kentry I"&#xD;
" Take me away I" snarled Stilletto, the ex-&#xD;
pression of whose face was happily obscured&#xD;
by his disguise. So Mr. Stump obligingly&#xD;
escorted his capture out of the room, followed&#xD;
by every one except our hero and Miss Jessie,&#xD;
Iwho stood by him, not knowing what to do--.&#xD;
&#xD;
bewildered, confused by - a thousand emo-&#xD;
tions.&#xD;
"You have saved my life l" he whispered,&#xD;
in that soft, caressing tone that no woman&#xD;
mistakes.&#xD;
" Thanks to the mercy of Heaven," she&#xD;
replied, trembling violently.&#xD;
Do you mean what you say ?" he con-&#xD;
tinued, quickly. " Do you mean that you are&#xD;
not indifferent to my existence ?"&#xD;
"Indifferent ?" she cried, convulsively, clasp-&#xD;
ing her hands, and striving in vain for con-&#xD;
posure.&#xD;
" Oh, do not turn away from meI Look up&#xD;
-look in my face and see a man who is about&#xD;
to make a strange confession."&#xD;
Completely at the mercy of the moment,&#xD;
she looked at him. In her tearful eyes he read&#xD;
what she could no longer disguise.&#xD;
"Jessie," he whispered, taking both her&#xD;
hands, " I owe you my life. I belong to you. I'&#xD;
.can not continue the struggle. My strength is&#xD;
gone. It must find utterance. Now, at this&#xD;
moment when Providence has thrown us to-&#xD;
gether, I must confess it, though it cost the&#xD;
life you have just preserved."&#xD;
She could not find it in her soul to resist&#xD;
him. Like a charmed bird she awaited what&#xD;
she knew must come. Trembling, and beside.&#xD;
herself with agitation, she felt her heart leap&#xD;
with delight-and a thrill of eestacy run&#xD;
through every fiber of her pure body as he&#xD;
put his arms around her, and whispered,-.&#xD;
".Jessie, I love yOU"&#xD;
Since when ?" she murmured.&#xD;
"From the moment I first saw you."&#xD;
And you never told me till now I" she&#xD;
moaned, stepping back and burying her face&#xD;
in her hands. With shivering terror she real-&#xD;
ized the misery, the deceit, the sin of his con-&#xD;
fession.&#xD;
Not so he. With a ruthless, almost fierce,&#xD;
determination, lie cast aside all consideration.&#xD;
and all the duties lie owed to Josephine, for&#xD;
he felt that this moment separated him from&#xD;
both forever, and lie was resolved to taste the&#xD;
sweet cup before accepting the endless bitter-&#xD;
ness he knew was in store for him. His arm&#xD;
tightened around her.&#xD;
"Answer me," he whispered, intoxicated&#xD;
by the bliss of holding her trembling form,&#xD;
her throbbing bosom close to his heart.&#xD;
"Answer me. Tell me once, at least, what I&#xD;
see, what I feel, what I know already. Do&#xD;
not withhold from me the height of blessed-&#xD;
ness, but tell ine that you love ine."&#xD;
" I do," she sighed, in a heart-broken, yet&#xD;
fond tone, and hiding her face in his bosom.&#xD;
"May be it is wrong and sinful; but I can't&#xD;
help loving you."&#xD;
And their love, gathering strength, quicken-&#xD;
ed his boldness and conquered her timidity.&#xD;
Their lips met, and for a moment they forgot&#xD;
that they were standing on the brink of de-&#xD;
struction, and that this foretaste of heaven must&#xD;
be their farewell to all happiness on earth.&#xD;
Although nearly unconscious of all sur-&#xD;
roundings, and of the danger lest an eaves-&#xD;
dropper watch them, lie had instinctively&#xD;
drawn her into the farthest corner of the room,&#xD;
wvhere tile tall plants almost concealed them.&#xD;
Il&#xD;
&#xD;
But their voices might have been overheard&#xD;
in the deserted apartment, and when, from the&#xD;
intoxication of love, she returned to reason,&#xD;
and strove to free herself from his embraces,&#xD;
she suddenly whispered,--&#xD;
"I hear footsteps on the other side of the&#xD;
room. Could some one have heard us ? For&#xD;
the peace of all of us, I hope not I"&#xD;
Yes, there had been steps, though they&#xD;
quickly glided from the room. Josephin's&#xD;
misgiving heart led her to discover the absence&#xD;
of those two from the company.   She had&#xD;
stolen into the conservatory, and from behind&#xD;
the wall of flowers heard all. She was gone&#xD;
now, and the two ,looked with guilty uncer-&#xD;
tainty at each other's doubtful faces.&#xD;
" Guilty?  No," he said to her, warmly.&#xD;
" What the heart dictates can not be wroig.&#xD;
I wl save Josephine from a -life of misery by&#xD;
disguising no longer what had better be known&#xD;
now, than, after marriage."&#xD;
"But, merciful heavens! how will this all&#xD;
end ?" she cried, wringing her hands.&#xD;
"Jessie," called her father's voice, and the&#xD;
old gentleman appeared at the door. Tiho&#xD;
young lady hastened to his side, heedless of&#xD;
her disordered hair and the treacherous blush&#xD;
scarce yet departed from 1er forehead and&#xD;
beautiful neck.&#xD;
" Our friends talk of going home," said her&#xD;
father, not noticing her rather strange appear-&#xD;
ance and manner.&#xD;
" At this hour ?" she cried. "Why, the&#xD;
dancing has hardly commenced yet.  Walter,&#xD;
order a galop, and we will lead it oil."&#xD;
Walter obeyed, and they so inspired the rest&#xD;
that in spite of the cloud cast upon the party&#xD;
by Stilletto's murderous attempt and subse-&#xD;
quent arrest, dancing really commenced with&#xD;
renewed vigor. Jessie seemed indefatigable.&#xD;
Not a friend among all the gentlemen failed to&#xD;
obtain her hand for a turn ; but her father saw&#xD;
what escaped most people, that the tears stood&#xD;
in her eyes, and she had to bite her lips before&#xD;
she could laugh or make a merry remark.&#xD;
Aid thus she danced on and laughed away,&#xD;
weeping incessantly.  She would have given&#xD;
any thing for "a good cry," and at last, unable&#xD;
to stand it any longer, she ran up-stairs with&#xD;
a laugh and a jest, to throw herself sobbing on&#xD;
her bed.&#xD;
11er father softly followed her, and, as his&#xD;
anxious ears caught the sounds of her distress;&#xD;
he turned away with a heavy sigh, leaving her&#xD;
to conquer herself alone.  -&#xD;
Montant paced the library a long while,&#xD;
wondering what to do. Finally he re-entered&#xD;
the parlor where Josephine was conversing&#xD;
with Walter, who soon yielded her to our hero,&#xD;
to attend to his duties as host.&#xD;
" Josephime," lie said, in a low voice, bend-&#xD;
ing over her chair, "I have a confession to&#xD;
-make to you."&#xD;
"Not to-night," she replied, hastily. " Wait&#xD;
till to-morrow."&#xD;
" Why to-morrow ? It is a serious matter,&#xD;
and weighs on my heart heavily."&#xD;
" Wait tilt to-morrow," repeated the widow,&#xD;
rather decidedly:- and without paying any&#xD;
more attention to him, she left the room.&#xD;
.Did she already know what he had to con-&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb  n="162-163" xml:id="VAC7268-00000091"/>&#xD;
fess to her? Had she listened in the con-&#xD;
servatory ? As he tortured himself with these&#xD;
doubts, Jessie entered the room, and Montant&#xD;
saw that she had been weeping. He watched&#xD;
her, the queen of the dance, glancing quietly&#xD;
around the host of admirers that flew to her&#xD;
side, and longed to be near her to shield her&#xD;
from the gay throng that little suspected the&#xD;
cause of her agitation.&#xD;
'lDance with mo, or it will look strange,"&#xD;
he said, below his breath. "Walter has asked&#xD;
me twice why I have neglected you in this&#xD;
conspicuous manner." With a strange smile&#xD;
she accepted the oler, and they danced until&#xD;
both were tired out, when she took her&#xD;
brothers arm and walked away, without hav-&#xD;
ing looked at him or moved her lips.&#xD;
Josephine came to the door and saw them&#xD;
dancing, and then retired to Bella's room. She&#xD;
entered softly, leaving the door ajar, and sit-&#xD;
ting down by her sister, she took her hand.&#xD;
Bella looked quietly up from the book she was&#xD;
reading, to see what, was wanted.&#xD;
"Do you hear that beautiful waltz ?" said&#xD;
Josephine, gently, as the strains of music&#xD;
reached their ears like fairy melodies from&#xD;
dreamland." Those notes remind me of the&#xD;
merry days of my girlhood.  Once I could&#xD;
dance and laugh with any. I am too old for&#xD;
them now."&#xD;
In mute sympathy Rella pressed her sister's&#xD;
hand tighter, gazing earnestly and inquiringly&#xD;
into her face, and so the two women sat in&#xD;
silence for some tiue, in the ditnly-lighted&#xD;
room, while below the dancing was at its&#xD;
height.&#xD;
"'Bella," said Josephine. "I shall never&#xD;
marry."&#xD;
Still Bella did not speak; but a grave, sad&#xD;
expression settled on her face.&#xD;
" That walt tisidivime," continued Josephite,&#xD;
in an unnatural voice. " Ite is dancing with&#xD;
her now. I saw them dancing together."&#xD;
And Bella leated -over to her sister, and&#xD;
tried to lay Jo-ephiine's head upon her breast.&#xD;
" What has happetied," she asked, fearfully.&#xD;
"le has bletraved me ! Ie has kissed her!&#xD;
le has confessed that lie loves her!"&#xD;
" And  ou heard him ; saw him ?" asked&#xD;
Bella, more excited than her sister.&#xD;
heard them only. It was enough. I do&#xD;
not know what makes me so quiet. I have&#xD;
talked an acted like a rational being efer&#xD;
since. Isn't it strange ?"&#xD;
Strange, iindeel!"&#xD;
Well, Josie." said Della, after a pause.&#xD;
Was I not right, when I suspected that this&#xD;
would come to pass? lhas he said any thing&#xD;
to you about it yet'?"&#xD;
No. Ile told me that he had a confession&#xD;
to make, but I put him off till to-morrow."&#xD;
"LHow calmly you speak of it," said Bella,&#xD;
alarmed.  - To hear you, one would think you&#xD;
never loved him I"&#xD;
Josephine shrugged her shoulders.&#xD;
"Vhat do you intend to do'?" asked Bella.&#xD;
"Go hone with you by an early train to-&#xD;
morrow-provided you will take me with&#xD;
you."&#xD;
Bella pressed1 her tightly to her heart, and&#xD;
no further answer was needed. Then the&#xD;
&#xD;
tailor's daughter spoke long and soothingly to&#xD;
her, and before the music had ceased Joseph-&#xD;
tae was weeping, but not altogether miser-&#xD;
able, in the embrace of her faithful sister.&#xD;
'Ihat same night, Mr. Going promised that&#xD;
he would not divulge their intended depart-&#xD;
ure, and before any one in the house was&#xD;
astir, except one servant, Bella and Josephine&#xD;
had left the Priory, and were on their home-&#xD;
ward way. Montant found a note left for him&#xD;
by Josephine, and his misery was not lightened&#xD;
when he read the following:-&#xD;
"I overheard every thing in the conserva-&#xD;
tory. I thought I had a right to listen to all&#xD;
that you would say. I was wrong, and ask&#xD;
your pardon. I am certain you intended to&#xD;
tell me all; but I would save us both from that&#xD;
humiliation. I begin to feel that our engage-&#xD;
ment was a very foolish affair. I am too old&#xD;
for you-you want a young girl for your wife,&#xD;
and since you have found her, be happy with&#xD;
her. You are hereby released from all that&#xD;
you have ever promised me; but I beg you&#xD;
to believe that I bear no malice, nor do I&#xD;
blatte you for, at last, succumbing to a pas-&#xD;
sion born in your heart before you ever knew&#xD;
me. I amt happy in the remembrance of the&#xD;
good that has come to you and your friends&#xD;
through poor mite, and it will be _a coatfort to&#xD;
me im my future loneliness.&#xD;
"(ood-bye, Ernest; good-bye!&#xD;
"As I respect and honor man, so I respect&#xD;
and honor you, and- I thank God that a hasty&#xD;
marriage has been prevented from condenit-&#xD;
itng you to an everlasting struggle between&#xD;
your ditty to me and the dictates of your own&#xD;
heart.&#xD;
" Ever yours, affectionately,&#xD;
"J sEtu'm:."&#xD;
Two hours after the receipt of this letter he&#xD;
left the Priory to take up his residence in New&#xD;
York. He. wrote to Josephine that he had&#xD;
not even attempted to see Jessie again, and&#xD;
lie begged her to forget and to forgive, insist-&#xD;
ing so far as lie could upon marriage on the&#xD;
appointed day.&#xD;
lie received an answer in Bella's hand. It&#xD;
was a courteous, even friendly letter, but it&#xD;
told him only too plainly that even if Joseph-&#xD;
ine were disposed to relent, Bella would never&#xD;
allow it, and he knew that the weaker woman&#xD;
would abide by the better judgment of her&#xD;
stronger sister. Then lie wrote to Josephine&#xD;
once iore :--&#xD;
"My pride is so humbled by Mrs. Van&#xD;
Stromn's very kind letter, that I do not care if'&#xD;
the ship sinks, that is to take mie to Europe&#xD;
to-morrow. I will try if my home in England&#xD;
and life with my parents will afford me that&#xD;
peace of mind I can never again enjoy in the&#xD;
society of my friends here. I am now a singu-&#xD;
lar spectacle 1 A man who has had the greatest&#xD;
successes in mercantile life, and who has been&#xD;
blessed by the love of two noble, beautiful, and&#xD;
true women, yet finding himself so miserable&#xD;
and sick of life that it is a question whether it&#xD;
is possible to bear all and live.&#xD;

" ERNEST MONTANT."&#xD;
He sailed for Europe, where he arrived just&#xD;
in time to see his father breathe his last. He&#xD;
had not dissolved partnership with Mr. Going;&#xD;
but on the contrary, his, visit to England was&#xD;
employed to extend the British connections of&#xD;
the house. In consequence of the continued&#xD;
good-fortune which crow ned the operations of&#xD;
the firm, and his mother's excellent standing in&#xD;
English society, he came in contact with many&#xD;
of the first families. and as his calm dignity,&#xD;
solid sense, and high principles suited the&#xD;
tastes of the English aristocracy of birth and&#xD;
commiierce, he made many warm friends, and&#xD;
had capital opportunities of marriage.&#xD;
Bathe discarded all such ideas. ie was well&#xD;
aware that the love born in his heart when Io&#xD;
was hardly a man, had grown with his growth,&#xD;
sending its root and tendrils through and&#xD;
around his heart until separation had become&#xD;
impossible.&#xD;
And then every letter which readied him&#xD;
from across the ocean lore that, name so dear&#xD;
to hit.  Not only timt name, but his own&#xD;
linked with it. In his replies, he never min-&#xD;
tioied iem own name, which intoxicated him&#xD;
with a thousand sweet remembrances, for lie&#xD;
dared not. How    beautiful W\alter's elumiisv&#xD;
pemanship became when he wrote those six&#xD;
letters ! Every letter seemed to tell its own'&#xD;
tale, and call him back across the water where&#xD;
lie had left his heart, his hope, his happiness&#xD;
*      *       *      *       *      *&#xD;
It is not to be supposed that Josephine left,&#xD;
the Priory in a happy imootd. The peace Bella's&#xD;
faithful friendship promised her was too wide-&#xD;
lv difl'ei'ent frot the happym prospect that haid&#xD;
beguiled her dreams. Weeping in silence, she&#xD;
implicitly followed Bella's counsel, anl liotughi&#xD;
her gentle soul could not harbor bitterness&#xD;
against Ernest Miontant, her distress was uer-&#xD;
whelming.&#xD;
On their way from the Priory, Bella called&#xD;
religion, that great refuge of woman, to her&#xD;
aid, and painted to Josephliie's loving heart a&#xD;
world of goodness, and charity, which they&#xD;
would erect in the midst of this cold. harsh&#xD;
world of enmity and unkindness. h'lie im-&#xD;
mense wealth they had inherited wouh enable&#xD;
them) to carry out any project for the relief of&#xD;
misery, and active benevolence would keep&#xD;
her mind too thoroughly occupied to brood&#xD;
over her sorrows. And though these two&#xD;
women despised' poip and pride. their con-&#xD;
seiousness of the power of goodness they&#xD;
wielded in their large fortune, caused them to&#xD;
exult in its possession, and in making their&#xD;
plans for the future, they forgot for a time&#xD;
the present distress.&#xD;
And so, planning, they came to the old house&#xD;
where poor John had breathed his last. ''ie&#xD;
day was lovely, and the genial breath of spring&#xD;
was in the air.  The ca-9iage rolled up to the&#xD;
door, where the servants awaited them. Home&#xD;
again, bitt howc?&#xD;
Josephine Van Strom was not a woman to&#xD;
surrender all the blessings of love without a&#xD;
sharp struggle. All is glorious and beauttiful&#xD;

in the new foliage overshadowing the lonely&#xD;
path of that poor traveler, homeward bound to&#xD;
a desolate peace. All nature is attired in a tri-&#xD;
umphal garb, and all things earthy seem to re-&#xD;
joice-but there is a broken heart in the midst&#xD;
of all these splendors. Although this heart&#xD;
be but an atom in the earth, though this whole&#xD;
earth be but a speck in the universe-yet this&#xD;
poor broken heart, inftiite in its sorrows, cries&#xD;
to the Lord of worlds, and is heeded by the&#xD;
Omnipotent. Another appeal for mercy I&#xD;

FALwas approaching; the wind blowing&#xD;
around the oh Priory brought an autumnal&#xD;
chill, and Mr. Walter Going kindled mu wood fire&#xD;
in the old-fashioned fireplace of his chamber&#xD;
with his own aristocratic hands. Mr. Walter&#xD;
Going gazed into the mierry flames, which, to&#xD;
the musie of the dismal moaning wind, danced&#xD;
a cheerful defiance to the howling lamentations&#xD;
sweeping through the parks and around the&#xD;
walls of the old mansion.&#xD;
It was a- splendid room in which we have&#xD;
seen the tire built. Implements of gunning&#xD;
and fishing, cricket bats raquets, all sorts of&#xD;
weapons, portraits of noted horses and dhogs,&#xD;
reminiscences of sporting life, such as Derby&#xD;
paintings and hunting scenes;-here and there&#xD;
some lovely woman's picture looking dismayed&#xD;
in such masculine company, a book-case, a gun-&#xD;
rack,-in fine, a crowd of objects to cheer the&#xD;
cheerless life of a bachelor.&#xD;
Mr. Walter Going sat before the glowing&#xD;
logs, and being in want of something to do, re-&#xD;
called to his mind " Reveries of a Bachelor."&#xD;
and philosophized. And to that grand con-&#xD;
clusion did lie arrive, not for the first time&#xD;
either:-&#xD;
" I want a wife!"&#xD;
Mr. Walter Going took a fresh cigar from mu&#xD;
box just opened, displaying an aristocratic ar-&#xD;
ray tof' weeds from the " 'Vuelta A bajo." The&#xD;
fresh cigar soothed his nerves, but the old con-&#xD;
clusion came back :--&#xD;
"1 want a wife!"&#xD;
The fresh cigar was emitting Fantastic&#xD;
wreaths of smokec, mand Mr. Walter Going,&#xD;
stretching himself on two chairs, watched the&#xD;
asen-i(ing rings. Either they inspired him, or&#xD;
his own vague fancies assumed shape, for lie&#xD;
suddenly pushed away the second chair, moved&#xD;
closer to the tire. and, as addressing the co-&#xD;
quettish fitmes, sait, auttibly-&#xD;

ly, and descended to his sister's room. He&#xD;
knocked, and upon being admitted, found his&#xD;
father there, writing a letter on Miss Jessie's&#xD;
pet escritoire.&#xD;
Welter kissed his sister affectionately. He&#xD;
noticed (not for the first time) that she was&#xD;
looking pale, and her beautiful face was more&#xD;
apathetic than usual. "Are you writing to&#xD;
Mr. Van Hagen, father ?" he inquired.&#xD;
"Yes," replied his father.&#xD;
" Do you mean to accept him, Jessie ?"&#xD;
asked Walter, lazily throwing himself on the&#xD;
sofa.&#xD;
"I do," replied his sister, indifferently. " He&#xD;
is a gentleman, and that should be enough,&#xD;
nowadays !"&#xD;
" You intended to accept him some months&#xD;
ago?"&#xD;
" Yes; but circumstances prevented."&#xD;
"Will you do me a favor, Jessie?"&#xD;
" Any thing reasonable ; but pray don't&#xD;
ask any thing difficult to perform?"&#xD;
"Postpone  this  engagement   for  two&#xD;
months."&#xD;
"Why ?" exclaimed Mr. Going, looking up&#xD;
quickly.&#xD;
"Because I, as an always dutiful son and&#xD;
ever attentive brother, ask this as a special&#xD;
kindness and favor to me."&#xD;
The engagement was postponed.&#xD;
That same night Walter wrote a long letter&#xD;
to Ernest Montant. It ended with this sen-&#xD;
tence,-&#xD;
" I know what I am talking about. Trust&#xD;
to me, as far as the girl is concerned. At the&#xD;
same time, I ask you not to show your face&#xD;
here until after Jessie's wedding, unless you&#xD;
know what you are talking about. Write to&#xD;
me, and I will answer iiniediately."&#xD;
With this mysterious paragraph the letter&#xD;
closed.&#xD;
A few days later, Mr. Walter Going made a&#xD;
trip to an Eastern watering-place, where he&#xD;
found, as he expected, two widows. They&#xD;
were both immensely wealthy, and while the&#xD;
elder and planer-looking of the two had re-&#xD;
ceived some offers of marriage, the younger, a&#xD;
very beautiful woman-quite as rich as the&#xD;
other, and of an excellent family, being tha&#xD;
daughter of the late General McLane-a-was&#xD;
besieged by a host of suitors coveting her&#xD;
money, and perfectly willing to take her into&#xD;
the bargain.&#xD;
At first, Walter was almost afraid to at-&#xD;
tempt to approach the fairer of the two, so&#xD;
difficult was it to fight a passage through the&#xD;
phalanx of admirers that surrounded her; but&#xD;
he found that Josephine Van Strom loved to&#xD;
talk to him. With easy freedom she conversed&#xD;
about the old times, and inquired about Ernest&#xD;
Montant in a manner that made him hope she&#xD;
had learned to regard her love for him as a&#xD;
past dream.&#xD;
For a week or more he courted her, and one&#xD;
evening, when the moon was shining brightly,&#xD;
lie asked her to walk with him out over the&#xD;
white sea-beach. There lay the ocean, hushed in&#xD;
sleep and coated in silver. Only in faint mur-&#xD;
mnurs did the drowsy breakers roll up, while&#xD;
high above, in the starry sky, rode the brilliant&#xD;
sovereign of the night, shedding her luster of&#xD;
&#xD;
love over the endless, mighty sea, and expand.&#xD;
ing all human souls far beyond their own&#xD;
littleness amidst the solemn, glorious majesty&#xD;
of nature.&#xD;
" Mrs. Van Strom," said Walter, "I want&#xD;
to talk to you about a friend of ours in&#xD;
England."&#xD;
"Is he well?  Heaven knows I wish him&#xD;
all good."&#xD;
"Do you care for him?" he asked, with&#xD;
some agitation.-&#xD;
" Yes; he was my lover once, as you know&#xD;
very well, and now, although we are separat-&#xD;
ed for ever, I have nothing but prayers for&#xD;
his welfare and earnest hopes for his happi-&#xD;
ness. What do you hear of him?   What is&#xD;
he doing?"&#xD;
"He is miserable!"&#xD;
" I know why," said the widow, drearily.&#xD;
"Now," Mrs. Van Strom, began Wal-&#xD;
ter, summoning all his energy, " it is very&#xD;
well to be kindly disposed toward a friend, but&#xD;
it is altogether a different thing to do some.&#xD;
thing for that friend. . I want to ask you&#xD;
whether, for his sake, you are willing to make&#xD;
a sacrifice-one that may be, great, yet may&#xD;
result in great happiness for-you."&#xD;
I don't know what you mean."&#xD;
Let me explain myself.   We are alone,&#xD;
with the ocean, the moon, and our thoughts.&#xD;
At such a time 1 think two human beings may&#xD;
so far throw off the shackles of society as to&#xD;
be frank with each other, and discuss freely&#xD;
the subjects nearest their hearts."&#xD;
The widow signified her acquiescence, and&#xD;
slackened  her steps, perfectly willing to&#xD;
listen.&#xD;
" Ernest Montant loves my sister. He al-&#xD;
ways did, and always will."&#xD;
" Arid she loves him."&#xD;
" Then," said Walter, " why don't they&#xD;
marry ?"&#xD;
Josephine was silent.&#xD;
" Because their pride keeps them from it,"&#xD;
he continued. "lie feels as if he had com-&#xD;
mitted a great wrong, and isstubonly resolv-&#xD;
ed to make himself and my poor sister&#xD;
miserable. All from honorable motives !"&#xD;
Still, the widow did not speak.&#xD;
"'T'here is a remedy," said Walter, hurried-&#xD;
ly. "And two weeks agq, when I found that&#xD;
my father had determined to marry Jessie off'&#xD;
to an old man, who would make a respectable&#xD;
husband for her, and a wretched thing of her.&#xD;
I wrote a letter to Montant, telling him that I&#xD;
knew my sister too well not to be aware of&#xD;
the state of affairs, and asking him to write&#xD;
to me immediately whether he was still in love&#xD;
with Jessie, and if he would come home at&#xD;
once, providing I could succeed in removing&#xD;
the obstacles his pride and conscience have&#xD;
created."&#xD;
"What obstacles?  How can you remove&#xD;
them ?" said Josephine, with emotion.&#xD;
" I can't remove them; but you can. You&#xD;
must marry!"&#xD;
Josephine was silent, She could not see her&#xD;
way clear through the thousand conflicting&#xD;
emotions that disturbed her.&#xD;
"If you will marry-marry me, you will&#xD;
free Ernest from his imaginmary obligation anid&#xD;
&#xD;
make my poor sister happy for ever.  But&#xD;
you will do more. You are certain to marry&#xD;
again some day ; but you will never find a&#xD;
man more devoted to you or more jubilant over&#xD;
the hope of taking you toehis arms as a loving&#xD;
wife.  Do not hesitate; let your generous&#xD;
heart speak, and give me just a little of your&#xD;
great love, which little I hope will grow in&#xD;
time, if you will only accept me."&#xD;
"Give me till to-morrow to decide," said&#xD;
Josephine, not knowing what to do.&#xD;
"Do you want to inflict a sleepless night&#xD;
upon me ?" cried Walter, much agitated. "Can&#xD;
you be cruel enough to make nie linger in sus-&#xD;
pense, like a desperate beggar at the door of&#xD;
opulence ? Come Josephine ! I love you with&#xD;
all the fervor of my heart, and if you want an&#xD;
honest, affectionate fellow for your husband,&#xD;
take me now."&#xD;
She reflected a moment, and following the&#xD;
impulse of her heart. which told her that she&#xD;
was doing right, said softly,-&#xD;
"Well, 1 am satisfied."&#xD;
With a cry of exultation, Walter caught&#xD;
her in his arms, and as he pressed her close&#xD;
to his heart, he said,--&#xD;
" I don't understand why all men don't fall&#xD;
in love with you, Josephine !"&#xD;
*    *    *    *    *    *    *    *&#xD;
A month later, Walter stepped into the&#xD;
library, at the Priory, where his father and&#xD;
sister were sitting. "In this practical age,"&#xD;
he said, " there is nothing like announcing&#xD;
news laconically. So oblige me by reading&#xD;
this letter, Jessie."     '&#xD;
Jessie read-" I am engaged to be married&#xD;
to Josephine." It was dated from New York&#xD;
a month before, and addressed to Montant, in&#xD;
London. She started from her chair, and,&#xD;
coloring crimson, threw herself on her brother's&#xD;
breast.&#xD;
" Read the answer, Jessie."&#xD;
She took the paper from his hand, and-read-&#xD;
"I start for New York a week from to-day."&#xD;
In vain did she attempt to hide her emotion.&#xD;
In vain did she strive to be calm, or to conceal&#xD;
that she understood the whole situation per-&#xD;
fectly. Unwilling to betray too much, she left&#xD;
the room; while Walter said to his astonished&#xD;
father,-&#xD;
"It's all right now! I hope, sir, you ap-&#xD;
prove your children's choice. This is the day&#xD;
set to answer Mr. Van Hagen."&#xD;
*    *    *    *    *    *    *    *   *&#xD;
Walter drove down from the Priory on the&#xD;
day that Ernest Montant was expected to&#xD;
arrive, and met him on the pier where the&#xD;
steamship made fast.&#xD;
"All well ?" -was Montant's first question,&#xD;
as they warmly shook hands.&#xD;
41 All well," replied Walter.&#xD;
"How is business ?"&#xD;
" As fine as can be, my boy ; we have mar-&#xD;
velous luck."&#xD;
"-If we are only sharp enough to reap our&#xD;
harvest in time, and not wait till the storms&#xD;
come, which must break in upon us soon I"&#xD;
"IPl leave that to you now. You are&#xD;
smarter than 1."&#xD;
" And what general news is there of our&#xD;
- friends?"&#xD;
&#xD;
"1 Of our enemies I have to report that Stil-&#xD;
letto has escaped from the punishment which,&#xD;
as the newspapers say, he so richly merited."&#xD;
" What ! has he broken ~ out of State&#xD;
prison ?"&#xD;
"He never got there."&#xD;
" Why, how is that possible ?"&#xD;
"Ask of the winds," quoted Walter, tragic.&#xD;
ally. "Or, rather, ask the police justices, ask&#xD;
Mr. Stump, ask the district attorney, ask&#xD;
the judge of the sessions,-but please don't&#xD;
ask me."&#xD;
"Is it possible that justice in this city is so&#xD;
loosely administered that a murderer can slip&#xD;
through and gain his liberty in the very face&#xD;
of the most positive evidence of his guilt ?"&#xD;
" Not only possible, but true," replied Wal-&#xD;
ter. "By a complication of somehows he is&#xD;
enjoying the society of the delightful Mrs.&#xD;
Fatman in some part of Europe, and I only&#xD;
hope that she has kept control of the money&#xD;
she stole from her husband, or she will find&#xD;
herself deserted pretty soon, I fancy."&#xD;
"And what has become of Fatman ?"&#xD;
" He seems to have loved his wife, and is&#xD;
leading a life of miserable loneliness. We do&#xD;
not see much of him; but I understand that&#xD;
he has lost a great deal of money, besides losing&#xD;
the darling of his heart."&#xD;
"What have you heard of Martin Bates?"&#xD;
inquired Montant, with some hesitancy at&#xD;
pronouncing the name.&#xD;
"I understand that he really took that girl&#xD;
Simonetta Marini to Scotland and married her."&#xD;
" They are a couple well met I"&#xD;
" Ile was a good fellow." said Walter, softly.&#xD;
4 My dear fellow," replied our hero, "in this&#xD;
age of crime and dishonesty, we can not afford&#xD;
to excuse a felon's villainy by praising his good-&#xD;
heartedness. Martin Bates was guilty of many&#xD;
offenses, and, as a good citizen, 1 must set my&#xD;
face against the placing of a martyr-glory&#xD;
around such heads as his."&#xD;
" Yet it was a noble act to take tnat poor&#xD;
polluted girl anmd save her from all the horrors&#xD;
of her fate, by marrying her."&#xD;
Ernest shrugged his shoulders, and then&#xD;
said,-&#xD;
"'Let us forget the strange people who&#xD;
haunted our lives, and came near dragging us&#xD;
down to destruction with them."&#xD;
" And let us now have a good dinner at&#xD;
Delmonico's, and then we will drive to the&#xD;
Priory. I brought down a pair of horses for&#xD;
you."&#xD;
" A pair of horses, Walter? You extra-&#xD;
vagant dog, there is no help for you."&#xD;

was blue, it was on this splendid day, and the&#xD;
trees already showed, in the gilded edges of&#xD;
their leaves, indications of the coming splen-&#xD;
dor of color that would soon turn the woods&#xD;
into a magnificent display of golden and fiery&#xD;
tints, laid on by the master-hand of Nature.&#xD;
And with this external glory of beauty, when&#xD;
Nature puts on her most gaudy robes, the&#xD;
hearts of the two young men expanded with a&#xD;
foretaste of the joys that were now insured for&#xD;
the future. Still, they did not discuss the ob-&#xD;

monico's, followed by a cigar and a delightful&#xD;
drive to the Priory, were inspiring, but it was&#xD;
not until the swift horses began to smell the&#xD;
approach of the stable that Montant ventured&#xD;
to say:-&#xD;
"Ias Miss Jessie finally refused that old&#xD;
fogy, Van Hagen ?"&#xD;
" There she is to answer the question her-&#xD;
self," answered Walter, laughing, as he pointed&#xD;
into the distance, where a lady on horseback,&#xD;
attended by a single groom, became visible.&#xD;
Montant tried in vain to conceal his agita-&#xD;
tion. "What shall I do ?" he asked.&#xD;
"Tell the servant to give you his horse, and&#xD;
let him jump in with me," was the answer.&#xD;
When they approached near enough to re-&#xD;
cognize each other, Miss Jessie halted, and a&#xD;
deep color heightened the blush of exercise&#xD;
that already rested on her cheeks. She then&#xD;
rode up and said, with a pleasure she did not&#xD;
care to conceal,--&#xD;
"Welcome home I This is, deed, a de-&#xD;
lightful surprise." ~'dae&#xD;
Without a word of reply, he jumped from&#xD;
the wagon, and to the titter bewilderment of&#xD;
the groom, grasped the reins of his horse, and&#xD;
asked him to dismount immediately.&#xD;
As the servant knew him, he touched his&#xD;
hat respectfully, glanced at Mr. Going to&#xD;
receive his approval, and then did as he was&#xD;
bid, and held the stirrup for our hero to&#xD;
mount.&#xD;
Walter waited for the attendant to take the&#xD;
vacant seat in the wagon, and touching up his&#xD;
horses, drove off with a merry ringing laugh.&#xD;
How lovely she looked in her closely-fitting&#xD;
ridimg-habit, her black hair waving beneath&#xD;
her hat and feather, and her eyes bright with&#xD;
happiness.&#xD;
" Welcome home once uore !" she said, when&#xD;
Montant was fixed in his saddle; "and we'll&#xD;
have a gallop to see if you have forgotten how&#xD;
to ride."&#xD;
As England is not the place where gentle.&#xD;
men are apt to grow rusty in horsemanship,&#xD;
she had reason to be satisfied when she cast a&#xD;
sidelong glance at him as they rode abreast.&#xD;
He had grown a little stouter, and a full beard&#xD;
gave him a manlier look than before. When&#xD;
they checked their panting horses, after the&#xD;
gallop, she said:-&#xD;
" You have not spoken to me yet!"&#xD;
" Wait till we reach the spring in the woods.&#xD;
hard by the road," he replied, with a smile and&#xD;
sparkling eyes. "Will you please follow ?  I&#xD;
am very thirsty, and really require a drink of&#xD;
water."&#xD;
So saying, he wheeled abruptly from the&#xD;
road, and she turned with him under the&#xD;
&#xD;
trees to a spot in the center of a small clear.&#xD;
ing, where they knew of a romantic, bubbling&#xD;
spring. He swung himself from his horse,&#xD;
and tied him to a'tree, without saying a word,&#xD;
and came to her sid to lift her from the saddle.&#xD;
His eyes spoke volumes; and though suddenly&#xD;
seized with trembling confusion,-she allowed&#xD;
herself to be assisted to the green turf by his&#xD;
strong arm.&#xD;
In an instant he had fastened her horse's&#xD;
reins to a branch, and they stood opposite each&#xD;
other, alone in the sanctuary of Nature, alone&#xD;
with themselves and the love that needed no&#xD;
more restraint.&#xD;
"Jessie," he cried, opening, his arms.&#xD;
And there she was in another moment, nest-&#xD;
ling her beautiful head on his breast; and as&#xD;
they exchanged the holy vows of love, and&#xD;
sealed the eternal bargain with their lips, such&#xD;
a happiness was theirs as reconciles one to all&#xD;
past suflerings.&#xD;
"Say, 'Ernest, I love you!l'" he dictated,&#xD;
pressing her close to him.&#xD;
" Ernest, I love youI"&#xD;
"Tell me you have loved me for years,&#xD;
through all the changes and sorrows we have&#xD;
experienced together."&#xD;
"Yes, yes. I have lovesl you ever since I&#xD;
first saw you."&#xD;
"But there were times," he said, " when&#xD;
you thought you did not love me, or why did&#xD;
you slight me so often, and give me cold looks&#xD;
and cold words?  If you only knew what I&#xD;
have suffered for youI"&#xD;
"Have we not suffered together?" she whis-&#xD;
pered. " It is true, that when I saw my father&#xD;
sinking under the weight of his trials, I forgot&#xD;
all but my anxiety for him; and were you not&#xD;
engaged to another? That night, when your&#xD;
precious life was saved through my poor in-&#xD;
strumentality, when you took me to your heart&#xD;
in my distraction and grief, I felt that I had&#xD;
no strength to oppose you. Oh, what changes&#xD;
have we lived through I"&#xD;
"But no more sorrows now," he said, joy-&#xD;
ously.&#xD;
Her eyes corrobdrated the statement.&#xD;
"You will never forsake me?  Oh, do not&#xD;
deceive me now I Do not whisper one word&#xD;
but what you mean to keep through all time."&#xD;
She looked up into his eyes, the celestial&#xD;
light of unbounded love beaming through her&#xD;
tears.&#xD;
"Forsake you! .Deceive you!1"&#xD;
Did he not hold her in his arms, her trem-&#xD;
bling form throbbing in his embrace, her lips&#xD;
sealed to his? What further assurance was&#xD;
necessary. And then they rode home togeth-&#xD;
er-home through the luscious sun-set-ex-&#xD;
hilarated by the freshening breezes from the.&#xD;
Sound. reveling in the words and looks where-&#xD;
by their exultant hearts sought utterance.&#xD;
"Home againI" he cried, as he lifted her&#xD;
from her horse, stealing a kiss while he held&#xD;
her in his arms in the darkling twilight.&#xD;
" Home again, for good and forever !"&#xD;
